Iacobo Taylero, M. Thomae Nucio ibidem Canonicis, salutem in Domino sempiternam. NAtale suum solum (illustrissimi viri) omnes amant, vbi illis nascen∣di datum sit initium: pleri{que} locum ipsum venerantur, vbi institutio∣nis primordia acceperint: & partm amoris nostri vendicat terra, ex cuius prouentibus sustentamur. Qua singulos mouent singula, eadem me vrgent Vniuersa, & quibus alij officij vinculis seorsim obligantur, ego simul omnibus obstrictus teneor. Quomodo ergo Eliens. Ecclesia mihi non esset charissima, vbi primo lucent hanc aspicere, & vitalem spiritum ducere coeperim, piae etiam educationis accessit beneficium, & vnde ex bona parte victus mihi suppeditatur: pro triplici ergo beneficio triplex persoluam officium: primo precibus meis & votis bene illi loco optare non desinam, qui mihi vitae prin∣cipium dederit, deinde scriptis pueritiae meae erudiendae curam compensabo, labore laborem, ne{que} sacris concionibus illi Ecclesiae deero, vt pro terreno súbstato & temporali, spirituale pa∣bulum rependam. Nunc igitur patriae meae illustraturus encomium, vnde exordiar, nescio: Num ab ipsae schola incipiam? illa celebris est tum discipulorum numero, quos vno tempore trecentos & plures suo gremio fouit, tum etiam dignitate: aliquot alumnos & veluti lactentes habuit, po∣stea Episcopos, & Decanos, Concionatores vero quamplurimos. Nec minima pars laudis ex Rectoribus suis illi accreuit: Quorum ab vno Iacobo Spighto viro prudente, & paedagogo diligentissimo praeceptore olim meo quadraginta pene annos administrata est. Si ad oppidum ipsum & vrbem Eliensem me conuerto, varia commendationis se offerunt argumenta: siue vetustatem spectes, vbi antiquissimum fere rotius regni coenobium fundatum est: siue vrbis priuilegium cogites, quae sedes est & cathedra Episcopalis: Ipsum vero solum si contemplari lubet, fertilitate omnes alias Angliae regiones adaequat, plaeras{que} superat: pascua succulento virent gramine, agri denso laetantur segete, prata aquis irrigua luxuriant, aquae piscium co∣piae abundant. Sed alia est vbertas nobilior, in qua mihi triumphare videtur, triginta Con∣sionatores simul floruerunt, qui ex hoc oppido solo natales suos deriuarent; quod de nulla aliae ciuitate, Londiuo excepto, affirmari posse credo. Ad Collegium ipsum venio, quod Decanum & octo Canonicos seu Praebendarios alit: Tres inde Archiepiscopos evocatos meminimus, sed plures Episcopos, D. Matthaeum Parkerum, & D.

THE SECOND BOOKE OF SAMVEL. Generall Questions touching the whole Booke. 1. Quest. Of the inscription of this Booke. 1.WHy the first booke of Samuel is so named, there may be eui∣dent reasons giuen; as both because the booke beginneth with the storie of Samuels natiuitie, as the Hebrewes vse to name the bookes of Scripture of the beginning; as also be∣cause it containeth Samuels acts principally; and besides, Samuel is held to haue beene the writer thereof, till that place where mention is made of his death. 2. But of this second booke there is greater question, why it should beare the name of Samuel: for neither are Samuels acts therein described, neither was he the penne-man thereof: but it was written by some of the Prophets, as by Nathan, and Gad, who supplyed the rest of the historie, that followeth Samuels death, or by some other of the Prophets: some thinke they were collected by Hezekiah; some by Ezra. 3. Now why yet this booke is intituled by Samuel, two reasons may be yeelded, both because it sheweth the accomplishment of Samuels prophesie concerning the king∣dome of Dauid, and the consummation and perfection of that argument, which be∣ganne with Samuels anointing: Genevens. as also for that this booke is but a continu∣ation of the former historie: and therefore the Hebrewes doe not diuide it from the former. Pellic. 4. But whereas Hierome thinketh in his Hebrewe traditions, that this booke of Samuel is like to be that, which is called the booke of the righteous, it hath no probabilitie: Mar. for we finde mention made of that booke, before this historie was either done, or written: Ios. 10.13. 2. Quest. Of the Argument of this Booke. 1. As the former booke containeth the historie of such things as were done vnder Samuel and Saul, so this setteth forth the acts of Dauid: and specially three things in generall are handled in this booke: the beginning, increase, and flourishing of Dauids raigne: then the manifold troubles, treasons, and oppositions against his kingdome: as also Dauids fall, and his rising againe, and reconciling vnto God. 2. And further, herein is obserued a notable difference betweene the raigne of Saul and of Dauid: for Sauls kingdome beganne with great glorie and renowne, but ended with shame: but contrariwise, Dauids kingdome had but small beginnings, yet encreased more and more. Borr. 3. In which respect Dauid was a liuely type of Christ, who found many enemies in the world, which sought to suppresse his kingdome in the infancy thereof: But his dominion preuailed, and from a corner of the earth, hath ouerspread all the world. Mar.
3. Quest. Of the profit and vtilitie of this booke. 1. This booke in generall affoardeth that profit, which all the Scriptures do yeild, which are profitable either for doctrine, to confirme the truth, and improoue error; or for manners, to correct vice, and to instruct in righteousns: as S. Paul sheweth, 2. Timoth. 3.16. 2. In this booke, as also in the former, are set forth vnto vs many graue and worthy examples of vertuous acts, which doe mooue much, and perswade vnto vertue, and doe longer remaine in memorie then bare precepts. 3. These histo∣ries serue to expound the writings and oracles of the Prophets, but especially the booke of the Psalmes, shewing the occasions whereupon many of those Psalmes were indied, which maketh much to the true vnderstanding of them. 4. Further, whereas these bookes are alleadged in the Gospel: the knowledge hereof is profita∣ble to vnderstand the precepts and sermons of our blessed Sauiour. 5. And lastly, the wisedome of God doth wonderfully appeare herein, in tempering the Scriptures to euery ones capacitie: for them which are seuere and austere, and are addicted to graue things and matters of rigour and authoritie, the fiue bookes of Moses were di∣gested: some men are delighted with a pleasant style, and flowing speech, such the Psalmes and Canticles specially are for: others doe more respect graue and wise sen∣tences, such as the Prouerbs of Salomon, and the booke of Ecclesiastes containe: Some are delighted in antiquaries, to them the holy histories are specially applyed: Others loue to heare of Gods iudgements and threatnings against sinne, who are to be sent to the Prophets. Mart. Quest. 4. How many yeares the historie of these two bookes of Samuel containe. 1. The former booke containeth not so many yeares, as Iosephus computation ac∣counteth: for hee giueth 38. yeares vnto Sauls raigne, whereof he raigned 18. yeares while Samuel yet liued, and 20. after: for adde vnto this 40. yeares of Eli, for so long hee iudged Israel, 1. Sam. 4.18. and 20. yeares at the least, for Samuel before Saul was anointed, as is gathered, 1. Sam. 7.2. see the question vpon that place: so should the whole summe of yeares make an 100. within two: which cannot stand with that account, 1. King. 6.1. which setteth downe 480. yeares to be runne in the 4. yeare of Salomon from the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt, vntill the building of the Temple. This number consisteth of these particulars: 40. yeares vnder Moses, 17. vnder Ioshuah, 299. vnder the Iudges, 44. vnder Dauid and Salomon: all which make but 400. yeares: there remaineth then but 80. yeares, whereof 40. were vnder Eli, 1. Sam. 4.18. then there are but 40. more to be diuided betweene Samuel and Saul, Act. 13.21. the first booke then containeth the historie of 80. yeares, and no more. 2. Then the computation which Pet. Martyr followeth, can not be true: that rec∣koneth 366. yeares from the departure of Israel out of Egypt vntill Eli, which can not be: from the beginning of Elies 40. yeare to the 4. yeare of Salomon, are yeares 124: whereof 40. were vnder Eli, 40. vnder Samuel and Saul, and 40. vnder Dauid, and 4. of Salomons raigne: which summe of 124. being put to the former summe of 366. will make in all 490. yeares: whereas the Scripture accounteth but 480. 1. King. 6.1. 3. The Historie then of this booke, is onely of 40. yeares vnder the raigne of Da∣uid, and certaine moneths: whereof he raigned 7. yeares, 6. moneths in Hebron, and 33. yeares in Ierusalem, 2. Sam. 5.5. Iun. CHAP. 1. Quest. 1. vers. 8. Whether the Amalekite lied in telling vnto Dauid, that hee slew Saul. 1. THe Hebrewes doe thinke, that this Amalekite lied vnto Dauid, and that all this cunning tale was but deuised, to insinuate himself vnto Dauid: but it seemes that
all was not fained, as that he tooke the crowne from Sauls head, before he was dead, beeing fallen to the ground: for he had the crowne there present to shew. 2. Some doe thinke that he spake the truth: and that when Saul had fallen vpon his sword, this Amalekite also at Sauls motion, fell vpon him: so Iosephus, Genevens. Bor. and the Chalde interpreter seemeth to be of the same opinion, reading v. 15. The sinne of thy slaughter be vpon thine owne head: but this is not like to be so: for these reasons: 1. Saul fell vpon his sword, 1. Sam. 31.5. but here he is said to leane vpon his speare, that is, thrust himselfe in with the speare. 2. Sauls armour-bearer saw Saul dead first, before he killed himselfe, 1. Sam. 31.6. but here the Amalekite telleth, that life was in him, when he stood ouer him to make an end of him. 3. It is not like, that Saul hauing runne vpon his sword, had memorie to aske him so many questions: first to call him to him, then to enquire who he was, and thirdly to make his request to him. 4. This young man expected a reward at Dauids hand, c. 4.10. and there∣fore it is probable that he lied: for a flatterer, and a lier, for the most part, goe toge∣ther. 3. Some of the Hebrewes thinke, that this young man was Doegs sonne, whom they suppose to be Sauls armour bearer, and that he before he killed himselfe, gaue Sauls crowne, and bracelet to his sonne: But this young man was an Amalekite, Doeg was an Edomite, therefore this supposall hath no ground. 4. Therefore the more probable opinion is, that this Amalekite lied vnto Dauid in the most part of his tale: yet herein he may be thought to speake as it fell out; that he was the first, that came vpon Saul beeing wounded to death, and seeing no hope of life in him, rifled him, and tooke away his crowne and bracelet. Osiand. It will be obiected, that if he had not killed Saul, Dauids sentence had beene vniust to put him to death. Ans. the confession of his owne mouth was sufficient to condemne him, es∣pecially seeing he bewraied a willing and resolued mind to lay his hands vpon the Lords annointed, whether he did it or no. 2. Quest. vers. 9. Of these words, Anguish is come vpon mee. 1. The word here vsed Shabatz, signifieth a garment made with eies or hoales like net-worke, it also is taken for greife or anguish:Diuerse rea∣dings. there are then three interpretations of this place. 1. Some vnderstand it of the horsemen, which were armed with such coates, that now had ouertaken Saul: as Vatab. readeth cornua, the band or troupe hath ouertaken me: but the words following shew, that Saul speaketh of himselfe, of some∣what that had befallen him: because he saith, my life is yet whole in mee. 2. Some re∣ferre it to Sauls garment, that hindered the entering of his speare: Iun. but the next verse sheweth, that Saul hauing runne vpon his speare or sword, was fallen to the ground, and not like to liue, by the Amalekites owne confession; therefore the wea∣pon had entered to the purpose: and againe, the word achaz, signifieth properly to hold, possesse, or apprehend, rather then to let or hinder. 3. Therefore the vsuall rea∣ding is to be preferred, Anguish hath caught hold of me, apprehended, or possessed me: sic C.S.L.A.P. cum caeter. the anguish of the wound and hole, which the speare had made. 3. Quest. v. 10. Of these words: Because I was sure he could not liue. 1. Some make this a reason of the words following; because he was sure he could not liue after he was fallen, he tooke the crowne, &c. B.G. that is,Diuerse rea∣dings. when the Amale∣kite had giuen him his deadly wound, and saw he could not liue, then he rifled him: but the Hebrew distinction, athnach, at that word after his fall, which is a perfect peri∣od, breaketh off this clause from the words following. 2. Therefore the meaning is, that when he sawe Saul to be fallen vpon his sword, and not like to liue, that the Amalekite was perswaded to make an hand of him, Vatab. and so the rest also doe ioyne it as a reason of the former words, I came vpon him, and slew him. Iun. C.S.L. &c.
3. Quest. vers. 12. Why Dauid mourned for Saul and Ionathan. 1. Dauid and his whole band wept and mourned together at the first, hearing of the lamentable ende of Saul and his sonnes, v. 12. but afterward Dauid by himselfe mourned more, when he vttred that song of lamentation. 2. Dauid mourned for Ionathan, as for his friend, and a good man; and for Saul, because though he were an enemie to Dauid, yet he was a valiant defender of the Israelites against their enemies, and whom Dauid had twice spared himselfe, and would not lay his hands vpon him, he mourneth to see how he came to this miserable end. 3. Many benefits came vnto Dauid by the death of Saul, as the ende of that cruell hatred and persecution, and the accomplishment of Gods promise towards Dauid; but Dauid in this his lamentation, looketh vnto the originall of this calamitie, the wrath of God, which was the cause of his mourning. 4. Dauid gaue God thankes, that had iudged his rebuke against Nabal, but here he reioyceth not for Sauls ouerthrowe; for the case was not alike, neither did God sustaine any dishonour, nor the commonwealth any losse by the death of Nabal, as both are hindred by the lamentable fall of Saul. Mar. 4. Quest. vers. 15. Whether Dauid did iustly in commanding the Amalekite to be put to death. 1. If this young man spake the truth, and made a true relation, he was worthily slaine; both in respect of Saul, who was the Lords anointed, and therefore he should not haue laid any hand vpon him: in respect of himselfe, he was a Proselite conuerted to the faith of Israel: and Dauids person also considered, who was now the lawfull Magistrate. 2. But if this were a deuised tale, which he telleth, his condemnation al∣so was iust, for he was iudged by his owne mouth: and hereunto agree the imperiall lawes:ff. ad leg. Cor∣nel. de falfis. falsum testimonium puniendum est poena talionis: a false testimonie must bee puni∣shed with the penaltie of retalion, or equalitie. 3. And whereas it will be obiected, that one ought not to die, but by the testimonie of two or three: that is to be vnder∣stood where there is no confession,Reconcil. but the fact is denied: but the voluntarie confessi∣on of the partie may suffice, without further witnesse: as Iosuah caused Achan to be stoned vpon his owne confession. 4. And further it must be considered, whether the confession be voluntarie, or forced and extorted by torment: for in this case the im∣periall lawes prouide,ff. de quaest. leg. 1. §. Div. Sever. confessionem reorum non habendam esse pro explorato crimine, nisi ap∣probatio alia instruat religionem cognoscentis: that the confession of the guiltie should not be held for a sufficient euidence of the crime, vnlesse some other proofe doe informe the conscience of the examiner. But this confession of the Amalekite was voluntarie. 5. Quest. vers. 17. How and when Dauid bad to teach the children of Israel to shoote, &c. 1. Some thinke that this verse hath no reference to Dauids song that followeth, but doe interpret it thus, that Dauid before he sung this song had exhorted and en∣couraged his tribe, to learne to shoote in the bow: Vatab. Borr. 2. Some by the bow, vnderstand this mournefull ditie, because it maketh mention of the bow of Ionathan, v. 22. so the Latin interpreter: vt docerēt filios Iudae planctum, to teach the children of Isra∣el to mourne. 3. But the third interpretation is the best, that these words are not pro∣perly any part of the song, but shew the end, why Dauid vttered it: to the intent, that this song beeing vsed and frequented in the tribe of Iudah, it should serue as an in∣citement and prouocation to the tribe of Iudah to learne to be skilfull in shooting: Iun. seeing that Saul and Ionathan were now ouercome by the archers and shooters among the Philistims. Borr. 4. By this example of Dauid, who in the middes of his mourning forgetteth not, what was necessarie for the good of the Commonwealth: we are taught, not to be so ouercome with griefe and pensiuenes, as to forget our du∣tie, and to neglect the meanes: Mart. as Iaakob saith to his sonnes, when they were readie to be famished, and looked not about to helpe themselues: Why gaze yee one vp∣on an other?Morall observ. Gen. 42.1. And when Moses cried vnto God, when the Egyptians pur∣sued them, not knowing which way to turne himselfe: the Lord saith vnto him, Why criest thou? speake to the children of Israel that they goe forward, Exod. 14.15. 5. Fur∣ther, in that Dauid taught them the vse of the bow, it is euident, that there is a lawfull vse of armour and weapons, and the seruants of God may defend themselues thereby,
against their enemies contrarie to the phantasticall opinion of the Anabts,Confut. Aginst the Anabaptists of the lawfull vse of weapons. who deny vnto the Christians all vse of weapons. Mart. 6. Quest. vers. 17. Of the booke of Iasher. 1. Concerning the name of this booke, Iasher signifieth, the iust or righteous: so called as some thinke of the persons whereof that booke intreated, namely of the acts of the Patriarchs and iust men. Some of the matter, because it contained a true narration of such things as were written therein. But it is more like to beare the name of Ieshurun, which is the name of Israel, Deut. 32.15. and the Prophet Isai calleth Isra∣el by the same name, c. 44. v. 2. which word also signifieth, the righteous people: this booke was called Iasher, because it was as a publike chronicle and record of Israel: Mus. in Iosu. 10. 2. But what booke this was, it is further questioned: the Chalde vnderstandeth the booke of the lawe, which was called Iashar, right, iust, because it prescribed what things were iust. Others take it for the booke of Genesis, which con∣taineth an historie of the acts of the righteous fathers. Vatab. But how could Dauids song be recorded in that booke made so long before? Others thinke it was some booke made by Nathan or Gad, wherein this song was written: but there was a book called Iashur long before their time, Iosh. 10.13. Therefore it is more probable, that this booke of Iasher, was a generall Chronicle of the acts of that nation, which was continued from time to time by the Prophets, which is now wanting, as many such historicall bookes are. Iun. These Chronicles were laid vp in the Temple, as Iosephus writeth, lib. 5. c. 1. Many such historicall writings are mentioned in bookes of the Kings and Chronicles composed by the Prophets, Nathan, Gad, Iddo, Semaias, A∣chias the Silonite, which are now not to be found. It seemeth that after Ezra had di∣gested the holy Scriptures into order, that these bookes were not thought so necessa∣rie: the Lord hath yet preserued for the vse and benefit of his Church, so much as he seeth to be sufficient for the instruction of the people in the knowledge of his will, and toward the attaining of euerlasting life. Andr. Mus. 3. But this is no argument to prooue any imperfection or defect in the Scriptures, as though they contained not all things necessarie to saluation: because some bookes of the Canonicall Scripture are now wanting, as the Romanists vsually obiect.Bellar. de verb. dei. c. 4.Contr. Of the sufficiencie of the Scriptures. Lib. 36. de civ. dei. c. 38. Answ. . Augustine giueth this reason, why some of those bookes are now lost: because they did write some things, tanquam homines historica diligentia, as men by an historicall diligence: other things, tanquam Prophetae inspiratione diuina: as Prophets by diuine inspiration: he seemeh to thinke that those bookes, which are not now extant, were no part of the canonicall Scripture: but this exception may be made to this an∣swer, that many of our Sauiours sermons and sayings, are also now wanting, Ioh. 20.30. which all if they were now extant, should as well be canonicall, as those which are written. 2. We say then, that though it be graunted, that those bookes were pro∣pheticall, and consequently canonicall; yet that par of the Scriptures notwithstan∣ding is sufficient which remaineth: for most of those bookes belonged vnto matter of historie, rather then of doctrine, and therefore the Lord thought them not to be so necessarie▪ neither in them was contained any other forme of religion or rule of do∣ctrine, then is expessed in the Scriptures; which now we haue: notwithstanding then the want of these booke, the Scriptures are sufficient o make the man of God perfect to all good workes, 2. Tim. 3.16. 7. Quest. vers. 19. Of Dauids Epitaph or funrall song. 1. It hath beene an auncient custom both among the heathen, and the people of God, to vse funerall orations in commendation of the dead: Ieremias writ his lamen∣tations ouer Ierusalem  the destruction thereof, and for the vntimely death of Iosi∣as: Hierome seemeth to haue beene much exercised in writing of Epitaphs. This vse was taken vp among the Greekes to set forth the praises not onely of men, but of women departed: as the funerall oration of Aspasi in Plato. Suetonius writeth,In Platon. Me∣nexen. that Iulius Caesar did celebrate the publike commendations of his Grand-mother Iulia. Martyr.
2.  to vse funerall orations, commendations, and memorialls of the dead, is not vnlawfull, so that these rules be therein obserued. 1. That it be done without adulation or flatterie, that such be not commended and extolled for their vertues, which were most vile and vicious men. 2. That no partialitie be shewed, in commen∣ding one before an other, in setting forth the praise of a rich man, or of a kinsman, and not of a poore man, or one not allyed, they beeing all of like desert; which is the greatest exception that can be taken to funerall sermons, in mine opinion: when as a man that hath ten shillings bequeathed him for a funerall sermon, will commend such an one, and an other of as good example of life, wanteth that solemnitie. 3. It must be done without superstition; they must not imagine, that the dead receiue any solace, benefit, or releefe, by such funerall solemnities: but such commendations, and set∣ting forth of the praise of the dead, must altogether redound, and be referred to the praise of God, and to the vse, exhortation, and comfort of the liuing. 4. It is then a fond collection of Bellarmine,Lib. 1. de pur∣gat. cap. 3. that this was done ad invandas animas defunctorum, to releeue the soules of the dead: for, 1. Saul died in despaire, and so in the state of finall impenitencie: and such in their owne doctrine are not to be prayed for. 2. The ende of this song is expressed: it was to be sung, to teach them to shoote, to stirre them vp to learne feats of warre, vers. 17. it was then for the benefit of the liuing, not for the dead. 3. Dauid tooke it to belong vnto him to make this lamentable epitaph vpon Saul and Ionathan; both in respect of his alliance, beeing Sauls sonne in lawe, and Iona∣than his deere friend; as also because he was the successor in the kingdome: and be∣sides, Dauid was the cheife and captaine of this companie, to whom this newes was brought: and he beeing indued with a propheticall spirit, was exercised in making such heauenly songs. Mar. 8. Quest. v. 20. How Dauid saith, Tell it not in Gath, seeing it was there knowne alreadie. 1. Here the Imparatiue moode is taken for the Optatiue▪ afer the patheticall manner of those which mourne, and expresse their griefe. Bor. 2. There is a difference betweene the will and desire of man, and his deliberation and election, betweene wishing and choosing: for a man may many times in his vhement affection wish for such things, which cannot be: but his election is onely set vpon those thing which are possible, and likely to be obtained: so that Dauid rather detesteth this which was alreadie done, then forbiddeth it to be done. Mar. 9. Quest. vers. 21. Of the true reading thereof. 1. In the first part of the verse, the vsuall reading is, or fields of offerings, that is, from henceforth beare ye no fui, whereof they should bring oblation to the Lord; the word trumah signifieth eleuations, because they vsed to lift or heane-vp their offe∣rings before the Lord: the Sept. read agri, , the field of first fruits: but Iun. one∣ly referreth it vnto the hills; ô agri editi, O yee high fields▪ but the first interpretation better agreeth with the former words, vpon you be neither de nor raine▪ and the con∣iunction copulatiue in the latter reading is omitted, vshedee, and fields. 2. In the lat∣ter part of the verse, the common reading is, the sheild of Saul was st downe, as though he had not beene anointed with oyle: V.P.B.G.S.L. Iunius interpreteth thus, by the con∣sumption or destruction of him, that was anointed with oyle: th word is beli, which both signifieth not, and a consumption: but the first reading is ftte, according vnto the most vsuall signification of the word. 3. Some referre the anointing to the sheild of Saul, because they vsed to anoint their sheilds before battell: Vatab. Spt. but wih better sense is it applyed to Saul, that he was ouerthrowne, as any ther common souldier, as though he had not beene the Lords anointed. Mar. Osan▪ 10. Quest. vers. 21. Whether Dauids curse vpn the mountaines of Gilbo tooke effect: Vpon you be no dewe. 1. Some thinke that this is onely a figurtiue speech, whereby the Prophet Dauid by a kind of Prosopopeia, that is, a faigning of  person to expesse his griefe, imagineth as though the verie heauens and earth had a kind of sense and feeling of this calami∣tie,
the one withholding the dewe and raine, the other the fruits and encrease there∣of. Borr. 2. Some other thinke that Dauid, to shew the detestation of the very place, where this slaughter was committed, doth thus speake by way of wishing, that the mountaines of Gilboa, might be stricken with brrennesse. Pellic. 3. Iunius thinketh that it is an hyperbolicall imprecation in cursing the place, as Iob doth the time of his natiuitie, Iob. 3. 4. Osiander saith it is a figuratiue speach. 5. But I rather thinke that this is a propheticall curse, and tooke effect accordingly, and say with Pet. Mart. om∣nino voluit aeternum extare monumentum tanti mali: he would haue an eternall monument be extant of so great calamitie: euen as our Sauiour cursed the fig-tree in the Gospel: for it is not to be thought, that this speech of the Prophet was in vaine. Quest. 11. Of the order and parts of Dauids mourn∣full song. It consisteth of two parts. 1. The proposition, containing the summe of the whole song, and the cause of Dauids mourning, which is the ouerthrow of Saul with his sonnes, v. 19. which beeing as the foot or ground of this mournfull dirtie, is againe repeated, v. 25. and it concludeth the sonet, v. 26. 2. The second part is the amplifica∣tion of this calamitie, which is two waies set forth: first by a patheticall imprecation, consisting of a double vow or request: that the newes might goe no further, if it be possible, v. 20. and laying a curse vpon the very place, v. 21. secondly, by an euident declaration of the greatnesse of this losse: which is described, 1. by the excellencie of their persons, expressed by their acts and vertues, v. 22. their mutuall affection one to the other, ad their valour compared in swiftnesse to Eagles, in strength to Lions. 2. by the effects, they enriched and adorned their subiects, 24. 3. by shewing Iona∣thans ardent loue towards himselfe, he also bewailed his owne priuate losse: vers. 26. Iun. Quest. 12. vers. 23. Vpon these words: In their death they were not deuided or separated. 1. Hereby Dauid purgeth Ionathan, who was suspected, as though he had con∣spired with Dauid agains Saul: Dauid leareth him of this suspition, seeing Iona∣than shewed himselfe so louing and faitfull to Sal, that as he liued, so he died with him: Mart. 2. Though Saul sometime conceiued displeasure against Ionathan, yet that shewed his loue rather toward him, because he was iealous of Dauid for Iona∣thans sake, fearing least he should depriue his sonne of the succession of the kingdom. Pellic. 3. Further, Dauid maketh mntion of this vniting and coniunction of Saul and Ionathan in their death, to set forth the greatnesse of this calamitie, whereby two such valiant men were together ouerthrowne, whereas the fall of one excellent man a∣lone is grieuous, and much to be lamented, Mart. 4. Herein we haue an example of perfit and true freindship, which is not broken off by death: aduersitie, trouble, and perill of death, is a true touchstone of freindship: Ionathan was so faithfull in his loue toward his father, that he would not leaue him in death. Borr. Quest. 13. vers. 26. Of the great loue betweene Ionathan and Dauid. 1. Some doe vnderstand these words, thy loue to mee was wonderfull, passing the loue f woman, of Dauids loue toward Ionathan, that Dauid loued him beee, then he did his owne wiues: so the Chald. Vatab. Pellic. Osiand. 2. But it is beter vnderstood of Ionathans ardent affection toward Dauid, which surpassed the loue of women: Iun. Mart. and this to be the sense, the former words doe shew, My brother Ionathan, ve∣rie kind hast, thou beene vnto mee: hee spketh of the kindnesse of Ionathan toward him, comparing his owne loue, to the loe of a brother, but the lou of Ionathan to the loue of women: Iuniu. for here in the eminencie of Ionathans loue appeared, that he first beganne, to loue Dauid: c. 18.. The soule of Ionathan was knit to the soule of Da∣uid: then he continued his doe or both with his labrs great displeasure, and to the hin∣derance of his succession in the kingdome,  The loue of women some doe vnder∣stand passiuly, nor that loue which men bere toward them, Osiand. Pellic. but it is ra∣ther taken actiely, for that loue which omen doe shew toward their husband, Vatab. or toward their children, as the Latine translator hee interprtth. 4. Here
we may see, that although we must loue euery man, as our brother, yet it standeth with religion to shewe more ardent affection toward some, then toward others: as our blessed Sauiour loued Iohn more then the rest of the Apostles. Osiand. Quest. 14. vers. 26. Of Dauids commendation of Saul. 1. Where Dauid saith, how are the weapons of warre destroied, thereby vnderstan∣ding Saul and Ionathan, who were warlike and valiant men: hee commendeth not Saul for his pietie, or any spirituall grace, whereof he was destitute, but for his valour and fortitude: for these beeing the gifts of God, and so good in themselues, may be commended euen in the wicked: Mart. 2. In that Dauid passeth ouer Sauls faults in silence, and onely toucheth his vertues, it teacheth vs to hate the errours and infimities of others, so farre as with a good conscience we may: Osiand. 3. This was an ho∣nourable and worthie commendation of Saul, both beeing from the mouth of so ex∣cellent a man as Dauid was, and beside, one vnto whom Saul had alwaies beene a pro∣fessed enemie. And the testimonie and commendation of an enemie is much to be re∣garded. Caesar, when he saw Pompey his enemies head, is said to haue wept: and Hannibal in that great slaughter of the Romans at Cannas, sought diligently for the bodie of Paulus Aemileus the Romane Captaine there slaine, to haue giuen it honou∣rable buriall. But Dauids affection toward his enemie farre exceedeth them, who gi∣ueth such an honourable testimonie and commendation of him: Mar. Borr. 4. Nei∣ther was this a poeticall and fained lamentation for Saul: for the people of Israel ve∣rily and in deed, had receiued a great blow by Sauls death: but that by Gods mercie, this losse was restored in Dauid: Osiand. 5. It were much to be wished, that all wan∣ton and lasciuious songs were laid downe in these daies: and that youth would exer∣cise themselues in such sonnets as this of Dauid, which doe set forth the worthie acts and exploits of such as haue defended their countrie, and protected the Church of God. Pellic. CHAP. 2. 1. Quest. vers. 1. How and to what end Dauid asketh counsell of God. 1. IOsephus thinketh, that Dauid enquired of God by some Prophet: as Gad and Nathan were with him. But it is like rather, that he consulted by the preist, namly Abiathar, who had the Ephod and followed Dauid: 1. Sam. 23.9. where Dauid might vse the ordinarie meanes, he would not runne vnto extraordinarie: Mar. Borr. Pellic. 2. Dauid, though he had a promise of the kingdome, yet would not take pos∣sion thereof, though Saul were dead, without direction from God: as Iaacob did not make an escape from Laban, before he was admonished by the Lord in a dreame: which teacheth vs, not to enterprise, or take any thing in hand, without the warrant of Gods word, and prayer. Mar. 3. Here appeareth the vnlike and farre different course, which Saul and Dauid followed: for he resorted vnto Witches, but Dauid took his direction from God. Borr. 2. Quest. vers. 1. Why Dauid is directed to goe vnto Hebron. 1. This Citie was famous in diuerse respects: both for the antiquitie, it was built seauen yeares before Zoan in Egypt, Numb. 13. thither also came Ioshua and Caleb, when they were sent as spies to search the land: it was one of the Cities of refuge, which belonged vnto the Leuites: but it was most of all honoured, because the fa∣mous Patriarks Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, were there buried, to whom the promises concerning the land of Canan were made, and to Iacob especially concerning the kingdome to be established in Iudah: it wa therefore very fit, that in that place Da∣vid should be initiated king: Mar. 2. Though Ziklag also belonged vnto Iudah, yet Dauid thought that to be an vnfit place, both because it was in the vtmost borders
of Iudah, and he held it now by the gift and graunt of the King of the Philistims: therefore he desireth to remooue to some other Citie of Iudah, more inward in the countrie, Pellic. 3. He taketh with him his two wiues, that as they had beene his com∣panions in his troubles, so they should partake with him in his happie estate: Bor. here∣in Dauid also was a type of Christ, who maketh them partakers of his glorie with him, which did follow him in his afflictions: as he saith to his Apostles, Yee are they, which haue continued with mee in my tentations, therefore I appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my Father hath appointed vnto mee, Luk. 22.28.29. 3. Qest. vers. 4. Why Dauid is againe annoin∣ted King. 1. This was done both for Dauids further confirmation, that by this second an∣nointing he might be strengthened, in the vndoubted expectation of the kingdome: for such is our weakenesse, that it needeth to be continually supported. Osiand. 2. This also was an other reason thereof, that as by the first annointing by Samuel, Gods electing of Dauid was made manifest, so by this second anointing by the men of Iu∣dah, their consent and approbation might be had. Borr. 3. Herein also Dauid was a type of Christ, whose spirituall anointing to be our Messiah, was often testified, and declared vnto the Church for our further confirmation: as by the predictions of the old Prophets, by the pointing out of Iohn, by Gods own voice from heauen, by di∣uerse signes and miracles. Mar. 4. Quest. vers. 4. Whether the men of Iudah were authors of Schisme in diuiding themselues from Israel. 1. Though they are said to be the men of Iudah, yet there ioyned with them di∣uerse out of the other tribes of Israel, which vnderstood that it was the will of God that Dauid should be King: as appeareth, 1. Chron. 12. to v. 22. yet are they called the men of Iudah, because the most and the chiefe were of that tribe: Mar. 2. Though the tribe of Iudah apart from other tribes annointed Dauid King, yet they therein, as dissenting from all Israel beside, did not make any rent, or schisme: for they were warranted herein,Controv. Genrall Coū∣cills in matters of religion, not alwaies to be staied for. both in generall by the promise of God made concerning the preeminence of that tribe, and in particular by the manifest declaration of Gods will, touching the election of Dauid to be king. 3. By this the Church of God lear∣neth, that, when they haue a manifest warrant out of Gods word, and so are certaine of Gods will, they are not to stay, or expect the calling together of synods or coun∣cells, but incontinently to reforme religion, and embrace the truth. Mar. 5. Quest. vers. 5. Of Dauids kind message to the men of Iabesh Gilead. 1. Some thinke, that this fact of the men of Iabesh Gilead was discommended vnto Dauid, as beeing too much addicted vnto his professed enemie: Mar. but it seemeth rather that Dauid made enquirie after the bodies of Saul, and his sonnes, to haue be∣stowed vpon them honourable buriall, and by that occasion hee vnderstood of this thankefull seruice, which the men of Iabesh Gilead had done: Iun. 2. Dauid in com∣mending this dutifull regard in them of Saul, sheweth himselfe farre vnlike to the ex∣amples of those heathen Captaines and commanders Sylla, Marius, Antonius, Octa∣vius, who sought reuenge vpon those, who had taken part against them. Mar. 3. Da∣uid wisheth that God would shew againe mercie and truth vnto them: Gods mercie and goodnesse is seen in promising reward vnto our faithfull seruice, and his truth and fidelitie in performing: there is then no desert at Gods hands, but he crowneth and rewardeth in mercie the faithfulnesse of his seruants. Borr. 4. Dauid also promiseth for his part, to recompence their kindnesse shewed toward their Master:Controv. We deserue not at Gods hand, at mans we may. then this their louing affection toward their King, deserued a reward at mans hand: and Da∣uid succeeding in the kingdome, tooke it to belong vnto him, to see such good sub∣iects recompenced. At Gods hand they deserued not; but at mans hand a good turne or blessing may deserue. Thus Dauid doth beginne his kingdome, with princely mu∣nificence and liberalitie, which winneth the hearts of subiects: who, as they are in Gods stead here in earth, so herein they doe represent and imitate that great King, in
mercie and bountie. Borr. 5. Thus Dauid sheweth himselfe a patterne of a good King, who is appointed as for the punishment of the wicked, so for the praise and reward of weldoers: as before he put to death the Amalekite for confessing he had killed Saul, so now hee promiseth reward to the Iabeshites, for their kindnesse toward him. O∣siand. 6. Quest. vers. 8. Of Abners making of Ishbosheth King. 1. Abner offended three waies in making Ishbosheth King. 1. Because he did it of an ambitious mind: he set vp one that was simple, and of meane parts to beare the name of a King, but Abner ruled all: as Abner, not Ishbosheth is said to haue made all his power for the house of Saul: c. 3.6. And that Ishbosheth was but a meane man, and of a cowardly nature appeareth: for he went not to battle with Saul, as beeing vnfit and vnapt thereunto: wherein his age can yeild him no excuse, he beeing now 40. yeares old: Borr. 2. Abner did herein against his conscience, beeing not ig∣norant, that God had appointed Dauid to be King, as he himselfe confesseth, c. 3.18. 3. A third fault of his was, that hee maketh Ishbosheth King, whereas Mephibo∣seth the sonne of Ionathan the eldest sonne of Saul, was now liuing: Mart. 7. Quest. Why Abner brought Ishbosheth to Mahanaim. 1. Some translate this word appellatiuely, for the Host, or Campe: as L.S.A.P. but it is rather the name of a place on the other side of Iordan, so first called by Ia∣cob, because there he met the Lords host. Gen. 32. so C. Vat. Iun. 2. The cause why he fled with Ishbosheth to Mahanaim, was as Iosephus thinketh, that he might be safe from the Philistims, whose countrie was on this side of Iordan bordering vpon the Sea: but beside this, two other reasons may be yeelded thereof: because Abner sus∣pected, least the men of Iabesh Gilead, whom Dauid had entreated so kindly should fall away from Ishbosheth; and therefore he thought it the best course, that the king should reside there, to retaine and continue their affections: as also Mahanaim being in the Land of Bashan, a fruitful and fertile countrie, was in that behalfe verie fit to be the Kings Citie. Mar. 3. That part of Israel is also described, ouer the which Ishbo∣sheth raigned: Gilead is taken for all the countrie beyond Iordan, a part beeing ta∣ken for the whole; the countrie of Ashur was the furthest toward the North: Iezrahel containeth the middle region of Ishachar, Zebulun, and Nephtali: these with Ephra∣im and Beniamin did inhabit in al the breadth of the land between Iordan and the sea: so in a manner it containeth a description of all Israel on each side of Iordan, Iudah excepted. Iun. 8. Quest. vers. 11. Whether Ishbosheth raigned onely two yeares ouer Israel. Whereas Ishbosheth is said to haue raigned two yeares ouer Israel; and Dauid seauen yeares in Hebron, before he obtained the kingdome ouer all Israel, it seemeth that the kingdome of Israel lay vacant 5. yeares: to reconcile these places, and to re∣mooue this doubt,Reconcil. 1. Some thinke that this interregnum or vacancie of the kingdome for fiue yeares followed immediately after Sauls death, before Ishbosheth beganne to raigne. Osiand. But it is not like that they which tooke part with Dauid, would suffer the house of Saul all that while to make a way for the kingdome: and it seemeth by the order of the storie set downe, v. 7.8. that as soone as Dauid had beene anoynted King by the men of Iudah, Abner tooke Ishbosheth, and made him King ouer Isra∣el. Iosephus also thinketh that this was done presently after Sauls death. 2. Some thinke that these fiue yeares followed after Ishbosheths death. Pellic. Borr. But this is more vnlike then the other, that the Israelites hauing no head, beeing well encli∣ned to Dauid, while Ishbosheth liued, would withhold their consent from Dauid fiue yeares after his death. 3. Therefore the best exposition is, not that Ishbosheth raig∣ned onely two yeares in all: but that he had raigned two yeares vntill this time, when Abner went out against Ioab, as it followeth v. 12. R. Levi. Mart. Iun. As Saul is said to haue raigned two yeares ouer Israel, 1. Sam. 13.1. not simply, but after a sort, as law∣full King he raigned no longer.
Quest. 9. v. 12. Why Dauid did not seeke by force of armes to recouer the kingdome. 1. Dauid remembred the oath which he had made to Saul, at that time, when he had cut off the lap of his garment in the caue, that he would not destroie the seed of Saul, nor abolish his name: 1. Sam. 24.22. and therefore he would not attempt any violence against Sauls house. Mar. . This skirmish was begunne by Abner: who, as Iosephus writeth, was angrie with the tribe of Iudah, for making Dauid King, and therefore seeketh to be reuenged of them. 3. Yet Dauid would not for his othes sake, goe against his brethren himselfe, but sendeth Ioab, who also doth protract the time, and deferreth to fight, not for that he was the weaker, but it is most like he did it by Dauids direction, to shew how vnwilling he was to haue any warre with them. Mar. Quest. 10. v. 14. Of Abners words to Ioab, Let the young men arise, and play before vs. 1. His meaning was, that they should come forth and trie their valure one in hew∣ing and cutting an other, and so shew them a bloodie play: Vatab. Iun. 2. This was like to the sword plaies among the Romanes,Of the vnlaw∣fulnesse of sword-playes. when cruell spectacles were exhibited on each side, in the shedding of humane blood, as L. Florus maketh mention how Iunius Brutus did exhibite in the funerall of his father 22. couples of sword players: which he intended, to expiate the ghosts of the dead, but it was rather to please the deuill. This kind of sauage and beastly spectacles Theodosius the Emperour abhorred, and would not behold them: yea Demonax among the Athenians, when the people cōsulted about the shewing of these sword plaies, said, that they must first break down the altar of Mercie, because such were so cruell and mercilesse sights. 3. This kind of sword plaie, and bloodie spectacle, was farre worse, then the monomachie, or single cumbate, when one to one, did fight hand to hand for the victorie: Mar. which was vnlawfull, as hath beene shewed before in part, vpon the 16. chap. of 1. of Samuel, and now commeth further to be declared. Quest. 11. v. 15. Of the setting forth twelue of Beniamin a∣gainst twelue of Dauids seruants. 1. It is simply vnlawfull, to set one to one, or a certaine number of men against the like number, to trie it by dint of sword, and shedding of blood, as the Romans & Albanes, did put the triall of their gouernement vpon the aduenture of the three Ho∣ratij on the one side, and the three Curiatij on the other. 1. It is a tempting of God, when as they put all vpon such an hazard, there beeing other meanes beside for the triall of matters. 2. They put their confidence in the arme of flesh trusting vnto their owne strength▪ 3. Such cumbates are against charitie, one seeking an others life. 4. And against faith all such actions are, hauing no warrant in the word. 2. Diuerse causes may be pretended of such monomachies, and single cumbates: which are not yet sufficient to iustifie them or make them lawfull: first, they alleadge, that when it can not otherwise be knowen to whom the right belongeth in the trialls of title, and in other criminall causes, who is guiltie, who innocent, that in such doubt∣full case, the matter may be decided, by such a cumbate. Contra. 1. There are fowre waies prescribed in Scripture, whereby to sift out the truth: by testimonie of wit∣nes, by euidence of writing, Ierem. 32.10. by confession, Iosh. 7. Achan acknowled∣ged his offence: or by the oath of the partie, Exod. 22.11. if by none of these meanes the truth can come to light, the partie accused is to be freed, and the matter left vnto the iudgement of God. 2. This were to tempt God, to shew a miracle in giuing the victorie vnto the innocent: as sometime they vsed to walke vpon an boat yron bare∣foot, or to put their hand into scalding water for the triall of their innocencie. 3. And this is an vncertaine way to trie out the truth: for oftentimes it falleth out, that in such fights the innocent partie is slaine. Secondly, an other cause is to trie their manhood, and make ostentation of their v∣lou, as in publike turnaments, and iustings. But, though such exercises are tolerable, which are kept without danger of life, as the running at tilt, and such like, yet the life of man is more precious in the sight of God, then for publike ostentatiō to be brought
into apparant perill: and beside, such challenges are against charity, because certainly the one of them dieth. Whether a Christian bee∣ing challenged into the field hand to hand ought to take itThirdly, it will be obiected, that when a man is challenged into the field, a Chri∣stian may take the challenge, because otherwise it will redound to his great disho∣nour. Contra. But a mans life ought to be dearer vnto him, then his honour or fame: and therefore he ought not to hazard the more pncipal, to preserue the lesse: beside, the profession of a Christian, which is to suffer wrong, and not to seek reuenge, is here∣by disgraced, which euery man ought more carefully to preserue from blot, then his owne name. Fourthly, some thinke, that when a battell is pitched, it were better that a few men should trie it for the whole campe, rather then there should be a generall effusion of blood. Contra. If the cause of such warre be iust (as without a iust cause no warre ought to be enterprised) this were to betray the goodnes of the cause, in committing such a triall. And further, the meanes should be neglected, which God offreth, which is by a iust battell, to decide the cause. Fiftly, if the Magistrate beeing corrupt, doe giue sentence against the Innocent to die, vnlesse he will trie it by the sword with his aduersarie, in this case also some giue allowance to such cumbates. Contra. The innocent is rather with patience to abide e∣uen the hardest sentence of the vniust Magistrate, then to commit sinne in the killing of an other: for we ought rather to die, then sinne. 3. It will now on the other side be obiected, 1. That seeing warre is lawfull, and these manomachies are but a kind of warre, they are as lawfull. 2. Lots were lawfull, but these singular cumbates are but a kind of lot. 3. Dauids cumbate with Goliah was lawfull. Contra. 1. There is great difference betweene warre, and a monomachie, or sole fight: because there the battell is ioyned together by the strength and helpe of many, one companie seconding another: but here the aduenture lieth vpon a few: and in Scripture we haue presidents of the one, but not of the other. 2. In the casting of lots there followeth no slaughter, as in this case, therefore they are vnlike: for though Ionas were taken by lot, yet he was cast ouer board by his owne direction hauing a propheticall instinct. 3. The like is to be answered concerning Dauid, that he tooke that enterprise in hand by the extraordinarie motion of Gods spirit. 4. Yet there is a kind of Monomachie that is commendable in a Christian, which is the spirituall and internall cumbate betweene the spirit and the flesh: whereof the Apostle speaketh, I see an other law in my members, rebelling against the law of my minde: Rom. 7.22. Mar. 12. Quest. v. 17. Who they were which were slaine in this skirmish. 1. The 24. which were chosen, on each side twelue, were all slaine, they one kil∣led an other, there was not one left: which may seeme the more strange, that euery one of them, assaulted one another in such sort, as that all of them fell downe woun∣ded: which sheweth with what egernes of mind this fight was prosecuted. 2. But af∣terward, these champions beeing thus slaine, the other armies ioyned, and Abners men were put to the worse: Ioseph. Quest. 13. v. 16. Of the name of the place, called chelcath hazzurim. 1. Some read, the place was called: S.L.B.G. but in the originall it is, hee called, that is, euery one, as Iun. or he which first gaue the name: Vatab. 2. As for the name, some giue the interpretation of it; as the field or portion of the strong: Iun. Lat. or the part of the lyers in waite: Sep. or the inheritance of the killing of the strong. C. or the por∣tion or field of the sword points: for tzur signifieth both strong, and the point of a sword: and chelkah is taken for the part or portion of a field, Gen. 33.19. Iun. 3. But seing it is the proper name of a place, the originall name is better retained: euery one called it, chelkath hazzurim: so read Mont. Pag. B.G. 3. This name then was taken vp, as a monument, not of true fortitude, but of cruell rage shewed in that place. Mar.
14. Quest. v. 18. Of Asahels swiftnesse of foote. 1. This Asahel was brother vnto Ioab, and Abishai, who were all in this battell, and he is numbred among Dauids Worthies, 1. Chron. 11. Mar. he is said to be swift as a roe, by a kind of hyperbolicall speech: as Saul and Ionathan are said to be swifter then Eagles, chap. 1.23. Iosephus writeth he was so swift, that he did not onely con∣tend with men, but with horse in running. 2. Here in Asahel we see that saying of the Preacher verefied, That the race is not to the swift, nor the battell to the strong:Eccl. 9.11. the swiftnes of Asahel, to the which he trusted too much, was the cause of his ruine: which teacheth, that we ought not to be too confident vpon our strength, or any other gift,No man is to trust in his strength or swiftnesse or a∣ny other inter∣nall or external gift. either inward, or outward. Iosias a good Prince, trusting to his strength, and going against Pharaoh, which he needed not to haue done, was slaine in the battell. Cicero his eloquence was the cause of his confusion. Milo (so renowned for his strength,) ha∣uing rent an oake with his armes, was caught in the cleft, the tree returning againe to his place, and was there left to be a prey to the wild beasts. Mart. 15. Quest. v. 21. Of these words, Take thee one of the young men. 1. Some thinke that Abner meaneth, if Asahel were afraid to returne alone, that he should take any one of the young men to beare him companie: and if he were a∣fraid of him, he should take away from him his weapons: Chimh. whom Vatablus fol∣loweth. 2. Iosephus thinketh, that he couenanteth with Asahel, so that he would de∣part, and let him alone, that he should take any young mans armour in the host, and so goe his way. 3. But the meaning is thus rather; that he would haue him trie his manhood, with any other souldier of the host, and not with him, least he might after repent him: Mart. and so he giueth him leaue to encounter with any of his souldiers, to slay him, and take his spoyle: wherein the fashion and guise of captaines is seene in these daies, that make small account of the life of their common souldiers. Osiand. 16. Quest. v. 23. Of the death of Asahel. 1. Abner assaid by all meanes to perswade Asahel to desist, and leaue off to follow him: for he was afraid of Ioab Asahels brother, if he should kill Asahel, least this might be an hindrance vnto the peace, which he hoped to make with Ioab: Mar. or it might come into his mind, as afterward, chap. 3.18. that the kingdome should be e∣stablished in Dauid, and that Ioab should be a great man with him: and therefore he was loath to offend him. Borr. 2. And by this ruine of Asahel, we see it pleaseth not God, that euen an enemie, especially offering peace and reconciliation, should be too eagerly pursued: as that wise saying of the elder Scipio is remembred;Viam hosti fu∣gienti munien∣dam. that a way is to be de euen to an enemie, when he flieth. Borrh. 17. Quest. v. 26. Of Abners perswasion to Ioab to giue ouer. The Sunne beeing now set, and so by Gods prouidence the opportunitie of further prosecuting the battell beeing cut off: and beside Abner and his men standing vpon their gard, both flocking together on an heape, and taking the aduantage of the place vpon an hill: Iun. then Abner beganne to mooue Ioab to cease pursuing them, and thereunto he vseth three reasons. The first is from humanitie, that he should not suffer the sword to deuoure alwaies: for warre beeing one of those things, which is not desired for it selfe, but as it tendeth to peace, it must be vsed in measure: such things as are to be desired for themselues, can not be too much followed, as vertue, honestie; but those things which are desired and sought to some other ende, must be limited and confined. The second is, that euen such victories, are not without losse, and griefe, euen vnto those that haue the better: as the Israelites when they did fight against Beniamin, though they ouercame them at the length, yet they were twice foyled before, Iudg. 20. Mart. Beside, saying, it will be bitternes in the ende, he sheweth, that his souldiers beeing in despaire of victorie, if they were still vrged and pursued,
might in the bitternesse of their heart be prouoked, and so seeke to reuenge them∣selues: as a beare rageth, beeing robbed of her whelps. Pellic. His third reason is from their affinitie, because they were brethren. The Romane Chronicles make mention, that in the battell betweene Sylla, and Cnna, and Marius, one brother chanced to kill an other; and after he perceiued, that he was his brother, he drew out his sword, and killed himselfe. It is therefore a forceable perswasion vnto peace, because they are brethren. Mart. 18. Quest. v. 27. Of Ioabs answer to Abner. 1. Ioab refuseth not to be aduertised by his enemie, and to heare reason from him: for the truth is to be receiued at whosoeuers hand. Mar. 2. Ioab knowing it was Da∣uids minde rather to obtaine the kingdome by peaceable meanes, then by crueltie and bloodshed, was content to giue ouer the battell vpon this occasion, for this time: for the warre continued still after this, betweene the house of Dauid, and the house of Saul. Borr. Mar. 3. Ioab laieth the fault vpon Abner, protesting in the name of God, that if Abner had not first prouoked them to battell, they had giuen ouer in the mor∣ning, when no assault was yet made. Mar. Iun. Osiand. 19. Quest. v. 29. Of Bithron, through the which Abner passed. 1. Some read Bethoron, as the Latine translatour: Pellic. Borr. Bish. but Bethoron the vpper, and Bethoron the neather, were both on this side of Iordan: this was beyond Iordan. Borr. 2. The most read Bithron, making it a proper name: Pag. Montan. Vatab. Genev. but we doe not read, that all that countrey beyond Iordan, was called by one peculiar and proper name. 3. I rather condescend to Iunius, that it is here rather an appellatiue, then a proper name, and signifieth, the separate or diuided countrey: for so Bether, signifieth separation: as Cant. 2.17. the mountaines of Bether, that is, of sepa∣ration: so the Septuag. read not much differing, , the whole plaine: the meaning then is, that Abner and his men went through all the countrey on the o∣ther side of Iordan, which was diuided from the rest of Israel by the riuer Iordan, till he came to Mahanaim, where Ishbosheth was. 29. Quest. v. 31. Of the lawfulnesse of warre. 1. In that Ioab by Dauids authoritie did encounter with Abner, and his men, and obtained victorie of them, and smote of Abner and his men, 360. men; we see, that it is lawfull▪ for Christians now also vpon iust occasion to wage battell, as may appeare by these reasons, and places of Scripture. 1. Iohn Baptist, when the souldiers came vnto him, did not bid them renounce their calling, but onely saide, Doe violence to no man, neither accuse any falsly, &c. he would onely haue them to keepe within their bounds. 2. Cornelius the Centurion, Act. 10. pleased God in that calling, and his prayers were heard, and almes accepted before God. 3. God gaue diuerse lawes vn∣to his people concerning warre: as Deut. 20.6.7. it is prescribed, who should be ex∣empted and freèd from battell, and in what manner they should behaue themselues in battell, v. 10. but if it had beene vnlawfull at all to make warre, it would rather by law haue been altogether prohibited and restrained, then by certaine orders and rules commended. 4. Warre also is ascribed vnto God, as Exod. 17.16. The Lord will haue warre with Amalek: and Dauid is said, to fight the battels of the Lord, 1. Sam. 25.28. But God is not the author of euill. 2. But as it is lawfull to wage battell, so yet euerie kind of warre is not lawfull. These conditions then therein are required. First, that warre is not to be attempted without the authoritie of the Magistrate: for to him the sword is committed; as the A∣postle saith, He beareth not the sword for naught. Rom. 13.4. therefore it is not lawfull for priuate men of their owne head to beare armes: but in case of extreame necessitie, as where the enemies make sodaine inuasion, when there is no time to consult with the Magistrate: who yet haue the secret consent and authoritie of the Magistrate, whose will is, that his subiects should be preserued from wrong. Secondly, the cause
of warre must be iust and honest, as to deliuer the oppressed, to suppresse the ene∣mies of God, to recouer things wrongfully taken away, and for such like causes. Thirdly, it must be enterprized with a good minde; not to seeke reuenge, or with a desire to the spoile of the enemies, or to grow rich by warre, as mercenarie souldiers for no other cause loue warre: but first all honest meanes must be vsed for peace before warre be attempted; and then the other conditions concurring, they must proceede to battell, setting before them chiefely the glorie of God, to the ende they may liue in peace. 3. The contrarie obiections of the Anabaptists,The Anabap∣tists reason an∣swered, who denie it to be lawfull for chi∣stians to make warre. that hold it not lawfull for Chri∣stians to wage battell are these. 1. Our Sauiour Christ saith, Resist not euill, whosoeuer will smite thee on the right cheek, turne to him the other also. 2. Christ said to Peter, Hee that smiteth with the sword, shall perrish with the sword. 3. S. Paul findeth fault with the Corinthians for going one to lawe with an other, 1. Cor. 6. much lesse is it lawfull to goe to warre. 4. Christ in the parable would not haue the tares weeded out, but to remaine vn∣till the time of haruest, therefore warre is not to bee taken in hand for to purge the euill. 4. Christ saith vnto his Apostles, My peace I giue vnto you: Christs kingdome is peaceable, of the which the Prophet Isay saith, they shall breake their swords into mat∣tocks, and their speares into sythes, Isay. 2.4. How is this Prophesie verified, if now Christians vnder the kingdome of Christ should defend themselues with speares and swords? 6. The warfare of a Christian is now spirituall: as the Apostle sheweth, That wee wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principallities and powers, &c. against spiritu∣all wickednesses: and therefore he would haue vs put on the armour of God. Such are their reasons, which are thus briefly answered. Contr. 1. Our Sauiour in that place speaketh not of the authoritie of the Magistrate, but of euery priuate mans dutie, that they should be readie to suffer wrong, if they see it make more for the glorie of God, and the winning of their brother: for other∣wise our Sauiour himselfe did not keepe it according to the letter: for when he was smitten vpon the one cheeke, he did not turne the other: and S. Paul beeing smitten vpon the face, Act. 23. answered againe. 2. S. Peter also was a priuate man, and beside, he vsed the sword in his heat, with a reuengefull minde, and therefore he receiued that answer. 3. The Apostle doth not simply forbid to goe to Lawe; but two things he findeth fault with: the one, because they drewe their brethren before the tribunall of heathen Iudges: the other, for that they were apt vpon euerie occasion to goe to lawe, and would not suffer any wrong at all. 4. In that parable our Sauiour intreateth not of the dutie either of Magistrate or Minister: but sheweth the present condition of the Church what it is, that it shall ne∣uer be without tares: for if that were the meaning, as they pretend, then there should be no place left for any ciuill punishment, or Ecclesiasticall censure. 5. Christ indeede left peace vnto his disciples, both the internall peace of consci∣ence, and the externall also to them, which are his true followers: neither betweene Christian Princes and kingdomes, which truely professe the Gospel of Christ, doth there vse to be warre: If Christians then were such as by their profession they ought to be, that prophesie would haue his effect here in this world: but now because there are many carnall men in the Church, which mooue debate and dissention, it is suffi∣cient for vs, that this promise of peace beeing but in part begun here, be respited for the full and finall accomplishment thereof vnto the next life. 6. As wee are Christians indeede, so our aduersaries are spirituall, and our ar∣mour spirituall: but besides, wee are men, and encumbered with the affaires and businesse of this world, and haue other carnall aduersaries. And the Apostle speaketh by way of comparison, that our carnall enemies are nothing to our spii∣tuall,
and threfore these are named not as our onely enemies, but as the cheife. ex Mart. 21. Quest. v. 32. At what time Asahel was buried. 1. Iosephus thinketh, that Ioab lodged in the campe all that night, and the next day after they had buried Asahel, and the rest which were slaine, that then they retur∣ned to Hebron to the King: but the text is contrarie, that Ioab and his men went all night. 2. Some thinke that Ioab buried him the same night in Bethlem, and by break of day came to Hebron: whereby it may appeare, that the iourney was short, and the distance of the place not great. Pellic. But it is not like that this buriall was done in the night, neither that Ioab would foreslack the time to carrie newes vnto the king of his good successe. 3. Therefore it is more like, that Ioab made speed going all night till he came to Hebron to the King: and that afterward at more leisure, he attended the funerall and buriall of his brother: Mar. for it is no rare thing in Scripture, by an an∣ticipation of the historie, to set downe that as done at the same time, which was not∣withstanding effected afterward. Osiand. CHAP. 3. 1. Quest. v. 1. How long the warre continued betweene the house of Dauid, and the house of Saul. 1. SOme thinke that this warre continued the space of two yeares, during which time Ishbosheth is said to haue raigned ouer Israel, c. 2.10. Genevens. But it is shewed before, quest. 8. of the former chapter: that there the whole time is not set downe of Ishbosheths raigne, but onely how long he had raigned till that businesse fell out betweene Ioab and Abner: which beeing the beginning of the warre between the two houses, continued a good while after. Ioseph. 2. Neither was there any gene∣rall or publike warre betweene them, but a continuall emulation and opposition: Pel. neither is there any mention made of any other battell, sauing of the former in the second chapter, which rather was a skirmish, then a set battell. Mart. 3. Dauids house encreased, Sauls decreased, as this chapter sheweth, how Abner, the cheife vp∣holder of Sauls house fell away from Ishbosheth. And hereby is signified the increase of the kingdome of Christ, and the finall decay and ruine of the kingdome of Sa∣than. Mart. 2. Quest. v. 2. Of Dauids sonnes borne vnto him in Hebron. 1. Gods prouidence herein notably appeared, that Dauid all the while he was in exile had no children, but now beeing setled in his kingdome, he hath sonnes borne vnto him. Mart. 2. But in that of sixe wiues he had but sixe sonnes, this may bee obserued, that the marriage of many wiues was not blessed with fruitfulnesse: Salo∣mon had 700. wiues, and 300. concubines, yet but one sonne Rehoboam. As though nature it selfe gaine saied such mariages, as beeing contrarie to the first institution in the creation. Pellic. 3. Dauid had small comfort by these children: his eldest sonne Ammon committed incest, and was slaine by Absalom: Absalom rebelled against his father: Adoniah for affecting the kingdome was put to death by Salomon: So good men may be crossed in their children: and parents to whom God sendeth children, must therefore pray vnto God, to make them good children. Mart. 3. Quest. v. 3. Whether it were lawfull for Dauid to take to wife the daughter of the King of Geshur. 1. Some thinke that Dauid offended God in this mariage, and therefore he was punished in his rebellious sonne Absolom the offspring of that mariage. Borr. 2. But it is rather to be thought, that Dauid herein did not doe any vnlawfull thing: for they
were onely forbidden to ioyne in mariage with the nations of the Cananites, Hiuites, Iebuzites, Pherezites, and the rest: now the Geshurites were none of them, but were a people of the Amalekites, 1. Sam. 27.8. And it was permitted by the law, for the Israe∣lites to haue to their wiues the captiue women, which were taken in battell, Deut. 21.13. though such kind of mariages were rather tolerated, then commanded and allow∣ed by the law. 3. So it seemeth that Dauid tooke this Maacah among the captiues of the Geshurites, whome he inuaded: whome it is like he had taken to him before he came to Hebron: but yet shee was not then accounted among his wiues, as beeing not yet fully purged from her superstitious Gentilisme. Mart. 4. Quest. v. 5. Why Eglah is onely called Dauids wife. 1. Some thinke, because shee was but of base parentage, and was not by any other thing commended, then that shee was Dauids wife, she is so called, Vatab. but there are diuers other of Dauids wiues also, as Haggith, Abital, of whome no honourable mention is made, sauing that they were Dauids wiues. 2. Some thinke that this Eg∣lah was Michol, called the wife of Dauid, because shee was chiefe among them, as Ra∣chel was Iaakobs principall wife: and that shee was barren from that time, when shee mocked Dauid, chap. 6. but she might notwithstanding haue had a child before. Mar. Pellic. But it is not like shee was Michol, seeing shee is still called by the name of Eg∣lah, 1. Chron. 3. and the Scripture euidently sheweth, that shee had no child till the day of her death. 3. Some are of opinion, that this Eglah was one of Sauls wiues: but it was not lawfull for Dauid to marrie his father in lawes wife: the same de∣grees beeing forbidden as well of affinitie, which are of consanguinitie. 4. This clause then, his wife, is to be vnderstood in generall, that euery one of these six was Dauids wife: and that he had these sonnes in Hebron by his wiues, beside those which he had by his concubines, 1. Chron. 3.9. Iun. 5. Quest. v. 7. Whether Abner in deed went in to Rispah, or were accused falsly. 1. The Hebrewes thinke that Abner would haue had her to wife, which they hold to haue beene a thing vnusuall, and intolerable, that any should marrie her, that had beene the Kings wife: Pellic. and therefore Salomon tooke exception to his brother Adoniah, as affecting the kingdome, because he desired to wife Abishag. 2. Some thinke that Abner attempted not onely to haue had Rispah for his concubine, but that he did in deede defloure her: Mart. which Ishbosheth both tooke to be a disgrace vnto him, shee hauing beene his fathers concubine: and beside, it bewraied his ambi∣tious minde as aspiring to the kingdome; as Absalom lay with his fathers concubines, when he thought to depriue his father of his kingdome. Borr. 3. But it is rather like, that this was a false surmise, and suspition, without any ground: for Abner doth after∣ward instantly denie it: Iun. Vatab. which may also appeare by his great stomacke and indignation, whose conscience would haue made him somewhat to relent, if he had beene iustly charged. 4. Yet Iosephus is here deceiued, who saith this Rispah was Ish∣bosheths concubine; whereas she is called in the text Sauls concubine. 6. Quest. v. 8. Of Abners answer in generall. 1. Some note in Abner his obstinacie, that beeing reprooued for sinne, could not endure it, but seeketh to worke displeasure against him, that did admonish him: sic Mar. Genevens. But it is shewed before, that it is like that this was but a meere suspi∣tion of Abner. 2. Yet his pride and ambition appeareth, that could not abide one contumelle or reproach at Ishbosheths hand: that neither reuerence to the kingdome, nor yet neerenes in blood, could containe him in his dutie, but he must breake out in∣to disloyaltie. Pellic. 3. Beside, his leuitie and inconstancie is manifest, that vpon so small an occasion turneth from Ishbosheth, to take part with Dauid: to whom he see∣keth to ioyne, not of conscience, because he was the Lords annointed; but of displea∣sure against Ishbosheth. Such an inconstant person was one Ecebolus,Socrat. lib. 3. whom Socrates maketh mention of; who vnder Constantius the Emperour, was a forward Christi∣an, vnder Iulian a professed Idolater: and vnder Iovinian againe, he returned to Chri∣stianitie,
humbly crauing to be receiued, and crying out, calcate me sal insipidum: tread vpon me as vnsauourie salt. Mart. 7. Quest. v. 8. Of the meaning of Abners words, am I a dogges head. 1. Some referre it to Abner himselfe, that he should take it as a disgrace, and dis∣honour vnto him to be thus rebuked. Mar. 2. Some haue reference vnto Dauid and the rest of Iudah, in this sense that Abner should be counted as a vile person at their hands, for taking part with the house of Saul. Pellic. 3. Others haue relation to Ishbo∣sheth, as though he should thinke him no better then to be keper and head of the dogges of his enemie, namely Dauid. Vatab. 4. Some make this to be the meaning: thinkest thou, that if I woul offer my seruice to Dauid, he would thinke me worthy no better place then to keepe his dogges? but rather he would aduance me, and haue me in honour. Borr. 5. But the better sense is, to apply it to the thing it selfe, and the occasion offered: he so saith, because he was accused of incontinencie and leacherie, and therein like vnto a dog, and so euerie way a vile person; for in these two things men are compared to doggs: for intemperate lust; as Deut. 23.18. Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whoore, nor the price of a dogge into the house of God: and for vilenesse, as Dauid saith to Saul; after whom doest thou pursue, after a dead dog? 1. Sam. 24.15. 8. Quest. Of these words, v. 8. Which against Iudah doe shewe mercie, &c. 1. Some read, which was with Iudah? with an interrogation: as if he should haue said, haue I dealt vnfaithfully with thee, or fallen away from thee vnto Iudah? Iun. so also readeth Montanus: quod fuerim Iuda, as though I had beene with Iudah. 2. The Chalde thus interpreteth, as though I had beene reiected, or an abiect to those which are left of Iu∣dah: but here diuerse words are added. 3. I preferre the vsuall reading, am I a doggs head, which against Iudah doe shew mercie: not onely because of the consent of interpre∣ters, for so the most doe interpret laiehudah, not to Iudah, or from Iudah, but against Iudah. P.V.B.G.L. (the Septuag. doth omit it altogether:) but for that it best agreeth with the whole scope of Abners speach, that he had not deliuered Ishbosheth into the hands of Dauid, as followeth afterward. 9. Quest. v. 8. Of Abners excuse: Thou imputest to me a fault concerning this woman. 1. Some so take it, as though Abner should extenuate this fault, which hee had committed with a silly woman: that Ishbosheth had no reason in respect of his great deserts to charge him with so small an offence. Mart. But it is not like that Abner would haue so eleuated this offence, if he had beene guiltie of it, seeing she had been the Kings concubine: which thing was odious in Israel, to defile the kings concubine. 2. Pellican thus turneth the words, as though the emphasis were in thou; as if he should haue said, considering I am the onely stay and vpholder of thy kingdome, how darest thou reprooue me? 3. But all the force of the words lyeth in the accusation it selfe: as if he should say, I am free from this woman, and haue committed no such thing: and therefore thou doest me wrong thus to charge me: Iun. Vat. for the words them∣selues seeme to containe a deniall of the fact. 10. Quest. v. 12. How Abner sent messengers for himselfe. This word tactau hath diuerse expositions. 1. Some read, from his place, Chald. 2. Some, propter hoc, because of this. Iun. 3. Some, he sent secretly. B. 4. But the better reading is, he sent pro se, or loco sui, for himselfe, or in his stead: so V.L.A.G.M. Iose∣phus also so interpreteth, that he sent messengers in his stead: he sent not this message or embassage in the name of Ishbosheth, or of the state of Israel, but in his own name: Mart. and on his owne behalfe: the word tachath signifieth pro, for. 11. Quest. v. 13. Whether Dauid did well in vsing the helpe of Abner, and making a couenant with him. 1. The thing which Abner now went about was not vnlawfull, to bring the kingdom vnto Dauid, to whom the Lord had giuen it, though Abner did it of an euill minde: as Rahab did not euill in not discouering the spies, and so betraying the citie, Ios. 2.
nor the men of Luz, in shewing the way into the citie, by which meanes it was sur∣prised, Iudg. 1.23. This therefore not beeing an euill act of it selfe, Dauid might therein vse Abner. And so, that which is done by an other not without sinne, the ser∣uants of God may make vse of without sinne: as Iacob vsed the benefit of Labans oath, that sware by his gods, Gen. 31. as the tenne men, whom Ismael would haue slaine with the rest, saued their liues, in feeding their enemies couetous desire, allead∣ging, that they had treasures in the field of wheat, and barley, oyle, and honie, which they would discouer vnto them, if they would not slay them.Ierem. 41.8. So a poore man is excu∣sed in taking vp money vpon interest for his necessitie, though the vsurer be not ther∣in blamelesse. 2. But this libertie holdeth onely in things, which are not in their na∣ture euill: for in such, we can no way consent, or giue liking, but we must sinne. 3. Hitherto then Dauid offended not, in beeing contented to take aduantage of this message of Abner: but herein Dauid was ouerseene: first, that in so waightie matter as this, he did not first aske counsell of God: secondly, because he maketh a couenant with a wicked ambitious man, and of a suspected life. Pet. Mar. 12. Quest. v. 14. Why Dauid sendeth to haue his wife Michol restored vnto him. The reasons, which mooued Dauid were these. 1. In respect of himselfe, because she was his first wife, and he had obtained her, with his great danger; for an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistims: he gaue 200. not 600. as Iosephus, 1. Sam. 18.27. though Sauls demaund were onely for an hundred. 2. In respect of Michol, to deliuer her from that reproach and infamie, liuing now in adulterie: for Dauid had not dismissed her. The Rabbines thinke, that Phaltiel did not companie at all with her: but that is not like, seeing he was so vnwilling to part with her, v. 16. But Dauid knew that Michol was forced by her father to marrie to Phaltiel, not of her own mind; and therein ther∣fore hath her excused. 3. By this meanes Dauid maketh triall of the fidelitie of Abner. 4. It was a meanes to make a way to the kingdome, his wife beeing now returned, that was Sauls daughter. Mar. 13. Quest. v. 17. Of Abners perswasion vnto the Elders of Israel and Beniamin. 1. First, he presseth them, that it was their owne desire to haue Dauid to be their King: hee was a King of their owne choosing, and one in whom they all delighted. 2. He reasoneth à facili, it was an easie matter for them, and now in their owne power to doe. 3. He vrgeth the authoritie of God, that had appointed Dauid; the Lord hath spoken of Dauid: who here like an hypocrite, maketh the word of God to serue his owne turne: for it was not the word of God, which mooued him, but his owne mali∣tious heart. 4. He perswadeth them, ab vtili, from the commoditie, which should grow thereby to all Israel, that by the hand of Dauid the Lord would deliuer them from their enemies. Mar. 14. Quest. v. 20. Whether Dauid did well in making Abner a feast. 1. Abner did not content himselfe with that message, which he had sent before, because things are better dispatched by personall presence, then by the ministerie and mediation of others: and because he would certifie Dauid, how he had dealt in his behalfe with all the Elders of Israel, and how he had preuailed with them: for these reasons he commeth himselfe in person to Dauid: Iosep. 2. But Dauid did not well in making him a feast: both because he had not first consulted with God, but followed onely humane counsell, and therefore it tooke no place: Pellic. as also Abner beeing an euill disposed man it was not meete, that Dauid should haue eaten with him: Mar. This feast therefore ended afterward with mourning: teaching vs what vncertaintie there is in these earthly ioyes, that we may learne to vse them soberly, and with mode∣ration. Borr. 15. Quest. v. 28. Of Ioabs treacherous killing of Abner. 1. When Ioab had accused Abner to the King, that he went but about to vnder∣mine him, and seeing that the King could not be induced to deale against Abner: then
he bethinketh himselfe to take a course to be reuenged, and sendeth for him backe as it seemeth in the Kings name, and so thinketh Iosephus. 2. The causes which mooued Ioab to kill Abner, was two: his hatred for the murder of his brother Asahel; and his enuie, least Abner might haue growne too great in the Kings fauour, and so obscured him. Borr. But this latter was the greatest motiue, as afterward vpon the like cause he killed Amasa; yet he pretendeth the other, the death of his brother, as the end of the verse sheweth. 3. Ioab smiteth Abner in the same place, where he had smitten Asahel before: and though Ioab herein committed that which was both vn∣worthy himselfe, and his master the King, and for the which he worthely suffered af∣terward vnder Salomon: yet the iudgement of God was iust vpon Abner, a wicked and bloodie man: and the Lord turneth it to the great good of Dauid, in taking out of the way a new reconciled enemie, who would hardly haue prooued faithfull. Mar. 16. Quest. Of the place where Ioab killed Abner. 1. The most read, that he tooke him into the middes of the gate: L.V.P.M. rather within the gate: C.I. or aside in the gate: B.G.S. not to talke with him in an open and publike place (to be without suspition) for the gate was the place of iudgement. Mar. But he rather tooke him aside, and apart from the rest, to talke with him more secret∣ly: Ioseph. who thinketh also, that his brother Abishai was by: which is not vnlike; for he also consented, v. 30. 2. The word besheli, some read peaceablie: B.G.C. some craftely: L.P.S.V. but it rather signifieth, in errour, or vnawares: as c. 6.7. it is said that God smote Vzzah for his errour. Iun. ghal hashall. 17. Quest. v. 29. Of the fearefull curse, and execration, which Dauid layeth vpon Ioab and his posteritie. Whereas Dauid accurseth Ioab and his posteritie, and laieth vpon them an heauie burthen of fiue calamities and miseries: the running issue, the leprosie, weaknes, and faintnesse to goe with a staffe, vntimely death by the sword, and penurie and want of bread: wherein Dauid sheweth himselfe more seuere against his owne seruant and kinsman, then he was either against Saul or any enemie he had. 1. Some therefore thinke that Dauid did curse Ioab of impotencie and weaknesse of affection, beeing in anger and greefe, and that therefore all these euills did fall vp∣on his posteritie: for they say, that Rehoboam had a running issue, Vzziah was a leper, Asa had the goute, Iosias was slaine with the sword, and Iehoiakim wanted bread: so the Rabbines. But these Kings of Dauids line were thus punished for their own sins, not for Dauids. Mar. 2. Some thinke, that this was no imprecation, but a prediction by the spirit of God of such euills, as should befall Ioab, and his posteritie: but the forme of speach and the manner of phrase, let the blood fall, &c. sheweth it to be a verie imprecation, and malediction. 3. Some doe make question, whether this curse of Dauid beeing vttered in his heat and affection, did afterward take place, or no: Mar. But seeing Dauid was a Prophet, and here the reason is giuen of this iudgement, because both the brethren consented to kill Abner in time of peace, because he killed their brother in battell, v. 30. all which circumstances doe exaggerate the offence: it is not to be doubted, but that this curse tooke place vpon Ioab and his familie, as that other of Dauid vpon the mountaines of Gilboa, where Saul and Ionathan were slaine, tooke effect, 2. Sam. 1.21. and the leprosie of Naaman, by the Prophets sentence did cleaue vnto Gehezi. And that this Propheticall curse was effectuall, it seemeth to be the opinion of Iun. and Bor. 4. It beeing then resolued vpon, that Dauid both as a Prophet accursed Ioab his sinne of blood so deseruing, and as a wise man, that it might appeare to all Israel that Dauid was no way consenting to this fact: yet these doubts further will be made: First, why Dauid laieth this curse vpon the whole familie, not excepting the innocent: whereas in the law, the Lord is said to visit the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the chil∣dren, to the third and fourth generation of those that hate him. Ans. 1. This condition is alwaies included in such propheticall curses, though it
be not expressed. 2. or Dauid might foresee, that there should be alwaies some in Io∣abs familie, whose sinnes might be worthie of those plagues: 3. and yet in temporall chastisments the children may beare the iniquitie of the fathers, without any impeach∣ment of Gods iustice.2. Kin. 5 2. So the Prophet imposeth the plague of leprosie vpon Gehezi and his seed for euer, without any exception. Secondly, it will be obiected, why Dauid doth pronounce this execration rather against Ioab, then against Saul, which put the Lords Preists to the sword. Ans. Saul was the Lords anoynted, and therefore Dauid was no more to curse him, then to lay violent hands vpon him: againe, he should haue seemed to doe it in his owne cause: but the case was diuerse here: for Ioab beeing herein but a priuate person kil∣led Abner, contrarie to the Kings faith and safe conduct giuen him: and did by this meanes, as much as in him lay, if Dauid had not caried the matter wisely, hinder the establishment of Dauids kingdome. Thirdly, but why did not Dauid then, hauing obtained the kingdome, himselfe take condigne punishment vpon Ioab. Ans. 1. Both because it would haue weakned his gouernment, if he should at the verie first haue shewed seueritie toward a man of his owne kinred, and which had deserued so well of him: and Ioabs sinne was not yet come to the full: he afterward killed Amasa also in the like case: so that his pu∣nishment, though a while deferred, was the more heauie and greeuous when it came, Borrh. 18. Quest. v. 31. Why Dauid commanded Ioab to put on sackcloth and mourne for Abner. 1. Ioab might be thought to reioyce, and be glad, that Abner was ouerthrowen, and therefore he might seeme a very vnmeete man to celebrate Abners funerall: Da∣uid therefore, in forcing them thereunto, some may thinke, did make him play the hypocrite: But, it was fit and requisite, that Ioab beeing a principall man vnder Da∣uid, should not be wanting in this solemnitie: Dauid then requiring him thereunto, did that, which was fit: if Ioab therein dissembled, it was his owne fault. So Princes may enioyne their subiects to come to the exercises of religion:Princes may compell thei subiects to the exercises of re∣ligion. if they present not themselues with true deuotion, the offence resteth in them that faile therein, not in him that commandeth: as the King of Niniveh commanded a generall fast to be kept thorough the Citie: it is like it was not religiously kept of all: So the Lord in the Law commandeth, that the three solemne feasts in the yeare should be kept of all: and yet all the Israelites had not a sound and vpright heart toward the Lod. 2. Dauid might enioyne this dutie vnto Ioab, as a part of punishment: that he is constrained publikely to bewaile him, whom in his rage he had slaine. 3. And this might be a meanes also, to bring Ioab to acknowledge his sinne, seeing the great lamentation, which was made for Abner, whom he had slaine: Mar. 19. Quest. v. 33. Of these words: Dyed Abner as a foole dyeth? 1. Dauid bewayleth Abner, and commendeth him as a valiant man, but not for any vertue or goodnesse in him: for the wicked may haue some commendable parts, which are not to be depriued of their due praise. 2. The meaning then of Dauids words is this; that Abner died not as a coward, that is taken in warre, and lead cap∣tiue, his hands beeing bound: nor as a malefactor, whose feete are tied with fetters. Borr. But he would haue shewed his valour both by his hands, and feete, if they had tried with him with open fight: Iun. whereas now they killed him treacherously; as a man beeing neuer so valiant, may be circumvented by wicked conspiratours. Ge∣nevens. 20. Quest. v. 34. Of Dauid and the peoples weeping and lamen∣ting for Abner. Dauid lamenteth, and fasteth till euen, to shew and expresse his greefe for Abner, and that thereby he might content all Israel, and cleare himselfe as not beeing acces∣sarie to his death: but no mention is here made of any prayers made for Abner: yet the Romanists dare auouch, that this fasting and mourning of Dauid was for the re∣leefe of Abners soule: and that for this cause the Patriarks desired to be buried in
the land of Canaan, that they might be releeued by the prayers of the Church: hereof also it is,Controv. Against Purga∣torie. that Dauid would not pray for his child, after hee knew he was dead, be∣cause the infant needed not Dauids prayers: to this purpose Bellarm. lib. 1. de purga∣tor. c. 3. Contra. 1. It is euident by the text, that all this lamentation of Dauid, was to shew his griefe, that there was a great man fallen in Israel, v. 38. neither is there one syllable of any prayer made for Abner: it is then great boldnesse to ground that error vpon Scripture, which is altogether silent in that behalfe: neither were there any sacrifices in the lawe (there beeing so many diuerse kinds prescribed) appointed for the dead. 2. Neither was that any cause of their desire to be buried in the land of Canaan: but onely to shew their hope, in the certaine expectation of the promises of God: and to be a monument to their posteritie, that the Lord would bring them thither: for other∣wise, seeing the Israelites continued in Egypt almost 200. yeares after Iacobs buriall in Canaan, if he had intended to be helped by the prayers of the Church, he should haue desired to haue his bones kept in Egypt, & then caried thence at their departure, as Ioseph did, that he might haue had the benefit of the Churches prayers, which yet was to soiourne there. 3. And the cause is euident why Dauid ceaseth to pray any longer for the infant being dead, because he knew, that then he should not be brought to life againe. The childs soule indeed had no need of Dauids prayers, no more had the soules of the faithfull departed: and for the rest, that died in their sinne, they re∣ceiued their iudgement, and by the prayers of the liuing could not be releeued. 21. Quest. v. 39. Of the meaning of Dauids words, I am weake, and the sonnes of Zerviah are too hard for mee. 1. Some thinke, that whereas the word here vsed, (rach) signifieth tender, that Dauid speaketh of his clemencie, and mercie, that he had spared Abner, and shewed him fauour, but the sonnes of Zerviah, (which was his sister, by whom they are called, because it seemeth their father was but obscure) were hard hearted, and cruell. 2. Some other doe make this the sense, that whereas Dauids kingdome was but yet weake, these two men shewed more inhumanitie and inclemencie, then was for the safetie of his kingdome. 3. But it is euident by Dauids words, that he hath relation to himselfe, that they were too hard for him: it was not in his power to punish them, as their fact deserued, and therefore he committeth the reuenge of this cause vnto God. 22. Quest. v. 39. Whether Dauid offended in deferring and forbearing the punishment of Ioab. 1. Some are of opinion, that Dauid offended herein, and of a partiall affection spared Ioab, whereas he ought to haue beene put to death: and thus they doe reason. 1. By the law, he that slaieth a man presumptuously, is to be taken from the Altar, and to be put to death, Exod. 21.14. his punishment is not to be deferred or suspended. 2. It was the ruine of Eli his house, because he was too remisse toward his children. 3. And the King of Israel is reprooued, because he let Benhadad goe, when the Lord had giuen him into his hands. Mart. Contra. 1. Neither did Dauid pardon Ioab, but he gaue charge vnto Salomon concerning him, who caused him to be slaine at the Altar: and that law commandeth not that which is not possible, or not in the Magistrates power to performe: as if a murderer flie the countrie, and so be out of the Magistrates power, he doth not break the Law, in not putting him to death: so neither doth he, that can not reach the ma∣lefactor, without great tumult, and danger to the common wealth, but watcheth his conuenient time to doe it; which was Dauids case here. 2. Eli might haue corrected his sonnes without any danger, so could not Dauid. 3. And so was Benhadad deliue∣red into the Kings hand, who beeing a forren enemie might with lesse trouble haue beene put to death, then Ioab a domesticall freind, and much fauoured among the people. 2. The better opinion then is, that Dauid did prudently forbeare to punish Ioab: not so much because he was his kinsman, and had beene faithfull vnto him in the time
of his affliction, Pellic. or that he had many wayes well deserued of him, and could not well spare his seruice: Borrh. but for that they were too hard, and strong for him. And it seemeth in the historie of Absalom, c. 18.19. that Ioab did beare greater sway among the souldiers and militarie men, then Dauid himselfe: therefore it is a wise mans part, as well to consider, what may be done, as ought to be done: Iun. This then was in Dauid no conniuence or winking at Ioabs sinne, which he bare in mind, and charged his sonne to see iustice executed. But Dauid prudently deferred the pu∣nishment onely, which could not presently without great daunger be inflicted. At o∣ther times, when it was in his power, he delaied not to doe iustice; as vpon the Ama∣lekite, that said he had killed Saul, and vpon those two, that killed Ishbosheth. The like example we read of Iacob, who when his two sonnes Simeon and Levi had com∣mitted that shamefull murder vpon the Sichemites, did not proceed against them, be∣ing then a Magistrate in his owne familie: but deferred the censure till his death, Gen. 49.5. for both his children being stubburne and vnruly were too strong for him, and beside there was then no time, to make a stirre in his owne familie, they beeing round about beset, and enuironed of their enemies. 23. Quest. v. 39. Of these words of Dauid, The Lord reward the doer of euill according to his wickednesse. 1. Some thinke, that this is rather a prediction of Dauid, what should befall the wicked, then an imprecation. But it may verie well be a prayer also, which Dauid ma∣keth against those, which continue in their sinne without repentance. Mar. 2. Yet it may seeme strange, that Dauid prayeth for reuenge vpon Ioab for this murder, seeing he himselfe calleth for mercie at Gods hand, for the like sinne committed against V∣rias: wherefore here he must be vnderstood to speake of those, which were impeni∣tent, not of those which were touched with a feeling of their sinnes, as Dauid was, when as a testimonie of his vnfained repentance he endited the 51. Psalme. Borrh. 3. But concerning the meaning of these words, these three things are to be considered. 1. That God neither rendreth to good workes nor euill workes in this world, accor∣ding to the rule and measure of equalitie, but in some proportion and similitude: for he rewardeth good workes more liberally, then they are worthie of; and euill workes he recompenseth with lesse punishment then they deserue. 2. Good workes are no cause of their reward, but they are crowned in mercie: but euill workes are meritori∣ous causes of their punishment. 3. Neither doth God recompence all euill doers ac∣cording to their workes, but such onely as are obstinate and impenitent. Mar. CHAP. 4. 1. Quest. v. 3. What Berothites, and when they fled to Gittaim. 1. SOme vnderstand it of Baanah and Rechub, the two captaines of Ishbosheth, that they fled away from Ishbosheth, because of some crime, which they had committed: some, for that they had conspired with Mephibosheth, who discouered them: ex Mart. But the historie it selfe is against this sense: for how could these two haue opportunitie to kill Ishbosheth, and to haue such free ingresse to the house of Ishbosheth, if they had fled before, and had beene as it were banished from him. 2. Therefore it is better referred to the inhabitants of Beroth: not that they all fled away because of this conspiracie of Baanah, and Rechub, as Osiander: for this their flying, and departure went before this treason practised against Ishbosheth. 3. But the truth is, that the Berothites had fled aay from Beroth a towne of Beniamin, Iosh. 19.25. when they had heard of the death and ouerthrow of Saul: then the Philistims came, and dwelt in ther Cities: they remooued therefore from Beroth to Gittaim, which was neither a towne in Edom, or Arabia, but in Beniamin, Nehem. 11.33. Iun.
Borrh. Genevens. Vatab. 4. And this is the cause, why mention is made of this flight: that these captaines beeing Berothites might be known to be of the children of Ben∣iamin, because they were Berothites; though at this time their citie were inhabited by the Philistims, yet it was reckoned still with Beniamin. Iun. 2. Quest. v. 4. Why mention is made of Mephi∣bosheth. 1. This narration is inserted, to shewe the purpose and drift of these two captains in killing of Ishbosheth: they saw that none remained of Sauls house, who was likely to succeed in the kingdome, and to reuenge Ishbosheths death, but onely Mephibo∣sheth, who was a lame man: Iun. and beside, he was but a child; not aboue 12. yeare old: for 5. yeare old he was at the time of Sauls death, and Dauid had now raigned toward seauen yeares in Hebron: Saul had other sonnes by Rispah his concubine, but they could not be heires to the kingdome: Borr. 2. Further, hereby appeareth the prouidence of God, so disposing all things for Dauids good, that the kingdome might be deuolued vnto him, without his owne seeking: for seeing there was none left of Sauls house, sauing Ishbosheth, who was afterward killed, and Mephibosheth, the one lame in bodie, the other impotent in mind, the people of necessitie were now to looke after Dauid, and to desire him to be their King: as it followeth in the next chapter. Pellic. 3. Quest. v. 6. How these captaines disguised themselues, when they entred in to kill Ishbosheth. 1. The Chalde thinketh that they came as merchants to buy corne, so also Vatab. but if they had beene strangers, it is not like they should haue had such readie accesse. 2. Some thinke they came as to fetch corne for the souldiers and the campe. Martyr. 3. But seeing the word lakach signifieth as well to beare, as to take or fetch; it is more like, that they made as though they were domesticall seruants, and so came in bringing of wheate: Iun. Pag. 4. The Septuag. read, that the doore keeper was clean∣sing, and purging of wheat: but there is no such thing in the text. 4. Quest. v. 7. Of Ishbosheths secure sleepe. 1. Though it seemeth to haue beene vsuall in those countries, to haue their after∣noone nappes, as we read of Dauid, c. 12.3. both because the nights were short, and therefore they tooke vp some part of their sleepe in the day: Mar. and the heate of the day, which is verie feruent in those countries, made them also drowsie: Ioseph. 2. Yet this heauie sleepe of Ishbosheth, beeing now left naked, and without defence (Abner beeing slaine) sheweth both his securitie touching his owne estate, and his negligent administration of the kingdome: so Ionas slept in the ship when the tem∣pest arose, and great daunger was at hand; and the disciples were asleepe, when their master was in his greatest agonie.Matth. 26.40. 3. But sleepe it selfe is not to be accused: for as some are ouertaken in their sleepe; so sometime it is a meane of deliuerance, and to escape danger: as Plutarch hath a storie how Mithridates sent one Oltacus to kill Lucullus, who comming thither as to doe a message of some importance, and answer beeing returned, that he was asleepe, and it was against his health to be awaked; he thereup∣on fledde away, least he should haue beene further sifted. 4. And seeing Ishbosheth was thus slaine in his sleepe, it teacheth vs to commend our selues vnto God, when wee goe to our rest, because we knowe not what may happen vnto vs in our sleepe. Martyr. 5. Quest. v. 8. Of their words to Dauid, The Lord hath auenged my lord, &c. 1. True it is, that this came to passe by the secret working and disposing of Al∣mightie God, that Dauid might be established in his kingdome: and it was iust, that Ishbosheth should come to such an ende, because he vsurped vpon the kingdome, which the Lord had appointed to an other. 2. But this was no good excuse, or de∣fence of their vnlawfull act, in killing their Lord: for by this meanes, Iudas treache∣rie toward his Lord might be excused, because it was done according to the determi∣nate counsell of God. Indeede when Alexander in his rage and wine, had killed
Clitus, and afterward was stricken with griefe, Aristander did comfort him, by laying the cause and originall thereof vpon the fates, wherewith Alexanders griefe was som∣what qualified. 3. Neither had these two murderous and bloodie men any such in∣tent, herein to obey Gods will, but respected only their owne aduancement and pre∣ferment therein. Mart. 6. Quest. v. 9.10. Of Dauids answer to the traytors that brought Ishbosheths head. 1. Dauid vttereth three excellent sentences: the one in saying, as the Lord liueth, who hath deliuered me: shewing that vnlawfull meanes must not be vsed to hasten the Lords worke, but that we must with patience waight vpon God: the other, that we must not reioyce in the destruction of an enemie, as Dauid did not neither in Sauls death, nor Ishbosheths: the third, that honestie is to be preferred before profit and vtilitie, and that the counsels and enterprises of the wicked must not be approoued, though they be for our profit: Borr. 2. Dauid will much more be avenged of these men, then of the Amalekite that said he killed Saul; both in respect of their persons, who were seruants to Ishbosheth, and of the same tribe, whereas the Amalekite was a stranger, and not of Israel: as also of him that was slaine, who was a righteous per∣son: in respect of them which conspired against him, he had deserued well of them; so had not Saul of the Amalekites, whom he had destroyed, and Saul had alreadie his deaths wound, and could not recouer, but Ishbosheth was then a sleepe, and in good health: the one was killed in the field, the other in his owne house: and thirdly, Da∣uid was then but as a priuate man, when he commaunded the Amalekite to be killed, but now he was anointed King in Hebron: therefore in all these three respects, there was greater cause why he should put them to death, then the other. 7. Quest. v. 12. Of the cutting off their hands and feete and hanging them vp. 1. Dauid either caused their bodies which were hanged vp, to be taken downe before night, according to the Law, Deuter. 21. and as it was practised by Iosuah, c. 7. Mart. or else he hung vp onely their hands and feete ouer the poole in Hebron,Reconcil. af∣ter their bodies were taken downe, both in detestation of that horrible murder, and to be a spectacle to others: Borr. An example is made of those parts, which were the speciall instruments of contriuing this villanie, their feete in going to shedde blood, and their hands in cutting off his head: Mart. 2. This cutting off the hands and feet, was beside the prescript of the law, which commanded the murderer onely to be put to death: but as the sinne might be more hainous, so the Magistrate might also en∣crease the punishment; as they cut off Adonibezeks thumbes of his hands and feete. So that though the Lawe inflicted onely the bare punishment of death,Iudg. 1. yet according to the circumstances of the crime, more grieuous torments might be added by the Magistrate: Mar. He was not to adiudge to death, where the law imposed not the punishment of death: but he might aggrauate that penaltie, in the manner of death, according to the qualitie of the offence. CHAP. 5. 1. Quest. v. 1. How all the tribes of Israel came to Dauid, and of the summe of their embassage. ALl the multitude came not, but the Elders only and cheife in the name of the rest: Mar. or rather messengers, and embassadours from all the tribes: Iun. 2. They vse three reasons and perswasions, which mooued them to affect Dauid for their king: first, he was of their kinred, of their bones and flesh, as they were appointed by the Law, to make a king from among their brethren, Deut. 17.15. secondly, they had ex∣perience of his valor in the dayes of Saul, when he led the people in and out: thirdly, the Lord had elected him; as the law likewise requireth that they should make him their king, whom the Lord should choose, Deuter. 17.15. Borr. The Lord had said
vnto him by Samuel, when he annointed him, Thou shal feede my people: the signe went not without the word: though in that place for breuiie ske it be omitted. Iun. 2. Quest. How they made a covenan before the Lord. 1. Some thinke that after Shilo was destroyed, an high place was erected in He∣bron, where they offered sacrifices vnto God: Pellic. where Abraham also in his time had built an altar: and therefore they are said ther to make a couenant before the Lord: Mart. But it was not lawfull: for any sacrifice ordinarily to be offered, but where the arke was. 2. Some thinke that th high Priest was present with his Vrim and Thummim: Borr. Iosephus also saith, that the high Priest was there, with diuerse other Priests and Leuites; but not the presence of the Priests onely, but of the Arke also was requisite, (when in that sense they wre said to be before the Lord) which was yet in Abihadabs house: Geneuens. 3. Some thinke it is so said, because God is present in the assemblies of his Saints: yea where two or three are gathered together in his name: Vatab. 4. But it signifieth more then so, that they tooke the Lord so∣lemnly to witnes, and so as in his presence, and by his name, made this solemne league and couenant: Iun. Geneuens. 3. Quest. Of the number of those, which came to Dauid to Hebron. 1. Though the number be not here expressed, it is at large set downe, 1. Chron. c. 12. v. 23. to the ende of the Chapter. The particular numbers out of euerie tribe that came to Dauid were these; out of Iudah, 6800. out of Simeon, 7100. of Leui 4600. of Beniamin, 3000. of Ephraim, 20800. of the halfe tribe of Manasseh, 18000. of Issachar, 200. captaines with their companies, the number whereof is not set downe: of Zebulun, 50000. of Nephtali 1000. captaines, and with them 37000. of Dan, 28000. of Asher, 40000. and of them beyond Iordan an 120000. The whole number beeing summed together, maketh about 300000. 2. But Iosephus somewhat differeth in his account; for the odde 800. yeares of Iudah, he reckoneth but 600. for the odde 600. of Leui, he writeth 700. he numbreth of Issachar, 20000. which is not expressed in the text: and the number of 30000. out of Nephtali he o∣mitteth: from them beyond Iordan, he accounteth but 22000. who made 120000. 3. Of all these the most backward are noted to haue beene of Beniamin: for of that tribe came the smallest number, but 3000. for they yet held with the house of Saul: the most forward were they of Zebulun, as it appeareth by their number of 50000. which was the greatest of any one tribe: and they are directly mentioned not to haue bin of a double heart.Iosep. l. 7. antiq. cap. 2. And Iosephus writeth that this tribe onely came whole to Dauid. 4. Quest. Of the time that Dauid raigned ouer Israel. v. 4. The whole time is said to be 40. yeares: whereof he raigned 7. yeares six moneths in Hebron, and 33. yeares in Ierusalem: which make in all 40. yeares sixe moneths. 1. Some thinke that these sixe moneths are not summed, because so long the king∣dome of Dauid was intermitted by the rebellion and sedition of Absalom: so the Hebrewes. 2. Others thinke that the 33. yeares mentioned were but 32. yeares and a halfe: the imperfect yeare beeing counted for an whole and perfect yeare: Iun. Pell. 3. But it is more like, that to make the number of 40. yeare euen, the odde sixe mo∣neths are omitted: Borrh. see the like Iud. 20.46. where there are said to be slaine of Beniamin, 25000. men, in which number one hundred is omitted: for v. 25. they are said to be 1800. This place Iunius alleadgeth for his opinion, that to make a round and euen number, 33. yeares are put for 32. and an halfe: but the place sheweth rather that to make a perfect and square number, sometimes the odde ouerplus is detracted rather, then added. 5. Quest. v. 6. Of the citie Ierushalem, and the name thereof. 1. Dauid goeth vnto this citie purposing to make in the head city of the kingdom, not only in respect of the situatiō thereof, being set as it were in the mids of the tribes, but he by the direction of Gods spirit did see, that it was the place, which the Lord did chuse: where sometime Melchisedec dwelt, that great priest of the most high God, &
there was the mount Moria, where Abraham would haue sacrificed his sonne. 2. Ie∣rushalem it was called, not of the Greeke word , which signifieth holy: neither as though it came of Iebus, and shalem, and for the better sound, Ierushalem, as Peter Mar. But it is better deriued of ijreh, he will be seene: as Abraham saith, in the mount will the Lord be seene, Gen. 22. and shalem, peace: so Ierushalem signifieth the vision of peace: see Midras in Psal. 76. 3. This Citie was giuen part of it to the tribe of Iu∣dah, Iosh. 15. part to the tribe of Beniamin, Iosh. 19. for it belonged to both those tribes: the tribe of Iudah tooke this citie, and smote it with the edge of the sword, Iudg. 1.8. but the Iebusites were not thence expelled by the children of Beniamin, v. 21. And afterward the Iebusites inhabited there still, for it was a citie of straungers, when the Leuite went that way with his concubine, Iud. 19.12. But the perfect con∣quest of this Citie was reserued for Dauid, who therein was a liuely type of the Mes∣sias, who should perfectly triumph ouer our spirituall enemies. Mart. 6. Quest. Who were the blind and lame spoken of v. 6. Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come hither. 1. The Hebrewes haue here a fabulous narration of two images, one of Isaac, who was blind, and the other of Iacob, who was lame, by whom a league was made with Abimelech, in which league the Iebusites also were comprehended: so that in effect the Iebusites which held the tower of Sion, say thus much, that vnlesse they first would violate that couenant, they were not to come vp thither: But this conceit hath no probabilitie: for Abimelech was King of the Philistims, not of the Iebusites: there∣fore the league rather appertained to them, then vnto the other. 2. Some by blind & lame, vnderstand the wicked & sinners: as the Chald. . Some think the Iebusites meane their blind and lame images: Genevens. Mart. but it is vnlike that they would them∣selues so call their Idols, wherein they trusted. 4. Wherefore the meaning rather is this, that they were so confident vpon the strength of the place, that the verie blind and lame were able to defend it against them: therefore they speake this in derision, mocking and scorning Dauid, that he should not be able to ouercome the very blind and lame among them. Vatab. Iun. Pellic. Borrh. 7. Quest. v. 8. Of the reward which Dauid propoundeth to him that should smite the blind and lame. 1. The speach is here somewhat imperfect, what shall be done to him that smiteth them: but it is supplied 1. Chron. 11.6. that he should be the chiefe captaine, that did that exploit: by which seruice Ioab obtained to be the cheife captaine. 2. By such rewards and promises, the minds of men are whetted, to enterprise such diffi∣cult workes: Indeed,How farre re∣wards are to be respected. euery one ought to be readie to doe things honest without re∣spect to the reward, but such is our humane infirmitie, that it had need to be stirred vp and prouoked by such means. 3. But there is a great difference to be made betweene these terrene rewards proposed by men, and the heauenly rewards which the Lord promiseth: for rewards from men may be deserued, so can not the other. Men for their temporall seruice may haue respect to the one, and for the reward sake vndertake the businesse: but in heauenly things we are not to loue God for the reward sake, but the reward for Gods sake. Mart. 3. Some thinke that Dauid was ouerseene in gran∣ting so liberall a reward to Ioab, a bloodie and wicked man: Martyr. But I see no reason, why an euill man may not receiue a reward of temporall honour, for a tempo∣rall seruice done for the good of the common wealth; wherein his euilnes is not rewar∣ded, but his valour, and not for his owne sake, but for the good ensample, and encou∣ragement of others. 8. Quest. v. 8. Of the proverb, the blind and lame shall not come into that house. 1. That is, say some, the blind and lame Idols shall not come into the Temple: Ge∣nevens. But if this exploit had not beene, Dauid would neuer haue suffered Gods house to be defiled with Images. 2. Some take it to be vsed onely as a Proverbe, when any thing is brought to passe, that is vnlikely, and hard to be done. Mar. Pellic. 3. But it is euident rather, that Dauid did make this order, as a perpetuall monument
of this victorie, that neither any blind or lame should be suffered to enter into his pal∣lace, called the citie of Dauid: as none that mourned in sackcloth were admitted into the King of the Persians pallace:Estr 4.2. but this was done of an ambitious and superstitious pride; Dauid obserued the other, as a monument of his thankfulnes to God. Iun. 9. Quest. v. 9. Of Millo, from the which it is said, that Dauid built. 1. Some take it for the towne house, or the place where the people had their so∣lemne assemblies: and it was so called Millo, of filling or replenishing. Genev. 2. Some thinke it was th deepe ditch or valley, which was betweene the tower of Sion, and the citie, which was filled with water: R. Ben Gers. but Ierusalem beeing situate in a drie place, it is not like that such plentie of water stood alwaies in the valley. Mart. 3. Therefore it is better taken for the rampire or fortresse, which compassed the tower of Sion round about, beeing enuironed with a wall: Borrh. Iun. the Septuag. readeth, , as ab extremitate, from the extremitie: the Chalde call it the abstruction, that is, the antemural or rampier. It was not the proper name of a place: for there was a Millo also in Shechem, which was the tower and fortresse thereof, Iudg. 9.6. and 49. 4. Dauid is said to haue built round about from the fortresse inward, be∣cause Ioab repaired the rest of the citie without, 1. Chron. 11.8. 10. Quest. v. 12. Of these words, Then Dauid knewe, that the Lord had established him King. 1. The Rabbines thinke that Dauid tooke this extraordinarie kindnesse of Hiram the King of Tyrus to be a signe of Gods fauour toward him, and that the Lord had e∣stablished him king. 2. For though temporall blessings are not alwaies a signe of Gods fauour, nor vnto all: as namely to worldly and carnall men, that doe not ac∣knowledge God the author of thm: and therefore it is said, that the Lord filleth their bellies with his hid treasure, Psal. 17.14. for they are snared and entangled with their prosperitie. 3. Yet God reuealeth to his children, when prosperitie is sent as a signe of his fauour, and when aduersitie is inflicted vpon them for their sinne▪ and indeede simply, peace and prosperitie is alwaies a blessing vpon the righteous, who may not∣withstanding in their high estate forget themselues,How farre tem∣porall blessings are a signe of Gods fauour. and affliction neuer commeth vp∣on them, but for some sinne which God by this meanes would bring to their know∣ledge. 4. And though temporall blessings are no sure argument, no not to the righte∣ous of Gods euerlasting fauour: yet they may be a signe of further good successe in temporall things; as this friendship of Hiram was a token to Dauid of the confirming of his kingdome: so elsewhere Dauid saith, shewe a token of thy goodnes toward me, that they which hate me may see it and be ashamed.Psal. 8.17. Then a temporall fauour is a signe of Gods loue, when it is ioyned with the honour of God: but when God chastiseth his chil∣dren euen with the hazard of his owne glorie and name in the world, it is an euident demonstration of his anger. 11. Quest. Of Dauids concubines, wiues, and sonnes. ver. 13. 1. A concubine differed from a wife in these three things: First, the wife was so∣lemnly espoused, so was not the other: the wife was also endowed, so was not the concubine: the children of the wife were legitimate and did inherite, so did not the other: Mart. 2. Dauid hd in all eight wiues, sixe in Hebron, and two afterwards, Bethsabe and Sulamith, and tenne concubines, c. 20.3. Herein, although the Rab∣bins would excuse Dauid for his multiplicitie of wiues, which he tooke for procrea∣tion, and to insinuate himselfe into the loue of his people, whose daughters he made his wiues and concubines: yet therein he shewed his infirmitie, in taking him many wiues contrarie to the Law, Deut. 17.16. 3. Concerning his sonnes, they are some∣what diuersly rehearsed here, and 1. Chron. c. 3. and c. 14. both in name and number, Shammua is called Shime, 1. Chron. 3.5. Elishua is named Elishamah, 1. Chron. 3.5. and Eliada Beeliada, 1. Chron. 14.3. And here are but eleuen reheased, in the other places two more are named, Eliphalel or Elphlet, and Nagah. 11. Quest. v. 20. Of the victorie which Dauid had against the Philistims. 1. Now the time is come, that the Philistims should receiue condigne punishment that had so insolently behaued themselues, when Saul and Ionathan were slaine. And
God so disposeth in his wise prouidence, that they should first prouoke Dauid to bat∣tell: he beganne not with them, least he might haue seemed vnthankfull, seeing he had found harbour and entertainment among them in the daies of Saul. Mart. 2. The Philistims pitched in the valley of Rephaim, which was not farre from Ierusalem, Io∣seph. and belonged to the tribe of Iudah, Iosh. 15.8. Iun. Some take it to be the same place, which is here called Baal Perazim: Pellic. but they seeme rather to be two diuers places: and that the Philistims host was so large, the Phenicians and other nations as∣sisting them, as Iosephus saith, that the one part beeing in the valley, the other reached to Baal Perazim: Mart. and that they were two places, appeareth 1. Chron. 14.11. for the Philistims went vp from the valley of Rephaim to Baal Perazim. 3. Dauid, as be∣fore the battell, he consulted with God by the Priest with Vrim and Thummim, and thereupon went to the fort, (which is likely to haue beene the tower of Sion) not to trust to the defence of the place, but till he had consulted with God: so the battell be∣ing finished, and the victorie obtained, he to shew his thankfulnes to God, leaueth a monument of that victorie obtained, by giuing the name Baal Perazim to the place, which signifieth the plain of diuision, or breaking asunder: because Dauid brake in vpon them, euen as waters in a great ouerflowing, or inundation, as he himselfe saith. 12. Quest. v. 21. How Dauid serueth the images of the Philistims. 1. The word translated Idols, is ghatzabehem, their idols, or images: which word properly signifieth griefe or terror; for the superstitious adoration of images bringeth no true comfort, but griefe and terror to those that worship them: Iun. Mart. the Chal∣de readeth, their errors: for they doe greatly erre, who follow after vaine Idols. 2. Da∣uid taketh them: the Chal. readeth, burned them: so also Pag. B.G. but the word nasa, signifieth properly, to take: yet Dauid tooke them away, not with an intent to conuert them to the vse of the Tabernacle, as Pellic. but he tooke them to burne them: as is e∣uident, 1. Chron. 14.12. so was it commanded, that they should burne their grauen i∣mages with fire, Deut. 7.5. As Iacob burned them vnder an oke, and so tooke them out of the way: and Moses burned the golden calfe, and beat it to pouder, that the oc∣casion of offence and stumbling might vtterly be remooued out of the way: for other∣wise we read, that they which preserued or erected such superstitious monuments, put a stumbling block before the people, as Micah did by making him images, Iudg. 17. Mar. 3. The superstition also of the Philistims herein shewed it selfe, who carried their Idols with them into their campe, thinking thereby to be protected: therein, as it seemeth imitating the Israelites, who carried the Arke into the host, 1. Sam. 4. As the Pope-Catholikes at this day doe vse to carrie with them into the field,Controv. Against the car∣rying about of the host. their superstiti∣ous Reliques, their consecrated host, and such other toyes, thinking thereby to be de∣fended. And further herein the beggerly impotencie of their vaine Idols is made ma∣nifest, which were so farre from giuing any comfort or aid, to their worshippers, as that they were not able to defend themselues, but were taken captiue. Martyr. 13. Quest. v. 24. What the noise was in the toppe of the mulberrie trees. 1. Some read, in the toppe of the peare trees: L. some in the toppe of the trees: C. in the wood of mourning: S. but baca with aleph, signifieth a mulberrie tree; with (he) mourning: and beside, it should haue no sense to say, when thou hearest the noise of one going in the toppes of mourning. 2. This noise some thinke was procured by the rushing of the wind, some by the Angels, which is most like, for it was extraordinarie. And it might serue, as well to terrifie the hearts of the Philistims, who did flie at the noise of a leafe shaken, beeing stricken with a great feare, as to be a signe of the presence of God: some thinke it was such a great noise, as that the Philistims heard not the ap∣proaching of Dauids armie: but the speciall vse was, to signifie vnto Dauid, that the Lord was present to deliuer him, and to fight for him against the Philistims.
CHAP. 6. 1. Quest. v. 1. Whether this historie of bringing the Arke from Abinadabs house be transposed. WHereas the storie is rehearsed, 1. Chr. 13. before Dauid had the former battell with the Philistims: 1. P. Mart. onely propoundeth this doubt, and saith, hi∣storia videri possit nonnihil perturbata: the historie seemes to be put somewhat out of or∣der; but he giueth no solution of this question. 2. Certain it is, that Dauid parta pace, hauing obtained peace, Osiand. deuictis hostibus, and his enemies ouercome, Pellic. then did settle himselfe to reforme religion: and therefore the historie is here set downe in the right order of time, howsoeuer it is reported in the Chronicles. 3. Therefore the best answer is this, that Dauid had assembled together the cheife of Israel twice to this ende, and consulted with them to bring home the Arke: the first time was after he had surprised and taken the fort of the Iebusites in Ierusalem: which purpose and consultation of Dauid, was hindered and interrupted by the inuasion of the Phili∣stims; then after Dauid had vanquished them, he called them againe, and therefore it is here said, Dauid gathered together againe the chosen men, &c. Pet. Martyr thinketh, they had beene assembled together before, to celebrate the inauguration of Dauids raigne, but rather he had called them together before to consult about the Arke: Iun. This calling together twice of the people, is mentioned 1. Chron. 13.1.5. 4. But yet this doubt remaineth, because in that place all this rehearsed to be done in this chap∣ter, to v. 10. is set downe before Dauids battell with the Philistims: whereunto this answer may be giuen, that mention beeing made there of that consultation, which Dauid had before the Philistims battell, that narration is finished together, accor∣ding to the vse of Scripture, which more respecteth the coherence of argument, then the order of time. 2. Quest. Of Dauids consulting and gathering together the cheife men to bring againe the Arke. In the Chronicles the certaine number is not expressed, how many were gathered together, but here they are said to be 30. thousand: As here the bounds and limits of the land are not described, how farre and from whence they were called, as there it is said, that Dauid gathered them together, from Sichar of Egypt vnto the entring in of Hamath, that is, from the South bounds of the land to the North: Borr. The cau∣ses of this great assemblie were these. 1. Vt solenni pompa, &c. that with solemne pompe, and due deuotion they might bring the Arke: Pellic. 2. Vt ad manum habe∣ret paratos milites, that he might haue souldiers readie at hand, if the enemie should haue attempted to disturbe them: Osiand. 3. Vt pium & moderatum Principem decuit, &c. as it became a moderate and godly Prince, he would haue the consent of the states and the people: not like vnto the Pope and his Cardinalls, and the Papall prela∣cie, who take vpon them without the aduise of the ciuill state, to innovate and change matters of religion of their owne head: Mart. 4. Rupertus maketh this solemne re∣ducing of the Arke, which was a type of Christ, a type and figure of the solemne prea∣ching and publishing of the resurrection of Christ by the Apostles through the world. 5. So the first thoughts and counsell of Dauid, after he was established, and setled in his kingdome, was to seeke after God, and to reforme religion. But in Sauls time they sought not the to Arke of God, 1. Chr. 13.3. for Sauls head was troubled and busi∣ed about the succession of the kingdome, and the pursuing of Dauid: and in stead of consulting with God at the Arke, hee went vnto Witches, which was his ruine. Martyr. 3. Quest. v. 2. Of the place from whence they brought the Arke. 1. The word is mibaghale, which some read, de viris, of the men or Lords of Iuda: Mont. Pagn. whom Osiander followeth. 2. But it is rather the name of the citie, which
was called Kiriathiearim, or Kiriathbaal, Ios. 15.60. or Baalath, 1. Chron. 15.4. or in the plurall number, Baalim, as it is here translated by Iun. and Vatab. 3. There the ark rested in Kiriathiearim when it returned from the Philistims, 1. Sam. 7.1. which was at the least 40. yeares before: immediately after the death of Eli, after whome succee∣ded Samuel and Saul, who gouerned Israel 40. yeares, Act. 13.21. 4. Quest. v. 2. Of the meaning of these words, Whereon is called vpon the name of Iehouah. 1. Some doe referre these words vnto God, reading thus, to fetch from thence the Arke of God, whose name is called by the name of Iehovah: B.G.V. but it seemeth ra∣ther to be a description of the Arke, shewing the excellencie and dignitie of it, that there the Lord was called vpon, and from thence gaue answer, and shewed there eui∣dent signes of his presence. 2. Some doe vnderstand it of the Arke, that it was cal∣led by the name of Iehouah: so Pellic. Osiand. and Pet. Martyr further giueth this reason: that the Sacraments doe beare the name of the things, which they signifie: as the name of the altar which Moses made, Exod. 17. was called Iehouah: and so Gedeon called the altar which he made, Iehouah shalam, Iehouah peace, Iudg. 6.24. Borrh. And after the same manner must the words of our Blessd Sauiour be vnder∣stood, this is my bodie: the Sacrament is called by the name of the thing. But neither of these two places are fitly alleadged: for the name Iehouah is not simply giuen vnto these altars, but with some addition: the first is called by Moses, Iehouah missi, the Lord is my banner: the other by Gedeon is named Iehouah Shalam, Iehouah (is our) peace. Neither are the words so to be read here. 3. Therefore the better reading is, at, as Iun. or vpon the which (as Sep. Lat.) namely the Arke of God, the name of Ieho∣uah is called vpon: there solemnly the name of Iehouah was invocated: so also read Mont. Pag. the word kara here vsed, signifieth not onely to call, but also to inuocate, and call vpon, as Gen. 4.26. 5. Quest. v. 2. How God is said to sit betweene the Cherubims. 1. Tostatus hath this conceit, that the Angel which spake from between the Che∣rubims did assume a certaine aerie bodie, which rested betweene the Cherubims:qu. 2. in c. 25. Exod. which beeing imagined, God might be said to sit there, because his Angel in that as∣sumed bodie was there present: but here Iehouah is said to sit or dwell betweene the Cherubims, which name is neuer giuen vnto any Angel: it was God therefore him∣selfe, and not an Angel which made his seate there. 2. Some imagined also, because the Lord is said to sit vpon the mercie-seate betweene the Cherubims: that the Mer∣cie-seat was not put close vpon the Arke, but was held ouer it as the throne, and the seate, and the Arke was as the footestoole: this opinion is elsewhere shewed to bee without any ground: for the Mercie-seat serued as a couering to the Arke,Hexap. in Exod. c. 5. qu. 28. and was put aboue vpon it, Exod. 40.20. 3. God therefore is said to sit betweene the Cheru∣bims, because from thence he gaue answer, and deliuered his oracles: Vatab. Borrh. as he did to Moses, Numb. 7.89. 4. God was otherwise there present then he is in the whole world; here was the presence of his grace, sicut fidelibus sacramentaliter adest, as he is present to the faithfull in the Sacraments: Pellic. 5. As God is said to dwell betweene the Cherubims: so Christ is not elswhere to be sought then in his Church, with the which he hath promised to be present to the ende of the world. Borr. 6. Quest. v. 3. Why they put the Arke of God vpon a newe cart. 1. Pellican thinketh that they did this by the appointment of the King himselfe, or of the high Priest. But it appeareth by the punishment inflicted afterward vpon Vz∣zah, that it was his negligence cheifely and ouersight so to carrie the arke. 2. They did thus, as they thought for the more honour and reuerence to the Arke, but it proo∣ued otherwise: Borr. whereby we see that many things may be done of a good inten∣tion, and yet not acceptable vnto God. 3. It seemeth also, that herein they followed the example of the Philistims, who put the Arke into a newe cart: but they should rather haue looked vnto the law, and commandement of God, who appointed the Leuites to carrie it vpon their shoulders: Mart. 4. Like vnto these are the Roma∣nists,
in these two respects. 1. Because as these imitated the Philistims, so they doe borrow many of their rites and vsages from the Iewes, or Gentiles. 2. And as these ease their owne shoulders, and cause the oxen to drawe the Arke, so the Popish pre∣lacie doe wind their necke out of the coller, and lay the duties belonging vnto them vpon others: as preaching vpon their chaplaines, their gouernment vpon their chan∣celors and officials, giuing themselues in the meane time to their pleasure and idlenes: Mart. 5. Rupertus by the Arke carried in the cart or charet, vnderstandeth the prea∣ching of the Gospel, borne as it were by the fowre Euangelists: but this application is not so fit, seeing this carting of the Arke was taken in euill part, and much displea∣sed God. 7. Quest. v. 4. Whence the Arke was brought, and by whom. 1. It was brought from the house of Abinadab, where it was left, 1. Sam. 7.1. whose house was in the hill, Iun. Vatab. rather then in Gibeah: for that was in Benia∣min. 2. These two sonnes of Abinadab, R. Gerson thinketh not to haue beene Levites: but Iosephus opinion is more probable, who thinketh that Abinadab was a Leuite, in whose house the Arke had staied a long time:lib. de antiq. c. 2 for it is not like, that otherwise his sonne Eliezer should haue beene sanctified before to keepe the Arke, 1. Sam. 7.1. and now his two other sonnes Ahio and Vzzah suffred to guide it: to whom, as Iosephus writeth, that care was committed by the Priests. 3. The Septuag. for Ahio, read his brother: whereas it is euident out of the text, that those two Vzzah and Ahio were Abinadabs sonnes. v. 3. 4. Ahio went before, and Vzzah went behind, though it be not expressed, as it appeareth afterward by Vzzahs staying of the Arke with his hand. Iun. 8. Quest. v. 4. Of the meaning of these words: And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which is in the hill, with the Arke. 1. Vatablus readeth, and they brought it, &c. with the Arke, that is the coffer, wher∣in the Philistims had put their presents and gifts, which they sent with the Arke, 1. Sam. 6.8. they brought it together with the Arke. 2. Some read thus: they brought the Arke out of the house of Abinadab: B.G. but here some thing is omitted, not translated; as it, and with. 3. Some referre it to Abinadab, who was in Gibeah keeping the Arke: so the Latine interpreter expoundeth, with the Arke, that is, keeping it. 4. Osiander thus interpreteth: they brought it, that is, the new cart, with the Arke. 5. The meaning is rather, that they were with the Ark, that is, did accompanie it, Iun. as the next words shew, Ahio went before the Arke. 9. Quest. v. 5. Of Dauids playing vpon instruments of Musicke before the Lord. 1. The instruments of Musicke are described by their matter; they were made of firre tree, some take it for cedar, some for boxe: the word is berash, which vsually is taken for the firre: V.A.P.I. which is an fit wood to make instruments of, as is vsed to this day; the diuerse kinds also of these instruments made of firre are named, as Harpes, Psaltaries, Timbrels. 2. The people of the East countrie as they are more ar∣dent in their affections, so they are more affected with musicke, then they which inha∣bit toward the Northerne parts of the world: and therefore to this day, the Christi∣ans in Syria and in other East countries, doe celebrate the festiuall of Christs resur∣rection with harpes and other instruments, with singing also and dauncing. And by the Epistle of Plinie to Traiane the Emperor, it seemeth that euen from the Apostles times, in sacro vsu habuisse Musicam, that they had a sacred vse of Musicke, euen from the Apostles time. Mar. 3. Beside the custome of the countrie, the pedagogie and con∣dition of those times, which was full of types and shadowes, did commend this pub∣like vse of Musicke in religion: whereby were represented, those cantiones spirituales, spirituall songs, and hymnes, which the Apostle speaketh of: singing and making melo∣die vnto the Lord in your hearts, Ephes. 5.13. Borrh. 4. The vse of these instruments was, that thereby mentes arrigerentur, the mindes of the hearers might be stirred vp to the praise of God: for otherwise God is not delighted with sounds. Pellican. 5.
And thus farre Musicke also hath now a commendable vse in the Church of God: si vtamur ad ipsius laudem, &c. if we vse it to Gods praise, and glorie, and the mind and heart sing together with the voice. Osiander. 10. Quest. v. . Of the ocasion, which mooued Vzzah to stay the Ark with his hand. 1. Because this was a memorable accident, that here fell out, the place is noted, which had a double name: it is here called the theshing floore of Nachon, which signifieth prepared, as Vatablus translateth, arcam paratam, a threshing floore prepa∣red: because by this example and admonition the Luites were as prepared: but 1. Chron. 13. it is named the threshing floore of Chidon: which some thinke was so called, because Ioshua there lift vp his shild or speare, which is so called chudon, Iosh. 8.18. ex Martyr. But it seemeth that the owner of this threshing floore rather had these two names, Nachon, and Chidon, as Araunah whose threshing floore Dauid bought, 2. Sam. 24. was also called Ornan, 1. Chron. 21.20. 2. The oxen, which drew the art, some read exorbitabant, went out of the way: Ioseph. Lat. Osiander. some read, that the oxen fainted as vnder the burthen of the Ark, because of the reuerence, and holinesse of it: Vatab: out of a certaine Hebrew writer: some that the oen stumbled or kicked. Plli. But the word is better translated, they did shake it: B.G. Iun. like to cast and tumble it downe: so the word samat is vsed, 2. King. 9.33. where Iehu biddeth them tumble, or cast downe Iezabel. 3. Thus it pleased God by these umbe beasts to admonish them of their error: as the Lord reprooued Balaam by opening the mouth of his asse. Mar. 11. Quest. v. 7. Why the Lord smote Vzzah, and how. 1. Some of the Rabbines thinke that Vzzah was smitten, because when he saw the Arke declining he had such an inward thought, as though God were not able to stay it: but no such thing is in the text: Petrus Camestr gesseth it wa, for that hee had companied with his wife the night before: which concei riseth of their prophane and base opinion of marriage, which the Apostle calleth honourable: the cause is euident out of the text, because they had put the Arke into a cat, wheres it was to be caried vpon the Leuites shoulders: Mar. and because beeing no Priest, he touched the Arke, which it was not lawfull for the Leuites to doe: Osiand. both these causes are rende∣red of this iudgement, the first 1. Chron. 15.3.14. the other 1. Chron. 13.10. 2. How Vzzah was smitten, it is not expressed: some thinke he was striken with a thunderbolt: Hierome is of opinion, that his shoulder and arme wa suddenly withe∣red and dried vp, because he should haue borne the Arke vpon his shoulder:De mirabilib. Script. lib. 2. c. 12. Augustine thinketh he was presently suffocated, & so died, as they which are taken with an apo∣plexie: but it seemeth it was a violent death, and that by some rent, rupture, or diuisi∣on of his bodie: as the place was thereupon called Perz Vzah, the rent, breach, or diuision of Vzzah. 3. Vzzah is smitten here, whereas the Philistims were not punished at all for car∣ting the Arke: for they knew not the law of God, and therefore were excused by their ignorance: but the Israelites, if they transgressed the law, did it of carelesse negligence and forgetfulnesse, as Vzzah here, and therefore this punishment is laid vp∣on him: Pellican. 4. And Vzzah is smitten rather then Ahio, not as Hierome thinketh, if hee be the author of the traditions vpon the Chronicles: bcause Abinadab had Vzzah carie the Arke vpon his shoulders, and he refused: Mar. But though Ahio with the rest of the Priests and Leuites were all guiltie of the first fault in putting the Arke into a cart: yet this fault was peculiar to Vzzah, in that he presumed to touch the Arke, which it was not lawfull for the Leuites to doe, Num. 4.11. and therefore he was smitten▪ and not Ahio. Iun. 12. Quest. v. 7. Of th right vse, which is to be made of this iudge∣ment vpon Vzzah. 1. The Pope grossely abused this place, against the Emperour, who hauing made some constitutions in Germanie concerning rligion, and namely that of the interim,
was threatned by the Pope with the vengeance that did light vpon Vzzah, for med∣ling with things that appertained not vnto him. But therein the Emperour did no more then other godly Kings before him, Salomon, Esechias, Iosias, and those Chri∣stian Emperours Constantine, Theodosius, Honorius, Arcadius. Mart. 2. But this example hath this application rather. 1. It condemneth all will-wor∣ship and humane deuises brought into the seruice and worship of God: as Nadab and Abihu were slaine for offering with strange fire. 2. It teacheth v, ne in alienam functi∣onèm nos ingreamus, that we intrude not our selues into an others function: as Vzzia the King was smitten with leprosie, because he tooke vpon him to offer incense. Osi∣ander. 3. The Arke also signifieth the Scripture, quae non est illotis manibus tractanda, which must not be handled with vncleane hands. Pellican. 4. It sheweth also that a good intention, declining from the prescript of Gods word, is not acceptable to the Lord: Osiander. For Vzzah here of a good meaning staied the Arke with his hand, but because it was against the Law, it displeased the Lord. 13. Quest. Why Dauid was displeased. 1. Whereas the words in the originall are, Dauid was angrie: or anger was to Da∣uid: some take it, that Dauid was angrie not with the Lord, for God could not be ac∣cused of iniustice here, and it was farre from Dauid to lay any such imputation vpon God: but he was angrie with the negligence of the Preists, and his owne ouersight, in such an apparant transgression of the Law: Mart. 2. But the text giuing this rea∣son, because the Lord hath smitten Vzzah; sheweth that this indeed was the cause of Dauids greife: therefore the meaning is, that displicuit Dauidi, it displeased Dauid: I.G.B. or Dauid was mooued and troubled, as Samuel was mooued, when the Lord had cast off Saul, and cried vnto the Lord all night, 1. Sam. 15.11. where the same phrase is vsed. 3. As Dauid was mooued and troubled, so it is said, Dauid feared the Lord that day: which both sheweth, that Dauid setting before him the like punish∣ment vpon the Philistims first, then vpon the Bethshemites for their irreuerent be∣hauiour toward the Arke, feared the like punishment himselfe, and therefore durst goe no further with the Arke: Mart. And beside it made Dauid more carefull after∣ward, nihil tentare praeter doctrinam legis, to attempt nothing beside the doctrine of the Law. Pellican. 14. Quest. Whether Dauid did well in going no further with the Arke. 1. Some think that Dauid was herein ouerseene; and though he were an holy man, yet he was not without his faults; for if he were assured that it was the Lords will to bring the Arke to Ierusalem, he should not haue giuen ouer notwithstanding this crosse successe: and if he were not, he should neuer haue begunne, and taken it in hand: Mart. 2. To the same purpose Osiander, that Dauid exceeded a due measure in this his feare, in that he sendeth away the Arke from him: as many now a dayes, be∣cause they thinke themselues vnworthie to receiue the Sacrament, do along time for∣beare, and will not receiue it at all. 3. But Dauid herein rather obeyed, as it seemed to him the Lords will, which hee might thinke, was not at this time that the Arke should be brought to his house, as was declared by this fact: Iun. so aguoscit se indig∣num, &c. he acknowledgeth himselfe vnworthy, with whome the Arke, which was the seat of God, should remaine and dwell. Pellic. 15. Quest. v. 10. Of the leauing of the Arke in the house of Obed Edom the Gittite. 1. The most doe thinke, that this Obed Edom is called a Gethite or Gittite, be∣cause he had sometime soiourned with Dauid, or vpon some other occasion in Gath a citie of the Philistims: Pellic. Vatab. and it might be he fled thither, when Saul put the Priests to death: Mart. But he was so called of Gath Rimman, one of the cities gi∣uen in common by the tribe of Manasses, and of Dan to the Kohathites the Leuits, Iosh. 21.24. Iun. 2. And with him the Arke is left, not that Dauid forced him to take the Arke, and so would turne the daunger vpon an other, which he feared. But it see∣meth rather, that Obededom dwelling in the way, and beeing a good man, and also a Leuite, that he was willing to giue entertainement vnto the Arke: Osiand. Martyr.
Rupertus thinketh that Dauid as yet knew not the cause, why the Lord smote Vzzah; but that is not like, for it appeareth by Dauids feare, saying, how shall the Arke of the Lord come vnto me, that he knew well, that Vzzah was smitten for some fault com∣mitted about the Arke. 16. Quest. v. 12. What mooued Dauid to bring the Arke from the house of Obededom. 1. God had blessed the house of Obededom and all that he had, because of the presence of the Arke, which he vsed with great reuerence: no such thing is expressed of Abinadab, in whose house the Arke was many yeares, either because it is omitted in Scripture, as many things of fact are: or it may be the Arke was not with like re∣uerence there entertained. Mart. 2. This was a great alteration and change, that whereas the Lord punished be∣fore, he now blesseth: but this change was not in God, who is immutable and alwaie the same, but in them that carried themselues diuersely towards the Lords arke: Vz∣zah was punished for his want of reuerence, Obededom is rewarded for his obe∣dience. 3. Thus the Lord honoureth those that honour him, and his seruants for his sake: Laban was blessed after Iaacobs comming vnto him; and Potiphar because of Io∣seph. 4. Dauid therefore hearing the report of Obededoms prosperitie, now seeing all feare of danger past, taketh vnto him a good heart, & resolueth to remooue the arke: Osiand. Likewise though God be not to be serued, or his presence to be desired for a∣ny earthly blessings; yet the Lord propoundeth such temporall rewards to stirre vp our dulnes: and Dauid is the rather mooued in this behalfe to bring the Arke home vnto him, that these outward things might bee testimonia quaedam voluntatis Dei, &c. certain testimonies of the will of God toward him: Mar. But the cheife reason which mooued Dauid to remooue the Arke, was because nowe hearing of Obededom his welfare and prosperitie by entertaining the Arke, nihil mali veritus, he feared no fur∣ther euill or danger: Ioseph. l. 7. c. 4. 17. Quest. v. 16. Why they sacrificed, when they had gone sixe paces. 1. The Rabbines thinke, that they sacrifice now at six paces, because Vzzah was smitten, when they had gone six paces: but whether that were so or not, as soone as they set forward and perceiued, that God was present with them, and none of them were smitten, they offered sacrifice in signe of thanksgiuing. Pellican. 2. Some of the Hebrewes thinke, that the Leuites felt not the Arke heauie as they did beare it, and therefore beeing mooued with this miracle they sacrificed: but it is dangerous deui∣sing miracles without Scripture. 3. It is most like that he which was set ouer the Le∣vites, who caried the Arke by turnes, appointed them their stations, how farre the parties or bearers should goe before they rested, which was six paces: therefore it is said, 1. Chron. 15.26. when the Lord eased and helped the Leuites, that is, when they rested them, at the appointment of Chenamah, who was set ouer them, 1. Chron. 15.22. then they offered sacrifice. 4. And, they offered these sacrifices vpon some Altar made vpon the suddaine, either of earth, or of rough stone according to the law, Exod. 20.24. Iun. 5. The cause why none of them were now smitten was, for that the for∣mer fault and ouersight was redressed, the Leuites now did beare the Arke vpon their shoulders according to the Law, 1. Cor. 15.14. 18. Quest. v. 13. How many bullockes and fat beasts they offered. Here the text saith they offered a bullocke and a fat beast, that is, but one: but 1. Chron. 15.26. it is said they offered seauen bullockes, and seauen rammes. 1. Some to reconcile these places thinke,Reconcil. that the Preists offered these seauen bullockes and seauen rammes, beside the bullocke and fat beast, which Dauid offered: Genevens. an∣not. 1. Chron. 15.26. but the same offering is spoken of in both places, because the same occasion is touched, when the Leuites rested, and had gone six paces. 2. Iunius readeth here in the plurall, they offered bullockes and fat beasts: and so it may agree with
the other number of seauen bullocks, and seauen rammes: but seeing the words are here put in the singular number, they are not fitly translated in the plurall, there bee∣ing no such necessitie. 3. I approoue rather Osianders solution: who thinketh that there were certaine stations, which are called paces, at the end of six of them the Le∣uites set downe the Arke, and others carried in their place: and at the end of euery six of these stations, they offered a bullocke, and a ramme: and this they did seauen times till they came to the Citie of Dauid: So in all at these seauen seuerall times they offered seauen bullockes, and seauen other fat beasts, that is rammes; for at euery six spaces or stations ende, they offered a bullocke, and an other beast. 19. Quest. v. 14. Of Dauids daunsing. 1. It was the custome and vse of the seruants of God, when they would shew their exceeding ioy, to expresse the same with their outward gesture, and that with daunsing: as Elias, when the raine came, that had beene restrained three yeare and six monthes,1. King. 18 46. did gird vp his loines, the Spirit of God beeing vpon him, and ranne before Ahabs chariot. 2. But whereas there are diuerse kinds of daunsing; as there is a graue motion of the bodie, which sometime is vsed by the Auncient: and there is a wanton and light kind of daunsing: this gesture, which Dauid vsed in leaping and stirring his bodie, was of the first sort. 3. Beside, his example was extraordinarie: for otherwise it might haue seemed not befitting the person of a King to daunce in pub∣like view, and sight: as Nero and Caligula among the Romans, were blamed of all for dauncing publikely in the theater, beeing Emperours: when Kings and publike per∣sons are mooued by the like spirit, they may doe as Dauid did: otherwise they must vsitata ratione Deum colere: worship God after the vsuall, and ordinarie manner. Mar. 20. Quest. v. 14. Of the linen Ephod, that Dauid was girded with. 1. Osiander thinketh, that Dauid was so addicted to the seruice of God, that hee put on a preistly garment: he taketh it to be such a linen Ephod, as the inferior preists vsed to weare: as 1. Sam. 21.18. But Dauid hauing beene so lately taught by Vzzahs presumption, who beeing but a Leuite medled with the preists office, in touching the Arke, would not aduenture to were those garments which were peculiar vnto preists. 2. Neither yet was it a meere ciuill garment, such as they which are preists or Leuites did sometime weare, honoris causa, for honour sake: Borrh. for Dauid as it were aba∣sing and humbling himselfe in the sight of God, as he saith, v. 22. I will yet be more vile then thus, did lay aside in all likelihood his garments of honour and state. 3. I thinke it therefore more probable, that it was neither a preistly garment, nor yet altogether ciuill or prophane: but such as vulgus Deo deuoturum, they which were deuoted vnto God, though they were neither Leuites, nor preists, did vse in the seruice of God, & religious actions: See more of the Ephod, 1. Sam. c. 2. qu. 5. and c. 22. qu. 13. So Da∣uid here did not shew himselfe as a Preist, as they say Charles the 5. in his solemne in∣auguratiō at Bononia did put on a linen vesture to please the Papal societie, as though he were consecrated one of their preists: but he put it on not onely to be the lighter, and to daunce the more nimbly, Mart. but to shew his deuotion. 4. Yet did he not strippe himselfe of his princely robes, as thinketh Mart. as Saul was naked before the Prophets, that is, hauing laid aside his princely robes: for vnder the linen Ephod, he had a silke cloake or robe; for so it is said, that he had a silke robe, and then vpon that a linen Ephod, 1. Chron. 15.17. Some doe there read in the first place a linen gar∣ment, as Vatab. Genevens. but the word is butz, which signifieth silke, and the other bar, linen: he had therefore a long silke robe, and vpon that a linen Ephod, which was girt vnto him, and kept the other garment cloase from flying abroad. Osiand. annot. 1. Chron. 15. 21. Quest. v. 17. Of the Tabernacle where Dauid placed the Arke. 1. This was not the Tabernacle, which Moses had made, where the Altar of burnt-offering was; for that was now at Gibeon, 1. Chron. 22.29. but it was a Taber∣nacle, which Dauid had prepared of purpose for the Arke, before he brought it thi∣ther,
1. Chron. 15.1. Mar. Borrh. 2. Peter Martyr doubteth whether the great Ta∣bernacle at this time in Gibeon, were the same which Moses had set vp 200. yeare before (yea 400. yeare) in the desert: but it is euident 1. Chron. 21.29. that it was the same Tabernacle, which Moses had made in the wildernesse: which might not∣withstanding be repaired, and renewed, as there was need. 3. Dauid maketh a Ta∣bernacle for the Arke, rather then any permanent building, because he had now set it downe in his mind to build the Lord an house, which was afterward performed by Salomon. Mar. 22. Quest. v. 18. Of Dauids blessing the people. 1. Though it be not like, that Dauid here, and Salomon who blessed the people also at the consecration of the Temple, vsed that forme of blessing, which is prescri∣bed, Numb. 6.24. The Lord blesse thee, and keepe thee, which onely was appointed for the Preists to vse: yet Dauid after some other holy manner blessed the people, and wished well vnto them. 2. And he doth not onely wish well vnto them in words, but performeth the same also vnto them in deeds; making a feast vnto all the people, he gaue vnto euery one, a cake of bread, and a peece of flesh, and a bottle of wine: Iosephus omitteth the wine, and speaketh of a wafer cake, beside the bread, that should be giuen vnto euery one: but the text is of more credit with vs. 3. Dauid did not shew such bountie when he was confirmed in the kingdome by the people, c. 5. to shew that he more reioyced in the true worship of God, then in the honour of his kingdome: Mart. 4. Dauid here executeth part of the preistly, part of the princely office: hee blesseth as a Preist, and giueth bountifully to the people as a King. So Melchisedech both blessed Abraham, and brought forth bread and wine vnto him: herein then Dauid was a type and figure of the Messiah, both king and preist, after the order of Melchisedech. Borrh. 23. Quest. v. 20. Of Michols deriding of Dauid. 1. Michol who should haue met the King her husband, as the part of kind and dutifull wiues is, with amiable salutations, doth at the very first shew her scornefull heart toward him. Osiand. Iosephus thinketh that she commended all other things, but onely findeth fault with him for his dauncing: but the text maketh mention one∣ly of her words of reproach, not of any commendation at all: It seemeth rather, that she which scorned him before in her heart looking out at a window, v. 16. could not containe her selfe, but must needs goe forth to meete him to tell him her mind. Mart. And whereas Dauid came to blesse his house, she through her foolishnes turneth his blessing into a curse. Borrh. 2. She is called the daughter of Saul, because indeed herein, refert ingenium patris, she did shew the qualitie of her father. Iun. he was an hypocrite, and vaine glorious, and sought onely the praise of men: whereas Dauid referreth all vnto Gods glorie: Pellican. yet in the meane time shee forgetteth, how her father Saul had in like sort behaued himselfe among the prophets, prophecying naked, that is, without his prince∣ly robes before them, 1. Sam. 19.24. Mar. 3. There are three parts of Michols scornefull reprehension, 1. because he had for∣gotten himselfe that day, not retaining his princely dignitie: and therefore she taun∣teth him with an ironicall speach: how glorious was the King of Israel this day? 2. Be∣cause he had vncouered himselfe in the eyes of the handmaides: not that either of purpose Dauid shewed his bare and naked bodie in dauncing, beeing verie bewtifull, as some thinke: or that his bare flesh was seene, vestibus ex tripudio diffluentibus, his garments in dauncing flying abroad, Osiander, so also Iosephus: but for that he had shewed light behauiour, not beseeming the grauitie of a King, in so much, that the very maides scorned him, and made iests of him. 3. Because he had so carried him∣selfe, that there was small difference betweene him, and a foole, that leapeth and daunceth vp and downe, or like vnto some vile person, that will be hired for a little to leape and skippe to mooue sport. Mar. 4. After this manner deale the carnall men of this world, which hold the zeale of
Gods seruants to be but foolishnesse: Borrh. and the pompous prelates and Abbots of the Romanists, which ride vpon their mules, beeing accompanied and attended vp∣on as Princes, doe vpon the like ground, despise the pouertie and simplicitie of the ministers of the Gospel: Mart. 24. Qest. v. 23. Of Dauids defence and answer vnto Michol. 1. Michol at once committed a treble fault, she derided Dauid, beeing both king, and a Prophet, and her husband: and her reproachfull speech redounded to the dis∣honour of God, and therefore Dauid iustified that which he had done: Mar. 2. Da∣uids defence consisteth of these three parts: for as Michol had obiected three things, vncomelines in not behauing himselfe as a King, that he had exposed himselfe to the scorne of the maids, and made himselfe equall vnto vile and base fellowes: Dauid an∣swereth vnto euery part, 1. He did this before the Lord, before whom Kings are as other men: and therefore it was no dishonour vnto him, so to abase himselfe in the presence of the King of kings. 2. Remembring the mercie which he had re∣ceiued of the Lord, in preferring him before Saul and his house, hee could not shew himselfe too vile and low in his owne eyes, to testifie his thankfulnesse vnto God. O∣siander. 3. And he would still more humble himselfe, and by this meanes he should be honoured not onely of the maides, from among whom he afterward tooke wiues and concubines: Osiand. but of all the Israelites, whom she called his seruants, euen with them, ghimmam, which beeing in the masculine, must be referred to the men, not to the women: Iun. yea not onely of Israel, but of all other nations shall I be had in honour: Pellican. according to that saying, 1. Sam. 2.30. them that honour mee, will I honour. Iun. 3. Thus our Blessed Sauiour beeing derided and scorned vpon the crosse, was more exalted in his glorious resurrection. And when Theodosius the Em∣perour laying aside his Imperiall maiestie, submitted himselfe to publike penance, though hee might for the present be derided, yet to this day is more honoured. In like manner the seruants of God, that are despised in this world, shall receiue hon∣our and praise of God, in that day, in despight of all those, which before scorned, and derided them. 25. Quest. v. 23. Of Michols punishment for deriding Dauid, she had no child vnto the day of her death. 1. Some Hebrewes thinke, that she had a child at the time of her death, and died thereof, as Rachel did, and as the wife of Phinehes the sonne of Heli: But this phrase vntill the day of her death, is as much in effect as neuer, and it putteth in a perpetuall barre: as 1. Sam. 15.35. it is said, Samuel came no more to see Saul, till the day of his death, that is, neuer. 2. Some thus vnderstand this place, that from this time, wherein she shewed such contempt, she had neuer after any children; but before she might haue: for they sup∣pose that this Michol is the same, which is called Eglah, c. 3.5. whose sonne by Dauid was Ithream: Borrh. but that Eglah and Michol were not the same, as is shewed be∣fore, cap. 3. qu. 4. 3. Iosephus saith, that Michol had fiue sonnes before by an other man, but none by Dauid: but those fiue sonnes said to be Michols, were not hers but her sister Merabs: who, and not Michol, was married to Adriel; for Michol was giuen vnto Phaltiel: therefore where it is said, the fiue sonnes of Michol, &c. which she bare to Adriel: there must be supplied, the Sister of Michol, as shall be shewed in that place. 4. Therefore it is better vnderstood according to the vse of the phrase, that perpe∣tuae sterilitatis opprobrio affecta est, shee was opprobrious for her perpetuall barrennes: Iun. so they which deride the Church of God, shall be for euer barren and fruitlesse of any good worke.
CHAP. 7. 1. Quest. v. 1. How Dauid is said to haue rest round about from all his enemies. DAuid had many battells with the Moabites and Ammonites, and with other for∣ren nations, as is expressed c. 8. c. 10. and in other places. 1. Therefore some doe expound these-words of the peace and rest, which Dauid now presently enioyed: so Osiander saith, that at this time, magna tranquillitate respublica Israelitica fruebatur, the Commonwealth of Israel enioyed great tranquillitie. 2. Some doe referre it to Da∣uids peaceable possession of the kingdome, wherein he was now established without any resistance. Pellican. 3. But D. Chimhi better vnderstandeth this rest, from those warres which the enemies prouoked Dauid vnto: the battels which Dauid afterward fought, he rather made with his enemies, oblata diuinitus occasione, as God gaue occasi∣on: they did not prouoke him. Borrh. Mart. 2. Quest. v. 2. Of Dauids purpose to build God an house. 1. Dauid knew well enough, that God dwelled not in houses made with hands, neither that any Temple could be made to comprehend his maiestie: yet because the Arke was a visible symbole of Gods presence, he thought, that the reuerent enter∣tainment thereof tended to Gods honour. 2. And this desire of Dauid, as all other good thoughts and purposes proceeded from the spirit of God: Pellican. onely Dauids ouersight was this, because he would runne before the Lords commandement. Mart. 3. Yet this worthie lesson is learned from Dauid, that men should not be more addi∣cted to the setting forth of their owne pompe, and garnishing of their owne houses, and in the meane time neglect the place of Gods seruice: as the Prophet Hagge re∣prooueth the Iewes, because they themselues dwelled in sicled houses,Hagg 3.4. and suffered the house of God to lie wast. 4. Dauid also in not resting vpon his owne counsell, though he were a wise and holy man, but tooke counsell with Nathan the Prophet, therein is an example vnto Princes and Magistrates, to consult and aduise with wise and religious men. Mar. 3. Quest. v. 3. How Nathan was deceiued in approouing Dauids purpose. 1.D. Chimhi thinketh, that Dauid dealt with Nathan, as the Lords Prophet, and would haue him aske counsell of God for him: but it seemeth rather, as Lyranus thin∣keth, that he consulted priuately with him, as his friend, and an holy man: for other∣wise he would not haue giuen him this present answer, if he had purposed to aske counsell of God for him. 2. Therefore Dauid onely in familiar manner consulting with him, Nathan maketh him an answer, not as a Prophet, but as one giuing priuate aduise: for the Prophets had not alwaies the spirit of prophesie vpon them, but spake sometime as priuate men: as Samuel, when Eliab Dauids eldest brother came before him, thought at the first, that he was the Lords annointed: So Elisha said, when the Shunamite lay at his feete, beeing grieued for the death of her sonne,2. King 4.24. The Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me, &c. 3. Nathan was herein deceiued, because he sawe that God was with Dauid, that therefore he could not be deceiued: he reasoneth, as they say in Schooles, à dicto secundum quid, ad simpliciter, because God was with him at this time, and prospered him in some things, therefore he was with him in all. Mart. 4. This teacheth vs, that we should not ascribe too much to the worthines, or digni∣tie of any, as though they could not erre; as here Nathan seemeth to be perswaded of Dauid. 4. Quest. v. 5. How God notwithstanding Dauids vow, will not haue him build him an house. 1. Dauid, as here he consulteth with Nathan about building of God an house, so he earnestly vowed the same: as Psal. 132.2. it is said, He sware vnto the Lord, and vow∣ed to the mightie God of Iacob: I will not enter into the Tabernacle of mine house, &c. nor
suffer mine eyes to sleepe, &c. vntill I find out a place for the Lord: this vow some thinke, that Dauid made after the great plague, when he offered sacrifice vnto God in the threshing floore of Arauna: but it is not like that Dauid would make such a vow, the Lord hauing signified what his will was therein before by the Prophet Nathan: it seemeth therefore, that at this time he bound himselfe by that vow. Mart. 2. And whereas Dauid voweth, that hee will not sleepe nor climbe vp into his bed, till hee had found out a place for the Lords house; the meaning is not, that Dauid would alwaies thinke of it, and haue it in minde; for otherwise his naturall infirmitie and frailnesse could not so long endure without sleepe and rest: Mart. But he voweth that he will not take possession of his new habitation, and dwelling place, which hee had made, vntill he had found out an house for the Lord: Iun. 3. But notwithstanding this vow, the Lord forbiddeth Dauid to goe forward in this purpose: he therefore reuoketh and reuerseth his vow:Controv. Whether rash vowes may be broken. for if the father may call backe the vow of his daughter, and the husband of the wife, Numb. 30. much more may the Lord dispense with the vowes of his seruants, which are rashly, or vnaduisedly made: therefore we hold, that all rash vowes, as of single life, voluntarie pouertie, and such like, which are made without warrant of Gods word, by the authoritie of the same word may be reuersed: as God here doth rebuke the hastie vow of Dauid. 5. Quest. Wherefore the Lord would not haue Dauid build him an house, v. 6. 1. The first reason which the Lord vseth, is in respect of himselfe, that he had dwelt in no house since he brought Israel out of Egypt, and yet he was present with Israel, and contented himselfe to dwell in tents; he was all this while notwithstanding their Almightie God: therefore in respect of himselfe, there was no cause why Dauid should be so carefull to make God an house. 2. Againe, in respect of Dauid himselfe there was iust cause, seeing there were ma∣ny Princes and Gouernours before him, vnto whom the Lord gaue no such comman∣dement, neither was he angrie with them for not building the Lord an house: Dauid therefore should not thinke, that it concerned him more, then any of the rest, which went before him. 3. An other reason is yeelded by Salomon, 1. King. 5.3. why it pleased not God, that Dauid should build him an house, because he had warre with the nations round about, and therefore he had no leisure nor opportunitie to enterprise such a great worke. 4. And beside, Dauid himselfe sheweth that the Lord forbad him to build him an house, because he was a man of warre, and had shed blood, 1. Chron. 28.3. not as though it had beene vnlawfull for Dauid to fight the Lords battels, or that he had beene defiled therewith: but because the building of the Temple, was a type of the spirituall building of the Church by Christ, the Prince of peace, it was requisite, that the Temple should be built by peaceable Salomon, that the figure and shadow might be correspondent to the bodie. 5. But this was no cause, as the Romanists imagine, because Dauid by shedding of blood, and waging of battell, became irregular: for then many of their Popes, which haue beene warriers and warlike men, should haue beene irregular; yea, and many of the founders of their Abbyes, which had beene murtherers, should haue much more incurred the same censure; for Dauids warres were iust, but they killed vniustly. Mar. 6. But in that God would not suffer Dauid to build him an house, we see that ce∣remonies are of no vertue or force, but as they haue their strength from the word of God: and therefore Ieremie reprooueth the hypocrites of his time, for hauing such confidence in the materiall Temple: who thought whatsoeuer sinnes they were guil∣tie of, that they were deliuered in comming to the Temple, Ierem. 7.10. Mart. 6. Quest. Whether Dauids desire to build God an house, were simply in it selfe acceptable. 1. That Dauid did well therein, and that the Lord was well pleased with his in∣tent and purpose, Salomon sheweth, 1. King. 8.18. so that generally in it selfe it was a good purpose and desire: but yet failed herein, because hee had no
particular direction from Gods word to doe it: for God may approoue some acts, which notwithstanding he will not haue done at all times and seasons. 2. True it is, that the Lord purposed to haue an house built, as is euident, Deut. 12.11. but the circumstance of time, and place, beeing not expressed, they were to waite for further direction and warrant from God: for it is not in these ceremoniall pre∣cepts, as in morall; for where any morall precept is generally propounded, it must be executed without expecting any other commandement; as the Apostle saith, Philip. 4.8. Whatsoeuer things are true, whatsoeur things are honest, whatsoeuer things are iust, &c. thinke of these things: but ceremonies and sacraments, must haue a particular in∣stitution from God: of which kind the building of the temple was. 3. And though Dauid here be inhibited to build Gods house, yet the Iewes in Haggies time were worthely reprooued for their negligence therein: not that God is contrarie to himselfe, in forbidding and commanding the same thing: but the reason of the difference is, because Dauid had no word of God to warrant this enterprise: but the Iewes were commanded by the Prophets, and so had the word of God, which they stubburnely disobeyed. 7. Quest. v. 7. Whether these words are well translated, spake I one word with any of the tribes? 1. Most of the Interpreters so translate the word shibtez, tribes, as S.L.C.V. with the rest. 2. But it is better translated by a Synecdoche, Iudges, or gouernours: the word properly signifieth, scepters: where the scepter beeing an adiunct of the go∣uernment▪ is taken for the gouernours themselues: Iun. And that this reading is best, these reasons may show: because it is so expounded, 1. Chron. 17.6. where this place is rehearsed thus, spake I one word to any of the Iudges of Israel▪ &c. 2. And beside, the words following here confirme the same sense, whom I commanded to feede my people: but they were the Iudges, not the tribes, whom the Lord commanded so to doe. 3. v. 11. the Lord also saith, since the time that I commanded Iudges ouer my people. 4. And there is great affinitie and similitude in the words, betweene shibtee, and shophtee. 8. Quest. v. 8. Why the Lord maketh mention, that he tooke Dauid from the sheepcoate. The Lord to a diuerse end remembreth this here, then afterward, when he had committed that sinne in the matter of Vriah: where the Lord rehearsing the benefits which he had done for him, as how he had anointed him King ouer Israel, and deliue∣red him out of the hand of Saul, c. 12.7. vpbraideth Dauid for his vnthankefulnesse. But here, 1. the Lord by putting Dauid in mind of these benefits, he thereby doth in∣courage him, not to thinke that this inhibition to goe forward in his purpose to build God an house, proceeded from any disfauour, seeing he had heaped so many bles∣sings vpon him: but that the Lord had another meaning in it. Mart. Osiand. 2. And beside, hereby the Lord doth stil keepe him in hope, that he will haue an house built, though not by him, nor at that time. Borrh. 3. And the Lord here also to this end ma∣keth a rehearsall, and commemoration of these benefits, therein commending and setting forth Dauids thankefulnesse, that in a thankefull remembrance thereof, would haue erected an house vnto the Lord: placet Dauidis institutum & gratitudo; Dauids purpose and thankefulnesse, is pleasing vnto God. 4. And the Lord by rehearsing how Dauid was called to the place of gouernment, saith thus much in effect vnto him: reliquam partem officij exequere, execute the other part of thy office, Iun. thou hast other matters of the kingdome wherein thou maiest occupie thy selfe, be secure for this. 5. Fowre benefits the Lord rehearseth, which he had done for Dauid: 1. his ex∣altation from so lowe and meane an estate: 2. Gods continuall assistance, as when hee encountered Goliah, went against the Philistims, and tooke 200. of their foreskinnes. 3. God destroied all his enemies, as Saul, Doeg, and the rest. 4. And made his name famous, and renowned all abroad. And therefore as God had hither∣to blessed him, so hee would not leaue him: hee should not then thinke, that the Lord had refused him in this worke, as though his fauour were chaunged toward him. Mart.
9. Quest. v. 10. How the Lord is said to plant his people now, which was done long before. 1. Some thinke that this promise for Dauids sake was peculiarly made to Ierusa∣lem, but the text is euident, that the Lord intendeth this blessing here promised to all the people of Israel. 2. And whereas the Lord had planted them before in the land of Canaan, D. Chimhi vnderstandeth this promise of the encrease of those former blessings, that the land should be blessed with greater fruitfulnes, and the kingdome with a more sure estate, then before. 3. This planting of the people here spoken of, hath relation also vnto the Temple, which the Lord would cause to be built in a sure place. Osiand. 4. And whereas the people after this were afflicted of the Aramites, the Assyrians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, by whome they were carried into captiuitie: this promise must both be vnderstood by way of comparison, that yet they endured not such afflictions and captiuitie, as in Egypt, and in the time of the Iudges. And these promises haue a condition included, that if they continued in obedience, and kept the law of God, they should enioy these promises; otherwise the Lord doth not so bind himselfe, as to stoppe the course of iustice. Mart. 5. And whereas it will be obiected, that in the daies of Ehud one of the Iudges, the land had rest 80. yeares, which may be compared for length with the peaceable yeares vnder Dauid and Salo∣mon:Iudg. 3.30. it may be answered, that yet those daies are not to be compared with Dauids times: for vnder the Iudges, the Cananites still dwelt among the Israelites, so that their peace was not perfect: whereas they were expelled and finally vanquished by Dauid and Salomon. 6. But these blessings in part fulfilled in Dauid and Salomons raigne, yet haue their full accomplishment spiritually in the Messiah. Borr. 10. Quest. v. 11. How the Lord is said to make Dauid an house. 1. The Hebrew phrase, to make an house, is to giue one issue and posteritie: and so the meaning is, that the Lord would giue vnto Dauid a succeeding posteritie, and an enduring family, which should possesse the kingdome after him. Vatab. 2. This priuiledge was not graunted to any of the Iudges, nor vnto Saul: the Kings of Israel after the kingdome was diuided, had some of them a succession in their posteritie, but it continued not long. Among the Romane Emperours from Iulius Cesar to Antoni∣nus, none of them left a sonne to succeede in the Empire. Vespasian had two sonnes, Titus, and Domitian, which were Emperours after him, but they could not leaue it to their sonnes. 3. The Turkes haue had a succession in one family aboue 250. yeares, but it is by parricide and crueltie, the father killeth the sonnes, one brother an other: but Dauids kingdome continued 400. yeares, in a lawfull gouernment. Mart. 11. Quest. v. 12. What seede the Lord speaketh of, when he saith, I will set vp thy seede after thee, &c. 1. Some thinke, that this promise of the perpetuitie of Dauids kingdome, is whol∣ly to be applied v40 the Messiah, and not at all vnto Salomon. As Augustine would perswade by these reasons: because the Lord promiseth that his kingdome should be for euer,Lib. 18. de ciuit. Dei. c. 10. so was not Salomons: and that he should haue domum fidelem, a faithfull house, which Salomon had not: for he brought strange women, and idolatrie with them vnto his house.Lib. 3. in Luk. Ambrose addeth further, that Salomon was anointed King, his father yet liuing, whereas the Lord speaketh of Dauids seede, which he would set vp after him. Contra. 1. The eternitie of this kingdome was indeed fulfilled in Christ: but yet the other may be, and are vnderstood of Salomon. 2. By a faithfull house, is meant a sure & stable house: for the word neman, signifieth both. 3. Though Salomon were anointed King, while his father liued, yet he was onely appointed then to suc∣ceede his father in the kingdome, the gouernment was still in Dauid while he liued. 2. The Iewes doe also vnderstand this prophesie of the Messiah, that he should build a materiall Temple, which should continue for euer: but of Christ they say it can not be meant, for he built no Temple. Contra. As though there is no other Temple, but that which is made of lime and stones? Christ hath built vnto the Lord a spirituall house, the Catholike Church: and so is house taken in Scripture, for a spirituall buil∣ding: as when the Scripture maketh mention of the house of Abraham, Isaak, and Ia∣cob,
they are not so blind and absurd, as to vnderstand it of an externall house. 3. Some againe mislike, that this should at all be applied to the Messiah, obiecting, that when we can not otherwise interpret a place, we runne into allegories. But as al∣legories deuised of man, are vncertaine, and prooue not: so yet such allegories as are warranted by the Scripture, doe make euident demonstration: as that of Ionas, bee∣ing three daies in the bellie of the Whale: and that allegorie of the free woman, and bondwoman, Gal. 4. So likewise this place the Scripture it selfe interpreteth of Christ, as Hebr. 1.5. I will be his father, and he shall be my sonne: these words by the Apostle ar properly applied vnto Christ. 4. Wherefore the safer way, is both to reteine an historicall sense, in ascribing vn∣to Salomon these things, which agree vnto him: and vnto Christ, that which cannot be giuen vnto any mortall man: as that his kingdome shall be for euer, that God will be his father, that his dominion shall be to the endes of the world, that kings shall worship him, Psal. 72. 5. But some things here spoken of, can by no meanes be referred vnto Christ: as these words, v. 14. If he sinne, I will chasten him with the rodde of men: which some not∣withstanding would thus apply vnto Christ: he is said to sinne, because our iniquities were laid vpon him, tanquam ipse iniquè ègisset, as though he had done euill himselfe: Osiand. or because whatsoeuer is in the members, videri possunt aliquo modo pertinere ad caput, may seeme to belong to the head: Mart. And Salomon they say was not thus chastised, because he had a flourishing kingdome. Contra. 1. Though Christ bare our sinnes, and tooke vpon him our transgressi∣ons, and paid the punishment thereof, euen as his righteusnesse is imputed to vs: yet the action of sinne which is personall, can no wayes be imputed vnto Christ; as to say he in any sense sinned, Borrh. 2. The beginning and former part in deede of Salo∣mons kingdome, was glorious and prosperous: but the Lord raised him vp enemies in the end of his dayes, so that he was chastised then with the roddes of men: as Ha∣dad the Edomite, and Rzan, and Ieroboam, 1. King. 12. 3. And that these words are literally and historically vnderstood of the children of God, and not of the blessed Messiah, is euident, Psal. 89.31. If they breake my statuts, and keepe not my commaunde∣ments, &c. then will I visit their transgression with the rodde, &c. yet my louing kindnesse, will I not take from him. 12. Quest. v. 33. How Christs kingdome is said to be for euer. But the Apostle saith, that Christ shall deliuer vp the kingdome vnto his father, when he hath put downe all rule: how then is Christs kingdome said to be for euer? 1. This must be vnderstood, of the oeconomicall kingdome of Christ, which is com∣mitted vnto him, as the Messiah; as in subduing the enemies of his Church, in ma∣king intercession for his seruants, and in perfitting his members: this kingdome hee shall in this behalfe resigne vnto God: for when his mysticall bodie is perfected, and there are no enemies lest to be subdued and conquered, there shall be no longer any vse of that kingdome: Iun. 2. Like as terene kings re appointed to punish euill doers, and to keepe the people in order: but when there shall be no more uill, nor disorder, as in the kingdome of God, there shall be no more vse of any such kings: So the kingdome of Christ in respect of such administaion shall cease, quoad effectum & fructum regnandi, non habet finem: but in regard of the effect and fult of his king∣dome it shall haue no ende▪ Mart. 3. Christ then as he is God, shall raigne for euer with his father: and his humane nature shall for euer possesse that glorie and maiestie, which by vertue of that blessed vnion belongth  it: but that execution and ad∣ministration of his Mediatorship, in perfitting his members, and confounding his e∣nemies shall cease. 13. Quest. v. 17. According to all these words spake Nathan: why Nathan was snt to Dauid, h himselfe beeing a Prophet and of Nathans faithfulnesse. 1. Though Dauid himselfe were a great Prophet, and had receiued most cleare re∣velations from God touching the Messiah, yet it pleased God to direct him in a mat∣ter
of lesse moment concerning the building of the materiall Temple by another Pro∣phet; which the Lord doth to this ende, to shewe what coniunction the Lord would haue betweene the members of his Church, and a mutuall vse and communication of their gifts: as S. Paul at large sheweth by that similitude of the members of the body, how one ministreth to the necessitie of an other, 1. Cor. 12. 2. And Nathan herein sheweth his faithfulnesse, and humilitie, that though he had otherwise aduised Dauid before, yet now hauing receiued other direction from God, he reuerseth his former sentence: the like did Esaias the Prophet, who hauing first told Hezekiah, that he must die, yet beeing so commanded of God, brought him presently a contrarie message, that the Lord had prolonged his dayes 15. yeares. But Ionas was much grieued, and had rather die, then that his threats against Niniueh should not haue taken place. 3. Dauids prudencie also is here commended, who, as many carnall men would haue beene readie to obiect, doth not charge the Prophet with mutabilitie and incon∣stancie, in saying, and vnsaying: But knowing that this alteration came of God, hee doth as willingly heare him now, as he did before: Mart. 14. Quest. v. 18. How Dauid is said to haue sit before the Lord. 1. Some do so vnderstand it, as though Dauid did sit downe and rest himselfe be∣fore the Arke: which they would haue a type of Christs sitting at the right hand of God: Borr. The like vse they had in time past, not to bow the knee btweene the Pasch and Pentecost, to signifie that Christ was ascended into heauen: Mar. but this was somewhat curious. 2. Some thinke that this gesture betokened a quiet minde in Dauid, and prepared for attention: for sometime the prostrating or standing of the bodie doth disturbe the minde: Mart. 3. Vatablus thinketh that this was the priui∣ledge of Kings, that they might pray before the Lord sitting. 4. Pellican noteth, that the gesture of the bodie in prayer is indifferent: sometime Dauid praysed God daun∣cing, sometime lying in his bed, sometime kneeling: there by shewing, that it is the spirit which prayeth, God regardeth not the position and site of the bodie. 5. But the best sense here is, that Dauid did sit, that is, remaine before God, Geneuens. Iun. Osiand. for he continued a long time in this his prayer in the Tabernacle before the Arke: for concerning the gesture of his bodie, Iosephus thinketh he fell downe flatte before the Arke. 15. Quest. v. 19. Of the meaning of these words, This is the Lawe of man Lord God. 1. Some vnderstand it thus, this is the lawe of man, that is, this is the cheife happi∣nesse of man in this life, and the cheife scope that euerie one aimeth at to liue in pro∣sperous state himselfe, and to prouide also for his posteritie: for Dauid had said imme∣diately before, thou hast spoken of thy seruants house for a great hile: Bor. But Dauid did not rest in these temporall blessings, he looked further. 2. Chimhi by law, vnderstandeth condition, or disposition: as if hee should haue said; this is the condition of great men in this world, to haue their honour and pro∣speritie setled in their posteritie: and so he expoundeth it by that place, 1. Chron. 17.17. Thou hast regarded me according to the state of an excellent man, or of high desire: so also Vatab. But as is shewed before, Dauid looked higher then vnto these temporall and terrene blessings. 3. R. Salom. readeth it with an interrogation, is this the lawe and condition of man, that thou shouldest so much respect them? so also read B.G. doth this apper∣taine to man? and they make this the sense: this commeth of thy free mercie, not of any worthinesse in man: Genevens. 4. Pellican also readeth it with an interrogation, expounding it thus, non hoc hu∣manum, sed diuinum beneficium: this is no humane, but a diuine benefit, in that thou hast promised, that all nations shall be blessed in my seed. 5. Iunius interpreteth, ratione humana, after the manner of men, that is, familiariter mecum agis, thou dealest familiarly with me; as one man with an othe: to this pur∣pose also Sa.
6. Rupertus giueth this sense, this is the Law of Adam, that is, we are all the chil∣dren of wrath by nature, not worthy to be thine house. 7. But these words are much better referred vnto Christ, This is the lawe of that (excellent) man: which word excellent is supplied, 1. Cor. 17.17. that is, thou gran∣test me these things, not for any merit or worthinesse in me, but for the worthinesse of that excellent man Christ: Mar. And Osiander doth make this place an euident te∣stimonie of Christ, both God and man, not putting it in the vocatiue case, O Iehouah God, but ioyning all these words together by apposition, this is the lawe of that man Ie∣houah God: in this is the condition of the Messiah, both man and God; but the word Iehoui is taken in the vocatiue case, as Gen. 15.8. yet there is here a manifest reference to Christ: the word is haadam, of that man, the article is put too, to note some excel∣lent and singular man: which title is added, 1. Cor. 17.17. And Daud here hath ma∣nifest reference to the Messiah, because he speaketh of the continuing of his house for euer, v. 19. the next words also following, v. 21. for thy words sake, Iunius vnderstan∣deth of Christ, who is the eternall word of God. 16. Quest. v. 21. Gods owne will the cause of his decree, According to thine owne heart, &c. 1. Like as Gods owne gracious purpose, not any respect of Dauids worthinesse, was the cause of these promises made vnto him concerning the Messiah: Osiander. So the Lord in the election and predestination of his Saints vnto life, respecteth not their workes, but according to his owne heart, and voluntarie decree, hee ordaineth them vnto life: this place then directly maketh against their opinion,Controv. A∣gainst election by workes. who thinke that the decree of election proceeded from the foresight of mens workes. 2. But it will be obiected, that God ordained none to be saued, but such as lead a godly life; true it is, but yet the foresight of their good workes it not the cause of their election vnto life, but an effect and fruit of it: God as he hath appointed the end, so likewise he hath ordained the meanes, tending to that ende: As the Apostle saith, He hath chosen vs in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy, Eph. 1.4. And againe, We are his workemanship, created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, which he hath ordained that we should walke in them, Ephes. 2.10. 17. Quest. v. 13. Of the meaning of these words, Whose Gods went and redeemed them. 1. Some, in that the word eelohim, gods, is here put in the plurall, doe vnderstand it in respect of the opinion of men, who thinke there are many gods: according to that saying of S. Paul, there are many gods and many lords, 1. Cor. 8. but seeing men∣tion is here made of that singular worke of the redeeming Israel out of Egypt, it must be referred to the true God. 2. Chimhi thinketh, that Dauid thus speaketh of God in the plurall for more ho∣nour sake: but this custome of vsing the plurall for the singular for more honour and dignitie sake, was not taken vp in those dayes: and if that had beene the reason, why doth the Prophet Dauid afterward throughout his prayer, vse the singular number speaking vnto God? 3. Some by gods, here vnderstand Moses and Aaron, which went to redeeme the people: Chaldè paraphrast. for so Magistrates and gouernours, are sometime in Scrip∣ture called by the name of Gods: but it is euident, that the Prophet speaketh here of God himselfe: as in the verse following, Thou hast redeemed vnto thy selfe thy ptople Israel. 4. Wherefore this rather is referred to God himselfe the blessed Trinitie, the Fa∣ther, Sonne, and holy Ghost; here both the verbe, and the other word are put in the plurall number, halehu eelohim, the gods went: but 1. Chron. 17.21. the verbe is put in the singular, haloch, and eelohim, gods, in the plurall: This pluralitie of persons is an euident demonstration and proofe of the blessed Trinitie: Mart. whome in the vnitie of essence he said before to be but one, v. 22. and none like vnto him: Osiand. 18. Quest. In what sense it is said, God went and redee∣med them to himselfe. 1. God beeing in himselfe infinite, as he cannot be comprehended and contained
in any place, so neither doth he goe from place to place. But God is said to goe to a place, when it pleaseth him to make some visible demonstration of his presence, as he did by those wonderfull and fearefull works which he shewed in Egypt, when he de∣liuered his people. 2. This also may most fitly bee applyed to the incarnation of the Sonne of God, who then came and visited vs, when he tooke our humane nature vpon him. And so God went and redeemed his people, which was the worke of the whole Trinitie, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost. 3. Yet our nature was assumed onely to the person of the Sonne, not to the per∣son of the Father, or the holy Ghost: the internall workes of the Trinitie as they are called,How the works of the Trinitie are diuided and distinguished, how they are vndiuided are peculiar to the persons, as to the Father to beget, to the Sonne to bee be∣gotten, to the holy Ghost to proceede from them both: but in externall works they ioyne together, as the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost created the world, and whatsoeuer is done in the world by God, is wrought by the vndiuided and ioynt power of the Trinitie. 4. Yet the Sonne of God is onely said to be incarnate, in respect of the worke it selfe: but if the action of his incarnation be considered, therein the whole Trinitie con∣curred: for God gaue his Sonne for the redemption of the world, the holy Ghost o∣uershadowed Marie, when Christ was conceiued: and Christ also is said to haue gi∣uen himselfe, Galat. 2.10. So Ioh. 10.36. the father is said to sanctifie Christ: and, Ioh. 17.19. he saith, I sanctifie my selfe: likewise, Ioh. 2.13. Christ saith, Destroy this tem∣ple, and in three dayes I will raise it vp againe: and the father also is said to raise him vp, Rom. 8.11. Then in the action of the incarnation of Christ, the blessed Trinitie did worke, but opus ipsum, the worke wrought, the incarnation it selfe was appropriated to the person of the Sonne onely: Mart. 5. Further, the diuine essence or nature is to be considered two wayes, either ab∣solutely in it selfe, as it is common vnto the three persons of the blessed Trinitie; and so the diuine essence was not incarnate: or vt est determinata in vna aliqua , as it is determined in some one person: and so the Sonne of God, that person onely was begotten of God, was incarnate and became man for vs, Marboch. in Exod. cap. 37. 6. So God came vnto vs men to redeeme vs: for we should neuer haue come vnto God, vnlesse he had come vnto vs first: Mart. 19. Quest. v. 13. And doe for you great things: to whom Dauid speaketh here. 1. The vulgar Latine readeth, to doe for them great things: but the word is lacham, for you. 2. Pet. Martyr referreth it vnto God, that God did great workes for him∣selfe, to his owne glorie: but the Prophet here speaking of God, saith ver. 24. thou hast redeemed, leca, to thy selfe a people. 3. Therefore, Dauid here by a certaine A∣postrophe, turneth himselfe vnto the people: to doe for you (that is, O Israel) great workes: as it appeareth by the words immediatly following, and terrible for thy land O Lord: Iun. Vatab. And whereas it will be obiected, that Dauid here speaketh a∣lone and apart vnto God, and therefore turneth him not vnto Israel: Mart. that is no good reason: for so Dauid mourning by himselfe ouer Saul and Ionathan, yet spea∣keth vnto Israel, chap. 1.14. O noble Israel, hee is slaine vpon thy high places, &c. 20. Quest. v. 23. Of the meaning of those words: Whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt, the nations, and their gods. 1. Some doe read thus, to doe great things, &c. before thy people, whome thou hast re∣deemed out of Egypt, the nations and their gods: that is, the kinreds and tribes of Israel, and their iudges, which in Scripture are called gods: Vatab. 2. Martyr vnderstandeth it indeede, that God was deliuered with his people, who was as it were afflicted and did suffer with them. 3. The most giue this sense, ioyning it with the next clause be∣fore, Whom thou hast redeemed from the Egyptians, both (from) the nation it selfe, and their gods: for the Lord also iudged the gods of Egypt, when he brought out his people, Numb. 33.4. so Borrh. Pellic. Osiand. Geneuens. 4. But the best interpretation is thus to reade, by supplying a word, (in casting out) before the people, &c. the nations and their
gods: Iun. Septuag. for this word is supplyed, 1. Chron. 17.2. by casting out from the face of thy people, (whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt) the nations: from thence the word legarosh, to cast out, must be borrowed to make vp the sense here. 21. Quest. v. 26. Of Dauids prayer, the manner, matter and scope thereof. 1. The end of Dauids prayer, which he propoundeth, and setteth before his eyes, is the glorie of God; let thy name be magnified: he seeketh nothing else, but the ex∣altation of Gods glorie. 2. The reason which mooued Dauid to pray, was his confi∣dent and sure perswasion of the goodnesse and mercie of God toward him, who had reuealed vnto Dauid this thing, which he prayeth for, the establishing of his house: and he confesseth God both to be able to doe it, and is assured he also will doe it: he is fully perswaded both of his power and truth, saying, v. 28. thou art God, and thy words are true. 3. Thirdly, the thing which Dauid prayed for, is, that the house of thy seruant be established for euer: v. 26. Mart. 22. Quest. Why Dauid prayeth so earnestly for that, which the Lord had promised to doe. 1. Some of Gods promises are conditionall, some are absolute: the promise made to Dauid concerning the Messiah, which should come of his seede was absolute, and so likewise was the continuance of his posteritie vntill the Messiah: for Gods decree herein could not be altered: but the promise of the outward prosperitie of his seede, and the possessing and holding of the kingdome was conditionall, so his sonnes wal∣ked in obedience before God: therefore Dauid prayeth that such grace might be gi∣uen vnto his posteritie, as that they might haue a prosperous gouernment. 2. Further, although God doe certainely purpose to giue those things, which he hath promised, vult tamen interponi media, yet he will also haue the meanes vsed: as our Blessed Sauiour, praying, Father glorifie thy Sonne, did not doubt of his glorifica∣tion: but it became him for our example, to shew his obedience, to pray for the effec∣ting of his fathers will, whereof hee was most assured: and so Dauid prayeth here. Mart. 23. Quest. v. 29. Why Dauid so often repeateth the same thing in his prayer, now let it please thee to blesse the house. 1. Dauid vseth no vaine repetitions in his prayer: for conceiuing great ioy vpon the Lords liberall and gracious promise toward him, and his house, he was so rauish∣ed, that he thought he could not sufficiently expresse his affection: the mind of those which are deuoutly affected, is not contented, semel desiderata postulâsse, we once to aske the things desired. Pellican. 2. But it will be obiected, that our Blessed Sauiour teacheth his Apostles not to vse vaine repetitions, nor many words in their prayers: to this it may be answered: that our blessed Sauiour forbiddeth such vaine & tedious repetitions vpon these two rea∣sons. 1. That they be not like to the Heathen, which thinke to be heard for their much babling sake; men must not thinke to be heard for any merite in their prayers, but of Gods mercie. 2. They must not vse such repetitions, as thinking thereby to informe God of their necessities, and as it were to beat them into his eares: for as our blessed Sauiour there saith, God knoweth before we aske, what things we haue neede of, Mat. 6. in this manner to vse many words in prayer, it is not acceptable vnto God. 3. And further, concerning the length of prayer, no other rule can be giuen, then to looke vnto the affection, and intention of the heart:August. ad Probum. as Augustine hereof thus ex∣cellently writeth: si videmus studiū nostrum & impetū, &c. incipere flaccessere, &c. if we see our desire and earnestnes in prayer to beginne to abate, we must not dull the edge thereof, with much speach: at si attentio nostra erecta sit, non est abrumpenda, but if our intention doe hold out still, our prayer must not be broken off: so he concludeth, oratio multa esse debet, loquutio pauca, our prayer must be much, but our words few, &c. that is, he which prayeth with his heart, though he pray long, is much in prayer, few in words: but he who prayeth with lippe-labour, though his prayer be short, spea∣keth much, and prayeth little. Mart. Dauids prayer then, proceeding from a zealous and deuout heart, though it were much in his desire, was not long in speach.
CHAP. 8. 1. Quest. v. 1. What is meant by Metheg Ammah, which Dauid tooke out of the hand of the Philistims. 1. SOme interpret it, the bridle of bondage: B.G. metheg signifieth a bridle, and am∣math a maid seruant, that is in bondage: Borrh. but the Israelites were not in bondage at this time vnto the Philistims. 2. Some read, the bridle of tribute: L. Pellic. Rupert. but this we refuse for the same reason. 3. The Septuag. thus, hee tooke , the separated part: but the Hebrew word hath no such signification. 4. Some giue this sense, he tooke away the commoditie of the riuer: Chal. or the bridle of the passage of water: Pagn. because the water is by pipes and conduits drawne euerie way as with a bridle: but this signification agreeth not with the word Am∣mah. 5. The best interpretation is, to vnderstand it of the taking of Gath, a cheife city of the Philistims, as may appeare by comparing this place with 1. Chron. 18.1. But the reason of this interpretation is diuersely rendred. 1. Osiander taketh ammah here to signifie a cubite: and so Dauid tooke away the bridle of the arme or cubit, that is, the dominion which the Philistims had ouer Gath, and the townes adioyning. 2. Pet. Martyr thus applyeth it, because the smaller townes are as daughters, and the great citie as a bridle; the meaning is, that Dauid tooke Gath, which was as a bridle to the rest, and the villages hee also tooke as the daughters. 3. But Iunius commeth neerer the sense, taking Ammah here for the proper name of an hill among rhe Philistims, where Gath stood: of which word Amma, and Gor, or Gerar commeth the word Am∣gar, the name of an hilly tract among the Philistims, whereof Plinie maketh mention, lib. 5. c. 13. So then by the bridle of Ammah, is vnderstood Gath, the cheife citie in that hilly coast of the Philistims, which was as a bridle, and defence, and fort vnto all the countrey: Ammah is found also to be the proper name of an hill, cap. 2.24. 6. Here spiritually in Dauids victorie is shadowed forth the spirituall kingdome of Christ, by the power whereof, the bridle of sinne and Sathan is taken away, that they shall haue no more dominion ouer the seruants of God. 2. Quest. v. 2. He smote Moab: Wherefore Dauid smote Moab, whose land the Israelites were forbidden to meddle with when they came out of Egypt. 1. The Hebrewes thinke, that whereas Dauid when he was pursued of Saul, had left his father and mother with the King of Moab, 1. Sam. 22.3. he had put them to death, and therefore Dauid taketh this reuenge of them, in killing two parts of them and sauing the third aliue. But there is no such thing euident in the Scripture: and therefore small credit is to be giuen to such vncertaine narrations. 2. The Israelites were indeede charged not to meddle with the Moabits coun∣trey, nor to prouoke them to battell: For, 1. They were then as friends to Israell; but now by many wrongs, ius fraternitatis infregerant, they had broken and violated that brotherly right and amitie which should haue beene betweene them: Pellic. 2. The Moabites had hired Baalim to curse Israel, and did not releiue them with bread and water, and therefore they were forbidden to make any peace with them. Deuter. 23.6. Afterward in the time of the Iudges, the Moabites oppressed Israel, when the Lord stirred vp Ehud, who killed Eglon king of the Moabites, Iudg. 3. therefore Da∣uid had iust occasion of warre against them: Mart. 3. Though Dauid had receiued some kindnesse at the hands of Moab in the dayes of Saul, either that king was now dead, or Dauid was not in respect of priuate friendship, to spare that whole wicked nation against Gods commaundement: Osiand. 4. And that commandement was gi∣uen to the Israelites then, reseruata subiugatione ad tempora Dauidis, because the sub∣duing of them was reserued for Dauids times: Borrh. 5. And yet although Dauid did put two parts of the inhabitants to the sword, he did it not to take possession of their
countrey, or distribute their lands, but onely made them tributarie: Mart. 3. Quest. v. 2. How Dauid measured Moab with a coard. 1. The most thinke that it is not literally to be taken, as though Dauid did measure them with a line or coard: and therefore thinke, that this is a similitude taken from the measuring of ground; for so the Hebrewes did diuide their inheritance by line: Osi∣and. or from carpenters, that with a line strike their timber, where they purpose to hewe it off: Borrh. And hereby is signified, that Dauid ordained them to destuction, mensura certissima, by a most certaine measure and number: Vatab. and hereby also is shewed into what subiection and seruitude they were brought, as conquerours vse to diuide the land which they ouercome: quae per mensurationum funiculorum adagij mere intelligitur: which their seruitude is vnderstood by this adage or prouerb of measuring by roapes: Pellican. sic eos distribuit ad placitum suum, he doth diuide them at his plea∣sure, as he which measureth ground: Rupert. 2. But there is nothing to the contrarie, why it may not literally bee interpreted, that Dauid did indeede measure them out by line to destruction: as Iunius interpre∣teth, he measured them, that is, their region and countrie with a coard. 1. The Scripture is to be taken according to the literall sense alwaies, where there is no inconuenience to the contrarie, as there is not here. 2. Here is no note of similitude expressed, as with a coard. 3. The description, in that first mention is made of a coard in generall, then it is subdiuided into two coards for destruction, and one cord to saue aliue, rather gi∣ueth that it must be taken literally. 4. The words next following doe approoue this sense: he measured them with a cord, and cast them downe to the ground: that is, he diui∣ded the region into three parts, and cast downe the cities and townes downe to the ground in two parts, and put the inhabitants to the sword: the cities in two parts of the countrie were best allotted out by line and measure: and so the people together with their cities and townes were measured. 4. Quest. v. 3. Of Dauids battell with Hadadezer king of Zabah, and the occasion thereof. 1. This Hadadezer called in the Chronicles Hadarezer, is said to bee king of Sa∣bah, where Iosephus saith the people called Sapheni inhabite, a large countrey beyond Taurus betweene the two Armenias. 2. This Hadadezer, the most thinke, went to recouer his border at the riuer Euphrates, and to inuade Iudea: so Mart. Vatab. B.G. with the rest. Iunius thus interpreteth, when he went to turne backe his hand towards the riuer Euphrates: that is, not when Hadadezer, but when Dauid went to repell the forces of Hadadezer, who was to passe through some parts of Dauids countrey, as he went to fight against Tai the King of Hamath, as is shewed afterward, ver. 10. Iun. But the former interpretation seemeth to be the more agreeable, by comparing this place with that 1. Chron. 18.3. where it is thus said: as he went to establish his hand, or power: which cannot be vnderstood of Dauid, for the border or bounds of his king∣dome yet extended not so farre: Iunius there readeth, when Dauid went, ad inijcien∣dam manum suam, &c. to set or oppose his hand toward Euphrates: but the word iat∣zab, signifieth to settle, to establish, not to oppose or set against: and there he refer∣reth iado, his hand, to Dauid, whereas here he vnderstandeth it of Hadadezer; but it must haue the same sense in both places: likewise there is great affinitie betweene the word Iashab, here vsed, which signifieth to constitute, or place, and iatzab, to settle, establish. 3. It seemeth therefore that Hadadezer rather sought to inuade Dauids bounds, then onely to passe through them; for that had beene no iust occasion of warre: and by this occasion, that prophesie, Genes. 15.18. was fulfilled, that the Lord would giue vnto Abrahams seede that land, euen vnto the great riuer Eu∣phrates.
5. Quest. v. 4. What number of chariots and horses Dauid tooke from Hadadezer. There is mention made, 1. Chron. 18.4. of a thousand charets, and seuen thousand horsemen, and 20. thousand footemen: but here the number is a thousand, seauen hundred horsemen,Reconcil. and 20. thousand footemen. lib. 7. antiq. c 5.1. Iosephus is farre wide, that speaketh onely of fiue thousand horsemen, and 20. thousand footemen: for he agreeth with neither of these numbers. 2. Pet. Martyr thus reconcileth the places; that here onely the principall horsmen are spoken of, which were 1700. in the other place the whole number and multi∣tude. 3. But the best solution is this; that to the first number of a thousand, must be ad∣ded charrets: he tooke a thousand charrets, as it is in the other place, and the same number of a thousand chariots Iosephus also hath: And by 700. horsemen, here wee must vnderstand 700. companies of horsemen, which euery one had tenne: which make in all seauen thousand: see the like, c. 10.18. where it is said that Dauid destroi∣ed seuen hundred chariots of the Aramites: but 1. Chron. 19.18. they are said to bee seuen thousand chariots: which make but 700. companies or bandes, allowing tenne to euery companie: Iun. 6. Quest. v. 4. Why Dauid houghed some of the chariot horse, and reserued some. 1. It is said that Dauid houghed all the chariots, that is the chariot horses, sauing an hundred: this Dauid did, to make them vnfit altogether for the seruice of warre: as Ioshuah did the like by the Lords direction, c. 11.6. It was not lawfull for Dauid to take them all to his owne vse, because the king is directly forbidden to multiplie horses, Deut. 17.16. least they might put their confidence in horses: neither was Da∣uid to destroy them all, because they were not Cherem, that is, anathema, vowed to destruction. Dauid therefore taketh a course betweene both, neither to destroy the horse, nor yet to reserue them for his owne vse, but to hough them, and so make them vnfit for warre, though they might serue for other workes of tillage and husbandrie. 2. Yet Dauid reserueth an 100. chariots, that is, fowre hundred horse: for foure horse went to a chariot, as the Hebrewes gather out of that place, 1. King. 10.29. where it is said, that Salomon gaue 600. shekels for a chariot, that is, an 150. shekels for an horse. These Dauid might reserue for his owne vse; for in respect of the whole ser∣uice of the kingdome, 400. horse were not many: Mart. 7. Quest. v. 5. Of the Aramites that came to aide Hadadezer against Dauid. 1. Iosephus thinketh, that this kings name was Hadad, and that the succeeding kings of Damascus were called by that name; as the kings of Egypt were called by the name of Ptolomees: and that Benhadad the third from this king, was both of the same name and line, who afflicted Israel vnder the raigne of Achab: thus Iosephus reporteth out of Nicolaus an olde historiographer: But it is like rather, that the title and name of Hadad should come from Hadadezer the king of Sabah: Borrh. but seeing there is no certaintie either of the one, or of the other out of the text, wee may so leaue it. 2. This King of Aram or Damascus, here taking part with Hadadezer, and med∣ling with a matter, which appertained not vnto him, looseth his owne libertie: which example should teach Princes how they take in hand any vnlawfull battell: Osiand. As it was the ruine and ouerthrowe of good Iosias, when he went against the King of Egypt, beeing not prouoked. 3. Here now is fulfilled the prophesie of Baalim, That there should rise a scepter of Israel, and smite the coasts of Moab, and destroy all the sonnes of Seth, Numb. 24.17. These Aramites are counted among the sonnes of Seth, because all the posteritie and offspring of Cham perished in the flood: Borrh. 8. Quest. v. 7. How farre it is lawfull to reioyce for the destruction of our enemies. Thai king of Hamath, who had continuall warre with Hadadezer, whome Dauid
had discomfited, sendeth his sonne Ioram to reioyce with him, because his mortall e∣nemie was vanquished, and to enter into league of amitie and friendship with him. It is here then to bee considered, how farre it is lawfull to reioyce in the fall of an e∣nemie. 1. First, in the spirituall fall of an enemie, as into sinne and wickednesse, it is not lawfull to reioyce, but therein we ought much to be grieued, as S. Paul bewayled them, which sinned among the Corinthians, 2. Cor. 12.21. 2. In other temporall calamities, some thinke it is not lawfull to reioyce ouer the ruine of our enemies, as long as the will of God is not reuealed in the iust punish∣ment of such: but when God hath euidently declared his will in the iudging of such, then they hold it lawfull to reioyce: as Moses did triumph in the ouerthrowe of Pha∣raoh, and of the Egyptians in the red Sea. 3. But this matter must otherwise be considered of: for when God doth iudge an enemie, we must consider, whether we ioy therein in respect of our own priuate quar∣rell, or as it concerneth the glorie of God: for it is vnlawfull for vs in any priuate re∣spect to insult ouer our enemies fall: as the wiseman saith in the Prouerbs, Be not glad when thyne enemie falleth, &c. least the Lord see it, and it displease him:Prou. 24.17▪ But if we consi∣der Gods glorie, which was hindred by such enemies, and the Churches common good, then we may reioyce and be thankefull vnto God, that hath therein also toge∣ther iudged our cause; as Dauid gaue thanks vnto God, when he heard of the death of Nabal: But it seemeth that this Thai reioyced onely of a carnall mind, because his enemie was foyled and ouercome. 4. Yea it often falleth out that these two affections of griefe and ioy together may concurre in Gods seruants: that their naturall compassion may be mooued to shewe their sorrow in the calamitie and ruine of their foes; as Dauid mourned for Saul: and yet in respect of Gods glorie, and the truth, which was hindred by such, they may be gladde that they are taken out of the way: as Dauid, no doubt in the ouerthrowe of Saul, did thankefully and humbly acknowledge Gods mercifull and fatherly proui∣dence ouer toward him. 9. Quest. v. 11. Of the spoiles of the Kings, which Dauid consecrated vnto God. 1. In that Dauid consecrateth vnto God the rich spoiles of his enemies, as the gol∣den sheilds, which belonged to Hadadezer, and of the rest, as of Ammon, Moab, A∣ram, Amalech, the Philistims, with the Edomites, together with the vessels of gold and siluer, which Thai sent him, it sheweth that he did not make these warres of a co∣uetous mind, to enrich himselfe, but to prepare ornaments and stuffe for the Lords house. 2. For although he were forbidden himselfe to build it, yet he might prouide matter, which was necessarie for the worke thereof: as the Israelites did bestowe the spoiles of Egypt vppon the Sanctuarie: Mart. 3. Which sheweth, that as, these out∣ward spoiles serued to adorne the materiall temple; so the spirituall spoile of the hea∣then, the inuention of artes and sciences must be converted to the setting forth of the truth: Borrh. 4. Rupertus well applyeth these seuen victories of Dauid, to the seauen vialls of wrath and iudgements, which Christ should bring vppon the world for the contempt of his gospell. 10. Quest. v. 13. How this place that Dauid slewe of Aramites 18. thousand is reconciled with 1. Chron. 18.12. In that place of the Chronicles, it is said that Abishai slewe of the Edomites 18. thousand: and in the title of the 60. Psalme, mention is made how Ioab slewe of the Edomites 12. thousand in the valley of salt: here are three great differences in shew: both in the persons that made the slaughter, one text saith Dauid did it, an other Abi∣shai, the third ascribeth it to Ioab: and in the persons which were slaine, in two of these texts they are named to be Edomites, in one of them Aaramites: thirdly, the number differeth: one place speaketh but of 12. thousand, the other two of 18. thou∣sand. 1. Pellican thinketh that Aram may be taken for Edm, by the mistaking of one letter: for betweene the letter Daleth, and Rhesh, there is small difference: but
we must not so easily admit an error in the originall, where an other answer may bee found. 2. Some thinke that the Aramites and Idumeans did ioyne their forces together, and therefore they are called in one place Aramites, in the other Edomites: Genev. Borrh. But Dauids slaughter of the Aramites is touched before, he slew of them 22. thousand, ver. 5. 3. Pet. Martyr also hath the like solution: that Dauid by his captaines Abishai and Ioab, made ioynt warre with the Aramites and Edomites: whereof Abishai slew sixe thousand, and Ioab 18. thousand: this answer is but in one point excepted against, for that he thinketh that in this number of 18. thousand, the Aramites are comprehen∣ded: which is before shewed to be otherwise. 4. Thus therefore these places are reconciled: 1. For the persons, Dauid is said to haue smitten them, because he did it by his captaines Ioab and Abishai. 2. For the number: Abishai first slewe 6. thousand, and then Ioab renewing the battell twelue thousand more, as it is in the title of that Psalme: so that both the brethren together put to the sword 18. thousand. 3. Concerning the persons: onely the Edomites were slaine: Dauid returned indeede from the slaughter of the Aramites, as the title of the Psalme sheweth: and thus the verse must be read, Dauid got him a name when he retur∣ned from slaying the Aramites, in the valley of salt; (smiting) eighteene thousand: where the last words are diuided from the former sentence by the perfect distinction athnah, and therefore cannot be referred to the Aramites: it must be vnderstood then, that he smote 18. thousand of the Edomites: as it followeth in the next verse, he put a garrison in Edom: Iun. 11. Quest. Of the valley of salt. 1. The most do take this for the lake Asphalis, the salt sea, where sometime stood Sodome and Gomorrha: Borrh. and where Abraham fought so prosperously: Mart. But Abrahams battell was before the destruction of Sodome, which valley was then fruitfull, as the Lords owne garden, Gen. 13.10. but after the destruction of Sodom it became a most filthie lake: which as some write continually smoaketh, and sendeth forth a sulphurous and stinking smell: the water is so bier tha no fish can liue ther∣in, and the ground so barren, that no grasse groweth thereon, as is more at large shew∣ed elsewhere:Hexapl. in Genes. c. 19. qu. 14. this then was a verie vnfit place for these armies to meete in. 2. Therefore this was an other valley of salt in the land of Edom: as is euident, 1. Kin. 14.7. He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and tooke the citie Sela, or Pe∣tra, &c. so called of the rocke. This Petra is the cheife citie of Arabia, vpon which Idumea confineth: Iun. 3. The Latine interpreter addeth further, and at Gebelem about 23. thousand: where two great errours are committed: for the words bege, melach, in the valley of salt, are corrupted and turned into a fained proper name, Gebele: and the number of 23. thou∣sand, is added. 4. Here beginneth the prophesie of Isaac for the preheminence of Iacob ouer E∣sau to take place: that the Elder should serue the younger; for the Edomites were now in subiection to Israel, and so were gouerned by a viceroy vntill the raigne of Ie∣hosophat, 1. King. 22.47. Iun. 12. Quest. v. 17. How Zadock and Ahimelech are said to be Priests. 1. Some thinke that these two, Zadock who descended of Eleazar, 1. Chron. 6.8. and Ahimelech who came of Ithamar by Eli, 1. Chron. 24.3. were the high Priests: Pellican. Borrh. But that is not like: for by the lawe there was to be but one high Priest: Dauid therefore would not so apparantly trangresse the law. 2. Some thinke that Ahimelech is the same who else-where is called Abiathar, and that Abiathar the father was also called Ahimelech, and both the father and son had two names: Sa. 3. But the high Priest at this time was Abiathar, the father of this Ahimelech, who was remooued from his office by Salomon, and gaue place vnto Zadocke, 1. King. 2.26. But because there was contention betweene these two families for the
priesthood, Dauid to compound this controuersie, maketh these two the cheife a∣mong the Priests, next vnto Abiathar the high Priest. 4. Here we see that Dauid hath authoritie to set the priests in their order and place:Controv. Kings haue power o∣uer Ecclesiasti∣call persons. which discouereth the insolencie of the Pope, who thinketh scorne that he, his Cardi∣nalls, or Prelates, should be at the deuotion of Emperour or King. 13. Quest. v. 18. Who were the Cerethites and Pelethites. 1. These Cerethites and Pelethites, Iosephus thinketh to be , keepers of the kings bodie, the kings guard: so also Mart. Borr. Pellic. Geneuens. who were so called as some thinke, the one sort of charath, to cut out, because they were the Kings executioners: the other of palat, to defend, because they kept the kings per∣son: Mart. Paul. Burgens. 2. Some giue an other deriuation of carath, which signifieth to strike a couenant, and pala, excellent, so called because they were worthie and excellent men. 3. Chimhi expoundeth these names by Vrim and Thummim: they were men of knowledge and integritie: and as some thinke Dauids counsell: but then Benaias be∣ing a man of warre should not haue beene set ouer them. 4. Some thinke that these were strangers of other countries, as the Cerethites were Philistims, and that the King vsed them to guard his person, as now the Swit∣zers, and Heluetians, and Scots are in other countries appointed for the Kings guard: Sa. But it is not like, that Dauid would haue strange people beeing infidels and ido∣laters, so neere his person: Mart. 5. Vatablus, readeth here, Creti & Pleti, the Cretians and Pletians; but he sheweth not what people, or of what nation they were. In the Apostles time we reade of Creetes that were at Ierusalem, Act. 2.11. for then the Cretians were famous: But in Dauids time they were not much regarded. 6. Wherefore these Cerethites and Pelethites, were proper names: and it seemeth they were garrison souldiers, the Cherethites which inhabited Chereth among the Phi∣listims after Dauid had vanquished them: for the Cherethites were counted among the Philistims, 1. Sam. 30.14. Ik. 25.16. and the Pelethites were also garrison souldiers among the Iaphlethites, whereof mention is made, Iosh. 16.2. Iun. and the Chalde paraphrast also commeth neere this interpretation: taking the Cherethites for archers, and the Pelethites for slingers: they were not then alwaies attending vpon the court, but garrison souldiers employed in defense of the land, and giuing their attendance by their course vpon the king, as may be gathered, c. 15.18. 14. Quest. v. 18. Whether the sonnes of Dauid were Priests. 1. The Hebrewe word cohamin, the Latine interpreter translateth sacrerdotes, Priests: so also Montanus: but it is not like that Dauids sonnes beeing of the tribe of Iudah, tooke vpon them the Peiesthood, which onely belonged vnto Leui: the king∣dome was inuested in Iudah, and the priesthood in Leui: they which attempted to confound these offices prospered not: Vzziah the King was stricken with leprosie, because he would haue burned incense, which onely belonged to the Priests: And the Macchabes beeing Leuites for vsurping vpon the kingdome procured much woe vnto themselues, and to all the nation. 2. Some thinke that they were discipuli sacerdotum, schollers of the Priests, and brought vp vnder them, and therefore are called Priests: as the schooles of the Pro∣phets were called Prophets: ex Pellic. but the Schooles of the Prophets afterward became Prophets, as Elisha after Elias, but these neuer were Priests. 3. Wherefore they are better taken to haue beene Princes or cheife rulers, as read P.V. Chald. B.G. for cohen sighifieth a cheife or principall man in bearing any pub∣like office sacred or ciuill: Borrh. and so they are called rishonim, head or cheife men about Dauid, 1. Chron. 18.17. 4. But this aduancing of his sonnes so soone, turned afterward to Dauids hurt: for Absolom by this meanes aspired to the kingdome, and Adoniah practised against Sa∣lomon: yet Dauid did herein the part of a prudent Prince; to acquaint his children
with the affaires of estate, Mart. 5. Here are now reckoned vp the cheife officers about Dauid both of the Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall state: shewing that a kingdome cannot consist without good officers and gouernours of both kinds: Borrh. CHAP. 9. 1. Quest. v. 1. Of Dauids kindnesse in remembring Ionathans posteritie. 1. DAuid here sheweth himselfe both a good Prince, and a good man: the one in the administration of iustice mentioned, c. 8.15. the other here in performing the couenant and promise made to Ionathan: one may be a good man, and yet not a good Prince; for euerie one hath not the gift of gouernement, but it is not possible for one to be a good Prince, but he must also be a good man: for hee that is euill in himselfe, cannot be good to others: as S. Paul, He that cannot rule his owne house, how shall he take care for the Church of God?1. Tim. 3.5. he which is not good to his owne at home, can not shew his goodnesse abroad to others: Mart. 2. Dauid before this time beeing busied in setling his kingdome at home, and subduing his enemies abroad, had no lei∣sure or opportunitie to thinke of these priuate affaires: But now beeing confirmed in his kingdome, he calleth to mind the benefits which he had formerly receiued, to re∣compence them: not like vnto many in these dayes, which when they are come to honour, forget their olde friends; as Pharaohs butler did not remember Ioseph of a long time: Osiand. 3. Now Dauid beginneth to bethinke himselfe of the great kind∣nesse, which onathan had shewed him in his life time: and of the league and coue∣nant which he had made with him, 1. Sam. 20.16. Dauid also sware vnto Saul to bee good vnto his posteritie, 1. Sam. 24.22. But because Saul had falsified his faith and oath to Dauid diuerse times: but Ionathan hee had foun most trustie and faithfull, therefore he saith, That I may shewe him mercie for Ionathn ske, rather then for Saul: Martyr. 2. Quest. v. 2. Of Ziba, who is said to be a seruant of the houshold of Saul. 1. This Ziba is held to be a Canaanite: because the Hebrewes could but serue sea∣uen yeares, vnlesse they would themselues, for then they had their eares boared tho∣rough, if they were vnwilling to leaue their masters seuice, and then they serued till the 50. yeare. But this Ziba had beene a seruant vnto Saul, and he is still a seruanr vn∣to that family at this time, which was seauen yeares after Sauls death: Mart. Pellican. 2. But he was a seruant of better sort and condition then ordinary, he had also 20. ser∣uants vnder him, v. 10. There were three degrees of seruants, ordinarij, vicarij, medi∣astini, the ordinarie seruants, the seruants for supply, and th seruants alwaies at hand: these last were put to the vilest and basest seruices: the first, had their ordinarie and cer∣taine seruice set them, as to waite in the chamber, to be cators and prouiders, to at∣tend the husbandrie, and such like: and these might haue seruants vnder them, who were seruants in respect of their masters, and they were masters themselues ouer their seruants: of this sort of seruants was Ziba: the third sort of seruants, which wre cal∣led vicarij, which serued for supply, had no certaine place or office appointed them: Martyr. 3. Quest. v. 3. Why it is called the mercie of God. 1. Borrhaius thinketh it is called the mercie of God, because in shewing mercie we are like vnto God. 2. Some doe so expound it, such mercie as shall bee pleasing and acceptable vnto God: Geneuens. 3. Some by the mercie of God vnderstand great mer∣cie, as such things which are excellent are said to bee of God: Vatab. Osiand. 4. But Dauid in this speech rather hath reference to the league and couenant made between them in the name of God, and now therefore according to the same will performe the mercie and kindnes, which they Ionathan and Dauid promised each to other: Iun.
4. Quest. v. 7. Of the kindnes which Dauid shewed to Miphibosheth. 1. It will be said that Dauid in restoring vnto Miphibosheth the lands of Saul, did performe no great matter, seeing they were of right due vnto him, as the next heire: to this R. Salomon answereth, that it was in the power of the King, to take from whom he would, and giue vnto another, at his will and pleasure, as Samuel describeth the office of a King, 1. Sam. 8.12. Hee will take your feilds and your vineyards, and your best oliue trees, and giue them to his seruants: And therefore Dauid did shew great kindnes, in giuing these lands to Miphibosheth, which he might haue bestowed vpon another. But D. Chimhi herein opposeth himselfe to R. Salomon, shewing that it is not in the power of the king, to dispose of mens grounds and possessions at his pleasure: as A∣hab, though a wicked king, yet would not by violence take away Naboths vineyard: the fruits of their lands were to serue the kings vse, they were thereof to giue toward the prouision of his house, but their possessions simply he was not to dispose of. But it was otherwise in this case: for Ishbosheth hauing rebelled against Dauid the law∣full king, might iustly haue beene depriued, and likewise Miphibosheth for taking part with him, as is most like, Iun. of all the right which they had in the goods and possessions of Saul: and therefore Dauid sheweth herein great mercie, in restoaring of them vnto Miphibosheth. Mart. 2. It will further be obiected, that Dauid was bound to doe this by vertue of the former league made betweene Ionathan and Dauid: and therefore he was in a manner forced to shew this kindnesse. It is true, Dauid was tied vnto it by the force of the league: yet Dauids faithfulnesse is therein no whit lesse to be commended, that was so mindfull of the couenant: these circumstances specially considered: as 1. that Io∣nathan was now dead, and could not challenge Dauid. 2. The house of Saul had re∣sisted him, and put him to much trouble, which might haue seemed a iust cause for Da∣uid to haue violated that league. 3. And some might haue pretended policie, that it was not safe to aduance the house and familie of a contrarie faction: Dauid notwith∣standing all these obiections, which might haue bin pretended, extendeth his kindnes and therein sheweth his goodnes and faithfulnesse. 3. But Dauid promised Ionathan, that he should be the next and second vnto him in the kingdome: 1. Sam. 23.17. he therein kept not his promise with Ionathan: yes, Dauid made good herein that promise to the full: for Miphibosheth is nourished at the kings table, as one of the kings sonnes: who were cheifest in reputation, as is be∣fore shewed, c. 8.18. and Miphibosheth was counted among them: But in that Mi∣phibosheth was not imployed in any place of gouernment, it was not Dauids fault, but because hee in respect of his lamenesse was not fit for any such employment. Mart. 5. Quest. v. 8. Why Miphibosheth calleth himselfe a dead dogge. 1. Miphibosheth so calleth himselfe, as vile and contemptible in diuerse respects. 1. In regard of his familie, which was reiected of God, and Dauid chosen to be king in the place of Saul: Mar. 2. And herein he confesseth and acknowledgeth, the tres∣passe of that familie against Dauid, by the which they deserued to be cast off and despised of Dauid, as a dead dogge. Pellican. 3. He confesseth himselfe in respect of his person, to be as an abiect and forlorne man, not worthie to be respected of Dauid. Osiander. 2. But this speach must not be vnderstood as simply spoken, but therein there is both an hyperbole, in that by way of amplification, to set forth his miserable state, he resembleth himselfe to a dead dogge: it is also spoken by way of comparison in res∣pect of Dauid, and of his princely estate, hee taketh himselfe to be but as a dead dogge. 6. Quest. Whether any to shew their humilitie, may make a lie of themselues. It may seeme that Miphibosheth did more abase himselfe then he needed, and con∣fessed himselfe to be that, which he was not, which giueth occasion of this question:
which may thus be resolued. 1. It is not lawfull for any to lie of himselfe, to expresse his humilitie: for S. Pauls rule is generall,Rom. 3 8. that we must not doe euill for good to come thereof: neither is it lawfull to make a lie,Ibid. v. 7. that the veritie may now abound thorough my lie vnto his glorie: nay it is not lawfull for to make a lie for Gods cause: for then as the Apostle saith, wee should be found to be false witnesses of God:1. Cor. 15.8. Epist. 8 ad Hier. And Augustine well sheweth by occasion of these words: that it is no lesse sinne, falsa laudare de Deo, quam de eo vera non credere: to speake by way of commendation false things of God, as not to beleeue, that which is true: if it be not lawfull for Gods honour to tell a lie, much lesse to preserue the cre∣dite of our modestie and humilitie. 1. Tim. 1.13.2. But Saint Pauls example will be obiected, that saith he was, peccatorum primus, the first, or chiefe of sinners: and yet there were greater sinners then hee. And the Prophet Agur saith of himselfe,Prov. 30.1. that hee was more foolish then any man: yet was not he the foolishest among men. 1. Some here answer, that they thus spake in respect of their own weakenesse, con∣fessing they had no strength at all of themselues but from God. 2. It may further be added, that they thus confessed in their owne opinion, who thought themselues to be inferiour vnto all. 3. But here is a difference to be made betweene a generall confession of the weak∣nes and impotencie of our nature, which the most perfect in this world may truely ackowledge, and a particular ackowledgement of some actuall sinne, which no man is to confesse of himselfe, beeing not guiltie thereof: as S. Paul, though he say, he was the chiefest sinner, yet he doth not make himselfe an adulterer, Idolater, or such like, which sinnes he was free from. 4. Saint Paul also speaketh by way of comparison with those which were called, that none of them had so persecuted the way of Christ, as he had done, & consequent∣ly none of them had so greatly sinned in that behalfe; so also the Prophet Agur doth acknowledge his ignorāce not simply, but in respect of the high things of God, which he was not able to comprehend. Mar. 7. Quest. v. 10. Whether Miphibosheth did in deed eate at the Kings table. The occasion of this question is this: v. 10. Dauid saith, Thou, and thy sonnes, and thy seruants, shall till the land, and bring in, that thy masters sonne may haue foode to eate; but Miphibosheth thy masters sonne, shall eate bread alwaies at my table: how did Ziba prouide food for Miphibosheth, seeing he fed at the kings table in Ierushalem? A∣gaine, v. 11. Ziba saith, All that the King hath commanded, &c. so shall thy seruant doe, that Miphibosheth may eate at my table, as one of the Kings sonnes: if he did eate at Zibahs table; how was he fed at the kings table? 1. Some answer to the first doubt: that v. 10. in the first clause, by his masters sonne, is meant Micah Miphibosheths sonne, who is mentioned v. 12. so Iunius: but seeing Miphibosheth is afterward said, to be his masters sonne, that is, Sauls nephew, it is like∣ly to be taken in the same sense before: And then in the first place he meaneth not Mi∣phibosheths person, but his familie, whereof his young sonne was a principall part: that though Miphibosheth himselfe liued at Dauids table, yet his familie with his son should be maintained with Ziba. Osiand. 2. In the other place, v. 11. some read, at thy table: so Lat. Osiand. but the word is shulcani, at my table, 2. Some so take it, as though Miphibosheth was fed at Zibahs table: Pellican: but that is contrarie to the text, v. 13. Miphibosheth did eate bread continually at the kings table. 3. Some giue this sense: Miphibosheth is said to eate at the kings table, because he had meate sent him from the kings table: Sa. but he ra∣ther sat himselfe at the kings table, because hee dwelt at Ierushalem, where the kings house was: and as Dauid in Sauls time, did eate at his table: so Dauid would recom∣pence the like kindnesse to Miphibosheth to eate at his table. 4. Some giue this in∣terpretation: that Miphibosheth may eate at my table: that is, may haue all things at commandement, as one of the kings sonnes, as if he sat at my table: Genevens. but the phrase is taken here in the same sense, as it is before, v. 10. where Dauid saith that
Miphibosheth should indeed eate at his table, not to haue all things at commandemēt in the kings house. 5. There remaine three other interpretations: Iunius maketh them the words of Zibah spoken in this sense, Though Miphibosheth eating at my table, should be as one of the Kings sonnes: so also Peter Martyr: that is, if it had pleased the King, that Miphibosheth had beene at my finding. I would haue giuen him entertainment as one of the Kings sonnes: but it is not like, that Zibah would haue called it his table, seeing he was but a seruant to Miphibosheth: neither would hee seeme to contradict the king, who had said before, that Miphibosheth should eate at his table: and to what end should Ziba make mention of the Kings sonnes, which had no allowance at his table? 6. Some take these words vttered by Zibah, but in the kings person; Miphibosheth shall eate at my table, &c. as the king saith. B. 7. But Vatablus better taketh these words as spoken by Dauid, that he said, repea∣ting his former words, Miphibosheth shall eate at my table: And this may seeme the more probable, because the former clause vttered by Zibah, endeth with the perfect distinction athnah. CHAP. 10. 1. Quest. v. 2. How Dauid shewed kindnesse to the King of Ammon, and why. 1. DAuid hauing now shewed his gratefull mind toward some at home, beginneth also to practise the like abroad, and sendeth a freindly and comfortable mes∣sage to the king of Ammon, after the death of his Father: Mar. 2. Though it were not lawfull to enter into any publike league with the Ammonites, which is directly forbidden, Deut. 23.6. yet priuate amitie might be reteined: and Dauid might shew his thankfulnes vnto them. Osiand. 3. What pleasure Nahash the former King of Ammon shewed to Dauid, is not ex∣pressed: the Hebrewes thinke that this was the kindnesse, that after the King of Moab had put to death Dauids parents, the rest fled vnto the King of Ammon, and were there succoured: but of this there is no certaintie: it is like that Nahash beeing a pro∣fessed aduersarie to Saul, whom he had before discomfited, when he besieged Iabesh Gilead, gaue freindly entertainment in the daies of Saul vnto Dauid,1. Sam. 9. whom Saul ha∣ted and pursued. Iun. 4. Now whereas Dauid is said before to haue subdued the Ammonites, c. 8.12. it seemeth, it is set down there by anticipation and preuention in the historie: for if Dauid had before this vanquished the Ammonites, Dauid would haue sent no such freind∣ly and familiar message to his professed enemie. Mart. 5. Pellican obserueth, that the euill successe which Dauid had in this embassage sheweth, that God was not pleased with Dauid, because he sought the freindship of an heathen king. But things are not to be measured by the euent. It was not amisse for Dauid to shew his kindnes and thankfulnesse for a benefit receiued: if the wicked re∣warded him euill for good, it bewraieth the vilenes of their nature, rather then the vn∣lawfulnes of Dauids act. Martyr. 2. Quest. v. 3. Of the euill counsell of the King of Ammons Princes and Counsellers. 1. These peruerse men, which perswaded Hanun the King, that Dauid did not send this message of good will, but in craft and cunning, measured others by their owne foote: because they themselues were fraudulent and deceitfull, they so iudge of others. Pellican. And beside, they discouer their hatefull mind toward the people of God: that as their forefathers afforded the Israelites their brethren, no releefe in the desert, Deu.
24.5. beeing descended of Lot, as the other of Abraham, who called Lot his bro∣ther. And as Nahash their king required of the men of Iabesh Gilead their right eies: so they still bewraie an hatred as it were hereditarie in them against the people of God. 2. They challenge them vntruely to be spies, as Ioseph did sometime his brethren: but that was onely in pretense: not that it is a thing in it selfe vnlawfull to be a spie: for when there is iust battell waged, it is lawfull to bee a spie: as Moses sent Caleb and Ioshua with others to espie and search out the land of Canaan: but vnder colour of amitie and freindship to spie out the state and condition of others, is a thing odious. Mar. 3. Thus it pleased God, that by this meanes the prophecie of Balaam should take place, that a scepter should rise in Israel, which should destroie Moab, and the other sonnes of Sheth:Numb. 24.17. Borrh. And thus it falleth out according to the proverbe, that euill counsell is worst to the author of it. 3. Quest. v. 4. Of the despight offered by the Ammonites to Dauids messengers, in cutting their beards and garments. 1. In that they offer such contumelie and disgrace vnto Dauids Embassadors, ther∣in they offended against the law of nations, and therefore they receiued afterward condigne punishment: The Romans destroyed Corinthus a famous Citie of Grecia, because they vsed their Embassadors contumeliously in words. 2. There are two speciall ornaments of the bodie, one is naturall, namely the beard, the other artificiall, the garments, which couer the nakednes: in both these the King of Ammon seeketh the disgrace of Dauids seruants. 3. The reason whereof may be this: the Israelites were forbidden to cut their beards, Leuit. 19.27. as a signe of mourning: and especiall prouision was made by the law, that their nakednesse should not appeare: and therefore they were forbidden to make any Altar with staires, Exod. 20.26. the more then to despight them, they offer them this ignominious disgrace in despight of their owne law. Mar. 4. Now in that they are bidden afterward by Dauid to stay till their beards were growen: it is euident, that the vse then in Israel was not to shaue their beards: for then they might haue cut away the other part also: howsoeuer then this tricke of sha∣uing of beards be superstitiously vsed among the Romanists, it is certaine, that the Israelites custome was not to shaue their beards:Controv. Against shauing for they might more easily haue cut off the rest of their beards, which was remaining, then haue staied till they were growen: Pellican, Osiander. The heathen indeede had a fashion to cut their beards: as Adriane the Emperour is noted to haue beene the first among the Romane Emperours that did spare his beard, and suffered it to grow long. But this superstiti∣ous vse was not taken vp by the people of God. Mar. 4. Quest. v. 6. From whence the Ammonites hired their souldiers and assistants. 1. Here are fowre countries named, whence the Ammonites had their supplie, from the Aramites of Rechab, which was a citie at the foote of Libanus the vtmost bound of Syria toward Palestina, whereof mention is made Numb. 13.22. from the Aramites of Zaba: from the King of Maacah, who was also subiect to Hadadezer king of Za∣bah: of the Maacahthites read 3.14. And from the men of Tab, as Iun. rather then Ishtob, making it all one name, as the rest doe reade: Tab was the countrie where Iepthah dwelt, Iudg. 11.3. Beside they had some helpe from Aram Naharaim, 1. Chr. 19.6. 2. All these belonged to Aram, or Syria, which was diuided into Syria beyond the riuer, v. 16. and Syria on this side: Borrh. which is subdiuided into these foure regi∣ons, Camagena, Damascena, Coelosyria, Phoenicia: Mar. which are here called by o∣ther names. 3. Some things are here omitted, which are mentioned, 1. Chron. 19.6. as how they hired these soudiers for a thousand talents of siluer: and that beside the number
of men here expressed, they hired 32. thousand chariots. Iun. 4. These Ammonites were so farre from reconciling themselues to Dauid, and making amends for this wrong, that they prouoked Dauid to battell, and came as farre as Medeba, 1. Chron. 19.7. a citie in the borders of Ammon. 5. Quest. v. 12. Of Ioabs courage and magnanimitie against the enemies of Gods people. Here is nothing wanting in Ioab which is requisite in a good Captaine. 1. He vp∣on the present vseth most diligent care, and prudent aduise in diuiding the souldiers, and committing part of them to Abishai his brother, and leading part of them him∣selfe: which sheweth what an excellent thing concord is, as among Captaines, which fight terrene battels, so specially among Ministers, which doe fight the Lords spirituall battels. Osiand. 2. As he is not daunted or dismaied himselfe, so by his couragious speach hee ani∣mateth others; saying, let vs be strong and valiant for our people, &c. like as Moses set∣teth downe in the waging of battell, how the priest should encourage the people: Let not your hearts faint, neither feare, or be amased, &c.Deut. 20.3. 3. Hee sheweth the right end of battell, to fight in defence of the Lords people, and to maintaine the true seruice and worship of God. Mar. 4. Hee doth religiously commit the euent of this businesse vnto God: saying, Let the Lord doe that which is good in his eyes: non potest vox duce dignior cogitari: a more worthie speach beseeming a Captaine could not be thought, then this was here vtte∣red by Ioab. Pellic. 6. Quest. Whether this were true fortitude in Ioab. True fortitude consisteth in the vndertaking, and bearing of great and suddaine dainger in a good cause, and for some honest and commendable end: wherein diuerse things are to be considered. 1. The obiect or matter, wherein true fortitude is seene: which is not in those euills which are internall, as in auoiding of vices and sinnes: for these a man falleth into by his owne default: nor yet is it properly seene in such daungers, which are involuntarie, as in sicknesse, shipwracke, and such like: though to beare these things patiently is an excellent vertue: but fortitude is exercised chiefly in such dangers, as are outwardly incident, and in those most of all which are suddain: as this daunger of battell, wherein Ioabs fortitude did shew it selfe, was vnexpected and vnlooked for. 2. The end of fortitude must not be praise, vaine glorie, profit, such as the valiant Heathen propounded to themselues, who shewed their valour to get themselues a name: and many aduentured themselues because of those rewards which were pro∣mised vnto them, that did fight for their countrie: but the end of this vertue, is some honest cause, as to defend our parents or countrie, to deliuer the oppressed, especially to maintaine true religion and worship of God. Mart. 3. There are diuerse kinds of fortitude. 1. There is a warlike valour, which com∣meth by skill and experience in militarie affaires. 2. There is an other kind which ri∣seth of confidence, which a man hath in his strength. 3. An other proceedeth from ignorance of the greatnesse of the danger. 4. Another, which riseth from an∣ger, or rage, when one is inflamed to reuenge himselfe: but all these are farre off from true fortitude: which is a vertue not giuen by nature, but wrought in men by the spirit of God, whereby they are resolued in an honest cause to attempt difficult labour, and endure the vtmost dangers: so that there are two offices of a Christian fortitude, ferre, & aggredi, to beare and suffer, and to attempt or enterprise: but the first rather, wherein the fortitude and patience of the Martyrs was tried in enduring vnspeakable and intollerable torments for the name of God. 6. Although Ioab were a treacherous and bloodie man, yet he might haue this morall vertue at this time, as many common graces of the spirit are oft to be found in the wicked. Mart.
7. Quest. v. 18. Of the number of chariots and horsemen, which were slaine of the Aramites. Here mention is made of seauen hundreth chariots, and 40. thousand horsemen: but in 1. Chron. 19.18. there are said to haue beene destroied 7. thousand chariots, and 40. thousand footemen. 1. Some doe thus reconcile the places, that the principall of the chariots are here rehearsed, but the whole number there; and that the horsemen are here onely spoken of, there the footemen. Mart. Bor. Genev. 2. Iunius giueth a better solution of the first doubt: that the number of 700. is ta∣ken for so many troupes or bands, which made in all 7000. chariots, counting ten to a troupe or companie. 3. But for the latter doubt, Iunius solution seemeth not to be so good, who thus readeth, 7. hundreth chariots (and 40. thousand footemen) of horsemen: referring horsemen, not to the 40. thousand immediatly going before, but to the 7. hundreth chariots first mentioned: but this reading seemeth not to be so fit, both because the words are not so distinguished in the Hebrew: and there was great difference be∣tweene the chariots and horsemen: as c. 18.4. Dauid tooke from Hadarezer, a thou∣sand chariots, and 7. thousand horsemen, and 20. thousand footemen: the horsemen, then can not be referred to the chariots. And it is euident that the Ammonites hired both chariots, and horsemen, 1. Chron. 19.6. there were then both chariots, horsemen, and footmen in the host of the Aramites: here the chariots and horsemen are numbred, which were destroied; and in the other place the chariots and footemen. 4. But whereas the Latine translation speaketh of 58. thousand men, which fled before Israel, v. 19. there is no such thing in the originall: so that therein there is a manifest corruption in the Latine. CHAP. 11. 1. Quest. v. 1. What time Kings goe forth to battell in. 1. AFter that Ioab had smitten the Ammonites, and they were fled into the Citie, c. 10.14. hee, the winter season, as it seemeth, comming on, seased to pursue them, or besiege their citie, which was Rabbah, afterward called Philadelphia, the cheife citie of that nation: he expecteth the next spring, when Dauid sent Ioab a∣gaine against the Ammonites. Pellic. 2. The time, which in those countries was thought meetest for warre, was the spring tide: when as both grasse and corne beginneth to waxe ripe in those regions: and so they might haue food, and releefe for their horse, and their whole armies. Borr. Osiand. Mar. 3. Wherein appeareth a great difference betweene the warres of these times, and those: for now this age is so fierce, that euen in the dead time of winter, many Princes and Captaines will not forbeare warre: As Pope Iulie tooke Mirandula, in the deepe snow: Frauncis king of Fraunce was taken at Ticinam in Februarie: Callis was sacked in Ianuarie. Mart. Quest. 2. Of Dauids adulterie, and the vse which is to be made thereof. 1. They which thinke to patronize their licentious life by Dauids fall, doe there∣in tempt God, and sinne of presumption: for they which thus reason with themselues: if Dauid committed adulterie, why may not we likewise: might they not as well in∣ferre, Iudas beeing an Apostle betraied his master, and Paul persecuted the Church, therefore it is lawfull for them to doe so likewise. 2. But seeing the Scripture con∣demneth the adulterie of Dauid, what impudencie is it for any thereby to seeke de∣fense of their sinne? yea the heathen by the light of nature held adulterie to be a most grieuous sinne, as Pharaoh king of Egypt, Gen. 12. & Abimelech king of Gerar, Gen. 20. So Nebuchadnezzar burnt Achab and Zedechia two false prophets, and adulte∣rers with fire, Ierem. 29.
3. But this profitable vse may be made of Dauids fall, that sinne is not altogether extinguished in the regenerate, they oftentimes feele in their members the law of sin rebelling against the spirit: and by this example of Dauids sinne, who by his repen∣tance found forgiuenesse, we learne, that Gods seruants, if they offend of infirmity, should neuer despaire of forgiuenes. And herein are we to imitate Dauid, not in his sinnes, but in his true repentance and teares after he had sinned. Mart. 3. Quest. v. 2. Of Dauids idlenesse and securitie, vpon these words, Dauid arose from his bed. 1. The beginning of Dauids fall proceeded from his idlenes and securitie; he rose from his bed, wheron he vsed to rest in the afternoone: which as the Physitians hold to be vnwholesome to the bodie, Osiand. so was it a signe of Dauids great security, who gaue himselfe to ease and rest, his captaine and souldiers beeing occupied in dangerous battells abroad: Dauid vsed not to goe forth with them as he had in fore time. Pellican. 2. There are diuerse kinds of ease: some doe sequester themselues from busines to giue themselues to contemplation, as our blessed Sauiour preached in the day, & prayed in the night, Luk. 21. Some keepe an holy rest from sinne: But there is beside a lasciuious and wanton rest, or idlenesse, which is the mother of lust: as one of the sinnes of Sodome was aboundance of idlenesse,Ezeck 18. As Ambrose fitly resembleth idle persons to the oyster, who while he openeth his shell in the Sunne, is assaulted by the crabbe or creavish, which commeth and thrusteth his clawes between the shells, and so deuoureth the oyster: so idle persons are tempted and seduced, & made a pray of Sathan. 3. But as idlenesse is hurtfull to al, so it beseemeth not the person of Princes, who though they neuer plow or digge, yet are to watch ouer the people to see them wel gouerned, and to prouide for them good lawes. And as in Dauid, this pleasant ease brought forth adulterie: so the idle life of Monkes, feeding and pampering their bellies, was the cause of that filthie vncleannes and vile corruption, which were de∣tected to be among them. 4. Then seeing Sathan is so vigilant to catch euery oppertunitie to supplant vs go∣ing about like a roaring lion, as S. Peter saith, seeking whom he may deuoure: we ought so much the more carefully to watch ouer our selues, that we may escape his snares. Mart. 4. Quest. v. 2. Of the wandring of Dauids eyes, vpon these words, Hee saw a woman washing her selfe. 1. Dauids curious eyes wandring, falling vpon such a pleasant obiect, did intangle his affection, and enflame his desire: Dauid at this time had forgotten that prayer, Psal. 119.37. Turne away mine eyes from regarding vanitie; Borrh. first, seeing her he committeth adulterie with her in his heart, then he resteth not till hee had acted his vncleane desire. Osiand. 2. This sinne of Dauid appeareth the greater, if it be compared with Iosephs con∣tinencie: Ioseph was young, and a single man, and was entised of his mistresse, yet consenteth not: Dauid was of good yeares, hauing many wiues, which might haue contented him; and beside he was a soliciter of a woman one of his subiects, whose chastitie he ought to haue defended. Mart. 3. We see then hereby, how dangerous a thing it is to suffer the eyes to wander: Iob therefore made a couenant with his eyes, not to looke vpon a maide: Gregorie hath a good saying, qui externo oculo abutuntur, digni sunt quibus internus oculus offus∣cetur, they which abuse the outward eye, are worthie to haue the inward eye darke∣ned. Ridiculous then and vaine is their pretext, who thinke, that while they gaze and looke vpon such pleasing obiects, se illis spectaculis non moueri, that they are not stirred with such spectacles and sights: doe they thinke them wiser & stronger then Dauid who was caught by his sight. 4. And herein Dauids offence was the greater, in respect of himselfe, who by his place should haue beene a keeper and maintainer of Gods Lawe, and in regard
of others, whome he offended: for whereas Saul was not detected of adulterie, Da∣uids euill example gaue occasion to men to iustifie Saul in respect of Dauid, and so to call in question the equitie of Gods iudgements: Mart. 5. Quest. v. 3. Of the beawtie of Bathsheba which entangled Dauid. 1. Though Dauid were entised by this pleasing obiect, yet therefore is not beau∣tie and fairenesse of it selfe an euill thing, which is a gift and worke of the creator: for beauty is defined to be apta coniunctio membrorum cum suauitate coloris: an apt ioyning together of the members with a pleasant colour. So in Scripture vertuous men, as Ioseph, Dauid; and women, as Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, are set forth and des∣cribed by their beautie. 2. But this gift of nature or rather of the God of nature, is made an occasion of stumbling through the corruption of our nature; as the light of the Sunne, though in it selfe it be comfortable, yet is offensiue vnto bleare eyes: so is mans corrupt na∣ture affected with such obiects; therefore as Phisicians when they cut or launch any patient, will haue their schollers present to make obseruation thereof for their own practise: so we beholding the cure which God made vpon Dauid, in launching this his spirituall sore, should teach vs to beware; and to set a doore before our eies: it was the fall of the old world, when the sonnes of God, euen they which came of the righteous race, gazed vpon the daughters of men, and saw they were faire, and so were seduced: Mart. 3. As the beautie of the bodie entangleth a carnall eye; so the Angels that fell were proud of their spirituall beautie, wherein they were created, and so were tho∣rough pride cast downe from heauen: Borrh. 6. Quest. v. 4. Of Bathsheba her willingnesse in consenting vnto Dauid, and of other her faults. 1. Some think that it was great boldnesse in her to wash her selfe abroad in open view: whereas it had beene more beseeming her womanly modestie, to haue kept her within her doores: Mart. But it is more like that Dauid espied her washing in her house, as Iosephus writeth, through the windowes; so thinketh Vata. Eman. Sa. for seeing she washed and purified her selfe from her monthly vncleannes, v. 4. it is most like that she did it within her owne house. 2. Pellican noteth this for a fault also, that while her husband was watching abrod in the campe, she at home abutitur quiete sua, abuseth her rest, and giueth her selfe to washing and athing; when as it had beene fitter for her to be exercised in fasting & prayer: But seeing she did purifie her selfe from her vncleannes, this washing was of necessitie rather and decencie, then of wantonnes. 3. But herein was Bathsheba her great fault, that being sent for to come vnto the King, so easily consenteth: which shewed either some euil affection toward her hus∣band, from whom she desired to be diuorced; or an ambitious desire to be the kings wife. Much vnlike was she here vnto Susanna, who did rather choose to die, then to commit adulterie. Beside, in that she sendeth as in feare to Dauid, that she was with child, being the apter to conceiue after her monthly purifying, she sheweth an vnwillingnes and griefe that it was so, and bewrayeth a desire to haue had it other∣wise. And such is the mind of wanton and lewd women, fructum ventris oderunt, they hate and abhoore the fruit of the womb. Mart. 7. Quest. v. 6. Of Dauids practise in seeking to conceale. his adulterie. 1. Dauid beside the adulterie which he had committed, falleth into diuerse other faults: first into hardnesse of heart, that neither he, nor yet Bathsheba doe bethinke themselues what they had done, neither repent them of their sinne, but onely think to hide and colour it; then he sheweth the right guise and fashion of hypocrites, who while they may hide their sinnes from men, doe not reuerence the sight of God; fur∣ther, intrudit silium suum in agros Vriae, he would thrust his own sonne to be an others heire, and so abuse Vriah that way also. Mart.
2. Dauid goeth on in this deuise: first he enquireth of Vrias of Ioabs welfare, and how the warre prospered: but all this was merus praetextus, a meere pretext or pre∣tense: for Dauid intended an other thing, then he practiseth with Vrias to company with his wife, and sendeth after him a present, a messe from his owne table, that V∣riah might thereby be cheared vp, and haue a greater desire to his wiues companie. And to that ende Dauid seeing Vriah to refraine the first night, watching among the rest at the Kings doore, made him the next day to eate and drinke, and to be drunken that his lust to his wife might be enflamed: But all this tooke no place; God so dis∣posing, that Dauids sinne should come to light: for there is no counsell against God, but his purpose shall stand: Mart. Borrh. Osiand. 8. Quest. v. 11. Of Vriah his answer vnto Dauid. 1. Vriah giueth this reason, why he refused at this time to lodge in his own house, because the Arke, and the host of Israel, and his Lord Ioab remained in tents: wher∣by he sheweth by his example, that in time of common warre men should giue them∣selues to prayer and fasting, not to ease and feasting: Borrh. 2. The Arke of God they vsed to carrie with them into the campe for these two causes, both that it might be an euident testimonie of Gods presence, and that they might aske counsel of God at the Arke, as occasion serued: Mart. 3. This godly speech of Vriah might haue admonished Dauid, that it was much more vnseemely for him to follow vnlawfull lust in this common daunger, seeing V∣riah abstained from that which was lawfull. Pellic. 4. But it pleased God to leaue Dauid to himselfe, and to suffer him to fall into this great sinne, both in respect of himselfe, that he might throughly be humbled, seeing God purposed to exalt him: and for the example of others, vt de statu suo Dauid caden∣te nemo superbiat, that no man should be bragge of his estate seeing Dauid did fall, nor yet any should despaire of rising againe with Dauid. Pellic. 9. Quest. Of Dauids letters sent to Ioab in betraying Vriah: and Ioabs readinesse therein. 1. Dauid is yet so farre from seeing his sinne, that he addeth one wickednesse to an other: his idlenes followeth a wanton eie, his wantonnes is accompanied with lust, which bringeth forth adulterie; then there is a deuise to make Vriah the father of an adulterous seede: to this Dauid addeth an attempt to make Vriah drunke: this not taking place, he contriueth his death, and that in betraying him into the hands of his enemies, and that with the losse of many beside. 2. Wherein Dauid for this one act exceedeth the violent course which Achab v∣sed against Naboth: hee coueted but his vineyard, Dauid desireth an others wife: Achab wrought this onely by his wicked wife Iezabel, but Dauid doth this himselfe. Martyr. 3. And Vriah his innocencie maketh Dauids sinne more grieuous; hee which all his life before hated fraud and deceit, now hateth simplicitie and truth: hee which spared his cruell enemie Saul before, now pursueth vnto death a most faithfull friend and dutifull subiect. And further, he maketh Ioab accessarie to his sinne: who though his sinne was the lesse, because the Kings authoritie forced him, yet is it not thereby excused: It might be Dauid pretended some capitall offence to haue beene committed by Vriah: yet Io∣ab was not ignorant of the Lawe, that none were to bee put to death, but vnder two or three witnesses: hee therefore should herein haue obeyed God, rather then man. Mar. 10. Quest. v. 17. Why it pleased God, that Vriah in this manner should be slaine. 1. In that God suffred a iust and innocent man in this manner to be cut off, it need no more to call Gods iustice in question, then that he suffered Iohn Baptist to be be∣headed, Peter and Paul to be slaine: Euerie one is borne to die, for death is the stipend or wages of sinne: God therefore whose counsells are most secret, yet most iust, doth for some causes best knowne to himselfe, giue way sometime to vnlawfull attempts.
2. And who can tell, whether Vriah had not some sinnes of his owne, for the which he is chastised; as in attributing too much to his wife, and in suffring himselfe to be mis-led often by her, or such like: But we must not howsoeuer it is, complaine of the Lords proceeding herein as vniust. Mart. 11. Quest. v. 20. Of Ioabs answer returned vnto Dauid. 1. In Ioab, though it was commendable in him, in that he was conuersant in the sacred histories, as appeareth by the instance giuen of Abimelech, yet in beeing so seruiceable to the vnlawfull desire of the king, he sinned diuersly, both in condem∣ning a man, his cause beeing vnheard, and in accomplishing the kings desire with the losse of many beside: Osiand. 2. The messenger also plaieth his part to picke a thank, who staied not till Dauid should obiect as Ioab had before conceiued: but presently telleth Dauid of the death of Vriah, which he knew would be acceptable vnto him. 3. Dauid also dissembleth the matter, to the intent, that neither this cruell com∣maundement, nor Ioabs fawning obedience should be discouered to the messenger. Geneuens. 12. Quest. v. 27. Of these words, and shee became his wife: Whe∣ther it be lawfull to marrie her, with whome adulterie formerly was committed. 1. Nothing is defined directly concerning this matter in the Scripture; for Leu. 18. where many impediments of marriage are rehearsed, and diuerse prohibitions of marriage; yet no mention is made of this barre of adulterie going before: but the rea∣son hereof may be this, because the adulterer and adultresse by Moses Law were to be stoned vnto death: and so there could be no question of this matter. 2. But it hath beene decreed by many Pontificiall decrees, that the marriage of such who committed adulterie before, should be actually void, as is extant in the Ex∣trauagant in diuerse places:Extrav. titul. de eo qui dux∣eratt vxorem quam polluerat, &c. & in tit. de convers. infidel. can. laudab. But this example of Dauid convinceth that opinion, whose marriage with Bethsheba, the Lord ratified and confirmed. 3. Wherefore the best resolution is this, that such mariages are indeed altogether vnfit and inconuenient: for if this were vsually permitted for the adulterer and adul∣tresse to marie together, it would giue occasion for one of them to practise against the life of an other: yet though such mariages are not conuenient, and may with good cause be letted and preuented, and such by the Magistrate may be punished: yet such marriages beeing consummate, are not for any such pretense to be dissolued, for then Dauids mariage had beene vnlawfull: Osiand. it is adulterie following after, not go∣ing before, that breaketh mariage knot; see more of this question, Synop. Cent. 3. er. 96. 13. Quest. v. 27. How the thing which Dauid had done displea∣sed the Lord. 1. In that it is said this fact displeased God, there is an euident distinction and dif∣ference made betweene the thing and the person: for Dauid in respect of his electi∣on was beloued of God: but this thing which he had committed, namely the adulte∣rie with Bathshebah, and the murther of Vriah, the Lord abhorred: neither is it to be held as an absurd thing, that one in respect of his present estate should bee an enemie vnto God, and so displeasing vnto him, and yet in respect of his election beloued of God:Rom. 5.8. as S. Paul saith, God setteth forth his loue toward vs, seeing that while we were yet sinners Christ died for vs. 2. We must learne herein to be like vnto God, to loue the persons of our enemies, and yet to hate and abhorre their vices: as God here hateth the sinnes of Dauid, yet loued his person as elected vnto life: Mart. 14. Quest. Of the greatnes of Dauids sinne of adulterie, and murther. 1. Concerning adulterie in generall, it is a most grieuous and abominable sinne: as may be made plaine by these reasons: 1. It is against the lawe of the creation, and the first institution of marriage: that hath made man and wife but one flesh, which is diuided by adulterie. 2. The effects thereof are vile and abhominable: for adulte∣rie bringeth forth oftentimes murther, Psal. 51. hom. 3. and poisoning, as Chrysostome sheweth.
3. Cyprian writeth that in some Churches the Christian Bishops vtterly refused to re∣ceiue adulterers into the peace of the Cchurh, they held it to be so grieuous a sinne.Lib 4 eist. 2. 4. By the sinne of adulterie great iniurie is offred to posteritie, and so to the common∣wealth in the commixtion of seede:Ad lg. Iul de adult. in pad. in which regard Bartalus maketh it the next of∣fence against the common wealth vnto treason. 5. Thales Milesius held periurie not to be worse then adulterie. 6. Yea Chrysostome maketh adulterie worse then idolatry:hom 62. i Io¦hann. because the one is a pollution of marriage, and maketh a dissolution thereof, so doth not the other: But though this argument conclude not, for though in respect of ma∣riage adulterie is the more grieuous, yet simply it is not; and idolatrie is fornication against God, the other is against man: yet these former reasons doe sufficiently lay o∣pen the vilenesse of this sinne: Mart. 2. And Dauids sinne both of adulterie and murder is amplified, 1. in respect of the thing or obiect, which was not siluer or gold, lands or possessions, but the chastitie and life of man. 2. The person against whome the sinne was first committed was god, whose lawe was contemned: and secondarily the persons of Vriah and his wife, who beeing an alone woman, her husband beeing gone into the warre, ought by Dauid to haue beene protected: Vriah himselfe also was an innocent and harmelesse man, and therefore the sinne was the greater. 4. Dauids person also beeing considered the offence was the heauier, who was a Prophet and a King, and therefore gaue great of∣fence by this euill example: Borrh. 3. The Hebrewes, to excuse Dauids sinne, haue deuised, that it was the vse, that they which went to battell gaue their wiues a bill of separation to marrie where they would. But this is their fiction: for if there had beene any such vse, to make it law∣full to marie such women so separated by bill of diuorce, what needed Dauid so to haue practised against Vriah? and why did the Prophet afterward reprooue him? But if they say such a bill was but to take place after the husbands death, then was it su∣perfluous, for by death, without any such bill, the marriage was fully dissolued: Martyr. CHAP. 12. 1. Quest. v. 1. Who this Nathan the Prophet was whome the Lord sent to Dauid. DAuid had a sonne called Nathan, c. 5.14. but he could not bee Nathan the Pro∣phet, Mar. as may appeare by these reasons: 1. Nathan was borne vnto Dauid in Ierusalem: and therefore in respect of his yeares could not then be a Prophet, when Dauid consulted with Nathan about the building of God an house, which was in the beginning of his raigne in Ierusalem, c. 7. 2. Nathan the Prophet is here sent to tell Dauid of his sinne, and to declare the iudgements of God against him, That the Lord would raise vp euill against him euen out of his owne house: Dauids owne sonne had not beene a fit messenger of such hard tydings, neither would his speech haue beene so much regarded at Dauids hand. 3. Therefore as Dauid had Gad the Seer to aduise him before, so now he hath Nathan the Prophet. 2. Quest. How long after Dauids adulterie Nathan was sent vnto him. 1. It is euident that Dauid slept in this sinne toward 10. moneths: Mar. for the child conceiued in adulterie was born presently after this admonition of the Prophet: after so long a time Nathan was sent vnto him, not as some thinke, as watching his best opportunitie; because when the heate of mens affections is allayed, it is the fittest dealing with them, for the more one is grounded by continuance in his sinne, the more hardly is he brought to repentance. 2. Neither is it like, that Dauid in the mean time was otherwise admonished and put in minde of his sinne, as by reading the scriptures, and by remembring himselfe of Vriah his words vnto him: Mart. for it appeareth by
Dauids answer to Nathan, wherein he giueth sentence against himselfe, that Dauid was not yet awaked from his sinne. 3. But it pleased God thus long to deferre the Prophets comming vnto him, that herein might appeare the weakenesse and impoten∣cie of our nature, which is neuer able of it selfe to rise vnto repentance: Osiand. 4. And God herein also manifesteth his loue toward his elect, in that he will not suffer them to lie downe in their sinne, but euer calleth them home in time: Pellic. 3. Quest. Why Nathan speaketh to Dauid in a parable 1. Iosephus thinketh this to be the reason thereof, because Nathan beeing a pru∣dent man, considered that Princes were headstrong, dum affectibus suis rapiuntur, while they are carried with their affections, and therefore he concealeth at first the threate∣ning of iudgement: but Nathan had experience of Dauids mild nature, specially in matters to God-ward, and therefore this was not the cause. 2. But Nathan speaketh in parable, 1. both to keepe a meane and measure in his reprehension, that it should not be too sharpe: Mar. 2. Non invadit durius, quia prae∣nouerat conuertendum: hee doth not set vpon him roughly, because he knewe that he should be conuerted: Pellic. 3. And by this kind of couert speech, Dauid is brought to giue sentence against himselfe. 3. Some thinke that Nathan spake this vnto Dauid in the hearing and presence of his captaines and Princes: but it is more like that Nathan did admonish him priuately the more easily to winne him: Mar. 4. And Nathan reuealing vnto Dauid his sinne in particular, as though he had bin therein of his counsell, receiued this direction (no doubt) from the Lord. 5. Though Dauid himselfe were a Prophet, yet a Prophet is sent vnto him, tan∣quam medicus ad medicum, sed sanus ad aegrotum: as one Physitian to an other, but the sound to the sicke, as Chrysostome saith. 4. Quest. v. 4. Of the stranger that came to the rich man. 1. Rupertus by this stranger, vnderstandeth the deuill, who came vnto this rich man Dauid, who would not be entertained, with any of Dauids owne wiues, whom Dauid might lawfully vse, but stirreth him vp to desire strange flesh. 2. Some more fitly by this stranger, would haue concupiscence vnderstood, which should haue but a strangers entertainement with vs, not be as an in-dweller: Mart. Osiand. 3. But it is not necessarie to presse euery part of a parable, it is sufficient if it hold in that, wherein the application consisteth: as the purpose of the prophet here is to lay open the wrong which Dauid had done, in taking his neighbours only wife, him∣selfe hauing many. 5. Quest. v. 5. Whether the sentence of death pronounced by Dauid, were according to the Lawe. The Lawe of Moses against theft was, that the theife should restore fiue oxen for one, and fowre sheepe for one, Exod. 22.1. but here Dauid giueth sentence of death against the oppressor. 1. Some thinke that Dauid thus speaketh onely to exaggerate the offence, not as meaning he should die: like as a Iudge may say to shewe the greatnesse of the male-factors offence, that he is worthy of a thousand deaths: but it appeareth by Nathans answer afterward vnto Dauid vpon his repentance, v. 13. thou shalt not die, that Da∣uids meaning was, that such an offender indeede was worthie to die: and so Iosephus also vnderstandeth it. 2. Some answer that it was in the Iudges power to adde to the punishment, or take from it pro ratione circumstantiarum, according to the circumstances: Martyr: which may indeede bee safely affirmed in punishments of the same nature and kind: as in pecuniarie mulcts, and corporall castigations: but to change the kind of the punishment, as to inflict death vpon the malefactour, where the lawe imposed not the penaltie of death, might seeme an open and apparant transgression of the lawe.
3. Therefore the best answer is, that euen by Moses law, some kind of theft might be censured with death; as he that did breake thorough an house, he might be slaine, Exod. 22.3. this theft then beeing ioyned with rapine and violence; and beeing a theft of wantonnesse, not of necessitie, as when one stealeth to satisfie his hunger, might iustly receiue the sentence of death. 4. And beside Dauid adiudgeth, that he should restore foure fold, according to the Law, Exod. 22.1. but some vnderstandeth dubble fourefold, that is eightfold, because the word arbaghtaim, fowrefold, is put in the duall number: so Vatab. Pellican. bt that is no good reason: the like word shobhghathaim, seauenfold, is likewise put in the duall number, Isay. 30.26. and yet signifieth there onely seauenfold, not twice seauenfold: Iun. Indeed, it is probable, that the Iudge might award restitution in a greater proportion then fourefold, according to the qualitie of the sinne: as Prov. 6.30. The theefe, if he be found, shall restore seauenfold: though some by seauenfold in that place, vnderstand often: Iun. that the theefe as often as he is found, should make restitution. But in this place there is no necessitie so to vnderstand the word, specially seeing the punishment was aggrauated by the sentence of death. 6. Quest. How God gaue Dauids Lords wiues into his bosome. 1. By his Lords wiues, to vnderstand women, which were Gods creatures, and so by the Lord, God himselfe, is a coact and forced exposition. 2. Some by wiues, vn∣derstand concubines; and so the Hebrewes thinke that here Michol and Rizpah are vnderstood, the one Saul daughter, the other Sauls concubine, which Dauid had: so also Pellic. Genevens. 3. Osiander thus expoundeth, that Dauid had libertie to take any of Sauls wiues or concubines, as he desired, though he did it not: but it was not lawfull for him to marrie any of his father in lawes wiues: for as it was vnlawfull to marrie the father or mother in law, so also the husband or wife of the father or mo∣ther in law: for there is the same degree of distance. 4. Pet. Martyr by his Lords wiues, vnderstandeth women vnder Sauls subiection: but so any man might haue ta∣ken Sauls wiues, for all had beene subiect to Saul: it had beene no great priuiledge to Dauid. 5. Some make this the meaning, that God deliuered into Dauids bosome, that is, into his power and subiection, Sauls wiues as the dearest things which belon∣ged vnto him: Iun. not to marrie them, but to handle them at his pleasure: but the phrase, to deliuer into the bosome, signifieth some present fruition, rather then a powerfull subiection of his Lords wiues: I preferre then the second exposition be∣fore, that Dauid had his Lords wiues, women, or concubines: for so Dauids wiues, v. 11. are called, c. 16.21. both because Michol his wife was Sauls daughter, and some of his concubines also Dauid might haue. 7. Quest. Whether the Lord doe here vpbraid Dauid with the benefits bestowed vpon him. Whereas Saint Iames saith, God giueth to all men liberally, and reproacheth no man, c. 1.5. and yet the Lord seemeth here to vpbraid Dauid with the benefits receiued: 1. Some answer, that the Apostle speaketh onely of prayer, that though one should aske a thousand times of God, he doth not put them by, as men vse to say to impor∣tunate suitors, that they had that or this graunted them before: but this doth not fully satisfie, for the Lord neither in prayer, or otherwise, is an vpbraider of his bene∣fites. 2. But the Apostles meaning is, that God vseth not to cast any in the teeth, as men vse to doe, to shame them, and reproach them; God vseth a commemoration of his benefits to an other end, to stirre men vp to thankefulnesse, and by the consideration thereof, to bring them to repentance: to the which end the Lord putteth Dauid in mind here of the benefits which he had conferred vpon him. Mart. 8. Quest. v. 10. How the sword is threatned not to depart from Dauids house for euer. 1. Some doe extend this time, vnto the comming of the Messiah, that the sword should not depart from Dauids house vntill then; but this seemeth to be against that rule of Gods iustice, who threatneth to visite the iniquitie of the father vpon the chil∣dren,
onely to the third and fourth generation. 2. Some doe vnderstand this prophecie of Dauids posteritie, which succeeded in the kingdome, vntill the captiuitie of Babylon: for they were continually scourged with the sword of the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and other nations: but this threatning is rather to be referred to the domesticall bloodie contentions, that should fall out in Dauids house among themselues. 3. This prediction therefore was fulfilled in Dauids house, al Dauids life long: Ab∣shalom killed Ammon, Ioab Abshalom, who did rebell against his father: and Salo∣mon put Adoniah to death: so it came to passe according to Nathans words, that the sword did not depart from his house for euer, that is, during his life: for so is the word gholam sometime taken: as, Gen. 43.9. Iudah saith to his father, If I bring him not vnto thee, &c. let mee beare the blame for euer: that is, as long as I liue. Mar. 9. Quest. v. 11. How the Lord is said to haue giuen Dauids wiues, that is, concubines to Abshalom. 1. This is said to be Gods act, not that the Lord is the author or worker of any sinne: but in these respects. 1. Not onely because God did permit Abshalom so to doe, Osiand. neither did hinder him, but withdrew his grace from him. 2. But fur∣ther, because God had an ouerruling hand, directing and disposing this act of Ab∣shaloms to such end, as the Lord intended. 3. And this fact in Abshalom, must be considered partly as a sinne, partly as a punishment of sinne: in which respect God had an hand in it, as it serued for the chastisement of Dauid. 4. Beside, in euery act there are two things to be considered, actio, & defectus, the action, and defect: the naturall power of acting or effecting any thing, is of God; the defect, is from man. Mart. 2. But although God concurred here as a iust Iudge in the fact of Abshalom, yet he is no whit therein excused: for he respected not Gods will or counsell therein; but of a rebellious and despightfull mind, did it to disgrace his father: as Iudas, though Christ were deliuered ouer according to the decree and determination of God, yet was lead of a couetous and treacherous mind to doe it, and his sinne was not any way qualified or lessened thereby. 10. Quest. v. 13. Of Dauids confession of his sinne. 1. There is great difference between the confession of the righteous, and of hypo∣crites. 1. In respect of the condition of their persons: the one are beloued of God, by the grace of election, the other are reiected. 2. In regard of the end, the one confes∣seth vnto saluation, but the other vnto destruction; such was the confession of Iudas. 3. The manner of their confession is diuerse, the one in their repentance hah hope of forgiuenes: the other are driuen to confesse of a seruile feare without any hope, as Caine and Iudas. Borrh. 2. Though Dauids contrition be short, yet was it effectuall, and it proceeded from a right contrite heart: Saul in many words confessed his sinne to Samuel, yet it was but in hypocrisie. 3. Dauid saith he had sinned vnto God, because he had no superiour Iudge in the earth, that could call him to account. Mart. 11. Quest. v. 14. How Dauids sinne beeing remitted, yet some punishment is inflicted vpon him. 1. The Romanists vpon this example, doe ground that assertion of theirs, that the sinne beeing remitted, the punishment may still remaine: which they make the ground of their purgatorie-paines, where for a while they, whose sinnes are pardoned, do yet indure some torment. 2. But this doctrine hath no warrant from Gods word: for where God once re∣mitteth sinnes, he remembreth them no more: they shall not be mentioned, Esech. 18.22. but if the punishment of sinne should remaine, there a remembrance of sinne is also reuiued: wherefore together with the sinne, paena vltionis, the punishment of re∣uenge is remitted: those penalties which remaine, are for the example of others, and
the further admonition of the parties themselues: non sunt paen irati, sed amantis Dei, they are the chastisements, not of an angrie, but a louing God. Mar. 12. Quest. Of the diuerse punishments of adulterie. The punishment which is imposed vpon Adulterie, is either diuine or humane: and this is either Ciuill, or Ecclesiasticall: which shall be breifly shewed in their or∣der. 1. The Diuine censure, is either that which is grounded vpon the law of nature, or declared more euidently in the Scripture. By the first law of nature euen the Gentiles and others before the law written, iudged adulterie worthie of death: as Abimelech decreed, that whosoeuer touched Isaak or his wife should die the death, Gen. 26.11. Potiphar adiudged Ioseph for the like suspicion, though most false, vnto the place & prison of capitall offenders, Gen. 39. Iudah gaue sentence that Thamar who had plai∣ed the whoore, beeing promised, and so espoused to Selah, to be burned. By the po∣sitiue and written law of Moses, the adulterer and adulteresse were to die, though the one were not actually maried, but onely betrothed, Deut. 22.23. 2. Humane Ciuill lawes were of diuerse sorts; some were corporall in the chastis∣ment of the bodie without death. The Egyptians, as witnesseth Diodorus Siculus, did cut off the nose of the adulteresse, and did beate the adulterer with many stripes almost to death. Zalenius among the Locrensians made a law, that the adulterer should loose both his eyes: and it so falling out, that his sonne was taken in adulterie, he to satis∣fie the law, caused one of his sonnes eyes to be put out, and one of his owne: as Aelia∣nus testifieth, lib. 13. Among the Germanes (witnesse Cornelius Tacitus) the adulte∣resse was stript naked, her haire beeing cut off, and her husband beat her vp and down with a staffe. The people called Laciadae, as Suidas, or Placiadae, did punish the adul∣terer about his priuie parts. Some punished adulterie with publike shame, and infamie, as Plutarke writeth how the people Gortinei would bring them forth into publike view,Plut. in Prob. which were taken in adulterie, and crowne them with wooll, shewing thereby their effeminate nature: the Cumians set the adulteresse vpon a stone, where she was mocked of all the people, and then caried about vpon an asse, and euer after that was in disdaine, called , an asse-rider. Among the Romans, the law of Augustus Caesar, called lex Iulia, thus pro∣uided against those which committed adulterie. 1. The adulterer and adulteresse were both held as infamous persons, the adulteresse straight after she was deprehended in the fact, the adulterer after he was publikely condemned. 2. They lost the dowrie and marriage gift. 3. The accuser in this case could not be agreed with for money, as in other capitall crimes. 4. The woman could not accuse the husband of adulterie, but the husband the wife, or her father, or her brethren. 5. It was not lawfull for the man to kepe his wife conuicted of adulterie, but he was held as a bawde to his own wife: neither was it lawfull for any to marrie her. 6. By this law, they were punish∣ed which did but sollicite others to adulterie. 7. The souldiers which committed a∣dulterie, were discharged from their coulors. Beside this ignominie and shame among the Romans such incurred, the adulteresse was brought forth publikely in her husbands gowne: and sometime such were con∣demned to the brothelhouses and stewes. But Theodosius abolished that euill vse, least sinne should by this meanes be added vnto sinne. Some haue punished adulterie with death: as the Arabians, as Strabo witnesseth,Among what nations adulte∣rie wa puni∣shed by death. lib. 16. Saletus the Cratonian made a law, that adulterers should be burned aliue (as Lucianus testifieth.) And beeing himselfe detected of adulterie, hauing by an oration in his owne defense almost perswaded the people to haue compassion toward him, he voluntarily leaped into the fire. Among the Athenians it was lawfull to kill the adul∣terer taken in the deed doing, as is euident in the oration of Lysias, which treateth of the death of Eratosthenes the adulterer. Among the Romans likewise it was law∣full so to doe in the time of Cato, before the Iulian law: as Seneca in his declamations putteth the case of one, that disinherited his sonne, because taking his wife with one in adulterie, and bidding him to kill them both, he refused to doe it. But afterward this libertie was restrained: the husband was forbidden to kill his wife taken in adul∣terie,
the adulterer he might; least that men by this meanes, might haue practised a∣gainst their wiues. Further, Iulius Caesar put one to death for playing the adulterer with a certen ma∣trone: Opilius Macrinus vsed to burne the adulterer and adulteresse together: Aure∣lianus (as Vopiscus testifieth) caused a souldier, which had defloured his hosts wife, to be rent in sunder by the toppes of trees tied to his bodie. Augustus caused Proclus to die for adulterie: Constantine made a law, decreeing capitall punishment vnto adulterers, which continued vntill the time of Hierome, who writeth of a woman suspected of adulterie seauen times smitten with a sword. Iustinian after mitigated this law on the part of the adulteresse,Epist ad Innoc. decreeing such to be beaten with clubbes, and then thrust into a monasterie: but concerning the adulterer, the punishment remained still. Tiberius banished the adultresse 200. miles out of the citie, the adulterer was expel∣led out of Italie and Africa. And such were the ciuill punishments inflicted vpon such as committed adulterie. Mart. 3. And such for the most part were the ciuill ordinances and decrees against adul∣terie, as we haue seene: the Ecclesiasticall censures were also of diuerse sorts. 1. In some places they denied the peace of the Church to adulterers, neuer admit∣ting them to the communion: some recieued such, but after a long time of penance: Cypriane misliked their rigour that vtterly denie reconciliation vnto them, but altoge∣ther exclude them. lib. 4. epistol. c. 2 2. The Ancyrane synod imposed vpon adulterers seauen yeares penance, c. 14. which the Eliberine counsell brought to fiue yeares. 3. Ministers and Clergie men committing adulterie, were for euer remooued from their ministerie. distinct. 81. c. 11.12. 4. The councell of Neocaesarea decreed, that if a Ministers wife fell into the sinne of adulterie, hee should dismisse her, or else leaue his Ministerie: and by the Eli∣berine councell, if he did it not, hee was denied for euer the communion of the Church. 5. If a Lay-mans wife were guiltie of adulterie, he neuer could be admitted vnto the order of the ministerie by the Canons. 6. It was likewise decreed, that the adulterer should not be suffered to marie with the adulteresse. 7. Iustinians constitution thrusteth the woman offending into a monasterie, and af∣ter two yeares, giueth libertie for the husband to take her out: but it punisheth the adulterer with death. And such for the most part also were Ecclesiasticall Constitutions against Adulterie. 13. Quest. What may iustly be excepted against in the former constitutions against adulterie. 1. In the Ciuill punishments, which were inflicted among the Heathen, these things were amisse. 1. They punished adulterie with death, leauing other greater sinnes vnpunished; as their Idolatrie, and blasphemie against God, which was the fountaine and very beginning of all vncleannes. 2. They were partiall, giuing the man libertie to accuse the woman, but the wo∣man was denied that priuiledge to accuse the man. 3. They for euer seperated the adulterer, and adulteresse: whereas the rule of charitie and Christian religion alloweth reconciliation vpon repentance. 2. In the Ecclesiasticall Canons, it was to bee misliked: 1. That they vtterly de∣nied the communion in some places vnto adulterers: for Dauid hauing repented of his sinne, was receiued againe to the peace of the Church. 2. In that they allowed no reconciliation betweene a Clergie man and his adulte∣rous wife: for why should lesse mercie be shewed and practised among them, then in other callings and degrees? 3. In vtterly making vnlawfull the marriage betweene the adulterer, and adulte∣resse: indeed, if they contracted marriage, the former wife and husband liuing, it was not fit: for it might giue occasion of suspition, that they might practise against, and lie in waite for their life: but such marriages in other cases beeing consummate, are
not to be dissolued: for then had the mariage betweene Dauid and Bathshebah bin vnlawfull. 4. The greatest fault now is in shewing too much lenitie to adulterous per∣sons: they should for a time bee excluded from the Church, with the incestuous younge man among the Corinthians, till they are sufficiently humbled, and vpon their teares, and repentance, and true contrition, be receiued into the Church a∣gaine. 14. Quest. Whether an adulterous woman vpon her repentance, may not be receiued againe of her husband. By the Iulian law they were forbidden either to be entertained again of their hus∣bands, or to be married to another: but it is more agreeable to Christianitie, that there should be reconciliation betweene the innocent and offending partie, vpon her true repentance. And the constitution of Iustinian was more equall in this behalf, which gaue libertie vnto the man after two yeares, to redeeme his wife for her adul∣terie condemned to a monasterie: the reasons are these. 1. Augustine thus reasoneth: Deus est imitandus, &c. God is to be imitated:lib. 2. ad Pollen∣tium de adult. conig. his people Israel diuerse times committed spirituall fornication, and fell into idolatrie: the which the Lord did for a time as dismisse them, and giue them ouer to the hands of their enemies, but he was againe vpon their repentance reconciled vnto them. 2. Dauid receiued his wife Michol, beeing maried to another, wherein she com∣mitted manifest adulterie, for there was no diuorce before betweene Dauid and her. 3. Seeing vpon repentance, the adulterous woman is restored vnto the kingdom of God, much more is it fit she should returne to the societie of her husband; si regno caelorum restituta est, non potest toro tuo restitui? if she be restored to the kingdome of heauen, can she not be restored to thy bed? 2. The counsell of Arles decreed further,Extra de ad. cp. 1 v. se. si adulteram paenituerit debet vir eum re∣cipere, if the adulterous woman repent her, the man ought to receiue her, the former reasons brought by Augustine, tend to perswade the lawfulnes and equitie in recei∣uing the penitent offender, not to impose a necessitie, as this Canon doth: for seeing the Gospel giueth libertie to dismisse the wife for fornication, he sinneth not that v∣seth this libertie; yet he doth the better, that vpon the womans repentance,Matth. 5. . yeldeth somewhat of his strict and rigorous right, to receiue her againe. 3. But where the partie offending hath no remorse, there if the innocent partie should admit of a reconciliation, he should seeme to be particeps iniquitatis, parta∣ker of the sinne, as the said Counsell resolueth. 15. Quest. Whether a man ought to accuse his wife beeing dismissed for adulterie. 1. It is here to be considered, whether the partie offending continue in the sinne of adulterie stil; for in this case, after priuate admonition by freinds, taking no place, Christs rule then is to be followed, to tell it to the Church, that by publike autho∣ritie the partie may be reclaimed and amended. 2. Though the partie be penitent, yet if the sinne be notorious and publike, and the innocent partie therein should seeme, by silence and conniuence to boulster out the others sinne: or if there be an adulterous seede, which is like to be taken for the heire of the familie, if the sinne be kept secret: in these cases the Church is to be made acquainted, for the preuenting of both these mischiefes. 3. Where none of these dangers are feared, it is better for the innocent partie to follow Iosephs example, who thought secretly to send Marie away, being yet igno∣rant, how she became with child. P. Martyr. 16. Quest. Whether adulterie be a more grieuous sinne in the man, or the woman. 1. Some doe thus obiect, to shew that the sinne is greater on the womans behalf: 1. Because by the Iulian law among the Romans, it was lawfull for the man to accuse the woman of adulterie, but not for the woman to accuse the man: and before that
law it was lawfull for the man to kill his wife taken in adulterie, but not for the wo∣man to doe the like to the man. 2. It was lawfull by the auncient Romane laws for the man to diuorce or seperate his wife, but not for the wife to be diuorced from her husband. 3. By the law of Vespasian, as Suetonius writeth, the woman that did companie with a seruant, became her selfe bound, but the like seruitude was not laid vpon the man offending in the like. 4. In Ecclesiasticus, cap. 7.27. and in other places of that booke, great charge is giuen vnto parents to keepe their daughters; but the like care is not enioyned for their sonnes. Contra. These arguments may easily be answered. 1. These were but humane laws, & some of them were vniust and cruell; as to giue libertie to men to slay their wiues taken in adulterie: and the Romans themselues by the Iulian law abolished that cruell custome: the other lawes, which giue preheminence vnto the man, res∣pected the politicke state, which was more hindered, by the adulterie of women, in the confusion of families, and suborning of false heires: in which respect indeed, the fault is greater on the womans side. 2. So also it was made lawfull by some Imperiall lawes, for the women to seeke diuorce and separation from their husbands: as appeareth by the law of Theodosius. C. de repudijs in L. Cons.3. The Romane lawes did more punish the womans offence, for the aforesaid rea∣son, because the politike state receiued greater dammage thereby. 4. Parents also are there charged to giue vnto their sonnes good education: but the daughters are more carefully to be kept, because by their fall, their fathers house is defiled. 2. Now that the mans offence is the greater, it may be thus argued. 1. because the womans sex is weaker, and so much the more to be pitied. 2. The man is the head of the woman, and ought to giue her a good example. 3. The marriage faith is mu∣tually giuen, and therefore it is broken on the mans behalfe as well as the womans. 4. Men vsually are agents and entisers of women, and they are entised. 3. Wherefore the best resolution is this, that in respect of the mutuall bond of mariage and faith of each giuen to other, the offence on both sides is equall; but their persons considered, the man sinneth more, because he is the head. And in re∣gard of the commonwealth, the womans fault is more daungerous, in the confusion of families, and in obtruding false and supposed heires. Now yet the causes why the womans offence is counted more odious, the case being the same, are rendered to be these two: quia viri liberius agunt & non habent peccata latentia vindictam, the men are more readie & free to accuse their wiues: wo∣men are not so forward,Caus. 32. qu 5. cap. 23. beeing restrained by the modestie of their sex; and the mens faults are more secret, and so escape vnpunished: See more of this question, as like∣wise, whether adulterie is to be punished by death, to the which opinion P. Martyr enclineth here, Hexapl. in Exod. qu. 8.9. vpon the seauenth commandement. c. 20. but somewhat of the same question shall here be inserted. 17. Quest. Whether the sinne of adulterie ought to be punished by death. 1. P. Martyr laboureth by these reasons, to prooue the affirmatiue part. 1. Death by the law of Moses is inflicted vpon the adulterous persons, Leuit. 20.10. the adulterer, and adulteresse are both to die. 2. The order of the commandements sheweth as much; for all the transgressions of the first table, as idolatrie, blasphemie, violating of the Sabbath, and of the two first commandements of the second table, as disobedience to parents, murther, were punished by death, so also adulterie: then at the eight commandement the sword staieth, so likewise neither the 9. or 10. commandement were inforced with the pe∣naltie of death. 3. Seeing adulterie is more against the politike state, then theft simply, it should rather be punished by death, then the other: for who had not rather loose part of his goods, then his wife her honestie?
many intricate questions doe arise: as whether by diuorce the band of marriage bee dissolued: whether it be lawfull to marrie after diuorce: whether the innocent party only is to be suffered to marrie: whether the parties offending ought to be reconciled. 5. By the lenitie of punishment adulteries encrease, and this vice groweth to be publike and common. Contra. 1. That law of Moses was iudiciall and politike: it specially concerned the policie and state of that commonwealth, as shall be shewed afterward: therefore it simply bindeth not now. 2. Neither doth the sword beare sway now vnder the Gospel, in the punishing of the transgressions of all the former commandements vnto the seauenth by death: for it were too much rigour, to giue sentence of death for euerie breach of the Sabbath, or for euerie disobedience to Parents: neither doth the sword stay at the 8. commaun∣dement: for some kind of theft by the lawe of God is iudged worthie of death, as followeth presently to be shewed: and some kind of false witnesse: for he was to be done vnto, as he thought to doe vnto his brother, Deut. 19.18. If hee were a false witnesse against his brothers life, his owne life should be payed for it. 3. Adulterie is more against the commonwealth, then simple theft: but not then euerie kind of theft. And there are fowre kinds of theft by the law of God censured by the sentence of death. 1. theft of men, Exod. 21.16. 2. theft with violence, as breaking into an house, Exod. 22.3. and of the same sort is all kind of robberie. 3. sacriledge, the stealing of things consecrated to holy things; which was Achans case, Ios. 7.4. and wanton theft, when one stealeth not of necessitie to satisfie his hun∣ger, but of wantonnesse: as he which hauing many sheepe of his owne, tooke his poore neighbours onely sheepe, 2. Sam. 12.3. Dauid iudgeth such an one worthie of death. 4. Such questions are not superfluous and vnnecessarie: for then our blessed Saui∣our would not haue medled with them, to shew in what cases it was lawfull for a man to dismisse his wife, and marrie another, Matth. 5. and 19. 5. It is not for that adulterie is not punished by death, but because either straight punishments are not laid vpon adulterers, and too much lenitie is shewed, that this sinne so ouerfloweth in the world. 2. Now on the contrarie it may thus be reasoned, that adulterie is not now neces∣sarily to be sentenced by death. 1. Moses Iudicials doe not now necessarily bind, but in regard of the morall equi∣tie of them: P. Martyr saith, non magis not astringere ciuiles leges, &c. quàm cermoniales: but that cannot be safely affirmed: for Moses ceremonialls are absolutely and simply abrogated, and to reuiue them, were to violate and infringe the libertie of the gospel: but the Iudicialls are left indifferent, Christian Magistrates as they are not simply bound to retaine them, so they may vse them as they see it to bee fitting to the com∣monwealth: Now that this was one of the Iudicialls of Moses, it is euident by this: because it was peculiar to that state and pollicie, that the tribes and families should be distinguished and not confounded or mixt together: therefore it was fit that adulterie should be seuerely punished, by the which commeth the confusion of houses, corrup∣tion of blood, subornation of false heires. 2. Other iudiciall and penall lawes annexed to the morall precepts, are not nowe in force: as to put to death euerie one that violateth the Sabbaticall rest, or euery one that is stubburne against their Parents. 3. By Moses lawe onely that adulterie was punished which was committed with an other wife, Leuit. 20.10. for the man to take a concubine to his wife, or one wife to another, was not then counted adulterie, nor yet was punished by death; for then it would follow, that Abraham, Iacob, Dauid, with others vnder the law that had ma∣ny wiues, or some concubines beside their wiues, liued in adultery, which is no waies to be admitted: and the word adulterium, properly signifieth, alterius adire thorum, to goe vnto an others bedde. But now seeing Adulterie is either simplex, simple, when one of the parties is married, or duplex adulterium, double adulterie, when both par∣ties are married: there is no warrant from Moses lawe to punish single adulterie on
the mans behalfe with death. 4. Our blessed Sauiour, Ioh. 8.11. did dismisse the adulterous woman, not gi∣uing direction, that she should be stoned to death. But here diuerse answers are made. 1. That because they came to tempt Christ, either to accuse him of too much seuerity in condemning her, and so he should loose the fauour of the people, who commen∣ded him for his clemencie: or as a transgressor of the law, if he freed her: he doth so answer the Pharises, as that they should neither way haue aduantage against him. 2. He doth not condemne her, because he medled not with the Magistrates office. 3. He sawe her penitent, and therefore absolueth her. 4. He was no witnesse of her sinne, and therefore could not accuse her. Mart. Contr. 1. Our blessed Sauiour did not ambitiously seeke the fauour of the people, that he needed in that behalfe to suspend his iudgment concerning the rigour of Mo∣ses lawe: they could haue taken no exception vnto Christ, in ratifying of Moses law, if it had pleased him, that the rigour thereof should haue remained still: therefore that was not the cause of his silence therein. 2. Though as a Magistrate he would not inflict punishment, yet as a teacher hee might haue giuen direction, as he did in an other case concerning the bill of diuorce, Matth. 19. 3. The inward repentance did not dispense with the outward punishment, which was for the example of others. 4. Christ needed not in this case to bee a witnesse: for there were other witnesses beside, that said she was taken in the verie deed doing: yet though he neither tooke vpon him to be witnes, accuser, or iudge in this case, our Blessed Sauiour might, and in all liklihood would haue giuen direction to take a course according to Moses law, if his will had beene to haue that obserued as a perpetuall lawe. 5. Wherefore this is most probable, that although our blessed Sauiour by this his silence, intended not altogeher to abrogate Moses lawe, yet it pleased him well it should not be so rigorously executed, when he said, let him that is among you without sinne cast the first stone at her.lib. . ad Poll. c. 6, 7. This place is by Augustine vrged to the same end, to shew, that adulterie is not necessarily to be met withall by death. And in an other place he maketh this application of it, that Christ beeing two wayes vrged by the Pharisies; if he bid her to be stoned to death, they would accuse his seueritie; if he set her free, they would blame his lenitie: therefore Christ giueth such an answer, as might pre∣uent both these exceptions; in that he saith, let him that is without sinne, &c. iustitiae vox est,om. 10. ser. 47. puniatur peccator, sed non à peccatoribus, &c. let the offender be punished, but not by them which are likewise offenders: audiamus etiam mansuetudinis vocem, &c. let vs heare also the voice of clemencie, neither doe I condemne thee: not that Christ did winke at sinne, sed damnauit, non hominem sed peccatum, he condemned, not the par∣tie, but the sinne, saying, Goe, sinne no more. 6. S. Paul also, whereas the lawe of Moses decreeth him to be put to death, that should lie with his fathers wife, Leuit. 20.11. yet maketh no mention of any such pu∣nishment to be imposed vpon the incestuous young man, that had taken his fathers wife, 1. Cor. 5. and 2. Cor. 2. If it be answered, that the Christians had no beleeuing Magistrates then, but the sword was in the hand of Pagans; yet in such ciuill punish∣ments, it was the Apostles mind, that they should submit themselues to the ciuil pow∣er: for he was the Minister of God, to take vengeance on him that did euill, Rom. 13.4. 7. Wherefore it is euident, that no certen punishment is appointed vnder the Go∣spel for adulterie: but that it is free for euery state to punish it either by death, or by some other grieuous censure, according to the qualitie of the sinne: As the Egyptian law was to cut off their noses, and to disfigure them; the Germanes beate them with cudgels; Tiberius banished them. By these or any like courses, adulterie may be sharp∣ly enough punished: only the fault is, when by too much lenitie and conniuence, men make but a sport of this sinne. 18. Quest. v. 14. Of Nathans words to Dauid, thou shalt not die. 1. There are three kinds of death; a naturall end, a violent death, and euerlasting
death in the next world: from these two last, Dauid is deliuered; that neither hee should die eternally, nor presently by the sword, or by Gods hand, as he had cause to feare: Mart. 2. Wherein the Lord sheweth him mecy, in reuersing the sentence which he had giuen against himselfe before: Borrh. 3. And thus much is insinuated, that he should not die for this, but others of his hous, as his child, in whome he see∣med in some part to die: Mart. and though he should not die, yet hee was to endure amariora morte, things more bitter then death: Pellican. 4. And here appeareth the difference of the law, which in Dauid saith, he was the child of death: and of the Go∣spel, which by Nathan saith, thou shalt  die: Borrh. 19. Quest. v. 14. How Dauid is said to haue caused the ene∣mies of God to blaspheme. 1. Some vnderstand it of the peruerse and wicked men in Israel, that would take occasion hereby to accuse the Lord of iniustice, for preferring Dauid before Saul, who was not detected of ny such sinne of adulterie: But they properly could not be said to be the enemies of God; he meaneth such as were professed aduersaries. 2. Pet. Martyr referreth it to the triumph of the Ammonites, who put the Israe∣lites to flight, and slewe diuerse of them together with Vriah, and so thereby were occasioned to insult against God. 3. Vatablus expoundeth it thus, that they should blaspheme God, because he had set vp a wicked man to be king. 4. But the better sense is, to vnderstand it of the generall reproach of religion: that the Gentiles seeing Dauid commit such sinnes, as were odious among thē, should thereby take occasion to condemne the religion it selfe as false, and not him to be true God, whom they worshipped. Borrh. 20. Quest. v. 14. Why the child dieth borne in adulterie. 1. The children may temporally and corporally be punished for the sinnes of their parents, who themselues are touched when they see the miserie of their children: O∣siand. 2. But none shall suffer for an other eternall punishment: Mart. 3. And much vnlike are Gods iudgements vnto the ciuill lawes of men: for here the child is not to suffer for the parents offence: with God it is otherwise, before whome none is inno∣cent. Borrh. 4. And if the child were altogether faultlesse, no punishment could lie vpon him: but seeing the infant hath originall sinne, and is a part of the parents, God may most iustly in his secret iudgement hasten that ende sooner, which by the course of nature euerie one is subiect vnto: Borrh. 5. And God in his wisedome did take away this child, because hee should haue liued but to bee a shame vnto Dauid. Mart. 21. Quest. v. 16. Why Dauid be sought the Lord for the child, whom the Prophet said should die. Dauid doth not herein oppose himselfe to Gods will. 1. He might thinke that this commination was conditionall, that vpon his teares and repentance, the Lord might reuerse his sentence, as he did when Hezekiah was sicke, and when Ionas preached against the Ninivites. 2. And although these examples followed after Dauids time, yet there were the like before: as Dauid might remember, how the Lord commaunded Abraham to sa∣crifice his sonne, yet it pleased him otherwise: and the Lord threatned to destroy Is∣rael, but he was entreated to spare them at the intercession of Moses, Numb. 14. 3. And Dauid herein onely shewed his naturall affection, still subordinating his prayer to the will of God: as Christ did to shew his humane condition, when he prai∣ed that the cuppe might passe from him. 4. Hereby also Dauid sheweth his confidence, how sure and certen he was, that the Lord had pardoned his sinne, seeing he was bold to make intercession for his son. Pel. 22. Quest. v. 18. Vpon what seauenth day the child died: and what is gathered thereupon. 1. Borrhaius saith it was the seuenth day of his sickenesse, which is a criticall day: for then the sickenes vsually abateth or encreaseth more: But this being a sicknes sent of god vpon this child, there was no vse of any such naturall obseruation: therfore it is
agreed by the Hebrewes, that it was th seaunth day from the birth of the chid: so also Iun. Mart. 2. Now in that this child dying vpon th seauenth day was not circumcised, and yet Dauid was cheared after the childs death, a not doubting of the saluation there∣of: Dauid was not then of that minde, which the Romanists are of now, to thinke his child damned for want of circumcision, as they hold all infants dying without baptisme to be excluded heauen: But, gratia non est alligata symboli: Gods grace is not ied vnto the signe.Controv. The contemp, not the want of baptisme con∣demneth. The Romanist themselues allowe of that distiction of bap∣tisme, fluminis, flaminis, sanguinis, the baptisme of water, of the spirit, of blood: that the martyrdome of the Saints, that shed their blood for Christ, the inward worke of the spirit, supplyeth in many th want of baptisme by water. Mart. Pellic. 3. We see by this president, that God may often refuse his owne seruants in tem∣porall things; for Dauid obtained not his petition here. Osiand. 4. And in that this child liueth not, but Salomon next borne liued, therein is sha∣dowed forth the old man, which must die in the members of Christ, and the newe man, which must liue vnto God, Borrh. 23. Quest. v. 20. Whether Dauid was not vncleane, and his house, by the dead corps of the childe. 1. Whereas there is a Law, Numb. 19.14. that when one died in a tent, all that came into the tent, and whatsoeuer was in the tent, should be vncleane seuen dayes: and yet Dauid presently after the death of the infant, washed himselfe; and went vp into the house of God: the places are thus reconciled; that Dauids house must bee supposed to be verie large; the verie place where the child died was vncleane, as the tent was wherein any died: but it is like, that Dauid came not at that place, nor neere the infant: All his house could not thereby be made vncleane; for the Arke of God was at this time in Dauids house, in a Tabernacle which Dauid had prepared for it. Martyr. 24. Quest. v. 23. Why Dauid leaueth weeping, the child beeing dead. 1. One reason was, because Gods will now appeared, that hee would not retract his former decree concerning the death of the child: Osiand. for then if he had con∣tinued praying still, he should seeme to haue spurned against Gods will. 2. Though Abraham beleeued that God could haue raised vp Izaak from the dead, when he was commaunded to sacrifice him:Hebr. 11.19. yet Dauid had no such hope here, because hee had no such promise of this child, as Abraham had of Izaak: Mart. 3. An other reason why Dauid ceaseth mourning, is because no singular thing had befallen the child: he was borne to die, and Dauid himselfe should also follow after. Pellic. 4. Some doe gather a third reason, why Dauid stayeth mourning, because he was perswaded the child was well: for he saith, he should goe vnto him: but of his owne saluation he doubted not: the rest of our writers doe interpret this phrase generally, of beeing dead: as likewise that which the counterfeit Samuel said to Saul, to morrow thou and thy sonnes shall be with me.1. Sam. 28.18. But I rather thinke, with Augustine, that the speciall estate and condition of the dead is thereby insinuated: and thereupon hee doth collect, that it was not true Samuel, which appeared to Saul, because he telleth a lie:Ad Simplic. lib. 2. qu. 3. for, magno intervallo separari bonis à mlio legimus, &c. we finde, that the good are a great way separated frō the euill in the next world. And this phrase is like to that when the Patriarche are said to bee gathered to their people:See Hexapl. in Genes. c. 25. qu. 15. that is, not onely dead, but in the state of grace, associate vnto the blessed companie of Saints in heauen. 5. But why doth not Dauid mourne for this infant, and yet made such lamentati∣on for Saul, Ionathan, Abner, Absalom? Dauid mourned for some of them, because the commonwealth sustained great losse by them; and for others, because they died in their sinnes, as Absalom: here is no such cause in respect of the one, or the other. Mart. 6. This example of Dauid in praying for the liuing child, but ceasing to pray
for him beeing dead, euidently conuinceth the errour of the Romanists,Controv. A∣gainst payer for the dead. who make superstitious prayers and intercessions for the dead: Dauid here sheweth, that it is in vaine to pray for them which are departed: Borrh. Mart. 25. Quest. v. 24. How Dauid comforted Bathsheba, now called his wife. 1. Bathsheba was in heauinesse, not onely for the death of the child, but because of the sinne which they had committed; and therefore Dauid did his part to comfort her: Osiand. 2. The Hebrewes thinke, that Bathsheba refused to companie with Dauid, least that child might haue died as the former did, and therefore Dauid told her, that this child was borne vnto the kingdome, and that the Messiah should come of him: whereupon she required Dauid to sweare vnto her that he should be king. But as it is certaine, that Dauid did sweare vnto her for this matter, 1. King. 1.30. so it is vncer∣taine, whether it was at this time: her name indeede signifieth, the daughter of an oath: but she was so called before this oath was made vnto her by Dauid. 3. The spe∣ciall comfort that Dauid ministred vnto her, was in declaring vnto her, how God had forgiuen them their sinne: Mart. 4. This also is to be noted, that whereas at the birth of the first child conceiued in adulterie, she was called the wife of Vriah, v. 15. now the Lord hauing forgiuen their sinne, and ratified the mariage, she is called Da∣uids wife. Pellic. 26. Quest. v. 24. Of Salomons name, who gaue it him, and why. 1. Here Dauid is said to call his name Salomon; but, 1. Chron. 22.9. the Lord is said also to haue giuen him that name: so Dauid gaue it by direction from God, by the hand, that is, ministerie of his Prophet Nathan: by whom also the Lord sent and called him by an other name, Iedidiah, that is, beloued of God. Some vnderstand, that Dauid sent the child by Nathans hand, that is, committed the education of him to the Prophet: Osiand. But it is euident, Prou. 31. in the title, that Salomon in his in∣fancie and childhood, was brought vp vnder his mother Bathshebah, and he was yet too young to be committed to any other. 2. And here it is to be obserued, that the Lord vseth the ministerie of Nathan, as before in sending an heauy message to Dauid, so now in bringing comfortable newes: as Isaias to Hezekiah was a messenger both to tell him of death, and againe of the prolonging of his dayes, least there might be thought some difference and variance betweene the Prophets, if the Lord should haue vsed any other messengers then them. Mart. 3. And in that Salomon is called Iedidiah, beloued of God, it may be an argument of his eternall saluation: that he was not a reprobate or cast-away, but was renewed againe after his fall by repentance. 4. These two names, Salomon and Iedidiah, signifie the one peace, which Israel enioyed vnder Salomons raigne, and the loue of God toward Salomon: this latter more was giuen him, baghabur iehouah, for the Lord, that is, for Christs sake, in whom he was acceptable vnto God; Iun. and of whome he was a liuely type, both in re∣spect of the spirituall peace of Christs kingdome, and he was indeede the onely be∣loued sonne of God. Borrh. 27. Quest. v. 27. What citie of waters it was that Ioab had taken. 1. Ioab continued almost a yeare in besieging the citie of Rabbah, which was the cheife citie of the kingdome: for it was no maruell, that God gaue him no better suc∣cesse abroad, Dauid hauing so displeased him by his sinne at home: and Dauid also beeing lulled asleepe, and giuing himselfe to pleasure, had no care to set forward that publike businesse. Mart. 2. This citie of the kingdome called afterward the citie of waters, as some thinke, was an other citie beside: Emman. Sa. but it is euident, v. 29. that it was the same citie. 3. Some thinke that the citie consisted of diuerse parts, whereof one that was en∣vironed with water, and so stronger then the rest, was held by the king, which Ioab
had now taken: Borrh. Vatab. Osiand. as the citie Syracuse had foure parts, like fowre little cities: one was called Insula, the Island, an other Acrodina, the third Tychia, the fourth Neapolis: Mart. But though Ioab had taken some part, as it might be the base townes or suburbs: yet it is euident that he had not taken the cheife part, for af∣terward Dauid came and besieged Rabbah, and tooke it, where the king was, whose crowne he tooke to himselfe. 4. Therefore Iunius interpretation here is more fit: that he tooke the citie of wa∣ters, that is, by a certaine figure called hypallage, the waters of the citie: and so Iose∣phus saith, praecisis aquae ductibus, the conduits of water beeing cut off, the citie was in great distresse, pinched both with hunger and thirst: so that it was an easie matter now to take it. 5. Ioab as he was a companion of Dauid in all his afflictions, so now he is studi∣ous of Dauids honour, and would not haue this victorie ascribed vnto himselfe. Pel∣lican. 28. Quest. v. 30. Of the King of Ammons crowne which Dauid tooke from his head. 1. It seemeth that it was the vse of Kings in those dayes, to weare their crownes in battell, as Saul had his crowne with him, when he was slaine in battell, which the Amalekite tooke and brought to Dauid: And so here the kings crowne was taken from him, and set vpon Dauids head. 2. It was a verie massie crowne, it waighed a talent of gold: which Budeus valu∣eth at 7700. French crownes of gold: Munster at 18000. French crownes: Osian∣der at 1594. Rhene peices of gold: but this estimation is too great; the ordinary ta∣lent beeing set but at 60. pound waight of gold. Iun. 3. It was too massie to bee worne vpon any ones head: for there was as much gold in it, as went to the making of the golden candlesticke in the Sanctuarie, Ex∣od. 25. therefore some thinke that there was a load stone in the crowne, and so it was drawne vp with yron, and hung in the aire: but this is a meere deuise. Hierome taketh here the word molcham, which is translated their king, for their idol Milchom, for so they vsed to set crownes vpon their gods heads: but the word is molcham, their king, not milchom, which was the name of the idoll: this massie crowne therefore was not vsually worne, but it was a crowne of estate, which was onely set vpon the heads of their kings at their coronation, and other solemne times. 4. Now Dauid conuerted this crowne to his priuate vse, and yet transgresseth not that commandement, whereby they were charged not to bring into their houses the things consecrated to idols, Deut. 7.25. not because Dauid tooke it not himselfe, but it was brought vnto him by an other, which is R. Chimhi his conceit: for if it were not lawefull to take it himselfe, neither was it lawefull to receiue it at an others hands: But that charge was onely concerning the idolatrous implements of the Ca∣nanites, which they were not to meddle with: the spoiles of other nations they might take, so that they purged them with water or fire: and so they conuerted to their vse the spoile of the Madianites, Numb. 31.23. Lyran. Mart. 5. This falleth out iust vpon this vnciuill King, that as hee had cut the beards and garments of Dauids messengers, so he is spoyled of his princely robes, and his head is left naked without a crowne. Borrh. 29. Quest. v. 31. Of Dauids casting the Ammonites into the tile-kill. 1. The most doe so translate the word bemalchen, into the tile furnace: as Pagnin. Vatab. Mart. Osiand. Pellic. Latin. B. G. And some vnderstand it for the streetes, where the houses were couered with tiles; some for the furnace it selfe: but then they for malchen, must reade malbhen, chaunging the letter cheth, into the letter beth; deriuing the word of laban, which signifieth a bricke, or tile: but it is verie dangerous to make any such innouation and chaunge in the wordes of the Text. 2. Montanus maketh it a proper name, Malchon, which Iunius expoundeth, the fornace of Molech their Idol; which is most like: that herein the iustice of
God might appeare, that as they consecrated their sonnes thorough the fierie fornace vnto Molech their idol, so they themselues are iustly throwen into it. 30. Quest. v. 31. Of Dauids austeritie in putting the Ammonites vnder sawes, and vnder harrowes, whether hee therein did well. 1. We shall find that the seruants of God imployed to fight his battels, did shew the like examples of seueritie vpon the enemies of God. The Israelites cut off Adoni∣bezeks thumbes of his hands and feete, Iud. 1. Gedeon did teare the men of Succoth with briers and thornes, Iudg. 8.16. And yet herein they offended not, neither are re∣prehended in Scripture. 2. So Dauid in this place did execute the will and commandement of God vpon this idolatrous people, and therefore therein he sinned not. 3. They are cruell, which without cause doe shew seueritie, and delight in blood: but this sharpe course, which Dauid followeth belongeth vnto iustice: the Ammo∣nites were guiltie of most grieuous trespasses: 1. Beside the old grudge which they had against the people of God, in not releeuing them in the wildernesse, when they came out of Egypt. 2. They had broken and violated the law of nations, in abusing Dauids messengers. 3. They had taken occasion by the slaughter of Vriah, and o∣thers, to blaspheme, and insult against God. 4. They had disturbed all the nations round about, stirring them vp, and hiring them to ioyne with them against Dauid, c. 10. 5. Beside, they were most cruell and vile idolaters, sacrificing their owne children to their abominable Idol Molech; therefore they were thus worthely punished. Mart. 4. Iosephus thinketh, that thus he serued euery one, as well in this citie, as in others: but that appeareth to be otherwise, c. 17.27. for Shabi an other sonne of Nahash out of Rabbah of the Ammonites succoured Dauid, when he was pursued of Absalon: therefore it is like he thus serued the principall, which had beene ringleaders in this mischiefe. Osiand. 5. Herein Dauid also was a type of the Messiah, which should be reuenged to the full of the contemners of his word. Borr. CHAP. 13. 1. Quest. Of the chasticements which were laied vpon Dauid for his former offences. 1. AS Nathan had before told Dauid of two grieuous crosses, that the sword should not depart from his house, and that his owne concubines should be defiled by another, as he had committed two grieuous sinnes of murther, and adul∣terie, so Gods iustice which sleepeth not beginneth now to shew it selfe: three great calamities follow one in the necke of another; the deflouring of Thamar by Amnon, and his slaughter by Absalom, the defiling of Dauids concubines by Absalom, and his vnnaturall rebellion against his father. Borrh. 2. And in this first punishment, Dauid is paied home by the law of retalion: as he killed Vriah, hauing first committed adul∣terie with his wife, and betraied Vriah into his enemies hand: so here his daughter is rauished, his sonne Amnon slaine, and that also in the same manner by the treache∣rie of his brother. 3. Thus in Dauids familie, who was a worshipper of God, those foule enormities breake forth, which sheweth, that the Church of God is not per∣fect here in earth, but many offences may be raised euen among the people of God: whereby appeareth the errour of the old Novatians, and Donatists, and of the new Brownists (so called) which doe seperate themselues from the Church of God, because of the imperfections thereof. Mart. 2. Quest. v. 2. Of Amnons vnlawfull loue of his sister Thamar. Among other vncleane acts none are more odious, then incestuous copulations,
when within the degrees forbidden any dishonest act is attempted: which incestu∣ous coniunctions either by marriage or otherwise, are restrained for diuerse reasons. 1. One is for the reuerence which is to be yeelded vnto our kinred, not to come neare them to vncouer their shame: as Valerius Maximus writeth, that it was vn∣lawfull, for the father and his daughter to wash themselues one in the sight of an∣other. 2. Againe, by this restraint and prohibition, the families are kept chast: whereas if such commixtions betweene kindered were permitted, euery house would be de∣filed. 3. By this meanes loue is encreased by marriage with straunge families: whereas, if mariage were lawfull in the same kinred, many loues would bee swallowed vp together, both the naturall and matrimoniall loue. 4. Yea we see that such coniunctions are against the law of nature: for euen the more ciuill nations among the heathen, abhorred to come neare their owne kinred. 5. But aboue all, the law of God ought to take place, which most straightly for∣biddeth such incestuous mariages, Leuit. 28.20. and though the lawes of men should be silent herein, the iudgement of God will ouertake such: as is manifest here in the example of Amnon. So in the Romane Histories, Claudius that defiled his sister, was slaine of Milo: and Domitiane the Emperour guiltie of the like fault, was also slaine. 6. Thus Dauid is chastened in the deflouring of his daughter, and in the slaughter of his sonne: wherein the Lord doth iudge him not onely for the adulterie and mur∣ther, which he had committed, but for his rash marriage, which hee made with Maa∣cah the mother of Absalom, the daughter of an idolatrous king. c. 3.3. Mart. 3. Quest. v. 2. Of Amnons impotent affections, and of his loue-sickenesse. 1. There were two reasons of Amnons pining away, because two waies was his desire hindered: Thamar was his sister, and therefore he could not marrie her; and she was a virgin, and most surely kept: Osiand. 2. His affection thus languishing, his bodie was distempered: for the affections are in the grossest and basest part of the mind, which hath greatest affinitie with the bodie; and thereof it is, that the vehemencie of the affections bringeth the bodie into weakenesses, and diseases. 3. It is written that Seleucus, when his sonne Antiochus was in loue with his step∣mother his fathers wife, & pined away for loue, by the perswasion of the Phisitian E∣rasistratus, his father was content to part with his wife, and giue her vnto his sonne, rather then he should languish vnto death: But Amnon could not expect for the like at his fathers hand, beeing a man that feared God. 4. The Heathen say, there are three remedies against inordinate loue: : hunger and abstinence; time, that men should not hastily giue way vnto their affections, but doe all with mature deliberation: and the third is an halter: such was their doctrine, that ended with despaire: but Amnon here neglected indeed the right meanes, namely these, first in time to haue resisted his affections, and not to haue gi∣uen way vnto them: Pellican. secondly, to haue giuen himselfe to abstinence and some honest exercises, which might haue occupied his mind: then by some lawfull matri∣moniall loue, to haue ouercome his vnlawfull lust, and to haue praied vnto God for grace. Mar. 4. Quest. v. 5. Of Ionadabs wicked counsell. 1. Ionadab is called here Amnons freind: but indeed he was his foe: for a true friend will neither giue dishonest counsell, nor yet do any dishonest thing for his freind. Bor. 2. He is also called cacham, a wise and prudent man: but it was carnall, not spirituall wisedome: such a wise man, as the Prophet speaketh of, they are wise to doe euill, but to doe well, they haue no knowledge: Ierem. 4.22. 3. For in wise counsell two things must be considered, that both the end of a mans counsell be good, and that the meanes thereunto tending are also honest and lawfull: but Ionadabs counsell failed in both. Mart. 4. Such flattering counsellers abound in Princes courts, who are readie for their owne aduancement to serue the humors of great men, and by their craftie heads
doe deuise how to compasse their desire: Pellican. 5. Quest. v. 12. Of Thamars reasons and perswasions to Amnon. 1. First shee alleadgeth, that it was and vnusuall crime in Israel, which he offered, either to corrupt a virgin, or to commit fornication out of mariage, much more for one to corrupt his sister. Pellican. 2. Thou she sheweth the inconuenience in respect of himselfe▪ hee should be counted as one of the fooles of Israel, as a lewd and wicked person: Genevens. and a a man vnmeete to succeed his father in the kingdome beeing his eldest sonne; Mart. 3. In respect of her selfe, it would be a perpetuall shame vn∣to her: she could not hide or conceale that lewdnesse, if she should be with child by him. Osiander. 4. Then from entreating, she falleth to aduise and counsell him; that he would speake vnto her father, to giue her vnto him, But all these reasons would not content or satisfie his wicked mind: he still proceeded in his vile purpose to haue his will of her. 5. Now whereas the law was, that the virgin which was forced in the towne should crie out, Deut. 22.24. it is like that Thamar cried out, but none would come to deliuer her; or that Amnon kept her from crying. Some thinke that she held her peace, because she would not bring her brother to shame, or vpon hope of mar∣riage: but hope of marriage she could haue none, because it was against the Law, and shee was more to respect her owne fame, and honest name, then her brothers. 6. Quest. v. 23. Why Thamar saith, hee will not denie me vnto thee, seeing it was against the Law. 1. Lyranus with some others is of opinion, that Thamar was not Dauids daughter by Maacah, but that she was with child by another, when Dauid tooke her captiue in battell, and so Thamar beeing neither Amnons sister by father or mother, might be Amnons wife. But this is not like, for Amnon called her his sister, v. 6. and it seemeth that Thamar was borne after Absalom; as the phrase giueth, when Absalom had a sister: or, when to Absalom was a sister, v. 1. Iun. D. Chimhi thinketh also, that Thamar was Dauids daughter: but conceiued by him before she was conuerted to the faith of Israel. 2. Pellican giueth this exposition: that Thamar secretly vnderstood this condition, si fieri posset, if it might be, Dauid would not denie her to him: if it could not be done by marriage, much more vnlawfull was it out of mariage. 3. But it is more like, that by this meanes, she did dilationem quaerere, seeke delaies onely, and to gaine time: Iun. vt conatum adolescentis eluderet, to put off the young mans purpose. Osiand. Mart. For if she might haue beene Amnons wife, hee needed not to haue languished after her, and haue vsed such indirect meanes: and he should haue married her after, or paied her dowrie: neither of which was done. Mar. 7. Quest. Whether this degree of consanguinitie, or any othr might haue beene dispensed with. By occasion of these words of Thamar to Amnon, which sound as though Dauid might haue giuen Thamar to Amnon to wife, occasion i ministred briefly to consi∣der, whether any of the forbidden degrees may be dispensed with. 1. The Popes Canonists, and Canonicall Diuines doe hold,Contr. The de∣grees forbid∣den Leuit 19.20. can not be dispensed with. that the prohibition onely is naturall and morall betweene the father and the daughter, the mother and the sonne, that their marriage cannot be dispensed with, because they are one flesh: but all the other degrees may be dispensed with: for Adams sonnes tooke their sisters to wiues, Iacob married two sisters, Sarah was Abrahams neece: Iacobed Moses mo∣ther was Amram his fathers aunt. So it is their opinion, that the Pope may dispense with all degrees, sauing betweene the father and daughter, mother and sonne: as Ca∣ietan. And the practise of the Papall Church hath been accordingly,In Thom. 2.2. qu. 154. art. 9. Emmanuel king of Portugall, married two sisters: Catharine Queene of England two brothers: Fer∣dinandus King of Naples by licence from Pope Alxandr the 6. married his owne Aunt. And Martin the . did dispense with the marriage of the germane and natu∣rall sister. 2. But this is a most grosse opinion: 1. All these prohibitions are morall and natu∣turall: for the Cananites were cast out for such abominations, who were not bound
to Moses Iudicialls. 2. The necessitie of those times dispensed with those first marria∣ges, when there were no other to marrie with: and God in respect of that necessitie gaue a relaxation, saying, increase and multiplie. 3. The facts of the fathers cannot be ex∣cused from all imperfection: yet it was Iaacobs intent to marri but one, Laban by his subtiltie imposed the other vpon him. 4. These were the sinnes of the Heathen. Among the Persians the sonnes married with their mothers, the daughters with their fathers: it was lawfull among the Athenians for one to marrie his sister. Berosus wri∣teth that the Gyants of the old world refrained not such marriages. Caracalla said to his mother in law, O that it were lawfull: the impudent woman answered; si libet, licet, imperator dat leges, non accipit: if you lit, it is lawfull: for an Emperor giueth laws to others, he taketh none himselfe: ex Martyr. 8. Quest. v. 15. Of Amnons hatred of his sister. 1. Aristotle in his Problemes giueth this reason why inordinate loue is many times turned to hatred: as Potiphars wife, when she could not haue her desire hated Ioseph, as much as she loued him: and Nero after hee had abused his owne mother, so hated her that he killed her. The reason hereof Philosophers yeeld to be this: because the bodie is much altered in such acts of raging and burning lust, and the affection is chaunged withall. But if the reason hereof were naturall, it would alwaies haue the same effect: yet it hath not: for after that Shechem had rauished Dinah Iacobs daugh∣ter, he loued her ardently still, and affected her mariage. 2. R. Kimhi, and R. Solomon, thinke hat this was the cause; Thamar had hurt Am∣non in striuing with him, and she had railed vpon him, calling him foole, and giuing him such other opprobrious termes. But it appeareth by Thamars answer, that there was no cause at all giuen on her part of so great hatred, v. 16. 3. P. Martyr thinketh the reason thereof proceeded from the trouble and perplex∣itie of his conscience, beeing ashamed of that which hee had done: as the Apostle saith, What fruit had yee in those things, whereof yee are now ashamed? Rom. 6.22. But if Amnon had had any remorse, or feare of any shame before God, or men, he would ne∣uer for his owne credite sake haue thrust her out in such disgrace. 4. But one reason hereof is the difference betweene inordinate and vnlawfull lust, which endeth with hatred, and lawfull loue, which still more increaseth: and such are the baites and allurements of sinne, which haue a pleasant tast at the first, but in the end bite like a serpent: therefore one well-saith, voluptates non venientes sed abeun∣tes contemplandas: that pleasures must be considered not as they come, but as they go. Borrh. 5. But the greatest cause of all is, Dominum sic instituisse, that the Lord had so ap∣pointed, that this sinne should not be kept secret, that it might redound to the chastis∣ment and correction of Dauid. Pellic. Mar. 9. Quest. v. 19. Of Thamars lamentation. 1. She sheweth her griefe by these three signes: she put ashes on her head, rent her garments, and laid her hands on her head: which was a signe of mourning. Ier. 2.37. 2. Some read, she rent talarem tunicam, her side garments: so Ioseph. Lat. Pellic. but beside that the word passn signifieth rather, variam, Vatab. versicolarem, Iun. poly∣mitam: Mart. a garment of diuerse peeces or colours: it is noted v. 18. to haue bin a peculiar garment to Kings daughters: so was not a long and side garment: but par∣ticoloured garments were had in great estimation, Iud. 5.30. therefore Iacob made Io∣seph such an one, because he loued him: Gen. 37.3. Genevens. 3. She cried out as she went, not forbearing to crie out of her brother, and to shew what he had done, as some thinke, Mart. Pellic. but it seemeth rather, that she did not expresse the cause of her griefe: Osiand. for then Absalom needed not to haue said vnto her afterwards, hath Amnon thy brother beene with thee? and his counsell had come too late, that she should be quiet, because hee was her brother: that is, his shame would be the shame of them all; and as she was the Kings daughter, so he was his son, and that the Eldest: and therefore hee would haue respect to the one and the other: Iun. if she had blazed his name alreadie, this perswasion of her brother had come out of time.
10. Quest. v. 21. Of these words, Dauid, when hee heard these things was verie wrath: whether Dauid sinned not in sparing his sonne. 1. Some doe thinke that Dauid did purpose to punish his sonne for this follie, or villanie rather: but like a wise man he deferred it, watching his best opportunitie, as he dealt with Ioab and Shemei. Osiander. But it seemeth otherwise, that Dauid had no such intendment, for it was two yeares after before Absalon was reuenged of Am∣non. 2. An other opinion is, that Amnon might repent him of his sinne, and therefore Dauid pardoned it: but though repentance doe make reconciliation betweene God, and the offender; yet they which publikely transgresse should not be freed from the punishment, which is afflicted for the good example of others: Mart. 3. Some thinke, that it was not death to force a maid not betroathed: for that law Deut. 22.25. is concerning such as are espoused. But it must further be considered, that she was his sister, and so he committed incest, which was worthie of death. And beside, it was death for a virgin to play the whoare in her fathers house, Deut. 22.21. the like penaltie also lay vpon the sonne. 4. Others excuse Dauid, because this matter was not proceeded iudicially before him. Thamar accused not her brother vpon Absaloms aduise, and therefore Dauid, the fact beeing not prooued iudicially before him, could doe nothing. Borrh. In this case Dauid should haue sifted out the matter himselfe: otherwise Heli might haue bin by the same reason excused for his lenitie toward his sonnes. 5. Pellican addeth further, that Dauid beeing guiltie of the like sinne himselfe, vsed conniuence toward his sonne. 6. But Dauid can not be herein excused: he was too remisse and indulgent toward his children. As he was vnwilling that Absalon should be slaine after he was entered into that vnnaturall and rebellious action: neither did he punish Adoniahs aspiring mind, that while his father yet liued, would haue taken vpon him to be King. And herein most of all Gods worke is to be considered, quod Dauid corrigere noluit Deus punivit, God punished that, which Dauid would not correct. God so in his secret wisedome disposed, that Dauid should let Amnon goe vnpunished, that the other iudgement of the sword threatned against Dauids house might take place. Mart. 11. Quest. v. 28. Vpon those words of Absalon, smite Amnon, kill him. Why the Lord suffered a sword to be drawne out against Dauids familie, hauing forgiuen his sinne. True it is, that the Lord had said to Dauid by his Prophet Nathan, that the Lord had put away his sinne, hee should not die: yet some chastisement remained still, quae non poenae vim, sed medicinae obtinet, which was not as a punishment, but as a medicine. And for these causes doth the Lord lay afflictions vpon his children, euen after the re∣mission of their sinne. 1. Vt sit, quod nos admoneat nostrae miseriae, &c. that we may haue somewhat alwaies to admonish vs of our miserie. 2. Vt sit materia inuoandi Deum, that we may still haue occasion to call vpon God, and flie vnto him in our afflictions, and necessities. 3. That the members of Christ may be conformable vnto the head: For if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him: Rom. 8.17. So the Apostle saith, I fulfill the rest of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his bodies sake, which is the Church: Coloss. 1.24. Not that any thing is wanting to the personall sufferings of Christ: but because Christ suffereth together in his members, they are called the afflictions of Christ. 4. But here we must take heed of the errour of the Romanists, who thinke that the ser∣uants of God doe satisfie for their sinnes by their afflictions: Borrh. But seeing no affliction happeneth vnto Gods children, which is not deseruedly imposed vpon them for their sinne, thereby they cannot satisfie: but they must leaue that worke for him, who was without sinne, and therfore vndeseruedly suffred in himselfe whatsoeuer was laid vpon him, for our sinnes.
12. Quest. v. 29. Whence Dauids sonnes had their mules which came of the mixture of diuerse kinds. Whereas they are forbidden Leuit. 19.19. to suffer the cattell of diuerse kinds to engender together; and the mules come of coupling of the horse and asse, so that this should seeme to be against the law. 1. Some answer, that in some countries the mules doe engender themselues:De natur. anim. lib. 8. cap. 24. lib. 6. cap. 26. as Aristotle writeth, which he affirmeth to be very swift, whereas ours are slow. But if there be any such mules, they are of another kind: for those which are now in vse, beeing of a mixed kind cannot engender: they were first found out by Anah in the wildernesse,Gen. 36.24. when he kept his father Sibeons asses. 2. It is like therefore that these mules were engendered in some other countrie, and brought thence into Palestina: although they were forbidden to put together diuerse kinds, yet they might vse the things so engendred: Mart. 3. Borrhaius findeth fault with the vulgar Latine for reading here mulas, she mules, for mulos, hee mules: which do differ much, the hee, which commeth of the hee asse and the mare, are very swift, the shee mules of the horse and shee asse, are verie slow and dull. But though there be an er∣rour in the translation; for in the originall the word is peredeh, an he mule, not pirdah, a shee mule: yet it seemeth there is no such difference in the vse: for 1. King. 1.33. the Kings owne beast was pirdah, a shee mule; it is like he would vse the best kind of them. 13. Quest. v. 31. Of Dauids mourning, when he heard of the death of his sonnes. 1. Dauid here was paied home in the same kind: for as hee tooke delight when newes was brought him of Vriahs death; so now he is frighted with heauie newes, and the report is worse then the thing, that all the Kings sonnes were dead. Borrh. Martyr. 2. And as his seruants also, when they heard of Vriahs death their faith∣full fellow seruant, sorrowed not, so now also vpon this report, they stand likewise with their clothes rent. Pellican. 3. Dauid had great cause of greife, for he was a ten∣der man ouer his children: and where he hoped to find comfort, they are an occasion to him of greife. 4. Many who doe prosper in their affaires abroad, haue cause of greife at home, as Dauid here hath. Augustus Caesar was a happie Emperour, yet he had domesticall crosses by his children, in so much that hee desired, that he had died without children. 5. Likewise the verie manner, how it was reported, his children were killed, might much trouble him, that they were slaine by treacherie, which brought to his remembrance his owne sinne, how he had caused faithfull Vriah to be betraied in battell. 6. Yet notwithstanding these crosses, Dauid was in the fauour of God; which sheweth that Gods fauour, or disfauour is not to be measured by prospe∣ritie or aduersitie in this life: Mart. 7. And by this example we see, that children, whom their parents spare to correct, will in the end be a griefe vnto them. 14. Quest. v. 32. Of Ionadabs speach to Dauid. 1. This wicked man, whose counsell to Amnon brought Dauid and his sonnes in∣to this daunger, now taketh vpon him to comfort Dauid: Pellican. But he is a mise∣rable comforter, in saying that Amnon onely was dead: for it was griefe enough to the King, to haue his eldest sonne slaine in that manner; and Ionadab sheweth him∣selfe no changeling: for he bewraieth his carnall securitie, that was not touched with the remembrance of his sinne, beeing himselfe the author of this mischiefe: Osiand. It is also maruell, that he gessing so right at the matter, and giuing a reason, why Am∣non onely was slaine, as if he were acquainted with his counsell, that the king was so forgetfull, as not to examine and sift him further. 2. Now Ionadab knew this by coniecture, for he was priuie vnto this whole mat∣ter from the beginning: some thinke that Absalon had this thing in his mouth, as the Hebrew words are, and that he might tell Ionadab so much. Mar. But it is more like that Absalon kept his purpose secret, as Iosephus saith, grave odium eius in pectore cela∣bat, he concealed in his breast great hatred toward him: therefore it is no good rea∣ding, Absalon had so reported. Genev. nor, hee had determined so in his heart. B. C. or, hee was set in Absalons hatred: L. or, in Absalons rage. S. for the words are, ehi ghal pi, because it was in his mouth: which Vatablus thus expoundeth, at the commandement
of Absalom it was so appointed, from the day when Amnon forced Thamar. But Absalom had not giuen that charge and commandement to his seruants so long before, but vp∣on the present. Therefore Iunius reading is better; at the appointment of Absalôm, that was done, which he purposed from the day, &c. so that the word shimah, purpose, hath rela∣tion to the words following, from the day, &c. for so long before he had purposed it, though not appointed it. And that phrase, according to the mouth, is taken in thi sense, for appointment in other places; as Numb. 3.16. 15. Quest. v. 36. Of these words, The King wept exceeding sore: how that the children of God are not without their passions. But here this question may be mooued: how it commeth to passe, that many among the heathen in the like calamitie, when they heard of the death of their children, were not mooued, and yet Dauid here sheweth himselfe full of passion: as Horatius Pulvil∣lus, as he was dedicating a temple, heard of the death of his sonne, yet proceeded in the dedication: Anaxagoras hearing the like of his sonne, made onely this answer, scio me genuisse mortalem, I knew I begot a sonne to die: Paulus Aemilius when his sonnes were slaine, and the publike businesse went well forward, gaue thankes to the gods that he had his prayer, that the calamitie imminent might fall vpon his familie, so that the commonwealth were deliuered. The reasons of this difference may be these. 1. The heathen did thinke that these calamities fell out by necessitie of nature, or by chance, and they looked not vnto Gods prouidence, neither beleeued any thing of the state of the soule after this life: and therefore as naturall men, only considering the time present, and not well waigh∣ing the cause of all these calamities, which is our sinns, they seemed not to be mooued. But it is otherwise with the seruants of God: they knowe that all things fall out by Gods prouidence, and that calamities are sent by him as punishments of sinne, and this is the cause of their mourning. And to this purpose may be applyed that saying of Aristippus, who beeing in danger of shipwracke in the sea, and much afraid, wher∣as an other rude man, yet hardie, feared nothing, and being asked why he was so fear∣full beeing a Philosopher, made answer; non debuisti sollicitus esse tu de anima nebulonis, ego videbam Aristippum philosophum periclitari, thou hadst no reason to take care for the soule of a knaue, but I knew that Aristippus the philosopher was in danger, &c. So the heathen had no such cause to be mooued: for they knew not what should become of their soules, neither were they of such price with God, as the soules of his seruants, whom he reserueth for a better life. 2. An other reason of this vacuitie of passion among the Heathen, was that recei∣ued opinion of the Stoicks, who held that there should be in a wise man, , an absence of all passion. The Peripatetikes held, that passions and affections were to be moderated: the other, would haue them to bee quite rooted out: But this were to blame the God of nature, who created man with passions and affections, and what∣soeuer God made, was good: and the affections of anger, zeale, desire, sorrow, with the rest, are many times the instruments of vertue beeing well vsed. Indeede the holy Martyrs of Christ in the midds of their torments, seemed to be without sense of griefe, not as though they were without any feelling or passion: but the exceeding great ioy which they had in the contemplation of a better life, did swallow vp all their other af∣fections: and this strength in them was extraordinarie and supernaturall: but the que∣stion is here, of the ordinarie state and condition of the faithfull. This then is the do∣ctrine of Christian religion, be angrie, but sinne not, Eph. 4.26. that men should vse their affections, but yet moderate them and keepe them within their bounds. 3. And concerning the patience of the Gentiles, with other their vertues of iustice, fortitude, temperance; they were but speciosa peccata, goodly sinnes, because they were without faith: and without faith it is not possible to please God, Heb. 11.6. So that we doubt not, but that Dauid with his passionate teares, which proceeded of faith, was more accepted of God, then the vnpassionate heathen, which had no faith. Mart.
16. Quest. Of the passions and affections, that were in our blessed Sauiour. 1. Our blessed Sauiour as he was perfect God, and so without passion: so was he perfect man, and so tooke vpon him true humane affections, as of ioy, sorrow, anger: for that all these were in him, the Gospel doth abundantly testifie: otherwise he had not beene a perfect man: as Augustine saith, neque cum verum corpus hominis & animam habuit, habuit falsum affectum humanum, neither when he had the true bodie and soule of a man, had he false affections. 2. Therefore those sayings of Hilarie are warily to be read, and considered; Chri∣stum ad patiendum,Lib. 10. de Tri∣nit. non ad dolendum corpus habuisse, that Christ had a bodie to suffer, not to grieue: and the crosse of Christ the speares and nailes he saith, impetum passionis fe∣cisse in Christo, at non dolorem, did force passion in Christ, but no sense or griefe; as when a man smiteth the water, there is a passion and suffering in it, but no sense or feeling, &c. These assertions are dangerous, and against the Scripture: the bodie of Christ is not to be imagined to haue such stupiditie, as things without life and sense: He had a perfect humane soule, and therefore affection also and sense. 3. But there is great difference between the affections which Christ had, and ours. 1. in respect of the obiect: our affections doe turne into sinne, but Christs were neuer occupied in any sinfull or imperfect act. 2. All Christs affections were in him volun∣tarie, they did rise in him when he pleased to shew them, and they appeared not, when he pleased to suppresse them; but in vs, they are often involuntarie, and they rise whether we will or no. 3. Our affections are so precipitate, that may times they ouer∣rule reason: but so were not our blessed Sauiours. ex Mart. 17. Quest. Why holy men and womn vnder the olde Testament shewed more passion then now. In the newe Testament also the seruants of God did shew their passions and affe∣ctions, as the woman that washed Christs feete with her teares, and Peter wept bit∣terly: but these examples indeede are not so many in the new Testament, nor in such manner: 1. One reason hereof may be the alteration of times, that may seeme com∣mendable in one age, which is not so allowed of in an other: then their lamentations were solemne and publike, and with many ceremonies, and much preparation, which vsages doe not beseeme these times. 2. But it may better be answered: that they did more attend the terrene promises of the land of Canaan, and the good successe and encrease of their posteritie, though they had also a sight of the true spirituall rest, but not so cleare as we haue: therefore they sorrowed more for the losse of externall things. But now because wee by faith are nourished into a more lively hope of the things to come, we ought lesse to be mooued with temporall losses and crosses. Mart. 18. Quest. v. 39. Of Dauids desire to Absalom. 1. Some read, Dauid ceased to goe forth after Absolom, Vat. Lat. Pellic. Montan. as though Dauid had sought him or pursued him by strong hand: Osiand. for both Ab∣salom was gone out of the land, beeing fledde to Talmai, king of Geshur his wiues father: and Dauids affection was not so bent against him, who afterward when he had rebelled against him, lamented for his death. It is therefore better read, he desired to goe forth vnto him, that is, to see him. Pag. Iun. B. G. 2. The reason is adioyned, he was comforted concerning Amnon, 1. both for that he was dead, and could not be restored to life againe: Iun. 2. and he considered that Amnon died iustly for his sinne: Borrh. 3. time also had mitigated and allayed his griefe: Pelli. 4. And he therein considered Gods prouidence, by the which all things are disposed, and nothing falleth out by chance. Mart.
CHAP. 14. 1. Quest. What mooued Ioab to take this course in this chapter prescribed to bring againe Absalom. 1. IOab sawe Dauids affection well enclined toward Absalom: not turned against Absalom, as Osiand. for the last verse of the former chapter sheweth that Dauid was comforted for the death of Amnon, and longed for his sonne Absalom: Dauid was well affected toward his sonne, yet would not yet send for him to returne, be∣cause by the lawe of God, he that killed an other wifully was to die: Ioab beeing a cunning courtier, and obseruing Dauids minde, beganne to worke with him in this cunning manner, in suborning a subtill woman to speake vnto the King. Mart. 2. P. Martyr thinketh that Ioab did this to gratifie Dauid, because he sawe that it would please him, to haue his sonne returne againe; and his reason is, because after Absalom was returned, Ioab came not at him for two yeares, neither would come be∣ing sent for, till Absalom had caused his field of barley to be set on fire. But it is eui∣dent that Ioab did it to pleasure Absalom, as appeareth, ver. 22. where Ioab giueth great thankes vnto the King for graunting his request. And afterward Ioabs minde might somewhat change toward Absolom, as he sawe the kings minde to alter; and because the king would not haue him see his face, neither would Ioab visit him: and courtiers beside are forgetfull of their friends, and variable. At this time it is like Io∣ab thinking Absalom like to succeede in the kingdome, would by this meanes insinu∣ate himselfe into his fauour. 2. Quest. Why Ioab dealeth couertly by parable with the King, not directly. Whereas there are two kind of examples; some are true, some are fained: the fained are of two sorts, either parables or fables: and parables sometime are vsed for illustra∣tion onely, sometime for proofe and demonstration; this parable is of this latter sort: Borrh. which Ioab here putteth into the womans mouth for these causes. 1. Parables doe mooue much, and leaue a vehement impression behind them. 2. They were very vsuall in those dayes. 3. But the cheifest reason of all was, opus erat obliqua petitione in causa mala: in an euill cause it was necessarie to vse an oblique and indirect petiti∣on: Osiand. for it would haue seemed an harsh and vnsauourie petition, at the first to request a parricide of his brother to be restored. Antonius Caracalla after he had kil∣led his brother Geta, would haue had Papinian the lawyer to defend the fact, who made this franke answer, paricidia facilius committentur, quàm defenduntur, that parri∣cides are more easily committed then defended: but for this his free speach hee was slaine. Mart. 4. This diligence of Ioab in bolstring out a badde cause, should teach vs not to be slacke in following of a good cause. Mart. 3. Qest. Of the woman of Tekoah, whom Ioab vsed. 1. This Tekoah some thinke to haue beene a citie in the tribe of Asher: Bor. Mar. Pellic. but it is found to haue beene in the tribe of Iudah, 2. Chron. 11.6. Iun. Genev. 2. The Rabbines thinke that this towne brought forth many wittie and eloquent men and women, out of which place came the Prophet Amos: and therefore Ioab made choice to take a woman from this place. 3. Pellican thinketh, that this woman indeed, did truely put this case of her two sonnes, which killed one the other: but it is otherwise expressed in the text, v. 3. that Ioab taught her what she should say. 4. Ioab therefore maketh choice of this woman, whom he knew to be of a subtile wit, and readie speech, to put forth this parable to the King, and to take vpon her the person and habite of a mourner: which part was fittest to be played by a woman full of passion, and so able to mooue compassion.
4. Quest. Of the womans speach in generall. 1. The womans parabolicall narration consisteth of two parts, of the proposition of the parable, to v. 12. then the reddition, and accomodation of it to Absalom, v. 12. to v. 21. Borrh. 2. The reasons, which the woman vseth to perswade compassion, are specialy three; taken, ab honesto, vtili, facili, it was an honest thing which she desired, profitable, and easie to be done: first, it was honest, both by the lawe of nature, which teacheth a man to defend himselfe, and to repell wrong by force and might, as this her sonne did defend himselfe from his brothers wrong: it was honest by the written lawe, which appointed cities of refuge, for such inuoluntatie offenders. It was also a thing profi∣table to her house, that her sonne should liue, otherwise her sparke should be put out, if both her sonnes should be taken way. And it was an easie matter for the King to determine, who was as an Angel of God, that is, of great dexteritie in hearing good and bad. 3. The woman alleadgeth many vnlike things in her parable, which were not true in the case betweene Amnon and Absalom. 1. One of these supposed sonnes did not intend an others death, but they fell out vpon the sudden; but Absalom had purposed Amnons death long before. 2. one of these inuaded an other, but Amnon did not as∣sault Absalom. 3. there no witnesses were present, here all the Kings sonnes were assembled together. 4. the cities of refuge were not appointed for wilfull murderers, such as Absalom was. 5. she pretended that if her other sonne died, all hope of poste∣ritie should be cut off: but though Absalom should neuer returne, the King had more sonnes. Mart. Thus she of purpose inserteth into this her oration some vnlike things, least the King should at the first perceiue her purpose. Osiand. 5. Quest. v. 9. What the woman meaneth, when she saith, This trespasse be vpon me, and my fathers house. 1. Some thinke that she cunningly turneth the speach and curse vpon her selfe, which she meaneth toward the King: that if he did not helpe in this case, and deliuer her sonne from them that pursued him, that God would require it at his hand: Borrh. Mart. But it is not like, that she would either apertly or couertly vse any such com∣mination, all her speach beeing petitionarie. 2. Therefore this rather is her meaning, that if it were so, that the king should offend in redeeming her sonne, that had killed his brother, she would before the Lord, take all the fault vpon her selfe, and her fa∣milie: the King and his throne should be innocent: Iun. Osiand. 6. Quest. v. 11. Why the woman saith to the King, Remember the Lord thy God. 1. The Chalde paraphrast seemeth to giue this sense, that he would remember what is written in the law of God concerning the pursuit of blood, that they should not pursue deadly the innocent. 2. Osiander giueth this sense, remember the Lord thy God, to imitaate him in shewing of mercie. 3. But it appeareth by Dauids immediate answer which he bindeth with an oth, that the woman for her better assurāce did co∣uertly desire it of the king: Iun. Vat. Mar. 4. And whereas the king seemed but to speake of one reuenger of blood, ver. 10. bring him to me that speaketh against thee: she desireth a more generall graunt of the king, that he would not suffer the reuengers of blood to be multiplied: that not onely one, but all it might be inhibited by the King. Pel. 5. The King by this oath was not tied to graunt her request following for Absalom, for his was a diuerse case from this here propounded by the woman, and confirmed by Dauids oath. 6. Neither did the King abase himselfe in swearing to the woman to confirme his promise, it beeing so waightie a matter: seeing that God did so much condicend to Abraham, to confirme the promises made vnto him, by swearing by himselfe. Mart. 7. Quest. v. 13. Of the arguments whereby the woman seeketh to perswade Dauid. 1. She returneth the Kings words vpon himselfe, that seeing hee had giuen sen∣tence that her sonne should be spared, he should be found faultie himselfe, if he shew∣ed not the like mercie to Absalom. Iun.
2. Her second reason is, v. 14. taken from our mortall state, and the necessitie of death; seeing such is our condition, as that wee must all needes die, and there is no turning againe in this world; like as water which is spilt cannot be gathered vp againe: she hereby mooueth compassion, that Dauid would not take away Absaloms life before the time. Mart. 3. An other reason in the same verse is taken from Gods prouidence, neither hath God taken away his life, &c. that is, God hath preserued Absalom aliue, and hath ap∣pointed meanes, that is, put into the peoples head to make request for him, that is bani∣shed: Iun. and here also shee hath relation to the cities of refuge, which God had ap∣pointed for the rescue of involuntarie man-slayers; Mart. and secretly shee insinua∣teth, how the Lord had spared Dauid, and did not take away his life after he had sin∣ned. Osiand. 4. She further vrgeth the common perill and danger of the people; saying, v. 15. the people haue made me afraid: their state and condition is to be feared, if Absalom the hope of the kingdome returne not: Vatablus thus interpreteth, the people terrified me, and told me, that if I should directly make request for thy sonne, thou wouldest be angrie, and this is the cause of my couert speech. P. Mar. thus; the people thought I should make request in vaine, yet I was bold to speake. Osiander, the people vrged me, after I had entreated for mine owne sonne, to make mention of Absalom also, and that if I did it not, I should greatly offend. But the first sense is most fit, for so the application of the parable to Absalom shall be correspondent to that, which shee alleadged for her sonne, that if he died, her sparke should bee put out, and so Absa∣lom was the hope of the people. 5. Further, vers. 16. shee sheweth the inconuenience that would followe, pro∣pounding it in her person, and her sonnes: that as they should be cut off from their inheritance, for her sonne beeing slaine, she should not liue long after: so Absalom beeing in exile, should be destroyed from the inheritance of God, and so fall away to idolatrie: Mart. this argument Dauid in the same tearmes had vrged against Saul, 1. Sam. 26.19. They haue cast me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, say∣ing, goe serue others gods. 6. Then she propoundeth the common profit, the word of my Lord the King shall now be for rest: that is, ad publicam tranquilitatem, it shall be for the common tranquilitie and peace. 7. She proceedeth and inserteth the commendation of the King, comparing him to an Angel, both in vprightnesse of iudgement, and in dexteritie of iudging: Bor. not doubting, but hat as an Angel, so graciously without passion he would heare her re∣quest: Osiand. and be constant as an Angel in keeping his princely promise: Pellican. and that as he had giuen sentence on her side in her priuate cause, so that setting aside all humane affection, he would in simili causa idem iudicium ferre, giue the same iudg∣ment in the like cause concerning his sonne Absalom. Iun. 8. She concludeth with the cheifest benediction of all, the Lord thy God shall be with thee: when thou hast performed my request, the Lord shal prosper thee in thy gouern∣ment: and thy kingdome shall flourish, and God shall be with thee in all thy enter∣prises. Iun. Mart. 8. Quest. v. 19. Whether the woman be to bee blamed for reuealing Ioabs counsell. 1. Pellican noteth hereupon how dangerous a thing it is to commit any matter of secrecie vnto women, that cannot hold: because this woman concealed not Ioabs counsell. 2. But the woman beeing asked and straightly charged by the king, could not doe otherwise: she knewe that the king was wise, euen as an Angel of God, to finde it out if shee had denied it: and so shee should haue beene to her great shame found to be a lyar. Vatabl. 3. And it may seeme not improbable, that she and Ioab had agreed, that shee should in the ende discouer the matter: for Ioab was present, as may be gathered v. 21. readie to second the womans petition, as he should see cause. Mart. 4. And in that shee maketh Ioab the author of this course, that shee should change her speech, and speake parable-wise, their opinion is confuted, which thinke
the woman spake as the thing was concerning her two sonnes: for here shee confes∣seth, that she was taught by Ioab to change her forme of speach. Mart. 9. Quest. Whether Dauid did well in sparing Absalom. 1. Dauids conniuence herein, in not causing Absalom to be put to death, for kil∣ling his brother Amnon, neither is absolutely to be condemned, as transgressing the lawe, which requireth capitall punishment to bee laid vpon those which committed wilfull murder: to the which opinion P. Martyr enclineth; adding further, non de suo sed de Dei iure largitur qui homicidae parcit: he which spareth a man-slayer, doth not giue any thing of his owne right, but of Gods, &c. for Dauid did what hee could, he caused him to liue in banishment three yeares, cap. 13.38. then he was hardly en∣treated to giue him leaue to returne: and at his returne he would not suffer him to see his face for two yeares more, v. 28. Dauid could not put him to death, because he was beloued of the people. 2. Nor yet can this fact of Dauid be iustified, that he did well in sparing of Absa∣lom, and not punishing of him: the example of Cain, who killed his brother Abel, and yet was spared by his father Adam, is nothing like: for God gaue speciall dispen∣sation at that time to Caine to prolong his dayes, but to his greater confusion: and beside, Cain was preserued for the necessitie of procreation in those dayes: there is not the like reason, why Absalom should be spared here. 3. Therefore the meane way is best, neither to condemne or iustifie this fact of Dauid, as seeming to impugne the lawe of Moses, nor yet to justifie it: excused it may be by diuerse circumstances: 1. there were no accusers or reuengers, which fol∣lowed this crime against Absalom. 2. he was the kings sonne and desired of the peo∣ple. 3. he considered that it was Gods iustice vpon Amnon. 4. And beside, here was Gods secret worke in so disposing, that Absalom should bee reserued for a greater punishment. Borrh. 10. Quest. Why Dauid would not admit Absalom to his presence. 1. Dauid would not at the first suffer Absalom to see his face, least he might haue bin thought scelus homicidij leuiter aestimare, to make but small account of man-slaugh∣ter: Osiand. 2. And by seeing Absalom, the memorie of Amnons death might bee reviued. 3. It is like also that it would haue beene an offence vnto Amnons friends, and they might hereby haue beene prouoked to seeke reuenge: Mart. 4. And Da∣uid did it to this ende, vt melius filios in officio contineret, that he might by this example of seueritie the better containe his children, and bring them to doe their dutie: Osi∣and. 5. And Dauid thought it good not to restore Absalom all at once, he knew him to be of an insolent nature: hee would haue him therefore by little and little to con∣ceiue more hope of pardon. Pellic. 11. Quest. v. 25. Of Absaloms beawtie. 1. Mention is made here of Absaloms beautie to shewe his pride, that grewe in∣solent and ambitious in respect of his beautie and fauour, that he not long after aspi∣red to the crowne. 2. Beautie is no vertue, and yet it is in it selfe a commendable gift of nature, especially if it be accompanied with these two things, humanitie and cha∣stitie: as Ioseph beeing a beautifull person excelled in both these, he was courteous toward his brethren, and chast to his mistris: But both of them were wanting in Absolom, he was both cruell, and of a murderous mind, and verie vnchast, that hee did not forbeare his fathers concubines. 3. Beautie and comelinesse is not alwaies ioy∣ned with vertue: Saul was a comely tall person, yet prooued a tyrant: Alcibiades a∣mong the Athenians was a comely man, but caused many tragedies: Isocrates was wont to say of such, that had beautie but no vertue: that they had navim bonam, sed gubernatorem malum, a good ship, but an euill gouernour: Chrysostome compareth thē to faire trees in the wood,In Psalm. 50. that bring no fruit but for swine. And they may be likened to peacockes, which haue gaie feathers, but are not so profitable, as the poore hourely bee, that yeeldeth honie. Mart.
12. Quest. Of Absalom haire. v. 16. 1. Some thinke that Absalom was a Nazarite, and therefore polled not his haire: but the Nazarites did not cut their haire once euery yeare as Absalom did, but when their vow was at an end. It is like as D. Kimhi thinketh, that he had a pride in his haire, and did glorie in it. 2. In some countries the vse was not to poll their haire, as a∣mong the Lacedemonians: and they did it for this reason, if they were comely the haire would adde grace vnto them, if they were deformed it would make them terri∣ble to their enemies. But among the Romans they as much abhorred those, which did weare long haire. There was a certaine tree, whereon the young men and virgins did hang their first haire, which they consecrated vnto the gods: Absalom in nouri∣shing his haire followed therein no custome, but did it onely of pride. 2. His haire waighed 200. sicles, which as Iosephus counteth, was fiue pound: but some Hebrews better value the pound at 25. sacred sicles, that is, so many halfe ownces: this was esteemed after the kings, that is, the ciuill and common sicle, Iunius. which is held to be but two drammes, that is a quarter of an ownce. Iosephus is here in an errour, who thinketh hee polled his head, at euery 8. monthes end, whereas the text saith, it was at the end of euery yeare: and it being too heauie for him, weigh∣ing 200. common sicles, that is, an 100. halfe ownces, and 50. whole ownces, which maketh about 4 l. weight, counting 12. ownces and an halfe to the pound; he then cut it off. But if the sicle contained halfe an ownce, as Montanus thinketh, then the waight of his haire was as much more. Some thinke, that it was sold for 200. sicles, not that it waighed so much: Emm. Sa. But the valuation of it, at such a reckoning would seeme more strange, then the weight thereof at such a summe. In Saul and Ab∣salom two men of goodly stature, but of badde conditions, we haue the right descrip∣tion of hypocrites, who beare a faire shew outwardly, but within are corrupt. Borrh. CHAP. 15. 1. Quest. v. 1. What mooued Abshalom to aspire vnto the kingdome, and when. 1. IOsephus thinketh, that he beganne to attempt this after foure yeares: whereof though there be no mention in the text, yet it may well be, that after he had bin kept from his fathers presence two yeares, and had beene receiued into his fauour and sight, and so continued one yeare, then he beganne thus to practise in the fourth. 2. And seeing Amnon the Eldest was now slaine, and Chileab the second sonn was dead, he tooke himselfe to be the next heire, and therefore beginneth betimes, to preuent the conueying of the kingdome ouer to Salomon, which now might beginne to be surmised and talked of. Mar. 3. He might also carrie an hatefull mind toward his father, and so purposed vngra∣ciously with himselfe to be reuenged of him. His mother also beeing a straunger, and his kindred were not so much (it may be) respected, and therefore he also sought their aduancement. 4. And herein God had a secret worke, that Nathans prophecie might take place, that the sword should neuer depart from Dauids house. Further, herein Dauid was a type and figure of the Messiah, against whom one of his Apostles lift vp his heele. Borrh. 2. Quest. Of Abshaloms practises whereby he seeketh to aspire to the kingdome. 1. Hee taketh vpon him great state and pompe: hee prouideth him a chariot, and horses, which was a thing vnusuall, and 50. men. And by this glittering shew, he be∣ginneth to be aduanced of the people, who are much affected with nouelties, and vn∣wonted vsages, Mart. It was maruell, that his father perceiued not, to what this tended, but hee was blinded with fatherly loue, and affection toward him. Osiand.
2. The next thing whereby he insinuateth himselfe, is his diligence and paines: he would rise vp earely euery morning, and goe and stand in the gate: ambitious men will spare no trauaile or paines to atcheiue their purpose: which may teach vs to be diligent in following of good causes, if the ambitious are so diligent and studious in prosecuting of euill. 3. Then followeth his flatterie, he would commend euery ones cause that it was verie good: and would giue them faire promises, wishing that hee were set to be a Iudge ouer them, he would then minister iustice vnto euery one. 4. He slaundereth also his Fathers gouernment, and accuseth his officers of negli∣gence and iniustice: as the propertie of ambitious men is, to dispraise all but them∣selues. 5. Vnto these insinuations he addeth a fawning kind of humanitie and courtesie, abasing himselfe to kisse euery one that came by. 6. And by these meanes, it is said he stole away the hearts of the people, both in respect of Dauid, to whom they were bound by couenant; from him hee stealeth their hearts: Mart. and in respect of the people also, who knew not Absaloms pur∣pose herein; it was also secret, and as theft vnto them. 3. Quest. v. 7. After fourtie yeares: from what time these yeares must be counted. 1. Osiander thinketh, those yeares to take beginning from Dauids first annoynting by Samuel: but that beeing done priuately, could not well be a rule of the publike ac∣count. 2. Vatablus (so also Genevens.) reckoneth those yeares from the time, when the Is∣raelites asked a King, which was three yeares, as he thinketh, before Dauid beganne his raigne; and he taketh this to be the 37. yeare of Dauids raigne. But it was more then 40. yeares from thence, for Samuel and Saul gouerned Israel 40. yeeres, Act. 13.21. Neither was there any cause why the yeares of Dauids raigne should be counted from thence, seeing hee was no way accessarie to the sinne of the people in that pe∣tition. 3. An other account is to beginne these yeares from the slaughter of the preists by Saul in Nob: but the Scripture vseth not to put the yeares of two kings raignes toge∣ther. 4. Iosephus for fourtie yeares readeth fowre, but that is contrarie to the text. 5. And to count these 48. yeares as runne of the Iubile, is without ground, because we find not that account to be vsed in Scripture. 6. The best reckoning then of these yeares, is to count them from the beginning of Dauids raigne: But not as Pellican thinketh, that this might be done two or three yeares before the end of Dauids raigne, for so few yeares (he thinkeeth) breake no great square in such a summe: this account is better taken precisely and exactly, that this fell out in the last yeare of Dauids raigne: for all the rest of the storie which fol∣loweth to chap. 21. seemeth to haue beene done in a veire short time: thus therefore the yeares may be diuided; two yeares Absalom was at Ierusalem before he sawe his fathers face, and three yeares before that in exile: two yeares (before that) were past from the deflouring of Thamar to the slaughter of Amnon: these make 7. in all, and it is thought that 3. or 4. yeares before, that Dauid committed the sinne with Bathsheba in the 59. yeare of his age, and about the 29. yeare of Dauids raigne: for Dauid raigned 40. yeares, and was 70. yeares old when he died: so that the 59. yeare of his age will concurre with the 29. yeare of his raigne. And it is held of the Hebrewes, that Salomon was but a 11. yeares of age, when hee beganne his raigne. Mart. 4. Quest. Why Abshalom maketh choice of Hebrn to beginne his conspiracie in. 1. Iunius thinketh that Abshalom did not sacrifice at Hebron, but onely made a vow solemnely among his kinred there, to testifie his thankefulnesse vnto God, for restoring him to his countrie, and his fathers fauour: but it is euident in that he saith, I will serue the Lord, v. 8. that it was a religious act, beside a solemne feast: for before
the Temple was built, they sacrificed in other places, then where the Tabernacle was: Mart. Osiand. especially their peace-offerings: Genevens. See more hereof before.1. Sam. qu. 17. in c. 7. qu. 4. in c. 9. & qu. 2. c. 16. 2. Hee maketh choice of Hebron beeing a famous place, because of the sepulchre of the Patriarkes there, and there Dauid beganne his raigne, and Absaloms kinred there dwelt of the tribe of Iudah. Mart. 3. Thus Abshalom maketh religion a clooke of his rebellion: as the Pope and popelings, in their treacherous plottes pretend religion and conscience. Borrh. 5. Quest. v. 10. Of Abshaloms conspiracie, and the manner thereof. 1. First, there went with Abshalom 200. men: these were inuited to Abshaloms feast, but knew nothing of his conspiracie: the text saith, they went in their simplici∣tie. These were in no fault to goe with Absalom, for his father had giuen him leaue: and after they saw, what Abshalom intended, then they could not withdraw them∣selues, sine praesentissimo vitae periculo, without most present daunger of their life. O∣siander. 2. But before this Abshalom had sent messengers secretly into all the Tribes, to feele and solicite the mindes of the chiefest men, and to appoint to meete at He∣bron. 3. Then he sendeth for Achitophel, who it should seeme was of counsell with him in this action, but had withdrawen himselfe into his owne countrie, that there might be no suspition, and from thence came to Hebron, beeing acquainted with the whole proiect of the businesse before. 4. But it is most to bee wondred at, that the people did flocke so fast to Absalom: it is like that Achitophel or some other vsed some perswasion to the people, shewing the imperfections of Dauids life, and gouernment, and how beside the adulterie of Bathsheba, and murther of Vriah, he had suffered Amnon to goe vnpunished for his incest: and had dealt hardly with Abshalom for reuenging his sisters wrong. By such perswasions the people might be caried, being of themselues desirous of noueltie, and longing to see a change. Mart. 6. Quest. v. 17. Why the King fledde from Ierushalem. Dauid hauing armed men with him, and beeing in a strong citie, might haue re∣mained there still more safely, yet he did chuse rather to flie, for these reasons. 1. He would spare the effusion of blood; for he said, least hee smite the citie with the edge of the sword: he had rather hazard his owne person, then that many should be brought into danger: hee knew how cruelly ambitious men were set, that they would not spare, nor haue any compassion, till they had accomplished their desire. Hereof the Ciuill warres of Scilla and Marius, and betweene Augustus, Antonie, and Lepidus in the Romane state may make demonstration: Mart. Antisthenes was wont to preferre hangmen and executioners before Tyrants, for they did but put malefactors to death, the other did not spare the innocent. 2. An other reason of his departure was; hee beganne to consider that this was the hand of God vpon him, according as Nathan had foretold him, that the sword should not depart from his house, and therefore he submitteth himselfe meekly to the Lords mercie. 3. And by his departure, an other prediction of Nathan tooke effect; hee left his concubines behind, whom Abshalom defiled. 4. Dauid with all his people went on foote, as is gathered v. 17. R. Leviben Gerson thinketh the reason thereof was, that he might not be discerned, going as a common souldier: but rather Dauid did it to shew his afflicted estate: Mart. And Dauid ca∣rying himselfe thus humblie in this calamitie, continued not long therein, but was soone restored to his former estate. Pellican. 7. Quest. v. 19. Who Itthai the Gittite was. 1. Some thinke that this Itthai was the sonne of Achish king of Gath, who fauou∣red Dauid: and that these were of the citie Gath of the Philistims, who notwithstan∣ding were faithfull toward Dauid: Osiand. But it is not like, that Dauid would vse the
helpe of the vncircumcised Philistims. 2. Vatablus taketh them for Philistims con∣uerted to the faith of Israel: and that Ittai was a Proselyte also of that countrie, Pellic. but it seemeth by their late comming, as Dauid saith v. 20. Thou cammest but yesterday, that they were no Proselytes, they had not beene so long there to be conuerted. 3. Iosephus taketh these 600. that came with Itthai, to be those which fled from Saul to Dauid when he was in Ziglag: but it is not like, that they were now aliue: it was 40. yeares before this time. 4. Wherefore I thinke rather with Iunius, that these were no other then the garison souldiers, which kept Gath, which Dauid had taken not long before from the Philistims, c. 8.1. and Ittai was their captaine: who is called a stranger, because he was so in respect of his habitation: Hee was one of Dauids principall captaines to whom he committed the third part of his armie, c. 18.2. 5. Now Dauid would not haue Itthai goe with him, because he was lately come, and his men wearie: and though such helpe had beene necessarie for Dauid, yet he was not a man that altogether respected his owne commoditie: and he trusted in Gods defense, that he would deliuer him. Mart. 8. Quest. v. 25. Why Dauid would haue the Arke carried againe into the citie. 1. Some thinke Dauid sent backe the Arke, because the peculiar place appointed for it, was at Ierusalem from whence it should be no more remooued. Borrh. But that is not so: the peculiar place for the Arke was not yet assigned, but afterward in the threshing floore of Araunah where the Angel appeared to Dauid. And before this in Dauids time, the Arke was carried to battell against the Ammonites, and therefore Vriah said to Dauid, that the Arke remained in the field, because it was in the campe. c. 11.11. 2. Some thinke that Dauid was afraid to carrie the Arke with him, least some such casualtie might befall them, as before, when Vzzah was smitten. 3. Some are of opinion that the Preists consulted with God, and receiued no an∣swer, and therefore Dauid sendeth backe the Arke as vnprofitable: but that is not like. 4. Others iudge this to be the reason: the Preists went with the Arke, and Dauid remembring what the preists had suffered for his cause before at Nob, would not haue them brought into the like daunger now, and therefore sendeth them backe with the Arke. 5. But the reason is set downe in the text, why the Arke was returned to Ierusha∣lem, because Dauid thought good to send backe the Preists, who attended vpon it: that they might out of the citie giue Dauid intelligence, as occasion serued. v. 27. 6. Thus Dauid, though he knew that the Arke was a worthie Sacrament, and a visible testimonie of Gods presence, and well remembred, what great things the Lord had wrought by the Arke: how the waters of Iordan were diuided before it, the walls of Iericho fell downe: yet Dauid was contented at this time to forbeare the presence of the Arke: hauing his confidence in God, and not relying altogether vpon the externall Sacrament. Contrarie is the superstitious practise of the Pope, who when he iourneieth must haue the consecrated hoast carried vpon a white palfrey be∣fore him,Controv. The grace of God not tied to the signe. that if any should chaunce to be suddenly stricken with sickenesse, hee might presently be housled therewith: the like opinion they haue of the necessitie of baptisme, that infants are damned, that are not baptised: and thus they tie Gods grace to the outward signe and Sacrament: Dauid doth not so here, who thin∣keth to haue Gods presence, though hee had not with him the visible signe there∣of. 9. Quest. v. 27. Why Dauid calleth Zadock rather a Seer, then Abiathar. 1. The Iewes thinke that Zadock was here appointed in Abiathars place, and ther∣fore to him onely Dauid giueth the name of a Seer: and further, here they haue this fable, that Abiathar consulted with God first, because he was the chiefer in place, but the Lord answered him not: and that then Zadock enquired of God, and receiued answer, and vpon this occasion Zadock was preferred: but it is euident that Abiathar
was not remooued from the Priesthood vntill Salomons raigne, neither was it now a time for Dauid to bestow offices. 2. Pet. Martyr saith, videntem vocat, quia prior aderat, he calleth him a Seer, because he was there first: but the name Seer is taken for a Prophet: as Samuel was so called, 1. Sam. 9.9. 3. The reason hereof was this: Abiathar and Zadock had their times to serue in course, as was appointed by Samuel and Dauid, 1. Chron. 9.22. and this weeke Zadock serued, and therefore Dauid calleth him Seer. And thus much in effect he saith vnto him, that he was the publike Minister to giue attendance vpon the Arke for the seruice of the whole Church, and therefore it was not fit, that he should onely follow the King, priuata conditione fugientem, now flying away, as in a priuate state and con∣dition. Iun. And further, Dauid in effect saith thus much vnto him: Art not thou a Seer which doest vse to aske counsell of God by Vrim and Thummim? thou maiest stand me in more stead in returning, and abiding with the Arke to consult with God for me, then to be with me still here. Borrh. 10. Quest. v. 30. Of Dauids going barefoote, and his head couered. 1. Some thinke that Dauids couering his head, was a signe here of subiection, and the putting off his shooes of resigning the kingdome, which was a ceremonie vsed in Israel to signifie the deliuering ouer of the possession of a thing. Borrh. But Dauid knewe it was not Gods will, that he should surrender the kingdome to Abshalom, it was apppointed to Salomon. 2. Therefore these were onely signes of Dauids mour∣ning; for so they which mourned vsed to couer their heads, that their teares should not be seene of men, which were knowen vnto God. Mart. 3. And Dauid is here a liuely type of our Blessed Sauiour, who went vp the mount of Oliues heauie vnto death, as Dauid goeth vp weeping here. Osiander. 11. Quest. v. 34. Of Dauids counsell to Chusai, say vnto Absha∣lom, I will be thy seruant: whether Dauid did well in teaching him to dissemble. 1. Some are of opinion, that whereas there are three kind of lyes, iocosum, officio∣sum, perniciosum, a lie in iest, an officious, and a pernicious lie: the two first they hold to be lawfull: and that to make a charitable lie to doe good to some, and not to hurt others, is not vnlawfull. But this is no sound opinion: for euery lie with what pre∣tense so euer it is made, is an offence: because we doe not speake the truth from the heart: and S. Pauls rule must be obserued, we must not doe euill, that good may come of it. See more hereof, 1. Sam. c. 21. qu. 13. qu. 14. 2. Osiander thinketh that this dissembling of Chushai was an officious kind of lie, which was not against charitie, but it tended to preserue the life of the King, and the state, and therefore neither Dauid therein sinned in giuing this aduise, nor Chushai in following it. But if it be graunted that Chushai here made a lie, it must needes follow, that it was not without offence. 3. Pellican resolueth thus, that Chushai did here tell no lie: for hee had done in∣deed faithfull seruice to Abshalom, if he would haue beene ruled by him, and surcea∣sed to pursue his father: and his counsell was also in effect profitable to him: for it was better that Abshalom was slaine, then he should haue killed his father. But it is eui∣dent, that Chushai had no such intendment to profite Absalom by his counsell, but to ouerthrow all his deuises. 4. Wherefore either with Iunius it may be answered, that Chushai ambiguo sermone ludificatur, doth with ambiguous speach dally with Absalom, and so telleth not a lie: See c. 17.16.18. 5. Or else, as Pet. Martyr concludeth, Dauid might herein haue Gods direction, and then hee sinned not; for God is aboue his owne law: as Abraham in attempting to sacrifice his sonne, the Israelites in taking fom the Egyptians, sinned not, because they did it by Gods direction. So if it be graunted, that Chushai here lied and dissem∣bled, if he did it humano impulsu, by a mans meere deuise, he cannot altogether be ex∣cused. But if it were by Gods direction, they offended not: as it may be gathered by
this, both because presently after Dauids prayer, that God would turne Achitophels counsell into foolishnesse, Chushai is offred vnto him, as the man, by whom his praier should be effected: and Dauid speaketh as a Prophet confidently, that by this means Achitophels counsell should be brought to nought. It seemeth then that Dauid here∣in was not without some diuine instinct. But we need not run here to such extraordi∣narie instinct to seeke defense or excuse of this fact: the former solution may be main∣tained, that Chushai did not tell a lie; nor is guiltie of vntruth in his speach, but one∣ly vsed a doubtfull and ambiguous kind of speach: first hee saluted Absalom, say∣ing, God saue the King, which he might as well vnderstand of Dauid, as of Absalom. c. 16. v. 16. Againe he saith, whom the Lord and all Israel, and all this people shall choose, his will I be: who else was that, but Dauid? And further he addeth, as I serued before thy father, so will I be before thee: hee professeth in effect himselfe still Dauids seruant. His whole course of speach is ambiguous: he may be thought somewhat to dissem∣ble, which in it selfe simply is not vnlawfull; but hee is not conuinced of any vn∣truth. CHAP. 16. 1. Quest. v. 3. Of Ziba his vnfaithfulnesse to his master Miphibosheth. 1. SAint Paul giueth a rule vnto seruants, not to serue their masters with eye-ser∣uice: but Ziba herein first sheweth his vnfaithfull seruice: for in his masters ab∣sence he accuseth him, howsoeuer beeing present, he might seeme to please his masters eye. 2. His disobedience also appeared, that beeing bidden to saddle his masters asse to meete the king, c. 19.26. hee went and made him readie for himselfe. 3. Hee go∣eth about to robbe his master, and seeketh to spoile him of all hee had. 4. Hee is dis∣contented with his estate, lift vp in pride, and thinketh scorne any longer to serue Mi∣phibosheth, thinking this a fit time to get his libertie: Mar. 5. And to bring this a∣bout he plaieth the flatterer, both presenting the King with gifts, and seemeth in words to extenuate his gifts, as not worthie to be offered to the King. Osiand. 7. And, which made vp the full measure of his treacherie; whereas a good seruant should haue spoken in defence of his master, he most vnfaithfully, and treacherously accuseth him vnto Dauid, and would in all likelihood, haue beene contented to be his butcher, if so the King had pleased he should be slaine. Mart. 2. Quest. Of Dauids rashnesse in giuing vnto Ziba Miphibo∣sheths goods and lands. 1. Dauid is assaulted in this Chapter with two contrarie temptations, of flatterie by Ziba, of rayling by Shemei: hee ouercame the greater, and was ouercome of the lesse. So many times Gods children stand out in great temptations, and giue out in lesse; which sheweth their humane infirmitie, and what they are, being left vnto them∣selues. 2. But there is great difference betweene the slippes of the righteous, and the fall of the wicked: for these are caught in the snare of temptation, and cannot wind themselues out, but though the righteous stumbleth, yet hee recouereth himselfe a∣gine; as Dauid afterward made restitution vnto Miphibosheth of that, which he had hastely taken from him. 2. Dauid sheweth himselfe verie rash in precipitating his sentence against Miphi∣bosheth, his cause beeing vnheard. It was a likely tale, that hee told of Miphibo∣sheth, who was the onely heire left of Sauls house: but all things that are likely, are not true. 3. Beside Dauid here sheweth his vnmindfulnesse of Ionathans kindnesse in time past, and forgetteth the couenant which was made betweene them. 4. By this we see, how daungerous a thing it is for a Magistrate to receiue gifts, which blind euen the eyes of the wise. Osiand. 5. And this mutabilitie in Dauid, sheweth how vaine and vncertaine a thing it is, to
put any confidence in Princes. Mart. 3. Quest. v. 7. Of Sheme his cursing. Hee vttereth many vile slanders against Dauid: 1. He most falsly chargeth him with the blood of Sauls house, whereas Dauid was therein most innocent: for Abner and Ishbosheth were slaine against his will; and the warres that were betweene the house of Dauid, and the house of Saul, were procured by Abner, who prouoked Io∣ab to fight, 2. Sam. 2. 2. He maketh Dauid an vsurper, as though he had inuaded and thrust himselfe to raigne in Sauls stead; whereas Dauid not once dreaming of a king∣dome, was thereunto called by the Lord, and anointed by Samuel. 3. He iustifieth wicked Abshalom, saying, that God had deliuered Dauids kingdome into his hands, which was most vntrue; Absalom was a most vniust and ambitious man, and thought to depriue his father of his kingdome. 4. He saith that Dauid was punished for his wickednesse, which was true, but not for those things whereof Shemei before chal∣lenged Dauid. 4. Quest. v. 9. Of Abishai his inconsiderate zeale in Dauids cause. 1. Here we haue two men, one speaketh against Dauid, the other defendeth Da∣uid: both speake in the behalfe of their kinsmen: the one hath a bad cause, and yet handleth it cunningly, as Shemei: the other had a good cause, the defence of the king, but he handleth it not well: both of them are lead with a carnall minde to seek reuenge. 2. Abishai is here carried away with a preposterous zeale, as often the chil∣dren of God are: So Ionas waighted still to see the destruction of Niniueh: Iames and Iohn, Luk. 9. would haue had fire come downe vpon the Samaritans: This then pro∣ceeded not from any diuine or religious charitie, but from an humane affection. 3. He calleth Shemei dogge, in contempt: beeing compared with the king, he was no bet∣ter then a dogges head, that is, a vile person: as 1. Sam. 24.15. 5. Quest. v. 11. Why Dauid chargeth his seruants not to meddle with Shemei. 1. Dauid looketh vnto Gods prouidence, who had so disposed to trie Dauids pa∣tience by Shemei his rayling tongue. 2. He thus reasoneth by way of comparison: he had endured the troubles and trialls procured by his son, who sought his life: where∣as Shemei was a stranger vnto him, and did but raile vpon him in words: much more was it fit he should beare this reproach. 3. He sheweth the fruit that might come of it, it may be that God would do him good for his cursing: not that this affliction was the cause of his reward: but it is an order and course, which the Lord obserueth to raise them vp, whom he had humbled; so he dealt with Ioseph and Iob. 4. And hee speaketh doubtfully, because we haue no certaintie of these temporall things: but of his spirituall state, his euerlasting saluation Dauid made no doubt at all. 6. Quest. v. 10. Whether Dauid did well in bearing Shemei his reproach∣full words: and what a reproach is, and how to bee borne. 1. A reproach is offered either in word, as Shemei reuiled Dauid, or in deede, as Abshalom defiled his fathers concubines, not so much of lust, as to disgrace his fa∣ther. 2. Reproaches, some are meere slaunders, as those were, which Shemei obiected to Dauid: some are true, as when one obiecteth such crimes as are true, but after a re∣proachfull manner. 3. Some reproachfull words are vttered by way of disgrace, and they are sinne: some onely are by way of discipline to amend and correct, and make one ashamed of his sinne: as when Magistrates rebuke offenders, and ministers in their sermons sharpely reprooue sinne: as the Prophet Isay called the cheife of Israel, Prin∣ces of Sodome, c. 1.10. and S. Paul saith, O yee foolish Galatians: and such kind of reproaches are not sinne. 2. Reproachfull and reuiling words proceede either from anger and desire of re∣uenge, as here in Shemei; or from pride, as in Rabsake against Hezekiah; or from foolishnesse, as Nabal reuiled Dauid. 3. How we are to behaue our selues in bearing of reproaches, these considerati∣ons are necessarie: 1. that generally we must followe that rule of Christ; if one smite
vs on the one cheeke, wee should turne to him the other also, that is not alwayes to doe so in fact, for Christ beeing smitten vpon one cheeke did not turne the other: but our heart must alwaies be prepared for Christs sake to suffer all wrongs in word, and in deed. 2. Yet there is a time when a foole must be answered in his foolishnesse, and a re∣uiler must not bee suffered to goe away without a rebuke; as if either his reproach tend to the hinderance of our good name or our brothers, and they which heare it, are by our silence apt to beleeue the slander; and if a discreet reproofe may be a means to make him see his sinne. 3. And there is a time, when a foole is not to be answeared in his foolishnesse, least we be like him;Prov. 16.4. if we thinke that we shall growe too hotte and cholerike, and exceede measure in reproouing, it is better for vs to hold our peace: and when we see in respect of the slaunderer, that his word is of no credit, and our defence needeth not in respect of the standers by: or if the reuiler is like to be more prouoked by our admonition: in all these cases it is better to be silent. 4. And where defence is needefull, it is not onely lawful for vs priuately to rebuke the slaunderer, but to make complaint vnto the Magistrate, to preserue our good name; as a theife of our goods may be brought before the Magistrate, so much more he that stealeth away our good name. 5. And as concerning Dauid, it was a worthie and commendable part in him to beare Shemeis slaunderous speach: for hee was innocent, he therein considered the Lords purpose to trie him; it was then no time for him to seeke reuenge: he had op∣portunitie offred afterward to meete with this reuiler. Mart. 7. Quest. v. 10. How the Lord is said to haue bidde Shemei curse Da∣uid, and how sinne standeth with the will of God, and whether he is any way the author thereof. 1. First, that God is no way the author of sinne, by these and such like reasons it is made plaine. 1. God is not the author of any thing, whereby a man is made worse: for if an artificer will not marre his owne worke, much lesse God; but by sinne man becommeth much worse. 2. God is the reuenger of sinne, therefore not the author. 3. God hateth nothing which he hath made, but he hateth sinne. 4. He that doth or procureth sinne is a sinner: but God cannot without horrible blasphemie be said to be a sinner. 5. If God should prouoke vnto sinne, we should make him a dissembler & an hy∣pocrite, who forbiddeth one thing, and yet doth an other. 6. The Lord saith by his Prophet Hosea, thy destruction is of thy selfe, then sinne al∣so the cause of destruction is of our selues. 7. Our Sauiour saith, that when the deuill speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his owne, sinne then is peculiar vnto the deuill, therefore nor to God. 8. Christ wept ouer Ierusalem, beeing grieued for the calamitie that should befall it: much more was he grieued for sinne, which was the cause thereof: then is he not the author of sinne. 9. Tyrants make seuere lawes, and then compell men to breake them, that they may punish them: So God should be a tyrant, if he procured or made men sinne and transgresse his lawes. 10. If God were the author of sinne, he could not be the Iudge of the world. 11. If God any wayes should stirre vp vnto sinne, there must needs be two contra∣rie wills in God, one whereby he willeth sinne to be; the other, whereby he disliketh it, and is displeased at it. 12. The wicked should be in no fault, for they might turne all the blame vpon God. 13. Men had no reason to be grieued for their sinne, but to reioyce, seeing they doe that which God is the author of: if he were the author or worker of sinne. 14. If God would haue men saued, then hee would haue them also vse the meanes vnto saluation: then would he not haue them sinne, which doth hinder their
saluation. 2. Secondly, the reasons on the contrarie, that God may be charged with sinne, are these. 1. The Apostle saith, Rom. 1.26. that God gaue vp the Gentiles to vile affections. 2. The Lord is saide to haue hardened Pharaohs heart: and Isa. 6.10. to make the eyes of the Israelites heauie, and to shut their eyes. 3. We say in the Lords prayer, Lead vs not into temptation. 4. He that is the cause of the cause, is the cause of the effect, procured by that cause: But God is the cause and creator of mans will and affections, which are the cause of sinne: he may seeme then to be the cause of sinne. 5. The Lord said to the spirit, that offered to goe & be a false spirit in the mouthes of Ahabs Prophets, goe and prosper, 1. King. 22. 6. Sinne is an action: but all actions proceed from God, the first moouer and be∣ginner: for in him we liue, mooue, and haue our beeing, Act. 17. 7. The Lord saith by his Prophet Ezechiel, c. 14.8. If the Prophet be deceiued when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord haue deceiued him, &c. so Ieremie saith, cap. 4.10. that the Lord had deceiued his people: so Isay saith, 63.17. O Lord, why hast thou made vs erre from thy wayes? 8. Psal. 105.25. Hee turned the heart (of the Egyptians) to hate his people: Iosh. 11.20. It came of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battell: 2. Thess. 2.11. the Apostle saith, Hee shall send them strong delusions to beleeue lies. 9. As God willeth the end, so also hee willeth the meanes which tend vnto that ende: but it was Gods will that Christ should be deliuered vp vnto death, and that the members of Christ, as the holy Apostles and Martyrs should be tried: thereof it was Gods will also that Iudas should betray Christ, and that the tyrants should raise persecution against his Church, which were sinnefull acts. 10. If God can hinder a man from sinne, and will not, and take away from him the helpes, which should keepe him from sinne, he should seeme to be accessarie vnto it: as if we see a man readie to fall into a pit, and forwarne him not of it; or take from one a staffe whereon he leaneth, so that he falleth: we should be guiltie of his hurt: so it should seeme to be betweene God and man; if he should withdraw from him his grace, whereby he might stand. 11. Seeing God doth bring forth substances by vnhonest action, as children be∣gotten in adulterie; why may he not as well produce actions, per malam voluntatem, by the euill inclination and will of man? 12. The Apostles say in their prayer, that Herod and Pilate had assembled them∣selues together, to doe whatsoeuer thine hand and counsell had determined before to bee done: By these and such like places of Scripture, and reasons, some shew may be made that God hath some hand in the sinfull workes of men. 3. In the third place the diuerse opinions must be touched of this matter. 1. Some doe indeede most blasphemously make God the author and worker of e∣uill, as the Libertines: which blasphemie is to be abhorred, and to be condemned to hell with the authors thereof. 2. There are that vnderstand these places of Scripture of Gods permission onely. 3. Some doe thinke that God is an agent euen in euill actions, which as they proceede from man are euill, but as God concurreth it is iust, the reason whereof if we cannot comprehend, we must rest in the iudgement of the Scripture: this opini∣on shall afterward be more fully declared and confirmed. 4. Further, it must be considered what sinne is; it is not a substance, nor yet any subiect or habit in a subiect, but onely a defect and priuation, as blindnes is of the sight: and malum esse non potest nisi in bono, euill cannot be but in that which is good, as blindnesse is in the sight: euill is of two sorts, it is either culpa, the fault, or poena, the punishment: the fault is the absence or priuation of some vertue or grace, and the pu∣nishment is the priuation of some benefit, as sickenesse is of health: and there is some∣thing that is both a sinne and punishment, as originall sinne.
5. Now more fully and distinctly to determine of this question, these conclusions following shall be set downe. 1. God properly is not the cause of euill, nor author of sinne: for the habite neuer of it selfe produceth the priuation, as light bringeth not forth darkenesse: but if the light be remooued, then the darkenesse followeth of it selfe. But like as the Sunne is not the cause of darkenesse; but the Sunne beeing remooued from our hemisphere, then darkenesse of it selfe succeedeth: so when God taketh away his grace (which he doh to make man know and vnderstand, that he can do nothing without grace) then followeth darkenesse and ignorance in our hearts. So that God is not properly the cause of sinne, but onely remouens, the remoouing cause: So that there neede no effi∣cient or positiue cause to be made of sinne, as the Maniches made two Princes, the one of light, to whom they ascribed, why was good, and the others of darkenesse, whom they made the beginning of euill: for by the absence of light and grace, dark∣nesse and euill doe succeede of themselues by the corruption of our nature. 2. Here we must consider of a threefold action of God. 1. One is generall in the works of his prouidence, whereby euerie thing is preserued and maintained in it kind and nature: for in him we mooue, we liue, and haue our beeing. 2. An other is spe∣ciall and particular, whereby he worketh all good things in his Saints. 3. The third is betweene both, whereby God carrieth an ouer-ruling hand in all actions, making all things good and bad, reasonable and vnreasonable creatures to serue vnto his glorie, and to be instruments of his will. And thus God disposeth euen of the sinnefull acts of men, that thereby his will is effected and accomplished, and yet he is no way acces∣sarie to their sinne: so that in the same act, God and mans will may concurre, but af∣ter a diuerse manner: God may iustly will that, and to a good end, which man wil∣leth wickedly and vniustly; as God determined the death of Christ for the redempti∣on of mankind, but Iudas betrayed him of a wicked mind, and Sathan prouoked Iu∣das as an enemie vnto God and the truth. And Augustine further sheweth how in the same thing God willeth and man willeth,Euchirid. ad Laurent. c. 10. but diuersly, by this instance. A wicked sonnes father is sicke, Gods will is he shall die, and so the wicked sonne desireth hee should die also, but to an other ende, that he may enioy his inheritance. So likewise one may will that which God willeth not, and yet bee without sinne: As the good child of loue toward his father desireth his life, whom Gods will and pleasure is shall die of that sickenesse. 3. God may minister an occasion which of it selfe is good, but the wicked abu∣sing it, are thereby stirred vp to doe euill: as when Moses and Aaron brought a mes∣sage vnto Pharaoh to let his people goe: Pharaoh thereupon was incensed to oppresse the people more grieuously: so God might be said to harden Pharaohs heart, but oc∣casionaliter, and accidentaliter, by ministring an occasion, and accidentally onely. 4. The Lord also permissiue, by way of permission, may be said to haue on hand euen in euill actions, which he permitteth to be done; which his permission is in him a kind of will: for if he permitted or suffered any thing nolens, against his will, it would shew an impotencie and want of power; but euen in Gods permission his power appeareth: so permitting euill to be done in the world, as he knoweth how to make it serue for his glorie: and so he permitteth sinne, as that he so disposeth, that it shall not rage or raigne in all, nor in all times, nor further then he seeth it to be for his glorie: But good actions the Lord willeth after an other sort: not onely permitting them to bee done, but effecting, working, finishing, and perfitting in vs euery good worke. 5. Further, there are three things to be considered in sinne: 1. The guilt of sinne, which is nothing else, but obligatio ad poenam, a binding and tying of him that sinneth vnto punishment: and this is an act of Gods iustice, who after one hath sinned, hol∣deth him guiltie of punishment. 2. Then there is the act of sinne, which is the sub∣iect; and this God is the cause of, who giueth power to mooue, to will to doe this or that vnto his creatures, which power hee restraineth not, but suffereth euerie thing which he hath made, and enableth it also to exercise the naturall properties and facul∣ties thereof: Thus God is the author of the action, but the euilnes of the action pro∣ceedeth from mans corrupt nature: like as the soule and life in the body, is the cause
it mooueth, but the lamenesse of the legge or other part affected, is the cause of the halting thereof: So God as an vniuersall agent, giueth life and motion to his creatures, as the soule doth to the bodie, but the abusing and deprauing of these actions, ariseth from the corruption of mans nature. 3. There is in sinne the punishment to be consi∣dered: So God is said to punish sinne with sinne, as the Apostle sheweth how the Lord gaue ouer the Gentiles to a reprobate sense; and to vile affections as a punish∣ment of their Idolatrie, Rom. 1. In this manner, as hath been shewed, how the Lord may be said to haue to do with sinne: but he is no way the author thereof, or properly the cause: And that is no im∣perfection in God, that he cannot sinne, nor will sinne, but it is his perfection: who beeing perfect goodnesse it selfe, cannot abide any thing that is euill: for if he should will sinne to bee, he should turne men from himselfe, which were to denie himselfe, which as the Apostle saith, God cannot doe; God cannot denie himselfe, 2. Tim. 2.13. This thn is the summe of all, that God is not properly the cause of euill, but 1. either by remouing and withholding his grace. 2. by disposing in his infinite wisedome and power, euen of euill actions to serue his glorie. 3. by ministring occasion, which the wicked may abuse and peruert to their further hardening. 4. in permitting things to be done, as farre as hee seeth expedient for the vniuersall good. 5. the guilt of sinne in iustice he procureth. 6. the generall action he causeth. 7. as it is a punishment, he inflicteth it, &c. 7. Now according to these conclusions set downe, the former reasons which see∣med to make God accessarie vnto euill, may thus be answered. 1. God is said to giue vp the Gentiles to vile affections, because hee left them to themselues, and iustly depriued them of his grace. 2. God hardened Pharaohs heart, and blinded the Israelites eyes, occasionaliter, by ministring the occasion, which they abused: Gods workes were an occasion of Pha∣raohs hardening, and his word of the others blinding, but not of themselues: the o∣ther through their peruersnesse tooke occasion to doe euill, where none was giuen, and turned that which was good, to be an occasion of euill. 3. The Lord is said to lead into temptation, because the deuill, who is the temp∣ter, can doe no more then God permitteth: God tempteth not to euill, as hee is not tempted, Iam. 1. And we of our selues are tempted of our owne concupiscence: therefore our Sauiour saith to his Apostles, watch and pray, least yee enter into tempta∣tion, Matth. 26.41. 4. God is the creator of mans will, but not of his corrupt will, which is the cause of sinne, and not his will simply, as God created it. 5. When God saith to the euill spirit, goe and prosper, that is to be referred to the ende, which was the death and punishment of Ahab: but the meanes which was by beeing a lying spirit, God willed not nor commaunded to be done, but hindred not the doing of it, because the Lord knewe how to vse it to his glorie. 6. It is not denied, but that the subiect of sinne, which is the action in generall is from God, who is the moouer of all things: but it followeth not that the euilnesse of the action therefore is from God. 7. God is said to deceiue the Prophet and people, not in respect of the cause thereof, which proceeded from their owne corrupt heart: but in regard of the euent, because God vsed that seduction for their punishment. 8. God is said to turne their hearts to hatred, because the prosperitie of the He∣brewes, which God caused, gaue occasion of enuie and hatred to the Egyptians: the hearts of the Canaanites were hardened, non emolliendo, because God mollified them not. And so God gaue them which beleeued not the truth, strong delusions, as a iust iudge punishing their hardnes of heart and vnbeleefe, with blindnes & peruersnesse. 9. God willeth the meanes, but after an other manner: his will is, that persecutions should be, not simply, but as they tend to his glorie, and to the propagation of the truth. 10. It is crueltie in man, if he suffer one to fall and helpe him not, because a man is bound in charitie to doe it: but God is bound to none: many graces he giues vnto the
wicked, which they abuse: he is not bound to giue all, he may doe with his owne, as it pleaseth him. 11. God is the author of the action, which bringeth forth euill; but not of the e∣uilnesse of the action. 12. Concerning the death and suffering of Christ, God willed it in respect of the ende, which was our redemption: the meane, as the treacherie of Iudas, the malice of the Iewes, he ordained not, but disposed; he willed not, but vsed them. 8. Quest. How Gods prouidence and mans will may stand together. Here are two errours to bee taken heed of in two extreames: Some doe so hold Gods prouidence, as that they exempt some thing from it: some on the contrarie do ascribe all things to the diuine prouidence, as tht they impose a necessitie vpon the will of man, depriuing the same of the naturall libertie and freedome thereof. 1. Of the first opinion was Plato, affirming that there are many things in the world which God is no wayes the cause of,Lib. 2. de Re∣public. as of euill things; which is true, if he speake of the proper efficient cause of sinne: but yet euen in such things Gods prouidence slee∣peth not, directing, ordering, and disposing euill things vnto such ende, as seemeth best vnto himselfe. 2. Damascene also in some sort impugneth Gods prouidence, when hee saith, that , that onely those things which are not within vs, not the things within vs,Lib. . de fide. c. 29. are subiect to Gods prouidence: whereas the Prophet Dauid saith directly, Psal. 139. thou vnderstandest my thoughts long before. He hath an other assertion as dange∣rous, That the election of things to be done is in vs, the perfection and consummation, of the concurring operation of God: whereas the Apostle saith, that God worketh in vs both the will and deede,Philip. 2.13. of his good pleasure. 3. But that distinction of Damasus is not to bee misliked, whereby he diuideth Gods prouidence into , his good pleasure, & , permission and con∣cession: for Gods prouidence is seene in willing and acting of good things, his per∣mission in suffering euil things to be done, not by a bare permission in leauing men to themselues to doe altogether what they list, but in vsing them and ouerruling them. This concession he further maketh of two sorts, diuiding it into , oecomi∣call or disciplinarie concession, in leauing his children sometime to themselues, for their further instruction: there is an other concession , absolute and finall, whereby he suffreth the wicked and inccorrigible finally to fall without recouerie. 2. In the other extreame are they which so hold the diuin prouidence, as that they bring in a fatall necessitie: But God constraineth no mans will: for if it be forced, it is not a will which willeth freely. But here there is a threefold libertie of the will to be considered: there is libertas à coactione, a libertie and freedome from coaction, in all men good and bad: libertas à peccato, a libertie from sinne, that is, from the domi∣nion thereof, when the will is regenerate: and libertas à miseri, a liberie and immu∣nitie from misery, which shall be in the kingdome of God, when we are glorified. But a libertie à necessitate, from a kind of necessitie, man now hath not: he cannot choose but sinne. Adam before he fell had this libertie also: for it was in his power not to haue sinned, if he would: but now a necessitie of bondage and corruption is laid vp∣on his posteritie: but yet the mind of naturall men worke freely in respect of any vio∣lence, constraint, or coaction. 9. Quest. v. 16. Of Cushai his salutation to Absalom, God saue the King: whether therein he did well. 1. Some to excuse this fact, thinke that Cushai, saying, let the King liue: that hee meant eternall life, wishing that Abshalom might take such a course, as might not hinder his saluation: but the meaning of this phrase, in saluting of their kings, was nothing else but to wish them prosperitie: as the Chalde interpreter readeth. 2. Some thinke that Cushai here lied euidently, mntitur impissimo tyranno, he lied vnto this wicked tyrant: seeming as though God, and all the people of Israel, had chosen Abshalom: and he taketh that miscreant-companie for the Church of God: Martyr. so also Iosephus sheweth how he vseth two reasons for his dissimulation: one,
because God had chosen Abshalom king, the other the kingdome was not devol∣ued vnto a straunger, but descended vnto the sonne. But seeing that Chushai herein followed Dauids direction, and immediately vpon his prayer, I cannot thinke, that Dauid would be the author of such palpable flattrie. 3. Osiander thinketh it was mendacium officiosum, an officious lie, which was no sinne: but euerie lie is sinne, as is shewed before, qu. 11. c. 15. 4. Therefore as I there resolued with Iunius, Chushai rather deludeth Abshalom with ambiguous speach: and vseth a kind of ironia: Borrh. speaking by the con∣trarie: and all this was thus disposed, diuina prouidentia, by the diuine proui∣dence: Chushai cannot be excused from some humane infirmitie in this his dissi∣mulation, yet it is too much to charge him with lying and flatterie: for he sought not any aduantage to himselfe, as flatterers do, but only the safetie and preseruation of the Lords annointed. In respect whereof, excusandus est à tanto, si non à toto, he may be ex∣cused if not altogether, yet from so great a sinne: Pellican. as in the imputation of ly∣ing and flatterie: See more hereof before, qu. 11. c. 15. 10. Quest. v. 19. Of the truth of Chushai his speach, as I serued thy father, so will I be before thee. 1. True it is, that when good Magistrates are remooued, and worse come in their place, we must yeeld obedience vnto them in all lawfull things, so long as they com∣maund not things contrarie to the word of God. As the Romans were obedient to Iulius Caesar, after he had spoiled them of their libertie, and to the Emperor Phocas ha∣uing slaine Mauritius. 2. But the case is diuerse here, for neither was Dauid dead, and therefore Absha∣lom was an vsurper, his father yet liuing: and other Princes haue not the expresse word of God for their gouernment, as Dauid had who was anointed by Samuel; and therefore the people here were to obey none other but Dauid. 3. The like may be said, when good Ministers are expelled, & alij instituuntur non ita boni, and others not so good are set in their place: all good meanes must be vsed, by prayer and such like, that good Ministers be not cast out: sed si alij substituuntur, audiendi sunt, but if others be substituted in their place, they must be heard as long as they preach the truth. Mart. 11. Quest. v. 21. Of Achitophels peruerse counsell to Abshalom to goe in to his fathers concubines. 1. Achitophel giueth counsell contrarie to the word of God: he would haue Ab∣shalom lie with his fathers concubines or wiues, which was forbidden by Gods law: but he respecteth his owne profit, more then the glorie of God. 2. For this was his pollicie, to make Abshalom odious to his father, that there might be no hope of re∣conciliation: for he feared, least if that Abshalom should be receiued to his fathers fauour, all they that tooke his part, should goe to wracke. 3. This was very proba∣ble, but not necessarie: for though Ruben had defiled his fathers bed, yet Iacob did not vtterly cast him off from beeing counted among his brethren, though he depriued him of his birthright. And Dauid notwithstanding this villanie, yet altogether with∣drew not his affection from his sonne, as appeareth by his mourning for him. 4. The Hebrewes thinke that Achitophel herein did reuenge his own quarell, because Dauid had committed adulterie with Bathsheba, who was Achitophels neece by his sonne Eliam: who was the sonne of Achitophel, and is numbred among Dauids worthies, c. 23.14. 5. This Achitophel was such another craftie man, and wicked counseller to Abshalom, as Ionadab before was to Amnon. If Dauids house were not void of such flaterers and wicked counsellers, it is no maruell, if they abound in Princes Coures in these daies. 6. Abshalom here now bewraieth himselfe by this abominable act, that he was not reuenged of Amnon so much for his incest, as of malice and spight, seeing here he committeth more grieuous incest himselfe: Mart. 7. But this fell out by Gods prouidence, as the Prophet Nathan had told Dauid before, that he should be thus corrected for his sinne of adulterie. Borrh. 12. Quest. How this incest of Abshalom might stand with Gods will. 1. It is certaine, that all things which are foreseene of God, shall necessarily come
to passe, & praevideri non quia futura sunt, and that they are foreseene, not because they shall come to passe, but therefore they shall come to passe, because they are fore∣seene. 2. It also followeth that nothing falleth out by chaunce, but according to the decree and foresight of God. 3. But further, there is great difference betweene the ineuitable necessitie of the counsells of God, and necessitie which is by compulsion and coaction: notwitstanding God foreseeth the sinnes of men, which therefore are ineuitable, yet they commit them freely and willingly, as Abshalom did this incest here. As God is by an ineuitable necessitie good, and Sathan euill: the one can not be otherwise then good, nor the other then euill: yet God is freely good without compulsion, and so is Sathan euill: Borrh. 13. Quest. v. 23. Why Achitophels counsell is likened to the Oracle of God. 1. Iunius referreth it to this present counsell of Achitophel, which though it were in it selfe most horrible and wicked, yet it was applauded by the vngodly, as most sound counsell: but the text speaketh not onely of this time, but of his former coun∣sells in the daies of Dauid. 2. So that Achitophels counsell is not so called onely in respect of that authoritie which it had in the opinion of men: Osiand. 3. But because of the good successe, which his counsell vsed to haue. Genevens. And this counsell, which he giueth now, though it were wicked, yet it was for the present time verie perilous and pestilent. 4. His counsell was so esteemed of in Dauids time also: but with this difference; Dauid approoued of his counsell, as hee found it agreeable to Gods word: but Abshalom and his companie follow it howsoeuer, if it serued their turne: yet this is an hyperbolical speach, comparatio est non aequiparatio, it is a compa∣rison onely, not an equalizing of his counsell vnto the oracle of God, vnlesse it were in the opinion of carnall and worldly wise men. Mar. 5. And such a wise man was Achitophel, carnally or worldly, not religiouslly wise: such wisedome as may be and is giuen many times to wicked men. Borrh. CHAP. 17. 1. Quest. v. 1. Of Achitophels peruers and wicked counsell against Dauid. 1. COunsell of it selfe is a sacred thing, and commended in the Scripture; and as it is of necessarie vse in all affaires, so specially in battell, which must be enter∣prised by counsell, Prou. 24.6. But here it is abused by this craftie man. 2. Who offen∣deth three waies in this his counsell: in the matter, which is consulted of, the means, and the end. 1. For the matter, there are two things, that doe not fall vnder consultati∣on; either such as are certaine and necessarie, and cannot be preuented, or things which are subiect to chaunce, and haue no certaintie at all: but of such things counsell is taken, which are electiue, and incident into humane affaires: herein then first Achi∣tophels counsell faileth, because he giueth counsell in a thing impossible: God had determined, that Dauids kingdome should be established. 2. The meanes in delibe∣ration should be honest, but these which he propoundeth, are most dishonest. 3. The ende also is vngodly, in seeking to ouerthrow the Lords Annointed. Mar. 3. Now the speciall cause, why Achitophel is thus bent against Dauid, was for that hee ambitiously aspired to honour and riches: as he was reputed a wise counseller, so now he taketh vpon him to be the Captaine and leader of Abshaloms armie, that he might every way grow great, and in high reputation with Abshalom and the peo∣ple. The Hebrewes giue another reason of his hatred against Dauid, because of Bath∣sheba, which is touched before, c. 16. qu. 11.
2. Quest. v. 3. Of the meaning of these words, As the retur∣ning of all, (is) the man, whom thou seekest. 1. Some read thus, when all shall returne, and the man, whom thou seekest, (beeing slaine) C.G.B. but there these words, beeing slaine are added, which are not in the text. 2. Some thus, when all the men are returned vnto thee, whom thou desirest. V.A. But there is a distinction, at hacol, all, which sheweth that it is seuered from the word following haish, the man: which word hauing an article prefixed before it, shew∣eth some speciall man. 3. The Latine readeth thus, I will bring ll the people againe, as one man vseth to returne: for thou seekest one man: for here in the former clause, as one man, and in the next, one, are not in the originall. 4. The Septuag. thus, like as (the spouse) returneth (to) her husband: here these wordes inclosed (the spouse) and (to) are not found in the text. 5. Some giue this sense, and when euery man is returned, (which is the thing) which thou seekest. Emman. Sa. But there is a distinction at hachal, euery, or all; which sheweth, that it is not ioyned in construction with haish, man, as the sub∣stantiue and adiectiue, as is before shewed. 6. Therefore I here preferre Iunius rea∣ding, as the returning of all, (is) the man, whom thou seekest: that is, when thou get test him, thou shalt in a manner get all. 3. Quest. v. 7. Of Chushai his counsell in ge∣nerall. 1. Chushai verie wisely doth not discommend Achitophels counsell in generall, least he might haue beene thought to speake of enuie, or be suspected as a dissembler: but he doth (at this time) onely take exception to his counsell, as giuing him the praise of a wise counseller at other times. Mart. Iun. 2. Beside Chushai sheweth his modestie, not preferring himselfe before Achitophel, but giuing him simply the prioritie of sound counsell and aduise: onely in this one thing, and at this time hee dissenteth from him. Osiand. 3. Chushai verie wisely among other suggestions, which were improbable, mingleth diuerse things which are true, as v. 8. that his father was a valiant man, and expert in warre, and of great courage: for he knew, without the inserting of some things euidently true, hee should hardly perswade the rest. Mart. 4. Beside Chushai doth cunningly applie himselfe to the ambitious and insolent young mans humor, insinuating what a mightie people, and large kingdome he had, from Dan to Beersheba, and so Abshalom allectus laudibus suis, beeing allured by his owne praise, giueth eare vnto Chushai: Pellic. 5. Further his faithfulnesse appeareth toward Dauid: for the end of Chushai was to gaine time, that Dauid should not be set vpon of a suddaine, but haue respite giuen him to prouide for himselfe, and to be better prepared. Mart. 6. He is warie also and circumspect: for though his coun∣sell were approoued, yet he would not trust Abshalom; hee might thinke his minde might alter, and therefore hee sendeth word presently vnto Dauid. v. 15. 4. Quest. Of the seuerall and particular points of Chushai his counsell. First, Chushai doth infringe Achitophels counsell by fiue seuerall arguments. 1. He alleadgeth that Dauid was himselfe a valiant man, and the rest of his people, that were with him. 2. And beside their ordinarie valour, beeing thus suddenly assaulted, they would be so much the more fierce, as a beare robbed of his whelpes: not her whelpes, as B.G.L.S. for the word dobh is put in the masculine, as is euident by the participle shacul put in the masculine: for the hee beare, as well as the shee doth helpe to hatch vp their young, and both doe rage, when their whelpes are taken away: Borrh. 3. Thy father is an expert warrier, and a warie man, he hath his watch, he will not lodge as a common souldier with the rest, but will withdraw himselfe. 4. Hee vrgeth the inconueniencie of the place, hee is hid in some caue, so that their labour should be fru∣strate in seeking him. 5. Hee sheweth the daunger, that if they should presently ioyne battell in the night, if but a few of Absalons men should be slaine, it would be noised, that al his forces were discomfited. Mar. And in this maner Chushai shewed the weak∣nesse of Achitophels counsell. 2. Then hee commeth to giue contrarie aduise: in euerie point opposing himselfe
to Achitophel. 1. Whereas Achitophel had aduised to follow after Dauid presently that night, Chushai would haue some further time taken till more forces might be ga∣thered together. 2. Achitophel required but 12. thousand; Chushai would haue all the people gathered together, as the sand of the sea in multitude. 3. Achitophel would goe himselfe as Captaine of the armie, but Chushai perswadeth Abshalom to goe in his owne person. 4. Achitophel pretended to take the King his father onely, v. 2. but Chushai sheweth a course to be taken, that neither hee nor any one of his men should be left: Borrh. 5. And the better to perswade, hee sheweth the facilitie of this enterprise: ow easily they shall vanquish him, either in the field, by falling vpon him, as the dew in multitude, or if he get himselfe within a citie, they will pull it with ropes, that is, engines of warre fastened with ropes into the riuer, that is, the ditches and trenches filled with water, which enuironed the walled townes. Mar. 5. Quest. v. 14. Of the approbation of Chushai his counsell before Achitophels. 1. By this example we see, that it is not enough to haue good counsell propoun∣ded, but it is necessarie to haue a good iudgement to discerne of counsells which is the best: Achitophel gaue here most daungerous, and pernicious counsell, but Ab∣shalom was blinded, that he saw not, what was good for himselfe. Mar. 2. It is ther∣fore called the good counsell of Achitophel, not that it was simply good, for the Lord then would not haue destroyed it; but it was good and profitable for Abshalom, not that any thing indeed is good and profitable, which is not honest, but this is so said according to the phrase and speach of men, which vse to call those things good, which are commodious and profitable. 3. This came of God, that Achitophels counsel should be reiected: so that Chushai can not be here accused, mendacij & simula∣tionis improbae, of lying and wicked dissembling, it beeing by Gods direction. Borrh. 4. And the end is shewed, why the Lord destroied the counsell of Achitophel, that Ab∣shalom might be punished: who was guiltie of two horrible sinnes, rebellion and parricide intended against his father, and incest in the highest degree: therefore he was worthily punished, and by Chushai his counsell, hee was brought into that battell, where he was slaine. 6. Quest. v. 15. Whether Chushai did well to discouer the counsell of Achitophel. 1. If Chushai were not sworne to keepe secret this counsell, therein there was no offence at all: nay he had sinned, if hee had not reuealed it, seeing the king and the commonwealth were now in great daunger: otherwise it is the part of counsellers to be faithfull in keeping to themselues the counsells of the kingdome:In ff. de re mili∣tar. l. omni. by the Ciuill law it was made death, to betraie the secrets of the state, especially in warlike and militarie affaires: Papinus is commended in the Romane Histories, because hee would not reueale to his mother, beeing but a child, the secret consultations of the Senate. 2. Yea though Chushai had taken an oath to be secret in this case, he might law∣fully breake his oath: seeing it was an vnlawfull oath against the glorie of God, and tending to the ruine and subuersion of the Commonwealth. Mart. 7. Quest. Of Gods prouidence in deliuering the messengers from daunger, that were sent to Dauid. 1. The Preists within the citie, Zadok and Abiathar could not themselues goe forth of the citie, without suspition, the gates beeing kept and watched, but they sent a maid with the message vnto their sonnes, that waited in the field, of whose fidelitie they had experience: so Dauids safetie depended here vpon the faithfulnesse of a maid: God many times vseth weake meanes to deliuer his seruants by. 2. This matter is es∣pied by a young man, not (as Iosephus saith) by Abshaloms horsemen, as the Deuill neuer wanteth instruments in such case to worke mischiefe. 3. But by Gods proui∣dence, the messengers escaped, and were hid in a drie pit, where it seemeth there was small store of water, such an one, as that was, into which Iosephs brethren let him downe: which beeing couered with a cloth whereon ground corne was spread, by the wife of the house, was not discerned: the woman making a present excuse (as that sex
is verie ingenious in their readie inuentions, Osiand.) that they were gone: this ex∣cuse of the woman, was like vnto that of the midwiues in Egypt, Exod. 1. and of Rahab: the good seruice, which she did, and her faithfull heart to God and his Anoin∣ted, doe hide her womanly infirmitie therein. 4. Thus, although that God had cer∣tainely determined, that Dauids kingdome should be confirmed, and the Lord had promised him by his Prophet Nathan, that hee should not die: yet all cautelous meanes, and circumspection is vsed of euery side, that Gods decree might take place: for though wee be sure of Gods fauour, yet the meanes must not be neglected. 8. Quest. v. 22. How Dauid escaped and passed ouer Iordan. 1. Dauid was here driuen to a great streight, who beeing wearied with the trauaile of the day, and grieued also and perplexed in mind trauaileth all night till he came to Iordan, and was passing ouer till the dawning of the day: hee was not farre from Ba∣burim, Pellican. which was not aboue foure or fiue miles from Ierushalem, for it was but two miles from Anathoth, which was distant some three miles from the citie,in Iosu. c. 22. v. 17. Mas. ex Hieronym. when the messengers came to him: so that hee trauelled all night, and that with great speed, that hee might come to Iordan, and haue time to passe ouer it. 2. But Dauid in this extremitie findeth great comfort, that God so strengthened them, that there was not one of his companie missing, but all safly went ouer Iordan. 3. Wherein Dauid was an euident type of Christ, who lost not any of those which were committed vnto him, sauing the child of perdition. Mart. This Iordan which saued Dauid and his companie going and returning, Borrhaius also ma∣keth a type of baptisme, which saueth those, which are baptised indeed into the death of Christ. 9. Quest. Of Achitophels desperate end. 1. Achitophel is assaulted with two violent affections at once, feare and pride: for if Dauid preuailed, which thing hee foresaw was like to come to passe, his counsell beeing reiected, then he feared, that Dauid would be reuenged of him for his trea∣cherie: for he measured him by himselfe: if Abshalom had the better, yet he saw hee should liue in disgrace, because his counsell was refused: and so hee hangeth himselfe in despaire. Mar. 2. Thus it falleth out, that wicked counsell doth cheifly redound to the hurt of the author thereof. Borrh. 3. This wicked man set his house in an order before hee died, but he hath no care of his soule: all his minde is of his money, goods, lands, but of his soule he is care∣lesse: he bethinketh not himselfe what should become of that, as many other worldly men doe. Mar. 4. This Achitophel is here an euident type and forerunner of the traytor Iudas, who by his treacherous counsell betraying his Master hanged himselfe, as here Achi∣tophel doth, that betrayed Dauid; the like ende to like Counsellers God send. 10. Quest. v. 25. Of Iithrah the father of Amasa, and Nahash. 1. Iithrah is here called an Israelite, but 1. Chron. 2.17. he is said to be an Ismae∣lite: R. Kimhi thinketh he was an Israelite by nation and kinred, but an Ismaelite by habitation: so also Vatablus: but he was an Ismaelite rather by nation, and an Israe∣lite in habitation: Iun. because here he had his wife, and here were his children. 2. Nahash some take for Ishai Dauids father, who had two daughters, Zeruiah, who had three sonnes, Ioab, Abishai, and Asahel; and Abigail the mother of Amasa: and R. Kimhi thinketh he was called Nahash, or Nachash, which signifieth a serpent, by the contrarie, because he was without any venome or bitternesse: And some doe further shew this out of that place, Isai. 14.29. Out of the serpents roote shall come a cockatrice: where the word Nachash is put: which they expound of Hezekiah, that was descen∣ded of the roote of Ishai: but out of such propheticall predictions, where all things are vttered in parables and figuratiue speaches, no certaintie of historicall names can be gathered. Therefore this Nahash seemeth rather to be the name of a woman Abigails mother, not the sister of Zeruiah as Osiander; but the wife of Ishai. Iun.
11. Quest. v. 27. Of Shebi the sonne of Nahash that came to succour Dauid, who hee was. 1. R. Salomon thinketh that this Shebi was the same, who before was called Ha∣nun King of Ammon, who so despightfully vsed Dauids messengers, who after the victorie was preserued, and became a Proselyte of the Israelites religion: but that is not like, because after the first discomfiture, Ioab a whole yeare laied seige to Rabbah, which businesse they needed not to haue beene put vnto, if Hanun had yeelded. 2. R. Dauid Kimhi thinketh hee was an Israelite: but the text saith, that he was of Rabbath of the children of Ammon. 3. Some thinke he was the sonne of Hanun: but the text saith, he was the sonne of Nahash: and if he had beene Hanuns sonne, it is like he would haue rather reuenged his fathers quarrell. 4. Their opinion is then more probable, that thinke this Shebi to haue beene the brother of Hanun, both sonnes to Nahash, whom Dauid shewed mercie vnto in the ouerthrow of Rabbah: and hee to requite Dauids kindnesse, now comforteth him: Mart. Borrh. Osiand. Iosephus calleth him Siphar, a prince of the Ammonites coun∣trie. 12. Quest. v. 27. Of the compassion and releefe, which was shewed and ministred to Dauid. 1. Dauid is persecuted of his sonne, and his nephew Amasa his sisters sonne is the Captaine of the host against him: he findeth more fauour at the hands of strangers, euen of the Ammonites, which had beene his enemies, then of his owne kinred: as Christ was receiued of the Samaritans, when the Iewes reiected him. Mart. 2. Their mercie is much to be commended in these three respects: they minister releefe vnto Dauid vnasked, they come of themselues, Shebi, Machir, Barzillai: Mart. and they succour Dauid in great extremitie, when the people were both hungrie and thirstie, v. 29. and at such a time, as was most daungerous, the conspiracie against Dauid bee∣ing so strong. 3. And this is worthie to be considered, that such a victorious and rich King as Dauid was, now hath not a bed to lie on, or any earthen vessell to wash his hands in; for all these things were brought him: which is a mirrhor for Princes to see the vncertaintie of their estate, and how soone their honour may be laid in the dust. 4. And herein Dauid was a type of the true Dauid, who in the dayes of his flesh was hungrie, wearie, thirstie, and ministred vnto by others: Pellican. CHAP. 18. 1. Quest. v. 1. Whence Dauid had the great supplie of men. THey come vnto him partly with those his freinds, which brought him victualls, c. 17.28. partly the tribes of Ruben, Gad, and Manasses, which inhabited beyond Iordan came flocking vnto Dauid, for these reasons: 1. They abhorred such vnna∣turall disobedience in the sonne against the father. 2. They were more remote from the Court, and loued the King the better. 3. And beeing farre off, they were not cor∣rupted and entised with Abshaloms flatterie, as the other were. Pellican. 2. Quest. v. 3. Why the people would not haue Dauid goe with them in person. 1. They knew that Dauid was the man, that was sought for, as Achitophel had said before, that they would smite him alone, c. 17.2. and therefore they will haue him stay at home. Pellican. 2. As Hushai had giuen counsell, that Achitophel should goe in person, because the Lord had determined to bring vpon him destruction, c. 11.14. so it falleth out by Gods direction, that Dauid should not goe into the battell, that hee might be pre∣serued. Borrh. 3. When they should perceiue that Dauid was not present, they would not pursue
the rest so eagerly, nor greatly care almost for the victorie: Osiand. 4. And Dauid al∣so staying at home, might assist them out of the citie with his counsell, Pell. and pray∣er, Ch. and with supply of the battell, if neede were. Ioseph. 3. Quest. Of the meaning of these words, v. 3. thou art as tenne thousand of vs. 1. Some expound it thus, for there are about tenne thousand of vs: Vatab. but beside that, there is no certaintie of the number, which Iosephus thinketh, exceeded not fowre thousand: in this sense it hath small coherence with the words before going, though halfe of vs were dead, they would not passe for vs. 2. Some of the Hebrewes doe thus vnderstand it, though ten thousand such as we should be slain, they would not care: but here beside that these words should be slaine, are not in the text, this in effect they said before, if halfe of vs should be dead, how many soeuer they were. 3. Others thus, though as we are now we should be tenne thousand: Iun. that is, ten times so many as we are, they would not care: but if this were spoken by way of comparison, their meaning should be, if they were tenne thousand times more, not ten times more. 4. Therefore I pre∣ferre the vsuall reading, bur, thou art as tenne thousand of vs, by the enterlacing of these words, thou art: for beside that most interpreters consent herein, the Chald. Septuag. Latin. Pagnin. Pellic. Borrh. Osiand. it best agreeth with the sense, and answereth to the other part of the comparison, they care not for vs though halfe of vs be killed, but thou art the man, more worth then ten thousand of vs, whom they seeke for: as al∣so the conclusion inferred, that it were better therefore for him to stay in the citie, doth more fitly depend vpon this sense: as also the peoples speach hath herein relation vnto Achitophels, who had said before, c. 17.3. that one man whom they sought was as the returning of all the people. 5. Now they say, Dauid was as ten thousand; 1. both because his counsell, and the efficacie of his prayers would stand them in as much stead as ten thousand: Pellic. 2. and in respect of his dignitie and excellencie, he was worthie so to bee esteemed. Borrh. 3. as also in respect of his enemies, who had rather haue his life, then the liues of tenne thousand: Iun. 4. and the commonwealth should sustaine greater losse by his death, then if ten thousand of them were slaine. Osiand. 4. Quest. Why Dauid was wished to stay in the citie. 1. Iunius readeth, If thou watch for our sake to helpe: the word megher, hee would haue deriued from ghur, to watch, not from gher, a citie: that he should watch his time to helpe them if neede were: but if the word were so deriued, it should be com∣pounded of the preposition min, which signifieth from, which would make a contrarie sense; as Hosh. 7.4. fom watching or raising, as though hee should nowe leaue wat∣ching. 2. The vsuall reading then is to be preferred: they would haue him helpe them out of the citie, that is, Mahanaim, whether Dauid was come, chap. 17.24. from thence he should helpe, 1. by his prayer, Chald. 2. by his counsell and aduise: Pellic. Vatabl. 3. by rescuing the armie if they should be put to flight, into the citie: Osiand. 4. and by renewing the battell, and encouraging the soldiers, the enemie also surmising, that Dauid stayed behind with a new supply. Ioseph. lib. 7. c. 9. 5. Quest. out of v. 3. What number of men Dauid had in his armie. 1. Iosephus thinketh, there were about foure thousand of them, and not aboue: but that is not like, because Dauid appointed captaines ouer hundreds, and ouer thou∣sands; and beside ranged his host into three battells, v. 2. this sheweth that his num∣ber was greater then of foure thousand. 2. Some thinke, that he had ten thousand or thereabout: Vat. as it may appeare by his reading before, qu. 3. but it seemeth their number was not so great, because they were victualled by three men, Sheba, Machir, and Barzillai, c. 11.17.27. which had beene enough for a king to doe. 3. It may be also coniectured, that they were 20. thousand, because they made mention of the halfe part of them before, and now giuing this instance of tenne thou∣sand,
to the which they preferre Dauid, it may be supposed that to be the halfe part; sic fere Pellic. But this opinion is refused for the reason before alleadged. 4. Wherefore, as their number is like not to haue beene so small as of foure thou∣sand, so neither is it probable it was so great as of ten or twentie thousand: I therefore take the middle scantling; there might be some sixe thousand, or somewhat more, but vnder ten: to each of the three wings two thousand or thereabout might be assigned: for if the number had been so great, the victorie had not beene so glorious: and Da∣uids host consisted most of his domesticall followers and friends, and therefore they are called his seruants, v. 7. 6. Quest. v. 4. In what place Dauid stood, when he sawe the people goe out by their armies. 1. Some thinke, that Dauid stood before the gate, toward the high way: Chald. where they vse to sit to behold the cōmers by, as Lot sate at the gate of Sodom, Gen. 19.1. Vatab. 2. Some that he sate neere the gate: Lat. or at the side of the gate: S.B.G. not in the verie gate, where the souldiers were to goe through. 3. But the words are el iadh, ad manum, in the hand, that is, the space or place of the gate: for so is the word taken for a place, v. 18. it was called Absaloms place: this space is described to bee betweene the two gates, vers. 24. Iun. that is, between the inward and the outward gate. Osiand. the one of these gates was in the wall, v. 24. the other was in the ante∣murall, or before the wall: Pell. and it was that place where they vsed to sit in iudge∣ment: Genev. as Dauid came afterward, & sat in the gate to shew himself to the people, c. 19.8 Dauid then stood in the entrance or wide space of the gate, while the people passed by him. 7. Quest. v. 5. Why Dauid would not haue Absalom killed. Dauid gaue charge to the captaines to spare Absalom. 1. Because his owne con∣science gaue him, that hee was raised vp as an instrument of Gods iudgement vpon him for his sinne: Pell. 2. He feared least that if Absalom should be cut off in the midst of his rebellion, he should vtterly perish; and therefore he desired that he might haue a time of repentance giuen him: Osiand. 3. Dauid herein, in sparing his enemie, and praying for him that persecuted, him was a type of Christ that prayed for his ene∣mies. Borrh. 8. Quest. v. 6. Of the wood of Ephraim, where the battell was pitched. 1. Some think it was called the wood of Ephraim, though on the other side of Ior∣dan where the Ephraimites had no inheritance, because it was right ouer against the tribe of Ephraim, only diuided by the riuer Iordan: Pel. Bor. 2. The Hebrewes will haue it so called, because the Ephraimites vsed to send their cattell ouer Iordan, & feed them in that wood, which was not denied them: Vat. Gen. 3. But it is more probable, that it was so called because of the slaughter of the Ephramites there made by Iephte, Iud. 12. and therefore it had the name of Ephraim though it were situate in the tribe of Manasseh. Iun. 9. Quest. out of v. 8. Of the great slaughter of Absaloms men. 1. They were not only destroyed in battell, but fell in the chase as they fled: Ioseph. 2. And the wood deuoured them, while they ranne among the trees and fell vpon the stubs: Iun. 3. And tumbling into ditches, and pits, and caues vnknowne: Pell. 4. The wild beasts also might help to deuoure and consume them: Ch. who are by a metony∣mie vnderstood by the wood. Borr. 5. And whereas twentie thousand fell by the sword, ver. 7. and more were consumed by the wood then by the sword, the whole number in all exceeded 40. thousand. Osiand. 10. Quest. Of Absaloms hanging by the haire in the oake. v. 9. 1. Wherein Absalom delighted, and was most proud of, therein is he punished: he is hanged by the haire, which he nourished and kept long of purpose to glorie in it, c. 14.16. Gods iustice herein appeareth, that punisheth a man wherein he sinneth: Osi∣and.
2. Euerie creature is readie to take reuenge of the wicked: the oake taking hold aboue, and the mule going away vnder him, doe both conspire to punish his wicked∣nesse: the oake had boughs winding and wrapping one within an other, like vnto a bramble or bush: he was caught by the haire in the oake, as Abrahams ramme by the hornes in the bush, Gen. 22.13. where the same word seboch is vsed, with a litle change in the prints. 3. Absalom hanged aloft betweene heauen and earth, as accursed of God, as that kind of death was accursed by the law of God: the like shamefull death came Achitophel to, for the like sinne of rebellion and disobedience: and Iudas after∣ward, of whom Achitophel was a type, that after he had betrayed Christ, hung him∣selfe. Borrh. 11. Quest. Out of v. 11. Of the reward promised by Ioab to him that brought tydings of Abshaloms hanging by the haire. 1. The reward promised by Ioab to the souldier, was not 50. shekels, as Iosephus: but tenne shekels, and a soldiers girdle, which was a signe of strength and valour, and an ornament, and ensigne of honour: Osiand. 2. The shekel here is to bee valued at the rate of the common and vsuall shekel, which was but halfe so much as the shekel of the Sanctuarie, which waighed 20. gerahs, Exod. 30.13. the gerah waighed 16. bar∣ry cornes, the common shekel then waighed 10. gerahs, that is, an 160. barley corns, which maketh two drachmaes, and somewhat more, that is, a quarter of an ounce, the fourth part of a doller, containing an ounce of siluer, about 14. pence sterling. Osian∣der then is deceiued, that here iudgeth the shekel to be in value and weight equall to the doller. 3. Iosephus also is here in an errour, that so reporteth this storie, as though Ioab should haue offred the soldier these shekels to go, and thrust Absalom through; whereas he only saith, it was in me, or with me, that is, in my power to haue rewarded thee. 12. Quest. v. 13. Of the souldiers answer to Ioab. 1. Some read, If I had committed a trespasse against his soule: because the affix hath the letter of the pronoune, which signifieth his, which is vaf: Osiand. but it retaineth the vowel of the affix of the first person, which is chirik, which is more to bee regarded, benopshi: therefore it is rather to be read, my soule. 2. Which Iunius vnderstandeth to be ex meipso, of my selfe, that is, of mine owne head: but rather hee signifieth, that it should haue beene with the danger of his life: Vat. B. 3. The third word sheker, is not generally to be translated , S. if I had done this wickednesse or vniust thing, but it signifieth a lie: A.P. or falsitie: C. Iun. both in that he should haue done falsely, in going against the kings commaundement: V. as also in denying the fact afterward, & so telling a lie: Iun. which yet he could not haue hidden, because the king by his wis∣dome would haue searched it out. 4. And the last words are better read with an inter∣rogation, wouldst thou haue stroue against it? that is, haue opposed thy selfe against the kings sentence in my defence? I.V. then to read them affirmatiuely, thou wouldest haue stood against me thy selfe, as it is vsually read: for the souldier would not haue so vnman∣nerly charged his generall to his face. 13. Quest. Why Ioab taketh three darts. 1. The Hebrews think that Ioab did this, because he had thrice dissembled with Da∣uid, with the Elders of Israel, and with the 200. whom he had seduced, c. 15.11. 2. But it is more likely, that Ioab did remember how thrice he had broken his faith, after he had reconciled him to his father. Pel. first, when he plaied those pranks in burning Io∣abs corne while he dwelt in Ierusalem: and afterward when he stole away the hearts of the people, and accused his fathers gouernment, after he was admitted to his pre∣sence: and thirdly, when he rebelled, making his father to beleeue, that hee went to Hebron to pay his vow. 3. Or rather this might be, because Absalom had committed three great sinnes, murther against Amnon, rebellion against his father, and incest in lying with his wiues: Osian. 4. Or because Absalom had three kinds of death; he was thrust through of Ioab, and afterward killed of his men, and lastly ouerwhelmed with stones. 5. But these coniectures need not: for he took three darts to make sure work, that he might throughly dispatch him. 14. Quest. Whether Ioab sinned in killing Absalom contray to Dauids charge. 1. Some think that Ioab & the yong men sinned in killing Absalom, because the king
had otherwise charged them: Osiand. 2. But I rather encline to their opinion, which commend in this act the faithfulnesse, iustice, and wisedome of Ioab, and vpon these reasons. 1. Ioab had good experience of Absalom alreadie, whome he had twice re∣conciled to his father, and still broke his faith, and therefore had no hope of his a∣mendement. 2. He had Gods warrant, beeing now a cheife Iusticiarie in the battell, to put to death a murderer not onely of Amnon, but by whose meanes twentie thou∣sand of the Lords people were slaine, beeing now offered of God into his hands: neither needed any witnesses to conuince him, the euidence of the fact shewing it self: Pellic. 3. He knowing that Absalom would be still a dangerous man to the whole state, thinketh it best to take him out of the way, preferring the safetie of the whole com∣monwealth, before the priuate affection of the king. 4. And that Ioab herein offen∣ded not appeareth, both for that Dauid neither expostulated with him after the bat∣tell, neither when he accused Ioab to Salomon for the murther of Abner and Amasa, made he any mention of the killing of Absalom. Bor. 15. Quest. Out of the 17. v. of Abshaloms manner of death. 1. Absalom beside the smiting through with darts, was also stoned by Gods iust iudgement, by whose lawe, they which were disobedient to their fathers and mo∣thers were stoned to death: Osiand. 2. This was also a iust punishment of Absaloms pride, that as he had beene too much giuen to ambitious ostentation while hee liued, and to that ende had reared vp a pillar to be a monument of his fame vnto posteritie, now in stead of that pillar, he shrowded vnder an heape of stones: Pellic. 3. So was the king of Hai serued, there was laid vpon him beeing dead an heape of stones, Iosh. 8.29. and the fiue Kings whom Ioshua ouercame, Iosh. 10.27. 16. Quest. Of Absaloms children, v. 18. 1. Some thinke, that whereas it is said before, c. 14.27. that Absalom had three sonnes and a daughter, that all his children were now dead: sic Geneuens. but it is not necessarie to thinke, that all of them were taken away, but onely his sonnes, as the words of the text are, for he said, I haue no sonne, &c. 2. Iosephus is of opinion, that his sonnes were not dead alreadie, but he prouided, if they should chance to die without issue, that by this pillar he should be remembred: but the text is plaine, that they were dead at this time, as the Chalde well expresseth, non est mihi filius superstes, &c. I haue no sonne left. 3. God therefore had now depriued him of his three sonnes mentioned before, c. 14. Iun. he that was so vnnaturall to his father, was not worthie to haue any children. Pellic. 17. Quest. v. 21. Of the Cushite whom Ioab sent with the newes vnto Dauid. 1. Some read Cushai, as though he were the same with that Cushai before mentio∣ned, which was Dauids friend: Osiand. but there is great difference in the names: that is Cushai, with pathah, this Cushi, with chirieh, and that Cushai was yet a follower of Absalom, and was not returned to Dauid. 2. The most take it for a proper name, that he was called Cushi; Montan. Pag. with others. 3. But he was rather a Cushite, that is, an Aethiopian, as the word is taken, Ierem. 13.23. and in diuerse others places: and therefore he is afterward called the Kings seruant, v. 29. for that cursed posteritie of Cham, became seruants to Sems seede according o Noahs prophesie, Gen. 9. sic Iun. Pellic. Borrh. some thinke he might be so called of his colour, and yet an Israelite born, Vat. but the other is more probable. 18. Quest. v. 29. Whether Ahimaaz knewe not of Absaloms death. It is without question, that Ahimaaz was not ignorant of Absaloms death: for Ioab had yeilded that as a reason, v. 20. why he would not send him with the message to the King, because the kings son was dead. But Ahimaaz of purpose concealed it for these reasons. 1. Because as before he had brought heauie newes to Dauid, c. 17.20. so now he desireth to bring good newes. Bor. 2. He would not all at once tell the king of his death, least he might haue bin oppressed with grief, but leaues him in suspence, that he might by little and little digest his sonnes death. 3. Ahimaaz did it also in respect of
himselfe; for he knew that as the euil tidings is not welcome, so neither is the messen∣ger thereof accepted; like as the patient doth loath the very cup out of the which he drinketh his bitter potion. 4. By this then we are taught these points of good discre∣tion: first, that we put off the relation of euill newes to others, where we are not vr∣ged by necessitie: secondly, that when we doe tell hard newes, we should doe it by de∣grees: for many vpon the sudden report of heauie things haue presently died. Osiand. 19. Quest. v. 33. Why Dauid mourneth for Absalom. 1. Dauids naturall affection, which he could not hide, did mooue him thus to take on for his sonne; as also the consideration of Gods iust iudgment against him for his sinne: Genev. 2. As also Dauid therin saw the accomplishment of Nathans prophesie a∣gainst his house for his owne sinne: which was the cause of these great calamities: Bor. Pell. 3. He considered that Absalom died in his sinne without repentance, and there∣fore he mourneth not so much for Absaloms corporal death, as for the perill and dan∣ger of the saluation of his soule. Osiand. 20. Quest. v. 33. Why Dauid wished to die for Absalom. 1. He feared least his sonne dying in his sinne without repentance, died out of the fauour of God: his owne death he feared not, beeing assured that he should die in Gods fauour, and therefore he desired by his corporall death, that he had redeemed his sonnes life, that he might haue liued to repent him: Osiand. 2. He wished to die ra∣ther then to liue to see the miserie and calamitie, which he foresawe by Nathans pro∣phesie, was like to fall vpon his familie and posteritie: Pellic. 3. He was herein a type and figure of Christ, who offered himselfe to death for those which persecuted him: Bor. 4. The Hebrewes vainely here imagine, that Absalom by Dauids teares and pray∣ers was deliuered from hell, and taken into paradise: but no mention is here made of Dauids prayers at all: Pellic. which he would not haue omitted, if he had thought that prayers were auaileable for the dead: Osiand. nay he had shewed the contrarie, when he left praying for the child, after he knew it was dead. CHAP. 19. 1. Quest. v. 6. Of Ioabs speach to Dauid. 1. IOab much forgetteth himselfe in speaking so boldly and irreuerently to the king, otherwise then it became him: Iun. 2. And he chargeth Dauid with some vntruth: for though he loued his enemies, yet did he not hate his friends: Osian. 3. And he doth in effect vpbraid him for his former seueritie shewed to those that killed his enemies; as in slaying the Amalekite for killing Saul, and Rechab and Baanah for the death of Ishbosheth: & now thou hatest me for killing Abner before, and Absalom now: Osian. 4. True it is that we are in a certaine degree to loue our enemies, to pray for them, and to wish their amendement: but we are not so to loue them,How our ene∣mies are to be loued. but that the glorie of God and safetie of his people ought to beare a greater sway with vs; whereunto Io∣ab hath respect, and therefore wisely admonisheth the King, Bor. though somewhat more sharpely then became him. 2. Quest. v. 13. Of Dauids purpose in remoouing Ioab from beeing captaine of the hoast. 1. Some thinke that Dauid had iust cause to remooue Ioab from his place, both for that he so vnmannerly behaued himselfe in words toward him, and for that he had kil∣led Absalom contrarie to his commaundement: Iun. Osian. but neither of these was a sufficient cause, seeing Ioab in both these intended Dauids good, and the safetie of the people. 2. Wherefore the better opinion is, that Dauid herein shewed his humane affection; both because Ioab had before by his valour deserued that place, 1. Chr. 11.6. and Dauid at once here forgetteth all the benefits formerly receiued by Ioabs ser∣uice: Bor. and he did this in policie, as he did before purpose to aduance Abner for the same cause, so now he would preferre Amasa, thinking by this meanes to winne the hearts of the rest. Pell. Gen. 3. Yet seeing Dauid did many things by the instinct of Gods spirit, whereof no reason can be yeelded, we must not rashly censure his acts. Borrh.
3. Quest. v. 14. Who it was that bowed the hearts of the men of Iudah. 1. Some vnderstand it of Zadock and Abiathar, that one of them bowed the hearts of the people and perswaded them: Vatab. but the word beeing put in the singular number, cannot bee referred to them beeing two, and ioyned together in this com∣mission. 2. Some vnderstand it of Amasa, that he bowed their hearts: Pellic. 3. But it is better applyed to Dauid, that he by this friendly message and gentle speech per∣swaded them: Iun. for otherwise he needed not to haue sent Zadock and Abiathar to all the elders of Iudah, v. 11. but to Amasa onely. 4. Quest. v. 20. How Shemei came first of all the house of Ioseph, beeing of Beniamin. 1. Some by the house of Ioseph vnderstand the rest also of the tribes of Israel, who were sometime preserued by Ioseph, and therefore he was as the author and father of them: Osiand. but this is not vsuall in Scripture, by the tribe of Ioseph to vnderstand all Israel: neither did Shemei preuent all the tribes, for Iudah came before him, v. 15. 2. Some doe comprehend Beniamin vnder Ioseph, because they had both one mother: Pellic. yet were they two distinct tribes, and one was numbred with the other. 3. Some also thinke that by Ioseph he meaneth Ephraim, Manasseh, and Beniamin; because they all marched vnder Ephraims standerd, Num. 2.18. Vatab. Geneven. but that is not like: for now they did not march in that order. 4. Wherfore this is the better reading, that he came before the house of Ioseph, not first of the house: that is, though his tribe of Beniamin was situate further off from Iordan, then the tribes of Ioseph, as the king now came from Mahanaim to Iordan, yet he to expresse his dutie and ioy, came first and before them. Iun. 5. Quest. v. 23. How Dauid performed his oath made to Shemei for his life. Though Dauid afterward, 1. Kin. 2.8. gaue Salomon charge concerning Shemei, yet he broke not his oth:Reconcil. for, 1. Dauid onely sweareth concerning himselfe and his time, that he for his part would take no reuenge on him, but leaue him to the iudgement of an other: Iun. Bor. 2. He pardoned his former fault, but conditionally, that he should take heed he offended not afterward. Pelli. 3. And so indeed Salomon did not simply put him to death afterward for his sinne against his father: but for that being confined to a place, h broke the kings commandement: and so the king tooke occasion by this meanes to doe iustice vpon him. Osiand. 4. Dauid hauing himselfe vpon the confession of his fault found mercy and forgiuenes with God, doth also imitate the Lord therein, in forgiuing Shemei vpon his submission: beeing therein a type of Christ, who was readie to receiue all that came in humilitie vnto him. Borrh. 6. Quest. v. 25. Whether it be meant of Dauid or Mephibosheth, that hee came to Ierushalem. 1. Some vnderstand it of Mephibosheth, and read thus, when he was come to Ierusa∣lem, and met the King: and make this to be the meaning, when Mephibosheth being at Ierusalem had met the King: Geneven. but beside that, this were an improper speech, to say, when he was come to Ierusalem, if he did not go out of Ierusalem at all: as yet also Dauid was not come to Ierusalem, as appeareth by Barzillais speech, ver. 34. what time haue I to liue, that I should go vp with the King to Ierusalem. 2. Some other read thus, whē he came from Ierusalem: Osiand. but beside that, in this sense, an other word is here vsed iatza, to goe out, as c. 20.10. but bo, is to go in, which is the word here vsed: the phrase will not beare this sense, for the name of the place without a preposition, betokeneth to the place, as v. 34. 3. Therefore it is better vnderstood of Dauid, that when he, that is, the King was in comming to Ierusalem, Mephibosheth met him. Iun. Pellic. 7. Quest. v. 29. Why Mephibosheth saith, that they were all of Sauls familie men of death, that is, worthie to die. 1. Some referre it vnto the crueltie which Saul and his had shewed toward Dauid, in persecuting him and vsurping the kingdom: Pellic. But seeing Dauid did reuerence Saul as the Lords anointed while he liued, and would not lay his hands vpon his per∣son, nay he put to death him that vaunted he had killed Saul, 2. Sam. 1. there was no rea∣son,
that the posteritie of Saul should incurre the sentence of death, for any offence that Saul had committed. 2. Therefore it is better vnderstood of the attempt which Ishbosheth made, in holding the kingdome against Dauid. Osiand. 3. And withall Miphibosheth seemeth to haue taken part with him, and to haue beene accessarie to that cōspiracie, dwelling at that time with Machir of Ladebao beyond Iordan, where Ishbosheth remained at Mahanaim. Iun. 8. Quest. v. 29. Whether Dauid offended in diuiding Miphibosheths lands, and not restoring the whole vn∣to him. 1. The most doe accuse Dauid here of ouersight, that hearing the truth how Ziba had falsely accused Miphibosheth, doth yet award halfe of the land to that vnfaith∣full seruant: yet they doe extenuate Dauids fault, partly, because that Dauid by his Kingly authoritie might, as he saw cause reuoke and suspend that, which before hee had freely graunted to Miphibosheth: Osiand. And that Dauid maketh some part of amends, in restoring part, though not all: as also he had thereto Miphibosheths con∣sent, who was contented at the Kings pleasure to haue parted withall. Pellican. 2. Some goe yet further, and say this fact of Dauids in not restoring Miphibosheths lands knowing the truth, was much worse, then his first ouersight, in taking them a∣way vpon a false suggestion. Genevens. But that can not be, for Dauid reuoketh the former sentence, and maketh restitution, though in their opinion not fully, and ther∣fore this latter error could not be worse. 3. The Hebrewes are yet more seuere, and say, because Dauid broke his oath made to Ionathan, and diuided Miphibosheths land, that afterward his kingdome was deuided in Rehoboams time. ex Pellican. 4. But all this is surmised vpon a false ground: for Dauid doth not here make an equall diuision of the land as vnto two owners: but his meaning is, that Ziba should occu∣pie the land to halues to Miphibosheths vse, as he had appointed at the first, c. 9.10. and therefore Dauid expressely saith, I haue said, hauing relation to his first order, which he had made. And in this sense Dauid is to be vnderstood, why speakest thou any more thy words, or of thy matters: not that hee cut him short, as Borrh. but in a manner he saith, I accept of thine excuse, thou needest say no more: Iun. Some thinke, that Dauid was ouerseene, because he punished not Ziba beeing now present. But Dauid that before pardoned Shemei, no maruell if he let slip this ouersight in Ziba. 9. Quest. v. 36. Of these words: Thy seruant will goe a little way ouer Iordan, &c. 1. Some thus vnderstand the words: Thy seruant hath gone but a little ouer Iordan, and wilt thou for so small a seruice giue me so great a recompense? Iun. but this is not the meaning: for it is expressed before v. 32. what seruice Barzillai dad done to the King in maintaining and cherishing him: and hee could not be ignorant, that the King made him so freindly and franke an offer in that regard: and beside the word, iaghabor is put in the future tence, and therefore rather signifieth I will goe ouer, then, I haue gone ouer. 2. Therefore I preferre the vsuall reading, that he would goe a little with the king to bring him on his way, as before v. 31. it is said he went ouer Iordan to conduct him, and then hee would craue leaue to returne. Genevens. Vatablus, Osi∣ander. 10. Quest. v. 35. Vpon these words, Can I heare any more the voice of singing men, and singing women? 1. It seemeth that in Dauids Court, while the King was at dinner, that hee had musicke played before him, and sung, both with voices, and vpon instruments: Osian. 2. Which although it was not commanded, yet was it tolerable and permitted: Pellic. and there is no doubt, but that there is a commendable vse of Musicall harmonie euen for recreation and delight: for as it is lawfull to feed other senses, as the tast, not one∣ly with the sauour of necessarie food, but also with pleasant rellishing for repast, as Isaak longed to haue wild flesh, (which we call venison) to be prepared for his tast: so also we may please the other senses, as of hearing,Of the abuse▪ and likewise lawfull vse of musique. so that all things be done in mea∣sure and sobrietie. 3. Musicke may be abused, and that two waies, either to supersti∣tion, as in adoring and countenancing Idolatrie, as the King of Babel set forth his a∣bominable
Idol, Dan. 3. withall kind of instruments of Musicke: or to wantonnesse, as the Prophet reprooueth the people, because the harpe, viole, timbrel, and pipe were in their feasts, Isai. 5.12. so also Amos, 6.5. There is also a commendable vse of Musicke, either to vse it to the glorie of God; as Dauid brought the Arke to Ierushalem with the sound and harmonie of all kind of instruments, 2. Sam. 6.5. or else for honest re∣creation either in feasts or otherwise, as Salomon yet remaining in his wisedome had men-singers and women-singers, Eccles. 2.8. 4. But this libertie which Dauid had is not to be vrged too farre, to patronize the licentious vse of Musicke: they which here∣in alleadge the example of Dauid, let them also imitate him in his patience and meek∣nesse in aduersitie and affliction. Pellic. 11. Quest. v. 40. Of the halfe part of the people of Israel, which were with Dauid. 1. Some read, not halfe the people of Israel, but, a part of the people of Israel, Iun. but the word chatzi is vsually taken for the halfe part, as c. 18.2. though half of vs were slain: and in many other places. 2. Therefore the vsuall reading is rather to be followed, the halfe of the people: Chald. as the Sep. also read, : so also the rest of the Inter∣preters. 3. Yet the precise halfe is not to be vnderstood, but onely a part: that whereas Iudah wholly was with King Dauid, yet Israel but in part, in regard either of Iudah, or the rest of Israel, which were not yet come: and this part of Israel, were they which held with Dauid, and fell not from him, and such as were now come and reconciled to him, as the thousand of Beniamin that came with Shemei. Iun. Vatab. 12. Quest. v. 44. Of the contention betweene the men of Israel and of Iudah about Dauid. 1. Whereas they which before had left and forsaken the King, doe now striue, which should be the most forward in bringing him againe: beside the inconstancie and leuitie of the people here to be noted, Gods prouidence is to be considered in swaying the affections of the people toward Dauid, which were of late estraunged from him with so great hostilitie, that Dauid might acknowledge that his state and kingdome depended onely vpon God. Pellican. 2. The men of Iudah alleadge two reasons in their defense, both because they were nearer in kinred to Dauid, then the Israelites, and for that their affection was more sincere: for they respected not their owne profit, neither were hired or waged to doe that they did, but came of a dutifull mind, v. 42. the men of Israel stood partly vpon their number, they were tenne for one, partly vpon the prioritie of their counsell, they first made the motion to bring backe the king, v. 11. 3. The men of Iudah were sharper in words, then the men of Israel, both being confident vpon their cause, (as hauing the better part) and the kings fauour, Osiand. as beeing emboldened with the guard of Dauids souldiers, called his men, v. 41. Iun. But this their insolent speach toward Israel, and the neglecting of them, bread a greater inconuenience afterward, and gaue occasion of falling away a∣gaine to the Israelites, as the next Chapter sheweth. CHAP. 20. 1. Quest. v. 1. What mooued Shebah to entise Israel to leaue Dauid. 1. THe former contention betweene Israel and Iudah ministred occasion thereof, because they of Iudah challenged the king to be peculiar to themselues, and therefore Shebah saith, as from their mouth, and in their words, wee haue no part in Dauid, as they would beare vs in hand. Vatab. 2. The old and inveterate hatred and en∣uie betweene Sauls house, of the which it seemeth this Shebah was, and Iudah, did stir him vp to this mischiefe. Borrh. 3. As also his owne ambition, thinking, if they could shake off Dauids yoke, to be King himselfe in his stead: Osiander. 4. As also the peo∣ple grew wearie of the Kingly gouernment, and sought for libertie. Pellican.
2. Quest. v. 3. Of the shutting vp of Dauids Concu∣bines. 1. Dauid inflicteth a treble punishment vpon them, for yeelding to the incestuous lust of Abshalom; for they should rather haue died, then condescended vnto him: first they are sequestred and shut vp from all company, that none should come at them least beeing seene abroad, the memorie of that vncleane fact should haue beene there∣by reuiued. Borrh. Secondly, Dauid doth forbeare their companie, because it was not fit, after they were defiled by his sonne, that they should haue accesse to him.Of . Osiand. Thirdly, they are enioyned this penance of widowhood during life, that they might lament and repent them of their sinne. Pellican. 2. Some thinke, that because it is added, in widowhood for life, that they continued in widowes estate onely during the life of Dauid: Vatabl. and so hee distinguisheth, betweene viduitatem vitae, widowhood of life, and viduitatem mortis, widowhood of death, that is, after the husbands death: so also the Chalde, they were called widdowes, viri superstitis, of the husband yet suruiuing. But it is euident rather by the text, that they were thus enclosed and sequestred vnto the day of their death. Iun. 3. Yet Dauid nourished and kept them with all things necessarie, because he con∣sidered, that they were forced thereunto: Osiand. Ioseph. But yet Dauid should as well or rather haue punished those, which were either causes, or cōsenters to this disgrace: of which number. Amasa was one, who beeing then a cheife man about Abshalom, was contented he should follow Achitophels wicked counsell, and was himselfe a be∣holder of it. Pellican. 3. Quest. Issuing out of the former, Whether perpetuall widdow∣hood or virginitie may be inflicted, or enioyned. 1. That a man is not bound to render the matrimoniall debt, where the faith of wedlocke is broken, by any adulterous or incestuous act, it is cleare by the example of Iacob, who is thought not to haue companied with Billah after Ruben had com∣mitted incest with her: for Iacob saith his bed was defiled, Gen. 49.3. Borrh. So also Dauid vpon iust cause refrained from the companie of those concubines. 2. But it is an harder question, whether the husband or the Magistrate may enioyne vnto the offending wife perpetuall widdowhood after the husbands death: which I rather en∣cline to thinke ought not to be for these reasons. 1. Because the husband hath no longer power ouer his wife, then while he liueth; as the Apostle sheweth, Rom. 7.2. If the man be dead, shee is deliuered from the power of the man. 2. Againe, this were to denie vnto the weake partie the remedie against fornica∣tion, which is marriage, and so they might be occasioned to liue in sinne still: and therefore the Apostle alloweth euery woman to haue her husband, 1. Cor. 7. c. 3. It is against nature to inhibite the procreation of children, in restraining women from marriage apt for procreation: these two latter reasons are vrged by the law of Iustini∣an, made on the behalfe of widdowes, not to be enioyned widdowhood:Cod lib. 6. tit. 42. leg. . cum mli∣eres ad hoc natura progenuerit, vt partus ederent, & maxima eis cupiditas in hoc constituta est: seeing nature to this end hath bred women to bring forth children, and there is in them a great desire thereunto. 3. Herein the Ciuill law seemeth to be more equall, then the Canons, which decree thus: Adultera non nubat, etiamsi mortuus fuerit vir eius, &c. the adulteresse shall not marrie no not when her husband is dead, but doe penance all the daies of her life: Caus. 32. qu. 7. c. 22. likewise, if a man had lien with his wiues sister, they did both permanere sine spe coniugij, continue without hope of marriage: Ibid. c. 23. so was it also decreed in the Triburian counsell, that if one lay with his mother in law, neu∣ter ad coniugium peruenire potest: neither of them can come to marriage: Ibid. c. 29. But the Apostle enioyned no such thing to the incestuous young man, that had taken his fathers wife, 1. Cor. 5.1. but onely tooke a course that he should be brought to re∣pentance. Likewise the imperiall constitution ordained, that, if a man gaue a legacie to his wife, vpon condition she should not marrie, that she would enioy the gift, al∣though she did marrie: and in the same imperiall constitution, the Iulian law is repea∣led,
that gaue the widow libertie to marrie againe, taking an oath, that she did it for procreation sake: the law saith, tale iuramentū conquiescat, & lex Iulia cedat, &c. such an oath shall cease, and the Iulian law giue place: and libertie is there giuen, for the wid∣dow without taking such oath, to betake her to second marriage. 4. But the example of Iepthah is vrged, that according to the opinion of the most and best Interpreters, did consecrate his daughter to perpetuall virginitie: to the which it is answered, first that Iepthah in so doing shewed himselfe ignorant of the law, which alloweth the redemption both of male and female for money, Leuit. 27.4. and therefore Iepthah saying he could not goe backe, declareth his ignorance of the lawe in that point: secondly, Iepthahs daughter herein consented to her father, to become a votarie and perpetuall virgin vnto God, so that it was voluntarie in her, and not compulsiue. 5. And touching this example of Dauid, in sequestring his concubines during their life: these considerations are to be weighed. 1. That men had greater power then o∣uer their wiues then now: for Moses, as our Sauiour saith, for the hardnesse of heart allowed them to make a bill of diuorcement. 2. There is a difference betweene a wife and a concubine: that may be enioyned a concubine, which is not to be imposed vp∣on a wife: the one beeing as free, the other bound. 3. This was a particular and spe∣ciall case concerning the King: these concubines offended two wayes, both in com∣mitting incest, and in violating the Maiestie of the King: for both which they were worthie of death: wherein though Dauid shewed them clemencie, yet it was fit that otherwise an example should be made of them. 4. The women themselues were asha∣med to be seene abroad, but it seemeth were contented to lead a priuate life, and so to be sequestred from the world during their life. 4. Quest. v. 6. Whom Dauid meaneth (speaking to Abishai) by thy Lords seruants. 1. Some thinke that Dauid calleth Amasa, Abishai his Lord, because he was assig∣ned now to be the Captaine of the host, as Vriah calleth Ioab his Lord, c. 11.11. Iun. But, although Dauid had purposed to preferre Amasa to Ioabs place, yet now seeing Amasa to be slacke, and so suspecting his fidelitie, Dauid had no reason to giue him such honour: neither was Ioab yet actually displaced, for the souldiers yet are called Ioabs men, v. 7. 2. Rather Dauid vnderstandeth Ioab the Captaine of the host: Genev. but that is not so like, for he was Abishai his brother: and at that time Abishai had the charge of the armie, and therefore in that behalfe Ioab can not be said to be his Lord. 3. Therefore Dauid rather meaneth himselfe, that Abishai should take his ser∣uants, Osiand. which are before, c. 19.41. called Dauids men. 5. Quest. v. 8. How Ioab commeth to be mentioned, that went not out with the host. 1. Iosephus is deceiued, who saith that Dauid spake vnto Ioab, when he saw that Amasa came not: for it is euident by the text, v. 6. that Dauid spake to Abishai, be∣cause he had taken a displeasure against Ioab, and purposed to remooue him. 2. Ther∣fore it is like, that Ioab, though Dauid bid him not, did voluntarily goe with his bro∣ther to assist him, partly for loue vnto his people and to the King, whom he saw to be in present daunger by this rebellion of Shebah, Pellican. partly, that hee might in∣sinuate himselfe by his diligence into the Kings fauour, to retaine his place still. Osi∣ander. 6. Quest. v. 8. Why Ioabs sword was loose in the sheath. 1. Iosephus thinketh that Ioabs sword beeing loose in the scabberd fell to the ground, and hee tooke it vp, as thinking nothing, and so smote Amasa: but if it had beene so, Amasa seeing him take vp his sword, might haue doubted somewhat, where∣as now he tooke no heed to the sword, v. 10. 2. Some read, that this was the vse at other times, that as Ioab went, his sword fell out, Genevens. but that is not like: for then it would haue beene a great let vnto Ioab in his marching. 3. Therefore it seemeth by the text, that Ioab at this time onely did so hang his sword, that when hee would it might of it selfe fall out, that he might draw it forth readily and with ease, and with∣out
noise. Iun. Vatab. Osiand. 7. Quest. v. 10. Of the murther of Amasa. 1. Though this iudgement of God was iust vpon Amasa, because hee had ioyned with Abshlom rebelliously against his father: yet Ioab therein committed a most hainous sinne. Pellican. 2. These three circumstances exaggerate Ioabs sinne: first, the time considered, now they were in pursuite of the common enemie, but between them there was freindship and peace: secondly, in regard of their persons: Amasa and Io∣ab were sisters sonnes, and Amasa had beene sent forth about the kings affaires: Borr. thirdly, in respect of Ioabs affection: it was his ambition, that mooued him before to kill Abner, and now Amasa after the same treacherous manner, who, he feared, were like to thrust him out of office. Osiand. 8. Quest. v. 11. Of the meaning of these words, Whosoeuer is well affected toward Ioab, &c. let him goe after Ioab. 1. Some vnderstand these words of Amasa, and make this to be the sense, behold him, that would be vnto Dauid for Ioab: Lat. that is, which sought to displace Ioab, and to be preferred before him. Pellican. But the words will not beare this sence: for the text is, hee which is well affected, or well pleased in Ioab: chaphetz: which could not be said of Amasa, that hated Ioab: againe, the other word is, after, not for Ioab: acharee. 2. Some make this young man, that stood by Amasa, to insult ouer him, and to wish that whosoeuer sought to vndermine Ioab, and put him beside his office should be ser∣ued as Amasa was: Osiand. neither can this sense be admitted for the former reasons. 3. Therefore the true meaning is: that this young man beeing appointed by Ioab, as it is like, to stand by Amasa, Genevens. by this reason perswaded the people, to goe after Ioab, as they fauoured him, and wished well to Dauid, and not to stand gazing there; Vatab. Iun. And therefore when he saw the people to stand still for all this, he remooued Amasa out of the way, as it followeth in the next verse. 9. Quest. v. 14. Of the Citie Abel and Bethmaacah. 1. Some take these to be two cities, but yet neere together, Borrh. Genevens. 2. Some take Bethmaacah to be the name of the countrie or region where Abel was si∣tuate, Osiand. 3. But they seeme rather both to be names of one citie, as may appeare by these reasons. 1. In the next verse it is called Abel Bethmaacah, without any thing comming betweene. 2. It is named Abelmaim, 1. Chron. 6.4. which somewhat re∣sembleth this name Abelmaacah. 3. This was a towne of Manasseh, and Maacah was the wife of Machir of Manasseh, 1. Chron. 7.16. so it seemeth, that it was called after her name, for distinction sake from other cities hight also Abel: Iun. 4. Iosephus is of he same opinion, who calleth it by one name, Abelmachra. 10. Quest. v. 14. Of the meaning of these words, and all Beerim. 1. Some take Beerim to be a region in the vpper or higher Galile, where Abel was situate. Borrh. 2. Some take it to be the name of certaine places which Shebah went thorough, Vatab. Chald. Genevens. 3. Some thinke, that though it be last named, yet Shebah went first thorough these places in Beniamin before he came to Abel. 3. But hee meaneth rather the inhabitants of the citie Berath, which was in Beniamin, Iosh. 18.25. Iun. and this sense is confirmed by the next words following, who gathe∣red together and followed him: that is, the Bercans, beeing of his tribe, and it may be of the same citie, did take part with him. 11. Quest. v. 15. Of these words, hee cast vp a banke. 1. Iunius readeth in the cleane contrarie sense: strauit aggerem, hee laied flat the banke: the word is shaphach, which signifieth to poure out, or vulad: and so when the ground was made plaine, they came to batter the wall. 2. But I preferre the com∣mon reading: effuderunt aggerem, and of the Chald. acervârunt aggerem, they ast vp, or heaped vp a banke: so A.P.V.C. and my reasons are these. 1. Because of the words following; it, 1. the citie stood entrenched, or with a trench or rampire: which was the rampire or banke, which they had raised against it. 2. The same phrase which the Sep∣tuagint
here vse, , they cast vp a trench, is taken in the same sense, Luk. 19.43. , they shall cast vp a trench against thee. 3. Because this was the manner of besieging cities, to cast vp mounts against them: and from their mounts to cast engines with ropes, whereof mention is made, c. 17.13. to shake the walls: which course it is like Ioab tooke here; because they beganne to shake and pull downe the wall, as the end of the verse sheweth. 12. Quest. v. 15. Of the meaning of these words, it stood with a rampire. 1. Some doe read, in the plurall number, they stood vpon the rampire, and vnder∣stand it of the people of the citie, that they stood vpon the bulwork or rampire to defend it: Pag. Geneuens. But it seemeth by the treatie of the women, that th citizens did not vse any force against Ioab, but expected that conditions of peace should haue bin first propounded them, and the rampire or bulworke beeing without the wall: for so the word signifieth praemunitionem, a premunition or bulwork before: how could the people leaue the wall to keepe the bulwork? for i is like (and so thinkeh Iosephus) that the citie gates were shut against Ioab. 2. Some vnderstand it of Ioabs men, that they stood in the trench, and came neere to assaile the wall: Osiand. But the word is both in the singular number, and of the feminine gender, and so can not agree to the men or people. 3. Some applie it to the woman, that she stood vpon the rampire or wall, and from thence spake to Ioab: Vatab. but it is not like that the woman stood there, before Io∣abs men beganne to batter the wall, as the next words shew they did. 4. Therefore, it is most fitly referred to the citie, not that it did stand alone with a wall, without a rampire, as Iun. for the word eheel signifieth not a wall, but the rampire or bulworke before the wall: as Isai. 26.1. Lament. 2.8. But the citie stood now en∣trenched, and enuironed with this trench or rampire: as the Septuag. : and the Latine giueth this sense well, obsessa est vrbs, the Citie beganne thus to be assaulted. 13. Quest. v. 18. Of these words, They spake in the beginning, saying, aske of Abel. 1. Some thus expound it: in this citie of Abel haue beene in times past excellent men for wisedome, whom they were wont to resort vnto for counsell: wilt thou then destroi such a famous citi? Osiand. But this is not so fit: it is better referred to the oblation of peace, first to be made when a citie was besieged according to the lawe, Deut. 20.10. and therefore the woman saith in the next verse, I am one of those that are peaceable, that is, which will not refuse the offer and order of peace. 2. Some read thus, they spake in old time, saying, aske of Abel, Genevens. It was said in the old Proverb, Lat. and the Chalde thus expoundeth, Remember what is written in the law, that they vsed of old time, to aske a citie, &c. to the same effect Pellic. Borrh. but seeing there is particular mention made of Abel, it seemeth that no such proverb is here insinuated, though reference be had to the law. 3. Therefore, they which thus spake in the beginning (as the word signifieth, and as the Septuag. read) rather then of old, were the Citizens of Abel, that thus commu∣ned and consulted among themselues, that Ioab would first offer vnto the citie peace, to see if it would be accepted. Iun. 14. Quest. v. 23. Of Ioabs restitution to his office. 1. It is neither like, that Ioab was absolutely restored vnto his place, which Dauid had promised to Amasa, because of his valiant exploits, Pellican. for Dauid did altoge∣ther mislike him for those two bloodie murthers of Abner and Amasa. 2. Neither yet as Iun. did he improbè recuperare, wickedly recouer his place of gouernment against Dauids mind altogether: for Dauid could not spare him. 3. But Dauid was content hee should retaine his place, because his seruice was so necessarie: not clearing him of his due deserued punishment, but onely deferred it. Osiand.
CHAP. 21. 1. Quest. v. 1. Of the time when this famine was sent vpon the land. 1. THe generall opinion is, that this famine followed immediately after those ciuill warres ended with Absalom and Sheba: bella fame excipiuntur, the warres en∣ded with famine: Borrh. so also Pellican, with others: but that this cannot be, is eui∣dent by that place. c. 15.7. where Absaloms rebellion falleth out toward the end of the fortieth yeare: which must be vnderstood of the raigne of Dauid, as hath been shew∣ed in that place: for Dauid raigned but 40. yeares in all: but by this account, if the three yeares famine followed after Absaloms rebellion, Dauid must haue raigned 43. yeares and aboue. 2. This is the onely doubt, how all these things set downe in this booke from c. 15. to c. 21. could fall out in so short a time, in the ende of the fortieth yeare of Dauids raigne: But this may easily bee answered: for Absaloms rebellion continued not long, and immediately vpon that followed the rebellion of Shebah: so that all these things might very well fall out in the compasse of not many moneths. 3. So then the more probable opinion is, that these stories of the three yeares famine, c. 21. and of numbring the people, c. 24. are transposed; as the like is apparant in the 3. last chapters of the booke of the Iudges; the order of time then is not obserued, in the setting downe of these histories: for the Scripture rather respecteth the coherence of the matter and argument, then the consequence of time: sic fere Iunius. 2. Quest. v. 1. How Dauid sought the face of Iehouah. 1. The Chalde paraphrast by the face, vnderstandeth the mercies of the Lord, be∣cause mercie and clemencie sheweth it selfe in the face. 2. Some doe read, that Dauid sought the Lord: Vatab. Geneuens. but to seeke the face of the Lord, is somewhat more then to seeke the Lord. 3. Some, he consulted with the oracle of God: Latin. expressing the sense in part, but not wholly: for beside that he receiued answer from the oracle of God, he went to the place of his presence. 4. Iosephus thinketh that Dauid consul∣ted with God by the Prophets, and by them receiued an answer. 5. But it is rather to be vnderstood not of that extraordinarie reuelation by Prophets, but of the ordina∣rie meanes, which was prescribed to aske counsell by, which was by the high Priest, who gaue iudgement by his Vrim; as the Lord himselfe appointeth, Numb. 27.21. Iun. Osiand. 3. Quest. Wherefore this famine was sent, and of the causes thereof. 1. Although this famine was caused by drought, as is euident, v. 10. that Rizpah tooke this as a signe, that the wrath of God was appeased, when the raine fell: yet Dauid considereth an other ouerruling cause, the prouidence of God, and therefore he resorteth vnto him by prayer: so faithfull men doe see further into the cause of Gods iudgements, then naturall and worldly wise men commonly doe: Borrh. 2. The cause which procured this punishment, was for the great iniustice and crueltie shew∣ed vpon the Gibeonites, whom Saul oppressed contrarie to the oath made vnto them by Ioshua, Iosh. 9. 3. Beside, herein God punished the people also for their sinne: they for their thrice rebelling against Dauid their lawfull gouernour, once vnder Ish∣bosheth, againe vnder Absalom, thirdly in conspiring with Shebah, suffer three years famine: Pellic. and by this meanes also the Lord taketh occasion to cut off the posteri∣tie of Saul, least they might still haue practised against Dauids house and kingdome, which the Lord had promised should continue: Borrh. 5. So then by this example we see that famine is sent as a iust punishment of sinne: as in Germanie for gluttonie, and drunkennesse; in Italie for filthie and vncleane lust: as also that sometime for the sinne of one wicked man, many temporally are punished. Osiand.
4. Quest. v. 1. Why, and at what time Saul slew the Gibeonites. 1. Some thinke that he slewe them of malice against the Priests, when they were put to the sword in Nob; because the Gibeonites were seruants to the Tabarnacle, for the cleauing of wood and drawing of water; but he is said to doe it of zeale, vers. 5. therefore not of malice, and consequently not then, nor at that time: Iun. 2. Some thinke, that he did it of zeale to the Israelites, to conuay vnto them the inheritance, lands, and possessions of the Gibeonites, that they might haue more commodious dwelling: Vatab. Osiand. but this had beene rather of a couetous minde, then of zeale. 3. Some thinke that his zeale was herein, because they had in Ioshuahs time consened and deceiued the Elders of Israel, therefore he would be reuenged of them now: Borr. But it is not like, that after so long a time he would punish them for that error which Ioshuah and the Elders of Israel then pardoned; when it was first committed, and fresh in memorie. 4. Therefore it is more probable, that when Saul of zeale did ex∣pell sorcerers and witches out of Israel, that vnder that pretence, because the Gen∣tiles and Cananites were giuen to such deuillish studies, he also sought to root out the Gibeonites, who were a remnant of the Cananites and Amorites: especially for that they were charged to root out the Cananites from among them: Iun. 5. By the which we learne, that zeale without knowledge, and a good intention without warrant from Gods word, is not acceptable vnto God. Borrh. 5. Quest. v. 2. How the Gibeonites are said to be a remnant of the Amorites. These Gibeonites were properly Hiuites, Iosh. 9.7. but here they are called Amo∣rites.Reconcil. 1. Some thinke, that by the figure Synechdoche, one part is taken for an other: Iun. 2. Others thinke, that all the Cananites were in generall called Amorites: Perer. 3. But it is more likely, that because the Cananites were mingled together, and the Amorites were the more valiant people, that the rest had the denomination from thē as the more principall: as Gen. 15.16. the wickednesse of the Amorites is not yet full: where the rest of the Cananites are vnderstood by the Amorites, as the more principall part: Mercer. So aso Ezech. 16.2. the Prophet saith, thy kinred is of the land of Canaan, thy father was an Amorite, thy mother an Hittite: by the which it is euident, that the seue∣rall nations of the Cananites were mixed together, and ioyned in affinitie, and the A∣morite as the predominant. And further, it seemeth that the Amorites and Hivites did more specially commerce and conuerse together; as Iacob speaking of Shechem, saith he got it out of the hand of the Amorite, Gen. 48.22. whereas pecularly it did belong to Hemor, who was an Hiuite, Gen. 34.2. as there the Hiuite is named to be an Amorite, so also in this place. 6. Quest. v. 3. Of the meaning of these words, That yee may blesse. 1. The most read in the second person, that ye may blesse, C.S.L.P.B.G. but the word, if it be taken in the preter tense, must needes bee of the third person, barachu, that they may blesse: and so Iun. readeth, expounding it of Dauids consulting with himselfe: But because it is euident by the answer which the Gibeonites make imme∣diately, v. 4. that all this which Dauid saith belongeth to the question: I subscribe rather to Montanus reading, who turneth in the first future or imparatiue, saying, blesse yee. 2. Which blessing is vnderstood occasionaliter, that by their occasion beeing con∣tented and satisfied, God may shew himselfe appeased: Iun. as also, because the pray∣ers and desires of the afflicted are verie auayleable both wayes, either by way of com∣plaint, Exod. 23.17. or by way of blessing, the blessing of him that was readie to perish came vpon me, Iob 29.13. Osiand. And in that the Gibeonites which were Gentiles, here blesse and pray for Israel, it is an euident type of the calling of the Gentiles: Pel∣lican. and that the Lord would be entreated by the beleeuing Gentiles, to receiue the Iewes againe in the end of the world to grace and fauour. Borrh. 7. Quest. v. 6. How it standeth with Gods iustice to punish Sauls sonne for their fathers sinne. 1. Not onely Saul, but Sauls house is said to bee bloodie, vers. 1. therefore seeing
euen Sauls posteritie did beare the like bloodie minde, as it appeared in their taking part with Ishbosheth: for the which cause Mephibosheth confessed they were all wor∣thie to die, c. 19.29. it was iust that they, not so much for their fathers sinne, as their owne should be punished: as the Lord threateneth to visit the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children, vnto the third and fourth generation, Exod. 34.7. 2. Further, in temporall chasticements it is not vniust with God to punish the sinnes of the parents in the children: both because euerie man hath sufficient matter in himselfe in respect both of his originall and actuall sinnes for Gods temporall iudgements to worke vp∣on: and for that by the example of such corrections vpon the posteritie of the wicked other receiue admonition, to take heede least by their sinne they bring the curse of God vpon them, and their seede: Osiand. 3. And this was beside a peculiar case in the Gibeonites, that as Saul had wasted their generation, so hi posteritie should be con∣sumed and wasted: Osiand. and to this ende it was fit that some should be made an ex∣ample, that the Gibeonites might liue in more safetie and securitie afterward. Pellic. 8. Quest. v. 6. Of these words, O elect of Iehouah. 1. The most doe vnderstand them of Saul: in Gibeah of Saul the chosen of the Lord, who they say is so called, because hee was sometime chosen and elected of God for their king: Vatab. Osiand. Lat. Genevens. But it seemeth improperly to be referred to Saul, for these two reasons: both because the Lord had giuen sentence of Saul: that he had taken away his mercie from him, as he would not take it from Salomon, and that he had put him away before him, c. 7.15. As also in this place, Saul and his house are charged to be bloody, v. 1. and this title cannot agree to him, to be chosen of God, and yet he and his posteritie to stand vnder Gods curse. 2. Therefore it is more perti∣nently applyed to Dauid, and so is it to be reade in the vocatiue case, O thou elect of God: Iun. for Dauid was elect of God, both in respect of the kingdome, in his owne person, who was chosen and Saul refused; and in his posteritie, with whom the king∣dome is promised to remaine for euer: as also in respect of the Messiah, of whom Da∣uid was a figure, and in him eternally elected. 9. Quest. v. 8. Of these words, He tooke the fiue sonnes of Michol whom she bare to Adriel the sonne of Barzillai, &c. It is certaine, that not Michol, but her sister Merab the elder daughter of Saul was married to this Adriel, 1. Sam. 18.19. Michol was giuen to Phaltiel, 1. Sam. 25.44. nei∣ther had Michol any child at all to her dying day, 2. Sam. 6.23.Reconci▪ Wherefore to recon∣cile this place, 1. Some thinke that Michol is put for her sister Merab, Geneuens. and that in the Hebrew text Merab should be read for Michol: Osiand. But this were dan∣gerous to admit an error in the originall, and would giue occasion of great boldnes for men where they doubt to chop and change the text. 2. Others therefore do think that Michol brought vp these children as her owne (hauing no children) and there∣fore they are said to be hers: so the Chalde, to whom subscribe Pellic. Borrh. But be∣cause she is said to beare them to Adriel, which phrase signifieth alwaies in Scripture to bring forth, not to bring vp, this interpretation cannot be admitted. 3. Therefore the best solution is, that here must be supplyed, the word sister, to read it thus, and the fiue sonnes of the sister of Michol: for it it is vsuall for such words of agnation, as of si∣ster, brother, sonne, to be ecclipsed in the curt Hebrew speach, as v. 19. of this chapter Elhanah is said to haue slaine Goliah the Gittite, where the word brother is to be sup∣plyed: he slew Lahmi the brother of Goliah, 1. Chron. 20.1. Iun. so Ierem. 32.7. Ha∣naneel is called Ieremiahs vnckles sonne, but v. 12. his vncle, where sonne must bee supplyed. 10. Quest. v. 9. Of the time when these seuen sonnes of Sauls house were hanged. 1. It is agreed, that according to the text, that they were put to death in the be∣ginning of haruest, in the barley haruest, which was the first, Vatab. which fell out in the moneth Abib or Nisan: Genev. which was about the time of the Pasch, when they first put the sicle into the corne, Deut 16.9. Iun. 2. But how long their bodies there hanged, is vncertain: there are some that think their bodies there continued from
Monah vnto September, which was the vsuall moneth for raine; ex Borrh. But it is not like that their bodies continued so long vnburied, for these two reasons: 1. Be∣cause after iustice was executed vpon them, the wrath of God was appeased, and therefore the Lord not long after by sending raine, declared that he was satisfied. 2. Againe, it is like, seeing that this was an extraordinarie president, that it had an extra∣ordinarie effect: and that therefore God did extraordinarily send raine, before the v∣suall time, to testifie how well he was pleased with this course of iustice which Da∣uid had taken. 3. They were then hanged vpon an hill, to be a spectacle to all to take heede how they shed innocent blood: Borrh. And they hung in the sight of all the labourers and workemen in the field (it beeing now haruest time) to shew that God would not suffer crueltie and oppression to goe vnpunished. Osiand. 11. Quest. v. 10. Why Rizpah tooke sackecloath. 1. Some thinke that she put on the sackecloath to shew her mourning, and to en∣treate the Lord by her supplications and prayers: Pellic. But the phrase, that she spread it for her vpon the rocke, sheweth that shee did not vse it as a garment vpon her owne flesh. 2. Others thinke that she spread it vpon the corpses of her sonnes, and so kept the birds and beasts from them: Borrh. but it is said she spread it vpon the rocke, not vpon the bodies: and it seemeth by the words following, vntill water dropped vpon them from heauen, that the bodies lay in the open ayre. 3. Therefore it is more like, that she of the sackecloath spread her a tent in the rocke next adioyning, to defend her from heate, and to testifie withall her mourning, and the better night and day to watch the corpes. Vatab. Osiand. 12. Quest. v. 10. Whether it were not against the law that the bodies of Rizpahs sonnes hang so long vnburied. It is written, Deut. 21.23. that the bodies of those which were hanged should not tarie there all night, but be buried the same day. 1. Some giue this solution, that this lawe did onely bind the Hebrewes, and not the Gibeonites: Osiand. but that is not like,Reconcil. for the Proselytes of the Gentiles that were conuerted to their religion, were bound to the same lawes, Exod. 12.49. 2. Therefore I thinke rather, that as this was reuealed to Dauid by extraordinarie reuelation from God; so they had also speciall direction, that the bodies should hang till God should shew himselfe to be well plea∣sed: which may appeare by this, that Rispah waited till the raine came, which she knew by the oracle of God giuen to Dauid, to be a signe that God was appeased: sic Pellican. Borrh. Iun. 13. Quest. v. 16. Of Harapha the father of Ishibenob. 1. The most thinke, and so read, that Harapha was the proper name of the gyant, father vnto those fowre gyants here named: Ar. Pag. Lat. 2. But it seemeth rather to be a common name, signifying a gyant, as the Chald. and Sept. sic Iun. Vatab. as Deut. 2.20. the Zamzummims are called Rephaim Gyants. 3. There was then yet remai∣ning a generation of those gyants, and men of great stature, that were before the flood: as Plinie also writeth, that in his time he sawe a man called Gabbara, brought out of Arabia, vnder the Empire of Claudius, who was 9. foot and nine inches high: he hath also a stranger report of a man found in Creta, in the opening of a monument by an earthquake, that was 46. cubites long: ex Borrh. And as some men exceede in stature, so others haue beene found as little, as Borrh. in the same place maketh menti∣on of a perfit man, that was but a cubite, that is, halfe a yard high, that was carried a∣bout in a parrets cage. 4. But let it be further obserued, that these gyants for the most part, were found among the vncircumcised nations, that were enemies to Gods peo∣ple, both that God might shew his power in beating downe the pride of such as vaun∣ted themselues in their owne strength, and that his owne people should not haue any confidence in flesh and blood. 5. Beside herein Dauid was a type of Christ, who en∣countred with the spirituall gyants, the principallities and powers of darkenes. Borr. 14. Quest. v. 18. Of the place Ghob, where the Phili∣stims fought. 1. Some doe corruptly read Nob, for Ghob: Sept. Vatab. Osiand. but seeing in the
next verse, they doe retaine the name Ghob, they had no reason to change it here. 2. Some thinke, that this place had two names, that it was called both Ghob,Reconcil. and Ge∣zer: Pellic. Bor. Genev. and therefore is this battell said to haue been in Gezer, 1. Chr. 20.4. 3. But it is more like, that this place called Ghob, was neere vnto Gezer, and therefore, in that place it is said, the battell was in Gezer. Iun. 15. Qust. v. 19. Whether Elhanan killed Goliah. 1. Some think, that this Goliah was an other gyant of the same name, that the gyant was whom Dauid killed: Osiand. but it appeareth 1. Chron. 20.4. that his name was not Goliah, but Lahmi. 2. Some vnderstand it of Dauid, that he killed Goliah: so the Chalde paraphrast. and the Latine interpreter seemeth somewhat to fauour that fansie reading for Elhanan, Adeodatus, that is, one giuen of God, that it might bee applyed to Dauid: but this cannot be so;Reconcil. for this battell was after the battell wherein Abishai rescued Dauid, & the other Goliah was slaine in Dammim, 1. Sam. 17.1. this in Ghob. 3. Therefore here must be supplyed the word brother, as it is explaned 1. Chron. 20. 4. that Elhanan killed the brother of Goliah: Iun. see before, v. 8. 16. Quest. v. 22. How these giants are said to haue beene slaine by the hand of Dauid. 1. Some vnderstand it of Dauids beeing present in the battell, and so that which was done by his seruants is said to be done by him: as the exploit of the souldiers is ascribed to the captaine: Osiand. But this interpretation cannot stand, because before this, ver. 17. in a battell with the Philistims, when Dauid was in daunger, it was agre∣ed, that he should goe no more to battell. 2. Therefore all these gyants must be here comprehended, that are here named, and so also Goliah, though not now slaine, yet here named, who was indeed slaine by the hand of Dauid. CHAP. 22. 1. Quest. v. 1. Of the song of Dauid in generall. 1. THis Psalme which Dauid here singeth vnto God after all his great deliuerāces, is inserted also into the booke of the Psalmes, and is in number the eighteenth, sauing that this difference there is, thse words are prefixed in the 18. Psalme: I will loue thee dearely, O Lord my strength, v. 1. which are omitted here, Osiand. 2. And as Dauid was a type of Christ, so many things in this Psalme are to bee vnderstood of Christ: for here he prophesieth of the passion, resurrection, ascension of Christ, of the reiection of the Iewes, and the calling of the Gentiles: as the Apostle, Rom. 15.9. alleadgeth the 49. vers. of this Psalme, I will praise thee among the nations, &c. to proue the vocation of the Gentiles: Osiand. 3. But there may be a double errour committed in the interpretation of this Psalme: if either all be historically applied to Dauid, or all mystically vnderstood of Christ: therefore what is historically set downe, must be historically applyed to Dauid, and what is figuratiuely vttered, must bee also figura∣tiuely expounded of the Messiah. Borrh. 2. Quest. v. 1. Of these words, and out of the hand of Saul. 1. Some read thus, out of the hands of mine enemies, as out of the hand of Saul: Iun. But seeing he maketh mention of all his enemies, out of the hand of all mine ene∣mies: Saul cannot bee brought in as an stance, for he was not all his enemies. 2. Therefore the vsuall reading is better, and out of the hand of Saul: who is specially na∣med, because he was his most speciall aduersarie: both because that persecution was of all other the most dangerous: Borrh. It continued longest: Pellican. yea and Sauls posteritie also afterward ceased not to oppugne Dauid: Osiand. So the Scripture vseth of speciall persons and matters to make special and particular mention: as 1. King. 11.1. Salomon loued many strange women, and the daughter of Pharaoh: he more specially loued her. Borrh.
3. Quest. v. 2. How Dauid calleth Iehouah his rocke. 1. As a rocke is both a sure defence from outward assaults, as beeing a place hard to come vnto: Pellican. as also it is a firme foundation to build vpon: Borrh. so in both these respects, God is Dauids and euery faithfull mans rocke, both in preseruati∣on from dangers and temptations, and in giuing perseuerance and strength to conti∣nue. 2. And this hath a speciall reference to Christ, who is the rocke and foundation of his Church, vpon whom we are builded by faith: Borrh. 3. Christ is so this rocke, as he is onely this rocke, as v. 32. who is the rocke beside our God? then is it blsphemie to make Peter (or any other Apostle) the rocke of the Church, as the Romanists doe. 4. Quest. v. 6. Of the sorrowes of the graue or hell, which Dauid as a type of Christ suffered. 1. Some read, the bandes or ropes, for chebel signifieth both: Ar. Sep. Lat. but in the plurall number, cheblee, rather signifieth sorrowes, as of a woman that travelleth, and cannot bring forth, Hos. 13.12. so also the Chal. and so it is taken here: Iun. 2. Some here translate sheol, hell, A.L. Osiand. Pellic. so also the Septuag. , the roapes or bands of hell: and they referre it first to Dauid, credebam me ob peccata mea inferno proximum: I thought sometime that in respect of my sinnes I was neere to hell: Pellic. Se∣condly, to Christ, as prefigured in Dauid, vt is peccatum & maledictum factus propter nos inferni dolores & cruciatum senserit, declarat haec eius vox, deus, deus, &c. how hee beeing made sinne and a curse for vs, did feele the sorrowes and torment of hell, that voice of his de∣clareth, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Pellic. So also Osiander, videbar captus in laqueis inferni, & quasi in infernum detrudendus, & ihi retinndus, eo quod totius orbis scelera mihi essent imposita, &c. I seemed as taken in the snares of hell, and as like to be thrust downe to hell, and to be held there, because the sinnes of the whole world were layd vpon me. 3. But though this is a true and honourabl confession of the sufferings of Christ, that he suffered euen the sorrowes of hell for vs, such as could be suffered without sinne and indignitie to his person, yet this seemeth not to bee the proper meaning of these words: which are rather to be read thus, the sorrowes of the graue: Iun. Geneuens. as the next words doe shewe, the snares of death preuented me: so then by the sorrows of the graue, he meaneth, mortall and deadly daunger, that threatened destruction to him. 5. Quest. v. 7. Out of what Temple Dauid was heard. 1. Some doe vnderstand it of the externall Tabernacle or Temple, vnto the which they turned them when they prayed, and where God promised visibly to be present: Osiand. But it seemeth that Dauid meant not so: for most his time the Tabernacle and Arke were a sunder: which of them then should he call the Temple of God? And be∣side Dauid did know that Gods presence was not tyed to the Tabernacle or Arke: as it may appeare by his sending backe of the Arke to Ierushalem when hee fledde away from Abshalom, chap. 15.25. 2. Some therefore by this Temple vnderstand Christ, who calleth himselfe the temple, Ioh. 2. in which temple whosoeuer prayeth to God, is heard: Borrh. But Dauid herein is a type of Christ, who prayed vnto his father both before and vpon the crosse, that the Lord also heard him out of his temple. And that this may be fitly applyed to Christ, both the words before going doe shew, that make mention of his suffrings, ver. 6.3. Therefore the fittest interpretation is by the Tem∣ple to vnderstand, the habitation of Gods glorie, the highest heauens: as Salomon saith in his prayer; then heare thou in heauen, the place of thy habitation: 1. King. 8.30. Pellican. 6. Quest. v. 8. The earth trembled and quaked, &c. 1. Some doe metaphorically interpret these words: by the earth, vnderstanding earthly minded men, that doe tremble and shake at Gods iudgments, Borr. 2. Some refer it to the passion of Christ, when the earth quaked, & the Sun withdrew his light: Osiand. But neither of these expositions are so fit: not the first, because the rest of the
description that follweth; as of the lightning, v. 19. of the Cherubs, v. 11. of the disco∣uering of the channels of the Sea, v. 16. can not receiue that metaphoricall sense: nor the second, for although that some of these fearefull signes were seene, in the passion of Christ, yet no the rest. 3. Therefore Dauids purpose is to set forth Gods power, by these his fearefull workes, of the earthquake, thunder, lightning, tempest, which are euident demonstrations of Gods presence in the world, that he is alway readie to defend his Church: Iun. wherein also he alludeth vnto the like workes done formerly; as in Egypt, when the Lord brought his plagues vpon them: in mount Sinai, when the law was giuen; in the red Sea, where the bottome was discouered: and when the Lord thundred, and shot his arrowes from heauen vpon the enemies of Ioshuah, Iosh. 10. Osiand. 7. Quest. v. 21. How Dauid saith, the Lord rewarded him according to his righteousnesse. 1. If it be vnderstood of Dauid in his owne person, he hath relation either to the goodnesse of his cause, which God had respect vnto: Iun. or he speaketh compara∣tiuely, that he was innocent in respect of his enemies, which persecuted him: as Dauid saith vnto Saul, vnderstand and see, that there is nither euill, nor wickednesse in me, neither haue I sinned against thee, 1. Sam. 24.4. Genevens. Borrh. Pellican. 2. And here is to be considered, that in the faithfull, there is a double righteousnesse: there is a perfect righteousnesse, which is Christs, imputed vnto them by faith, whereby they are iustified; and an imperfect righteousnesse, which is their obedience, the fruits of their faith: and hereby they are not iustified, but thereby they testifie and shew forth their faith. Borrh. 3. And this their righteousnesse God rewardeth not of merit or desert, for it is imperfect, but of fauour, accepting their will for the deed. Borrh. 4. But if we take Dauid to speake here figuratiuely of Christ: he was indeed perfectly obedient, and in him was no sinne, and his righteousnesse was truely meritorious. O∣siand. 8. Quest. v. 24. I was also perfect toward him. 1. There is also a double kind of perfection: one absolute & perfect, which is onely in Christ, & imputed by faith vnto his members: & by this perfection only are we here perfect in Gods sight: there is an other perfection, which is imperfect, which in some measure and degree is communicated to the members of Christ: and this also is of two sorts; it is either begun here in this life, or perfected & finished in the next: now while we here liue there are none perfect without their blemishes and infirmities, which notwithstanding the Lord for Christ his sake imputeth not to his members.Of perfection in this life. 2. Of this double kind of perfection, the Apostle speaketh euidently: of the absolute per∣fection he saith, not that we are alreadie perfect, Philip. 3.12. and of the other imme∣diately after, v. 15. Let v a many as are perfect, be thus minded: S. Paul denieth, that he hath the one kind of perfection, but he confesseth the other. 3. Dauid therefore here saith he is perfect or vpright, in regard of his desire and endeauour, still striuing vnto perfection: Pellican. as our Sauiour saith, be perfect as your heauenly father is per∣fect, Matth. 5. 9. Quest. v. 27. Of these words, With the peruerse thou wilt wrestle out, or shew thy selfe peruerse. 1. There is a double kind of peruersenesse, which is either in doctrine, when one speaketh and reacheth peruerse things: so is it taken, Act. 20.30. or in life, when men walke peruersly and frowardly, contrarie to the will and commandement of God. Bor. 2. With such also will the Lord walke accordingly: the most read, thou wilt shew thy selfe peruerse or froward: A.P.G.V. with others. But this interpretation seemeth to be somewhat harsh: 1. Because the word properly signifieth, taken in that sense, er∣versum te facies, thou wilt make thy selfe pruerse: which cannot be ascribed vnto God. 2. For that, whereas in the other three clauses, the same word is repeated: with the mer∣cifull thou will shew thy selfe mercifull, with the perfect and pure, thou wilt shew thy selfe per∣fect and pure: here the word is chaunged: whereas the peruerse is called ghikkesh, he saith not in the same word ith gakkesh, he will shew himselfe peruerse, but tithaph of pathal, which signifieth to wrestle. 3. Therfore that sense of the word is more fit, that
God will wrestle with them, alwaies crosse and oppose himselfe against them, as Leu. 26.28. till he haue ouercome and vanquished them in their owne frowardnes. Iun. 4. But the Lord indeede dealeth not peruersly or frowardly, but he so seemeth vnto the wicked, who accuse the Lord of iniustice against them, when he punisheth them ac∣cording to their deserts: And Gods peruerse and crosse dealing with them, is no∣thing else, but the not beeing mercifull vnto them, or deliuering them out of their troubles: Mart. 6. Such crosnes and and peruersenesse, the wicked imagine to be in God, when he layeth his iudgements vpon them for their sinnes, when they ex∣pected good things: as when vnsesonable weather is sent, as winter weather in the time of summer and haruest: whereas the peruersenesse and frowardnes of men cau∣seth such peruersenes, as the wicked take it, to appeare in Gods workes. Osiand. 10. Quest. v. 27. Of the difference, betweene Gods shewing of him∣selfe pure with the pure, and froward with the froward. 1. Whereas Dauid saith, with the pure thou wilt shew thy selfe pure, we must not thus think, that first man is pure, and then the Lord sheweth himselfe to be so toward man: for the beginning of our purenesse and goodnesse is from God: as our Blessed Saui∣our saith to his Disciples,Ioh. 15.16. Yee haue not chosen mee, but I haue chosen you: and the Apo∣stle saith,1. Ioh. 4.10. herein is loue, not that we loued him, but that hee loued vs: therefore first God maketh vs pure, and putteth his spirit into vs. This saying therefore must be vnder∣stood, not of our first election and vocation, which followeth thereupon, but of the fruites of our regeneration, and sanctification: that after our hearts are purified by faith, and so we bring forth the pure and acceptable workes and fruits of faith, the Lord in mercie crowneth and rewardeth them. 2. Yet the goodnesse of our workes is not the cause, that the Lord sheweth him∣selfe pure and mercifull: but it is the condition, which the Lord requireth, and an order, which God hath set, that his children should shew their obedience, before they haue their reward. 3. But in peruerse workes this difference is not obserued: for the wicked haue the prioritie, they first shew their frowardnes, before they feele Gods iustice: and the reason of the difference is this, because the euilnes and peruersnes of man is from his owne corruption, but the beginning of goodnes is from God. 4. Againe, these sayings must be so vnderstood, not that God presently rewardeth the obedience of his seruants, or punisheth the peruersenesse of the wicked: both the one may a long time be afflicted, and the other prosper in this world: but the Lord in his due time will performe both the one and the other, either in this world, or in the next. Mart. 11. Quest. v. 34. How Dauids feete were made like hindes feete. 1. By this phrase is expressed the nimblenesse and speedine, which Dauid vsed in the pursuite of his enemies: for two thing are requisite in warre; courage against the enemie, and expedition. And therefore the Gadites that went to Dauid, are said to haue had the faces of lyons, and were like the roes in the mountaines for swiftnes: Mart. 2. And here Dauid remembreth how after he escaped from his enemies, from Saul, and Absalom, as the hind, that is in chace from the hunters: wherein Dauid was a liuely type of our Blessed Sauiour, who was often sought for of his enemies, and went away thorough the middes of them vntill the time came, that was appointed for him to be deliuered vp into the hands of sinners. Borrh. 3. Hereby also is expres∣sed the singular dexteritie, which Dauid had, ad difficilia quaecun{que} aggredienda, to set vpon and attempt any hard matter. Pellican. 12. Quest. v. 35. How a bowe of brasse was broken with his armes. 1. The Latine interpreter readeth, thou makest mine armes as a bowe of steele: some thus, that mine armes are able to bend a bow of steele: Osiand. but the better reading is, that a bowe of brasse is broken with mine armes: that is, that I am able to break the yron bowes of mine enemies: Borrh. to ouercome their power, which seemed inuinci∣ble.
Pellican. 2. By this it may be gathered, that if God did teach Dauids hands to fight, that he was able to breake a bow of steele, that it is lawfull to wage iust battell: and that the militarie discipline is commendable: Mar. 3. But whereas hee addeth further, v. 36. Thou hast giuen mee the sheild of saluation, it sheweth, that it is not enough for the Lord to endue one with strength, vnlesse hee giue good successe, protect, and defend him, and giue him the right vse of his strength: Mart. 13. Quest. v. 42. Why the Gentiles were not heard, praying vnto God. 1. Because their prayer is without faith and repentance, therefore it is not accep∣ted: Mart. 2. And they pray not of loue, as the faithfull doe, but for feare of the iudgements of God, that lie vpon them, Osiand. 3. They inuocated God, but not purely, beeing worshippers of Idols: therefore the Lord would not heare them. As the Romanists doe call vpon Saints, and so make not God onely their confidence. Mart. 4. And this difference also there is betweene the prayers of the faithfull and vnfaithfull: the one as they are perswaded of Gods power, so they also are assured of his loue: but the other, though they confesse Gods power, yet they doe not trust vn∣to his mercie. Borrh. So the prayers of such are not accepted, neither doe enter into Gods presence: as the Lord saith, Prov. 1.28. They shall call vpon mee, but I will not an∣swer: So the Lord dealt with Saul, refusing to giue him any answer at all. 14. Quest. v. 45. How the straungers were in subiection to Dauid. 1. The word here vsed, cachash, signifieth to lie: the nations whom Dauid subdu∣ed, did dissemblingly, and against their wills submit themselues vnto him: they fai∣ned most readie and willing obedience, but it was in outward shew, their heart was not toward him: Iun. Pellic. this to be the meaning the next verse sheweth: strangers shall shrinke or fall away. 2. Some vnderstand it onely of the Iewes, who at the first re∣fused the Messiah, but afterward were obedient vnto him. Osiand. 3. Borrhaius refer∣reth the first clause to the dissembling Iewes, the second, as soone, as they heare, they shall obey mee, to the beleeuing Gentiles. But, as is before shewed, the first sense is the fittest, as the coherence with the words following sheweth. 4. Pet. Martyr thus interpreteth, they are said to lie vnto him, because they promised vnto themselues the victorie, but were deceiued: but then they had lyed vnto themselues, not vnto Da∣uid. 5. The Latine read, resistent mihi, they shall resist mee: but the word here vsed, doth not so signifie, as before is touched: I rest therefore in the first exposition. 15. Quest. v. 51. Whom the Prophet meaneth, by his Annoin∣ted: hee shewed mercie or louing kindnesse to his Anointed euen to Dauid. Here Dauid speaketh as a type and figure of Christ, to whom this propheticall speach is most properly applied: as may appeare by these reasons. 1. The former say∣ing, v. 50. I will praise thee among the nations, S. Paul vnderstandeth of the calling of the Gentiles, Rom. 15.9. for Dauid litterally did not this, who dwelt not among the nations to set forth Gods praise: therefore Christ by his spirit in his faithfull mem∣bers, setteth forth Gods praise in the nations. Mart. 2. Who is more properly said to be his King, then Iesus Christ, whom the Lord hath made heire of all things, and King of kings? 3. Christ is also called Dauid in the Prophets, as Ezech. 34.24. I the Lord will be their God, and my seruant Dauid shall be Prince among them: so Ierem. 30.9. They shall serue the Lord their God, and Dauid their King. Osiand. 4. This louing kindnesse, which the Lord sheweth to Dauid, and to his seed for euer, was not extended to his car∣nall succession: for the princely dignitie was taken from them, and they went into captiuitie: and who are now of Dauids race, according to the flesh it is not knowen: this euerlasting seed of Dauid must then be vnderstood of the true Israelites, which are by faith graft into the Messiah, of whose kingdome, (as the Prophet saith, Isai. 9.) there shall be no end. Borrh.
CHAP. 23. 1. Quest. v. 1. Why these are said to be the last words of Dauid. 1. THe Chalde paraphrast seemeth so to vnderstand these words, because they should be fulfilled in the last times: but then many of Dauids Psalmes beside might be called his last words, which doe prophecie of the kingdome of the Messiah, which should be reuealed in the latter age of the world. 2. Some giue this sense, they are called the last words, because Dauid doth make this as his last will and Testament, which he chaunged not, though he spake and did many things after: it was a confession of his constant and vnchaungable faith touching the Messiah, which he held vnto the end: Mar. Osiand. But in this sense many of the first words of Dauid, as that prophecie of the Messiah Psal. 2. might be called his last words, because Dauid held that faith to the end. 3. Diuerse doe take them to be Dauids last words in respect of the rest of the Psal∣mes: this was made last of them all. Vatab. Borrh. Genevens. 4. But I rather thinke with Iunius, that these were the last solemne words which Dauid vttered, after he had charged his sonne Salomon, and commended him vnto God, by that prayer Psalm. 72. herein imitating Iaacob, and Moses, who beeing rea∣die to die blessed the 12. Tribes: these words then though here set downe, yet were in order of time last: Iun. 2. Quest. v. 1. Of the fowre titles, which Dauid here giueth himselfe. 1. Dauid nameth himselfe by his father Ishai, as not beeing ashamed of his meane parentage, and the obscuritie of his familie, from the which he was aduanced to the kingdome; Osiand. As also he maketh speciall mention of him, because he was appoin∣ted of God, out of whose stocke and familie should come for the present the Kings of Israel, and for the time to come the Blessed Messiah, as Isai. 11.1. There shall come a rod forth of the stocke of Ishai. Borrh. 2. Secondly, he setteth forth his dignitie, he was set vp on high, that is, exalted to the regall dignitie. 3. His vocation also is expressed, the Annointed of the God of Iaacob: the Latine readeth, cui constitutum est de Christo, &c. to whom it was appointed concerning Christ: that is, who was assured and confirmed concerning the Messiah to come of his seed: Osiand. But the words in the originall will not beare this interpretation: for there is onely expressed the Messiah, not, of or concerning the Messiah; he was then the Annointed of God, to the kingdom of Israel, but therin also a type of the Messiah the verie Anointed of God for the euerlasting kingdome. 4. The last title is taken from his propheticall gift of singing: he was most sweet in the songs of Israel: in making songs for the vse of Israel, which they vsed to sing in the Tabernacle to the praise of God: Borrh. Iun. and they were sweet, non solum com∣positione & modis, not in the manner of making onely and measure, but in their force and efficacie; for as they were effectuall to allaie Sauls maladie, so they are most com∣fortable to a perplexed and troubled conscience. Mart. Osiand. 3. Quest. v. 2. Who it was, that spake to Dauid. 1. God the Father, and God the Sonne, who is v. 3. called the rock of Israel, spake vnto Dauid by the holy Ghost: here then is an euident demonstration of the Trinitie: the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost: which collections although they are not suffici∣ent to conuince the incredulous Iewes, yet to vs, that are perswaded of this beleefe, they are most comfortable. 2. Hence also may be gathered, that the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost, are all of one and the same substance and power, because the same action is ascribed to them all, they are all said to speake vnto Dauid: Mart.
3. And herein the dignitie and worthinesse of the Psalmes is also set forth, which were not made by any priuate motion, but proceeded from the spirit of God, who spake by the mouth of Dauid: as the Apostle witnesseth, which by the mouth of thy ser∣uant Dauid hast said, Act. 4.25. Osiand. 4. Quest. v. 3. What the Lord said to Dauid. 1. Some referre these words, bearing rule ouer men, beeing iust, and ruling in the feare of God, vnto God himselfe: that the strength of Israel, the iust ruler and gouernour, God himselfe thus said vnto Dauid, that the Messiah that Iust and righteous King should take flesh of his seed: Osiand. but if this be vnderstood of God that speaketh, then nothing is expressed, that here should be spoken vnto Dauid. 2. Some doe referre it to the Messiah, that the Lord here spake to Dauid and pro∣mised him, that the Messiah should come of him, who should gouerne the people vp∣rightly in the feare of God. Chalde, Pellican. 3. But it is better vnderstood of Dauid: not that it was so much a prophecie or prediction of him by Samuel, that he should gouerne the people in iustice, Vatablus: for Dauid failed diuersly in his gouernment: but it was rather a commandement, which the Lord gaue vnto Dauid, that he should both in ciuill matters gouerne the people iustly and vprightly, and for religion, in the feare of God: and as this was re∣quired on Dauids behalfe: so the Lord for his part promiseth vnto Dauid a sure house, as it followeth in the next words, v. 4. Iun. But herein Dauids gouernment beeing iust but in part, and in some measure, was a type and figure of the most perfect kingdom of the Messiah: whereof the Prophet speaketh, Psal. 45.6. the scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of righteousnesse. 5. Quest. v. 4. Of the meaning of these words, as the morning light, &c. without cloudes, &c. 1. Some make this the sense: that here are two similitudes briefly put together: the one taken from the bright morning Sunne shine without clouds, the other, from the Sunneshine mingled with clouds and raine, which causeth the grasse to grow; to the first Dauids house is compared, not to the second, which is an imperfect light cast o∣uer and obscured with clouds: Vat. Mar. Pellic. And to make this interpretation more probable, some insert a negatiue in the second clause, so shall mine house be, not as the grasse, &c. G.B. But seeing there is no such negatiue particle in the originall, it is not safe so to read. 2. Therefore the better exposition is, that here are two similitudes produced to the same effect, to set forth the flourishing state of Dauids house, which shall be like vnto the morning sunne without clouds, and the growing grasse after raine. Iun. Borr. Osiand. 6. Quest. v. 5. Of the meaning of these words, so shall not mine house be with God. 1. Some read affirmatiuely, so shall mine house be with God: Pellican. and the words, chilo, they take for imo, but, or verily; as they say they are vsed, Gen. 18.15. chilo, verily, thou didst laugh. But it is euident that this particle (lo) is neuer vsed in the Hebrew, but negatiuely: and so is it taken in that place giuen in instance: which is read thus, not so, but thou didst laugh: and beside there the words are lo, chi, not chi lo, as here. 2. Some reading here negatiuely, expound thus: so shall not mine house be, that is, not like the grasse, which groweth speedily, and soone fadeth, and withereth againe: Mar. Genevens. Vata. But it is shewed before, that the similitude taken from the grow∣ing grasse is vsed in the latter sense, as Psal. 72.6. Hee shall come downe like the raine vpon the mowne grasse. 3. Osiander following the Latine translater, thus interpreteth, neither is my house so with God, that hee should make with mee an euerlasting couenant: that is, I acknowledge that it is not of my worthinesse, that God should make such an euerlasting couenant with me, that the Messiah should come of my seed: so also Emmanuel Sa. But this seemeth rather to be the reddition to the former similitude, which otherwise were
imperfect. 4. Iunius thus vnderstandeth it; although my house be not so with God: that is, yet this promise is not accomplished concerning the prosperitie of my house, by reason of my sinne: yet I trust in the Messiah, it shall be accomplished: in whom all my health and desire is: but in this sense and interpretation also their wanteth the reddition to the former similitude. 5. Wherefore I preferre before the rest here Borrhaius interpretation, who in the former similitude taken from the Sunne-light in a morning not cloudie, inclusiuely vnderstandeth the contrarie, the Sunlight ouercast with cloudes: and so hee giueth this sense: mine house shall not be so as the cloudie ayre before mentioned, but as the cleere and bright Sunne shine: so then as the proposition of the similitude, includeth a dissimilitude, so the reddition to the dissimilitude, includeth a reddition to the simi∣litude: mine house shall not be as the one, but it shall be as the other. 7. Quest. v. 5. Of the meaning of these words, my whole desire is, that hee doth not make it grow. 1. Vatablus vnderstandeth it of the rising and growing of some other to be King, then of the house of Dauid: his desire is, that God will not cause any such to grow. But this growing hath reference to that which went before, namely, the growing and increase of Dauids house: therefore it cannot be referred to the growing of any such strange plant not mentioned before. 2. The Chalde, whom Borrhaius subscribeth vnto, deriueth the sense to that which followeth, v. 6. the wicked shall be as thornes: that Dauids whole desire is, that the wicked doe not grow: but beside that this was not Dauids whole happinesse and de∣sire, that the house of the wicked should not flourish, but rather that his owne house might prosper: this should be put out of place, seeing hitherto Dauid extendeth the first similitude of the prosperitie of his owne house: and then in the next place, he commeth to speake of the vnprosperous state of the wicked. 3. The Latine translator, whom Emman. Sa. followeth, thus readeth: non est quic∣quam, quod non germinet ex eo, neither is there any thing which doth not grow of it: that is, of his house: but in this reading, there are two negatiues, which in the Latine tongue make an affirmatiue, whereas in the originall there is but one. 4. The most Interpreters doe thus interpret, my whole desire is, that it doe not grow, that is, so, like vnto grasse, which soone doth grow and soone withereth: Pellican, Genevens. B. But as is shewed before, the growing of the grasse sprouing after the raine, is taken in the better part, and thereby the prosperitie of Dauids house is expres∣sed. 5. Iunius thus openeth the words; though for the present mine house doe not grow and increase, as was before by those two similitudes set forth, vers. 4. because of my sinne, yet my whole health or saluation and desire is in the accomplishment of Gods promise: hee then thus readeth: my whole saluation and desire is therein, seeing hee doth not cause it to grow. But in this sense Dauid should seeme to complaine, that hee sawe not the accomplishment of Gods promises toward him: where in his former song he celebrated the praise of God, for shewing such mercie and louing kindnes toward him, c. 22.51. and for rewarding him according to his vprightnes, v. 21. 6. Wherefore in the last place, Osiander thus deliuereth the sense of these words: my whole desire (will, or longing is) because hee doth not cause it to grow: that it, be∣cause I see not, that blessed braunch yet to grow forth: for all the Patriarkes and Pro∣phets longed for the dayes of the Messiah, who is called, the bud of the Lord, tzamach Iehouah, Isa. 4.2. the which word tzamach, to grow, is vsed here: the like phrase pro∣pounded negatiuely, shewing a lingring desire, is found, Reu. 6.4. How long Lord wilt thou not iudge, and auenge our blood, &c. 8. Quest. v. 6. Why the wicked are compared to thornes, that can not be handled. An opposition is here made betweene the house of the righteous, and the genera∣tion of the wicked. 1. They are compared to the fruitfull and growing buds: the o∣ther are as thornes: 2. the one shall continue, as the Sunne, the other shall be rooted
out: Borrh. 3. The one is handled with hands, and preserued; the other is intractable, there is no societie with the wicked, they are ordained for the fire: Mart. 4. Non admittunt culturam, they cannot be dressed and tilled: Osiand. nor by corection a∣mended. 5. They are taken away with yron: sometime cut off by the hand of the ma∣gistrate, or by some extraordinarie iudgement; and at the last shall be destroyed with euerlasting fire: like as thornes in the same place, where they are pulled vp are consu∣med and burnt: Mar. 6. Here is speciall reference made to the obstinate Iewes, who as thorns should be taken away with the weapons of the Romanes, and their city con∣sumed with fire, which came to passe vnder Titus and Vespasian: Osiand. 9. Quest. v. 8. Of Dauids worthie men in generall. 1. These worthies here named, were most faithfull vnto Dauid; for they serued him not onely in prosperitie, after he came vnto the kingdome, but before also, as Abishai and Aahel, who was slaine by Abner, while Dauid yet raigned in Hebron: Mart. 2. For the number of them they were in all 37. ver. 39. but they were diuided into two rankes: there was one companie of 30. whereof Asahel is named the first, and Asahel the last, but these were of the second sort, the other seauen were more valiant then these, and they were in the first ranke of worthies: Pellic. 3. These worthies that ser∣ued Dauid shadowed forth the 12. Apostles, and 72. Disciples, which were the wor∣thie and stout champions, which did fight the Lords spirituall battells, vnder the true Dauid and beloued of God Christ Iesus: Borrh. 4. In that the names and acts of these worthie men are not suppressed, but committed to memorie, it sheweth that the Lord will not forget the faithfull seruice and labour of his Saints. 5. As also herein it is euident, that it neuer fareth better with the common-wealth, then when vertue is aduanced, and men are respected according to their faithfull seruice: but all things goe to decay, where honours and preferments are carried away with flatterie. 10. Quest. Of the first worthie his name, and acts. 1. Some read, he that sate in the seate of wisedome: Adino of Ezui: A.P.V.B.G. where they make the proper names, Iasheb basheueth tachmam, appellatiue, and contrariwise the appellatiue Adino Ezus, they make proper: P.A.V.L. and some following this reading, vnderstand it of Dauid, that sate in the feite of wisedome, some of Ioab: but these are said to be the mightie men, whom Dauid had, therefore Dauid was none of them: and Ioab must be reckoned among them beside, otherwise there will be but 36. in all. 2. Therefore the best reading is this, the two first words, Iasheb bashebeth, are his proper name, and Tachmam sheweth his kinred: as he is called Iashobeam the sonne of Hachmoni, 1. Chron. 11.11. and Iosephus comming somewhat neere these names, saith he was called Ishemus the sonne of Achemaeus. 3. Concerning the other words, Adino, hagetzeni. 1. Some make them a proper name, B.G.A.P.S. but his proper name is set downe before. 2. Some translate thus, quasi tenerrimus ligni vermiculus, as the tender worme of the wood, L. for haden, or ghaden, signifieth pleasure, and ghetz, wood but there can be no reason or good sense giuen of this interpretation. 3. Osiander thinketh, that fo ghadino, i should be read gharer, lifting vp, which word is vsed, 1. Chron. 11.11. but it is dangerous to make a∣ny innovation, or admit any corruption in the text. 4. Iunia thus burneth it, it was a pleasure to him with his speare to inuade eigh hdred▪ so e ae riueth gadino, of the root ghadan, to take delight, and of the affix which signifieth him: but thn the word hu, he, which goeth before should be superfluous: neither is there any word which signi∣fieth to inuade, onely the preposition ghal, against, is expressed in the text, to supply tha word. 5. Vatablus theefore better interpreteth,  hastam suam, he lift vp his speare: and so he deriueth ghadino, of ghadad, which signifieth to lif vp, of the same sense with ghur, which is vsed, 1. Chr. 11.1. to the same purpose, to expresse his va∣liant act: and then the letter nun, with the affix must be added paragogically, as the syllable (ni) is in the nex word haghetzeni: this sense may seeme more probable, by comparing it with the like storie, 1. Chro. 11.11. but the word haghetzeni of ghetz, which signifieth wood, is better translated hastatus, or ligeus, armed with wood, that i, a speare, (as appeareth by the deriuation) the wood or speare.
11. Quest. v. 8. Of the number slaine by this first worthie. Here it is said he lift vp his speare against 800. whom he wounded at once, but 1. Chron. 11.11. mention is made onely of 300. whom he slew at once. 1. Iosephus is de∣ceiued, who thinketh that at diuerse times this Iashabram, whom he calleth Ishem, kil∣led 900. men, for this number agreeth not with the text, neither diuided nor put to∣gether. 2. D. Kimhi thinketh, that he had two combates at two seuerall times, in the one he slew 800. in the other 300. and that the one is expressed here, the other in the Chronicles.Reconcil. 3. But these places are thus better reconciled, that if we vnderstand so many to haue beene inuaded at once, namely 800. which all were wounded, but 300 of them were slaine out right: Iun. Osiand. for the word hallall, signifieth as well to wound, as kill. 4. Now if it shall seeme strange that one man should kill so many, we must not call in question the truth of those things, which are recorded in the sacred stories: and yet this may satisfie vs, that nothing is impossible vnto God; he that gaue Sampson such strength, that hee with the iawe-bone of an asse killed a thou∣sand, Iudg. 15. could enable this captaine with a speare to wound eight hundred men. Mart. 12. Quest. v. 9. Of Eleazar, the second of the first three worthies. 1. This Eleazar is described by his name, parentage, he was the sonne of Dodo, and his tribe, he was an Achochite, descended of Achoach, a Beniaminite, 1. Chron, 8.4. 2. His valour is set forth by the circumstances, when the people were fled, not were assembled to battell, as the Latine readeth: for so is it expounded, 1. Chron, 11.13 and here, v. 11. then he resisted the whole hoast of the Philistims. 3. If the people fledde, it is not like they defied the Philistims, as read L.V.A.P. or vpbraided thē with their cowardlinesse: Osiand. the word charaph, signifieth also to expose their life to danger, as it is taken, Iudg. 5.18. the meaning is, that they did hazard their liues in this seruice. 4. And this Eleazar did fight so valiantly, that his hand did cleaue to his sword, not that cruore gladius ad dextram agglutinaretur, the sword was glued to his hand with blood, as Iosephus: but his hand was rather benummed, ex distentione neruorum, by the distention of the nerues or sinewes: Iun. Vatab. 5. The place where this was done is not here named, but 1. Chron. 11.13. it is called Pas. danimim. 13. Quest. v. 11. Of Shammah the third of Dauids worthies. 1. Iosephus calleth him Seba, and maketh him Eleazars sonne: but the text saith o∣therwise, that he was the sonne of Age. 2. The vsuall reading is, that the Philistims were gathered together in a towne: A.P.B.G. the word is, caiah, which is taken for a village or towne: but it is euident in the text, that this exploite was done in a field, where lintels were: it signifieth also a troupe, band, or companie of men, as Psal. 68.30. the troupe or companie of spearemen, and so is it better taken here: the Philistims were assembled in a troupe: Iun. Vatab. Lat. Iosephus saith, the place was called, max∣illa, a iawe, but then the word should be lechi, as Iudg. 15.15. not lacaiah, where la∣med,Reconcil. is a preposition, and no radicall letter. 3. But here a greater doubt is mooued: this act is ascribed to Eleazar who kept the Philistims from a field of barley, 1. Chr. 11.13. not of lintells, as is said here: Kimhi thinketh that both barley and lintells might be brought together into one field, or it might be indifferently called a field of barley and lintells, because it did by course beare both these kinds of graine: Mart. but it seemeth rather this exploite beeing done at the same time by these two worthies (for it is said, that they stood in the middest of the field, and saued it, 1. Chr. 11.13.) that the one kept the Philistims from the barley field, the other from that part which had lintells: which the Philistims would haue destroyed. Iun. 14. Quest. v. 13. What three captaines they were, which are here mentioned. 1. The common opinion is, that these were three of the thirtie after mentioned, and so the vsuall reading is, three of the thirty captains: B.G.A.P.L.V. but it is euident, v. 22. that these three were not of the thirty: Benaiah was honourable among the thirtie, but he attained not to the first three, these three then were not of the thirty. 2. Wherefore the better reading is, three cheife beyond the thirtie: Iun. & these were
the same three before spoken of: for it is euident, v. 19.23. that before mention of A∣bishai and Benaiah, there were but the first three spoken of: of this opinion is Iose∣phus, to whom suscribeth Iunius, Pellican. 15. Quest. Of the circumstances of this exploite, the time when it was done. 1. Because it is said, that these came vnto Dauid in the time of haruest vnto the caue of Adullam, where Dauid sometime made his abode in the dayes of Saul, when he fledde from him, 1. Sam. 22.1. Some therefore thinke that this exploit was done in the time of Dauids persecution by Saul: Pellican. Osiand. But this is not like: for to what end should the host of the Philistims then be gathered against Dauid, who was pursued of Saul, seeing that they had cause more to feare Saul then Dauid? 2. Therefore the more probable opinion is, that this fell out vnder Dauids raigne, and in the beginning thereof, when he encountred with the Philistims, whose armie pitched in the valley of Rephaim, 2. Sam. 5.17. as it is also expressed here; Iun. so also Iosephus. 16. Quest. Of the place where this exploit was done. 1. Some thinke that this was done in the caue of Adullam, that there Dauid lon∣ged for this water of Bethlehem: because it is said, that these three came thither to Da∣uid: but the text saith, that Dauid was then in an hold, ver. 14. therefore not in the caue: the truth is, that Dauid, when he longed for this water was at Ierushalem, in a certaine hold, not farre from the fort of Sion;Reconcil. into the which he descended from Sion while he consulted with God, the Philistims beeing pitched in the valley of Repha∣im, not farre from Ierusalem: as is before shewed, 2. Sam. 5.17.18. so Ioseph. Iun. and from thence going against the Philistims, he marched toward Adullam, whether these three captaines came to him, after they had beene at Bethlehem, to fetch the water thence. Iun. 2. But it will be obiected, that if Dauid were at Ierusalem, or neere the fort of Sion, he could not haue beene driuen to such extremitie, as to want water to quench his thirst. Ans. Indeed some thinke, that Dauid longed for this water, beeing weary and thirstie: Vatab. Genevens. but that is not like, for Dauid could not haue wanted water, but all the host must be in distresse beside, which extremitie Dauid was not dri∣uen vnto in any battel against the Philistims, after he was established in the kingdom, that we read of: therefore it is more like, that Dauid was captus desiderio, &c. desi∣rous of that water, not of any such necessitie; but because it was excellent for the cool∣nesse and wholesomenesse, and preferred before other waters▪ ibi aquae fortassis non commodae erant, it is like the waters there were not so commodious: Mar. And if Da∣uid had longed for these waters of thirst, it is like he in his great necessitie would not haue refused to drinke of them. 3. An other doubt is, that it is said, 1. Chron. 11.15. that these three went downe to a rocke to Dauid in the caue: how could Dauid be then in the caue, if he were on the rock. Ans. The preposition is, ghal, which may be as well interpreted, they went down vpon a rocke, or by a rocke, or to a rocke: Iunius readeth, they descended from a rocke: or the caue of Adullam, might be in the hollow of a rocke. 4. Further, there seemeth to be some contradiction in the storie: for vers. 13. it is said, the Philistims pitched in the valley of Rephaim, and v. 14. that the garison of the Philistims was then in Bethlehem: the places are thus reconciled,Reconcil the maine battell or host of the Philistims was encamped in the valley of Rephaim: but some garrison of them did beset the way and passages toward Bethlehem. Iun. 17. Quest. v. 16. Of the ventrous exploit of these three in fetching water with the perill of their liues, and Dauids re∣fusall of it. 1. It is not expressed in the text, that Dauid bid them to goe, and bring him some of that water: some thinke, that Dauid did it, to make triall of their valure; but by Dauids refusall of the water, it seemeth, that they went vnbidden: Mar. 2. Where∣in appeareth their singular faithfulnesse vnto Dauid, that would in so small a matter,
to satisfie his desire, aduenture their liues: what would they haue done if Dauids life had beene in daunger? yet this their boldnesse is not to be imitated, for men to offer themselues to danger, where no vrgent necessitie is: Pellic. 3. Dauid refuseh to drinke of this water, which was bought with the price of their blood: teaching Princes not to buy their pleasures with the losse of their subiects liues: as Neo to see the manner of the burning of Troy, set Rome on fire: Alexander is much celebrated in forren stories, because he refused to drinke a little water brought vnto him, all the armie beeing in great distresse for thirst: but Dauid here doth the like, and with a better heart then Alexander, giuing the praise vnto God. 4. So he is said to powre out this water vnto God, not as a sacrifice: for they were not to offer water vnto God, but wine: but by this fact he giueth thankes vnto God, who had giuen such valour vnto these men,Ioseph. lib. 7. antiqu. c. 10. and that the Lord had preserued them from this daunger. Ioseph. 5. Dauid calleth this water their blood, because they had purchased it with daun∣ger of loosing their liues,Controv. How the wine in the Eucharist is cal∣led Christs blood. and shedding their blood: and may not the wine in the Eu∣charist be called the blood of Christ, which he was not in daunger onely to shed, but did shed indeede for our redemption? Mar. 18. Quest. v. 18. Of Abishai his exploits. 1. All Abishai his valiant acts are not here expressed, as how he went downe with Dauid into Sauls campe, and tooke away his speare and a pot of water, 1. Sam. 26. and how he rescued Dauid from a gyant, c. 21.17. these valiant acts are not here mentio∣ned, because they were touched before. 2. That valiant act of his which is here recorded, was the slaying of 300. men at once, against whom he lift vp his speare. Iosephus is here deceiued in the number, hee speaketh of 600. slaine by Abishai. 3. Two onely of this second ranke are here mentioned, as thinketh P. Mart. Abi∣shai and Benaiah, the third is here omitted, and likewise 1. Chron. 11. where also the third man of the first ernion, namely Shammah, is omitted. But as Osiander thinketh, and Iunius is of the same opinion, Asahel was the third man: who was not the cheife of three, as Vatablus readeth, v. 24. but of the thirtie, and inferiour vnto the two ter∣nions before mentioned. Some read, he was one of the thirtie, B.G. but the word is rash, head or cheife of the thirtie. Iun. 19. Quest. v. 20. Of the valiant exploits of Benaiah. 1. First, he is said to haue killed not two lyons of Moab, as the Latine interpreter: for the lion which he slewe is spoken of afterward: or two strong places, as Vatab. but they were two strong men like lyons, Iun. Osiand. Iosephus thinketh they were two brethren: the word in the originall is ariel, which signifieth a lyon: but an other word haari is afterward vsed, where he speaketh of a lyon indeede, to shewe that hee before meant by that tearme lyons, men. Osiand. 2. His second exploit was in slaying a lyon, which fact is amplified by two circum∣stances: both of the place, he slewe him in the middes of a pit, where the roome was streight: and in the time of snowe, when lyons are most fierce, by reason they want their pray, the sheepe and cattell beeing then shut vp in time of hard weather: Mart. Iun. This may seeme to haue been too bold and rash an enterprise: but it is like that this lyon was hurtfull to all that countrey, and vsed to pray vpon their cattell: and as Iosephus writeth, the lyon beeing fallen into a pit, roared, and so might be fearefull al∣so to all the inhabitants thereabout. 3. In the third place he killed an Egyptian of great stature: which fact is also set forth by these three circumstances: he was of great stature, euen fiue cubits high, his speare was as a weauers beame, and Benaiah came against him onely with a staffe, and tooke his speare out of his owne hand, and killed him therewith, 1. Chron. 11.23. 4. Some by the lion, whome he slewe in the cisterne, vnderstand Ioab, whome Benaiah slew at the altar, and by the Egyptian, Shemei, whom he also killed: but the litterall sense in an historicall narration is more safely followed.
20. Quest. v. 23. Whether Benaiah were made of Dauids counsell. 1. The words in the originall are, Dauid set him ouer his audience, which the Latin intepreteth, auricularium à secreto, to be at his eare, and his secretarie: Osiand. so like∣wise B. G. read his counseller: whereupon he giueth this note, that among militarie men there are found many wise and fit for counsell. But this sense is not probable: for Seraiah is said before to haue been the Kings Scribe or secretarie: c. 18.17. 2. There∣fore by the men of his audience, or as Vatablus readeth, his obedience, are vnderstood those daily attendants vpon the Kings person, which were readie at the first hearing to execute the kings commaundement, who were as the Kings guard: these were the Cherethites and Pelithites, ouer whom Benaiah was set, c. 8.18. Iun. Mart. Vatabl. It is like also he was of Dauids counsell, but that is not the meaning of this place. 21. Quest. Of Dauids thirtie worthies here rehearsed from ver. 24. to the ende. 1. These here numbred doe varie in their names, from those which are reckoned, 1. Chron. 11. beeing the same persons, which as it seemeth had diuerse names: As Shammah the Charodite, is there called Shammath the Hararite: Cheletz the Paltite, is there named Pelonite: Mebunai the Chushathite of the tribe of Iudah, 1. Chron. 4.4. is there called Sibbecai: Zalman the Arhochite, is there Hilai: Cheleb is there Cheled: Hiddai not of the riuer, but of the valley of Gahash, is there Churai: Abi Alban the Arbathite, there Abiel: Asmaueth the Baochumite, there the Bachonu∣mite, of Bachmini of Beniamin: Iashen, v. 32. there Hashem, v. 34. Achiam the sonn of Sharac, v. 33. there the sonne of Sacar, v. 35. Eliphalet the sonne of Achasbai, v. 34. there Eliphal the sonne of Vr, v. 35. Eliam the sonne of Achitophel, v. 34. there Achiah the Pelonite, v. 36. Hezrai the Carmelite, v. 35. is there Chezra, v. 37. Paa∣rai the Arbite, v. 35. is there Naarai the sonne of Ezboi, v. 37. Igal the sonne of Na∣than of Zabah, v. 36. is there Iael the brother of Nathan. 2. Beside the difference of names, the number also doth varie: for here there are but thirtie in all beside Asahel: there are numbred 47. or thereabout. Iunius conie∣cture is, that all those there rehearsed after Vriah, sauing Zabad, v. 41. whom he thin∣keth to come in place of Elika here mentioned, v. 25. (who might be slaine) were the captaines that kept the confines and borders of Israel. 3. But whereas there are two Shammahs here rehearsed among the rest, one called Shammath the Charadite, v. 25. the other Shammah the Hararite: neither of these is to bee supposed to haue beene that Shammah the Hararite, which was one of the three first worthies, mentioned ver. 11. for the first Shammah named also Shammath, 1. Chron. 11.27. is here called a Charadite of Charad, Iudg. 7.1. the other Shammah called an Hararite, v. 33. was the sonne of Shageh the Harite, 1. Chon. 11.34. but this Shammah one of the first three worthies, was the sonne of Age: And if that Shā∣mah should be counted among these, the number of 37. set downe, could not be made vp. 4. So then as Dauid had more worthies, then these here summed together, as is e∣uident by comparing this chapter with 1. Chr. 11. So also their valiant acts are not ex∣pressed: some of their exploits were remembred before, as of Elhanan, Sibbecai, Io∣nathan, 2. Sam. 21.8.19.21. but it is like not all their acts, nor of the rest. 22. Quest. Of the countries and places of Dauids worthies. Shammah was a Charadite: there was a fountaine of that name called Charad, Iud. 7.1. which was in Iizreel, 1. Sam. 29.1. v. 27 Mebunnai was a Cushathite, in the tribe of Iudah, 1. Chron. 4.4. Maharai, v. 28. was a Netophathite, of Iudah likewise, 1. Chron. 2.54. v. 30. Benaia was a Pirathonite, of a towne in the tribe of Ephraim, Iud. 10.15. he was not Benaiah one of the second three worthies: for he was of Kabzeel, a towne in the tribe of Iudah, Iosh. 15.21. v. 30. Hiddai was of the vallies of Gahash an hil in the tribe of Ephraim, Ios. 14.30. v. 32. Eliashba was a Shaalbanite, in the tribe of Dan, Iosh. 19.42.
v. 33. Shammah is called an Hararite, of some of the mountaines of Ephraim. v. 34. Eliphelet was a Maachothite, in the tribe of Manasseh, Iosh. 13.11. Eliam was of Ghilo, a citie in the tribe of Iudah, Iosh. 15.51. v. 35. Hesrai a Carmelite, likewise in the tribe of Iudah, Iosh. 15.55. And Paharai an Arbite, of Arab in the tribe of Iudah, Iosh. 15.52. v. 37. Naharai was a Beerothite of Beniamin, Iosh. 18.25. v. 38. Hira an Ithrite of Iattir a towne of Iudah, Iosh. 15.48. 23. Quest. v. 39. Of the number of Dauids worthies, how they are counted 37. Whereas there are but 31. rehearsed with Asahel, beside the other fiue which make but 36. the doubt is, how the number of 37. is made vp. 1. Iosephus thinketh that there were in all 38. in which number it seemeth he com∣prehendeth those three, whose valiant acts were before expressed, c. 21. Elhanan, Sib∣bechai, and Ionathan: but the number cannot bee made vp with them, because they are here reckoned among the thirtie, and so they should be twice counted. 2. D. Kimhi thinketh that there are 36. beside Benaiah, and that he was none of the two rankes of threes, but is numbred beside them; but the text is euident, v. 22. that he was accounted among the three worthies of the second sort, though he were not reckoned among the first. 3. Vatablus his opinion is, that Asahel with the rest make 31. and that there were 6. worthies beside: but there are onely fiue worthies named beside Asahel: therefore he must be comprehended to make vp the sixe. 4. Pet. Martyr thinketh, that either some one must bee supplyed of Dauids wor∣thies, or that the wanting of one is no great matter in the number. But it is neither like, that any here not named are numbred: and where a iust number is set downe in Scripture, we must not admit the least error or failing in the summe. 5. Wherefore, this number of 37. is made vp with Ioab, who was the captaine of the rest: Kimhi thinketh that he is not named among them, because he was the cheife captaine: but it is so much the more like that he was not omitted. And whereas Osi∣ander coniectureth, that he is not set downe, because he had disgraced himselfe by those two treacherous murthers of Abner and Amasa, and made himselfe vnworthie of any memorie, that was no let, why his valiant acts should not be remembred: for here is mention made of Achitophel, whose son Eliam, was one of Dauids worthies. And beside honourable mention is made of Ioab, v. 18. Abishai is said to be the bro∣ther of Ioab. Therefore seeing Ioab is named in this chapter, and there is no other found to make the number of 37. and Ioab was also a valiant and worthie man, it is most probable, that he is included in the number. Iun. CHAP. 24. 1. Quest. v. 1. Wherefore the wrath of God was kindled againe against Israel. 1. RVpertus thinketh that the anger of God was kindled against Israel, because of the iniurie done to Vriah, who is named immediately before in the last verse of the former chapter: but it seemeth by the words of the text, that it was some gene∣rall sinne of the whole land: for it is said, the wrath of God was kindled against Israel. 2. Some thinke that the people had at diuerse times before sinned against God, in the dayes of Saul, and in ioyning with Absalom, and last of all in following of She∣bah, c. 20. and that the Lord doth now punish them for all: But it seemeth it was some newe prouocation, whereby the wrath of God was againe and a fresh as it were kindled against Israel. 3. There may therefore be two causes assigned specially of this great wrath: first the Israelites liuing now in ease and tranquilitie, abused it, & defluebant luxu, and gaue themselues to riotous liuing: Mar. likewise hauing obtained so many victories against
their enemies, they might grow insolent and secure: Borrh. 4. Thus as before in the rebellion of Abshalom, there fell of the people 20. thou∣sand, and they felt three yeares famine for the sinne of Sauls house: so now the Lord sendeth vpon them the third plague of the pestilence. Pellican. 5. Here also it may be obserued, as the prayer of the people helpeth the Magistrate, so by their sinnes, occasionem dederunt principis lapsai, they giue occasion of the Prin∣ces fall; and therein as they are partakers of the sinne, so they are of the punishment. Mart. 2. Quest. v. 1. Who it was that mooued Dauid to number the people. 1. D. Kimhi and R. Levi Ben Gerson vnderstand, that Dauids owne concupiscence mooued him to number the people: but thereof no mention is made before. 2. Some referre it to some wicked counseller, that mooued Dauid to doe it: Vata. but this sense is refused for the same reason. 3. Iunius interpreteth this place by that 1. Chron. 21.1. that Sathan stood vp against Israel, and prouoked Dauid: which is certaine, that Sathan did here principally tempt Dauid vnto euill: but in this place the nominatiue case is rather to be sought in the words going before. 4. But seeing the Scripture else where ascribeth as much vnto God, as Isai. 19.14. The Lord hath mingled among them the spirit of errors, and the same Prophet saith, c. 63.17. O Lord, why hast thou made vs to erre from thy wayes: we need not be afraid to speak as the Scripture doth, that the Lord stirred vp Dauid, as before c. 16. Dauid saith, that the Lord bid Shemei curse him. 5. Wherefore after this manner God is said to haue mooued Dauid, 1. in permit∣ting and suffring Sathan to put it into Dauids heart, to number the people, Osiand. 2. God was causa remouens, the remoouing cause, in not giuing vnto Dauid at this time the direction of his spirit. 3. The generall vertue and power of moouing is from God, but the euilnes of the ction is of our selues. 4. God vsed this fall and slip of Dauid, and turned it to an other end, thereby his iustice shewed it selfe in punishing his peo∣ple: Mart. and it was an occasion of greater good: by this meanes the place was poin∣ted out where afterward the Temple was built: Rupertus. 3. Quest. Wherein Dauid sinned in causing the people to be numbred. 1. Iosephus thinketh, that Dauid offended herein, because he had forgotten in num∣bring the people to leuie the summe of halfe a sickle vpon euery one according to the law, Exod. 30. but this was not the reason, for the people were numbred againe by Moses, Numb. 1. and yet paied not that halfe sickle. 2. Some thinke it simply vnlawfull to number the people, wherein the Lord pro∣mised to be innumerable as the starres of the skie, and the sand of the Sea: and there∣fore it belonged vnto God onely to number that, which was innumerable: but this is not so, for they were there numbred by Moses, Exod. 38. Numb. 1. Numb. 26. 3. Some iudge that Dauid purposed to haue imposed some taske vpon the people, and so he sinned in coueting: as Dion writeth of Augustus Caesar, that he appointed a taske ouer all that pertained to the Romane Empire. But Ioab brought Dauid the summe of the people, yet no such imposition is mentioned so much as to haue beene intended. 4. Dauids fault was then first in entring into a needelesse action, wherof there was no cause, but onely Dauids curiositie: he would haue it done, that I may know, saith hee, the number of the people, v. 2. for the mustring of the people was vsed among the Romans, (which custom was first taken vp by Seruius Tullius the King) for these foure ends. 1. To know who were fit for warre: 2. to know euery ones substance, to make in∣different rates: 3. that the people thereby might acknowledge their subiection: 4. and that a view might be taken of the peoples faults. But Dauid here propounded none of these ends. 1. Warre he had now none in hand. 2. Neither intended he to make any collecti∣on.
3. And they needed not by this meanes professe their subiection, seeing he was taken, and acknowledged of all for their King. 4. And they had other magistrates to watch ouer the peoples faults: the Leuites to instruct them, and the Elders to correct them. 5. So then it is cleare that Dauids heart was lifted vp to reioyce in the number and strength of the people: for the which the Lord was angrie with him, and sent a plague among the people. 6. Rupertus maketh this numbring of the people a liuely shadow of the carnall Iewes, who trusted to the workes of the law, as Dauid here reioyceth in the multitude of men, and in the arme of flesh. 4. Quest. Of Ioabs disswasion to the King not to number the people. 1. Hee sheweth that it belonged to God to increase the people, and that it was Dauids part thankefully to acknowledge Gods blessing therein: and not as it were to take vpon him Gods office, as though the people by beeing numbred could be increa∣sed. Borrh. 2. And secretly hee insinuateth, that Dauid should take heed, least by this meanes the numbers of the people might be diminished, which he desireth God to multiplie, and increase. 3. Hee further insinuateth that there was no end of numbring the people: for they all professed alreadie to be Dauids seruants, 1. Chron. 21.3. and therefore to that end, they needed not to be numbred. 4. Further, he foretelleth that this would be an occasion of trespasse in Israel; ibid. and that God beeing thereby offended, would punish his people: not for that they were numbred without that leauie appointed by Moses, as Mart. for Moses himselfe did not alwaies leauie that summe when he numbred the people, but Ioabs heart gaue him, because this proceeded from pride and carnall confidence, that the Lord would punish it. Genevens. 5. But notwithstanding these reasons alleadged by Ioab and the rest of the Princes and Captaines: Dauids word preuailed, for the Lord had determined vpon this oc∣casion to bring a plague vpon Israel. Borrh. 5. Quest. Of Ioabs iournie, when hee went to take muster. 1. Hee went first on the East side of the land of Canaan, passing ouer Iordan, by Aroer a citie of the Gadites, Numb. 32.34. and by the citie situate vpon the riuer of the Gadites, that is Ar, by the riuer Arnan, Deut. 2.8.35. then they went to Gilead, and so to the nether land newly obtained: which was recouered from the Hagarens in the daies of Saul, 1. Chron. 5.10.23. it is so better translated, then to make a proper name of it, Tachtim Chadshi, A.P.G.B. or the nether land of Chadshi. L.V. for there is no such place mentioned in all Ioshua. 2. Then they turned about on the North side by Daen Iaan called simply Dan, Iosh. 19.47. and by the ground and fields of Zidon: for the citie the Cananites possessed still, as they did likewise Tyrus. 3. So they compassed all the West coast along from Tyrus by the cities of the Hi∣vites and Cananites. 4. And then turned Southward to Beersheba: Ioab was 4. moneths and two daies in taking this suruaie, whereas the spies, which Moses sent, Numb. 13. returned in 40. dayes: for they staied not in any place to take the number of the people, as Ioab here did. 6. Quest. v. 9. Of the number, which Ioab returned vnto Dauid, differing from the number set downe 1. Chron. 21. In the Chronicles, the summe is an 1100. thousand of Israel, and 470. thousand of Iudah: whereas here are giuen vp in account to Dauid, but 800. thousand of Israel, and of Iudah 500. thousand. 1. Some thinke, there might be some errour in the mistaking of figures and numbers: Pellican: but it is daungerous to admit of the least errour in the origi∣nall.
2. Some thinke that Ioab thorough griefe gaue not vp the full number, which was taken, but as it is here: Genevens. in 1. Chron. 22. But the text saith, that Ioab gaue vp that number, 1. Chron. 21.5. 3. Osiander thinketh that in the account of 800. thousand the principall onely are reckoned: but in the number of an 1100. thousand the whole multitude: but here the number of Iudah is greater, then that in the Chronicles by 30. thousand: it is not like, that in the one number the principall onely should be counted, in the other the whole companie. 4. Some thinke that Ioab did make the number lesse then it was, least Dauid might haue beene lifted vp too much, after he knew the full number of the people, Emma. Sa. But it is said, 1. Chron. 21.5. that Ioab gaue vp the greater number also of Israel, and a lesse of Iudah: therefore this reason can not serue for both. 5. P. Martyr thinketh it may be thus, because Ioab did not number the Leuites, nor the Beniaminites, and it may be also he had not mustred those, which were in Ie∣rusalem, that the greater number was made vp afterward with them: and for Iudah, hee thinketh that the iust summe was 470. thousand, which is made vp here iust 500. thousand, because it is not vnusuall in Scripture, to set downe a round and perfect number for a more readie account, though somewhat be wanting, as to make vp 70. thousand to an 100. thousand. But it is euident in the Chronicles, that euen in that great summe which Ioab gaue vp to Dauid, neither the Leuites nor Beniamin were counted; the summe then is not made out of them: and concerning the number of Iudah, it were much, that there wanting 30. thousand of an 100. thousand, the scrip∣ture should set downe an 100. thousand. 6. Borrhaius saith, that whereas there is the oddes of 300. thousand betweene the number here rehearsed, and the other 1. Chron. 21. that in this smaller summe the or∣dinarie companies are not reckoned which serued by their turnes, 24. thousand eue∣ry moneth: which beeing multiplied by 12. according to the number of the moneths, maketh 288. thousand: then the Captaines set ouer them, which might haue euery one vnder his charge 24. maketh 12. thousand: and so the whole summe of 300. thou∣sand is made vp. Concerning Iudah, he thinketh that the number here is set downe, which was taken before the plague, the lesse number afterward: for there might die in the plague 30. thousand. 7. Iunius approoueth the first part of this last solution, touching the difference be∣tweene the numbers of the people for Israel: for the ordinarie companies of 24. thou∣sand, which were in a readinesse euery moneth by course, as is described 2. Chron. 27. needed not bee numbred: and ouer them were set their Captaines ouer thousands, nd hundreds, and other officers, which might make vp that summe of 300. thou∣sand. Concerning Iudah, it is not like, that there dying 70. thousand of the pestilence in all, 30. thousand, almost halfe that number, should be of Iudah. And beside, the ac∣count was giuen vp before the plague. Therefore Iunius maketh vp this number of 30. thousand, with the thirtie compa∣nies which belonged to the 30. Worthies, each of them beeing Captaine of a thou∣sand: which might be all of Iudah which was the Kings Tribe, and neerest to Ierusa∣lem: and so the iust summe of 500. thousand of Iudah will be made vp. This soluti∣on is most probable: Iosephus is here deceiued, who reckoneth 900. thousand of Isra∣el, and 400. thousand of Iudah: which number disagreeth both from the summe set downe here, and the other, 1. Chro. 21.5. 7. Quest. v. 10. Why and how Dauids heart smote him. 1. Dauid had continued in this sinne aboue nine moneths, all the time that Ioab spent in numbring the people: but now the sinne beeing full and compleat, his heart smiteth him: Mart. It is the propertie of Sathan, to extenuate sinne in the beginning, but when it is committed, then he doth aggrauate it, the more to terrifie the consci∣ence: Osiand. 2. It is like that Dauid had many motions before this, but now his con∣science is troubled indeed: for then the heart is effectually smitten and prepared to
repentance, when it pleaseth God to mooue it: Pellican. 3. Iosephus thinketh that this remorse was wrought in Dauid, Prophetis referentibus, diuere Prophets telling him he had offended: but it seemeth rather to haue beene wrought by the secret work of Gods spirit: for the Prophet Gad came to him afterward, when he had acknowled∣ged his sinne vnto God: Mart. 4. This smiting of Dauids heart, and confessing of his sinne, seemeth to haue beene in the night: for the Prophet came to Dauid, when hee was vp in the morning: for it was Dauids godly vse to call himselfe to account in the night: as he saith, Psal. 6.6. hee watered his couch with his teares in the night. 8. Quest. v. 13. Of the seauen yeares of famine offered to Dauids choice. In the Chronicles, c. 21.12. three yeares of famine onely are spoken of: 1. Some, to reconcile these places,Reconcil. thinke, that a certaine number is taken for an vncertaine, sea∣uen for many: but if the Prophet Gad, had propounded this offer vncertainely, Da∣uid could not haue made his choise. 2. Therefore we must here vnderstand, that three yeares of this famine were past alreadie, which was sent vpon the land for the crueltie of Saul toward the Gibeonits, c. 21.1. and this present yeare they had some relaxation from the famine by seasonable weather, and three yeares of famine should follow afterward. Iun. 3. Some others, following the same account for the yeares past, yet varie for the yeares to come, making them to be fowre, three of famine, and the fourth and last yeare also must for the most part be spent in that scarcitie till haruest: Mart. Vatab. but then from the beginning of the 3. yeares famine, which were alreadie compleat and past, and now they were in the fourth, if foure more followed, there should be eight yeare in all: the former solution therefore of Iunius is better. 9. Quest. v. 13. Of the choice of three plagues offered vnto Dauid. 1. Dauid hauing here confessed his sinne, receiued not the like answer now by the Prophet Gad, as before vpon the like confession of his sinne: the Prophet Nathan said vnto him, the Lord hath put away thy sin: the reason of which difference is this, that there Dauid slept in his sinne, till the Prophet awaked him: but here Dauids heart smote him, and he had prayed, that the Lord would take away his sinne, which he was assured of, so that there remained nothing, but some temporall chasticement, and correction, which the Lord purposed to send vpon Israel, and therefore this onely was giuen in charge to the Prophet. 2. And whereas hee propoundeth simply these iudgements of warre, famine, and pestilence, yet many other calamities must be vnderstood to concurre with them: as in warre, burning of the cities, spoyling and laying wast of their grounds, raushing of their women: famine is accompained with vnseasonable weather, as immoderate raine, or drought, and the breeding of caterpillers and other vermine: and the pesti∣lence is ioyned with other diseases, as burning feauers, gripings, and such like. 3. But it will be asked, why the Prophet doth not as well giue him direction, what to choose, as to make the offer: the Hebrewes thinke, whereas the last word of Gods speach is dabhar, what word shall I answer to him that sent me: that in that word he insi∣nuateth, what Dauid should make choice of: for the same word dabhar, with the chaunging of some points, signifieth the pestilence. But this obseruation seemeth to be somewhat curious. Dauid needed not any particular direction for this choice, which he as a prudent and religious man, might easily discerne of: specially God so moouing him by his spirit. Mart. 10. Quest. v. 14. Of the choice which Dauid made to fall rather into the hands of God. 1. Although the other two calamities of the sword, and of famine, are sent by the hand of God, and are gouerned by him, yet in them he vseth other instruments, as of the sword of men in warre, and of other deuouring creatures in famine: hee chooseth therefore to fall into the hands of God onely: for the pestilence is immediatly sent of God, and onely is his worke. 2. In the pestilence, which God smiteth with, there is more mercie then when the
sword of man is drawen forth: for then none are spared: Osiand. And we beare more patiently the Lords rod, then the hand of man: and we are onely here to humble our selues vnto God, whereas in warre, the enemie which preuaileth is also to be sued vn∣to. Mart. 3. So Dauid in this choice, sheweth his prudencie, charitie, pietie: prudencie in choosing the lesse euill: charitie in wishing such a calamitie to come, which was com∣mon as well to the Prince as people, for none are exempted from the pestilence, rather then that which should lie most vpon the people: for in warre the weakest, and in fa∣mine the poorest, are most afflicted: his pietie appeareth, because in warre the ene∣mie preuailing would take occasion to blaspheme, and in famine, they should be for∣ced to craue the helpe of straunge nations to releeue them: Dauid therefore desireth onely to depend vpon God. 11. Quest. How Dauid chooseth it as the easier punishment to fall into Gods hands. The Apostle saith to the Hebrewes, c. 10.31. It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God: yet Dauid thinketh it here beter to fall into the hands of God, then of men.Reconcil. 1. But it must be considered that the Apostle there speaketh of such sinnes, whereby the Lord is prouoked, as of despiting the spirit of grace, and counting the blood of the Testament an vnholy thing: for such to fall into the hāds of God it is a grieuous thing: but here Dauid speaketh of the temporall punishments which are inflicted by the Lord, which are more easie & profitable, then those which are executed by man. Mart. 2. Dauid also speaketh of such chastisements which the Lord imposeth with a fatherly affection, and in loue, seeking the amendment of his children. But the Apostle speaketh of such punishments as are inflicted by the Lord, as an angrie Iudge. Osiand. 12. Quest. v. 15. How long the pestilence continued, and what is vnderstood by the appointed time. 1. Some think this appointed time was the space of 36. houres, that is halfe the three daies, the rest the Lord remitted in mercie at the supplication of Dauid: but no such space is here mentioned, or appointed. 2. The Chalde expoundeth it of the time of the euening sacrifice, which was a set and appointed time, as well as the morning: so also Rupertus, Vatab. Emman. Sa: but seeing the morning was an appointed time, as well as the euening for sacrifice: this ap∣pointed time in this sense may as well be vnderstood of the next morning, as of the e∣uening. 3. Iosephus thinketh that this pestilence endured from morning til noone: for as D. Kimhi saith, there are three seasons of the day, which may be called appointed times, the morning, noone, and euentide: but the text speaketh of some time appointed here. 4. Therefore because there was an other time appointed by the Prophet, but the tearme of three daies, it is like that the plague so long continued. Iun. Osiand. 5. But then it will be thus obiected: 1. That God should not then be said to repent him, if nothing had beene reuersed of the former sentence, wherein the Lord doth not shew himselfe mutable: but such threatnings are conditionall, as that was against Ninniveh: vpon Dauids repentance the time was shortned: 2. Neither needed the Angel haue beene bidden by the Lord to hold his hand, if the time of three daies were expired: Mart. But hereunto it may be answered: 1. That God is said to repent him, after the phrase of man, not onely of that which hee purposed to doe, but of that also, which he hath done: as Gen. 6.6. it repented him, that hee had made man: as there his iustice is signified by that phrase, because he purposed to destroie man, as if he had not beene made: so here his mercie is insinuated in hauing compassion vpon the peo∣ple, as if hee had beene some for their harmes. 2. The Angel is bid o stay his hand, it beeing now the third day: so that all this day the Angel might haue gone on smiting, if the Lord had not staied him: the third day was now begunne, but not compleat and finished.
13. Quest. v. 15. Of the greatnesse of the plague which was sent vpon Israel. 1. Iosephus thus describeth the manner of this plague, that it tooke some suddn∣ly with great paine, and bitter pangs, who so died: some lingred longer of the dis∣ease, and died vnder the Phisitians hands; some were all of a suddaine smitten with blindnesse, and at once depriued of the sight of their eyes, and the light of their life: some as they went to burie their dead, fell downe dead themselues. 2. The number which died of this plague within the compasse of these three daies, was 40. thousand: so many men died, that Dauid might be punished in the same thing, wherein he had sinned; hee was lifted vp in mind because of the multitude and numbers of the pople, and now their numbers are diminished and empaired. Osiand. 3. It is like that ma∣ny women and children might be swept away with the pestilence: but they are num∣bred to the plague, who before were numbred for ostentation. And it is not vnlike, but that many good men tasted of this temporall chasticement, as Daniel and Ieremie went into captiuitie. Mart. 14. Quest. v. 16. How the Lord is said to repent him of the euill. 1. The Lord is not as man, that hee should repent: but he is so said to repent, be∣cause of the effects of those which repent, which is to cease and to giue ouer, as they doe, which doe repent them of any thing: and in that sense the Lord here repenteth, because he biddeth the Angel stay his hand. Mart. 2. Beside, this phrase sheweth the inclination of God vnto mercie, like as a father is grieued, when hee is forced to cor∣rect his sonne, and had rather that no cause were giuen him of such chasticement. O∣siand. 3. God spared Ierusalem at Dauids intercession, because it was the place which he had appointed for his Sanctuarie: Pellican. 4. But God herein altereth not, nor chaungeth: but as he had determined to spare Ierusalem, so likewise he had appoin∣ted the meanes, to shew this mercie at the supplication of Dauid: which though it be set downe after, yet he first at the sight of the Angel humble himselfe, and then the Lord repented him of the euill. 15. Quest. Of Dauids humbling himselfe, and offring to be punished for the people. 1. It pleased God that the Angel should be seene in a visible shape with a sword in his hand, that Dauid thereby might be mooued and stirred vp to humble himselfe: and that the Lord thereupon might shew mercie. 2. Hee confesseth his sinne, not ac∣cusing the Lord as of iniustice, that he had smitten the people vndeserued: but their sinnes he knew not, his own he knew, which had iustly deserued that plague. 3. Herein Dauid sheweth himselfe a most louing shepherd to his people and subiects, tat offe∣reth himselfe vnto the daunger for them: that he and his house, which were the prin∣cipall in this action of numbring the people, might answer the punishment. Chryso∣stome writeth, that the shepheards in Cappadocia haue such a loue vnto their flocke, that sometime for three dayes together in following them,Hom. 15. Epist. ad Roman. they are ouerwhelmed with the snowe, and yet they endure it: and in Lydia how farre they trauaile with their sheepe for a moneth together in the wat deserts, and parching heat of the Sun: who therein, doe teach such as are shepheards of men, that they should euen not spare their owne liues for their common good. 4. Diuerse among the Heathen; as Godru, the Curij, Decij, did aduenture and gaue their liues for their countrie; but they did i in a vaine ostentation, seeking therein their owne praise, or in a ciuill respect onely of honestie: but this offer of Dauid proceedeth from true haritie wrought by faith. 5. Now Dauid, all the time of this plague humbled himselfe, as is most lik, in praier vnto God: but vpon the sight of the Angel he i more effectually mooued wih com∣passion: and especially because Ierusalem, which was the citie and glorie of the king∣dome, was now next: And hitherto Dauid offred not himselfe to the plague, because as Chrysostome coniectureth,Chrisost. ibid. he still expected and made account himselfe to be taken away in his plague: but now, seeing that it was Gods will to spare him, he doth vo∣luntarily offer himselfe.

Quest. 16. v. 21. Why Dauid buildeth an Altar vnto God in the threshing floore of Araunah. 1. It pleased God to make choice of this place, because it pleased him there to haue a house built vnto himselfe: and why here rather then at Gilgal, Silo, Nob, Mis∣pah, Gibeon, where the Tabernacle was at this present? no other reason can be giuen, then because it so pleased God: as in the daies of Elias, there were many widowes, yet the Prophet Elias was onely sent to the widowe of Sarepta: Mart. 2. This bee∣ing the principall cause, yet other things concurred: this was the same place the hill Moriah, where Abraham would haue sacrificed Isaac: and in the same place, namely at Ierusalem, Christ the sonne of God offered vp himselfe in sacrifice. 3. And in this place the benefit was receiued: there the Angel held his hand, and put vp his sword in∣to his sheath, as it is said 1. Chron. 21.27. therefore in that verie place Dauid offered sacrifice to shew his thankefulnesse. 4. And an other reason is yeilded why in that place Dauid built an Altar, because beeing afraid of the sword of the Angel, and the daunger beeing present, he could not goe vnto Gibeon, where the Tabernacle then was. 1. Chro. 21.30. Quest. 17. v. 23. What this Araunah the Iebu∣site was. 1. Hee is called also Ornan, 1. Chron. 21. it was no straunge thing in those daies for one to be called by diuerse names: or he beeing a straunger his name might be some∣what altered in the pronuntiation, as names are when they are vsed or taken vp in a straunge language: Mart. 2. For his nation and kinred, Kimhi thinketh he was not a Iebusite, for they were Cananites, and commanded to be rooted out: he rather ta∣keth it, he was of the race of Abimelech: But the text saith he was a Iebusite, which is of a more credite, then any other humane coniecture: though he were a Iebusite, yet he might be spared, beeing conuerted to the faith of Israel. 3. Some thinke, he had beene the King of the Iebusites, Vatab. Osiand. and that by his meanes the fort of Sion was deliuered vp: but these things are vncertaine: he is in deed called a king, v. 23. in respect of his princely liberalitie, v. 23. Genevens. and it is like he was some princi∣pall man among his owne nation, and of great authoritie. Borrh. for it seemeth by this that all the Iebusites were not expelled Ierusalem, but there remained some either conuerted to their faith, or else they became tributarie and seruants vnto them: sure it is, that he was one of Dauids chiefe freinds, and was spared, when the rest of the Ie∣busites were ouercome at the taking of the fort of Sion: Ioseph. 4. In that Dauid commeth to build an Altar in the ground of a straunger, it was an euident type of the vocation of the Gentiles, among whome the Lord would haue his Church. Mart. Quest. 18. Of Araunah his liberalitie, and why David refused it. 1. Araunah in this bountifull offer to the King, to giue him both oxen for the sacri∣fice, and other instruments for wood, sheweth the liuely fruites of faith in those that are truely conuerted vnto God: Mart. and he was a type of the Gentiles, who bee∣ing called to the faith of Iesus, thought nothing too deare for Gods seruice: Pelli∣can. 2. Yet Dauid would not accept of this kindnesse, both in regard of Araunah, whose ground he would not take from him: for beeing once consecrated vnto the worship of God, it could no more returne to the former owner, or be priuately vsed: and in respect of himselfe, he would not offer vnto God a meane thing, not in it selfe, but because it cost Dauid nothing: and so the seruice should haue beene done rather by Araunah then by Dauid: Dauid therefore here according to that saying of Salo∣mon; Honour the Lord with thy riches, Prov. 3.9. would offer vnto God of his owne, and not of an others. Mart. Quest. 19. v. 24. Of the price which Dauid bought Arau∣nahs threshing floore at. Here it is said that he bought the threshing floore and the oxen for 50. sheckles of siluer: but 1. Chron. 21.15. it is thus written, that he gaue for the place 600. shekles
of gold by weight. 1. The Hebrewes say, that because this place was to serue for a publike vse to build a Temple in, euerie tribe gaue 50. sheckles, which counting 12. tribes, maketh in all 600. sheckles: and that the sheckles were gathered in siluer, and by Dauid tur∣ned into gold: But this purchase was made vpon the present: Dauid had no time to make any such collection among the tribes. 2. Some thinke that Dauid gaue 50. sheckles at the first, vpon the purchase, and afterward 600. sheckles of his liberalitie: ex Martyr. but it is not like, that Dauids franke gift should so much exceed the iust price. 3. Some thinke that Dauid gaue 50. sheckles for some part, and bought as much afterward, as came to 550. sheckles more: Genevens. but these two summes can not be put together: for the 50. were of siluer, and the 600. of gold. 4. Neither was the 50. sheckles for the oxen, and the 600. sheckles of gold for the threshing floore: Borrh. which amounteth to a 1500. dollors, that is, so many ownces of siluer or fiue shilling peeces: Iun. for it is like that not the bare threshing floore was valued at so much. 5. Therefore the best solution is, that he gaue 50. sheckles of siluer for the oxen onely, which make about 12. dollors: and for the whole place, and ground with the houses, where the Temple was afterward built, 600. sheckles of gold. Iun. Mart. Mont. de sicli partib. lib. de mensur. sacris in appar. Quest. 20. v. 25. How it was lawfull for Dauid to build an Altar here, there neither beeing the Arke nor Ta∣bernacle. 1. Dauid did not this of himselfe: for Gad was admonished by the Angel to speake vnto Dauid, there to build an Altar: So it is like, when the holy men of God of∣fered in the high places, that they did it not without Gods direction, though it be not alwaies expressed: 2. Now whereas the Tabernacle was at Gibeon at this time, where most of the Preists gaue their attendance: yet there were also diuerse, and the cheefe of them, as Zadok and Abiathar, which kept with the Arke at Ierusalem: c. 15.25. 3. Beside an other reason is yeilded, why Dauid could not goe to Gibeon: because he was afraid of the sword of the Angel, and it might be was stricken with some infir∣mitie, at the least he was in great feare, because of the present daunger. 4. This Altar here built was a type of the true Altar Christ Iesus, who was to suffer at Ierusalem: So the Apostle calleth Christ the Altar, Hebr. 13.10. that place therefore serueth not to prooue, that there ought to be still any materiall altars in the Church. But Tonstall re∣plieth: that of that Altar they haue no authoritie to eate, but Christ is to be eaten: ther∣fore he is not meant by that altar. Contra. The words following must be weighed: they haue no authoritie to eate, which serue in the Tabernacle: but they which are vnder the Gospel, doe eate of this Altar. Mart. Quest. 21. v. 25. Of the Lords acceptance of Dauids sa∣crifice. 1. God shewed his acceptance, in that he answered Dauid in sending fire from hea∣uen: 1. Chron. 11.26. as Aarons sacrifice, Leuit. 9. was approoued by fire from heaun: so also Gedeons by fire out of the rocke, Iudg. 6.21. and Helias sacrifice was set on fire from heauen, 1. King. 18.38. Mart. for otherwise it was not lawfull to vse any straunge fire, not taken from the Altar, as appeareth by the punishment of Nadab and Abihu, Leuit. 10.1. Genevens. 2. This sacrifice wa not acceptable in it selfe, but as it was a type of Christ, and offred by faith in him: it beeing also ioyned with the prai∣ers of Dauid, and of the rest of the people. In Christ then both our altar and sacrifice God is well pleased, by whom we are deliuered from euerlasting plagues, as now Isra∣el was from this temporall: To whom be ascribed all praise for euer. Amen. FINJS.
