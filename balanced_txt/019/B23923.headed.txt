The Hard CASE OF THE GLASS-MAKERS Of England, and the Danger of losing the said Manu∣facture, by reason of the Duties laid upon Glass-Wares, most Humbly Represented to this Honourable House. INasmuch as the said Duty (if continued) will unavoidable prove the Ruine of the Artists, who have, to the great Advantage of this Nation, brought the Glass-Manufacture to very great Perfection, even to a Prohibition of the Importation thereof. 1st, For the Reason Glass before the said Duty was Sold as cheap as possible, to get a Livelyhood thereby. 2dly, The said Duty hath so lessened the Consumption of Glass, that one third part of the Glass made the last Quarter, lyes on the Makers Hands; and the Consumption grows lesser and lesser every Day: By which means the Maker is forced to Sell his Glass 20 per Cent. Cheaper then before the said Duty, rather than to have their Glass lye on their Hands, to break and grow out of Fashion, (as it will do) and want Money to pay Wages to Workmen, who by Contract before the said Duty, they are obliged to Imploy, or pay them Play-Wages for nothing. Which being considered, must unavoidably Ruine the Maker in a short time, and then consequently the Workmen must be Ruined, and forced into Ireland, Scotland, and other Places to get Bread; which Places are so sensible of Matter of Fact, as already to Erect Works for their Reception; which, if not prevented, must unde∣niable prove the Loss of Glass-Manufacture to this Nation. It is therefore most Humbly Hoped, the Members of this Ho∣nourable House, will take into their serious Consideration the Ruine of the poor Workmen (some of which have not had 14 Days Work, since the Commencement of the said Duty) and be Grati∣ously pleased to prevent the same; especially considering the said Duty is very inconsiderable to the Crown; it being most evident, and plainly to be made appear, the Duty of what Glass was made the last Quarter, did not amount to 5000 l. out of which the Draw∣back and Collecting must be Deducted, and then not 3000 l. will be coming to the Crown; and that is more then any following Quar∣ter will produce, for the Reasons aforesaid.
