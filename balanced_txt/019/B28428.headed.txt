A PROPOSAL For Preserving and Encouraging the Woollen-Manufactures in divers Parts of this Kingdom. WHEREAS very great Numbers of Foreigners, as well as Natives of this Kingdom have of late Years resorted to the City of London, and Parts adjacent, and have set up the Making almost all sorts of Silk, and Woollen Manufactures, to the great Prejudice of se∣veral remoter Parts of this Nation; and to the Debasing of divers sorts of Manufacturers, and Damage of Trade: Which Mischiefs are daily Increasing, and, if not timely Prevented, may prove very Destructive to the Trade of the Woollen and Silk-Manufactures in the remoter Parts, and of very Dangerous Consequence to this Kingdom. For Remedy whereof it is humbly Proposed, THAT from and after the  Day of  no Person whatsoever shall be Imployed in the weaving of any Silk, or Woollen Manufactures, within the said City of London, or within  Miles thereof; but such as are now Inhabitants therein, and have a Right so to do; or such as hereafter shall have a Right, by serving an Apprenticeship to the Weaving-Trade, within the said City or Limits aforesaid. THAT no Weaver shall have above a Certain Num∣ber of Apprentices at any one time. THAT all Apprentices be Bound at Weavers-Hall in the said City: And none Bound for less than Seven Years. By which means the present Legal Workmen will be Preserved and Incouraged in their Trades; the Extravagant Increase of Weavers in the said City and Limits, Re∣strained; the Manufactures and Manufacturers, in the re∣moter Parts of this Kingdom, Incouraged and Preserved from Ruine. All which is humbly submitted to Consideration.
