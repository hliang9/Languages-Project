A New Fiction, As We were. JORNADA 1. Enter (as at two Doors) Protestation and Common-prayer. Prot. 'TIs even so! C. Good old friend Protestation. P. Old Common-prayer! By what new Order? C. C. Even — Enter (as after Common-prayer) Allegiance. A. Well met all three, Let this be Diurnall'd. P. In good time. But as you were saying. C. Even the same that was from the beginning. The Law has new taken breath: and I am bound (ye know) to take notice of it. P. Good, A. Very good I trow. Come, Friends all now. Is't not? Enter (as after Protestation) Sr. Solemn. S. All making Friends What then becomes of Covenants blessed ends? A. What say you, Sir? Have we not yet had ends enough? I hope you would not, or you shall not see yet an utter end of All. S. Of all Impi∣ety and Prophanness though. C. Agreed. A. Agreed. P. Agreed S. Agreed by all! How can this be? You, Protestation, not for Popery. A. Nor I. C. Nor I. S. Nor you? nor you? I fear. C. But we fear nothing. A. We're on sure ground. S. Con∣demn'd. Ambo. Unheard. S. The Bill (you know) was found. One speaks not out Supremacy: the other Plainly draws down the Daughter from the Mother. A. Where was Supremacy, when you found that Bill? S. In Parliament And there it will be still. A. With the Kings Headship. Thus far Papists go, Come you not short of them. In doing so You justifie, what yet you would condemn. S. We justifie our selves, gainst you and them. C. Let Popery stand or fall. All's one to me, Excepted in your Bill from Popery. S. In some respect. But yet you are not free. C. Till faulty found by just Supremacy. S. In's lawful Politick capacity. Enter Engage∣ment. A. See you but who comes here? S. We  him not. He has in us no part, nor Scot, nor
E. Yet, by your leave, as good an interest. In a free King and Parliament, as the best. Shall the whole Body scor-free hoise up saile? And the Lot fall so heavy on the Taile? S. You speak, as if you lately came from School; A Camisado of the Birchin tool. E. Has that old Ape transported you so soon; To make you all turn Mimikes the first Moon? S. Which of us chang'd? E. Y'are changling Monkeys all, Fye on this mock-show This is your Whites-Hall. C. Now 'tis out Is't not? E. Out and let it be, Out, or In, All; Excepted none for me. It is a common Case, The cause ye know) The good Old Cause, the same for weal and Woe: The Cause was yours, first; deny it not: Then, yours; and carried on with Scot and Lot. S. Who were the Keepers of our Liberties? E. who acted in your Kings Capacities? Prerogative and Legal. To proceed, Is not to innovate, when once agreed. For, or against: I did but prosecute, What you began; I did but execute, What you design'd. S. To lay aside (for shame;) The power; both name and thing! E. The very same. P. O. times! S. I; Times they were indeed, that by degrees. Drew out the Brewing to the very Lees. The Lees you like not; yet the Barme, your own; So was the Brewer too; as will be shown. S. Hee's drunk. E. Tis then with pledging you. P. you drank, Too deep. E. All was but what was left, I thank You for'. Twas but a very little Snuff, I was well satisfy'd you had enough. S. Oh impudence! Did we not all we might. To hinder such wrong doing and keep Right? E. You did indeed keep all the right you cou'd. But why shou'd you have all? yet 'tis made good,
This very act was yours: next to be done. As near a kin, as Father is to Son. For, stand we not upon one bottome all? One common Principle elenchical! Common-Supremacy: the Peoples right: The Commons due, clear as the Noon-day light. You, Protestation, first began to stride, Before what ever since was laid aside. One common Juno is our Mother known: Withour a Jove, such Martial brood to own. 'Twas you, who first Declar'd the Name of King, Whilest you Usurpt the power, an useless thing. The Beast from Horns to Hoofs is still the same: From Forty one to Fifty. And the Name Of Fifty nine shews, one Cow Calv'd us all. Brothers, together let's or stand, or fall. S. Brother us no Brothers, far from our intent, We ever were for King and Parliament. E. Ye were, so far as serv'd your turn to say, You had his Office. But supply'd (I pray) By whom? Who did Le Roys avisera, Whilest He was inter quatuor Maria? Oh! With what kindness you met at Edge-hill! How Love betwixt you shew'd his utmost skill! What Complements 'twixt Him and your Gallant! Your prime Gallant! But what! Here comes our last! Enter Instrument. See, what a Nose he has! I The worst has past. S. H'as smelt us out. P. Smelt we so strong of Blood! C. He looks, as it he would be understood! A. Beyond expression. I. Hangs my Nose in your light! Time was you follow'd it; and then went right: When from the Rising to the Setting Sun, Clocks, Dialls, Glasses, measur'd all was done, By this Majestick Standard of all motion; The length of ev'ry ones days at my Devotion. The longest hour of life and last of Death, Kings, Lords and Commons shaddow'd by my breath.
I pray'd and preach'd, I fasted and I fought: And never rested whilst for you I wrought. For you (I say) by you, and with you all, All that I did, I did; in great and small. You threw out Kingship; I maintain'd your Act: The Cards were often shuffeld, often pact. Then came I up: your servant of the Sword, Hight Constable. Me thinks you should afford Some better measure to so good a friend, Who made and kept your Peace unto the end. You know, I was no lawful Magistrate: But Sing'lat Minister of a lawlesse Stare. Thus am I but your Creature. Why should you, Making your own peace, make so much ado To hinder mine? 'Twas you good Protestation, First took me in, to save your reputation. And well you might. You onely could maintaine, God and the King, against the Pope and Spain. So much you had retrench'd your former Vow, Made at the Font, (as I may tell you now) Against the whole malignant World; not that Spot only, which brought up some elvish Brat Of that old Whore of Babylon. By which breach. My then-new-Sainted Horse let in to Preach, Taught your cast Serving-men and Tapsters, how To stand their ground, and win the masterie. Great was the Company of Preachers then: Kings with their Armies then began to flee. My Horse and I had thanks. Thus you may see, How Right at first gave Might, then Might made Right: Your Right to let me in to get your Might: Your Armies first; and then your Parliaments. S. What? Will he ne'r ha'done? A. These Instruments. Of your Commands have taught you to obey. I. I'm almost out of breath: yet this shall say, Your Might so got made new Right ev'ry way. If you were Right; How could I then be wrong? The Spirit you acted by in me was strong.
That be my Charge. What you had in projection, 'Twas I alone that brought unto perfection. I was in Covenant with your Spirit: the Letter I left to such who understood no better. 'Twas that enabled me to work such wonders; Strange even to your selves, as Sky-clear-thunders. It was a Noon-day Spirit, with new Light Through so much darknesse guided us aright. He led us all. Your selves confess'd it oft: Whilest some admir'd, others vainly Scoft. You vail'd; I knew Him well; I did in truth: H' was my Familiar, in very sooth. He gave and took that all-commanding breath, Which in these Nostrils gave the Law to death. My time being come, our Covenants well t'agree, That Spirits acting left the world with me. Now the Tide's turn'd: Rivers do now run back, Over my Head laid low, through Hands grown slack, To purge thy Heart out, (yet thou wilt not see, The only help is wholly to agree) Thou faithlesse Land, accurst Oceaena, Since th'art become one great Akeldama. God and the King depos'd by th' Peoples Right, Have try'd Leviathans utmost lawless might. Think not, your hollow dawbing will endure, Be wise betime: Save, or Lose all; be sure; For, though the King look only at th'effect; Foregoing Causes God cannot neglect. S. Hee's mad: and rants in King Cambyses veine, I. The sad Accomptant of your losse and Gaine. To Saintship and Kingship-Conspiracie: An universal full Apostacy. Exit Instrument. A. He has spoke sence. S. What? not the sense o'th'House. Irruunt Constables, Beadles, &c. 1. C. What? Had they done? 2. C. They're gone. I thought we should make thee House too hot for'm. 1. C. What house? 2. C. This, this same paltry Play-house of theirs. Your poyets (as they call um) why they will make you an House of any thing,
and any thing of an House, to serve their turn. These Players (I have heard our Minister say) are in plain Greek such very Hypo∣crites. 1. B. Whoop Holliday! What have we here? George o' Horse-back! Upon the Post there! Don't ye see? 2. B. For Gods sake! How does he kill the Dragon? 1. B. E'en (as 't please the Painter, I'le warrant. 2. B. Ho! Whats this? 1. C. An old Bishops square Cap. Is't not? 1. B. And here's another like it. 2. C. A Judges, this; it should be. Let's see. We han't lost our labour yet. 1. C. I believe, they had not quite done, they're gone in such hast. 2. C. The fools had ne'r left their bawbles behind them, if they had not been frighted. What? a Vizzard too? Who was this for, trow? What a Nose it has! 1. B. I would we could ha' lit but upon some of um. 2. B. I don't think, but if we light handsomely upon their Master over the way yonder, we shall make some good discovery yet among his Truhans. 1. B. Pish! Hee's. 1. C. Well neighbour, what has been the businesse? N. Come if you'l walk away, I'le tell you. Abscedunt Constables, Beadles, &c. Chorus of By-standers. VIVE LE ROY. 1660. Par l' Autheur. C'Est presqu' en ce temps cy un mot celebrieux, Par Grecs & par Latins & par des Hebrieux, Jesu de Nazaret & Charles d'Angle terre, La fin de l'un & de l'autre, des meurtriers la guerre. J. C.
