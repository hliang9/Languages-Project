THE CHARACTER OF A TAVERN. With A brief draught of a DRAWER. LONDON, Printed for D. A. 1675.
THE Character OF A TAVERN, &c. ATavern is an Academy of Debauchery, where the Devil teaches the seven deadly sins instead of Sciences, a Tipling-School a degree above an Ale-house, where you may be drunk with more Credit and A∣pology, 'tis the Randevouz of Gallants, the Good Fellows Paradice, and the Misers Terrour, who fits here in fear of his Life because of the shot; A Map of the World, where all humours are drawn in Epi∣tome,
and the best Theatre of Natures and Dispositions, which are here truly Acted not Plaid; A melancholly man may find matter enough to divert him, to see Heads as Brittle as Glasses, and as often broken, to ob∣serve men both come hither to Quarrel, and come hi∣ther to be made Friends, so that if the simile were not already worn thredbare, I would call it Telephus's Sword that both makes wounds and cures them. Tis an Engine of the largest size, for draining the Pocket, the common Consumption of the Afternoon, and the maker away of a Rainy day, a Torrid Zone that scorches their Faces that long Inhabit it, whilst Tobac∣co is the Gun powder that blows them up, so that much danger were to be dreaded if the Charitable Vintner should not have store of Water ready to allay these Flames; House of Sin you may call it, but not a House of Darkness, For the Candles are seldom out, and it is like those Countries near the North-Pole, where 'tis as clear at midnight as at mid day. 'Tis a Bedlam of Wits, where men ate rather mad than merry, here one breaking a Jest on the Drawer, or perhaps a Candlestick or Bottle over his Crown, there another repeating scraps of old Plays, or some Bawdy Song, this speaking Latine, and a fourth Non∣sence, whilst all with loud hooting and laughing con∣found the noise of Fidlers, who are properly call'd a Noise, for no Musick can be heard for them; 'Tis a Ba∣bel
of Voices, a Gallimans fry of Opinions, and an Hodge Podge of Nations, you shall hear one talking very gravely of Religion, and another Ranting, and swearing Dammee, and Sink mee, at the same instant, parties of different Sects and perswasions will meet here, and be sociable though not at Church; And below in the Cel∣lar you shall see the French and the Spanish, with the Natives of the Rhine (notwithstanding the present Wars between them) lye quietly altogether. As you come in to shew that you are going to a Tryal of your Lives, you must first appear at the Bar, where Madam Minks with her Head behung with as many Toys as their Bush, sits like the Goddess Semele (Mo∣ther of Bacchus) under her all-commanding Canopy, Casting the Nativityes of your Estates in strange Aegyp∣tian Hieroglyphicks and Trithemian Characters; And finds by the Horoscope of the Board, and frequent Ill Directions of Score in the Half Moon, That your For∣tunes are short-liv'd, and your Purses declining into an Irrevocable Consumption; Next the Blew Apron'd Cap∣tain of this Inchanted Castle comes into view, you wou'd take him for a Hogshead set on two stumps, and mov'd by Scrues or Clockwork, for his Belly is big e∣nough for a Popish Limbus, yet coming nearer, you may discern somewhat like that which in Men they call a Face, but broader then the Pewter Platter in Sr. Johns-street, and studded and embost all over with vices Heraldry.
In the midst of which his Nose blazes like a Comet, and infallibly pretends drought: He thinks nature gave him a Mouth, not so much to speak, as to drink off his Liquor, For that is the main use he puts it to, and of all the miracles that ever Christ did, he thinks none so meritorious, As the turning Water into Wine, which he himself often endeavours to imitate. These Animals we must pray, intreat, crave, be∣seech, and implore for a Bottle that's neat and brisk, and Racy, and at last go without it, unless we bribe Death's Emissaries, those Dregs and Lees of Morta∣lity, your yaulìng, impudent, saucy, nimble-tongued A-non-a-non Sirs, to whom once more you must beg as heartily as a Condemn'd Man does for a Reprieve, That they would gratiously be pleased not to poison you at your own charge; Indeed there is scarce a Pint true, wholsome and right drank, which the Guests do not twice pay for, first to the Drawer, and then to the Master, and there is more Wine vended in a year, in this one over-grown City, under the notion of Cana∣ry, than the whole Canaries produce; But there lies the Excellency and Mistery of the Trade, he that is best at Brewing and Balderdashing Wines is most e∣steemed, and this they call managing a Cellar, the end of which is to cheat Mens Palates, and the effect to destroy their Bodies: The Pharmacopeia of a Mounte∣bank, or the Quackeries of Moor fields, befriend not the Grave-makers, so much as these Squires of the Spig∣got do; for Pandora's Box never gave vent to the Tyth
of those mischiefs that are broached with a Pip of so∣phisticated Wine, which makes me fancy when they Ring for the Boy to fetch t'other Pint, that I hear the Passing bell of those that send for it. And when the splay mouth'd Rascals cry, D'ye call Sir, Methinks it sounds like Charons Voice summoning us to his Ferry-boat: To hear them baul out their Hypocritical wel come, the Satyr would as much wonder as at the Man, that blew hot and cold: For they welcome when you go in, and welcome when you go out, and yet 'tis not you are welcome at all, but your Money. Nor is it only with their Cups (like Circe) that they inchant us, they can help you to a dainty morsel too at Luculluses price; Their Fricacies and Phagon's, Dishes you must pay four times over for. First, for the meat. Secondly, for dressing. Thirdly, for sausce. And Fourth∣ly, for the hard name; When they provide you a Din∣ner, you were better keep open house all Christmas, their Extravagant Treats in the great Chamber, serve only to debauch the Hospitality of private Families, and are most effectual decoys, where a young Bride∣groom many times spends half his Wives Portion for the conveniency of Dancing and Fiddles; Let the Room be never so neat when you come in, after a lit∣tle fitting, It becomes like the street after a dashing shower, where the Spouts are flushing above, and the Conduits running below, whilst the Iordans like swel∣ling Rivers over-flow their Banks, and the Urine
drops through the Ceiling into the mouth of him that sits under; In brief, a Tavern is a Scene of Confusion; A Gulf to swallow up a Mans Money, and his time, which is yet more pretious; a Nursery of Extravagancy, and a necessary place for Assignations between Cracks and their Cullies. FINIS.
