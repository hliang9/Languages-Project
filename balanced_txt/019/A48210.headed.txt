A LETTER To a VIRTUOUS LADY, To Disswade her from her Resolution of being A NUN. This may he Printed, February the 19th, 1685. R. P. REcall this Resolution, or you'l prove A Renegade to Nature, and to Love: He that did form all Creatures for Increasing, Made Fruitful Amity the first great Blessing, Why were you made a Woman? Why were we (By different Sex) put in Capacity Of getting Children? You cross Gods Decree; You will live single, does not every thing Contribute to the Store-House of the Spring: Beasts, Fish, Fowls, Grain; one Ear of Corn will yield, (With Husbandry) enough to fill a Field: Were every thing Fruitless (as you would be) You'd Eat the Walls down of your Nunnery. But your Transgression unto Love is such, As no Man's Pen can aggravate too much;
Were those Blew Veins, Red Lips, White Hands, Black Ey's, Made only for a Vestal Sacrifice? But you reply, 'Tis to prevent those Crimes, And hot Allurements, which pollute the Times: Madam, are you so weak, or Sin so stout, That nothing but Stone-Walls can keep it out? Æ²lisses when he fear'd to be Imbrac'd By Syrens, bound himself to the Ships Mast; Because he found his Soul so much inclin'd Unto Temptation, did his Body bind; And is it so with you? must you needs run This Tempting Race, unless y'have Fetters on? Are Maids so frail, can Virgins find no trick For Chastity, but to be Buried Quick? And yet when all this streight preventions wrought, Not all your Walls, nor Bars, can keep out Thought: In my conceipt those Hearts have fimest Stations, That can be Chast in spight of all Temptations. Chast Wedlock was at first design'd, that we Might not Abuse, but keep our Chastity. You may do so, and yet not Live alone, That Woman's Chast enough that knows but one: Stop your Resolve then e're it farther runs, For Virtuous Wives are better than some Nuns. FINIS. LONDON, Printed for John Harris, 1686.
