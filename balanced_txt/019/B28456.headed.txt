PROPOSALS FOR Raising one Million, BY A Tax upon all PLATE wrought, And Bullion already Imported. THe Current Cash of the Kingdom hath been often Com∣puted at six Millions, and the Plate twice as much, or more. The Cash (by computation) is decreased (at least) one third, by carrying it out of the Nation, and Melting it down, (by both which there is Gain) and by this means there's scarce any other but Clipt Coyn in the Kingdom, and so the Plate which is of the Use is increased, and the Coynage (which only makes Silver useful) is destroyed. Now to make this Plate useful, it is Proposed, 1. That in all Coynage hereafter to be made, the Crown-piece which is now 19 d. weight, be reduced to 18 d. weight, and all Money proportionable. 2. That all Persons shall bring in all their wrought Plate, and Bullion already imported, into the Mint, (or the Officers that shall be appointed under it) either to be Coyned into this Coyn (and for every Ounce of Plate or Bullion so brought in to be Coyned shall receive 5 s. 2 d. in this Coyn) or else (at their election) shall keep their Plate, paying 6 d. per Ounce for it, and receiving a Stamp upon it, noting it to be Licensed Plate. By this means the Government will get by all Plate and Bulli∣on Coyned, and 6 d. per Ounce for all Plate not Coyned, which by Computation will amount to One Million. This Tax is only upon the Rich, and arises from a Commodi∣ty used for Fancy and not Necessity, and will Occasion the Coyn∣ing several Millions in the Kingdom, and prevent it from being Exported or Melted down, (which all Acts heretofore made for that purpose could never yet effect.)
FOR Raising one Million.
