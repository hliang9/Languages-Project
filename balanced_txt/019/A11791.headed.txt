NEWES FROM PERNASSVS. The Politicall Touchstone, Taken From Mount Pernassus: Whereon the Governments of the greatest Monarchies of the World are touched. Printed at Helicon. 1622.
THE PREFACE. THE truest and securest precepts of Policie are those, which either are drawen from the prudent resolutions, or vnadvised errors of great Princes in the deliberations of their most important affaires, or from the study of Policie; all consisting in a severe, and iudicious censure of the actions of the Great: and the studious in Histories, which haue the gift to know how to examine them well, draw out of them most excellent rules, for the wel-governing of many people: which being very true, it is no marvaile, if the best Writers of matters of State have growen extreamely odious to those that raigne; by reason, that as Princes willingly lend an eare to the praises which happen to be given them, although they come from the pen, or mouth of an impudent Flatterer, so likewise they haue in exceeding abhomi∣nation all censures which are made vpon their actions: it being an insupportable miserie vnto them, that their imprudence, and calamities, should serve for instructions vnto others, not to com∣mit the like faults. This truth assures me, that these my present Advertisements from Pernassus, (where in a sporting manner the actions, interests, true ends, and defects of many Princes, not very iust, coming to be censured, touched, discovered, and noted) would bring them infinite displeasure, if they should be openly published. Wherevpon, I, that at any hand will not give disgust
to any person private or publike whatsoever, haue fully re∣solved to keepe them from the Presse, as from the fire: for the length of time maturing things, that, which for infinite respects, in our Age is odious, the present Princes wanting, and those affaires growing olde, which now liue: and that in regard of their importance are held in great ielousie, I hope that these my Labours will then with particular liking bee read of the Vertuous, whom I indevour to please and delight: In the meane time I haue presumed to hide these my Writings in your Lordships Librarie, vnto whom I present them, to the end they may be published to the world at such time as they cannot giue distaste to any one. But then my desires shalbe accomplished, when these my Workes, such as they are, may giue vnto your Lordship that satisfaction, which I so exceedingly desire, in re∣gard of the infinite devotion I beare vnto your Name, and the in∣numerable obligations, wherein I stand ingaged vnto you, which haue created me a debtor vnto you in so great a summe, that if I should spend my whole life in your service, yet I should thinke I had done nothing, but that still I should die ingratefull.
THE CONTENTS. THe Spanish Monarchy arriveth at Pernassus; beseecheth Apollo she may be cured of an Yssue in her arme, and by the Politicall Physicians dismissed. The Monarchy of Spaine lamenteth for that her fals∣hoods are discovered. Maximilian the Emperor is advertised of the troubles begun amongst his sonnes. Most of the Princes, Commonvveales, and States of Europe are vveighed in a paire of Scales by Lorenzo Medici. The Spanish Monarchy goeth to the Oracle at Delphos, for to knovv vvhether ever she shall attaine to the Monar∣chy of the World, and receiveth a contrary ansvver. Philip the second King of Spaine, after some contesta∣tion about his Title, entreth vvith great pompe into Per∣nassus. Almansor, sometime King of the Moores, encountring vvith the Kingdome of Naples, they relate one to another the miseries they sustaine by the oppression of the Spani∣ards. Sigismond Battor learneth the Latin tongue. The Cardi∣nall of Toledoes Summa is not admitted into the Library of Pernassus. The French desire the receipt of the Spanish scent for Gloues.
The Monarchy of Spaine throvveth her Physician out of the Windovv. Most of the States of the World are censured in Pernas∣siu for their errors. The Duke of Cuize his Secretary is punished for spea∣king amisse. Certaine Persons for example vnto others, are shevved vnto the people. The Monarchy of Spaine inviteth the Cardinal of Toledo to be her Royall Divine in her Councel of State, vvhich he refuseth, and vvhy. The Spaniards attempt the acquisition of Savoy, but do not prevaile. The Duke d'Alva being arrived at Pernassus, in comple∣menting vvith Prospero Colonna, they fall foule about de∣frauding the Colonesi of their Titles.
NEVVES from Pernassus. CHAP. 1. The Spanish Monarchy arrives at Pernassus: beseecheth Apollo she may be cured of an Yssue in her arme, and by the Politicall Physicians is dismissed. ALthough the Majestie of Apollo had decreed vnto the High & Mighty Mo∣narchy of Spayne immediatly vpon her arri∣vall at this Court (vvhich vvas some fovvre months past) not only a solemne entrance, but the publike Consistory of the Learned in the Royall Hall of Audience, vvith the presence of the Excellent Muses: yet vvas it not executed, vntill tvvo dayes since, by reason she consumed all those fovvre moneths in accor∣ding vvith the Princely Poets such Titles as she vvas to giue, and receiue from others: and in agreeing hovv to receiue, and hovv to be receiued in Visitations: vvhilst the Vertuous stood amazed, and bitterly complayned of the hard condition of these modern times plagued vvith the corruption of such vanity: but greater vvas the affli∣ction of the Vertuous, because many Learned Princes o∣penly refused to be visited by that great Queene, saying, That they suspected the receiving some affront from her, for that they had lately Letters out of Italy, vvherein they vvere advised by their friends to stand vpon their guard,
it being the particular custome of the Spaniards, to goe to visit persons more to iniure, then to honor them; and that therefore it seemed to them a kind of exceeding madnes, in stead of avoiding affronts, to attend them in their houses, and reverently to receiue them vvith Cappe in hand. And albeit so potent a Monarchy to the great vvonder of all men had shevved herself much more spa∣ring, in giuing to others satisfaction of Titles, then in bestovving her golden Pistolets; nevertheles she hath re∣ceiued from those Princely Poets, and from all the Vertu∣ous Potentates, that more regard the substance, then the vanity of things, in this same titular busines, as much con∣tent as she could desire. Hovvbeit, the reputation of so great a Queen hath bin much blemished in this Court, by reason she is seen, notvvithstanding the extreme necessity that lyeth vpon her for the acquisition of friends, to shevv her self too forvvard in alienating such from her, as desire nothing of her, but satisfaction of vvords. Further, it hath bin observed for a particular of much note, hovv the Mr. of the Ceremonies advertised her, that that great punto she so stands vpon, is an odious thing, onely proper to bar∣barous Kings, and most vnvvorthy so great a Lady, and such a Princesse of Europe as she vvas: vvhereunto vvith much disdaine she ansvvered, Hovv she vvondered that he, considering the place he held, should haue so litle vn∣derstanding, as not to knovv, that a Prince vvith out gra∣vity, shevveth like a Peacocke vvithout a tayle. It is not possible to vvrite, vvith vvhat curiosity and desire this Princesse vvas expected, nor vvhat a concourse of people came from all parts of Apolloes State, to looke vpon this povverfull Queene, that vvith such a monstrous course of felicity hath in so short a time vnited vnder her most
spatious Kingdomes, and therof framed an Empire so for∣midable, that there is not a Prince in the vvorld, vvhich for suspition of her hath not armed himselfe. The Mo∣narchy of Spayne in comparison of those of France, of En∣gland, and other ancient Monarchies, is young in age, but of body farre bigger then any other vvhatsoeuer; and ac∣cording to the proportion of yeres she is of, of an vnmea∣surable greatnes: vvhence it is argued, that if she continue grovving vnto that terme, vvherein humane bodies are wont to come to their full perfection, she will become so great a Gyantesse, that she will arriue to that vnmeasurable height of the Vniversall Monarchies, wherunto the Rom. Monarchy attained: but the accidents of matters of State af∣firme for certain, that she wil neuer be bigger: and that she was as high in her tendrest yeres, as euer she vvilbe in any time to come whatsoever. The which is plainly demōstra∣ted by this apparant argument, that in these present times she hath grovven more slovvly halfe a fingers breadth, then she did tvvo handfulls in times past. This mighty Lady is of complexion very tavvny, much inclyning to the Moore: therefore her customes are rather proud, then graue; and in all her actions, hath more of the cruell, then the severe: so that not having beene able, nor desirous to learne that art (so necessary for a Prince) of pardoning, it is the firme opinion of many, that thereby her greatnes is the more impeached: for placing her estimation vpon nothing more, then to be called the Mistris of Nations, in the knovvledge of being most resolute to strike off the heads of such odious Poppies, as in the gardens of her States overtop their fellovves, she reioyceth not a litle, that she is said in that sort to haue gone beyond that Tar∣quin the Great, vvho vvas the first inventor of such a se∣cret.
Being then so resolute in the execution of seuerities, she is much perplexed in conferring of graces, vvhich are seene to proceed very seldome from her; and those too she doth, are granted vvith so much authoritie, as they are not very acceptable: Hovvbeit in apparance, she is all mildnes, and vvholly dissolved into Complements: but he that vvith the politicall Spectacle knovveth hovv to penetrate into the invvard of the heart, shall discover her to be all pride, all covetousnesse, and cruelty; in such sort, that they vvhich haue long negotiated vvith her, report; That there is not any Princesse from vvhom come svveeter vvords, and bitterer deeds: vvhereby it happeneth, that as a friend she greatly allureth men, and as a Mistres exceedingly terrifieth them. Her hands be out of all proportion long, vvhich she extendeth euery vvhere, as may be most for her profit, vvithout discer∣ning friend from foe, or a stranger from a kinsman: She hath the nailes of an Harpy most rapacious; vvith fingers of so hard and strong a tenure, that she neuer letteth goe any thing, vvhich she once fastneth on. Her eyes be blacke, and of a merveilous sharpe sight: She looketh a∣fquint, so that fixing her eye vpon one, she attentiuely beholdeth another: (a matter of much danger to Prin∣ces for of late yeares, having set her face vpon Argier, be∣fore any body vvas avvare, she fastned her looke vpon . And in those eyes is discouered a world of greedines, because she neuer beholdes any thing, that she doth not earnestly covet vvith her heart; vvhereupon the Speculatiue affirme, That this Queene is enflamed vvith an immoderate thirst of others Estates; and she never had freind, vvhom in a short time vvith sundry devises she made not a slaue. All vvhich doe manifest vnto the
vvorld, that she is fitter to governe slaues then free-men. She standeth so much vpon the punto of State, that she vvill not vouchsafe to stirre a foot for to encounter good occasions, vvhich many tymes haue gone home even to her ovvne doores to find her out. She goeth beyond all other Queenes vvhatsoever, either past or present, in the knovvledge hovv to cover vvith the cloake of hypocrisie any interest of hers, though neuer so diabolical: and albeit she is seene daily to enter into actions that are none of the best, yet she maketh ostentation of nothing more, then of her Conscience. Whence the French, so often deceiued vnder colour of most holy pretexts, haue at length to thier cost learned to arme themselues, and get to horse, assoone as they once heare her propound matters full of pretences of Religion, and blessed Charitie tovvards her most beloved Neighbor. She is so excellent in the exercise of horsemanship, that she hath not only vvith good fortune tamed the generous Courses of Naples, but also made gentle even those most vitious mules of Spayne, that by their naturall instinct are so vvilde and vnruly. She is aboue all other Ladies most suspitious, insomuch that, her ovvne Nation excepted, she trusteth not any of all those that are subiect vnto her, though vpon all occasi∣ons she hath proved them most faithfull: a matter of such preiudice vnto her, that the vnderstanding part of the vvorld plainly say, hovv for that only most important defect, it is not possible she should euer grovv greater: And this happeneth, because no Prince living eareth lesse then she to be loved of her people, placing all her study hovv to make her self to be feared. Whereupon the Polititians: haue observed it as a kind of very great mad∣nesse in her, to be so confidently perswaded as she is, that
she can dravv people to adore her by oppressing them: Neverthelesse, with these so odious Customes she allu∣reth all men vnto her service, for the infinite abundance of her treasures is that calamitie, which vvith such vio∣lence haleth vnto her even those minds, that are bound to abhorre her. She is most accurate in petty things, but in great affaires no other Queene hath suffered herself to be more easily deceived. In discoursing of, and resolving importāt matters, she sheweth admirable vnderstanding and prudence; but either by her naturall sloth, or the cun∣ning of her ministers, most covetous Marchants of great businesses; or because it seemeth vnto her, that no re∣solution is made with Decorum, if it be not a long time expected by the World, she executeth her resolutions vvith so much delay, that the face of affaires changing vvith the time, those resolutions which haue beene most prudently deliberated, haue often proved infortunate. And therefore it is the opinion of all men, that she is more able in laying of Plots, then in the managing of Armes, wherein she hath great courage, exceeding con∣stancy, vnspeakable patience of all discommodities: but so litle resolution, that her extraordinary circumspection hath many times the face of feare: whereupon she see∣meth more apt to maintaine, then conquer States. There are many singular men, that laugh at her, for ruling all her actions by such solide and mature counsels, without ever venturing any in the hand of that Chance, and Fate vvhich haue so favoured, and made glorious the French, when as on occasions they haue bene carried more by valor, then discretion: And some are of the minde, how that only proceedeth, from her being as sparing of her owne bloud, as she is thirsty after others: Whence it is,
that the most vnderstanding Captaines in the Art of warre, deride her, for aspiring to the Empire of the World, and yet will neuer fight: for this mighty Queene being resolved to make acquisition of great States by marriages, she abhorreth that dreadfull custome of the French, to buy others Kingdomes with the price of their owne bloud. Being then more advised then couragious, she is more dangerous to her friend in peace, then to her enemy in vvarre; wherefore the French, that hitherto haue liued with her in a supine negligence, haue at length, af∣ter so many calamities learned to double barre the doore when once they haue concluded a peace with the Spani∣ards. She is most carelesse of her owne, but so greedy of others riches, that she careth not to waste her owne patri∣moniall estates, so as thereby she may get anothers. She is so close, so reserved, that it is not possible for any cun∣ning of man to find out her ends: but he that will iudge of the disposition and customes of such a Lady, must be fully perswaded, that in all the affaires which either she manageth herselfe, or others haue to negotiate with her, she is within quite contrary to that she appeareth with∣out. And albeit that amongst the aforesaid vertues, she hath so notorious vices, yet by the greatnesse of her for∣tune every thing in her is interpreted, and admired for Vertue: so that many wise Princes hold it an honor to imitate her, even in vices. She is of constitution very strong: whereupon it is concluded, that she is long-liu'd, only she suffereth in the indisposition of the distraction of her members; a matter that doth infinitely weaken so great a Body: and although with the ayde of the liberty of Genoa, and the alliance she hath with the Duke of Savoy, she vseth many devises to vnite them: yet by the diver∣sity
of the interests of those Potentates, she prevaileth litle. But such a Princesse by nothing receiueth so much preiudice, as by her principall ministers the Spaniards, whose services alone she vseth in the greatest Charges, ex∣ercised by them with so much insolency & odious pride,  they will not be honored as men, but adored as gods: an impertinence, that hath made the Spanish Dominion distasifull, not only to the Italians and Flemmings, but euen to the very Spaniards themselves. This mighty Princesse then, appearing in the Royall Hall before the Maiesty of Apollo, she caused her seruants to vnbinde her left arme, and shewing it naked vnto Apollo, and to all the sacred Colledge of the Learned, she spake in this manner: Lord, and Father of good let∣ters, this vvhich you see, is that same stinking Yssue of Flanders, vvhich the French, the Germanes, and some Italian Princes, vvhich seeme my friends, and that in bowelled beyond. Sea Renegada, made me so many yeeres since, out of the suspition they had of mee. I grant, that the Prin∣ces I haue named, had iust cause to bee iealous of my po∣wer, at such time, as after the death of Henry the second, they saw France falne into the calamity of infant Kings; and that in their minority, I sought to sow dissention in that Kingdome: But now that those suspitions are vvan∣ting, and that in the great contention vvhich I had with the French; and particularly vvith that same vnchayned Prince of Beane, I vvas condemned in costs, I doe beseech of your Maiesty, that so fastidious an Yssue may be stop∣ped, since every one seeth, that by the great abundance of humors, vvhich are there concurring, it is become so raging a Canker, that I pray God, it doth not end vvith the ruine of the vvhole. I did not passe into Italy through
mine owne ambition, nor had that ardent desire to pos∣sesse my selfe wholly of it, as mine enemies affirme: it is vvell knowne, that I was called, nay, forethly ha thither by the Princes of Italy themselues, to deliuer them from the great feare they were in, of the domina∣tion of the French. And happy had it beene for my House of Spayne, vvhich I had covered with Slate of sil∣ver, and Tyles of massie gold, if I never had had any thing to doe with the Italians; a double dealing Nation, full of deceits, and interests, and onely good to imbarke men in dangerous affayres vvithout Bisket, and then to abandon them in the middest of greatest perils, making profession of nothing more, then to fare well at other mens costs: And it seemeth marueylous strange to mee, that Italy, which (as every man knowes) hath suffered her selfe to be towzed by so many strange Nations, should now make such profession of chastity to mee; that if shee see me never so little to moue, shee entreth straight into a jealousie, that I vvill depriue her of the honour of her Li∣berty. And albeit the greatnesse, wherein the Kingdome of France standeth at this instant, secureth Italy, and all the Princes which I have named, from the feare they are in of my power; yet vvhen it shall so seeme good to your Maiestie, I am ready to give security to every one, of not offending, so that this same fastidious Yssue of mine may be stopped. By order then of his Maiestie, the Yssue then was dili∣gently considered by the politicall Physicians; and ha∣ving made an exquisite consultation thereupon, they de∣livered, That in regard the Spanish Monarchy was trou∣bled with an ardent thrit of Domination, that Yssue was necessary for her, whereby those grosse humors might be
purged away; which from Peru distilled downe into her stomacke, and caused that vnquenchable thirst. And those worthy Physicians considered, that if the sayd Mo∣narchy had not that Yssue, there was manifest danger, that the pernicious humors of Peru, would mount vp in∣to the head of Italy, with apparant ruine of the principall members, which now remaine free in her; and that the said Monarchy of Spayne would fall into the Dropsie of an Vniuersall Monarchy: to avoid vvhich inconveniences, nothing was so proper, said they, as that same Yssue of Flanders, which was to be kept open, so long as Peru mi∣nistred those pernicious humors to the Monarchy of Spayne. This resolution greatly displeased the Spanish Monarchy, vvherevpon being much incensed, she said thus; Sir, if through the malice of others I must so foully consume away my selfe in ministring oyntments to the Canker, vvhich my enemies call a divertiue Yssue, some perad∣venture, that litle dreame of it, shall haue their share in it: This was presently apprehended by the English, the French, and Italians; who replied; That they cared not a rush for any thing she could doe: for they sent but the refuse of their States in to Flanders, whereas the Spaniards consumed Gold, and vitall bloud there: And that to se∣cure themselues from the formidable power, and ambi∣tion of the Spanish, vvhich appeared to haue no Horizon, the English, French, Germans, and Italians, were for∣ced conformable to the Aphorisme of the politicall Hipocrates, Tacitus: Consilijs & estu res externas moliri arma procul habere.
CHAP. 2. The Monarchy of Spaine lamenteth, for that her Falshoods are discouered. I Know not whether it were by accident, or by the malice of some French-men, or indeed (as many haue grievously suspected) by the plottings of that nation, which is such an implacable enemy to the French: but so it was, that many yeares since, the Royall Palace of the Monarchy of France was set on fire, and so great was the Flame, and so terribly did it burne, that the neighbouring Monarchies were in extreame feare, lest that fire wold end with the ruine of their States: in such sort, that for the preservation of their owne, euery one ranne to the extinguishing of the flame of anothers house. The English, though natural enemies to the French, brought thither the waters of their Thames; the Germans those of the Mose, and of the Rhine; the Venetians emptied almost all their Lakes. And in truth it was a mervailous thing to see, that even the Monarchy of Spaine her self, (esteemed so cruell an enemy to the French) should la∣bour amongst the chiefest friends, to extinguish that fire; whereas the common fame went, she would rather haue reioyced to haue warmed herselfe at it: wherevpon euery one remained much astonished, when they saw, that with care, and vnspeakeable charitie, she not only brought thither her waters of Tagus, and Iberus, but even the boundlesse Ocean it self; whereof, when the English, and Hollanders will permit her, she is absolute Mistres. Howbeit, some Politicians sinisterly interpreting the cha∣ritie
of the Spaniards, publikely affirmed, that it was a pernitious matter in the occasions of the French to ad∣mit the assistance of the Spaniards, who being eternall and capitall enemies to France, were rather to be recoun∣ted Architects of euery French ruine, then zealous of the greatnesse of that Kingdome as men, that measuring all the actions of those, which raigne in the workes of Princes, with the only Compasse of their interest, many times doe not admit even pietie towards God, much lesse charitie towards men. But these Politicians were so much the more held in abhomination with the world, by how much it was most apparant, that the Spaniards in their diligence, and charitie to bring water vnto that fire, not onely equalled, but went beyond any friend whatsoeuer of the French: And that which encreased all mervaile, and brought high reputation to the Monarchy of Spaine with simple men, was, that Flanders, and Au∣stria, her ancientest patrimonies, burning with the cru∣ell flames of warre, she had preferred the safety of the French, before the care of her owne affaires. Now be∣cause neither humane labour, nor any quantity of wa∣ter was sufficient to extinguish the least sparke of such a dreadfull fire, but rather the flames of those bloudy ciuill warres, notwithstanding all diligence, and re∣medies, daily more and more encreased; euen good men, and the deuoutest Simplicities began to lend an eare vn∣to the advise of the Politicians, and to suspect, that the charitie of the Spanish Monarchy was altogether interest, which indeed is right Spanish charitie; so that they re∣solved no longer to giue credit to apparences, but to looke into them, and see what matter it was, that the Spaniards brought in their Barrels: and they found, that
in stead of water, to quench the fire, they were filled with Pitch, Oyle, Rozin, and diabolicall dissentions, to encrease it; which treachery also some French Barons were discouered to vse, who more then others making profession of extraordinary charitie, employed those Barrels, and the matter in them, lent them by the Spa∣nyards: Whereupon, vvith iust indignation they vvere slaine by the French Monarchy, and burned in the very same fire, vvhich vvith such sedition, and infidelity they had nourished in their Country. And the Spany∣ards were not onely chased away from that Worke, but vvith sound of Trumpet proclaymed and published for Hypocrites; and by a particular Edict of the French Mo∣narchy, the World vvas made to know, that if ever in time to come, there vvere any one found, that could be induced to beleeue, how any kind of charitie could fall into the minds of the Spanyards towards the French, he should bee held, and reputed for a notorious Sim∣plicity: and that, if after the first admonition he should perseuere in his errour, as malicious, and seditious, hee should be tossed in a Blanket. It vvas strange to see, how the Spanyards, and those French before-named, had no sooner abstained from that Worke, but that the inflammation of France, vvhich be∣fore vvas so great, that even men of the best iudgement affirmed, how it vvas not possible to bee extinguished by any humane meanes, ceassed of it selfe: Whereupon, the famous Flowers-de-luce of Gold so trampled on before, rose vp more resplendent and flourishing, then ever they vvere; and France, that through the excessiue ambition of many, had beene cruelly tormented for forty yeeres to∣gether and better, became (to the great marvaile of all men) quiet, and pacified in the twinckling of an eye: so
that then it evidently appeared, that the Spaniards were the first Authors of that fire in France, which with such farre pretences of Religion and charitie, they haue labo∣red to make the world beleeue they would so faine haue extinguished. It is generally reported, that the Monarchy of Spaine retired herselfe into her Royall Palace, and how for a long time together she would not suffer her∣selfe to be seene of any one, giuing her selfe over to a deepe Melancholy, and with abundance of teares freely acknowledging, that she would rather haue lost two of the best Kingdomes she had, then see the vvorld con∣demne, and deride those holy pretences of hers, with which she had so often, to her infinite comodity, sold even the most stinking Assafetida for Muske, and Am∣bergriece: for now it seemed vnto her that she remayned without her richest treasure, and that she had lost the in∣exhaustible Mynes of Gold and Siluer of Peru, and of all the new World, seeing she was depriued of the benefit of being able euer after to make the simple multitude be∣leeue, that blacke was white; thinking it withall a very hard case to be driuen to that fearefull passe, wherein she had alwaies seene the French, that she must be forced to make acquisition of Kingdomes, only with the point of the sword; whereas in times past, with the sole apparences of her holy pretexts, vvhich had served her in stead of a most flourishing army, she had put the whole world into combustion: And that it exceedingly grieved her to be fallen into such an ill opinion with men, that she was in danger for the time to come, not to be beleeued any more in the truth; vvhere before, the dissimulation of false pretences, and of the openest Hypocrisie that might be, carried the credit of most sacred Truth, and of most perfect Devotion.
CHAP. 3. Maximilian the Emperour is advertised of the Troubles begun among his Sonnes. THere came three Postes very lately vnto the Ma∣jestie of the Emperour Maximilian the second; and presently it vvas knowen, how they brought him advertisement, that the Arch-duke Matthias had ta∣ken Armes against the Emperour Rodolphus his Brother, seditiously requiring the Kingdomes of Hungary and Bo∣hemia, and the absolute Dominion of Austria, and other Provinces. These ill newes infinitly troubled the mind of the Emperour; for he vvell knew, that the discord ri∣sen vp among his Sonnes, vvould giue the enemies of the House of Austria that content, vvhich they so much de∣sired. Whereupon, yesterday morning very early, that Prince presented himselfe before Apollo, and vvith many teares demanded of him, vvhen the evils of the House of Austria, so long before commenced, through the cruell combination of all Germany against it, should have an end; and for vvhat demerit such fearefull scourges vvere sent vnto his House. Vnto this demand Apollo answered in this sort: All the troubles and persecutions of your Fa∣mily, great Emperour, shall cease, vvhen it shall vvholly abandon those ambitious thoughts of desiring to com∣mand over Hungary, and Transilvania; vvhich hath given vnto Germany such iealousies, that to secure her auncient Liberty from the power of your House, shee bendeth all her study to nothing more, then to the depression of it: for the Germans, fearing greater prejudice from your ac∣quests,
then from the victories of the Turkes, are fully re∣solved rather to lose Vienna, then recouer Buda. And then also shall all Germany vnfainedly loue your Arch-Dukes, when deposing their present ambition, they shall make it appeare, that they desire to be equall, and not superior to other Princes of Germany. CHAP. 4. Philip the second King of Spaine, after some contestation about his Title, entreth with great pompe into Pernassus. THe mighty King of Spayne, Philip the second, who (some two months since arrived at this Court, was not permitted before yesterday to make a publicke and solemne entry, because that on certaine Tryumphall Arches, which with a Royall magnificence were erected vnto him by the Spanish Nation, these wordes were written: Philippo secundo Hispaniarum, vtriuss{que} Siciliae, & Indiarum Regi Catholico, Italiae pacis Auctori foelicissim. Which distasting the greater part of the Italian Princes, they required them to be cancelled, saying: That they would not at any hand acknowledge from the Spaniards that peace of Italy, which with ready mony they bought of the Hollanders. This aromaticall matter was a long time disputed, and albeit the Italian Princes had concludingly proved in iudgement, that the present peace of Italy was not to be acknowledged from the good mindes of the Spaniards, who would haue seized on it all, had it not beene for that great diuersion, but altogether from the
warres of Flanders, yet in the greatest heate of this con∣tention, the Queene of Italy with her wonted prudence pacified the matter; for hauing called all her Princes to∣gether, she advised them to leaue ostentation, and vain∣glory to the Spaniards, and applying themselues to substan∣tiall things to continue feeding them with breath. The concourse both for number, and quality of Princes which assembled to grace, and serve so great a King, was the greatest, and the honorablest, that euer Pernassus had seene. And so powerful a Prince had place amongst those Monarchs, which are famous in the world more for pru∣dence, and advisednes vsed in peace, then for valor she∣wed in warre: and greatly did the Learned marvaile at the Imprese, which he carried painted in his Standard generall, of a writing penne, wherewithall, by the testimony of Historians it plainly appeared, that in the potent Kingdome of France, and other places, where good occasion had beene presented vnto him to employ it, he had caused greater batteries and ruines, then Charles the fift his Father had done, or could do with most part of the Cannons of all Europe. An Imprese, that was much com∣mended by the sacred Colledge of the Vertuous, it being greatly to the honor of all Writers, that a Penne in the hand of a man, who knew how to mannage it, could worke such memorable effects. So mighty a King was entreated in Pernassus, alla grande; for euen the chiefest Monarchs of Christendome thought it a great reputation vnto them forto be able to serue him, insomuch that the day after his entry, being vnder the Barbers hand, the fa∣mous Queene of England continually held the bason vp close to his beard; and the warlike King of France, Henry the fourth, counted it a great glory vnto him to wash his
head, the vvhich he performed vvith such excellent dex∣teritie, as if he had beene borne for the Trade, although some malignants haue published, that it was without Soape, and onely with very strong and sharpe Lye. This great Monarch was presented by all the Vertuous of Pernassus with sundry Presents of Poesie, and other most elaborate Writings; the which he exchanged with much liberalitie: And to a learned personage, that pre∣sented him with a most worthy and honest Discourse, wherein he shewed the way, how the noble Parthenope, and the whole Kingdome of Naples, that by the robbe∣ries of Souldiers, corruption of Iudges, oppressions of Great-men, and by the generall ransackings of the rave∣nous Vice-roys, which from Spayne are sent thither to be fatned, is now come to vtter desolation, may be made to returne vnto the ancient greatnesse of his splendour, he gaue twenty Ducats, and consigned the Discourse to his Confessor; charging him to yeeld him a good ac∣count of it, as of a Worke, that was very holily written: But vnto a sufficient Politician, that presented him with a long Discourse, howbeit cleane contrary to the former, entreating of the meanes which was to bee vsed, for afflicting the sayd Kingdome of Naples more then now it is; & how it might be reduced to such calamity and mise∣rie, that the generous Steed, which without Bridle and Saddle, the Seate of State doth (with ill fortune) carry for Imprese, should patiently endure both Pack-saddle, and Burthens; yea, and quietly draw in the Coach too: because he held that to be vnderstandingly written, ac∣cording to the true termes of good Policie, hee gaue twelue thousand Crownes a yeere, and created him a Grande of Spayne.
CHAP. 5. Most of the Princes, Common-vveales, and States of Europe, are weighed in a payre of Scales by Lorenzo Medici. SEeing it is apparent, that the Romane Common∣weale, after the acquisition it had made of the Em∣pire of all Italy, could in a short time arrive to that Vniuersall Monarchy, which is yet so famous to the World, and whereunto many ambitious Princes haue since in vaine aspired, it hath beene a generall receiued Opinion, That that Potentate, who in State and Forces is suffered to grow vnto such greatnesse, that hee findeth no other Prince able to counterpoyze him, no more then the Ro∣mane Common-weale did, after it became Commander over Italy, cannot possibly be impeached from obtaining the Vniversall Monarchy. Whereupon those Empires and Kingdomes, which were afterwards framed out of the pie∣ces of the Romane Monarchy, to avoyd those calamities and dissolutions, which fell vpon such Potentates as were oppressed by the Romane Forces, out of most wholesome, and almost diuine counsell agreed together, that every fifteenth yeere, all the Princes of Europe should assemble into one place; where each ones Forces should bee seve∣rally weighed; and thereupon fit counterpoyze, and due mortification be given vnto him, that was found to be growen to any greatnesse, which might be odious and dangerous to his Competitor. Many great Wits were from time to time preferred to that honorable charge of governing the Scales; but for an
hundreth yeres past or thereabout, they were managed by the Illustrious House of Medici, and in particular by Le∣renzo the Great. Which prerogatiue, although to many it seemed preiudiciall vnto the Maiestie of the Popes, and prudence of the Venetian Senate, who haue alwayes wat∣ched; if not more, at leastwise equally with Lorenzo, and the Florentine Commonweale, to maintaine both in Italy and abroad, the Forces of the Potentates of Europe even∣ballanced, yet with a marvailous consent of all the Histo∣rians the government of the Scales was given into the hands of Signior Lorenzo. The first day of August, then all the Princes and Potentates of Europe, assembled in Phocis, not only to meet with so important a businesse as the perfect knowledge of their owne affaires, but that also of others, which in matter of State importeth much more. Whereupon, by an ancient and iust prerogatiue, the first that came to be weighed, was the Aristocraticall Monarchy of the Apostolicke Sea, whose temporall State was put into the Scale; and because the weight of the last fifteenth yeere was but sixe Millions of pounds, and now was found to amount vnto seuen & an half, every one knew, that the addition of the noble Duchie of Ferrara had cau∣sed that encrease. The next that was put into the Scale, was the State of the seuen Princes Electors of the Romane Empire, which by old Records appeareth to haue weigh∣ed in times past seventy Millions of pounds; but since, by the indiscreet governement and courses of many Empe∣rours, that lusty complexion, which made it evermore redoubted, was so spoyled, that it fell into those dange∣rous and foule infirmities, which after a long Quartane, found end in an Hecticke Fever, that hath now so consu∣med it, as our Age beholdeth it left with nothing but
very skinne and bone. Howbeit, though it bee so much decreased in state, yet the great bulke it hath of body, ma∣keth it in shew very goodly to looke vpon; the rather, because the intrinsecall imperfections are not discouered: for many good persons with the ancient Titles of the Empire, and maiesticall Name of Caesar, haue beautified it very excellently without, but when it came to bee weighed, it was found quite empty within; a feather not being so light, as the name of a Prince without au∣thority is vayne: whence it is, that the Romane Empire proved so weake, as it weighed but 480 pounds. Then the famous Peeres of France brought vnto the Scale the flourishing and warlike French Monarchy; a square of fiue hundreth and fifty Miles every way, replenished with an infinit Noblesse, armed on horsebacke, which not onely maintaineth peace at home, but maketh so great a King formidable to all the Nations of the earth; besides a world of learned men, which adorne it; Merchandise and Trades which enrich it; Tillage and Husbandry, which make it plentifull, and abounding with every good thing. The ancient weight of so famous a Monar∣chy was twenty Millions of pounds; but in the last fif∣teenth yeeres weight, by reason of the horrible calami∣ties, whereinto (by the disloyalty of some of her Barons) she was throwen, it did not arriue to twelue Millions; howbeit now it not onely equalled, but went farre be∣yond the weight of the best ancient times; for it came to fiue and twenty Millions; a matter of such marvaile to everyone, that the Spanyards got on their Spectacles, and very narrowly observed, whether the Weights were right or no. To the ancient Kinḡdome of France was added the ac∣quisition
of Bresse given vp by the Duke of Savoy, which in regard it was so advantageous to the City of Lyons, augmented the weight of it aboue a Million. Next were the many Kingdomes of Spayne put into the Scale by the Spanish Grandes, and to the great wonder of those ancient men, that could remember, how an hundreth and twenty yeres since, they were held in a poore and vile account, the weight amounted to twenty Millions. The Spanyards remained exceeding well satisfied with this weight of their Spayne: and assured themselues, that with the addi∣tion of so many other States, they had besides to put into the Scale, not onely to equall, but farre to exceed the fiue and twenty Millions of the French Monarchy. VVhere∣fore instantly they put into the Scale the flourishing Kingdome of Naples, which every one thinking would encrease the weight at least two Millions more; it ap∣peareth, that then it weighed lesse by one and an halfe: at this strange accident the Spanyards being much ama∣zed, sayd: That either Lorenzo had vsed some fraud in the weighing, or that of necessitie the Scales were not even; because it was a monstrous thing, that the addi∣tion of matter should abate of the weight. Whereunto Lorenzo coldly answered; That his Scales were even; but that neither the Indiaes voyd of inhabitants, nor the Neopolitans, and Milanese, which were so farre distant from the Forces of Spayne, and replenished with a people, which so vnwillingly supported the com∣mand of strangers, weighed any thing at all: for it was the loue and multitude of subiects, the fertility and v∣nion of States, that giue weight, and turne the Scale. Hereupon the Spaniards added the Dutchy of Milan in∣to the Scale, which in like manner abated a Million of
the weight; whereat also the Spanyards were so much astonied, that they would not put Flanders into the Scale, fearing to receiue a greater distaste and affront. How∣beit some sayd, that if they had put in the Indiaes, they might haue wrought some good effect, but not those miracles, which certaine lavish toungs have delivered; who with the same facility talke of Millions of Crownes that the furnace-men make of very bricke and tyle. Then came the English Lords, who put into the Scale their Kingdome, so much redoubted for the strength of the wonderfull scytuation thereof; for the continued Mountaynes, which compasse it about serving for walles, made by the very powerfull hand of God in forme of bulwarks, and the Ocean for most profound ditches, make it a Kingdome feared, in regard of the commodity it hath to assayle others; and the insuperable difficulties, which they shall finde, that offer to attempt it. The weight of this Kingdome was answerable to that of the last fifteenth yeare, which amounted to sixteene Mil∣lions. But the English to giue more weight to their Kingdome, would haue put the Kingdome of Scotland into the Scale; when the Scottish Nobilitie with drawen swords in their hands opposed themselues; freely pro∣testing, that they would never suffer their Country to be annexed to the Kingdome of the English; for yet fresh was the lamentable example of the miseries of Flanders, who when she saw her Earles become Kings of Spayne, foolishly beleeved that shee should command o∣ver the Spanyards; whereas soone after, not Spayne was sacked by the Flemmings, but Flanders by the covetous and cruell Spaniards; and that which made vp their mi∣serie, Charles the fifth the Emperor, and King Philip his
sonne, by their continuall residence in Spayne, of Flem∣mings became Spanyards. The vnfortunate Flemmings by losing their Prince, of naturall subiects, grew to be estee∣med strangers, and men of little faith. And so Flanders, the naturall Country of Charles the fifth, the Patrimony of King Philip, became (according to the termes of mo∣derne Policie) a State of fiue States, and began to be go∣verned by strangers; with those jealousies, and with those oppressions of Customes, Taxes, Contributions, and Donatiues, as begat those bad humors, those ill sa∣tisfactions, from whence since hath proceeded that ciuill warre, which after an vnspeakable profusion of Gold, an infinite effusion of bloud, an incredible losse of honour to the Flemmings, was converted into a covetous mer∣chandise of the Spanyards. Therefore the Scots by such lamentable miseries haue learned, not to permit their King vpon any termes whatsoever, to abandon the Royall Seate of his ancient Kingdome, for to place it in a greater, newly fallen vnto him: in which case the Scots should vnder their cruell enemies the English, be sure to suffer all the calamities, which inferiour Nations are wont to endure at the hands of the superiour. Some that were present at this Act report, how the Spanyards told the King of England, that those Scots which had spoken so arrogantly in the presence of his Majestie, were to be seuerely chastised; to whom the King of En∣gland answered, That the Spaniards ought not to giue that counsell vnto others, which had proved so pernicious to themselues: and thereupon hauing commanded the stay of weighing their Kingdome, hee assured his Scots, that ere long he would giue them all possible satisfaction. After this, the vast Ottoman Empire was put into the
Scale; which the last fifteenth yeare arrived to the summe of two and thirtie Millions, but now was found to be lesse then sixteene; the strangenesse whereof made all the Princes very much to marvaile; and particularly the Venetians, who could not beleeue such a fall; where∣upon they desired, that with more diligence it might be reweighed; and it appeared, how in that litle time run∣ning betweene the first and this second weighing, it had fallen eight hundreth twenty and two pounds; where∣by it was manifest, that the Ottoman Empire, heretofore so terrible to the world, now consumed with luxury, co∣vetuousnesse, and idlenesse, runneth headlong to his ruine, which gaue great contentment to all those Prin∣ces. Nevertheles, it was observed by some of the wisest there present, that the Spanyards were not so glad of it as the rest; out of a doubt they had, that the depression of the Turke, would be the exaltation of the Venetian State. Then came the Polach Senators, and put into the Scale their Kingdome, which in regard of the small authori∣tie the King hath there, and the too much command, which the Palatines arrogate vnto themselues, made but a poore reckoning; for it did not amount to six Millions of pounds, whereas in times past it alwayes exceeded twelue. After them, the Signory of the Councell of Tenn put into the Scale the flourishing estate of the Vene∣tian Commonwealth, most admirable for the greatnesse thereof, and oportunitie of scituation fitting for all great enterprises, which went beyond all expectation in the weight, for it came to eight Millions; the cause whereof was sayd to be the huge masse of Gold, which those wise Senators in so long a time of peace had gathe∣red togither into their Treasury. Next came the Switt∣zers,
the Grisons, and other free people of Germany, and brought their Comonweales to the Scale. How beit the Princes required, that they might be weighed each one severally by it selfe, wherewith the Germanes were well contented, so that it might be done. But Lorenzo having put the Commonwealth of Basil into the Scale, it appea∣red, that the greater part of the other Common weales of Germany were all so linked together, that it was im∣possible to seperate them one from another, which put a many of ambitious Princes there in a sweate. Then the Duke of Savoy caused his State to be put into the Scale by his noble Knights of the Annonciata, which equalled the weight of the last fifteenth yeare; but Lorenzo, having added into the Scale that most noble prerogatiue of Ti∣tle, which the sayd Duke Charles Emanuell enioyeth of the Prime Souldyer of Italy, it was seene to aggravate the weight a Million foure hundreth and twenty pounds. After this, with a pompe and Maiestie matchable to Kings, appeared the Duke of Lorraine; whose State, though litle, equalled the weight of great Kingdomes; and it was considered that it fell out to be so by a certaine good fortune which that Prince had, to haue his States so happily seated, that he could easily put the Lowe-Countreys into grievous difficulties, by impeaching the passage of those succors, which the Spaniards conduct thither out of Italy, whereby he hath growen into such reputation, that to the most offerer he selleth for ready Gold the mar∣chandise of that his adhering; in such sort, that after he had dreyned the Spanyards, asmuch as any the devoutest French Lord of the Holy League whatsoever, syding after∣wards with the French, he knew so well how to change his coppy, that a King of France, such as was Henry the fourth,
the great Duke of Toscan, and the Duke of Mantoua, were glad of his allyance. And fully to make vp the Spanyards iealousye, the famous Venetian Commonwealth drew in∣to her pay a Prince of that House with such affection, that if that great Lady had not made a vow of perpetuall cha∣stity, and her nature (according to the custome of some Indians,) had not bene stytched vp the first day she was borne by the Venetian Signory, most jelous of her honor, it was verily beleeved by many, that she would haue taken him to husband. It was observed, that the Duke of Savoy envyed much the felicity of this Prince; because he fin∣ding himselfe also seated betweene the French and the Spanyards of Milan, as the Duke of Loraine was be∣tweene the French and the Spanyards of Flanders, in stead of so many benefits, and so many commodities, as fell vpon the Duke of Loraine, he had received most cruell kickes, not onely from the French then his enemies, but from the Spanyards his friends; so that it was e∣vident, the Duke of Savoy did now plainly see, how that practise of his with the Spanyard, was most perni∣cious for him. Then came the Otto di Balia, and put into the Scale the flourishing State of the Great Dukes of Tos∣ which by reason of the excellent wits of the inhabi∣tants, perpetuall plenty, continuall peace, and quiet secu∣rity it enioyeth, answered in weight to many King∣domes. Lorenzo greatly reioyced, when he saw how vpon the foundations of those Churches and Hospitals, which he and his Predecessors in the time of the Florentine liber∣tie had layed in their Countrey, their Successors, accor∣ding to the modell left them by Cosimo the Great, had af∣terwards found meanes to erect strong Cyttadels; where∣vpon Lorenzo, to make a glorious shew of the worth and
wisedome of the Princes of his House, added into the Scale the admirable vnderstanding of Ferdinand the Great, with the excessiue weight whereof it was so over∣charged, that the huge chayne whereby it hung brake in two, so that all went to ground. This accident of the Scales so broken, was an hinderance that other Italian Princes, which remayned, could not be weighed; where∣vpon it was concluded, that comming, according to the ancient custome, to lay all the Princes and Potentates of Italy in ballance against the Monarchy of Spaine, out of the vniversall weight of the Italian Princes, each ones per∣ticular would easily appeare. Into the midst of the great Hall then was brought an huge, and even payre of Bal∣lance, whereinto on the one part was put all the King∣domes of the Monarchy of Spayne, and into the other all the principalities of Italy; and it was seene that they stood in equall Ballance; a matter of great trouble to all the I∣talian Princes: but whilst they continued in this agony, it was noted, how the mighty French Monarchy with one only loving looke, which she gaue to that Ballance, wherein the Italian Principalities lay, made it suddainly to turne on that side. It may not be omitted, how to Spanyards seeing the Dukes of Savoy, who the last fift yeare refused to be weighed with the Italian Forces,  to be put into the Ballance, for to counterpoyse theirs, threatned them by biting their thumbs at them; where∣of those Princes being aware, with a generosity worthy their vndaunted spirits, they say thus vnto them: Signory of Spayne, yee can no longer feed men with hopes, for now we are throughly possessed of your courses: Yee thought to haue brought the Dukes of Savoy by the cun∣ning of your hopes to such a madnesse, as to forgoe that
litle bread, which they had in the mouth of their State; to reach at the shadow of those great inheritances of Spayne, which they saw in the bottome in the water. And because the Spanyards complayned for that the Dukes of Parma, Modena, Vrbin, the Lords of Mirandola, and the fa∣mous Roman Barons, Gartani, Colonesi, and Orsini, which haue the Fleece, and are in their pay, were weighed with the Italian Forces; whereas in regard of that Order, and the Pensions they receiue, they were obliged to adhere to their deseignes, and to be the ministers of their great∣nesse. They were answered by those Lords, that they receiued the honors of the Fleece, and enioyed the pro∣fits of those Pensions, as honorable Ladies accept of gifts from their Lovers, only in a pure way of curtesy, and not with an intent any way to for∣get what appertay∣neth to their honor.
CHAP. 6. The Spanish Monarchy goeth to the Oracle at Delphos, for to know whether ever she shall attayne to the Monarchy of the world, and receiveth a con∣trary answere. YEsterday morning two houres before day, the renowned Monarchy of Spayne departed with great secrecy, in a Caroch of sixe horses from Pernassus, carrying along with her onely some few Con∣federates of her Court, which begate a world of jealou∣sie; but in particular the French Monarchy was so mooved, that to be ascertained of this voyage, she presently tooke Poste, and following the Monarchy of Spayne, shee over∣tooke her iust as shee was entring into the Oracle of Apollo at Delphos; before whom presenting herselfe, by report of them that by chance were then present, shee made this ensuing request: O eternall, and cleare Lampe of the world; thou right Eye of Heaven, that not onely bringest day, but every good else to mankind: Thou knowest, that for a long time together, all my thoughts haue aymed at that Vniversall Monarchy, whereunto the Romane people onely arrived: Thou knowest what effu∣sion of bloud, what profusion of Treasure I haue made, to attaine vnto the end of my intent: To thee onely are knowen the watchings, the sweat, and those so arti∣ficiall endevours of mine which I have vsed, to bring so important a Deseigne to passe: Thou knowest also, that by the valour of my Nation, by the dexterity of my
wit, and by the power of my money, not many yeeres since, at such time, as I had sowen those turbulencies of ciuill warres in France, whereon I had grounded all my hopes, I was neere vnto the obtaining of my intent; no∣thing remaining for me to overcome all impediments, but to vnite Naples with Milan; a difficulty, which if I can once surmount, I may then securely boast that I haue gotten the day: But seeing that either by my fatall mis∣fortune, or by the impossibility of the affayre, or by the power of so many cruell enemies, which declared them∣selues against mee, the scandals of those revolutions, which with such devises in the space of so long a time, I had sowen amongst the French, over whom yet I could never prevaile, were in one onely day converted into such peace and tranquilitie, as it breaketh my heart to behold it; and that after the wasting of so many of my people, whom in this enterprise, that I haue propoun∣ded to my selfe, I haue almost reduced to vtter desola∣tion, I am in the end become euen the fable of the world: Therefore doe I thus present my selfe before thy Majestie, whom I most humbly beseech, to let mee clearely vnderstand, whether that Vniversall Monarchy, which is so imprinted in my heart, and which is the only end of all my actions, bee destinated by the will of Hea∣ven to me, and my Nation: and this I desire to know, that either by the impossibility of the matter, I may bee constrayned to give it over, or by the possibility thereof, I may encourage my Spanyards to goe on cheerefully in their attempts: for to confesse the truth vnto thee, that knowest the secrets of thoughts, in regard of so many crosses, which both by Sea and Land I have endured; in regard of so many Conspiracies and Counterplots which
by my implacable enemies have beene contrived, and now more then ever are contrived against me, I beginne wholy to despaire and saint. After this request, the Temple shooke, and the earth trembled, when from the mouth of Apollo's Mi∣nister came these words: The Vniversall Monarchy shall returne anew to the noble Italian Nation, when it shall give over those intestine discords, which have made it a slave to Strangers. Vpon so sad an answere, the Monar∣chy of Spayne full of griefe departed out of the Temple, and much she marvailed, when shee saw the French Mo∣narchy present her selfe before her; with whom having vsed her wonted Complements, shee drew her aside, and declaring vnto her, what answere shee had received from the Oracle; shee informed her, that if the Vniversall Mo∣narchy should returne againe to the Italian Nation, France would quickly be as sure to feele a new Iulius Caesar, as Spayne a second Scipio; and therefore to secure their af∣faires, there was no such way, as to divide Italy betweene them. Shee also offered to teach her the same Receipt, which shee had so happily experimented in the Indiaes, wherewithall they might so assure themselves of the Ita∣lian Nation, that there should remaine no more of that wicked race of men in the world, then the bare name. Let me first forget (answered then the French Monarchy) that vnlucky devision of the Kingdome of Naples, which my king Lewis the twelfth made not long since with you, and then we will talke of this businesse: For it is not so easy a matter to wrong the French a second time, as I per∣ceiue you perswade your selfe it is. As for the receipt, which (to be secured of the Italians) you propound vnto me, I pray you vse it your selfe; for to spoyle the earth of
people (as you haue done in the Indiaes) and to raign over naked Countreys voyd of inhabitants, is a certaine poli∣tick Precept, which is not found in the French reason of State; for I haue learned to my cost to content my selfe with a litle, so it be good; and therefore I place my great∣nesse more in the multitude of Subiects, then in the ex∣tent of Kingdomes; and so as my French may liue cōmo∣diously in this world, I am well pleased that others shall doe so too. Moreover, with that libertie, which is pro∣per to my nature, I will freely tell you, that the subduing of all Italy, is not an enterprise so facile as you imagine; for when I was of your humor, I know how pernicious it proved to me; and therefore be warned by my experience, not to attempt that, which in the end will bring you nothing but losse, and disgrace.
CHAP. 7. Almansor, sometime King of the Moores, encountring with the Kingdome of Naples, they relate one to another the miseries they sustayne by the oppression of the Spanyards. THe famous King of Moores, Almansor; he that ma∣ny yeares togither raigned in Spayne over the no∣ble Realme of Granada, met yesterday with the Kingdome of Naples, and falling in talke with him, after he had for a good space observed the chayne, which the sayd Kingdome of Naples wore fastned about his legge, he told him, that the manufacture thereof being Moresco, he verily thought that he had many times scene, and hand∣led it some where els; and a litle while after with a shew of great marvayle he affirmed, that he knew it well; and how it was the very same, wherewith all both he, and the Moorish Kings his Predecessors had for the space of seven hundreth yeares held many Kings of Spayne in ser∣vitude; and therefore he earnstely entreated him, to let him vnderstand, how, by whom, and when he was chay∣ned in that manner. A very good eye, and an excellent memory hast thou, Almansor; (answered then the King∣dome of Naples) for this vnlucky chayne, which thou seest about my legge, was brought out of Spaine by Gon∣salvo Corduba, called the great Captaine, and therefore it is very likely to be the same thou speakest of. And now it is an hundreth yeares, since first I found my selfe in the miserable servitude, wherein thou beholdest me, and from
which I know not whither ever I shall be freed; for in re∣gard of the mighty power, whereunto I see the sorces of the Spaniards arrived, having vtterly lost all hope of assi∣stance, that may be expected from men, I know, that my ancient libertie standeth wholly in the poewrfull hand of God, who had need to renew in me the miracles of the Red-Sea, if my deliverance shall follow. The yeares (replyed Almansor) confront well; for a litle before the time of thy servitude, the Spanyards vndid this my chayne from about the legge of the Kingdome of Granada, where withall afterwards they bound thee. But let it not dis∣please thee, O Kingdome of Naples, to declare vnto me, how it could come to passe, that the Spanyards should make themselues Masters of such a Kingdome as thou art, so potent, and so farre distant from their Forces. By fraud Almansor, (sayd the Neapolitan Kingdome) did the Spanyards get into Italy, for by open force they had never beene able to make such notable acquests; and as thou saydest well, so disproportionable to their Forces, which vvere so farre off. But heare, and vvonder at the large and grosse con∣science of a King of Spayne in matters of State, although he vsed much art to seeme vnto foolish men a very Saint; for thou shalt come vnto the knowledge of a Tragedy, according to the rules of my Christian Religion, most vvicked and cruell; but according to the termes of mo∣derne Policie, the most advised, that ever any Nation re∣presented vpon the Stage of the vvorld. Alfonso my King, to his vtter, and my chiefest ruine, gaue Isabella his Niece (for from this vnhappy marriage did my displan∣tation take beginning) to Iohn Galeazzo, Duke of Milan for vvife. The minortie first, and then the vnspeakeable silly weakenesse of so infortunate a Prince incouraged
Lodovico Sforza to vsurpe the State vpon his Nephew; Alfonso, as it behoved him, sought to hinder that Tyran∣ny; vvhere of Lodovico being aware, and knowing, that without the ruine of my Kings, it vvas not possible for him to arriue vnto the end of his most injust desire, he fell into that resolution, vvhich afterwards both to him∣selfe, to me, and to all the Princes of Italy proved so fa∣tall, of drawing the French into Italy, to the conquest of me. My Kings to defend themselues from such mighty enemies, called to their ayde that holy soule of Ferdinand King of Aragon their Cousin, who shewed himselfe so kind a kinsman, and such a faithfull friend, that in stead of chasing avvay the French enemies, he divided me with them; and to shew himselfe compleat, a little after this vnhappy division, he entred into warres against the French, and having overcome them, he forced them to returne full of shame, and losse into their countrey; vvhereupon the good King Ferdinand without any scruple at all of con∣science became my absolute Lord; and then it was, that he fastned this chayne about my legge, which thou re∣membrest to be the manufacture, and worke of thy Na∣tion. And I do not thinke, that in all the Chronicles of the Saracens, Moores, or Turks, vvhich it is likely thou hast read, there was ever a more vvicked treachery recorded, done by a King, that desired to be reputed a man of a good conscience, and of an holy disposition; and that a litle before had receiued of the Apostolicke Sea that glo∣rious title of the most Catholike King. Truly (replyed Almansor) in the Chronicles, which thou hast named of my Nation, many foule actions cōmitted by divers Prin∣ces out of ambition to raigne, may be read, but this which thou hast recounted of Ferdinand goeth beyond them
all. But if thou, O Almansor, (sayd the Kingdome of Naples) diddest with thy Nation keepe the Kingdome of Granada, chayned so many hundreth yeares, vvhat course tooke the Spanyards for to free him? That Vnion of the Kingdomes of Castile and Aragon (replyed Almansor) which followed vpon the marriage between Ferdinand and Isabella, occasioned the libertie of the Kingdome of Gra∣nada: a most vnhappy Vnion, the which, no lesse then I haue done, and continually still doe, the greatest Po∣tentates of Europe, haue lamented, doe lament, and perpe∣tually with vnfained teares vvill lament; as that, which is the true and onely roote, from vvhence are sprung all those greatest subversions of States, which vnto this day haue beene seene in many partes of Europe, but more re∣markeably in Italy. And beleeue me, Neapolitan King∣dome, that even till now might I haue raigned happily in Spayne, if this pestiferous Vnion had not overthrowen my greatnesse; for the many jealousies that raigned be∣tweene the Castilians and Aragonians, were my inexpugna∣ble Cittadels, which would haue maintayned my raigne here for ever. Withall assure thy self, O Kingdome of Naples, that the aydes which the Popes gaue to Ferdinand, and Queene Isabella, greatly accelerated my taking in. Peace, peace, Almansor (said then the Neapolitan Kingdom) for after thou wert chaced out of Spayne by the ambitious Spanish Nation, the Popes vndervvent such miseries, that it may be truly sayd, how with ready mony they bought those extreame calamities, wherewithall afterwards they encountred; for though the Sea Apostolicall were well contented to see the Moores driven out of Spaine, yet that satisfaction was much dissasted with my servitude, which followed presently vpon it, the Popes having ne∣ver
had any thing in greater feare, then that I should fall into the hands of a mighty Prince, vvho might make them liue in those perpetuall jealousies, vvherein finding themselues drowned even vp to the very eyes, many of them, and particularly those, that haue a greater know∣ledge of things of the vvorld, do not alwayes make quiet sleepes. A cleare testimony of the truth which I speake, was the lamentable and wicked sacke of Rome, perpetrated by the Spanyards a litle after my servitude; with which in∣gratitude they payd the Apostolicke Sea for all they were debtors vnto it, aswell for the remission of the Tribute of Naples, as for the other succors, which they received in the vvarre of Granada. A calamitie, that having past the termes of most grievous miseries, hath in such man∣ner opened the eyes even of men of the drowsiest vnder∣standing, that every one cōmeth clearely to know, what it is to vnchayne the Lyon out of a zeale of pietie; for the Spanyards no sooner saw themselues freed from the impediment of the Moores of Granada, but that through the ambition, which they shewed in desiring to cōmand over the whole Vniverse, not onely in Italy, but through∣out all Europe, most important jealousies of State, and most grievous interests of Religion discovered them∣selues, in so much, that I haue often heard it discoursed by men of most vnderstanding in affayres of the vvorld, how peradventure it would haue beene lesse prejudiciall for many Princes of Europe, that thou haddest raigned still in Granada, then that the Spanyards should haue passed in∣to Italy, to acquire such important States, as at this day they possesse there. Hereunto may be added the prejudices both publike and priuate, which my ruine hath brought, and conti∣nually
doth bring vnto the Italian Princes, and more particularly to the Popes, because the Kings of Spayne had no sooner fastned this Chayne about my legge, but presently they began to aspire vnto the Dominion of all Italy; and the quicklier to arriue thereunto, they knew very excellently how to interesse themselves in the dif∣ferences, which at that time depended betweene the Princes of Italy, and the French, about the possession of the Dutchy of Milan, wherein that top of man, Charles the fifth, carried himselfe in such sort, that hee made himselfe to bee knowen the worthy Nephew of his Grandfather by the Mothers side: for having with the Forces of the Italian Princes, chased the French out of Italy, instead of restoring the Sforzi to the State, as it was agreed betwixt him, and the confederate Princes, with the fraud of a thousand Turkish quarrels pickt of purpose, which he well knew how to invent against the Sforzi, he made himselfe absolute Master of that so im∣portant a Dutchy. Stay, Kingdome of Naples; and ma∣king a point here, (sayd Almansor) satisfie me in this: see∣ing the noble State of Milan was fallen into the hands of the Spanyards, what hindred them from running preci∣pitously to the acquisition of all Italy? and seeing thy servitude doth manifest vnto the world, that the aydes and succours of Princes, serue more for the benefite of him that giveth them, then for the profit of him that receiveth them, why would not the Italian Princes rather suffer, that Milan should be vnder the Dominion of the French, then by receiving ayde from the Spanyards, runne the danger of letting that Dutchy, (beeing so important a member of Italy) fall into the hands, as thou saydest it did, of the Kings of Spayne? The power of the Kings of
France (answered the Neapolitan Kingdome) defendeth that remnant of Liberty which remaineth in Italy, from the ambition of Spaine: for those glorious Kings out of the interest of their greatnesse will not endure, that the Dominion of all Italy should fall into the power of the ambitious Spanish Nation, which cannot extinguish the ardent thirst they have of commanding, neither with the Conquest of all the new World discovered by them, nor with so great a part which they possesse in the old. Besides, the Italian Princes, who know the great perill (wherein they finde they are) of a dangerous and mise∣rable servitude, have so vnited themselves together, that although they be many in number, yet make they but one Body; and the Spaniards, who haue vsed, and doe vse all possible devises to dis-unite them, evidently perceive, that they wash a Black-Moore. But touching the State of Milan, thou must know, how it was iudged more secure for the publike Liberty of Italy, that that Dutchy should fall into the power of the Spaniards, then that it should remaine in the hands of the French; who for that they were ioyning to Italy, when therein they should possesse any little part, there would haue beene manifest danger, that they would haue made themselves absolute Lords of the whole: but in the Spanyards it would fall out cleane contrary; for their For∣ces, albeit very great, are notwithstanding so farre off, that by so long a tract of sea, they could with much diffi∣culty transport out of Spayne into Italy Forces, that were able to maintaine the acquests they had made, not that they could be sufficient to subdue the whole. Thou speakest the truth, (sayd then Almansor) but goe on, and declare vnto me the prejudices, which thy fal∣ling
into the hands of the Spaniards brought vnto the Popes. Know then, (replyed the Kingdome of Naples) that whereas before, the Popes were the terror of my Kings, now it happeneth to bee cleane otherwise; for they liue in a very great agony, lest the Vnion of Milan with Naples should one day follow; to which marke, they obserue, the Spanyards haue directed the scope of all their thoughts; vvhereupon the Spanyards, whose proper na∣ture it is to make good vse of the feare, vvhereinto they see they haue put the Princes their neighbours, haue ar∣rogated vnto themselves such authority in the Court of Rome, that they vaunt they are the true arbitrators of all the most important matters, vvhich there are handled. Moreover, when the Kings of Naples were not Kings of Spayne, the Popes with every litle menace of denying the investiture, obtayned of my Kings, Principalities, Dut∣chyes, Earldomes, and other great States in gift, buying their friendships also with mariages, and many other sortes of liberalitie; but now, the feare being ceased, if the Popes vvil make their kinred great with titles of im∣portant States, they must be glad to buy them with their ready mony, and the advised Kings of Spayne, besides the pretious Gold of entreaties, which at any hand they will bee sure shall precede for a first payment, sell them vnto them thoroughly sawced. Important interests, and grie∣vous disorders are these (sayd Almansor) vvhich thou hast recounted vnto me; but how cometh it that thou, King∣dome of Naples, which art the Magazine of Silkes, the Granary of Italy, shouldest goe so ragged, and be so leane? Seeing the Spanyards, that come naked out of Spayne [an∣swered the Kingdome of Naples] after they haue beene three or foure dayes in my house, will needs cover them∣selves
all over with gold, it is no marvaile if I be spoyled, to clothe so many Raggedemuffins: besides, if thou sawest the rapacitie of the Vice-roys, that to recover them selves are sent vnto me, or if thou knewest the rapines of Secretaryes, of thousand Officers, and other Courtiers, which they bring along with them, all thirsty of my bloud, thou wouldest greatly marvayle, how it were pos∣sible, I should satiare the raging, and greedy swallow of so many hunger-starved wretches. As for the litle flesh thou seest on my back, the Spanyards affirme, that in the booke of a certaine Florentine, who hath given rules of the cruell moderne Policie, they find written, that being a Kingdome conquered, after the manner of those horses vvhich are kept only for races, I ought to be maintayned low in the flesh. I but (sayd Almansor then) the Milanesi how are they entreated? They also (replyed the Kingdome of Naples) are bathed with the water, wherewithall thou seest mee so wet; only this difference is betwixt vs, that in Milan are droppes, in my house, flouds. The true occasion of the diversitie of these entreatings is the quality of the Lombards dispositions, most vnlike to my Neapolitans: for the Nobilitie of the State of Milan are naturally phan∣tasticall, free, resolute, and farre from that vice so proper to my Neapolitans, of flattery, and affectation; but so bold and hardy, that they dare say, how if one only Cremonese spirit had beene found amongst my Neapolitan Barons, it would haue hindered that same forced donatiue, that hath brought me to eate Bread and Onyons; the which, although with great words, it hath beene often deman∣ded by the Spanyards in Milan, they haue beene as resolu∣tely answered, that they should take care to liue: Besides,
the confining of the Grisons, of the Duke of Savoy, and Venetians, are the cause, that the Kings of Spayne proceed with more diseretion in Milan: for when the Popes ma∣naged Armes, I my selfe also was for their occasion great∣ly respected. But soft, Almansor, yonder commeth my most capitall enemy Don Pedro de Toledo, wherefore I pray thee withdraw a litle; for at any hand I would not haue him take notice, that I lament my disgraces heere vvith thee; and for this onely, vvere it for nothing els, may I tearme my servitude most wretched, in that I am forced to call this miserable state, where∣in thou seest me, the happy gol∣den Age.
CHAP. 8. Sigismund Battor learneth the Latin tongue. YEsterday about eight of the clocke in the evening, the ordinary Post of Germany arrived at this Court, and brought very ioyfull newes, how Sigismund Battor, Prince of Transilvania, was growen so inamored of the gracefull Latine tongue, that to his great glory he spake, and wrote with the puritie and eloquence of the Cesarean style; whereupon all the Vertuous earnestly be∣sought Apollo, that for such good newes there might be made in Pernassus all those demonstrations of ioy, which (to incourage Great-men to the loue of Learning) were wont to be made, when any Prince became learned: But his Maiestie, that seeth into the vttermost secret of all things, denied those Vertuous their request, and told them, that then only there should be feasting in Pernassus, when out of the freenesse of a noble minde, and meere election of studies, not constrayned by any necessitie, Princes ap∣plyed themselves to Learning; and that they were to know, how Prince Battor had gotten the elegant Latine tongue, neither out of ambition to shew himselfe to bee learned, nor out of a vertuous curiosity to know ma∣ny things, but onely out of necessitie for his reputa∣tions sake, to correct the foolish and childish absurditie which he committed, in Gender, Number and Case, at such time, as in the warre of Hungary he tooke that fatall resolution to arme himselfe against the Turke, for to ad∣here vnto the Emperor of Germany, whom in regard of the strong and lively pretensions, which he hath to the Principaliy of Transilvania, he was to haue in more horror, then seventy Ottoman Emperours.
CHAP. 9. The Cardinall of Toledoes Summa is not admitted into the Library of Pernassus. THe illustrious, and reuerend Francesco Cordova, Cardinall of Toledo, a personage of exemplarie life, an exquisite Divine, and excellent Philoso∣pher; hee that in his owne person honoured the Word of God in the Pulpit more then any other Preacher whatsoever of his time, some few dayes since arrived at Pernassus, having beene received vpon the confines of the State, by Alessandro d' Ales, and Cornelio Musso Bishop of Bitonto, and all the way entertayned at his Majesties charge. This honorable learned man presented his Wri∣tings vnto the venerable Colledge of the Vertuous; and those of Philosophie were not only commended, but ad∣mired; as also the Commentaries composed by him vpon the divine passages of all the sacred Writers, were recei∣ved with extraordinary applause, and shortly after they were carried in a precious Vrne vnder a cloth of Estate, into the Delphicke Library, and with the name of the Au∣thor consecrated to Eternity. Onely his Summa, although very learned, was not received by those Vertuous, who freely told him, that there were so many Workes already of that kinde in his Majesties Library, as some of them seemed superfluous: for an infinit many of great Divines had with such diligence handled matters appertayning to the consciences of private men, that they had put the salvation of soules into comprimise, for the only regard of a shillings gaine: And that the world very much desi∣red
to see a complete Summa, composed vpon the consci∣ences of great Princes; a matter most necessary for the quiet of the whole Vniverse, and altogether omitted by Divines; wherein those actions of Princes should be ex∣actly discoursed vpon, with which so often they put the world into confusion, filling it with robberies, assassi∣nates, and such flaughters of men, that many of them blinded with the ambition to raigne vpon earth, have made rivers to runne with humane bloud. The Colledge of the Learned, hearing these particu∣lars, sayd, That they much desired to have these Questi∣ons disputed, and resolved: Namely, whether Christian pietie will admit the speciall hipothesis, which the violence of the sword hath vsurped over others States: Whether a Principality, that by Armes, and fraud, is forceably ta∣ken from another Prince, may be held by one that hath the true feare of God: Whether that course of ruling a Kingdome, which is conquered onely to the end to im∣poverish and waste it, that so it may be governed with∣out jealousie, may be practised by one that is borne in the Christian Faith: Whether the exalting of Reason of State to such an height, that it should trample vnder feet, as at this present it doth, all Lawes divine and hu∣mane, be not a more detestable and execrable Idolatry, then worshipping Nabuchadnezzars Image, or the golden Calfe. And lastly, the Colledge sayd, That then their desires would be fully accomplished, when there could be found a Divine so much fearing God, that with his Writings durst fright Princes as much from doing evill, as many others with their great Volumes had terrified private men; for it seemed a strange thing vnto them, that infinite learned Divines had so laboured to reason
of the strict accompt, which Shop-keepers are to render, even for idle words, vnto the Majestie of God, and in the meane time had omitted to make mention of those exorbitant errors, committed by great Princes; when with their Armies over-running States, they send all things into perdition, both sacred and prophane: And that with more benefite to mankinde, and eternall re∣ward to themselues, Divines might have discoursed vpon the actions of Lewis the twelfth, and Frances the first, both Kings of France; of Ferdinand King of Aragon, and Charles the fifth the Emperor, whose soules departed out of this world with the heauy burthen of halfe a million of man∣slaughters, all comitted by their ambition to raigne, and whereof they were to giue a strict accompt to Almighty God: All which were matters exceeding necessary, to the end, that mankind so much afflicted by the ambition of Princes, might one day receiue the consolation, which with such longing it desireth, when those that raigne, should be terrified from doing amisse, and be made to know, that Hell was prepared aswell for the Great, as the small.
CHAP. 10. The French desire the Receipt of the Spanish Sent for Gloues. THe emulation which is seene to raigne betweene the two warlike and powerfull French and Spanish Nations, is as great, as it is eternall: for there is not any vertue appearing in the French, which is not ex∣ceedingly coveted by the Spanyards; neither are the French ever quyet, till they haue attayned vnto those rarities, wherwithal they see Spayne indued. And because that sent with which Gloues are made so sweet, is a particular in∣vention and gift of the Spanyards, the French haue omit∣ted nothing that might bring them to the perfection of making the like; and to their great charge they furnished themselves with Muske, Ambergriece, Civet, and all other the most odoriferous Drugges the East produ∣ceth, but all to no purpose; for neither charge, nor dili∣gence were sufficient to make them attayne to the end of their intent; howbeit, before they vvould giue it o∣ver as desperate, the noble French Nation had re∣course vnto his Majestie, the productour of all Aro∣matickes, vvhom they earnestly besought that hee vvould bee pleased to teach the French the vvay how to make the right Spanish sent for sweet Gloues. Where∣upon Apollo was never seene to laugh more heartily at the fall of the infortunate Icarus, then hee did at the re∣quest of those French, whose hands, hee commanded his Priests that stood by him, to smell vnto, and tell him what they sented of: The Priests immediatly obeyed, and affirmed vnto his Majestie, that they sented vvell:
Which Apollo hearing, he sayd to those French, that nature alwayes vsed to countervaile a defect vvith some rare vertue; and that therefore the gift of making Gloues so sweet, shee had only granted to that Nation, whose hands stunke most abhominable. CHAP. 11. The Monarchy of Spayne throvveth her Phisitian out of the window. THis morning the Monarchy of Spayne hauing sent for her ordinary Phisitian, a litle after with her owne hands she threw him out of the win∣dow of her Royall Pallace, whereupon the poore wretch, being all battered in pieces, died incontinently. An accident that seemed the more strange, in regard the Phisitian was held by all the Court to be a man of extraordinary honestie, and in the practise of his profes∣sion most admirable. Sundry were the discourses, that were made vpon so remarkeable a matter. But Apollo de∣siring to know of the Spanish Monarchy her selfe the true cause of so grievous a resentment, that mighty Queene told him, how aboue forty yeares since, vpon occasion of some accidents that befell her, and other signes, which she had discouered, she feared that in processe of time, she should catch some dangerous French disease from the Royall House of Burbon, and therefore; to provide for the inconvenience which shee foresaw, she had demanded counsell of her Phisitian, who prescribed her a long,
fashidious, and chargeable purgation, compounded of divers Oyles of Holy Leagues, of insurrections of peo∣ple, of rebellions of Nobilitie, of Cauteries, and other very bitter ingredients, whereby she had spoiled her sto∣mach, weakned her strength, and altogether lost her appetite; and that the infinite quantitie of Syrrupes, and the many medicines which she had taken with such an∣guish, had wrought no other effect, but the accelleration of the disease, which without that vnlucky and vnseaso∣nable purgation peradventure she shold neuer haue had: Moreouer, that the many Leaches which were applied to many parts of her body, had in such manner sucked the best vitall bloud of the Gold of that Spayne, that thorough the weaknesse of her complexion, she was not able to euacuate those evill humors of Flanders, which had held her, and doe hold her oppressed. By which dis∣orders, all occasioned through the naughty counsell of that imprudent Physitian, she was so exasperated against him, that she had solemnely sworne to throw him out of the window, if to free her from future infirmities, he euer after ordained her any purgation; And that percei∣ving, how the paine which she hath at this instant in the shoulder of Holland, vvas an apparent Lues Gallica, she had demanded counsell of the same Physitian for to cleare her selfe of it; who vnmindfull of his former errors, had foolishly ordayned the second purgation, wholly and altogether like the former, and that therefore being ouercome with paine, she had throwen him out of the Window; so punishing him at once for both the faults he had committed: for it seemed vnto her, that he had well deserved the misfortune of that resentment, seeing that by the accidents following, with such infelicitie of her
Spanyards, he had not learned to know, that purgations made before their time for diseases that are feared, doe not worke those good effects, which either the Physitian beleeveth, or the Patient desireth. CHAP. 12. Most of the States of the World are censured in Pernassus for their errors. APollo carefull of nothing more, then to see that the Princes of the World, should in the vpright gouernment of their States, giue the people such satisfaction as they ought, introduced into Pernassus (ma∣ny ages since) this admirable Custome: That euerie yeare, the names of the chiefest Potentates of the earth, written vpon litle schedules, should be put into an Vrne, and then being drawen foorth one by one, the publicke Censor of Politicall matters should (in the presence of the sacred Colledge of the Learned) record the disorders, which he had obserued in the gouernment of their States; whereupon those Princes were bound either inconti∣nently with satisfying reasons to defend such things as were obiected against them, or els within a Moneth to reforme them. An institution no doubt very noble, and holy; for it hath effected, that in the progresse of so many ages, since first it was vsed, Princes haue corrected an infinitie of errors: besides, knowing that they are to be called to so strict an accompt, it maketh them endeuour to liue so
vertuously, that in the presence of so many Princes they need not to blush. Vpon the day appointed then, most of the Potentates of the World appeared before Apollo: And Count Baldazar Castiglione the Politicall Censor, said vnto the reuerend Lord Giouanni dalla Casa, Nuntio for the Sea Apostolicall in this State, which was first drawen out of the Vrne; That it seemed vnto him a most scan∣dalous matter, and indeed vnworthy the Greatnesse, and Maiestie of the Popes, that in Rome should be seene some potent Families, vnto whom it served in stead of a rich patrimony to be dependant on forraigne Princes, not ve∣ry well affected to the greatnesse of the Apostolicke Sea, which in euery occasion were apt with the power of their Factions to giue the Popes much trouble; And that he might truly say, how in all his time he had not seene a more foule and execrable thing, then that which the Emperor Charles the fifth did, when with the noble Charge of the Kingdome of Naples he rewarded the cru∣ell seditions, and shamefull treacheries, which the Cardi∣nall Pompeo Colonna vsed against the High Bishop Clement the seuenth. Then the Lord Giouanni demanded of the Count, how long it was, since he had conuersed in the Romane Court; who answering, Some seuenty yeares past: the Nuntio replied, that returning thither now, he should find, how by reason of the abundance of vert∣juice, which the Pompei, Pabritij, Prosperi, Ascanij of the family of Colonna; the Virginij, and other more principall Barons of the House of Orsina had eaten; the teeth of their Nephewes, and Grand-children were so set on edge, that they could hardly chaw ther broth: for the Popes which had tyed those exorbitances about their fingers, knew so excellently how to practise the Tarquinian pre∣cept,
that they haue reduced those Poppies, which here∣tofore were as high as Cedars, to the humble stature of ridiculous dwarffes. This answere satisfied the Count, who turning to the Romane Empire, next diawen out of the Vrne, he said vn∣to him, That the present disorders, which were seene not only in the great patrimony of the House of Austria, but in all Germany, proceeded from the negligence of the pre∣sent Emperor Rodolphus, and therefore he much desired, that that Maiestie would with more care embrace the go∣vernment of his so many States; remembring, that Prin∣ces, rulers of mankinde, bore vpon their shoulders the heauiest weight, and had in their hands the most labori∣ous worke, that any the painefullest day-labourer what∣soeuer could exercise. The Censor vvas exceedingly than∣ked by the Romane Empire for this aduise; whereunto with much grauitie he answered, That it was a disgrace common with all Princes, to be accused of negligence, when scandals arose in their States, although it notori∣ously appeared, that in regard they were occasioned by the practises of more mighty enemies, they could not possibly be avoyded by an vnderstanding Prince. Wherefore it was to be considered, That the mon∣strous felicities, which the most mighty House of Au∣stria haue had by inheriting with their Matches, the States of Flanders, the Kingdomes of Spaine, of Naples, Si∣cilia, Bohemia, Hungarie, and Portugall, haue giuen all the Princes of Germany, of Italy, and of Europe such diabolicall jealousies, that they haue caused both the passed and pre∣sent ruines, now beheld in their ancient patrimony: Whe∣reunto the Emperors, which haue raigned since Maximi∣lian the first of famous memory, albeit they were reputed
most valorous & prudent princes, could neuer after apply any salue, that did not infinitely exasperate the sore of the disorders of Germany, wherein had concurred such a∣bundance of malignant humors, that it might truly be said, it was immedicable. Further, it was to be remem∣bred, what small authoritie, the moderne Emperors haue had in Germany, so that it were not only a discurtesie, but open injustice to will one, that hath his hands fast bound behind him, to performe the acts of Orlando. Moreouer, the qualitie of the Empire was to be regarded, which being electiue, they that serued, had more authori∣tie in it, then they that commanded. Besides, the pre∣sent weaknes of the House of Austria in Germany, from whom (with the seditions of Religion) the hearts of their subiects are stollen; a theft so important, that they may well abandon those States as lost, wherein such dange∣rous seed is sowen. Wherupon the present Emperor seeing himselfe depriued of the obedience of his subiects, desi∣reth euery one to reflect vpon the qualitie of the Cou∣sins, which the House of Austria hath in Spayne, and they shall finde, that the people of Almaine borne for their li∣bertie, to secure themselues from the monstrous power of such a Family, take impious and wrongfull reuenges euen on those, which shall not be free from the servitude of the Spanyards, if for the sinnes of men they euer arriue to that point of commanding ouer the World; from which (by the meere goodnes and mercy of God they are put off as farre, as by their many deuises they haue la∣bored to come neere it. That also it was to be thought vpon, how the first that in Italy, and abroad, disinheri∣ted with all kind of irreuerence, and disrespect the Maje∣stie of the Empire, were those their Cousins of Spayne, as
clearely appeared by the vsurpation of Finale, and other Imperiall feudes by them possessed. All which things, moouing dangerous humors without dissolving them afterwards, do cause the House of Austria in Germany, to be cruelly scourged by most powerfull enemies, whilst the Spaniards with their only menaces seeke to put the whole vvorld into suspition and distaste. And for conclusion, he desired all the sacred Colledge to consider, that to the miserable sterilitie of children, which is seene in the pre∣sent Emperor, is adioyned a lamentable fertilitie of bre∣thren; one of which incited by the most violent spurre of ambition, hath not doubted at last to goe about to ouer∣throw his owne House, vvhich is ready to fall. All acci∣dents so vnhappy, that they vvould make euen Salomon himselfe seeme to the World a very foole. These replies, which to all the Assistants seemed very vveighty, satisfied the Censor, vvho turning him to the vvarlike French Monarchy, said vnto her, How all the Vertuous of Pernassus much desired of her, that she vvould rule the furious, vnquiet, capricious, and exceeding im∣petuous dispositions of her French, reducing them to those termes of prudence, advisednesse, and stayednesse of minde, which are seene in the noble Italian, and Spanish Nations; & how it much blemished her reputation, that the Kingdome of France, which holdeth a first place a∣mongst the most principall Monarchies of the World, should be inhabited by men so infinitely rash. To this aduert sement the French Monarchy replied, That the Cen∣sor not well informed of the interests of her Kingdome, had censured for defects the chiefest vertues, vvhich she loued in her French. Folly, lightnesse, vnaduisednesse, and a precipitous nature were they, which had made her so
feared, and formidable a Queene, because her French with vnspeakeable alacritie and forwardnesse, would vpon the least nodde of hers, expose themselues to those perils, whereunto other Princes could not with the rope, the cudgell, and the cruellest kinds of punishment compell their wise, aduised, and circumspect subiects: And that in the many warres, which she had held with most valorous Nations, she had learned to know, how an army framed of souldiers, which had litle braine, and much courage, so that they are ledde by a valiant, and discreet Generall, doth carry away the victorie from those people, who professe more circumspection, and wisedome. This answere of the Monarchy of France, was so much the more commended of Castiglione, by how much, regarding the qualitie of a mighty Kingdome, he knew that the French possessed all those endowments and vertues, vvhich vvere requisite in a Nation, for to found, amplify, and maintayne a great Empire. Then the Censor turning to the powerfull Monarchy of Spayne, sayd vnto her, how it vvas evident, nothing gaue greater satisfaction to all people in generall, but more particularly to those which were subject to strange Na∣tions, then the humanitie, and affable cariage of such as governed them; whereas she sending to the governments of Naples, Milan, and Sicilia, none but her owne Spanyards, they with their ordinary Castilian statelinesse, and insup∣portable Spanish pride, without all comparison farre ex∣ceeding that, which the Kings of Spayne themselves either could, or would haue vsed in those States, did so exaspe∣rate even their good and faithfull subjects, that the Spanish Dominion was growen infinitely odious: And that fur∣ther, both in vveighty, and sleight affayres he desired
more quicke expeditions from her, seeing that by her too much delay, and perplexitie in the deliberation of im∣portant matters, shee had lost many fayre occasions, that had presented themselves vnto her, for the enlarging of her Empire. The Monarchy of Spayne, very much than∣ked the Censor for the advertisements he had given her, and in her excuse answered, how that honorable Gentle∣man, which had a young vvife, beyond all expression fayre, but of a disposition enclyned to lasciviousnesse, should shew himselfe very discreet, if he desired, that a proper handsome servant, whom he kept in his house, should bee rather extreamely hated, then any whit affec∣ted by his wife: and that vnto the delay in the resolution of her affayres, which she knew to be virious and prejudi∣ciall, it lay not in her power to give remedy: for almigh∣ty God having not without important occasions created her Spaniards wholly, and altogether quite different in dis∣position from the French, vvhilst they in the deliberation of businesses were rather precipitous, then executive, she in her beeing so slow, and irresolute, obeyed the will of God, vvho would haue it so. The next drawen out of the Vrne vvas the Monarchy of Poland; vnto vvhom Count Baldasar sayd, How all the Princes of Europe could haue vvished, that the present King Sigismond had vsed towards those seditious Nobles, which last rebelled against him, some severitie worthy so grievous a fault, onely to the end, that by their example, other Lords might have beene deterred from commit∣ting the like. To this the Polach Monarchy answered, That those chastisements giuen to the Nobility, which in an hereditarie State would be commodious, haue al∣wayes prooved in her electiue Kingdome prejudiciall:
And how that Kingdome, which another receiueth in gift from a Nobility, in whose power is the election of the King, cannot without evident perill of falling from his greatnesse, be governed with that rigour, vvhich in other hereditarie States is necessary; for that Senate, which out of an election of love giveth another a King∣dome, if it be provoked by the powerfull passion of hate, knoweth also how to re-assume it, in regard well∣advised Senators are vvont to reserve vnto themselves those necessary instruments, vvhereby vpon every occa∣sion of evill satisfaction, they may recall their vsed libe∣ralitie: And that the present King Sigismond beeing the first of his House, vvhich had raigned in Poland, he vvas to direct the ayme of all his thoughts to no other scope so much, as by an extraordinary indulgence to vvinne the hearts of the Nobilitie of his State, that so vvith a gratefull memorie of his clemency, he might perpetuate the succession of such a Kingdome in his Bloud. An ad∣vertisement, most necessary for Sigismond his King, by reason the Polachs, although their King be electiue, do ne∣uer defraud the Royall Bloud of the succession, if he that raigneth, can tell how to get the generall loue of the Nobilitie. For the Polonians being a Nation, that know not how to liue in an absolute libertie, do so abhorre all manner of servitude, that that King among them (a matter common to all electiue Princes) shalbe most o∣culatiue, and vigilant in the matters of his State, that least seemeth either to see or know any thing. Not only the Censor, but the whole Colledge of the Vertuous, ad∣mitted the justification of the Polach Monarchy for ex∣cellent. Hereupon, the Count turning hemselfe to the vast
Ottoman Empire, said vnto him, That the crueltie, which he vsed, onely vpon light suspitions, against his chiefest ministers, was held by all the world to bee a bloudy course; it being a received opinion, that men of extraor∣dinary valour and merit, should not be layd hands on, but for great and prooved offences: And that when the Ottoman Princes did even justly take away the lives of their ministers, the custome of seizing vpon their Estates to their owne vse, and thereof vtterly depriving the chil∣dren, did scandalize all good justice, because it seemed, that with such cruell rigour, the Estates, rather then the faults of the delinquents, were hunted after. To this so open a correction, the Ottoman Empire answered with admirable gravity, That hee was growen to that great∣nesse wherein hee was seene, by the onely two most powerfull meanes of reward without measure, and pu∣nishment vvithout end: And that the sole foundation of he quiet of every State, being placed in the fidelity of the most important ministers, Princes were not to seeke any thing with more care, then with immense rewards to allure them vnto faithfulnesse, and vvith infinite pu∣nishments to terrifie them from trecheries: That those ministers vvhich have in their power the Forces, Com∣mand, and Governments of States, not beeing able to ere, but in most important matters, it vvere the coun∣sell of a foolish Prince, vpon suspitions of that moment to arraigne, accuse, and heare the justifications of the of∣fendor; but in such a case, the Prince which will runne no danger, ought to indevour to surprise his minister vpon the sudden, and to deale so securely, that the exe∣cution of the punishment may precede even the accu∣sation itselfe: That many times it had fallen out, that
he with a suddaine chastisement had preuented the con∣summation of most foule treasons: Which resolution, though he acknowledged to be most seuere, yet he knew it had so wrought, that there vvere neuer seene in his State any Counts St Paul, Princes of Orange, Dukes of Guise, d' Aumale, du Maine, de Mercure, and other foule monsters of disloyaltie, vvhich, vvith the shame of those Princes, that vvith halters, poynards, and axes knew not how to preuent such dangerous offences, haue beene seene otherwhere: It being a rule in matters of State as common, as secure, That that minister, which giveth to his Prince the least shadow of suspicion of his faith, in∣curreth a capitall paine, because those Captaines which haue the care of Armies in their power, are bound, like the wives of Honorable personages, to liue with such puritie of minde, that they be free not only from blame, but from the least suspicion of a blame-worthy thought. That touching the seazure of his Basshawes estates after their death, he thought he might truly say, that the en∣tertainements, gifts, and wealth, wherewithall other Princes rewarded their ministers, in comparison of those inexhaustible riches which he bestowed on his well-de∣seruing Officers, were vile, and poore, as those Royall Treasures, which Ruften, Mahomet, Ibrahin, and infinite others left behinde them after their decease, haue fully testified: That the greatest regard, which a Prince ought to haue in rewarding his ministers, consisteth in proui∣ding, that the vnmeasurable riches, wherewith he bought of them infinite fidelitie, may not possibly at any time be conuerted to the prejudice of him, that vsed the libe∣ralitie: That from the grieuous disorders fallen out in the States of other Potentates he had found it to be a
matter most pernicious vnto Princes, that the extraor∣dinary riches left by a deseruing minister should passe vnto his children, not hauing first deserved it (by their vertue, valour, and fathers said fidelitie) of the Prince: That he had not out of couetousnesse, as many mis∣judged, confiscated the great inheritances of his Basshawes, but that by the cōmoditie thereof, those subjects should not be idle, & consequently vicious, which being descen∣ded of fathers of notable valour, gaue the Prince assured hope they would imitate the vertues of their Progeni∣tors: That the gate of his Treasure stood perpetually open to the heyres of his ministers, to restore them their fathers enheritances twice doubled, when they with their fidelitie, and valour should deserue them; and how much the riches of men vicious, and subject to ambition were apt to disturbe the peace of any Kingdome how great soeuer, well appeared by the fresh examples, which he had seene both in France and Flanders. Whilst the Ottoman Empire spake in this manner, he obserued that the renowned French Monarchy with the shaking of her head, seemed to declare, that she no way approued those reasons, whereupon somewhat the more moued, he said thus: Mighty Queene, my custome in sei∣zing vpon the estates of my Basshawes, is profitable for the greatnesse, and quiet of my State; and in regard of the friendship that is betwixt vs, I would to God, the same course were obserued in your France; for you know full well, to what vse Henry the Duke of Guize conuerted the exceeding riches, wherewithall the liberall Kings Francis the first, and Henry the second rewarded the merits of Duke Francis his father. You, and I, and all those that raigne do know, how the sweetest bayte that can allure
men, is a Crowne, and there beeing no man, which for to taste neuer so litle of it, but would hold it a great plea∣sure for to expose euen his life to manifest danger of lo∣sing it, Princes ought to be most vigilant in keeping with extreamest severitie the passages thereunto closed vp against all men: nay, they ought to accomodate their affes in such sort, that no priuate man whatsouer should once hope to taste of so sweet a thing: And I tell you freely, that if your Duke of Guize had in my State but only thought that, which with such publike scandall he boldly put in execution in your Kingdome of France, I wold the very first day haue given him that blow, wher∣vnto your King Henry the third, although hee were in∣cited vnto it by the greater part of the Princes of Italy, could neuer be drawen, vntill the very last hower of his shamefull disgraces, and euen at that instant, when the sore of the French vprores vvas become an incurable vl∣cer; for where ambition raigneth among Nobles, Prin∣ces are constrained to shew themselues all severitie, con∣tinually keeping scaffalds in readinesse, and prepared, to punish the seditious, and rebellious; and their Treasury open, to reward the quiet, and the loyall; that Prince beeing vnworthy to command, that hath not the vnder∣standing how to make himselfe be obeyed; neither can there be a more scandalous matter seene, or met withall in a State, then that the Prince should liue in jealousy of an Officer, which ought to tremble before him. But it is the propertie of you the Princes of Christendome, making profession of Learning, and directing your selues by rules of Policie, to call me Barbarous, and my secure way of proceeding, Tyrannicall, whilst in the meane time yee suffer your selues to be reduced by your heroicall
vertues of clemency, and gentlenesse, to shamefull termes of enduring vnworthy things. It is not possible to deliver, how much the Ottoman Empire offended all the Vertuous of the sacred Colledge with his discourse, who standing vp, told him in great dis∣daine, how they could proove vvith present reasons, that all which he had said, were most wicked conceipts, vn∣worthy to be spoken by any person that had a soule, or to be heard of men, that made profession of honour. Whereunto the Ottoman Empire answered smiling, That others in the gouernment of Kingdomes might haue re∣gard to Vertue, and I know not what, but for his part he would neuer be perswaded, but that the quiet and peace of States ought to be preferred before all other humane interests whatsoeuer. Then the Censor, to cut off so odious a dispute, turning to the great Dutchy of Moscovy, said vnto him, That the most noble prerogatiue of raigning ouer people, which vvere louers of Learning, and excellently Vertuous, vvas the second amongst the greatnesses of a Prince: Whereas hee by so endevouring to bring vp his sub∣jects in a grosse ignorance, reaped no small blame, if not much disreputation; because euery one skorned him, for that, expelling the famous liberall Arts out of his State, he had only permitted his people to learne the benefite of vvriting and reading. To this Censure the Dutchy of Moscovy answered, That the dreadfull fire, vvhich he had obserued, Learning had euer kindled in those States, where it had beene admitted, had made him resolue not to suffer in any sort, that so scandalous a a Cockle should be sowed in his Dutchy; for men beeing the heards of Princes, as sheepe the flocks of priuate per∣sons,
it vvere extreame folly to arme those gentle sheepe their subjects with the malice, which Learning engraf∣teth into their dispositions, that attaine vnto it; whereas otherwise, in regard of that harmelesse simplicitie, where∣with Almighty God hath creared them, they may be comodiously ruled and gouerned, be they never so many in number, by one Prince alone: And how he held for infallible truth, that if the Germanes, and Hollanders had beene maintained by their Princes in the simplicitie of their ancient ignorance, and withall it had beene prohi∣bited, that the pure minde of those Nations might not haue beene contaminated with the plague of Greeke and Latin learning, without all doubt they had neuer had the judgement, with such a ruine of their old religion, and destruction of many Princes, that before ruled ouer those Prouinces, to know how to frame those perfect formes of Commonweales in their Countries, where∣vnto neither the vvit of Solon, the vvisedome of Plato, nor all the Philosophy of Aristotle could euer arriue. This answere so mooued the Censor, and all the sacred Colledge of the Learned, that with threatning lookes they said, how the reasons alledged by the Great Dut∣chy of Moscouy, were open blasphemies; and it seemed the Learned were ready to make good their vvords with deeds, when the greater part of the mightiest Monar∣chies were seene to betake themselues to their vveapons, for defence of the Moscouite; vvho growing more auda∣cious vpon the forward assistance of so many Potentates, boldly said, If any one would deny, that Learning did not infinitly disturbe the quiet, and good gouernment of States; and that a Prince might not with more facilitie rule a million of ignorants, then an hundreth learned,
that were made to command, and not to obey, he lied in his throate. The Vertuous vpon this daring defiance grew extremely incensed, and stoutly replied, That the Mos∣covite had spoken with an insolence, worthy of an igno∣rant, and how they could also proue vnto him, that men without Learning were asses and calues with two legges. Now were they almost ready to goe together by the eares, when the Censor cryed out, Forbeare, and carry due respect to this place, where we are assembled to amend disorders, and not to commit scandals; vvhereupon such vvas the reuerence euery one bare to the Maiestie of the Censor, that both the Princes, and the Learned, although they were transported with anger and disdaine, became suddainly pacified. All being quiet, then the Censor said vnto the famous Venetian Libertie, which next was drawen out of the Vrne, That the hardest matter to be found in an Aristo∣cracie, as she well knew, was to restraine the young No∣bilitie, who vvith their licentiousnesse distasting the bet∣ter sort of Citizens, had many times occasioned the ruine of most famous Commonweales; And that he to his great griefe had heard, how the young Nobilitie of Venice vvith their proud demeanour had offended many honorable Citizens of that State; who exceedingly com∣plained, that vvhilst the insolency of the Nobilitie en∣creased, the chastisements for it decreased; And that therefore he remembred her, that it vvas a dangerous point in an Aristocracie, when those vvhich vvere to glory for that they were farre from those dangers, vvher∣unto such are subiect, as are to obey the humor of a Prince, be heard to complaine, that they are oppressed by many Tyrants. Hereunto the Venetian Libertie answe∣red,
That the disorder recounted by the Censor vvas true, and vvithall dangerous; but that the authoritie of com∣manding, vvas so annexed to pride and insolencie, that they seemed to be borne both at one birth: And that the licentiousnesse, vvhich the Nobilitie of all Aristo∣cracies vseth towards the Citizens, vvas by all the grea∣test men, that haue discoursed of Commonweales, re∣puted a desperate cure; for although it vvas most necessa∣ry, that insolencies should be restrained vvith seuere paines, yet on the other side, an Aristocracie vvas to ab∣staine as much as possibly might be from publike pu∣nishments of Noble men, albeit seditious; to the end that their shamefull suffering might not be an occasion to disinherit the vvhole Nobilitie it selfe of that respect vvhich is due to them from the people; for hauing the gouernment of the State in their hands, the interest of the publike conservation thereof requireth, that they be held in highest reputation: And although in her Ve∣nice, disobedient, and insolent Noblemen vvere not seene to be so often punished, betweene the two pillars in the Piazza of St. Marke, as it seemeth many desired, yet by the great Councell, the Pregadi, the Colledge, and other supremer Magistrates, that dispence the publike Charges, those seditious Noblemen, vvhich vvere dis∣covered to carry a tyrannicall, mind, were cruelly afflicted vvith the torment of shamefull repulses: And that ma∣ny subiects of most noble Houses are seene in Venice, vvhose ancient reputation for their demerits vvas may∣med by Arquebuses charged vvith bullets of paper; and that beeing strucken downe vvith such kinde of shot, they could neuer rise since to honors and dignities; things vvherein consisteth the life of the Noblemen of
an Aristocracie: And that to excruciate a body, a grea∣ter torture could not be devised, no not by Perillus him∣selfe, then that vvhich once a Nobleman of Venice expe∣rienced, vvhen in a concurrence of the Honorablest Charges, he saw one younger then himselfe passe before him, only because he vvas knowen to the Senate to be more deseruing. Castiglione did not only admit the justifi∣cation of the Venctian Libertie, but also did infinitely commend the circumspection, and severitie, which she vsed in punishing her Nobilitie vpon occasion of any demerit, or defect. Then the Censor said vnto the Dutchy of Savoy, That his State beeing seated in the Confines of France and Italy, he vvas necessited with all carefulnesse to main∣taine himselfe neutrall betweene those Princes, vvith whom he confined; but in those last rumors of France, by discovering himselfe openly to be wholly Spanish, he had put, not only his owne, but the States of all the Princes of Italie in great trouble: And that whilst vvith the bel∣lowes of his forces he blew the fire of the French vprores, kindled by the Spanyards ambition, he ought to beleeve, that that flame vvas to burne vp friends and kined, be∣fore ever it could get to the other Italian Potentates that vvere enemies. The Dutchy of Savoy answered the Cen∣sor very readily, That the adherence of his last Duke to the Spaniards, vvas true, but the faire occasion he had of three seuens in his hand, euen forced him to set vp his rest, hoping to encounter the most famous Primiera, that euer any other Prince vvhatsoever had at Cards; to vvhich venture he vvas the rather carried, because he vvas assored he could lose but that mony, which at that game he had wonne before: That afterwards, though by
his ill luck the fourth Card, vvhich was dealt him, proued to be a Coae of affront, vvherewith he had made the vvorst hit, that could be encountred on the whole packe of Cards, neuerthelesse he knew, that the brauest mindes vvould confesse, that albeit the resolution was very dan∣gerous, yet not to vvrong the Cards, they vvould haue played no otherwise themselues. The Censor apprehen∣ding the Metaphor, very much commended the mag∣nanimous resolution of that Duke; vvho, for that he might from a small feaver haue received in gift the Em∣pire of the greater part of the World, not only without any note of imprudence, but to his infinite glory, at such time as so resolutely he cast the Dye of all the great∣nesse of his fortune vpon the table of Chance, he might well speake those famous vvords anew, Or Caesar, or no∣thing. Then the Censor turned him to the noble Great Dut∣chy of Toscan, and sharpely reprehending him, for going vvith his Galleys, at it vvere prouoking of Waspes, he re∣corded vnto him, the miserie and calamities, vvhich the Kinghts of St. Iohn suffered at Rhodes, at Tripoli, and the great danger, that lastly they ranne at Malta, only because they vvould imprudently haue tyed squibbes to the Buls taile; And that euery vvise Christian Prince ought rather to favour the present carelesnese of the Turks, then to waken them with injuries of litle profit; nay, such as brought others much damage, and necessite them to ap∣ply their mindes anew vnto maritime affaires, which in these times they had euen abandoned: Also he remem∣bred him, how infinite people daily complained, for that, by his hindering Italy of the trade of the commodi∣ties of the Levant, all Drugges, that came from beyond
the Seas, were growen to an excessive rate. To this cor∣rection the great Dutchy of Toscan answered, That the power of a Prince could not be termed perfect, which with a number of armed Vessels had not some Domini∣on on the Sea: And that his Gallies vvere not only very necessary for the Toscan greatnesse, but also for the secu∣ritie of the Libertie of all Italy, as scruing for a Schoole of Mariners, for a Seminary of Captaines, and souldiers at Sea: That he confessed the dammage, which they did to the trade of merchandise, but vvithall, he desired it might be considered, that the mysterie of Warre, either by Land, or Sea, could not be learned by souldiers, nor exercised by Princes without prejudice to others: And that Toscan breeding much filthinesse of fantasticall vn∣quiet braines, and extravagant humors, he had therefore great occasion for those Gallies, that might serve, as it were, to carry forth all the filth of his State, and thereby keepe it cleane, employing such only for gally-slaues in them, as had done euill before, and that in regard of their vnquiet nature, vvere like to doe worse after. This excuse of the Great Dutchy of Toscan vvas ap∣proved both by the Censor, and all the sacred Colledge. Whereupon the Count said vnto the Libertie of Genoua, vvho was last drawen out of the Vrne, That the excessiue vse of exchanges, which she permitted vnto her Nobi∣litie, caused that great disorder of enriching the priuate, and vvithall of empouerishing the publike, vvhose re∣vennues vvould haue risen to huge summes of Gold, if the reall riches of her Nobilitie had beene employed in a just trade of merchandise. The Genouese Libertie with a readinesse, that gaue a particular gust to all the Learned, answered, How it was
true, that exchanges doe vvorke that effect, vvhich the Censor had mentioned, and therefore vvere most pernici∣ous in any Monarchy vvhatsoeuer; howbeit that not∣withstanding they might be permitted in a well-ordered Commonwealth vvithout any prejudice of the publike interests; because the richest, and securest Treasures of a free State, are the riches of the Nobilitie, and Citizens together; a matter, which falleth not out in a Monarchy, where betweene the commings in of the Prince, and the meanes of private men, there runneth a long wall of eight stories high built by Mine, and Thine: Further, that in a Monarchy the mutation of the State commonly followeth vvith litle, or no prejudice to the people, only changing the name of Mathew, to that of Martin; but in the subversions of Commonweales, where libertie is changed into servitude, there the proper substance of private men is the publike treasure; for then will they profusely spend all that ever they haue, for to defend their owne liber∣tie euen to the last gaspe.
CHAP. 11. The Duke of Guise his Secretary is punished for speaking amisse. SOme two dayes since my Lo: of Guise his Secre∣tary, talking vvith certaine French Barons, about the passed tumults of France, in making mention of his Masters partie, he called it the holy League, vvhich beeing reported to his Majestie, he presently com∣manded the Strappado to be given him thrice in publike, and then vvilled him to be told, that for the time to come he should learne how to speake, vvhen he named a diaboli∣call Rebellion.
CHAP. 14. Certaine Persons for example vnto others, are shewed vnto the People APollo, with much displeasure, came to know, how the greater part of moderne Princes, to preuaile ouer their enemies, doe not according to the manner of the ancient Heroes, vse open force of Armes, but (for the most part) fraude; in the practise whereof they are so vnderstanding, that vvith that only powerfull meane they haue brought to passe most important en∣terprises; vvhence it is, that the first vveapon, vvhich they employ against their enemies is that same shamefull corrupting the faith of their male-contented subjects, and stirring vp the Nobilitie to rebellion. To remedy then such grievous disorders, about thirtie yeares past his Maiestie commanded, that the infortunate Count St. Paul, the Prince of Orange, and the Duke of Guize should be closely carried in a Caroch by Gio: Francesco Lottini, the secret Register of Morall precepts in this Court, vnto the porch of the Delphicke Temple; vvhere those three great Princes, vvith their hands, without fingers, and all so foully torne, as if they had beene gnawen with dogges, vvere shewed by Lottini to the people, vvhich came in and out at the Temple; vnto
vvhom vvith a lowd voyce he said: Yee faithfull Ver∣tuous, devoted vnto Learning, and holy Morall pre∣cepts, by this so miserable calamitie of these vnhappy Princes, depriued of the vse of their hands, which God preserue vnto you, take example, and learne vvhat it is for a man to suffer himselfe to be carried to such sim∣plicitie, as to plucke Crabbes out of their holes with his owne hands, for the benefit of ano∣ther.
CHAP. 15. The Monarchy of Spayne inviteth the Cardinall of Toledo to be her Theologian, which he refuseth, and why. THe report goeth in this Court, that the Mighty Monarchy of Spayne, by her chiefe Secretarie in vi∣ted the worthy Cardinall of Toledo, vvith allow∣ance of a large pension, to assist as her Theologian in the Royall Councell of State, to the end that no hing should be determined there, vvhich might be against his conscience: This matter filled the vvhole Court vvith marvaile, in regard euery one knew how litle that Pre∣late in the rebenediction of the most Christian King Henry the 4. favoured the affaires of his Prince; for vvhich cause no man could imagne the occasion, vvherefore so vvise a Queene in a businesse of such weight, should vse the service of so diffident a subiect. Those vvhich make profession best to vnderstand the manner of pro∣ceeding of the advised Spanish Nation, even in this re∣solution acknowledged the inveterate prudence of the Kings of Spayne, vvhose proper custome it is never to be at quiet, vntill that vvith pensions, vvith honora∣ble Charges, with all kinde of loving demonstrati∣ons, and humane deuises, they haue drawen vnto their partie all such great subjects, as they see to be alienated from their Interest, and from vvhom they know, that one day yet they may receive services. The chiefest Confidents of so great a Cardinal, deliuer, that his Lord∣ship very gladly accepted the noble Charge propounded
vnto him; howbeit vvith this condition, (vvhich by the Spaniards vvas presently rejected) that whensoever vvith the authoritie of the sacred Scriptures, vvith the Do∣ctrine of the holy Fathers, vvith the ordinances of the Cannons, he should make the Royall Councell capable, how the resolutions made in it, vvere disagreeing from the Lawes of God, and men; he alone then vvould haue power to hinder the execution of them; and all to the end, the World might know, That the Royall Theolo∣gian in that Councell was only to helpe the conscience of his King vvith the will of God, not to serve for a maske to establish the Dominion of Kingdomes over men; for it seemed too shamefull a matter vnto him, that such a one as he should be employed to au∣thorise the diabolicall impietie of the moderne reason of State, and to make most stinking Assa fetida appeare vnto simple people very excellent Muske.
CHAP. 16. The Spaniards attempt the acqui∣sition of Savoy, but doe not pre∣vaile. SEeing that for to draw the French naile out of the table of Milan, vvhere it vvas fixed, the ill-advised Italian Princes had made vse of the Spanish pickaxe, which entred in such manner into the very table it selfe, that it was neuer possible since to draw it forth with any kinde of pincers whatsoever, all the Potentates of Europe, and especially the Italian Princes, which perceived, that the Spanyards after the servitude of the Milanesi, openly aspired to the absolute Dominion of all Italy, to the end they might secure that remainder of libertie, which is yet resting in her, agreed amongst themselves, that eve∣ry five and twentieth yeare, the Chaine vvhich the Spanyards haue forged for the Italian servitude, should vvith exact diligence be measured by persons thereunto deputed. And comming (a few daies since) accordingly to measure it, the Italian Princes to their infinit amaze∣ment found, that so odious a Chaine vvas encreased vvith fiue most prejudiciall linkes; presently whereupon the Politicall Smithes were called, who very carefully made an aslay of the yron added to the Chaine, and they found that the first linke vvas forged at Piombino, the
other at Finale, the third at Correggio, the fourth at Porto Lungone, and the last at Monaco. Greatly did the Princes marvaile at the strangenesse of this accident, and many of them were ashamed, tht thorough their carelesse simplicitie the Spanyards had encreased the Chaine of the Italian servitude, much more in peace, then they could haue done in warre with foure Armies. With these strange exorbitances, the Italian Princes were so incensed against the Spanyards, that they told them freely, how if they did not containe themselues within the bounds of honestie, and modestie; if the Italian files would not suf∣fise to reduce that miserable Chaine to his due measure, they would make vse of the French; and if with them neither they could obtaine their intent, they would pro∣cure enough from England, and Germany; yea, and in case of desperation they would not sticke to furnish them∣selues with those excellent damasked ones, that are made in Turkie. Whilst the Italian Princes were in this contestation, there arrived a Poste, which in all hast had beene dispatched out of Italy vnto them with this cer∣taine aduertisement, That the Spaniards were forging another linke in Savoy, to be added vnto the Chaine of their servitude: in regard of which newes, the renow∣ned Venetian Libertie instantly opened her famous Arse∣nall, and all the Princes of Italy ranne to arme them∣selues; the warlike French Monarchy cōmanded her No∣bilitie to horse, all Germany put themselves in order to passe the mountaines, and the numerous Fleetes of the English, and Hollanders, set saile towards the streights of Gibraltar; when just in the nicke, even as all the World was in Armes, a new Poste arrived, vvho pa∣cified
the minds of men with this intelligence, that indeed it was true, how the Spanyards had labou∣red vvith all possible industry to forge that most important Linke of Savoy, but that they had sweat in vaine, because in the soldering, it broke.
CHAP. 17. The Duke d'Alva beeing arrived at Pernassus, in complementing with Prospero Colonna, they fall foule about de∣frauding the Colonesi of their Titles. DOn Hernando de Toledo Duke d'Alva, a few dayes since, arrived at Pernassus, and by expresse order from Apollo, a diligent examination of his actions beeing made by the militarie men, he was found wor∣thy to be admitted into Pernassus amongst those famous Captaines, which without effusion of bloud, knew how to vanquish an enemy, more by patience, and art, then by open force; or valour; that durst hazard the fortune of Kingdomes vpon the doubtfull chance of a Battaile. But because Lodovico Guicciardino, an vnderstanding Writer of the affaires of Flanders; had preferred a Complaint, how that for certaine matters not very pleasing, vvhich he had written of the Duke, he had beene ill entreated by him, therefore he stayed a long time to cleare him∣selfe of such an imputation; for there was an Edict of Apollo very rigorously observed in Pernassus, whereby that Prince, or private man, was declared to be infamous, which durst offer any wrong to any Historian, or other Writer, for things written by him not very honorable, but yet true: Howbeit, of such power were the Dukes friends that Guicciardino was contented to revoke his complaint,
whereupon withall the greatest solemnitie he was ad∣mitted into Pernassus, and had a place in his Majesties Company of men at Armes, which was commanded by that famous Quintus Fabius Maximus; who for the ex∣cellencie of his well-aduised warinesse, was surnamed Cunctator. And it happened, that amongst the other Prin∣ces, and Captaines, which the said Duke visited, one was the most excellent Lord Prospero Colonna, by whom he was receiued with all kind of honour; and so much the more, because he vnderstood that the Duke made a pub∣like profession of beeing the disciple, follower, and imitator of his slow, but sure way of making warre. How∣beit, a strange and troublesome accident fell out in this visitation; for at the first meeting, the Duke having given the Lord Prospero the Title of your Honour, he was so incensed with disdaine, that taking himselfe to be highly wronged by so vile a title, with an angry voyce he said; Duke, I had thought thou wert come hither, to ho∣nor one that is greater then thy selfe, not to vndervalew him; but because it is the fashion of the Colonesi to an∣swere the injuries of words with deedes, goe out of this house, and in the street (with my sword in mine hand) I will prooue vnto thee, that all those, vvhich vse such base termes to men of my ranke, deserve not to be ad∣mitted into the Company of honourable persons. The Duke remained much astonished to see that great Cap∣taine take the matter so hainously at his hands; and going to withstand the Lord Prospero, who offered to thrust him out of the chamber, they fell to grapple one with another: And because the Spanyards, which were in company with the Duke, seeing him in such termes
with Colonna, entred into the chamber to assist him: the Italians which belonged vnto the Lord Prospero did the like; whereupon in regard of the number of persons in so streit a place, there ensued a cruell frey; the noyse whereof comming into the street, was the cause that the newes of so dangerous an accident was suddainly carried to Apollo; who in all hast dispatched thither the Regent of the Vicaria vvith the guard of Archers, who freed the Duke out of the Lord Prosperoes hands: and the vprore beeing quieted, hee commanded the Spanyards, that had beene very ill handled, to returne home to their houses; Thereupon the Lord Prospero, to prevent any sinister information that might haue beene given a∣gainst him, presented himselfe before Apollo, vnto whom (the fame goeth) with a troubled countenance he vsed these vvords: Sir, it is well knowen, that men of the fa∣mily of Colonna, of the qualitie I am of, haue alwaies enjoyed the title of Excellencie, antequam Abraham fieret, and ere the Spanyards were in rerum natura; Wherefore for that Nation to abuse a man of my ranke, as the Duke d' Alva did me but now, is most insupportable; for if the vilenesse of him that offendeth, doth infinitely aggra∣vate the injurie vvith him that is offended, how is it pos∣sible, that an Italian Baron of my qualitie, should con∣taine himselfe within the bounds of modestie, seeing himselfe vndervalewed by that Nation, whose miseries, not aboue foure dayes agoe to speake of, so mooved the whole World to compassion, that throughout all Chur∣ches they were recommended to the charitie of well-dis∣posed Christians, of whom almes were gathered, to free them from the miserable servitude, wherein they were
so grievously oppressed by the of Moores of Granada. The Spanyards enjoy the dominion of the greater part of Italy; where, by such as I am, notwithstanding that daily they threaten it vvith a cruell, and vniversall servitude, they are loved, honoured, and even served. With their pro∣digious avarice they haue deprived vs of out wealth; and in that lamentable sacke of Rome vvith their vnexpressa∣ble lust they violated the honour of our chastest Ma∣trons. And now, in exchange of so abject a patience, they would also take from vs this litle honour of breath wee enjoy, and these miserable Titles, the vnhappy re∣maines, and deplorable reliques of the Italian reputation: Which is a matter so hard to be digested, that by every honourable Italian Baron it ought to be revenged, not vvith complayning words, as I doe, but vvith daggers points. It is reported by them that vvere then present, how all the while the Lord Prospero was speaking, Apollo did nothing but smile, and that when vpon his conclusion he burst out into those words, how the Spanyards abuses towards the Italians vvere to be revenged with daggers points, he fel to laughing out-right, and said, Prospero, thou art, and ever wert too much given over to choller: and I am inforced to tel thee, how it infinitly mislikes me, that such a one as thou, who hast alwaies made a particular profession of prudence, shouldest marvaile, that slaves, which for twentie yeares together have beene fedde in the Gallyes vvith course, and mouldy Bisket, when they light vpon a batch of new white Manchet, should fill their bellies till they are ready to cracke againe: Where∣as that raging appetite of theirs, and every other disho∣nest
act, vvhich they vse, to asswage their hunger, ought to be so farre from seeming odious vnto honest men which behold it, that it should rather moove them to pittie. Therefore do yee Italians likewise permit, that the Spanyards, men but new in this World, and lately got out of the servitude of the Moores of Granada, may glut them∣selves with meate so delicate to their taste, as are the ho∣nourable Titles, vvhich they haue found in Italy: for I assure thee, that vvhen they shalbe cloyed vvith such va∣nities they also vvill become, as the French are, such cur∣teous Gallants, that they vvill vvillingly giue the Title of Excellency even to their horse-boyes, much more to such as thou art. And I tell thee, that if thou hadst that prudence, and that perfect knowledge of the World, as I vvish thou haddest, thou vvouldest very well perceive, that those exorbitances, and that so odious manner of proceeding, which the Spanyards vse in Italy, whereof thou so complaynest, is even as so much sweet suger for you Italians, and bitter poyson for the Spanyards; who if to their valour, to their advisednesse, and vnspeakeable ambition vvhich they haue to raigne, they had affable and curteous manners annexed, vvith the vtter destructi∣on of that remnant of Libertie, which is yet out of the Lyons jawes, they would soon become absolute Masters of the World. All which are insolencies, that vvith dag∣gers points, not by you Italians, but by the Monarchy of Spayne herselfe, ought to be revenged vvith all kinde of crueltie on her Spanish Ministers, who with their vanitie distaste the good servants of so great a Queene, and make her government nothing acceptable to her sub∣jects: A disorder that bringing much difficultie to the substance of that Vniversal Monarchy, wherunto it is not
possible she can arrive vvith the publike hatred of all Italy, hath high need of remedie. With this answere Apollo returned the Lord Prospero exceeding well satisfied to his house, after whom the Duke d'Alva appeared before his Majesty with all his fa∣mily wonderfull melancholy, vvhich cast such milke in their faces, that the Spanyards seemed not so blacke, as ordinarily those Moores that come out of Granada vse to be. Then Apollo interrupting the complaint vvhich the Duke was about to make against the Lord Colonna, said; Duke, I am much displeased vvith the disorder, vvhich I vnderstand hath happened, and so much the more, by how much the cause of such an vprore is not very just, nor vvithall very honourable on thy side: And vpon this occasion it pleaseth me to remember vnto you Spanyards, that to be not only niggards, as to all men ye are knowen, but not to vse prodigalitie in giving vnto others those Titles, vvhich are desired, is a manifest signe of malignitie, because the ingenuous nobilitie of a Baron is knowen, by shewing litle covetousnesse in receiving Titles, and much liberalitie in giving them: For even by over much, not by due honour, doth greater reputation accrew to him that giveth, then to him that receiveth it. And you Spanyards, that vse such austeritie in desiring great Titles onely for your selves, are not avvhit encrea∣sed in reputation, but rather are become so odious, and ridiculous to all men, that the Italians in their Comedies, haue deservedly introduced the personage of the Spanyard to represent vnto the World a perfect Braggadochia. I won∣der yee should not preceive, that in thinking to arrive vnto the Dominion of the earth by abusing men, is the vvrong way to the wood; The mindes of men (Duke)
are taken vvith the baite of humanitie, vvith the whistle of gratitude, of courtesie, of gentlenesse; and that Fowler would shew himselfe very ignorant, that should goe with a drumme into a Dove-house for to take Pigeons, as I see you Spanyards, foolishly doe. More∣over, I tell you, that if ever any Nation vvere to make a baite of dignities, for to allure the Italians to fall into the nets of your Dominions, and light vpon the Lime∣bush of your servitude, it is you Spanyards, for the ends vvhich yee haue vpon Italy: Withall yee are to consider, that the States, vvhich yee possesse, of Naples, and Milan, are fastned vnto you with Waxe; for yee shall command over those two members no longer, then till the Italians resolve to chase you from thence; who if they could be assured, that after your ruine, they should not fall into the power of the French, ye should quickly know, that only vvith a litle disturbance, which they could give you in the Port of Genoua, they would put you into a thou∣sand intricate difficulties: all matters, that should admo∣nish you to give satisfaction, at leastwise in vvords, to them, whom in regard of your Interests in Italy, yee are obliged to respect. As for the injurie, vvhich you say you have received from the Lord Prospero, I tell you plainly, that whatsoever affront shalbe done you vpon any such like Titular occasion, I vvill not onely be insensible of it, but I vvill thinke you haue desirously sought it. Then the Duke would have excused himselfe vvith saying, that from his King he had instruction how to carry him∣selfe towards the Italian Barons in the particular of Titles, vvhen Apollo told him, that the Spanish abuses to the Italians were not to extend but only to the Neapoli∣tans, and Milanesi; and his Majestie also added, That if
much passion did not blind the Spanyards, they might easily see, how their Grandes, whom Spayne it selfe could not containe, and that in Italy, would play the Gyants, compared with the Romane Barons; and those of meane stature would prove but dwarsses. Herevpon a cloude, as white as snow, beginning by litle and litle to cover the person of Apollo, the Priests that were about him percei∣ved how his Maiestie would prophecie; so that every one falling prostrate on the ground, and vvith the rest, the Duke and his followers; out of that hollow cloud proceeded the divine voyce of his Majestie, which with a pleasing sound spake in this sort: I fortell vnto you, Spanyards, that vvith your rough and odious manner of proceeding, yee vvill one day compell the Italian Nobi∣tie; which is the Mistres of the cruell Sicilian Vespres, to plot some bloudy Neapolitan Even-song against you; it beeing the proper custome of the Italians, with greater rage to revenge the abuses of words, then the offences of blowes; as they that having short patience, and long hands, are borne not only with an heart most inclined to great resolutions, but that doe not vse to revenge in∣juries with all kind of crueltie, before they are quite for∣gotten by those that did them. And with your owne ruine, you vvill then finde them, with swords in their hands, to be Paladine Orlandoes, when ye shall per∣swade your selves, they are become most suffering Asses.
The Poste of Pernassus to the Reader. THese Papers comming by chance into my hands, I perceived there was something in them that I could not perceive; wherefore I thought best to communicate them with better vnderstandings: for my part I could see no hurt in them, but did imagine by that little good vvhich I saw, there was much more that I could not see, and therefore judged them fit for all mens eyes. Yet finding the names of Spayne and Austria, or Austria and Spayne, (pardon me, politicke Reader, for I am not certaine vvhich should have priority; and I know in such Catholike points, a little error is deadly) so often inserted, I durst not be too bold with sacred things. For I well saw those two names joyntly considered, are now growne of such estimation, as all Nations and Kings bend their knees, and doffe their Bonnets at the naming of them; more superstitiously for destroying, then reve∣rently at the Name of Iesus for saving. Therefore I could not resolve, vvhether it were treason or sacriledge, or I wot not what greater sinne, to touch sacred things pro∣fanely with common and vnwasht hands; especially when I saw all such as had done the like, or lesse then thus, made miserable examples of disobedience, as if they had offended Adam himselfe, or a house miraculously raysed vp by God, or rather originally created in nature, to rule over all the vvorld in Adams stead; and that to be
the sonne of a King, could not protect an offendor in this kind from punishment, yea, from being cast out of his Paradise. O (thought I) vvhen I saw this, how wor∣thy is he, that doth thus to be counted onely the Catho∣lique King: for he is a King of kings indeed, fit to be the executioner of his Holinesse divine Decrees, and to consume all vvith Lightning, vvhere the sacred fulmina∣tions vvent before. Tremble all Princes, and looke to your Crownes; especially you perty ones in Germany, that are but fatted to be swallowed one after another, as his stomacke can digest, or your turne comes to bee served vp. You see it is safer beeing his servant, then the sonne of any Potentate besides. Therefore strive for place and preferment there, and helpe vvith all the speed yee may, to betray one another to ruine. You that are Pro∣testants or Lutherans, it is no matter for Religion; hold some the stirrop, and let others lift Spayne into the sad∣dle, to ride one another like Poste-horses by turnes. You see how honourably hee deales with that Prince, whose peaceable patents made him easie entrance; and how fauourably vvith the Palatinate, vvhom hee rides in bloud, and spur-galls on both sides, vvhilst you stand laughing on, and see not that your day is comming. Thus I thought, and thought withall to be silent, and to keepe these Papers from flying abroad, for feare of ha∣ving my owne vvings clipt. But vvhen I saw in defect of greater, God had raysed vp petty Princes to defend the Faith, and put that spirit into the Prince of Orange, the Count Manfelt, and the Duke of Brunswicke, vvhich hee had taken from Saxony and Bavaria, and others, it made me resume courage, beholding the immediate hand of God in this vvorke, and to thinke, surely God vvill have
all the glory to himselfe, that hee employes such instru∣ments, vvhose estates, in comparison, are but drops to the Spanish Ocean: I vvill not therefore be guilty of so much cowardize, as to reserve my selfe, vvhere these men fight, and seeme prodigall of their owne lives; or at least, not of so much dishonesty, as to con∣ceale what God hath sent into my hands, perhaps to publish for the generall information and benefit of all Christendome. Goe out therefore, and pros∣per in Gods Name. FINIS.
