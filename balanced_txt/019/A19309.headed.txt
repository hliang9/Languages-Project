¶ TO THE RIGHT HO∣norable, Sir VVilliam Cecil, Knight, Ba∣ron of Burleygh, Lorde high Treasurer of Englande, Maister of the Queenes Maiesties Courtes of Wardes and Liueries, Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, and one of her Highnesse most honorable priuie Counsel, continuance of health, with prosperitie and increase of honour. IT hath bin reported (Right Honourable and my verie good Lorde) and is founde true of al men, that the Bee, when she hath gathered her hony, flieth immediatly to the hiue, wher she leueth the same, as in the place of saue∣garde for her fruite, and as a gaine of her labour: whose paine as it is commended of al, so also is it diligently folowed but of a few, who whilest they come to the sweete flowers and wise sen∣tences of the worde of God, doe but basely reade and negligently consider the same, whereas they shoulde drawe and sucke out, yea, and laye vp euen with the Bee, to their best vse, most pleasant hony. And this they should doe, not onely for themselues, but also for o∣ther. For huing to the profite of the Church of God, they imparie their labours to the benefite there of, yea besides the foode to their own soules, other are com∣forted by them: as amongst other (Right honorable) Maister Michael Cope, Preacher of the word of God
in Geneua, deserued not the least praise, who painfully trauelling in the Prouerbes of Solomon, did not one∣ly read them for his owne delight, but also sucked out of euerie flower of the same Garden, most sweete ho∣nie: which beeing faithfully gathered and disposed in the Hiue, he left as a fruite of his labour to al posteri∣tie, for al the godly to be partakers of. Now for that it is not the gift of euery man to driue the Hiue wher∣in the Bee gathereth her honie (although I knowe that many can, amongest whome your honour may bee equal with the best) yet because it was preached, and then written in the Frenche tongue, which most vnderstande not, I thought it vnmeete, that so sweete a nourishment should be with holden from my coun∣trie men: & therfore haue bin bold vnder your honors protection to communicate it as wel as I coulde for their profite and commoditie, which I am bolde the rather to dedicate to your honour; because you loue those that liue to other; because you are a Patron, & so haue shewed yourselfe of al honest labors, who albeit you vnderstande the tongue, yet are you glad to haue it made known vnto others. These things cōsidered, & for that also I haue receiued benefit heretofore at your honours hands, I thought it my bounden duetie, to de∣dicate the translation of this Comentarie vpon the Prouerbes of the wise King Solomō to your honor: assuring my selfe, that your care wil be no lesse in the protecting of so good a woorke, then there shal happen profite to the wise reader thereof: for what woulde any man desire for the full accomplishe∣ment of knowledge, belonging to all estates, that
is not handled in the Prouerbes? Or what woulde he desire for his profit, that is not cōteined in the Pro∣uerbes? for therin shal euerie man finde, from the high∣est to the lowest, his duetie prescribed most notably, as for Kinges, godlinesse, iustice and mercy: for Ma∣gistrates and Iudges, wisedome and true dealing: for rich men, liberalitie to the poore: againe, that the poore be contented with his estate, without mur∣muring: to be short, he teacheth the husbande fideli∣tie: the wife, obedience: children, reuerence: seruants, diligence: finally, he setteth downe a punishment for the proude, a reward for the lowlie, a dangerous e∣state for scorners and disdainers of the word of God: the life of a lier altogether vnlawful: the vsurer, co∣uetous, and vnchast, cleane condemned. Contrari∣wise, he exhorteth that the merciful, liberal, and wel doers, be imitated and folowed: al which and a thou∣sande more then I am able to repeate, as they are most notably set downe by the wise King Solomon, so are they verie learnedly, and most plainely declared by Maister Cope. Wherefore (Right honourable) since that the maiestie of the matter is so great, and the wisdom of the wise man so vnsearchable: I trust your Lordship wil beare with my rudenesse, and supporte mine endeuour in publishing and making manifest this simple translation to al men. And although I am not a translator of suche rypenesse in iudgement, and perfection in style, as the matter requireth, and as I my selfe coulde haue wished: notwithstanding, I hope I haue rendered it at the leaste, sense for sense: and where the Frenche and our tongue doe
agree, verbatim; that out of the wordes, one may ga∣ther the sense; and out of the sense the reason, and so ob∣taine the trueth: most humblie beseeching your ho∣nour to take in good part this my rude labour & bold enterprise, the which if it shal please your honour of your accustomed clemencie to doe, you shal not one∣ly incourage me to greater thinges, but also shew yourselfe a comfort to al the godly. And thus beeing loth to offend your honour by tediousnes, or to withhold you from your graue & most waightie affayres, I be∣seech the Almightie God by Iesus Christ our Saui∣our, long to preserue your honour in health, wealth, and godlinesse, to the glorie of his name, pro∣fit of his Church, & good of this our com∣mon weale & countrie, & to your own euerlasting comforte in him. Amen. Your honours most humble to commaund, Marcelline Outred.

A familiar exposition of Michael Cope vpon the Prouerbes of Solomon. 1 THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Is∣rael. 2 To know wisedome & instruction, to vnderstande the wordes of knowledge. 3 To receiue instruction to doe wisely by iustice and iudgement and equitie. THe parables &c. The Lorde appea∣red 1. King. 3. 9. in Gibeon to Solomon in a dreame by night: and God sayde, aske what I shall giue thee. And Solo∣mon sayd, giue therefore vnto thy ser∣uant an vnderstanding harte to iudge thy people, that I may discerne be∣tweeene good and bad. And GOD sayd vnto him, bycause thou hast as∣ked this thing, &c. Beholde I haue done according to thy woorde: loe I haue giuen thee a wise and an vnderstanding heart, so that there hath beene none lyke thee, before thee, neither after thee shal arise the lyke vnto thee. Through this wisedome and vnderstanding he iudged the people of Israel of whome hee was feared. By this selfe same wisedome hee spake three thousand parables: as it is written. This was whyles hee was king ouer Israel, that hee vsed such wisdome in doings and sayinges: euen whyles hee 1. King. 4. 32 was a peaceable king, according to the promises of GOD. Beholde, a sonne is borne vnto thee, which shalbee a man of rest, for I will giue him rest from all his enimies rounde about; therefore his name is 1. Chro. 22. 9 Solomon: and I will sende peace and quietnesse vppon Israel in his dayes. All kings, Princes and Magistrates, shoulde here learne where∣to they ought to apply their vnderstanding, and what they should flee and hate. To knowe, &c. Albeeit wee are not kings, neither worldly princes,
nor haue publike charge, yet ought we to follow the wisdome of goo Kings and Princes, as they are giuen vs of God for an example. And forasmuch as we haue not at al tymes wise superiours, as experience teacheth, yet haue we need at al tymes to be wise, vnlesse we wil perish with the foolish. For neither the folly of the great or smal shal excuse vs to bee culpable of damnation, if we followe it and delite therein. And therefore Solomon was not onely content to be as a mirrour of wisedome to those of his time, but woulde also profit al ages, so long as the world shoulde last: and to this ende hath he written these nota∣ble prouerbes and excellent sentences, profitable to teach one to go∣uerne himself wisely in al holinesse and honestie, in al righteousnes and innocency, in al modestie and sobrietie, in the faith and feare of God, as it shalbe knowne in hearing and reading them. But to make vs more attentiue and diligent to reade and heare them, and to print them in our memory, to delite also in speaking of them, chiefly to the instru∣ction of the ignorant: hee at the beginning sheweth vs wheretoo and to whome these sentences doe serue. If wee were not very dul & bloc∣kish, wee woulde greatly desire to bee adorned with these vertues. Wherefore wee must neither be deafe nor negligent, but ready and di∣ligent to heare the Prouerbes of king Solomon, whereby hee promi∣seth to teach vs first wisdome: not the wisdome of this world, neither 1. Cor. 2. 6. of the princes of this world, which perish. Such wisdom is foolishnesse before God, who gaue Solomō this wisdom which he teacheth by these Prouerbes. If then we learne them truly, and delite in that which they teach, wee shalbee indued with heauenly wisedome. The which as it is and hath beene euer one, so let vs not thinke that Solomon doeth teach any newe thing: for it is sayde, Yee shal put nothing vnto the Deut. 4. 2. woorde which I commaunde you, neither shal yee take ought there∣from &c. The wisedome then that hee teacheth vs, is to cleaue faste to the worde of God, in walking after his commandementes. It is that wisdome, which Moses taught the children of Israel in the same place Deut. 4. saying: beholde, I haue taught you ordinances and lawes, as the Lorde my God commanded mee, &c. But heere it might bee sayde that Solo∣mon needed not to haue written, seing Moses had before already writ∣ten, and that hee teacheth no other wisedome, but that which Moses taught. It may bee aunswered, that that which Moses hath briefly and obscurely taught for the capacitie of the people, Solomon dila∣teth
and amplifieth, and therein hee serueth as an interpreter to Mo∣ses. But it may bee sayde againe, if Solomon doe teache no other wisedome, than that which Moses taught, that hee teacheth not Iesus Christ, who of God is made vnto vs wisedome and righteousnes: and 1. Cor. 1. 10. therefore his doctrine appertaineth nothing vnto vs, which should re∣garde to knowe nothing but Iesus Christ, and him crucified: I aun∣swere, that Moses hath spoken of Iesus Christ. If you had beleeued Iohn. 5. 46. Gal. 3. 24. Moses, you woulde also haue beleeued mee. The lawe was our schoolemaister to bring vs to Christ, &c. But Solomon teacheth not onely the lawe, but also fayth: and setteth foorth vnto vs diuers promises of GOD, and consequently hee teacheth vs Iesus Christ, of whome also hee was a figure: for all the promises of God are yea, and Amen in Iesus Christ. Wherefore when wee heare the Pro∣uerbes 2. Cor. 1. 20. of Solomon, let vs not thinke that he wil leade vs only to doe the workes of the lawe outwardly▪ but that chiefly he tendeth to frame our manners to the feare and reuerence of God, the which is not done without fayth. Secondly, hee promiseth vs Instruction. Whereby wee shoulde knowe what to doe and what to eschue, for to liue in this present worlde soberly, righteously, and religiously: the which instruction is not onely in woordes, but also in temptations and afflictions. Wherevppon it followeth that Solomon beeing on earth, spake not Deut. 8. 1. earthly, but heauenly: for wee can haue no instruction, vnlesse God speake to vs from Heauen, as Moses doeth shewe it very well. Out of Heauen hee made thee heare his voyce to instruct thee, &c. Deut. 4. 46. Wherfore, if we be giuen to earthly and worldly things, and perseuere therein, wee cannot receiue instruction. It is then needful for vs to withdrawe ourselues from the desire of worldly thinges, and that by the meanes of Gods grace. For S. Paul saith, For the grace of God that Tit. 2. 11. bringeth saluation vnto al men, hath appeared, and teacheth vs that wee should deny vngodlinesse and worldly lustes, and that wee shoulde liue soberly and righteously and godly in this present world. Thirdly, he promiseth that we shall haue knowledge and vnderstan∣ding in the lawe and woorde of God: the which onely is our knowe∣ledge and vnderstanding. It is sayde also in Iohn, And heereby wee are Deut. 4. 8. 1. Iohn. . . sure that wee knowe him, if wee keepe his commaundementes. This knowledge ought to bee greatly esteemed of vs, as Ieremie admoni∣sheth
vs theretoo. Let not the wise man glory in his wisedome, &c. But let him that glorieth, glorie in this, that hee vnderstandeth and Ier. 9. 23. knoweth mee. Thorowe this knowledge we differ from brute beastes. Wee ought then to giue good heede to these sayinges of the wyse Psal. 32. 9. man: Fourthly, hee promiseth vs Instruction to doe wisely, that is to say, that by his sayings we shall learne to bee wel ruled and gouer∣ned, and also that willingly wee shall heare those which shewe vs our faultes: and chiefly those which are expert and wise, which knowe howe to reprooue, and vse it in tyme and place: that by their corre∣ction wee may amende our life and become wyse. And by these sen∣tences hee laboureth to withdrawe vs from death, wheretoo the ob∣stinate and stubborne are bent. Or despisest thou the riches of his Rom. 2. 4. bountifulnesse and patience, and long sufferance, not knowing that the bountifulnesse of God leadeth thee to repentance? &c. Finally, they serue so to frame our harts, that we should delite to giue to our neigh∣bours that which is theirs, to suffer no man to doe them wrong, and to gouerne vs in such wyse that no man finde in vs any thing worthy of reproofe or blame. Wee learne then by these woordes to doe wel to all men, to hurt no man, and to bee a good example to our neigh∣bours and not offensiue vnto them. And heerein wee begin a blessed lyfe, and to possesse the kingdome of heauen, wherein is our abyding: but those which doe the contrary, begin euen now their hel. As farre as wee can hitherto see, these sayings learne vs to feare and serue God, and to agree with our neighbours, and accomplish our saluation. 4 To giue vnto the simple sharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and discretion. After that he hath shewed whereto these sentences serue, he nowe declareth to whom they are profitable: & continueth furthermore in shewing what profite commeth of them. By the simple hee vnderstan∣deth those, which neither haue wit nor wisedome to gouerne them∣selues, nor yet can discerne good from euill, to doe the one, and flye the other: and so are easily to be deceiued, and may sooner be persuaded to folowe wickednesse than righteousnesse, to choose rather that which is hurtfull vnto them, than their profite. We are all of this nature, if we be left vnto ourselues. Adam hath wel shewed it vnto vs, and not only Gen. 3. shewed, but also from him, as frō a spring hath this simplicitie flowed
into all mankind. But although it bee natural and come by succession, yet if we perseuere therein, we shall not be excusable: but as by it wee shall haue folowed wickednesse and chosen our hurt, euen so by it shal we miserably perishe with the wicked. For sith that God doeth teach vs by his word, to take heed from being seduced, in giuing vs warning of the craftie inuentions and enterprises of Satan, of the deceitfulnes of the worlde, & the alluring of our owne concupiscences, and offring vs his helpe, fauour, and grace: there is no falt then but in ourselues, that this hurtfull simplicitie is not taken from vs, and that wee haue not this sharpnesse of wit, knowledge and discretion, which the wise man promiseth vnto the simple, which applie and studie his sayinges with all their heart. When he maketh such promise, wee must vnder∣stand that it is not good to be simple, as are those, which S. Paule spea∣keth Rom. 16. 18. of, that suffer themselues to be deceiued with false teachers. Yet he meaneth not that wee shoulde forsake simplicitie, but so farre as it proceedeth of our naughtie and corrupt nature, and that through this corruption it is accompanied either with malice or ignorance, or else with them both. Such simplicitie as is ioyned with wisdom and know∣ledge, whereby a man fleeth all euill with all his might, is much com∣mendable. Ephe. 4. 18. Herewithall it behoueth vs to be beautified, as S. Paule ex∣horteth vs. But yet I would haue you wise, vnto that which is good; and simple concerning euill. And, Bee not children in vnderstanding, Rom. 16. 19 but as concerning maliciousnesse bee children, but in vnderstanding, be of a rype age. And the childe. Forasmuch as the yonger sort are 1. Cor. 14. 20 commonly simple, Solomon ioyneth them togeather, and promiseth that if they giue good eare to his Prouerbes, they shall obtaine know∣ledge and discretion. He setteth knowledge first: for without it children become stifnecked, folowing their fansies, affections and lustes, not regarding what shall happen therof, neither cōmonly are constant: but are nowe of one opinion, and by and by of an other: nowe will they one thing, and immediately after the contray. But when Solomon spake of children, promising them knowledge and aduertisment, he had not respect only to the age, but to the vnderstanding. So, of what age soeuer wee be, if we be voide of all knowledge and discretion, it is ve∣ry needeful for vs to heare the sentences of the wise man, and all such like doctrine: and chiefly to bee attentiue vnto the doctrine of the A∣postles, Ephe. 4. &
5 A wise man shall heare and encrease in learning: and a man of vnderstanding shal attaine vnto wise counsels. 6 To vnderstand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wise, and their darke sayings. As the prouerbes of Solomon are necessarie and profitable to the simple and to children for their well framing of their heartes, and right directing of their waies: so are they to the wise, for the encreasing of their wisedome and further knowledge. Wherby it appeareth that not the simple children ought to be the schollers & disciples of Solomō, but also the wise. Those then which count themselues so wise that they thinke they haue no neede to learne, & therefore contemne both prea∣ching and reading of the holy scriptures: not onely are voide of wise∣dome, but also as much as in them is, they make the holy Ghost a lyar, which hath spoken by the mouth of Solomon. And that we be not of the number of such people, let vs be continuall schollers of our God, and doe after the counsell of S. Iames. If any of you lacke wisedome, let him aske of God, which giueth to all men liberally, and reprocheth Iam. 1. 5. no man, and it shall be giuen him. So doing we shall increase in wise∣dome and learning: for to him that hath, it shalbe giuen, and hee shal abound, & from him that hath not, euen that hee hath, shalbe taken a∣way. And a man of vanderstanding. To the end that we should be more diligent vpon doctrine and neuer to waxe weary of learning to vnderstand more perfectly the trueth, Solomon sheweth vs what pro∣fite commeth thereof, besides that which hee hath declared already in saying, And a man of vanderstanding shall attaine vnto wise coun∣sels. As Solomon hath not asked worldly riches, neither the pleasures and desires of the flesh▪ but hath asked wisedome and prudence, to go∣uerne both him and his people: so also he promiseth not to the man of vnderstanding that he shal haue temporall goodes, and that hee shall liue at ease in this worlde, but he promiseth him wise counsels: the which he expresseth by a worde that signifieth diligence and sharpnes of wit to gouerne. Therewith shall those be endued, which being wise and learned do alwaies pursue more and more to profite in the know∣ledge of the trueth: for they shal knowe howe to moderate and rule both themselues and their owne affections, and to keepe them vnder that they doe not raigne: and also shalbee fitte and meete to shewe
others the way to doe the like. Heere we are taught what the gouer∣ners both of the Church and Common weale ought to bee: to wit, that such should bee ordeined, which both loue the trueth, and are ex∣ercised therein. Wee learne also that after wee haue hearde and knowen, wee must not bee idle, but bring foorth fruites. Moreouer, Mat. 7. 24. that without hearing the word of God, no man can bee wise, neither profite himselfe nor any other, and that they which doe not gouerne themselues after the worde of God, must needes be ignorant & blind, Iames. 1. 22. and fal into many vices: that they are not onely vnprofitable, but also hurtful to themselues and to their neighbours. 6 To vnderstand. Solomon hath already counted vnto vs ma∣ny fruits, which they receiue that apply their wittes to his sentences: but yet there he setteth foorth vnto vs, foure. The first is, that wee shal vnderstand the notable and excellent sentences of those which haue spoken by figures and similitudes, to make them of more authoritie and estimation, and that men shoulde bee more diligent to search out the meaning of them, and that they might bee hid from them which are blinde of vnderstanding, and that seeing, they should not see &c. The seconde commoditie which they receiue, is to interprete and to expound these notable and excellent sentences to the edifiyng of the Church: that the rude and ignorant might knowe so much as is expedient for their saluation. The third is, to iudge and discerne the wordes of the wise, from those of the foolish, the which oftentymes haue a fayre shewe of wisedome and holinesse, and seeme at the first sight to please God: albeit they be abhominable to him. The sayings of the wise, as of Moses, of the Patriarches, and Prophetes, and o∣ther holie men be not of any great outwarde shew, and yet for all that be not lesse pleasing vnto GOD: for though they bee vttered by the mouthes of men, yet are they neuerthelesse the wordes of God: the which those may iudge that giue good eare to the Prouerbes of Solo∣mon, and such lyke doctrine. Many are deceiued through the fayre shewe of mens wordes, and therefore wee must knowe the woorde of God, and not to beholde only with other mens eyes: that in no wise wee bee deceiued with the fayre shewe which properly belongeth to false Prophetes and teachers, of whome Iesus Christ commaundeth vs to beware. The fourth is, to vnderstande that which the wise haue Math. 7. 1. spoken darkly, as when they haue spoken of Gods prouidence, of pre∣destination
and election of Saintes, of reprobation and reiection of the wicked, and such like matters, which are al obscure and darke vnto the wicked, who iudge all thinges to come to passe by chaunce, albeit they are gouerned by the counsel and prouidence of God. But let vs marke, that when Solomon doeth attribute, all these fruites to his notable Prouerbes, hee meaneth not that all they which become attentiue to them, are perfectly partakers of all these fruites. For it is written. Wee know in parte, & we prophecie in parte: But when that which is per∣fect 1. Cor. 13. 20. is come, then that which is in parte, shalbe abolished. Again, Now wee see through a glasse darkely: but then shal we see face to face. E∣uen so these fruites are the giftes of God, who doth distribute them as 1. Cor. 12. 8. Ephe. 4. 11. seemeth him good. 7 The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue despised wisedome and instruction. Because that in the beginning of the tenth Chapter there is writ∣ten, The Prouerbes of Solomon, as if it were the title of the booke: some iudge that that which is written from this place thither, is the preface of the booke, the argument whereof is gone before, to shewe vs wheretoo these doe serue, and to what persons they are profita∣ble. In this preface hee vseth generall exhortations, hee promiseth, and hee threateneth and commaundeth, and maketh as it were an ex∣position of the ten commandementes, commending vnto vs the true wisedome, the feare and seruice of God, the obedience towardes pa∣rents, the labour of the handes, the eschuing of excesse, & worthinesse of marriage. 7 The feare of the Lorde. In the beginning of this preface, hee teacheth vs the way to attaine vnto true knowledge. For as the true knowledge wherein wee must glory, is to knowe God, when being in∣structed Ier. 9. 24. in his lawe, we delight to follow it: euen so wee must vnder∣stand that the feare of the Lord wherof Solomon doth speak, is an hu∣militie and reuerence, whereby we may tremble at the word of God: not that wee shoulde mistrust his goodnesse, but diligently to beware from displeasing him, & to endeuour ourselues to doe such thinges as please him. This is the feare which the angel doth attribute vnto Abra∣ham. This is the feare that God requireth of his people. This feare is Gen. 22. 12. Deu. 10. 12. Deu. 4. 10. of Moses called, wisdome &, vnderstanding. Solomō then hath drawne
this from Moses, when he saide, The feare of the Lorde, &c. It might also bee saide, that the feare of the Lorde is the chiefe parte of : for if in all our doinges wee haue not this feare, we know , we are voide of wisdome and vnderstanding, we are like vnto , rude, folish and blinde beastes. Moses doeth shew it vs, when  oueth the people of Israel which were without feare, saying vn∣, They haue corrupted themselues, &c. The worde also which Deut, 32. 5.  vseth, doth signifie beginning, and principall part. This feare  both with the loue of God, and of his worde, as Moses doeth  vs in that place which we alledged euen now: likewise in the 29.  the 6. the holy Scripture doth often allure vs to this feare, to Deut. 10. 12. & 29. & 6.  that learning to beholde our frailtie and weaknesse, we might  ourselues, and leane more strongly to the onely mercy of God,  submitting ourselues vnto him, with humilitie and earnest de∣ holy to obey him. Such maner of feare leadeth vs to repentance,  doth so astonish vs, that we feele howe God is angry with vs for  sinnes: and albeit this feare doeth beate vs downe in ourselues, yet doeth it make vs certaine and assured that God is mercifull vnto vs. This is the feare which Solomon doeth heere teach vs, as we may Psal. 51. 19. Esai. 66 2. vnderstand by the word knowledge: for we haue no true knowledge, vnlesse we knowe God: and wee knowe him not, vnlesse we doe loue him, and be assured of his goodnesse towardes vs. This is not then that feare whereof S. Iohn speaketh, There is no feare in loue, but perfecte 1. Ioh. 4. 18. loue casteth out feare. &c. Wherefore the Papists haue here no foun∣dation of their doctrine, or rather of their false opinion, whereby they labor to cause vs to be stil in doubt, whether God doth loue vs or not. &c. For if we feare God, we know him: if we know him, we loue him: & if we loue him, we are sure he loueth vs: for we can not loue him 1. Ioh. 4. 1. first. Herein is loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs. &c. If we know God truly to be such, though there were no hel, we would feare more to offend him, than to suffer any kinde of death. But fooles haue despised wisdom. He maketh here an Antithesis, cōparing foolish∣nes with knowledge: & the disdaine of wisdom & instructiō, with the feare of the Lorde, of whome we receiue all wisedome and instructi∣on: wherein he teacheth vs who are those fooles of whome he spea∣keth: that is to say, those that are naked & voide of the feare of God, wherein they are holden by wisedome and instruction, without the which feare they are corrupted and giuen vp to all wickednesse, in
forsakyng GOD whose wisedome and instruction they despise. As it is sayde of the children of Israel: They haue corrupted them¦selues Ps. 14. 1. towardes him, by their vice. &c. And as Dauid saieth, The foole hath saide in his heart, there is no God, they haue corrupted and done an abhominable worke. Here we heare that the wisest of the worlde are reproued of foolishnesse, and that rightly: for they trusting and bo∣sting in their wittes and vnderstanding, in their reason and fancie, no esteeming heauenly wisdome, neither holy instructions, whereby they should know God, and be kept in his feare, do giue themselues to hu∣maine sciences, some to occupations, other some to marchandize, and some topollitike gouernment: the which thinges albeit they are good, because they proceede from God, yet thorowe the folly and malice of men which regarde not to knowe God, but onely their owne glorie or profit, are so polluted and corrupted, that they are filthy and abhomi∣nable before God. And therefore he threatneth by his Prophets to de∣stroy the workes of such thinges. Furthermore, Solomon doth shew Esa. 3. 2 & 29. 14. vs that these fooles well deserue grieuous punishment, seeing they are accustomed to this contempt, and giuen vp thereto, the which he sig∣fieth when he vseth the Pretertēce of a verbe, saying: they haue despi∣sed. Also we may learne that God is long suffering, when he punisheth Ro. 2. 4. not the fooles immediately: but if they do not returne vnto him by re∣pentaunce, his long tarrying will be surely recompenced. Despisest thou the riches of his bountifulnesse, and patience, and long suffe∣raunce. &c. 8. My Sonne, heare thy Fathers instruction, and forsake not thy Mothers teaching. 9 For they shalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke. Albeit we haue neuer so good doctrine taught vs, and that we be aduertised of the vices that are dayly committed in the contempte thereof, yet are we not once moued to folow good doctrine, neyther do we mind so much as once to withdraw vs from such vices, though they direct the word of God to our person, and that by admonitions, & exhortations, by promises, forbiddings & threatnings they allure vs to do wel, & labour to withdraw vs from euil. Therfore Solomon desi∣ring to moue vs to goodnes, & to turne vs from euil, after the doctrine
and aduertisemēt of the despising of fooles, directeth to vs his words, exhorting, promising, forbidding & threatening. The exhortation is, My sonne, heare. &c. In this exhortation, to the ende hee would bee heard with more reuerence and feare, he speaketh as the father to his childe. Heere we may say that Solomon speaketh in the person of God, who is the onely father of al; or in the person of the Pastor & teacher Mat. 25. of the Church, who calleth those his children which hee instructeth & teacheth, because he begetteth thē to God, & to his Church through the worde. Dauid vseth this maner of speaking likewise doeth S. Paule and S. Iohn. Therein they attribute nothing to themselues, neither by any meanes doe derogate from the fatherhoode of God: for it hath pleased God to make them partakers of this honour, when hee doeth vse them as instruments to encrease his Church, and to beget him spi∣rituall children. Wherefore, Solomon doth moue vs to obey God, who only is our father & instructer, as it hath bene alreadie treated of in the 2. verse. And when he calleth vs to heare, he requireth also obe∣dience, which we must yeelde, if we wil bee accepted of God for wise: otherwise we enter into destruction with the foolishe. For the worde which Solomon vseth, doth not onely signifie to heare, but also to obey Mat. 7. and follow. It behoueth vs then not only to giue our outward hearing to this instruction, but also our heartes, that we vnderstanding howe healthfull it is for vs, may followe it with true and continuall repen∣cance, detesting euil, & louing good with all our desire. And forsake not. When Solomon addeth this, he giueth vs well to vnderstand that he doth not onely allure vs to heare, but to obey. And therewith im∣mediately hee answereth to a question which might bee made: to wit, How shall we heare God, seeing he is an inuisible & incomprehensible spirite? He giueth (I say) the solution, admonishing vs not to forsake the teaching of our mother. As if he did say, if you will heare God to instruct you, be obedient to the Church, wherein hee doeth beget you, and teach you by the ministerie of his Apostles and Prophets, of his Euangelistes, Pastours and Doctours. Furthermore, wee must vn∣derstande, that God calleth al them his children, which hee exhorteth by his worde, and giueth them to his spouse, which is the Church, to be taught: for the Church is the piller and strength of trueth: not the popish Church, which doth reiect the word of God, and not acknow∣ledge Iesus Christ for head, but Antichrist and the enimie of God. But forasmuche as wee ourselues cannot discerne the Church of the wic∣ked
from that of the faithfull, we must aske of our heauenly Father, the spirite of wisedome and discretion, and vndoubtedly, he wil giue it vs. For they shalbe. After the exhortation, he putteth the promise, by Mat. 7. 9. a figure and similitude: as if he did say, like as the worldlings delight to beholde a person decked and trimmed with gorgeous attires, and precious iewels hanged about the head and the necke, which are the parts most seene, because they are most apparant; and the person so dec∣ked is not ashamed to be seene, but desireth to bee seene: euen so, my sonne, if thou be truely decked with the feare of the Lorde, and with his knowledge, and doest willingly receiue his instruction, and that thou desirest gladly to be taught in the congregation of the faithful, thou shalt be acceptable and pleasant before God, and his Angels, be∣fore his elected and faithfull, and thou shalt not need to doubt to pre∣sent thy selfe before him and his, neither needest to feare to be refused of him, no more than the wel beloued, pleasing and acceptable Wyfe is refused of her husbande, but shalt be assured to obtaine of him ioye and prosperitie, and all felicities in the life euerlasting: for he which promiseth, is true. Wherein we haue first to note, that albeit Solomon doeth here vse a similitude taken of the manners of the worldlings, yet his meaning is not, that it is lawful for vs outwardly to deck ourselues with sumptuous and precious things, wherewith to please men: but contrarily we must folow the doctrine of the Apostles. For as our Sa∣uiour 1. Tim. 2. 1. Pet. 3. Luk. 18. 2. compareth God vnto a wicked iudge, and yet it is not lawful to say nor think that God is wicked: euen so if Solomon compare the spi∣rituall giftes vnto worldly ornaments; it is not to say, that it should be lawful for vs to folow the custom of the world in outward ornaments. True it is, that the wearing of golde and precious stones, and other or∣naments is not altogether and vtterly forbidden, seeing that it is indif∣ferent: but it is not forbidden, in so much as all they which deck them¦selues sumptuously, are almost all ledde with too much desire to bee seene: and are commonly giuen to superfluitie & excesse, to vnshame∣fastnesse and immoderatenesse, to ambition and pride. And forasmuch as women are most spotted with this desire to be seene in gorgeous ap∣parel, S. Paul and S. Peter direct their wordes to them. Secondly, be∣cause that God commaunding father and mother to be honoured, ad∣ding thereto a promise, thou shalt liue long vpon the earth: some, be∣cause that this promise, for they shalbe, &c. is placed immediatly after the exhortatiō to heare instruction, would haue the said exhortatiō ta∣ken
more simply: to wit for the commaundement to obey vnto carnal fathers, vnto whose charge the gouernment of their children is com∣mitted, and that the children learne to be obedient to their parents, & should not thinke that they are able to rule themselues. There are two reasons that cause me to dissent from this opinion. The first is, that in this same preface, the 6. chapter, he giueth commaundement to obey father and mother: the second is, that after he hath admonished and aduertised vs of the feare of the Lord, & of his knowledge, by this exhortation, he sheweth to vs by what meanes we may attaine there∣to, and be kept therein: to wit, by hearing and obeying. 10 My Sonne, if sinners do intice thee, consent thou not. 11 If they say, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cause: 12 VVe wil swallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as those that go downe to the pit: 13 ƲƲe shal finde all precious riches, and fil our houses with spoyle: 14 Cast in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purse. 15 My sonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path. 16 For their feete runne to euill, and make haste to shedde blood. 17 Certainely as without cause the net is spread before the eyes of all that hath wyng: 18 So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues. 19 Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof. After the promise, for our better aduice, and to shew vs how we should not despise wisdom and instruction, he giueth vs a prohibition, wherin he sheweth a great fatherly care, saying: My son, if sinners &c. Albeit that of our vitious and corrupted nature through the sin of A∣dam, we al are sinners: yet God of his grace & mercy doth not impute to his elected and faithfull (which are his children) their sinnes: and therefore the scripture doeth not call them sinners, but holy and Rom. 1. & 1. Ephe. 4. 1. Pe. 4. righteous. Those are sinners of whome it is spoken, Such were they which perished by the floude, as may be seene in Genesis, and so
were they of Sodome. Our Sauiour meaneth both the one and the o∣ther, Gene. 13. saying, they did eate and drinke. &c. Solomon would not haue vs to consent to the perswasions of such kind of men, wherby they la∣bour Luke. 17. 27. to drawe vs to do as they do, and to make vs their like and com∣panions. It is not then without cause why he giueth vs such a prohi∣bition: as we shall see hereafter, and may also see the same. 2. Pet. 2. 11 If they say. He beginneth to discouer their perswasiōs together with their wicked and pernicious doing: and herein he sheweth what these sinners are, to whō he would not haue vs to consent. The begin∣ning of their perswasiōs is, that is to say, Come with vs. As if they said, we are the greater number, wherevpon it is to be thought that we are both the strongest and the wisest: if thou wilt then be well accompa∣nied, forsake the other (which are but as an handfull in comparision of vs) and ioyne with vs. This same is a great temptation, whereby the vnsted fast are easily shaken. Wherfore we haue great neede to beware of such temptation: for naturally wee desire to followe the greatest number, and thinke that if wee be on that side, we cannot perish. But the holy Ghost teacheth vs the contrarie both by examples and ad∣monitions. Noe was not drowned by the waters of the floud: Lot perished not in the ouerthrowe of Sodome: Iosua and Caleb died not in the desert. It is also written, Thou shalt not followe a multitude to Exod. 23. 2. Mat. 7. 13. euill. Againe, Enter in at the straight gate: for it is the wide gate and broad way that leadeth to destruction: and many there be that go in thereat. The multitude is one of the arguments which the Papistes lay against vs, to shew that we are in the way of perdition: but if the multitude be the best, it followeth that the Turkes and Panims are ho∣nester than the Papists: for they are the greater number. Albeit then that the Papists be more than we in number, and that we are but a lit∣tle handfull, let not that moue vs to follow them. For if we should re∣gard to rule our life after the multitude, we should followe the Infidels and Idolaters. For as we are but a fewe in comparison of the Papists, so they are nothing in comparison of the Turkes and other Heathen. Nowe to go forth with the words of Solomon, we must note, (when he saith the sinners do say) VVe will lay waite &c. Hee more ex∣presseth the deliberation of their hearts and desires, and likewise their wicked and peruerse maner of doing, than their owne wordes: for there is none so wicked but thinketh, and counteth himselfe to be an honest man. And none will beast himselfe to be a murderer and shed∣der
of innocent blood, to get himselfe companions, but rather woulde sweare for himselfe to be their protector and defender. But it may bee demanded, wherfore they say, We wil lay wayte. It is for that they are led with great desire to be riche, to be chiefe and to beare rule: and to obteine the same, they doe outrage and violence to the innocent, that is to say, to those which haue not deserued of them to bee so euill in∣treated: and yet they woulde, and also be esteemed to doe well, and that they pursue nothing but their right, or at the least that they are not bounde to doe better: and also to hide their crueltie, they will lay false crimes vnto their charge, whom wrongfully and without cause they pursue. Nowe they which are familiarly conuersant with them, and are giuen to their particular profite, are easily drawne to exercise suche inhumanitie and crueltie, the which is reputed before God for mur∣der and mansslaughter: because it is no thank to them that they shed not innocent blood. Solomon doth wel signifie the same, when he saith, in their persons, VVe will lay waite, &c. This crueltie is exercised in euery estate, when they seeke to profite themselues with the hurt of other men. And it is not onely vsed ouer our temporall goodes, and bodies: but more wic∣kedly Esai. 1. 59. 1. Ioh. 3. the belly gods buie and sell mens soules and leade them to the slaughter. 12 VVe will swallowe them vp. He continueth heere to ex∣presse the vnsatiable greedinesse & cruel deliberation of sinners, wher∣by they purpose in no wise to spare the innocent, but vterly to destroy them, and roote out their memory from among the liuing: to the end that without let and resistance they might accomplishe their desires. This same affection of the wicked was well described by Dauid. Psal. 10. 13. 13 VVe shall finde all precious riches. Here Solomon setteth forth the great desire of sinners to be rich, to be aloft, and to liue in wealth and abundance, and to rule: for hauing great riches, they will be estee∣med, credited, and will oppresse all men: otherwise they would think they should not long possesse their great substance and praye, nor con∣tinue in good reputation. 14 Cast in thy lot among vs. They desire to haue many to do as they do, & delight to haue many like vnto thēselues: iudging that there∣by they shal not be rebuked nor reproued for their inhumanitie and crueltie, but that rather they shall be loued and honoured, and be had in good estimation: and that by such diuelish vnitie and conformitie
the goodes which they haue violently gotten, and possesse vniustly, shall be safe, and that they quietly shall enioy them. These desires and iudgementes are expressed vnto vs by these words, Cast thy lotte &c. It is not the common vse of sinners thus to speak one to another: for their custome is, to lay euery man for his owne profit, not passing for their fellowes: yea, they are of such nature, that euery of them would haue all to himselfe, and the other to haue nothing but at their gentlenes. The purse then of sinners is said to be one: not that they be vnited in true loue, as are the faithfull, as it is spoken of in the Actes: Act. 2. 44. But bicause they pretend all one wickednesse, and are all led of one e∣uill spirite to do wrong and violence to those who neuer deserued it at their handes, so that their vnitie tendeth to no other end but to be more strong. 15 My Sonne walke not in the way with them. The waies and pathes of sinners are their euill thoughtes and cogitations, their inor∣dinate affections and lusts, their wicked manners and peruerse doings, their in humanitie and crueltie: to be short, al the meanes they do ima∣gine and follow to do hurt. The wise man here warneth the children of God to cast away from them al such wickednes, & to flee them. And so, albeit the tares must be left among the wheate, notwithstanding the wheate must not become tares▪ for although that the children of God be in this world mingled among the wicked, and cannot seperat themselues from them, vnlesse they should go forth of the world (as S Paule saieth) yet must they not communicate with them in euil, least they be 1. Cor. 5. 10. also wrapped vp in their perdition. 16 For their feete runne to euill. He giueth vs a reason where∣fore we must not consent vnto sinners, neyther walke in the way with them: for their way is a bloody way. They desire nothing more than the destruction and perdition of the innocent, that they might gaine something, whereof they are so desirous and couetous, that they imploy thereto al their force and might, al their credit and autho∣ritie, euen not letting to put their neighbours to death, if they thinke they cannot otherwise bring their purpose to passe: the execution whereof Solomon compareth to a speedie course: for to shewe how sinners thinke they shall neuer come timely enough to possesse that which they would haue. Solomon vseth in his speach ij. verbes, which signifie the time to come, although they be vsed both for the present time, and also to signifie what is accustomed to be done. And so he
signifieth that they are so giuen to wickednesse, that they list not to forbeare it. Albeit that at the first shew this reason seemeth to touche them which desire to haue warre, not caring whether it be iust or vniust, but is enough for them that they enrich them∣selues with the booties and spoiles taken from the dead in battel: this same neuerthelesse ought not to be restrained to the corporal shedding of blood, but also to euery violence, wrong, and crueltie, which is exercised as well vpon the goodes and bodies, as vppon the soules of men. Wherefore therein wee will comprehende al robbers and theeues, vsurers and couetous persons, sellers of false wares, murtherers and persecutors of innocentes, and chiefly of the faithful, Hypocrites, Idolaters and superstitious, false Pro∣phetes and lying Doctours. 17 Certainely as without cause. Of the aforesaide deli∣berations of sinners, Solomon hath gathered a reason wherefore no man ought to consent vnto them, neither walke with them, &c. for their feete runne. &c. And to the end he might the better turn away the children of God frō running after thē, he sheweth howe the sinners do great wrong, when he likeneth those whom they persecute, to birdes. As if he saide, for asmuche as you are Gods children, who is iust and righteous, gentle and merciful: you shoulde wishe to doe wrong to no man, neither vse your neigh∣bours crueltie, and chiefly the innocent. Wherefore you ought not to walke with the sinners which persecute the innocent: for as the birdes haue not deserued of the fouler too bee taken with nettes, and to be eaten: euen so the innocents haue not deserued to bee pilled, tormented and murdered: yet are they a pray vnto the wicked and vngodly. By this similitude Solomon declareth plainely enough, that he reproueth not Iudges and Magistrates which diligently search out the wicked, and are carefull to punish them greeuously, that they might (as muche as in them lyeth) Rom. 13. 4. purge the worlde of them. For as they beare the swoorde to take vengeance on him that doeth euill: so the wicked resemble not vnto birdes, but vnto wilde and cruell beastes, and therefore they deserue to bee watched, to be taken, & to haue their blood shed. As touching the rest, forasmuche as God saith vnto Noe & to his children, Euery thing that moueth and liueth, shalbe meate for Gen. 9. 3.
you, &c. We ought to vnderstande that it is lawful for vs to vse birdes to take them, to kil them, and to make them serue to our vse, although they haue not deserued it. They are created for vs, as al other creatures are: therefore we may vse them with thankes giuing, &c. Wee shall follow this doctrine, if in our meates we be sober and temperate, and that wee vse them for necessitie sake, & 1. Tim. 1. 3. not to fil our bellies like beastes, without acknowledging the Lord who giueth them. And yet we must thinke that if God hath giuen ouer birdes for a pray which haue not offended him, that wee which are rebels to him, doe much more deserue to be giuen ouer to the will of the wicked, and vngodly. For albeit wee are innocent in respect of them, and that they doe wickedly in persecuting vs, not hauing so deserued of them: neuerthelesse before the iudge∣ment of God wee are not innocent. And therefore if he deliuer vs to the wil of sinners, we haue no cause to complain of him, but must confesse that iustly he doth punishe vs, and that the wicked onely are his instruments to execute the same. 19 Such are the wayes. The worlde doeth greatly allowe those which can profite themselues, & gather much goods. Con∣trarily, those which are not cunning to gaine something, are dis∣dained, & reputed Idiots, the which is a great temptation vnto the simple and vndiscrete, to leade them to couetousnesse, that they might be reputed and esteemed among men: not considering in the meane while, into what gulfe of wickednesse they doe fall, if greedily they follow gaine. From the which gulfe, Solomon being desirous to withdrawe vs, and to make vs detest, and ab∣horre the great toyle of greedinesse to followe gaine, declareth heere vnto vs, that the couetous haue the deliberations, affe∣ctions, enterprises and executions before mentioned, and that when hee saith, Such are the wayes, &c. As if he did say Forasmch as you woulde not lay wayte for innocent blood, and that the couetous haue suche waies, that they conspire against the liues of them, and that rather than they woulde want of their enterprise, doe take away the life of innocents, and murder those which possesse the goodes that they desire: yee must flee coueto∣usnesse, and choose rather to be poore, than to desire abundance of riches, seeing you would not bee counted murderers before God
and his Angels. I say expresly before God and his Angels: for the most couetous are not esteemed before the worlde for murderers and mansleaers, but men of honesty and good reputation. And al∣so when Solomon saith howe they woulde take away the life of the owners thereof, he meaneth not that alwaies they kill those which possesse the goodes that they woulde haue: but that by sub∣tilties and guile, by wicked bargaining and vnlawful meanes, by force and extortion, they spoile their neighbours and vndo them: and no thanke to them that their neighbours die not, when they take away from them that wherewith their life shoulde be sustei∣ned. For if they cannot come to execute the ende of their desire, they make debates, strifes and dissentions, hatredes, priuie malice, and desire of vengeance: and if they could or durst, they would murder their neighbours indeede. And forasmuch as God is a spi∣rite, and that he hath made a lawe not only to gouerne the out∣warde workes, but also the affections of the heart, as it is shewed in Deut. And now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require Deut. 10. 12. of thee, but to feare the Lorde thy God, and to walke in all his wayes, and to loue, and to serue the Lorde thy GOD with all thine hearte, and with all thy soule? Againe, verse. 16. Circumcise therefore the forskin of your heart, &c. Sith they haue an euil affection against their neighbours, it followeth that Mat. 5. they sinne against the commandement, Thou shalt not kil: as Ie∣sus Christ doth expound it himselfe. And so before God they are murderers, although before the worlde they bee counted men of good reputation, because they handle their matters handsomely: and also good stout men, because they leese nothing that may bee gotten. We learne also in this place, that it is a very dangerous thing, to couet the riches of this world: seeing that they which would be rich, are not much better than murderers: and we knowe that euery murderer hath not euerlasting life abiding in him. To the 1. Iohn. 3. 15. end then that we be no murderers, but that we may obteine euer∣lasting life, let vs rather chose pouertie or meane estate, following that which is saide. Let your conuersation bee without coue∣tousnes Heb. 13. 5. So doing we shal win much, as the Scripture witnesseth. Make you friendes with the riches of iniquitie. But godlinesse Luke. 16. 9.
is great gaine, if a man be content with that he hath. The example of Lazarus serueth also to the proofe heereof. Notwithstanding 1. Tim. 6. 6. hee meaneth not that al rich men are murderers, either that they ought to forsake their riches, if they will be saued. The Patri∣arkes were riche, & are in the kingdom of heauen: they haue not Luke. 16. 17. coueted to be rich, & hauing riches, they did not set their heart vpon them, but did distribute thē where neede was, not putting their trust in them. After whose example they that are riche in this worlde, must not be highminded, neither put their trust in the vncertaintie of riches, but in the liuing God, &c. 20 VVisedome crieth without, she vttereth her voyce in the streetes. 21 She calleth in the high streete among the prease in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, saying: 22 O yee foolishe, howe long will yee loue foolishnesse? and the scornefull take their pleasure in scorning; and the fooles hate knowledge? To the ende that we shoulde heare instruction, and that ther∣by wee might learn not to consent vnto sinners. &c. And that we shoulde not pretende cause of ignorance, if we walke with them in their waies, God from the beginning of the world hath taught vs, doeth teach vs, and wil teach vs, so long as the worlde shal endure. Solomon doeth signifie it by saying, VVisedome crieth without &c. For in his speache he vseth heere the Verbe, which is put not onely to signifie that which is doone presently and in the future time, but also that which is customably vsed to be doone. For wisedome was neuer idle: but as God hath thereby created al thinges, euen so by it doeth hee gouerne, and shall gouerne all thinges. O Lorde howe manifolde are thy Psalm. 104. workes? in wisdome hast thou made them al. The worde of GOD is this wisedome. Who instructed Abell to put his trust in God, and to offer vnto him Sacrifice? Who taught the Gene∣ration Iohn. 1. Heb. 11. 4. Gen. 4. 4. of Seth to call vppon the name of the Lorde their God: but only the wisedome of GOD? Likewise it must bee saide of
al the Patriarkes, Iudges, Kinges and Prophets, that they them∣selues were taught, & also did teach others by this same wisdom. Also by it haue the Apostles and Disciples bene instructed, and haue byn taught. For I wil giue you a mouth & wisdome, where against all your aduersaries shall not bee able to speake nor resiste. Luk. 21. 15. And that we should alwayes be instructed by this wisdome: He himselfe hath made some Apostles, some Prophets, some Euange∣lists, Ephe. 4. 11. some Pastours and Doctours. Let vs note herevpon that the Ministers of Gods Church ought not to be like vnto the Pope, neither to his horned bishops, nor others of their sects: of whom it may be said, al their watchmen are blinde, they know nothing, they are all dumbe dogges. &c. But as the Euangelicall worde is Es. 5. 6. 10. committed vnto them, to be heard through all the worlde of all creatures: euen so must they crye aloud to waken the sluggards, and to make such as woulde be deafe, vnexcusable: they must la∣bour also to profite many, as Solomon doeth well note it, saying, they must crye without in the streates. &c. Likewise our Lorde doeth teache vs verie well, What I tell you in darkenesse, that Mat. 10. 27. speake ye in light: and what ye heare in the eare, that preache yee on the house, In al estates also ought this wisedome to crye, both by wordes of edification, by good counsell, and by holie conuer∣sation. &c. 22 O ye foolish. Wisdom crieth after three kinds of people, which occupie the world: to wit, the folish, the scornful & fooles. The foolish, are such as be vndiscreete, and therefore easily to be deceiued, and also to be taken with that which seemeth fayre to the eyes, and to followe that which seemeth good to the vnder∣standing of the flesh. Looke what such folkes loue, is but foolish∣nesse, although the wisest of the worlde praise it and esteeme it. Also God hath made the wisedome of this world foolishnes. The 1. Cor. 1. 20. scornefull, are such as haue their heart so swelled with pride and presumption, their minde so malicious and wicked, that they can not suffer to be taught any thing, neither to be rebuked nor repre∣hended for their fault: but scorne at all discipline and correction, and in this scornefulnesse take their pleasure and delight: as Solo∣mon doeth signifie the same when he sayeth, The scornefull take
their pleasure in scorning, The Pharisies shewe themselues to Luk. 16. Esai. 28. 2. Pet. 3. be such. There are also such nowe. The fooles are muche like vnto the foolishe: they are also of the manners and fashions of the scorners: for they hate knowledge which is contrary to foolish∣nesse and scorning: for hee that delighteth in the knowledge of God and his worde, which is the true knowledge, setteth nought by that which pleaseth the flesh, and suffereth to bee taught more and more, and receiueth with humblenes al discipline and correc∣tion, to mortifie thereby the fleshe: which the fooles doe not, but hate that wherewith the fleshe is not delighted, and doe persecute those both by word and deed, which labour to instruct them. Such was S. Paule before his conuersion. Such are Idolaters, of whome the worlde is full: for among tenne millions, scarce may one bee founde which is not either foolish, either scorning, either a foole, or which hath them not altogether. The Ministers then of the worde wil chalendge nothing to themselues; but knowing it is God which worketh by his wisedome, wil doe their Ministerie in feare and trembling, without promising any thing of themselues: and wil confesse the great & inestimable goodnesse of God, which he hath vsed and doeth vse towardes the world, when he disdai∣ned not, neither yet doeth disdaine to abase himselfe so low, as to warne the foolish, scornful and fooles by his wisedome: the which notwithstanding is in such wise outraged, that it is thought foo∣lishnesse. For, Saint Paule sayeth, The preaching of the Crosse is to them which doe perishe, foolishnesse. 1. Cor. 1. 8. 23 Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderstande my wordes. When wisedome crieth after the foolish, scorneful, and fooles, shee first accuseth, reprooueth, and correcteth them, without con∣demning them, and making them dispaire: for shee rather labou∣reth to cause them to amend by repentance and fayth. Shee saith not, because ye loue foolishnesse, scornefulnesse and folly, you are vndone, ye are lost for euer: but shee sweetely entreateth them, saying: Turne you, &c. As if shee did say, when I reprooue and orrecte you, when I shewe you your foolishnesse, scorneful∣nesse
and hatred against the true knowledge, harden not your heartes at my correction, but suffer yourselues to be taught of it, forsaking your wicked way, and your vnrighteous thoughtes, through which you haue bene turned from the Lord: and come a∣gaine to seeke the Lord, while he may bee founde: and call vppon him while he is nigh: the which you shal doe, if you hate that which you loue and would haue, and if you loue and desire that which you hate. Nowe to the ende that your heart may thus re∣turne at my correction, I wil poure out my spirit as it were a spring Esai. 11. 2. Ioh. 14. 16. vpon you, which is the spirit of Wisdome, &c. Who is the com∣forter, The Spirite of trueth, which instructeth al thinges, and lea∣deth into al truth. By it wil I make you vnderstād, that that which I commaund, is righteous; that I chide not rashly and without ad∣uisement; that I threaten not wrongfully: and by himselfe wil I witnesse to you of the certaintie and trueth of my promises. Now Solomon sheweth wel here, that he is not onely a teacher of the lawe, but also of the Gospel: for he is not contented to reprooue vices, to commaunde and to forbid, which is the office of the lawe: but (as our Lorde sayeth) with repentaunce hath added sayth, Repent and beleeue the Gospell: and hath commaunded Mar. 1. 15. Luk. 24. 47. his Apostles to doe the like. Euen so Solomon with repentaunce ioyneth fayth, when hee promiseth the holie Ghost and the vn∣derstanding of the wordes of God, which are the infallible trueth. For fayth is a certaine knowledge and assurance that God loueth vs, that he is our Father, and our Sauiour through Christe, as the holie Ghost witnesseth vnto the faythful by the preaching of the Gospel, which he printeth in their heartes, sanctifiyng and rege∣nerating them. As touching the rest, when wee are corrected to conuert, there is nothing offered which pleaseth the fleshe, the sensuall man nor olde Adam, for it is high and proude, and can abide no correction. The whole worlde is naturally infected and corrupted with suche vices, as pride and impatience: and therfore it is no maruell though there be so many incorrigible people: vnto whom wee must not bee like. For neither the corrupted nature of our fleshe and sensualitie, nor yet the multitude shall excuse vs, and deliuer vs from perdition, if wee followyng them,
conuert not when we are corrected in the name of God, and by the doctrine of the holy scripture, the which is giuen by inspirati∣on of God, and is profitable to teach, to improoue, to correct. &c. Furthermore (when calling vs to repentance, God promiseth vs 2. Tim. 3. 16. his holie spirite) wee must vnderstande that repentaunce is not a worke of man, but of God, who regenerateth vs, and renueth vs by his holie spirite: as appeareth by the witnesse of Ezechiel. A newe heart also wil I giue you, and a newe spirit wil I put within you. &c: and consequētly, it is not of our free wil that we repent, Eze. 36. 26. but of the onely mercy of God, which wil not the death of a sin∣ner. The which also Ieremie confesseth, saying, O Lord, I know Eze. 33. Ier. 10. 23. Ier. 31. 18. that the way of man is not in himselfe: and therefore he prayeth on this wise, Conuert thou me, and I shalbee conuerted. Moreo∣uer we learne here that the wordes of God are hidden from vs, if the holy Ghost be not giuen vs to instruct & sanctifie vs. We must then pray with Dauid, Create in me a cleane heart, O God, and Psal. 51. 12. renue a right spirite within me. Finally sith that in bidding vs re∣pent, God promiseth vs the knowledge of his wordes, wee may perceiue who are the true repentants, and who not: and likewise that they which make no accompt to repent, vnderstand not the wordes of God, though they say what they list. 24 Because I haue called, & ye refused: I haue stretched out mine hand, and none would regard: 25 But ye haue despised all my counsel, and would none of my correction: 26 I wil also laugh at your destruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth. 27 VVhen your feare commeth lyke suddaine desolation, and your destruction shal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguish shal come vpon you: 28 Then shall they call vppon mee, but I will not answere: they shall seeke mee early, but they shall not finde mee. After Wisdom hath willed the foolish, the scorners & fooles to repent, & beholding the greatest part, yea almost al vncorrigible &
obstinate & hardned more & more, shee maketh cōplaint against thē & threateneth thē. Shee complaineth of that that by her ser∣uantes the Patriarkes and Prophetes shee hath cryed and doeth cry vpon the foolish, to haue them returne to repentance, presen∣ting them her spirite, & through the vnderstanding of her words: and that yet they refuse to repent, to receiue the holy Ghost, and to apply their wittes to her wordes. 25. But ye haue despised. In continuing stil her cōplaint, shee sheweth how farre the ministers of the word ought to reach with their cry, & whereto their cry should serue: that is, to coun∣sel and correct, that the world being warned by good counsel and holy sermons of the woorde of God, might amende. But the foo∣lish wil in no wyse tast of his counsell, but somuch as they can, despise it and regarde it not, and wil not haue the hande of God and of his wisedome to bee offred to them by correction and fa∣therly chastisement: but as dul horses winch against the spurre, so doe they despite and murmure against God and his ministers, ha∣ting and persecuting them to kil and destroy them, if it were pos∣sible for them. Now let vs heere first of all note, that wisedomes hand is the hand of God, seeing that hee is neuer without this wisedome, and that they both bee but one. This hand is taken in diuers sorts: to wit, for the power, goodnesse, helpe, fauour, work, acte, punishment, chastisement, vengeance & correction of God. For in asmuch as God is a spirit, wee must vnderstande that hee hath neither armes nor hāds, that can be either touched or seene: but the holy Ghost to accommodate himselfe to our rudenesse, doeth attribute vnto God those things which properly and natu∣rally appertaine vnto vs. This hand doeth stretch it selfe foorth af∣ter diuers manners: to wit, in sustayning and keeping, in guiding and gouerning, in ouerthrowing and destroying, in correcting & chastening. But to exercise this hand, hee hath many instruments the which he setteth on woorke as seemeth good to him. Nowe when this hande is attributed heere to wisedome, with the stret∣ching out thereof, and that the ministers of the woord ought a∣boue all other to vse wisedome, wee wil take the stretched out hand, chiefly for the correction and chastisement which is done in the church by the woorde of God. Solomon also doth giue it wel
to vnderstande, after he hath made his complaint, that none would regard this stretched out hand: he addeth, that they would none of his correction. When wisedom maketh her cōplaint for that they haue despised her counsel, wee must vnderstande, that the coun∣sels of God, are as much as commandementes, and that it is very necessary for vs to obey them: if it were otherwise, wisdom would not make such complaint against the despisers of her counsell. Wherfore, what though that commādement to loue our enimies were a counsell? yet shoulde the opinion of the Papists be false, Mat. 5. 44. whereby they holde that wee are nothing at all bound to obey it, and that it is made for them which bee in the state of perfection. Wherein they fayle twoo manner of wayes. First, in that they do not giue so much honour to GOD as they giue vnto an earth∣ly Prince, of whome it is commonly saide that his prayer is as much as a commandement: Then, that they place the most wic∣ked in the state of perfection, the which can not bee in this worlde. But if wee wil not haue wisedome to complaine of vs, wee must consider the goodnesse of God, which doth not punish our malice so soone, as wee deserue it, but of his only mercy hee calleth vs by his worde both outwardly and inwardly, and doeth so continue, albeeit we regarde it not: he stretched out his hande to correct and to chasten like a good father, for to withdrawe vs from the gallowes, from death and damnation, and yet we wil not knowe it. This beeing thus considered, we must aske of God: that it may please him not to ceasse to counsel vs by his wisedome, & that wee may drawe neere to profite by that counsell: and that when he correcteth vs, bee it by wordes or by affliction, that wee may receiue al at his hande willingly. And the better to doe the same, we must not be grieued to heare wisedom cry, though it be yrkesome to our flesh. 26 I wil also laugh, After that wisedome hath complained of the hardnesse of the foolish, scorners and fooles, and of their vnre∣pentant hartes, shee threatneth to laugh at them, & mocke them, when the destruction they feare, shal light on their heads. It may wel be thought that the wicked & obstinate feare nothing, bicause they are seene to be most stronge & most in number, & that they very oftē bring their purpose about, & also that they liue at their
case, possessing much temporal riches, for the which they are in re∣putation and esteemed: notwithstanding their euill consciences doe often reproue them: whereby they feele themselues gilty, and are afraide of the iudgement of God. They feare most of al eternal death, which is their last destruction. And therefore there can ne∣uer so little trouble come vpon them in this worlde, but that they are greatly adread and afraide. It is the destruction and feare, whereat wisdome will laugh and mocke. But for so much as de∣rision and mockage are the deedes of dissolute and riotous per∣sons, heere might be asked whether it be a fit and meete thing for the wisedome of God to deride and mock, and whether it be law∣ful for to attribute vnto him any such things. Answere, that wis∣dome doth not laugh and mocke after the manner of men, neither is it lawful for vs to attribute vnto him such derision and mocke∣ry: for it were to make him like vnto the most wicked ympes of the worlde: but the holy Scripture accommodating it selfe to our rudenesse, and willing to expresse what wisdom shalbe and seeme vnto the vnderstanding and opinion of the hard hearted & obsti∣nate, doth attribute vnto her mockery and derision. 27 When your feare. The derision then and mockery of God and his wisdom, is to feare & sodainly to abash the wicked when they looke not for it, to ouerthrow and destroy them in her anger and wrath, without hauing any pitie of them, for all their wee∣pings and cryings, and for all their diligence to seeke remedie. The like mockery is expressed in the 2. Psal. Where the Prophete shewing howe God can confute the pride and vaine enterprises of men rising vp against him and his Christ, saith: But hee that dwelleth in the Heauen shall laugh: the Lorde shal haue them in derision. And we must not thinke that the Psalmist and the wise man onely threaten the wicked of their time which sub∣mitted not themselues vnder the yoke of God by repentance: But as the promises of saluation appertaine to al faithful, in what time soeuer they bee: euen so the threatenings are made for the wicked of all ages vnto the ende. Saint Paule doeth well shewe Rom. 2. 5. it saying. But thou after thine hardenesse, and heart that can∣not repent, heapest vnto thy selfe wrath against the day of wrath, &c. Let vs then returne to repentance, that we be not ouertaken,
and when wee shall say, peace and safety, then sodaine death come vpon vs. If wee thus doe, God wil not deride nor mocke vs, in fea∣ring 1. Thes. 5. 3. and destroying vs: for feare and destruction appertaine not vnto vs, they properly belong vnto the fooles and mockers, to the obstinate and hardened: as Solomon doeth shewe them, when hee saith to them, your destruction, your feare. And that there is no remedy left for the obstinate and reprobate, which refuse the wisedome of God, who is the only remedy, Solomon sheweth it, when he compareth their feare vnto desolation, and their destruc∣tion vnto a whirlewinde. In desolation all is wasted and destroy∣ed, and the whirlewinde consumeth and killeth that which it meeteth: but this desolation and whirlewind doth not destroy & kill the obstinate, so that afterwards they become stones & blocks, or like brute beastes, when they are killed. For being once smitten and beaten downe, they shalbe afflicted foreuer: so desolatiō and storme wil neuer forsake them, as Solomon doeth well signifie it, saying: When affliction and anguish shal come vppon you. Then shal they cal vpon me. If they bee not heard, they cannot bee de∣liuered. This euerlasting anguishe is shewed vs, when our Lorde Mark. 9. 44. sayth, that in the hell fire their worme dieth not, and the fyre ne∣uer goeth out. For we haue sayd expresly, that eternal death is the last destruction, to declare that the obstinate people are not ex∣empted from destruction in this present life, but whiles they be in it, they begin their hell and damnation, and that euen heere they are forsaken of God, as hee doeth make them to feele. Caine, Saul Gen. 4. 1. Sam. 28. Mat. 27. and Iudas haue witnessed the same. Solomon doeth also wel shew it when he saith, That they shal cal, &c. 28 By calling and earely seeking. He sheweth they are in great care and griefe, for the euil they feele and feare to come vpon them. By not to answering, nor to be found, hee declareth howe God regardeth them not, and hath cast them vp for euer. It may bee sayde, that if God doeth aunswere the wicked after their de∣ceasse, that by a far stronger reason hee wil aunswere them in this Luke. 19. Luke. 16. 25. Mat. 25. 41. life, God doeth aunsweare by Abraham, the riche man lying in hell. Our Lorde also doeth aunswere the goates. Aunswere, that after the minde of Solomon these heere haue not receyued aunswere: for they haue an hard and sharpe aunswere, such as a
man woulde make to his enimie, resisting him to the face, as it is sayde, and putting him besides his intent and enterprise, euen such as the Iudge maketh to the theefe when hee pronounceth his sentence, sending him to the gallowes. But Solomon speaketh heere of a softe and fauourable aunswere: such as a man doeth make vnto his friend, graunting him that which hee asketh. Hee sayth that God denieth such aunswere to the fooles and scorners which are obstinate and hardened, and hydeth himselfe from thē, and wil in no wise helpe them: the which Solomon doth signifie by saying, they shal not finde mee. But it may bee sayde agayne, that Solomon seemeth not heere to speake with the same spirite that Dauid his father did, Call vppon mee in the time of trouble: Psal. 50. 15. so wil I deliuer thee, &c. Aunswere, that Dauid doeth speake of those sinners, which are not hardened in their wickednesse, but with al their hart doe truely turne, and seeke the Lorde. Such per∣sons Deut. 4. 29. Psal. 145. 18 Ezec. 33. 16. are promised to bee hearde. But Solomon speaketh of them which make no account to repent, and harden their heartes more and more against all holy admonitions and corrections. Such persons are not hearde, neither feele God to fauour them: for they cal not vppon him, neither seeke him for the loue they beare him, nor for the hatred and vnpleasantnesse that they haue of their sinne, but bycause they are afraide of Gods iudgement, and that they feele their destruction. Heere wil bee asked, how such fooles and scorners call and seeke God, seeing they neither loue him, nor put their trust in him. Aunswere, howe Solomon speaketh heere, either after the estimation and opinion of the fooles and scorners, or according as they woulde appeare to doe: for to say the truthe, they neuer cal vpon God, neither seeke him, nor cannot, bycause they haue refused al his counsel and correcti∣on, they knowe him not. How shal they cal vpon him in whome they haue not beleeued? Also, to cal wel vpon God & seeke him, Rom. 10. 14. Luke. 18. 10 1. Thes. 5. 17 Esa. 55. 6. wee must not ceasse nor bee weary. Seeke the Lorde whyle hee may bee founde, call vppon him whyle hee is nye. For as wee are alwayes in necessitie, so haue wee alwayes neede to pray vnto GOD, to helpe vs with his grace and mercy. For this ause also our Lorde Iesus Christ hath a perpetual Priesthood. Heb. 7. 2.
The fooles and scorners, obstinate and indurate feele not their ne∣cessitie, vnlesse they be sore pressed with feare, and be in great af∣fliction and anguish: they thinke they haue no need of God, but when they loke to perish. And therfore til they thinke to bee de∣stroyed, they neither cal vpon God, nor seeke him: as Solomon doth wel shew it, saying, Then shal they cal vpon me, &c. They would not cry, vnlesse they were constrained by intollerable euils, & chiefly for feare of Gods sharp iudgement, and of eternal death and damnation. If then we would haue God to aunswere vs, let vs not tarry til we can no longer, but let vs turne vnto him with al our hart, and he wil receiue vs to mercy. 29 Bycause they hated knowledge, and did not choose the feare of the Lorde. 30 They would none of my counsel, but despised all my correction. 31 Therfore shal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuises. By the complaint that wisedome hath heretofore made of the idiots, scorners and fooles, she hath shewed that there was suffi∣cient cause to threaten them sharply with the iudgement of God. Notwithstanding as though they had not vnderstand this com∣plaint, and as though they alledge that wrongfully and without cause they are threatned, after this sorte, wisedome repeateth her complaint, shewing them that they haue well deserued so to bee threatned, and also to be forsaken of God. She saith then, Bycause they hated knowledge, &c. It is the wont of Idiots, scorners, and fooles, so to despise the preaching made to them in the name of God, that they seeme not to vnderstād them, as though they were not spoken vnto: and therfore when for their contempt they are threatned with the iudgement and vengeance of God, they mag∣nify themselues, saying they are honest men, although they bee starke naught: and persuade themselues to bee threatned very wrongfully, and as though they had not heard wherein they haue failed & do faile, they aske wherfore they are so threatned. Wher∣fore, to make them more vnexcusable, their faults are told them
againe, but as it is saide, they are therefore more vnexcusable. For that they aske the cause why they are threatened, is not for to en∣deuor for to amende their life: but rather that they may iustify themselues, and giue to vnderstande that they shoulde not be tou∣ched. Besides this wee must note, that repetitions are vsed in the holy scripture, the which albeeit they are esteemed su∣perfluous and vayne, and bee troublesome, yet are they profi∣table, yea necessary, bycause of our rudenesse and flownesse, the better to inculcate and make that which hath already beene tolde vs to enter into our vnderstandings, or that wee may not pre∣tende cause of ignorance, if wee despise what hath bene taught vs. And among repetitions, those are most profitable, which serue for exposition of that which hath beene afore sayde: as is this same, whereby wisedome sheweth whereto she tendeth with her cry: to wit, that men shoulde not dwel in ignorance, neither bee without vnderstanding, lyke brute beastes: but keepe knowledge and vnderstanding in the law & doctrine of the Lorde, whereby they are kept in the seruice and obedience of God in all humble∣nesse and reuerence, following true religion. Wherein she labou∣reth in vaine towardes the Idiots, scorners and fooles, which are obstinate and indurate: for somuch it wanteth that they wil pro∣fite thereby, that not only they refuse the knowledge and feare of the Lord, but, which worse is, they hate it, and persecute it, as it is declared in this repetition. But if wee would not haue such complaint repeated against vs, wee must by and by after wee are once shewed our faultes in the name of GOD, and by his worde, obey admonitions and warning, louing to be instructed, that wee might knowe howe to walke in the feare of the Lorde. As touching the rest, sermons are not onely made for them which heare very well, and are easie to bee taught, but also for the deafe, and them which would seeme not to vnderstande what is tolde them. We must iudge that such people haue great neede to haue one thing often told them, otherwyse we might thinke that in the wrytings of Moses, of Dauid, of the Prophetes, Apostles, and Euangelistes, there are many vaine and superfluous things: for they doe greatly vse repetitions, and say one thing in di∣uers woordes. And also, although we thinke we haue no need of
repetitions, and that wee ought not to vse them, yet if wee marke them when they are directed vnto the indurate and obsti∣nate, they wil greatly edifie vs. For, first of all wee vnderstande, that if God hath such care to reduce the obstinate into the right way: by a more strong reason hee wil not suffer those which are easy to bee taught, to forsake the right path: but wil haue care to lighten them by his worde, that they continually might follow it, not declyning on the right hande, nor on the left. Secondly, wee shal not desire to followe the indurate, seeing them so often re∣prooued, and bee threatened so sharply: but shalbee moued to growe more and more in true knowledge, whereby wee may bee kept stil in the feare of the Lorde. 31 Therefore shall they eate of the fruite of their owne way, &c. As the heauenly wisdom is not contented once to haue complained of the Idiots, scorners and fooles, but hath repeated her complaint: so nowe she maketh againe the lyke threatening as before, but in other woordes. For that which shee hath called feare, she calleth eating: and that which she called destructiō, shee calleth to be filled. Wherein we may see shee speaketh Ironicè, in mocking the scorners, as they deserue so to be. And by so speaking she hath respect to their enterprises and counsels, which were o∣pened vnto vs, when he said (vers. 12. and 13.) we wil swallow them vp. &c. Now mocking their enterprises, she saith, Therefore shal they eate of the fruite, &c. As if she did say, euen as al the labour of man is for his mouth: and that there is no profite to man, but that he eate & drinke, &c. sith these persons haue laboured both Eccles. 6. 7. Eccles. 2. 24. with body and spirit, it is not reason they should lose their paines, but be recompensed for their trauaile, and receiue the reuenue: o∣therwise they shoulde suffer wrong. For it is said, Who goeth on warfare any time at his own cost? Wherefore, as they haue inuen∣ted 1. Cor. 9. 7. mischiefe for the innocent, and taken greate paines to destroy and kil them, not only in body, but also in soule, by offending thē for contemning of my counsel & correction, for hating of know∣ledge, and refusing the feare of God: euen so to recompence them for their labour, I wil cause mischief to light vpon them: that is to say, the frute of their thoughtes. To lay trappes for the innocent, they haue digged and graued pittes: but to drinke their fill, they
shal fal into the ditch they haue made: and that they may haue more than they can desire, and spewe vp againe, their wickednesse shal returne vpon their heads, and their wrong shal fal vpon their owne pate. In this sort the going downe of their meate wil trou∣ble and grieue them, and their filling in tollerable to them: as Solo∣mon doeth likewise declare it, saying: 32 For ease slayeth the foolish, and the prosperity of fooles destroyeth them. 33 But he that obeyeth me, shal dwel safely, and be quiet from feare of euil. As when the gluttons and dronkardes abounde in worldly ri∣ches, they cannot vse them soberly and measurably, to keepe them in health of body, that they may employ their bodies and wits to such workes as bee profitable both for themselues and for their neighbours: but doe vse them excessiuely, eating and drinking without rule & measure: which is cause not only that they sleepe out of time, vomit their meates, and spewe out their wine, and haue no care to do wel no more than brute beastes, who are suffi∣sed with eating, drinking and sleeping, but is cause also why they are deceiued of their opinion: for they hauing aboundance of riches, and vsing them after their Iustes, doe iudge themselues happy, and thinke they are at their ease, and take their pleasure, and that no euil can happen them. Euen so the witolde and fooles, seing themselues to be the greatest heape, and perceyuing themselues the strongest (none resisting which can hurt them, and that by this meanes oftentimes come to atchieue their counsels & enterprises) doe iudge to bee at their ease and to haue sounde and sure prosperity: therein they become so dronken and abused that they thinke no euil can euer fal vpon them, and in this arrogancy they are giuen to inuent the destruction of their neighbours, and al the exhortations that can be made them by the word of God, they despise and reiect: but contrary to their opinion, they are en∣uironed & compassed with miseries & calamities, through feare wherof they become almost dead. And for that that in such mise∣ry, though they cry & lamēt, they seeke not those remedies which
they ought, they are destroied: in this sort their ease killeth them, & their prosperity destroyeth them. The Sodomites & Gomor∣rhians haue experimented such ease & felicity. First of al let vs thē Gen. 13. note that the way of the witoldes & fooles is nothing but sinne, wherof the rewarde is death. And S. Iames saith, Then when lust Rom. 6. 23. Iam. 1. 15. hath conceiued, it bringeth forth sinne: and sinne, when it is fini∣shed, doeth bring foorth death. It is not for nought that wee are warned not to consent to them, and to walke with them in their way. And as their way is not good, and cannot bring foorth but euil fruite: so their counsels are wicked and vngodly, as wee haue seene: for they tende to no other ende but to vndoe their neigh∣bours, and to contemne al discipline. Whervpon it followeth they eate nothing that is ought woorth: and againe, albeeit the bodily meate which they take in this world doth please them, yet it doth but poyson them: for spending the goods which are none of theirs, they deserue death which wil not spare them. If wee then woulde haue our bodies wel refreshed, let vs followe the coun∣sels of wisedome, Vnto the pure are al things pure: but vnto them that are defiled, and vnbeleuing, is nothing pure. Secondly, as the Tit. 1. 15. sottes and fooles shal eate of the fruite of their way, &c. as they deserue: so wil God graunt this grace to those which apply them∣selues to wisdom and prudence, that he wil satisfie them with the fruites of their good way and of their holy counsels. Esay saieth. Say yee, surely it shalbe wel with the iust: for they shall eate the Esa. 3. 10. fruite of their woorkes. The sottes and fooles, which forsake the Lorde, shalbee depriued of such meate: as it is said, Beholde, my Esa. 65. 13. seruantes shal eate, and yee shalbe hungry: behold, my seruantes shal drinke, and ye shalbe thirsty. and, Blessed are they which hun∣ger and thirst for righteousnes: for they shalbe filled. And as ease Mat. 5. destroyeth the wicked, for beeing fatted, either they forget God, or else spurne against him: euen so when the wise haue beene af∣flicted, they shalbe quickned, and not destroyed. Wee haue many promises and examples in the scriptures, but bicause of breuitie, we wil omit them. 33 But he that obeyeth me. That the faithful, (which feele thē∣selues to run often astray, according as their corrupt nature is in∣clined to euil) shoulde not dispaire, being feared with the threat∣nings
that are made against the foolish, and that they shoulde not thinke they are appointed to destruction, without scaping, wise∣dom maketh them a promise of great comfort: wherin she shew∣eth the remedie and meanes whereby feare may be eschewed, and destruction put away. This promise ought greatly to comfort vs: and for to receiue it, there is no more asked of vs, but that we o∣bey the wisedome of God, when it speaketh vnto vs by his Scrip∣tures, and by the mouth of his Ministers. But the Pope and his, demaund cleane contrarie, and burne the bookes of the olde and newe Testament, which containe the holie Scripture: they per∣secute and put to death, so much as they can, the Ministers of the word, and they that gladly heare them. And in this sort it standeth not in them that the wisedome of God is not dumbe, and we not deafe. And so doing no thank to them that we be not in continu∣al feare, and destroied. For sith the remedie and meanes to be deli∣uered of feare, and escape destruction, is to obey wisedome, and they wil not suffer it: it foloweth, that they seeke nothing but our ruine and destruction. Wherfore that may be saide to them which Christe did reproche the Scribes and Pharisies with all, Woe therefore be vnto you Scribes and Pharisies, Hypocrites, because Mat. 23. 13. ye shut vpp the kingdome of Heauen before men: for yee your¦selues goe not in, neither suffer yee them that woulde enter, to come in. When as much as in them is, they take away the word, which is the onely keye of the kingdome of Heauen, they hinder men as much as can be from entring in. For by the word, the Hea∣uens are opened vnto them which receiue it: & by the same they are shutte from them which reiect it. Sainte Peter hauing the promise of the keyes, hath receiued nothing but the charge to preache the Gospel, which whosoeuer beleeueth, shall be saued: and so the dores shalbe opened for him: and hee that beleeueth not, shall bee condemned: and so the doore shall bee shut a∣gainst him. If the worldlinges delight to sing and heare pleasant songes to the fleshe, and are not greeued thereat, but if they bee able, giue wages to those which can sing and playe vpon musical instrumentes, that they may passe their time from day to day: by a more strōg reason the childrē of God ought daily to apply their wittes and mindes to obeye this sweete voice of wisdome, yea,
to forsake al that we haue in the world, be they parēts or friends, be they temporal goods, reputations and honour, rather than to be depriued of this voice so gratious & desirable. This voice brin∣geth vs the law of the Lord, which is perfect, conuerting the soule. &c, This doing we shal truely obey wisdome, and by this meanes we shalbe safe: and when affliction shal assault vs, we shal not be Psal. 19. 7. afraide. As it is plainly shewed vs by the parable, of the wise man that buildeth his house vpon a rocke. By this same we may vnder∣stand, Mat. . 24. that what safetie or rest God doeth promise vs, seruing and obeying him, that we must not thinke wee bee exempted in this world from miseries and afflictions, from feare and dread. S. Paule hath well prooued it, as he shewed it in the seconde to the Corin∣thians. Likewise doe all they prooue it which will liue godlie in Cor. 1. 7. Christ Iesus, as it hath bene afore told them. The safetie then of the faithful consisteth not, in not suffering any affliction in this world, nor in not being astonished: but heerein, that whatsoeuer happen vs, we shal not be ouercome with feare, neither shall the afflictions come vpon vs like a whirlewinde, which should consume and destroy vs. The deliuerance from all euils shalbe when Christ hath gathered vs to himselfe, shal wipe away all teares from our eyes, and shal giue vs rest, ioy, and eter∣nall felicitie.
The second Chapter. 1 MY sonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee, 2 And cause thine eares to hearken vnto wisedome, and encline thine heart to vnderstanding. 3 For if thou callest after knowledge, and criest for vnder∣standing: 4 If thou seekest her as siluer, and searchest for her, as for treasures: 5 Then shalt thou vnderstand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God. 6 For the Lorde giueth wisedome, out of his mouth com∣meth knowledge and vnderstanding. TO the intent that we should not deceiue ourselues, thinking to be sufficiēt, simply & onely to heare the wisdome of God, he sheweth heere that we shoulde not be like vnto the seede which fell by the high way side, but to the good grounde, which receiueth the Math. 13. 4. seede into it: and that by so doe∣ing we shal obteine the former promise. And to shewe vs this, he declareth more at large, in that, which before he had briefly saide, and that for our better instru∣ction: because wee doe not easily at the first vnderstande what is spoken of God. At the beginning of this declaration, God openeth himselfe to be our Father, when he calleth euery one of vs (which hearken to his wisedome) his sonne: and this is for that we should the more willingly followe his desires, as also we are bound there∣vnto; and that we might perceiue he demandeth nothing of vs, but that a louing and gentle Father ought and may demaunde of his children. That which he desireth of vs, is, that when we heare his wordes, which are the seede of life, wee shoulde receiue them in such wise, that wee shoulde not suffer the foules of the aire to
come and pecke vp this seed. When he desireth vs to receiue and hide, he teacheth vs that we doe not his commandements, by do∣ing onely the outwarde workes, but the better to obey them tru∣ly, wee must print them in our heartes, and shoulde let the external workes proceede from the inwarde desire of the same, chiefly of the glory of God. Albeit that God also requireth vs to Mat. 5. 16. hide within vs his commandements: yet is it not to say, that it is lawful for vs to become false Nicodemites, making ourselues be∣leeue that our heartes be right before God, thogh they be dissem∣bling and couered before men: and not only so, but also that wee cannot lawfully seeme to consent vnto superstition, and idolatrie. The wise man doth not teach vs that: for as the Iewes were bound to declare themselues to be the people of God, by the outward ob¦seruation of the law, of the feastes, and of the sacrifices, and other ceremonies: euen so must we make profession of our Christian re∣ligion, by bringing foorth fruites worthie of repentance. 2 And cause thine eares to hearken, &c. Solomon shew∣eth vnto vs in this place, how wisdome desireth vs to receiue her wordes, by outward profession, & that we wold become her obe∣dient children: for therein she requireth that we shoulde bee hea∣rers of Gods word, in often resorting vnto the holy congregatiō, amongst whom the name of the Lord is called vpon, & we taught in this holy word by the ministerie of men. He sheweth also how she woulde not haue vs to be hypocrites, but that our harts shold be truely & wholy giuen to knowe God, for to render vnto him true obedience: when he saith, And encline thine heart vnto vn∣derstanding. When Solomon desireth vs to bow downe our eares vnto wisdome, he meaneth that the ministers of the word, should not be dumbe, & that it should not greeue them to preach wise∣dome, not the wisdome of this world: for it is foolishnesse before God, from whom commeth al wisdome: but that they should de∣clare Mat. 11. 25. the mysteries that God hath hidden frō the wise & prudent, men of this worlde, and opened the same to babes. And because the world is bare of such ministers, and that the sheepe are scatte∣red, as hauing no shepheardes: and that they which most bragge themselues to be shepheards, are rauening wolues, we must there∣fore pray vnto god, that it may plese him to accōplish his promise,
which he maketh in Iere. And I will giue you pastours according vnto my heart, which shal feed you with knowledge & vnderstan∣ding. Ier. 3. 15. And as the Ministers ought to speake these things, so ought the sheepe to be also attētiue vnto his voice, the which though it Iohn. 10. 16. be heard frō the mouth of mē, yet is it truly the voice of the great shepheard. Other sheep I haue also which are not of this fold, thē also must I bring, & they shal heare my voice, &c, Therefore let vs heare and encline our harts to this vnderstāding, with faith, that our Lord do not reproch vs, as he saith in Iohn, but you beleeue not: for ye are not of my sheep. Let vs then cause our eares to her∣ken vnto wisdome, & by faith let vs giue him our harts: frō the a∣būdāce whereof let our mouthes be opē to praiers, & thāksgiuing according vnto Wisdomes desire, as shee declareth saying: 3 For if thou callest after knowledge. Herein we may learn, that it is a very necessarie thing to shew ourselues the children of God by outward profession, & also to shew with how much our hearts should be feruent, when they ought so to mooue and stirre vp not only our eares to vnderstād Wisdom, but also our mouthes to praiers: therby to declare that wee haue great need, that God should giue vs knowledge, and endue vs with learning to giue him praise and thanks, and to shew how we acknowledge, and that all ought to acknowledge and confesse, that it proceedeth of gift and fauour, that wee are endued with knowledge and vnderstanding. Likewise when Solomon is not content to say, if thou callest after knowledge; but repeateth saying, and cryest for vnderstanding: He teacheth vs that we should carefully and diligently seeke wis∣dom, as if we perceiued it would depart from vs, and would for∣sake vs, as also indeed we are neuer indued therewith so perfitly, but that yet wee want much therein. This diligence is yet better expressed, when he addeth: 4 If thou seekest her as siluer. As the couetous doe not sleepe, for feare they should waxe poore, & also labour and suffer much hardnesse, for to get riches: and if they suspect any place where∣as is siluer or treasure hidde, they cease not, but with greate care and sore diligence doe seeke and digge it vp, that they may possesse; & forsake it not willingly til they haue gottē it: so should the children of GOD applie their senses vnto wisedome, and to haue al their delight therein, as in their only treasures. Let vs
then first of al note, that albeit wisedome would haue her children like vnto the couetous, yet notwithstanding shee alloweth not couetousnesse, also our Sauiour Iesus doth very muche forbid it vs. But yet shee woulde haue that the children of light should be as wife and prudent in their generation, as are the Mat. 6. 14. children of this worlde in theirs. Nowe the wisedome of the worldlinges is to be very careful to prouide for the time to come, that they may not want. Experience doeth shewe it, and the Steward which is accused, may be an example therof vnto vs. We Luke. 16. 1. haue not such a desire after the heauēly riches, as we may wel per∣ceiue, if we be of sounde iudgement: neither can we denie it, vn∣lesse we will falsifie our Lorde, who saith, The children of this worlde are in their generation wiser then the children of light. Luke. 16. 8 Thus we agree not to wisedomes wil, the which notwithstanding is needeful for vs to folowe, if in time to come we wil not want. Being like vnto the couetous in care and diligence; let vs flye coue∣tousnes, and with an earnest affection folowe the heauenly riches. Secondarily, let vs note that we should be ashamed to see that the couetous must be our teachers and maisters: And that their dili∣gence Mat. 6. Luk. 16. about these worldly things, must be a lesson for vs to folow the heauenly treasure. Furthermore, wee must confesse the great gentlenes of God, which doeth offer vs his inestimable riches: and to attaine thereto, requireth of vs no greater care nor diligence then the worldlings haue to hunt after earthly riches, which so∣dainly vanish away from vs, and perisheth. 5 Then shalt thou vnderstande, &c. He promiseth vs, that if wee yeelde vnto these conditions, answering vnto the desires & pleasures of wisedome, that we shal vnderstand the feare of the Lord, &c. This promis at the first sight seemeth not to be of any greate importance, neither doeth it seeme that wee may receiue any profit thereby: and therefore the fooles and mockers (which desire not to mortifie their fleshe, but to giue it libertie) so much as they can, doe despise and reiect this promis, neither doe they also make any accoumpt of the former conditions. But the children of God, which through the holy Ghost do fight a∣gainst the lustes of their flesh to tame it, doe set much by this pro∣mis, as also it bringeth vs great treasures & exceeding riches. For as it is said by S. Paul in the Cor. Thinges which eye hath not seene, 1. Cor. 2. 9.
and eare hath not heard, neither haue entred into mans mind or heart, which thinges God hath prepared for them that loue him. It bringeth vnto vs (I say) a sure habitation: for whosoeuer truely knoweth, how to serue GOD, with al humblnes & reuerence, with al holynesse and honestie, with al innocencie and obedience, and doth delight therein, is assured that destruction shal not come vpon him as a whirlewinde. It bringeth vs rest also, deliuering vs frō the feare of euil: for whosoeuer hath true knowledge of God, the same knoweth, that he is his almightie Father, and most mer∣ciful Sauiour: And therfore in very knowledge he saith, if God be on our side, who shalbee against vs to doe vs hurt? In this peace, feare shal not come vpon him like desolation, but walking in the feare and knowledge of God, he holdeth the way, whereby in the end he shal attaine vnto the possession and fruition of euerlasting life, where he shal quite be deliuered from al feare and danger for euer. And as they esteeme this promise, so doe they also delight to follow the conditions which are made, through the obseruing of the which, they attaine to this promise: not that by the obseruing of these conditions, they can merite the fulfilling of this promise: but bicause God (which lyeth not) hath so promised, & so pleaseth him to doe. The which well appeareth by that which followeth. For the Lorde giueth &c: By this reason hee closeth vp the mouthes of the proude hypocrites, which make thēselues beleeue that God is their detter: for sith that by wisdome, knowledge and vnderstanding, we walke the way of euerlasting life, the which we haue not, but of Gods gifts: then must these proude persons bee dumb, vnlesse they wil make Solomon a lyar. He sheweth vs also, that we cannot keepe the former cōditions, vnlesse it be giuen vs of God: and consequently that we haue not the vse of this pro∣mise, but of meere grace and liberalitie: for if the cause be not in our power, no more is the effect. Furthermore, whē Solomō shew¦eth that in the obseruation of the former conditions, we haue not to do with mortall men, but with the Almightie & eternal God: & that it is he which speaketh vnto vs, whē we open our eares to hearken vnto wisedome: he teacheth vs, with what feare & reue∣rence, and with what care & diligence, we shoulde reade the holy Scriptures, & heare the preaching of the Gospel: for therein doth
God opē his mouth to giue vs wisdom. And we must not imagine any carnal thing of God, seeing he is a spirite. Hereby wee may learne that we ought not to resort to the preaching of the worde, and to the publik praiers slackely, or for customes sake, as doe the Hypocrites, the Superstitious and Idolaters: but to the ende that we may receiue and learne wisdome of God through his grace & goodnesse, whereby we knowing him, may walk in his feare. And sith it is the gift of God, we should remember to pray continually vnto him for the same. And what wisdome soeuer we haue, wee wil praise ourselues neuer the more for it, as if we were some∣thing more then others which are voide therof: but without abu∣sing ourselues, we wil confesse with Saint Iames, that euery good Iam. 1. 17. gift and euery perfect gift is from aboue, and commeth downe frō the Father of lightes. Otherwise we should wel deserue to heare, What hast thou, that thou hast not receiued? Moreouer there is none amongst vs, which wold not only think himself to be out of 1. Cor. 4. 7. his wit, (if he should refuse a thing which he could not want) but also would iudge himself most vnthankful, if he did not receiue it with hartie thanksgiuing, when it were freely offered him. Nowe that this promise with the reason ioined therto, doth bring vs so much goodnes as hath bin saide, Solomō sheweth when he saith: 7 He preserueth the state of the righteous: he is a sheelde to them that walke vprightly. 8 That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he pre∣serueth the way of his saints. Heere Solomon maketh God like vnto thē, which through pi∣tie do receiue and hide the poore afflicted in their houses, from the wrath of their persecutors. The which we may knowe by two wordes that Solomon vseth in his speach. The first, which we haue translated, to preserue, signifieth also to hide, and to keepe close: The seconde, which we haue enterpreted state, doth come of a Verbe which signifieth to be: and so it may be translated being, as if he did say, The Lord so hideth the righteous, that he preser∣ueth thē in their being, to the end that destructiō shold not ouer∣come thē, but might escape, and so alwaies remain in their being. He meaneth not according as the world speaketh, when he saith,
That they shal remaine in ther being: for heerein hee speaketh of that life which he knoweth to be but corporal and temporall, the which oftentimes, the righteous haue taken from them through the crueltie and tyrannie of the wicked: but when the righteous knowe that al the heares of their head are numbred before God, they care not for their being in this world, neither doe they feare them which onely can kill the body. So long as God woulde haue vs to liue, we shalbe preserued: for they can do nothing against vs, but so farre as he doeth suffer them. And if our corporal and temporall state be to him so precious, by a more strong reason our spiritual and eternal being shalbe had in greater price with him, & he wil by his grace and goodnesse so couer it, through the blood of our Lorde Iesus Christ, wherein lyeth the assurance of all the faithful, that neither the worlde, sinne or death, nor al the power of Hel can any thing preuaile to destroy it, although they spurne at it, and doe whatsoeuer they can against it. After this sort, the righteous, that is to say, they that feare the Lorde, are in a sure dwelling, and may truely say, the Lorde is our protectour and de∣fender, Psal. 118. 6. we wil not feare what man can do to vs. For they haue no such power in their corporal estate, that they can let vs from rising again, and that we should not take our bodies againe to liue eter∣nally in them. Loe how we shalbe preserued in perpetual being in the possession of euerlasting health. The which Solomon doth no∣tifie vnto vs, when hee vseth the Verbe which signifieth not onely that which is doone presently, but also what shalbe doone hereafter: ioyning this therewith, that God is so faithful & con∣stant, Psal. 138. 8. that what he hath once begunne, he leaueth it not, but doth bring it to perfection. It is not Solomon alone that teacheth vs to haue such confidence in God. Al the holy scripture is replenished with examples and promises which should induce vs to such hope and assurance. How great is thy goodnes, which thou hast laide vp Psalm. 31. 2 for thē, that feare thee: & doone to them that trust in thee, euen before the sonnes of mē? And albeit that by walking rightly in the feare of the Lorde, we obteine this state: yet it is not to say, that it commeth for our righteousnesse sake: for of it selfe it is neuer without many imperfections, and so can not please GOD,
except of his onely goodnesse he allowe it. Seeing then that God of his onely mercy doth hide and preserue vs, it behoueth that being merciful as he is, we shold be so much as we can, the sheeld and defence of the poore afflicted, as Esay doth say, To hide them that are chaced out: not to bewray him that is fled. And in the 58. of Esay, Deale thy bread to the hungry, and bring the poore that wander, vnto thy house. It might also be saide, that when Esay. 16. 3. Esay. 58. 7. Solomon saith, how God preserueth the state of the righteous, that he doth like vnto good Fathers which wast not their goods, but doe preserue them for their children and heires. Neuerthe∣lesse, the first sense is the most meetest: as we may vnderstande it, when Solomon addeth that God is a sheelde to them that walke vprightly. Heere God is compared to a sheelde, or to a man which setteth himselfe against him, which woulde doe violence to his neighbour, and putteth himself betweene both, for to defend him that is like to be oppressed: and that very fitly. For as an experte man of warre, very nimble and strong in his members, can with his sheeld defend all dartes and arrowes, and al strokes: euen so is God the defence and deliuerance of those, which hauing founde the true knowledge of God, doe forsake al dissembling, feigning, and hypocrisie, and walke truely in singlenesse of conscience. And sith that God is our sheeld, and that we haue no neede of sheeld, and target, but in warre and combate: it followeth wee are in a battell the which we cannot of ourselues ouercome: and there∣fore S. Paule doth exhort vs to be strong in the Lorde, and in the Ephe. 6. 10. power of his might, Thus being armed, & God being our sheeld, wee neede not to be afraide for any desolation, but to remaine stedfast, looking for helpe and assistance of the Almightie. There commeth then no smal profite, when wee vnderstand the feare of the Lorde, and haue founde the knowledge of GOD: then wee walke vprightly and sincerely, whereby God preserueth our state, & deliuereth vs from al euil, that we may remaine quietly in euer∣lasting being. 8 That they may keepe the wayes of iudgement &c. The Lorde, as we haue seene heere aboue, doth deride and laugh at the Prou. 1. 26. foolishe, scornful, & fooles: but cōtrarily he giueth to his children (which receiue his words, & hide within thē his cōmādements)
safetie & rest. And this he doeth for to keepe all the sorts & waies of good & right iudgement: that is to say, to shew himself a righ∣teous Iudge, as he is, by making voide, and disappointing the wic∣ked of their purposes, by ouerthrowing their deuises and enter∣prises, and by punishing them for their contempt and wickednes: (which apply themselues therevnto, and the same to attaine, doe with great care and sore diligence encline their heartes therafter) and by defending and preseruing them from all euils. It is the same that Solomon meaneth, when he sayeth, That they may keepe the waies of right iudgement. If we would then, that God should not punish vs, but be our defender and preseruer, let vs encline our hearts wholy vnto wisedome. But to the intent (that if God doe giue vs this grace to vnderstande his feare, and to finde his know∣ledge) we should not attribute these vertues and giftes vnto our care and diligence, neither shoulde thinke that wee haue wel de∣serued that God should keepe such iudgement for vs: Solomon is not contented to haue saide in the 6. verse, that the Lord giueth Wisedome, but hee addeth, that the Lorde preserueth the way of his Saintes: that is to say, that hee keepeth those which through his feare and knowledge, and by ruling and gouerning them with his holy Spirit, that they are kept back from euil, and doe not con∣sent vnto sinners, neither fall into disdaine and contempt of his Worde, nor doe reiect all discipline and correction. Otherwise, without the same they should be spoiled of al righteousnes, iudge∣ment, and equitie, and should not know howe to holde the good and right pathe, but verie soone would decline either to the right or to the left hande, and would be of the compact and conspiracie of sinners. But when the Lorde preserueth their way, they know how to gouerne themselues, and do not wander out of the way: as Solomon doeth declare vnto vs saying, 9 Then shalt thou vnderstande righteousnes, and iudge∣ment, and euery good pathe. If then we walke rightly, delighting to giue vnto our neighbours that which is theirs, wee must con∣fesse with all humilitie and thankes giuing, that knowledge and vnderstanding and the preseruation of our way onely proceedeth from the free gift of God. And when wee are thus truely instruc∣ted, we wil not delight to walke the brode way, which leadeth to destruction: but by the straight way, which leadeth vnto life. And Mat. 7. 14.
that we may be preserued therin, we will pray with Dauid, Direct me in the pathe of thy cōmandements: for therin is my delight. Psal. 119. 35. 10 VVhen VVisedome entreth into thine heart, & know∣ledge delighteth thy soule, 11 Then shal counsel preserue thee, and vnderstanding shal keepe thee, 12 And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that speaketh froward things: 13 And from them that leaue the wayes of righteousnes to walke in the wayes of darkenesse: 14 VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the fro∣wardnesse of the wicked, 15 VVhose wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes. Nowe Solomon willing to declare vnto vs from what euils we shalbe preserued by this gift, doth set before vs a cōdition, wher∣by he warneth vs not to be negligent to accept this gift, but with all diligence to prepare our heartes to receiue Wisedome, when through the grace of the Lorde, it entreth to dwell within vs: and also that wee should not bee vnthankfull, nor esteeming this free gift, that we haue not, nor can in any wise deserue: but that wee should acknowledge it, abhorring ignorance, & setting our whole delight in that, that it pleaseth God to giue vs knowledge & lear∣ning. Folowing this admonition our, heartes should be set on the lawe of the Lorde, and to meditate therein day and night; & that Psa. 119. 10. we ourselues might truely say, what Dauid said, With my whole heart haue I sought thee: let me not wander from thy commaun∣dementes. Againe, I haue had as great delight in the way of thy 14 testimonies, as in al riches. If we thus doe, we shalbe in great safe∣tie and rest, as Solomon declareth saying, 11 Then shal counsel preserue thee, &c. When a wise man keepeth watch for a Citie, the dwellers therof may sleepe without feare of being taken by their enemies. Likewise when a man of vn∣derstanding hath the gouernance of another, the same neede not to feare to be euil guided, or that he should fall in danger: but bee assured that he wil so guide him, that he wil atchieue and accom∣plish to deliuer him safe and sound. Euen so ought wee to vnder∣stand
how Solomon doeth not heere promise vs any smal matter, of litle importance, but that he promiseth vnto vs safetie and rest, which al the world can not giue vs, though it stood armed rounde about vs on euerie side to defend vs. And because wee are more giuen to trust in outwarde and worldly things, and that we seeke rather in them our safetie and rest, then in the Wisedome of God, the which we mistrust, we shoulde, continually pray vnto God to turne away our eyes from vanitie, and to helpe our vnbeliefe. Else we can not enioy this promise, the which doeth not leade vs vnto a worldly and corporal hope and trust: but is giuen vs to this end, that we should be assured of the rest & preseruatiō of our soules: as we may perceiue it when Solomon addeth, whervnto God ten∣deth by this watch and preseruation, saying, 12 And deliuer thee, &c. Whē God preserueth vs, through the good counsell that he doth geue vs, and when he doth keepe vs through good vnderstanding that he putteth in vs, it is to the ende that we shall not walke in the way with sinners, which goe to destruction for their wicked manners and doinges and that la∣bour to drawe others after them: but should be kept backe there∣from, and directed in the way of saluation and life. Nowe as this euill way is broade and wide, and that many frequent and walke therein, by whom it cannot be amended but impayred: so is it full of diuers perils, from the which God deliuereth those ouer whom he watcheth. He doth deliuer them from those that speake frow∣ard things: not that he doth take them away from amongst them: but he suffereth them not to beleeue them, lest through their per∣uerse & froward wordes they should be turned away vnto errors, to false doctrines, & vaine hopes, & that their good maners should not be corrupted. Now the meanes whereby they are deliuered, is 1. Cor. 15. 33. that he printeth in them his word, whervnto they surely trusting, cannot be remoued nor seduced. 13 And from them. He continueth stil, shewing frō what per∣sons & from what dangers God doth deliuer the childrē of wise∣dom. And whē he settetth here the right pathes, against the waies of darknes, it is to make vs to vnderstād that the waies of righte∣ousnes, are righteousnes, innocēcy, modesty, sobernes honesty, tē∣perance, and such like vertues. For the wayes of darknes are vn∣righteousnes,
malice, excesse, vncleannesse, and such vices, as the Rom. 13. 12. Apostle speaketh of. Let vs therefore cast away the deedes of dark∣nesse, and let vs put on the armour of light. And againe, So that Ephe. 5. 3. fornication and all vncleannesse, or couetousnes, bee not once na∣med amongst you, as it becommeth Saintes. Nowe these vertues are called, the wayes of righteousnes, for whosoeuer foloweth them, hee may be assured, not to goe astray, but that without let or stop he may attaine vnto eternal rest. For hee foloweth Iesus Christ who is the light of the world, the Way, the Trueth & the Life. Contrarily, the vices are called the wayes of darknesse: for they that walke in them are vncertaine, what shalbecome of thē: as they which walke in darkenesse knowe not whether they goe. It is then verie profitable and healthful to be giuen vnto. Wisdom, and very dangerous to contemne the same. For by this contempt some goe into darknesse for euer, where shalbe weeping and gna∣shing of teeth: as they doe wel deserue, when so doing they for∣sake al vertues to folowe vices, which is the way that leadeth vn∣to this darkenesse. But as there be many wayes of darkenesse, so doe they walke diuersly in them: and therefore wee haue great neede that God should giue vs counsel and vnderstanding, to deli∣uer vs, not onely from one danger and one kinde of people, which labour to drawe vs vnto perdition with them: but it is necessarie for vs to flye the felowship of many, that wee may bee deliuered from many dangers: as indeede God doeth keepe vs for to deli∣uer vs therefrom: and besides the rest, he keepeth watche to pre∣serue and deliuer vs. 14 VVhich reioyce in doing euil, &c. That is to say, that we shoulde not be like to them which of set purpose are giuen to hurt their neighbours, and also are glad when they can turne o∣thers to doe as euil as themselues, making their boast & triumph thereof, as if they had done wel, or as they had obteined some great praye. Nowe it is needful for vs, that God should deliuer vs from such people, and that in no wise he suffer vs so to reioyce & boast: contrarily we ought to looke that God shoulde reioyce to giue vs according vnto our workes, and take vengeance of our ini∣quities. Not that God doeth delight to punish vs: but the wicked shal feele him such towards them, as they haue bin towards their
neighbors, whē they receiue the reward that they haue deserued. VVhose wayes are crooked. If we were like vnto such people, we might look but for an horrible vengeance of God: as the world destroied by the flud, & the Sodomites with the Gomorrhiās by a more sharpe punishment: seeing that God hauing geuen vs his sonne, doth dayly offer vs his Euangelicall word which is the mes∣sage of the euerlasting couenant: the contēners of which message shalbe punished more greeuously then they of Sodome and Go∣morrhe. Matt. 10. 15. God then sheweth vs great fauour, when he preserueth vs from being like to such corruptors and Apostataes. 16 And it shall deliuer thee from the strange woman, e∣uen frō the stranger, which flattereth with her words. 17 VVhich for saketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God. 18 Surely her house tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead. 19 Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life. When a path or way is much troden and beaten, there is no count made of any danger: & whē a thing is often done, although it is wicked, yet doe they make themselues beleeue that in it there is no euill: as they doe which rashly sweare, which doe geue themselues to lasciuious and dissolute talke, vnto couetousnesse, vsurie, & wicked bargaining, to slouth and idlenesse. Likewise be∣cause that diuers forsworne & vnfaithfull doe breake promise of holy marriage, & haue no cōscience to become adulterers, & that the worlde is full of mockers and contemners of the institution of holy marriage which God hath ordayned from the beginning of the world, and had rather committee whoredome then by marriage to take vnto them an honest companion or wife, the which is ho∣norable among all men: it seemeth to moste men that there is no danger to folow the way of adulterers & whoremongers, & that Heb. 13. 4. they cōmit no euill in being defiled & polluted with whoredome & fornication. But when the holy Ghost by the mouth of Solomō doth declare vnto vs: that God doth giue vs counsel & vnderstan∣ding, that we may be deliuered frō the strāge woman: he sheweth vs wel that it is not so as the world iudgeth, for if there were no dā
ger, we should not need, that God should giue vs counsel & vnder∣standing, to deliuer vs from her. Let vs not then folow the opiniō of the adulterers & whoremongers: but let vs beleeue that there is great danger to go vnto an harlot, & to talk with her, which Solo∣mon here calleth a stranger and a forenner, because, that if shee be maried, she belongeth not vnto him that haunteth her, but vnto her husband, from whō she departeth & alienateth herself in play∣ing the harlot: and so she is also a stranger towards her husbande. And if she be vnmaried, she apperteineth to none, but ought to abstaine, by tarying til God send her a yoke felowe to be honestly ioyned by mariage: so she is also a stranger and forenner, if shee play the harlot, seeing she belongeth to no man. Our Lorde doeth warne vs thereof, & doeth daily make vs to vnderstand it by the preaching of his word, the which he doth not cōmunicat so purely vnto al natiōs: but yet neuertheles adultery & whordō cease not to raigne. They abstaine not from vnshamefast lookes & counte∣nances, they refraine not their tongues from speaking foule & fil∣thy words, & to sing dishonest & wanton songs. By such wordes and songs, do the whormongers & harlots plainly vtter thēselues: and albeit to excuse themselues, they alledge that they thinke vpon no euil, they are not to be receiued for al that, but as wicked liers, which falsly belie the vnfallible Trueth, which pronounceth that Ma. 12. 34. from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. Let vs not then despise the counsel that God giueth vs, when hee telleth vs, that mariage is to be had in honour among al men, & the bed vn∣defiled: for whorekeepers & adulterers God wil iudge. Now that Heb. 13. 4. there is danger onely to talke with whoremongers & harlots, So∣lomon doeth shewe, saying, That the straunge woman flattereth with her words. It is not needefull to declare what flatteries the harlots & whorekeepers vse: for they which desire to liue chastly, need not to vnderstand them. It ought to bee enough for them to know, that it is not lawful for man & womā to dwel together, ex∣cept they be knit together by mariage. It is not also needfull to de∣clare them to such as are giuen to whordom: for they are but too much learned therin already. True it is, notwithstanding to admo∣nish the vndiscreete, that they may not pretend cause of ignorāce, we may discouer & vnfold the sweet words & flattring speech of the harlots & whorkeepers, with their strange attires: as Solomon Pro. 7. 5. doth declare them hereafter, in the 7. Chapter. After the flatteries.
Solomon discouereth the vnthankfulnes of the adulterers, saying, 17 VVhich forsaketh, &c. Solomon sheweth that there is much euil in adultery, though a mā be accustomed therto: for vn∣faithfulnes is no smal euil, but great wickednes: therfore the more one is accustomed therto, so much the more doeth he cōmit euil, & is the more worthy of great punishment: for custom absolueth not a gilty persō, but maketh him more gilty. Loke what we iudge of murther and theft, we ought also to iudge of euery transgressiō of the law, in what point so euer it is: for he that hath saide, Thou shalt not kil, hath said also, Thou shalt not commit adulterie. Whē Ier. 2. 11. then God giueth vs vnderstanding to defend vs from adultery, he preserueth & deliuereth vs from great wickednes. The vnfaithful∣nes of the adulterous woman cōsisteth in this, that she leaueth & forsaketh her husband: not that she forsaketh him vtterly, leauing him for euer, without returning to him any more: for vnfaithful∣nes standeth not only in that, but chiefly in this, that she ioyneth hirself to an other, separating herself frō her husbād, & making of one flesh two: and yet she wil not leaue returning to her husbād, to couer her vnfaithfulnes. Euē so likewise is it with an adulterer and vnfaithful man to his wife. And to shewe that the adulterous woman is not only vnfaithful, but also disobedient, rebellious, & vnthankful, Solomō calleth her husband Prince, Teacher, & guide of the youth of his wife: wherin he sheweth that he is the head & the gouerner, hauing prerogatiue aboue her: & therfore, that she ought to feare & reuerence him, & with faithfulnes to giue him obedience. That which Solomō doth here shewe vs, in one word, Ephe. 5. 1. 2. Pet. 3. 1. the Apostles S. Peter & S. Paule doe declare more at large. Like∣wise the adulterous man is not only vnfaithful to his wife, but cru∣el: for he doth not gouern the youth, the weaknes, & frailtie of his wife, in enterteining & tenderly louing her, as Solomō doth teach him, calling him the guide of the youth of his wife. And to shewe vs that by adulterie they offende not only against men, but also a∣gainst the ordināce which God hath made betweene mā & wife: Solomō saith, the adulteresse forgetteth the couenāt of her God. Gen. 2. 23. Mat. 19. 5. For who so committeth adultery, doeth separate that which God hath ioyned. What we haue said of the vnfaithfulnes of the adul∣terous woman (by the course of the text) it may wel appeare that he speaketh but of the maried whore: neuertheles, wee haue ap∣plied it vnto the single harlot, and that without wresting of the
text. For we ought to vnderstand that if God giue vs counsel and vnderstanding to preserue & deliuer vs from one kinde of whore∣dome, that hee woulde also we should abhorre the other kindes. Likewise it is very true that who so is geuen to adulterie, will not abstaine from single fornication. 18 Surely her house tēdeth, &c. Moreouer for to shew that there is danger in adulterie, & that they doe euil by defiling themselues with suche vncleannesse, Solomon geueth a reason whereby hee threatneth the adulterers with a thing which wonderfully feareth them that walke in an euil conscience. And it is to admonishe and warne vs to take good heed, not to frequent & haunt the compa∣ny of whores & whoremongers, least we defile ourselues, & con∣sēt vnto their filthines & abhomination. For if we would not wil∣lingly come neere a ruinous & rottē house, least in falling, it should bruise our bodies, & kil vs bodily: by a strōger reasō, we must not come neere vnto an adulteresse, whō to haunt, not onelie bruiseth the bones, but also eternally killeth the soules. The house of the a∣dulteresse, is herselfe, her acquaintāce & customers that goe toge∣ther vnto eternal dānatiō: which is a danger, wherwith whē one is attaint, he cā neuer be raised vp againe. Now we ought wel to vn∣derstand that this is of eternall death & state of the damned that Solomon speaketh, when he saith that the house of the harlot ten∣deth to death: for albeit that the Ecclesiastes (speaking of the com∣mon state of men) saith, One generation passeth, & another gene∣ration succeedeth. Agayne, How dieth the wise man, as doth the Eccle. 1. 4. Eccle. 2. 16. & 3. 18. foole? Againe, I considered in mine heart the state of the children of men that God had purged thē: yet to see to, they are in them∣selues as beastes. It were not a sufficient reason to shew vs the dā∣ger that is in haunting the company of harlots, nor to preserue vs from familiar communication with whores & whoremongers, if there were none other death spokē of here, but corporal death, the which is common to al men. A man might say, as doe the mockers, let vs play the whoremōgers without any feare: for nothing shall happē vs which happeneth not vnto the most chast. Let vs thē vn∣derstand that Solomō threatneth the adulterers & whoremōgers Luke. 20. 27. with eternal death: as also hee sheweth the same, saying, that her pathes tend vnto death. For none but the damned are dead: as it
may be knowne when it is sayd, that the Lord is the God of A∣braham, the God of Isaac, and of Iacob. There is then great dā∣ger, and also much wickednes in adulterie: or els God which is not only righteous, but also merciful, wold not punish it with so sharp a death. Now that the adulterers goe vnto eternal death, Solomon doeth giue it vs to vnderstande, when hee addeth: 19 All they that goe vnto her, &c. Heere he compareth them which are giuen to adulterie, vnto souldiours that goe into the warre, and there place and thrust themselues so far forwardes that there they are slaine. Wherein wee haue a proofe that in a∣dulterie is greate perill, and also much euil: seeing in it there is no remedie nor meanes to escape the punishment of eternal death: as also Solomon doeth signifie the same, saying, Neither take they holde of the wayes of lyfe. When Solomon doth so threa∣ten the adulterers and the whoremongers, hee speaketh of them which are hardened and cannot repent and bee sory for their sinne, and forsake their wicked life. We might heere reproue such, as doe breake marriages lawefully made, as they knowe wel e∣nough: Mat. 19. 9. and giue licence to the parties to marrie againe in some other place: which they cannot doe, without transgressing of the Lawe of God by adulterie and whoredome. I say therefore vnto you, that whosoeuer shall put away his wife, except it be for whoredome, and marry another, cōmitteth adulterie. And thus so much as in them lyeth, they bring men to contempt of Gods law: wherevpon followeth eternal death, not onely for them which are separated, if they keepe not themselues chast: but also for those that separate them: for they are in a great fault, when they hinder the ordinance of God to haue his course. For no thanke to them that the couenant of God is not forgotten, and al honestie ouer∣throwne: the which is suche an offence that it were better for Mat. 18. 6. them by whome it commeth, to haue a milstone hanged about their neckes, and that they were drowned in the depth of the Sea. The wayes and steps, the pathes and trades, for the which to a∣void, God doth giue vs wisdome and vnderstanding are the same of the wicked, and vnrighteous, whereby they go vnto perdition: and therefore forsaking them, wee must walke a contrary way to
them, wherein we may be preserued: & the same to do, Solomon doth admonishe vs saying: 20 Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous. 21 For the iust shall dwell in the land, & the vpright men shall remaine in it. 22 But the wicked shalbe cut of from the earth, and the transgressours shalbe rooted out of it. Whē our Lord saith, That there is none good but one, & that is, God: And also, that there is none that doeth good: for wee haue Mat. 19. 17. Psal. 14. 11. Rom. 3. 9. already proued, that al, both Iewes and Gentiles are vnder sinne: It may be demanded where a man shoulde finde out the way of good men, and the pathes of the righteous. I answere, Although that after the posteritie of Adam we be corrupted, and that in vs there is no goodnes nor righteousnes, but that malice aboūdeth: notwithstāding insomuch as we are regenerate by the holy ghost, and made newe creatures, not suffering sin to raigne in our mor∣tall bodies, but delighting in the lawe of God after the inwarde man, and giuing ourselues to worke righteousnesse, and to exer∣cise the workes of charitie: wee are both good and righteous, for that it pleaseth God to accept vs for such, for Iesus Christes sake, who is our righteousnesse, and in him are righteousnesse of God. The way then of good men, and the pathes of the righteous may be founde out in true faith working by loue, and by true re∣pentance, whereby all wickednesse is abhorred. If we thus do, we shal walke in the way of good men. And albeit that during this mortall life, we haue many imperfections, and that sinne dwelleth in vs: yet wil not God impute them vnto vs for our destruction: our house shal not be inclined to death, but shall attaine the waies of the liuing, and shal in them be preserued: as Solomon doth af∣firme the same vnto vs, saying, For the iust shall dwell, &c. For to encourage vs to walke in the way of good mē, he maketh vs a promise of a thing that na∣turally we desire, that is to say, to liue long vpō earth. And imme∣diately
after, hee giueth the reason wherefore hee allureth vs to walke in the way of good men: in the which reason he sheweth who are the good men and righteous, that is to say, the iust and vpright. And so he teacheth vs, that wee are not righteous and good, except we walke vprightly and sincerely. But it may be said that this promise cānot giue vs courage to walk in this way: for it belongeth nothing at al vnto vs which are heathen: but onely to the seede of Abraham, I answere, albeit that after the doctrine of Moses, Solomon heere speaketh expresly of the lande of Canaan, appertaining to the children of Israell: neuerthelesse nowe sith the worde of God is directed vnto vs, and that thereby we know Gen. 12. 17. howe the earth is the Lordes, we must take this word Land more generally. For in what countrey so euer wee dwel, sith the lande is his, he giueth vs our dwelling and abiding therein. And in this sort if we be good and righteous, iust & vpright, the promise belongeth vnto vs, & ought to encourage vs to walke in the way of good men. It may bee saide againe, that the promise to dwell in the land, is not beneficial vnto the iust and vpright, because that most commonly they are oppressed, violated, and threatened Psal. 24. 1. to bee rooted out of the earth. Answere, that the earthly life how wretched soeuer it bee, and what aduersitie soeuer they suffer therein, yet it cannot bee but profitable to the iust and vpright. For this earthly life is to them a blessing of God, & if it were, but forsomuch as God doth witnesse his fatherly loue towards them, maintaining them in this life. But it wil be said, that this bles∣sing lasteth not long, and so that they haue no great benefite by dwelling in the lande. I Answere, Albeit that sometimes it hap∣peneth that the Lorde doeth seeme to withdrawe the iust and vp∣right (whome he most loueth) out of this worlde, yet hee leaueth not his worde vnaccomplished, whereby he promiseth them that they shall dwell in the lande, and remaine in it, as we must vnder∣stande it. For what earthly riches soeuer GOD doth promise, we must take thē with condition, so far as it is expedient for our spi∣ritual health. But it wil be said againe, Though it were so that the iust should remaine long on the earth, yet the promise, could not ferue enough to prouoke thē to walke in the way of good men:
For we see the vngodly and froward, the wicked and hypocrites, to liue long, and prosperously in this world: wherewith the faith∣ful may be tempted: and therefore they are admonished in the 37. Psalm. 37. 2. Psalme, not to bee vexed though they see them prosper and re∣ioyce: seeing that their destruction is at hande, from the which they shall neuer be raised vp againe. I answere, that they which are not iust and vpright, vse not their owne in this life: but they vsurpe other mens goodes, as theeues and robbers: though they haue them by succession, by gift or getting: for they holde them without Gods promise, which onely maketh the faithful, iustly to professe that which they haue in this worlde. It might be further replied, that for all the promise which the iust and vpright men haue to dwel in the lande, that yet they haue nothing more than the wicked, and that indeede, they enioy not the land so largely, nor so much at their ease, as do the wicked: and therefore, that this promise cannot induce them to walke in the way of good mē. I answere again, That this is the same promise that God made vnto Abraham in Genesis: And the selfe same which is often re∣peated in the lawe by Moses, and in the Prophetes, and as ex∣pounders Gen. 12. 7. of the lawe: Wherefore the Lawe was our scholemai∣ster to bring vs to Christ. Again, for al the promises of God in him Gal. 3. 24. are, yea, and are in him Amen, vnto the glory of God through vs. Nowe Iesus Christ came not into this worlde to beare temporall 1. Cor. 1. 20. rule, and to possesse great earthly riches, as he hath declared both by worde and deede: nor to place his at their ease, and to make them great Princes of this worlde. Therefore we must vnder∣stand that in the promise of the lande is enclosed the same of the heauēly heritage, & that there are none but them to whom the promise of the lande is made, and which apprehend the same by faith, who are made heires of euerlasting life. As the promise of the lande is not giuen to the frowarde and wicked, so haue they no hope in the kingdome of GOD. It is then no smal mat∣ter to haue this promise to dwell and remaine in the land: as the auncient Fathers did wel vnderstande it: for hauing the promise, they rested not in the lande, but aspired for higher things, & that by faith, which hath no stay, but on the promises onely. For
if wee beleeue and hope for that which is not promised vs, wee shalbe frustrate of that we looke for as fooles and arrogant. That the auncient fathers haue aspired and looked for more excellent Heb. 11. . things, by the promis of the lande, the Apostle is witnesse therof. By faith Abraham abode in the lande of promis, as in a straunge countrie, as one that dwelt in tentes with Isaac and Iacob, heires with him of the same promis: for hee looked for a Citie hauing a foundation, whose builder and maker is God. If we should alledge this promis to the wicked which endeuour by violence to roote vs out of the world, they would scorne and mocke vs for our la∣bour: for they thinke they haue the power to destroy vs at their pleasure, and that they be maisters and Lords of the lande & that no man should gaine say them. But the holy Ghost by Solomon pronounceth the contrarie: for he saith, But the wicked shalbee cut of, &c. The 37. Psalme doeth set foorth this more at large. Al∣beit then that the wicked florishe and prosper in this worlde, yet Psal. 37. shal they not continue long, but shal within a litle space after their prosperitie perishe eternally. For if God doeth not count them worthy to possesse the lande by promis, much lesse will hee iudge them worthy of the heauenly kingdome, out of the which there is nothing but damnation. As then the euerlasting life followeth the promis of the earthly life: so likewise doth damnation and e∣uerlasting death followe the threatening of rooting out of this world. Thus whosoeuer enioyeth the land by the promis of God, the which hee layeth holde on by faith, may bee assured of euer∣lasting life: and whosoeuer layeth not hold on it through the pro∣mis, and is threatened to be cut off, and rooted out, may looke for nothing, but perpetual miserie. As touching the rest, God wil not please his children, wherewith hee satisfieth strangers, but will en∣riche them with his benefites which shal neuer perish. These pro∣mises thus considered, if we conferre them with the threatninges made to the wicked, we shal not enuie their prosperitie. For al∣though to the sight and iudgement of men, they are planted and fast rooted, and that they spring, florish and bring forth frute, yet shal they quickly perish. Contrarily, the good & righteous which seeme to be of litle value in this world, if they be taken away, it is Psal. 37. not to the ende that they should perish: but after what sorte soe∣uer
God doeth withdrawe them thence out of this worlde, it is for to plante them in his heauenly kingdome, in the which they shal florish eternally. When the wicked growe as the grasse, and Psal. 92. 7. al the workers of wickednesse doe florish, then shal they bee de∣stroyed for euer: contrarily in the 12. verse of the same Psalme, it is sayde, The righteous shal florish like a Palme tree, and growe like a Cedre in Lebanon. But albeeit the wicked doe wel deserue to bee so handled, yet is it not to say that the righteous and good deserue and merite that which is spoken of, on the contrary part. But al commeth only because of the promis. Let vs thē take good heede least wee swel and waxe proude by thinking on our deserts: but let vs walke on in feare and humblenesse, knowing that if GOD shoulde vse and shewe himselfe so sharpe as wee deserue, hee might cut vs of, and roote vs out of the lande, as wicked and vnfaithful that wee are of ourselues, and of our owne cor∣rupt nature, after the which wee are al corrupted: and doe abho∣minable woorkes: And if wee bee not woorthy of this earthly habitation, much lesse can we boast ourselues to be woorthy of the heauenly inheritance. Wee haue nothing then to triumphe ouer them which perish, as if wee did better then they: but if wee desire to bee counted woorthy to remaine in the lande, wee must pray that it woulde please God to change vs, and make vs newe creatures by his holy spirite. Wherefore also, though we be admonished to walke in the way of good men, with promise to dwel in the lande: and that the wicked are threatened to bee roo∣ted out thereof: yet ought wee not to folowe the opinion of the Papistes, which to defende their free wil, alledge the exhortati∣ons and threateninges of the scripture: saying, that it should bee in vaine for any to exhort vs with promise, and that in vaine it shoulde bee also to threaten vs, if wee had not power by our free wil to doe whatsoeuer we are admonished, and to eschue what∣soeuer is threatened vs: If we did folowe them, wee shoulde bee much deceiued. For the exhortations are not made, neither the promises giuen for to shewe vs what wee can doe, but what wee should and ought to do. We are much like to vnthrifty husbands that growe in dette, and haue nothing wherewith to paye, &c.
Likewise if God doe not holde vs vp and giue vs grace, wee shal neither doe that which we are admonished to doe, nor yet auoide that which is threatened to fal vppon vs: but must needes goe to destruction and perdition. The thirde Chapter. 1 MY sonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear keepe my commandements. 2 For they shall increase the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy prosperitie. FOrasmuch as Solomon hath ad∣monished vs to walke in the way of good men, & hath promised vs, that if we bee iust & vpright, wee shal dwel and remaine in the land: contrarily, that the wicked shalbee cut off, and rooted out of it: with whome lest we should be included and ouerthrowne, hee sheweth vs what we haue to doe for to walke in that same way, and to bee allowed before God as iust and vp∣right: that is, that we despise not the law of God, lest we become like the grounde by the hye way side, whose seede was made a pray for the birdes: but that wee shoulde bee like to the good Mat. 13. 4. Luke. 8. 8. Psalm. 1. Psalm. 119. Esay. 2. 3. Deut. 6. 6. & 11. 18. grounde. This lawe is the way of good men, The commande∣ments are the pathes of the righteous. Nowe the manner howe wee shoulde not forget the lawe, is giuen vs: wee must then continually meditate and exercise ourselues in the woorde of GOD. And because wee are rather giuen to vanitie, then to followe the lawe of God, let vs pray to GOD that hee woulde giue vs the vnderstanding of his lawe, and make vs walke in the path of his commandementes: as wee are taught throughout Psalm. 119. the 119. Psalme. If wee doe this with an vnfeined harte, wee
shalbe the true children of God: and though there be in vs many imperfections, yet our good God and father, wil not cease to lengthen our dayes: as Solomon doeth shewe vs, saying: For they shal increase, &c. Heere Solomon promiseth vs no∣thing which is not often repeated in the law and in the Prophets. Therefore seing we haue so great a number of witnesses, let vs in no wise doubt of this promis. Nowe though wee were altogether compassed about with euils, & that we shoulde walke in the mids of the shaddowe of death, yet ought it not in any case to be fea∣red, but that God (who is alwaies present with vs) wil accomplish his promis: and chiefly for our spiritual health, and eternal pros∣peritie wheretoo wee must aspire, and not stay ourselues in the dayes and yeeres and peace of this temporal life, that is to say, in the earthly prosperitie. And although the Lorde is our life and the length of our dayes, yet doeth Solomon attribute it vnto Deut. 30. 20. the lawe and to the commandementes, because that God cōmu∣nicateth both him and his riches to those which forget not his lawe, but keepe his commandements. For what nation is so great, vnto whome the gods come so neere vnto them, as the Lord our God is neere vnto vs, in al that wee call vppon him for? Heereof wee may iudge (seeing the contempt of Gods lawe) that the grea∣test Den. 4. 8. parte of those which say there is nothing to that to remaine and liue long▪ know not what they say: for they followe the steps which leade vnto death. They thinke there is no better thing to make them liue long, then to be merie and put away sorrowe, and to accomplish this, to let slip the bridle vnto concupiscences and lustes of their flesh, the which wil not bee made obedient to the lawe of God, and turne to him through true repentance. If they were wise, they would loue wel the sorrowe which proceedeth of the obedience to the cōmandemēts: for it bringeth no hurte, but great profit: & therefore S. Paule repenteth him not, that he had made the Corinthians sory. Likewise our Sauiour promiseth com∣fort . Cor. 7. 8.  Mat. 5. 4. to them which mourne. It seemeth to them also, that to ob∣teine rest, & not to be hindred frō liuing in felicitie & prosperitie, there wanteth nothing but the friendship of the world: the which cannot be obteined by shewing to be the true & faithfull seruant and childe of God by obedience to his woorde. But therein they
are deceiued: for S. Iames saith, Knowe yee not that the amitie of the worlde is the enimitie of God? Likewise our sauiour war∣neth Iam. 4. 4. Iohn. 15. 18. his disciples, not to bee dismaide for the hatred of the worlde. 3 Let not mercy & truth forsake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart. 4 So shalt thou finde fauour & good vnderstanding in the sight of God and man. After that Solomon hath generally warned vs not to forget the lawe, to the ende that we might know howe to follow his admo∣nition, hee deuideth the lawe and commandements of God into twoo partes, that is to say into mercie and trueth. As also, this is then his commandement, that wee beleeue in the name of his 1. Iohn. 3. 23 Sonne Iesus Christ, and loue one another, as hee gaue com∣mandement. Vnder truth he comprehendeth al the honour and seruice that wee owe vnto God, as is conteined in the first table: and vnder mercie hee comprehendeth what we owe to our neigh∣bours, as is commanded vs in the seconde table. Heerein wee see the summary of the lawe, wherevnto agreeth that which our Mat. 22. 37. sauiour sayde to a Doctour. For albeeit Solomon maketh not ex∣presse mention of the loue of God, yet doeth hee not altoge∣ther keepe it secrete when hee speaketh of trueth and mercie. For as wee cannot bee assured of Goods goodnesse towardes vs, vnlesse wee loue him: so can wee not also bee truly mercifull vn∣to our neighbours, except wee desire to obey God for that wee loue him. For God requireth of vs such obedience to his lawe, Det. 6. 5. 1 12. as proceedeth of loue. Solomon in this summary woulde haue vs so attentiue to the lawe of God, that wee shoulde neuer suf∣fer mercy and trueth to forsake vs: But binde the on our necke. Wherein hee vseth three similitudes. First of al, for to shewe vs that wee must goe forwarde in truth & mercy, hee like∣neth them vnto a yoake felowe with whome a man must be co∣pled, chiefly being in a dangerous way, and may not suffer him to come dragging behinde, or to goe too farre afore. For if wee bee forsaken of this fellowship, the spirituall theeues and robbers
wil quickly assault vs, and of ourselues wee cannot saue vs from their handes, but must miserably perish. Secondarily, for to teache vs, howe wee shoulde worke that this felowship may not forsake vs, hee vseth another similitude, making this felowship like vnto a yoake that is put on the necke of Oxen, and fast bounde that it vnloose not: and that is, when he admonisheth vs to binde mercy and truth about our necke. Wherein he woulde that with a wil∣ling minde we shoulde submit ourselues vnto the lawe of God: for he saith not, let vs suffer to be bound vnto this yoake: but that we ourselues should bind them on our neckes. And as the Oxen do neuer cast of the yoake from them, whereto they are bounde, but are compelled to remaine vnder the same: euen so must wee force ourselues to beare the yoake of our Lord, and continue vn∣der the same, els wee should bee constrained to carry the yoake of sinne, and so to be in the deuils bondage: as our Lord doeth well signifie it in Mathew, Come vnto me al ye that are weary & la∣den, Mat. 11. 28 & I wil ease you, &c. Thirdly, he likeneth our harts vnto the Arke of the couenāt, in the which were the tables of stone, where∣in the law was written, as God had commanded Moses. Euen so least we forget the lawe, our harts must be the arke of mercie and Ex. 25. 21. trueth, and neuer from thence to let them passe. But as the lawe was inclosed within the arke, and yet Moses and the Priestes cea∣sed not to open the same vnto the people by preaching and holy liuing: euen so wee also must not haue the lawe of GOD in our harts onely (as also it is vnpossible) but both in worke and mouth, Solomon doeth wel shewe it, when hee gathereth the lawe into mercie and trueth: for they cannot bee in vs, but they will bee Det. 11. 20. seene when occasion is offred, and when wee haue opportuni∣tie, the which wee must seeke: as Solomon doeth wel shewe it, when hee sayeth, bynde them on thy necke, &c. Besides the former exposition it may bee sayde, howe Solomon doeth admo∣nish vs to bee merciful and faithful vnto our neighbours: where∣vnto also Saint Paule exhorteth vs, Wherefore cast of lying, and speake euery man trueth vnto his neighbour. And that wee may phe. 4. 25. goe forwarde, hee admonisheth vs to binde the lawe and the com∣mandements on our necks. For by them wee shalbe guyded vnto mercy and trueth: and without them there cannot but bee in vs,
al vnmercifulnesse and crueltie, also allying and vnfaithfulnesse Furthermore, if we ascribe mercie and trueth vnto God, wee may say howe Solomon doeth warne vs, that if wee woulde haue Psal. 117. . God to continue his mercy towards vs, and not make his promi∣ses voide vnto vs, we must binde his lawe and commandementes. vppon our neckes. Nowe albeeit that these twoo last expositions conteine trueth, yet are they not so fit for the lyne of Solomons texte, as the first: the which may bee seene by that which is gone before, when he counseled that the lawe should not bee forgot∣ten, and also by that which foloweth when hee commandeth, saying, So shalt thou find fauour & good vnderstanding in the sight of God & man. By faith we find fauour before God, & also please him, as it is said of Enoch. And after this sort wee obteine vnder∣standing Heb. 11. 5. which is very profitable to guide vs to good learning. Through gentlenes we please men, & chiefly those whome we are gentle vnto, exercising the workes of charitie. Through this com∣mandement heere, which is like vnto a promis, wee ought to bee much stirred continually to thinke on the lawe of the Lorde, and to goe forewarde in keeping of these commandements, assu∣ring ourselues of his goodnes, and helping one another by cha∣ritie: seing that in so doing we are promised fauour & vnderstan∣ding, the which aboue al things are to be desired, & nothing to be esteemed more. Nowe first of al, when fauour is promised vs, for binding mercy and trueth vpon our neckes, we must vnderstand that what obedience soeuer we giue vnto the law of God, yet hee cannot be our bondman: for albeeit wee may deserue of men that they should be pleased with vs, and that they stand bound by our mercy shewed towards them: yet we can neuer be so faithful vnto God, trusting in his goodnes, but there wil be some doutfulnesse, distrust & incredulitie mixed therwith, for the which we wel de∣serue to be forsaken of God. And indeed, we should be forsaken, except he made vs finde fauour in his sight. Likewise, though it were so that wee were perfite in fayth, yet coulde wee not boast ourselues to deserue, seeing al the strength we haue or may haue, is the gift of God. Secondarily, the vnderstanding that wee haue by the word of God, which we kepe by faith & obediēce, is called
good, because it bringeth foorth good frutes to the honour and glorie of God, & to the profit of ourselues and neighbours. Con∣trarily, the vnderstanding that is gotten by mans wit and naturall reason, by doctrines & traditions of men, cannot haue this title of goodnes. For though it be highly esteemed in the world, yet sith it is reproued of God, & by him coūted foolishnes: we ought to re∣iect it as vaine and vnprofitable, yea as hurtful: for it comes of the 1. Cor. 1. 3. 19 20. & 3. 19. Rom. 8. 6. fleshe, the desire whereof is death. Therefore if wee wil auoyde death, let vs not folowe the wise worldlinges, but let vs rather choose to bee despised of them as fooles, so shall wee bee wise in Gods sight. Thirdly, when wee are commanded that through trueth and mercy wee shoulde finde fauour and vnderstanding in the sight of God and man, it is first shewed vs that the keeping of Gods commandements doeth not stande onely in outwarde woorkes, as hypocrites doe falsely beleeue▪ but euen as God seeth the harte and iudgeth the secret thoughts of men, herewith that our words and outward workes are no whit hid from him: so al∣so, al our affections, purposes, counsels, thoughts & minds are be∣fore Heb. 4. 12. him. It foloweth, that if we wil please & be wise before God, we must haue al our affections so ordered, that hee bee in no wise offended by thē, so that with al our inward parts we should be gi∣uen to meditate his law, & keepe his commandements. Further it is shewed vs, that as God hath not created the inwarde parte of mā only, but the visible & earthly body also: so he would not haue it vnprofitable, but would that we should bestow it about his ser∣uice: not that he hath need therof, but loke what we do through our bodies to the edifying & profit of our neighbours, according to his woorde, he counteth it done vnto himself. And this is the cause why Solomon would haue vs finde fauour & good vnder∣standing Rom. 12. 17. before men, and that S. Paule counseleth vs to procure things honest, not only before God, but also before mē. The which seemeth to bee very harde: for there is no people so detestable be∣fore men, as they that are giuen to goodnes. Notwithstāding they find fauour & vnderstanding, in the sight of men, as Solomon cō∣mandeth them, so much as they can, according to this holy word. For euen the vngodly which often do them hurt & wrong, are o∣rcome in their consciences that they be iust, & confesse no les:
as Pharao towards Moses & the people of Israel: Saul towardes Dauid. Fourthly, albeit wee must seeke the fauour both of God & men, yet is it not to say, that it is lawful for vs to labour to please Gal. 1. 10. Mat. 6. 1. men, or seeke to bee praised of them. Finally, sith that through mercie and truth wee obteine fauour in Gods sight, it followeth that if we be infidels and vnmerciful, we deserue to bee abhorred & counted fooles both before God and men, though by our car∣nal vnderstanding, by our subtilties and enterprises wee obteine the fauour of the worlde. 5 Trust in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wisedome. 6 In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he shal direct thy wayes. To the ende that wee may the better knowe howe to guide ourselues, Solomon doeth expounde the lawe vnto vs by partes, giuing vnto vs diuers commandements. And first of all, to the in∣tent we shoulde not bee forsaken of truth, but thereby might find fauour before god: he would haue vs to trust in the Lord wherby we should be assured he loueth vs as a good father doth his chil∣dren: & therefore that he desireth nothing but our prosperitie & saluation, and wil not suffer vs to perishe. This assurance is giuen vs by the worde: the which doeth set foorth the good wil of God towardes vs. Solomon saying thus, Trust in the Lorde, woulde haue vs to lay holde by faith vpon the promises of God, beeing certaine that God wil not, nor cannot goe against them: for hee is the vnfallible truthe: likewise that no power can let him to keepe promis: for he is the almightie, whose counsel shal stand for euer, and his whole wil shalbe fulfilled. Nowe hee sheweth vs that it is Esa. 46. 10. not ynough to heare and talke, but he requireth the hart. And hee teacheth vs that it is not lawful to apply our harts to the lustes of our flesh and worldly pleasures: for hee requireth the whole hart, saying, Trust in the Lorde with al thyne hart. In this hee tea∣cheth vs that which Moses teacheth in the twoo first commande∣ments, Ex. 20. 2. 3. 4▪ Thus our hartes must not bee parted to giue one portion vnto God, and the other parte some where els: that were to giue
a companion vnto God, the which hee cannot abide. And be∣cause that diuers not esteeming the woorde of God, (the which ought to bee the wisedome and vnderstanding of his children & seruantes) doe dreame and forge in their braines diuine seruices, whereby they thinke to honour God, labouring much there a∣bouts: Solomon to withdrawe vs from this abuse and foolishe presumption, doeth warne vs that to trust in God with all our harts, we must not leane to our owne wisedome: as Moses war∣neth the children of Israel. By this wee may iudge that there are Deu. 12. 8. but a fewe which trust in the Lord as they ought: for the greatest part of the world doe set their hartes on other thinges then on God, and many also wil serue him after their owne fansie. And this is through ignorance and contempt of the woorde, that they fal into such beastly blockishnes, as S. Paul saith, For God also pu∣nisheth Rom. 1. 21. their vnthankefulnes, in blinding and giuing them vp vn∣to a reprobate minde. Moreouer, considering wee cannot trust a man, except we loue him, Solomon exhorting vs to trust in God, would haue vs to loue him, as Moses saith. Nowe if wee doe thus loue God, we wil worship him in spirit and trueth, and wil cal vp∣on Deu. 6. 5. him, chiefly in our spiritual necessities, knowing that it is hee onely which wil and can prouide for al our necessities. If wee doe truly knowe that hee is such a one, wee wil feare to offende him, and wil rather suffer al miseries, yea death it selfe, then to doe any thing which might displease him. The trust then that Solomon requireth of vs, importeth a true knowledge of the goodnesse and power of God towarde vs, whereby we are led to loue him and feare him, to woorship and cal vpon him. And when, all the hart is required theretoo, (for it is the ruler of the woordes and woorkes, euen of al the body, the which is vnmoueable & dead without the hart,) it foloweth thereof that wee doe not trust in the Lorde, except wee apply al our woordes and woorkes, yea our whole body to his seruice. Likewise when Solomon maketh an Antithesis, setting our wisedome against trust in God, wee must Rom. 6. 13. & 12. 1. vnderstande that the wise of this worlde haue no trust in GOD: wherevppon it followeth that they giue him no obedience that pleaseth him. 6 In al thy wayes acknowledge him. For the second
commaundemente▪ Solomon woulde that wee shoulde ac∣knowledge GOD, not in one point onely, but in all our waies. For to vnderstande the same commandement well, let vs knowe that our VVayes, are our thoughtes, and affections, desires, willes, purposes, counsels, enterprises, wordes and workes, and whatsoeuer wee doe and suffer. Wee must in al these things acknowledge the Lorde: that is to say, wee shoulde not thinke, purpose no take any thing in hand, except wee bee sure that God guideth al by his spirite, If wee speake that it shoulde bee as the 1. Pet. 4. 11. wordes of God: if wee doe any workes, that they shoulde bee as by the power which God giueth vs, that he may be glorified in all thinges. To bee short, let God bee our ruler and guide, working in vs both the wil & the deede, according to his good pleasure: & Phi. 2. 1. by his direction let vs imploy ourselues about our saluation with feare and trembling. Likewise if wee suffer any afflictions, after what sorte soeuer they bee, let vs knowe that wee haue well deserued them for the offences that wee continually com∣mit against the Maiestie of our good GOD, by whose hand we are chastened, and not by other: and therefore wee must receiue his chastisementes paciently, with thankes giuing, in following Iob and the Prophetes, Thus dooing wee shall ac∣knowledge Iob. 1. 21. Iam. 5. 10. the Lorde in all our wayes. But if we doe slacke the bridle vnto our affections and lustes, wee doe not acknow∣ledge the Lorde, but deny him, and blaspheme his holy name, and prophane it, so muche as lieth in vs. And forasmuche as there is none so righteous whiche can boaste that hee ac∣knowledgeth thus the Lorde, therefore it is necessary for vs all, to lay our mouthes to the ground, & not to take the boldnesse to lift vp our face on high: but that with al feare and humblenesse truely to confesse innumerable faultes, and to pray vnto GOD that he would not enter into iudgement with vs, but bee merci∣full vnto vs poore sinners, graunting vs grace, that wee may acknowledge him in all our wayes. If wee call vppon him thus, in trueth and in feare, hee will not suffer vs to goe out of the way, and to wander in the broade way of damnation: but as hee promiseth vs by Solomon he will direct our pathes to bring vs to life.
This cōmandement ought to bee greatly esteemed of vs, conside∣ring the promise which is added therevnto. For there is none that delighteth to goe astray out of his way, except hee be out of his wittes: but rather will take a guide to leade him, and to carry him the right way, and spare not to giue him money to bee led the right way. Therefore we must bee very careful to acknow∣ledge the Lorde in our wayes, and wee shall not wander out of them, for wee shal haue a trustie Guide, who offereth himselfe vn∣to vs freely, as Solomon doth shewe vs saying: And he shal di∣rect thy wayes. Solomon is not witnesse alone of this promise, but also his Father Dauid before him. Gracious and righteous is Psal. 25. 8. the Lorde: therefore will he teache sinners in the way. And be∣fore this, Moses was a witnesse thereof, When hee promiseth the Deu. 28. blessing of God in al thinges vnto them which obey him. And then because of this promise added, wee ought to haue the com∣mandement in great price, we must also be diligent to pray, Shewe mee thy wayes O Lorde, and teache me thy pathes. For albeit the chiefe direction of our pathes is, to acknowledge the Lord in Psalm. 25. 4. all his waies, yet the promise doth teach vs that it cōmeth not of our owne power, nor by free will, that we acknowledge the Lord in al our wayes, to walk in the right way, & in safetie, but it com∣meth of the onely grace of God. If it remained in vs, it shoulde not bee needeful for God to make vs any suche promise, but it should bee superfluous: the which wee ought not to say nor to thinke. Wee must therefore humble ourselues, and say with Ieremie, O Lorde, I knowe, that the way of man, is not of him∣selfe: er. 10. 23. neither is it in man to walke and to direct his steps. If in thus acknowledging, we pray continually with Dauid, Leade mee, O Psalm. 5. 8. Lord, in thy righteousnesse, because of mine enimies: Make thy waye plaine before my face▪ And againe, Teach mee thy way O Lorde, and leade mee in a right path, because of mine enimies. Psal. 27. 11. And albeit wee haue many imperfections, yet wil God accept our acknowledging for perfect. Therefore let vs acknowledge all thinges to depende vpon God, and take nothing in hande without his will: Let vs not be like vnto them which say, Let vs goe to Iam. 4. 13. day and to morrowe vnto suche a Towne, and dwell there a yeere, &c.
7 Be not wise in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill. 8 So health shalbe vnto thy nauell, & marrowe vnto thy bones. In this third commandement Solomon doeth expounde vnto vs, how wee shoulde acknowledge the Lorde in al our wayes: & for to do it, hee giueth vs three instructions. The first is, Bee not wise in thine owne eies. Whereby he would that we shoulde re∣nounce our wisdome, and that we should not thinke to bee able for to gouerne and guide ourselues in our wayes. The second is, Feare the Lorde. Whereby hee woulde not haue vs to fol∣lowe the affections of our fleshe, the which doth cause vs to de∣spise God, and to stande vp against him: and that renouncing our wil, we shoulde giue obedience vnto the Lord, and with all feare and reuerence wholy to submit ourselues vnto his wil. The third is, and depart from euil: whereby he would that we shoulde cast of and forsake al vices and sinnes: that we should be cleane from al filthines both flesh and Spirite. Wee doe not acknowledge the Lorde in our wayes, except wee folowe these three instructions, the which depende the one of the other. For if we thinke that we be able to gouerne ourselues, we make no account to obey God, and to reuerence him: wherevpon foloweth, that wee giue our¦selues vnto al euil. But, contrarily, if wee feele our vnablenes indeede, wee become humble, and doe feare to offend God. There∣fore to acknowledge the Lorde in our wayes, wee must take heed that we walke not after the affection of our fleshe: for it is God his enemie, it is not subiect vnto his lawe, neither can be: wher∣vpon foloweth, that it can not be giuen but to doe euil, from the Rom. 8. . which we must depart through the feare of God, but not other∣wise. And in this holie feare standeth the true acknowledging of the Lord, and not in the feare to be dampned, the which holdeth vs captiue vnder mens traditions. Now first of al hee sayth not simply, bee not wise, for hee shoulde gaine say himselfe, seeing
that in the beginning of this booke hee affirmeth that it is made for to knowe Wisedome, &c. the which he commendeth greatly. And also in forbidding simply to bee wise, hee shoulde gainst saye Moses, from whome hee hath drawne this doctrine, in diuers pla∣ces. And hee sharpely reproueth the people of their follie, saying, Doe yee so rewarde the Lord, O foolishe people and vnwise? Deut. 4. 6. Deut. 32. 6. &c. Againe, in the 28. verse, For they are a nation voide of coun∣sell, neyther is there any vnderstanding in them, &c. So he doth not forbid vs to bee wise: but hee sheweth vs that there is a cer∣taine kinde of Wisedome which we must eschue and detest, which is not properly Wisedome; but arrogancie, pride, and presump∣tion. The declaration is, when hee sayeth, in thine owne eyes: Wherein hee teacheth vs that it ought to suffice vs, that God al∣loweth vs as wise, and that wee shoulde not thinke ourselues to 1. Cor. 3. 18. bee wise, but to become fooles, that wee may bee made wise before God. Wee must bee wise therefore, folowing that which wee knowe to bee good by the worde of God: But wee must not haue this opinion of ourselues, that wee are wise: for suche an opinion woulde make vs disobedient and rebels against God, and woulde engender in vs a great contempt of our neigh∣bours. In this wee shoulde not acknowledge the Lorde, nei∣ther woulde hee direct our pathes, but woulde let vs wander a∣straye. Secondly, for to shewe vs howe wee shoulde not bee wise in our owne sight, hee exhorteth vs vnto feare, and not simplie vnto feare: for the seruantes and children of God haue a promise (heere aboue in the 1. and 33. verse) that they shal dwel in safetie, and shall rest without astonishment of euil. So they Pro. 1. 33. shal not neede to feare any thing which may happen to them i this worlde: and also they shal not neede to feare damnation. Wee must thus vnderstande it: for Solomon setteth this promise agaynst the former threatening: but hee mooueth vs vnto the feare of the Lorde, which is the beginning of knowledge, as heere aboue where hath beene shewed what this feare is, and Pro. 1. ▪ wherein it standeth. Thirdly, after hee hath mooued vs to feare the Lorde, hee biddeth vs to departe from euil. Wherein he giueth vs to vnderstande, that when men liue without the feare
of God, then there raigneth nothing but euil: and also that where there raigneth nothing but euil, in that place there is no feare of God. 8 So health shalbe vnto thy Nauel. As it is not enough for a way faring man to bee wel directed, least hee goe out of the right way: but also for to walke, is required that hee bee whole, and haue his health and strength, and that hee haue wherewith∣all to bee refreshed: otherwise he can not perfourme his voiage, but shoulde bee constrained to stay and tarrie: So Solomon thin∣keth it not enough to promise, that if wee acknowledge the Lord in our wayes, that hee will direct our pathes: but hee appoin∣teth vs an ordinaunce verie healthfull, commaunding vs to folow it in our wayes: to witte, Be not wise, &c. The same being giuen, hee promiseth vs that wee shalbe in good health to walke in our pathes, when hee sayeth, health shalbe, &c. Through this promise wee shoulde bee earnestly mooued to folowe his or∣dinaunce. For there is none of vs but if hee were assured that the potion or receipt of the Phisition shoulde bee healthfull, but that hee woulde folowe it, though it were troublesome and hard. For wee are wonte to say, There is nothing but I wil doe it, so that I may recouer health: By a more stronger reason, when the spirituall Phisition doeth bring vs the heauenly Commaunde∣ment, and that hee promiseth vs health and spirituall strength, whereby we shal liue, not a short tyme, but for euer: we should bee readie to receiue and to followe this commaundement, e∣uen with greater diligence and loue, then wee doe the earthly commaundementes: by so much as the heauenly and spiri∣tual thinges are more excellent then the earthlye and cor∣poral, and as wee ought to preferre our soules before our bodies. And albeeit that Solomon in this promise doeth not expresse but the nauill and bones, which are onely corporall partes: yet wee must not thinke it straunge or amisse, if wee saye, that hee promiseth vs health and strength
to our soules: for as Abraham and the good olde Fathers had the promise of the land, & by this promise did assure themselues of the heauenly kingdome: euen so when God by his word doth promise vs health of bodie, we shoulde be assured of the same for our soules, and not to care for our bodies, but in as muche as so farre as we may, applie them to the seruice of God. For as Abra∣ham, Isaac, and Iacob, dwelt in the lande of Canaan but as stran∣gers, and yet God deceiued them not, but fulfilled his promise, by preparing them a Citie, and receiuing them into it: euen so, al∣though he send often vnto the faithful, diseases & afflictiōs, yet he ceasseth not to accomplishe towardes them this promise of bodily health and strength, in taking care of their soules. For healing ad fortifiyng their soules, hee forsaketh not their bodies, but giueth them health and strength, so much as hee knoweth to be expedi∣ent. Thus contenting ourselues with suche health as it pleaseth God to sende vs, howe shorte so euer it bee, let vs knowe that God is true in his promises, and let vs not enuie the healthe and strength of the wicked: for as they haue no promise of bodily health, so haue they not of the spirituall health, from the which they are wholy depriued, though they enioy the corporal. Now thē sith that by promise we haue health & strēgth, we shuld bee ready to giue thankes to GOD therefore, and to acknow∣ledge what his gift and benefit is, and not that wee can deserue it through our good rule and gouernement▪ albeeit that it is neces∣sarie to gouerne ourselues wel, if wee will reteyne health. For if by going forwarde in excesse, wee thinke to keepe health and strength, this were but to tempt GOD, who commandeth vs sobrietie and temperance. And our Lorde Iesus sayth, Take Luke. 21. 34. heede to yourselues, lest at any tyme your hartes be oppres∣sed with surfeting and drunkennesse, and cares of this life, and least that day come on you vnawares. Moreouer let vs knowe that GOD doeth bestowe his blessings howe, to whome, and when it pleaseth him, and can take them from whome hee wil: neither is it laweful for any man to say, Why doest thou so? Therefore, if wee be afflicted with sickenesse, with feeblenesse and weakenesse, let vs take good
heede that wee murmure not, neither to spite ourselues, nor lament through impatience: for it were to accuse GOD of vn∣ighteousnesse and crueltie. But euen as God doeth promise vs health and strength, if wee bee not wise in our owne opi∣nion: so when wee bee sicke and weake, wee ought to knowe that wee well deserue to be so afflicted, because wee haue prouo∣ked the wrath of God against vs, by offending in pride, rebellion, and vnrighteousnesse. Therefore let vs impute our sickenesses vnto our sinnes, by folowing the good old Fathers, who in their sicknesses felt that God was angrie with them for their offences: as it appeareth by Dauid, and also by King Ezechias. And albe∣it Psal. 6. Psal. 38. Esai. 38. that God doeth iustly afflict vs with diseases, and that it is not lawfull for vs to complayne of him, yet sith hee doeth promise vs health, hee woulde haue vs to aske it of him, and will graunt it vs: as wee may knowe by the witnesses afore alledged: and al∣so our Lorde Iesus doeth teach vs it, commaunding vs to aske our dailie breade, whereof health is a parte. Mat. 6. 11. 9 Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the first fruites of all thine increase. 10 So shal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy presses shal burst with newe VVine. The fourth Commaundement hath respect vnto that which God hath ordained in his lawe. Exo. 23. . & 25. 2. The first of the first fruites of thy lande thou shall bring into the house of the Lorde thy God. And againe, Speake vnto the children of Israel, that they receiue an offring for mee: of euery man, whose heart giueth it freely, ye shal take the offring for mee. And in the 1, and 2. Chapters of Le∣uiticus. And therefore at the first sight it may appeare that this Commaundement doeth nothing apperteyne vnto vs, but one∣ly to the Iewes, till the tyme that Iesus Christe came and appea∣red in the fleshe. For, if they wil receiue Iesus Christe, they haue the trueth of the figures and auncient shadowes▪ But Ie∣sus
Christe, who is the true Expositour of the lawe, and the ful∣filler thereof (and not the destroyer) doeth shewe vs well, that this Commaundement ought alwayes to bee obserued of vs: for hee sayeth, And the King shal answeare and say vnto them, Vere∣ly, Mat. 25. 40. I say vnto you, in as muche as yee haue done it vnto one of the least of these my brethren, yee haue done it to mee. And to this purpose Saint Paule doeth stirre them vp, saying: I was fil∣led, Phi. 4. 18. after that I had receiued of Epaphroditus that which came from you, with an odour that smelleth sweete, a sacrifice accep∣table and pleasaunt to God. This is the custome which is accep∣table vnto God. Deui. 26. 11. Mat. 12. 7. Heb. 13. 16. Then for to obeye this Commaundement, wee must bee mercifull, in helping the neede with that which is ous, as Solo∣mon expresly teacheth vs heere, saying, VVith thy riches. We must not giue almes at the cost of another, nor of our neighbors goods, as doe men and mayde seruauntes, and hyrelinges: as do the couetous, Vsurers, and theeues, which to the hurt of their neighbours labour to bee riche, and of the spoyle doe giue almes, whereby they doe no honour to the Lorde. For as in olde time the Lorde refused the Sacrifices of suche people, euen so the Esa. 1. 11. almes giuen of robberie, doe not please him. In which number are to bee comprised the same of Priestes, Monkes, and Nunnes, who vnder colour of long prayers, and of their goodly seruice, saide so deuoutly, doe deuoure and swallow vp the houses of simple ones, which are easily to bee deceiued. What so euer suche folkes doe, is abhominable before God: for hee can not loue that which commeth from iniquitie. And that which is gotten other∣wayes then God commaundeth, is robberie and theft, yea and murther. And therefore, let vs not applie ourselues to nothing more then to obey the word of God: for it alone shal giue enough in to our handes to bestowe▪ But when wee heare that it is sayde, Psal. 24. 1. & . 8. The earth is the Lordes, and all that therein is: and againe, Heare my people, I wil not reprooue thee, for thy sacrifices, &c: heere may a question bee mooued, whether it bee lawfull to counte and call that ours which wee possesse. Aunsweare, That wee neyther haue nor can deserue that any thing should bee ours: otherwise our Lorde shall not neede to teache vs
to aske of God that hee woulde giue vs our daily breade▪ but all the creatures are ours, and may vse them as ours, with thanks giuing, though they bee not due to vs, and this comes to vs by the goodnesse of God, which giueth vs all thinges aboundant∣ly 1. Tim. 6. 17. for to vse: and thus he doeth make them ours: vsing towards vs a wonderful fatherly goodnesse, that we acknowledging ther∣in his great liberalitie, shoulde not bee grieued to honour the Lorde with them, by distributing them gladly and liberally vn∣to our needie brethren and neyghbours. For it is sayde, God lo∣ueth a chearefull giuer. Thus doyng, so muche it shall want that wee shoulde neede, that God wil make vs to abounde in all 2. Cor. 9. . thinges: as Saint Paul doeth shew vs consequently, saying, God is also of power to make you abounde in al giftes. Wee must also spende our substaunce reasonably, as stewardes, sparing no∣thing where necessitie requireth. After this sorte wee shal ho∣nour God with our substance, the which though it bee parted in many partes, and that it bee eaten and consumed, yet shall wee haue alwayes with sufficiencie great abundance, as Solomon doeth promise vs, saying, 10 So shall thy barnes be filled. This is that which Mo∣ses Deu. 28. 5. promiseth, Blessed shal thy basket and thy store bee. Againe, The Lorde shal commaunde the blessing to bee with thee in thy & 88. store houses, and in all that thou settest thine hande vnto, &c. Notwithstanding wee must not iudge that Iesus Christe doeth forbid vs, to gather into our barnes, when hee sayeth, Bee not Mat. 26. 25. carefull for your life, what yee shal eate, or what yee shal drinke, &c: but onely the ouer great desire, and thought, full of distrust. Moreouer, when by the promise of God, wee doe abounde in wealth, wee must vnderstande that the abundance is good and profitable: there remaines nothing but to vse them well▪ For to doe the same, we must not be like the rich man which sayd, Soule▪ thou hast muche goods laide vp for many yeares, &c. Neither to Luk. 12. 19. & 16▪ 19. 1. Tim. 6. 7. the riche glutton which was clothed in purple, &c: But wee must folowe the counsel of Saint Paule, who sayeth, Charge them that are riche in this worlde, that they be not high minded, &c.
If wee vse them otherwayes, wee doe not honour the Lorde with our substance, and deserue that God shoulde make vs begge ou bread with great shame, and that wee shoulde suffer many ne∣cessities and calamities. Furthermore, though they which ho∣nour the Lorde with their substaunce, doe often suffer muche pouertie, it is not therefore to bee sayde, that God doeth not truely fulfill his promise, so muche as is expedient for them: for it ought to content vs, that hee knoweth better what is profita∣ble and necessarie for vs, then we ourselues. 11 My sonne, refuse not the chastening of the Lord, ney∣ther be grieued with his correction. 12 For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth. Suche as are weake amongst the children of God, when they see thinges to bee as it were confounded, in suche wise that they which walke vprightly are afflicted, and the vnruly to prosper: they are tempted with impatience, euen almost to be ledde to fo∣lowe the wicked, that they might bee partakers of their prospe∣ritie, as it appeareth in the 73. Psalm. Solomon resisteth such temp∣tation, Psal. 73. 2. when he saith, My sonne, refuse not, &c. In this fifth com∣mandemēt he aduertiseth the childrē of God, that if in this world they suffer pouerties and afflictions, that they should receiue them from the hand of God, who doth nothing but iustly and necessari∣ly: & therfore that they should receiue the same with al patience knowing, that thereby God doeth correct and rebuke them, as . Thes. 1. 5. they haue deserued, to the ende they should acknowledge their faultes, and to endeuour more and more to amende and goe for∣warde from good to better. But albeit it is profitable for vs to bee afflicted, as the holy Ghost doeth teach vs by Solomon, who com∣maundeth that wee shoulde not refuse correction: yet our flesh, which is impacient, and desireth nothing but his pleasures and ease, doth tempt vs to reiect the yoke of the Lord, discouraging & making vs dispaire, as though God persecuted vs, to destroy vs, &
as though he hated vs like an enimie and aduersarie. The Diuell also laboureth to put the like into our heades: & of ourselues, we are easie to beleeue him, and of the otherside we see in the Scrip∣ture, the thretnings that god setteth out against the wicked, & the affliction that he hath sent to destroy them. So, when wee are af∣flicted, we are temped to iudge that God hateth vs. They which are vnpacient, and care nothing but for their belly, doe thus blas∣pheme against God. Nowe to the ende that wee may bee tur∣ned away from such thoughts, Solomon at the beginning vseth a gentle and louing appellation, saying: My sonne, warning vs thereby, that albeit the punishments & corrections of God are vntollerable to our fleshe, yet we shoulde vnderstande he hande∣leth vs as a good father doth his children: and therefore, that wee must not bee greeued to be chastened of his hande. And not con∣tent heere with▪ for better to withstand the foresaide temptations, he giueth the reason wherefore we must not refuse the correction of the Lorde, saying, 12 For the Lorde correcteth. If wee receiue this reason as true, as it is indeede, we shal vnderstand that the chastenings, corrections, calamities and afflictions that God doth sende vs, are witnesses that he loueth vs, & that we please & like him wel, and that it is but for our saluation he chasteneth vs. We must not then iugde nor say, that God doeth hate vs, when we are afflicted: but rather the contrary. A man might say that the reason of Solo∣mon is not sufficient enough to lead vs, not to be greeued in our afflictions: for we see that without difference God punisheth as∣well the reprobate as the elect, and by his punishments hee decla∣reth more often his anger than his loue. Also the Scripture Eccles. 9. 1. speaketh so, and experience doth confirme it. I answere, when the faithfull are threatened with any punishment, and also suffer the same: they receiue it from the hande of God, and knowe that it is their Father which chasteneth them for their wealth, and there∣in he sheweth his fatherly loue. Contrarily, forasmuch as the re∣probate doe not knowe that they are gouerned by Gods hande when they are afflicted, they more oftē iudge that it commeth by chaunce, and being strangers from God, and his familie, they vnderstand not that the hande of God can touche them. Let vs
hen remember and thinke that when wee are chastened, we can∣not feele the tast of the loue towardes vs, except wee certainly holde that the afflictions which wee suffer, are fatherly correcti∣ons, whereby hee correcteth our sinnes. The reprobate can ne∣uer thinke so: for their thoughtes stray and flie hyther and thi∣ther. Also, Saint Peter saith, For the time is come, that iudge∣ment beginneth at the house of GOD. Wherefore albeit, that 1. Pet. 5. 17 indifferently God striketh strangers so well as them of his house∣holde, yet hee reacheth his hande towards his, in suche wise as hee sheweth to haue a speciall care of them. Notwithstanding, the true solution of the former obiection, is, That whosoeuer knoweth, and is certaine that GOD doeth chasten him, hee ought immediately thus to thinke, that the correction is sente vnto him, because GOD loueth him. For when the faithfull perceiue that GOD intermedleth in their afflictions, they haue a certaine earnest of his good will: For if hee did not loue them, hee woulde not bee carefull of their saluation. And ther∣fore the Apostle hauing alledged this exhortation, with the rea∣son, for to shewe that it is profitable for vs to bee chastened, con∣cludeth, If wee endure chastening, GOD offereth himselfe vnto you as vnto sonnes. But it might be asked whether it is Heb. 12. 7. necessary that all they whome GOD loueth, shoulde bee cor∣rected, rebuked, and chastened: and whether hee doe hate all those which hee correcteth not. Answere, His corrections and chasteninges are after diuerse sortes: for hee correcteth, and re∣buketh vs both inwardly and outwardly. His inwarde correcti∣ons and reprehensions are, When God setteth before vs the hai∣nousnesse of our sinnes, and for them hee doeth astonishe and feare vs with his sharpe iudgement, the whiche wee coulde not auoide, if GOD shoulde deale with vs according as wee haue deserued: And also of ourselues wee cannot hope to bee exemp∣ted from that vntollerable iudgement, when we knowe wee haue offended the goodnesse of our deare and precious GOD, and haue prouoked his wrath and anger, his (I say) who is a consu∣ming fire. Hauing this knowledge, wee weepe and lament in our heartes, wee are greeued and displeased to haue offended
so great a fatherly goodnesse, so high a diuine Maiestie: and in such griefe wee runne vnto his mercy. Neuerthelesse, let vs note that such corections are necessary for all Gods children: and who∣soeuer is exempted from them, cannot bee certaine that God lo∣ueth him. The outwarde corrections are diseases, pouertie, hunger, colde, persecutions, and other miseries, and afflictions, as com∣meth from without, the which are cōmon both to the childrē of God, and to the wicked. And it is necessary, that when they hap∣pen to the faithfull, they shoulde knowe, it is GOD which doeth chasten them, because he loueth them, and will saue them: and for this cause they ought not to refuse them, nor bee vexed at them: but to beare them with ioy and patience. Likewise when God ceasseth to examine them without, and giueth them a refreshing, as hee hath doone the old Fathers, they ought not to thinke that God hateth them: but being in peace and rest, ought to thanke God, and bee alwaies readie, looking to receiue of his hand what it pleaseth him to sende: beseeching him, that in prosperitie hee woulde not suffer them to fall away by slacking the bridle to the lustes of their flesh, to liue in ease and pleasures of this worlde: and in aduersitie to giue them strength and constancie to obey and beare them: not dooing as the wicked, which knowe not that all thinges come from the hande of GOD. Suche pray∣ing is verie necessary for all the faithfull: For if God leaue vs too ourselues in prosperitie, wee shall quickly forget him and giue ourselues to the desires of the fleshe: and in aduersi∣tie wee shall dispaire in him, murmure and set nought by him, yea and shall vtterly renounce and forsake him. Wee haue many and sundry examples thereof in the Scripture, as in Caine, Saule, and others. 13 Blessed is the man that findeth wisedome, & the man that getteth vnderstanding. 14 For the merchandize thereof, is better than the mer∣chandize of siluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.
15 It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canst desire, are not to bee compared vnto her. 16 Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory. 17 Her wayes are wayes of pleasure, and all her pathes prosperitie. 18 She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and blessed is he that reteineth her. Solomon therefore to make vs more and more attentiue vnto wisedome, doth attribute to a wiseman, that which euery one of vs greatly desireth, that is, that hee pronounceth him Blessed. Now how he is blessed, wee might haue learned by the promises wherby Solomō hath labored heretofore for to draw vs vnto wis∣dome, and may yet vnderstand it heereafter, by the reason that he wil giue, to shew how the wise man is blessed, & by the promises that the will adde. But to pronounce that the wise man is blessed, Solomon vseth a Circumlocution and comparison. The Cir∣cumlocution standeth in this, that he saith not, blessed is the wise man: But, Blessed is the man that findeth, &c. And hee vseth the comparison, in this, that he maketh the wise man like to a man growne rich by his labour. For as the man that is carefull in la∣bouring to finde riches and treasures, and hauing founde, doeth take them for himselfe, and seaseth vpon them, is iudged riche: e∣ven so he (which by yeelding himselfe attentiue to the worde of God, getteth wisedome, and abideth therein, by keeping the com∣mandements of the Lorde) is wise, and as the riche man iudgeth himselfe, and is thought of the worlde to bee blessed: euen so the wise man is assured that he is blessed before God. Nowe albeit the wise and the riche are heere compared together, yet it is not to say, that the blessednesse of the one is like and equall to the other: for the riches that are gotten by wisedome, doe not change, but from good to better: therefore the wise man is blessed for euer, and without ende: And as the goodes of this worlde do consume and are transitorie, so also the rich man is not blessed through his
riches, but for a certaine time. What cōparison then soeuer there bee, yet is there great oddes betweene them, the which ought to giue vs to vnderstand, vnto which of the two we must bee atten∣tiue: that is to say, vnto wisdome, to the which sith the Scripture doth attribute blessednesse, it followeth therefore that in riches & in all thinges else of this worlde, there is nothing but cursednesse when they are possessed without wisedome. Iesus Christe our Lorde doeth well shew it vs in the sixth of Luke. The riche man Luke. 6. 24. & 12. 20. & 16. 23. spoken of in Luke hath truely felt it. Now wisedome is the gift of God, and the blessednesse also which commeth thereof. Wher∣vpon it followeth, that the wise man will not reioyce in any thing hee hath, as though hee had it of himselfe, but will confesse that all commeth from God, with praise and prayers and thankes¦giuing. And sith the giftes of God and his calling are without repentance, hee neede not feare to fall into cursednesse to perishe therein: but may haue this assurance, that if he stumble or fall, God wil holde him vp with his hande that he shall not bee brui∣sed nor broken, but be blessed euerlastingly. Forasmuch also as they which finde wisedome, are blessed, it followeth that the foo∣lishe are cursed. And forasmuch as there is no other meanes to be wise, but by hearing of Gods worde, it followeth that the Pa∣pistes seeke for nothing but for cursednesse: when not onely they contemne the word, & wil not suffer it to be purely preached, but also persecute them which preach it, and receiue it, and labour to destroy the bookes that are replenished with the holy and sound doctrine of God. Now Solomon, to giue vs to vnderstande, who is the man that hath founde wisedome, addeth, And the man that get∣teth, &c. Therefore if wee wil finde wisedome, and be blessed, let vs not bee like the Horse and Mule, which want reason: but let Psal. 32. 9. vs get vnto ourselues vnderstanding by the reading of the Scrip∣tures, by the hearing of the word, beseching god that it may please him to illuminate and conduct vs according to his promise: I will instruct thee, and teach the in the way, that thou shalt goe, and I Psalm. 32. 9. will guid thee with mine ie▪ If we desire truely to be blessed, and to get the true riches, we mt thus doe, that is to say, finde wise∣dome and get vnderstanding.
14. 15▪ For the merchandize thereof is better: There is no state in the worlde that is so much occupied as merchandize: & looke how much as one merchandize is thought to bring more profite than another, so muche the more is it desired of many: and they that get most by it, are counted most blessed. And there∣fore Solomon willing to induce vs vnto wisedome, and to giue a reason why the wise man is blessed, compareth wisedome vnto merchandize, and doeth magnifie it aboue all precious and plea∣sant thinges to bee wished in this worlde. And because he ma∣keth this comparison, wee must consider wherein wisedome is like vnto merchandize. First of al to occupie & deale with mer∣chandize, it is requisite that the Merchant bee not slouthfull and negligent, but watchfull and diligent. The like is required in wisedome, as wee haue seeene heere before in the seconde Chap∣ter. Pro. 2. 4. Likewise our Lorde Iesus Christ and his Apostles teaching vs the true wisedome, doe warne vs to watche: for wee bee inuiro∣ned and compassed with theeues and robbers, which labour for nothing but to destroy vs: as the false teachers, the diuels & our fleshe. Secondarily, the merchandize that ought not to remain shut vp, but to bee put vnto sale, that it may helpe them that haue neede thereof: euen so wise men ought too make profession of Matth. 5. 14 Matth. 25. their wisedome by good doctrine and by good workes, as it is said in the parable of the talentes. Thirdly, as the merchāts do encrease by occupiyng, & become rich by selling and buing: euen so they which labour to profite in wisdome, shal abound: For whosoeuer Mat. 13. 12. hath, to him shall bee giuen, & hee shall haue aboundance. But there are some differences: whereof the first is, that if wee haue Pro. 2. 6. Esay. 55. 1. Iam. 1. 5. Mat. 6. 19. Iam. 5. 2. neede of merchandize, wee must dearely buie it of the owners: but the Lorde giueth wisedome freely to them which neede the same: as it hath beene saide heerebefore, and in Iames, and Esay. The seconde is, the merchandize may bee stollen, and also waxe rotten: but wisedome is euerlasting. Thirdly, the gaine of mer∣chandize is but to maintaine the body for a while: but the gaine of wisedome is the kingdome of heauen, and euerlasting life, which the wise man shall possesse for euer. It is then true that the merchandize of wisedome is better and more certaine: but fewe men
beleeue it, because they are more busied about thinge earthly, than heauenly: and they also to whome this merchan∣dize is euery day freely presented and offered, make no great ac∣count thereof. Wherefore the merchants of this world which take so great paine for thinges that perishe and vanishe awaye, and yet cost them very deare, shalbe their iudges at the laste day. But if wee woulde not then haue them to be our iudges, we must take them for our maisters and teachers, learning of them to guide ourselues vnto spirituall and heauenly thinges, with such diligence care and earnest affection as they follow carnall & worldly things. Mat. 13. 44. Nowe wee must acknowledge the great kindnesse of our GOD, who yeelding to our rudenesse, doth teach vs by things, most com∣mon Luke. 19. 1. and familiar in the world. And when it so commeth to passe, that wee loue, or atleast wise, iudge that wee should loue the bet∣ter thinges, and that wee woulde bee very loth too make the holy Ghost a liar, who hath spoken by Solomon: the merchants which say & count themselues Christians, should not be like these asses. or rather dogs and hogges, which had rather esteeme the tēporall merchandize aboue the wisedome of God: which labour to gaine a penny to their purse, than to heare any good instruction by the worde of God, and take it for a troubling of their head, when a man speakes to them of God: & also think, & make thēselues be∣leeue that sith they are merchantes, they neede not vnderstande what belongeth to God, and that it is enough for them to knowe how to order and mainteine their shop. Wee may gather of this comparison (as the trueth is) that it is lawfull for to vse precious hinges: for also they are not created of God without cause: but they that vse thē ought to be very careful not to exceede measure. 16 Length of daies: There is no merchandize in the world how good soeuer it is, nor pearles how precious and pleasant so∣euer they be, that can assure vs to liue long: but cōtrarily the grea∣test merchants, and they that possesse the precious and pleasaunt thinges to the eye, and in the iudgement of the worldlinges, are they that most feare to die: and also their death is more wished than others, and it happeneth oftentimes that some lye in waite for their liues, and labour to rob & to kill them, for to spoile them of that they haue. This is one of the miseries belonging to grea
merchantes and riche men of the worlde, that looke what they feare, doth happen vnto them, euen after their death, and canno obteine their desire, but are depriued of it for euer. The merchan∣dize of wisdome is farre otherwise, for whosoeuer doth enioy it, is assured to liue long, as Solomon doeth affirme vnto vs by Cir∣cumlocution, saying: Length of daies is in her right hande: and heerein he compareth wisdome vnto a strong man, that hath his right hand wel armed and fenced with good warlike weapon to defende their liues which are vnder him, and in his seruice. Wherevpon it appeareth that the man which findeth wisdome is blessed, and that his merchandize is better than the same of the merchants of this world, which are neuer satisfied, and at the end doe not inioy all that they haue gotten. But it might be said tha some prooue, & haue tried, that the wisest liue not lōgest, & there Gen. 4. 8. Gen. 12. 12. Exo. 2. 14. Gen. 32. 7 1. Sam. 19. hath beene some which haue not been assured of their liues. Abel died before his Father: Abraham feared the Egiptians: Moses also feared after he had slaine the Egyptian: Iacob feared when hee knew that his brother Esau came to meete him: And Dauid fea∣red to stande before Saul. As touching the Prophetes and Apo∣stles, some of them were slaine in the floure of their age, &c. An∣swere, That the first part of this obiection hath been handled and Pro 2. 21. resolued heere before in the 2. Chapter. Concerning the seconde part, the answere is, That the ancient & holy Fathers doubted not but their daies were numbred, & determined before God, & were assured there was no power in the worlde, howe mightie soeue it were, that coulde shorten them: but because they knewe no the number, and woulde not tempt God, they sought by al means to preserue this life, which they knew they had of Gods gift: And yet, in somuch as they were weake men, like other, their fleshe re∣belled against their spirit, so that their assurāce was not so perfect, but that it was coupled with doubtfulnesse and distrust. For as it is saide in the Galathians, The flesh lusteth against the spirite, and Gal. 5. 17. the spirite against the fleshe: and these are contrary one to ano∣ther. Nowe forasmuch as the length of dayes is in the right hande of wisedome, it followeth that what prosperite and ease soeuer we haue in this worlde, if wee be voide of wisedome, wee doe not liue, but are in death, Contrarily, what miserie and aduersitie soe∣uer
wee suffer, yet if we haue founde wisedome and doe get her vnto vs, death hath no power ouer vs, but we doe liue, the which shal neuer be taken from vs. The worldlings doe scorne & laugh at this: and yet for all the wisedome we haue, our fleshe, which is of a vicious and corrupt nature, doeth stirre and tempt vs to beleeue the contrarie. For wee see that the wisest men are most commonly poorest, and that there is no count made of them, but are a reproche to the worlde, and are persecuted: and when wee want the riches and honours of this worlde, wee esteeme not this to bee life, but paine & death. And it is commonly saide, that it is better to liue ten yeeres with ease, than fiftie in paine. Thus, after the opinion of the world, & fantasie of the flesh, it is better to fo∣low the trade of merchandise, or some other worldly meanes to become rich, for to liue easily, and haue honour, and so to liue but a while; then to folow wisdome, and liue poorely and in contempt a long time. For this cause then, that the contempt of the worlde, the moouing & fantasie of our flesh, shoulde not turne vs away from Wisedome. Solomon doeth shew there is no paine in the life of wise men, but that they liue in riches and honour: for he saieth that in her left hand are riches & glorie. Wherein he compareth Wisdom vnto a liberal rich man, that beareth a good wil towards the needie, & doth not despise his tenants, & vnderlings, but ca∣rieth his purse in his hande, readie to emptie it, for the comfort of the poore: and doeth not torment his inferiours by contempt, but doeth honour them, doing his duetie towardes them. Such is Wisdome towards them that finde her: for they that are truely wise, what pouertie so euer they suffer, in the feeling of the flesh, yet are they neuer emptie, but haue enough, the which they pre∣ferre vnto all worldly riches, and are contented therewith: for also it is much better. And moreouer, though they bee in contempt of the world, yet are they assured that God doth not despise them, Psal. 37. 1. but by his mercy he greatly esteemeth them: and therefore they esteeme & loue contempts better then all the riches of the world. As S. Paule witnesseth of himselfe: and the Apostle testifieth of Moses: and also our Lord woulde haue vs to reioyce in such con∣tempts. 1. Cor. 4. 10. Hebr. 11. 25. Mat. 5. 11. And when Solomon doth attribute a right hand & a lefte hand vnto wisedome, we must take good heede from thinking any
carnall thing of it, as if Wisdome had hands: but by this kinde of speech Solomō doth teach vs that the wise are assured to liue lōg, and that so much as shalbe expedient for their spiritual health, & that they shal haue goods & honors enough where with they shalbe contented, tarying & looking by this promise, to obtaine a life, riches, and honours, permanent for euer: the which the richest of the world can not promise themselues. 17 Her wayes are wayes of pleasure. When Merchants & other worldly passengers walke in the fieldes, they are glad when they finde faire way, & in the same doe meete with such things as are pleasant & ioyful: they greatly desire not to be stayed nor hin∣dered in their iourney, but to go at their ease without any distur∣bance: the which sometime they misse. For as the state which they professe can not assure them of that, so also oftentimes they meete with that which is cōtrarie to their desire: wherat they are grieued & wax wery of their way, & are vexed through the euil mischan∣ces, and finde no rest in their mindes. The wise are not after this sorte: for wheresoeuer they folow Wisdome, they finde pleasure, and their affaires doth prosper wel: whervpon they haue great qui∣etnes in mind: euen in the most hardest afflictiōs that can happē in the worlde, in folowing this counsel, My brethren count it for an exceeding great ioy, when ye fal into diuers temptations. For they Iam. 1. 2. am. 1. 12. doe well knowe that they are blessed that endure temptation, &c. And therfore, by what way so euer they must passe to folow Wis∣dome, yet are they cheereful & merie: Therfore the wise are not like vnto diuers rich men, who although they abounde in worldly wealth, yet on which side so euer they turne them, nothing doeth please them, they haue neyther ioye nor comfort, nor rest in their mindes. If then we would be happie, let vs not folow the trade of worldly rich merchants, but let vs lift vp our minds after wisdom, and she wil enrich vs, & giue vs sufficient and contented mindes: she wil pleasure vs, & deliuer vs from all sorow & melancholy: she wil giue vs rest, and quiet mindes, and wil make vs prosper in all things: and that not for a litle space of time onely, but all the daies of our life, the which shal not be short, as Solomon doeth affirme the same vnto vs, saying, that length of daies is in the right hand of VVisedome: and also doeth affirme here after, saying,
18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her, &c. A tree of life, that is to say, a tree whose frute is of so great vertue & goodnes, that it giueth life to them which eate therof: not like the trees which way faring men finde in the fieldes, whose frute if they eate, their thirst is alayed and they refreshed for a litle while: but they that eate of the frute of this tree, are quickened, for ne∣uer to dye: and it is therefore called the tree of life. Wherein So∣lomon compareth wisedome vnto the tree of life (whereof Mo∣fes speaketh in Gene.) and doeth put a difference betweene Gen. 2. 9. & 3, 22. 24. Gen. 2. 9. 17. & 33. the tree of knowledge of good and euil, whereof also Genesis speaketh. For as the tree of life was giuen vnto man for to assure him that hee shoulde liue euer, and by the gift and promise of God it had this effect and vertue to make man liue, & to preserue him from death: so doeth Wisedome giue eternal life vnto those which laye holde on her with trust in the goodnesse of God, by keeping of his commandements. And herein it differeth from the tree of knowledge of good & euil, whose fruit mā eating, brought death, into the world, and depriued himselfe, and all his posteritie of life. We must then take this tree of life, and holde it by Fayth, and obedience to the worde of the Lorde, and not desire any thing that hee forbiddeth, and which is not acceptable vnto him, as we are taught by his lawe and his Gospel. Thus doing wee shalbe happie: as Solomon concludeth, saying, And blessed is hee that reteyneth her: This particle and, is as muche as then: as if he did say, Thē blessed is he, &c. He saith not, blessed is he which is counted amongst wise men, and deferreth himself to their Wis∣dome: but hee sayeth, Blessed is euery man that reteineth her himselfe, and liueth thereby: as in the world they wil not iudge him happie that suffreth himself to dye with hunger in the midst of his goods, and will onely content himselfe to see others eate, and wonder at them that eate and satisfie their hunger. As such people are right worthie to bee esteemed foolishe and madde, and deserue to drye and fal away: euen so also are they worthie which content themselues onely to esteeme wel of wise men, and won∣der at them. With suche kinde of people is poperie suffed, and here is no smal number of them, besides in other places. Wherof it foloweth, that the world is full of cursed people, and that the
number of the blessed is verie small: for of ten thousande, hardlie shal one be found that wil take hold of this tree of life, & reteine her to refresh himself with her fruites, and to enioy her reuenew. The world is wonderfully out of tast: it had rather eate the fruite, whereby at the last it shal feele what benefite it hath forsaken, and into what euils it hath cast it self headlong. We also are all of this nature, in as much as we are the children of Adam, who contented not himselfe to eate of the fruite that GOD had permitted and giuen him: but against the wil of God would taste of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and euil, whereby after wardes he knew what riches hee had lost, and into what miserie hee had cast both himself and al his posteritie, if God of his goodnes & mercie had not sent a remedie, by our Lorde Iesus Christ, of whome this tree of life was a figure. For it is he which is the true Wisdome, the euerlasting Word of God, wherein life remained. If then wee will liue, & be blessed, wee must take Iesus Christ for our tree of lyfe, wherwith our soules should be nourished eternally. 19 The Lord by VVisedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath stablished the heauens through vnderstanding. 20 By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe. 21 My Sonne, let not these things depart from thine eies, but obserue VVisdome and counsell. 22 So they shalbe life vnto thy soule, and grace vnto thy necke. To the end that we should not iudge that the Wisdom which Solomon doeth so carefully commend vnto vs, (attributing great vertues, & excellent graces vnto her) is a thing fained in the braine of men, and that it doeth perishe with them, and for this occasion should be led to mistrust her, and to despise her▪ and therfore he doeth declare vnto vs his eternitie, diuinitie, & power. For if the Lorde haue builded the earth by Wisedome, &c: it foloweth, first that she is before al creatures, & so she is eternal: and forasmuch as there is none but God that is euerlasting, we must vnderstande that Wisdom is of one diuine essence with God, and consequen∣ly of all one power.
When Solomon speaketh thus of wisedome, he doeth attribute he creation, ordering and gouernment of al things, aswel hea∣uenly as earthly vnto her: and therein he sheweth that it is the e∣ternal worde: wher of moes speaketh. Whereupon we must vn∣derstand Gen. 1 5. Iohn. 1. 1▪ that this wisedome is the euerlasting Sonne of God, our Lord Iesus Christ. And so by these wordes Solomon allureth vs to put al our felicitie, al the hope of our saluation, al our ioy & plea∣sure in Iesus Christ, and that hee only should be our contentation and satisfying: so that we shoulde not desire other riches nor trea∣sures, but that he should be vnto vs al in al, as he only hath crea∣ed things, ordered al things, ordered al, and holdeth al in his power. And if in this orte we take him vnto vs, and holde him fast, then blessed are we, for we shal want nothing. Nowe that by these woordes of Solo∣mon we shoulde be induced to knowe the eternite diuinitie and power of wisedome, to ioyne ourselues vnto her, and to put al our trust in her, wee may learne the same by other places of the scripture, in the which the holy Ghost willing to turne vs from the vaine trust of Idols, and to make vs leane vpon one God one∣ly, doeth attribute the creation of the worlde, the disposing, guy∣ding Gen. 1. 1. Esa. 40. 26. & 42. 5. & 44. 24. &. 45 18. Ier. 10. 12. and gouerning of al things vnto him. It is then the maner of the scripture to set the creation of the worlde before vs, when it endeuoureth to induce vs to put our trust in God: and also when we make confession of our faith, wee confesse that God is maker of heauen and earth. As touching the rest, when wisedome hath so holpen, and stil doeth mainteine al things which are created for man his sake, and doe serue him: we ought to vnderstand thereby that she wil not forsake vs, seeing that wee are much more excel∣lent Mat. 6. 26. then the things which are created for our vse and seruice. For if God take care of things that are lesse then we, by a stronger reason he wil assist vs in al our needes. Moreouer when wee see the earth so stedfastly settled, and that it vpholdeth greate buil∣dings and high mountaines, without any remoouing: that it bea∣reth both great and smal trees, and bringeth forth al greene things for foode to man and beast: that the heauens with their hostes doe continually keepe their course, without shaking and weari∣nesse: that out of the deepes do rise the springs of waters, from whence the welles, riuers, pondes, and sea doe come, for the ne∣cessitie
both of man and beases: and that we see also that to giue vs abundance and greater fruitefulnesse, the cloudes drop downe, the raine to moisten and to make the earth fat: and that of all these thinges there is none in our power, that by our thought and care wee can in no wise further them: we must confesse it is God onely that worketh by his wisedome, though he would haue that man should labour, and that he vseth man as his instrument. And therefore with knowledge we must confesse, O Lord, how mani∣folde are thy workes, in wisedome hast thou made them all. And Psal. 104. 24 for to make this confession truely, we must (through the conside∣ration of gods workes) renounce our owne wittes, and be willing to be brought to the knowledge of the euerlasting power and di∣uinitie of God, that we may glorifie him as God and not turne a∣way ourselues from him vnto superstitiō and idolatrie, the which if wee shoulde doe, wee shal deserue that God shoulde bee moo∣ued to powre his wrath vpon vs, as vpon the wicked and vngod∣ly, and to giue vs vp vnto a reprobate minde, for to damne vs eter∣nally. As concerning the rest, if God haue giuen vs any knowledge of the gouernment aswel of the heauens as of the earth, of the aire and of the waters, let vs not swel with our knowledge, as the Phi∣losophers, which did attribute vnto their diligence, wit, and capa∣citie the knowledge that they had of this world: but with all hu∣militie let vs confesse, that it is GOD that imparteth vnto vs his wisedome, vnderstanding and knowledge. Also let vs take heede from finding any faulte in the workes of God, neither let vs murmure at all when matters shal not follow our fantasie: but let vs thanke God for all, in that it pleaseth him to gouerne all by his wisedome for our seruice. 21 My sonne. Wisedome is a treasure inestimable, wonderfull, profitable and full of pleasure, as wee haue hearde, and still may heare. When wee see that Solomon is not contented with the former prayses, whereby he hath declared vnto vs the profite and pleasure that they haue which are possessed with wisedome, but doeth admonishe vs, carefully to keepe it, saying, My sonne, let not these thinges depart, &c: When wee see that God by Solomon speaketh vnto vs gently, calling vs his sonnes, and that
he doth admonish vs for our great profite and honor; wee must be redie to heare him, and diligent to obey him: if not, we deserue to be depriued of these great riches, which are offered vnto vs, and miserably to perishe. Now if so be that worldly rich men doe warn their children safely to kepe the treasures that they haue ga∣thered for them, the which notwithstanding are transitorie, so we ought not to thinke it straunge nor painefull, if God by Solomon commende vnto vs so carefully his treasure of wisedome, which cannot perishe, but we without it shall perish: And it behooueth vs throughly too praise and loue our heauenly father, by setting foorth his praises, and giuing him thankes for that hee doeth offer dayly vnto vs by his worde, the treasure of his wisedome, & doth exhort vs to keepe it carefully. And for to shewe that we doe tru∣ly esteeme both our Father and his treasure, replenished with so great riches and precious iewels, wee must take heede that such goods bee not pulled and taken from our eyes. And for to do this duelie, wee must not vse our wittes and fantasie, but stande in neede to bee armed with counsel and Wisedome, to keepe dili∣gent watche ouer this treasure: the which wee shall obtaine, if our desire bee set in the lawe of the Lorde, &c: and that we fol∣lowe Deu. 6. 6. & 11. 18. the counsel of Moses: And these wordes which I commaund thee this day, shalbe in thy heart, &c. These are the eyes which Solomon chiefly requireth, as hee himselfe doeth shewe, when after hauing spoken of the eyes, hee addeth, but obserue VVise∣dome and counsell, &c. And for as muche as wee can not haue better Wisedome and counsell, then to folowe the word of God, wee learne not to come vnto the Sermon to feede our eyes, and Mat. 7. 24. to fill our eares, but to receiue Wisedome and counsel, and ther∣after to bee guided and gouerned. Thus doing, wee shall possesse Wisdome, we shal keepe it, and it wil preserue vs. 22 So they shalbe life vnto thy soule. As Solomon is very diligent to exhort vs to bee hearers of Wisedome: so also to en∣courage vs to folowe his admonitions, hee promiseth vs life & honour. And because that the riche of this worlde thinke them¦selues well assured to liue (as the riche glutton which is spo∣ken of in Saincte Luke) and moste commonly are deceyued▪
therefore to assure vs that the obteining of wisedome is bette then al worldly riches, hee promiseth vs that wee shal liue euer∣lastingly: for hee doeth promise vs the life of the soule, whereby wise men doe liue, euen presently, when they are fed with the seede of life, which is the Euangelical woorde, assuring them∣selues of the goodnesse of God in Iesus Christ. For man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery woorde that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. The wolrde which persecuteth the wise in∣deed, Mat. 4. 4. Det. 8. 3. doth not see this life: for it is compassed with many mise∣ries and afflictions, and seemeth rather that the wise are in death, and that they perish. The very wise themselues heere in this life doe not see it: but they hope for it. Wee are saued through hope. Rom. 18. 24 And albeit that for the wronges and reproches that the wise doe suffer, they bee tempted to murmure and to lament, as if they were in death: yet knowing that hope maketh not ashamed, they abide patiently for the day wherein this life shalbee declared, vn∣til which time it is hidde with Christ in God, who is faithful: & therefore they are assured of this, that hee wil not denye them that, which hee keepeth for them: seeing also that this their life is common with Iesus Christe, who wil not disappoint his bre∣thren and companions. Euen so that which the wise and faithful holde in hope, they shal one day enioy and openly possesse. For when Christ, which is our life shal appeare, then shal we also ap∣peare ol. 3. 4. with him in glory. Contrarily, the soules of the foolish are and shalbe in death. Hee compareth the honour that hee pro∣miseth the wise, vnto a purse of iewelles hanging about the necke: and indeede, wisedome is a glistering purse before GOD, who looketh into the inwarde beautie, and to the goodnesse of the harte, and doeth so wel please him and so greatly doth esteeme it, that hee rewardeth the same with eternal life. For vnto them which through perseuerance in well dooing, seeke glory, honou om. 2. 7. and immortalitie, eternal life, &c. Wee may also vnderstande that the wise wil speake so discretly, that men shall receyue his woordes with honour and reuerence, and that they will gladlye heare him speake, and his woordes shal serue to edifica∣ion▪
23 Then shalt thou walke safely by thy way: and thy foote shal not stumble. Psal. 91. . 24 If thou sleepest, thou shalt not bee afraide, and when thou sleepest, thy sleepe shalbe sweete. The former promis ought to be sufficient ynough for to en∣courage vs to followe the ade of wisedome, and carefully to giue ourselues therunto, & neuer to forsake her: but forasmuch as the said promise respecteth chiefly the tyme to come, vnto the which time the fulpossession of that which is promised is defer∣red: and lest the delay might make vs negligent, except wee had presently some commoditie, and might waxe desperate, as if wee were in death, seeing that the life of the godly wise, is compassed with misery: Therefore Solomon doth promis vs that in the mids of troubles we shalbe preserued, that they shal not hurt vs, but that we shal prosper in our way, and in al our affaires: so farre off shal it be that we shal fal, to perish▪ that we shal meete with no∣thing to hinder vs, from going the right way, but shal come to the ende of our affaires with ease. For through wisedome, wherwith we shalbe seasoned, staying ourselues vpon the worde of God, we shal ouercome al lets that the flesh, the worlde and the Deuil can set against vs, so that no euil shalbe tyde vs, nor any wounde shal come neere our dwelling. And this wee must wel note, that Solo∣mon saith, in thy way. Hee doeth not promise vs safetie, if wee fol∣lowe any other trade or way then we ought, if we forsake our vo∣cation and folowe our good intents, and being disobedient to the commandementes of God, doe folowe mens traditions and the doctrines of Deuils. For when we delight in ourselues, and for∣sake the wayes which the Lorde teacheth vs, the sayde promise doeth nothing perteine vnto vs: but it is made vnto vs, and also we shal enioy the same, so that we giue ourselues to do our due∣tie, and to folowe our vocation, not ventering ourselues further then the same vocation requireth. For after this wee shal shew ourselues to be wise indeede, and in the mids of most horrible tē∣pestes we shalbe preserued, that nothing shal bring vs hurt: albeit that after the sight of the eyes and feeling of the flesh it shal seeme
cleane contrary. For the wise also doe meete with many hinde∣rances, the which were able ynough, not only to make them stū∣ble, but also to fal & perish, if God by his wisedome did not vp∣holde them. The which wisedome he giueth vnto his faithful chil∣dren, and doeth exalt them, so much as he knoweth to be expedi∣ent: howbeit they stumble & do often fal, that they may be war∣ned of their frailtie, and that they may haue their recourse vnto the almighty, who hath made this promise the which hee doeth truely performe, not suffering the fal of the wise to bee mortal. The pathes of man are directed by the Lorde, and his way plea∣seth Psal. 37. 23. him: though he fal, he shal not be cast of▪ For the Lord putteth vnder his hande. 24 If thou sleepest, &c. He proceedeth to declare the com∣modities that the faithful haue in this life by wisedome, and set∣teth here before vs twoo of them: that is to say, the rest, without feare, and the sweete sleepe: of the which commodities the riche worldlings (whose hartes are set on couetousnes) are depri∣ued, being in continual feare of loosing their riches, not seruing God, but their vnsatiable desires: and therefore they haue not the sweete sleepe, but ful of dreames, sorowes and troubles. The fulnesse of the riche wil not suffer him to sleepe. In this promise wee may first of al learne, that it is laweful for a wise and fayth∣ful man to rest and sleepe, but not to giue vnto the fleshe his ease, as doe the vnsatiable and intemperate, which doe bestowe the greatest parte of their tyme in gluttony and in sleepe: but to the ende that taking his rest, hee may be more disposed to serue God and his neighbour according to his vocation. Secondly, that the sleepe is not a thing so natural vnto man, that hee can vse the same at his wil, except GOD of his grace doe giue it him. Wherefore, if wee rest quietly, wee owe thankes vnto GOD therefore: and if wee cannot sleepe at our ase, let vs take heede from beeing grieued, know∣ing that GOD doeth distribute his gifts as seemeth him good, and in the meane whyle, that wee may bee occupied about our vocation, let vs aske of GOD that it woulde please him to giue vs quiet sleepe. It pleaseth him wel that wee aske it: for it
is a parte of our dayly bread, and if hee woulde not that wee shoulde aske it, and that hee woulde not voutsafe to giue it, hee would make vs no promise therof. Thirdly, that the wise haue in this present life so much rest and ease, as is necessary for them: and albeeit that oftentymes they bee greatly troubled, and that after diuerse sortes, knowing that God is their helper: yet they are contented, and say with Da∣uid, I wil lay me downe, and also sleepe in peace: for thou Lorde, Psalm. 4. 8. Psal. 91. 1. only makest me dwel in safetie. 25 Thou shalt not feare for any sodaine feare, nei∣ther for the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh. 26 For the Lorde shalbe for thine assurance, & shall pre∣serue thy foote from taking. For further to admonish the wise and faithful of the blessings that they shal obteine during this life, by giuing themselues vnto wisedome, hee maketh heere a defense the which answereth in e∣gal degree with the promise, and which ought to cause vs to fixe our eyes vpon wisedome, whereby and not otherwayes, wee may bee assured that wee shal not bee beaten downe with the calamities, howe sodaine soeuer they bee: although that beeing mixed amongst the wicked, wee cannot escape but haue our parte of the euils that they suffer, and bee ouerthrowne with them. So∣lomon woulde not haue vs to holde such opinion, & that right∣ly: for sodaine feare is due vnto them that haue not the feare of God, and which without remorse of conscience giue themselues vnto dishonestie for to cōmital filthines with greedines through contempt and disobedience against the woorde of God. Such kind of people doe thinke themselues safe, and doe falsly beleeue that no harme shal come to them: but when they feare nothing, after that God hath deferred their punishment for a time, they finde themselues ouertaken with euils, from the which they cannot e∣scape. This is the sodaine feare, as Solomon doeth declare the same, when hauing forbidden to bee afraide of the sodaine feare, hee addeth, neither for the destruction of the wicked, &c.
The which falleth vppon them vnawares, and when they thinke not of it, and sooner then they woulde. The worlde destroyed by the fludde hath prooued it: so haue the Sodomites and Gomor∣thians, Dathan, Core, and Abyram, with their companie. Contra∣rily, when this destruction came, Noe and his familie, Loth and his daughters, Moses and Aaron were preserued from it: for they were not of the conspiracie of the wicked. Nowe as these same, were deliuered, so Solomon also woulde haue, that al they that through feare of offending God, do giue thēselues vnto wisdom, shoulde bee assured, that the destruction which happeneth vnto the wicked, shal not ouertake them: and albeeit they suffer with them, yet shal they not bee ouercome: for they forese a farre off the destruction to come, because they knowe that God is iust, & that hee cannot alwaies dissemble but at the last wil punishe wic∣kednesse. And also that which the wise and faithful do suffer, they beare it patiently, knowing that they haue wel deserued it: & thus the desolation doeth not turne to their hurt, but to their benefite. Also wee knowe that al things worke together for the best vnto thē that loue God. Those that were among the Iewes elected, did Rom. 8. 2. wel vnderstand this: for it was also foretolde them by the Pro∣phetes long tyme before the captiuitie of Babylon. In folowing the examples of these good olde fathers, let vs not be afrayde for any calamitie that shal happen to the world, although we light on the same, as if it did assault vs vnprouided, and as though we had not foreseene it. For the faithful considering the wickednesses which reigne in the worlde, and that they themselues doe dayly offende, ought to confesse that the roddes are prepared for them, and that the condemnation of the wicked from a long time tarieth 2. Pet. 2. 3. not, and their destruction sleepeth not. To the rest, Solomō would not haue vs to be bold of ourselues, nor trust in our own strēgth▪ Forgiuing a reason for the which we must not feare, hee saith not, for yee are strong and mighty, hardy and couragious: yee knowe the subtilities of Satan and the deuises of the wicked: but he gi∣ueth al the prayse vnto God, as also it is most due vnto him: for hee saith, 26 For the Lorde shall, &c. It is not Solomon onely that affirmeth vnto vs, that God helpeth his faithful seruantes: the
holy scriptures are replenished with such witnesses, and also with examples, whereby wee may wel knowe it. Seeing then that wee haue many witnesses heereof, and that this helpe surmoun∣eth heauenly, earthly and infernall powers, wee must in no wise feare, but holde an inuincible assurance against all the affli∣ctions of the worlde, otherwise wee doe not beleeue that GOD is on our side, and doe belye the Scripture, and doe counte the examples thereof to bee fables: as doe all they which woulde winne paradise by their woorkes and free will. If wee bee assu∣red against sodaine feare and the miseries that happen vnto the wicked, let vs confesse that it commeth of the onely helpe of GOD. By this that Solomon compareth vs vnto beastes, for which men set nettes and snares to take them and kil them, and compareth the sodaine feare, the punishmentes and iudgements of GOD, the which hee prepareth either by men, or by the De∣uils, vnto nettes and snares, when he saith, and shal preserue thy feete: &c. hee doth spoile vs of al strength and power of francke & free wil. For if we coulde deliuer ourselues from the sodaine feare, and from miseries, we shoulde not need to haue GOD to keepe vs: but now if wee be left vnto ourselues, we are like vnto eeble beastes, which runne into the nette, and are taken in the snare, out of the which they cannot escape. This comparison is often vsed in the scripture. Let vs note further, that the woorde which wee haue translated helpe, after the Chaldee interpretour doeth signifie hope and confidence. 27 Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it. But nowe to teache vs mercifulnesse, he giueth vs commande∣ments belonging vnto the seconde table, the which doeth shewe vs, how we shoulde liue with our neighbours, and what duetie we owe vnto them. First of al, hee forbiddeth vs theft; not onely that, for which theeues are punished by the magistrates, but chiefly the same, for which some do esteeme themselues, and would bee accounted of, and also are praised & commended of those that ex∣tol couetousnes, who count it nothing to hurt their neighbours,
so that they may winne by it. The which they doe, when they se that there is no resistance nor power to bee reuenged. There are many kindes of such theeues, the which not only goe vnpunished by men, but honoured: yet notwithstanding seing they bee ful of crueltie, they shoulde not thinke to be exempted from punishe∣ment. For as it is saide, Blessed are the merciful, for they shal ob∣teine Mat. 5. 7. Iam. 2. 13. mercy: so also, cursed are the cruel & vnmerciful, for iudge∣ment without mercy shal fal on him that sheweth no mercy. And in this sorte they shal buy their honours very deere, and it had beene much better for them to haue confessed their fautes, and to be punished in this worlde with shame, then to heare this fearful Mat. 25. 41. sentence, Depart yee cursed from me, &c. Wee say with shame: for sith they say they are Christians, it shoulde bee a foule shame for them to suffer hanging, as is shewed vnto vs by S. Peter. See 1. Pet. 4. 15. that none of you suffer as a murtherer, or theefe, or an euil doer, &c. But wee shal auoide them both, if being merciful and chari∣table, Mat. 7. 12. we doe vnto our neighbours as wee woulde be done vnto: and with holde not the good from the owners thereof. For to per∣forme this wel, it suffiseth not to forsake al euil trades, all vnlaw∣ful and vnreasonable meanes to drawe vnto vs the goods of our neighbour: but wee must renounce al enterprises, purposes & de∣liberatiōs to enriche ourselues with the hinderance of our neigh∣bour, and to doe our duety for to conserue euery man his, and readily to giue the hyreling his wages, & almose vnto the poore, when we haue the goods of this world: for to such kind of people do they also belong, and not onely vnto vs. Therefore vpon wha itle soeuer we possesse them, they are committed vnto vs to dis∣pose them, according as God doth teach vs by his word. Now tha it is needful that wee shoulde with al speede giue the hyreling his wages, we may vnderstand if we conider our owne nature, which is, to bee grieued when men deffer to render that which they owe vnto vs, and chiefly when necessitie pincheth vs. But that we may be further aduertised, Solomon doeth giue vs a commande∣ment therof, saying: 28 Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.
This 2. commandement is plaine, and there is none so dul of vnderstanding but may vnderstand the same, seing hee asketh no∣thing of vs which wee would not haue done to ourselues. Solomon demandeth nothing of vs which passeth the boundes of nature wel gouerned, and also he addeth nothing vnto the law of Moses. For it is said, Thou shalt not steale. again, Thou shalt do no Leui. 19. 11. & 13. wrong vnto thy neighbour, nor poll him. Thou shalt not oppresse an hired seruant that is needy & poore, &c. Thou shalt giue him Deut. 24. 14 his hire for his day, &c. Now if we may not vse such delaies, much lesse may we seeke waies vtterly to depriue our neighbors of that which we owe them. Let vs then take heed wee doe not as those which S. Iames reproueth, saying, For if a brother or a sister be na∣ked & destitute of dayly food, and one of you say vnto them, de∣part in peace: warme yourselues, & fil your bellies, notwithstan∣ding ye giue them not those things which are needful to the bo∣dy, Iam. 2. 19. what helpeth it? For the loue that wee owe vnto our neigh∣bours, is not paide with words. Euen so, whosoeuer shal haue this worlds good, & shal see his brother to stand in neede, & wil shut vp his compassion frō him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him? We must then be readie to pay our debts, & to helpe the necessi∣tie of the poore, otherwise we withhold the good frō the owner therof, and bid them come againe to morow, the which is a dete∣stable theeuerie before God, who can wel punish it, euen as mur∣ther and manslaughter as the scripture witnesseth in diuers pla∣ces: although it be counted but a smal fault before men, who doe pardon great theeues and hang vp the litle ones. 29 Intende none hurt against thy neighbour, seing he doth dwel without feare by thee. For the thirde commandement of mercy, hee sheweth that wee must walke in integritie of harte with our neighbours, and chiefly with those which stande not in doubte nor mistrust vs, otherwise wee deserue greatly to bee blamed of treason, considering that they which dwell and occupie with vs, doe not distrust vs, because outwardly wee shewe them a faire face and smoothe countenance. For none can bee
assured of his neighbour, except hee loue him, and desire his prosperitie. Therefore when wee see that our neighbours doe no feare that wee wil hurte them, let vs not inuent any euill against them, and muchlesse put it in practise, otherwise wee must looke for nothing but a curse: as it is written, hee hath didgged a pit, and made it deepe, and is fallen into it himselfe. Hee that re∣wardeth euil for good, euil shal not departe from his house. And Psal. 7. 15. Prou. 17. 13. albeeit that Solomon doeth not heere make mention but of the deuises that are made against those that thinke themselues to bee at peace and quietnes, and woulde haue vs to abstaine from it, it is not therefore to say, that hee alloweth conspiracies and trea∣sons that are made against enemies: for hee saieth, Say not thou, I wil recompense euil, but waite vpon the Lorde, and hee shal saue Pro. 20. & 25. 2. thee. Againe, If hee that hateth thee, bee hungry, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thirsty, giue him water to drinke. But by forbidding one kinde of treason, hee giueth vs to vnder∣stande that al treasons are euil, and that wee must haue our hartes pure from al euil thoughtes and purposes. And namely hee for∣biddeth to ymagine any thing against him, that so loueth his neighbour, that he hath no euil suspicion of him: for if a man be giuen to ymagine against them that are such, hee wil also yma∣gine against his enemies. And albeit that Ieremie saith, Cursed is Ire. 17. 5▪ the man that putteth his trust in man, &c. it is not to say, that it is vnlawful for a man to trust in his neighbour, when there is per∣ceiued nothing in him but honestie. For as the scripture blameth the trust that is put in man against the word of God, euen so also it commandeth vs, loue, the which beleeueth al, and hopeth al, & indureth al things and thinketh none euil. If then wee loue our 1. Cor. 13. 7. neighbours in whome wee see none euil, wee wil put our trust in them, and wil not feare that they wil do vs wrong, but rather that they wil helpe vs at our neede. This is the trust wherof Solomon heere speaketh, and not the vaine and foolishe trust that one put∣teth in another, & in worldly things forgetting God: as the same which the Iewes had in the helpe of Egipt: and like the same that the Papistes haue in their Saintes and in their merites, and other baggage.
30 Striue not with a man causeles, when hee hath doon thee no harme. For the fourth commandement of mercy, hee woulde haue vs o auoyde contentions, which are fruites of euil thoughts: and chiefly that wee shoulde not striue with him that douteth vs not. For seeing that in not mistrusting vs, hee sheweth vs signe of loue. And againe that wee haue no tryal that hee woulde nor doeth vs any euil, then shoulde we doe him greate iuiury to con∣tende with him. Hee expressely forbiddeth such contentions, be∣cause they are most detestable, both before God, and men which haue any sparke of good feeling: and also because that that man who is wont to striue without cause, wil make no conscience to striue & contend against them which shal something offend him. The which Solomon alloweth not of, as wee haue seene by the witnesses before alleaged. Moreouer our Lorde Iesus Christ, who is the true Solomon, forbiddeth vs al contentions: when hee saith, But I say vnto you, resist not euil: and when hee saieth a little after, Loue your eni∣mies: Mat. 5. 39. Rom. 12. 17. And S. Paul, Recompense to no man euil for euil: by forbid∣ding vs these debates, and commanding vs peace and loue with al men, they adde nothing vnto the lawe, though it bee comman∣ded, hee shal giue life for life. For therein the iudges are taught howe they ought to punishe the offenders, and not howe par∣ticular Exo. 21. 23. Deut. 19. 21. persons shoulde reuenge themselues vpon their enemies, to whome by the lawe they ought to doe wel. If thou meetest with the Oxe of thyne enemie, or his asse going astray, thou shalt bring it home to him. Dauid did wel vnderstande the Exo. 23. 4. 1. Sam. 24. 2▪ same, as it may bee seene in the hunting that Saule made after him. 31 Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither choose any of his wayes. 32 For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous. Forasmuch as they which are voide of mercy, doe shewe vn∣mercifulnesse
and crueltie, wherewith they are ful fraught, giuing themselues to inuent euil against innocentes which distrust them not: and that they which stirre vp strifes without cause against the good, doe florish commonly in the worlde, liuing easily and peaceably, and possessing great riches with honours: and contrarily, they which walke with integritie of hart, which seeke peace, and faine woulde doe wel, doe suffer much miserie, and are contemned of the worlde: for this cause the poore faithful ones are tempted to forget mercie, and to serue the wicked for parte of their prosperitie. There is none so perfite in all the worlde, if so bee it hee fal into affliction, but doeth feele these temptations. And Dauid also doeth acknowledge the same in his owne person, and consequently in the same of all the Psal. 73. 2. faythful, saying, As for mee, my feete were almost gone, my steppes had wel neere slipt: For I fretted at the foolishe, when I sawe the prosperitie of the wicked. Againe, Loe, these are the wic∣ked, yet prosper they alway, and increase in riches. The elect and faithfull ones haue such like temptations: but to the ende that they shoulde take heede from beeing o∣uercome with them, Solomon giueth also the fift commaunde∣ment of mercy: saying, Be not enuious for the wicked man. Ther∣fore if wee wil folowe mercy wee must put far from vs the desires and affections to bee like vnto the enuious man, and the man that suffers himselfe to bee caried about by his lustes, and run∣neth after them with might and maine, and cares not what hee thinketh, or saieth, or doeth, whether right or wrong, so that hee may come to the ende of his enterprises. And because there are some, that make themselues beleeue that they would not bee like the enuious, and yet folowe their manners: to the ende that wee shoulde not deceiue ourselues with them, Solomon doeth warne vs to choose none of their wayes. Whereunto wee must obey, nothing declining from the right way, albeeit wee finde therein great incombrances, and that wee must suffer much euen to the vttermost after the feeling of the flesh. Al those are like vnto these enuious men, which doe choose such kinde of life as bringeth ey∣ther spiritual or temporal hurte vnto their neighbours. To auoide then the calamities of this present life, and to liue easily, wee must
not wander out of the right way, & forsake mercie. And to make vs more willing to obey his commaundement, Solomon doeth bring vs reasons for to feare the enuious, and to comfort the vp∣right, shewing that the wicked cannot long endure, and that the good shal not be alwaies in misery, but that shortly they shalbe de∣liuered therefrom. The first reason is: For the frowarde, &c. Hee whome before hee called enuious, hee nowe calleth frowarde: because that through his frowardnes wherevnto hee is accustomed, hee goeth backewarde and falleth from the right way: and therefore, albeeit that he esteemeth him∣selfe and is honoured of the worlde, which knoweth not what kinde of people are to bee praised, hee is abhominable before the Lorde, who can surely in due time suppresse his enuiousnes, and cast it farre from him, and depriue him of his helpe, without the which nothing can stande. Thus the enuious which forsake the right way of righteousnesse, shal not endure, but shal goe into destruction. For as wee may see by the holy histories, those which haue beene abhorred of the Lorde for their enuiousnesse and frowardnes, haue not long continued, but haue beene rooted out, euen when they seemed to florish and prosper most: & haue bene rooted out not only by temporal punishment, but also haue recei∣ued Iudg. 3. 2. Pet. 2. . iudgement of eternal fire, and haue beene made example for al them which shoulde liue without reuerence of God. This threatning serueth to feare the enuious and the froward, which haue no reuerence of God, nor mercy towards their neighbours: and also to make them vnexcusable, except they returne vnto re∣pentance. The faithful also ought to tremble at such threate∣ninges, and feare the iudgementes of GOD, seeing that of their corrupt nature they are such, that they cannot of them∣selues but bee in abhomination before GOD, and so go to de∣struction as they deserue. But to the ende that being humbled, & as it were in despayre of themselues, they might take courage, and not remaine vnder the burden of despayre, the holy scrip∣ture for their comfort addeth the promise against the threatning. As also Solomon vseth it to the same purpose: for hauing threat∣ned the frowarde, saying, that they are abhomination before
the Lord, he addeth to comfort the faithful, but the secrete of the Lorde is with the righteous: that is to say, with them who for feare of offending GOD, and for loue they beare vnto their neighbours, doe abstaine from enuiousnesse, and flye from all frowardnesse. Nowe to haue boldnesse to folowe the righteous▪ and to bee stirred to desire the communication and participation of this secrete, wee must vnderstande that this secrete is the couenant of God with his faithful children, whereby hee promi∣seth them to bee their GOD, as it is written, Beholde, the dayes come, saieth the Lorde, that I wil make a newe couenant with the Iere. 31. 31. house of Israel, and with the house of Iudah, &c. Dauid doeth teache vs thus to expounde it, when hee saieth, What man is hee that feareth the Lorde? Hee wil teache him the way that hee shal choose. &c. This secrete then consisteth in this, that God doeth giue vs to knowe his good wil towardes vs, and doeth teache vs his lawe, that beeing assured of his fauour and mercie, wee shoulde giue ourselues to feare and obey him. Nowe this coue∣nant is rightly called a secret▪ For first of al howe wise soeuer wee bee, wee cannot enter into it of ourselues: Iesus Christ doeth witnesse the same, I giue thee thankes, O Father, Lorde of heauen and earth, because thou hast hid these thinges from the Mat. 11. 25. wise men of vnderstanding, and hast opened them to babes. Bles∣sed art thou Symon, the sonne of Iona: for flesh and blood hath not reuealed it vnto thee, but my father which is in heauen. And Mat. 16. 17. . Cor. 2. 6. wee speake wisedome among them that are perfit: not the wise∣dome of this world neither of Princes of this world which come to naught. Secondly the faithful haue no more vnderstanding thereof, then it pleaseth God to reueale vnto them by his holy spirite: and yet what reuelation soeuer they haue thereof, yet haue they no perfit knowledge in this worlde. For wee knowe in parte, and we prophesie in parte: but when that which is perfit, is . Cor. 13. 9. come, then that which is in part, shalbe abolished. 33 The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the righteous. 34 With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.
In this worlde the enuious and the frowarde are blessed, whome Solomon heere calleth wicked, because hee hath neither feare nor reuerence of GOD, nor good affection towardes his neighbours, but suffers himselfe to bee led about of his vnbridled lustes. Such a man is blessed of the worlde, in whose iudgement he florisheth and prospereth: and not only do they thus iudge of him, but also his children, seruants, and housholde, are counted happy, so that there is preasse to speake with him and to serue him and his. But heere at the faithful ought not to bee enuious, nei∣ther to desire to bee in such estimation, nor to haue such prayse, knowing that such thinges cannot continue, but fal to decay. For the curse of the Lorde, the which destroyeth whatsoeuer com∣meth against it, is in the house of the wicked, to spare neither him nor his familie, that foloweth his trade. I say expressedly which follow his trade: for if the wicked man beget a sonne, that seeth al Eze. 18. his fathers sinnes which hee hath done, and feareth, neither doth the like, &c. hee shal not dye in the iniquitie of his father, but hee shal surely liue. Let vs not therefore enuie the worldly bles∣sing, but let vs desire the blessing of God: whereof if wee wil bee assured, let vs forsake enuiousnesse, frowardnesse and al wicked∣nesse, and giue ourselues vnto righteousnesse, staying ourselues vpon the grace and mercy of GOD by fayth, and framing our liues according to his holy woorde, exercising vnfaigned charitie one of vs towardes another. And if for thus doing we be accur∣sed of the worlde, let vs reioyce: as S. Luke teacheth vs, blessed are ye when men hate you, &c. Reioyce yee in that day, and bee Luke. 6. 22. glad: for beholde, your rewarde is great in heauen. This rewarde is the blessing of the Lorde, that Solomon promiseth vnto the righteouse, when hee saieth, but hee blesseth the habitation of the righteous. For mainteyning them in this earthly mansion, & giuing them ynough of al thinges and wherewith they are con∣tented, though they suffer much: yet finally hee giueth them the perfection of al blessednesse, that is to say, the kingdome of heauen. And albeeit that nothing doeth prosper nor increase, nor growe without the blessing of God: yet is it not to say, that they which haue greate aboundance of worldly riches, are blessed of od▪ For it is sayde, Wo be to you, yee riche, for you haue your Luke. 6. 2▪
consolation heere. They vsurpe the things that are blessed of God for the vse of the faithful, & yet are they cursed of God, and are neuer the better for al their wealth. For what shal it profit a man, though he shoulde winne the whole worlde, if he loose his owne Matth. 16. soule? The thirde reason is: With the skorneful he skorneth, &c. It seemeth wel vnto the enuious frowarde, and wicked that they shal finishe their enter∣prise, & enioy their desires: & because they esteeme that there is none other felicitie then that which they see with theit eyes, they make no conscience to abounde in al iniquitie: and what exhorta∣tions soeuer they heare in the name of God, yet make they no account thereof. And this is the cause why the scripture calleth them skorners: but as they skorne, so also God mocketh them. For asmuch as naturally wee bee al skorners, wee ought to tremble at this threatning, and not to harden ourselues against it, but hum∣bly Prou. 1. 26. to confesse our faultes, and to aske pardon: and in steede to bee skorned as wee deserue, wee shal please God: as Solomon doeth promise vs, saying, but he giueth grace vnto the humble. S. Peter exhorteth vs to learne this humilitie, Decke yourselues . Pet. 5. 5. inwardly with lowlinesse of minde: for GOD resisteth the proude, and giueth grace vnto the humble. Hereby wee do learne that the skorners and proude persons are al of one order: and whosoeuer skorneth, is proude. The contraritie of humble∣nesse doeth shewe it: likewise doeth the threatening made by Solomon and by Saint Peter. Of these three reasons Solomon maketh a conclusion for the comforte of the faythful and confusi∣on of the wicked, saying: 35 The wise shal inherite glory: but fooles dishonor, though they be exalted. This conclusion agreeth very wel with the former reasons: for fith that God reuealeth his secretes vnto the righteours, giuing them grace to follow his commandementes, and to be assured of his mercy, and that he blesseth the righteous, giuing them ynough and contentation, & also helpeth and receiueth vnto himselfe the humble which are forsaken of the worlde, and counted as filth, it
foloweth right wel that the wise which are wel learned in the schoole house of God, whome before he hath called right, iust, & humble, shalbe honoured for euer, as Solomon doeth signifie, say∣ing, they shal inherite honour. For sith they bee contemned and slandered in the worlde, and yet do inherite honour, it foloweth that it commeth from God who hath the power to vphold them, and indeed wil defende them: for he is faythful and constant, and changeth not, but bringeth that to perfection which hee hath be∣gun. The giftes and vocation of God are without repentance. Rom. 11. 29. And forasmuch as the wise shal inherite honour, and yet haue no certaine abiding place in this world, wee must vnderstand that the ful possession of this honour, is in the kingdome of heauen in e∣uerlasting life. Therefore to obteine this honour, let vs giue dli∣gent eare vnto wisedome, wherby we may walke the right waies Rom. 2. 7. with the iust and humble. Let vs not enuie the foolishe, who the more they are giuen vnto abhominable things before God & his faithful, doe the more commend themselues, and would be had in admiration, & feare. This is it that Solomon signifieth saying, but fooles dishonour, though they bee exalted: for they delight in their enuiousnes, frowardnesse, wickednesse, and skorning, for the which they are set at naught both before God and his elect. Heereby we may vnderstande that there are many fooles in the worlde, yea euen where the Gospel is preached.
The fourth Chapter. 1 HEare, O ye children, the instruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderstanding. 2 For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forsake yee not my lawe. SOlomon yeeldeth himselfe vnto our rudenes, as a father vnto the weakenesse, slownes, and forget∣fulnes Chap. 1. 8. &. 2. 1. &. 3. 1 of his childe. He repeateth againe the selfe same exhortati∣ons that hee hath made vs heere∣tofore. And in steede that wee well deserue to bee sharply re∣prooued; hee calleth vs chil∣dren: and in place for to threa∣ten vs as a iudge, hee calleth vs to heare the instruction of the Fa∣ther of spirits, to the ende that wee being made attentiue hearers thereof, might bee deliuered from ignorance, and should knowe what wee ought to learne, and what is profitable for the health of our soules: hee giues vs the reason for the which wee shoulde be moued to heare, and become diligent. For I doe giue you, &c. By this reason hee woulde haue vs to knowe that al doctrine which doeth turne vs from the lawe of GOD, is nought, vnprofitable and hurtful: and therefore wee shoulde not desire to bee instructed in any other doctrine then the same that our heauenly Father giueth vs, the which onely is good as hee alone is good. This doctrine is none other thing then his lawe, the which in no wise ought to bee despised, as hee sheweth vs, when hee concludeth, therefore forsake yee not my lawe. Hee speaketh heere, in the name and in the autoritie of
God, whose seruant hee was, and committed to instruct his peo∣ple: and therfore he affirmeth that his doctrine is good, and that it is the lawe of God: and therfore also are bounde to heare his instruction, and to learne the knowledge that hee teacheth vs. Heerein he sheweth vnto the ministers, what they ought to bring vnto the people: that is to say, the pure woorde of God inspired from God by the scripture, the which is profitable to teache, &c. 2. Tim. 3. 16 It is the instruction of our father, it is the learning whereunto al men ought to apply their mindes, to obteine the true knowledge. It is the doctrine which is profitable & necessary for vs, it is the lawe of God, which we should neuer forsake, but continually to be exercised therein. In the which also he teacheth the people how to behaue themselues. First of al, that they should heare for to be instructed, not by men, but by our heauēly father, who is the only teacher: for mē which speake, are but his organes & instruments. Secōdly, that they ought to be attētiue & giue diligent heed, that they may be deliuered out of the dūgeon of ignorance, to receiue light for to learne the true knowledge. Thirdly, that they shoulde confesse the goodnes and faithfulnes of God, who wil not suffer them to be deceiued with fables and lyes, with vaine and fruteles doctrines: but doeth offer and set before them, the wholesome doctrine of his lawe, of his Prophetes, and of his Gospel: the which as hee freely vouchsafeth to giue vs, so shoulde we againe willingly receiue the same with faith and obedience. Fourthly, that they shoulde not be negligent to doe wel as the lawe com∣mandeth. And in this manner wee shoulde apply our hartes and bodies vnto the seruice of our God, as hee requireth: and so wee shal not receiue the preaching of the woorde of GOD in vaine, no to our condemnation, as they that doe come to heare but for order and fashion sake, &c. And to the end that none should doute of his doctrine, and that they shoulde not bee grieued as with an heauie and hard burthen to beare, he sheweth of whome he learned it, and at what age. 3 For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the sight of my mother.
4 When hee taught mee, and saide vnto me, let thine hart holde fast my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou shalt lie. King Dauid the Prophet, was the father of Solomon, who was indued with the holie Ghost, wherby he did, said, and taught such things as were acceptable before God, and profitable for his fami∣lie, & for al the people that were committed vnto his charge. Now albeit that Dauid had many children, yet Solomon speaketh of himself as if he had beene the only sonne of Dauid: for hee saieth not, we were many children of one father: but he saith, I was my fathers sonne. It may be said that it is, because that Dauid shewed greater signes of loue vnto Solomō, then vnto his other childrē, & exalted him aboue the rest, making him King in his place. His mo∣thers name was Bersabee, by whome he remained the only sonne of his father: for he that was borne in adulterie, was dead: and the scripture maketh no mention that shee had any afterwardes: and whiles his father and mother liued, hee was yet ender, and 1. Chro. 13. 5. & 29. 1. was not yet come vnto mans age. Againe, also it may bee saide that Solomon was tender and deere, and his mothers only sonne, because she loued him tenderly and with a singular loue, as shee sheweth. But by the first exposition wee learne that Solomon whiles he was tender and yong, did not runne from his father and mother, to worke wickednes and to giue himselfe vnto follie, and vanitie, as the youth at these daies, but was readie at hand to obey them, as he declareth it, when hee saith, that hee was his fathers sonne, & tender & deere before his mother. For when hee thus speaketh, he giueth to vnderstande that his father & mother wer wel pleased with him, and also endeuoured to please them. Other∣wise hee coulde not haue truly reioyced that hee was his fathers sonne, &c. For hee that trulie confesseth his parents, hee loueth their presence for to obey and honour them. We learne, I say, that the fathers and mothers ought to be careful and diligent so to go∣uerne their children, that they should not be gadders abrode, but be readie to come before them, so often as need shal require, to do  kinde of dueties, and not to runne abroade after foolishnes and
vanitie. We learne also that wee should not fly from the preen of GOD, our only father, to turne away from his woorde, the which teacheth vs to giue vnto him al honour and obedience, & assure ourselues that we doe please him. Contrarily, wee de∣cline from his instruction and forsake his lawe: wherein wee shewe ourselues strangers and bastards, and cannot truly reioyce that we are of his houshold and his children. But not to flye the presence of our father, it behoueth vs to be in the company of our mother the Church, that we do often resort vnto the holy assem∣blies, wherein the Gospel is preached vnto vs, by the which we all beholde as in a mirrour the glorie of the Lord with open face. So∣lomon being yet tender, and not running from the presence of his 2. Cor 3. 18. father and his mother, but being obedient vnto them, was taught by his father in the worde of the Lord, the which he himself wit∣nesseth, saying, 4 When he taught me, &c. The youthes which make no account of instruction, but doe hate correction and admonition, and also giering and skorning all discipline and religion, saying they are too yong to becom wise, cānot, I say, truly boast that they haue bin instructed of their fathers, as doeth Solomon: for none can be taught, except he become willing to learne, and cannot by their example induce others to heare good instruction, as doeth Solomon, when he saith that his father hath taught him: as though he did say, when I exhorte you to heare the instruction of your father, I lay no more vpon you then I my selfe haue borne whiles I was yet yong. Nowe Dauid for to haue his sonne Solomon wel taught, committed him into the handes of Nathan the Prophet. The lesson that Dauid giueth to his sonne is, that hee saieth vn∣to 2▪ Sam. 12. 2▪ him, Let thine harte holde fast my woordes, keepe my com∣mandements. Heere we learne that wee ought in no wise to doute of the instruction & doctrine of Solomon, & we may iudge that he doth not teache vs any other thing then the same that he had learned of his father, who was a Prophet: and also (as hath beene said before) he set him to schoole with the Prophet Nathan. For albeit that Dauid calleth the doctrine & instruction which hee gi∣ueth to his son, his words & cōmādemēts, yet it is not to say, they
are the commaundementes and woordes of any other but of GOD. But it is the phrase of the scripture, that it attributeth vnto the Doctours that which they teache, because they are the Organes and instrumentes of GOD, by whome hee com∣municateth his woorde vnto vs, and giueth vs his commande∣mentes. Wee see that GOD saieth to Moses, Commande the children of Israel: and againe, that Moses commaundeth the peo∣ple to keepe his woordes: and also God reprooueth his people, for that they woulde not heare the woordes of his Prophets, &c. Wee learne also that it belongeth to fathers and mothers, to go∣uernours and pastours of the Church to command, and that they ought to be obeyed when they command in the name of God and by his word. And that the wordes of Dauid and his commaunde∣ments come not from him, but from God, Solomon doth declare, when he saith that his father addeth vnto his commandementes, and thou shalt liue: the which is a promise wherby we do not ob∣teine the reward for obeying the commandementes of men, but those of God, &c. Moreouer, let vs note that if wee wil liue, wee must giue our hartes wholy vnto the wordes which are declared vnto vs in the name of God, and outwardly to doe as they com∣mande vs. 5 Get wisedome: get vnderstanding: forget not neither de∣cline from the wordes of my mouth. 6 Forsake her not, and she shal keepe thee, loue her, & shee shal preserue thee. He sheweth vs louingly that he would not haue vs to languish & pine away through need and want, or be hurt, but would haue vs take and make our profit: so that wee shoulde bee more riche then the worldlings which abounde in al wordly wealth: for bles∣sed is the man that findeth wisedome, and the man that getteth Prou. 3. 13. vnderstanding: and therfore this possession cannot bee gotten by any thing of this worlde, howe precious soeuer it is, but com∣meth by free gift. For the Lord giueth wisdome, out of his mouth cometh knowledge and vnderstanding. And although it is giuen, Pro. 2. 6. yet the negligent and slouthful do not possesse her, but those that
watche and seeke her with al diligence. For if thou callest after knowledge, & criest for vnderstanding, &c. This care & diligēce Pro. 2. 3. is heere briefly noted, when Solomon saieth, Forget not, &c. Therefore if wee woulde gladly get and possesse wisedome and vnderstanding, wee must haue the woorde of GOD printed in our hartes, not turning ourselues away from the sermons which are made vnto vs out of the same by the ministers and Pa∣stours which are as the mouth of God, when they doe faithfully exercise their office. In this sorte wee shal get wisedome and vn∣derstanding without any exchange or cost, and without our de∣sertes, trauaile and diligence. For this getting and possessing is not like vnto the earthly and temporal possessions, the which re∣quireth exchange, or seruice, or paine. Wherefore it may seeme that Solomon hath spoken vnproperly, when hee exhorteth vs to get wisedome, the which wee must receiue from the onely goodnesse and free gift of God: and that hee ought rather to haue exhorted vs to aske it of God. But when hee speaketh thus vnproperly against the vse and custome of the worlde, hee speaketh the propre speeche of the spirite of GOD who giueth testimony to the faithful that the goodnes of their Father is so great, that therby he imputeth for getting & possessing, that which he freely giueth of his meere liberalitie, & would that we should possesse it vppon that tittle: prouided that wee receiue the same with thankes giuing, and also that wee take and receiue the gift of GOD with such reuerence and estimation, that wee neuer let it slippe, but diligently and carefully, keepe it, as a precious thing, of greate value, and very necessary for our preseruation and saue∣garde. Solomon so vnderstoode it, as hee wel sheweth by the ad∣monition folowing, saying. 6 Forsake her not, &c. This exhortation ought to bee highly esteemed of vs, when not onely thereby wee are aduerti∣sed not to bee so foolishe, as to let wisedome escape, when the Lorde setteth before vs the getting thereof: but also that it is  promise of warrantie and sauegarde, which is this, that by the possession and reteyning of wisedome, wee shoulde haue no inderance, but shalbe preserued from al hurte: as hath beene expounded, When wisedome, &c. Wherein we may learne Pro. 2. 10.
that this getting ought to be highly desired of vs aboue al world∣ly gettings, that costeth much, and are not alwayes sure, fith this same commeth freely, and remaineth sure: for it is giuen by such a Lord as is able to mainteine his gift, and also both wil and doeth. We may also vnderstand that the possession thereof ought not to be despised, but shoulde by al meanes possible bee mainteined & defended. For if wee labour to keepe the possession of earthly goods, for the which some are often times in danger of their per∣sons, much more by reason wee may not let wisedome goe, but with great loue and affection keepe possession: seeing that we are so farre from danger for possessing thereof, that rather it keepeth and preserueth vs from al euilles. For albeeit that they which are godly wise, doe suffer many miseries and aduersities, both spiritu∣al and corporal: yet doe they neuer perish thereby, but doe ouer∣come through the wisedome that GOD giueth them. Though their flesh, the deuil and the worlde doe tempt and assault them, yet are they not caried away by temptation: for God is faythful, who wil not suffer them to bee tempted aboue their strength. Though the worlde, the wicked and infidels doe persecute them, 1. Cor. 10. 13. yet are they not ouercome▪ for they feare not them that can kil the body, knowing that one hayre of their head shal not perishe▪ In Luk. 21. 19. which dooing they mainteine and possesse their life by their pa∣tience. Though pouertie or sicknes doe pinche them, yet are they Mat. 6. 26. not discouraged, neither care one whit, knowing that God fee∣deth the birdes of heauen. They are contented with their dayly bread, the which neuer faileth, what scarcitie soeuer they abide: & albeeit that through sicknes they loose their taste and stomacke, after the feeling of the fleshe, yet the Lorde who hath comman∣ded them to aske, Giue vs this day our dayly bread, wil not for∣sake Psal. 34. 21. &. 37. 17. Heb. 13. 5. them. Let your conuersation be without couetousnes, and be content with those things that ye haue, I wil not faile thee, neither forsake thee. 7 Wisedome is the beginning: get wisedom therfore: & a∣boue al thy possession, get vnderstanding. 8 Exalt her, and she shal exat thee: she shal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.
9 Shee shal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, shee shal giue thee a Crowne of glorie. Although we confesse that wisedome is a most excellent acqui∣sition or getting, the which wee ought so muche to loue, that wee should neuer forsake her; and that we confesse, it is right & good for our profite, that Solomon calleth vs vnto this getting; yet doe we not desire it, neither aspire after it, as wee ought, but doe set it at naught, by preferring the wisedome of this world, and the lusts of the fleshe before it: the which is a turning of our backe vnto God, when wee make no account of his Word, but labour to fill our houses with riches, howe so euer they be gotten, so that wee may obteine our purpose: and doe persuade men to beleeue that when we haue wel filled our houses, and haue gotten great gaines and riches, that wee shal come time enough at last for to learne wisedome, and to feare and worship God: and which worst is, we persuade ourselues that it is not needfull to trouble our brain about marking what is preached, for to refourme our liues after that which is taught vs: but that it is enough to giue a good gaspe when wee dye. Beholde how the loue of our fleshe doeth drawe vs away, and the wisedome of this worlde deceiueth vs. To the which abuse Solomon willing to giue a remedie, and to other abu∣ses also, doeth teach vs that in all thinges wee must begin by wis∣dom, & that for this cause he hath called vs, and stil presently cal∣leth to get wisedome, and woulde haue vs with all our heartes to folowe this gaines, and that we should prefer it before al worldly gettings: so that the same should please vs, and we also contented therewith: for truely, whatsoeuer is precious in the iudgement of the world, and al whatsoeuer men doe delight in, is nothing in comparison of this wisedome and knowledge. But for al Solomons exhortation, and for al the reason that may be alledged, yet men are flesh, & doe esteeme the things that the flesh desireth. A sen∣sual man loueth to be honoured, and had in estimation: and be∣cause he seeth that rich men are honored, & commended & pray∣sed, & that euery man desireth to feast them, he imputeth the same vnto the riches: & therfore, to attaine vnto honor, & to be wel∣comed of the world, he studieth to get temporal & earthly goods.
Solomon would not haue vs remaine in this errour, wherewith wee are naturally infected: and therefore, hee teacheth vs by what meanes wee may come vnto honour: when he sayeth, 8 Exalt her, &c. Therefore if we wil come to honour, we must exalt and embrace Wisedome. But it wil be said, Forasmuch as the Lorde by Wisdome hath lay de the foundation of the earth, Pro 3. 19. and hath stablished the heauens through vnderstanding: that is foloweth, that Wisedome is exalted enough. Wherefore it might seeme, that in vaine Solomon doth exhort vs to exalt and embrace it, and that it is past our reache to doe it. I answere, Euen as when we pray that Gods name may be sanctified, wee doe not meane, that the glorie of God can either encrease, or decrease of it selfe: but wee aske, that his glorie shoulde be manifested as it ought, & whatsoeuer God doeth, that al his workes may appeare glorious, as they are: so that on all sides he may be glorified. Euen so, when Solomon woulde haue vs to exalt and magnifie Wisedome, hee meaneth not that wee can giue her greater honour, and place her in higher degree then shee is in, of herselfe: but his desire is, that wee shoulde haue her in good estimation, and that wee shoulde make great account of her, and that so muche as in vs lyeth, she shoulde bee exalted, praised, and magnified of all persons, as it be∣hooueth. Also when hee woulde haue vs to embrace it, hee mea∣neth not that we can receiue, hold and keepe it duely as we ought to doe: but that wee shoulde so set our affection on her, that we shoulde neuer let her escape, and that we shoulde not let it slippe out of our heartes, but rather that through the great loue that we ought to beare vnto this Wisedome, we should stirre vp others to desire and to loue her. Wee may vnderstand that this is the mea∣ning of Solomon by his exhortation. For when after his admoni∣tions hee exhorteth vs to exalt and embrace his Wisdome it, is as muche as if hee did say, If thou gettest Wisedome, thou doest exalt and magnifie her, and shewest thy self to beare a good minde vnto her, and doest embrace her. This is that, which Solomon ment by this exhortation, Exalt her, &c. Whom we shal not need to obey for naught, but shalbe wel rewarded: for as hee doeth promise vs, shee will also exalt and glorifie vs. But Solomon
not content with this declaration, addeth thereto an other, saying, 9 Shee shal giue, &c. Solomon doeth heere declare howe Wisedome doeth exalt them which magnifie her, and howe shee glorifieth them which embrace her: the which he doth by a simi∣litude taken of the doings of Kings and great Princes, which doe exalte them to honour and glorie, which doe honour them, see∣king the profite and preseruation of their persons and kingdomes: As Pharao tooke the ring from of his finger, and put the same on Gen. 41. 42. Hest. 8. 15. Iosephes hande: And Mardocheus departed from the king in roy∣all apparel of blewe, and white, and with a great Crowne of gold, &c: or els the similitude is taken of the reward that is giuen vnto them which fight and runne at tilte. For he that fighteth and run∣neth 2. Sam. 5. 8. 1. Cor. 9. 24. 2. Tim. 2. 5. best, getteth the Crowne. How so euer it is taken, this decla∣ration hath two partes, whereof the seconde doeth expounde the first: for the increase of grace, is a Crowne of glorie, the which is giuen vnto the wise of this life, after two sortes. For first of all, they are praysed and honoured so of God, that hee causeth the worlde to wonder at them: albeit that the foolishe and scorners doe persecute and refuse them, but yet against their conscience, whereby they are conuinced that they doe naughtily. Secondly, by Fayth and hope, they haue eternall life, which is the Crowne of glorie, which in the ende they shal wholly and fully possesse, wherevpon they may say, A Crowne of righteousnes is kepte for 2. Tim. 4. 8. mee, &c. The persecutions of this worlde shal not depriue vs of this Crowne: but contrarily, Blessed is the man that abideth temptation: for when hee hath beene tried, hee shall receiue the Iam. 1. 12. Crowne of life. 10 Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life shalbe many. Solomon doeth often repeate vnto vs one lesson, as they can tell that heare or reade his doctrine: and this is to helpe the ig∣norance of those which haue a good wil to learne and to become obedient. For because of the corruption of our fleshe, we are verie Rom. 8. 7. dull to receiue and retaine good doctrine; and the affection ther∣of, which is enimitie against God, prouoketh vs to rebellion:
for it is not subiect vnto the lawe of GOD, neither can bee. Vnto the which fleshe wee must not consent, except wee wil bee vnexcusable. For as the repetitions of al one doctrine, serue for the ease of them which become willing to learne, so also they serue to make the carelesse and rebels vnexcusable. And albeit that the Word is not directed, but vnto the children of God: yet it ceaseth not to sound in the eares of strangers which are mingled with the houshold of God: but because they heare it with contempt, as they declare by not receiuing the same with fayth and obedience: for this cause it serueth vnto their condemnation of death: Con∣trarily, vnto them that receiue it, to them shee is as life. Solo∣mon doeth so affirme, when hee sayeth to his Sonne, that his wordes shal increase the yeares of his life. If then wee desire long life, let vs yeelde ourselues willingly to learne, and diligently to heare the preaching of the Word: let vs submit ourselues ther∣vnto with true obedience, labouring to perfourme that which it commaundeth vs by reuerence that we beare vnto God, who is our Father, and through feare that wee haue to disobey him. In this sort our yeares shalbe prolonged: not that we can liue in this worlde beyonde the terme that God hath ordeined from euerla∣sting: but howe short so euer our life is, it shalbe so long as is ex∣pedient for the saluation of our soules: as also wee will content ourselues therewith, knowing that by temporal death, our yeares are not shortened, but that wee shal enter into the true length of life, for the same shalbe without ende. Wee shewe right wel that wee beleeue not Solomon, or that wee make no great accounte of life. There are not many which giue eare vnto the Worde of life, & yet lesse that receiue it. In so doing, we declare vs to be folish, and that we make no count to come vnto Wisedome, wherevnto the wiseman laboureth to bring vs by his wordes, as he sheweth, saying, 11 I haue taught thee in the way of VVisdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteousnes: 12 VVhen thou goest, thy gate shal not be straight, & whē thou runnest, thou shalt not fall. 13 Take hold of instruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for shee is thy life. When Solomon declareth that by his wordes he leadeth men
to Wisedome, and that hee guideth them the right way vnto life, then he reprooueth those of folishnesse, & condemneth them vn∣to death, which wil not heare & receiue his words: and therewith he sheweth what is the office of fathers vnto their children: that is, they should not mainteine them in vaine foolish thinges: but in al Wisdome, that they may say with Solomon, I haue taught thee, &c. Likewise the dutie of children, is, to be willing to learne, and to folow the Wisedome and righteousnes that their Fathers, Superiours, and Teachers shal teach them by the Worde of God. But as it is verie harde to finde many Parents which doe teache wisedome and righteousnes, (for the most parte careth not what becomes of their children, so that they spende not their goods) so also the greatest parte of the worlde which are the youth, are the worst ruled, in such wise that they care not what they doe, so that they may liue at ease. And therfore, albeit that we haue the Word of God daily preached vnto vs, the which is the way of wisdome and righteousnes, yet is it verie hard to persuade many that they are rebels against the Word, and that the way hath beene taught them, &c. After the meaning of Solomon, which speaketh vnto o∣bedient children: for none but they doe truely receiue the way of wisdome, and walke in the pathes of righteousnes. That Solomon doeth direct his words vnto these, we may vnderstand by the pro∣mise folowing, when he sayeth, 12 VVhen thou goest, &c. This promise can not appertaine to the foolish & scorners, neither vnto the wicked and dissolute: Pro. 1. 26. & 2. 22. & 3. 32. Psal. 37. but contrarily, they are threatened with sorow & affliction, with miseries and calamities, with desolation & destruction: but it be∣longeth vnto the wise and righteous. And forasmuch as Solomon doeth apply it vnto them to whome hee did direct his former affir∣mation, saying, I haue taught thee, &c. It foloweth right wel, that he speake not vnto the foolishe & disobedient, but to those which through loue of wisedome & righteousnes, doe heare and receiue his words. If we would then be exempted from sorow & distresse, and to be at libertie with ease, as Solomon doeth promise, saying, VVhen thou goest, &c: If wee would auoide desolation and de∣structiō, and dwel surely and safely, we must haue al our thoughts & purposes, & al our sayings & doings, (the which are our wayes & paths) to be taught by wisdō, & gouerned by righteousnes, &c.
But though that Solomon hath directed himselfe to the wise and righteous, making them this affirmation, adding thereto the pro∣mise: yet are we neuer so wise and wel ruled, but that wee haue neede to bee admonished not to forsake the way that hath beene taught vs: neither are wee alwayes so assured of the promises that are made vs by the Worde of God, but that we haue neede to be exhorted and called vpon to receiue his admonitions, and not to forsake them, promising vs that we shal liue: for he saieth, Take holde of instruction: This verse hath alreadie bene expounded in this same Chapter in the tenth verse. 14 Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men. 15 Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and passe by. 16 For they can not sleepe, except they haue done euil, and their sleepe departeth, excepte they cause some to fall. 17 For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence. The waye of the wicked is to be giuen to doe hurt vnto their neighbours without cause, the which is a most wicked custome Pro. 1. 10. and maner of doing: therefore Solomon hath exhorted vs in the 15. verse, Walke not in the wayes with them, &c. Likewise one of their wayes is to loue foolishnes. Wherfore if we enter into their pathes, then doe we not walke in the way of Wisedome: wher∣of it foloweth, that we fall into the straight and distresse, and light vpon destruction, and so runne vnto death. For life, standeth on∣ly in the way of Wisedome and righteousnes, in the which for to preserue vs, Solomon is not satisfied with the aduertisementes that he hath giuen: but againe hee doeth admonish vs, that in no wise we should folow the cōditions & maners of the wicked. And for to shewe vs that we should be verie careful to take heed from partaking with their doings, it sufficeth him not to haue said, En∣ter not &c. But further to expresse how muche wee ought to ab∣hor & detest the maners of the wicked, & to shun thē, he addeth, 15 Auoide
it, and goe not by it. Forasmuch as the greatest part of the worlde consisteth of the wicked and vngodly, which pro∣sper, and are happy to the sense of the fleshe: therefore the rude, ignorant, and simple, and vndiscreete are tempted to follow them, and count themselues happy, if they may come to bee accounted with them, to be partakers of their prosperitie. Solomon did something touch it before, when he saide, And treade not: hee vseth a worde that signifieth to blesse, or to thinke ones selfe hap∣py: as if hee did say, doe not count thy selfe happy to walke in the wayes of the wicked: for contrarily, blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsell of the wicked. For this cause Solo∣mon Psal. 1. 1. studieth earnestly to beate into vs, & to make vs vnderstād in what horror & execratiō we ought to haue the waies of the wic∣ked: for hauing saide, Enter not, & walke not, he proceedeth yet further, and because of our rudenesse and dulnesse, hee gathereth together many wordes, as Auoide, goe not, turne from it, and passe by. By this heape of wordes hee sheweth wel, that there is great danger of communicating with the wicked and vngodly, & is like as if a man would giue himselfe into the handes of theeues. He compareth a man heere vnto a merchant that sendeth out his seruant, or his sonne laden with golde and siluer, to buie and sell withall, and fearing hee shoulde bee spoyled, and robbed, and slaine by theeues and robbers, warneth him to auoide the suspecte passages, & to turne out of the pathe, til he be past the dangerous way. But besides this, we haue to marke, that if wee communi∣cate with the manners and conditions of the wicked, and thinke ourselues blessed to keepe them company, that then wee are lost: & albeit that in such estate we woulde be aduaunced, and labour to goe forward, yet do we fall backwarde, in steede of gooing for∣warde one step, and become like vnto Creafishes, or Seacrabbes which goe backewarde. There is no going forwarde but in wis∣dome and righteousnesse: for in them, the yeeres of life are pro∣longed, the which is lost through wickednesse and vngodlinesse, and that rightly, as Solomon doeth shewe, alledging the rea∣son wherefore wee shoulde auoide the way of the wicked, say∣ing, 16 For they cannot sleepe. Heereby he sheweth the great de∣sire
that the wicked haue to hurt their neighbours, and too bring them hinderance, when he saith, that they cannot sleepe before they haue executed their displeasure: and therewith hee sheweth, that looke wherein they most delight, that is, to doe euill, euen thereby are they most tormented, seeing they loose their sleepe, Pro. 2. 14 which is one of the chiefest partes of the ease of this life: If thou sleepest, thou shalt not bee afraide. It is then vpon good cause Pro. 3. 24 that Solomon doth admonish vs to auoide the way of the wicked. For sith they are depriued of this gift of this sleepe, that God gi∣ueth to the wise and righteous, and whereby this life is maintei∣ned; it followeth that they cannot remaine long in this worlde, whereof also they are vnworthie: and if they be not worthie of it, so much the lesse are they worthie of eternall life. As then they depriue themselues of sleepe through vehement desire that they haue to do euill, the which they neuer obteine: so also they can∣not be partakers of eternall rest, but are sent downe deepe into darkenesse, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. If then wee communicate with them, after we haue been in distresse, wee shall fal into destruction. Wherfore we must take heede from hur∣ting of our neighbors, and to worke their destruction, & we shalbe preserued from damnation: after this reason, hee giueth vs yet another why we ought to shunne the way of the wicked, saying: 17 For they eate the bread, &c. Forasmuch as there is none but would be counted wise and righteous, therefore to ob∣teine this reputatiō truely, we must abstaine frō al iniurie & vio∣lence, and to doe wrong to no person: the which the wicked in no wise doe: but labouring to liue at ease, they rauish the goodes of their neighbours, by vnlawfull meanes, by lawing, and subtiltie, by force and violence, and thus they eate the bread of wickednesse, Pro. 1. 31 wherevpon their destruction followeth. Wherefore they shal eate of the fruite of their waies, &c. It is thē vpon good cause that So∣lomon hath exhorted vs to eschew their way. It may also be said that he sheweth by this reason, how the wicked doe not sleepe, ex∣cept they haue wrought some euil first. For euen as it is accusto∣med by men to take their meate before sleepe, euen so it followeth (seing they feede themselues with wickednesse and violence, see∣ing they delight to doe wrong to their neighbours and to spoile
them, that doe not sleepe, before they haue doone euill by ouer∣throwing and destroying their neighbours. Furthermore by this reason we may learne to flee farre from the company of these wic∣ked ones, and greatly to feare communicating with them in their meates and drinkes. For as the body is partaker of the nature of meates it receiueth, euen so, if we communicate with the meates and drinkes of wickednesse and violence, wee must needes be∣come wicked and outragious, and haue our heartes and mindes corrupted, wherevpon followeth death &c. 18 But the way of the righteous shineth as the light, that shineth more and more vnto the perfect day. 19 The way of the wicked is as the darkenesse: they knowe not wherein they shal fall. Forasmuch as heere aboue in the 14. and 15. verses, he hath for∣bidden vs to enter into the path of the wicked, and that before in the 11. verse, he hath affirmed that he hath taught vs the way of wisedome, and then in the 12. verse, hath promised vs that when we walke or runne in the way of wisedome, that we shall not bee shut vp in distresse, and that wee shall meete with nothing which may make vs fall to bring vs to destruction: To the intent that we shoulde make no excuse for hauing forsaken this way, because we coulde neither see nor knowe it, he sheweth vs that wee cannot pretend this excuse, for that this way is as cleare as the day at high noone, and that in the same there is nothing darke or mistie, that may hide the same from vs to bee seene and knowne for to be our way. Solomon doth so meane, when he compareth the pathes of the iust man, whom he calleth wise and righteous, vnto a Light. If then we knowe nothing therin, it is not because that the righ∣teous doe not shewe themselues plaine enough by sound doctrine holynesse of life and honest conuersation (for they are the salt of the earth) but because we are either blinde, or els by malice & Matth. 5 enuie do close the eies of our vnderstāding, that we wil not know any thing: but which worst is, there are some which seek by al meanes to quench this light, by blaspheming the holy doctrine, & persecute the professors therof. But wil or nil they the path of
the righteous shall shine, and they that will walke in the same shall reioyce and prosper, the which shall not be taken from them, but rather shal go forward in growing vntil the day be risen in her perfectiō, that is to say, til they haue perfect ioy, & ful blessednes in the kingdom of heauē. In this world this ioy and prosperitie are not perfect, but as the day groweth according too the ascen∣ding of the Sunne, euen so is it needefull that wee shoulde profite 1. Cor. 15. more and more dayly, vntill that all thinges bee fulfilled, and that God be al in all thinges. Besides this, when the pathe of the righ∣teous is saide to be shining, and compared vnto the light of the Sun, we ought to vnderstand, that as a man walking in the bright∣nesse of the day, seeth, and knoweth where hee goeth, and taketh heede from stumbling and falling, euen so also when we walke in the pathes of the righteous, wherein wee are guided by the word Psal. 119. which is a light vnto our feete, wee knowe whither we goe, and are assured not to perishe. They then which are ignorant and applie not their minde to vnderstande the worde, doe not walke in the pathes of the righteous, what faire shewe of holinesse soeuer they pretende outwardly: neither those also which are vn∣certaine whether God doth loue them, & whether hee will saue them or no, doe not walke in the same way, albeit that by straight∣nesse of life they bragge to bee in the state of perfection, the which is not founde but in wisedome, righteousnesse, and true dealing: and thus they faile in two sortes. For first of all, doubting of the loue of GOD, and saying that they are in the state of perfection, they contrary themselues: for it rightwell followeth, that if they bee perfect, that God loueth them, seeing they are such as he com∣mandeth them to be, you shalbe therefore perfect, as your father Mat. 5. 47. which is in heauen is perfect. Secondarily, in that they set per∣fectiō in the obseruing of mans traditions, and diuelish doctrines. The thirde errour may bee added, to bee, in that they boast them∣selues of perfection, of the which the wise, righteous, and faith∣ful, haue but a small beginning in this present life: contrarily they shoulde haue no neede to aske God forgiuenesse for their sinnes, as they are taught of the Lord to doe it. Likewise these proude Matth. 6 persons which boast themselues of the state of perfection, as Monkes, and Nunnes, albeit that with their mouthes they say,
Forgiue vs, yet they thinke not to haue neede of the grace & mer∣cy of God, seeing they make workes of supererogation, as they say, by the which they thinke to merite for other, and chiefly for them that doe well to their Conuent and Cloyster: And if they deserue for other, by a stronger reason for themselues. But as in their state (which they cal of perfection) they perfectly serue the di∣uell, and make them whome they deceiue, to serue him: euen so also they merite to be partakers with the Diuell in eternall dam∣nation, whereunto they drawe them which rather beleeue their lies than the sincere truth of god. Furthermore, when the shining of the path of the righteous is compared vnto the light which go∣eth and glistereth, that is to say, vnto the light which groweth higher and higher: we may not thinke that so soone as wee haue any tast of the Gospel, that by and by wee are in the pathes of the righteous, and that wee must stay there, as if wee were far enough forward. But as the Sunne al waies riseth, till hee come vntoo his perfection: euen so when wee haue once gotten any sauour of the Gospell, we must labour to attaine perfection: wherevnto for Ephe. 4. to bee guided, the Lord in his Church hath appointed workmen. And forasmuch as we must grow vnto perfection, & that by the ministery of the worde, it followeth, wee must not bee greeued though the Ministers ceasse not by diuerse exhortations to open the same vnto vs, but shoulde receiue the same right gladly, and iudge ourselues blessed, for that the Sunne of righteousnesse doth so often visite vs, and shine in our hearts. For if the worldlings are glad to see the Sunne, & do iudge themselues happie when he warmeth the earth in due season, to make it fruitfull: by a stronger reason, the comming of the Sonne of righteousnesse, which ma∣keth vs fruitefull in all goodnesse, righteousnes and trueth, ought right wel to reioyce vs, instructing vs by the example of Dauid, who saith, But Lord, lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vp∣on Psal. 4. 6. vs. But wee cannot bee glad at the comming of this brightnesse, because wee are men, and that wee will not bee reproued though Iohn. 3. 1. Iohn. 1. 5. Ephe. 5. 8. wee bee neuer so faultie, and that our workes bee euill. The light is come into the worlde, but men loued darknesse more than light. Nowe of our owne nature wee loue these darknesses so
much, that we deserue to be called nothing but darkenes. Wher∣fore, if wee would haue true ioy at the comming of this bright∣nesse, we must suppresse our nature, and be regenerated and renu∣ed by the holy Ghost. This is it that Saint Paul commandeth, Let vs cast away the workes of darkenesse, and let vs put on the armour of light. If wee doe thus, it may be saide of vs, Yee were Rom. 3. 12. sometimes darkenesse, but nowe are ye light in the Lorde. But yee brethren, are not in darkenesse, that that day should come vp∣on you as a theefe. Furthermore, seeing that the pathes of the Ephe. 5. 8. 1. Thes. 5. 4. righteous shineth, it followeth that the false Nicodemitans doe not walke therein: for they which walke in the day, desire not to be hid. Much lesse then doe the Papistes walke therein, and these wretched intermistes or newters, which reiect the pure woorde, which is the Sonne that doeth shewe vs this path, and doeth guid vs therin. And seeing that the word is our guide, it is not enough that it be preached vnto vs, but also we must follow it, to be dire∣cted right thereby: as in the night, they which desire to holde the right way, will follow the light going before. 19 The way of the wicked, &c. For to shew & better to point vs the path of the righteous, he setteth the way of the wicked in opposition against it, & cōpareth the same vnto darkenesse, which is contrary vnto light: whereof insueth, that they which walke therin, & they that follow the maners and life of the wicked, nei∣ther see nor know what they doe, and haue no knowledge of wis∣dome, righteousnes nor faithfulnesse. Our Lord doth wel shew it, saiyng: Father forgiue them, for they know not what they do. For Luke. 23. 34 as they that know not how their busines goeth forwarde, cannot reioyce, but are sorrowful and heauie, and thinke themselues in a miserable case: euen so also they which walk in the waies of the wicked, haue no sure ioy, nor stedfast prosperitie: for sith they are in darknesse, they know not where they become. And albeit that in the sight of the eyes, and outwarde appearance, to the sense of the flesh, & iudgement of the worlde, the wicked are they which haue greatest ioy, & that laugh most of all, & doe most inioy the pleasures & lusts of this life, & abound in wealth & riches for the which they are esteemed happy: yet notwithstāding because these things are of no cōtinuance, & that within a while after they feele
great troubles, & sorowes, & that they see thēselues ouerthrowne with the great miseries and calamities (as they are threatened with them heere aboue,) therefore we must not iudge their state and condition to be ioyfull & prosperous: as also our Lord shew∣eth Pro. 1. 26 Luke. 6. them. But seeing the way of the wicked, is, the life they leade, in mannerrs and doings, the which are knowne by their fruites & workes, which are the workes of the flesh, and are wel knowne: Gal. 5. 19. It might be asked in what sort Solomon saith, that their waies are like vnto darkenes? I answere, Albeit the faithful being taught by the worde of God, doe know wel what the workes of the flesh are, wherevnto the wicked consent and obey, following their lustes, and that they know for to flie and abhorre them, & rebuke them, that by their reprehension the wicked might confesse their faultes (as Saint Paul here to doth exhort vs) and haue no felowship with Ephe. 5. 1. the vnfruitful workes of darkenesse, but euen reprooue them ra∣ther, &c: yet neuertheles they are like vnto darkenesse: for most commonly the wicked doe neuer confesse that they doe euil, no more then they which walke by night, knowe whether they goe out of their way or no. And yet let a man bring them light, they are so amazed at times, that they can not discerne where they be: or els, they are so farre out of their way, that they can not tel how to come in againe. Euen so, albeit the wicked are reprooued by their cōsciences, or by the exhortations that are made vnto them out of the worde of God, and so be lightened: yet doe they not know where they are, neither can apply to take the good way. Caine, Pharao, Saule, and Iudas do testifie it, and the wicked now∣adaies doe feele it: and chiefly they to whome God hath sent his woorde, to the end that dayly it may be declared vnto them, doe feele and knowe the euil they doe. But because they haue concei∣ued hatred without cause against them that seeke but their salua∣tion, they are blinde, and cannot get out of this darke way, but from day to day entangle thēselues further therin, & do run into a laberinth wherout they cānot escape. These people & their like thinke thēselues strong & mighty, & they seeme to be wel staied, and that they cannot perishe, because they are enuironned with flatterers which doe commende them, and blesse them, and in the
meane while they knowe not howe they are deceiued, and howe in this sorte they walke in darkenesse, wherethrough they goe to destruction, though they knowe it not: and this is the cause why Solomon saith, That they knowe not where they fall. This falling sometime beginneth in this present life, to wit, when the wicked are so sore affraide that they despaire, as did Caine, and Iudas, or else haue such afflictions which torment them, and cause thē to ac∣knowledge and confesse their wickednesses, for the which they will not, nor cannot repent them. And therefore, they are shut vp into suche a straight, that they knowe not howe to escape: but more and more entangle themselues in dangerous difficulties wherwith at last they are beaten downe and loose their life with∣out knowing what shalbe come of them, sauing that they can not looke but for eternal damnation: or els they thinke it stands with them after this life, as with a beast when it is dead. Pharao, the persecuter of the children of Israel, and Saul of Dauid, haue thus Matth. 24. Luke. 16. 2. Pet. 2. fallen. It happeneth also, that the falling is so sodeine, that they perceiue it not in this life, but comming vpon them vnlooked for, it rauisheth & violently taketh away the wicked euen in the midst of their iollitie. The world destroyed by the flood hath so prooued it. Likewise did the Sodomites & Gomorrhians: & the rich glut∣ton also. All these people are set foorth by the Scriptures, for ex∣amples of eternall fal to them which shal worke wickednes: & the faithful hearing these things, ought to tremble & feare, not for to dispaire and distrust the goodnes of GOD, but that with al humblenesse they shoulde confesse their miserie and corruption, and that they shoulde promise themselues nothing; but might knowe that if GOD woulde execute his wrath against them, as they do deserue, they were vndone: & for that that they remaine and doe not perish, it commeth from the working of the good wil of God. So make an ende of your owne saluation with feare and Phi. 6. 12. 1. Cor. 10. 6. trembling. Nowe these are examples to vs, &c. Moreouer wee may note in the Antithesis & opposition that Solomon maketh betweene the pathes of the righteous and the waies of the wicked, that albeeit the wicked doe reioyce in their wickednes, & would be seene, & indeed shewe themselues to bee praised for their doings, yet neuertheles their way ceaseth not t
be like vnto darknesse: for they hide themselues, insomuch as they wil not be knowne such as they bee indeede, but wil be counted men ful of honestie, as they bragge with open mouth, but often∣times against their conscience, which condēneth them, frō whence 1 Pet. 5. 5. Iam. 4. 6. also oftentimes commeth their fall: For God resisteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble and lowly. Contrarily, although the righteous, following the commandements of our Lorde, doe Mat. 6. 1. not their workes before men for to bee seene of them: yet not∣withstanding their pathes ceasseth not to bee cleare as the light: Mat. 5. 16. for after the commandement, their light shineth before men, not onely before the good, but also amongest the wicked, amongest whome Saint Paul woulde haue vs to liue without reproche: As S. Peter also, saying, Dearely beloued, I beseech you, as strangers & Phi. 2. 15. 1. Pet. 2. 11 pilgrimes, abstaine from fleshly lustes, &c. For though the wicked doe blame the righteous, and persecute them as euil doers, yet can they not say, but that they doe against their owne conscience, as they are oftentimes compelled to confesse it. 20 My sonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my sayings. 21 Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart. 22 For they are life vnto those that finde them, & health vnto all their flesh. When Solomon doth continue speaking so gently, and is not weeried with often exhorting vs one thing, and that he is not sa∣tisfied that we should apply one part of our wittes onely vnto his exhortations, but woulde, and craueth of vs to giue ourselues wholy with constancie and perseuerance, he doeth therein teache such as are ministers of his worde, howe they ought to behaue themselues towardes them they teache. First of al, except they knowe them to be desperate, indurate and obstinate, mockers and scorners of good counsel, holy exhortations, and wholesome cor∣rections, persecutours of the trueth, and of the louers thereof, they ought to speake louingly, as the father doth to his sonne. Secōdly, as though through weakenes and dulnes they had not wel vnder∣stoode
and borne away the former instructions, let them begin to preach the same again vnto their hearers, not twice, but thrice, yea foure times, and more oftener, if neede require: let them not waxe weary of admonishing one thing often. Thirdly, let them la∣bour to vse such vehemencie, that they may not onely awake vpp their corporal eares, but also stirre vp al the senses of man to vnder∣stand, receiue & keepe their exhortations, for to go forward con∣stantly in them, & in no wise to forget them. Hee also giueth a lesson euen to vs al: First of al, that as hee speaketh amiably, so should we also loue & imbrace his exhortatiōs: & as he declareth himself to be our father, saying, My sonne, so we also should shew ourselues his children, acknowledging him to be our father, not onely generally, but also particularly, yea father of euery one of vs as he himselfe declareth, saying to euery one of vs, My sonne, Nowe seeing hee hath no neede of vs, and that wee can doe nothing without him, we are very vnthankful, very blockish, and beastlike, if we doe not confesse him to be our father, & also shew ourselues to be his children. For to doe this wel, we must giue di∣ligent eare vnto his wordes, the which Solomon calleth his: not that hee is God, but onely his Minister and his instrument by whō he sendeth his wordes: and therefore, inasmuch as they come frō his mouth, he calleth them his. For throughly to vnderstand them, he would haue vs applie wholy our eares, preparing them to heare what is said vnto vs in the sermōs, that our eies also shold be opē without turning away frō them by distrust and vncertaintie, by rebellion and disobedience, by contempt and disdaine: but that we shold haue them in so great estimation, that we should neuer suffer them to depart from vs, but that our heartes should be con∣tinually armed with them, as he teacheth vs, when he saith, 21 Let them not depart from thine eies. Heereby wee learne that Solomon requireth faith and obedience of vs, and so, that he is both a law giuer and an Euangelist, as hath beene saide heere afore in the first Chapter. For when he calleth vs to heare & to prepare our eares, it is to the end that we shold do according as we shalbe cōmanded: It is also to the end that we should beleeue that which shalbe preached vnto vs. For faith cōmeth by hearing, Rom, 10. 17. and hearing by the worde of God. But Solomon doth yet expresse this same more plainely vnto vs, when he addeth, Let them not depart, &c. For he speaketh not here of the bodily eies, the which
r not capable of the word, which is spiritual, but of the thoughts and inward mind where with we imbrace the law of God, to obey it, without declining from it. Likewise by the Eies, he meaneth the knowledge and intelligence, whereby we delight in the worde of God and are assured of his goodnes & of his loue toward vs, as he doth declare the same by his gracious promises, which are a parte of his worde. That we must thus vnderstand that which hee saith of the eyes, it is manifest enough: but againe hee giueth the same to be vnderstood, when he saith immediately after, But keep them in the mids of thine heart. there the eies of the body see nothing. The scripture also in diuers other places speaketh of the eies in the same sense. Mine eyes are euer toward the Lord. I lift vp mine eies to thee, that dwellest in the heauēs. The eies of the blind, shal see Psalm. 25. 15. &. 4. 21. &. 1. 23. Esay. 29. 18. & 31. 3. &. 35. 5. Mat. 6. 22. Iob. 11. 40. out of darknes. The eies of the seeing shal not be shut, & the eares of them that heare, shal hearken. Then shal the eies of the blind be lightened, and the eares of the deafe be opened. The light of the body is the eye. If thou diddest beleeue, thou shouldst see the glo∣ry of God. And when Solomon hath beene already so careful to commend wisedome vnto vs, in like sort as he now commendeth vs his wordes: we must vnderstand that by his wordes he guideth and leadeth vs vnto wisedome, and that otherwaies we cannot at∣taine vnto it, and consequently that his words are not earthly, but diuine. Furthermore, forasmch as he calleth euery one of thē his sonne, (not carnally, but by adoption and regeneration of the ho∣ly Ghost) to whom he directeth his word, we ought to be assured that we are the children of God, when we gladly heare the prea∣ching of the Gospel, and doe diligently frequent the same, and doe yeelde our heartes and vnderstandings therevnto, to be guided in true obedience and assurance of the goodnesse of God towardes vs, and to forsake al rebellion, and to cast of al distrust in soundnes of heart voide of al dissimulatiō & hypocrisie. Besides this, for to learn well our lesson in that which Solomon cōtinueth and often telleth the same exhortatiōs, we must acknowledge our weaknes & ignorance, & by desiring to bee fortified & wel instructed, wee may not be greeued oftē to heare one doctrine, & that the same admonitiōs, & reprehēsiōs, be oftē repeated vnto vs: & that we do not only prepare our eares to heare the sermō, but that we sub∣due al our sēses, as Solomō teacheh vs saying, Let them not depart
from thine eies. For albeit he speaketh of the spiritual eies, yet whē after the custome of speaking, men refer the sight vnto all the sen∣ses, there is no incōuenience that by this kind of speach we should vnderstand, that we must captiuate all our senses vnto the worde. 22 For they are life. As Solomon doth often exhort vs one thing, so also for to encourage vs to follow his exhortations, & to Ʋerse. 4. 10. 13. Cap. 3. 2. 8. 16. 22. confirme vs more and more in the assurance of Gods goodnes, he repeateth oftentimes the very same promises that hee hath made heere aboue. After the custome of the worlde, that which is most vsed, is least of al esteemed: and also it is said that men are weary to eate alwaies of one loafe. Wherfore it might seeme to be good that Solomon did not so often set foorth one promise, for feare it should be despised. But as a very healthful stomack, that doth well digest, doth not refuse any good meat, though his diet be not chā∣ged, and that the same meate bee often giuen him: euen so hee also which hath a good hart vnto God, knowing that he hath need to be daily cōfirmed in the assurance of Gods goodnes, wil neuer de∣spise one promise, although the same be often reiterated: & chiefly whē it offereth that which is to be desired aboue al thing, bicause it is estemed of greatest profite & lasteth longest. The promise that Solomō presently maketh vs, is euen such. For thereby he offereth life to them which hold fast his sayinges, that is to say, to them which do not depart frō the exhortatiōs that they heare: but as the same is offered, so also they come for to meet & receiue them in humble submissiō & true obediēce. Now though ther were no∣thing but this present life promised heere, yet ought we not to de∣spise it, but to reioyce thereat, for it is Gods gift, which hath giuē vs this mercy to be created in this world by him, & doth continue it, promising to mainteine vs long in this life: the which as it is miserable, and is so called & esteemed, yet it is not in that as we take the same from God, but because we defile it by our sins, ther∣fore we deserue to suffer much miserie: and indeede, we suffer the same one in one sort, & another in another. And albeit the wicked know not this, yet do they greatly reioyce of this life, & esteeme it aboue al thinges, so that nothing is more precious to them then it. By a stronger reason when we know that the same is the gift of God, the which is not promised, for afterward to bring vs death:
but that this present life is promised vnto vs, for to make vs hope for the eternal life, the which wil neuer faile, for it is conteined vn∣der the promise, as it hath been expounded heretofore. When I say, wee haue this knowledge, this promise ought to bee highly esteemed of vs, and wee shoulde bee very careful to followe the meanes which are shewed vs, for to cōserue this life: and the ra∣ther seeing it costeth vs nothing to doe it, but haue euery day the meanes freely offered vnto vs by preaching; there remaineth no∣thing on our side, sauing that we shoulde seeke (by not departing from them) to meete and receiue them. And because that a mi∣serable and paineful life is counted no life, but rather death, Solo∣mon promiseth health vnto al creatures which wil seeke his wordes, not onely corporal, but spiritual and eternal. This health hath beene spoken of heere aboue in the 3. Chap. verse 8. Woulde wee then bee assured of health and life? Let vs giue eare vnto the worde of wisedome. 23 Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout com∣meth life. It is the heart then that must make our eares to encline, and our eies fixed on the holy exhortations, as Solomon hath well de∣clared the same vnto vs, when calling our eares to encline, & our eies to be bent to his wordes, he would haue vs to keepe them in the mids of our hearts. He hath not then promised life and health, for the inclination of the eares, nor for the sight of the eyes, but for the care and diligence of the heart. For this cause Solomon cōcludeth, admonishing vs that we should keep our hart with all diligence, and he giueth a reason, For therout commeth life. For wel to keepe our heart, wee haue neede of very meete and conue∣nient armour, the which Solomon hath taught vs heere aboue, & haue seene that the weapons of the heart are wordes, commande∣ments, wisedome, and vnderstanding. Wherevppon followeth, that albeit wee are admonished to keepe our heart, yet it is not to say that the same is in our power, but wee must pray vnto God, that he wil vouch safe to defende and keepe it. For the Lorde gi∣ueth wisedome, &c. For this cause also we are exhorted here a∣boue in the 3. Chap. and 5. verse, Trust in the Lorde with all thine
hearte, &c. And albeit these defenses come of God, and not of our¦selues, yet must wee take heede that we be not negligent, as if in vaine Solomon had exhorted vs to keepe our heart with all dili∣gence. For though it be not in our power, because of the corrup∣tion of our nature, yet this admonition serueth to aduertise vs of our duetie, to the end that we knowing that we cānot do it, shold haue our refuge vnto God, who onely hath the power to defende and keepe our hearts: & yet in the meane while wee should not sleepe and doe nothing: but as the Lorde doth offer his word vn∣to vs, and thereby his wisedome; euen so also our thoughtes and cogitations, our affection and desires, should be wholy giuen ther vnto, and that we shoulde gouerne all our life as wise men & wel learned. If we haue thus our refuge vnto God, wee will keepe our heartes withal diligence, albeit therein is nothing of ours, but so much as it pleaseth God of his grace to iudge it ours. And foras∣much as the weapons for to keepe our heartes are such, as is said, we may gather that we loose our heartes, by rebellion, incredulity, foolishnes, slouthfulnesse & ignorance, & consequently our life: for this that we liue and shal liue, is because our heartes are wel fenced with the former thinges. Solomon doth well signifie it, when hauing warned vs to keep our harts, he saith, For out ther∣of commeth life. In the which he maketh two reasons, the first is, that he giueth the reasō why he exhorteth vs to keepe our hearts. The second is, that we haue life because our heartes are kept. And as the keeping and preseruing of them is the gift of God, so is the life also which commeth thereof: wherevpon it followeth that we cannot deserue the same, as doe the popish Friers falsly lie. 24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee. Solomon here aboue in the 14. &. 15. verses hath forbidden vs the pathes of the wicked: and for the better instruction thereof, hath made an Antithesis of the same with the pathe of the righte∣ous, and for to know how we may walke in the one, & flie the o∣ther, he hath exhorted vs to giue eare vnto his words. And bicause it is not sufficient to haue our eares attentiue, & our heartes well
fenced, &c. except by the gouernance thereof our outward works, be wel framed, and our faultes corrected, whereby wee hurt our neighbors in hindering thē, either in their goods, or in their bo∣dies, or in their good fame, or in their soules, by slaunders & euill examples: For if the tree be good, it wil bring foorth good fruits, Matt. 1 and to make it more fruitful, they vse to cut away the dead bran∣ches and al superfluities, and must be purged from al those thinges that are hinderances to let his fruite. For this cause Solomon after hauing instructed our heartes, which is as the roote whereby the tree liueth, and by the which it bringeth foorth his fruites, then he laboureth to refourme the life outwardly. And first of all hee hath respect to reforme the mouth from the which he woulde haue vs to put away frowardnes: & therein he accuseth vs to be inward∣ly frowarde: For from the abundance of the heart the mouth spea∣keth. Mat. 12. 34. For this cause also he hath laboured heretofore to reforme the inward partes. If wee wil wel followe this reformation of the mouth, we must chiefly follow that which God by Moses cōman∣deth in the 3. and 9. commandements of the law. Therefore to put away frowardnesse from our mouthes, we must abhorre all periu∣ries, blasphemies, and superfluous and idle othes, & also to abstain frō pronoūcing at any time the name of god, but onely with feare and humblenesse to glorifie God. For according as hee is holy and worthy, euen so ought wee to beware from taking it in such sorte, that we might seeme to haue the same in contempt, or that we giue occasion of the slaundering thereof. To bee short, wee must take heede of al manner of idle wordes, lasciuious and wanton talke which giueth offence, and may cause vs for to forget, and to make any other to forget the feare and reuerence that men shoulde haue vnto God, and wherewith his name should be blasphemed: for seeing that his praise ought to be alwaies in our mouthes, if we vse lasciuious and wanton songes, it is a plaine argument that we make no count to giue him the honour that is due vnto him: and thus wee despise the name of GOD, and by vs it is blasphemed so that by the vnsauerinesse of our lippes, the which shoulde bee farre from vs, wee giue an occasion of the abasing of the holy name of God: for the which we must looke for greeuous punish∣ment. Leuit. 24. 14 2. Kin. 19. 35 For the Lord wil not hold him giltles that taketh his name
in vaine. By this and other threatnings, that are made against the blasphemers, wee may vnderstande that blasphemie is a most hor∣rible sinne, and worthie of great punishment. The Magistrates which beare the sworde, ought to looke straightly therevnto, &c. They also which haue the office of teaching the people, ought to be very careful to speake the sincere trueth, to the end that hauing their mouthes voide of frowardnesse, and their lippes free from wantonnes, they may the better purge the same of the peoples, so much as in them lyeth: contrarily, the Lord wil aske the blood of the people which perish, at the handes of such pastours. And sith that for to put away frowardnesse from our mouth, wee may not beare false witnesse, it followeth that wee must abstaine from per∣iurie in iudgement, from lying, from backbiting, frō flattering, & from al maner of words, wherby our neighbor is wounded in his goodes and good name, &c. And as for to put away this froward∣nesse, we must beware to take the name of God in vaine, and to beare false witnesse euen so must we not suffer in our presence a∣ny to sinne against these 2. cōmandements. For we must zealous∣ly mainteine the honour and glory of our God, wheresoeuer wee become, except we wil be infidels and vnfaithful, traitours & wic∣ked: considering that hee is our Creatour, and Father, our King, and our Sauiour. Likewise, wee must in no wise suffer that any speake iniuries of our neighbours: seeing we must loue them as ourselues, and that they are our fleshe: otherwise, it were as if we take the name of God in vaine, and that wee did beare false wit∣nesse against our neighbour. Notwithstanding wee must not spare to chide them, to rebuke them, to blame them, and to accuse them whome we knowe to leade a slanderous and dissolute life. Thus doing, wee backbite them not, we hurt not their good name: but endeuour to bring them to amendment, or els to chasten them, that others may feare, and by such examples may withdraw them¦selues from euill. But in this doing wee must take heede wee be not led with hatred, with enuie, with anger, or with desire of vengeance: but onely with the desire of the glory and honour of GOD, and with the edifiyng and saluation of our neighbours: otherwise, wee deceiue our heartes. If any man seeme to bee deuoute, and refraineth not his tongue, &c. this mans religion Iam. 1. 26.
is in vaine. Wee must also beware to condemne our neighbours in iudging too proudly of their doings and sayings, and to make a lawe for their life: and also that wee may not vse any euil words, which proceede from a corrupt and wicked iudgement, whereby Iam. 4. 11. wee arrogantly condemne whatsoeuer displeaseth vs in our neigh∣bours: for in so doing, wee obey not the lawe. But so dooing (I say) our mouthes are full of poyson, and yet wee wil appeare in prayer honest folkes: &c. But God alloweth not such blessings. By it we blesse our God and Father: and thereby we curse men made Iam. 3. 9. after the likenes of God. 25 Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee. Solomon woulde not haue vs to looke heere and there, where wee haue not to doe, for feare wee shoulde goe out of the way, & shoulde wander into thinges that nothing apperteine vnto vs, or that might bee hurtfull to vs or to our neighbours: but to looke right before vs, that euery one looke to his own worke, according to the state wherin he is called of God, and that euery one should folowe his office. It is not without cause that Solomon demaun∣deth this: For wee be curious and easie to cast our sight hither & thither, wee fall away, and forsake our state and office: In which doing, we bring ourselues in danger, and it happeneth oftentimes that we bring hurt to our neighbours: and which is much worse, we dishonour God: for our sight which is not right, causeth vs to fall into disobedience and rebellion. Our state is to acknow∣ledge one onely God, to worship him, to commend, to prayse and to call vpon him: but if we lift vp our eyes for to marke here and there howe the worlde is full of idolatrie, and that wee earnestly looke vnto the fayre shewe of holinesse, they haue in the seruice of their Idoles and goodly gaye Images; wee are in danger to for∣get God, and to worship strange Gods, as did the children of Isra∣el, as we may knowe by the complaintes that God hath made a∣gainst them by Moses and his Prophets, and also the holy histories doe declare the same: and as the Papists doe at this day. Our of∣fice is to heare the voice of our great Pastour, for to folowe and hang vpon him, & to put al the trust of our saluation in him only:
but if we looke to these faire schooles of Popish & diuellish diui∣nity, beholding the great multitude of the worldly wise, which fo∣lowe it, and lead after them people without number, there is dan∣ger lest we should desire to heare strangers. It behooueth vs ther∣fore 1. Cor. 7. 1. Heb. 13. 4. to leade a chast and a shamefast life, according to Gods com∣mandement, Thou shalt not commit adulterie, and as Saint Paul doeth teach vs: but if contemning the holie state of Matrimonie, or els that wee are not pleased with our lawful yoke felowe, gaze here and there on the beautie of men and women, we are alreadie Mat. 5. 28. whoremongers before God, and are in danger to defile and pol∣lute our bodies, and to make them the members of an harlot: as Gen. 6. 2. & 34. 1. & 5. 19 befell vnto the sonnes of God: and virgins are in danger to bee violated, as was Dina. And not this onely, but also we are giuen to sinnes against nature, as were the Zodomites and Gomorrhi∣ans, and those whereof Saint Paule speaketh. But as by such fil∣thinesse God hath bene dishonoured, so also could he wel tel how Rom. 1. 26. to reuenge it. By the which vengeance he teacheth vs, that who∣soeuer shoulde folowe suche iniquities, could not escape his hand. Our duetie is not to set our handes on our neighbours goods, for to rauish & take the same from them, but rather to preserue them, so farre as we can: but if through couetousnes, or impatient bea∣ring of the pouertie that pincheth vs, wee looke vnto our neigh∣bours substance, wee bring ourselues in danger to bee theeues or robbers, to couet the riches of our neighbours, and for it to enuie them, to hate & malice them, euen to kil them, if we could, wher∣of death ensueth: for it is saide, Whosoeuer hateth his brother, is a manslear: and we knowe that no murtherer hath eternal life 1. Ioh. 3. 15. dwelling in him. And when wee knowe that it is God that sen∣deth our afflictions and aduersities, seeing hee doeth nothing but iustly, and as he knoweth to be expedient for his faithful seruants; our duetie is to beare them patiently without murmuring, and to preferre our miseries and calamities before al the ease, delightes, and pleasures of this worlde, and before al, that euer our flesh can wishe or desire: but if through impatiencie wee turne aside our eyes for to marke the prosperous state of the wicked, we shalbee tempted to folowe them, and to desire to bee like them, for to haue parte of their prosperitie, wherein wee deceiue our¦selues:
for this prosperous state, is of no continuaunce. The office of Magistrates is, to giue right vnto al that demaunde the Psal. 37. 2. same, and to minister good and speedie iustice, aswel to the least as to the greatest, aswel to the poore, as to the riche: but if they turne aside their eyes to marke other matters, and not to consci∣ence: if they delight to see and receiue presents and giftes: if they turne their eyes vnto their parentes and friendes, to the riche and mightie, to their Gosseps and neighbour, any of these things doe Psal. 82. 7. easily peruert iudgement, and make them not to giue right vnto the owners. Wherfore though they be Gods, yet shal they die as men, &c. Wee may heere speake of the duetie of Ministers, of Fa∣thers and Mothers, and al such as haue charge ouer others. 26 Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright. 27 Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but re∣mooue thy foote from euil. Hee vseth a similitude taken from them, which sell and buye by waight, and which for to separate the heauie from the light, and to choose the best from the worst, doe vse balances and other instruments and engins to waye withal: and to the end that they may learne to discerne and knowe the best and the most lawfull merchandise, they looke vnto the euen setting of the balances, & to make them stande right. For hee sayeth, Ponder the pathe, &c: and that wee may ponder it wel, hee woulde that as before waying, wee vse to dresse and mende the balances and other en∣gins, euen so shoulde wee order and direct our wayes, that wee might knowe whether our pathes were good and lawful. Nowe for to learne wel howe wee shall obeye this exhortation, we must vnderstand that as our feete in the Scriptures are taken for our af∣fections, euen so our pathes ought to be taken for whatsoeuer we are ledde to by our affections. Our pathes then, is our outwarde conuersation, our manners and customes, our workes and deedes, wherein wee bestowe the tyme of our life, and whereby we main∣taine one another, doe seruice and pleasure, & helpe one of vs a∣nother. And as we iudge that the Merchants do not behaue them¦selues faithfully in their estate, when they care not to haue good
waightes and measures, and sel the light for as much as the waigh∣tie, the smal measure as the true, & care for nothing but for their particular profite, according as their concupiscences doe lead them about: euen so, if wee folowe our carnal affections, not taking heede what wee doe, so that wee may doe as we lust, and take our delight and pleasure, we rashly proceed, and imploy not ourselues lawfully and faithfully to serue our neighbours. The which is ab∣hominable before God, and is not pleasing to men of sound & vp∣right iudgement, and is an offence vnto the simple and ignorant. For this cause Solomon is not contented with the pondering of our pathes: for the wise of this world doe weigh (as they think good) their pathes: when they so gouerne themselues by natural reason and carnal wisedome, that they winne reputation, and are esteemed in the worlde. It seemeth wel also vnto the dissolute and wanton, that they ponder deepely their pathes, when they narow∣ly watch, lest they should be hindred of their pleasure, and looke circumspectly about them, whereby they may come to the end of their purpose, be it right or wrong. It is not enough therfore that wee ponder our pathes, but as Solomon demandeth, we must let al our wayes be ordered aright: that is to say, that al the meanes wee folowe to guide the buisines that wee haue to doe one with the other, should be good and lawfull, iust and reasonable. Nowe they shalbe suche, if renouncing the affection of the fleshe, which is not subiect to the lawe of God, wee labour to yeelde ourselues obedient vnto the Worde of God, without adding to or dimini∣shing any thing therefrom in any wise. It is the same onely, wher∣by we must haue our affections framed, whereby our pathes must be guided, and whereby all our life ought to be ruled. Wee ought wel to learne this, when wee see howe God commendeth vnto vs so carefully, his onely Word, both by Moses and by his Prophets, and finally by Iesus Christ, his Apostles and Ministers: and that hee threateneth with horrible vengeance those which shal despise it, and wil neither beleeue nor obeye it. For this cause Solomon desiring our saluation, doeth teach vs how we shoulde ponder the pathes of our feete, and order all our wayes aright when hee sayeth, Turne not to the right hand, &c. Solomon is not the first that
hath giuen this doctrine. Moses which went before him, hath saide, Yee shal put nothing vnto the Worde which I commaund you, neither shal ye take ought therefrom. Take heede therefore, Deu. 42. & 5. 32. & 12. 8. 32. that ye doe as the Lorde your God hath commaunded you: turne not aside to the right hand, nor to the left. Ye shal not doe after all these things, that we do here this daye: that is, euery man what∣soeuer seemeth him good in his owne eyes. Thou shalt put no∣thing thereto, nor take ought therefrom. But thou shalt not de∣cline & 28. 14. from any of the wordes, which I commaunde you this day, either to the right hande or to the left, to goe after other Gods to serue them. Be ye therefore of a valiant courage, to obserue & doe all that is written in the booke of the lawe of Moses, that ye turne Iosua. 23. 6. 1. Kin. 18. 21 not therefrom to the right hande nor to the left. Howe long halte ye betweene two opinions? This is not then a new doctrine, but most auntient, and is needefull for vs to folowe, if wee wil truely say, that we are Christians. For our Lorde Iesus Christ hath giuen vs this doctrine, when hee preached that which hee heard of his Iohn. 8. 26. & 6. 38. Father: and that hee witnesseth hee came not to doe his owne wil, but the same of God his Father, who sent him. His Apostles also followed him, preaching nothing but the pure Gospel, that they might teach the right way, & hold the people therin. Wher∣fore wee must take good heed of the Pope and of his mainteiners, which bragge themselues to be the successours of the Apostles, & yet by strange doctrines, and mens traditions they labour to make vs decline from the pure doctrine of the trueth, from the which when we are turned away, we easily giue ouer ourselues vnto all kind of wickednesses, & know not how to come backe: & which worst is, we delight therein, and so make vice vertue. Thus doing, wee decline to the righthand, or to the left. For to turne to the right hand or to the left, is none other thing, than to despise the good, that is taught and commaunded vs by the Worde, and to giue ourselues ouer vnto euil. Solomon doth wel signifie it, when hauing saide, Turne not, &c: he addeth, But remooue thy foote from euil. Wherein first of all he sheweth vs, that there is no euil but that which is committed against the Word of God: for then we decline, & not when we despise the commandements of men: and though they alledge vs this, Whosoeuer heareth you, &c: yet Luk. 10. 16,
we must not be afraid, except they declare the pure word of God. Secondly, that there is nothing but al euil, when we turne on the right hand or the left: albeit that many things may be done which cannot be reprooued before men. For also as there is but God on¦ly which is good, so also should wee not esteeme any thing to be good, but onely that which is done after his holie, good, and iust commaundement: but from man which is altogether corrupted, Gen. 6. 1. which is carnal and sold vnder sinne, can proceede nothing but all euil. &c. The fifth Chapter. 1 My Sonne, hearken vnto my wisedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge, 2 That thou mayest regard counsel, and thy lippes obserue knowledge. WHen Solomon exhorteth vs as his children, to hearken vnto wisdome and knowledge, the which hee cal∣leth his, because that God had gi∣uen him of his grace, whereby also hee communicateth it vnto vs, as hauing charge to teach vs: And in that hee often repeateth the same admonition, thereby we must vn∣derstād that it is a thing very need∣ful for vs to be attentiue vnto this wisdome: otherwise he would not bee so carefull to repeate so often vnto vs one sentence, seeing hee speaketh by the holie Ghost, whose speech is not superfluous. He hath alreadie declared vnto vs diuers profites & fruites which come of wisedome: and because he is not satisfied with this de∣claration, he pursueth to amplifie the same, saying, that wee must hearken vnto wisedome, to the end that wee may keepe his coun∣sels, the which he hath alreadie giuen vs, and stil remaineth readie to giue vs hereafter. Now amongst other counsels & aduisemēts, he would haue our lippes to obserue knowledge: that is, that wee should not speake but as wise and wel learned, & that we shoulde
knowe and learne what to speake, and howe we must speake: not as the worldlinges knowe, but after the instruction of our Fa∣ther, and folowing his commandements, whereby hee counselleth vs what wee haue to doe, and what to say. This is the knowledge that we must learne, to the end that we may know what we should say, and that we should not speake as amazed, as fooles and insen∣sed, nor as beastes and ignoraunt, which are without vnderstan∣ding: nor yet as malicious, which speake fraudulently, to deceiue and hurt their neighbours. This counsel is directed vnto vs al, & principally vnto the Ministers of the Worde, the which ought to be so indued with knowledge, that others may drawe from their Mat. 14. 15. mouth: otherwise al goeth to destruction: as if the blinde leade the blinde, both fall into the ditche. To the end also that our lippes should keepe knowledge, we must beware that wee doe not applie them to vnlawful touchings, as do whoremongers by vnshamefast kisses, which are done without knowledge: for if they knewe wel what they did, they woulde be much more afraide thereof then of temporal death, when they knowe that by such lasciuiousnes they fal into eternal damnation: and so it shalbee a verie deare kissing vnto them, the which they finde sweete to the feeling of the flesh. Solomon giuing a reason for the which he would haue our lippes keepe knowledge, doeth aduertise vs of this sweetenesse and soft∣nesse, when he sayeth, 3 For the lippes of a straunge woman drop as an honi∣combe, and her mouth is more soft then oyle. 4 But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and sharpe as a two edged sword. 5 Her feete goe downe to death, and her steppes take hold on hell. 6 Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moue∣able: thou canst not knowe them. Here aboue, in the 2. Cap. & 16. verse, hath bin declared what this straunge woman is, and wherefore shee is so called. The distilling of her lippes, and the softnesse of her mouth lyeth in that, that shee flattereth with her wordes, as hath beene saide, and shall bee treated of agayne, heere vnder, in
the seuenth Chapter. Now that we must abhorre this honie and this oyle of flatteries, and consequently, the kisses and touchinges which folow the same, he sheweth wel, when he sayeth, 4 But the ende of her, &c. As they which eate of Allume or drinke the iuice thereof, doe afterwardes feele the sharpe taste in their mouthes long after: and as they that vse kniues with two edges, if they take not good heede doe easily wound themselues: euē so also they which delight in the flattering style of the strāger, in her kisses & imbrasings, shal fele great sourenes, & shalbe stroke with mortal wounds for euer: as Solomō doth shew it, saying, 5 Her feete goe downe to death, &c. In the 2. Chapter and 18. and 19. verses, this death hath beene treated of. But there is this difference, that there the house of the whore is spoken of, which is herself, & al those which are acquainted with her: & here her feete are spoken of, which are her euil affections, her carnal desires, & her disordered lustes. But the things wel cōsidered and ioyned to∣gether, come al to one end. For if the whore by her concupiscen∣ces, enterprises, and inticements which folow her, goe downe to death, and that shee taketh holde on hell, that shee be snared with eternal damnation: for when any sicknes or hurt happeneth to a∣ny man, we say that he hath taken this sicknes. It foloweth right wel, that al they which cōsent vnto her desires, and haue commu∣nication with her, shalbe ouerthrowne with death, & taken with hell, from whence they shal not returne, &c. If the whore & her gallants & companions, goe into such destruction, it is no meruel: for they take neither coūsel nor aduise, neither strēgth nor know∣ledge, but doe rashly & amazedly proceed in ignorance and with∣out aduisement. Solomon doeth declare it, when he sayeth, 6 Shee weigheth not, &c. Hee that maketh no count to fo∣low the necessary meanes to preserue life, is wel worthie of death: He that careth not, neither regardeth where hee goeth, deserueth wel to fal into the ditch, from whence he can not get out: and for∣asmuche as naturally euery man desireth to liue, wee wil surely iudge a man out of his witte, that wil not care to preserue his life, but wil seeke meanes to destroy it. Such are the whores & whor∣mongers, as Solomon doeth shewe vs, saying, She weigheth not the way of life, &c: for albeit he doeth not speake but of the
whore, yet doeth he giue vs wel to vnderstande that the whore∣mongers shal not bee exempted from the punishment due vnto their wickednes, seeing that God spareth not the most weakest kinde or sexe. 7 Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth. When Solomon speaketh vnto children, he speaketh as wel to the Female as to the Males. For as there are vnshamefast whores, which doe entice and deceiue foolish and vndiscreete men: euen so also there are wicked whoremongers, which giue their studie to induce maydes and vndiscreete women to agree vnto vncleannes and filthines, and to commit whoredomes. He giueth the meanes vnto them both, whereby they may be kept from deceit: to wit, in hearing that which shalbee spoken in the name of God, who is Father both of Males and Females, and also by his Worde, and to giue obedience vnto that which they shal receiue from his mouth, when he speaketh to them by his Ministers, which preach nothing but his pure Worde. Solomon, (as we haue seene) maketh gladly his exhortations general, & then for more plaine declaratiō he de∣scendeth vnto the particular parts, that we may vnderstād the say∣ings of his mouth, for to folow thē. Thē after this maner, he saith, 8 Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her house: 9 Lest thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel: 10 Lest the stranger should be filled with thy strength, and thy labors be in the house of a stranger, 11 And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou hast con∣sumed thy flesh and thy bodie.) 12 And say, Howe haue I hated instruction, and mine heart despised correction: 13 And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that instructed me? 14 I was almost brought into al euil, in the midst of the congregation, and assembly. If we wil then diligently heare and not goe backe from his say∣ings, we must take heed that our maners and liuing doe not agree with the affections & desires of whores & whoremōgers, & that
we haue no maner of familiaritie with such people, for to consent vnto their lustes, and agree vnto their flatterings & sweet words: contrarily, if we folowe them, if wee desire the entrance of their gates, for to fulfil our wicked concupiscences, wee are out of the way of life, we are shut out of the houshold of God, we haue no 1. Cor. 6. 9. Ephe. 5. 3. Ephe. 5. 10. entrance in thither: Bee not deceiued: neither Fornicators, nor I∣dolators, &c. shal inherite the kingdome of heauen. But fornicati∣on, and al vncleannes, or couetousnes, let it not be once named a∣mongst you. We may wel resort vnto such, for to reprooue them. And haue no felowship with the vnfruitful workes of darkenesse, but euen reprooue them rather. This is the greatest plague that cā happen to any man to be depriued of the house of God: for in that case he hath neither part nor portion but in death & hel: but be∣fore that these miserable creatures and infected, doe feele and per∣ceiue such calamitie, they spende and spoile their owne substance, spending the same with such people as they ought not, & that wil giue thē neuer the more thanks, but are cause of their destruction, and haue no pitie nor compassion vpon such pore miserable spend-thrifts, albeit they spoyle themselues euen to the harde bones, by giuing of presents, & making superfluous & excessiue costs, for to enioy their wicked desires. Solomon doeth wel signifie it, when he sayeth, 9 Lest thou giue. &c. When al riches belong vnto God, & that he giue part to them that pleaseth him, for to preserue the yeares of their life, in what sort so euer wee possesse and come by them, whether it be by patrimonie, gift, getting, or by our handie labor, we must confesse therein that God doeth not honour vs, & main∣teineth vs in this life, to the end that we should not be frustrate of the yeares which he hath giuen vs in this world. Wherefore, if for to get acquaintance & familiaritie, to accomplish our wicked wil, and to enioy our carnal pleasure with whores & whoremongers, we giue presents and gifts, and prodigally doe spend our goods in gorgeous and pompeous apparel, and in superfluous and sumptu∣ous bankets, in stead of reasonable expences, for to helpe our fa∣milie, and to giue to the necessitie of our poore Christian brethrē, which are or should be of our houshold, yea, our members: if, I say, for to get such deuilish acquaintance, we spende thus cursedly
the riches that are committed vnto, and giue our honor vnto the stranger, and so much as in vs lieth, giue ouer our yeares vnto such as haue no pitie nor compassion of vs, and care not, though wee spoile ourselues, to cloth them, though we starue ourselues, to feede them fatte, so vnmerciful are they and cruell. Luke. 15. 14▪ The prodigal spend thrifts which are driuen to beg, doe prooue the same with the prodigal child. If their repentance were known, and that they truly confessed their faultes, as did the poore prodi∣gal childe, we ought to haue pitie on them, and helpe their neces∣sitie, Gen. 2. 15. &c. But that we must thus vnderstand, this honour and these yeares, Solomon sheweth it, saying, 10 Lest the stranger should be filled, &c. Forasmuch as from the beginning of the world the Lorde God tooke man and placed him in the garden of Eden, that hee might dresse and keepe it, and that in al ages, suche as were of right iudgement haue be∣stowed themselues to good workes, because they woulde not liue Exo. 20. . idlely, and be vnprofitable in this world, and that God sayeth vn∣to vs, Sixe dayes shalt thou labour: and also according to the say∣ing of Saint Paule, Let him that stole, steale no more, &c. And a∣gaine, Ephe. 4. 28. 2. Thes. 3. 8. Neither tooke wee bread of any man for naught. Wee will here take the strength and the labour, for the goods that a man getteth and gathereth by his worke, for to sustaine his life. The Gen. 4. 12. Iob. 6. 22. & 31. 38. Eccle. 2. 10 verse 11. 12. Deut. 28. 33. Psal. 78. 46. Psal. 105. 44. Scripture vseth it in this signification. God said vnto Cain, When thou shalt til the ground, it shal not hencefoorth yeeld vnto thee her strength. Was it because I said, bring vnto me? or giue a reward to mee of your substance? If my land crie against mee, &c. Thus much for strength. But labours is spoken of in diuers places. My heart reioyced in al my labour; and this was my portion of all my trauell. The fruite of thy lande, and all thy labours, &c. Hee gaue also their fruits vnto the Caterpiller, & their labour vn∣to the Grashopper: And gaue them the landes of the heathen, and they tooke the labours of the people in possession. And albeit that it come from the power and goodnes of God, that we become rich (for of him onely haue we our strength and ablenes, our wisdom and wil to imploy vs, it is he alone that maketh the earth fruitful) yet notwithstāding he is so good, that what he giueth vs, he estee∣meth ours, and doeth declare it vnto vs, to the end that we shoulde
know that hee hath giuen vs libertie to vse them with praise and thankesgiuing, with ioy & gladnes. But if it be not lawful for vs to vse our owne goods prodigally, so muche the lesse is it lawful to steale, or to borow, to spend prodigally, and to liue dissolutely, brauely, and in costly buildings and belly cheare. 11 And thou mourne at thine ende. As in liuing chastly, & by sustaining ourselues with the goods which God giueth vs to vse soberly and temperately, the bodie is mainteined, and kepte from feeblenesse and diseases, and is strengthened & made strong to labour about good and honest things, for to profit ourselues & our neighbours: euen so contrarily, by whore hunting and wasting the goods of God immoderately, we spoile our bodies, and make them subiect to diuers sicknesses, and become vnprofitable, so that we can neither profit ourselues nor our neighbours, but are con∣strained to perish miserably: Wherevpon finally, we mourne and make lamentation, when we see and feele ourselues in so pitiful a case. But al in vaine: for so litle is our griefe assuaged by suche mourning, that rather it is increased. Solomon did wel perceiue the same by the wisedome he had receiued of God: and therefore he forbiddeth to haue felowship with whores, and to spende our goods prodigally: and now he declareth the meanes whereby the bodie is consumed, and looseth his strength: nowe seeing & per∣ceiuing themselues in such miserie, they lament: but it is to late, as he doeth wel signifie it, saying. That it is at the end, and when we can no longer: for the bodie and the strength faileth, and can not be recouered nor restored. For this cause Solomon woulde haue vs to liue with such shamefastnesse & chastitie, with such so∣brietie & temperancie, that we should not be cōpelled to mourne. Not so, but that lamentations are profitable, when they proceede out of a contrite & lowly heart, truely repentant: For with suche Esai. 66. 2. Psal. 34. 18. & 51. 19. Luk. 23. 42. Gen. 25. 32. & 27. 34. Heb. 12. 17. mournings God is pleased, & doth hear thē: also the mourning of the theefe was heard, & the bitter teares of Peter: but the mour∣nings that are made only for the paine wee suffer, or that is iudged to be at hand, & not for the euil that hath bin cōmitted, doth no∣thing profit them that so mourn. Cain, Pharao, Saul & Iudas haue prooued it: Esau also may serue as an example for the prodigall. At the first sight such kinde of lamentations, seeme that they shoulde profit, and that God should receiue them: but Solomon doth con∣demne
them, as hee sheweth, when hee sets before vs heere, such as haue a faire shew, saying, 12 And say, how haue I hated instruction? &c. Although Dan. 9. 5. 1. Ioh. 1. 9. Daniel confesseth his sinnes, and the sinnes of his people, and that Iohn saieth, If wee confesse our sinnes, God is faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sinnes: yet it might seeme that Solomon neede not to feare that the whorekeepers and spend thrifts should make this mourning, lamenting their wickednesses past. But if wee diligently marke, wee shal see that Solomon doeth not reprooue the mour∣ning, but regardeth from whence the same proceedeth, that is to say, either from the paine they suffer, or els that they feare to suf∣fer, and not from the griefe of hauing offended God, frō the which the confession of our sinnes ought only to come, & not from the paine we feele or that we feare. True it is, that if wee bee afflicted, we should cal to memorie that we haue offended God, and con∣fesse that we haue wel deserued to be punished, cōfessing our sins, and crauing pardon for them, as did Daniel and the theefe. Also this cōplaint should be made by al true repentant sinners: for they Luk. 23. 48. ought to confesse that they doe not take the instructions and cor∣rections in so good part as they should: for wee al of our own na∣ture commend ourselues, & think ourselues wise & righteous e∣nough. They which repent not truely, will oftentimes make most goodly confessions in shew, and wil stuffe them with many words which shal seeme to proceed of a great sorowfulnesse of heart. So∣lomon here doeth wel expresse it, when hee is not satisfied to attri∣bute to them the former confession, but for a more plaine decla∣ration thereof, addeth their saying, 13 And haue not obeyed. In this addition we see how it commeth that men hate instruction, and regarde not correction, that is to say, when they despise the reading of the holie Scrip∣tures, and are negligent to heare the preaching of the Worde. To the end then that we be not compelled to make this mourning, for the paines that shal pinche vs by whoredome and prodigalitie, let vs obey Moyses and the Prophets, and aboue al, the chiefe Pro∣phet and our onely Maister Iesus Christ, and his Apostles and Mi∣nisters, which are ordeined by him for to bee our Maisters, and to teach vs his wil, & not for to make new commandements, & or∣dinances at their pleasure and fantasies, as doeth that tyrant of
Rome, The miserable whoremongers and prodigall spenders will not mourne for that they haue disobeied these doctours and mai∣sters, for they are dumbe dogs which barke not: but though they say themselues to be the successors of the Apostles, & esteeme thē¦selues the rulers and gouernours of Christendome, and the pillers of the Church: yet through their dissolute life they offend & de∣stroy the people, causing great multitudes to fal by their euil exam∣ple. These woful whoremongers and prodigal spend thrifts might rather bewaile themselues for hauing almost giuen themselues o∣uer vnto al euil by their example, then not hauing obeyed their voice: for in companying with them, they see, heare, & learne no∣thing but al euil. Wherfore, we must flye both them and their like, to the end that we be not prouoked by their example to waxe cor∣rupt in al euil, and that wee should haue no cause to mourne with these stinking whoremongers, who al in vaine doe be waile them∣selues, saying, 14 I was almost brought, &c. Albeit, that more euil is lear∣ned, & that men are more easily corrupted with wicked company, and by euil examples, then otherwise: yet neuertheles the foolish and vndiscreete, the contemners & rebels, the mockers and disso∣lute cease not to be corrupted, and to bee giuen to al euil, though they are admonished by good Doctours and Maisters, and do liue and be mingled with good people, in the congregation and assem∣bly of the faithful. Wherfore we may take this mourning as if the wicked did lament that in what companie so euer they came, good or bad, they grew corrupted and altogether giuen vnto euil. Not∣withstanding, seeing the former lamentation, it is more likely true, that they bewaile themselues, for that they haue not ceased from running to al euil, when they were taught & admonished by good Doctors & Maisters in the company of the faithful, which were no mal numher: as this repetition doeth shewe, In the midst of the congregation and assembly: for it is as much as to say, as in the great assemblie. In this their lamentation, they shewe that they haue sinned more greeuously then if they had companied onely with the wicked, amongst whom they should haue had no instruc∣tion. This last exposition is the most meetest vnto the line of the text of Solomon. He setteth before vs these lamentations, to the
end that we should not commit wickednes, wherby we should be constrained thus to lament, for the punishmēt that foloweth ther∣of: and not but that we should be displeased with ourselues, for the euil that we haue done. For they that doe so lament, should be verie readie to doe the like, if they had the power. 15 Drinke the water of thy Cesterne, and of the Riuers out of the midst of thine owne well. 16 Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of wa∣ters in the streetes. 17 But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the strangers with thee. 15 For to teach vs what we should do, that wee might not giue our honour vnto strangers, least wee bee compelled to lament for the consumption of our flesh and of our strength, he exhorteth Deut. 11. 11. vs to drinke the waters of our Cesterne. And therein he respecteth the descriptiō of the land of Iuda, in the which were mountaines and vallies, that were moistened with the raine from heauen: and therfore they had made wels & Cesterns to hold & keepe water, very necessary for them. As when Abraham came & dwelt in this Gen. 26. 15. land, his seruants digged & caued wels. Regarding this situation (as hath bin said) he ordeineth that we should drink water, wher∣by he meaneth al fruites which we gather of our labor & trauell: the which he signifieth, when he saith, not absolutely of Cesternes & of welles: but, of thy Cesternes and out of thine owne welles, that is to say, that thou hast caued and digged, and keepest. Nowe when as Solomon, vnder this which is of least price and estimatiō in the prouision of a house (for there is nothing that is more spilt then water, & also that lest serueth for marchandise) comprehen∣deth al the necessities of the house; he also sheweth that we must keepe great sobrietie and temperance, and not desire to make ex∣cessiue and superfluous cost, & that we must not folowe gluttony nor dronkēnes. And whē he saith, drinke, & not to call drinke, he sheweth that we should be careful to nourish our houshold, and not to spēd our goods prodigally vpon making good cheere with knaues and whoores, with belly gods and vnsatiable throates. Be∣sides this also we wil first of al note, that albeit we must bee sober and temperate, and contented most with simple drinkes and meates, yet that it is lawful for vs to vse all kinde of meates. As
when God promised the land of Chanaan vnto the children of Is∣rael, he did not promise them that they should drinke water one∣ly, 1. Tim. 4. 4. Exo. 3. 8. Leuit. 26. 4 Deut. 28. 1. Exo. 20. 15. but he also promiseth abundāce of all fruites of the land for to eate with fulnesse, with ioy, and in peace, and rest. Secondly, what licence soeuer is geuen vs, to vse all benefites, yet must wee abstaine from those that belong vnto our neighbour, as we haue two expresse commandements for it: And Solomon doth signifie the same here, saying, Of thy Cesternes, and of thine owne wels. Thirdly, forasmuch as the Cesternes and Welles do runne to de∣cay and fall downe, except they be mended and tended, and both cost and labour be bestowed vpon them: euen so Solomon doeth aduertise vs to labour, and priuilie forbiddeth vs begging, from the which cōmeth much euil. Fourthly, although that the wels & Cesternes be ours, and that Solomon biddeth vs drinke water, yet ought we not to be so partial, nor so much giuē to our own profit, but that we should haue care of our neighbors, and endeuour to communicat part of ours, for to relieue their need, we must not be such pinchers, to eate our bread alone: but we must distribute the same into diuers partes, as Solomon teacheth vs, saying, 16 Let thy fountaine flowe foorth, &c. As he that hath one or many fountaines, wanteth no water, though they runne ouer and spred here and there far of, euen so the man which shal distri∣bute the goods that God hath giuen him, shal haue enough & not want. When we were Papists, wee were wont wel to say, To giue for Gods sake doth not make a man poore. If in such darkenesse of ignorance, of superstition and idolatry, of al wickednes and abhomination, we spake and felt so rightly: what ought we to say and feele now, when God by his grace hath deliuered vs frō these darknesses, & dayly doeth lighten vs by his pure word, the which Deut. 15. 4. Esay. 58. 7. Luke. 12. 33. &. 16. 9. is brought vnto vs by these lightes, not only by Solomon, but by Moses, and by his Prophets by this great light Iesus Christ, and by his Apostles. And as the man which wil not suffer his waters to runne ouer, but laboureth to hold and locke them in perforce, doeth put himself in danger that the waters should rise and swel so 2. Cor. 8. 7. &. 9. 5. 1. Iohn. 3. 17 Iam. 2. 13. much that they should destroy & drowne his house, & he to pe∣rish therwith: euē so the couetous rich mā which feareth that the earth shuld faile him, & encloseth al to himself, therby doth perish: for iudgemēt without mercy shalbe to him that sheweth no mer∣cy.
And as the waters stopt vp, are vnprofitable, euen so are riches hidden. It is not then without cause that Solomon saith, Let thy fountaines &c. And sith he compareth the riches and wealth of this worlde, vnto the fountaines of water, he teacheth vs that we may not set our heartes vpon them: neither that wee must spare them towardes them that haue need, nor feare to want them. But as the fountaines are ours, though the waters runne ouer, so the proprietie of that which we enioy, is ours, albeit that wee must 2. Cor. 9. 8. Gal. 6. 9. deale the fruites that come thereof, liberally and largely, yea euen to the bottome, if necessitie so require: but whiles the fruites are sufficient, Solomon would that we should be lordes & maisters of the bottome, when he saith: 17 But let them be thine. Although Solomon is not sa∣tisfied to haue saide, Thine, but repeateth againe, Thine, adding therevnto an exclusiue worde, that is to say, Onely, for hee saith, Euen thine onely: yet let vs not thinke that he would exclude the poore members of Iesus Christ, which not only are our brethren, but also bones of our bones, and fleshe of our flesh, for wee all are Rom. 12. 5. one body in Iesus Christ, & euery one of vs one anothers mēbers. And as Iesus Christ with al that is his, is ours through grace, euē so amongst Christiās and the faithful, there ought to be such fellow¦ship, that none shold say that any thing were his, but that he shold be ready to bestowe it to the profite of his neigbours, as need shal require, as they of the primitiue Churche haue giuen vs example thereof. And that according to the woorde, Sell that which yee possesse, &c. And Saint Paul would haue vs to buy, as though we possessed not. He excludeth none but strangers, as he himselfe Act. 4. 34 Luke. 12. 33 1. Cor. 17. 3 declareth, saying, And not the strangers with thee. Nowe by Strangers, as wee may gather by the words that Solomon vseth, are ment knaues and whores, the prophane & infidels, with whō we ought to haue nothing to doe, neither is it needefull that wee shoulde giue them our strength and our labours, much lesse the bottome & al, the which also doth not so belong vnto our faithful Act.  4 2. Cor. 8. 13. neighbours with vs, that we ought to sell the same for them, and defraude one family thereof, except the necessitie be great: Nei∣ther is it that other men should be eased, and you greeued. Wher∣fore we may vnderstand that the faithful may possesse landes of
their owne, and to keepe themselues from begging: against the Anabaptistes, which say, that the Christians ought to take their possessions, and make them common. Saint Paule doeth not 1. Tim. 6. 17. commaunde the riche to leaue their goodes: but that the shoulde not put their trust in them, and to bestowe part of them to them which shal neede. 18 Let thy fountaine be blessed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth. 19 Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleasant Roe: Let her breastes satisfie thee at all times. That wee giue not our honour to the strangers, nor lament for the wasting of our flesh, and our strength, it is not enough that we drinke of our Cesternes, and that they be our owne: but also we must beget lawful children, as Solomon doth commaunde vs, when he saith, Let thy fountaine bee blessed. And truely this is a great blessing of God, when by lawful marriage we haue a mul∣titude of children, as is shewed vs in the Scripture. But sith that in Gen. 1. 12. &. 9. 1. &. 12. &. 22. 17. Psal. 128 lawful mariage there is Gods blessing, it foloweth that in whore∣dome there is nothing but cursednesse: wherefore we are greatly deceiued, if we finde sauour in the droppes of the honny combe of strange women, if we delight to bast and annoint ourselues with the oile of her pallace. Solomon hath wel shewed it vs in the 3. 4. 5. 6. verses of this Chapter. Wee must not then delight in whore∣dome, but rather abhorre it, seing that therin is nothing but cur∣sednesse and euill successe: but with marriage there goeth a bles∣sing: and therefore we shoulde reioyce in the same, as Solomon exhorteth vs, saying, Reioyce with the wife of thy youth, &c. The reioycing that Solomon meaneth, is not, that the married folkes shoulde together with al greedinesse followe the desires of their fleshe and their sensualitie,, taking their pleasures and lustes, after their inordinate concupiscenses: but the ioy that the faith∣ful married folkes ought to haue, is, that they shoulde confesse that it is God that hath knit them together, for to bee vnited in Gen. 2. 33. Mt. 19. 5. such wise that the one shoulde not desire to bee separated from the other: but that in this vnion man shoulde knowe that it is
not good for him to liue alone: and therfore should loue his wife, whom God hath giuen vnto him to be with him, & to help him: The wife also to know that shee hath bin taken out of the side of Ephe. 5. 22. man, & therof made a woman, that she might be an helper to mā: & therfore should giue herselfe wholy to obey her husband. That Heb. 13. 4. Iohn. 2. 2, Gen. 1. 27. they should cōfesse that they are in a very honorable state, as the Sonne of God hath wel declared, and that it commeth not from the inuention of mans braine, but from the most ancient institu∣tion of God. Also that God hath made thē partakers of mariage, to the end that they should possesse their vessels in honor & san∣ctification, 1. Thes 4. 3. & not in vncleannes & filthines. Likewise if they haue linage, that they should acknowledge that they are the organes & instrumēts wherby God doth encrease his word: & by how much as they haue a greater nūber of children, let them reioyce so much the more, confessing that the blessing of God is the more vpon them, & that God doth greatly honor them when they are made fathers & mothers of a great stock. They that want his knowledge & vnderstanding, & which do not so reioyce, though they be ma∣ried, & that they come not neere the gate of the whoremongers & harlots house, & that they haue a number of laweful children, neuertheles yet as touching them, their fountaine is not blessed, but nothing remaineth for them but a curse and maldiction: for vnto the vncleane and infidels nothing is cleane. Therfore if wee Tit. 1. 1. woulde haue our fountaine to bee blessed, we must delight in the woorde of God: the same shal fil vs with ioy, and shal keepe vs from vexing and tormenting vs in our housholdes: but as Solo∣mon doth exhort vs, euery one shal reioyce with his wife, whome he calleth wife of our youth: that is to say, Thy wife that is yong, and whome thou hast taken for thy spouse in thy youth. Solo∣mon speaketh thus, not but that it is lawefull for olde folkes to marry and to reioyce with their yoake fellowe, as Abraham with Ketura: but it is the most common and most meetest for Gen. 25. ▪ men to mary in the flowre of their age: for they loue more ten∣derly, and haue more desire of greate stocke: and so the bles∣sing of God is the more plentifully powred vpon them, where∣of they haue good cause to reioyce. Of these thinges aboue saide wee gather what it is that doeth ingender troubles in the
housholde, to wit, when we follow strange men and strange wo∣men, when we haue no sounde vnderstanding in the worde, and when we ioine not with our equal. 19 Let her be as the louing hinde. Now forasmuch as the wife is the weaker vessel, therfore she should easily be made wilde Gene. 3. 1. Pet. 3. 7. if the husbande did not shew her a louing countenance, and de∣lighted in her, as wee may vnderstande by S. Paule, when hee saith, yee husbands, loue your wiues, and be not bitter vnto them. Col. 3. 13. Solomon is not satisfied for to haue saide vnto vs, reioyce thee with the wife of thy youth: but to teache vs also to conserue and mainteine holy mariage duetifully, hee woulde that wee shoulde shewe vnto our wiues such gentlenes, familiaritie, fauour and friendship, that wee shoulde not giue them any occasion to de∣part away from vs, and to bee afraide of our presence: as doe diuers wilde heads, & raging beastes that handle their wiues as mad and cruel tyrantes. For to teache vs thus to tame our wiues, and to make them to loue our cōpanie, and to take pleasure there∣in, Solomon vseth a similitude, takē of great Lords, which delight to tame wild beasts, to folow thē, & to take meate at their hands: they play with them and sporte with them, and doe what they cā to preserue them, and to keepe them from hurt. Solomon woulde that as noble men behaue themselues toward wild beasts wherin they delight, euen so the husbandes shoulde not delight to tame whoores and drabbes, but that they shoulde loue their wiues so wel, and be so wel pleased with them, that al their earthly pleasure should be to deale in al gentlenes & softnes with them, least they take occasion to waxe wild and to followe knaues. He doeth de∣clare this same vnto vs, when hee saith. Let her bee as thy louing hinde, and pleasant roe: as if hee did say, If a man doe play, if men doe recreate themselues, and passe the tyme with brute beastes which haue no wit nor reasonable vnderstanding, the taming whereof is not needeful, and bringeth vs no profit, it is good reason that men which cannot bee alone, but haue neede of like felowship, shoulde confesse the greate and excellent gift that God doeth graunt them, when God hath giuen them wiues to helpe them, and to reioice, and that euery one should delight & take his recreatiō with his own wife, as did the good Patriarkes. It is not to say that the wiues which the husbands doe thus tenderly loue,
shoulde liue idlely & doe nothing, but take their pleasures and de∣lights. Solomon doth somewhat signifie the same, when he heere cōpareth the wife vnto the Hinde and to the Roe, which are nim∣ble Eph. 5. 22. 1. Tim. 5. 14 I. Tim. 2. 9 1 Pet. 3. 4. beastes to runne. The wife then ought not to bee slouthful, but ready to execute the wil and pleasure of her husband, and dili∣gent to doe the housholde businesse, and to care for the familie. Likewise when Solomon compareth the wife vnto an Hinde, that is a most louing and kinde beast, hee sheweth vnto women that they ought to be of a gentle & quiet spirite. Thus doing ther shalbee no fault in them, that their husbands shoulde not be satisfied with their breastes at all times, as Solomon woulde haue, that is to say, that their husbandes should neuer giue themselues to loue others, to ioyne with them, and to reioyce: but that they content thēselues to loue their wiues, & that their wiues loue thē, & not others. Solomon himselfe doeth so expounde it, when hee sayth, Delight continually in her loue. Heerein, besides that the mar∣ried folkes ought to learne to be chast and shamefast, and to loue one another, and to loue peaceably and quietly togeather, they ought to beholde therein a great gentlenesse and kindnes of God, which hath not onely ordeined marriage for necessitie: but also for ioy and comfort of the parties ioyned together in this holy e∣state, Gen. 24. 67. & 26. 8 Deut. 24. 5 so that it is lawfull vnto the married folkes to receiue them∣selues together with temperance and modestie. It is a parte of Gods blessing that hee sendeth vnto them. Isaac vsed this bene∣diction. 20 For why shouldest thou delight, my sonne, in a strange woman, or imbrace the bosome of a stranger? 21 For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes. There are many which are not content to reioyce with the yoke fellow that God hath giuen them: there are also that regard Heb. 13. 14. not to take a lawefull yoke fellowe in marriage, both these two kindes of people despise the holy ordinance of God, and make but a mocke at marriage, which is honourable amongest all men: for they seeke to haue their sport and pastime, to abuse wiues and
maides: that are vndiscrete, or els to follow them that are alredy so vnshamefast that they care not though they giue themselues to whosoeuer wil. Solomon calleth them Strange women, or Fore∣ners. For to shew that they belong not to those which they fol∣low by contēpt of marriage, and that they ought to haue acquain∣tance with them, nor desire any knowledge of them: And for to shew vs that we must be very carefull to follow the former exhor∣tations, he doth declare vnto vs that he is moued with the desire of our profite, as the father is towardes the sonne. And by that that the greatest part of the world doth easily beleue, that it is but a pastime & sport for to communicate with strangers and fore∣ners, Pro. I.. 2. 3. 8 9. 10. and that in hauing acquaintance with thē, we go not astray: Solomon insisteth mightily to mainteine the contrary, as hee hath doone heere before. It sufficeth him not simply to haue affirmed that men goe out of the way to follow them, but to expresse with a more liuely vehemencie in what danger and sorrow they run in∣to, he asketh, VVhy shouldest thou delite? &c. As if he did say, the way faring men which trauell and walke, doe much feare to wan∣der out of their way and path, although it be but for losse of world¦ly riches, or temporal life: by a more strong reason the sonnes of God which must walke vnto the heauenly inheritance, vnto eter∣nal life, should be careful to looke that they stray not, & that they bee not depriued of these great blessinges, of this happy life: the which they should do, if they followed strangers. Heere aboue hee hath said that they following this trade, do tend vnto destruction. Wherfore for to keep vs frō going astray, he forbiddeth vs to im∣brace the bosome of a forener: by the which kind of speaking, he forbiddeth al whordome, & in speaking so modestly for to make vs fly far from al filthines and vnshamefastnes, hee sheweth vs in Ephe. 5. 12. what abhomination whoremongers and adulterers are before God which follow with algreedines their carnal desires & disor∣dinate affections, when he forbeareth to expresse the vncleannes that they commit. For as also S. Paul saith, It is a shame euen to speake of the things which are doone of them in secret: but yet we may not ceasse to condemne them. Likewise when he forbiddeth vs to imbrace the bosome, he teacheth vs that al vnshamefast tou¦chings are to be condemned: and therfore that we should not bee
deceiued with the scorners that take their pleasures in suche vile∣nesse: let the wiues and maidens which desire to keep their hone∣stie and honour, both before God and men, violently thrust from them such gesters & Diuels incarnate, whersoeuer they shall finde thē. For, to be the true childrē of God, it is not enough to be asha∣med before men, & not to care though God see our filthines, as do many which wil appeare honest before the world, but secretly they care not what they doe, neither wil they once call to remembrance that God seeth them, or if they doe thinke thereof, they feare men more thē God, or els they are so much deceiued, that they iudge that wher mē doth not see thē, there god also beholdeth thē not: or els that they are so foolishe, so corrupted and degenerate, that they beleeue not that there is a God. They professe they knowe Tit. 1. 16. God, but by their workes they denie him. The children of GOD ought to be far frō such pernicious opinions, & ought to behaue thēselues as holily & honestly in secrete, as before men, knowing that God is a witnesse of all their thoughts, willes, purposes, and counsels of their hearts: by a more strong reason then they should not be so voide of vnderstanding, but that they should know how God seeth what they doe, and what others might see. Solomon doth wel teach vs this same, when he saith, 21 For the waies of man, &c. A man enterpriseth and doth many things that are secrete and vnknowne to his neighbors, for he goeth away & hideth himselfe frō them: but whatsoeuer he in ēteth, & how closely soeuer it be doone, yet can he not flie from the presence of the Lord, he cānot so priuily go to work, but God must know his manners & liuing, his workes and operations, al∣though Psal. 139. 12 he doth them in so deepe darknes, that he seeth not him∣selfe. The darknes hideth not from thee: but the night shineth as Esay. 29. 15. the day: the darkenesse and light are both alike. We ought to ac∣knowledge and confesse so: otherwise we are cursed. Woe vnto them that seeke deepe to hide their counsel from the Lorde: for &. 1. their workes are in darknesse, and they say, Who seeth vs? & who knoweth vs? If we thus thinke, wee wel deserue cursing: for wee which are but earth, do rebel against our maker. Your turning of deuises, shal it not be esteemed as the potters clay? For shall the the woorke say of him that made it, hee made mee not?
or the thing formed, say of him that fashioned it, hee had none vnderstanding. But as there are many which shall see their neighbors liue holily & very vprightly, & shew foth good exam∣ple vnto al, and yet wil they neuer marke to consider their good life to follow it, and to amend their faultes: and contrarily, other some which shal see them doe euil, and doe both against God, and their neighbors, wil not once exhort or rebuke them: likewise al∣though they confesse howe God seeth and knoweth all thinges, yet they iudge that God careth not what men doe, whether it bee good or euil: For in this worlde (say they) wee see not that hee dealeth better to the good, then to the wicked, neither that he pu∣nisheth the euil liuers more then the other. For to take away this opinion, Solomon is not contented to say, that the wayes of man, are before the eyes of the Lorde: but hee addeth, and hee ponde∣reth Psal. 94. 7. all his pathes: & yet following their complaint, they say a∣gaine, The Lorde doeth not see it, the God of Iacob doeth not vn∣derstand it. Albeit that the Lord doth wincke at it, yet can he ex∣amine the factes and deedes of euery one, for to allow that which is good, and reiect that which is wicked: as wel as he that trieth and discerneth by the waightes and ballances whether the thing is good or euil, heauie or light. Hee did not foorth with punishe Caine, and left Abell to remaine: but he abstained not to consider both the one and the other, with their doinges, for to giue in due season to euery of them, according to their deedes. The same also is seene in the preseruation of Noe, and in the destruction of the worlde by the vniuersall fludde, by the ouerthrowing of Sodome and deliuerance of Lot, &c. These same ought to teache vs, that God pondereth the paths of euery man, and that as he hath done to them, so also wil hee doe to others in due time, if not in this worlde, yet to the one in eternall life, and to the other, in death euerlasting: as the one are for example of the one, and the second of the other. 22 His owne iniquities shall take the wicked himselfe, & he shalbe holden with the cordes of his owne sinne. 23 He shal die for fault of instruction, & shall goe astray through his great folly.
It is not without cause that Solomon hath beene so careful to exhort vs, as the father the children: let vs not be so wicked as to go astray with the strange woman: for although we think to be close∣ly hidde: by wandring out of the right way, yet God ceaseth not to see vs, and consider our deuises, and wicked enterprises, for to pu∣nish vs at such time as it shal please him. And let vs not thinke that by giuing ourselues to euil, we can escape: For though it were so that God did not take heed vnto the wicked, yet neuertheles they could not be exempted from punishment, seeing they drawe their owne corde, the which they spinne and twist, and pul foorth by per∣seuering to adde iniquitie vnto iniquitie, without remorce of con∣science, with greedinesse of desire: and in the same they proceed so vnaduisedly and amasedly, that they make readie the halter for thē∣selues, and therein are taken, so that they cannot vnloose thēselues, but must be a pray for the Deuil. This is that which Solomon would haue vs to vnderstand, when he saith, the iniquities of the wicked. &c. Heere we see howe Solomon is very careful throughly for to aduertise vs, when one thing often saide, doth not content him, but vseth repetition, for to helpe our ignorance and weakenesse, and to wake vp our negligence: and also to make the wicked lesse excusa∣ble, for contemning the aduertisementes hee giueth them. And when he compareth their iniquities and sinnes vnto cordes, he she∣weth them that they are more miserable then the brute beastes. For the beastes doe not knitte the lines and nettes wherein they are ta∣ken, neither also doe they cast themselues into the net, if they per∣ceiue it, but shunne it: but the wicked doe winde their owne hal∣ters, and also runne into the same to be taken. He sheweth also that they which nothing esteeme the admonitions, corrections and threates that is made vnto them, and become angry and doe defie those which exhorte and rebuke them, asthough they woulde keepe them in bondage, when they woulde asmuch as lieth in them deli∣uer them out of the snares: and they contrarily, willing to deliuer themselues by dissolutenesse and falling away, doe further binde & yelde themselues captiues. For as they which obey and beleeue the word, are vnbounde and deliuered from sinne, from the Deuil from death, and from hel: euen so the rebells are slaues vnto sinne, pry∣soners to the Deuil, holden vnder with the bondes of death and
hel: and so are chained with the cordes of their iniquities. Hee she∣weth, I say, that such people are much deceiued, and are in an euill way, not only when they goe out of the way with the strange wo∣man, but also in what euil soeuer they inuēt with obstinacy & hard∣nes of heart. He hath made a pitte, digged it: and is fallen into the pit that hee made. The wicked is snared in the woorke of his owne Psal. 7. 16. &. 9. 16. hands. To bee shorte, what euil soeuer the wicked doe commit, the same is their destruction and damnation: but they thinke not so, as they shewe it, when by how much as they commit more euil, by so much the more doe they thinke to bee out of danger, as Solomon doth wel signifie it, when he vseth these woordes, shalbe taken, and shalbe holden: And in this they deceiue themselues, as here wee see it: and S. Paul doth wel signifie it vnto vs, when he saith, For when 1. Thessa. 5. 3. they shal say peace, and safetie, then shal come vpon them sodaine destruction, as the trauell vppon a woman with child, and they shal not escape. Besides this, wee must learne in this aduertisement not to bee giuen to haue care to feed the flesh in his lustes & pleasures. For seing that the affection of the flesh is enimitie against God, and cannot be made subiect vnto the law of God, wee cannot take the Rom. 8. 7. pleasures of our flesh, except we wil runne into al wickednesse: and in so doing we twiste our owne ropes wherein wee are taken and holden, wherevppon foloweth our destruction: and thus, the plea∣sures that the wicked take in sinning, doe turne them to greate hurt: for they engender not onely temporal, but also euerlasting death. Solomon doeth threaten them therwith, saying, 23 He shal dye for want of instruction▪ &c. When the promise of eternal life is made vnto those which receiue instructiō to gouerne themselues by wisdome and good discretion, in holines, righteous∣nes, faithfulnesse & truth: It foloweth wel that they which neglect, do wel deserue eternal death: and ought also to vnderstande that when the scripture blameth them for the contempt of instruction, and that it threateneth them with death, that then they cannot looke but for eternal death, except by true repētance they embrace instruction, which before they had despised. For the Lorde wil not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should conuert and liue So∣lomon then saying that the wicked which is without instructiō shal Eze. 18. 32. die, speaketh of euerlasting death, the which the wicked do wel de∣serue
for being without instruction, hee is voide of wisedome, and filled with foolishnes, by the which being caried about, he neither can, nor wil holde the pathe of life, but turneth another way out of the right way, folowing the lustes of his flesh, which is dead, wherof foloweth wel that he is worthy to perish euerlastingly. Here we are taught, that if we wil eschue death and obteine life, we must receiue the instruction that God giueth vs by his worde, by assuring vs of the goodnes and loue of God towardes vs in Iesus Christ, and gi∣uing ourselues to the obedience of his lawes. Heerein standeth the true wisedome of the children of God, the which keepeth thē from going astray and wandring out of the path of life. Wee also doe learne that the greatest part of the world must needs perishe, seeing that it is without instruction: some, for that they are deceiued by superstition and idolatrie, other some for that they receiue lesinges for trueth. And which worst is, there are many to whome godly instruction is offered, but because they are without religion, they contemne the instru∣ction, and doe nothing but skorne it, and so much as they can, doe persecute it.
The sixth Chapter. 1 MY Sonne, if thou bee suretie for thy neighbour, and hast stricken hands with the stranger: 2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth: thou art e∣uen taken with the words of thine owne mouth. 3 Doe this now, my sonne, and deliuer thy selfe: seeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & hum∣ble thy selfe, and solicite thy friendes. 4 Giue no sleepe to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eye liddes. 5 Deliuer thy selfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler. IT seemeth at the first sight, howe Solomon goeth about to diswade vs from answering or to become pledge or surety for our neighbors. For there is none of vs that would be intangled, or in subiection and bondage to another, but al natu∣rally desire to be free, and to vse the power that God hath giuen vs at our owne wil: but Solomon doth tel vs that we are captiues, if so beit wee become pledges and sure∣ties for our neighbour. But to the end that we should not doe this iniurie vnto Solomon, to charge him that hee woulde diswade vs from doing the workes of charitie, wee must diligently marke vp∣pon what condition hee woulde not haue vs to giue our hande to bee pledge for the straunger, and also to wit, why he woulde that wee shoulde not redeeme our neighbours. For the first parte, wee must not bee ignorant, that euery man, how strange or vnknowne soeuer hee bee, is our neighbour. Nowe hee Chapt. 5. 8. & . 10. hath exhorted vs heere aboue, that our way should be far vnlike to the same of the strange womā, &c. That we should not giue, &c.
And it may happen, that if wee bee not discrete, wee shalbe suretie for such as borrowe, that they may mainteine whores: and in this manner wee should giue our honour vnto strangers, &c. and our fountaines shoulde not bee ours only, but the strangers with vs. And therfore we must vnderstand that Solomon doeth aduertise vs by these words, that we should not be hastie in pledging our neigh∣bour, except we know him wel, and also know that it is needful, and that by so doing we shal not bring our familie into such extremitie as it should be compelled to begge their bread, & that we ourselues should not be troubled therby. For although that it be commanded vs to loue our neighbour as ourselues, and to assist him with ours: Leui. 19. 18. 2. Cor. 8. 13. yet it is not commanded vs to ease others to bring ourselues in di∣stresse. As touching the second point, Solomon woulde not haue vs to be suretie for our neighbour, because that they which are intan∣gled & bound for an other, oftentimes are led with some vaine cō∣fidence, or pride and ostentation. They put their trust in him whom they pledge, or else they wil declare thēselues, that it may be knowen they haue the abilitie, and a noble and liberal hart, and that they are bold to venture the same. And also Solomon doth not allow vs one to be pledge for another, because that most often the same commeth not of loue; for some labour to maintein their credite, and to make their profit with the rich and mighty, or els to set forth their parēts, kindred, and familiars: but in the end they find themselues more de∣ceiued & beguiled then were to be wished. And herein we may say that he hath an eye to that which is said in the Psalmes, It is better Psal. 118. 8. & 146. 3. &. 27. 10. to trust in the Lord, then to haue confidence in man. Put not your trust in Princes, nor in the sonne of any man, for there is no helpe in him. Again, Though my father & mother should forsake me, yet the Lord wil gather me vp. Ieremy also saith, Cursed be the mā, that tru∣steth Iere. 17. 5. in man, & maketh flesh his arme, & withdraweth his hart frō the Lord &c. Solomon would not keepe vs then from pledging our neighbor, when need is, & as our power is able: but to the end that we should take good heed to become surety indifferently for al men that shal require vs, hee sheweth vs into what danger we cast our¦selues, saying, that we are snared, that we are taken by the wordes of our mouth, that is to say, that we are so straightly bound & char∣ged, that if they for whome we are suretie bee not able to pay, that
we stande bounde both before God and men to satisfie the parties to whome we haue giuen our hand, by answering for another. And so doing, we haue taken no smal matter vpon vs, as Solomon doeth shewe by the counsel he giueth vs for it, saying, 3 Nowe do this, &c. He doth counsel vs to get ourselues de∣liuered from the power of our neighbor, in this that we are become suretie for another, and for to bring it to pas, wee should not dwel quietly at home, without care, but with speede to go towardes him, whose hande we haue stricken in being pledge to him for another: and humbly to prostrate ourselues before him, requiring him to haue patience, confessing ourselues detters vnto him, and in the meane while that we should not suffer him whome wee haue pled∣ged to sleepe as it is said: but to presse him and cal vpon him to pay his dette with al diligence. When Solomon speaketh after this sort, he sheweth wel the danger, and yet doth expresse it further, whē he would not in any wise haue vs to sleepe, saying, 4 Giue no sleepe to thine eyes. And yet for to expresse the ne∣cessitie more, he sheweth that they which become sureties, doe not only bring their goods in dāger, but their persons also: for he saith, 5 Deliuer thy selfe, &c. When he cōpareth man vnto a Doe and a byrd, he sheweth that if he become suretie or pledge for ano∣ther, that it behoueth him to be diligent. And when hee, to whome they stand bound, is likened vnto an hunter and fouler, he sheweth that the pledge standeth not in safetie of his person, but eyther in satisfying of the dette, or sauing himselfe from his handes. And thus it is not without cause that Solomon laboureth to turne man away from being suretie. Hee endeuoureth to counsel him to pro∣uide for his familie, and that he bring not himself into such necessi∣tie, that both he and his housholde come to distresse, and to be con∣strained to come into bondage or perish. Hee wil not keepe backe any man, (according to his abilitie) from dooing good to his needy neighbour, seing that he hath praised and commended woorkes of charitie, and heere after wil commende them, euen towardes our e∣nemies. We may then learne to be prudent and discrete in the go∣uernement of ourselues, of our familie, and of our goods, and yet without feare that the earth shoulde fayle vs: as the niggardes and couetous, which wil doe pleasure to none, for feare their goods
should diminish: and make themselues beleeue that the goods they possesse, are so theirs, that they ought not to distribute any thing out of their house. Wee may learne againe not to be careful for to morowe, when without distrusting the prouidence of God, and without doing wrong to our neighbour, wee bee careful & diligent to keepe ourselues from extremities, and from begging, or to come in harde bondage and captiuitie. When Solomon doth aduertise vs of this care and diligence, for to shew vs, that we must in no wise be slacke, he fordiddeth vs to giue sleepe, &c. Not that hee woulde not haue vs sleepe, after we haue watched and laboured in the day, see∣ing that the sleepe is a part of this that we need in this present life. Only by this maner of speeche he doth admonish vs that we should not be sluggish and negligent, there where need is of labouring, to deliuer ourselues out of trouble. Nowe if for the keeping of our goods and bodies we be admonished to haue such care, wee ought wel to vnderstand by a more strong reason, that our diligence ought to bee great, when it toucheth the preseruation of our soules, and of those that are committed to our charge: as are the magistrates, which ought to take order that in their countrie and iurisdiction the offences should be taken away, &c. the fathers and mothers ca∣reful that their children should be wel taught to liue in the feare of God, and to gouerne themselues in good and honest maners: those which bring and offer children to be baptized, to bee diligent to ac∣complish that which they promise, chiefly when the children are fatherles, and want good guyding: but aboue al it belongeth vnto the ministers of the woord to bee vigilant to gouerne themselues so holily, that they offend no mā, that they should be careful to preach the sincere truth, to admonish, to reproue and correct, that by their ministery they may winne the soules of the people of God, so much as in them lieth, &c. 6 Go to the pismire, o sluggard: behold her waies, & be wise. 7 For she hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler: 8 Prepareth her meate in the sommer, and gathereth her foode in the haruest. Because he hath admonished him that doth become surety and pledge for another, to be diligēt to deliuer himselfe from the danger
whereinto hee is brought: knowing that there are many negligent and slouthful, which haue no care to doe that which belongeth to the good prouision of the houshold and familie, he hath taken oc∣casion to direct himselfe generally to the slouthful, to counsel them what they should do▪ he blameth and rebuketh them, & sheweth them the miserie that shal happen vnto them, except they forsake sluggishnes, & apply thēselues to yeeld their duetie, & be quicke to do their office. Nowe this is the custome to put those that are not wel learned, (& whose profit and furtherance we desire) vnto some good maister to be taught: their maisters giue thē warning to marke wel what is said vnto them, that afterwards they may gouerne thē∣selues wisely in their housholdes, according as they shal haue lear∣ned of their maisters. So Solomon desiring the profit of the slouth∣ful, sendeth him vnto a Maister, saying, Go to the Pismire, o slug∣gard. He exhorteth vs to regarde that which we haue seene done of the ante or pismire, that he learne to gouerne himselfe wisely in his affaires: for he saith, and be wise. The sluggards ought to gaue great shame and bashfulnes, when Solomon sendeth them vnto a beast so litle and so weake, and would haue them to learne of her: & herein he maketh them as it were subiect vnto this litle beast, the which not only ought to be subiect vnto them, but also al the beasts of the world, though they were neuer so wild and cruel, as the woorde of God doth teache vs. But the Image of God hath bin blotted out in vs by sinne: also we haue not such lordship & rule ouer the beastes as was giuen vnto vs at the beginning: for there are that ryse vp a∣gainst man as the great wild beasts: there are also very smal that do trouble man both in his body and goods. Though there were no o∣ther thing but that the sluggards are made after the ymage of God, & that the pismire is a litle feeble beast, they ought to bee ashamed that the wise man sendeth them to consider his workemanship, to learne wisdome and wel to gouerne their houses and families: but forasmuch as this weake beast doth his busines without constraint, and without guide of other, & maketh prouision for that which is necessarie for him, folowing this natural inclination and this feeling that it hath of God, and by the same of herselfe laboureth & wor∣keth with al diligence: & the sluggish, besides the natural sight that they haue receiued of God, wherby they ought to bee gouerned of
themselues to work and to set themselues to labour, haue their pa∣rents and neighbours, whose example and counsel they shoulde fo∣low: they haue maister workmen & labourers, of whome they may learne to do the necessarie woorks of this life. Besides this, there are the lawes of the Magistrates for to compel their subiects to labour. The pismire hath no such gouernement, (as is said) For she hauing no guide, &c. This ought to giue occasion vnto the slouthful to bee greatly confoūded & to yeld with shame, & to be voide of boldnes to appeare before men: for though they haue so many kindes of guides, yet they folow none of thē. And albeit that this litle beast & pismire hath no maner of guide, yet doth she folow her natural in∣clination. 8 Prepareth her meate, &c. But what shame soeuer the slouth∣ful ought to haue (forasmuch as it is better to haue shame then to haue losse,) yet to make their profit, they must folowe the counsel of Solomon, that they suffer not their goods to be lost, for want of la∣bouring, & to come in danger of begging or to die with hunger for want of gathering and locking vp of their goods in season and time conuenient. Labouring is a thing ordeined of God from the begin∣ning, Gen. 2. 15. & 8. 22. and the tymes for the same appointed. They then that labour, and bestow their trauail and paine, do fulfil the commandement of God, and those that reape after they haue sowne, and doe lock them vp for to spend them, when & where as need shal require, do wisely and please God, not despising his blessing. Contrarily, the sluggardes are rebelles and disobedient vnto God, they doe foolishly, not ac∣knowledging the blessing of God. They that woorke according to the time, are worthy to eate their dayly bread: but the slouthful de∣serue to dye with hunger, and if they doe eate, they liue of stealth: for they eate the bread of others. And therefore it is not without cause that Solomon doeth reprooue them, and laboureth to awake them vp, saying, 9 Howe long wilt thou sleepe, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleepe? 10 Yet a litle sleepe, a litle slumber, a litle folding of the handes to sleepe. 11 Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy necessitie like an armed man.
When a man lyeth not long, but is quicke to rise vp, at a due & conueniēt houre, after his reasonable sleepe: then is he coūted care∣ful and diligent. Contrarily, he which desireth to lye and sleepe out of measure, & willingly standeth not vp, when it is time thertoo, is esteemed careles and sluggish: and also the bed & too much sleepe, make a man heauie & dul witted: and this is the cause why Solomō noteth expresly a sluggard, by his lying downe and excessiue sleepe. And this vpon good cause, for the sluggish not onely are vnprofita∣ble vnto their neighbours, as experience teacheth: but also they bring hurt vnto themselues, by not taking heede and preuenting of the miseries which are at hand to catche them. Solomon doeth wel declare it vnto them, when in mocking at their maner of dealings & opinions, he saith, 10 Yet a litle sleepe, &c. Forasmuch as it is lawful to take our rest and sleepe, for better to be disposed afterwardes to folowe our calling. Solomon speaketh not to them that sleepe a litle, and as neede requireth: but to them which sleepe too much, and yet he speaketh but of a litle sleepe, and of a litle slumber: and in this ma∣ner hee expresseth the saying and opinion of the slouthful: for al∣beit they are too much giuē to sleepe, and that they fold their hands longer then were needful, yet asthough they had greate desire to watche and to labour, they wil say, let mee sleepe yet a litle, let mee lye yet a litle while, and so make themselues beleeue they sleepe not long. But thus doing, they deceiue themselues, and take their hurte, As Solomon telleth them, 11 Therfore thy pouertie commeth on &c. No man know∣eth what time the man wil come to his inne that is on the way: e∣uen so is pouertie which hapneth to the slouthful. If wee shal meete a theefe on the way which is wel armed, which shal not very easily put him backe, but rather he wil resist, and also wil with such vio∣lence & fiercenes assault vs, that we shal not escape without leesing our purse, or without beeing wounded to death: In this sorte the slouthful are assaulted with pouertie. Beholde howe Solomon ex∣horteth the sluggards, howe he doth rebuke them, and aduertise them of the euil that they deserue. But vpon the admonition wher∣by hee woulde haue them to bee like vnto the pismire that gathe∣reth &c. It seemeth at the first sight that hee is contrarie vnto Ie∣sus
Christ, who saieth vnto vs, Bee not careful for your life, what ye shal eate, or what yee shal drinke: nor yet for your bodies, what Mat. 66. 2. yee shal put on, &c. Beholde the soules of the ayre, &c. I an∣swere, That Solomon laboureth not by his doctrine to make vs careful. for albeeit the pismire doeth labour, yet is hee not carefull: but hee woulde that wee shoulde occupie our persons about that whereunto they are ordeined of God, and that wee suffer not the goods to bee lost that hee hath giuen vs. Also our Lorde Iesus Christ doeth not forbid vs to bee careful, diligent, and laborious, for he doth not teache vs that we should waste the goods that hee hath giuen vs, and that wee shoulde neglect to gather them & locke them vp: but hee laboureth to take from vs niggardlines and distrust of Gods prouidence, whereunto wee must wholy referre the goods that God hath sent vs by labouring and fast keeping. For if God do not blesse our labour, it cannot prosper. And if we must not bee Psa. 127. 1. slouthful to labour, to reape and locking vp of our goods for to mainteine this life: by a more strong reason wee must bee careful to labour for our soules, and to gather the spiritual haruest. Likewise when Solomon saieth, hee hath no felowe, &c. Hee admonisheth al Magistrates not to suffer their subiectes to bee negligent, and to eate their bread with ydlenesse, albeeit they haue riches, and that af∣ter the iudgement of the flesh, they haue no neede to labour. Fur∣thermore if the sluggards be reproued and blamed, because that by their trade of liuing they are in danger to fal into pouertie: by a stronger reason wee may blame the pilferers and stealers and coue∣tous, and vsurers and bribetakers, and they which wil not declare the right case for feare of displeasure. For no thank to them though the poore perish not: but they themselues shal fal into such pouertie that they shal not haue a droppe of water. 12 The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth. 13 He maketh a signe with his eyes, hee signifieth with his feete: he instructeth with his fingers: 14 Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiseth vp contentions.
15 Therfore shal his destruction come speedily: hee shalbe destroyed sodainly without recouery. For to make vs haue the slouthful and slouthfulnesse in horror and detestation which he hath blamed and threatened with pouer∣tie and sodaine wante, he sheweth vs the wickednes whereunto the negligent are giuen, to the end that we should know that not onely they hurt themselues, but also hurt their neighbours: for often the man which spendeth not the tyme to doe any good woorke, is a songe creux a diuiser of malice, and doeth change and disguise him∣selfe into diuers manners, in deuising euil against his neigbours. Al∣beit neuerthelesse because of the greate number of the slouthful, which are froward, it might be said that Solomō taketh occasion to describe the wickednes of the froward & their sodain destructiō in these 12. 13. 14. & 15. verses: Yet the matter that hee speaketh of here, may be applied vnto the slouthful, at the lest to the most parte. For when the spirit of man cānot be ydle, but wil be occupied about something, seeing that the slouthful doe nothing that is any thing woorth, and bringeth no profit vnto their neighbors, it must needs folowe that they giue themselues vnto euil and to doe hurte. Wee may then say that whome hee calleth slouthful, hee calleth nowe an vnthriftie and wicked man: the which appellations and names a∣gree right wel with the slouthful: for sith he doeth nothing that is any thing woorth, it must needs followe hee is wicked. For ey∣ther make the tree good, and his frute good: or else make the tree euil, and his frute euil. &c. Thus it is yll spoken, when we say Math. 12. 33. of an vnprofitable man, that hee is woorth a good morow, when wee see not openly that hee hurteth: seeing that it is necessary that a man must profite if hee bee good. Likewise the twoo woordes which Solomon vseth heere in his Hebrue tongue is very meete for the slouthful. For Beliiaall, is a woorde compounded, which signifieth as much as without profit or vnprofitable: and the other woorde that is, Auen, signifieth sometimes vanitie, ly∣ing and a thing of nothing. These titles heere, as wee knowe, are very meete for the slouthful. For can a man finde any thing more vnprofitable, more vaine, and lesse woorth then sluggardes? But whether soeuer we apply these words, either to the slouthflul, or
generally vnto al frowarde and wicked, Solomon doeth wel shew it that they are very dangerous, when hee declareth vnto vs their malice, their corrupt manners, their wicked and vngodly kinde of life. Hee beginneth with the mouth, and doth attribute feere vnto the same, not that they go right, neither whereas they ought, nei∣ther that they hast to doe wel and to helpe their neighbours, but feere that go cleane contrary to that which they shoulde: for hee saith, that the wicked and frowarde doeth walke with a frowarde mouth, the which hee hath forbidden to the children of God. Thus the slouthful and other wicked doe not keepe the path of wel spea∣king vnto the honour and praise of God: but as they are vnprofi∣table and vaine, so doe they giue their mouthes to take the name of God in vaine. For beeing ydle, they labour to take some recreations according vnto their desire, the which are ful of vanitie. Where∣fore, out of the abundance of their vaine hartes, they speake vani∣tie in al dissolutenesse and abhomination, in mingling the name of GOD in their iestes, in blaspheming him, in singing dishonest songes, and speaking wantonly. Also they hold not the way of well speaking of their neighbours: but as they are frowarde and wic∣ked, euen so by their words they labour not but maliciously, and wickedly to hurte, and to hinder their neighbours by slandering, by bearing false witnesse against them, and in swearing to their losse. This is more prooued then is needeful, that the ydle and slouthful do gouerne themselues thus simplie, euen in al estates. &c. 13 Hee maketh a signe, &c. Because that the frowarde and wicked man would not bee knowne nor counted such, it is needful for him that hee often holde his peace: for seeing that hee is euil, he cannot continue speaking wel: and so his malice shoulde bee too much seene against his wil: and for this cause somewhat to hyde himselfe, he disguiseth and vseth dissimulation and fainednesse, hee conterfaiteth and turneth himselfe nowe on this sorte, and then of another. Solomon doth signifie the same by the signe of the eyes, by the speaking of the feete, and by the token of the fingers. The fro∣ward & the wicked do thus counterfaite themselues in diuers sorts, byting in their woordes: for albeeit they haue no desire, but to
speake wickedly, yet doe they spare to speake, because they woulde not bee knowen, and yet notwithstanding cannot keepe in, but that they giue some signification of their malice vnto their fellowes, or els dissemble somewhat to deceiue those which they wil drawe vn∣to their wickednesse. If they would in no wise bee knowne, Solo∣mon woulde not expresse their fictions and coulorings by signe, woorde, and token. For they which doe signe, speake, and shew, do not seeke to be vnderstood: but the wicked giueth the watch word (as it is sayde) they haue their tokens and manners of dooinges whereby one of them may be knowen to another, & what is to bee done, that they may catche and beguile them which are none of their companie, or winne others to consent vnto them. 14 Lewde things are in his harte, &c. Wee must not maruell though the frowarde and wicked haue such manners and customes: for there cannot come any other thing out of the sacke, then that which is within: The frowarde, as Solomon saieth, are stuffed at the hart, not with one malice alone, but with diuers: for lewde things are in their heartes: and albeeit that no man seeketh to doo them hurte, yet is their hearte so poysoned and embrued with lewde thinges, that they can neuer cease from thinking and seeking meanes howe they may execute their displeasure, for to hurte them which doe them no wrong. Solomon doeth wel expresse it, when hee saieth that hee ymagineth euil at all tymes. Nowe the euil that they ymagine, is to set al in troubles and confusion by dissention that they stirre vp through the frowardnesse of their mouthes, by their dissimulations, and by the lew denesse of their heartes. Solo∣mon doeth signifie the same, saying, That they rayse vp contenti∣ons. But as they deuise the destruction of their neighbours, euen so, also sooner then they thinke of, they shalbee destroyed without remedie, as he saith, 15 Therfore shal his, &c. Howe the wicked after alitle time of prosperitie, at the last fal into destruction, is in other places very Psa. 7. &. 37. Pro. 1. 26. wel described. 16 These sixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his soule ab∣horreth seuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that shed innocent blood, 18 An heart that ymagineth wicked enterprises, feete that be swift in running to mischiefe, 19 A false witnes that speaketh lies, & him that rayseth vp contentions amongst brethren. It is a thing that wee ought not to doute of, that the thing which pleaseth not God, cannot long endure. Wherfore we must not wonder though the destruction of the froward and wicked shal sodenly fall without any helpe. Hee pleaseth not God; therefore hee doeth abhominable things. Solomon hath something touched it before: hee saide that hee shoulde bee destroied, that hee shoulde bee sodenly strocken: but for to shewe that it cannot otherwise bee done, hee declareth vnto vs more amply what are the manners and customes of the frowarde and wicked, and doeth affirme vnto vs that they are much displeasing vnto God. And for to begin this declaration, hee saieth, There are sixe things that God abhorreth: & as if he had not expressed a number sufficient, he correcteth him∣selfe, saying that there are seuen: and as if the hatred were not y∣nough for to shew that the frowarde and wicked deserueth wel to be destroied, and that his liuing is not acceptable vnto God, hee ad∣deth, that God abhorreth them. And forasmuch as in God we liue Acts. 17. 28. and haue our beeing, it is necessary that what hee hateth and ab∣horreth must come to decay, verse, 12. Nowe as heere before hee hath noted the frowarde and the wicked by his mouth, eyes, feete, and handes or fingers, and by his heart, and by the con∣tentions: euen so nowe for to shewe that it is necessarie hee perish, hee declareth that God hateth and detesteth these thinges, not that God is ledde with troubled affections, as men which are often ledde as their affections doe carrie them. GOD neuer changeth, but in all thinges hee woorketh according as hee hath determined from euerlasting and before the foundation of the worlde was laide. Hee proceedeth not then by hatred and anger to destroy the wicked but because that they which he destroieth and ouerthrow∣eth according as they haue deserued, doe feele him as if hee hated them, the Scripture doeth attribute hatred vnto him, as the trans∣gressor
wil deeme of the iudge that sendeth him vnto the gallowes. Also albeeit that God hath not a soule distinct from the rest of his substance and essence (for there is nothing in him that can be parted nor diuided, as the man which is compounded of a soule and a body, the which may bee separated by temporall death) yet the scripture doeth attribure a soule vnto him, where with hee loueth the righteous, and hateth and detesteth the wicked, that the good may learne that the promises of life are not made vntoo them faynedly and coulorably: and the wicked shoulde knowe that it is no play nor pastime, when they are threatened with death and damnation. &c. 17 The hautie eyes, &c. The first thing of the seuen that the Lord hateth and abhorreth are the hautie eyes, the which are proude, the which not onely praise themselues, so much til they disdaine & con∣temne others: but also do so assure themselues in their wickednesse, that they haue no feare of God, nor reuerence to his word. The Zo∣domites were thus high minded. The Lord hath wel shewed that he Gene. 13. 13. &. 18 20. Eze. 16. 49. Gene. 19. 24. Esay. 2. 11. & 3 15. &. 5. 21. Luk. 16. 15. 24 abhorred their pride, whē he ouerthrew thē. He declareth the same in Esay. Also our Lord declareth the same in Luke: for that which is highly esteemed among men, is abhomination in the sight of God. The riche glutton likewise which was cloathed in purple and silke, &c. doeth shewe vs right wel that the proude are much hated with God, and are of him abhorred, when hee was throwne headlong into hel into such extremitie that hee coulde not obteine a drop of water, &c. God did wel shewe vnto Nabuchadnezar that hee detested pride, &c. But nowe albeeit that GOD doeth not dayly shewe vn∣to vs such examples of his hatred against the high minded and proude persons, it is not therefore to say, that GOD doeth not alwaies hate and abhorre them, and that they shoulde feele the same at the time appointed, as the examples and threat∣ninges are conteined in the scripture. Hee condemned Dan. 4. 28. . Pet. 2. 6. & 9. & 3. 9. the Citties of Sodome and Gomorrha to vtter ouerthrowe. The Lorde knoweth howe to deliuer the faithful out of temp∣tation. The Lorde is not slacke concerning his promise: and though the Lorde doeth punishe the proude immediatly▪ let vs not waxe obstinate in our sinnes by contemning of his threateninges.
Let vs not be like vnto these scorners now, now, I say, that wee are come to the last times, which say, Where is the promise of his com∣ming? 2. Pet. 3. 4. For since the fathers died, al things cōtinue alike frō the be∣ginning. Those which speake & think so, shall at the last feele that they stroue against god, that they haue opened their mouths against the holy one of Israel, and haue blasphemed. And seeing that God doeth declare vs these thinges by his worde, if in steede of fearing that wee bee in his displeasure, wee woulde bee assured of his loue, and fauour towardes vs: if in steede of fearing that hee abhorreth vs, wee woulde bee ascertained that wee please him, and are accep∣table vnto him, let vs humblie cast downe our eyes in fearing to of∣fende him, in trembling at his worde, and not seeking after high thinges, &c. Thus doing wee may protest with Dauid, Lord, my heart is not hautie, neither are mine eies loftie, neither haue I wal∣ked Psal. 131. 1. Rom 12. 16. in great matters, and hid from mee. And so farre of shall our destruction bee, and that wee shoulde be stricken downe, that wee shal rather bee exalted, and preserued safe and sounde: for whosoe∣uer humbleth himselfe, shalbe exalted: For the Lorde is nigh vnto thē that are contrite and desolate, &c: Not that we deserue it, but it is his good pleasure to giue vs this grace, Submit yourselues one vn 1 Pet. 5. 5. to another: Deck yourselues inwardly with lowlinesse of minde: for God resisteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble. Secōd∣ly, he hateth and abhorreth a Lying tongue, a false and vnfaithfull tongue, a tongue that speaketh deceitfully and craftily, & not with∣out cause: for sith that he is faithfull and true, euen trueth it selfe, we ought to vnderstand that he cannot abide lying, but wil punishe it, most seuerely and sharpely, in the time that hee shal thinke conue∣nient. The Lorde shal destroy them that speake lyes. When GOD Psal. 5. 6. is so much mooued and offended with falsenesse and lying, that hee threatneth the deceiptful and liers with so sharp a punishment, they which haue the charge to leade the people vnto saluation, and to keepe the same from perishing, so much as lyeth in them, ought to bee greeuously tormented in their mindes, seeing that falsenesse and vnfaithfulnesse, deceit and lying, are so commonly vsed in the world, not onely amongest them which want the worde of God. Psal. 12. 1. but also amongest them which dare well bragge that they are re∣fourmed according to the Gospell. For them chiefly shoulde the
Ministers bee most greeued according too the example of Ieremie. Iere. 9. 2. Besides this cause, wee may marke others, whereof the least being considered shal suffice, for to iudge and discerne that GOD hath good cause to hate a false tongue and to abhorre it. The tongue is one of the highest members of the body, & not of it selfe, for the Lorde hath placed euery mēber in the body, as it hath pleased him. 1. Cor. 12. 18 The tongue then as the rest of the members ought too bee applied for a weapon of righteousnesse vnto God: and if it bee false and ly∣ing, it is a weapon of iniquitie vnto sinne: and so it is a rebel a∣gainst his maker. Wherefore hee rightly hateth it and abhorreth it. But to make our tongues to bee weapons of righteousnesse vnto Psal. 34. 1. &. 35. 28. &. 5. 4 God, wee must applie them to that which the Psalmist promiseth, I will alwaies giue thankes vnto the Lorde: his praise shalbee in my mouth continually: And my tongue shal vtter thy righteousnes and thy prayse euery day. Contrarily, if we apply them vnto deceit and lying, then are they weapons of iniquitie, the which pleaseth not God, for thou art not a God which louest wickednesse: neither shal euil dwel with thee. And this is vpon good right, for such peo∣ple are not onely rebelles against men, but against God also: for in them there is no righteousnesse. If then wee wil vse our tongues Psal. 50. 14. wel, wee must giue them to praise God: as wee are taught, Offer vnto God praise, &c. And for to do this wel, wee must abstaine frō offending our neighbours either indeede or in wordes: For God hath saide vnto the wicked, What hast thou to doe to declare mine ordināces, that thou shouldest take my couenant in thy mouth, see∣ing thou hatest to be refourmed? Now as touching ourselues, and the corruption of our nature, we are all such, we must therfore pray that God woulde haue mercy vpp on vs, and open our lippes, and therewith let vs followe the exhortation of S. Paule, Wherfore cast away lying, and speake euery man trueth vnto his neigbour. Heere∣by Psal. 51. 17. Ephe. 4. 24. we may vnderstand, that if wee haue a false tongue, first of all, we are vnthankefull vnto God, not confessing that hee hath giuen vs a wel spoken tongue, and not a dumbe, as vnto beastes. Secondly, that wee are more vnreasonable then the beastes, when we vse our tongues against the ordinance of GOD, the which beastes wil not doe: and so wee are rebelles and vnfaithful vnto GOD.
Thirdly, that we are traitours vnto our brethren. These three rea∣sons wel considered, wee must not maruell though God abhorre a false tongue. For hee hath well shewed it vnto his people of Israel. In Iosua, wee may see that Balaam was slaine for hauing solde his Num. 11. 1. &. 14. 27. & 16 32. Iosua. 13. 22 1. Kin. 18. 40 Psal. 109. 2. Mat. 27. 5 Act. 5. 5 tongue to curse the people of God: The Prophetes of Baal were slaine, Iudas Iscarioth (of whome it was spoken. The mouth of the wicked, and the mouth ful of deceit are opened vpon me) hath tri∣ed that God hateth a false tongue, when he hanged himselfe. Like∣wise haue Ananias and Sapphira. And forasmuche as there is no exception of persons before God, all false tongues must looke for destruction and damnation. Nowe in the third place, the Lorde hateth and abhorreth, the handes that shead innocent blood: that is to say, them which doe wrong and extortion vnto their neighbours, either in their persons or goods, causelesse, and that their neighbours haue not offended them, nor done any wrong: such kinde of people are mur∣therers and mensleaers, theeues & robbers, stealers, and rauishers, the couetous and vsurers, grasiers, and engrossers of corne and vit∣taile, to make the same deere, and they which by vnlawful meanes doe drawe vnto themselues the substance of their neighbours: in suche wise, that there is no thankes due to them, though their neighbours doe not miserablie perishe. The Lorde God hath wel shewed the same to Caine, to Pharao, to Saule which persecuted Gen. 4. 9. Exo. 12. 12. 29. &. 14. 24. 1. Sam. 22. 17. & 31. 4. 2. Sam. 11. 4. 15. & 12. 10. 1. King. 21. 19. Gene. 9. 7. Esay. 1. 15. & 3. 13. 14. &. 59. 3. Mat. 3. 2. 3. 10. & 7. 2. Dauid, and caused the priestes to be slaine, when hee slue himselfe: vnto Dauid also which had rauished the wife of his faithful seruāt, and committed execrable murther. For the which it was saide vnto him, nowe therfore the sworde shal neuer depart from thine house. Vnto Achab: But it is not without cause that God doeth abhorre the murtherers: for this sentence was pronounced therof long agoe, Who so sheadeth mans blood, by man shal his blood bee shed. As touching rauishings, by what meanes & in what sort soeuer they be done, the Lord sheweth wel that he doth abhorre thē, whē he coun∣teth thē murtherers & manquellers. And to the ende that wee de∣ceiue not ourselues, in condēning such people, & iustifie ourselues for that wee be no poulers, and yet, for al that wee care nothing for the poore: let vs knowe that such as haue the riches of this world,
and doe not distribute them vntoo the poore needy, are counted in the number of murtherers. 1. Ioh. 3. 19 18 An heart that imagineth wicked enterprises. This same is the fourth thing that God hateth and abhorreth. Now forasmuch as it is not without cause that the Lorde hateth and de∣testeth these three things aforesaid, it is no meruaile though he haue this fourth in abhomination also: for out of this spring doth al euil proceede. Wee may partly knowe the same, by that that Adam was rebuked, first for obeing his wife, and for eating of the fruite, Gen. 3. 17. &. . 5. forbidden. But it is more plainely shewed, where as GOD com∣plaineth of the imagination of mans hearte: and when Iesus Christ sayeth, Out of the heart come euil thoughts, murthers, a∣dulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies and slaunders: and Saint Paule sayeth, This I say therefore, and testifie in the Lorde, Mat. 15. 19. Ephe. 4. 17. that yee hencefoorth walke not as other Gentiles walke, in vanities of their mindes, &c. Many men wil hate and abhorre the foresaide three thinges, because they see and knowe that they are hurt∣full vnto them: but fewe wil hate and abhorre the hearte: for they see no further then the face, and cannot pearce vnto the heart, nor iudge no further therof then they see the fruites, which are the wordes and workes: But God who created al thinges, knoweth his 1. Sam. 16. 7. Psal. 7. 10. Ier. 17. 10. creatures aswel within, as without, hee pearceth euen vnto the bot∣tome of the heartes, wherin there is nothing conteined but he seeth it. And seeing hee is the God, who is pleased with equitic and vp∣rightnesse, goodnesse and true dealing, nowe if the heart of man is giuen to any thing contrarily, and that hee wil not bee conuer∣ted, and apply the same vnto goodnesse, it is vnpossible but GOD must hate him, and abhorre him: whereof foloweth the destruction of man. I say expressely, which is giuen, &c. Because that albeeit euery man hath an euil harte, yet is hee not hated of GOD; neither of him abhorred, when he is displeased with his wickednesse. Psa. 51. 19. Esay. 66. 2. We may here iudge that there are many people which thinke very much of themselues, but their estimation doth profit thē but a litle: for they are hated of God: and contrarily that many are despised, to whome their contempt bringeth no hurt, because they are beloued of GOD and doe please him. In the fift place, The feete,
that be swift in running to mischiefe: That is to say, the raging & boyling affections which carry away a man in such wise that he ca∣reth not what he doeth, so that he may bring to passe for to hurte his neighbours, and to worke the mischiefe that he desireth. And herein he compareth such affectiōs vnto a furious madde man, that hath nothing in him but hast to execute his anger. Hee will forget all other necessary and profitable affaires for to followe his wicked enterprise, and will bee content to suffer great losse, & to take great hurt on euery side,, that he may execute his foolish fantasie: Like∣wise the froward and wicked haue none other thing in their minde, but onely their displeasures, their wicked enterprises, but no minde, on the feare of God, no desire to reuerence his worde, no feeling of the heauenly kingdome, nor hope of euerlasting life. In this sorte they haue a greatlosse, for to pursue a thing of nothing, and hurtful. Nowe although that all men, how righteous soeuer they bee, haue euill motions tending to euill, as may be gathered when our Lorde Iesus Christ, saith, He that is washed, needeth not, saue to washe Iohn. 13. 1 his feete: wee ought not to vnderstande that Solomon woulde en∣close the affections of them that are washed vnder the hatred & ab∣horring of the Lord. For albeit the carnall affections tend to euil yet doe they not suffer them to post and to runne vnto mischiefe, Rom. 7. 14▪ 2. Cor. 10. 3 Rom. 13. 14. but doe drawe backe, and retire themselues so much as is possible: and albeit that they are carnal, and sold vnder sinne, yet they do not allowe that which they doe, and walking in the flesh, they fight not fleshly, for they haue not their pleasures in these lustes. If then we would take heed that our affections should not make post hast, and run swiftly, If we would auoid the hatred of our Lord & God, we must bridle them, and keep that sinne do not raigne in our mor∣tall bodies. 19 A false witnesse that speaketh lies, &c. In the sixth place he setteth the false witnesse bearer: and this is not without cause, for it hath an expresse commandement against it, Thou shalt not beare false witnesse against thy neighbour, and so the false witnesse Exo. 20. 1 knoweth not that there is a God which is his Maister and Lorde, whome hee ought to obey, where he laboureth to despite him. For man hauing any knowledge of God, (if he make himselfe a false wit∣nesse) hee knoweth that hee prouoketh the wrath of God against
himself, and seeing that God is the trueth, it cannot bee but he must needes haue a false witnesse in horrible execration. But that wee may know who it is that is a false witnesse, and that we may labour to auoide the displeasure of God, and not to bee abhorred of him, Solomon telleth vs that hee is one, that speaketh lies. Hee saith not that it is the periurer, albeit that al periurers are lyers, and doe speake lyes: but to yoke in all lyers, hee saith simply, hee that spea∣keth lies. Wherefore when wee are asked an answere of trueth, we are false witnesses, if we shal speake otherwise then the matter stan∣deth, though we be not asked vpon our othe. Euen so those which lie in iudgement, or otherwise, are hated of God, and are of him ab∣horred, for the which they ought to looke shortly to bee destroied. By a more strong reason then, they which doe periure themselues, ought wel to be esteemed false witnesses, and when by their false othe they cal God vnto witnesse of their lies, they would spoile him of his trueth, and consequently, that he shoulde be no GOD: for seeing he is the trueth, he cannot stand without it, they well de∣serue of God to be hated, & to be of him detested, and bicause there is no thanks due to them why the worlde doth not sodenly perish, seeing they seeke to ouerthrow God, without whome nothing can remaine, they deserue wel, speedily to be beaten downe: the which shalbe doone without remedie sooner then they thinke for. In the seuenth place he setteth the seditious, which raise vp contentions amongst neighbours, which the Scripture calleth brethren: not on∣ly by this that we are all children of Adam and Eue, but that wee ought all to haue one heauenly father, and also to shewe, that as it is a good thing to be wished for, that brethren shoulde dwel al to∣gether, so also that is an euill thing, that neighbours which ought to Psal. 133. 1. be vnited together as brethren, shoulde bee diuided, and that the common peace shoulde be broken, whereby friendship is maintei∣ned, and helpe is ministred one to another. They which are the cause of the breach of this vnitie, are hated of the Lord, and are not without cause abhorred of him. For first of all, it is no thanks to thē that God is not spoiled of his delight, which he taketh in the vni∣tie and concorde of brethren: The which pleasure ought not to bee esteemed of smal importance, when the lawe of GOD stretcheth wholy to maintaine the vnitie of religion, the which is commanded
vnto vs by the first table, and in coniunction of mutuall loue, the which is commanded vnto vs by the second Table, the which loue cannot bee mainteined without vnitie in religion. And therefore the Prophetes were very carefull to crie against the superstitions & idolatries, and against the false Prophetes and the Priestes of Baal. Also our Lorde Iesus Christ exhorteteth men to take heede of false Prophetes, aduertising that many should come in his name, saying, Mat. 7. 15. & 24. 5. I am the Christ, and should deceiue many: And Saint Paul in diuers places. And forasmuche as there is none that desireth that GOD shoulde hate his manners and dealinges, and to abhorre them, but woulde, if wee haue neuer so little sparke of good wit, that hee shoulde allowe them, and that hee shoulde accept of them: it is ne∣cessary therefore that we delight to giue ourselues to doe contra∣rily to that which God hateth and abhorreth, and that in steede of hawtie eyes, wee become humble and lowly in heart after the ex∣ample of our Lorde Iesus Christe. Secondly, no thanke to them that he is not depriued of his paternitie, no thanke to them that the children doe not deny their father, and to take the Diuell for their father. For as God is the God of peace, so are also the peacema∣kers and peace followers his sonnes, & contrarily the seditious, tu∣mult Mat. 5. 9. raisers, and brawlers are the sonnes of the Deuil. Thus they which make debates, labour to encrease the kingdom of the Diuel. And if God doe abhorre those which so offende against the second Table of Moses, by a more forcible reason doth he detest thē which transgresse the first through obstinacie and wilfulnesse. 20 My sonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and for∣sake not thy mothers instruction. 21 Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke. Because the fathers and mothers, which truely and tenderly loue their children will not commaunde nor teache them any thing but that which is pleasing and acceptable vnto GOD, that the young folkes may learne to flie from the former things which God hateth & abhoreth, Solomō would that children should obey their fathers
and mothers, and that according to the lawe. 21 Binde them alway vpon thine hearte, &c. When he ma∣keth this exhortation, he sheweth wel that he spake not but of fa∣thers Exo. 20. 21. Deu. 5. 16. and mothers which doe labour to gouerne their children in that which is acceptable and pleasing vnto God, in that which is ac∣cording vnto his commandements. For there is nothing wherevn∣to we ought to be so fast linked, as vnto the cōmandements of God, there is no yoke wherevnto we ought to submit ourselues, but vn∣to the law of God the Lorde. Moses also willing to induce the chil∣dren of Israel vnto a continual obedience of the worde of the Lord sayth, And these wordes which I commande thee this day, shalbe in Deut. 6. 6. &. 11. 18. thine hart, lay vp then these words in your heart. Now sith that this presēt admonitiō serueth for the whole word of god, it might be said, that when Solomō said, My sonne, keepe the commandement of thy father, &c. that he speaketh of God, and of the ministery of his Church, in the which there is nothing taught vs but the pure worde of God, and whose children we are, if we submit ourselues vnto his worde, suffering to be begetten thereby into pure faith, & true repentance. 22 It shall leade thee, when thou walkest: it shal watch for thee, when thou sleepest: and when thou wakest, it shall talke with thee. Albeit that this promise agreeth very wel with this same heere, That thy dayes may be long vpon the earth, &c: yet the same hin∣dereth not but that it should regard to assure the goodnes of God, vnto those which willingly and gladly do giue themselues vnto the obedience of the worde generally: for also to them is long life pro∣mised, Therfore shal ye keep al the commandements, which I com∣mande Deut. 11. 8. you this day, that yee may be strong and goe in, and possesse the lande whither yee goe to possesse it: Also that it may prolong your dayes in the lande, &c. Nowe that these wordes of Solomon doe agree with this promise, it is manifest: for wee thinke not to haue life, if wee bee depriued of these presente commo∣dities: it seemeth not vnto vs that we liue, except our businesse doe prosper well: it seemeth vnto vs that wee are in death,
except wee bee at libertie, and may haue company with whome wee may talke familiarly. When Solomon then doeth promise that the commandement of the Father, & the instruction of the mother shal keepe vs from going astray, and shal make vs to sleepe in safetie, and that in the day it shal talke with vs: he doeth shew vs that they which obey the Word, haue a blessed life, and consequently, long enough: for the length of dayes standeth not in the multitude of yeares, but in that wee liue godly, and that wee content ourselues with the number of yeares which it shal please the Lord to giue, cō∣fessing, that he maketh his to liue in this world so long as it pleaseth him, and is expedient for their spiritual health. Notwithstanding, there shalbe no inconuenience, if for that, which wee cal promise here, we take to be admonition: as if Solomon did exhort vs to cleue so fast vnto the Commandements, that we should neuer stray from them, but that in al times and in al places wee shoulde gouerne our¦selues by them, in doing that which they commaund, being assured that by them wee shalbe perserued from al dangers: then shoulde they be so wel grauen in our heartes, & we should so greatly delight in them, that we woulde not desire any prophane or vaine commu∣nication, but if we speake, to speake as the wordes of God. To bee short, let it be whether we take this for a promise, or that we take it for an admonition, Solomon doeth shewe vs that wee must take 1. Pet. 4. 11. good heede from turning any thing at al from the Word, if so be it we desire to doe wel, and say wel, and to walke safely. We may vn∣derstand this same by the reason which foloweth, when he sayeth, 23 For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and instruction, a light: and corrections for instructions are the wayes of life. In this reason he sheweth, that he speaketh of the Commaunde∣ments, and instructions, and corrections, which are made by the Worde of God: for to it onely belongeth these titles of Lanterne, Esai. 2. 5. & 119. 105. 2. Pet. 2. 19. Psal. 19. 8. light, and life. For the lawe of the Lord is a perfit lawe. Thy Word is a Lanterne vnto my feete, and a light vnto my path And we haue also a most sure Worde of the Prophets, to the which ye doe well that ye take heede, as vnto a light that shineth in a darke place, vntil
the day dawne, and the day starre arise in your heartes. O house of Esai. 2. 5. Iacob, come ye, and let vs walke in the light of the Lorde. And that they are the wayes of life, the Scripture not only in one or two pla∣ces, but in diuers doeth testifie: and amongst others, our Lord Iesus doeth wel shewe it, when he sayeth, that God so loued the worlde, that he gaue his only Sonne, to the ende, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him, should not perish, but haue euerlasting life. And when hee Ioh. 3. 16. Mar. 16. 15. commaundeth the Gospel to be preached through al the worlde to euery creature. And though the Scripture should not witnesse it, there is none of sound iudgement, but wil confesse that they which receiue the word of God, are in the true way of life. We haue ther∣fore first of al to note, that they which are disobedient vnto fathers and mothers, and to them which haue the power to commaund, are in darkenesse, and know not whether they goe: for they are blinde, though according as the world iudgeth, they are in a good way, and that they know wisely to gouerne themselues, and to do their bu∣sines wel. Secondly, that they which refuse or despise the reprehen∣sions by which men labour to instruct them to change their euil life, doe seeke their owne destruction and damnation, they flie life, and desire death. Thirdly, what trouble, torment, and affliction so euer the children of God haue, they can not goe astray, nor perishe: for they haue the light of the Word, the which guides them right vnto life. 24 To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flat∣terie of the tongue of a strange woman. After that Solomon hath attributed life & light vnto the Word generally, hee bringeth an example for to shewe, that without it no man can take heede from wandring, and perishing. They which yelde not obedience vnto the Word, neuer make cōscience to com∣mit whoredome, so blinde are they and dull of wit, making of vice vertue. Contrarily, they which delight to yelde obedience vnto the commandements of God, do see how they should guide themselues by the light of the Worde, and thereby knowing that the whore∣mongers and adulterers doe goe out of the right way, and walke through darke wayes which lead vnto death, they take heede of the harlot, whom Solomon calleth heere the wicked woman: that is to
say, the woman that serueth for nothing els but to worke wicked∣nesse, and to intice others vnto euil. This inticing is ment by the flatterie of the tongue of the strange woman. For wel to keepe ourselues from whordome and adulterie, it is not enough to keepe the bodie cleane from whordom, & the tongue from wanton words & filthie songes: but also we must haue both heartes and eyes chast, as Solomon exhorteth. 25 Desire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes. 26 For because of the whorish woman, a man is brought vn∣to a morsel of bread, & a or, the vvife of a man hunteth af∣ter the precious soule. woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man. Our Lorde Iesus Christ declareth vnto vs the like, I say vnto you, That whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath Mat. 5. 28. committed adultery with her alreadie in his heart. The lawe gi∣uer is spiritual, and therefore let vs not thinke to fulfil it, if wee shewe ourselues only outwardly obedient vnto his Worde, doing the wordes that he commandeth, and absteining from them which hee forbiddeth, and in the meane whiles our heartes shalbe rebel∣lious, and delight in filthie lustes and vnshamefast lookes: By such inwarde rebellions, by suche lustes and lookes, wee are easily drawne to commit whoredome: the first worlde is a witnesse thereof: Wee may see it in Dina: Dauid also hath tried it. Ne∣uerthelesse, Gen. 6. 2. & 34. 1. 2. Sam. 11. 2. when Solomon sayth, Desire not her beauty, he re∣gardeth not only that it is easie, to come from the rebellion of the heart, to shewe an outward disobedience: but also by vnshamefast life men come vnto great pouertie, and danger of life: he sheweth it, when he sayeth, 26 For because of the whorish woman, &c. He doeth shewe vs that the harlots are vnsatiable, and care not though their com∣panions consume all their substaunce vppon them, and come to beggerie: and which worst is, they pitie no whit their destruction: but as an hunter doeth not willingly leaue the wild beast, when hee hath once seene her, but doeth hunt her vnto death: euen so the
harlot neuer ceasseth to solicite him to euil, which hath once con∣sented vnto her: and in this sort she not only maketh him to begge his bread, but bringeth him to destruction both of bodie and soule, the which is called precious, not for the vertues wherewith it is a∣dorned, nor for any goodnesse wherevnto the same is giuen (for the soule of suche a man is voide of al vertue, and is corrupted through wickednes) but it is precious, because God doeth esteeme it so, as Gen. 1. 27. he hath shewed in creating man after his Image and likenesse, and giuing him an immortal soule. Euen so the harlot,, so muche as in them lieth, doe labour to destroy the image of God, and cause that the precious blood of our Lorde Iesus Christ to bee in vaine, and without fruite, the which hath beene shed for the saluation of the whole worlde. And this is the principal, wherein God hath wel she∣wed that man his soule is very deare vnto him, when he would that his Sonne should paye suche a deare price. Or els if we shal say, that the soule of man is saide to bee precious, because that the discreete man, doeth keepe it carefully, there is no absurditie therein. Such a poore estate and destruction ought wel to feare the whoremongers and adulterers: but for further to feare the whoremongers, and to shewe them that their maners and customes are abhominable both before God & men, and that they shal not escape without punish∣ment, Solomon compareth the lawe which condemneth the adul∣terers vnto the fire, which spareth nothing that is put vnto it, or that it can catch, but consumeth it: for this to doe, he sayeth, 27 Can a man take fire in his bosome, and not his clothes be burnt? 28 Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt? 29 So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, shal not be in∣nocent, whosoeuer toucheth her. If we reuerence the word of Solomon, not his, but Gods, which is declared vnto vs by him, as wee may see it, wee ought to haue Deut. 22. 21 whoredome in great abhomination, and to be greatly abashed and astonished at the whoredomes that are commited through all the worlde: for it is but so much fire kindled. And in this wee see the
consumption of these miserable adulterers, the which is more hor∣rible and more intollerable, then if al the world burned with fire, & were consumed visibly: for their fire shal neuer be quenched, nor their worme neuer die: but they shal burne, and shalbe bitten e∣uerlastingly. For the Lord wil condemne al fornicatours and adulte∣rers. Notwithstanding, the Scripture cōdescending vnto our rude∣nesse, Hebr. 13. 4. doeth giue and set before vs the inuisible thinges, by the visi∣ble, for to turne vs away from euil, & to cause vs to desire the good, and that the wicked may be touched in their consciences & minds, and that they may not excuse themselues, that they haue not beene warned of the euil which is prepared for them. For this cause Solo∣mon compareth the lawe which condemneth the adulterers, vnto fire that is caried about, or otherwise is touched then ought to be: it can not be auoided, but it wil hurt, and burne that which it tou∣cheth: and herein hee sheweth, that by whore hunting they them∣selues beare their owne destruction, from the which they can not e∣scape. And this comparison that Solomō maketh, is very fitly done: for wee must vnderstande that the lawe foloweth the nature of the Deut. 4. 24. Hebr. 12. 29. Deut. 33. 2. lawe giuer. For he sayeth, The Lorde thy God is a consuming fire. The Lawe therefore burneth, as also Moyses doeth shewe. And the Lorde came with ten thousande of Saintes, and at his right hand a firie Lawe for them. Wee see then, that whorekeepers and adulte∣rers doe consume and destroy themselues, although they loue and praise themselues. Secondly, that God knoweth wel howe to pu∣nish them as wicked and ful of iniquitie. But by looking that God should execute his vengeance, and make the adulterers feele it, he hath other roddes, wherewith he striketh the adulterers, the which to declare, Solomon setteth the Thiefe in opposite of adulterie, whē hee sayeth, 30 Men doe not despise a thiefe, when he stealeth, to satisfie his soule, because he is hungrie. 31 But if he be found, he shal restore seuen fold, or hee shall giue al the substance of his house. There is no man wil take it in good parte, if any take away his goods without his leaue, for men desire rather to increase in riches, then to decrease. Wherefore theeues are hated, and are pursued
euen to death. Yet when we knowe that the thiefe hath stolen but for neede, he is excused, and is not iudged to be wicked: but he is borne withal, if he make satisfaction, or that there can be so much founde in his house for to recompence it. Solomon doeth signifie it, saying, 4 But if he be founde, &c. Solomon requireth here no more of the thiefe then the lawe: but he sheweth that the thiefe shal ra∣ther Exo. 22. 1. 4. giue more then he ought, that he may escape if he be apprehen∣ded, & that his offer shalbe takē, & he accepted & allowed of again, when he hath done what he can. Albeit, then that Solomon doeth not here condemne the thiefe to death, yet hee excludeth him not from sinne, otherwise he should gaine say the Lawe, Thou shalt not steale. Only for to shew how abhominable and miserable the whor∣mongers are, he setteth the thiefe against the adulterer: and shew∣eth that the thiefe may be redeemed, and that after his satisfaction, hee is not marked by ciuilitie of infamie, but that it is not so with adulterie. 32 But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is destitute of vnderstanding: he that doeth it, destroy∣eth his owne soule. 33 He shal finde a wounde and dishonour, and his reproche shal neuer be put away. 34 For iealousie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not spare in the day of vengeance. 35 He can not beare the sight of any ransome: neither will he consent, though thou augment the gifts. He sheweth here that the adulterer deserueth wel to be despised, in that hee is not led to this filthines but by wickednes, and not by necessitie: as he signifieth, saying, he is destitute of vnderstanding: and so he noteth him of infamie, from the which he exempteth the thiefe. He marketh also this miserie, saying, That he destroyeth his soule: the which he hath not laide to the theeues charge. Wherein we may see that the worlde is much voide of sound iudgement. For a thiefe nowe shalbe pursued with al diligence, to be punished, euen to death; but the adulterer shalbe pardoned, & there shalbe nothing els but laughing at the horrible abhomination that he shal commit, as were at a may game or puppet play.
In speaking thus, wee doe not quit the theeues, & saue thē from punishment, for we know what is written: but wee would say that Rom. 13. . they which punishe the theefe more grieuously then the adulterer, do iniurie vnto God, who hath appointed a more grieuous pain for the adulterer then for the theefe & thus they doe wickedly, for the which, they shal not go vnpunished: they are wicked iudges, fauou∣ring the wicked, but they shal appeare before the righteous iudge, who wil not fauour their vngodlines, but wil punish them with al seueritie, & without any forgiuenes. Although wee speake accor∣ding to truth, wherunto al ought to agree & graunt without gaine saying: yet it shal seeme good vnto the fauourers of whoredom & adultery, that we shalbe ouercome & they shal winne the victory, if they should alledge vnto vs, that Iesus said vnto the woman takē in adultery, Neither do I condemne thee, go & sinne no more: but we Iohn. 8. 11. answere that it belongeth vnto the Magistrates to execute the iudge∣ment that God declareth in his law, against the euil doers, & that to them only appertaineth to take vengeance of thē that commit euil, and not vnto others. But our Lord Iesus Christ was not sent into this world by God his Father, for to exercise the office of the magi∣strate, but to shew himself the Sauiour of the world. Wherfore his office was rather to absolue, then to condemne: notwithstanding he hindred not the Magistrate neither tooke his office vpon him, but it was lawful for the iudge to haue condemned this woman of adul∣tery to be stoned to death according to the lawe. Hee also saued the theefe which was hanged with him, and yet hee reprooued not the iudge for punishing him, & respected not but that the theefe should suffer & feele the paines that he had deserued before men. But they which fauour whoredome & adulteries, wil reply that we are vnder the lawe of grace, & that the sharpenesse of the law is abolished. I answere, that God neuer did withdrawe his grace from his elect, but that they haue felt the same alwaies at neede, albeeit that nowe it is more plainly manifested by the comming of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, and by the preaching of his Gospel: And also hee is not so pitiful and merciful, but that he is also iust, and doeth commande the iudges to do iustice and iudgement in al times. Moreouer, if Iesus Christ by the forgiuenes that he pronounced, vnto the adul∣terers, did put away the lawe, that doeth condemne the adul∣terers vnto bodily paynes, euen vntoo death, seeing that
vnder the lawe of seueritie (as they cal it) the theefe is not so sore to be punished as the adulterer, it should folowe that vnder the law of grace (as they cal it) the theefe ought not to be so grieuously pu∣nished as the adulterer: otherwise, the lawe of grace shoulde bring fauour vnto the most wicked, and shoulde shewe seueritie that was not wont to bee vsed vnto them which are not so wicked: & thus the law of grace should deale sharply with them that were wont to be more gently entred vnder the lawe of seueritie. But it wil be an∣swered, That it is expedient so to do, because the theeues are more hurtful to the common wealth then adulterers. I answere, that mās wisedom doth so iudge it: for men voide of the holy Ghost, do make no great account of adultery, in comparison of theft: but God iud∣geth otherwise, as we may vnderstande by the lawe that he hath gi∣uen, and by the vengeances and punishements that he hath nt be∣cause of whoredomes and adulteries. After this, Solomon doth de∣clare vnto vs what happeneth vnto the adulterer for the smalnes of his vnderstanding, when he saith, He shal find a wounde, &c. Solomon doeth not heere speake of that which we see commonly done vnto the adulterers▪ for they are suffred to liue at their ease, they are feasted, and are not put backe as infamous and wicked. He speaketh of that which ought to be done: for if there were such gouernement in the world as there ought to be, then the adulterers shoulde not escape grieuous punishmentes, they should be more despised then the myre in the street, we would fly further from them, than from the most stinking dounghil of the world, we would abhorre them more then the most dangerous Pe∣stilēce, we would euermore haue them in execration, and we would neuer name them but to their great shame and dishonor. For as So∣lomon saith, his reproche ought not to be put out. And hee giueth the reason heereof, in this verse folowing, when he saith: For ielousie, &c. If the husband of the wife with whome adul∣tery hath bin committed, did truly loue his wife before she had cō∣mitted adultery, and that he had his hart right, his ielousie should be so kindled with anger and wrath against the adulterous man, that he would withal diligēce pursue him that he might be punished, as he hath deserued, and would haue no compassion of him, but woulde craue vengeance to be done of him, as behoueth, there shoulde no
prayers of freendes, nor presentes, nor giftes, although they were great and precious, which would moue him to turne from his an∣ger: as Solomon doth declare it by that which foloweth. Hee can not beare the sight, &c. If then at the pursute of the husbande, iustice be done, the adulterer, shal finde a wounde, and shalbe dishonoured for euer. And if the Gouernours, and suche as beare the sworde, had the zeale of God, as they ought to haue, they woulde not tarie til the adulterers were pursued: but when there were any discouered, they should make diligent information to fo∣lowe them with al seueritie. They woulde folowe the zeale of Phi∣neas. But in steade to haue such a zeale, the greatest parte of Iud∣ges Num. 25. 7. Psal. 106. 30. 1. Sam. 2. 22. belike vnto Elie. The chiefe cause for the which men passe not to commit adulterie and whoredome, and also that Iudges doe not punish whoremongers and adulterers as they deserue, is, for that e∣uery man desireth to haue his carnal pleasure, and therefore must beare with his Gosseps: & al commeth from the contempt of Gods worde. Solomon hath wel shewed it heere aboue in the twentieth verse: when to detest whoredome and adulterie, hee admo∣nisheth the children to obey their fathers and mo∣thers. He doeth wel shew it consequently, in the beginning of the next Chapter.
The seuenth Chapter. 1 My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaunde∣ments with thee. HEere wee see the fatherly care that God hath of vs, when hee doeth so often admonish vs by Solomon, that we should keepe his Word, not one∣ly without works, as hypocrites do, but that we should haue our hearts truely garnished. It goeth wel for vs that he hath the care when he doeth thus admonish vs: for hee hath no neede of our seruice, but wee haue great neede of his, yea we can not wel misse it, for to obey him. We haue seene it heretofore in diuers places, where Solomon hath de∣clared vnto vs the profite that commeth of obeying the Word, and the hurt of the disobedience. Solomon doeth shew it vs again, when he sayeth, 2 Keepe my Commandements, and thou shalt liue; & mine instruction, as the apple of thine eye. 3 Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the ta∣ble of thine heart. For as by the keeping of the Commandements, and by the great care that we haue to folow the doctrine of God with al our hearts, life is giuen vnto vs: Euen so it may be truely inferred, that the a∣dulterers by contemning of the Word, are depriued thereof, for the which they must needes perish and destroy their owne soules, and are not spared in the day of vengeance. Solomon doeth wel signifie it, when hee asketh so great a care: and therewith hee signifieth a great fatherly gentlenes, when hee sheweth that God is contented with vs, if we haue such care of his most precious Word, as we haue Psal. 19. 11.
of the apples of our eyes, which is no great thing, seeing the bod is not much worth. If wee wil auoide whoredome and adulterie, & haue life, we must haue this great care that Solomon requireth, not onely for a certaine time, but that we should be so giuen vnto his holie commandements and instructions, that wee shoulde con∣tinually worke thereafter, and haue our heartes alwayes fixed vp∣pon them. Solomon doeth so wishe it, when he sayeth, Binde them vpon thy fingers, &c. Hee craueth this, folowing that which is saide, Laye vp these my wordes in your heart and in Deut. 11. 18 your soule, and binde them for a signe vpon your hande, that they be as a frontlet before your eyes. And for to shewe vs further that we must haue our heartes giuen vnto the commandements, & that we should loue them, in taking our ioye and pleasure in them, hee sayeth, 4 Say vnto wisedome, Thou art my sister: & cal vnderstan∣ding thy kinswoman: 5 That they may keepe thee from the strange woman, euen from the stranger that is smooth in her wordes. For as much as we haue neither wisedome nor knowledge, but so much as the Word of God doeth print in our heartes, and that it pleaseth him to giue vs: we ought to vnderstād that Solomō would haue vs like vnto the blessed mā: so doing, wisdom should be as our sister, & vnderstāding should be familiar vnto vs, & we shalbe con∣tented Psal. 1. 1. to loue wisedome, and vnderstanding shal keepe vs continu∣al company, and so shal wee not be giuen to seeke dishonest compa∣ny, nor wil not suffer ourselues to be deceiued with the flattering speeches of whores. Solomon doth signifie it by that which folow∣eth, saying, 5 That they may keepe thee, &c. It is by wisedome and vn∣derstanding then that we obteine life: and by the vse of the Word, that we eschue whoredome and adulterie, and not by mans wise∣dome, nor by our free will. 6 As I was in the windowe of mine house, I looked through my windowe.
7 And I sawe among the fooles, and considered amongest the children, a young man destitute of vnderstan∣ding. 8 Who passed through the streete by her corner, & went to∣ward her house, 9 In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke. 10 And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and suttle in heart. 11 Shee is babling and loude: whose feete can not abide in her house. 12 Nowe shee is without, nowe in the streetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner. 13 So shee caught him and kissed him, and with an impu∣dent face saide vnto him, 14 I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes. 15 Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might seeke thy face: and I haue found thee. 16 I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt. 17 I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cy∣namon. 18 Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleasure in daliance. 19 For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of. 20 He hath taken with him a bagge of siluer, and wil come home at the day appointed. 21 Thus with her great craft she made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes she intised him. 22 And he folowed her straight wayes, as an Oxe that go∣eth to the slaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction. 23 Til a dart stricke through his liuer, as a byrd hasteth to the snare, not knowing that hee is in danger.
For to turne vs away from whoredome and adulterie, hee vseth a parable, in the which he sheweth the foolishnes of them that suf∣fer themselues to be deceiued, wherein they are not so much igno∣rant, but that they knowe wel they doe euil: and therefore wil not be seene. Hee sheweth also the suttleties and craftines, the flatteries and sweete wordes of them, or those which labour to drawe others to agree vnto their wicked concupiscences. When hee attributeth the suttleties and craftie dealings, the flattering speeches, and sweete wordes of the adulterous woman, hee speaketh according to that which is most commonly done: for if there were no women that sold themselues, and woulde bragge, there shoulde not be so many open adulteries, nor whoredomes. For to beginne this parable, hee speaketh of himselfe, as of a man which marketh and taketh heede what others do: and yet he wil not haue it knowne, that he might take them in the deede doing, if they doe euil. Hee signifieth this, when he sayeth, He did not put his head out of the window, for to looke with an open face, and to shewe himselfe openly, but he loo∣ked through the windowe. And herein he teacheth that it is needful to vse suttletie, for to discouer whoredome, that the same may bee punished and corrected, and to the ende also that when we shal see the wickednesses that were thought to be secrete, to be manifested, men might bee turned from euil, and to take heede of giuing of∣fence and slaunder, and that they might learne to feare God by the corrections and punishments that they shal see executed vppon o∣thers. Hee also after a sort, signifieth that the adulterers and whore∣mongers doe feare men more then God, when they dare doe that before God, which they wil not doe before men, though God doe see al things in al places, how secret & hid soeuer they be. 7 And I sawe among the fooles, &c. When we priuily looke and narowly take heede vnto the vices and wickednesses, we disco∣uer them the more easily. Then are the scorners and contemners of God & of his law made manifest, the which Solomō calleth fooles, because they are ignorant, but yet willingly; they are dull of vnder∣standing, but yet of mallice; they are bare of vnderstanding, but yet through contempte of the Worde. Nowe although that suche people bee out of order, yet amongest them there are some which are more willingly wicked, and doe passe the rest in wicked∣nes and dissolutenesse. Solomon doeth signifie it, when hee sayeth,
that he sawe among the fooles, & considered amongst the children, that is to say, which were fooles, a young man destitute of vnder∣standing: wherein he teacheth vs, that it is verie necessarie to take diligent heede vnto young people, and not to suffer them to liue as they list, after their sensualitie, otherwise that they shal loose vnder∣standing. It seemeth them good, and also they like, that they are ve∣rie bold, when they giue themselues vnto wickednesse, & that they spare neither bodie nor goods for to enioy their desires: but before God, and before men of sounde iudgement, they want vnderstan∣ding or courage: for by getting vertue, they folowe vice: leauing that which is necessarie, they giue thēselues vnto vanitie: reiecting that which is profitable, they embrace that which is vnprofitable and hurtful. Chastitie is a thing of great vertue, profitable, and ne∣cessarie: hee then that doeth folowe it, is verie strong: and contra∣rily, he which runneth vnto vnshamefastnes, is a very cowheard, and wanteth vnderstanding: for by forsaking his office, hee passeth his time in folowing of whores and adulteresses, and yet hee thinketh that it is not seene. Solomon doeth declare it, when he sayeth, 8 VVho passed through the streete, &c. And because hee is ouercome in his conscience that he doeth wickedly, hee wil not bee seene: & therfore he passeth by the lane, and entreth into the house of the whore. 9 In the twilight, &c. When Solomon doeth assemble so many wordes together and not vainely, the which doe signifie dark∣nes: we ought first of al to learne that they which haue the charge to watch ouer the slanders, dissolutions & insolences, & to gouern the youth, ought to bee so watchful, that they might take the euil doers, howe close and hid soeuer they be, that they may bee corrected and brought againe vnto the right way, & seuerely to punishe the vnre∣pentant. Secondly, that they which giue themselues vnto euil, and chiefly vnto whordome & adulterie, are diligent to seeke holes and corners: but that there is nothing so darke nor hid, but in time God wil reueale it. Solomon doth wel note it, when he saith, that he saw in the twilight, &c. If the youth & others of smal vnderstanding, did read this text as it behooueth, they would not commit so many whordomes & adulteries. For first of al, they would haue the feare of God by reuerence of his Word, the which is greatly contemned:
secondly, they would haue feare, lest such filthines should come to the knowledge of men, and should be offended thereat. 10 And behold there met him, &c. It is a common thing for him to finde euil, that seeketh euil, and finde her hee shal: wee haue here an example thereof. For as wee haue seene, the young man ta∣keth his way right vnto the house of the harlot, & behold an whore commeth out to meete him, as Solomon saieth now. She is craftie, not to deceiue those which are of a good minde and loue chastitie. Solomon hath alreadie noted it, by that which hee hath saide of the pathe, of the house, and also of the twilight or mystie morning: Hee sheweth it wel againe, when hee saieth, with an harlots behauiour. She is not hid then, but she shewes herselfe. One part of her beha∣uiour whereby she declares herselfe to be suche, is that she is mette early in the mystie morning, and that by such early walking, we may gather that she meaneth no goodnesse. For it is an vnmeete time, for women chiefly, and if they be honest women, they wil not walke in darke night, but vpon great necessitie. Solomon doeth expounde this whorish behauiour more amplie, when he sayeth, 11 Shee is babling and loud. If women then wil not be found in harlots behauiour, they must striue against their nature, which is to speake much. This same proceedeth from them, for want of do∣ing 1. Tim. 5. 13. their duetie, as we may vnderstand it, when Saint Paule sayeth, that there are young widowes, the which are idle, and learne to goe from house to house, yea they are not onely idle, but also pratlers and busie bodies, speaking things which are not comely. They must also take heede to be ouercome and caried away. Nowe although that wee knowe wel howe they are bablers and naughtie packes, and that the same is prooued before vs more then were needful, yet Solomon, for their great confusion, and to aduer∣tise the fooles and ignorant, doeth first of al declare vnto vs, her in∣ticements saying, That her feete can not abide in the house, but that, Nowe she is without, now in the streetes, &c. Solomon heere sheweth vnto women, that they ought to be careful to do the busi∣nes at home in the house, & to go abroad as seldom as they may: o∣therwise, if they loue to runne hither & thither, without there bee great necessitie knowne, they are in harlots behauiour, and are su∣spected of whoredome.
Wherefore the wiues that desire to be wel named and counted of, and would be esteemed indeede for honest women, let them abstain from pratling, and from gadding about. For though it were so, that they mēt no euil, yet shal they not cease to be counted whores. They may alledge that they can not abide to be Nunnes and shut vp, but they must haue their recreatiō, & that they care not though it be spoken of, and men offended at it: but cursed is that recreati∣on which is taken with the offence of the neighbour. Saint Paule is not satisfied with this, that we should doe no euil, but hee woulde 1. Thes. 5. 22. that we should abstaine from al appearance of euil. When wee once loose shame in any matter, we easily abound in whordome, we take leaue to doe actes, and to speake wordes which shewe manifestly what the person is. Solomon doeth shew it, saying, 13 So shee caught him and kissed him, &c. An honest wo∣man wil not come neere vnto a man that is not her husbād, to kisse him: but if a strange man, how honest so euer hee bee, doe offer to kisse her, shee cannot receiue it, without some shame for it. Con∣trarily, an harlot is vnshamefast, and without shame kisseth al that shee desireth to doe wickedly withal. True it is, that to counterfait an honest woman, shee wil not be seene of al men: as Solomon hath wel noted it, by the darke morning. After that he hath shewed the harlots inticement indeedes, he commeth to shew her inticement in talke, the which he hath here before briefly touched: and to be∣gin, he saith that the whore speaketh thus vnto the young man: 14 I haue peace offrings, &c. For better to deceiue the vn∣discreet man, she laboureth to make him beleeue that she wil entice him vnto none euil. For when she maketh mention of the peaceable offringes that shee hath made, and of the vowes that shee hath payde the same day, shee braggeth of her deuotion and holinesse, the which is as much as if shee did say, that shee is pure and cleane, and that the young man should not thinke that shee woulde allure him to filthines and vncleannes now sith she hath paid so wel her dutie, that it was lawfull for him to giue himselfe vnto wickednes, and that for it no euil should come to him. Behold howe we abuse holie things, that is, that vnder the shadow of thē what euil soeuer we cō∣mit, yet wil be esteemed for honest men: And also because of thē, ly∣cence is taken to do euil, without fear of punishmēt. And thus holie
things through mallice of hypocrits are applied vnto bawdry, & do serue for a cloke vnto the wicked, that they may not be so easily ta∣ken, and that we cannot take heede of them. But what corners so∣euer they seeke, God seeth them, and can, and will, when hee seeth time, punish it. Also this mercy hee sheweth vnto his faithful ser∣uants which doe loue his worde, that they iudge them thereby. Be∣sides this, the wicked doe blaspheme and speake wickedly of the ser∣uice of God, when they attribute that hee is the cause they come to ende of their desire, albeit they are dissolute and wanton. Solo∣mon heere bringeth in the whore thus blaspheming. 13 Therefore came I foorth, &c. The harlot thus blasphe∣meth, making the seruice of God the cause of the finding of that she sought for, & thinketh herself happy, as it is noted by the fit or good time. In this sort al wicked reioyce, and iudge themselues happy, when they come vnto the ende of their enterprises, though they be wicked: they prayse God with their mouth, and thanke him: but it is not the true God, for they haue him not in their heart, but the Diuel whome they serue: and thus it is in an euil houre that they meete with that they seeke for: for they fal into death though they feele nothing: they are like vnto leprous men which feele no∣thing when they are pricked: but sodenly shall their destruction come, wherewith they shalbe beaten downe, then shall they feele, that it was in no good time that they tooke their desire. And in that the young man tooke the way to the harlots house, and that shee meeteth with him, first wee see that the wicked are all of one mind & consent, but not in God. Wherfore their agreement is cur∣sed, and is esteemed for a wicked conspiracie and rebellion against God. If wee woulde that our agreements should be good and plea∣sant vnto God, wee must then serue God and our neighbours in them, as the holy Scripture doth teach vs. Secondly, that the wic∣ked doe seeke one for another, but it is to fulfill theyr wicked lust. 16 I haue decked my bed, &c. After that the wicked haue serued God, or els that they haue made but a semblance, they thinke it is lawfull to haue care of their fleshe to fulfil their cōcupiscences, to take their ease and their pleasures. These ornaments and per∣fumes doe wel shew it. And also in the rehearsing of them wee
may see a point of Arte, & knack of flatterie, & sweet words of the whore: for in speaking so, shee fanneth and draweth the vndiscrete man by thinges pleasant vnto the eies, and that liketh the fleshe. Al∣though then that the ornaments of themselues are not euil, & that it is lawfull to vse sweete smels and arromatical sauours, not onely for necessitie, but also for recreation: yet must wee take heede to be too curious, otherwise wee may giue occasion to bee iudged that we are too delicate and carnal, and that wee loue ostentation. Wee must be sober and temperate in the vse of things that are not neces∣sary: & also we must not be so streight and scrupulous, that we dare in no wise handle them, and that wee iudge and condemne them which vse them. Such things are creatures of God, the which are cleane vnto the faithful, which can vse thē reasonably but vnto thē they are defiled, which vntemperately vse them, as doe the infidels, which defile all that they handle. And so, whatsoeuer faire and goodly thing the whoremongers and adulterers, and other wicked Titus. 1. 15. ones haue, is but filthinesse; their sweete sauours, is but stinch; their good meates, is but poyson. Al things are cleane to them them that are cleane: but to them that are polluted and infidels nothing is cleane, &c. Wee must then beware to enuie the delightes, eases and pleasures of the wicked: otherwise wee are in danger to defile al thing, and to be giuen vnto filthinesse and shameful thinges: for also wee see that the harlot maketh mention of her ornaments and perfumes, to the end to entice and allure the young vndiscrete man to commit whoredome and adulterie. Shee wel sheweth that shee tendeth to this ende, when shee keepeth not backe from declaring what she would, saying, Come let vs take our fill, &c. Heere shee openly calleth the young man to giue ouer himself vnto vncleannesse, to cōmit whore∣dome with al greedinesse: she calleth him as though shee woulde make him great cheere, and drinke wholy his fil, euen till he be rea∣dy to burst and spue againe. As the drunkardes doe delight in wine and doe not ceasse gladly drinking, til they bee dunken, and can no more: euen so the whoremongers and adulterers doe reioyce them¦selues in their filthines, & do cast themselues therin with an vnbri∣deled desire. Vnto such a plūging the harlot calleth the young man, but it is in speaking vnproperly of loue, as doe all they which speake of the loue of the fleshe, and after the worlde: for shee calleth the
desire that men haue to commit whoredome, and euen the very act it selfe, Loue. The Lorde hath created loue betweene man and wife, making her an helper vnto man, and making two in one Gen. 2. 2. fleshe: hee hath also commanded that euery man shoulde loue his neighbour as himselfe: and contrarily, hee hateth whoredome as it may be seene by the punishments he hath made thereof: hee hath Leu. 19. 18 also expresly forbidden whoredome in his lawe. It is then spoken deceitfully, when wee say, that knaues and harlottes doe loue toge∣ther: for there is no manner of loue betweene them, but as there is among suche as seeke to destroy one another, &c. Also if there were among such people true loue, it should remaine what affliction soe∣uer came, and thereby they should be stirred vp for to gouerne them¦selues wel and honestly. For loue is pacient, &c. 1. Cor. 18. 4. 19 For mine husband, &c. Albeit that the harlot hath alled∣ged her sacrifices and vowes that shee hath perfourmed and paide, for to shew that it was lawful for him to giue ouer himselfe, yet she knoweth well that she doth euil: euen so doth the young man, as it appeared by the twilight or mistie morning, &c. It appeareth nowe againe in the absence of her husband: the farre iourney and the day appointed are heere alledged: for it is as much as if hee did say, that she knowes well that she will commit wickednesse, that she durst not do, her husband being present: and yet though he is ab∣sent, that she woulde not be so bolde, but that she knowes that hee is gone a farre iourney, and hath matters of waight in his mind, as it is noted by the bagge of money: and also that hee had tolde her the day of his returne againe: for otherwise she would be afraid to be taken in the act doing. And in the holding herself assured, she la∣boureth to assure the young man, that hee shoulde not feare to bee hurt or haue shame on her husbandes parte: the which were not needeful, except the whoremonger knewe wel that hee doeth euil in committing such filthinesse. But besides this we doe first learne, that the married man ought not to absent himself far of frō his house, & chiefly if he haue a daintie dame: for he leaueth her in danger: and if he himselfe be not very chast, is assaulted of many lustes, from the which he should be exempted being at home with his wife. Second∣ly, that it is not the greatest blessing that can happen vnto a woman to be richly married, and chiefly whē to encrease the goods, the hus¦band must trauel abrode. It happeneth also that the riche man for to
take his pastime, and to recreate himselfe, taketh in hande long voy∣ages which are not necessary, but hurtful both to his family and to the poore, for whose helpe in their necessitie he shoulde stay him∣selfe, &c. 21 Thus with her great craft, &c. By suche persuasions the vndiscrete doth feele that the lips of the strange womē drop as an honny combe: but after sweetenesse commeth bitternesse, and it commeth before that a man thinke of it, and without looking for it: Solomon doth shew it, when he saith, 22 And hee followed her, &c. Hee vseth foure simili∣tudes, for to shewe that there is great bitternesse in whoredome, & that the whoremongers are so dul witted, that they perceiue no∣thing: wherein the Prouerbe is verified, A foole neuer beleeueth so long as he receiueth. The similitudes are manifest, and they are dayly prooued, and thereby wee shoulde bee sufficiently aduertised to beware of whordome and adulterie. Notwithstanding Solomon ceasseth not to exhort vs stil as his children: 24 Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vn∣to the wordes of my mouth. 25 Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes. 26 For shee hath caused many to fall downe wounded, and the strong men are all slaine by her. 27 Her house is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death. By this admotion wee may see whervnto hee tended by the for∣mer similitudes, that is to say, to teach vs to take good heede that wee giue not our heartes vnto straunge women, and to followe whoredome and adulterie. Also hee teacheth vs, that the chiefe remedie for to auoyde suche vncleannesse, is to heare the worde of GOD, and therevnto, too applie our vnderstanding. They then which make no count of this holy worde, are very worthy to be forsaken of God, and giuen vp to a reprobate sense, for to com∣mit filthinesse with all greedinesse of minde.
26 For shee hath caused many to fall, &c. Because there are some which iudge that it is but a trifling matter, to keepe company with knaues and whores; and doe thinke themselues so wise, that they haue no neede to bee diswaded from suche company, and that whatsoeuer acquaintance they haue with such people, that they wil keepe themselues wel enough from defiling, and wil take no hurte thereby: Solomon sheweth heere that his exhortation is necessary for al men, when he saith that the harlot maketh many to fall, &c. The vniuersal flood is an example thereof: Sampson, Dauid and Solomon haue prooued it to be true for a time. And for to shewe that hee speaketh not of the corporall nature, but of the losse of the soules of those which wil not abstaine, he addeth, 27 Her house is the way, &c. This is the same that hee hath said in the 2. Chapter 18. 19. verses: and Chap. 5. verses 4. 5. Wherfore it shall not neede to repeate the same againe.
The viii. Chapter. 1 DOth not wisedome crie? and vnderstanding vtter her voice? 2 She standeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes. 3 She crieth besides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores. 4 O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men. 5 O yee foolish men, vnderstand wisedome, and ye, O fooles, be wise in hearte. 6 Giue eare, for I wil speake of excellent things, & the ope∣ning of my lippes shall teache thinges that be right. 7 For my mouth shal speake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickednesse. 8 All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdnesse, nor frowardnesse in them. 9 They are al plaine to him that wil vnderstand, & straight to them that would vnderstand. 10 Receiue mine instruction, and not siluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde. 11 For wisedome is better then precious stones: and al plea∣sures are not to be compared vnto her. 12 I wisedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counsels. FOr to shewe vnto the foolishe and vndiscreete that they cannot bee ex∣cused, for hauing followed and obey∣ed the desires and lustes of their flesh, although they haue been temp∣ted after diuers sorts: Solomon doth here pronounce vnto vs by an inter∣rogation, that if the foolishe and vn∣discreete haue yelded to enticement by temptation, following their vn∣tamed lustes, that it hath not bin for want of doctrine, exhortation, & correctiō, but by contempt of wisdome & vnderstanding, wher∣by
they care not to giue their heartes and mindes vnto the holy ser∣mons, which are made by the Pastours of the Church, both publike∣ly and priuately: by whome wisedome crieth, and vnderstanding lifteth vp, & thundereth with her voyce, when they purely handle the Scripture, seeking the glory of GOD, and the edifiyng of their neighbours. And to the ende that none shoulde alledge that he hath not hearde this proclamation, nor vnderstoode this calling: Solo∣mon doth shew vs, that God hath not imparted his wisdome vnto his ministers for to hide themselues, and to stoppe their mouthes: so haue they openly shewed it, and preached it plainely: and yet stil as this day they continue, Solomon doth shew it, when he saith, 2 She standeth in the top, &c. This is the same that hath bin saide before in the first Chapter, verses, 20. & 21. But besides that which was there said, we must note that Solomon vseth both there and heere a Verbe that signifieth to crie aloude, either for ioy or for sorrow. Nowe when hee crieth after men, and that it is not for any vertue they haue, but rather to reproue them for their sinnes, then it followeth that the crye is made for griefe and sorrow. That it is after men, he expresseth: 4 O men, &c. And that it is not for their vertues, he sheweth, when he calleth them ignorant and fooles, saying, 5 O yee foolish men, vnderstande wisedome, &c. But al∣though respecting them with whom he hath to doe, hee is minded to crie for sorrow, pitie and compassiō that he hath to see thē with∣out vnderstanding and without hart: yet he crieth chiefly for an o∣ther respect, to wit, because it is his duetie to crie, and also that hee crieth not by pronoūcing vaine & friuolous things, as he declareth: 6 Giue eare, for I wil speake, &c. When Solomon in the per∣son of wisdome is not greeued with much speaking, but vseth copy, and is plentifull in wordes, saying, I call you, my voyce crieth, vnder∣stande, be learned, hearken: hee sheweth vs the great compassion that hee hath of the foolishnesse of men, and therewith speaketh cheerefully: and doth shewe vs, that albeit that after the outwarde apparance wee thinke not to profite by preaching, by exhortations and corrections, that yet we must not be greeued too doe our office of teaching, exhorting, correcting, reproouing and threatning, by following Moses, the Prophetes, Iesus Christe and his Apostles.
And also albeit that the ignorant and foolish, that wil not yeeld vn∣to the trueth, but followe wickednesse and lying, doe wel deserue to be deceiued by lyes, and be left in a reprobate sense, that yet our of∣fice is to speake of excellent thinges, worthy to be proclaimed, and which are so cleare and manifest, that none can bee deceiued in hea∣ring them, so that any man cannot be turned from righteousnesse and equitie, but that they shew the right way of them rather. So∣lomon doth giue vs well to vnderstande this same, when after ha∣uing promised notable, excellent or cleare thinges, hee promiseth to teach thinges that are right, by the opening of his lippes. Wherevp∣on the reason followeth. 7 For my mouth shall speake the trueth, &c. When Solo∣mon setteth trueth in his mouth that speaketh notable things, hee 1. Cor. 1. 2. 4 Col. 2. 8. sheweth that the Minister for to declare excellent thinges, must not come with highnesse of wordes or wisedome, neither must his prea∣ching stand in inticing words of mans wisdome, but in pure trueth, & also that the people should take heed to be ouertakē by Philoso∣phie and vaine deception, according to the tradition of men, and in∣stitutions of the worlde. Moreouer, when Solomon placeth trueth against wickednesse, we ought to vnderdande, that the trueth stan∣deth not onely in wordes, but in sinceritie of hearte, in vprightnesse of conscience, in holy thoughtes, in good desires, and in a strong and liuely faith, the which worketh by loue not fained, doing good and righteous vnto the glory of God, and profite, and edifiyng of our neighbour: thus doing, wee may truely say with Solomon, My mouth shall speake the trueth. We must also vnderstand, that what¦soeuer is contrary vnto the trueth, is wickednesse, and wee must ab∣horre and detest it, though it haue an external faire appearance, and that the wise men of the worlde doe praise it: neuerthelesse Solo∣mon speaketh heere chiefly of the doctrine of trueth, the which is pronounced for to turne man away from his wickednesse, and to guide him vnto iustice and equitie: the which he sheweth when he faith: 8 Al the words of my mouth, &c. If thē we would be preserued from frowardnesse and dissolution, we must followe the sayinges of wisedome, which teacheth vs by Solomon, and by the Ministers of trueth, whose doctrine tendeth to none other end, then that al wic∣kednesse
being forsaken, we shoulde giue ourselues vnto righteous∣nesse, by deniyng all superstition and idolatrie, all infidelitie and di∣strust, all filthinesse and dishonestie, all iniurie and wrong, al deceipt and vnfaithfulnesse: and that wee shoulde serue one onely God by faith, in spirite and trueth: and our neighbours in loue, seeking that which is for their profite in al honestie & chastitie. It is the righte∣ousnes that is taught vs by the sayings of wisdom, to the which we must be very attentiue, if we would easily attaine therto: and not to remain in ignorance, if we wil find them plaine, he declareth, saying. 9 They are all plaine, &c. Also none but the carelesse, ig∣norant, and contemners doe finde the worde of GOD trouble∣some, hard, sharpe, and seuere, It behoueth vs then to be learned, & to be diligent to get knowledge, and to preferre it before al thinges that can be desired in the worlde, how precious soeuer they be. So∣lomon doth cal vs therevnto when, he saith: 10 Receiue mine instruction, &c. Then shall we haue true knowledge, Chap. 2. verses 1. 2. 3. 4. &. 5. It is not without cause that he doth thus admonish vs: as he doth shew, saying, 11 For wisedome is better then precious stones, &c. This is the same that he hath saide in the 3. Chapter, & in the 13. 14. & 15. verses: and also againe in the same Chapt. in the 16. 17. 18. 19. & 20. verses, he hath shewed in what sort it is better. The reasons that he hath giuen vs heeretofore, ought to be sufficient to make vs careful to followe wisedome, and to be diligent hearers of his sayings: but for to stirre vs vp furthermore, Solomon doth shewe vs here againe how wisdome is better, when he saith: 12 I wisdome dwell with prudence, &c. What abundance of wealth, and what ease, and pleasures soeuer man can haue, yet hee is neither the wiser nor discreter, thē if he were poore & miserable: but in what state and condition soeuer we be, yet if we haue wise∣dome, wee are discrete and wel aduised, and gouerned. Better is the Eccle. 4. 13. &. 9. 15. poore and wise childe, than an olde and foolish king, which wil be no more admonished. And there was founde therein a poore and wise man, and he deliuered the citie by his wisedome. And because there is none of sounde iudgement which doth not much more de∣sire to haue discretion and counsell for to be able to gouerne him¦selfe, and to keepe himselfe from hurt and danger, rather then to
haue great riches, and therewith to be ignorant and foolishe, it fol∣loweth thereof that wisedome is best. I say expresly of sound iudge∣ment: for we must not make cōparison of things after the opiniō & fantasie of people which are of a frowarde or corrupted iudgement: as are al they which haue their minde on this worlde: they care not what they be, nor what they doe, so that they may haue riches: they thinke themselues wise enough, seeing they haue riches: but for all that, before God they are fooles, as appeareth by the rich man wher∣of Luke speaketh, O foole, this night will they fetch away thy soule Luke. 12. 20 from thee: then whose shal those thinges be which thou hast proui∣ded? They are also enimies of GOD: for they are gouerned after Rom. 8. 7. the affection of the fleshe, which is enimitie against God. 13 The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that spea∣keth lewd things, I doe hate. 14 I haue counsel and wisedome: I am vnderstanding, and I haue strength. Because that Solomon hath heere before much praised wisdome the which also he continueth in the beginning of this eight Chap∣ter: Pro. 3. 14. Pro. 1. 7. and to attaine therto that we must haue the feare of the Lord. For the feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge, and also he doth much praise wisedome vnto vs, to the ende that we shoulde aspire therevnto: for this cause nowe hee teacheth vs what it is to feare of the Lorde, that wee may knowe what wee haue to doe for Pro. 3. 7 to obteine wisedome. Heere before he hath briefly shewed vs it, when hee hath saide, Feare the Lorde, and withdraw thy selfe from euil. In this verse, hee saith the very same vnder diuerse wordes, and more at large. For hauing saide that the feare of the Lorde is to hate euill: he sheweth what kinde of euill he meaneth, when in the person of Wisedome he saith, I hate, &c. Wherevpon wee must note, that the wuil whereof hee speaketh, is not the mise∣ries and calamities which happē vnto vs in this present life, nor that the torments that the wicked do & shall suffer after the temporall
death. Wherefore those which feare God for the regarde of suche euils, haue not truely the feare of God, but as the diuelles haue, doe they feare the tormentes: they feare God as a theefe feareth the Iudge Euen so they deserue that God should shew himself such towards them, as the iust and sharpe iudge doeth shewe himselfe towardes the theeues, that is, after the inditement and condemna∣tion hee sendeth them to the gallowes, there too ende their dayes: the which shall happen vnto them, except they chaunge their man∣ners, and that in steede of fearing the tormentes, they hate their wicked life, which is the euil whereof Solomon speaketh in this place: hee himselfe doeth declare it, saying immediately, I hate pride, &c. Amongst the euilles that wee must hate, there is pride and arrogancie, which are euilles cleane contrary to the feare of the Lord: for he that feareth God, truely submitteth himselfe with al humilitie to bee ordeined by his worde. Contrarily, the proude and arrogant doeth contemne both GOD and his worde, and thinke themselues wise enough to gouerne & rule themselues, and cannot suffer any correction, nor exhortation, but doe scoffe thereat: and as they scorne, so are they againe scorned of God. Wherefore wee must vnderstand that it is not without cause that Solomon admonisheth vs saying, Bee not wise in thine owne eyes: but feare the Lord, and come backe from euil. Secondly, the euil conuersation, the which is contrary also vnto the feare of the Lorde. For euill companies, wicked manners, and froward conditi∣ons cānot be followed without falling away, euen to the for getting of God, and making no conscience to offend him, and to doe wrong to our neighbours: and in so doing wee cast away the feare of the Lorde: they are of the number of them which forsake the right path to walke by darke wayes. From the which if wee will bee deliuered, and not bee like vnto them, let vs hold fast the feare of God, which is the beginning of wisedome. Then shall we vnderstand righte∣ousnesse, Pro. 2. 13 and iudgement, and equitie, and euery good path. Third∣ly, afrowarde mouth, the which sheweth plainely that a man hath Pro. 2. 9. not the feare of God, but is wicked and vngodly. It is not with∣out cause that such frowardnesse of mouth is hated of wisdome, Pro. 6. 12 & that they which loue wisdome, do abhor this frowardnes: for he that is wise, loueth the honor & glory of God, he greatly esteemeth
the sincere trueth and sounde doctrine: hee reioyceth at the good name of his neighbours: he reuerenceth the lawe of God: and so he taketh not the name of God in vaine, neither speaketh false wit∣nesse against his neighbour: he obeieth this commandement, Put frō thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee. If then we wil bee wise, the feare of God is needeful for vs to make vs to turne away from euill, which displeaseth God, and all men of good conscience. 14 I haue counsell, &c. For asmuch as there is none but de∣sireth to be wel counselled, and directed in his affaires, to the ende that they may be duely and rightly guided, that he may profit ther∣by, and take no hurt: forasmuch also as we are very glad to know, and be able to perfourme, and execute our thoughtes, willes, purpo∣ses, and enterprises, wee must be very carefull to haue wisdome: for it is she that counselleth those which take her, which doeth di∣rect Eccle. 9. 14. 15 them, which giueth them vnderstanding and strengtheneth thē. Solomon doeth declare it vs heere briefly, and Ecclesiastes doth like∣wise shewe the same. Heerein we may knowe that hee speaketh not of humane wisedome: for seeing it is foolish and vaine, & that it vanisheth away easily, wee cannot attribute the vertues vnto it, 1. Cor. 1. 18 &. 3. 18. Esay. 11. 2. whereof Saint Paule speaketh. They apperteine onely to the spirite of God. But we are not partakers of this spirite, except that wee re∣ceiue the worde of GOD, and that it bee deepely grauen in our heartes, in such wise that it be our guide and directer, and that ther∣by we may learne to walke manly, to beare all afflictions, and to re∣sist al temptations. Likewise this onely Worde is our wisedome & Deut. 4. 6 knowledge. It is no wonder then, though the world be so euill go∣uerned, though there be so much ignorāce, and that so muche peo∣ple fall, and are destroied, seeing this worde is so much despised as it is. We must also vnderstande that the schoole diuines do greatly erre, when they doe attribute vnto men free will, and the power to gouerne and guide themselues: for they blaspheme against the ho∣ly Ghost, and are vnthankeful, or at leastwise endeuour to bring all the worlde to vnthankefulnesse, and are arrogant, when, so much as in them lieth, they dispossesse the holy Ghost of his benefites and giftes, and attribute them vnto men, and in this manner hee tur∣neth them away from the true wisedome. Wherefore eschuing thē
as a deadly pestilence, thrusting them away as doung and filthinesse, let vs take heede wee smel not too much of them: but let vs harken vnto sobrietie. The which wee shal doe, if with humblenes wee ac∣knowledge Rom. 12. 3. Iohn. 15. 5. 2. Cor. 3. 5. Philip. 2. 1. ourselues to be the graftes, and that wee truly confesse with Saint Paule, that we are not able of ourselues, but our strēgth commeth of God. Let vs not then be proude and arrogant: but by humilitie of mind, let vs occupie ourselues about our saluatiō &c. This humilitie is very necessary for vs, when our eternal saluation lyeth vpon it, sith, that in lesse things we haue need of wisedome to guide & gouerne ourselues, without the which our temporal af∣faires, which are nothing in comparison of our soules cannot stand, but fal to decay. Solomon doeth well shewe it, when he sayeth, 15 By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iustice. 16 By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth. When wisedom speaketh thus, she wel sheweth that counsel & wisedome are hers, &c. For a king doeth not truly raigne, except he gouerne his people by good counsel and wisedome, but rather is a tyrant, if hee woulde haue al goe after his fantazie, and that his wil must serue for al reason. Likewyse a king doeth not reigne except hee can defende his subiectes against the violence of the wic∣ked which trouble them, and seeke their destruction: but is an y∣dol. Likewise without such vertues the magistrates which sit in the iudgement seate, shal not bee able to yeelde vnto euery man his owne, but doe wrong vnto many, beeing led by their affections, and proceeding by accepting of persons. To bee shorte, there are neither Princes, Lordes, nor iudges which can rule as they ought, except they bee indued with these vertues, but doe exercise tyran∣nie and crueltie. Al kings, counsellers, Princes, Lordes, and iudges must then learne wisedome, and bee obedient thereunto, if they wil rule and reigne as they ought, and doe their office, acknow∣ledging what place they holde, and that the Lorde of Lordes, to Psal. 2. 8. whome they owe homage and high seruice, is aboue them to de∣stroy them and confounde them, except they doe their duety. For to Exod. 18. 21. 2. Chro. 19. 6. be wel instructed, they must be such as Iethro demandeth & coun∣selleth
Moyses to choose: and such as Iosaphat describeth. If wee haue not such Lords, we must impute the same vnto our sinnes, and patiētly to beare the yoake, prouided alwaies that in obeying them, wee doe neither offende God nor our neighbours: for it is not law∣ful to rebel against them, though they bee wicked: for they are ordeined, not by men, but by the diuine prouidence, as So∣lomon doeth shewe it by the woordes aboue saide: and as S. Paule Rom. 13. 1. also treateth of it. 17 I loue them that loue me: and they that seeke mee early, shal finde mee. 18 Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteousnesse. 19 My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine siluer. Wisedome not only maketh account of the greate men of the worlde, for to cause them to walke duelie in their vocation, and to prosper them: but of what estate, or condition soeuer we be, if wee delight in wisedome, and that wee bee careful to gouerne ourselues thereafter, we shal not faile to bee wise. Solomon doeth signifie it, when he introduceth wisedome, which saith, That she loueth them that loue her. Notwithstanding we ought not to thinke that it is in our libertie or free wil to become wise of ourselues, & compel God by his wisedome to loue vs, and that wee shoulde finde him, ex∣cept that hee himselfe seeke vs first, and drawe vs to him and holde vs fast. The which hee doeth, when he doeth offer vs his worde, and wee doe loue it, and seeke it early or diligently, if our delight bee in the same. Wee wil then take these woordes, as if wisedome did say, when I offer my selfe by preaching and corrections, and Iohn. 3. 16. Rom. 5. 8. 1. Iohn. 4. 9. 10 Ge. 6. 8. & 12. 1 Exod. 3. 8. Ier. 7. 24. & 25. 3. 4. &. 35. 15. that I am not despysed, then doe I make men feele my sweetnesse and gentlenesse, my helpe and gouernement. Nowe that wee are beloued before that wee doe loue, it is certaine, and also that we be sought for, and drawne: the grace that Noe founde, doeth shewe it vs, and the departure of Abraham, and the deliuerance of the chil∣of Israel out of the lande of Egipt, &c. And when God saieth by his Prophets, that he rose vp early and sent his seruantes the Prophetes:
And when Iesus Christ saith, The sonne of man is come to saue that which is lost, &c. Whē then we shal loue wisdome, let vs know that it is because she loueth vs, and when we shal finde her, it is because Mat. 18. 11. she draweth vs, making vs diligent to seeke her. Wee ought not to feare that we shoulde labour in vaine, and loose our paine for to loue wisedome, and to seeke the same: for she loueth not in words, but in trueth: and they which seeke her, doe not finde her vnpro∣uided. Solomon doth shew it, saying, 18 Riches and honour, &c. Wherevpon followeth also, that they which finde her, returne not backe emptie. For sith that wise∣dome doth loue them, shee cannot leaue thē comfortlesse, but doth participate of al her riches vnto them, so farre as is expedient: for also that which she possesseth, she onely holdeth to bestow vpō her friendes, and to lift them vp to honour and glory. If then wee desire to be rich with the true riches, let vs loue wisdome, and seeke her betimes in the morning with al diligence: so doing, wee shall not be rich onely for one time, but we shal haue durable riches. Wherfore Pro. 3. 13. 14. we may conclude, That blessed is the man that findeth wisedome, and the man that draweth knowledge vnto him. And also that her merchandize is better then the merchandize of siluer. Such things doe waste and are transitorie, subiect vnto stealing and corruption. These are not then the riches that we must loke for in seeking wise∣dome, and appliyng thereto our heartes: But wee must lay vp our Mat. 16. 17. 33. treasures in heauen, &c. so doing we shall want no riches: and as our Lord doth giue vs good witnes therof, when he saith, First seeke the kingdome of God & the righteousnes therof, & al other things shalbe giuen vnto you: Neither is it vnto the desire of tēporal goods that Solomō laboureth to draw vs, when he speaketh of wisdomes riches, he doth shew it whē he saith, that wisdome goeth with righ∣teousnes: as if he did say, that if we wil be partakers of the riches & honours of wisdome, & of this durable riches, wee must aspire vnto righteousnes, which wee shal attaine, if trusting in the goodnesse of God, we abhorre al hypocrisie and deceit, al iniury & violence, and doe imploy ourselues to giue vnto euery man his owne so farre as we can. It is then a good thing to loue wisedome, and for to seeke it, yea it is most necessary: for seeing that these thinges belong vnto her, it foloweth that they which do despise and reiect thē, must remain in pouertie & dishonor, albeit that for their wealthines they
are honoured of the worlde for a very little time: for as their riches are of no continuance, euen so therewith they sodenly fall into con∣fusion and shame, being destitute of al righteousnesse, they are pla∣ced in the rancke with infidels and vngodly. Al they which shal con¦temne the worde of God, which is the true wisedome, are in great danger to become very poore and confounded, except that they con¦uert through true repentance and sounde faith, and become louers of wisedome, and do seeke her betimes in the morning. Contra∣ly it is saide, that she wil exhalt them that shal honour her, and that Pro. 4. 8. she will imbrace them that doe glorifie her. 19 My fruite is better, &c: For that, that wisedome hath saide that riches and honours, &c. she inferreth most fitly that her fruite is better than golde, &c. For golde, stones, and siluer are Pro. 3. 18 of smal continuance, but this that wisedome bringeth foorth, con∣tinueth for euer. It is the tree of life, to them that lay holde on her. For to giue vs a tast of this fruite and reuenew, Solomon is not con∣tented already to haue shewed vs this profite and vtilitie, but for to stirre vs vp moreouer, he repeateth the same wordes, saying, My reuenewes is better &c. This repetition is very needeful for to sharpen our appetite: for of our nature we are so out of tast, that we loue better the shadowe of thornes and reedes, and to eate of their sharpe and sowre fruite; then to rest vnder the tree of life, and to be refreshed with her sweete and pleasant fruite: wee are more careful of the goodes of this worlde, then of the worde of GOD. Heerein wee faile very fouly, and therefore are well worthie of great rebuke: for wee sooner beleeue our sensual appetite, and doe more gladly follow the affection of our flesh, then the wisedome of God, the which doth offer herselfe vnto vs with al riches and glo∣ry, not as the worlde, which puffeth vp and maketh them proude, that haue this riches, and doeth turne them away from the right way for to commit all vnrighteousnes, by spoyling al on sides what they can lay handes vpon. Wisedome which doeth communicate herselfe vnto vs by the worde, doth not so deale with vs: but as she saith, 20 I cause to walke in the way of righteousnesse, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.
21 That I may cause them that loue mee, to inherite sub∣stance, and I wil fil their treasures. They which loue Wisedome and doe seeke her in the Word, so that they finde her, are partakers of the giftes of the holy Ghost, which is the Spirite of Wisdome and knowledge, &c. Thus he gui∣deth Esai. 2. 11. the louers of Wisedome in such sort, that the riches wherwith Wisedome doth blesse them, doe serue to no other purpose then to lead them vnto al holines and innocencie, that being ascerteined of the goodnesse of God towards them, they should loue & feare her, in such wise that they should be such towards their neighbours, as they know that God is towards thē, that is to say, that they shoulde doe no wrong, nor iniurie vnto any man, but shoulde bee readie to serue euerie man in true brotherly charitie, yelding to al men the duetie according to their office: so doing they shal walke in the path of righteousnes, the which requireth that wee shoulde assure our¦selues in God by Iesus Christe, and that by his feare and reuerence wee shoulde loue our neighbours, so that wee should doe wrong to none, but yeelde to euery man that which belongeth vnto him. If we be louers of Wisedome, she maketh vs suche, and therewith she maketh vs to walk in the midst of the paths of iudgement: that is to say, that shee causeth vs to become so gentle, and ful of succour, that we can not abide any to doe wrong to our neighbours, but wil deliuer them so much as we can. In this sense, must wee take iustice and iudgement, wherewith we must be armed, and also so muche as lyeth in vs, to arme others that are vnder our charge, as it is saide of Abraham, I knowe that hee wil commaund his children, and his fa∣milie Gen. 18. 19. after him, that they keepe the way of the Lorde to doe righte∣ousnes and iudgement. If we doe and teache so, wee shal not want: for this, that Wisedome so maketh them which loue her, to walke, is, as she sayeth, 21 That I may cause them, &c. This is no temporal possessi∣on: for the riches of this worlde do not fil the treasures. The more a man hath, the more he desireth, so that they doe not satisfie and fil. The worldlinges then doe thinke that their treasures are neuer full enough. This substance which is spoken of heere, is eternall. Solomon doeth shewe it by this worde to inherite. For as a father leaueth the heritage to his childrē, for to passe from one to another, from kindred to kindred, and cannot be voided thereof, but by euill
gouernment of their side, or of the violence of men: euen so the heauenly heretage can not be taken a way from the children of wis∣dome, but shal eternally possesse her: and in this sorte their trea∣sures shalbe filled. Herein we may and ought to vnderstand, that we haue nothing, except God giue it vs by his wisedom, and that with∣out it we are neuer contented. And seeing there is none of vs but desireth to haue and to fil his treasures, we ought wel to loue wis∣dome. It is shee onely which giueth the heritage, and which filleth to the brimme. 22 The Lord hath possessed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde. 23 I was set vp from euerlasting, from the beginning, and before the earth. 24 When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water. 25 Before the mountaines were setled: and before the hils, was I begotten. 26 He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the dust in the world. 27 When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he set the compasse vpon the deepe, 28 When he established the cloudes aboue, when hee confir∣med the fountaines of the deepe, 29 When hee gaue his decree to the sea, that the waters shoulde not passe his commandements: when hee ap∣pointed the foundations of the earth, 30 Then was I with him as a nourisher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him, 31 And tooke my solace in the compasse of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men. To the ende that we shoulde not thinke that wisdome, which hath so much extolled herselfe from the beginning of this Chapter, shoulde not be such as she hath declared of herselfe, & that it is not an imagination framed in the braine of man, that he hath yeelded of his owne goodnesse, Solomon doeth describe her eternal power:
and therefore he saith, The Lorde hath possessed wisedome in the beginning of his way. Wherein he giueth vs to vnderstande, that God hath neuer purposed any thing, and that he hath neuer ordey∣ned any thing in his eternal decree without wisedome: that is to say, that this wisedome was already, before that God had put in ex∣ecution any of his purposes, and ordinances: as it was right neces∣sary: for it followeth wel, that if it was in the beginning of the way of the Lorde, that it was before al things, consequently, that it is no creature which hath takē his essence with the things created. Wher∣of we must conclude that his being is eternal, and likewise his pow∣er. And forasmuch as there is no eternal being, nor eternal power, but onely in God: it foloweth therefore, that this wisedome is in God, and that it is nothing distincted nor separated from God, and consequently, that the same is God: yet least we should confounde the persons which are in God, we must beleeue and confesse, that in so much as God is Father, that his Wisedome which is his eternall Sonne and his Word, is distinct from his fatherhood. That this wis∣dome is the eternal Word, and the Sonne of God, Saint Iohn doth shewe in his Gospel, when he doeth attribute vnto the Word, that which Solomon doeth attribute heere vnto Wisedome: that is to wit, when he sayeth, In the beginning was the Word. When then it is said, The Lord hath possessed me, let vs know that it is the Sonne Ioh. 1. 1. of God which speaketh. And so, when we haue saide, that our wise∣dome is in the only Word of God. We haue not meant that it is in the woorde that soundeth in our corporal eares, but in the same that so penetrateth our hartes and mindes, that we are made newe creatures. Neuertheles the outward preaching is not vnfruitful, but profitable and necessarie: for it is the meanes and instrument wher∣with God is serued to make the liuely woorde to pearce into vs: & for this cause S. Paule douteth not to say (when hee speaketh of preaching) that the Gospel is the power of GOD to saluati∣on to euery one that beleeueth. Againe, Faith commeth by hearing, Rom. 1. 16. & 17, and hearing by the woorde of God. If then wee despise preaching, we do not despise men, but the Sonne of God: we refuse our salua∣tion, & make post hast vnto our damnation: we skorne at the wise∣dom of GOD, and reioyce in folly. Thus doing, wee walke;
cleane contrary to that wee shoulde, yea against nature, the which teacheth vs to honour our elders. And sith the Lorde hath posses∣sed, &c. Wisedome is very auncient. Wherefore wee muste honour it when she offereth herselfe vnto vs by the mouth of her Ministers. 23 I was set vp from euerlasting. For to declare the eter∣nitie of Wisedome more largely and more particularly, Solomon bringeth her in, saying, that she hath bene set vp. Nowe the worde which he vseth, hath in his tongue diuers significations, it signifieth to ordeine, it signifieth also to be king, and to beare the chiefe rule. These two significations agree verie wel with the wisdome of God: but we must take heede that we imagine not, that as Kings & Prin∣ces doe ordeine Gouernours in their prouinces, which are their subiects and inferiours, that in this maner God hath ordeined wise∣dome ouer his workes, as his inferiour. For wisedome is equall vn∣to God, seeing it is of the same essence with him, and that in God there is neither superiour nor inferiour, neither higher nor lower: but there is an equalitie exempte from al difference and diuersitie. Therefore when wisedome sayeth, that she hath bene set vp, or that she hath had the kingdome or the principalitie, let vs vnderstande none other thing, but that God hath decreed and ordeined al things by his wisedome, and thereby hath made and ordered al his works, and thereby reigneth and ruleth ouer al the world. And when she sayeth, from euerlasting; and from the beginning, we must not de∣uise that wisedome began from the beginning, wee must not deuise that wisedome began to bee set vp and to beare rule. For seing, that as it is saide, in the beginning God created heauen and earth, &c, And wisedome hath beene set vp afore the earth, wee must vnder∣stand that from euerlasting, and from the beginning, and before all worldes, and before any beginning, that is to say: from euerlasting, and before al things. For as the diuine wisedome had no beginning of essence, so also it began not to be ordeined and to beare rule. And forasmuch as wisedome hath bene eternally set vp in the counsel of God, she may wel say, I haue counsel, &c. And seeing that her go∣uernement is eternal, shee may well say, That by me Kinges raigne, &c. Furthermore, they that despyse the prea∣ching of the Word, by the which wisedome doeth offer herself for
to doe that wherevnto she hath beene ordeined, doe enterprise an vnpossible thing, to wit, to breake the ordinance of God, and there∣in they shewe their foolishnes and arrogancie, rising vp against an eternal gouernment, whervnto they ought to do homage, that they may obteine true and strong being, and finally to reigne with Wise∣dome for euer. They shewe also their ingratitude, not acknowled∣ging that al riches proceede from wisedome, and that without it no∣thing can stande. They are then greatly out of their wittes: for by contemning the Worde, so much as in them lyeth, they make wise∣dome vaine, and seeke the destruction of the worlde, which can not stande without theirs. Contrarily, they that haue a reuerence vnto this Word, so much as in them is, doe mainteine the ordinance and establish the gouernment of wisedome: and as they desire that she should reigne and rule, so much as they can helpe, they do make her to reigne: also they can not perishe, for wisedome loueth them, and openeth herselfe vnto them. Wherefore it is a sure thing that they shalbe partakers of this eternal gouernment. These thinges are past the reach of mans wit, and therefore the worldly wise, can not com∣prehend them, there is nothing but Fayth that can vnderstand thē. 24 When there were no depthes. &c. For to proceed in shew∣ing the eternitie of wisedome, he sayeth, that she was begotten be∣fore that the deepes were, &c. Wherein he seemeth that he speaketh against that which hee hath saide here before, and that in willing to shewe the eternal being of wisedome, he sheweth that she hath not beene alwayes: for shee sayeth, that shee hath beene begot∣ten: and by this it seemeth, that there hath beene a certaine time wherein shee was not, and that hee which begatte her, was before her. This argument might haue place in carnal generation: but here is a diuine generation spoken of, the which hindereth not that, which is begotten to bee eternall. Also the Father hath not begunne to beget his wisedome, but hath begotten it eternally. The wise worldlings which woulde vnderstand and know al things by natural reason, or by experience, wil deride the same, because they can comprehende nothing: but we consider it by Fayth. And for to doe this wel, let vs knowe that amongst the properties & per∣sons which are in God, which is one, there is such distinction, that to the Father we attribute the beginning of working and creating,
we hold him for the fountaine & spring of al things. To the Sonne, we attribute wisedome, counsel, and the gouernment of things that are made. To the holy Ghost, we attribute the power and efficacie of working and executing. And albeit, that the eternitie of the Father, is also the eternitie of the Sonne and of the holy Ghost: (for God could neuer be without his wisedome and power: and in the eter∣nitie, there ought neither first nor last to bee sought) yet is it not a vaine thing nor superfluous to obserue this order in the eternitie, to wit, that we set the Father first in order, and in the seconde place, the Sonne which commeth of him: and in the third place, the ho∣ly Ghost which proceedeth from them both. For also the minde of euery one inclineth to consider first God, afterwardes his wisedome which springeth from him, and finally his power, whereby hee ex∣ecuteth the decrees and ordinances of his counsel. By this reason wee say that the Sonne commeth onely of the Father, but that the holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Sonne together. Albeit then that wee can not consider the wisedome of God, but as it procee∣deth from the Father, and as it is engendered of him, yet we must take heede that in this generation we inuent nothing temporal, car∣nal, or humane: but rather let vs worship this generation, behol∣ding it by Fayth, and let vs take heede from searching further then Scriptures doe teach vs thereof: otherwise wee shoulde deserue to bee blinded, and punished for our ouer great curiositie. The gene∣ration then of wisedome wil not forbid vs to beleeue his eternitie. For well to inculcate the same vnto vs, Solomon standeth long to preferre wisedome before thinges visible, whereof man himselfe doeth not comprehend the beginning, but do seeme vnto him that they are from euerlasting: but by Fayth wee vnderstand that the worldes were made by the worde of God. For the inuisible things of him, that is, his eternal power and Godhead, are seene by the Hebr. 11. 3. Rm. 1. 20. creation of the worlde, &c. And for to beate into vs this eterni∣tie, hee is not content briefly to say, that wisedome was begotten before the earth, but he nameth the deepes (which are the deepe waters) the fountaines. He reciteth euery thing particularly, to the ende that in the least thinges of the worlde, wee might learne to knowe the wisedome of God: and also seeing it is first, let vs contemne these earthly thinges, if they doe hinder vs to aspire after
wisedome. For although they be creatures of God, and that ve∣rie good, yet are they nothing, if wee compare them vnto wise∣dome. Moreouer, when situation and places are spoken of, we ought to vnderstand that God in the creation of the worlde, hath set al things in good order by wisdom, and hath set euery thing in his place, and that the insensible thinges doe keepe stil their situations and places: but the diuels and men are so miserable and vnreasonable, that they haue verie quickly left their place, and are fallen into extreeme con∣fusion: out of the which men can not rise againe, except that wise∣dome doeth communicate herselfe vnto them. 27 When hee prepared, &c. After that Solomon hath shew∣ed the eternitie of wisedome, because it went before the inferiour earthly, and watry creatures, he proceedeth to prooue this eterni∣tie, because that it was before the heauens, and before the ordering of the superiour waters, and before the sea had his markes set, and that the earth was fully setled. And when the scripture sheweth vs, that God hath saide, Let light be made, &c. By the worde of the Lorde were the heauens made: we must vnderstande that the pre∣paration, the constitution, the compasse, establishment, fortificati∣on and ordinance, wherof here is mention made, is nothing but his wisedome and eternal Worde, the which also as it is here tolde, Gen. 1. 3. Psal. 33. 6. was with God, when he ordered and ordeined his creatures. Fur∣thermore, when we reade these things, we ought not only to thinke vpon the eternitie of wisedome, but also vpon the goodnesse and mercie of God, wherewith he was mooued towardes men, when hee made and ordered al these thinges: for hee prepared them for the vse of men. The which hee hath wel shewed, when he made vs Lordes of al the world. Then was I with him. After that wisedome hath saide, that she was then there with God, when he prepared, &c. shee sheweth that she was not idle, but that she wrought with him, not as inferi∣our, but as an equal felow: for she saith not that she was vnder him, but with him: not that she was an hādmaid, or seruāt, or apprētice, but as a nourisher or mistresse of work. Wherin Solomō doth shew vs the eternal power & diuinitie of the sonne of God. The which S.
Iohn sheweth, Shee was in the beginning, &c. Our Lorde himselfe Ioh. 1. 2. & 5. 17. also doth shew it, saying, My Father worketh hetherto, and I work. And to shewe that shee was so good a woorke mistresse that there was no worke too harde for her, and also that shee was not grieued with his worke, but that she delighted in the same, she sayeth, And I was daily his delight. Nowe looke what shee wrought in the time of the creation and ordering of the world, she doeth yet still, as we may see, when she sayeth, reioycing alway before him. Wee may also say that the Father hath taken pleasure in that which hee hath wrought by his Sonne from the beginning, and yet stil at this present doeth delight in his woorkes, as in a most pleasaunt recre∣ation: but although that this sentence bee true, and that it may be grounded vpon the saying of our Lord, I doe alwayes those things Ioh. 8. 29. that please him: yet the first sense is the most agreeable to the line of Solomons texte. Likewise the manner of a maister workeman (which is verie cunning in his arte,) is to take pleasure in his work, and to doe his worke so easily and so handsomely, that it seemeth he worketh not, but playeth and passeth a way the time ioyfully. And after this sense we may gather hereof, that the goodnesse and grace of the Lorde was bent from the beginning towardes men: for they had not deserued that Wisedome should delight to doe her worke for their vse: for euen without it, they had not bene. But although that man through pride and vnthankfulnesse had deserued to be re∣iected of wisedome, and to be abhorred and detested of him yet for al that, she hath not left of from her work, or ceased from the same vpon the earth, which is giuen vnto man for his habitation & nou∣rishment. This continuation is shewed vs, when he sayeth, 31 And tooke my solace, &c. The great and wonderfull mercy of our Lorde God, is here set foorth vnto vs, when he ceaseth not to take pleasure in mainteining man on the earth, seeing that by his sinne, and also by continuance therof from Father to Sonne, he had deserued, and stil daily doth deserue that the earth should sinke, and not to beare him any lōger, but that he should miserably perish, and goe to eternal damnation. Nowe howe wisedome hath con∣tinued and stil doeth continue to solace herselfe about the earth (which Solomon most fitly calleth the earth of God: for hee sayeth not simplie, in the compasse of the earth, but in the compasse of his
earth for also it is his, and the contentes thereof, seeing hee hath created al thinges) howe is it I say, that shee taketh her pleasure, Gene. 1. 1. Psal. 24. 1. & 50. 12. &c. The scripture doeth teache vs howe: When she is filled with so many louing promises, aduertisements, exhortations, corrections, and threatnings. Immediatly after the fal of Adam, wisedom began this solace, and continued the same vnto Seth, Enoch, Noe, Abra∣ham, to the Patriarkes, to Moses and to the Prophetes. But this so∣lace was yet more plainly knowne when this wisedome (which is the eternal worde,) was made flesh, and dwelt amongst vs, & that Iohn. 1. 14. Luke. 15. 14. in his doctrine and miracles men behelde his glory, &c. This is the sheepheard that seeketh his strayed sheepe, &c. This ioye & solace contineweth stil as we see it, when in spite of Sathan and al his mainteiners and ministers, the Gospel is purely preached, and that we haue the Sacramentes whole and in their perfection, and that the Lorde hath established amongest vs the forme of a true Church. Heerein wee know what wisedomes sport is, which shalbe deerly sold vnto the vnthankful, to whom God hath sent his Gospel, without being bannished, or hauing forsaken their coūtrie or goods to bee partakers of this solace. The Lorde hath alreadie begun to punish this vngratitude and contempt in some places: It is a sure thing that hee wil finishe his woorke in tyme conuenient, and then scorners and contemners shal feele it. Furthermore, seeing the Ministers of the woorde are the instrumentes of wisedome, they learne heere that they ought not to esteeme their ministery as a burthen and painful thing, but as a ioy∣ful and comfortable matter, and so much as they possibly can, they shoulde solace themselues euery where with their brethren: Mat. 28. 19. Marke. 16. 15 I say, so much as they can, for they ought to exceede their voca∣tion. 32 Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for blessed are they that keepe my wayes. 33 Heare instruction, and bee yee wise, and refuse it not: blessed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the postes of my dores.
34 For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & shal obteine fa∣uour of the Lorde: 35 But he that sinneth against me, hurteth his owne soule: and all that hate me, loue death. When wisedome hath declared what manner of one shee is, to whome shee belongeth, what riches shee hath, and howe aun∣cient shee is, shee concludeth that wee must heare her, if wee wil doe and followe what shee commandeth, and teacheth, promising felicitie to those that shal folow her gouernement, and suffer them∣selues to be ruled by her. Now shee calleth her children to heare. Wherein wee are taught to be assured, that if wee hearken vnto the Euangelical worde, which is the voice of the greate Pastour, who is our wisedome, we are children of wisedome, and the sheepe of Ie∣sus Christ, and are of God. Contrarily, they that despyse this word, Iohn. 8. 47. &. 10. 27. are children of follie and of the Deuil. As then wisedome doeth sport herselfe, and passe her tyme, and taketh her solace with vs in speaking vnto vs by her ministers, and calleth vs her children: euen so al our ioye and delight ought to bee in hearing this voyce: and that without any delay, without putting of til to morrow: for shee wil presently bee hearde. And as without delay wee must heare, so must we also perseuer to heare, euen as wisedome doeth dayly con∣tinewe speaking vnto her children: for so long as she speaketh, it is alwaies to day, and shal last vnto the last day. In looking for the which, as wisedome doeth cal vs, so if we yeelde, she doeth accept and heare vs to giue vs saluation. But wee must marke wel that 2. Cor. 6. 2. wisedome saieth not generally, hearken: as if it were laweful to lende our eares vnto doctrines and traditions of men (for it hath beene euer forbidden) But wisedome sayeth, heare mee, declaring vnto vs that it is she onely that must bee hearde: whereof fol∣loweth that this wisedome is the Sonne of GOD, of whome it is saide, This is my wel beloued Sonne in whome I haue taken Math. 17. 5. my delight, heare him. Whome nowe if wee wil heare, wee must heare his ministers which doe preache vnto vs his pure word. And for to heare them as wee ought, and as wisedome demaundeth, it is not ynough to hearken vnto the doctrine, but the heart also is re∣quired theretoo, that out of that affection therof we might rule our
life in al holines and honestie, in al iustice and innocency. We ought so to vnderstand it, when for to intice vs to heare, it is not said, that blessed are they which heare: but which keepe the waies of wise∣dome. Our Lorde also, who is the true wisedome, is not contented only to bee hearde. 33 Heare instruction, &c. Because we are not onely neg∣ligent to goe whether wisedome calleth vs, but also it is irkesome to heare it, and in this wise wee seeke our destruction and damna∣tion: for this cause wisedome taketh pitie of vs, and desiring our ioye and saluation, doeth againe admonish vs to heare instruction: and heerein shee sheweth that it is she which speaketh, when wee are exhorted and admonished, when we are corrected and reproo∣ued by the woorde. And for to shewe vs to what ende tendeth in∣struction, shee addeth, and bee wise. And thus, without instruction wee are without wisedome, and but fooles. Wherefore, forasmuch as we cānot abide to be counted fooles, but desire that men should esteeme vs wise, let vs folow and embrace instruction, and not put her backe, as wisedome doth admonish vs: otherwise she wil refuse vs. Contrarily, it is said, Blessed is the man, &c. When we haue to do with any great Lord, we neuer cease to keepe watche and warde at his gate, and to looke when hee should come foorth, or that hee wil cal vs vnto him that tary and waite for him. So great desire haue we to come to the end of that which wee desire, that we continew stil looking. And if in worldly things we haue such perseuerance: by a more strong reason we ought to be very watchful after wisdom, & folowe her counsel and commandementes in much constancie & perseuerance, and neuer to cease, seing that wee haue alwaies neede of her: as she doth wel signifie, when shee woulde haue vs alwayes to watch at her gates, & to keepe the postes of her house. Wherin againe we learne, that it is not ynough for vs to heare, but it behoo∣ueth vs also to be led with an earnest affection to vnderstand what belongeth to wisedom, and to folow it: not for any litle time of our life, but continually, whiles wee are in this worlde. If wee doe thus, assuring ourselues of the goodnes of GOD towards vs, wee shal not bee voide of wisedome: for by asking it in true faith, it shalbee giuen vs. Beeing thus indued with wisedome. Mat. 7. 7. Ia. 1. 5. though wee were the most miserable and cursed of al the Worlde,
after the sense of the fleshe, and outwarde apparance, wee shal ne∣uer perish. 34 For he that findeth me, &c. As S. Paule saith, The giftes and callings of God are without repentance. Whereof foloweth that this life which commeth of wisedome, is prolonged more and Rom. 11. 29. more: and that this fauour is not withdrawne, but rather encrea∣seth. For vnto euery one that hath, shalbe giuen, & he shal aboūde. And seeing that by wisedome wee haue these riches, that is to say Mat. 25. 29. life, and the fauour from whence life proceedeth, it foloweth wel that by our woorkes we do not deserue that God shoulde fauoure vs and holde vs in his grace: otherwise it should bee no grace not fauour, but recompence and reward that God did owe vs. Neither also doe we deserue life, seing it commeth of fauour. Nowe that life commeth of fauour, the creation of man doeth witnesse it: for hee had not deserued that God shoulde place him in the worlde. Wee haue yet a more manifest witnesse after the fal of man. For albeeit hee had deserued death, as God had threatened him, yet in steede Gen. 2▪ 17. of eternal death as hee had deserued, hee receiueth promise of life. And sith it is by promise, it commeth not by woorkes, otherwise the promise shoulde bee abolished. Seeing also that of wisedome wee haue life and fauour, it foloweth that wisedom is not a quali∣tie gotten by the industrie and labour of men, but it commeth from the Sonne of God, by whome we haue life and fauour. The lawe was giuen by Moses, but grace and trueth came by Iesus Christ. As Moses lifted vp the Serpent in the wildernesse, so must also the sonne Iohn. 1. 17. & . 14. & 11. 25. of man be lifted vp: That whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shoulde not perish, but haue eternal life. I am the resurrection and the life saieth the Lord, &c. Now seeing that by finding wisedom, we obtein such riches, wee ought to bee very careful to seeke it, and to seeke her in trueth, and not as the Hipocrytes, vnto whome it is saide, What haue I to doe with the multitudes of your sa∣crifices? (sayth the Lorde.) &c. Wee must seeke it by fayth and re∣pentance. Esay. 1. 11. & 55. 6. Mat. 7. 7. Seeke the Lorde whiles hee may be found: cal vpon him whiles hee is nye. Thus dooing, we shal finde and obteine that which wee seeke for. Aske and yee shal haue, &c. If then wee wil
finde wisedome, and thereby obteine life and fauour towards God, we must renounce the euil that displeaseth wisedome, taking heede that wee doe not offende her, and doe nothing, by hatred against her. In this maner we shal finde grace before the Lorde, wherby wee shal preserue our soules from death. 35 But he that sinneth, &c. We may inferre this same of that which hath bin attributed heeretofore to wisedome & to her chil∣dren. For it followeth, that hee which seeketh wisedome reue∣rently and with such loue as he ought, and findeth her, hee findeth fauour and life: and that they which desire wisedome, and doe not vouchsafe to seeke her, and so doe offend and hate her, that they seeke death, as a thing of them beloued and desired. And so they do great wrong vnto their soules, for they do altogither destroy them. And sith also that Solomon setteth to offende, against to finde, wee ought to vnderstand that they which despise the woorde, whereby wisedome doth offer herselfe vnto vs, to the ende that wee might finde her, and do skorne her, and refuse her, and offende wisedome, & sinne against her: and sith that wisedom hath so much & so great riches (as it hath bin saide) wherof without her we cannot bee par∣takers, it foloweth that they which offende her, doe wittingly de∣priue themselues, and so doe wrong to their soules, depryuing them of greate riches, without the which wee cannot but looke for all misery. And whē in opposition of drawing fauour, he setteth hate: he sheweth vs that the contemners of the grace of God doe hate wisedome, and consequently their life: and seeing there is no meane way betweene life and death, it is necessary, that if they hate wise∣dome (the which only giueth life) that they loue death. Wherein, we may knowe that they are out of their wittes, and that they haue not so much vnderstanding as brute beastes, the which can tel to fly from that which hurteth them, and to desire and seeke that which is profitable for their life.
The nienth Chapter. 1 WIsedome hath built her house, and heawen out her seuen pillers. 2 She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepa∣red her table. 3 She hath sent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the highest places of the Citie saying, 4 Who so is simple let him come hither: and to him that is destitute of wisedome, she saith, 5 Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne. ALbeit that a greate and mighty king of this worlde hath many Castells, Townes, Cities and Prouinces vn∣der his power, and that hee may abyde and dwel where it pleaseth him: yet wil hee builde or choose some certaine place, the which hee will call his, because hee will take there his most delight, and wil dwell there about more commonly then in any other place of his countrie. Euen so, although the iuris∣diction of wisedome stretcheth farre, and that al the worlde doe appertaine vnto her, and that she filleth both heauen and earth: notwithstanding shee hath built her an house, the which shee cal∣leth hers, because shee hath built the same for to dwel, and there∣in to take her sporte and pastime, and to mainteine the same that it perish not, nor go to decay. And sith that wisdome hath an house, wherein shee keepeth her continual and dayly residence, if wee wil finde her, wee must seeke for her at her house: there wil shee offer her selfe vnto vs, and bestowe her riches vpon vs, so much as shal∣be expedient. But to finde this house, wee must knowe where it
is builded, and of what matter, and howe it is placed. First of al, although that heere wee heare spoken of a house and of buyl∣ding, yet must wee not ymagine any thing that is earthly or car∣nal. For wisedome is not like vnto the Princes of this worlde, who as they are earthly, so doe they builde their houses on earth, and of earthly matter, and doe set and grounsel them vppon lyke matter. Wisedome is diuine, heauenly and spiritual. Likewise her house standeth in heauen, about the throne of GOD: there shee hath layed the foundation on herselfe. If then wee wil finde wise∣dome, Heb. 13. 14. wee must aspire vnto heauen. For also heere wee haue no continuing Citie: but wee seeke one to come: And therefore our conuersation shoulde bee in heauen, so that wee should not walke after the fleshe, but after the spirit. If we thus looke vp to hea∣uen, this house of wisedome is made ours, not by merite, but because GOD hath prepared it for vs, if wee folowe the faith of the holy patriarkes, of whome it is written, They al dyed accor∣ding to faith, &c. And therefore wee may say with S. Paule, For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be destroyed, Heb. 11. 13. 2. Cor. 5. 1. wee haue a building giuen of God, that is, a house not made with handes, but eternal in heauen. Now we must vnderstand that as the foundation is spiritual and heauenly, euen so is the building there∣vpon, whereof one part is of the Angels which kept stil their first state, and haue not forsaken their dwelling, nor country: for if they had not bene grounded on this foundation, they could not, nor had beene able to haue standfast. Saint Paule doeth wel signifie it, when he saith, that the Father in the dispensation of the fulnes of times Ephe. 1. 10. 2 might gather togither in one al things both which are in heauen & which are in earth, euen in Christ, &c. Hee is also the head of the Angels, as immediatly thereafter hee sheweth, saying, that the fa∣ther hath set him at his right hande in the heauenly places, &c. Hee Col. 1. 15. is the first borne of euery creature. For by him were al thinges crea∣ted. The Angels then are a parte of wisedoms familie. The other parte of this house, are the elect and faithful called vnto the know∣ledge of the Gospel, and regenerate by the holy Ghost. Our Lorde doth so signifie it, when he saith, If any man loue mee, hee wil keepe Iohn. 14. 23. 1. Cor. 3. 16. 2. Cor. 6. 16. my worde: and S. Paule saith, Know yee not that ye are the temple of GOD? and, Yee are the Temple of the liuing GOD.
But some wil say, that if the elect are the habitation, of wisedome, that this house is distinguished, and that it is not all spiritual and heauenly: for men, though they bee elected, are earthly and carnall. The complaint of Saint Paule doeth wel shew it: so doth also the battaile betweene the flesh and the spirit. I answere, that man in so Rom. 7. 14. Gala. 5. 17. Iohn. 3. 6. much as hee is borne of the fleshe, is fleshly and doeth the woorkes of the fleshe: and so is not of the house of wisedome, and can∣not possesse the kingdome of God. But inasmuch as hee is re∣generate by the spirite, and walketh according theretoo, and not after the fleshe, hee is spiritual, and so is of the house of wisedome, and belongeth vnto the kingdome of GOD. Saint Paule doeth so giue vs to vnderstande it, when for to giue the rea∣son wherefore hee calleth the faithfull the temple of GOD, hee saieth, The spirit of GOD dwelleth in you, knowe yee not that 1. Cor. 3. 16. & 6. 19. your bodies are the temples of the holy Ghost? To the end then that wee may bee the spiritual house of wisedome, wee must bee renewed, that wee may put of our olde man, mortifying our earthly members. Saint Peter also doeth shew it, saying, Laying a∣side al maliciousnesse and all guyle, and dissimulation, and en∣uie, Col. 3. 9. 1. Pet. 2. 1. and all euill speaking, as newe borne babes desire the sincere milke of the woorde, &c. In this manner wee are fellowes vn∣to the Angels. You are come to the companie of innumerable Angels. And the Angel saieth, I am thy fellowe seruant and one of Heb. 12. 22. Apo. 19. 10. Heb. 1. 14. thy brethren, which haue the testimony of Iesus Christ. It is no wonder thereof, seeing they are our ministers. Nowe as touching wee haue companions and ministers so pure, wee must also studie to bee pure and cleane, that the house of wisedome may be pure and cleane. For to finde wisedom then, it is not needeful for vs to runne hither and thither, but only to clense ourselues. Thus dooing, though wee remaine on earth, our conuersation shalbee in heauen. . Cor. 7. 1. Philip. 3. 20. Whereuppon followeth that our earthly mansion doth not hinder but that the house of wisedome should be heauenly. For to shewe how and whereon this house is set, hee saith, that wisedome hath heawen out her seauen pillers, that is to say, many: for the number of seuen is taken for a great number vncertaine. Also we know not the number of the pillers that wisedome hath made and ordered since the creation of the worlde to this present, & shal make and or∣deine
vntil the last day for to mainteine, sustaine and repaire his house. We know wel there hath bin & shalbe more then seuen: but how many more, we know not. For it lyeth not in vs to number the holy Patriarkes, Prophets, Apostles, Euangelistes, Pastors, and Doctors that wisdom hath placed and wil place in her house, which is the Church and houshold of God. Those are called pillers of the house and buylding of wisedome, because that through their holy conuersation and pure doctrine of truth, by supplications, prayers, thanks giuing, by warnings and corrections, by exhortations & re∣prehentions: to bee shorte, by the ministery wherein God hath set them, they haue borne vp, doe beare vp, & shalbeare vp vnto the worlds end this house of wisedom. Not that wisedom, which is the true foundation, is not able and strong ynough for to vpholde it, when also she vpholdeth the pillers with al the rest: but it so plea∣seth him to honor men, vsing their ministerie without the which she could worke wel ynough, vpholding and mainteining her house of her own selfe, yea al things in heauē & earth: but bearing with our rudenes, & applying herselfe vnto our smal capacitie, shee ope∣neth herself vnto vs, she vpholdeth and keepeth vs in holines, righ∣teousnes, and truth by the meanes of our brethren like vnto vs. O∣therwise we should be confounded with his great glorie & maiesty. That by the Pillers the Pastours are signified, is shewed vs in Ie∣remie, I haue made thee a defensed Citie, and an yron piller, and Iere. 1. 18. Gal. 2. 9. walles of brasse against the whole Lande. And in Saint Paule, And when Iames, and Cephas, and Iohn knewe of the grace that was giuen vnto mee, which are counted to bee pillers. But when the ministers of the Churche haue this title of pillers, they ought thereby to learne diuers thinges. First of al that they ought not to exempt themselues from charge and care, nor flye labour and tra∣uell, but ought to sustaine and beare the Churche of God as vpon their shoulders, and shoulde not bee like the Pope which doth op∣presse it, and doeth deuoure the same, as a ranening woolfe with his like, as it is written, They bind burthens, &c. Secondly, that they Mat. 23. . Heb. . 4. ought not to thrust in themselues. Thirdly that they cannot by their industrie and labour attaine vnto this honour, but wisedome must heawe them out. The which she doeth, when she doth open herselfe vnto them by the worde, and that she calleth them to this
office, making them fit theretoo. A man can receiue nothing, except it bee giuen him from heauen. And not that wee are sufficient of Iohn. 3. 27. 2. Cor. 3. 5. ourselues to thinke any thing, as of ourselues. Our Lorde also doth wel shewe it, when he saith vnto his disciples, Truely the har∣uest is great, but the labourers are fewe. He declareth the same also, Mat. 9. 37. Luke. 24. 45. when hee opened the vnderstanding to his disciples for to vnder∣stande the scriptures. Albeeit then that the ministers of the worde are the pillers of the Churche, yet haue they nothing whereon to glorie. For who separateth thee? And what hast thou that thou hast not receiued? And, what is Paule then? and what is Apollo, but ser∣uantes, 1. Cor. 4. 7. by whome ye haue beleeued? But because they acknowledge themselues to bee pillers, they haue cause to humble themselues, se∣ing they coulde not prepare nor place themselues where they are, and should be voide of power and might, they coulde vpholde no∣thing, except the foundation did beare them and vpholde them, and that they did not beare and hold vp the whole building and house. Then there is nothing of theirs, but altogither of the foundatiō. S. Paule doeth wel shewe it, saying, By the grace of God I am that I 1. Cor. 15. 10. am. By this we may knowe that the Pope and his mainteiners are in no wise pillers of the house of wisedome, but are rather engines and instrumentes, beetels and hammers, for to destroy and ouer∣throwe, if they coulde by any meanes: but the woorde is vnfalli∣ble true, Vpon this stone wil I build my Church. Forasmuch as the Church is builded vpon the rocke, which is Christ, whereof the Mi∣nisters Mat. 16. 18. are a portion: it foloweth that this which wee haue saide, is true, that is to say, that the foundation beareth vp the pillers, and that they vpholde not the house of wisedom, but so far as the foun∣dation doth mainteine them. Of al these foresaid things foloweth, that albeit a minister be very diligent to exercise his office, and that hee mightily goe forewarde therein with constantnesse, yet can hee deserue nothing, but rather is thereby more bounde vnto GOD. The fryers then are very proude and arrogant, when by their trifles they thinke to merite, not only for themselues, but also for their be∣nefactours. Also this foloweth, that they which rebel and doe con∣temne the Ministers of the Church, doe seeke their owne decay & destruction, for they doe separate themselues from the foundation and the pillers.
2 She hath killed her victuall, &c. We do prooue that there is nothing more delectable vnto man then to haue ynough to eate and to drinke, & to find a table ready dressed. Al other delightes of the world are nothing, except we haue to fil our bellies: we cannot suffer to be deceiued, so that to giue order that the belly may be fil∣led, we wil apply ourselues to any thing that we can: & we thinke well of that house, where the table is dressed for al commers, that they may eate and drinke their fill. And therefore Solomon accom∣modating himselfe vnto our ignorance, willing to intice vs to de∣sire the house and table of wisedome, saieth that shee hath killed her victuall, and drawne her wine, &c. Wherein after a sorte hee compareth wisedome vnto the greate Lordes of this worlde. For as for to shewe their magnificence, and to haue a greate traine, they keepe open house for al men, and their table well furnished, and desire that al shoulde bee merie and make good cheere, that men might praise them for their liberalitie: euen so Wisedome hauing a house wel furnished, is farre vnlike vnto the niggardes and couetous, who the more riche they are, the more loth are they to touche the same, lest they shoulde diminishe them: they dare not vse nor spende them, so much the lesse woulde they spende them liberally amongest others: which is a very greate discommoditie. Wisedome, I say is not like such niggardes: but as she hath aboundance of victual, so she is not grieued, though al eate therof: she spareth not the meates and drinkes that are in her house, but for to giue meate and drinke, she killeth her victual, & draweth her wine, and filleth the glasses and cuppes to giue vnto al that desire to tast therof: they that resort to the house of wisdom do finde the table throughly furnished. The gluttons and dronkardes, the swil bowles & slugge bellies, haue no part at this table, neither can delite therin: for there is nothing that liketh thē, seing they aske nothing but that which pleaseth the flesh: & so at this table al things ther∣on are spirirual. For as wisdom with her house is spiritual, euē so she hath nothing, nor doth nothing, but is altogither spiritual. The bel∣ly and the teeth serue nothing theretoo, it is our heartes, soules, & our mindes, that we must giue and apply theretoo. Solomon willing to describe the felicitie of the kingdome of GOD, and the de∣lightes Mat. 2. 4. and pleasures thereof, doeth speake vnto vs figuratiuely.
The victuall killed, then the drawing of the wine, and the table prepared, is nothing but the preaching of the woorde, and the ad∣ministration of the Sacramentes, that is to say, of baptisme, and of the supper, which are the meates and drinkes to preserue vs from hunger and thirst. For man liueth not onely by bread, but by e∣uery Deut. 8. 3. woorde that proceedeth out of the mouth of GOD. And forasmuch as it is so that there is nothing that we desire more than life, wee shoulde fixe al our ioye, al our delightes and pleasures in the victual, wine and table of wisedome: in this maner we shoulde haue no care ouer our bellies, but we would aspire vnto the king∣dome of God, wherein we shal haue ful possession of this table, whereof at this present wee doe taste, when wee sauour this woorde, and that for to haue more tast wee communicate at the Sacramentes. The which thinges are truly compared vnto the killing of victuall, &c. For as the housholde folkes of a place doe not eate quicke fleshe, and doe not drinke the wyne with the Hoggeshead, neither sit downe at the table, except it bee couered: euen so the housholde people of Wisedome doe not take tast at this woorde and Sacramentes, except they bee communicated and broken vnto them particularly, as wee doe feede our bodies: for also it behooueth that they growe and increase by litle and litle, as therefore from day to day this meate and drinke are bestowed vp∣on them. And albeeit that it is by the ministerie of men, yet are they nothing, neither ought wee to attribute any thing vnto them, but al vnto wisedome, as Solomon doeth wel signifie it, saying, that she hath killed, filled and made readie her table. If then by the seruice of men wee are fedde with the woorde, and commu∣nicat at the Sacramentes, al the praise thereof is due only vnto the Sonne of God, who is the true diuine wisedome: and yet wee may not despyse men, that hee sendeth vnto vs, except that wee wil de∣spyse him himselfe, and chiefly when they apply themselues faith∣fully to doe that which is enioyned them. And albeeit Solomon compareth heere the delightes of the woorde and the Sacramentes vnto victual & wine, & that there is an infinite distance betweene the one and the other (for the victual and the wine doe but serue the bodie for a litle time, but the woorde and the Sacra∣mentes
receiued in fayth and obedience, doe quicken the soule e∣uerlastingly, and wil rayse the bodie vnto the resurrection of life,) yet the comparison agreeth very wel. For what operation as hath the victual and wyne towardes the body, such hath the power of the woorde and sacramentes towardes our soules for euer. If this were wel printed in our heartes we shoulde bee much more care∣ful to folowe the doctrine of our Lord then we be. I say vnto you, bee not careful for your life, what yee shal eate, or what yee shal drinke: nor yet for your bodie what yee shal put Mat. 6. 25, on? But the cleane contrarie is put in practice: and there∣fore wee may wel complaine of ourselues, or GOD of vs, They assemble themselues for corne, and wine, and they rebel a∣gainst Hoseas. 7. 14. mee. 3 She hath sent foorth her maydens, &c. Wisedome is not contented to haue killed, &c. She wil haue vs know what prepa∣ration shee hath made, for shee wil not eate her banket alone, but desireth companie. Solomon doeth signifie it, when hee saieth, Shee sendeth foorth her maydens, that is to say, her damsells and seruantes, that by them shee may cal a multitude of people. Shee hath not sent them to the caues and dennes vnder the earth, nor into the wildernesse where no man dwelleth but wild beastes: but to the end that they may be both heard and seene, and that al might know that the banket is prepared, she hath sent them forth to cry vpō the hyest places of the citie, &c. These maidens, damsels, or seruāts, are the Patriarkes, Prophetes Apostles & Pastors of the church, which as the maydens, & seruants of a Lady of honor and Princes, do stande before her to heare her commandementes, and are readie to execute them, and to serue and obey her in al things: euen so also they yeelde and become attentiue vnto the woorde of God, which is the worde of wisedome, for to obey and execute that which is committed vnto them, & wherwith they are charged, &c. Amongst other thinges, their duetie and office is to cal the bidden Mat. 22. 3. Gen. 6. 14. Heb. 11. 7. 2. Pet. 2. 5. Gen. 17. 23. 24. &. 18. 19. guestes vnto the mariage of the kings Sonne. Noe was one of thē, that did it, when he made the arke wherby he condēned the world, and was the herault and messenger of righteousnes. Abraham did it, when dwelling in the Lande of Canaan amongst ydolaters and in∣fidells, he made profession of seruing and woorshipping one onely
God, and that folowing the commandement of God, hee circumci∣sed himselfe, and al them of his houshold. When also he did accor∣ding as God giueth witnes of him: for I knowe him hee wil com∣mande his sonnes and his housholde after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord Moses did the same in Egipt and in the wildernes, &c. The other Prophetes haue done the lyke, when rysing vp early, they haue cried and laboured by the worde of God, to bring men to repentance and faith. The Apostles also haue done the same, when, by folowing the ordinance of Christ, That which I tel you in darke∣nes, that speake ye in light. They went through al the worlde and Math. 10. 27. preached, &c. This calling and continual bidding, when the mini∣sters of the worde do daily admonish vs, teach, correct, threaten & comfort in the name of our Lorde, and that they cease not to doe their office, though they haue greate resistance and many gainsay∣ers. Thus dooing, they are vppon the high towers of the ci∣tie, and do cal vnto wisedome his banket. They then, which refuse the preaching, and do persecute the seruantes of God, do not know what it is truly to banket, neither know what are the true delites & pleasures. They care for their belly which perisheth, & forsake and forget their soules, and doe destroy them, when they do forsake the true pasture which quickeneth euerlastingly, &c. But when it is saide, that wisedome hath sent her daughters, there is giuen vs to vnderstand that none ought to intrude himselfe to beare the word, Rom. 20. 15 except he be sent. Secondly, that if wee bee sent, it is a certaine thing that wee are of the number of the daughters, maidens, and seruantes of wisedome. Thirdly, if wee bee sent, wee doe bid men vnto this table, and cannot holde our peace: contrarily, if wee thrust in ourselues, or that we are sent by men, wee cal not, but turne aside from this mariage (as our Lorde doeth reproche the Mat. 23. 13. Scribes and Pharisees,) or else wee holde our peace, with the Ni∣codemites, which in tyme of persecution are dombe: and in this sort we doe not ascend vp into the highest places of the citie, but do seeke the holes and dennes. Then can it not be saide of vs, Howe beautiful vpon the mountaines are the feete of him, that declareth Esay. 52. 7. and publisheth peace? &c. Thus doing, wee are ashamed of Christ and of his woorde, and therefore hee will bee ashamed of vs Luke. 9. 26. also.
4 Who so is simple, &c. It is not the custome to goe vnto the mariage, but when wee are called: If a man enter without calling, hee is in danger to bee thrust out againe with shame. Therefore they which haue any honestie or shame, wil not presume to enter in, except they knowe to bee bidden guestes. Nowe to the end that wee may knowe whether wee bee of the number of the bidden guestes to wisedomes table, Solomon doth shewe vs what kind of people shee desireth and commandeth to bee called. Hee saieth, shee desireth that the simple men shoulde come vnto her, and sit at her table, and by and by after shee expoundeth what these simple ones are, that is to say, they that are without wit. Wherein wee see there is none of vs that ought to doubt whether he be called or no vnto the table of wisedome, seeing that of our nature wee are al simple and voide of wit. Insomuch as wee loue vanitie, foolishnes and lying better, then constancie, wisedome and truthe: wee rather giue ourselues vnto wickednes, vnto lewdnesse and vntemperancy, then vnto goodnes, modestie and sobrietie: we are more ready vnto debates and strifes, then vnto peace and charitie: wee rather folowe superstition and idolatry, then true religion and holines. If then wee consider wel what we are, we shal know that we are of the number of those to whome wisedome saith, come, eate, &c. But she doeth not make vs to bee called vnto her house and to her table after the manner of princes of the worlde, which are giuen vnto vanitie, and careth not but to passe the time in foolishnes: and therefore the foolishe desire but to delight themselues with their follie, and to become more foolishe if it bee possible. But wisedom hath com∣passion on our vanitie and folly: and therefore maketh vs to bee called vnto her table, that thereat we may heare good talke, & that therby we might learne to becom wise & prudēt. This is the bread & the wine which are dealt at wisdoms table. Here is no mention of any sumptuous banket, but onely of bread and wyne, that wee might learne not to seeke by outwarde apparance, if wee will become wise, but lowe things vile and abiect before the world, and make ourselues contemptible vnto it. For if wee bee called of God vnto this table, we must consider that which is saide, You see your calling, how that not many wise mē after the flesh, &c. Wisdō 1. Cor. 1. 26. also doth not cal vs vnto her house & to her table after the manner
of the worldly wise, which woulde haue this reputation, that they cannot in any wise suffer the simple and fooles, and therefore desire to bee accompanied with their like, amongst the which notwith∣standing they desire to haue the preferrement and chiefe place. Wisedome doeth not refuse the simple, and such as are destitute of wit, but doeth cal them vnto her, not for to mainteine them in their simplicite and ignorance, for that were to leade them vnto death, and to make them perishe miserably: but she calleth them for to deliuer them from it: for sith that she commandeth vs to re∣sorte vnto her, and there is no follie nor ignorance in her, neither doe they please her, it foloweth wel that if wee resorte vnto her, wee cannot remaine in this follie and ignorance, and consequently wee are deliuered from death, as shee giueth wel to vnderstande it, when shee offreth bread and wyne, not which grewe in earthly fieldes and vineyardes: for the greatest parte of them which eate thereof, are simple and ignorant, and cease not to dye, but this bread and wyne are heauenly, al they which eate thereof, become wise: for wisedome opening vnto vs her riches, doeth communi∣cate herselfe vnto vs, seeing she cannot bee separated from her gifts and graces: and sith it is the tree of life: it foloweth, that whosoe∣uer resorteth vnto her, and eateth of her bread and drinketh of her Pro. 3. 18. wine, shal not dye, but shal liue for euer: It serueth also to make thē wise, when she calleth them to come vnto her, and to liue, by giuing them bread and wine. Now to attaine vnto this, she sheweth what wee must doe, when she saith, 6 Forsake your way, ye foolish, & ye shal liue: & walke in the way of vnderstanding. Forasmuch as wee must forsake the foolish, and not cōmunicate with their folly, neither cōsent to their wickednes for to liue in the house & at the table of wisedome, it foloweth that we must forsake ourselues, resisting strongly, & fighting against our nature, which is altogither foolish and wicked: & so, for to liue, wee must labour to put of the old man, to mortifie our fleshe, and not to take any plea∣sure or delight with the foolish, but to be careful to reproue them,
and to bee sory and grieued for their folly. And this if wee wil doe, wee must not liue in ignorance, as doe they which follow their sensualitie, and which proceede vppon a good intent and fantasie which they frame without the woorde of God. Such kinde of peo∣ple are not receiued into the house of wisedome to liue at her table. Solomon doeth wel signifie it, hauing promised life, in saying, and liue: hee addeth, And walke, &c. By this woorde hee teacheth vs that we shal forsake the companie of fooles with their foolish∣nes, if we be instructed in the pure woorde of God, and that the same only bee our guide, without declyning from it either on the right hand or left, without either adding too or diminishing from. After this manner wee shalbee receiued for to liue in the house of wisedome, and at her table: And not only wee shalbee the stones of Ephe. 2. 19. the buylding, but also of the housholde. 7 Hee that reprooueth a scorner, purchaseth to himselfe shame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himselfe a blotte. 8 Rebuke not a scorner, lest he hate thee, but rebuke a wise man, and he wil loue thee. Howbeeit that if wee wil forsake the foolish and their follies, as wee ought, wee must bee diligent to reprooue and correct them (as wee haue seene that Noe, Lot, Moyses, the Prophetes and A∣postles haue done) so also our Lorde hath reprooued them, as wee may see in the Euangelical historie, and hath commanded to re∣prooue them. And Saint Paule saieth, doe not communicate with Mat. 18. 15 Ephe. 5. 10. 1. Timo. 5. 20 the vnfruiteful workes of darkenesse, but euen reprooue them ra∣ther, Them that sinne rebuke openly, that the rest also may feare: notwithstanding there are such so frowarde, and so much past correction that we can winne nothing by reproouing and cor∣recting them, but al dishonestie, and oftentimes wee are esteemed like vnto them: for they which are of sinister iudgement, and ledde by euill affection, will condemne the ministers, iudging them to bee such as those with whome they are mingled and can∣not attaine to bring them to the right way. Solomon knewe it wel, and therefore hee saith as by a complaint, hee that reproo∣ueth
a scorner, &c. Not that it is euil of it selfe, nor that it is vn∣cleane, but the scorner, so much as hee can, maketh him that reproo∣ueth and correcteth him ashamed, doeth slander and dishonor him, and woorketh that the correctour shalbee no better esteemed a∣mongst others then he: and thus not only wee loose our tyme in correcting the scorner, but also we get blame and disworship: and this is the cause why Solomon saith, 8 Rebuke not a scorner, &c. The first parte of this sen∣tence agreeth with that which is said, Giue not that which is holy, Mat. 7. 6. to dogges, &c. The scorners, are dogges and swine, to whome wee must not giue holy things, nor perles. For as they are prophane, gi∣uen vp vnto al filthinesse, rooted in al euil, and hardned against al admonition and aduertisement, euen so are they vnwoorthy of spi∣ritual thinges, ordeined for the elect and faithful. The holy and pre∣cious thinges, which God hath ordeined vnto a pure vsage (as the doctrine of saluation, the admonitions, aduertisements, corrections made by the worde and in the name of the Lorde) shoulde be defi∣led and profaned, if we did giue them ouer vnto such wicked per∣sons. But some wil aske, whether the doctrine of saluation, vnder the which are conteined the rebukes, is not indifferently appoin∣ted Mat. 13. 47. Mark. 16. 15 2. Cor. 2. 15. aswel for the good, as for the euil, seeing that the kingdome of heauen is compared vnto a net cast into the sea, and gathereth to∣gither of al manner of fishes, and the Gospel is commanded to bee preached vnto al creatures: and Paule saieth, Wee are a sweete sa∣uour of Christ vnto God, in them which are saued, and in them that perish, &c. For to answere, wee must note that we cannot dis∣cerne the dogges from the children of GOD, vntil that they be tryed by certaine experiences, and plaine tokens: and also we ought not immediatly to descende vnto a graue iudgement, that by one experience wee shoulde iudge any man to bee an hogge, and a dogge, a scorner, and a desperate wicked one. But when by greate diligence wee shal haue tryed al remedies for to bring such people to goodnes, & shal see no amendment in them, but ra∣ther shal see them to waxe woorse, that then wee holde them for desperate: and when wee haue iudged them such, wee ought to declare vnto them the sharpe iudgement of GOD,
and not to set holie and precious things before them, no more then before dogges & hogges. Heretikes are of the number of such peo∣ple, as S. Paul doth shew, saying, Eschewe an Heretike, &c. If we wil Tit. 3. vse the doctrine purely & wel, without prophaning it, we must feed the faithful and willing to learne therwith, as the meate that is pro∣per vnto thē, and that ought not to be refused them, except that we would be vnfaithful seruants: yea wicked, & theeues: but the wic∣ked, scorners, & obstinate, ought to be feared with the horrible ven∣geance of God. Our Lord before vs hath done so: so hath S. Paul in Mat. 23. diuers places of his Epistles. If so doing the scorners doe hate vs, and that they doe despight and blaspheme against the doctrine, we doe not prophane the holie thinges, we giue not pearles vnto dogs, but by denouncing the iudgement, we pull them backe. In making suche declaration, we goe not against this admonition of Solomon, Rebuke not, &c. For it is not reprehension, but rather condemna∣tion, the which we may pronounce, as Solomon hath alreadie done in diuers places, and verie plainly in the first Chapter. When then wee shal haue certaine knowledge of the wicked and scorners, we should not spende the tyme about rebuking of them, but hauing feared them with the iudgement of God, wee should leaue them as desperate and vncorrigible, and imploy our time to exhort, to ad∣uertise, correct, and rebuke them by wholesome doctrine, which are apte to learne, and which wil yeelde themselues attentiue vnto the Worde, and haue their delectation and pleasure to obey it, and be∣leeue it. Those are they whome wee must reprooue, as Solomon doeth shewe vs, when he sayeth, Rebuke a wise man, &c. Solo∣mon doeth not heere say any thing, neither in the first nor seconde parte of this sentence, which Achab and Iesabel haue not prooued true, the which shewed themselues verie wicked and desperat scor∣ners, when not onely they woulde not heare the corrections of the Prophet Elias, but through anger and hatred did persecute him. Contrarily, Dauid shewed himselfe verie wise, when hee receiued 1. King. 19. & 21. 2. Sam. 12. the correction from the Prophete Nathan, wherein hee shewed that hee did loue the Prophet. Wee must labour to resemble him therin, & not Achab & Iezabel. But some wil aske whether it be lawful for vs to abstain from rebu∣king
of scorners, that wee may auoide their hatred, seeing that our Lord sayeth, Feare ye not them which can kil the bodie, but are not Mat. 10. 28. & 9. 10. & 10. 32. able to kil the soule: but rather feare him, which is able to destroy both soule and bodie in hell. Blessed are they which suffer persecuti∣on for righteousnes sake: &, ye shalbe hated of al men for my name sake. I answere, that Solomon doth not teach vs, (that by holding our peace at scorners, and not rebuking them,) wee shoulde labour to auoide their displeasure: but he doeth shewe vs that we profite nothing at al to reprooue them, but get their hatred: he doeth not shewe vs the ende wherevnto wee must tende, in abstaining from rebuking, but onely that which foloweth vppon our reprehension. Also albeit, that we must so much as in vs lieth, haue peace & friend∣ship Rom. 12. 18. with al men, yet when wee rebuke wise men, our ende ought not to bee to winne their loue: for in this sorte, wee shoulde seeke that which were ours, and not what belongeth vnto God, and our neighbours. But onely wee must vnderstande, that if hee whome we rebuke, is wise, that he wil take in good worth and part, our re∣prehension, he wil take it wel and thanke vs for it, and so wil shewe that he loueth vs. Herevpon wee may gather, that except wee wil∣lingly heare the corrections, we are destitute of wisdome, and voide of loue, and filled with hatred, and consequently, that wee haue no accesse vnto God, as Iesus Christ doeth teach vs it. Furthermore, we may gather, that though we be wise, yet it is not to say, but that we may commit thinges worthie of rebuke. Noe, Abraham, Iacob and others, are witnesses thereof. And also, as there is no man iust on earth, which doeth good and sinneth not: euen so, although we bee wise, yet is it not to say, that we doe not deserue to haue our imperfections, vanities and follies shewed vnto vs, that wee Mat. 5. 22. &. 6. 14. & 18. 35. Eccl. 7. 11. confessing ourselues suche as we are indeede, might learne to a∣mende and growe in wisedome: For as wee haue seene, the wise wil heare, and shal haue more learning. Euen so nowe Solomon doeth admonish vs: 9 Giue admonition to the wise, and he wil be the wiser: teach a righteous man, & he wil increase in learning.
If we had no vanitie nor follie, if we had no sinne nor malice we should be perfectly wise and righteous, and should not neede to re∣ceiue instruction, nor be taught: wee should be filled enough, and should haue abundance enough therof, without increasing or grow∣ing. But the sentence of Solomon agreeth verie wel with the same of our Lord, Vnto euery one that hath, shalbe giuen, and hee shal Mat. 25. 29. abounde, but he that hath not, from him shalbe taken that which he hath. When Solomon speaketh thus, hee sheweth that it is good reason that the wise man shoulde loue them, which instruct and re∣buke him, seeing, that by so doing, they are so farre of from doing him hurt, or taking any thing of his, that they rather labour to pro∣fite him, and to make him grow and increase. We doe the same to∣wardes the scorner, when wee reprooue him: but through foolish∣nesse, malice, and vnthankfulnesse, by pride, presumption, and stif∣neckednes, hee contemneth and refuseth his profite, and foloweth and seeketh his owne hurt. But although wee see many to bee of this miserable state, and that wee haue no proofe of their returning vnto goodnesse, yet must we doe that which is enioyned vs, Preach 2. Tim. 4. 2. Mat. 10. 16. the Worde: be instant, in season, and out of season. That wee must so doe, our Lorde doeth shewe vs, when hee sayeth, I sende you as sheepe amongst Wolues. We neuer hope that Wolues shoulde be∣come sheepe: and yet our Lorde woulde that his Apostles shoulde thrust themselues amongst the midst of them. But if we may haue a certificate that they are wholly frowarde, harde hearted, and not to be corrected, wee must leaue them, and not meddle to giue them a∣ny instruction, neither rebuke nor correct them, to bring them to a∣mendement, but to pronounce vnto them their iudgement & con∣demnation. Saint Paule doeth thus teach vs to behaue ourselues, saying, Alexander the Coppersmith hath wrought mee much euil: the Lorde reward him according to his workes. 2. Tim. 4. 14. 10 The beginning of wisedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderstanding. 11 For thy dayes shalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life shalbe augmented. Because that wisedome hath bidden vs vnto her table, and hath set before vs bread & wine, to the ende that wee may knowe whe∣ther
we be truely partakers, shee giueth vs a marke and token, say∣ing, The beginning of wisdome, &c. The token and signe thē which shal certifie vs whether we be refreshed at the table of wisedome, is the feare of the Lorde, and the knowledge of holie thinges. Here So∣lomon hath set the effect before the cause: for from the knowledge of the worde of God, (which are holie things, proceedeth the feare of the Lorde, if wee feare him and tremble at his commandements, desiring to serue him thereafter, and to giue him true obedience: if we beleeue in him, assuring ourselues of his promises: if we cal vp∣on him in al our necessities, and doe giue him heartie thanks for al thinges: if wee be careful for his honour and glorie, the same com∣meth from the knowledge of holie thinges, from the vnderstanding of the holie and pure worde of God, without the which wee con∣temne al the foresaide thinges, and doe runne into vanities and fol∣lies, into superstitions and idolatries, into maliciousnes, and wicked∣nes. But Solomon esteemed not to keepe or folowe the order, nei∣ther was it necessarie, because that this feare and knowledge, are Pro. 2. 5. thinges so knit together, that the one can not stande without the other: & therfore also he hath gathered them together. And S. Iohn 1. Ioh. 2. 3. also doth gather them together, saying, And hereby we are sure that we know him, if we keepe his commandements. And whē we haue no knowledge of holy things of ourselues, but onely so muche as it Psal. 119. 18 pleaseth God to reueale vnto vs, as it is written, Open mine eyes, that I may behold the wonderful things of thy law: Make me to vn∣derstande the way of thy preceptes, & I wil meditate in thy wonde∣rous works. Blessed art thou, Simon, the sonne of Ionas: for flesh & blood hath not reuealed it vnto thee, but my Father which is in he∣uen. Mat. 16. 17. Luk. 24. 45. Then opened he their vnderstāding, that they might vnderstād the Scriptures: It foloweth wel, that it commeth not of our free wil, that we haue the feare of the Lord, the which is required of the ser∣uants of the Lord aboue al thinges. And now Israel, what doeth the Lorde thy God require of thee, but to feare the Lorde thy God, to Deut. 10. 12. walke in al his wayes, & to loue him, & to serue the Lorde thy God with al thine heart, & with al thy soule? As we may then learne here, the feare of the Lord comprehendeth vnder it al the seruice and ho∣nour that we owe vnto God, wherin lieth al our wisdom & know∣ledge. Therfore whē Solomō saith, the beginning &c. He meaneth Deut. 4. 6. not, that for to be wise wee haue neede of any other thing then the
feare of the Lord: but he would that we should know, that wee are altogether void of wisdom, except we haue the feare of the Lord: so that we can not begin to be wise, vnlesse we feare the Lorde: not as the infidels & faithlesse doe, which haue no vnderstanding: for they haue no knowledge frō whēce only proceedeth the true feare. Such people, I say, haue not the feare of the Lord, but of torments. They feare him without knowing him to be pitiful & merciful: and ther∣fore they are afraide of the sharpnes of his iudgement, as a pore of∣fender is afraide & trembleth in the presence of the Iudge, of whom he looketh but for al rigour. Besides this, we must note, that the ta∣ble of wisdom is not prepared with prophane & vnclean things, but with holy things, the tast wherof, standeth in vnderstanding. They then which delight themselues in vanities & folishnes, in malice & wickednes, in filthines & pollution, haue no felowship at the table of wisdom: & it is good reason, for they are like vnto the horse and Psal. 32. 9. Mule in which there is no vnderstanding, the which only giueth tast in the heauenly things, wherof cōmeth a good humour of the feare of the Lord, the which quickeneth the soules of wisdoms children. 11 For thy daies, &c. To the ende that we shoulde not refuse to come vnto the table of wisdom, & to eate of her bread, & drinke of her wine, Wisdom doth shew vs that they which eate & drinke at her table, shalbe of no smal cōtinuance. As if he said, there is no man but desireth to liue long, & flye death. Wherefore come, eate of my bread, and drink of my wine, & ye shal obtaine your desires. By me shal thy dayes be multiplied, &c. We haue the same in the 3. Chap∣ter, & 2. verse: and 4. Chapter & 22. verse, We can take no poyson at wisdoms table, vnles we abuse that which she giueth vs. The meates & drinkes that she giueth, are not corruptible, & they breed no euil humors nor superfluities, as do corporal meates, whereof if we take too much, they hurt both the bodie & the mind: for they make the body heauy, & dul the spirits, & are cause that finally we go to per∣dition. Cōtrarily, we can not exceed in eating & drinking at the ta∣ble of Wisdō, we need not feare to take too much: for the more we eate and drinke thereat, by so much the more are we better disposed to liue long. And therefore the bridegrome, which is the wisdome of God, feareth not to say vnto his Church, Fellowes, eate and Cant. 5. 1. Ephe. 5. 18▪ drinke: Friendes, fill yourselues full. And this is that which
Saint Paule woulde: and be not dronke with wine, wherein is ex∣cesse: but be filled with the Spirite. And as there is no danger to fil ourselues at the table of wisdome, but is verie healthful: euen so the table is alwayes couered, whervnto continually are al kindes of people called and bidden, and so many as come, are refreshed. The preaching of the Worde, and the administration of the Sacraments doe plainly enough shewe the same. 12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thy self, and if thou be a scorner, thou alone shalt suffer. Forasmuch as it is so, that by wisedome the dayes of such as eate at her table shalbe multiplied, which turneth to the great profite of those which are there refreshed, she cōcludeth most fitly, If thou be wise, &c. Wisedome is not like vnto Inholders, which cal in their guestes and euil intreat them, and make them pay wel. That which she doeth, commeth from her pure liberalitie, and her high magnifi∣cence: she intreateth her guestes verie honestly, and with great gen∣tlenes. O God, how excellent is thy mercy? O God, &c. It is not Psal. 36. 7. 8. without cause that refreshing is attributed vnto the goodnesse of God: For how much soeuer he giueth, he asketh no payment ther∣fore. Hoe, euery one that thirsteth, come yee to the waters, and yee that haue no siluer, come, bye and eate, &c. Then when wisedome Esai. 55. 1. doeth cal vs vnto her table, shee regardeth our profit: but it ought not so to be counted ours, that we should be sorie, if others be par∣takers thereof: for albeit that it is saide, Thou shalt be wise for thy selfe: yet it is not to say, that it is not lawful for vs to vse wisdome, as the couetous doe vse their riches they haue, keeping the same to themselues, and haue no minde to impart them vnto their neigh∣bors, for feare to diminishe them. For this that wisdom doth giue vs at her table, is aswel for the pore which haue need, as for ourselues. But to be wise for a man his self, is to vse the gifts & benefits of wis∣dome as it behooueth, & not to teceiue them in vaine. And also we are taught that we loose not our time, when we giue ourselues vnto wisdom: for we are neuer destitute of good vnderstanding, whereby we take heede of the miseries, & chiefly from the spiritual. This is to bee wise for himselfe. Contrarily, when a man is bare of all
goods, & is in great necessitie, if he refuse the benefite that is offe∣red him, deriding them which woulde helpe him, hee is worthie to perish miserably, and to suffer that none other feele his griefe and e∣uill. Again they that are stiffenecked & vncorrigible, voide of wise∣dome the which is very necessary for them, & do scorn them which bidde them vnto wisedome, euen to the hating of them, and perse∣cuting of them so much as in them lyeth, shall themselues suffer the euill whereof they are worthie, and not the commenners and house∣holde people of wisedome. Solomon doth wel signifie the same, whē he saith, And if thou bee a scorner, &c. This sentence agreeth with the same in Ezechiell. The same soule that sinneth shal die. A∣gaine, Eze. 18. 20. 2. Cor. 5. 10. We must al appeare before the iudgement seate of Christ. Of these sentences wee must gather that it is an abuse to thinke that there is any Purgatory for to cleanse the soules after this life. As the wise shall be wise for himselfe, and shal haue thereby eternall pro∣fite: euen so the scorner shal suffer continually. For as there is no place after this life for repentance, euen so there is no obteining of forgiuenesse of sinnes. Esay doth wel shewe it when he pricketh vs, saying, Seeke the Lorde while he may be founde, cal vpon him Esay. 55. 6. 2. Cor. 6. 2. while he is nigh. And Saint Paule saith: Behold now the accepted time, Behold now the day of saluation. Bee not deceiued: GOD is not mocked: for whatsoeuer a man soweth, that shal hee also a Gal. 6. 7. reape. 13 A foolish woman is troublesome: she is ignorant, and knoweth nothing. 14 But she sitteth at the dore of her house, on a seate in the high places of the citie: 15 To cal them that passe by the way, that go right on their way, saying: 16 Who so is simple, let him come hither: and to him that is destitute of wisedome, she saith also, 17 Stollen waters are sweete, and hid bread is pleasant. 18 But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her guestes are in the depth of hel. Vnder the name of a foolish woman and ignorant, Solomon de∣scribeth
the folly, aswel of them which mainteine others in foolish∣nesse, as they that commit foolishnesse themselues. He attributeth troublesomnesse and ignorance vnto them, as if he saide, Where the fooles and doltes ought to holde their peace, and to giue eare vnto the wise for to learne of thē, bicause they are ignorāt, they are so presumptuous, that they labor to set forth & shew themselues, in criyng & making noyce, partly, bicause the wise shold not be heard, & that they seeme to be ouercome, partly to astonish the simple & vndiscrete, that they may holde them in their foolishnes and igno∣rance. Suche is the subtiltie of Satan, the maister and guider of such people, which doth puffe them vp with pride in such wise that they waxe bolde to shewe themselues, where they ought in no wise to appeare: they stand vp to speake, where they ought to hold their peace: they stirre vp strife, where ought to bee at quiet, and and to learne with silence. And albeit, as is saide, that they are ig∣norant, and that they deserue to bee contemned, yet will they bee the most apparant and most set by. Solomon doeth signifie it, when he saith, 14 But shee sitteth at the dore, &c. This desire to be seene, and to be honoured, is declared vnto vs by the Lorde, speaking of Mat. 23. 5 the Pharisees, which doe all their workes to bee seene of men, &c. They that followe them, as doe the Monkes and Priests with al the schoole doctours, doe sit at the gates of their house, the which they haue placed vpon the high places of the citie: for there is no people in al the world that desireth more to be seene, and more to be estee∣med & praised then they. Now the cause that moueth thē to desire to be so seene, is to draw a great number of people after thē: for the world desireth the things which are glorious, and is drawne by that which greatly appeareth, rather thā by that which is true. That they tend therevnto, Solomon doth signifie it, when he saith that it is, 15 To call, &c. Wee are al passengers and pilgrims in this worlde which seeke another place: at the leastwise we ought to be, Heb. 13. 14. Col. 12. 20 and to walke right in our pathes by innocencie and righteousnesse, with contempt of earthly things, which haue a faire shew. Therfore when these holy men, so deuout & religious, desire vs to heare thē, they labour to stay vs on earth, and make vs fixe our desires and affections therevpon: they study to drawe vs out of the right way.
They desire not to haue their audience and hearers wise, & men of vnderstanding, but fooles and vndiscrete, the which cannot perceiue that their wisdome is foolishnesse before God: for they call: 17 Who so is simple, &c. When Solomon speaketh thus, he neither expresseth the thoughts, nor the sayinges of these foolishe maisters: for thinking themselues wise, and desiring to be so coun∣ted, they desire to be hearde of wise men for to make them more wiser: but he expresseth what they doe,, and what thir auditorie is: that is, that by their wordes and manners, they allure vnto folly and ignorance, and make those which giue eare vnto them, beastes, yea, wicked and malicious: for we learne nothing of them, but to giue ourselues vnto wickednesse and malice, and to take our pleasures & lustes. The which Solomon doth signifie by the stollen waters, and hidden bread: for as the wholsome doctrine of the law and the Go∣spel, which is plainely called water and bread, recreateth and refre∣sheth the mindes of the faithfull, and worketh goodnesse in them, and maketh them wholy to delight therein: & being thus disposed, are boulde to present themselues before, and desire not to go backe from the presence of God, neither feare to appeare before him: euen so the doctrines and traditions of men which are not simply called water and bread: but stolne waters, and bread that is secretely takē, do delight the carnal and infidels, and doe not teach them the pure trueth, and true righteousnesse and innocencie, but al kinde of fol∣lies and dreames, doe make them to be giuen vnto diuerse wicked∣nesses, and doe alwaies hold them in doubt, and being thus disposed dare not approch vnto God, but so much as in them lieth, do run & hide themselues from him as theeues. And this is the cause why the doctrines and traditions of men, and that which followeth of them are called stolne waters, and bread secretely taken. 18 But he knoweth not, &c. Whosoeuer drinketh of the wa∣ters of folly, & eateth of her bread, is greatly deceiued when he de∣lighteth therein. Solomon doth wel signifie it, when he saith, But he knoweth not, &c. It is a great deceit for a man to take delight in his destruction and perdition, and not to know it: and not onely an a∣buse, but also most perilous daunger, wherein there is no remedy, no more then if a blinde man not regarding a good guide, ceasseth not to runne hither and thither, vntill hee bee fallen
downe into a bottomlesse pit. Heere wee see that ignorance is very dangerous, and that it excuseth not the ignorant. True it is that if Mat. 15. 14 the ignorant will returne vnto goodnesse by true repentance, their ignorances nor yet wickednesses shall not bee imputed vnto them. Our Lorde doeth shew it, when he prayeth for his murde∣rers: Luke. 23. 24 1. Tim. 1. 12. 13. and Saint Paule saying, Therefore I thanke him, which hath made me strong, that is, Iesus Christe our Lord: for he counted me faithful, and put me in his seruice: When before I was a blasphemer and a persecuter, and an oppressor: but I was receiued to mercy: for I did it ignorantly through vnbeliefe. ¶ The ende of the nienth Chapter, and the Pre∣face to the Prouerbes. ☞ THE PROVERBES OF SO∣LOMON. The tenth Chapter. 1 A wise sonne maketh a glad father: but a foolish sonne is an heauinesse to his mother. WE haue said at the beginning of this booke, that Solomon in the niene first Chapters did make a Preface & preamble vpon these notable sentē∣ces that he would publish. That this is true, partly is seen by this, that the former wordes doe followe now & then betweene, and may be ioyned togeather, as we haue already she∣wed: partly also by this, that now in the beginning of this tenth Chapter, he giueth the title, saying, The Prouerbes of Solomon: as though he began a newe booke. And these sayings, as may be seene, are halfe and parted sentences, for the
ioyning whereof we need not to take any great paines. But we must vnderstande that these sayinges are groundes and rules spoken ac∣cording to the worde of the Lorde: whereby he instructeth the man∣ners, and correcteth the errour, and the faultes of carnal wisedome. And almost there is no verse heereafter, but hath his rule and sen∣tence, and for the most part diuided in twaine: for euen in one verse you shall finde the praise of vertue, and the blame of the contrarie vice. The first sentence praiseth the wise childe, and blameth the foo∣lish. It sayth nothing which is not aproued true of all thē that haue any iudgement at all: And also that which is heere pronounced, is commonly prooued of euery one, according as he is counted ey∣ther wise or foolishe. The one sort haue a true experience, and the other false and vaine, after as the one hath knowledge of wise∣dome: and the other (which are the greatest number) after as they beleeue lyes, and are giuen to vanitie. The supersticious and idola∣ters, the carnall wise worldlinges are glad when their children are like vnto them, and count them very wise: but as this wisdome is reproued of God (who wil destroy it) as hath been saide: (I wil de∣stroy Esay. 29. 14. 1. Cor. 1. 19. &. 2. 6. the wisedome of the wise, &c. For the wisedome of this worlde, and of the princes therof, shal perish:) so also their ioy shall not be of any continuance, for it is worldly and carnall, and therfore it shall vanish away quickly. Solomon speaketh not heere of this wisedome and gladnesse, but of that which is after God, the which continewe for euer, seeing that the giftes and callinges of God are without repentance. It is a gift and calling of GOD, when the Rom. 11. 24. childe, be it sonne or daughter, is wise, and that the father reioyceth therein, and that truely, and thus it is not a thing which quickly va∣nisheth away. But to the ende that wee might knowe which are the children that do truely make glad their fathers, we must vnder∣stande, what true wisedome is, and wherein it standeth. Moses Deut. 4. 5 doeth shewe it, Beholde I haue taught you Ordinances and Lawes, euen as the Lorde God hath commanded me: yee shall doe them therefore, and keepe them, for this is your wisedome. And foras∣much as there is no father being of sound iudgement, but reioyceth at the wisedome of his children. Therefore it followeth, first of al that the fathers and mothers, and al superious and gouerners ought to ber careful to see their children and subiectes to bee instructed in
the worde, and not to be delighted with their follies, wickednesse, and dissolutenesse as are many: but it oftentimes happeneth, that the ioy of the fathers and mothers, is turned into weeping & mour∣ning, when theyr children being euil brought vp, doe diuersly worke them iniurie and wrong both by worde and deede, or when they see them miserablie perishe. And in this manner is somewhat fulfilled that the foolish childe is sorowe vnto his mother, & that iustly: for these wicked fathers & mothers, these negligent superiours, & care∣lesse gouernours, which doe not diligently take heede to gouerne their children, and them which are vnder their charge: but suffers, or seemes not to see when they commit follies, and runne astray, do wel deserue to haue much sorowe therefore. Secondly, it followeth that the children and vnderlings which desire to make their fathers and mothers glad, and their superiours & gouernours ioyful, ought to giue themselues to folow the worde of God, without declining therefrom, either to the right hande or to the left: that if in this sort their parentes and superiours doe not reioyce, yet, they ceasse not to be wise, and so much as in them lyeth doe make them glad. They ought aboue al thinges to bee giuen vnto the feare and reue∣rence of God, as hee requireth in the first table of the Lawe: and then to giue reuerence and honour vnto them, vnto whome it is due, and then afterwardes to be gentle towardes their neighbours. Heerin they shall shewe foorth true wisedome, whereat their pa∣rentes and superiours, and men of honestie wil reioyce and be glad: but the wicked wil persecute them, as those places where the Pope raigneth, doe proue it to be true: For they call euil, good; & good, euill. Such kinde of people, striuing against this present instruction, Esay. 5. 20 are greeued at the wise, and reioyce at fooles, whose parentes being led by the spirite of God, cannot reioyce, but are in continual so∣rowe and griefe. For as Solomon saith, A foolishe childe is an heauinesse to his mother: &c. And because that Solomon labou∣red to giue vs short sentences, hee expresseth not in plaine wordes what he woulde haue vs to vnderstande. Hee speaketh heere of children onely in the masculine gender: yet hee meaneth aswell to instruct the daughters as the sonnes, the women aswellas the men, according to the common manner of the Scripture. Also he
expresseth not in the first part of this sentence but the father, and in the 2. but the mother. For if we be people of a sounde iudgement, wee haue all one affection towardes our children, so that it is suche towards our daughters, as towards our sonnes. And it is not with∣out cause that we haue said that fathers and mothers, and al superi∣ours and gouernors ought to be carefull. For first of all they are or∣deined of GOD to bee as schoole maisters, and to keepe them in discipline that are committed vnto their charge. Secondly, children doe passe little for wisedome, neither make any count to at∣taine the same, except they bee thrust forwarde by some of their friendes: and the common people are easie to runne astray, except the Magistrate be very carefull to keepe them in straight, &c. Euen so the wisedome of children and inferiours, standeth in obedience and sufferance to be ruled after the worde of God, and not in go∣uerning others. For the Lorde wil haue the weake to bee subiect, and to be taught obedience by the worde. As Dauid sayeth, Wher∣in shal a young man redresse his way? in taking heede according Psal. 119. 9. to thy worde. If children and inferiours doe thus wisely gouerne themselues, they neede not to feare any aduersitie: for the Lorde wil keepe and defende them, and make them blessed. The which Solomon doth wel signifie by the ioy of the father. For there is no∣thing that more reioyceth the father, then to see and knowe that his children doe prosper. And so wee may vnderstande that in the fathers ioye, there is promise of health enclosed: and contrarily, that in heauinesse of the mother, there is threatning of death and dam∣nation. Besides this, let vs note that this which is saide of parents & carnal children, may likewise bee stretched vnto the ministers, and to their charge. 2 The treasures of wickednes profit nothing: but righte∣ousnes deliuereth from death. Although this sentence is general, yet considering the contentes of the former, it may bee saide that Solomon reprooueth those fa∣thers, which care not whither their children bee wise or no: but
are contented onely that they haue wherewith to susteine their bo∣dies: and to come thereby, they gather goodes togeather both by right and wrong, and reach their children to doe the same. This is that which Solomon saith, the treasures of wickednesse: and saith, Mat. 6. 19. Iam. 5. 10. Eccle. 6. 2 &. 5. 12. 13. that such treasures shall not profite. For first they are corrupti∣ble, and subiect to be lost. Secondly, they that owe them, most commonly, dare not bestowe them in well doing least they shoulde diminish them, which is a great misery. Thirdly, most commonly strangers do possesse them, & not their children. It is an euil disease, that the riches which are kept, turne to the hurt of their owners. Fourthly, when he hath gotten much, he cannot long enioy them: for a man passeth away as a shadow, he heapeth vp goods, & know∣eth not who shal gather them. O foole, this night wil they fetche a∣way thy soule from thee: then whose shal those thinges bee, which thou hast prouided? Fifthly after this life they goe to damnation Psalm. 39. 7 Luke. 12. 20 as wee may see by the riche glutton in the 16. of Luke. It is therfore true that the treasures of wickednes shal not prosper, as saieth So∣lomon. Wherein he iustly condemneth couetousnes. Hee condem∣neth not riches, for they are the good creatures of God giuen for the vse of the faithful, and are instrumentes whereby charitie is ex∣ercised: and are ordeined of God, to the ende that wee shoulde bee enriched, not in hiding them and locking thē vp, but that we should abounde in good woorkes. After that he hath rebuked & condem∣ned the couetous with their couetousnes, he praiseth and commen∣deth hospitalitie and liberalitie, when he saith, but righteousnes de∣liuereth from death. Here he setteth righteousnes against the trea∣sures of wickednes, wherein hee sheweth that they which bee not dealers of almose and liberal towardes their needy neighbours, are vnrighteous, and deserue wel to bee punished, euen with death, as Solomon doeth wel declare, when hee setteth the deliuerance from death against not profiting. This is asmuch as if hee saide, so much it wanteth that the couetous doe receiue any profite of that which they heape togither by the hinderance of their neigh∣bours, that they shal dye eternally: but they that shal vse liberalitie and beneuolence taking heede from doing of wrong to their neigh∣bours, and giuing to euery man his owne, shalbee deliuered from death, and so shal liue foreuer. Heere Solomon taketh iustice for
hospitalitie, and liberalitie, for almes, and good deedes, for the workes of charitie and loue, as the Scripture taketh it in other pla∣ces. But it may here seeme that Solomon doth attribute power vn∣to our workes to saue vs, and so wee shoulde not obteine eternall life through grace, but by our merites. I answere, that of ourselues wee are altogether voide of righteousnesse: and if wee doe any workes, it is because that God fauoureth vs, and worketh the same in vs by his holy spirite: and then he alloweth our workes of his onely goodnesse, and not of their owne worthinesse: and because they are pleasant vnto him, he promiseth to reward them, and doth attribute vnto them that which belongeth vnto his onely grace & mercy. And this is because he doeth freely loue vs, buriyng all our faultes, for neuer more to remember them. And so albeit wee can deserue nothing by our works, yet are they not in vaine: for if they be done according to the word of God in vprightnesse of consci∣ence, they are witnesses that he loueth vs, and doe assure vs that we shall not perishe, but do fully certifie vs of eternal felicitie. Be∣sides this, let vs note that they which haue the goodes of this world, and care not to do good vnto others, do possesse the trea∣sures of iniquitie: though they labour not to drawe vnto them∣selues the riches of others, and that that they possesse be well gotten, or be attained by gift, or by succession of kindred. 3 The Lorde will not famishe the soule of the righteous: but hee casteth away the substacnce of the wic∣ked. Wee may see the wicked prosper, and to abound in wealth, they haue their ease and pleasures, they spende their time ioyfully, and haue rest and quietnesse: and in the meane while the faithfull which studie to follow righteousnesse, are poore, and suffer muche sorrowe. This is common and ordinary through all the world: wherevpon it commeth that the children of God do enuie and are greeued and greatly tempted to forsake all righteousnesse and inno∣cencie, and to followe all wickednesse, that they may be partakers of the ease with the wicked, and to prosper for a time as they doe. They which flatter not themselues in their infirmities and imper∣fections,
and that truely knowe what they are: doe know and feele howe they are tossed with suche temptations. Dauid in his Psalmes doeth declare to haue felt it, as he confesseth. Hee admonisheth vs not to vexe ourselues at the wicked, neither to enuie them that Psal. 73. 2 worke wickednesse. And by the discourse of the Psalme, hee sheweth vs that the goodly shew of the wicked is nothing but vani∣tie, and that the poore estate of the faithful is much more better, and more profitable then it seemeth, or is thought to bee. In follow∣ing this doctrine, Solomon would not haue fathers & mothers to feare, that their children (which they shall instruct in wisedome and righteousnesse) shoulde perishe and starue for hunger, though they gather no great treasures for them. Hee also instructeth vs all ge∣nerally, that wee should not put our trust in our goods, though we abounde in them: and that wee shoulde not bee discouraged whe∣ther we haue little or much, prouided that we delight to walke in a safe conscience, as God teach vs by his worde. For to bring vs vn∣to this, and to perswade vs it, hee saith, The Lord will not famish, &c. Our Lorde doeth giue vs the like doctrine in the sixth Chapter Mat. 6. 24. of Saint Matth: No man can serue two maisters, and so foorth to the ende of the Chapter. But they which haue forsaken the Gospel, and receiued the interim, they which dare not confesse Iesus Christ for feare of loosing their liues & goods, do not beleeue his promi∣ses made by Dauid, Solomon, and Iesus Christe, which haue spo∣ken by the spirite of GOD: and thus, so muche as they can, they make God a lyar, spoyle him of his trueth, and consequently of his diuinitie, seeing hee cannot be God without his trueth. Suche kinde of people and others which do trust in their riches, shal finde themselues deceiued, as they deserue. They thinke to bee safe from euil, and that their goodes shall not faile them: but Solomon saith, The Lorde casteth away the substance of the wicked, The Lorde doeth this in diuers sortes, as is dayly prooued, to wit, by warre, by lawe, by tempestes, coldes, and surfettinges: in these manners hee casteth away the substance of the wicked, when hee spoyleth them of them, or that hee take them from the middest of their goodes, when they thinke themselues to bee at rest, and that it seemeth vnto them that nothing can hurt them. Moreouer, first
of all let vs note that as (in the seconde verse) righteousnesse is ta∣ken for beneuolence: so also in this place by the righteousnesse is ment him that renounceth all couetousnesse, and doth dedicate him¦selfe to do good vnto his neighbours, according as God hath made him able, and feareth not that his goodes shoulde diminish, or hee Psal. 37. 16. &. 25. suffer want: hee saith with Dauid, A smal thing vnto the iust man is better than great riches to the wicked and mightie. Againe, I haue beene young, and am olde: yet I sawe neuer the righteous forsaken, nor his seede begging breade. Secondly, that if wee would be satisfied, we must fly the company of the wicked, & not to spare our goodes from the poore. Thirdly, that wee must not attribute any thing vnto fortune or chaunce, as doe the vnfaithfull and idola∣ters, which haue no true knowledge of God, neither of his proui∣dence: but as wee knowe that to him onely belongeth the conser∣uation and gouernment of all riches, euen so also doth wasting and destruction. It is he, that satisfieth and giueth power to the meates and drinkes to susteine vs: It is hee also which breaketh and ouer∣throweth all substance of bread and wine, taking from them the power of nourishing. And thus it is needefull for vs, that wee aske and craue of the Lorde, Giue vs this day our dayly bread. &c. Fourthly when Solomon doth promise vs that which we see, not with our corporall eyes, but doe prooue and feele the cleane contrary after the sense of the fleshe, hee teacheth vs, that wee haue neede of faith, whereby wee may bee armed against the slaunders of the crosse. For when wee see that the wicked prosper, and that the good bee afflicted, the fleshe is offen∣ded thereat, and iudgeth that GOD careth not for to helpe them. But the promises of GOD require faith, wherby wee beleeue that GOD doeth helpe and defende vs: albeit that for a little time he suffer vs to be exercised by diuerse kindes of af∣flictions: and doeth defende vs not onely in preseruing vs in this life, but also too giue vs possession of the life to come. For sith that his giftes and callinges are without repentaunce, it followeth Heb. 13. 11. that his promises doe reache further then this worlde, as the ho∣ly Patriarkes did wel vnderstand it. Again, those which he counteth
not worthie of this world, cannot but looke for perpetuall miserie and calamitie. Therfore when hee threatneth to cast away the sub∣stance of the wicked, let vs vnderstande that hee threatneth them with eternall destruction: for they cannot bee worthie of the blessed life, when they are vnworthy of earthly substance. Fift∣ly, that Solomon doeth not promise vntoo the righteous great bankets, and aboundance of riches and goodes, for to liue plenti∣fully in carnall delightes and pleasures, but onely that they shall not bee famished. For wee must eate, to slake hunger and to quench 1. Tim. 6. 8. Heb. 13. 5 thrist, and not to fill ourselues in gluttonie and drunkennesse: and also wee are taught to desire our dayly bread, and to content our¦selues hauing foode and clothing, &c. As doeth the Apostle al∣so admonishe vs, saying, Let your conuersation bee without co∣uetousnesse, and bee contente with those thinges which you haue: for hee hath sayde, I will not faile thee, neither forsake thee. 4 A slouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche. When they loue to bee at rest, and woulde not labour, doe heare say that the Lord wil not hungerstarue the soule of the righ∣teous: it seemeth vnto them that they neede not to laye their handes to worke, and will eate their bread in idlenesse, and with∣out labour, and doe not thinke that it is possible for them to be∣come poore, & to haue neede: but Solomō doth wel shew them the cōtrary, saying, A slouthful hand maketh poore: He speaketh here nothing darkly, nor which is not dayly prooued true by experience: but when hee speaketh thus, it is not to say, that wee must labour diligently, lest wee become poore, and with desire to be riche: for in the first, there shoulde bee distrust of the goodnesse and pro∣uidence of God: And in the second, Couetousnesse, which are two vices abhominable before God. For he woulde that as he declareth himself to be our father, & doth promise to nourish vs, euē so shold we assure ourselues of his goodnes towards vs, & that we shoulde loke with patience for al goodnes to come frō him, without feare of
wanting, casting al our cares vpon him. So doing, we shalbe the true seede of Abraham, which is the father of all beleeuers. The promise shall belong to vs, Feare not, Abrahā, I am thy buckler, & thine ex∣ceeding Rom. 4. 11. Gen. 15. 1 Psal. 55. 22. 1. Pet. 5. 7. great reward. The Lord shal bring it to passe vpon vs. Cast thy burden vpon the Lord, & he shal nourish thee: He will not suf∣fer the righteous to fall for euer. Cast al your care vppon him: for hee careth for you. And in thus easing vs of our burthen, let vs not be negligent and slouthfull, but let vs knowe that care, labour, and diligence are ordeined for al times. Wherfore let vs follow the bur∣den that God hath laid vpon vs, which is, In the sweate of thy face Gen. 2. 15. &. 3. 19. 2. The. 3. 10. Psal. 37. 3. shalt thou eate thy bread. If then wee labour not, wee are well worthie to fall into great pouertie, and are not worthie to eate, vnlesse wee labour. Albeit then that wee must trust in GOD and commit our affaires vnto him, yet must wee not haue a slouthfull hande, but to be occupied in well doing. Commit thy way vnto &. 15. the Lorde, and trust in him, and hee shal bring it too passe. But as hath beene saide, wee must not doe it for feare to waxe poore: for albeit that wee labour, yet shall we not ceasse to bee poore and nee∣dy, except God blesse our labour. For, neither is hee that plan∣teth, any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giueth the encrease. It is very lawful to labour for to flie and auoide pouertie, but not to bee seased with the feare thereof: as it is lawful to be∣come 1. Cor. 3. 7. riche by working with care and diligence, but it is not lawful to couet riches: for such desire is couetousnesse, which is very de∣testable before God, and hurtfull to our neighbours, which is not Ephe. 5. 3. &. 5. Col. 3. 5 lawful to bee named. Whosoeuer is couetous, is an idolater: for he serueth riches, and not God: hee putteth his trust in vnsensible creatures, and not in the Creator, which hath giuen him wit and vnderstanding: hee worshippeth golde and siluer, and his belly, and not God, from who me all riches commeth. And as hee hath not Ephe. 5. 5. his heart set on God, so hath hee no part in his inheritance. The couetous person which is an idolater, hath no inheritaunce in the kingdome of Christ and of God. Saint Paul nameth the couetous, amongest them which shall not inherite the kingdome of God. It 1. Cor. 6. 10. is good reason that suche persons shoulde bee abhorred before God, and cast out of his kingdome, when they distrust him, which is all good and almightie, and doth good to all men: (for wee haue
nothing but of his goodnesse and liberalitie) & do put their trust in their owne arme: they leaue and stay themselues vpon transitory thinges, wherein they set their affection, for the which to satisfie and to possesse riches at their wishe and desire, they gather wrong∣fully and otherwayes then they shoulde: they pole and pill their neighbours diuerse waies, and so they make themselues the eni∣mies of God and of men. Wherefore they shall haue a great count to make. Besides this, when wee heare that the hande of the di∣ligent maketh riche, let vs not depriue God of his honour: but confesse that if through our diligence wee encrease in riches, that it is, because God guideth our hands, & our worke, and blesseth our labour, &c. Also that which wee haue saide to bee a slouthfull hande, Solomon in his speache calleth, a deceitfull hand. For they which are negligent and slouthfull, and which doe not their office and duetie, doe dreame hollowly and deuise vnlaweful meanes, to drawe vnto them the goodes of others. And because that Solo∣mon setteth diligence against deceit, we take deceit for negligēce & slouthfulnesse. 5 Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the sonne of wise∣dome: but hee that sleepeth in Haruest, is the sonne of confusion. Albeit that our Lorde (for to make vs to put our trust & hope in God our father) doeth say vnto vs, Beholde the foules of the ayre: for they sowe not, neither reape, nor carry into the barnes & yet your heauenly father feedeth them: yet let vs not thinke hee goeth about to turne vs away from labouring, or that hee woulde wee should suffer the goodes that God bringeth out of the earth to perish, or that we shold eate vp al in one day, without keeping some¦thing all the yere long. For first of al our Lord hath not taught for to abolish the decree of God his father, the which is, that man should labour, not onely one day, but all the yeere through: and that in la∣bouring hee might liue and be nourished euery day, throughout his life: as he gaue to Adam to vnderstand (placing him in the gar∣den of Eden, for to dresse it) that hee should eate his bread in the
sweate of his face, vntill hee returne vnto the earth. And after the flood hee saide, Heere after seede time and haruest, and colde and heate, and Sommer and Winter, and day and night, shall not ceasse Gen. 2. 15. & 3. 19. &. 8. 22 so long as the earth remaineth. God hath not ordeined these times and seasons in vaine, but that according to the time and season man shoulde imploy himselfe to work and to labour, and that thereof he shoulde gather fruite to susteine him and his. And sith that haruest doth not come but once a yeere, and that the same is ordeined for to gather the fruites of the earth, that God hath brought foorth for mans sustenance, it followeth that in acknowledging the good∣nesse and liberalitie of God our heauenly father: if wee gather the fruites of the earth, and lay them vp in barnes and sellers, and too keepe them, and to vse them for our necessitie all the yeere after, that in so doing, wee doe not disobey the doctrine of our Lorde, but wee obey God, and consequently our Lord. For it is not his in∣tent to condemne the seede time and haruest, nor the prouision that is made without couetousnesse: onely hee woulde that wee should not beenigardes, as they which haue neuer enough: and as hath beene saide, Doe feare that the earth shoulde faile them. If wee must not be such, much lesse may we be like these theeues and mur∣derers, to these rogues and cutthrotes, which gather the fruites of the earth, vnder hope to make them deare, and wil enrich them¦selues by the hurte of their poore neighbour. They which professe the Gospell, and doe vse suche cruell trades, and such vngentle and diuelishe traines and deuises, as there are but too many which occupie them,) doe greatly offende and giue an e∣uill example: and it were better that they neuer had heard speaking of the Gospell, except the Lord graunt them grace to confesse their sinnes, and to forsake and giue ouer suche hellishe practises. If our Lord would induce not to gather in season, he would pul vs back frō wisdome, and woulde set vs in confusion: he would make vs to de∣spise the ordinance of God, our father, the which wee ought in no maner of wise either to thinke or speake: but knowing that Iesus Christ is of one wil with God his father, we must gather in Sōmer, & watch in haruest, that is, that we take care & diligēce to lay our hands to worke according to the seasons & times appointed, euery one folowing the estate wherto god hath called him. For albeit that
Solomon hath not expressed but Sommer and Haruest, because he endeuoureth to giue vs briefe sentences, and easie to beholde, yet wee will heere comprehende all seasons, and whatsoeuer GOD woulde that man shoulde bee occupied in. If wee spende the time aboute the labours and workes that God hath ordeined, we shalbe wise, and shall auoide confusion, from which also wee shall keepe others, so muche as lyeth in vs: for we will liue of our labor, and shalbe preserued from begging, which is a confusion not able to be borne, and shall also deliuer them from it which we shall refresh with the fruite of our paine and trauel. Contrarily, if we be giuen to sleepe, and to idlenesse, when it is time to worke, wee shall both confounde ourselues and others, for whome we are bounde to be∣stowe ourselues, to keepe them from begging. This worde Confu∣sion, is taken in this signification in the 37. Psalme, They shall not be confounded in the perilous time, and in the dayes of famine they Psal. 37. 19. shal haue enough. But it may be said that Solomon should not haue brought foorth this as a notable sentence, seeing that there is not so simple an Idiot, which knoweth not wel that we must gather riches in due season, and that wee must not be sluggishe when it is time to gather the fruites of the earth: and therefore, that there is not so much wisedome in it, as that there shoulde bee mention made of it. I answere, That sith God hath ordeyned such gathering and vi∣gilancie, it is no smal wisedome for a man to knowe well howe too imploy himselfe as it behooueth. All the wisedome of the Monkes and Friers in Popery, is nothing but foolishnesse and va∣nitie, yea euen wickednesse, in comparison of this wisedome. But it may bee replied, that there is not the poorest Labourer or handy craftes man that is not as wise as the ministers of the Church: for the ministers doe no other thing then did the Friers, Priestes and Monkes. I answere, That the true Ministers are assured of their vocation, and do occupie themselues therein, and also they do not gather togeather nor watche. The true Ministers, are Preachers, Doctours, Pastours, builders, Reapers, Sowers, Watchmen: but the Friers are cleane contrary, they are good for nothing but to trouble the water, to prate without doctrine, to eate, to destroy, so treade vnderfoote the good corne, & to be dumb dogs & sleepy.
There is then great difference: for as we haue probation, some are wise children, and others doe bring confusion. 6 Blessings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniqui∣tie shal couer the mouth of the wicked. So long as we liue in this bodie, wee can not iudge by our out∣ward wit what the righteous are, (that is to say, those which by the feare, reuerence, and Fayth they beare vnto the worde of God, doe delight to serue the Lorde and their neighbours, and desire to pro∣fite al men, and to hurt no man,) neither that they can be counted blessed, nor that they are in the grace and fauour of God, seeing that we see them abounde in miserie, and to bee beaten downe with ca∣lamities: they are afflicted of the world by peeling and polling, pri∣sonment, woundes, banishment, cursing, lying, slandering, and ca∣uillations, & diuers other wayes, which can not be easily expressed. For some doe suffer in one sort, and some in an other: to be shorte, it seemeth that God is their enemy, and that hee persecuteth them to destroy them. And therefore, fewe esteemeth wel of them, as Eliphas the Themanite of Iob. Remember, I pray thee: who euer Iob. 4. 7. perished being an innocent? Or where were the righteous destroy∣ed? The Iewes did no lesse esteeme of the Prophets, and of our Lord Iesus Christ, and of his Apostles. The Papists haue the poore Chri∣stians which suffer persecution for the Gospel, in like reputatiō. Cō∣trarily, the wicked (that is to say, the infidels, which with wil and minde, with deed and word, doe despight God, and make no count Psal. 7. 3. of their neighbours,) are iudged happie and blessed: they are fea∣sted, they are praysed and commended, and it seemeth wel that they are in the grace and fauour of God, and that he doeth blesse them, that hee doeth loue them and mainteine them. Such is the iudge∣ment of carnal man, which iudgeth after the outwarde sight: but Fayth iudgeth farre otherwise, and the worde whervpon Fayth is stayed, pronounceth also contrarie: as we see it, when Solomon is not contented alone to say, that the righteous shal obteine blessing: but to shewe that he is euen here happie in diuers sortes, although he be greatly molested: he sayeth, blessinges are vpon the head of the righteous: hee appointeth not the time, neither present nor to
come, for to declare that the blessings shal not fayle them: but ha∣uing had their beginning in this life, they shal endure for euer. Bles∣sed are ye, when men reuile you, and persecute you, and say al man∣ner of euil against you for my sake, falsly. My brethren, count it ex∣ceeding ioy, when ye fall into diuers temptations. Againe, Blessed Mat. 5. 11. Iam. 1. 2. Iam. 1, 12. is the man, that endureth tentation: for when he is tried, he shal receiue the Crowne of life, which the Lorde hath promised to them that loue him. Contrarily, though the wicked doe florish, yet are they, and shalbe cursed, as may be knowne plainly, when their ini∣quitie shalbee opened, and that for the same they shalbe ashamed, for because of their iniquitie, which shalbe as a choke peare to stop their mouth, they shal not be able to alledge any thing worthe to defende themselues with al. Solomon doeth signifie it, when hee sayeth, But iniquitie shal couer the mouth of the wicked. In some it is opened sooner, and in other some later. Some mens sinnes are manifest before hande, and goe before vnto iudgement: but some mens folowe after. For their iniquitie committed, they shal suffer 1. Tim. 5. 24. punishment before al men, wherwith they shalbe greatly confoun∣ded: and the righteous shalbe glorified and honoured, and their felicitie shal shine and shalbe seene of al men. Solomon doeth wel signifie the same, when he placeth the blessings to light on the head, the which is the highest part in man, vpon the which the ornaments can not be hid. These ornaments of blessing are nowe hidde in the worlde: but they which are not stayed at the outwarde appea∣rance, but by Fayth, do beholde the goodnesse that God hath done vnto his faythful seruantes in the midst of their troubles, doe see euen presently the head of the righteous garnished with blessinges, the which they shal more plainly see in the possession of the hea∣uenly kingdome. 7 The memorial of the iust shalbe blessed: but the name of the wicked shal rotte. Albeit, that nowe presently it seemeth vnto the worlde, that the righteous are forgotten before God, because that no man reuengeth the iniuries & wrongs that are done them (as Dauid doth declare it, saying, He hath saide in his heart, God hath forgotten, he hideth Psal. 10. 11. away his face, and wil neuer see. O Lorde the auenger, O God the
auenger, shewe thy selfe clearely. And for this cause also the faith∣ful doe lament, and complaine. Why standest thou farre of, O Lord, Psal. 94. 1. Psal. 10. 1. Psal. 13. 1. Psal. 45. 23. & 24. and hidest thee in due time, euen in affliction? Againe, How long wilt thou forget mee, O Lorde? for euer? Howe long wilt thou hide thy face from mee? Againe, Vp, why sleepest thou, O Lorde? awake, be not farre of for euer. Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and for∣gettest our miserie & our affliction?) yet notwithstanding, he hath not so much forgotten them, but that he doeth remember to blesse them for to doe them good, and shewe them grace and fauour, to giue them helpe, defence and sauegarde, so farre as hee knoweth to be expedient to bring them vnto eternal blessing. Solomon doeth signifie the same, saying, The memorial of the iust, shalbe blessed. Contrarily, the wicked are famous, they are commended, and doe prayse themselues. He sayeth in his heart, I shal neuer be mooued, Psal. 10. 6. & 12. 4. nor be in danger. And, With our tongue wil we preuaile: our lippes are our owne: who is Lorde ouer vs? but their name shalbe abomi∣nable and filthie. Solomon doeth declare it, saying, The name of the wicked shal rotte. 8 The wise in heart wil receiue commandements: but the foolish in talke shalbe beaten. Our wisedome is to keepe and to doe the commandementes of Deut. 4. 6. God. Wherefore the wise sayeth verie wel, that the wise of heart, will receiue them. Hee sayeth expresly, the wise of heart, that is to say, hee which truely loueth wisedome, and is no counter∣faite as the worldly wise, which iustifie so much themselues, that they can not abide any admonition though it be very needeful, as S. Paule doeth shewe it, This knowe also, that in the last dayes shall 2. Tim. 3. 1. come perillous times, &c. Those that are such, can not suffer any ad∣monitions neither of Father nor Magistrates, neither yet of Mini∣sters: and yet lesse of priuate and particular persons. But he which hath wisedome printed in his heart, knoweth well that hee hath neede of wisedome, and desireth to increase therein: and therfore hee gladly heareth that which is shewed him in the name, and by the Worde of GOD, and laboureth to conforme him∣self
vnto the doctrine that is set before him. This same is to receiue the commandements, and not to be like vnto the sonne which pro∣mised to his father to doe that hee commaunded, and did nothing. But rather if in time past wee haue saide, we wil not goe, that nowe by true repentance & Fayth let vs giue our hearts to obey God our father, & consequently them, which hee hath ordeined ouer vs, to direct and gouerne vs. Thus doing, wee shal not bee woorthie of stripes and woundes, but rather of good rewarde and recompence: though wee can not deserue it, but suche is the wil of God our Fa∣ther, so to recompence his obedient children and seruants. Contra∣rily, if we declare ourselues to be rebels and disobedient, let vs looke to be beaten as we deserue, because of our follie, which we shew in gain saying, and striuing against the trueth, and that by iustice and e∣quitie. Solomon doeth shewe it vs, saying, But the foolish in talke shalbe beaten. Hee that maketh not count of true wisedome which is taught vs by the worde, but doeth giue himselfe to speake and doe things contrarie therevnto, is foolish in his talke, and yet cea∣seth not to be folish in his heart: for from the abundance of the hart the mouth speaketh: and also other outwarde workes doe folowe thereof: for the outward parte is like to the in warde, except wee disfigure ourselues by hypocrisie, the which wil alwayes appeare holie and wise, and not foolishe: and therefore, if we shewe any foolishnesse in wordes, or in workes, it is a plaine argument that wee are not wise in heart. Wherefore, wee may iudge that they which permit and take leaue to talke foolishly, or to do acts against God and his worde, for to auoide persecutions, doe deceiue them∣selues when they would make men beleeue that they thinke not as they say, or as they doe: for the outward workes, and chiefly suche as are wicked, are certaine fruites conceiued in the heart of man, the which is euil from his childhood. And thus, though Solomon doe not speake but of the lippes, yet he forgetteth not to touch the hart, which is the roote that bringeth foorth the fruite, as we ought to vnderstande by the former reasons. And also the Antithesis or com∣parison that hee maketh betweene the wise in heart, and the foo∣lish in talke, doeth shewe it wel: otherwise it should not agree. In the first parte of the comparison, he expresseth the roote, for to ex∣clude worldly wisedome, which is of great shew, and is nothing but
rebellion: for it wil not be subiect vnto the lawe of God: for it is ledde by the desire of the fleshe: afterwardes hee expresseth the Rom. 8. 6. 7. fruites which proceede from the true wisedome of the heart, that is to say, To receiue the commandements: wherein hee noteth the obedience of the wise in heart, to the which the wise worldlinges are contrarie and opposite: whereof foloweth, that they are diso∣bedient. In the seconde parte of the comparison, hee expresseth but the euil fruite, which can notlye: and therefore in expressing it, hee de∣clareth plainly what the roote is, that is to say, euil: for the tree is knowne by his fruite. He immediatly after expresseth the recom∣pence of them which speake and doe euil, that is to say, that they shalbe beaten, they shalbee chastened and punished, first in this worlde, if so be it, that they watch diligently ouer the publike slan∣ders and offences, and that the Magistrates be zealous, and that they bee careful to pronounce good and right iudgement, vppon that which they knowe, and is manifest vnto them, in susteining and de∣fending the good, and punishing the wicked, according as the fruits appeare: for they haue not the knowledge of in warde foolishnesse, but so farre as the same is opened outwardly: and therefore, Solo∣mon sayeth not, the foolish of heart shalbe beaten: but the foolish in talke, that is to say, hee which shal shewe himselfe foolishe by wordes and wicked workes. If fathers and mothers loue their chil∣dren, & are careful more for their soules then for their bodies, they wil chasten them, if their manners and conuersation be not good and honest. They which spare the rodde at neede, doe hate their chil∣dren, and make no count of the honour of God. Wherevpon they ought to looke for grieuous punishment: for sith they wil not strike whilest it is time, they themselues are worthie to be beaten. And also it happeneth often vnto them, that their children which they haue borne withal in their malice, when they come to age, not on∣ly doe set naught by them and reiect them, but also stand vp against them, in robbing them, cursing and doing them much hurt. And fi∣nally, if they doe not confesse their negligence, they shalbe beaten with eternal paynes. If superiours doe truely loue their subiectes, they wil chasten the foolishe, that the good may liue in peace, and that the slaunders and offences may be rooted out from the congre∣gation
of the Lorde: otherwise they shalbe beaten: for first of all, the foolish wil rise vp against them: and in the ende, they shal not a∣uoide eternal damnation. I wil honour them that honour mee, &c. 1. Sam. 2. 30. And as they which ought to punish the foolishe, shalbe beaten for their negligence: euen so also, shal the foolishe be for their foolish∣nes, except they returne by true repentance. 9 He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, shalbe knowne. For as much as wee al desire to auoide perils and dangers, and to liue safely and without feare of euil, we must heare Solomon which doth admonish vs of the meanes, when he sayeth, He that walketh vprightly. There is none in this worlde that liueth so perfectly, but that he hath some fault. For wee haue al neede to craue pardon for our sinnes, and continually to confesse that we are sinners, how vp∣rightly soeuer we liue: and thus the vprightnesse wherof Solomon speaketh, lyeth not in a perfection that can not be mended, & wher∣to there can nothing be added: for so long as we liue in this world, we haue neede to repent, to amend our faults, and alwayes to grow forwarde in goodnesse, through the knowledge of the trueth. But this vprightnesse lieth in soundnesse of conscience, whereby hauing our heartes right and not double, we abhorre al dissimulations and hypocrisies, and labour to folowe holines, righteousnes and trueth in al things, and with al men. The worlde maketh no great account of this vprightnesse, but al the worlde almost is giuen to deceit and craftie dealing, vnto filthines and vncleannes, vnto hypocrisie & ly∣ing. And forasmuch as the greatest parte of men & women are such, Psal. 12. 2. they iudge themselues to be in safetie, when they are giuen to such wickednes. And so the number of them which beleeue the sentence of Solomon, is verie smal, and almost none. Wherevpon foloweth also that there is almost none, that walketh safely: but it happeneth almost to al, as it is said, When they shal say, Peace, and safetie; then shal come vpon them, sodeine destruction. The world destroyed by the flood, Sodome and Gomorrha, Dathan, Core and Abiram, and . Thes. 5. 3 diuers other wicked ones, haue wel felt and shal feele it, and if wee folowe them, wee must looke also to feele the same. For
as the Lorde knoweth the righteous & perfect, for to deliuer them from temptation, to keepe them, to defend them, and to saue them, that hee may giue them victorie ouer al perils and dangers: euen so also they which peruerte their wayes, contemning all integritie and vprightnes, and giuing themselues in diuers sortes vnto contrarie thinges, can not be hid, but shalbe knowne by the Lorde, to draw Mat. 13. 4. them and deuide them from the iust and perfect, as wee separate the tares and the chaffe from the good corne, for to sende them vnto vnquenchable fire. In looking for the which, albeit they say, that God doeth not see them, nor knowe them, yet can hee finde them out, as they daily feele by warres, pestilences, famines, diseases, by afflictions outward & inward: and in this sort they beginne heere their hel, the which shal not forsake them. For as they esteeme not to make their wayes right, as wel by blindnes and ignorance, as by hardnes & obstinacie, & that attributing al vnto fortune & chance, in their affliction they knowe not that it is the hande of God that striketh them, neither also doe they make any haste to turne vnto God, for to craue of him repentance and amendement of their sins, and deliuerance from euil: and so they must needes perish in them. But albeit, that after the outwarde apparance and the sense of the flesh, the iust & perfect suffer in this word the like or more grieuous afflictions, yet do they not here begin their hel. For they knowing that they be the roddes of God their Father, doe aske deliuerance, and are assured to obteine the same. And thus on what side soeuer that the afflictiōs do come to the iust & perfect, because they know that God is their keeper and deliuerer, they are not afrayde as dis∣couraged and desperate, but in al assurance they say, Yea though I should walke through the valley of the shadow of death, I wil feare Psal. 23. 4. & 27. 1. none euil. Againe, The Lorde is my light and my saluation: whome shal I feare? The Lorde is the strength of my lyfe, of whom shal I bee afrayde? They knowe this same, because of the infallible pro∣mise: and cal vpon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie mee. The Lorde is neere vnto al that Psal. 50. 15. & 145. 18. Mat. 11. 28. Luk. 12. 32. 1. Cor. 10. 13. call vppon him: yea, to all that call vppon him in trueth. Come vnto mee, all yee that are wearie and laden, and I will ease you. Feare not, litle flocke: for it is your fathers pleasure, to giue you the kingdome. And GOD is faythful, which wil not suffer
you to be tempted aboue that you bee able, but wil euen giue the issue with the temptatiō, that ye may be able to beare it. The wicked can not thus speake indeed: for although they thinke themselues so safe and sure that they can not be more, and that they trust in their owne strength, yet because they are hated of God, he can wel finde them out, and bring their enterprises to naught, and destroy them by their owne counsels. He hath made a pit and digged it, and is fal∣len into the pit that he made. His mischiefe shal returne vppon his Psal. 7. 15. & 16. owne head, and his crueltie shal fal vpon his owne pate. The hea∣then are suncken downe in the pit that they made: in the nette that they hid, is their foote taken. Psal. 9. 15. 10 Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh sorow: and hee that is foolish in talke, shalbe beaten. Amongst them which peruert their wayes, there are some more cloase and couerte then other some are: some there bee that are knowne foorthwith, and others againe for a certaine time lye hid and are secret. The close and hid, are most hurtful & pernitious. For a time they make a goodly shewe, and beare a smooth countenance, and seeme that they laugh at the prosperitie of their neighbour, as though they were readie to do them pleasure: but yet for all that they delight to mocke, & to inuent some treason. Solomon doth sig∣nifie the same by wincking or making signe with the eye. But when at last their dissimulation and hypocrisie is knowne, and that they are seene to counterfaite and dissemble, by the fruites which come from them, then feele we greater sorowe and more grieuous payne then if wee had knowne them openly at the first. Solomon doth sig∣nifie the same, when he sayeth, That he worketh sorowe, that winc∣keth with his eye. If they (which by suche maners bring hurt, either to the bodie or to this worlds good) do worke sorow, & that we be careful to take heede therof, by a more strong reason must wee take heed of Monkes & Friers which haue a goodly shew, for with this, Mat. 7. 15. Rom. 16. 18. 1. Tim. 6. 5. Mat. 15. 14. that they deuoure tēporal riches, iudging gain to be godlines, so do they also destroy the soules of those that folow thē. For if the blind lead the blind, both shal fal into the ditch, the which is a sorow and griefe vnexpressable, and without any remedie, except wee prouide helpe in good time for the same. They which openly declare and shewe foorth their foolishnes and wickednes, are not so dangerous:
they bring not so much sorow to them which haue any wit to fiye and auoide them, or to turne them away from their enterprises, or to suppresse their insolencie. Also, looke where there is good order, when they shewe themselues suche, they are admonished and re∣buked, they are chastened and punished: And therfore they can not bring so much sorowe and griefe. Solomon doeth signifie it, saying, He that is foolish in talke, shalbe be beaten. There is here no ver∣tue compared or set against vice, but a greater vice, vnto a lesser. The first part of the sentence conteineth a rebuke of hypocrisie, flat∣terie, dissimulation, and counterfaiting, with aduertisement of the euil that commeth thereof. Wherein we ought to learne, not to be children in vnderstanding, but of ripe wit and good discretion, see∣ing 1. Cor. 14. 20 there is none but is grieued, when he feeleth himselfe to be de∣ceiued. By the second part, hee sheweth what the foolish and wic∣ked doe deserue, and warneth them that are aloft and in authoritie, to doe their duetie, and to take away offences and slanders so much as in them lieth. And moreouer, because that no man would glad∣ly be beaten, hee exhorteth vs to be wise, and to be of good, holie, and honest conuersation. If thus doing we suffer wrong, as haue the holie Patriarks, Prophets, Iesus Christ and his Apostles, and other seruants of God, let vs not be grieued. Blessed are they which suf∣fer persecution for righteousnes sake. And who is it that wil harme Mat. 5. 10. 1. Pet. 3. 13 & 4. 12. you, if ye folowe that which is good? Dearely beloued, think it not strange concerning the firie trial, which is among you to proue you, as though some strange thing were come vnto you. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a welspring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked. For when a verie cleare spring and pure, floweth with water, running here and there by fordes, then it serueth to refreshe them which drinke therof, and preserueth them from dying by thirst: and so it is healthful vnto them, & doth also as cōcerning the body quic∣ken the same. The mouth of the righteous wil speake of wisedome, Psal. 37. 3. and his tongue wil talke of iudgement. Then doeth it profite them which beleeue his counsels, for they are deliuered from death, inso∣much as they are freed from sin, & made seruants to God, they haue their fruit in holines, and the end, euerlasting life: for the righteous Rom. 6. 22. doeth not teach nor counsel, but onely that which serueth to salua∣tion
& life. Solomon doth signifie it, when he calleth his mouth the welspring of life. Our Lorde saith that from the abundance of the hart the mouth speaketh. Now it is said: the law of his God is in his hart, therfore his steps shal not slide. Whervppon foloweth that it Mat. 12. 34. Psal. 37. 31. bringeth life to them which receiue this doctrine, which folow his counsels, tremble at his threatnings, & delite in his exhortatiōs, & also do assure thēselues of the promises of life that is preached vnto them. Cōtrarily, as out of a durty puddle, we can draw nothing but filthines and infection, for to infect, poison & to kil those which drinke therof: so also it is saide, there is no constancie in the mouth of the wicked: within they are very corruption, their throte is an open sepulchre, & they flatter with their tongue. Wherupon folow∣eth Psalm. 5. 9. that we can learne nothing of the mouth of the wicked, but al e∣uil, when we heare no maner of goodnes come from their mouth: but it aboūdeth with al filthy & corrupt words, as it appeareth: for it doth open it self. Solomon doth signifie the same, saying, but ini∣quitie couereth the mouth of the wicked. When Solomon saieth, doth couer, he neither excludeth the time past nor present, but spea∣king in the future tence, hee sheweth the hardnes and obstinacie of the wicked, to the end that we should stande vpon our watche at al times. For as they haue not ceased nor do cease, so also they shal ne∣uer cease, vntil the ende of the worlde, to speake filthily, to giue euil counsel, & to spread abroade false doctrine. But the euil men & de∣ceiuers, shal waxe worse & worse, deceiuing and beeing deceiued. Now they which folow their vncleannes & wickednes, giuing thē∣selues vnto iniquitie, shal fal in death. For it is saide, The rewarde of 2. Tim. 3. 13. sinne, is death. Heeretofore, we haue expounded the 2. parte of this sentence otherwise, but not contrary, & that by force of the Anti∣thesis Rom. 6. 23. or comparison that Solomon maketh there. Heere hee setteth the vertue of wel speaking & ruling the mouth, against the vice of peruerse and wicked mouthes. Hee doeth this honor vnto them which speake wel, for to attribute vnto them the welspring of life, and to make them as it were auctors of health and life, vnto these which learne of them. Saint Iames doeth the like, saying, Brethren if any amongst you hath erred from the trueth, and some man hath conuerted him, let him knowe that hee which hath conuerted Iam. 5. 19. & 20. the sinner from going astray or out of his way, shall saue a soule
from death. And this is according vnto the doctrine of our Lorde. Thus it pleaseth the Lorde to honour such as speake trueth. Con∣trarily, Mat. 18. 15 Iohn. 20. 23. Solomon accuseth those which haue their mouthes coue∣red with iniquitie, of murther: hee expresseth not the accusation, but it must bee vnderstoode by the present Antithesis. Nowe sith that they which haue an euil tongue are murtherers, they cannot looke but for death. Contrarily, those which out of the good trea∣sure of their hartes do bring good thinges, are assured of life, as by their office they are the auctors of life, &c. 12 Hatred stirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all trespasses. When men or women are kindled with hatred, wrath, & anger, with enuie and yll wil against their neighbours, although it be very wrongfully and without cause, and that their neighbours haue giuē them no maner of occasion to beare euil affection towardes thē; yet can they not speake gently and louingly vnto them, they cannot say wel of them: but do wrong and deale iniuriously with them, and speake al the euil they can against them, & do greatly reproche them to their faces, being ready to stryke & beate them, to murther & kil the innocents: & behind their backes they slaunder & do falsly be∣ly them, they diffame them, & bring them into the hatred, so much as they cā, of al the world, that many may rise vp against them which haue not offēded, that they may be destroyed & vndone: So much as possible they cā, they set al in trouble, they stir vp seditiōs, vprores & persecutions against those that wish them no euil. Solomō doeth signifie it, saying, hatred stirreth vp contentions. This stir is made, as is sayde, and as the innocentes in al tymes haue had trial: As A∣bel, Moyses, Dauid, the Prophetes, our Lorde, his Apostles, and o∣ther faithful men: and yet stil the wicked cease not to doe and to speake the like against them that folowe the trueth, and that desire nothing but their health and saluation. But the saying of Solomon ought not to be restrained vnto this maner of hatred. For we haue experiēce that whē there is hatred betweene parties, that they bite & sting one another, do charge & reproch one another with al the villanies they cā: they detract one another, & there is nothing but they wil blame, & interpret the doings & sayings one of another al∣together
in the euil parte: the which is cause of mortal strife, of se∣ditions, of vprores, of battels and warres, of murthers and slaugh∣ters. Mat. 5. 22. 1. Ioh. 3. 13. Solomon doeth wel signifie it here: and so he accuseth al them which hate their neighbours of murther & manslaughter: hee pro∣nounceth them guiltie, and breakers of this commandement, Thou shalt not kil: as doth also our Lord, who soeuer hateth his brother, is a mansleyar. They that are suche, can not pray vnto God, but a∣gainst themselues, as appeareth. Wherefore, we must vnderstande, Mat. 6. 18. that hatred is a sinne most detestable, and which wee ought greatly to abhorre when it separateth vs from God, and hindereth vs to haue accesse vnto him. Contrarily, for that which hath beene saide of hatred, if men and women doe truely loue their neighbours, they wil speake vnto them with al softnes and gentlenes, they will haue none euil suspition of them, they wil not labour to hinder their good name: but where they are euil spoken of, they wil endeuour to excuse them, and euen when we haue offended them, they wil dis∣semble and beare with many thinges: they suffer, and yet forgiue many thinges, burying their neighbours faultes, and labour to saue their honestie. Solomon doeth wel signifie it, saying, But loue couereth all trespasses: and after him, Saint Paule sayeth, Loue is 1. Cor. 13. 4. patient. We haue here a doctrine of great excellencie, whereunto we must diligently apply ourselues, if we wil auoide strife and con∣tentions, & to be the true children of God: Beloued, let vs loue one another: for loue cōmeth of God, & euery one that loueth, is borne 1. Ioh. 4. 7. of God, and knoweth God. Notwithstanding, this is not to say, that if our neighbours be offensiue, that we should allow their wic∣kednesses: but if they haue offended vs, that we should beare with them in healing them, and giuing remedie thereto by admonitions, aduertisements, corrections, and threatenings, not sharpe nor rigo∣rous at the first entrance, least it happē, that handling them too hard∣ly at the beginning, the euil and disease be rather increased & made worse, then diminished & amended. When S. Peter exhorteth vs, that aboue al things we should haue feruent loue amongst vs: for loue couereth the multitude of sinnes: 1. Pet. 4. 8. for to confirme his exhortation, & to shew vs that there is nothing more profitable vnto the saints & faithful, thē to mainteine mutual charitie, hee bringeth this reason. For loue couereth the multitude
of sinnes. And this is most fitly and aptly, forsomuch as wee all of∣fende, and fall in many thinges. Wherefore wee haue all neede to be forgiuen, and there is no man but desireth to be forgiuen. Thus loue is very necessary. For if it rule amongest vs, she bringeth vs this excellent benefite, that wee forget innumerable euils. Contrarily, if wee giue hatred the bridle, men in biting and tearing one another, must needes consume one another: And therefore Paule doeth ex∣hort Gala. 5. 13 vs by loue to serue one another. And wee must marke that So∣lomon saith, All trespasses, And Saint Peter, multitude of sinnes: wherein they teach vs, that in what sorte soeuer our neighbours sinne against vs, and howe often soeuer they shall offende vs, wee shoulde gladly forgiue them, if we loue them truely, and that accor∣ding vnto the sentence of our Lorde. And for to shewe vs that we ought and are bounde to obey his sentence, and that we should not Mat. 18. 22. thinke wee doe any great thing when we forgiue, hee addeth a si∣militude. As touching the rest, by howe much as loue doeth giue remedie to more sinnes, by so muche doeth his profite reach fur∣ther vnto the conseruation of mankinde, the which falleth asunder, and runneth to destruction through hatred & variance that folow∣eth thereof. Beholde, this is the plaine meaning of this verse. Wher∣vpon it appeareth, that the Papists doe wel deserue to bee mocked, when, by corrupting this text, they labour to establish their satisfac∣tions, and would haue almes and other workes of charitie to take place of recompence before God, for to put away sinnes. It is verie true, that if wee haue pitie and compassion of our brethren which erre & goe astray, & that of loue we shew them their faltes, so that by our aduertisement they returne to wel dooing, our loue serueth them to obteine forgiuenes of their sinnes. Brethren, if any of you Ia. 5. 19. & 20. haue erred from the truth, and some man hath conuerted him, let him knowe that he which hath conuerted the sinner from going a∣stray out of his way, shal saue a soule from death, and shal hide a multitude of sinnes. Wherein let vs note that S. Iames doeth not alledge the witnes of Solomon, but only doeth make an allusion theretoo: as if he said, Solomon saith that the frute of loue is, that it couereth sinnes: but there is no better nor more healthful way for to hide them, then when they are vtterly & cleane blotted out be∣fore God. Now this is done, when by our admonition the sinner is
reduced and brought again into the good way: & therfore we must be diligent to admonish thē which go astray. Moreouer, although it is not the intent of Solomon, yet the trueth standeth, that if by loue we forgiue our neighbors the offences they cōmit against vs, that God wil forgiue vs ours that we cōmit against him. But yet for al that let vs not think that our loue or the conuersion and winning Mat. 6. 14. of our neighbours can deserue the forgiuenesse of sinnes: and ther∣fore wee shoulde not haue regarde vnto them to rest our saluation therevpon, which commeth of the forgiuenesse of our sinnes: but let vs knowe that both the one and the other doe obteine pardon and to attaine vnto saluation, because that by faith wee are assured, and stayed vpon the promises of God, which are conteined in the Eze. 18. Mat. 6 bokes of the Prophetes and Apostles. 13 In the lippes of him that hath vnderstanding, wisedome is founde, and a rodde shalbe for the backe of him that is destitute of wisedome. He is a wise man which being taught in the worde of God, doeth set his whole delight therein, and through the knowledge that he hath thereof, the which is printed in his heart, he laboureth to gouerne himselfe wel both in his doings and sayings. Suche a man is replenished with true wisedome. And for so much as from the a∣bundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh, they that are such, must needes vtter wisedome, and continne and perseuer therein. Also Solomon sayeth not, that wisedome hath bene founde, or is found, albeit that it is so: but to shewe the constancie and perseueraunce, hee sayeth, shalbe founde. This is a great argument, that in this worlde the number of wise men is verie small, and almost none. For if there bee verie fewe of them, in whose lippes wisedome is founde, yet is the number of them lesse, in whom it shalbe found, experience doeth sufficiently shewe it, but yet wee may vnder∣stande the same by the parable of the seede cast into the grounde, Mat. 13. &c. For as the heart is disposed, so doeth it leade and gouerne the lippes. And as touching the countrie, where, the Preachers by the worde of God, doe freely and at libertie teach the true wisdom and prudence, we finde in the lippes of the most parte, foolishnes and wickednes, we may wel iudge, that the heartes are bent and dispo∣posed to euil, and that they are destitute of prudence and wisedome.
If the Magistrates and iustices of the bench had such zeale as they ought to haue to do their office, & that they were so careful to take heede as it behoueth, vpon the slanders and insolentnesse: If fathers and mothers, and such as haue the charge of youth, did straightly looke to the maners of childrē & yong people, we should see other maner of punishments and corrections then wee doe. The foolish which for want of good minde and hart do openly disdaine and re∣iect wisedome, and are so lewde that they giue themselues vnto vanitie, foolishnes, and wickednes, should be punished, for they wel deserue the same: as Solomon sayth, that a rod shalbe for the backe of him, that is destitute of wisdom, or lewd of hart. Wherein So∣lomon sheweth into what dishonor and danger they do bring thē∣selues, which haue not a right hart, & they which set not their mind & desire to folow vnderstanding and wisdom, but do lay the bridle in the neck of their carnal lustes, and doe delight in things nothing worth, and folow folishnes and wickednes. He teacheth Magistrates also their lesson, and doth shew them that if the foolish & vnprofi∣table & hurtful persons continew in their lewdnes, and doe openly declare it, either by deedes or by words, that they ought not to ab∣staine from giuing such punishment, as the foolishe and wicked shal deserue. Likewise he instructeth fathers & mothers. Furthermore, when he setteth lewdnes of hart against vnderstanding, and the rod against wisdom, we ought to vnderstand that the prudent and wise should be handled with al softnes & gentlenes, & that they should be kept from al shame and wrong. But the doctrine of Solomon is greatly despised and scorned through the worlde, as do the wise and faithful seruants of God know and feele. For there is no people in the world how wicked soeuer they are, that are so much dishono∣red as they, and so cruelly persecuted: yet ought they not to bee a∣fraide, but to reioyce: for therein they are compaignions with the Prophets and Apostles, yea euen with our Lord. And what trouble soeuer they suffer, they must take good heede from making Solo∣mon a lier: but their lippes must alwaies be founde with wisedome. The wise and faithful Ministers doe labour diligently to doe this: but most often they speake vnto the walles and pillers, and most commonly they haue very smal auditory. Whereuppon followeth that there are many lewde of harte, the which do rather deserue to haue the rod on their backe, & to bee sharply corrected,
then to be receiued and counted wise, and to be admitted into the number of the houshold people and children of God. 14 Wise men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a present destruction. As a wise and discreete housholder which is prouident, or as a diligent and faithful Steward doeth not cast away and despise that which is profitable and necessarie for to mainteine his housholde, but heapeth and gathereth together his prouision, layeth it vp safe∣ly, and locketh it vp, to vse the same in time, and to distribute it vn∣to his houshold as they haue need, and doeth not spare it, least it shoulde wast: euen so the wise man and discreete, doeth not reiecte and contemne knowledge, the which is a necessarie prouision, but doeth labour to increase and to augment in the same, and doeth not suffer it to passe & vanish away, but taketh heede least it scape from him, and doeth shut it vp close with himselfe by holy meditations in the worde, wherein hee hath al his delight, and also al his hope. And albeit that he doeth locke it and shut it vp as in a garner or in a seller, yet is it not to the ende, but to make his neighbours which haue neede, parteners therof: but as the good treasure of his heart doeth abounde, euen so doeth he drawe good thinges out thereof, for to giue spiritual nourishment in time vnto the houshold of his Lorde. Solomon doeth somewhat signifie this same, when he saith, That wise men laye vp knowledge: but more plainly, when he said, verse 13. That wisedome is, or shalbe founde in the lippes of him that hath vnderstanding. They that are thus wise, are worthie to be honoured, and to be preserued from danger and destruction, and to be exempted from al hurt, and that no man should doe them any e∣uil: Solomon doeth signifie it, when setting the foole against the wise, hee sayeth, But the mouth of the foole is a present destructi∣on. The foole hath no knowledge, hee can not discerne betweene that which is to be spoken, and that, that is to be kept secrete: for so farre is he of from laying vp of knowledge, that rather hee scor∣neth it, and casteth it away, and persecuteth it: and therefore he cannot speake but foolishly, vainly, iniuriously, and wickedly: wher∣vpon foloweth his destruction sooner then he weeneth & woldeth.
Solomon doeth declare it, by the destruction neere to his mouth: as if hee said, that the foole by his vaine babbling, by his folish coun∣sels and outragious wordes, doeth call and pull destruction vppon himselfe. Nowe forasmuche as there is no man of sounde iudgement that seeketh his owne hurt, but that euery one doeth desire to profite, & to bee at ease, Solomon doeth exhort vs to bee carefull too learne knowledge, and to keepe it, and rather to bee ready to holde our peace for to heare and to learne, that wee may grow and increase in discretion and true knowledge, then rashly and amasedly to speake. Our Lorde doth teache vs the very same, saying, But I say vnto you Mat. 12. 36 that of euery idle worde that men shall speake, they shall giue an account thereof at the day of iudgement. Let euery man bee swift to heare, and slowe to speake. Therefore it is very meete that in Iam. 1. 19. all our life, we vse our tongue soberly, that wee bee not bablers, ha∣stie and rashe in our wordes. And chiefly when wee take in hande to teache Christian religion, we must take very good heede least we preach any doctrine whereby we may hurt the faith of any man. Be not hastie with thy mouth and let not thine heart speake any thing rashly before God. &c. Let vs also learne in this place, that the Eccle. 5. 1 schoole doctours do send the people to ruine and destruction, when they forbid the common people to reade the holy Scripture, (which is our true knowledge) and woulde haue them to remaine in igno∣rance. For it followeth wel, seeing Solomon setteth the laying vp of knowledge against present destruction, that they which are without knowledge, and make no account thereof, must needes suffer vnre∣couerable lostes wherewith God threateneth the people of Israel, saying, My people perishe, because they haue no knowledge. And al∣beit that the Preachers doe dayly labour to withdrawe vs from this Ose. 5. 4. 6 danger by the preaching of the worde of trueth, yet doe they pro∣fite very little: so that wee may iustly make this complaint, There Ose. 5. 1. is no trueth, ther is no mercy, there is no knowledge of God in the lande. Let vs note also that when Solomon saith, That destruction is present, or at hande, or neere the mouth of the foole, hee sheweth vs that in vaine the wicked doe promise themselues victory and Lordship, saying, With our tongue wee wil preuaile. For as Solo∣mon Psal. 12. 5. affirmeth, the punishment shal not be long defferred after the
wordes of the foole. Also the Psalmist saith, Helpe Lorde for the faithfull are diminished frō among the children of men. Wherfore Psal. 12. let vs take heede to leane to the iudgement of our eyes, and to the sense of our fleshe for they iudge cleane contrary to this threatning that Solomon maketh heere. After the outward apparance, there are none better welcome then they which speake euil: and suche as lay vp knowledge, are refused as the plague. 15 The rich mans goods, are his strong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore. Let vs not thinke that all the sentences of Solomon doe ex∣pressely conteine commandementes which ought too bee obeied: or doctrine that wee ought to follow: but let vs knowe that some of his sentences doe describe vnto vs the affections and thoughtes and the maners of worldly & carnall men, which are not renued by the holy Ghost, and walke after the lustes of the fleshe: and so doth paint foorth the thinges which happen, and are dayly doone in the worlde. For the number of the worldlinges and carnall, is with∣out comparison greater then the number of the children of God which are regenerated by the holy Ghost. Such sentences are not vnprofitable, but fruitefull: for they are set foorth for to aduertise vs of the manners of the worlde, and that by the knowledge of them, we should not conforme ourselues like vnto them, but shold labour to bee transfourmed by the renewing of our mindes. And so they conteine closely good and necessary doctrine. Wee haue heere a sentence of the same kinde, the which doth describe the ma∣ners of the riche worldlinges, and of the poore sort which haue not their hope in God, but doe either trust or tremble according too that they see with their outwarde eye. First of all Solomon com∣pareth the worldly rich man, that doeth trust in his goodes and ri∣ches, vnto a man which dwelleth in a Citie inuincible, & which cannot bee taken and wonne: hee feareth none euill that shoulde happen vnto him, albeit that the strong and mightie enimies with a great number, doe besiege and assault the Towne, and doe striue what they can to ouerthrowe and destroy all, and to set all on fire and blood: hee mocketh at his enimies, hee passeth not a Figge
nor philippe for them, and setteth them at nought. If hee hath hurte his enemies, hee feareth not for their reuengement. The worldly riche man esteemeth his goods as a strong citie, hee tru∣steth in his riches, hee thinketh nothing can hurte him, and that by them hee shal surmount and ouercome al encombrances: be∣cause of them hee swelleth and becommeth proude: hee is so arro∣gant and high minded that hee careth neither for GOD nor men. Psal. 10. 2. Psal. 10. 4. Ps. 37. 16. & 35 The vngodly for his owne lust doth persecute the poore. Againe, The vngodly is so proude that he careth not for GOD, neither is GOD in all his thoughts. A smal thing that the righteous hath is better then great riches of the vngodly. Againe, I my selfe haue seene the vngodly in great power, and florishing like a greene bay tree I went by, and loe, he was gone: I sought him, but his place coulde no where bee founde. The ouerthrowe of Sodome, the de∣struction of the nations at the entring in of the children of Israel into the Land of Canaan, the taking of the Citie of Babylon, and o∣ther discomfitures doe shewe vs that the riche doe deceiue them∣selues, trusting in their riches, and waxing proude because of them, when they ought to weepe: and chiefly when they abuse them. For they cannot but looke for al miserie, ruine and destruction: as Saint Iam. 5. 1. Iames doeth shewe saying, Goe too nowe yee riche men weepe and houle on your wretchednes that shal come vppon you. Your riches is corrupt, your garmentes are motheaten. Your golde and siluer are cankered, and the rust of them shalbee witnesse vnto you, and shal eate your flesh as it were fire. And therefore our Lorde doeth Luke. 12. 15. admonish vs, to take heede and beware of couetousnesse. For no mans life standeth in the abundance of the things which he posses∣seth. Hee sheweth vs also how we must vse our riches, saying, make you friends of the vnrighteous mammon, that when yee shal haue Luke. 16▪ 9. 1. Tim. 6. 17. need, they may receiue you into euerlasting habitatiōs. And S. Paul saith, charge thē which are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor thrust in vncertaine riches, but in the liuing GOD, (which giueth vs abundantly al things to enioy thē:) that they doe good, that they be rich in good works, that they be readie to giue, & gladly to distribute, laying vp in store for them a good foundation against the tyme to come, that they may obteine eternal life.
Albeeit then that Solomon doeth not giue vs heere expresse com∣mandement that wee shoulde not trust nor delite ourselues in our riches: yet ought we to vnderstand it, when he describeth the man∣ners, and expresseth the thoughtes of the rich, the which the Lorde doth often breake and ouerthrow: as we may plainly see it in many. Wee must also vnderstande, that by this description Solomon bla∣meth and condemneth the pride and arrogancy of the riche, their foolish trust and vaine confidence. Against the which he setteth the weaknes, the distrust and the feare of them which are not conten∣ted with the pouertie that God pleaseth to sende them, when hee saieth, but their owne poucrtie feareth the poore. Wherein hee painteth out the inwarde disposition and nature of thē which haue set their desire on riches, & cannot attaine vnto them, neither seeth any meanes to obteine thē. They are astonished and afraide, they abhorre pouertie, and doe greatly feare they shal want. They are continually tossed with such thoughtes and purposes, which doeth discourage them and make them despayre. Beholde howe the coue∣tous power, and such as haue set their hartes on riches, are affecti∣oned, & also the rich which neuer haue ynough, and feare least the earth shoulde fayle: Although Solomon counte their riches a strong citie for the worldlinges which haue not the knowledge of GOD, are neuer stayed, but haue very much feare, and neuer haue so much that they say wee haue ynough: In this sorte though they be rich yet are they poore and miserable, hauing their mindes neuer satisfied. This same is set before vs, that if riches doe abounde, wee shoulde not set our hartes vppon them to bee puft vp with pride therefore, or with vaine confidence: and if pouertie pricke vs, that wee shoulde not bee oppressed with feare nor with dispaire, but shoulde bee assured that they which doe euil, shalbee rooted out, &c. Againe, a smal thing that the righteous hath, is better then Ps. 37. 9. 16. 32 great riches of the vngodly. Againe, The steps of man are di∣rected by the Lorde. Againe, Let vs knowe, that godlinesse is 1. Timo. 6. 6. Heb. 13. 5. Iob. 1. 21. &. 2 10. great riches, if a man bee content with that hee hath. And let vs folowe that which S. Paul teacheth, let your conuersation be with∣out couetousnes. Let vs say also with Iob, Naked came I out of my moothers wombe, and al naked shal I returne thither againe.
Shall wee receiue prosperitie at the hande of God, and not receiue aduersitie also? Let vs further note also, that the opinion of the riche is false, as our Lorde doeth shewe, I tel you truely, it is very Mat. 19. 23. Luke. 12. 16. &. 16. 19. harde for a riche man to enter into the kingdome of heauen. To this purpose also apperteineth the parable of the man whose fielde brought foorth a treasure of golde, whereof hee reioyced: And of the riche glutton. 16 The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly v∣seth his encrease vnto sinne. When men occupie themselues and take some worke in hand, they seeke to profite and gaine thereby: but oftentimes they de∣ceiue themselues. For none but good people doe truely prosper in their affaires: though mans reason doe iudge the contrary. As tou∣ching the wicked, what gain soeuer they get, & what ioy soeuer they haue, yet doeth it all turne vnto their hurt. It seemeth good to out∣ward apparāce that good people are most miserable, & that ther are noone more vnhappy and cursed then they in all the worlde: but Solomon which lyeth not, doeth shewe vs their prosperitie, when hee attributeth life vnto the worke of the righteous: as if hee did say, that the iust man doth not apply himselfe vnto any worke, but vnto that which is the path way that leadeth vnto life. Contrarily, after the outward sight, the wicked reape great profite by the works they take in hande: but their destruction which is great: is at hand, vtterly to beate them downe. Solomon doth signifie the same vn∣to vs, when hee saith, that the vngodly vseth his encrease vnto sinne: For the rewarde of sinne is death. But as the worke of the righteous doth not profite himselfe alone, but doth serue to the re∣leeuing Rom. 6. 23. of others: euen so the euill manners of the wicked doe stirre vp others vnto sinne: wherevpon followeth death. And for∣asmuche as wee al desire to liue, and doe abhorre death, let vs fol∣low the worke of the righteous, let vs worship one onely God ac∣cording vnto his word, flying frō al idolatrie, & forsaking al doubt and distrust, and doing vnto our neighbours as, wee woulde they shoulde doe vnto vs. In this manner the worke of the righteous shalbe life vnto vs. And let vs not desire to bee partakers with the
vnfruitfull workes of darkenesse, which are the reuenewe of the wicked, but let vs rather reprooue them, least they be imputed vn∣to vs for sinne, whereof followeth damnation. But although wee desire life, yet doe wee not regarde to followe the workes of the righteous: for wee beleeue not, that in following it, we shoulde obteine life: seeing that as it is written, wee see by experience that the afflictions of the iust are many in number: they are exercised by many miseries and tribulations, and seeme that they are in death and that they are destitute of all helpe. Wherefore their workes' Psal. 34. 20. and sayinges are thought to bee vnprofitable. As when Saul perse∣cuted Dauid, for to destroy him, and compelled him to flie and too runne away, no man would haue thought, that what shifte soeuer hee coulde make, that hee shoulde escape the handes of Saul, and liue to become king of Israell. Likewise, when Iesus Christe was seene to hang on the crosse as a thiefe, they thought him cleane de∣stroyed: and did not thinke that hee shoulde ascende vnto the glo∣ry of his father, nor that his Gospell shoulde bee preached through all the worlde. And so their workes were not seene but to serue to life for themselues and for others. And at all times men haue iud∣ged, and still doe iudge thus of the faithfull. Contrarily, because the wicked are strong, and floorishe with glory and riches of this worlde, it seemeth that they ought to come to the end of their de∣sire, and of that they take in hande, without hinderance and let, and that none should withstand them. Pharao & his folke thought that they shoulde oppresse the people of Israell at their pleasure: but the issue and en de shewed the cleane contrary: for the people of GOD reioyced at their deliuerance, and Pharao and his peo∣ple made a miserable ende amongest the waues of the Sea. The worke of Moses and Aaron, and of such as obeied, tended to life: and Pharao with his people receiued the rewarde of sinne, that is to say, death. Thus the worke of the righteous serueth to life: for although hee fall into diuers dangers, and is many wayes pur∣sued, yet finally, and in the ende hee shalbe deliuered, and his works, his doctrine, and his counsels shall bring both himselfe and his neighbours life. Contrarily, God curseth the actions and counsels of the wicked, when he counteth, whatsoeuer they doe and say,
to bee sinne, and consequently worthie of death. This same is well described vnto vs in the first Psalme. Let vs further note, that albe∣it it is true, that the righteous doeth not labour couetously, nor to get estimatiō, but onely to imploy the time vnto good works, & to haue necessarie thinges belonging to this life, aswell for himselfe as for his family: yet Solomon his minde and intent is not such heere, as wee may knowe by the seconde part of his sentence, wherein he opposeth and setteth the reuenewe of the wicked against the worke and labor of the righteous; and sinne which bringeth death, against life. And albeit that God doeth giue vs this honour by his worde to attribute life vnto the workes and labour: yet let vs not thinke that they are worthie thereof, and deserue thereby: but let vs in any wise confesse the grace and mercy of God, which is true in his promises: for the which to fulfil, hee doeth thus rewarde our good workes whereof he himselfe is the only authour, and wee but his instrumentes and seruants. 17 He that regardeth instruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuseth correction, goeth out of the way of life. For to shewe vs the way of life, Solomon in the fourth Chapter & first verse, hath shewed vs, saying, Heare, O ye children, the in∣struction of a father, &c. And to the admonition, hath added the promise in the 4. and 6. verses. Also in the 13. verse hee repeateth a∣gaine the selfe same admonition, and thereto also hath added the promise. The saide admonition so often rehearsed, shoulde suffice to induce vs to receiue and keepe the instruction which is giuen vs by the Lorde: and aso the promise so often repeated, ought to bee suf∣ficient to assure vs of the goodnesse of GOD towards vs, and to make vs more enclined to submit ourselues vnto the good will of GOD. But wee are dull vpon the spurre, and for one admonition or twaine, we make no account to giue obedience: and for one or two promises, wee cannot bee assured of the infallible trueth of GOD: so full of rebellion and disobedience we are & so full of doubtfulnesse and distrust: and therefore wee haue neede that we should be handled according vnto our rudenesse and infirmitie. The
which our Lord doth in his holy worde, and also by the peaching of the same word, in the which one self doctrin is oftē repeted. For this cause Solomon is not negligent often to tell vs one very thing: and that which he hath already saide many times heeretofore, he repea∣teth, saying, To take heeds &c. This affirmation conteineth an in∣struction and promise: for by affirming it, he would haue vs to vn∣derstande that he doeth admonishe vs to keepe the instruction, and that hee doeth promise vs life. And therewith hee teacheth vs too knowe who is righteous and what his worke is, that serueth vnto life. Wherevpon we may gather, that hee is righteous, which with an vnfeigned heart laboureth to giue obedience vnto the worde of God, and doth wholy depend vpon the free promises of God. This is to keepe instruction, and not to labour to deserue by workes, as doe the proude Papistes: nor to thinke that faith onely without workes is enough to saluation, as doe the slouth full thinke, which loue workes already doone, and suche as desire the libertie of the flesh. For two sortes of people are out of the way of life: for the one sort are proude, and the other are vaine, and both are blinde, and de∣ceiue themselues: they thinke to be in the way of life, and they tend vnto death: they are companions of them which forsake correction, of whome Solomon saith, that they are out of the way. They do refuse to be refourmed, which make no account to amende their liues, what aduertismente soeuer is made vnto them out of the worde: but the one sort doth more slippe and slide away, murmu∣ring and despiting them which doe refourme and reprooue them. Some willing to shewe themselues holy and deuout, doe make them¦selues beleeue that they shall not faile in following of their good in∣tentes and fantasies, and the traditions and good customes of their fathers: And the other sorte which are delicate, and desire to rest in peace, doe content themselues to haue a light opinion of the Iam. 2. 19. worde, and doe cal the same faith: as doeth Saint Iames graunt them, euen suche as haue the diuels. Al such kindes of people doe refuse to be refourmed, and doe wander out of the way of life, and so runne vnto death. Wherfore forasmuch as we abhorre death, and desire life, let vs not be like vnto such folkes, but let vs take heed to instruction, and not refuse to be refourmed. For to doe this same wel let vs receiue the worde of trueth, which is the seede of life,
Let vs take al our ioy and delight therein, in obeying the comman∣dementes, of the Lorde, and by cleaning fast vnto his promises by faith, being assured of his fatherly goodnesse to wardes vs. Let vs be patient in afflictions from what side soeuer they come, knowing that it is GOD our Father and Sauiour, that doeth chasten vs, partly for to admonishe vs that wee haue offended him, and that wee shoulde returne vnto him to aske pardon, and deliue∣rance from these afflictions: partly to prooue our fayth and pa∣tience, and to make vs knowe howe weake and fraile wee be, that feeling our necessitie, wee shoulde runne vnto him for his helpe. And if wee thinke that hee differreth his helpe so long that wee should not be discouraged through dispaire: but with al patience we should looke for his helpe, the which shal not bee wanting at Esay. 30. 1. time conuenient. Thus doing, we shal keepe instruction, and shal not forsake cor∣rection, as did the children of Israel, who seeing themselues pressed with necessitie in the wildernesse, did murmure and bewaile the countrie of Egypt, and also when they were pressed with their eni∣mies, they had their refuge not vnto God, but vnto the help of men against Gods commandement. 18 He that doth dissemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth slaunder, is a foole. When one man belieth another, hee putteth himselfe in dan∣ger to beare some euil: for oftentimes hee which doeth slaunder, is mooued with anger, and is readie to stryke or to kil. It is more of∣ten seene then were needful: and albeeit that euery man is a lyer: yet is there none but desireth to bee counted true, and the greatest lyers shalbee they which wil bee most desirous to mainteine their honour, and to reuenge themselues if they bee painted such as they bee, and bee tolde to their face. Nowe forasmuch as it is so, that wee would not abide to bee called lyers, amongst other vices wee must eschue dissimulation and hypocrisie, we must take heede to faine to loue thē whome we hate, otherwise we belie the holy Ghost which speaketh by the mouth of Solomon: and further we doe resemble Iudas, which by a kisse and fained salutation betraied the inno∣cent
blood. Also when they which hate their neighbours, dissem∣ble the hatred by faire woordes, and goodly shew, they are lyers, and consequently murtherers. And thus Solomon doeth expresse but one parte of their style, attributing vnto them false and lying lippes: but he doth not expresse so smal thing but that hee accuseth them of a crime worthy of death. Thou shalt destroy them which speake leasing. But albeit to auoide lying and treason, wee must not Psal. 5. 7. dissemble hatred, yet is it not to say, that it is laweful to speake euill of our neighbour, when wee hate him. It is the parte of fooles to babble out what they haue in their harte against their neighbours. Solomon doeth signifie it, saying, And hee that speaketh, &c. They which are so readie to slaunder their neighbours, whither it bee wrongfully or that they haue some occasion, are as much, or more guiltie then they which dissemble. For first of al they are led with hatred by so speaking, which is equal with murther, or at the least by such hatred men are stirred vp thereunto. Whosoeuer is angrie with his brother vnaduisedly, shalbee woorthy of iudge∣ment. Mat. 5. 22. Secondly, they slaunder most often, not caring what they say, so that they may doe iniurie to their neighbours, and hurte their good name in belying them falsly against their con∣science: so much are they kindled with anger and with euil affecti∣on. Thirdly, no thanke to them that their neighbours, whome they blame, are not hurte both in their bodies and in their goods. And therefore, when Solomon calleth such slaunderers, fooles, wee must not vnderstande that hee speaketh of the simple and idi∣otes, which vtter whatsoeuer comes in their mouth, without good consideration of that which they speake and promise: but hee speaketh of them which through disdaine of wisedome, of correction and counsel, and through hatred that they haue to their neighbours, doe maliciously speake, and do lye by slaun∣dering wittingly. Such are wicked fooles, and doe wel deserue to bee called fooles, for they are destitute of wisedome and vn∣derstanding. These are of the number of them that wisedome re∣prooueth and threateneth, in the first chapter and 22. verse. But when Solomon doeth accuse him that doeth dissemble hatred of lying and falshoode, it is not to say that it is lawefull for vs too shewe vnto our neighbours that wee hate them, but rather wee
must learne to purge and clense vs of al wrath and indignation, displeasure, enuie malice and of al desire to hurte our neighbours, to the ende that wee may speake truly to our neighbours without deceipt and without fraude, and that wee shoulde eschue the accusation of lying whereunto Saint Paule doeth admonishe vs: Cast of the olde man, which is corrupt through the deceiuable Ephe. 4. 22. & 29. lustes. Again, Let no corrupt communication proceede out of your mouthes: but that which is good, to the vse of edifying, that it may minister grace vnto the hearers. But now put ye away euen al these things, wrath, anger, maliciousnes, cursed and filthy speaking out of your mouthes. Likewise though that Solomon calleth him foole which slaun∣dereth, yet it is not to say that the Pastours and ministers of the Collo. 3. 8. woorde ought to abstaine from blaming and reproouing of vices and of them that are hardened therein: otherwise they shoulde de∣serue to bee called fooles. Noe the embassadour of righteousnes, by the building of the arke condemned the worlde. Moyses the seruant and Prophet of the Lorde did reprooue the people of Is∣rael for their disobedience. The Prophets haue reprooued in diuers sortes. Wee may see howe our Lorde Iesus hath shewed himselfe sharpe in chiding and rebuking the Scribes and Pharisees. Saint Paule also, and Saint Peter, and Saint Iames, and Saint Iude do re∣proue and openly blame them which resist the truth, and lead a dis∣solute and slaunderous life. And our Lord commandeth the vncor∣rigible to be put ouer vnto the Church: the which cannot be with∣out rebuking them of their vices wherein they are obstinate and indurate: it shoulde be very rashly done of vs, if for the saying of Solomon we should cal al these same and other which folow them, fooles: wee shoulde depraue the scripture, the which calleth them fooles which through hatred do rebuke their neighbours, and not them which by their reprehensions, threates and accusations, doe labour to reduce the strayed sheepe. 19 In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wise. They that haue a tongue at large to speake readily, delight
much to speake, and take pleasure also in their eloquence: they mocke at them which are slowe and dul of speache: esteeming them of no witte: and whiles they prate at pleasure, they woulde bee counted wittie and learned, and doe thinke themselues cunning folke. And by howe much as a man is more vaine in his woordes, by so much the more doeth hee desire to bee accounted of them, which heare him, albeeit hee knowe that his wordes bring no pro∣fit nor edification. And also the common people is easie to haue them in estimation which flowe in eloquence, and doe thinke al wel saide that such people say: but such tongue men doe faile, and those which heare them are deceiued. Solomon doth signifie the same, when he saith, Where much, &c. And forasmuch as al vices are to bee fled, wee must take heede that wee vse our tongues soberly in priuate communication, and to giue ourselues to iest and to babble at pleasure. And therein to cō∣sume much time vnprofitably, as doe ydle and curious folkes, and chiefly maydes and wiues. Beeing ydle, they learne to goe from 1. Tim. 5. 13. house to house. The keepers of Tauerns, which spende the goods of God in gluttonie and drunkennes, and the common players are stuft with many woordes, not only vaine and vnfruiteful, but hurt∣ful and iniurious, and also ful of horrible blasphemies. Marchants & handicraftes men, and almost as many as haue entercourse or any thing to breake vnto their neighbours, or lawiers and suters, wil not briefly tel and plainly declare the trueth of the matter: but to blind & dasel mens eyes, they wil haue trickes and knackes in their budget worthy to be mocked at, and to astonishe the eares of men, they wil flowe in superfluous and vngodly wordes, with lying, per∣iurie, slaundering, with cursing and giuing themselues vnto the De∣uil, euen to the renouncing and forsaking of God: and as they themselues doe, so doe they teache their children and housholde folkes to doe the like. Wee haue experience then in diuers wayes, and more then were needful, that there is vice & offence in many wordes. And if for to auoide to be guiltie of this vice, wee must bee fober and discreete in our common & housholde talke, when wee commen and conferre togither of things which concerne & touche this present life: by a more stronger reason wee must bee well
aduised to place our wordes, and to talke no vncomely thing, when wee treate of matters concerning GOD, and which concerne the honour and glorie of GOD, and the saluation of our soules: as when wee take in hande to teache the people, when wee make our prayers vnto GOD, when wee giue him thankes and sing prai∣ses vnto him, then must wee take heede to vse many woordes, o∣therwise wee shoulde commit a vice, for the which wee shoulde not goe vnpunished: and that for good cause, when by such vice GOD is greatly dishonored, and wee and our neighbours both in danger of loosing our soules. Wherefore wee ought to vnder∣stand that it is necessarie to flye & abhorre the custome of the grea∣test parte of the worlde, the which is replenished with false tea∣chers, deceiuers, idolaters, with superstitious, with dreamers and hypocrites, the which abounde in woordes: the one sorte in hurt∣ful talke, and the other in vnprofitable, vaine and superfluous talke. Our Lorde doeth shewe vs wel that wee must not beleeue nor fo∣lowe them. Take heede and beware of the leauen of the Pharisees and Saducees. Their doctrine is very hurtful. Wo therefore bee vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because yee shutte vp Math. 19. 6. Mat. 23. 13. &. 24. 4. 11. the kingdome of heauen before men. Take heede that no man de∣ceiue you. Againe, And many false Prophetes shal arise, and shall deceiue many. Nowe I beseeche you brethren, marke them dili∣gently which cause diuision and offences, contrary to the doctrine Rom. 16. 17. Mat. 6. 5. which yee haue learned. And when thou prayest, bee not as the hy∣pocrites: for they loue to stande, and pray in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the streetes, because they woulde bee seene of men. Al such kinde of people ought to bee eschued and fled, except wee wil declare ourselues to be blinde and beastes, as they are without vnderstanding: Let them alone, they be the blinde, leaders of the Mat. 15. 14. blinde: &c. Nowe the ende of the commandement is loue. So∣lomon doeth also partly signifie it, when hee attributeth wisedome and vnderstanding vnto him which taketh heede of talking, saying, but he that refrayneth his lips, is wise. Wee must therefore (to eschue vice, and to shewe ourselues wise,) be sober in talke, and that we vtter not al things that come into our thought. Yet notwith∣standing wee must not spare our tongues when neede is, but must vnfolde them for the glorie and honour of GOD, and for
the profit and edification of our neighbours. Wee see in the ho∣ly scriptures, that the seruantes of GOD haue abounded with woordes in their sermons, praises, and praiers and thankes giuing, and no faulte nor vice hath beene in them. For as wise men, they knewe to refraine their lippes, speaking nothing but that wherwith they were diuinely inspired by the spirit of the Lorde. 20 The tongue of the iust man, is fined siluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth. Solomon doeth compare the tongue of the righteous vnto the pure siluer, vnto the siluer that is separated from al matter that may hinder the knowledge of his goodnesse and preciousnesse, when it is mineral, and hath not passed through the fire. It is not with∣out cause that hee maketh this comparison: for as men doe na∣turally desire such kinde of siluer, euen so the tongue of the righ∣teous is greatly to bee desired of them which loue the true riches which proceede from wisedome and innocencie, For the mouth of the righteous wil talke of wisedome, and his tongue shal de∣clare that which is right. And also, Blessed is the man that findeth Psal. 37. 30. wisedome, and the man that vttereth knowledge. And as the pure siluer is carefully kept, and is not gladly imployed indifferently to al vses: euen so the righteous, because hee is wise, refraineth his lips, and doeth not vnfolde his tongue for euery matter: but as the pre∣cious siluer is not imployed, but when it is very needful, or about things of greate importance, or there where a man wil be seene and get reputation: euen so the righteous taketh heede to imploy wel his tongue vnto the glory of GOD, and instruction of his neigh∣bours, and not to offende thereby, wherewith hee winneth reputa∣tion, and is greatly esteemed of the faythful which haue know∣ledge of the trueth. Contrarily, hee compareth the harte of the wicked vnto nothing, or litle woorth: and that rightly. For as wee doe naturally desire aboundance of thinges that wee thinke to bee necessarie and profitable, and doe disdaine and refuse that which serueth for nothing, or is litle woorth: euen so although that the
vngodly doe praise and boast themselues, and that their harte is haughtie & sowln, & that they iudge that they ought to be praised: yet God who knoweth the hartes, doeth wel see that there is no∣thing in the hart of the vngodly that is any thing woorth, & ther∣fore doeth he disdaine them, and doeth abhorre them, so doe they also that are led by the spirit of God. For by the outward things, is the vanitie of the hart knowne. And as wee are wont not to spare the thinges that are nothing esteemed, or smally, but leaue them at randon, euen so the wicked do vnfolde in euery matter the vanitie of their hart, and care not what they doe, nor what they say: they haue no right thoughtes: whervpon foloweth that their hart is nothing woorth, and that they cannot do nor say any thing that is ought woorth. Naturally wee are al such, and haue neede that GOD by his holy spirit shoulde purge, amende, and renewe our hartes, otherwise our tongues, which from the aboundance of the heart doe speake, shal not bee as pure and tried siluer, but our vaine and vnprofitable heartes shal spurre forewarde our tongues to speake things nothing woorth, and the rest of our members to doe vnprofitable and hurtful thinges. If wee haue desire that God shoulde woorke in vs by his holy spirit, wee must bee attentiue vn∣to his woorde. For as the woordes of the Lorde are called pure Psalm. 12. 7. as the siluer which from the earth is tryed and purified seuen times in the fire: euen so the lawe of the Lorde is saide to bee vndefiled. Wherefore besides the former expositions we may say, that as there is no deceite in fine siluer, but that it is true and tryed, neither may Psalm. 19. 8. any man deny to receiue and imploy it: euen so the righteous in∣structed and taught in the pure and cleane woorde of GOD, the which doth not deceiue thē that put their trust therein, haue a pure & cleane tongue, neither is their fraude in his mouth, but speaketh the truth from his hart, and that freely. Contrarily, as by a thing of nothing which hath some faire shewe, the vndiscreete are decei∣ued, euen so the vngodly doe inuent nothing but deceite and hurt against their neighbours. And as the iust which by his tongue seeketh nothing but the glorie and honour of God, and the edifica∣tion of his Church, ought to be heard and receiued, and his sayings obeyed, as if God himselfe did speake: euen so ought wee to bee
careful to take heed of the wicked, and chiefly of the ministers of Sa∣than which doe change themselues like ministers of light, and doe labour but to seduce the hartes of the innocentes. For other de∣ceiptes can bring no hurte but to the temporal goods or to the bo∣dies: but the ministers of Sathan destroy for euer both the bodies and soules of so many as beleeue and reuerence them, and followe their doctrine. This last exposition agreeth wel with the sentence that foloweth, when Solomon saith, 21 The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles shal die for want of wisedome. In what state soeuer wee be, if wee bee righteous, we wil labour to hurte no man by our woordes, but wil delite to speake trueth, and by the same to profit many, in giuing good counsel, in exhor∣ting, admonishing, rebuking, reproouing and correcting. This trueth is the foode of life, the vncorruptible seede which quicke∣neth a man for euer. For man liueth not only by bread, but by euery woorde that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Likewise the Gospel, which is the infallible trueth, is compared vnto a wedding, Deut. 8. 3. vnto the which many bee called. And the ministers which declare this Gospel are called Pastors: and in the person of Saint Peter Ie∣sus Christ commandeth them to feed his sheepe: And, somuch as in Iohn. 21. 15. 1. Pet. 5. 2. Actes. 20. 28 you lyeth, feede the flocke of Christ. Take heede to yourselues and to al the flocke, wherof the holy Ghost hath made you ouerseeers. And as the Ministers of the Churche by their preaching doe feede the beleeuers vnto eternal life (for the Gospel is the power of God to saue al them that beleeue) euen so those Princes and superiours which pronounce good, iust and vpright, sentences, for to giue right vnto him that it belongeth vnto, and doe diligently watche ouer the slaunders and offences, proclaming holy ordinances for to esta∣blish a sounde ecclesiastical pollicie, doe feede many so much as in them is: euen so doe al heads of housholde, when no euil woorde doth proceed out of their mouth, but doe speake very wisely and godly. And as through them many are fed and quickened, euen so also they feede themselues, and deliuer themselues from death.
But they that are so colde and faintharted, that they despyse al honestie and holy religion, and care not though they offende and destroye their neighbours: as by their wicked woordes pro∣ceeding from the weakenesse and fayntnesse of hart they leade many vnto death, feeding them with poyson so much as lyeth in them: so also shal not they bee spared, but by the iust vengeance of GOD they shal dye, as they deserue. These are the fooles whereof Solomon saieth that they shal dye through their owne fol∣lie. 22 The blessing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no sorrowes with it. Euery man naturally desireth to bee riche and to abounde with temporal goods, not onely for to mainteine this life in a meane e∣state: but also to nourishe himselfe in pleasures and voluptuous∣nesse, to keepe greate cheere and to bee apparelled sumptuously, and to bee magnified and exhalted, and to enioy in this worlde all plea∣sures that are possible. And to the ende to attaine theretoo, wee la∣bour with body and soule, wee bestowe our bodily labour, and set al our minde on woorke to see and consider howe we may become riche. And because wee commonly see that fooles and ydiottes, the negligent and slouthful the faint and weake to bee poore, and that they haue greate neede, it seemeth that man by his wisedome and pollicie, by his force and strength, by his labour and trauaile doth be∣come riche. For this cause man doeth attribute vnto his power the goods and riches that he possesseth, and thinketh that they are due vnto him and that hee hath wel deserued them. But in it there is nothing but vanitie without any profit. I made gorgious and faire woorkes, saieth Solomon in Ecclesiastes the second chapter, &c. But when I considered all the woorkes that my handes had Eccle. 2. 4. wrought, and al the labour that I had taken therein: loe, al was but vanitie and vexation of minde: for in this sorte man doeth not ac∣knowledge GOD as it behooueth. When hee seeth him∣selfe to abounde in riches, hee ought not to bee like vnto swine which alwaies haue their snout in the grounde til they finde a∣cornes, & looke not vp from whence they falto the grounde: but he
ought to lift vp the eyes of his minde, and to beholde the heauen, and to confesse that the goods he hath, though he haue found them in earth, and are brought out of the earth: yet that they descended from heauen, and are giuen vnto him of the meere liberalitie of God, who maketh al things to growe for the vse of man. GOD saide, Let the earth bring foorth greene hearbe, &c. Againe, He Gen. 1. 11. 28. &. 9. 3. &. 14. 20. Gen. 18. 3. blessed them, and saide, growe and increase, &c. And I haue giuen euery greene thing to be meate vnto you, &c. The holie Patriarks haue wel acknowledged this power and liberalitie. Abraham did wel shewe it when he gaue tithes, and would not be enriched with the goods of the Sodomites, and when hee receiued the Angelles & 28. 20. and intreated them gently. It is also saide of Iacob that hee made a vowe, saying, If the Lorde wil be with mee, and keepe me in my iourney which I goe, and wil giue me bread to eate, and cloathes to put on, so that I come againe vnto my fathers house in safetie, then shal the Lorde be my God, &c. Againe he himselfe sayth: O God of my Father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac: Lorde which & 32 9. sayeth vnto mee, Returne vnto thy countrey, and to thy kindred, and I wil doe al wel with thee, &c. The Lorde is he that killeth and maketh aliue againe. Nowe also Solomon doeth confesse it, when 1. Sam. 2. 6. hee sayeth, That the blessing of the Lorde maketh riche, &c. If any man then be riche, the same commeth, because God hath ex∣tended his blessing vpon him. Thus riches ought not to bee at∣tributed either to the labour, or wisedome, or industrie or diligence and care of men, either to fortune or chance by aduenture, as doe the infidels: but we shoulde acknowledge and confesse that as God Psal. 24. 1. is the Creatour both of heauen and of earth, and of al thinges in them conteined, and that the earth with the contentes ther of doth appertaine vnto him, euen so hee distributeth the thinges of this worlde as hee pleaseth, and to whome hee pleaseth. After that he hath made a man riche, at his pleasure hee taketh away the same a∣gaine, and maketh him poore, and giueth it vnto another. Iob saieth in his first chapter, The Lorde hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken: and that which was taken from him, was to make theeues and robbers riche. In this sorte we confesse that God not only bles∣seth the faithful and iust, but also the wicked and vnthankeful: as
saieth our Lorde, hee maketh the Sunne to rise both vpon the good and badde. But hee doeth this, partly to make himselfe knowne, Mat. 5. 45. howe hee hath not left himselfe without witnesse of dooing vs good. &c. And this is also to the ende to take away excuse from the vn∣thankeful. Act. 14. 17. Rom. 1. 18. For the wrath of God is reuealed from heauen against al vngodlinesse, and vnrighteousnesse of men, which with holde the trueth invnrighteousnesse. Secondly, to the ende that the chil∣dren Mat. 5. 44. of God shoulde folowe their Father in wel doing to their ene∣mies. Thirdly, that the elect of God seeing and beholding the great benefits that the Lorde poureth vpon the wicked, and comparing their afflictions with them, they should learne howe they ought to hope for a much better life then haue the most blessed of this world, otherwise the state of Gods children shoulde bee woorse then the same of the wicked. Wherfore, the confiscations & forfeitures that the tyrantes make nowe adaies, should rather reioyce the afflicted, Mat. 5. 11. I am. 1. 2. then grieue and vexe them. Thus, albeeit the tyrants, do persecute bannishe, steale and pilfer from the children of GOD, and that God doeth so suffer them, yea that hee hath so ordeined, yet is it not to say that God hath depriued his children of his blessing. For Rom. 8. 31. 1. Cor. 10. 13. what temptation soeuer hee sendeth vnto his housholde folkes and children, yet doeth hee not cease to loue them, If God be on our side, who shalbe against vs? God is faithful which wil not suffer you to be tempted aboue that you be able, but wil euen giue the issue with the temptation, that yee may be able to be are it. Let vs therfore vnderstand that God noth neuer so spoile his chil∣dren, but that hee leaueth them sufficient goods. For, a smal thing that the righteous hath, is better then great riches of the vngodlie. Also they which haue their hope in the Lord, as they are not forsakē Psal. 37. 16. of him, (as it is written in the former psalme, I haue bin yong and nowe olde, yet saw I neuer the righteous forsaken, nor his seed beg∣ging their bread &c.) so doe they acknowledge, & trulie confesse the blessing of God by beeing contented, and thinking themselues riche ynough. The which contentation they shewe by not stealing, but doing good vnto their neighbours. For as it is said a litle after, The righteous is euer merciful, and lendeth, and his seed is blessed. Psalm. 37. 26.
Nowe the blessing of God vpon the faithful, is not much seene vn∣to the eyes: for they seeme to bee most miserable of any in all the worlde: but what euil or pouertie soeuer happen vnto them, their state is farre more better then the same of the most richest which are not stayed vpon the Lorde. For the vnfaithful are possessours of an euil faith: albeeit that by the blessing of GOD they are riche, and doe enioy goods, not knowing from whence they proceede, and doe vse them without the promise of GOD: And because they vsurpe the goods that belong not vnto them, they shal ere it bee long and sooner then they thinke for, bee depriued of this temporal benediction. For the wicked dooers shalbe rooted out: and which is farre woorse, they shal in no wise bee partakers Psa. 37. 9. of this precious blessing of the kingdome of heauen, and of e∣ternal life. As for the transgressours, they shal perishe toge∣ther, Psa. 37. 38. and the ende of the vngodly, is, they shalbee rooted out at the last. Likewise they whome GOD iudgeth not woorthy of the temporal promises, cannot looke for any other felicitie then that they haue in this life. But the faythful which haue the promise of this present life, doe knowe that what pouertie soe∣uer they suffer in this worlde, yet they are riche ynough: for they are Lordes of al the worlde, though they doe not visibly enioy them. For they vnderstande wel that the promise is not made vntoo them to holde and staye their mindes vppon these vaine and transitory thinges: but to the ende that with al their harte they shoulde aspire after the heauenly riches, which shal endure eter∣nally. And also to leade them theretoo the Lorde doeth not suffer them to liue at their ease, in pleasures and carnal delights af∣ter the lustes thereof, but most often hee doeth compasse them with greate and many afflictions. Notwithstanding, GOD cea∣seth not to performe his promise, giuing them worldly substance, so much as is necessarie for their spiritual and eternal saluation, the which cannot faile them, seeing they are owners and heires by the promise. The olde and auncient fathers did thus vnderstande Heb. 11. 13. it. Wherefore the faythful beeing poore and miserable in the eyes of men, doe not cease to bee riche by the blessing of the Lord, whereby they shal receiue the crowne of glorie.
And forasmuch as it is so that the blessing of the Lorde maketh men rich: Let vs first of all knowe, that wee possesse nothing, howe small soeuer it bee, but that wee must giue thankes vnto God for the same. Dauid in his 34. Psalme doeth point vs the way: and Saint Paule doeth admonish vs, that we shoulde geue thanke for al thinges. Secondly, forasmuche as there proceedeth no euill thing from the blessing of God, it followeth that riches are good, and that it is lawful to possesse them, and to vse them with ioy and gladnesse. For euery creature of God is good, and nothing ought 1. Tim. 4. 4. to bee refused, if it bee receiued with thankes giuing. Neuerthe∣lesse we must take heed to abuse the blessing of God. And for to ob∣serue this, we must loke that we possesse nothing vniustly gottē, least wee bee like vnto theeues, robbers, rouers, couetous vsurers, and false packing merchantes: but in steede of spoyling and catching, let vs distribute parte of that which wee possesse, and that wee walke vprightly and faithfully in all our affaires: and for to come well to the ende heereof, wee must followe the counsell of the Psal∣mist. O trust not in wrong and robbery, giue not yourselues vn∣to Psal. 62. 11. vanitie: If riches increase, set not your heart vpon them. For if wee set not our harts vpon riches, we do not possesse thē as the blessing of the Lorde: and for our vnthankefulnesse wee depriue ourselues of the heauenly and euerlasting blessing. Howe hardly shal a rich man enter into the kingdome of heauen? They that will Mar. 10. 23. 1. Timo. 6. 9. bee riche, fall into temptation and snares, and into many foolishe, and noysome lustes, which drowne men in perdition and destructi∣on. Wee must also looke that wee vse not the riches of God dis∣solutely and vntemperately, as doe the gluttons and drunkardes, braue and prodigall Gentlemen, which cannot soberly and tempe∣rately reioyce, but haue a beastly and arrogant ioy: but wee must vse them, reioycing ourselues in the presence of the Lorde. For to doe this well, wee must not eate so muche meate, nor exceede Leu. 23. in costly and gorgeous apparrell, but that wee shoulde thinke on the needie, and chiefly on the housholde of faith. For if to bee like vnto our heauenly father, wee ought too doe good vnto our enimies, by a more strong reason wee must bee carefull of them which doe loue vs in Iesus Christe, and to spare the morsell out of
our owne mouth for to giue it them, and to doe with a good heart and free wil. Thus wee must reioyce in vsing the blessing of the Lorde. Thirdly, forasmuche as the blessing maketh riche, it fol∣loweth that wee may aske riches of God, so farre as is needeful to helpe our necessitie. Our Lorde doeth teach it vs, when hee would haue vs to aske our dayly bread. But also wee must consider that Mat. 6. 11. when hee addeth, This day, hee woulde not that wee shoulde de∣sire to become riche, but as Saint Paule doeth teach vs, that hauing 1. Tim. 6. 8. Heb. 23. 5. meate and clothing, we shoulde bee therewith content. Let your conuersation be without couetousnesse, being contented with that which you haue already. Albeit then that it is lawful for vs to aske riches of God, which may suffice to keepe vs in this life, that ha∣uing thinges necessary for vs, wee may the better followe our vo∣cation: yet is it not laweful for vs to couet riches, as hath beene al∣ready alledged. For take heede, and beware of couetousnesse, Luke. 12. 14. saith the Lorde. Fourthly, let vs knowe, that it is not in the po∣wer of man to make himselfe riche, but that he must receiue al from the gracious and liberall hande of God. And if man cannot do the lesser, he hath no power to doe the greater. Wherevpon followeth that it is not in the power of man to make himselfe riche with spi∣ritual riches, which serue to preserue the soule, & make it to obtein eternall life. It is not then in mans owne power to come vntoo the kingdome of heauen. Beholde what wee must learne, when Solomon doeth say vnto vs, that the blessing of the Lorde maketh men riche. And let vs also learne that if God blesse vs, that ac∣cording to his liberalitie and blessing bestowed vpon vs, wee must blesse our needy neighbours by doing good vnto them. Charge them that are riche in this worlde, that they bee not high min∣ded, and that they trust not in vncertaine riches, but in the li∣uing GOD, (which giueth aboundantly all thinges to enioy.) That they doe good and bee riche in good workes, and ready to 1. Tim. 6. 17 distribute, & communicate. That which we distribute to the poore, S. Paul calleth it a blessing or a beneuolence: wherefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to come before vnto you, and 2. Cor. 9. 5. to finishe your beneuolence appointed afore, that it might be ready, & come as of beneuolence, & not as of niggardlines. Thervpon So∣lomō
doth say, that the lord doth not giue trouble with his blessing. But at the first sight, the contrarie may seeme true: for he hath not altogither spoiled man of his blessing: and yet, though hee had sin∣ned, and had deserued to be depriued of al goodnes, the Lord hath giuen him of them abundantly: but yet hee hath saide vnto him, Be∣cause thou hast obeyed the voice of thy wife, &c. the earth shalbe Gen. 3. 17. accursed for thy sake. Hee enriched the Patriarkes the which liued not without trouble, as may be seene by the historie of their life. Hee blessed Dauid with riches, and exalted him, ordeyning him king in Israel: but before that hee attained vnto it, hee suffred very much: and after that hee was exalted, hee had much trouble, and that by the meanes of his owne blood. And our Lorde Iesus doeth not promise any riches vnto his faithful people, but with condition of persecution. And also, hee woulde that wee al shoulde beare our Mar. 10. 13. Luke. 9. 23. crosse. I answere, that the blessing of God doeth not exempt the faithful from afflictions in their flesh, and that they should not suf∣fer much trouble in this worlde: for let vs knowe that the afflicti∣ons of this present time are not woorthy of the glorie which shalbee Rom. 8. 18. shewed vnto vs, they beare them with patience and ioy, and are at peace and quietnesse in their consciences: and are assured of the goodnesse and loue of God towardes them, they say with Da∣uid, The Lorde is my sheephearde, therefore shal I want nothing. Ps. 23. 1. &. 27 1. & 34, 18. The Lorde is my light &c. When the righteous crye vnto the Lorde, hee heareth them, and doeth deliuer them out of al their troubles. Yea though hee shoulde kil mee, yet wil I put my thrust in Iob. 13. 15. him, saieth Iob. Contrarily, albeeit that the vngodly, which doe not acknow∣ledge the goodnesse and blessing of GOD, doe greatly prosper in the outwarde sight of the worlde (for it is saide that they feele no trouble, &c.) yet so much as in them lyeth, they refuse and reiect the blessing of GOD, and are also greatly troubled in their consciences, and are much vexed in their mindes: they haue no peace nor quietnesse in their vnderstanding. The wic∣ked are lyke the raging sea, which cannot rest, whose waterfometh Esay. 57. 20. with the myre and grauel. Euen so the wicked haue nopeace saith God.
23 It is pastime to a foole to do wickedly: but wisdom is vn∣derstanding to a man. When wee haue committed any faultes and offences, howe smal and litle soeuer they bee, and bee it that wee haue offended and sin∣ned by infirmitie or malice, by ignorance or of set purpose to doe euil, it is necessary wee shoulde knowe that wee haue grieuously offended, forasmuch as wee haue transgressed the lawe of our God, the which is so holy, good and iust. And vpon the knowledge herof, we must tremble and be afraid of the righteous iudgement of God, the which wee haue deserued that hee shoulde poure vpon vs and exercise against vs his wrath and anger, and that hee shoulde no whit spare vs, but damne and destroy vs: and being thus feared, that wee may bee brought to say without colour and faynednesse with Dauid, Correct mee not in thy wrath, O Lorde, nor chasten Psalw. 38. 2. mee not in thy heauie displeasure. It is also necessarie for vs that such a feare shoulde leade vs, not to a despayre, as it did Iudas, but vnto a griefe and sorrowe which may make vs hate the euil that wee haue committed, and to detest and abhorre the same. This kinde of sorrowe is very profitable and needful for vs, as S. Paule doeth declare, when hee reioyced at that, that he had made the Co∣rinthians sory, saying, I nowe reioyce, not that yee were sory, but 2. Cor. 7. 9. that yee sorowed to repentance: for yee sorowed godly, so that in nothing yee were hurt by vs: for godly sorowe causeth repentance vnto saluation, not to bee repented of: but worldly sorowe cau∣seth death. Nowe as this sorowe is healthful vnto them which re∣fuse it not euen so also the contempt therof is very dangerous. And in that day did the Lorde God of hostes cal men vnto weeping & Esay. 22. 11. mourning, to baldnesse and girding about with sacke cloth. And be∣holde they haue ioye and gladnesse, slaying oxen & killing sheepe, eating flesh, and drinking wyne. Likewise Solomon rebuketh this contempt, when hee saieth, that hee maketh but a sporte of wic∣kednes, &c. He speaketh here chiefly of faults & sinnes which haue bin much thought on, and are committed vpon set purpose: for hee vseth a word which commeth of a verbe that signifieth thoughtes.
Such faults are very greeuous and abhominable before God, bicause they proceede of very set malice, and that they which commit them, woulde doe no better, but if they coulde, they would yet more wic∣kedly. And albeit they know wel that they do euil, & that they wold not bee so serued, and that they would be ready to reuenge them∣selues if any man shoulde offend them, yet as though GOD sawe them not, they spare not to thinke and do euill. They haue no feare of God, and doe laugh euen whiles they doe euil, as if they were well assured, and as though they had made a couenaunte with death and hell. They are of the number of those that Esay speaketh of, saying: Woe bee vnto them, that drawe wickednesse vnto them with Esay. 5. 81. 19 &. 20. cordes of vanitie: and sinne as it were with a carte rope. Let the counsel of the holie one of Israel come and drawe nigh, that wee may knowe it. Woe be vnto them that cal euil good, and good euil, which make darkenesse light, and light darkenesse, that make sweete Esai. 28. 14. sowre, and sowre sweete. And therefore, heare the worde of the Lorde, ye mockers, because ye haue saide, we haue made a couenant with death, and with hell are wee at agreement. Solomon calleth such people fooles, and not without a cause. For though there were nothing but this, that they are destitute of wisdome & knowledge, they deserue to be called fooles: by a stronger reason, when they e∣steeme not wisedome, but mocke thereat, contemning and refusing it, and in so muche as in them lyeth, doe persecute it, they deserue to be called fooles. Also they are without wit, without reason, with∣out vnderstanding: the which is cause that they do nothing care to do euil, but do it, of set purpose: & for al the admonitiōs or threat∣nings that can be made vnto them, yet do they nothing but scorne, they make no more account of the woorde of God then of fables, yea and lesse also. Wherby we may iudge that they are without vnderstanding, & that they do wel deserue to be called fooles. Now that they are without vnderstanding, Solomon doth shew it, when he sayth. But wisedome ruleth the man that hath vnderstanding. Hee setteth wisdome against foolishnes, and vnderstanding against moc∣king, shewing vs that the foole hath no wisedom, and that the moc∣kers are as beastes without any knowledge: & therefore they feare
not to doe euil, and doe assure themselues in their wickednesse. A∣mongest the number of suche fooles and mockers, wee may set Caine, who after hee had slaine Abell, passed not for his fault com∣mitted: Gen. 4. 9. as wee may knowe it, by the answere hee made, when hee knewe not where his brother was, &c. And likewise, the worlde destroyed by the flood. For albeit that Noe did condemne it by the building of the Arke, yet had they no care, nor tooke no Heb. 11. 7. thought: but continued still in their wickednesse, passing the time away merily: as our Lorde doeth shewe it, saying. For as they were in the dayes before the flood, They did eate and drinke, mar∣ry, & giue in marriage vnto the day that Noe entered into the Ark, Mat. 24. 38. and they knewe nothing till the flood came, and tooke them all a∣way, &c. Sodome also: the brethren of Ioseph: Dauid also, vn∣til Gen. 18. 19. Ezc. 16. 49 Luk. 17. 28 that hee was reprooued by the Prophet Nathan. The Iewes which by enuie crucified Iesus Christ, did mocke him, saying, hee hath saued other, himselfe hee can not saue. And nowe at this day, the greatest parte of them which persecute the poore members Mat. 27. 41. of Iesus Christ, are mockers. And I woulde to God that there were none but in Poperie, &c. Wee bring foorth these examples, to the ende that wee know∣ing that of our owne corrupt nature, wee are not, neither can bee better: let vs therfore be diligent to aske of God, that he would so print his feare in our heartes, that thereby wee may renounce all carnal trust, which is but follie, and which holdeth man in giering and mocking. And that by this feare, wee might come and attaine vnto the true wisedome, the which may make vs vnderstande that wee ought not to laugh and mocke, but to bee sorie when we haue sinned: but that of a sorowful spirite and contrite harte, with al humblenesse we should aske with Dauid, Haue mercy vpon me, O God, after thy great goodnesse. &c. Ps. 51. 15. 3. 17. And to the ende that as wee vnderstande wee ought not to re∣ioyce at our wickednes, euen so also ought wee to conuert the foo∣lish, and bring thē vnto true vnderstanding. Let vs aske with Dauid. Make me a cleane hart, O God, and renewe aright spirit within me, &c. Again, O Lord open thou my lips, & my mouth shal shew forth Mat. 7. 3. Rom. 2. 1. thy praise. Otherwise, if we take in hand to correct others, wee
be hypocrites, and condemne other ourselues. And forasmuche as wisedome is vnderstanding vnto man, it is a certaine argument that we want wisdome, when we know not howe to gouerne ourselues in the feare and reuerence of the Lord: and thus we are fooles, & consequently mockers and scoffers. And if wee bee suche, wee cannot but looke for a horrible mockery: for when wee make but Psal. 2. 4. Pro. 1. 26. a mocke at sinne, and doe euil, wee scoffe at God, refusing his yoke: euen so also wil hee mocke at vs. If we desire to auoide the same let vs not tarry till the Lorde speake vnto vs in his fury: but nowe whiles hee speaketh gently vnto vs by his sonne in his Go∣spel, let vs heare him, and obey him, receiuing this holy Gospell with faith and repentance. Those that receiue it after this sorte are wise, and haue vnderstanding. Contrarily, they which de∣spise him are fooles and scoffers, as wee may see but too muche by experience. 24 The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, shall come vppon them: but the righteous shall haue their desire. It seemeth at the first sight that Solomon doth contrarie him∣selfe: for hee hath saide that the feare is as mocking. Nowe it seemeth like that the man which laugheth and leappeth for ioy, is assured and that hee feareth nothing. And also, the vngodly is so proud, that hee careth not for GOD: neither is God in all his Psal. 10.  thoughtes. And nowe hee saith, that which the vngodly feareth, &c. But no man doeth gladly laugh that feareth: for feare brin∣geth weeping, howling, carefulnesse and melancholie: and if it hap∣pen that any man in feare laugheth, it commeth not of ioy, nor of assurance they haue, but it is to labour to turne away this feare, and to diminishe the griefe that men haue conceiued. I answere, The cause why the vngodly, and a foole laugheth and mocketh when hee worketh wickednesse, is not because hee is altoge∣ther without feare and doubt, and that hee is truely assured that no hurt shall happen vnto him: hee is destitute of the promises of peace, of life, of saluation, and of all felicitie and prosperitie,
aswell of this worlde as of eternall ioy: for these promises do ap∣pertaine onely vnto the wise, and to the righteous elected. And they are the same which truely may assure and deliuer a man from feare. The assurance and safetie that the wicked labour to haue, and doe promise themselues, is not safetie, but vaine presumption and a false opinion, the which they striue to keepe still in their braines. Caine doeth strongly striue to assure himselfe after he had slaine his brother: but when hee answereth GOD, howe hee Gen. 4. 9. knoweth not where his brother is become, and that hee as∣keth if he be his brothers keeper, hee well declareth that hee is not without feare: for if he had been assured, and had feared nothing, hee woulde haue answered boldly, I haue slaine him. The reioy∣cing then of the vngodly doth not proceede of true assurance, but of that they endeuour to harden themselues and to waxe obstinate in euill, that they may cast from them al fearefulnesse, if it be possible. Likewise Lamech, albeit that he boasteth to be so strong and hardie, that though hee were hurt & may med yet in his strength he would kill a man: yet doeth hee wel declare himselfe not too bee assured, Gen. 4. 23. but afraide, when without any worde of GOD, hee threateneth him that shall kil him, with more greeuous vengeance than GOD had threatened the man that should slaye Caine. Although then that the vngodly are but too mightie and too hardy to cōmit euill, and that without remorse of conscience, with an vnbrideled de∣sire, they make horrible things, yet do they wel know they do euil, and that there can none but euill fall vpon them: and so they can not bee without al doubt and feare. Saint Paule doeth shewe it, All that haue sinned without the law, shall perishe without lawe. What ioy soeuer the vngodly haue, yet doth the same not procede Rom. 2. 12. of quietnesse and rest that they haue in their consciences. For the wicked are like the raging Sea which cannot rest. Moses also saith, Esay. 57. 20. Deut. 26. 56. vnto the contemners of the Lawe, The Lord shal giue thee a fearefull heart, and daselingeyes, and a sorowefull spirite. &c. But though the fooles and wicked doe tremble and feare, the same doeth auaile them nothing: for after they are tormented in their mindes, they cannot deliuer themselues from the mise∣ries and calamities, but fall from one to another. as saith
Solomon, that which the vngodly feareth, shall come vppon him. The builders of the towre of Babylon haue felt it. The vnbe∣leeuing and rebellious children of Israel did feare to be destroyed, if Gen. 11. 4 they went vp into the lande of promise: also the destruction fell vpon them, & were destroyed fourtie yeeres in the wildernes. Saul Num. 14. 1. feared himselfe and his house to be destroyed, & that Dauid should be king of Israel: the very which happened. To be short, the vn∣godly desire to floorish and triumphe many yeeres together, and at last doe feare destruction and damnation: the which also hapeneth Psal. 37. 9. and shal come vpon them. Wherein wee may see that the world deceiueth them which beholde him, and put their trust in him. For this cause also Saint Paul doth admonish vs, And this I say, brethrē, because the time is shorte, heereafter that both they which haue 1. Cor. 7. 29. wiues, be as though they had none: and they that weepe, as though they wept not: and they that reioyce, as though they reioyced not. &c. Againe, Saint Iohn saith, Loue not this worlde, neither the thinges that are in this worlde. If wee withdrawe and separate our¦selues 1. Iohn. 2. 15. from the worlde, which is set vpon euill, and againe that we giue ourselues to followe the feare of God, desiring too doe iustly, wee shall not be compassed with the feare of the wicked: but what aduersitie and afflictions soeuer doe assault vs, wee shall by faith o∣uercome them, the Lorde helping vs. Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lorde deliuereth them out of all. And againe, Psal. 34. 20▪ &. 145. 18. The Lorde is nigh vnto al them that call vpon him in trueth, &c. And according to the saying of Solomon, but the righteous shall haue their desire. And because that these thinges are seldome seene vnto the corporall eies, the worlde doeth laugh and mocke at this trust and hope: as the wicked are reprooued therefore. Wher∣vpon the children of God haue great neede of pacience. With Psal. 14. 6. Heb. 10. 36. Mat. 7. 7. 1. Iohn. 5. 14 these witnesses so faithful, we haue the infallible trueth which saith, Aske, and it shalbee giuen you. And this is the trust that wee haue to Godwarde, that if wee aske any thing according to his will, hee heareth vs. 25 As the storme passeth, euen so shall the vngodly va∣nishe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a strong foundation.
A storme is an horrible and feareful thing, as experience proueth, and this is partly bicause that it commeth with a great noyse vnloo∣ked for: partly because also that in smal time it maketh destruction, and bringeth great hurt euen vpon the soden. Euē so the holy scrip∣ture willing to feare the vngodly, by signifiyng vnto them soden de∣struction, doth threaten them with a storme. And the same shal come quickly, as if it were a storme, &c. Solomon compareth the wicked which is strōg & mighty, vnto a tēpest: for so much as he vt∣terly Pro 2. 27. Psal. 83. 14. Esay. 29. 5. can, he sheweth himselfe horrible and feareful vnto the poore faithful, and doeth destroy and kil them, so much as in him lyeth. Likewise the fury, violence and vehemencie of the wicked are com∣pared vnto the tempest and storme. Dauid doth shewe it, when hee prayeth, Take heede vnto mee, and heare me, howe I mourne in my Psal. 55. 2. &. 3. prayer, and am vexed. The enimie crieth so, and the vngodly com∣meth on so fast: for they are minded to doe some mischiefe, so ma∣litiously are they set against mee, &c. Againe, I woulde make hast to &. 8. escape: because of the stormie winde and tempest. Woe shalbee to the multitude of much people, which shal make a sounde like the Esay. 17. 12. noyse of the Sea. But although the vngodly bee so stormie and vio∣lent, the faithful ought not to be afraid therof. First of al, because the fiercenesse of the wicked doeth not long continue. The holy histo∣ries doe shew it, and amongest others the violence of the Egyptians agaist the children of Israel, and the furie, and vehemencie of the Iewes against Iesus Christe. The Psalme also doeth plainely de∣clare it, Yet a little while, and the vngodly shalbe cleane gone: thou shalt looke after his place, and he shalbe away. And according heere∣vnto Solomon saith heere, that the wicked shalbe like the storme Psal. 37. 10. that passeth away, or when it is past. Solomon then doth not heere compare the wicked vnto the tempest, for to make the faithful righ∣teous and innocent, afraide: but rather to the ende that the faith∣ful shoulde not feare the vngodly, seeing their violence continueth not: as Solomon doeth shewe by this comparison, wherein his chiefe intent is to comfort the poore afflicted, to the ende that they shoulde knowe that they shal not bee long vnder the raging tyran∣nie of the wicked. Iust Lot hath prooued it by experience. And Gen. 19. 24. Exo. 14. 13. Moyses sayth vnto the children of Israel. Feare yee not, stande still,
and behold, how the Lord shal saue you this day, &c. And according vnto his worde they were soone deliuered, and the Egyptians roo∣ted out, &c. And when the children of Israel beganne to enter into the Lande of promise, many Kinges and nations assaulted them with great fiercenesse, but they continued not long: for the Lorde fought for his people of Israel. Absolom rebelled against his father Dauid with great furie and violēce, but he was soone ouerthrown. 2. Sam. 15 2. Kin. 18. &. 19. The fiercenesse of the Assyrians was also of smal continuance. Se∣condly, the crueltie and rage of the wicked howe long and forci∣ble soeuer they bee, ought not to feare the faithfull: For as when a foundation laid with good stones, being wel ioyned & sodered to∣gether, is stedfast and stable, so that there is no storme so strong that can shake the same: euen so the righteous man which put∣teth Esa. 36. &. 37. his trust in the Lord being stayed vpon his power & goodnes, ought not to care for the assaultes of Satan, of the world, nor of the wicked: for it is said, They that trust in the Lorde shalbe euen as the mont Sion: which cannot bee remoued, but standeth fast for euer. &c. And least wee shoulde bee deceiued with vaine presumption, thinke to bee sure and not to bee shaken. For further too stablishe Psal. 125. 1 vs in the trust wee haue in God, and in the hope that wee haue that wee shall dwell for euer in the courtes of the Lorde, and in his holy mountaine: we must walke innocently, &c. Who so doth these thinges, shall neuer fall: for he is wel sodered together with strong Psal. 15. 5. faith, and true repentance. And this is the cause why Solomon saith, But the righteous remaineth as a storng foundation. There∣fore if we wil be stedfast, and not to be shaken through the rage and vehemēcie of the wicked, neither feare them, though they assault vs, for to destroy either in our goods or in our bodies, or that they la∣bour to destroy our soules by ouerthrowing of the true and sound doctrine, and by taking away of the pure religion, wee must bee ar∣med, not with an idle and dead faith, but with a liuely faith, which worketh by loue, as the Lorde teacheth vs in his worde. Then shall wee bee built vppon the rocke wherevpon Iesus Christ hath built
his Churche: against the which the gates of hell cannot preuaile. Our Lorde doeth well shewe it also by an other similitude. It is not Mat. 16. 18. Mat. 7. 24. therefore without cause that Solomō calleth the righteous, A strōg foundation. For (as we may vnderstand by the words of our Lord) this foundation shall not onely be sure in this world, but it shall re∣maine for euer, in eternall blessednesse. For blessed is the man that abideth temptation: for after he hath beene tried, he shal receiue a Iam. 1. 12. crowne of glory. 26 As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as smoke is vnto the eyes, euen so is a slouthfull body vnto him that sen∣deth him. Solomon hath rebuked and reprooued the slouthfull for consu∣ming of the time vnprofitably & spending it in vnnecessary works, and thereby runne in danger sodenly too fall into beggery and ex∣treme pouertie. And heerby hee hath shewed that the slouthfull was hurtful to himselfe. Nowe to the ende that wee shoulde take heede of the slouthful. And that wee shoulde not lightly set them a worke, chiefly when speede and diligence is required, hee sheweth vs that the slouthfull bringeth hurt, griefe and trouble vnto them which imploy and set them on worke. And for this cause he com∣pareth the slouthful vnto vineger that is laide vnto the teeth: the which it greeueth and troubleth, because of the coldnesse & sharp∣nesse thereof, and because of his biting and harshnesse it heateth and setteth the teeth on edge, and so doth hurt them. Secondly he compareth the slouthfull vnto smoke which smiteth against the eies: vnto the which it doeth much harme, it doeth darken them, and make them water, and doeth seeth them: and so doeth weaken the sight, and hinder the eyes from doing their office, and taking their recreation and pleasure. It is not without cause that Solomon, maketh these cōparisons, and is not contented to cōpare the slouth∣ful, either to vineger, or to smoke, but vnto them both: and chiefly the slouthfull body that is set about some good worke: for he cau∣seth not onely one griefe and hurt, but many: hee is cause of muche sorrowe and anger, because hee doeth not faithfully nor with suche care and diligence execute and discharge his office duely, as is requi∣red,
nor content and satisfie them which haue hired and set him on worke. This hath no neede of proofe: for they which hire and send labourers to do their work, do sufficiently trie what hurt and hinde∣rance they suffer, if their laborers be slouthful & negligēt: albeit the matter is not great. But we are al of this nature, that we trouble our¦selues, except that men doe as we wil haue them, euen in the affaires & workes of smal importance: neither wil we afterwards be serued with such slouthful and negligent persons againe, but wee disdaine and reiect them: for we would haue our workes so wel done, that we could finde no manner of fault. Nowe forasmuch as wee are of this nature, let euery one of vs take heede by the lawe of chari∣tie, if wee be sent, and appointed to doe some worke, that through our negligence and slouthfulnesse we grieue no man: but that faith∣fully and truely we giue vnto our neighbours that which wee owe them: that we be readie to doe towardes our neighbours, accōr∣ding as we are able. Let them which are lustie and strong, labour with their bodies to helpe the feeble and weake: let the riche bee riche in good workes: let the wise, prudent, and discreete, not spare their lippes and tongues, for to teache and to direct the vndiscreete, and them that goe astray. Otherwise we shal not be onely as vine∣ger and smoke vnto men, but also vnto God: for, of what estate or condition soeuer we be, it is hee that calleth vs thereunto, which doeth ordaine and sende vs: so that wee doe no good worke, but that it is the worke of the Lorde. If then we be slacke, carelesse and slouthful to doe our duetie, we are greeuous and troublesome vnto God: as we may plainly knowe by the similitude of the talents. To the ende therefore that we be not troublesome vnto our God, and Mat. 25. . least we be rebuked of euil and slouthfulnesse, wee must euery one of vs set ourselues to worke, according to the number and excellen∣cie of the talents that we haue receiued of the Lorde, that wee may be like the faithful and wise seruant, and not vnto the euil seruant. For to do this wel, let vs consider vnto what state we are called, and to what worke wee are sent. First of al, that the Kings, Princes, and Superiours of the earth (to whome God hath giuen this honour to communicate his name vnto them, saying, I haue saide yee are Gods, and are al children of the most highest) as God neuer cea∣seth Psa.. 82. 6.
seth working in gouerning the worlde by iudgement & iustice, and is careful and diligent to prouide for his creatures: so also they should not be giuen to sleepe & rest, to take their ease and pleasures, to take their sporte and worldly pastime, to eate and drinke out of measure, to delight in pompes and superfluous magnificence, but should be diligent and attentiue, as Dauid saieth, Be wise now ther∣fore, O ye Kings, be learned, ye that are Iudges of the earth. For to Psal. 2. 10. Exo. 18. 21 & 31. 1. Psal. 82. 3. Esai. 1. 23. Ier. 5. 27. compasse this wel, they must be men indued with vertue, and careful to folow the lesson that is taught them, and as they are commaun∣ded, to minister right vnto the poore, &c. Otherwise they shall be as vineger and smoke before the Lorde: hee wil be grieued at them, as he wel sheweth when he doeth threaten them, Thy Prin∣ces are vnfaithful, and companions of theeues, &c. Beholde howe they are exalted and enriched. Let the Ministers of the word, which are Heraldes Postes and Messengers of the great King and Ruler of al the world, for to carie the message of saluation, and to proclaime the ordinances of their Lorde and Maister, bee careful and dili∣gent: euen as the Gospel that they beare, is compared to a course, as also the life of al Christians: and by a stronger reason their liues, because they ought to proceede and go before their flock. Let them Esai. 56. 10 Act. 20. 28 not be like vnto sluggishe beastes, vnto lying Doctours, which are slowebellies, which through sweete wordes and faire speeches, (for to serue their bellies and not God, neither his Christe,) doe deceiue the heartes of the simple. And let them not be of the number of thē of whome Esai speaketh, Al their watchmen are blinde guides: they knowe nothing, &c: But let them folowe the counsel that S. Paule giueth, Let euerie one of them learne to be diligent: and to folowe Rom. 12. 11 the doctrine of Saint Paul, to wit, that they bee not slouthful to doe seruice, &c. 27 The feare of the Lorde encreaseth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked shalbe diminished. To the ende that we should vnderstand howe our dayes shalbee encreased to liue long, as there is none of vs but doeth desire the same: forasmuch as the feare of the Lorde is the way thereunto, we must not straye from it, but must fixe the same in our heartes, and make the same familiar and an housholde seruant, not in fearing the
Lorde as a cruel tyrant, or seuere and sharpe iudge. For after this sort we should haue the feare of punishment and torment, and not the feare of the Lorde. And as they which so feare the Lorde, haue not the feare of the Lorde: so also haue they neither wisedome nor vnderstanding. For the feare of the Lotde is the beginning of wise∣dome. Againe: the beginning of wisedome is the feare of the Lord. Pro. 1. 7. & 9. 10. And thus wisedome is not without feare, nor feare without wise∣dome. If we wil not be founde naked, we must take diligent heede vnto the commandements of God. And forasmuche as the Lorde promiseth in the lawe, length of dayes vnto them which shal keepe his commandements: it foloweth that it is not without cause that Solomon attributeth encrease of dayes vnto wisedome. And hereby we may vnderstand that the feare of the Lord and wisedome are so Pro. 2. 1. Pro. 3. 16 knit together, that the one is not without the other: so that they which are wise, are not without the feare of the Lord▪ and they that feare him, are not without wisdō. It is thē the feare of the Lord that increaseth the daies of the wise, making thē to liue lōg in this world, so lōg as is expedient & necessary for their spiritual & eternal helth. Contrarily, the foolish which want the feare of the Lorde, and therefore slippe and fal away to al rebellion and disobedience, and so become wicked, shal not continewe long, but their yeeres shalbe cut shorte, albeit that in the respect of the outwarde sight they liue long: but this length is nothing before God: For a thousand yeeres in thy sight, are but as yesterday that is past. Moreouer the yeres of Psal. 90. 4. Pro. 2. 21. 22 & 3. 20. the vngodly ought not to be counted long, because that afterwards they shal go into eternal death. 28 The patient abyding of the righteous shalbe gladnesse: but the hope of the wicked shal perish. Although that after our vicious and corrupted nature, wee be so blind & ignorant, that wee knowe not howe to reioyce, nor what true godlines is, yet are wee so affectioned after such a sort, that we desire to reioyce with gladnes, that wee might neuer want: & wee think that there is nothing better. I haue knowen nothing better of al these things, then to reioyce & to do wel in this life Again, there Ecele. 3. 12 22. & 5. 17 & 11. 9. is nothing better for a man but to reioice himselfe in his woorkes. And it is a faire thing to eate and drinke, & for a man to reioyce of
his labour, &c. And be merie in thy youth, & let thy heart bee glad▪ Now as we are ignorāt, euē so of ourselues do we neuer attein vn∣to this gladnesse, though we doe much desire it. But Solomon wil∣ling that we should obteine our desires, doeth teache vs howe wee shal atteine thereunto, when he sayeth, the patient abiding of the righteous, is ioye. He attributeth ioy vnto righteousnes, the which consisteth in this, that being assured of the goodnes & loue of God towardes vs, we should delight to giue him obedience according to his lawe, by louing him with al our hearts, and our neighbours as ourselues. If we bee such, though wee haue many troubles, griefes, and sorowes, for that which wee see to happen in the worlde, and chiefly because of our sinnes, and also for the offences and slaunders of our neighbours (for it is that which ought to greeue vs more then al other thinges) yet if of a free wil and perfect heart we aspire vnto righteousnes, we shal not be depriued of ioy. The seruants of 2. Cor. 6. 9. God doe prooue, and may say with Saint Paule: as vnknowne, and yet knowne: as sorowing, and yet alway reioysing: as dying, and behold we liue: as chastened, and yet not killed: as sorowing, and yet alway reioysing: as poore, and yet make many rich: as hauing nothing, and yet possessing al thinges. Forasmuche as they knowe and are assured that God loueth them, they delight and reioyce in Psal. 5. 12. & 32. 1. his Worde, knowing that God is true in his promises and holie in al his workes, lawes and commandements: and let al them that put their trust in thee, reioyce: they shal euer be giuing of thankes, be∣cause thou defendest them, they that loue thy name, shalbe ioyful in thee. Reioyce in the Lorde, O ye righteous: for it becommeth wel the iust to be thankful. But albeit the righteous do reioyce, because they are assured God loueth them, as Solomon doeth shewe, when he is not contented to say, that the righteous doe reioyce, but hee doeth attribute their gladnesse vnto their hope. For he sayeth, The patient abiding of the righteous is ioye: as if he saide, that which reioyceth the righteous, is the hope they haue in the Lorde, who wil not deceiue them of that which they looke for of him: and thus their ioy shal abide for euer, seeing they shal haue full and perpetuall possession of that whereof they reioyce and looke for with gladnes. Likewise what miseries soeuer they suffer in this worlde, yet haue they good occasion and matter to reioyce, as our Lord doth shew,
them, making them felowes & companions of al the Prophetes, and assuring them of a most precious rewarde. Therefore if we wil hold the true ioy, let vs not lament & be sorie for the ease of this world, the lustes and pleasures, the abundance and superfluitie of substance and riches of this world, which doe deceiue and beguile the vngod∣ly. For they seeing themselues in worldly and temporal prosperitie, do runne into insolencie and vnshamefastnes, & do promise them∣selues, that no euil nor hurt shal happen vnto them. But Solomon doeth threaten them with the contrarie, when hee sayeth, But the hope of the wicked shal perish. This is often seene to happen to the worlde, and the Scriptures and replenished with such examples, and Luk. 6. 24. also with like threates. And also it is written, Woe be to you that are riche men: for you haue receiued your consolation. 29 The way of the Lorde is strong for him that is perfecte: but feare shalbe to them that worke iniquitie. They that wil be assured and safe either from their enemies, or from other thinges which might hurt them, or ouerthrowe and destroy them, doe arme and fortifie themselues either with multi∣tude of people, or golde and siluer, or with Castles and townes sure∣ly compassed with strong walles, deepe and large ditches, and other things which they esteeme to be fit and meete for to preserue them from the feare of their enemies, & other dangers. It is not euil done for a man to arme himselfe against al aduersities: but it is euil done to trust in worldly and temporal helpes. For with this, that more of∣ten they finde themselues deceiued & beguiled, they also offēd God, by striuing against his word, wherby he doth shew vnto vs that we must only put our trust in him, & that it is onely from whome wee must looke for our only refuge, for to strengthen vs against whatso∣euer we may feare, aswel in this life as after the same: likewise the Lorde reprooueth such confidence, doth curse them & ouerthrowe them: as the children of Israel haue prooued, and other nations in their order: euen as the holy histories do declare, and the Prophets haue foretold: that it is euil done to trust in mens helpe, Dauid doth shew, when he saieth, that some put their trust in Charets, & some in Horses: but wee wil remember of the Lorde our God. There Psal. 20. 8. & 49. 6 be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselues
in the multitude of their riches. And that it is against the worde, it is manifest: for it is said, Thou wilt make no couenant with them, nor with their goods. Let vs knowe then that wee striue against the Exo. 23. 32. worde of the Lorde, when wee haue our regarde vnto worldly and temporal helpe, for to saue vs, and that in this sort wee loose our¦selues, by the iust vengeaunce of God (the which wee cannot de∣sire, except we be madde and out of their wittes, but doe craue our conseruation and saluation, and would gladly bee assured thereof, without danger of falling therefrom, but to be surely kept and fast holden therein) we must be verie diligent to marke the doctrine of Solomon, when hee sayeth, The way of the Lorde is strong vnto him that is perfect. For he doeth shewe vs, that if we wil be with∣out Rom. 4. 13. & 11. 6. feare and out of danger, and to be strongly armed and fortified, for to withstand al the assaults of Satan and of the world, and to o∣uercome them, wee must bee perfect, and walke in the way of the Lorde, wherein at the first sight, it seemeth that hee doeth attribute the assurance of our saluation vnto the dignitie & excellencie of the person, and to the desert of works, the which is contrarie vnto grace and to the promises. For the promise, that Abraham shoulde be the heire of the world, was not giuen him, or to his seede through the righteousnes of Fayth. Again, If it be of grace, it is not any more of workes, or grace were no more grace. For to resolue & vnloose this questiō & doubt, let vs first of al note that it is al one, to walk in the way of the Lorde, & to be perfect: for the one is the diffinition of the other. The which shalbe easie for vs to vnderstand, if we know that the way of the Lord is that which he teacheth and commaun∣deth vs by his word, true and iust. Shew me thy wayes, O Lord: and Psal. 25. 4. Esai. 2. 3. teach me thy pathes. Come & let vs ascend vp to the mountaine of the Lord, & he shal teach vs his wayes. Now the perfect man, is hee that walketh in the lawe or doctrine of the Lorde. Blessed are those Psal. 119. 1 that are vndefiled in the way: & walke in the way of the Lord. Noe was a iust & perfect man in his dayes, walking after God. And God said vnto Abraham, walk before me & be perfect. Now must we see from whence this perfectiō commeth to man, & whither it come of Gen. 9. 9. & 17. 1. his owne power that hee walketh & perseuereth in the way of the Lord. The Scriptures condemneth al men of corruption & wicked∣nes. But deliuerance commeth of God. Moses doth wel shew it, The
Lord thy God shal circumcise thine hart, &c. Create in me a cleane hart O God, &c. Turne me O Lord, & I shalbee turned. Againe, I Gene. 6. & 8. Iohn. 3. Rom. 3. &. 7 Iere. 10. Deut. 30. 6. Psal. 51. 12. Iere. 31. 18. wil put my lawe within them, and write it in their hartes, &c. And forasmuch as it commeth of the grace and gift of God, that man is perfit, and that he walketh in the way of the Lorde, it foloweth wel that Solomon doth heere attribute nothing vnto the dignitie and excellencie of man, nor to the merite of his workes: but by the free promise of God he laboureth to assure the faythful man against al temptations, promising him that if by saith he stay himself vpō the goodnesse of God, and that by true repentance hee endeuoureth to giue obedience vnto his lawe, that he shalbe out of al dangers of de∣struction & perdition, & shalbe wel armed and fortified against all battels aswel of the Deuil as of the worlde. This mans house is buil∣ded vpō the rock. We are thē here exhorted not to feare any thing, Mat. 7. 24. if we receiue the word in feare and reuerence. Also, forasmuch as strength is promised vnto vs, it foloweth there is no power in vs, & that it is the gift of God: Moreouer, that strength is promised & gi∣uen vs, to the end that we should imploy ourselues manly & migh∣tely. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of Ephe. 6. 10. his might, &c. But if wee lay apart those armours and weapons through infidelitie and rebellion, and perseuer in our corruption & naughtinesse, albeeit that after the sight of the eyes, wee bee bolde, hardy, and valiant, or rather cruel and raging: yet because our con∣science doth reprooue vs, we haue no assurance, nor can haue. For as Solomon saith they shalbe afraide that worke wickednesse. And this is by folowing the threatninges of the lawe, as heere aboue is alreadie saide in the 24. verse. &c. 30 The righteous shal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked shal not remaine in the land. Forasmuch as the righteous is he which hath a perfit hart, & doth delite to liue cōformably after the rule that God giueth him in his word, by seruing God with al honor & reuerence, & his neighbors in simplicitie and innocencie, it might seeme at the first sight that the promise which Solomon maketh here, hath no place, & that the cō∣trary thereof is true. For first of al the scripture giueth witnesse
vnto Abel, that he was righteous: & yet it appeareth that he was re∣moued, whē through the crueltie of his brother Caine, his tēporal life was takē frō him, & his blood shead. Likewise many other righ∣teous men, (amongst the which were the Prophets and Apostles) haue bin cruelly handled, & suffred great tyrannie, as killing & mur∣thering. Euen Iesus Christ, which did not sin, in whose mouth was Mat. 23. 3. Heb. 11. 4. founde no guile, he I say, which is the resurrection & the life, euen the Creator of heauen & earth: the Lord which hath al in his pow∣er, was most shamefully taken of the world. With these so many ex∣amples, we haue also witnesses. Was there euer man that perished in Eccle. 26. 1. Esay. 57. 1. his righteousnes: or wicked which prolonged his dayes with his malice? The righteous is destroyed, and no man thinketh thereof in his heart. I answere, Albeit that this world & the present life apper∣teine vnto the righteous by promise, and that the earth, shoulde bee Ps. 37. &. 24 Rom. 4. 3. their inheritance, because they are the children of God, & seede of Abraham, to whom the earth apperteineth▪ and therupon heires of the world: yet notwithstāding through the rage of the vngodly they are oftentimes euil handled, & are after the outward sight takē from the world, & seeme to be depriued of this worldly heritage, (promi∣sed vnto their father Abraham,) & to be destroyed & damned: but the truth indeed is, as Solomon saith, that they shal neuer be remo∣ued. For as Abraham remained in the promised lande as a Pilgrime Heb. 11. 9. and stranger, euen so the righteous do iudge themselues strangers in this world, & seeke another countrey: and therfore they feare not to be taken out of this world, but rather reioyce: & so, albeit they de∣part out of this world, yet they are not driuen out perforce: & ther∣fore they think it no remoouing, when they change this life. For by this meanes they enioy the rest which hath bene prepared from the beginning, & do obteine glorious immortalitie. Thus the righteous is reduced back from euil, that he may come in peace. The soules of Esay. 57. 1. Wis. 3. 1. the righteous are in the handes of God, & no torment doth touch them. After this sorte they esteeme themselues, neither ought to bee iudged remooued: but that if they were surely planted by Fayth and hope, that nowe they are planted muche more strongly, when they obteine the fruition of that which they beleeued, and looked for through hope: and doe obteine it, for to enioy it eter∣nally.
For they which rest in the heauēly glorie, can neuer be drawne from thence. Thē shalbe perfectly fulfilled, that which Dauid saith, Psal. 92. 13 The righteous shal florishe like a Palme tree: and shal spreade a∣broad like a Ceder in Libanus, &c. Contrarily and against this pro∣mise, he setteth a threatening for to feare the wicked, pronouncing vnto them, that they shalbe depriued of their pleasures. They take their pleasure in this worlde, and in this earth, and haue no other minde, but to place themselues at ease in earth, and to haue abun∣dance of riches to triumph and to make great cheare. Their medita∣tion is, that they would haue their houses endure for euer. But So∣lomon Psal. 49. 12 doeth pronounce, that they shal not dwel in the land. If wee beholde the outwarde apparance, it shall seeme vnto vs that there is no people in the worlde, which haue better, nor longer habi∣tation in the lande, then haue the wicked: they obteine the king∣domes and principalities, townes and castles, they haue abundance of substance and riches, and take also their ease, and as it seemeth they want nothing of that they can desire and wishe: in such wise, that the children of God are tempted to folowe them, to be parta∣kers of their prosperitie. But albeit that God doeth suffer his to be Psal. 73. 1. tempted, yet he letteth them not fal. For, truely God is good to Is∣rael, and to them which are of a cleane heart. Euen so at the first sight it might seeme, that the contrarie of this threatening were Iere. 12. 1. Iob. 21. 7. true. Ieremy also sayeth, If I shoulde dispute with thee, O Lord, thou arte righteous, yet let mee speake of iudgement before thee. Why doeth the way of the vngodly prosper? Wherefore doe the wic∣ked stil waxe and growe riche? If we looke wel howe Solomon spea∣keth, hee giueth vs the solution of this question and doubt: for hee Leui. 26. Deut. 28. sayeth not that the wicked doe not dwel in the lande, but that they shal not dwel in the land: and this is according to the threatenings that God maketh against the contemners of his lawe, and accor∣ding to that which is pronounced against the wicked. Ieremie also Iere. 12. 3. Psal. 37. giueth the solution, when hee prayeth, Drawe them as sheepe vn∣to the slaughter, and prepare them against the day of murther. So doeth Iob also, saying, Loe, their wealth is not in their hand. Iob. 21. 16
31 The mouth of the righteous shal bring foorth wisedome: but the tongue of the froward shalbe rooted out. Vnwillingly do men remooue a good tree from his place, wher∣in it hath taken great and good rootes, and bringeth foorth good fruit with abundance, except they hope that it wil fructifie more in an other place. And so when it is wel rooted, it mooueth not, but keepeth his place. Contrarily, the axe is alreadie set to the roote of the trees: therfore euerie tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, Mat. 3. 10. is hewen downe, and cast into the fire. Also Solomon knowing that the righteous is like vnto the good tree, which giueth and bringeth foorth his fruite in due season, hath saide, that hee shal neuer bee remooued. And after this, he sheweth what fruit he bringeth forth, when he sayeth, That the mouth of the righteous shal bring foorth wisedome. That which is proper vnto the heart, hee attributeth vnto the mouth, because it is the Organe of the heart, and that Mat. 12. 34. 35. from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh: and that a good man from the good treasure of his heart, bringeth foorth good thinges. Nowe that this fruit is good, it ought to be knowne enough to vs, by that which hath bene saide of the excellencie, dig∣nitie, and goodnesse of wisedome. But the meanes to produce this Rom. 12. 7. Ephe. 4. 29. & 5. 3. fruit, is to folow the coūsel of the Apostle which saith, He that hath an office, let him waite on his office: or hee that teacheth, on tea∣ching, &c. Let no corrupt communication proceede out of your mouthes: but that which is good, to the vse of edifying, that it may minister grace vnto the hearers. But fornication, and al vncleannes, or couetousnes, let it not be once named amongst you, as it becom∣meth Saintes. Let euerie man as hee hath receiued the gift, mini∣ster the same one to another, as good disposers of the manifolde grace of God. This same fruite is required of all, and there is none 1. Pet. 4. 10 that can truely boast to bee a Christian, except he bring it forth. But chiefly the Ministers of the worde ought to bee careful and diligent to bring foorth this fruite. I haue chosen you, and ordeined you, that yee shoulde goe and bring foorth fruite. They are the hus∣bandmen Ioh. 15. 16. Mat. 21. 41. and labourers, vnto whome the Lorde hath let out his Vineyarde. By this wee may knowe, that the righteous are not
great in number, seeing there are but verie fewe that do giue them∣selues to speake wisely: but almost euerie mouth doeth vtter vani∣tie and foolishnesse, vncleannesse and wickednesse, as is tried. And forasmuche as the good tree doeth bring foorth his fruit in due sea∣son, and wisedome is alwayes in season, it is alwayes profitable, yea euen necessarie: it foloweth, that the righteous doeth not cease to bring foorth wisedome by wholesome doctrine, by good admoni∣tions, by holie corrections and iust threates, according to that which is saide, The mouth of the righteous wil talke of wisdome. This same is chiefly fulfilled by the preaching of the Gospel, which Psal. 37. 3 for to declare wel, the Lord hath promised a mouth & wisdō vnto his Apostles. Saint Paul doth declare it when he sayeth, This grace was giuen mee, &c. And when hee sayeth that hee preacheth Luk. 21. 15 Ephe. 3. 8. Collo. 1. 28. the Gospel, admonishing euerie man, and teaching euerie man in all wisedome, that wee may present euerie man perfect in Christ Iesus: against the mouth of the righteous, hee setteth the tongue of the frowarde, that is a frowarde tongue, which speaketh no∣thing but vanitie, filthines and wickednes, lying, fraude, cursing, slandering, false swearing, flatterie, wanton songes, and other idle wordes. All these thinges are euil fruites, the which ought not to proceede from the mouth of the faithfull, neither can they vtter suche. And because the tongue of the frowarde bringeth foorth suche fruites, Solomon doeth place it in order, and also doeth compare it vnto euil trees, when hee sayeth that it shalbee rooted out. Wherein hee signifieth, that after the frowarde haue misused their tongues at pleasure, by blaspheming of God, and slan∣dering of their neighbours in diuers sortes, that at the last, they shalbe confounded, and shalbe compelled to holde their peace. For they shewe there is no faithfulnesse in their mouthes: their in∣warde partes are verie wickednesse. With our tongues will wee preuaile: wee are they that ought to speake, who is Lord ouer vs? Psal. 5. 10 & 12. 4. & 73. 9. For they stretche foorth their mouth vnto the heauen: and theyr tongue goeth through the worlde. But it shall happen to them at the last, as the Psalmist prayeth against them. Rewarde them accor∣ding to their deeds, and according to the wickednes of their owne Psal. 28. 4. inuentions.
The Lorde shal roote out al deceitful lippes: and the tongue that Psal. 12. 3. speaketh proude thinges. But it is not without cause, that Solo∣mon is not cōtented only to say, The tongue of the froward, in the singular number: but doeth attribute also vnto the tongue, many wickednesses. This is to shewe briefly, that the tongue of man is stopped and infected with a great abundance of wickednesses, and that it is impossible, or at the least verie harde, to remedie the same, as more at large Saint Iames doeth declare, saying, Beholde, wee put bittes into the Horses mouthes, that they should obey vs, and Iam. 3. 3. wee turne about al their bodie, &c. 32 The lippes of the righteous wil speake things pleasaunt: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowarde things. The righteous man for to vtter wisedome wel, taketh heede of the speaking with his lippes any thing that shoulde displease God, or which ought to bee yrkesome or troublesome vnto his neighbours: but hee guideth his lippes wisely, speaking accor∣ding as hee knoweth to bee the pleasure and wil of God: and ther∣with hee laboureth to please al men with his worde, so muche as is possible, without offending of GOD, and without gi∣uing of offence to his neighbours. This is that which Solo∣mon meaneth, when hee sayeth, The lippes of the righteous wil speake of acceptable thinges. Whereupon foloweth, that the lippes of the righteous are occupied in pronouncing the worde of God, the which hee woulde haue continually in the mouth of man. These words I command thee this day shalbe in thy heart, lay vp then these words in your hearts. Seeing that God so straight∣ly Deut. 6. 6. & 11. 18. and expresly commaundeth this same, it foloweth, that if wee occupie ourselues in speaking so, that then our tongues wil speake any thing that is pleasaunt vnto him. Nowe that which plea∣seth the Creator and Lorde of all the worlde, ought well also to please his creatures, that are his subiectes, who for to please him, ought to loue that which they know wil please him, cōsidering also the excellencie, and profit of this word, & the sweetnes thereof.
The wordes of the Lorde are pure wordes. The lawe of the Lorde is an vndefiled lawe, conuerting the soule. O howe sweete are thy Psal. 12. 7. & 19. 8. & 119. 103. wordes vnto my throte? yea, sweeter then honie vnto my mouth. The wicked, which despise and reiect the worde, haue no cleane mouthes, but filthie & infected, and altogether disordered & giuen vp to euil speaking, and to cast vp out of their throte al filthinesse and stinking sauour. This is it which Solomon meaneth, when hee sayeth, but the mouth of the wicked doth speake frowarde thinges. They are a viperous generation, and therefore they can not speake well, seeing they themselues are euil: for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. Men vse not to gather grapes of thornes, nor Figges of thistles. Wherefore we knowe that it is not without cause that Solomon hath saide, that the tongue of the frowarde shalbe rooted out. For sith that the wicked by the euil fruites of their mouth, doe labour to poyson and to destroy their neighbours, and which worst is, doe despight God, by their blas∣phemies, they wel deserue to be rooted out. The eleuenth Chapter. 1 FAlse ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaseth him. FOrasmuche as the worlde is repleni∣shed with fraud and deceit, with vsu∣rie and greedinesse, with theft & rob∣berie, with counterfaiting and falsify∣ing: therefore the commandement is not esteemed, Thou shalt not do vn∣iustly in iudgement, in line, in waight or in measure. Thou shalt not haue in thy bagge twoo maner of waightes, a Leui. 19. 35. Deut. 25. 13. great and a smal. There is no account made of the promise that God addeth vnto this commandement, That thy dayes may bee made long on the earth: neither also is the threatening feared that foloweth: for whosoeuer shal so doe,
shalbee abhorred of the Lorde. In this sorte wee iudge lesse of God then of mortal men. If a mighty and riche man hath made promise of any thing, wee wil trust to receiue according to his promise, and in the meane while they wil bee diligent to please him: if he threaten, they wil feare him, and wil take heede to doe any thing that shoulde displease him. But although that GOD is true, yea euen hee himselfe the onely trueth (otherwise he shoulde not bee GOD) and that hee doeth testifie his trueth vnto vs by diuers witnesses, yet wil wee not trust his promises: as wee shewe, when wee make no account to labour for to please him. And also though hee be true and faithful, and doeth threaten but vppon iust cause, yet doe we not tremble, nor feare his vengeance, albeeit he declare the same by faithful witnesses. Moyses is one of the witnesses of the promises and threateninges: as wee haue nowe heard. After him came Solomon, indued with great wise∣dome of GOD, who doeth witnesse the same in this place. First of al hee threateneth them which oppresse and deceiue their neigh∣bours in any matter whatsoeuer it is, when hee saieth, 1 False ballances are abhomination vnto the Lord: he doth threaten them, I say with eternal destruction and damnation. For it followeth wel that if a false ballance displeaseth the Lorde, and that hee doeth abhorre them, that then they which vse them are wicked: and therefore cannot remaine, but are as chaffe which the winde driueth away, and so goe to destruction: for the way of the wicked shal perish: seing also that it is saide, Thou art not a GOD that louest wickednesse, &c. But to the ende that we may knowe Psal. 1. 6. Psal. 5. 4. who they are that God abhorreth, and that we also should abhorre them (for nothing that displeaseth God, ought to please vs, but we should hate & contemneit) we must consider wherein the false bal∣lance standeth, and who they are that vse them. Which for to doe, let vs knowe that the ballance is taken for al waytes, measures, rule, and for al Artes, Sciences, Lawes, and behauiours that we vse towardes our neighbours, wee may so vnderstande it, by the place afore alledged by Moyses, out of the which hee collected these things. Likewise the Lord doth attribute rule and ballance, to that
which he doeth towards his Church for to restore it. Iudgement al∣so wil I laye to the rule, and righteousnes to the ballance. It is then a false ballance and deceiueable, when wee doe not faithfully be∣haue vs towardes our neighbour, when wee are slacke and negli∣gent to paye our duetie, or that wee labour to treade them vnder foote, or to deceiue in any matter whatsoeuer it bee. In all e∣states as we prooue by experience, there are false ballances: as betweene Merchantes, Citizens, Handicraftes men, and labou∣rers, but the most hurtfull are they which are enclosed in the hands of false teachers, who by fayre wordes, and flattering speech, de∣ceiue the heartes of the simple and innocent. After these may bee set the same of wicked Magistrates, which are placed in the seate of God, who is righteous: and yet their houses are filled with the spoyles of the poore. Nowe the perfection that is required of vs, is, that wee shoulde not imagine nor deuise any euil against our neighbours, that wee shoulde not labour to become riche to their hurt, but that in simplicitie & vprightnesse of conscience we should procure their wealth with al our power. This is the perfect waight which pleaseth the Lorde, as sayeth Solomon. They which vse this waight, are acceptable vnto God: and as the waight which they vse is perfect, so doeth God allowe them for perfect, and doth not impute vnto them the reliques of imperfection which is in them. And forasmuche as they please God, hee wil neuer bee displeased with them to destroy them. Whereupon it foloweth, that Solo∣mon, saying, That a perfect waight pleaseth the Lorde, doeth promise euerlasting life vnto them which vse it, who although they be most commonly poore and miserable before the worlde, yet are they riche enough, and blessed, for they are heyres of the heauen∣ly kingdome, and of wonderful riches. 2 When pride commeth, then commeth shame: but with the lowlie is wisedome. Man naturally desireth and wisheth to bee exalted vnto glorie and honour: but hee knoweth not howe to attaine thereunto: and therefore most commonly insteede to ascende and goe forwarde,
hee falleth backewarde: and in place of glory and honour, hee get∣teth confusion, shame and dishonour: and this is not without hurt, but most commonly men are ashamed and confounded by the hurt that happeneth against their expectation and hope. Our first Father Adam hath wel proued it, and before him the Angels which kept not their first state, but fel from their place. Now as it hath happened vnto the Angels, and to Adam, euen so doeth it, and shalbefal vnto al them that are proude. This hath beene founde true in al ages. And therefore according to experience, Solomon doeth pronounce: That when pride commeth, then commeth shame. If the world destroied by the fludde, had beleeued Noe the messenger of righteousnesse, it had not fallen into such shame and eternal destruction. The builders of the Tower of Babylon haue tryed this true. To be shorte, if wee examine the holy histories Gen. 11. 9 of the Byble, wee shal finde that they which haue beene raised through pride, haue beene afterwardes confounded and ashamed: and this same hath not befallen vnto the reprobate onely, but also vnto the children of God as vnto Dauid, and Saint Peter. It is then good reason that the proude shoulde bee confounded and ashamed: 2. Sam. 24. Mat. 26. for they rise not vp against men, but against God, to whom al knees ought to bowe, and to whome al creatures ought to do homage & seruice, and to humble themselues vnder his mighty hande, against the which none can resist. For this cause (I say) it is necessary that they shoulde bee confounded and ashamed: the one for a certaine time, as Dauid and Saint Peter, who by shame came to repentance: but the other, as the reprobate, lye euer therein. For what shame soeuer they feele in this world, yet doe they not cal them∣selues home, to consider against whome they quarrel for to hūble themselues, but doe harden themselues through pride and presump∣tion. As Pharao, when hee pursued the people of God, had di∣uers wounds, & yet he ceased not to rebel, euē so he is & shal cōti∣new in eternal confusiō as al other proud & arrogant persons that wil not submit & humble themselues. Nowe beholde, the day com∣meth that shal burne as an ouen, and al the proude, yea and all that Mala. 4. 1. doe wickedly shalbee stubble, and the day that commeth shal burne them vp, saith the Lorde of hostes, and shall leaue them nei∣ther
roote nor branche. The high looke of a man shalbee humbled, and the loftinesse of men shall be abaced, and the Lorde onely shall bee exalted in that day, &c. Wee must therefore be humble, and we Esay. 2. 11. shal not bee ashamed: although the worlde doe contemne and re∣iect vs, and that we be counted as the filth and doung of the world, yet shal we not be confounded nor ashamed for all the dishonour that men labour to worke vs, but wee shall bee praised and honou∣red so much as shalbe expedient for the glory of God, and for our spiritual health. Ioseph had experience therof in Egypt. Dauid had experience thereof in diuers sorts: and therfore the Scripture con∣fesseth that god hath chosen & elected him. And also hee generally cōfesseth, Euē thou hast set me vp frō mine enimies that rose against me: thou hast deliuered mee from the cruell man. His eyes con∣sider the poore, and his eye liddes trieth the children of men. Hee hath shewed strength with his arme: he hath scattered the proude Psal. 18. 48. Psal. 11. 4. Luke. 1. 51. &. 52. &. 53. in the imagination of their heartes. Hee hath put downe the migh∣tie from their seates, and hath exalted them of lowe degree. Hee hath filled the hungrie with good thinges, and sent away the riche emptie. These are the wordes of the Virgin Mary. Likewise our Lorde Iesus, who was esteemed as the shame and scumme of the worlde, hath beene highly exalted. Therefore wee must chiefly Phil. 2. 9. Mat. 11. 29. Ioh. 13. 14. Mat. 18. 4. learne of our Lorde to humble ourselues: with his example also he hath made vs a promise, which ought greatly to mooue vs to hum∣ble ourselues. Whosoeuer therefore shall humble himselfe as this little childe, the same is the greatest in the kingdome of heauen. For whosoeeuer exalteth himself, shalbe brought low, and he that hum∣bleth Ioh. 14. 11. Luke. 14. 11. 1. Pet. 5. 5. himself, shalbe exalted. God resisteth the proude, and giueth grace vnto the humble. Solomon doeth giue vs the very same pro∣mise, but yet vnder other words, when he saith, but with the hum∣ble commeth wisedome. For it is as much as if he did say: They which are not giuen vnto their owne iudgement, which presume not of themselues, neither doe esteeme themselues aboue others, but doe labour to keepe themselues within the simplicitie of the worde by assuring themselues of the goodnesse and fauour of God, and of his promises, and through true repentance do giue thēselues to followe the righteousnesse that GOD hath commanded by his lawe, and become subiect and obedient vnto this good father of
heauen: These (I say) that are such, and haue set all their desire to doe the wil of God, and which can say, Lord, my hearte is not Psal. 131. 1. hawtie, neither are mine eyes loftie, neither haue I walked in great matters, and hid from mee, suche are accompanied with wisedome: wherevpon followeth that they shall not bee confounded, but shal-be exalted vnto honour. For length of daies is in her right hande. Pro. 3. 16. When there is so much riches in wisedome, the which doeth ac∣company and follow the humble, they shalbe farre from shame, and shalbe crowned with immortall glory. But to the ende that wee should not deceiue ourselues, and in the place of humility to be ac∣companied with pride, let vs note that there are some which doe count themselues, and would also be esteemed of others to be hum∣ble, and yet they burst with pride. First of all wee place the hypo∣crites which in wordes doe abace and become lowly, and yet indeede woulde bee the greatest. As the Pope nameth himselfe to bee Math. 23. 5. &. 7. 15. Rom. 16. 17. Phil. 3. 18. 1. Tim. 6. 3. Mat. 7. 22. Rom. 10. 3. Col. 2. 1. Math. 7. 3. Rom. 2. 1. Luk. 18. 11 Heb. 11. 13 &. 13. 14. the seruant of the seruants of God: and yet for al that wil be wor∣shipped. The Monkes and Priestes doe also abace themselues both in words & in gesture, but they may bee set amongest the order of hypocrites, of whome our Lorde Iesus Christe doeth warne vs: And doe al their workes for to bee seene of men. Secondly, the false Prophetes, and lying Doctours. Thirdly, those are not, nor wil not bee contented with the puritie of the Gospel, the which doeth preache vnto vs saluation in Iesus Christe but will bee saued by their workes. Fourthly, they which iudge others, and doe worse themselues, such are like the Pharisees. 3 The vprightnesse of the iust shall guide them: but the frowardenesse of the transgressours shall destroy them. Wee are all pilgrims in this worlde, but wee are so ignoraunt that we cannot guide ourselues in our iourney, but are like vn∣to blinde men which presume and take vpon them to walke in the way without a guide, they rather take the wrong way then the right, and doe stumble and knocke themselues, and they fal & hurte themselues, and are in danger to bee lost. Suche is our state if wee
be left to our owne nature, wee wander out of the right pathe: and if wee be not set in againe, wee perishe. For, for to guide ourselues and to atchieue and come to the ende of our enterprise, we consi∣der and set before vs the greatest number, and doe followe them: and in so doing wee enter at the wide gate, and walke in the broade Mat. 7. 13. way that leadeth to destruction. And in this sort, wee doe cleane contrary to that which wee desire: for naturally wee desire to guide ourselues, and so wel to dispatch our businesse, that wee shoulde haue no hurt therby. But it is necessary that we should want of our desire, seeing that in labouring to doe our businesse, wee proceede therein by deceit and malice, by vnfaithfulnes, lying, and craftie pac∣king, by hypocrisie and feignednesse, and doe not labour to enrich ourselues, but with the hurt & hinderance of our neighbors, so that wee may well complaine with Dauid, Helpe me, Lord, for there is Psa. 12. 1. Esa. 9. 17. & 59. 3. 9. not one godly man: for the faithful are diminished frō among the children of men. And with Esay, For euery one is an hypocrite, and wicked, and euery mouth speaketh folly. For your handes are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquitie: your lippes haue spoken lyes, and your tongue hath murmured iniquitie. After this sorte wee guide ourselues as the blinde doe: and wee may say Esay. 59. 9. 10. with the Prophet Esay, in the same place: wee waight for light, but loe it is darkenesse, for brightnesse: but wee walke in darkenesse. We grope for the wall, like the blinde, and we grope as one with∣out eies, &c. Likewise Solomon doth not deny, but that in this sort wee may be guided, when he attributeth guiding and gouernance vnto in∣tegritie and vprightnesse, and that he saith, the vprtghtnesse of the iust shall guide them, and when contrarily, hee doth attribute destruction vnto frowardnesse and vnfaithfulnesse, saying, but the frowardnesse of the transgressour shall destroy them. If then wee would keepe a good way, and doe well our businesse, wee must bee indued with integrite and vprightnesse, the which are vertues de∣pending the one of the other, so that the one cannot be without the other, & it is very harde to be iudged which of them should go be∣fore. Also we see here that Solomō doth ioine them together, when hee saith, the vprightnesse of the faithful or iust: as also they are
ioyned together by the Scripture. This man was an vpright and iust man. Let mine vprightnesse and equitie preserue mee. Marke the Iob. 1. 1. Psal. 25. 21. Psal. 37. 37. Gen. 6. 9. vpright man, and beholde the iust. Noah was a iust and vpright man in his time, and walked with God, and did so well gouerne him∣selfe and his affaires, that he perished not by the flood. But to the end that we shoulde not attribute any merite vnto his integritie, it is said that Noah found fauour before the Lord. And God willing to instruct Abraham to gouerne himselfe wel, said vnto him, Walke before mee, and be thou vpright. And to the ende that we should not attribute this guiding vnto Abrahams power, he said vnto him. I am God al sufficient, or, almightie: and for to make him to vnder∣stande that Abraham of himself for al his integritie, could not bring Gen. 17. 1. his matters to passe, he promiseth him immediately, I wil make my couenant betwene mee and thee, and I wil mutiplie thee exceeding∣ly. Therefore, when by integritie and vprightnesse wee shalbe wel gouerned, let vs attribute nothing vnto our merites or power, but to the onely grace of God, who by his goodnes and power worketh in vs, and doeth giue vs both integritie and vprightnesse. And sith that it is by his vertue that God doeth gouerne and leade vs, to the end that we shoulde knowe whether we bee wel gouerned or no, we must vnderstand wherein consisteth integritie and vprightnesse. If we haue wel borne away and learned that which hath beene said in the places afore aledged, wee may gather that the integritie and vprightnesse standeth in this, that by the grace and power of GOD we should be soled, that in al thinges we shoulde walke before him according to his lawes: fearing him, and withdrawing ourselues from euill. If we thus walke, wee shalbe wel gouerned: our affaires shal goe wel, and nothing shal hurt vs: but in spite of Satan and al our enimies, we shal alwaies prosper. And who is it that wil harme you, if ye folow that which is good? Albeit that the enimies of Iob 1. Pet. 3. 13. with Satan did labour diligently, to ouerthrowe and destroy him: yet was he in such wise gouerned by his integritie and vprightnesse Iob. 42. 10. that his enterprises and worke came wel to passe, & had a good suc∣cesse. Contralily, albeit that as wee see in this worlde, the wicked, the Iam. 5. 11. frowarde, the hypocrites, deceiuers, rebels, and disobedient both to God and their Superiours, doe dispatch their businesse well, and that they prosper in outwarde sight, yet shal they bee but a smoke,
and shall vanishe away, and shal perishe eternally. For as Solo∣mon saith, The frowardnes of the transgressours shall destroy thē. The transgressours shalbe destroyed together: and the ende of the vngodly is, they shalbe rooted out at the last. And because the affli∣cted Psal. 37. 38. & 39. doe thinke the time long, because of the infirmitie of the flesh, Dauid doeth exhorte them vnto pacience, saying: Hope then in the Lorde, and keepe his way, and he shal promote thee, that thou shalt possesse the Lande, when the vngodly shall perishe, thou shalt see it. 4 Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteous∣nesse deliuereth from death. It seemeth at the first sight that Solomon doeth contrary him∣selfe: for hee hath saide, The riche mans goods are his strong hold, Pro. 10. 15. and nowe hee saith, Riches shall not auaile thee in the day of wrath. But if wee remember that which wee haue saide, howe the former sentence doeth not conteine any expresse commande∣ment or doctrine that ought to bee followed, we shall perceiue there is no contradiction therein. For Solomon doth not graunt vnto the riche that he doeth well, when he doeth assure himselfe so much in his riches, as to esteeme them his strong castle: only he doeth dis∣couer and open the affections and thoughtes of the rich which doth reioyce and trust in his worldly goodes. Nowe hee setteth downe a threatning, whereby hee sheweth that it is vanitie and foolishnes to trust in riches, and that they shall not preserue the vngodly from destruction, when God shall powre foorth his wrath vpon them to destroy them. That his threatening is not vaine, wee may knowe, first of al by this, that in the dayes of Noe, through the great abun∣dance of riches they eate and dranke: but their goods saued them Luke. 17. 27. 28. Esay. 13. & 14. Iere. 25. 1. Esdras. 1. 1. Dan. 5. 30. Luke. 16. 23. not from the flood. Likewise in the dayes of Lot. The riches of the Babilonians did nothing preuaile them, neither did it keepe & saue them from the destruction of the Medes and Persians. Long time before whiles they were yet in glory and magnificence, and that they made al quake before thē, the Prophets did foretel the day of the Lordes wrath, which was to come, and according vnto their saying, it came to passe: as may bee seene in Esdras, and Daniel. The
rich man, as recordeth Saint Luke, went to hell. The Psalme 49. sheweth wel that riches shal not profite in the day of wrath. And therfore he doeth exhorte vs, not to trust in oppression, nor in rob∣bery: Psal. 62. 10. Be not vaine: if riches increase, set not your hart thereon. And our Lorde saieth, Take heede and beware of couetousnesse, &c. The riches then of the wicked shal not profit, but shal turne Luke. 12. 15. to their losse and destruction: as they are threatened, Goe too now yee rich men: weepe and houle on the wretchednesse that shal come Iam. 5. 1. 2. 3. vpon you. I speake expresly of the wicked: for of them doeth Solo∣mon speake: as he doth shew by the day of wrath, which shal fal vpon them, and not vpon the righteous. For the day of the Lorde shal come as a theefe in the night. Likewise the substance of the 1. The. 5. 2. 3. righteous, wherewith they shal haue made them friendes and trea∣sures in heauen, shal not bee vnprofitable vnto them, when GOD shal declare his wrath, and execute his vengeance vpon the wicked: but their good deedes shal come in remembrance before God. So∣lomon Mat. 25. 34. also doeth wel shewe it, when hee setteth heere righteous∣nesse against riches, and deliuerance from death, against the day of wrath: and that hee saieth, but righteousnesse deliuereth from death. Heere according as the Antithesis requireth, wee wil take righteousnesse for the conscience of man which is righteous and vpright, whereby man abhorreth fraude and deceite, spoyling, op∣pression and extortion, iniurie and wrong, al iniquitie and wicked∣nesse: and doeth in no wise desire to doe wrong vnto his neighbor, what pouertie or miserie soeuer hee suffereth: but if hee haue wherewith, hee is readie to distribute of it, and to helpe the neces∣sitie of his poore neighbours, not as by constraint with griefe and heauinesse, but liberally with ioye, such righteousnesse shal deliuer a man from death: for God wil remember it. When we thus speake Psal. 112. 6. 2. Cor. 9. 9. we doe not attribute righteousnes to workes to deserue life before God: for we bring workes, and drawe them out of a pure and right conscience, as out of a wel, whose spring and roote is fayth. For ex∣cept that a man be assured that God loueth him, and that he wil not suffer him to want, but wil giue him sufficient, he cannot haue such a conscience: but before al other thinges hee hath temporal gaine, or worldly honor in estimation, and careth not though he doth wrong
vnto his neighbours. It is enough for him that he come to the ende of his enterprise and obteine his desire: but the certentie and assu∣rance that wee haue of the goodnesse, power, and prouidence of God, doeth frame the conscience after such sort, that a man loueth rather to suffer hurt, then to bee an offence, or to doe any other hurt, or hinderance vnto his neighbours, he will rather reioyce to see his owne taken away from him, then to doe wrong to any o∣ther, after the example of the good seruantes of God, of whome the Apostle speaketh, Ye suffered with ioy the spoyling of your goods, &c. Now that the same proccedeth of faith, hee sheweth, saying, Heb. 10. 34. knowing in yourselues howe that yee haue in heauen a better, and an enduring substance. And by following this righteousnesse, we 35 are deliuered from death, hee doeth shewe it, when hee doeth ex∣hort, saying, Cast not away therefore your confidence which hath &. 38 great recompence of rewarde, And also when hee alledgeth out of the Prophet, that the iust shal liue by faith. When wee haue so ma∣ny faithful witnesses which doe alledge vnto vs that righteous∣nesse doeth deliuer from death, let vs not desire to followe the wic∣ked, which prosper, as it seemeth by their riches: for they shall not endure: but let vs followe iustice and equitie, and we shall liue eter∣nally: not by our merites, but because God is true in his promises. For to looke for the same goodnesse in true righteousnesse, we haue neede of patience: And by this meanes wee shalbee partakers of these promises: as saith the Apostle, For you haue need of patience: that after you haue doone the wil of God, you may receiue the pro∣mise. Heb. 10. 36. Wee see heere that the Papistes haue nothing for to build their merites nor free wil vpon: for seeing that it commeth of faith, it is the gift of God, the which maketh in vs both the will and the deed, euē of his good pleasure. Euen so there is nothing for to esta∣blishe Phi. 2. 13. the opinion of those which aske the libertie of the fleshe: for righteousnesse worketh not after his fantasie, but according too the wil of God, the which he doth declare vnto vs by his law: which is the rule of perfite righteousnesse. 5 The righteousnesse of the vpright shall direct his waye: but the wicked shall fall in his owne wickednesse.
Wee wil take righteousnesse heere, as wee did in the former sen∣tence: that is to say, for a right and sounde conscience. This righ∣teousnesse is not founde in the wicked, dissemblers and hypocrites, in deceiuers and lyars, in flatterers and slaunderers, in theeues and vsurers: but it is proper vnto a righteous man, who walketh in in∣tegritie, suche is declared vnto vs. Psal. 15. Likewise Solomon doeth attribute it vnto the vpright: and also hee denieth closely that it doeth not apperteine vnto the wicked. For to shewe the profite of this righteousnesse, hee hath saide heere before that it shall diliuer from death: wherevpon followeth that the perfect, right and iust Eze. 3. 21. &. 18. 5. &. 33. 14. man shall not dye, but liue for euer. But before that hee attaine the fruite of this life, it behoueth the perfect man to bee a Pilgrime in this worlde, and to walke in pathes which are not without great difficulties, and lets greatly painefull, the which man of himself can∣not ouerpasse, in such wise that oftentimes hee is tempted to for∣sake his way, and to wander vp and downe fieldes, and to enter in∣to the brode way which leadeth to destruction. He is (I say) temp∣ted through the straightes that hee meeteth withall, the which hap∣pen from diuers partes: for in this way hee is besieged and assaul∣ted of the Diuell, by the worlde, and of his owne fleshe, not onely weake, but also malicious. But his righteousnesse, his perfect and vpright conscience shal ouercome al these difficulties, and shal passe ouer and escape al these stoppes: for by the guiding thereof the per∣fect man shalbee strong in our Lorde. Hee shal fight by faith and hope (the guides and gouernours of his conscience) against the worlde, and shall ouercome it. For albeit that hee shalbe greatly tempted to leaue his way for to followe the wicked which prosper, and in this life take their pleasures, delightes, & ease, that they may bee partakers: yet is hee not carried away by suche temptation, but going forwarde in goodnesse hee is pleased and satisfied with the blessing of God, as it is saide in the 37. Psalme. Also though the worlde doe mocke, hate and persecute him, yet careth hee not for it nor feareth it: but putteth his trust in the Lorde, which hath po∣wer in heauen & in earth, he prayeth, Lord, leade me in thy righte∣ousnesse. And trusting to bee heard, & to obteine his request, hee Psal. 5. 8. Psa. 18 30. Psal. 27. 1. saith, The way of God is vncorrupt, &c. The Lorde is my light, whome shall I feare? The Lorde is the strength of my life, of whom
shal I bee afraide. The Lorde himselfe doeth teache thus too fight, and to bee assured, saying, If the world hate you, knowe that it ha∣ted mee before you. Againe, And yee nowe therfore are in sor∣rowe: Iohn. 15. 18. Iohn. 16. 22. but I will see you againe, and your heartes shal reioyce, and your ioy shal no man take away. As touching the fleshe, which la∣boureth by his affections and vnbrideled lustes, to make and holde him the slaue or seruant of sinne, to make him goe astray, stumble and fall for to kill him, hee hath no care to fulfill the lustes thereof, neither doeth hee suffer sinne to reigne. In this sorte, hee maketh straight his waies, and taketh away all stops and lets: there shall nothing let him to come vnto life, neither will hee doe this onely for himselfe, but also for his neighbours, to the ende that through his euill life, hee shoulde not turne them away, and be vn∣to them a slaunder and destruction. Solomon doeth signifie this same vnto vs in fewe wordes, when hee saith, The righteousnesse of the vpright shall direct his way. In this place Solomon ta∣keth direction, for making straight, and comming, for to take away all stoppes and lettes which hinder and hold vs from walking at our ease, and to attaine the place whether wee goe, without hurt. In this very signification it is taken, when Dauid saith, Make thy way plaine before my face. This may bee so vnderstoode by that which Psal. 5. 8. goeth before: for hauing saide, But I wil come into thine house in the multitude of thy mercies, and in thy feare will I worship to∣warde thy holy temple (and heereby declaring the great desire that hee had to serue God according to his ordinance: for too obteine according to his desire the which of himselfe he coulde not enioy) hee prayeth, Leade, mee O Lorde, in thy righteousnesse: hee alled∣geth the difficulties and stoppes, saying, Because of mine enimies: afterwardes he declareth it more at large, when he saith, For there is no constancie in their mouth, &c. It is also thus taken: The voice crieth in the wildernesse, Prepare yee the way of the Lorde: make straight in the desarte, a path for our God, Euery valley shal-be exalted, and euery mountaine and hil shalbee made lowe: and the crooked shall bee streight, and the rough places plaine. The Esay. 40. 3. 4. Prophete doeth shew it, when hee saith, I will goe before thee, & make the croked wayes straight, &c. Esay. 45. 2. Besides this, that wee learne this signification by the places a∣fore
alledged, Solomon doth shewe heere, that it must be so taken▪ nowe against righteousnesse, hee setteth wickednesse; and against the vpright man, the wicked; and against direction, he setteth fal∣ling, saying: But the wicked shall fall in his owne wickednesse. Al∣beit the cleane contrary appeare to outward sight, and to the carnal sense, and that the Scripture doeth beare witnesse of the prosperity of the wicked, saying, For there are no bandes in their death, but they are lustie and strong: but it is of no continuance, the Prophet Psal. 73. 4. Dauid doeth witnesse in the same Psalme. For hauing conside∣red their ende, he sayth, Surely thou hast set them in slippery places, verse. 18. and castest them downe into desolation. Beholde hee shall tra∣uel with wickednesse: for he hath conceaued mischiefe, but he shal Psal. 7. 15. &. 16. Psal. 9. 16. bring foorth a lye. Hee hath made a pit and digged it, and is fallen into the pit that hee hath made. Againe, The wicked is snared in the worke of his owne handes. But though the wicked deser∣ueth to fall through his wickednesse, because it commeth of him∣selfe and is his owne doeing, (for Solomon setteth his wickednes against the righteousnesse of the perfect man) yet the perfect man doeth not deserue by his righteousnes to haue his way directed to winne eternal ioy and felicitie. This iustice is not properly his owne, but it is the gift of God, that worketh in vs both will and the deede euen of his good pleasure. Not that wee are sufficient Phil. 2. 13 2. Cor. 3. 5. of ourselues, to thinke any thing as of ourselues: but our suffici∣encie is of God. For I knowe nothing by my selfe, yet am I not thereby iustified. A good and perfite conscience then doeth not 1. Cor. 4. 4. iudge himselfe to bee worthie of, or to deserue any thing at the handes of God, but it holdeth it selfe assured, and is stayed vppon the grace of God. Beloued, if our heart condemne vs not, then haue wee boldenesse towardes God, and whatsoeuer wee aske, wee 1. Iohn. 3. 21 receiue of him, because wee keepe his commandementes, and doe those things which are pleasant in his sight. And in this bold∣nesse it is giuen vnto thinges which are pleasaunt vnto GOD: as it is shewed before in the two and twentieth verse. The righteousnesse then of the perfect man shall direct his way, be∣cause that beeing vnseparably ioyned together with faith, it is guided thereby vprightly to followe the will of GOD accor∣ding
vnto his most holy woorde. 6 The righteousnesse of the iust shall deliuer them: but the transgressours shall bee taken in their owne wickednesse. When wee are in a plaine and eeuen way, that is not crooked, nor vneasie: and also wee take good heede where wee step and set our feete: what snares soeuer are laid therein, may easily bee per∣ceiued, and escaped with lesse hurt: euen so as wee haue seene, the righteousnesse of the perfect man doeth direct his way. Albeit then that they lay snares in diuers sorts, to catch and intrappe the faith∣ful and righteous, and though they bee strongly assaulted: yet foras∣much as their righteousnesse doeth make plaine and direct their way, they escape, and are deliuered, in such wise that they auoyd the threateninges of God, they haue a good issue of their temptations, and ouercome all persecutions. Noe escaped the flood, wherewith God had threatened the worlde sixe score yeere before. Lot was not comprehended in the ouerthrowe of Sodome, though he dwelt in the mids thereof, the which God did foreshewe vnto Abraham. Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lorde deliuereth Psal. 34. 19. 1. Cor. 10. 13 2. Pet. 2. 9. them out of al. God is faithfull, which will not suffer you to bee tempted aboue that you bee able to beare, &c. The Lord knoweth to deliuer the godly out of temptation, &c. Also though the persecutours doe take away these temporal goods, and kill the body: yet wee escape safe out of their handes, when they can doe nothing to the soule: but for the worldly and transitory goods, wee obteine heauenly, and eter∣nal, for a shorte life, and ful of miserie, wee shall liue in eternall felicitie. It is as though the righteousnesse of the iust shoulde deliuer them. But yet let vs not attribute our deliueraunce vnto our righteousnesse, as ours properly: but let vs knowe and con∣fesse that it is a singular gift of GOD through Iesus Christe. For yee are of him in Iesus Christe. And because that this iustice 1. Cor. 1. 30. 2. Cor. 5. 20 is giuen and imputed vnto vs, the Scripture counteth it ours. For hee hath made him to bee sinne for vs, which knewe no sinne, that
wee shoulde bee made the righteousnesse of God in him. Albeit then that the holy Scripture doeth attribute righteousnesse vn∣to vs, and also all felicitie and eternal prosperitie therevnto: yet let vs not thinke that it either magnifieth vs or our workes, or our po∣wer, or our free will: but it confesseth that God wil suffer his gra∣ces and giftes to bee lost, but doth make them to bring foorth good fruite, which remaine for euer. Thus doeing hee rewardeth his gifts and graces in his faithful seruantes, encreasing gift vppon gift, and grace after grace. Solomon doeth shewe it wel, when hee doth at∣tribute vnto righteousnesse the guiding, and directing of the way, and deliuerance. Let him therefore which reioyceth, reioyce in the Lorde: as Ieremie saith, O Lorde, I knowe, that the way of man is not in himselfe, neither is it in man to walke and direct his steppes. Iere. 10. 23. Iere. 31. 18. Ezec. 36. 27. Againe hee prayeth, Conuert thou mee, and I shall bee conuerted. Againe, Ezechiel saith, And I wil put my spirite within you, and cause you to walke in my statutes, and yee shall keepe my iudge∣mentes and doe them. In this sort, we wil walke and gouerne our¦selues in a sounde conscience, righteousnesse and vprightnesse: by the which wee wil so direct our wayes, that wee shal not goe astray to bee lost for euer, but shal escape al dangers: albeit that it seeme vnto the eyes of the wicked, and to the feeling of the fleshe, that wee bee miserable, and vtterly vndoone and lost without remedie. Contrarily, the wicked and vnfaithful which haue no feare nor re∣uerence of God, which haue no hope in his goodnesse and trueth, nor no humanitie or faithfulnesse towardes their neighbours, doe nowe glory and reioyce in their vngodlinesse, malice, wronges, and cruelties, wherein they walke without feeling of conscience, and therein are very quicke and sharpe, and thinke wel that they shal remaine vnpunished, and shal enioy their wishe and desire: the which for to attaine and enioy, they vse subtilties and craftie dealing, maliciousnesse and crueltie, and doe settle and assure themselues therein. But they are greatly deceiued: for they shall pe∣rishe through their owne euil, by the whiche they thought to mainteine themselues. Solomon hath alreadie pronounced it, in the thirde and fifth verses: and nowe againe hee saieth, But the transgressours shalbe taken in their owne wickednesse.
The Psalmist saieth, But malice shal slay the wicked. What malici∣ousnesse then, or crueltie soeuer that the wicked and vnfaithful doe Psal. 34. 21. inuent, yet the perfit and vpright men, which haue sounde conscien∣ces, and doe not ymagine any thing, either against the honour of God, or against the profite and saluation of their neighbours, ought not to bee afraide nor doute whither they shal escape out of their wicked enterprises: seeing that the faithful in al times haue expe∣rimented and tried the helpe and succours of God, and his mightie deliuerance: seeing also (that which is the chiefest) that God who cannot lye, hath promised it, as the scripture doth often witnesse. 7 When a wicked man dyeth, his hope perisheth, & the hope of the vniust shal perish. There is no man in this worlde but liueth in some hope, the which we al shewe foorth by the woorke wherevnto we apply our¦selues, and by the counsels and purposes that we intende and by the enterprises that we take in hande. For except wee tende to some ende, and do looke for some gaine of our works which should con∣tinew and bring some profite, delite, honour or glory, wee shoulde be negligent, and not careful to apply ourselues to something. True it is, that sometimes wee wil busie ourselues about some woorke, and wil take in hande some enterprise without hauing respect to the ende: but in pursuing the thing, wee conceiue some hope which maketh that man is more diligent about his woorke: and because hee hopeth wel of his woorke, his harte and stomake increaseth and hee goeth forewarde the more earnestly and with greater affe∣ction. Nowe as the woorkes are diuers, and the purposes and the enterprises also, and that there are both good and bad, and that by the good wee tende vnto a good ende, and by the euil vnto an euil end: and that the one cometh of a good desire, & sounde consciēce, and so is wel ruled, and the other from mallice and frowarde con∣science and thereby is peruerse and misgouerned: euen so also the ende thereof is contrarie: the one sorte obteine according to their hope, and the other are void of their expectation. Solomon hath shewed it vs here aboue in the 10. chap. & in the 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29.
and 30. verses. And nowe speaking of them which are voide of their hope, he saieth, when a wicked man dyeth, his hope perisheth, &c. The first parte of this threatening may haue twoo meanings, and both true. For first of al, when the wicked doe see themselues to prosper in this worlde, they delight and reioyce in themselues, they promise vnto themselues perpetual felicitie, and doe brag and boast so much as they can, hoping that al shal goe wel for them, and that no euil shal happen vnto them. Dauid saieth, For the wicked hath made boast of his owne hearts desire, and the couetous blesseth Psal. 10. 3. Psalm. 9. 17. Wisd. 5. 14. himselfe: but they feele the contrarie, as Dauid saith, The wicked shal turne into hel. And thus it is true that the hope of the wicked shal perish, when hee dyeth. The hope of the vngodly is like the dust that is blowne away with the winde, and like a thinne some that is scattered abroade with the storme, and as the smoke, which is dis∣persed with the winde, and as the remembrance of him passeth, that tarieth but for a day. Secondly, when the wicked is migh∣tie in credit, in autoritie, in riches, in Lordships, and in other things which are esteemed of in this world, many do set in foote to com∣mende him and flatter him: euery man laboureth to doe him ser∣uice and to graunt his requestes: euery man boweth and humbleth himselfe before him, and are at his commandement: for they hope to winne something by him. The flatterers which were in king Sauls court, which serued him in persecuting of Dauid, and incou∣raged him theretoo, hoped greatly that Saule would do them good, and promote them vnto honour: & thought not that Saule should so soone haue beene taken away: but the miserable ende of Saule hath made them voyde of their hope. Also al their like doe prooue that when the wicked dyeth, that the hope they had doeth perish. This is an ordinarie thing, and therefore it hath no neede of pro∣bation. These twoo interpretations are true, as hath beene said, but to the ende that we shoulde not be compelled to say that Solomon vseth heere a rehearsing, wee wil choose the seconde sense for the meetest, to the ende that of the present sentence wee might make thereof twoo contrary partes. And for the seconde which is, also that the hope of the vniust shal perish. Wee will apply the first, after this sorte, that the wicked doe not come to the
ende of their enterprises as they desire and hope, but receiue the contrary, whereby they are confounded: and so their hope peri∣sheth, and this is chiefly in death, wherein they shall remaine and bee vndoone for euer. For to shewe that it cannot otherwise hap∣pen, and that the wicked must needes bee frustrate and voide of their hope, Solomon vseth a Verbe which doeth not signifie that which is or shalbee doone, but that which is already doone: & thus it doth signifie vnto vs, that we shoulde thinke the thing to bee lost, which wee cannot obteine, and whereof there comes no good end. For if wee will giue the Verbe according to his time, wee shall say that the hope of the wicked is lost and gone. And by this word we may say that Solomon doth signifie, that God doth not alwayes tary vntill death, to confound the wicked by making them void of their hope: as also it is the trueth, and diuers haue prooued it true and do still feele it: as it is very expedient, for the rest and tranquilitie of the seruantes, and children of God. Againe, wee haue not said, that it is onely referred vntil death. But chiefly Pharao looked surely too Exo. 1. 1. King. 12. Esay. 3. 6. Dan. 4. holde the children of Israel in bondage, so did Roboam also, Zenna∣cherib, and Nabuchodonosar. They which inuent and striue against the Gospel, and doe persecute the faithful from this life, they loose their hope, and shall loose the same in death, except they come to repentance, and that they settle their hope more stedfast. Saint Paul whē he persecuted the Christiās, lost his hope for this life: the which was helthful vnto him, they which haue receiued the interim, haue hope to obteine a counsel which shall refourme all errours. They haue beene for a certaine yeeres put off: GOD, for his mer∣cy sake, put them off stil, to the ende that they shoulde returne for to consider from whence they are fallen, and that they shoulde change their hope. 8 The righteous escapeth out of trouble, and the wicked shall come in his steede. For to establishe right iudgement, wee must not iudge according to the sight of our eyes, nor after that that we see happen dayly: o∣therwise we shold esteeme the righteous to be most wicked, & the most vngodly should be in our opiniō the best people. But we must
take heede, to that which God pronounceth, and if wee iudge after his sentence, wee shalbe righteous iudges. Nowe hee excepteth not the righteous man from troubles, as may bee seene both by ex∣amples and by witnesses which haue beene already alledged: but in diuers places he promiseth to deliuer the faithful man from misery and calamitie. Solomon after the Psalmist and others, doth giue vs witnesse thereof, when hee saith, The righteous escapeth out of trouble. As the holy scripture doth not determine the time, so ought wee not too assesse special iudgement vpon this man or that man: but we must be certaine, that if we walke vprightly, and in sound∣nesse of cōscience, and that we be patient in aduersitie (how long & harde soeuer they seeme vnto vs) that at time conuenient wee shal-be deliuered. For yee haue neede of patience, that after yee haue doone Heb. 10. 36. the wil of God, yee might receiue the promise. The iust doth not alwayes escape tribulation, but it taken out of the worlde. Con∣trarily what prosperitie soeuer we haue in this worlde, howe long soeuer it be, yet if we walke with an euil conscience, we cānot looke but for misery and calamitie. This is that which Solomon meaneth, when he saith, But the wicked commeth in his place: as if hee saide, the righteous which was counted vnhappy and miserable through the trouble that op∣pressed him, doeth escape the same, and is placed happily: and the wicked which did oppresse him, falleth into the misery wherein he laboured to bring and to keepe the iust: and so hee commeth in his place. When Solomon calleth trouble the place of the righteous, it is not to say, that the righteous haue deserued trouble (though wee bee all worthie to be afflicted, not onely with temporal sorrow, but with perpetuall torments, if God shoulde enter into iudgement with vs) but hee meaneth the wicked (which thinke to yeelde vn∣to the righteous that which hee needeth, when hee troubleth and molesteth him) shall at the last come into the same ranck and order, and shall not escape: as it is declared of Herode, Acts the 12. Chap∣ter. Wee may also say that in his place, after the language of So∣lomon, importeth as much as for him, or aboue him: as if Solomō woulde say, that the wicked shall come into trouble for the iust, whome hee hath oppressed, or in steede that he laboured to subdue
the righteous, he shalbe placed aboue him, and the wicked shalbee as the footestoole of the righteous. The first sense is true: so are these two last. For it is a righteous thing with God, to recompense 2. Thes. 1. 6. tribulation to them that trouble you. We may see also in diuers pla∣ces that God threateneth, and punisheth the wicked for the righte∣ous, Mala. 5. 3. Psal. 47. 4 Psal. 49. 14 and that the wicked are set vnder the iust. The victories that God hath giuen vnto his people of Israel against the infidels, haue bin a figure therof: when truly it is said, They lie like sheepe in the graue: death deuoureth them, and the righteous shal haue domina∣tion ouer them in the morning. This same shalbe thus done, be∣cause the iust are members of Iesus Christ. But to the end, that none should presume of his owne worthines and excellencie, of his owne power or cunning, (because it is saide, the iust escapeth from trou∣ble, and also it seemeth at the first sight, that Solomon doeth attri∣bute some vertue vnto the iust, as if hee did drawe himselfe out of Psal. 110. 1 miserie: let vs know that Solomon vseth here a verbe passiue: wher∣by hee signifieth that it is by an other, that the righteous escapeth: and truely we are like vnto a litle birde taken in the net, the which can not escape, except some other breake the net. For this cause we must humbly confesse it, If the Lord had not bene on our side, when Psal. 124. 1 men rose vp against vs, they had then swallowed vs vp quicke. But the wicked doeth wel deserue trouble, neither ought the fault to be imputed to any other then to himself: for it is he which falleth in∣to it of his owne proper malice. 9 An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous shalbe deliuered by knowledge. The worlde doeth so flowe with hypocrites, that the Scripture doubteth not to accuse al the bodie of the people of God, of hypo∣pocrisie. For euerie one is an hypocrite and wicked, and euery Esai. 9. 17. mouth speaketh follie. Now if the people of God is such, what is the rest of the world? For whereas there is no true knowledge of God, where his feare hath no place, and men wil be wel counted of, and iudged honest men, there must needes al bee filled with hypocrisie, fraude, and vnfaithfulnes. Whereupon it foloweth, that there are but fewe people which doe not hurte their neighbours with their
mouthes. As Solomon sayeth, The hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour. &c. Heere Solomon compareth the mouth of the hypocrite vnto a sworde, or an instrument wherewith men craftily vse to hurt their neighbour, before he can take heede. And herein he sheweth, howe dangerous the hypocrites are, and howe carefully we ought to take heede of them, to the ende that we may escape their snares, and not to suffer any hurt by them. Wee shal haue the care required hereunto, if by right knowledge of the truth wee reiect al wickednes, and abhorre the same: and do loue righ∣teousnes, giuing ourselues to doe well. Solomon doeth shewe it vs, saying, But the righteous shalbe deliuered by knowledge. In al estates, there is some hypocrisie, as wee may see, but too much: but the most dangerous, is the same of false Prophetes, which come in sheepes clothing, and by their lying and false doctrine, and by their long prayers, they bring temporal hurt, deuouring widowes houses, & which worst is, they shut vp the kingdome of heauen from men. And therefore our Lord exhorteth earnestly his Apostles Luke. 12. 1 to looke diligently to themselues for falling into it. And foras∣much as God suffereth no hurte whereby wee haue laboured too hurt our neighbours to goe vnpunished, let vs know that the war∣ning which Solomō giueth, doth cōteine a priuie & secrete threate∣ning, whereby hee foresheweth vnto the hypocrites their destru∣ction, to the ende that wee shoulde knowe that their faire shewe of holynesse and religion, is abhominable before God: as our Lorde Mat. 7. 21. also sheweth vs, Euery one that saith vnto me, Lord, Lorde, shal not enter into the kingdome of heauen. Nowe as they goe to destructi∣on, euen so if we suffer ourselues to be deceiued by them, wee shal perish also: for if the blinde leade the blinde, both fal in the ditche. Wherfore we must stand vpon our watch, as Solomon teacheth vs, Mat. 15. 14. & as we haue already touched, whē he saith, but the righteous shalbe deliuered by knowledge. If in soūdnes of consciēce we labour to walke vprightly, as the word doeth teache vs, what assaultes soeuer the hypocrites doe giue vs, yet shal they not hurte vs. Solo∣mon doeth thus promise vs: But though there bee but fewe that enioy this promise, and though the hypocrites doe much hurte, wee neede meruaile thereat. For there is an infinite number
of hypocrites, and the righteous and they which haue true know∣ledge, are almost none, and yet the goodnes they haue is not theirs. Now forasmuch as there is none righteous, but so farre as it pleaseth God of his grace to iustifie and accept him for righteous, imputing vnto him the righteousnes of our Lorde Iesus Christ: and though wee knowe nothing but so farre as the Lord teacheth vs by his ho∣ly Spirite, giuing vs the true vnderstanding of his holie worde, and therby regenerating and renewing vs: it foloweth, that if we escape the danger of hypocrites, that it is of the only grace and goodnes of God, and that therein is nothing of our might or power, merit or free will. Wherefore, it is wel required that wee should walke in humilitie, and should be diligent to aske of God, that it might please him to guide vs in righteousnes, and teache vs the same. Wee haue neede to continue in suche prayers, and chiefly against false Pro∣phets: for they are the most dangerous hypocrites. Saint Paule Psal. 5. 9. & 86. 11. Rom. 16. 17. doeth diligently warne vs of suche false hypocrites. Nowe I be∣seeche you brethren, watche diligently them which cause diuisi∣on and offences, contrarie to the doctrine which ye haue learned, and auoide them. Brethren, be ye folowers of me, and looke on Phi. 3. 17. 18 them, which walke so, as yee haue vs for an ensample. For ma∣ny walke, of whome I haue tolde you often, and nowe tell you weeping, that they are the enemies of the Crosse of Christ. Be∣ware, least there bee any man that spoyle you through Philo∣sophie, Collo. 2. 8. and vaine deceit, through the traditions of men, accor∣ding to the rudimentes of the worlde, and not after Christe, &c. 10 In the prosperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked perish, there is ioye. The prosperitie of the righteous may be taken after two sortes: first, for the ioye and prosperitie, the ease and rest, the fa∣uoure and defence, which the iust receiue and enioye by the grace and goodnesse of God. Secondly, for the helpe and suc∣cours that the righteous doe minister vnto them that haue
neede, and the faithfulnes that they vse towardes al them that they deale with, not hurting any man, but doing good to al men so much as they can. But after what sorte soeuer Solomon speaketh of the prosperitie of the righteous, whither it be of it which they do, or of that which they receiue, it seemeth, that they feele and prooue the cleane contrarie of that which he sayeth. Abraham was verie riche in Cattel, in siluer, and in golde. Hee prospered in battel against the Kings which had taken his cosen Lot captiue, &c. And as, God did Gen. 13. 2 & 14. 15. & 18. 3. & 21. 25. assist him, so was he ready also to do wel. The deliuering of Lot doth witnesse it, & the hospitalitie vsed to the Angels, &c. And yet wher∣as he arriued, they enioyed not the same, as may be knowne by the two rauishments of his wife: and by that, that the seruants of A∣bimelech had violently taken away a Wel of water. Lot was riche and dwelt in Sodome, and yet did wel, as witnesseth his hospitali∣tie: Gen. 13. 5. Gen. 19. 1 2. Pet. 7. 8. and albeit hee was righteous, yet the citie did not enioy the same. And nowe there is no people that are so muche and so cru∣elly pursued in al countries, cities and villages as are the righteous. Therefore iudgement is turned backewarde, and iustice standeth Esay. 59. 14 farre of: for trueth is fallen in the streete, and equitie cannot en∣ter. And if the righteous labour to helpe their neigbours after their power, and to bee a good ensample, they are iudged to bee hypo∣crites and ambitious. Euen so then it seemeth that the citie doeth not reioyce at the prosperitie of the righteous. If they bee riche, they are enuied therefore, and if it bee possible they shalbe spoyled thereof: If they would make any riche, they are iudged, they would be seene of men, & be praised and honored therfore. For to answere this, let vs first know that after this present Antithesis or compari∣son, wherein the prosperitie of the righteous is set against the de∣struction of the wicked, wee must take the prosperitie in the first signification. Secondly there is no rule so general but that there is some exception: or else that Solomon doeth heere take the Ci∣tie for chiefe and best part thereof, which are the honest people dwelling therein, which desire and seeke the peace and pros∣peritie of the righteous, and are glad when the righteous doe wel, and bee voyde of trouble, or else, better to speake, and more agreeing with the Antithesis (seing that God reioyceth not at the destruction of the wicked, as hee witnesseth, and that
the children of God for to folowe their heauenly Father, ought not to reioyce at the perdition of the wicked) we wil take reioycing, and also the crie of ioye, for the cause that bringeth them foorth. Wee Eze. 18. 23 & 33. 11. Luk. 15. 4 doe not willingly reioyce at our euil successe and losse, but when our affaires doe prosper wel, then it causeth vs to reioyce and to sing for ioy. Solomō therfore meaneth, that the citie is happy & blessed, whē the righteous doe prosper in the midst thereof: and yet more hap∣pie, when the wicked are rooted out of it: as Solomon doeth signi∣fie it when hee is not contented to say there is ioye, but hee sayeth, there is a crie or song of ioy. This is after a sorte shewed vs, when God promiseth Abraham that hee wil not destroy Sodome, if there Gen. 18. 32. may be founde tenne righteous in the midst of it. If then wee desire that our Citie should prosper and be happie, and that for the happi∣nesse and prosperitie it doeth reioyce, wee must studie and be giuen to righteousnes, and worke, so much as wee can, that the righteous may dwel without any trouble, without contempt, and also with∣out persecution: and not to hinder nor turne them away from do∣ing their duetie. As touching the rest, for to take our profite of this present sentence, and of the exposition thereof, we must beware of trusting and leaning vppon our owne diligence, but rather that by Fayth wee looke vnto God, who teacheth vs by his worde, that it is he onely which prouideth good Magistrates and rulers, and he a∣lone that ruleth countries and Cities. And thus if we wil reioyce at the prosperitie of our countrie, we must wishe and desire the good successe and aduancement of the righteous: and forasmuche as it is a worke depending vpon the prouidence of God, wee must pray vn∣to him that it would please him to raise vp iust and righteous men, and to make them goe forwarde, and to prosper them in the vocati∣on whereunto hee hath called them, and that he would hinder and stoppe the wicked from comming forward, and to roote out them which goe forward. 11 By the blessing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is subuerted by the mouth of the wicked. Forasmuch as Solomon setteth here the blessing of the righte∣ous against the mouth of the wicked, it is not needeful to examine
after howe many sortes blessing is taken in the Scriptures, for the vnderstanding of this place. For the Antithesis doeth shew vs that Solomon by the blessing, meaneth the gratiousnes and goodnes that proceedeth from the mouth. The righteous out of their good trea∣sures, doe bring foorth good things: they gladly folowe the counsel of Saint Paule: Let no corrupt communication proceede out of your mouthes: but that which is good, to the vse of edifying, that it may minister grace vnto the hearers. And bee yee not drunke Ephe. 4. 29 & 5. 18. 19 Col. 3. 16. & 4. 6. with wine, wherein is excesse but be ye filled with the Spirite, speaking vnto yourselues in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spiritu∣all songes, &c. Againe, Let the worde of Christe dwell in you plenteously, in al wisedome, teaching and admonishing your owne selues, in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall songes, &c. Let your speeche bee gracious alwayes, and seasoned with salt, that yee may know howe to answere euerie man. If any man speake, 1. Pet. 4. 11 let him speake as the wordes of God. The blessing therefore of the righteous standeth in good counsels, in holie exhortations and corrections, in vnfayned prayers, in prayse and thankesgiuing, proceeding from a good and pure affection of the heart. By this blessing the Citie is exalted, as Solomon sayeth, and also as ex∣perience sheweth. Egypt was exalted by the counsel of Ioseph: for Gen. 41. 33 insteede to be suppressed and consumed by famine, it had prouision to sustaine it selfe, and therewith it was the refuge of other poore hungrie starued people, and chiefly of the housholde of Iacob. The children of Israel were in great distresse, and were mightily oppres∣sed Exo. 1. 11. by the cruel bondage that Pharao layde vppon them: but by the counsels, exhortations, prayers, and supplications of Moyses and Aaron, they were so preserued and exalted, that they were made victors and conquerers ouer them that had oppressed them: they robbed them, and escaped out of their handes: they were sa∣ued by the redde sea, through the which they went with drie foote, but their enemies were ouerwhelmed and drowned in the bottome thereof. So long as the children of Israel woulde beleeue the coun∣sels of their good Iudges and Kinges, and woulde receiue and fol∣lowe the doctrine, admonitions and corrections, and trembled at, and feared the threatenings of the Prophets, they were preserued
and exalted: for they were deliuered from their enemies, and made conquerers. The Ecclesiastes or Preacher sayeth: I haue also seene Eccle. 9. 13. 14. 15. 16. this wisedome vnder the sunne, and it is great vnto mee. A little Citie, and fewe men in it, and a great King came against it, and compassed it about, and builded fortes against it: And there was founde therein a poore and wise man, and hee deliuered the Citie by his wisedome. Nowe that by wisedome, hee meaneth the words spoken wisely, it is manifest by this that hee sayeth, That the wis∣dome of the poore wise man was despised, and his words not heard. Wee had al deserued by our sinne to bee oppressed with eternall damnation, but when by Fayth and repentaunce, wee haue recei∣ued the doctrine of the Gospel, which is the chiefe part of the bles∣sing Ephe. 2. 6. of the righteous, we haue bene exalted vp into heauen. We see then how profitable, yea & necessarie it is, to heare and olow them which speake rightly: and that Solomon sayeth the trueth, when hee pronounceth that the Citie is exalted, &c. euen when it re∣ceiueth quietly the blessing. Noe was righteous, and nothing spa∣red Hebr. 11. 7 2. Pet. 2. 5. Gen. 19. 2. his worde, in admonishing, reproouing, threatening, and con∣demning the worlde by the building of the arke: and is called the eight person, a Preacher of righteousnes, and yet the worlde was not exalted, &c. Iust Lot, both with sight and hearing exhorted di∣ligently the Sodomites, and rebuked them, and yet they were not exalted, &c. The most righteous, and righteous of al other, our Lorde Iesus Christe spared not his blessing, but bestowed it both in words & miracles, which were the destruction of many vnfayth∣ful and indurate. Then began he to rebuke the Cities wherein ma∣ny of his miracles had bene done. &c. The like we may see nowa∣dayes, in diuers places. We must therefore vnderstande, that the Citie which with feare and reuerence receiueth the blessing of the righteous, shalbe exalted therby, that is to say, it shal obteine peace, rest, and felicitie, and shal remaine firme & stable for euer, though the world iudge otherwise. Contrarily, if wee giue eare to the wicked, and delight in theyr speaking, wee runne to destuc∣tion: as Solomon sheweth, saying, But it is subuerted by the mouthe of the wicked. The children of Israel haue often tried it in the wildernesse, and
after when they were come into the lande of Canaan. They which giue credite vnto Mahomet and to the Pope, haue their part therin: so haue they also which haue receiued the blasphemous interim. The leasings, flattering speeches, slanderings, idle and wanton wordes, and filthie communication bring great destruction: but in the meane while, the gates of hell cannot preuaile against them that are builded vpon the rocke. Mat. 16. 18. 12 Hee that despiseth his neighbour, is destitute of wise∣dome: but a man of vnderstanding wil keepe si∣lence. Wee count a man to be verie couragious, and to haue an vp∣right and stout heart, when hee goeth boldly forwarde with his en∣terprise, be it right or wrong, not caring for any man, and without feare of offending, and is readie to beare iniuries and wronges, dis∣praise, and diffamation, reproches, and cauillations, violences and cruelties, if it appeare vnto him, that he cannot otherwise come to the ende of his purpose and enterprise. This is the iudgement of the carnal, and worldlings, which thinke that their neighbours doe no∣thing belong vnto them. But if by the worde of God wee beholde that wee al come from one Father Adam, wee shal knowe how we belong one vnto an other, and that wee are al one fleshe and one blood. Thus muche for the carnal coniunction, whereby wee are taught that we are faintharted, and without courage, foolishe and voide of care, vnderstanding and right iudgement, if wee despise our neighbours: and chiefly when we shewe openly the contempt, in being mooued and raising noyse and vprores vpon them, in dri∣uing them away, and reiecting them through impatiencie, or arro∣gancie, or choler. Solomon sheweth it, whē he setteth disdain against silence; and want of wisedome, vnto a man of vnderstanding: and that hee calleth him which is despised, neighbour. Nowe in his lan∣guage which hee vseth, Neighbour, signifieth him which pleaseth vs, him that wee desire, him that wee loue, and whose companie wee keepe, or hee to whome wee owe suche gentlenes, familiaritie and louing kindnesse. Whosoeuer therefore doeth despise him, doeth shewe himselfe verie weake, and wanting good wil and pure
affection: for he striueth against his nature, and doeth against that which hee oweth by right of kindred and stocke. Nowe if for the respect that we are al of one carnal parentage, it is not laweful for vs to despise our neighbours, except wee woulde haue men to iudge of vs by the woorde of God, that wee haue a faint hart: by a more strong reason, they which bragge and woulde bee counted Christi∣ans, ought wel to beware from despising their neighbours, nor giue any token of contempt, either by woordes or gesture: & that in folowing the great humilitie and modestie of their head, which Esa. 42. . wil not cry nor stand vp against them, &c. But seeing they are mem∣bers of one body, vnder one head Iesus Christ, they ought to bee careful the one for the other, without any contempt of the vilest and basest, and without enuie against the most excellent: As Saint Paul Rom. 15. 1. 1. Cor. 12. 12 Gal. 6. 1. doeth shewe it. Thus much for the spiritual parentage, in the which the coniunction is farre more straight and more neere, then is the knitting togither of carnal kindred. Wherfore, the true Christians shoulde bee very careful to mainteine this coniunction, by follow∣ing the exhortation of Saint Paule, Nowe therefore as the elect of God, holie and beloued, put on tender mercy, kindnesse, hum∣blenesse of minde, meekenes, long suffering, &c. Beholde, howe good & howe comely a thing it is, brethren to dwel euen togither. Psal. 133. 1. Esay. 2. 4. Let them mark this, fulfilled in vs, They shal breake their swords al∣so into mattockes, and their speares into sithes: nation shal not lift vp a sword against nation, neither shal they learn to fight any more. Againe, The woolfe also shal dwel with the lambe, and the Leopard & 11. 6. shal lye with the kidde and the calfe, and the Lyon, and the fat beast togither, and a little childe shal leade them. Thus doo∣ing, wee will not disdaine our neighbours, neither shalbee faintharted, but wee shalbee wise and of vnderstanding, wee shalbee quiet and peaceable, gentle and kinde: and this which Solo∣mon saith shalbe fulfilled in vs, But a man of vnderstanding wil keepe silence. The silence or secretnesse whereof Solomon speaketh standeth not in speaking neuer a word, and to be as it were dumbe: but because that in silence al things are quiet, and without noyse, without vprores, and without contention, the Scripture taketh si∣lence for peace, gentlenesse, and lowly behauiour, sweete and louing
conuersion: and also for abstinence, when we forbeare to doe any thing, and that wee abstaine from it, and that wee vexe not our¦selues, or that we bee not grieued for any thing which happeneth, and that we striue not as the amased and witles doe. Silence is so taken in some places, as foloweth: Nowe Iacob hearde that hee had Gen. 34. 5 defiled Dinah his daughter, &c. Therfore Iacob helde his peace, vn∣til they were come. The Lorde shal fight for you: therefore holde your peace. So they despised him, and brought him no presents: but Exo. 14. 14 1. Sam. 10. 27 Esa. 41. 1. Esa. 11. 2. he held his tongue. Keepe silence before mee, O Ilands, and let the people renewe their strength. &c. Nowe to bee wise, and to be thus silent, we must learne it of our Lord and receiue it from him. For on him it is that the spirite of the Lorde resteth: the spirit of wisdom and vnderstanding, the spirite of counsel and strength, the spirite of knowledge, and of the feare of the Lorde. Hee shal not faile Esa. 42. 4. nor be discouraged, til he haue set iudgement in the earth. And also hee himselfe exhorteth vs to learne of him, and promiseth rest vn∣to Mat. 11▪ 29. to our soules. 13 Hee that goeth about as a slaunderer, discouereth a se∣cret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter. There is no man but desireth to haue a priuie friend which is no talker and babler, to the ende that if hee haue any thing in his hart which doeth trouble and grieue him, that hee may safely open the same vnto his friend, & that he may be somwhat eased & relieued: hee hopeth also that that which he hath declared, shalbe kept se∣cret, or at least wise that the thing shal not be expounded otherwise then it was spoken: and that hee wil not labour to hurt him nor to bring him into hatred with his neighbour, in folowing the com∣mandement, Thou shalt not beare false witnes against thy neigh∣bour: Thou shalt not walke about with tales among thy people. Exo. 20. 16. Leu. 19. 16. There are some which thinke and beleeue, that it is not euil done to reueale secretes, to condemne their neighbours and to proclaime their imperfections: but Solomon doth condemne them, calling thē slaunderers, when hee saieth, hee that goeth about as a slaunderer,
doeth reueale a secret. And it is for good cause that such people are condemned. For first of al they are hypocrites. Secondly, they are Mat. 7. 5. transgressors of the lawe. Thirdly, they set themselues before the lawe in condemning it. Speake not euil one of another, bre∣thren. Hee that speaketh euil of his brother, or hee that con∣demneth Iam. 4. 11. his brother, speaketh euil of the lawe, and condemneth the lawe: and if thou condemnest the lawe, thou art not an obser∣uer of the lawe, but a iudge. Infidelitie and vnfaithfulnesse hath ta∣ken roote in their hartes, wherby they are led to betray their neigh∣bours, in discouering that which they ought to keepe secret. Solo∣mon sheweth this vnfaithfulnesse, when hee setteth, the faythful heart, against the slaunderer, saying, Hee that it is of a faythfull heart, conceileth a matter. Hee that inuenteth no treason against his neighbour, wil keepe his mouth that it shal not hinder his neighbour, for to publishe his imperfections, or speake leasing of him: otherwise he should not be of a faithful hart, from the aboun∣dance whereof the mouth speaketh. Solomon is not contented to say faythful simply, but addeth, of heart: not that there is any faith∣ful which are vnfaithful of heart, but it is for a more greater expres∣sion, and for to shewe vs that what fayre countenance or goodly face that we beare to our neighbours, except it proceede with good and true affection of heart, that there is none but al deceipt in vs, treason and vnfaithfulnesse, as we know it, and that our conscience doth so iudge and condemne vs, though wee labour to counterfaite and dissemble it with ourselues, & that we striue to make ourselues beleeue that we proceede faithfully, when by counterfayting wee mock our neighbors. Further let vs note, that the 2. part of this sen∣tence agreeth with the same that is conteined in the 10. chap. & 12. verse. But loue couereth al misdeeds. For if wee be not led by loue, we cannot bee faithful vnto our neighbours, for to dissemble 1. Cor. 13. 1. their imperfections: there is no strength in vs that is woorth any thing except it bee exercised by loue. Nowe if by loue wee must exercise faithfulnesse the which is set against slaunder, it foloweth that the slaunderer is ledde with hatred to discouer the secret, and consequently that hee is a murtherer. Whosoeuer hateth his brother, is a manslear. Whereof it followeth that Solomon 1. Iohn. 3. 15.
doeth closely condemne him vnto eternal death which reuealeth se∣crets. He that loueth not his brother, abydeth in death: againe, You 1. Iohn. 3. 14. &. 15. know that no manslayer hath eternal life abyding in him. Contra∣rily, wee know that we are translated from death to life in that that we loue the brethren. Yet neuerthelesse let vs not feare to be accu∣sed of slaunder, though wee accuse them which lead a slaunderous life, though wee rebuke them, reprooue and threaten them, either priuately or publikely, and though we labour to get them punished and chastened, to the ende that slaunders may bee taken away from the people of GOD, and the offenders brought againe vnto GOD by true repentance so much as wee can. Otherwise wee shoulde bee vnfaythful vnto God and to his Churche, wee shoulde Mat. 18. 17. 1. Tim. 5. 20. 2. Tim. 4. 2. bee like them which suffer the sheepe to be deuoured in sparing the woolues. Let vs knowe therefore that this sentence of Solomon ought not to hinder vs from folowing the doctrine of our Lorde, and of Saint Paule. 14 Where no counsel is, the people fal: but where many coun∣sellers are, there is health. Albeit that a nation or a people is compounded of many per∣sons which haue their fantasies and counsels, their woorkes and deedes not only diuerse, but also very often contrary, and that the one tende vnto one ende, and the other to the contrary, so that the one conspire to vndoe and destroy that which the others doe, and builde, yet for al this are but one body: therefore when there is such diuersitie, yea rather contrarietie, the people must needes goe vnto destruction and bee scattered. Euery kingdome diuided a∣gainst it selfe shalbee brought to nought, and euerie citie or house, Mat. 12. 25. deuided against it selfe, shal not stande. And therefore the Lorde which hath created the people and nations, and hath placed them on the earth, as he hath seene good, making a great similitude to dwel togither, not willing to haue his woorke broken and hindred, but desiring the increase & conseruation thereof, hath constituted and appointed heads and superiours, for to guide and gouerne many vnder one lawe and ordinances, and to cause al the people by thē to
tende al to one ende, though it haue many and sundrie members, and that their states and vocations are diuers. But such a gouerne∣ment is not of smal weight, neither the charge of easie execution, so that it is not in the power of euery one to occupie if hee will such administration and office. Al braines are not settled nor wel aduised: but for the greatest parte are wandring and amased, and fewe there bee which knowe howe to gouerne themselues, much lesse howe to gouerne others. If euery man therefore shoulde meddle in gouernement, there should bee greate disorder & con∣fusion and al shoulde fal into decaye. Wherefore, it is needful that none shoulde take in hande this administration, except hee were called of GOD, and that by his grace hee be endewed with wise∣dome, for to knowe wel to mainteine peace and vnitie amongest them which seeke no warre nor dissention, and destroy them which are at debate and discorde together, and make them yeeld to peace and quietnesse which desire nothing but tumultes and seditions: o∣therwise al things goe to destruction. Solomon doeth signifie the same, when hee saieth, Where no counsell is, the people fal. The counsel which heere hee meaneth is that which chiefly is requyred in Kings and Princes, that they may rule woorthily, whereof hath beene spoken heere aboue in the 8. chapter, 14. 15. and 16. verses. I haue saide chiefly: for to them is this woorde directed. Bee wise Psal. 2. 10. & 82. 6. nowe therefore, O yee Kings: bee learned yee that are iudges of the earth. It is they to whome GOD doeth this honour to cal them Gods. They are they that exercise the iudgementes of God. And also when Kings and Magistrates are destitute of godly counsel, the 2. Chro. 19. 6 people whose eyes are set vpon them, and doeth folowe them, doe runne into destruction. The children of Israel haue truely prooued it, when they wanted good iudges and good kings: and also for to foretel them their destruction, the Lord doeth threaten to depriue them of good and wise gouernours, and counsellers, saying, I wil appoint children to be their Princes, and babes shal rule ouer them. Esay. 3. 4. But what counsel soeuer the superious giue, except the people doe attend to folowe them, they shal fal. Noe gaue good counsel, wher∣by hee laboured to reduce the worlde, and to teache it the way of righteousnes: but the worlde ceased therfore neuerthelesse to fal. Moyses was a wise counseller, and executed his office faithfully, but
yet the people of Israel did often fal vnder his gouernement. The people of Israel had many good iudges and kings replenished with diuine counsel, vnder whose gouernement they fell. The same people also had many good Prophetes: but because they hardened their heartes, and woulde not receiue their doctrine, but con∣temned their exhortations, warnings, reprehensions and threate∣nings, and persecuted them, they fel: And yet to this day remaine so decayed, because they refused our Lorde Iesus Christ and his A∣postles. &c. We ought to feare least we happen into lyke fal, not on∣ly corporal, but also spiritual and eternal, if hauing good Princes & faythful Pastours which doe truely teache vs, wee refuse and dis∣daine their counsel: but if wee wil auoide falling, we must bee dili∣gent folowers of counsel, I say the good and holy counsels of such as haue the charge to guide and gouerne vs, that wee become subiect and obedient vnto our Lordes and superiours in that which is not against God, and that in feare and reuerence wee receiue the wholesome doctrine of our Pastors and Ministers, and that wee bee not so lightly and easily caried away to folowe the foolish and false opinions of some troublesome person. Thus doing we shal remaine stedfast and stable, and shal neuer perish. Solomon doeth signifie the same saying, But where many counsellers are, there is health. Whereupon let vs first of al note that except wee folowe both the spiritual and temporal gouernement of such as are appointed and ordeined of God, for to counsel and leade vs, wee haue no stedfast∣nesse nor sure abyding, but shal fal. For it is asmuch as if wee were destitute of wise and good counsellers. Secondly forasmuch as wee haue no manner of saluation, but from the grace and goodnes of GOD, it foloweth right that it is he which prouideth men of counsellers that can giue good counsel: as also wee may see by the the confession of Ioseph. Likewise in Exodus, where Moyses con∣fesseth that hee is sent of God. The Prophetes also doe shewe it, Gene. 41. 16. Esa. 1. 25. 26 when they speake nothing but the woorde of God, and pronounce that hee hath sent them. God doeth teache vs it, saying, Then wil I turne myne hande vppon thee, and burne out thy drosse, til it bee pure, and take away al thy tinne. And I wil restore thy iudges as at the first, and thy counsellers as at the beginning. &c. Thirdly, seing
that among a number of men of counsel there is health, one man alone ought not to presume that by his wisedome hee is sufficient to leade and gouerne a nation: but if hee be called vnto such an of∣fice and administration, he ought to looke and prouide, for honest and faithful men to bee his helpers, for to ease him and to order the people with him, by folowing the counsel that Iethro gaue vnto Exo. 18. 18. Moyses. 15 He shalbe sore vexed that is suretie for a stranger: and he that hateth suretieship, is sure. Albeit that Solomon doeth thus speake, yet it is not to say, that hee alloweth a man shoulde doe according as he saith heere. For as touching the first parte, hee shoulde allowe the carefulnesse of the flesh, and worldly sorowe, the distrust and extreeme feare of po∣uertie, the which hee signifieth by shalbe sore vexed: as wee may vnderstande, when against to bee sore vexed, hee setteth, to be sure. Such affliction ought to be farre from the mindes and hartes of the faithful, which are the children of God their father, who hath care ouer them: and ought to be assured of him without al doubte: as Christ and the Apostle S. Paule do giue warning, the which is meete Mat. 6. Heb. 13. 5. 6. for to comfort them that are bounde for other: for that which doth most of al vexe them, is that they feare to bee pressed and constrai∣ned to pay the debt of the stranger whom they haue pledged, with∣out recouering payement, and so they come to pouertie. Seeing then that GOD by his woorde doeth warne vs, not to afflict ourselues after this sort, nor to feare what hurt man can doe vnto vs: let vs know that Solomon doeth not allowe such afflictions: but doeth declare how for the most part they which become suretie for others, are affectioned and vexed, when afterwards they see they cā∣not obteine payement of him for whome they are become suretie: then they are troubled & greatly vexed in their mindes. Solomon doth wel expresse it, when he is not contented simply to say, hee is afflicted: but he is sore vexed or afflicted. And by this expression hee sheweth vs that it is not good, sodenly and easily to become suretie for such as wee knowe not. As touching the second parte, which is, Hee that hateth suretieshippe, is sure. If hee allowed that which hee pronounced, he should allowe twoo vices:
The first is, hatred, whereof the childrē of God ought to be so void. that they should hate no man for any hurt they shal doe to them: but should loue their enemies, and be ready to helpe them. Solomō then doth not allow that we should hate the notaries & scriueners which do bind vs & require vs to be bound for another, albeit that often by such obligations wee suffer much euil: but hee painteth vs out the affection of the greatest parte of them which binde them∣selues when they see themselues troubled, and are arested vpon the obligation, then they hate the notaries and scriueners, and do curse them, and cannot behold them with louing countenance: & if they could, they would prooue them false and counterfaite men: for of∣ten they spare not to say, they are such. The second vice that hee shoulde allow, were a vaine confidence & hope that they haue ne∣uer to want when they haue some riches, and haue not bene suretie for other. Albeit that in what estate soeuer we bee, howe miserable soeuer the same bee before our eyes and in the feeling of the flesh, we must neuer mistrust nor feare to want, but that we must be assu∣red of the prouidence, carefulnesse and goodnesse of our heauenly father, and say with Dauid, The Lorde is my sheephearde, I shal Psal. 23. 1. want nothing: (otherwise wee pray not in true fayth when wee pray, giue vs this day our dayly bread) notwithstanding what great worldly prosperitie soeuer wee haue, wee must not trust theretoo: for it is not in our power to mainteine ourselues therein, but the Lorde hath changed it, as hee doeth see good: for al thinges are in his hande, and hee doeth dispose as hee pleaseth, without that any man can reprooue him of vniustice, or crueltie, or of tyranny. Iob hath wel tryed the change, and hath confessed that it came of God. When the wicked doe feele it, they grinde their teeth, and murmur thereat, and doe despite GOD in blaspheming him. Let vs fol∣lowe righteous Iob, if wee haue any wealth, let vs not bee ne∣uerthe more assured, nor reioyce any whit the more in them, but in the onely goodnesse of the Lorde and in his knowledge. Let not the wise man glorie in his wisedome, nor the strong man Iere. 9. 23. glorie in his strength, neither the riche man glorie in his riches. And if wee loose let vs take patience, on what side soeuer the losse commeth, knowing that nothing hapneth vnto vs but by the pro∣uidence
of God. The Lorde killeth, and maketh aliue, bringeth downe to the graue, and raiseth vp. The Lord maketh poore. & ma∣keth 1. Sam. 2. 6. & 7. riche. Moreouer besides this, let vs note, that albeit that Solo∣mon doeth not allowe that any man shoulde be assured because hee is not bound, yet hee doeth somewhat teache vs that it is farre bet∣ter to enioy our goods freely & at libertie, then to bee bounde for other, and chiefly when hee is vnknowne, as also it hath bene han∣dled in the sixt chapter. Furthermore let vs note that Solomō doth teache vs, that if wee loue our neighbours as wee ought, that wee wil not require them to be suretie for vs, except it be necessarie, and also that we haue wherewith to answere them and to keepe them from sorowe, and to mainteine them that they may possesse their goods and safely enioy them. 16 A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the strong men attaine riches. Whiles wee liue in this life, and keepe a house, and walke with our neighbours and acquaintance, wee haue neede of reputation, not that wee shoulde seeke the glorie of the worlde, but that wee shoulde so liue, that they amongest whome wee dwel, may finde no faute in our kinde of liuing, but that it shoulde bee so quiet, honest, iust, and holy, that they may bee constrained to glorifie GOD, and to esteeme and iudge wel of vs, to praise and com∣mende vs. Solomon doeth shewe vs the way to come vnto such re∣putation, when hee saieth, a gracious woman attaineth honour. He teacheth vs to be gracious, if wee would attaine honour: albeeit that hee nameth but the woman, and doeth promise her honour, if she be gracious. Hee speaketh thus, because that man in the houshold is the head and superiour, and that the woman oweth him subiection and obedience. Man is not of the woman, but the woman is of the man. Wiues, submit yourselues vnto your hus∣bands, 1. Cor. 11. 8. Ephe. 5. 22. as vnto the Lord. Nowe for to be subiect and giue obedience as it behoueth, she must bee gracious, that is to say, that she shoulde gouerne the housholde after her husbands desire, without contra∣rying him in any wise: that shee doe nothing in the house with trouble and vprores, but that shee gouerne her housholde in al,
softnesse, humilitie, peace, and gentlenesse: and that without shee be not an offence vnto his neighbours, neither by word nor deede: but that she be sober, modest, humble, and gentle towardes al men, and chiefly towardes his neighbours, amongst whome she is most conuersant. This is the graciousnesse that Solomon requireth heere of the woman: and Saint Paule, I wil therefore that the yon∣ger 1. Tim. 5. 14. Titus. 2. 3. women marie, and beare children, and gouerne the house, and giue none occasion to the aduersarie to speake euil. The elder women likewise, that they bee such in behauiour as becommeth holinesse, not false accusers, not subiect too much wine, but tea∣chers of honest thinges. Likewise, let the wiues bee subiect to their husbandes, that euen they which obey not the woorde, may 1. Pet. 3. 1. without the woorde bee wonne by the conuersation of the wiues. The women which are thus gracious, shal attaine honour. First of al towardes their husbandes, except they bee out of their wits, furious and madde. Honest and good men hauing such wiues, wil make great account of them, and wil earnestlie loue them, and wil shewe al humanitie and gentlenes to them. Secondly, the hous∣holde, as the children and seruants, wil loue them, wil honour and reuerence them, wil obey them, and feare to offend them. Thirdly, their neighbours wil esteeme wel of them, they wil speake wel of them, and wil beholde them with great admiration, and wil bee at their commandement in al honestie. And seeing that Solomon pro∣miseth vnto gracious women, honour: when women see thēselues disdained, let them confesse that they are not so gracious as they ought to bee, or that for their sinnes God doeth humble and make them contemptible, or else that they haue to doe with vncourteous and churlish men, whereby God wil prooue their patience. For also this is the manner of the worldlings, to contemne and perse∣cute the true seruants of God. Notwithstanding God ceaseth not therefore to performe his promise towardes women, so farre as is expediēt for their spiritual health. What contempt then soeuer they be in, yet let them not cease to shew themselues gracious. And if wo∣men which are the weakest vessels, ought to striue to shewe them∣selues gentle for to attaine honor: by a more stronger reason ought men (which are the heads and ought to be more stronge, & shewe by their example the way to the women) to be gentle for to obtain
honour, otherwise they are wel worthy to be despised. But although the churlish, whether they be men or women, deserue wel to be de∣spised and depriued of al honour, the which Solomon doeth attri∣bute but vnto the gracious women, yet because God hath cōman∣ded children to honour their fathers and their mothers, they must honour their parents, of what manners soeuer they be, when obey∣ing and being at their commandement, they breake not the lawe of the Lorde. Children obey your parents in al things: for that is well pleasing vnto the Lorde. The men and maide seruantes for to doe their duetie wel, shoulde not take heede vnto the manners of their Collo. 3. 2. & 22. maisters and dames, but they shoulde looke to be subiect and giue obediēce in al things, not only to the good, but also vnto the sharpe and rigorous. By a more strong reason then must wee obey thē that Ephe. 6. 1. 5. & 2. 9. 1. Pet. 2. 18. 1. Tim. 6. 2. are good and gracious, otherwise, so much as in them lyeth, they a∣bolish the promise. And the strong men attaine riches. With esti∣mation wee haue need of riches for to sustaine this corporal body during this lyfe. And therefore, after that Solomon hath shewed vs how we shal attaine honor, he teacheth vs how we shal get riches. Wherein wee see it is necessarie that a father of houshold should be strong, and that there with hee shoulde exercise himselfe to labour and to put foorth his strength for if hee bee ydle, slacke and slouth∣ful, and doeth not bestowe the tyme about good woorkes, after his estate whereto hee is called, it is asmuch as if hee were feeble and weake, and were destitute of strength and might, yea and much worse. For the man which cannot labour, ought not only to bee ex∣cused from labour, but also vpholden, and the strong ought for to assist him, and to distribute vnto him his dayly bread, according as his necessitie requireth. But forasmuch as God hath ordeined from the creation of the worlde that man should labour: for the Lorde God tooke man and placed him in the garden of Eden, for to dresse Gen. 2. 15. & 3. 17. Ephe. 4. 28. 2. Thes. 3. 10. and keepe the garden, and that since the fal of Adam, necessitie hath bin laid vpon him to worke, and that S. Paule agreeing to this scrip∣ture, doeth admonish vs, let him that stoale, steale no more but let him rather labour, & work with his hands the thing which is good, that he may haue to giue vnto him that needeth. This wee warned you of, that if there were any, which would not woorke, that hee should not eate.
Wee doe not vnderstande thereby that it is necessarie that euery one shoulde imploye himselfe to the labour of the bodily handes in the earth, or any other handie woorke. For as the powers are diuers, so are the states and vocations, and so also are the la∣bours diuers. And the mightie which imploy their might to la∣bour either with body or with minde, or with preaching, accor∣ding as they are called, doe gather riches. They get ynough, for to mainteine them in this present life, and are contented with that which it pleaseth GOD to sende them, and thus they are riche: for as it is commonly saide, a contented minde is greate riches, and there is no greater riches nor more commodious then is contentation. But meeke men shal possesse the earth, Psalm. 37. 11 & 16. &c. Againe, a smal thing vnto the iust man is better, then greate riches to the wicked and mightie. If then wee wil get riches, let vs studie for righteousnesse, and thereby let vs imploy the strength that GOD hath giuen vs either corporal or spiritual vn∣to goodnesse, euery man according to his vocation. For it is not necessarie that all men occupie themselues in bodily labour. For as our Lorde saieth of the ministers of his woorde, The labourer is woorthy of his hyre. The Lorde also hath ordeyned, Mat. 10. 10. 1. Cor. 9. 14. 1. Tim. 5. 17. Act. 18. 3. & 20. 33. & 34. that they which preach the Gospel shoulde liue of the Gospel. The elders that rule wel, are woorthy of double honour, specially they which labour in the worde and doctrine. But some wil say that S. Paule was an Euangelist, and yet hee ate his bread with the labour of his hands. Againe, hee saith, I haue coueted no mans siluer, nor golde, nor apparel. Yea, ye knowe that these handes haue ministred vnto my necessities, and to them that were with me. I answere, that it is lawful for them which also are aswel able as S. Paule to doe as 1. Cor. 9. 12. & 2. 11. he did. If others with you be partakers of this power, are not we ra∣ther? neuerthelesse, wee haue not vsed this power. Likewise it is lawful for them to liue of their calling and ministery, as it appea∣reth by the places alledged before. But when the riches are attribu∣ted vnto the mightie, let vs first of al note that it is not to say that our power deserueth riches, otherwise we should not neede to aske our dayly bread: but let vs know that the Lord doth giue vs power, and the vse thereof, as by an instrument to helpe our necessitie. And God is able to make al grace to abound toward you, that ye alwaies 2. Cor. 9. 8.
hauing al sufficiencie in al things, may abounde in euery good work. Secondly that in liuing ydlely, we shoulde not desire to liue at the Psal. 128. & 62. 11. cost of other, but folowing the commandement of God, we should eate of our owne labour, and we shalbe blessed. Thirdly, that it is lawful for vs to possesse riches, so that wee come not to them by vnlawful meanes, and that wee doe not set our hartes vpon them. Saint Paule also doeth not commande vs to cast away riches, but that wee shoulde not waxe proude of them. Charge them that are riche in this worlde, that they bee not highminded, and that they 1. Tim. 6. 17. trust not in vncertaine riches, but in the liuing God, which giueth vs abundantly al things to enioy. And albeeit that our Lorde doeth say vnto his disciples, Verily I say vnto you, that a riche man shal Mat. 19. 23. hardly enter into the kingdome of heauen: yet doeth hee not con∣demne riches, but them that put their trust in them. Children, howe Mark. 10. 24. harde is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdome of God. Fourthly when wee imploye our strength to labour ac∣cording to our vocation, though we do not heape together aboun∣dance of goods, and that wee doe not greatly gaine in outwarde sight: yet if wee bee contented with that which it pleaseth God to sende vs, wee enioy riches and obtaine greate gaine. Fiftly, if wee 1. Tim. 6. 6. bee poore and miserable, let vs acknowledge that wee doe not be∣stowe our labour, after the strength that God hath giuen vs, but do hyde and burie the talent of the Lorde in the earth, by liuing in slouthfulnesse and carelesnesse: or that wee doe not faythfully, and truly our woorke: or that we labour excessiuely and too earnestly to gather riches together. Or else let vs learne that the Lorde know∣eth it is more expedient for vs to bee poore then to be riche. Sixt∣ly, let vs confesse the goodnesse of GOD, which is not conten∣ted to giue vs strength, but woulde that the same shoulde profite vs, and that it shoulde get and obteine for vs riches to keepe vs. In the seuenth place, although it seeme like that the worldlinges are riche, and that the faythful are tempted with their prosperitie, Psal. 73. 12. and to say, Loe, these are the wicked, yet prosper they alway and increase in riches: yet doe they not properly attaine to riches, for they are sooner depriued of them then they woulde, neither are Luke. 12. 16. Psa. 73. 18. they partakers of the heauenly. Surely thou hast set them in slip∣perie
places, and castest them downe into desolation. But the faith∣ful doe truely attaine riches, for they are alwaies readie to forsake them for to winne the true and heauenly. 17 He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne soule: but hee that troubleth his owne flesh, is cruel. Though a man doeth giue but a litle, if the same bee according to his abilitie, yet doeth hee truly helpe the necessitie of his neigh∣bour (as saith S. Iames, If a brother or a sister be naked and destitute Iam. 2. 15. of dayly foode, and one of you say vnto them, departe in peace, warme yourselues, and fil your bellies, notwithstanding yee giue them not those things which are needful to the body, what helpeth it? And whosoeuer hath this worldes good, and seeth his bro∣ther haue neede, and shutteth vp his compassion from him, howe dwelleth the loue of God in him?) It foloweth seeing that Solo∣mon calleth him merciful, that rewardeth his owne soule, that in 1. Iohn. 3. 17. this place, the soule is taken for the neighbour, whome although that God hath commanded vs to loue as ourselues, wee shoulde esteeme as our owne soule: seeing also that we are members one of Rom. 12. 5. another and one selfe body, wee ought to esteeme the soules of our neighbours, as our owne, and to folowe that which is saide, for by one spirit are we al baptized into one body. And al that beleeued, 1. Cor. 12. 13. Ephe. 4. 4. Acts. 2. 44. & 4. 32. were in one place, and had al things common. And the multi∣tude of them that beleeued, were of one hart, and of one soule. Thus doing, wee shalbe merciful to our soules, for wee shal succour the necessitie of our needie members and in the ende wee shal ob∣teine rewarde. Blessed are the merciful, for they shal obteine mercie. Make your friendes with the riches of iniquitie &c. Hee Mat. 5. 7. & 25. 34. Luke. 16. 9. Psa. 112. 9. hath distributed and giuen to the poore: his righteousnesse remay∣neth for euer: his horne shalbe exhalted with glorie. Contrarily, he that taketh care but of himselfe, is not merciful vnto his neighbor, nor to his owne body, though he haue great aboundance of riches, and is mery and doeth make good cheere. Wo be to you that are Luk. 6. 24. & 12. 20. & 16. 19. rich: for ye haue receiued your consolation. O foole, this night wil they fetch away thy soule from thee: then whose things shal those bee which thou hast prouided? We see therfore that the world iud∣geth
amisse, when it iudgeth that men are merciful vnto themselues when they make great cheere. Seeing then that the scripture doeth not cal him merciful that is good to himself, it is necessarie that the soule must heere signifie our neighbour: but chiefly them of hous∣holde, as the wife, the children, the men and mayde seruantes. These 1. Tim. 5. 8. are they to whome wee must first of al shewe mercy. If there bee any man that prouideth not for his owne, and namely for them of his housholde, hee denyeth fayth, and is woorse then an infidel. And also the scripture calleth them soules. Then Gen. 12. 5. Abraham tooke Sarah his wife, and Lot his brothers sonne, and al their substance that they possessed, and the soules that they had gotten in Harran. Then the king of Sodom saide to Abra∣ham, Giue mee the persons or soules, and take the goods to thy & 14. 21. selfe. Notwithstanding, if wee wil take soule, for the person of the merciful, there shalbe none inconuenience, except in place of say∣ing, Hee that is mercifull, rewardeth his owne soule, we must say, The merciful man assureth or pleaseth his soule: that is to say, that he is so wel affectioned towards his neighbours, that hee forgetteth himselfe, and wil not take his delightes, but suffereth rather then he wil forsake his neighbours in their necessitie, so that if hee hath sworne though it were to his owne hinderance, hee wil not breake his othe. It is easie for a man to occupie himself to doe his neigh∣bours Psa. 15. 4. pleasure and seruice, when he may conueniently do it with∣out hinderance. But true charitie, which is heere briefly described vnto vs, according to this sense, is stirred vp with the feeling of ano∣thers misery, and with the euil that another suffreth, as with his owne aduersities. Loue suffereth long: it is bountiful: loue en∣uieth 1. Cor 13. 5. not: loue doeth not boast it selfe: it is not puffed vp. It is the same wherevnto the Apostle exhorteth vs, Let loue bee without dissimulation. Nowe therefore as the elect of God, ho∣ly Rom. 12. 9. Col. 3. 12. and beloued, put on tender mercie, kindnesse, humblenesse of minde, meekenesse, long suffering, &c. The loue which he requi∣reth, is not a colde thing: but they are true affections such as the fathers and mothers beare towardes their Children. Our Lorde Iesus Christe hath exercised this charitie more then all Iohn. 15. 13.
other, when he hath suffred so much for our sinnes. Greater loue then this hath no man, when any man bestoweth his life for his 1. Iohn. 3. 16. friendes. Heereby haue wee perceiued loue, that he laide downe his life for vs. Beholde these are twoo expositions vpon the first part of this sentence, which are diuers and not contrary. They agree with the comparison that Solomon maketh of the merciful and the cruel, when hee saieth, But hee that troubleth his owne flesh, is cruel. Heere hee signifieth vnto vs that the wicked, rather then hee wil bee put by of his desires, and hindred of his purpose, wil not abstaine to inuent against his parentes and kinsfolke, and to hurt them, euen to put them to cruel death if it bee possible. Here∣of might be brought many examples. 18 The wicked woorketh a disceitful woorke: but hee that soweth righteousnesse, shall receyue a sure re∣warde. If we would not lose our labour, but haue our work to profit as it is the desire of those that labour, and apply themselues to some woorke, let vs take heede from folowing the wicked, to doe as they doe: They make greate shewes of their dooings, but the issue and the ende, is not according theretoo. Some of them haue great ap∣parance of continual prosperitie, and seemeth vnpossible that they should come vnto pouertie and beggerie: other some seeme to bee of such power and authoritie, that it is vnpossible they shoulde bee humbled: and other some againe, haue so faire a shewe of religion and holinesse that it seemeth right that GOD is straightly bounde vnto them, and that they deserue the same, that it is not possible for them to be damned. But as it is saide, al is not golde that glistereth, euen so the goodly shewes of the wicked are vaine and false. Solo∣mon doeth signifie it, when hee saieth. The wicked woorketh a disceitful woorke. By the which woordes wee must vnderstande that not onely they deceiue others, but also thēselues, they perswade themselues they cannot fal from their degree and state, and that al must happen as they woulde haue it, but whatsoeuer they take in hande and doe, commeth to nought against their expectation.
The woorde of disceite doeth shewe it vs very wel: so doeth the seconde part of the Antithesis or cōparison also, when immediatly Psal. 5. 12. hee saieth, But hee that soweth righteousnesse, &c. Hee setteth the seed of righteousnesse against the woorke of the wicked: and the sure rewarde against lying or disceitfulnesse. Wherein wee may vnderstande that the sowing of righteousnesse is by assurance wee haue in the goodnesse of GOD, and by the feare and reue∣rence that wee haue of his woorde, and the greate desire wee haue for to obey him, and giue ourselues to liue according to his commandementes: whereby hee woulde that wee shoulde liberally and with a good wil helpe the necessitie of our neighbours. The scripture exhorteth vs thus to sowe, Breake vp your fallowe Iere. 4. 4. grounde and sowe not among the thornes: bee circumcised to the Lorde, and take away the foreskinnes of your heartes, &c. Sowe Oseas. 10. 12 to yourselues in righteousnesse: reape after the measure of mercie: breake vp your fallowe grounde: for it is time to seeke the Lorde, til hee come and raine righteousnesse vpon you. Hee which soweth 2. Cor. 9. 6. sparingly, shal reape also sparingly, and hee that soweth liberal∣ly, shal reape also liberally. Bee not deceiued: GOD is Gal. 6. 7. 8. not mocked: for whatsoeuer a man soweth, that shal he also reape. For hee that soweth to his fleshe, shal of the fleshe reape cor∣ruption: but hee that soweth to the spirit, shal of the Spirit reape life euerlasting. Thus by these scriptures wee see what it is to sowe, and that the rewarde is not disceitful, but true. For they which sowe doe not loose their paines, they receiue the fruite which is sayde, a sure rewarde, because it doeth not faile nor neuer shal, but the righteous shal possesse it for euer. It is the trueth that Solomon setteth against disceite: but although that the wicked which doe abuse and deceiue others, are wel woorthy to be againe deceiued, and not to enioy that which they thinke and looke for, & that they deserue to be destroyed: yet notwithstanding if contrary to them, wee giue ourselues to sowe righteousnesse, let vs not therefore challenge any merite: but let vs altogither waite vpon the grace and mercie of GOD, not deceiuing ourselues by and about his woorde, rewarde, and wages, as if God were bounde vnto vs for
to recōpēce vs for our seed of righteousnes. For albeit there is a co∣uenant & bande betwene man and man, to giue reward vnto them Leui. 19. 13. Deu. 24. 14. Col. 4, 1. Iam. 5. 4. which labour for vs: (The workmans hire shal not abyde with thee vntil the morning. Yee maisters, doe vnto your seruants, that which is iust, and equal, knowing that ye also haue a maister in heauen. Be∣holde the hyre of the labourers, which haue reaped your fields (which is of you kept backe by fraude) crieth, and the cryes of them which haue reaped, are entred into the eares of the Lord of hostes) yet what righteousnesse soeuer we sowe, we cannot make GOD bounde to giue vs any rewarde, no more then the toole or instru∣ment can for the goodnesse and finenesse of metal, make the worke∣man bounde to it. If we do any good woorke, it commeth of the grace of God which guideth vs, and stirreth vs vp: wee are no more but his instruments. Not that we are able of ourselues, to thinke any thing, as of ourselues: but our sufficiencie is of God. For it is 2. Cor. 3. 5. Phi. 2. 13. God that woorketh in you, both the wil and the deed, euen of his good pleasure. Moreouer we are slaues and bonde men: therefore our God who hath redeemed vs with the precious blood of his Sonne, cannot stand bounde to vs: what righteousnes soeuer wee worke, we are vnprofitable seruants: we haue done that which was Luke. 17. 10 our duetie to doe. Therfore when the scripture doeth offer and set before vs a rewarde or hyre, let vs make no account of merite, but let vs magnifie the grace and bountifulnesse of God, whereby wee obteine eternal life, the which is called a rewarde, not because wee winne the same, but for that that Iesus Christ hath gotten it for vs, & that after al our laboures the same is giuen vnto vs. It is the gift of GOD, and not of woorkes, lest any man should boast himselfe. Ephe. 2. 8. 9. 19 As righteousnesse leadeth to life so hee that foloweth e∣uil, seeketh his owne death. What worke soeuer we take in hande in this world, our intent & desire is to profite thereby, and by the meanes wherof we may liue and bee at our ease: and thus we labour to obteine a good re∣warde of our worke, which we would not misse and loose. And the which for to attaine, Solomon hath shewed vs howe wee must
forsake the worke of the wicked, and folow righteousnes by doing good vnto our neighbours. Nowe when he saieth, As righteous∣nes leadeth to life, &c. he sheweth what this sure reward is, that is to say, life. And forasmuch as the wicked do liue in this world, euen with greater carnal ioy, then the righteous, the which doe seeme of∣ten in the sight of the eyes, to be rather dead then liuing, for the troubles and pouerties, miseries, and persecutions that they suffer: (whereupon also through the weakenesse of their fleshe they doe complaine and say, Haue mercie vppon mee, O Lorde: for I am in Psa. 31. 9. 10 Psal. 88. 1. 2. 3. trouble: mine eye, my soule, and my bellie are consumed with griefe. For my life is wasted with heauinesse, and my yeeres with mourning. O Lorde God of my saluation, I crye day and night be∣fore thee. Let my prayer enter into thy presence: encline thine eare vnto my crye. For my soule is filled with euils, and my life draweth neere vnto the graue) it foloweth that the life which is here spoken of, is not the temporal life (although it commeth of the gifte and grace of God, howe miserable soeuer it bee, as the faithful doe vn∣derstande: . 22 for they confesse God to be their Creator) but it is the euerlasting life whereof the wicked are depriued for euer, as Solo∣mon doeth affirm saying, So he that foloweth euil, seeketh his own death. Forasmuche as the temporal death is common to al men: Eccle. 9. 2. and al thinges happen alike to al men: and also that temporal death is an entrance vnto life: it foloweth wel, that the death which they seeke which folow euil, is not the temporal death, though it be vn∣to the wicked a part of their euil, as an entrance vnto eternal death, whereof here is mention. Wherein Solomon wel sheweth, that there is deceit in the worke of the wicked: For though Solomon Psal. 10. 6. did not here speake but of temporal death, yet were it an argument stronge enough for to shewe that the wicked worketh a deceitfull work. For albeit the wicked, according as he seeth happen to others, knoweth he shal die, yet he laboureth to make himself beleeue that he shal neuer die. He saith in his heart, I shal neuer be mooued, nor be in danger. And in whatsoeuer he doeth, hee laboureth to liue al∣wayes, if he could: and when his works do not proceed to his pur∣pose, it foloweth wel, therin is deceit, & that he laboureth in vaine. His intent is, to doe his workes for to liue, and he by them runneth vnto death, & seeketh for that which he would not gladly finde.
20 They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vn∣to the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight. Solomon here giueth a reason of the former sentence, shewing wherfore they which folow euil, doe seeke death, and the righte∣ous life. They which folow euil, are ledde with the frowardnesse of their heartes, the which delight in no goodnes, but inuent all euil, though none occasion be giuen them. Now forasmuch as in God li∣eth al goodnes, from whence life commeth to vs: and hee is not a Psal. 5. 4. God which loueth wickednes: it foloweth wel, seeing that the wic∣ked are in abhomination to the Lorde, who is the authour of lyfe, that they must needes goe to death: sith they are separated from life, they must needs remaine in death: the which they doe wel deserue: for it cōmeth of their corruptiō & purposedmalice, that peruerttheir hearts. Their feete runne to euil, & they make hast to shed innocent 2. Cor Phi. 2. 7. blood: their thoughts are wicked thoughts: desolation and destruc∣tion is in their pathes. And herewith also it is of maliciousnes, & so much as lieth in them, they spoile al: wherupon they wel deserue to finde nothing wherin they may haue succour, & so must needes pe∣rishe. As touching the righteous, seeing that of themselues they are no better then the most wicked, so farre is it of, that wee may finde any cause in them for the which they shoulde bee worthie of life, that they deserue death aswel as the other: yet doe they liue, & it is not without reason: The reasō is not found in them, nor in any other creature, but in God onely, & in his grace & fauour, because it pleaseth him to accept them, and delight in them. Solomon doeth shewe it verie plainly, when he alledgeth nothing for their excellen∣cie and dignitie, that they attain life: But they that are vpright in their way, are his delight. Whereto Saint Paule agreeth, alledging howe God saith to Moses, I wil haue mercie on him, to whome Rom. 9. 15 Ephe. 1. 5. Tit. 3. 4. 5. I wil shew mercie. And in an other place alledging, Who hath pre∣destinate vs, to be adopted through Iesus Christe vnto himselfe, ac∣cording to the good pleasure of his wil. But when the bountifulnes and loue of God our Sauiour towarde men appeared, not by the works of righteousnes which he had don, but according to his mer∣cy, he saued vs, &c. The faithful ought to haue their ioye set in
this good wil and pleasure which is so healthful. For thou Lorde wilt blesse the righteous, and with fauour wilt compasse him, as Psal. 5. 12. with a shielde. But let vs note, that it is not without cause that wee haue saide, that the reason for the which the righteous doe goe into life, is not in them, as hath bene alreadie touched, concerning the malice of their nature, which they haue common with the wicked. And herewith, albeit that the Scripture giueth them this honour to cal them perfect or vpright in their way, as indeede they are, seeing that God accepteth them suche, because that in their affaires, they proceede vprightly in simplicitie and innocencie, without dissimu∣lation and hypocrisie, without enuie and set malice, and without deceit and craft: yet are they not so perfect in their manners and kinde of doings, but that they feele many imperfections, and much to be amended in them, if God woulde straightly examine them. Surely, there is no man iust in the earth, that doeth good and sin∣neth not. Therefore what vprightnes soeuer is in vs, let vs pray, Eccle. 7. 22 Psal. 143. 2 Enter not into iudgement with thy seruant: for in thy sight shall none that liueth be iustified. 21 Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked shal not goe vn∣punished: but the seede of the righteous shal escape. Because that Solomon hath threatened the wicked which seeke nothing but to doe euil, with death: and it seemeth well vnto the worldly, that if they be accompanied and ioyned with a great multi∣tude of people which haue power & authoritie, that no hurt can happen vnto them: for this cause, for to keepe vs from such vaine & deceitful confidence, Solomon doth shew vs, that what bandes and couenants soeuer there are betwene the wicked, yet shal they not be safe enough, nor mightie, for to exempt themselues from death, whē he saieth, Though hand ioyne in hand, &c. Albeit that the wicked doe giue their handes one to an other, and do conspire together, yet can they neuer so wel, nor strongly arme and fortifie themselues, that they can exempt themselues from hurt, and to woorke that they shoulde not goe vnto destruction, out of the which they shall neuer arise. Before the vniuersal flood, the worlde and mul∣titude of the wicked was surely ioyned, and except the house and
familie of Noe, they al agreed together to worke wickednes, with∣out remorse of conscience, euen with an vnbrideled lust: but their agreement saued them not from perishing by the flood of waters: Wee alledge Sodome and Gomorrhe, with the Cities adioyning: The conspiracie of Corath, Dathan, and Abyram: The destructi∣on Gen. 19. Num. 16. 31. Iosu. 10. Psal. 2. &. 3. & 33. Esai. 30 & 31. of Median, The fiue Kinges, Iosua the tenth chap: & likewise di∣uers others. We haue also witnesses that suche bandes & leagues are vaine and vnprofitable. Woe to the rebellious children saieth the Lorde, that take counsel, but not at mee, and couer with a co∣uering, but not by my Spirite, that they may laye sinne vpon sinne. Againe, Woe vnto them that goe downe into Egypt for helpe, and staye vppon Horses, and trust in Horses, and trust in Charets, be∣cause they are many, and in Horsemen, because they are verie strong. Contrarily, though the righteous bee but smal in number, and that the worlde doeth not desire their agreement, but doe scorne the same, reiect and persecute them, and that they are esteemed as the dunge and filthinesse of the earth, and also that it seemeth they can not escape, but must needes goe to destruction, yet are they so wel saued and defended, so wel holpen and succoured, that how violent assaultes soeuer they haue, yet can they not bee bea∣ten downe and ouercome. For the Lorde wil preserue both them and their posteritie after them. Solomon doeth so promise it, when hee sayeth, But the seede of the righteous shal escape. Hee speaketh thus first, by folowing the promise made to Abraham: Secondly, vppon experience which is shewed to Noe, Abraham, Lot, Iacob Ioseph, Moyses, Dauid, and others. But at the Gen. 12. & 17. Gen. 22. Deut. 28. Ps. 33. & 34. Gen. 6. 9. Gen. 9. 25 Eze. 18. 10 Esai. 1. 4. Mat. 12. 39. first sight it might appeare, that this promise shoulde not bee sted∣fast. For Noe was righteous, and yet his seede was not preser∣ued from the curse. Cursed be Canaan, a seruant of seruants shall he be vnto his brethren. If wee shoulde make a discourse through al the holie Fathers, wee shal finde in their seede many wicked ones, &c. Againe, Ezechiel saieth, If the righteous beget a sonne, that is a thiefe, or a shedder of blood, &c. Againe, the Prophet Esay saieth, Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquitie: a seede of the wicked, corrupt children, &c. And our Lorde calleth them,
an euil and adulterous generation, &c. To the former obiection I answere, As the righteous, insomuche as they are the children Ioh. 3. 5. Ephe. 2. Ioh. 1. 12. of Adam, they are the children of wrathe, and haue no entraunce into the kingdome of God: but truely and indeede to be the chil∣dren of God, they must bee regenerated, but so many as receiued him, to them he gaue prerogatiue to be the sonnes of God, euen to them which beleeue in his name. Moreouer, so far as the righteous are flesh, and born of fleshe, & haue great posteritie, yea a great posteritie of carnal children, yet are they not al the seede of the righteous, but of men truely. The holie Scripture calleth none of the seede of the righteous, by the name of the children of God, but suche as are regenerate and re∣newed Rom. 8. 15. by the holie Ghost, who maketh them to crye, Abba, Fa∣ther. Saint Iohn Baptist doeth somewhat shewe it vs, when hee Mat. 3. 7. saieth, O generation of Vipers, who hath taught you to flye from the vengeance to come? And our Lorde sayeth, I knowe that ye Ioh. 8. 37. are Abrahams seede, but yee seeke to kil mee, &c. And Saint Paul doeth plainly say it, For al they are not Israel, which are of Israel: Rom. 9. 6. 7. neither are they al children, because they are the seed of Abraham. Albeit then that the Iewes which slew Iesus Christ, and persecuted his Apostles, and remained harde harted, did come of the holy Fa∣thers, yet are they not the seede of the righteous: but bastard chil∣dren, a cursed seede, and children of the Deuil. Likewise they which Mahomet and the Pope haue corrupted, which are descended of them that receiued the Gospel by the ministerie of the Apostles, Disciples, and true Euangelists. Contrarily, they that are come after the fleshe from the hea∣then Idolaters and wicked, the which they haue not folowed, but beeing conuerted from their iniquities and filthinesse, haue receiued the Worde, and thereby were regenerated, so that beeing assured of the good pleasure of God towardes them, a∣greed not, nor framed themselues to the wicked worlde, but haue fashioned theyr mindes anewe, are not the seede of the wicked, but of the righteous. They are truely and indeede the children of Abraham. Saint Paule doeth well shewe it, when hee sayeth, But to him that worketh not, but beleeueth in him Rom. 4. 5. that iustifieth the vngodly, his Faith is counted for righteousnes:
and a litle after he saieth, After he receiued the signe of circumcisi∣on, & 11. as the seale of the righteousnes of Faith, which hee had, when hee was vncircumcised, that hee shoulde bee the Father of al them that beleeue, &c: Therefore it is by Faith. Suche seede shalbee & 16. Eze. 18. 14 deliuered from death and destruction. But if hee beget a sonne, that seeth al his fathers sinnes, which he hath done, and feareth, neither doeth the like, &c. Hee shall not dye in the iniquitie of his father, but hee shal surely liue, &c. Therefore wee must feare the Lorde & 17. and keepe his commandements, and from what stocke or roote so∣euer we come, we shalbe the seed of the righteous, and shal obtaine according to this promise of Solomon, the which is more largely declared, by Dauid, in his 112. Psalme. 22 As a iewel of golde in a Swines snout: so is a faire wo∣man which lacketh discretion. When Saint Paule saith, That God hath placed euerie of the members in the bodie, as it hath pleased him: albeit, that by these wordes hee woulde shewe the vnitie of the bodie, and the con∣iunction of the members together which are diuers, yet the same hindereth not, but that by these verie wordes wee may learne that our bodies haue neither forme nor beautie, except God hath giuen it, and that God is the authour of the beautie as wel of men as of women: for also there is none but he, that doeth make and fashi∣on them. Our mother Eue doth wel confesse the same, saying, God hath appointed me an other seede for Abel, because Caine slewe him. Iacob also did confesse it, saying, Am I in Gods stead, which Gen. 1. & 2 & 4. 25. & 30. 2. Iob. 10. 8. hath withholden from thee the fruite of the wombe? Forasmuch then as beautie is the gifte of GOD, wee must take heede to vse it well, lest it happen, that through insolencie and dissolute∣nesse, wee profane this beautie, and that by the euil gouernment of it, wee doe not drawe our neighbours to commit vnclean∣nesse and dishonestie with vs, whereof proceedeth great punish∣ment, and horrible vengeance of God. If then God hath giuen vs Gen. 6. & 34. 2. beautie, let vs take heede to maintaine ourselues honestly, and desire not to bee seene; but in all modestie and sobernesse: and
and let vs looke wel to ourselues: for albeit we holde an holy coun∣tenance, and as becommeth them, euen such as S. Paule demandeth of women, that they may instruct the yonger women: and they Tit. 2. 3. 1. Tim. 5. 13. should not be like vnto yong womē, which being ydle learne to go about from house to house, &c: yet shal it bee very harde but the carnal wil labor to abuse the beautie that God hath giuen vs. We may see the same in Sara: againe also in Thamar the sister of Absa∣lon. Gene. 12. 4. &. 20. 2. 2. Sam. 13. 1. But forasmuch as both men and women ought to be careful to walke soberly and modestly, and not not to be desirous to set forth their beautie to be seene and regarded, yet because women are the weaker vessells, and because also that they desire much to be seene, they ought to bee diligently admonished to flye gorgiousnesse and sumptuousnesse, al behauiours and doings, al woordes and lookes, that doe not serue but to shewe their beautie, and to drawe the worldlings, couetous and vndiscreete to gaze at them, for to bee led away with euil lustes to committe wickednesse, and to abuse their company: also the holy scripture, for to aduertise women of their behauiour, and what countenance they ought to holde, doeth 1. Cor. 11. 5. &. 14. 34. Ephe. 5. 2 1. Tim. 2. 9. &. 5. 4. Tit. 2. 4. 5. 1. Pet. 3. 1. teache them howe they ought to behaue themselues in al their kind of life, whether it be in publike, or in priuate, whether it be in ma∣riage, or in widowhood. If women doe otherwise, they defile the beautie that God hath giuen them, and doe despise this honest and pleasant gift of God: and so they become vnthankeful, not estee∣ming the beautie which God by his grace hath bestowed vpō them, as they ought. Solomon doeth wel signifie it, when hee sayth, As a iewel of golde in a swynes snout, &c, The swyne is so much giuen to wroote with her nussel or with her snout in the earth, euen in the myre and durte, that the faire ornamantes and precious iewelles doo nothing become her: if they bestowe any vppon her, it is in vaine, for shee doeth defile them without any discretion: euen so the woman which doeth reiect the former holy admoniti∣ons, and doeth guide herselfe without wisedome, counsel, reason, and honestie, by giuing herselfe to be light and gadding, and folow∣ing the dissolutenesse and intisementes, for to liue in pleasures, and lustes and desires of the fleshe, she hath in vaine receiued beautie. For being of so wanton behauiour and countenance, shee defileth and destroyeth, so much as shee can, the precious iewel of beautie
that God hath giuen her. Heere we may see that the whores which delight in their beautie, are much deceiued: they make themselues beleeue that they are faire and gorgeous: and haue so long wallo∣wed and plundged in the mire and filth, that there is no stink in the world so infectiue as they are, so that the fauour of them ascendeth vp to heauen, and maketh them abhominable before God. We know it by his lawe, when he forbiddetth to commit who redome, and al∣so Esay. 3. 15. 1. Cor. 6. 9. Heb. 13. 4. by his threateninges that hee maketh against the adulterers and whores in the thirteenth to the Hebrewes. 23 The desire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation. Solomon doeth wel shewe vs heere, that we must not trust to the iudgement of the worlde, nor to that which wee see outwardly, for as it hath beene alreadie handeled, the righteous in this worlde are in so miserable estate after the outwarde apparance, that it see∣meth God hateth them, and that hee seeketh to destroy and kil thē: and therefore if they hope that any good shal happen vnto them, yet is their hope nothing worth: for, it seemeth, there can happen nothing vnto them but euil, seeing that in the iudgement of the worlde they haue God against them. But as hath beene saide, So∣lomon will not haue vs to bee of suche an opinion, when he saith, That the desire of the righteous is onely good. They desire that God woulde bee merciful vnto them in al their affaires and needes, and should assist them, and should neuer forsake them, but that after hee hath deliuered them from al misery, hee would giue vnto them of his meere liberalitie and grace, euerlasting felicitie in the king∣dome of heauen: and as they desire and hope, so they obteine. The Lorde also wil bee a refuge for the poore, a refuge in due time, euen in affliction. And they that knowe thy name, will trust in thee, Psal. 9. 9. 10. &. 37. Psal. 145. 18 for thou Lorde, hast not failed them that seeke thee. Trust thou in the Lorde and doe good: dwell in the lande, and thou shalt bee fed assuredly. The Lorde is neere vnto al that call vppon him: yea, that cal vpon him in trueth. We plainely see that there happeneth nothing but good vnto the righteous according to their wishe and hope. Wherefore casting aside the iudgement of the worlde, let vs
giue ourselues vnto righteousnesse, desiring the aide and helpe of god, for to guid & hold vs in the same: & in what sort soeuer we be shaken, wee shal not fal but vpon our feete. Contrarily, the wicked doe prosper in suche wise, that it seemeth that God doeth fauour them: and with open mouth they are called honest men. And ther∣fore they make themselues beleeue, and haue this vaine hope, that they shall not perishe: and in the meane while they care not what they doe: they abounde in wickednesse, and spare neither God nor their neighbours: whereupon they prouoke the Lorde vnto wrath against them: as Solomon doeth signifie, saying, But the hope of the wicked is indignation. The Psalmes before alledged doe shewe it wel, and also many examples of the Scripture. Let vs not then enuie the state of the wicked, but let vs pray that it woulde please God to direct vs in his way, and that al our desires may rest in the same. In this manner wee shall auoide the indignation and displeasure, and shall obteine the good that wee wishe for. Wee shal auoid indignation by two kinde of waies: for not being made voide of our desires and hope, we shal not dispite ourselues against God, and shal not blaspheme as the wicked doe, and we shal not also prouoke his indignation against vs. 24 There is that scattereth, and is more encreased: but he that spareth more then is right, surely commeth to pouertie. After the iudgement of the worlde, and feeling of the fleshe, the manner to abound in worldly wealth, is to get and lay vp for himselfe and to keepe and holde it, and not to disperse the fruites which come there of, but to make a treasure of them, and to spende them warily for his owne vsage. For wee see by experience that they which doe so vse thē, become soone rich, or at leastwise are esteemed such: for we see them to possesse much goods. Cōtrarily, they which make great cost, though they greatly abound, doe consume them by litle & litle: and specially they which dispend riotously & prodigally where there is no need, but in pomp, in delicacie, pleasure, & ostēta∣tion. Wee see this almost daily come to passe: but also on the other side, there be which are liberal, & distribute their goods plentifully,
and yet ceasse not but still to abounde, and doe greatly encrease: contrarily, there are which bee so sparing, that they wil not vse nor shew mercy where need requireth: and yet they wast, & come vn∣to pouertie. Although the first is of the greatest shew and that it is commonly seene with the eye, yet is it not so certaine as the con∣trary. For this cause Solomon not staying himselfe by the sight of the eies, doubteth not to say, There is that scattereth, and is more encreased. And heerein hee agreeth with the saying of the Psalme, A smal thing that the righteous hath, is better then great riches of the vngodly. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lorde. &c. Riches Psal. 37. 16. Psal. 112. 1. &. 3. &. 15. 2 &. 28. 4. and plenteousnesse shalbe in his house: and his righteousnes endu∣reth for euer. When the saints did speake in this sorte, they were more stayed vpon the promises of God, & feared his threatenings, then that which they sawe outwarde with their eyes, being assured that the worde of the Lorde neuer faileth. Wherefore let vs not tary at that which wee see with our eies, but let vs leane vpon this worde, the which our Lorde doeth strongly confirme vnto vs in di∣uers Math. 6. & 19. Lvke. 6. &. 12. &. 16. 2. Coa. 9. Gala. 6. places: and let vs note that hee saith not, that all they whiche scatter, shal encrease: for the prodigal which dispende without rea∣son, doe decrease. Againe also hee saith not simply, Hee that spa∣reth, for it behoueth a father of houshold to be sober & temperate, not making excessiue & superfluous expenses, but honest and reaso∣nable, for to mainteine his family, and to helpe the necessitie of the poore: and therefore hee addeth without equitie, or more then is right, or aboue measure: as doe the vsurers and couetous, which haue no pitie vpon the poore: and euen the greatest parte of such people are so cruell and vnmercifull, that they suffer their fami∣ly to endure much hardnesse: wherefore they are wel worthie to come to pouertie. Giue, and it shalbe giuen vnto you, &c. And Luke. 6. 38. therefore though we do not alwaies see the necessitie of such peo∣ple, yet let vs know that they are miserable and poore: for the co∣uetous are alwaies needie. Hee that loueth siluer, shal not be satis∣fied with siluer, and he that loueth riches shall be without the fruite Eccle. 5. 9. thereof. But that which is the greatest pouertie of al, & which sure∣ly ought to feare the niggardes, and couetous, and cruel vsurers, is Math. 25. 4. Iam. 5. 3. the depriuation and loosing of the true and heauenly riches.
25 The liberall person shall haue plentie: and he that wate∣reth, shall also haue rayne. Solomon doeth heere confirme the first parte of the former sentence, and giueth a reason thereof: for the which to vnderstand wel, let vs first note, the Hebrue hath, The soule of the blessing shalbee made fat. The which is expounded after this sort, The liberall person, is he that of free will and good minde doeth blesse his neigh∣bours, not with worde, but in trueth and deede, and in worke, hel∣ping and succouring them according to their neede. Blessing is taken in this signification in the holy Scripture, The soule then of 1. Sam. 25. 27. 2. Cor. 5. 9. Deut. 32. 15. Iob. 36. 16. Psal. 22. 30▪ &. 23. 5. blessing, is the liberal person: vnto whome Solomon promiseth fatnesse, that is to say, that hee shall liue at his ease, and shall haue his pleasures, and shal prosper in aboundance of wealth. Fatnesse is thus taken in diuers places. And when hee addeth, And he that watereth, &c. Hee repeateth the same thing againe for a greater expression: for as a peece of lande wel watered, bringeth foorth easily his fruite, euen so when wee doe helpe the necessitie of the poore, so much as in vs is, wee make them fruiteful, for they fare the better for it, and are more apt to doe their duetie. Thus doing wee shall not loose our labour, for the Lorde by his grace and good∣nesse, doeth recompence and yeelde vs the like: as Solomon doeth signifie it, saying, shall also haue raine. As the raine watereth the earth, and maketh it to spring and bring foorth fruite: euen so the Lorde augmenteth the goods and riches of the merciful and li∣beral. If thou powre out thy soule to the hungry, and refreshe Esay. 58. 10. 11. the troubled soule: then shal thy light spring out of the darkenesse, and thy darkenesse shall bee as the noone day. And the Lorde shall guide thee continually, and satisfie thy soule in drought, and make fat thy bones, and thou shalt bee like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters faile not. And their soule shalbee as a watered garden, and they shal haue no sorow. Furthermore, let vs Iere. 31. 12 note, that seeing the goodnesse that wee doe to our neighbours, is compared vnto watering and sprinckling, that wee must not spare them no more then water, when wee haue so to doe and neede re∣quireth.
16 Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curse him: but blessing shall bee on the head of him that selleth corne. For to turne vs away from vsury, catching, theeuery, and co∣uetousnes, Solomon is not cōtented to haue threatened him which spareth more then is right, with pouertie: but to make vs the more to abhorre suche wickednesse, hee sheweth vs in what estimation they are with the people which spare against equitie, and how they deserue to bee spoken of, when hee saith, Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curse him: We doe gladly blesse them which wee haue in good reputation, and whome wee esteeme ho∣nest men, and wee doe not curse them: wherevppon followeth: the people doe iudge them wicked men, which withholde the corne, sith they doe curse them, as they deserue. But albeit that in cursing suche people, the people doeth but that which they deserued, yet is it not to say that Solomon alloweth such cursing, nor yet that it is lawful for the people to curse them that heighten the price of victu∣als, the which are signified vnto vs by the wheate or corne, which is the most ordinary and common meate, euen the most necessariest. The making deare and also the depriuation of the same is signified vnto vs by this withdrawing. For these couetous and wicked ones, vsurers, and theeues, yea cruel murderers, doe gather on al sides so muche as they can, the victuals, that none may come by them but at their commandement, and shoulde passe through their handes: and chiefly they locke vp the corne, desiring that it might bee deere, too robbe the poore people of gold & siluer, and also of possessions, and that they might rake al to themselues, and that in this sorte they might waxe riche, to the hurt of their neighbours, whom they make sorowful. Suche folke are somewhat acquainted with great men, which treade downe the people, who are threatened by the iudge∣ment of God. The Lorde wil enter into iudgement with the elders of his people, and princes thereof: for yee haue eaten vp the vine∣yarde: Esay. 3. 14. Amos. 8. 4. the spoyle of the poore is in your houses. &c. And are like vn∣to them of whome Amos speaketh. Heare this, O yee that swallow vp the pore, that ye may make the needy of the land to faile, saying,
When wil the newe moneth be gone, that wee may sel corne? and the Sabboth, that we may set foorth wheate, and make the Ephah smal, and the Shekel great, and falsifie the weightes by deceipt? &c. If they deserue the iudgement and punishment of God, euen eter∣nal, they are wel worthie that God should set them in contempt & shame, and in temporall curse, the which is the beginning of their hel and eternal paine. For when cursing is spoken of, Solomon doth not meane in wordes onely, but also the people feeling themselues too sore oppressed with necessitie and scarcitie by the raking of them which withdraw the corne, shal rebel, and rise vp against them for to spoyle and robbe, as experience sheweth. Notwithstanding, as hath beene saide, it is not to say that Solomon doeth promise any such thing: yea, and the Magistrates ought to punishe such rebels, what pouertie soeuer they suffer by the spoile of them which labour to enriche themselues by locking vp the corne: and sith that they are punishable by men, it foloweth also that they offende God with cursing. The people then what wrong, iniurie, and outrage soeuer they suffer, must be patient, and not render euil for euil. Mat. 5. 39. And although it be not lawful for the poore people to curse them which withholde the corne, yet suche couetous persons ought well to feare suche cursing of the people, and to wit, that it is not without cause that Solomon doeth threaten them with this cursing. For al∣beit the curse of the people is not iust, yet for to punishe the coue∣tous, wicked, and vsurers, it shal take effect. The Lorde wil heare such a cursing for to destroy and ouerthrowe these wicked men: for asmuch as God vseth the common people as instrumentes and or∣ganes 1. Cor. 13. 4. for to curse them: and not that the people in so cursing de∣serue to bee hearde: for they are ledde with the desire of their Deut. 15. . owne profite, wherevnto the faithful ought to haue no regarde, but ought to bee led with charitie, which is patient, and suffereth long. Nowe that the curse is hard, wee may gather it out of that which is saide, Beware that there bee not a wicked thought in thine heart, to say, The seuenth yeere, the yere of freedom is at hand: therfore it greeueth thee to looke on thy poore brother, & thou giuest him nought, and he crie vnto the Lorde against thee, so that sinne bee in thee. For if hee curse thee in the bitternesse of his soule, his prayer Eccle. 4. 6.
shalbee heard of him that made him. And as for to turne vs away from vsury, spoyling and extortion, euen so also for to leade vs to bee liberall, and to exercise mercy, hee saith vnto vs, But blessing shall bee on the head of him that selleth corne. For by these wordes he teacheth vs in what estimation they are which sell their corne re∣sonably, and what men speake of them, also howe well they are be∣loued and honoured, and euery man is ready to doe them pleasure, and seruice, and to bee at their commandement. Solomon signifieth this same by the blessing of the head: for in place that the people would gladly haue the regraters head, where his feete are, & would gladly braine them, he beareth honor and reuerence vnto the liberal & merciful, & desireth their conseruation, where about they occupy themselues so much as they can. Heereof we haue an excellent ex∣ample in Ioseph. But some wil say against it, that it seemeth that Io∣seph, after the sentence of Solomon, deserued to be cursed of the Gen. 41. & 42. & 43. people: for hee shut vp the corne, and during the famine, none had any but by his commandement. I answere, That it was by di∣uine reuelation that hee gathered the corne together, not to make it deare, neither to make himselfe riche with the sale thereof, but for to helpe the necessitie of the countrie of Egypt, & of them which dwelt about it. And so he was not a withdrawer of the corne, but a seller: not like vnto the sellers at this day, which doe rather de∣serue to be called exactours, flears of men, and murtherers, then sel∣lers: for as they proceed therein they drinke the blood, & sucke out the mary of the bones of the poore. It is not of such sellers that So∣lomon speaketh, but of them which are like vnto Ioseph. And as the curse of the people is heard of God, and so the withdrawers of corne are not cursed only of men, but also of God: euen so the bles∣sing of them which blesse the sellers, is hearde: and so they haue not only the blessing of men, but they haue also the same of God. Wher∣vpon it foloweth that in this sentence there is not a threatening & promise presently, but also for to come. Wherefore the cruel coue∣tous ought to bee greatly feared, and the merciful and liberal ought to be comforted. And we ought to vnderstande that if the seller bee blessed, that by a greater reason hee which giueth, shal obteine bles∣sing: not that his almes can deserue it, but because that Christ hath
so promised: Blessed are the merciful, for they shal obteine mer∣cie. Mat. 5. 7. 27 He that seeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that seeketh euill, it shall come to him. Solomon heeretofore hath pronounced sentences, whereby hee hath taught vs to abhorre couetousnes: and namely he hath said it. He stil pursueth nowe the same argument, when he saith, Hee that seeketh good things, getteth fauour, &c. When Solomon, for to induce vs vnto liberalitie and mercy, saith simplie, he that seeketh good thinges: and addeth not, of his neighbours: he sheweth vs, that they which haue none other desire and affection but to doe their worke, and care not to helpe the needinesse of the poore, doe not procure the good, but also their studie is vpon euil, to doe hurt and to destroy. For as wee wil not say of a tree, that it bringeth foorth good fruite, except wee haue tasted thereof: euen so if a man doe not communicate his worke vnto his neighbours, and make them partakers of his labour, wee cannot say truely, that he seeketh good things: for he that hath care but for himselfe, hath no loue, without the which al is nothing worth. Likewise Saint Paul conioi∣neth the procuring of thinges good and honest with charitie. Like∣wise 1. Cor. 13. 1. Rom. 12. 17. 2. Cor. 8. 21. shewing the care that he hath for his poore neighbors, he saith, We prouide for honest thinges not onely before the Lorde, but also before men. Nowe for to shewe vs howe wee must seeke for good thinges; Solomon vseth a word in his tongue, which is taken of the spring of the morning, and signifieth, to seeke early. Wherein wee are taught, that we must not be slacke and slouthful, when necessitie requireth to doe any thing for them which haue neede of our helpe & succour: but that wee must be careful and diligent. Our Lorde doth teache vs the very same, when hee commandeth vs to watche Mat. 24. 42. & 25. 1. 14. continually, and that wee should be like vnto the faithful and wise seruant. Again, by the similitudes of the virgins and the talents, &c. And if in the corporal necessitie wee must be watchful, and carefull to doe well vnto our needie neighbours, by a more stronge reason wee must diligently watch and trauaile for to edifie the conscien∣ces of the weake, of the ignorant, and vnbeleeuing, which are void
of spiritual goodnesse, which is the good that al Christians shoulde procure, and chiefly the Ministers and the pastours of the church. Likewise the Magistrates ought to procure the welth of the people, ouer which they are committed of God, whose authoritie & power they haue. But to procure good things wel, we must followe the instructiōs that are giuē vs. If euery mā in his estate would pro∣cure good things as they ought, they should get fauour, as Solomon doeth promise it: that is to say first of al, that hee shalbee pleasing Exo. 18. 21 Psal. 2. 10. &. 82. 3. 2. Chro. 19. 6 Rom. 13. and acceptable, and shal worke loue to himselfe: he shalbe wel wel∣come, and men wil labour to do them pleasure, seruice and honor: and which is the chiefest, and the most to bee desired, is that God wil beare him fauour, loue him, & wil delight in him, wil assist him and be merciful vnto him, and wil keep that no euil shal happen vnto him, which shal destroy him: but he wil preserue him, that he make him blessed for euer: The Lorde delighteh in them that feare him, and attende vpon his mercy. Bodily exercise profiteth litle: but Psa. 147. 11. godlinesse is profitable vnto al thinges, which hath the promise of the life present, and of that that is to come. It is very expedient for 1. Tim. 4. 8 vs that in seeking the good, wee shoulde chiefly get the fauour of God: for it happeneth most commonly, that if wee doe our dutie in the estate wherein wee are called, that men in steede of being fa∣vourable, as they ought, doe hate & persecute vs. Wherevpon we must not be abashed, nor ceasse for al that to seek for good things: for the like hath happened to our predecessours, and aboue al vnto our Lorde and maister Iesus Christ. But although the getting of fa∣uor is here spoken of, and chiefly of god, let vs not set God in equal degree with mē, the which we may bind to ourselues to beare vs fa∣uour by our wel doinges. It is not so with God, for hee cannot bee bounde to vs, whatsoeuer wee can doe. And so, when wee obteine fauour of him without any permutation, and without receiuing a∣ny rewarde of vs, because that wee receiue of him, of his onely grace, gift, and liberalitie: yet doth it not ceasse vnto vs to bee true getting. For if we say that there is not better getting, then that which is gotten by gift, we must not thinke strange though wee call that which god giueth vs of his meereliberalitie getting. Besides the Pro. 4. 5. 6. 7. Esay. 55. 1. common maner of speaking, wee haue the Scripture which exhor∣teth
vs to get without any permutation. Moreouer, besides this, let vs note that as they which procure good things, haue promise of fauour: So also they whose wealth wee seeke, are admonished of their duties, euery one in his degree. And therefore let vs not fol∣lowe the opinion of fantastical felowes, which are not thankful for a good turne receiued of their neighbours. But as for to induce vs vnto liberalitie, Solomon doth set before vs this promise: also for to turne vs away from doing hurt vnto our neighbours, hee setteth a threatening, saying: But hee that seeketh euill, it shall come vn∣to him. Forasmuch as Solomon hath set seeking of euill, against the seeking of good: hee doth signifie vnto vs, that hee speaketh of the hurte that wee procure vnto our neighbours, & calamities, and mi∣series, whereto wee endeuour to bring them, and of the destruction and ouerthrowe that wee goe about to seeke for them, for to make our particular profite, and to come vnto the end of our purposes and intents. And when against getting of fauour, hee threateneth euill to come, hee signifieth that the wicked which seeke for nothing but the hurte of their neighbours, shalbe depriued of al fauour, and chiefly towards God, who wil beate them downe, from the which they shal neuer escape. Beholde hee trauelleth with mischiefe: he Psal. 7. 15. 16. hath conceiued sorowe, and brought forth vngodlinesse. Hee hath grauen and digged vp a pit: and is fallen himselfe into the destru∣ction that he hath made for other. Of this nūber were Caine, Saule, Absolon, Iudas, and others, who after the sight of the eyes haue got ten fauour, the which ought not to be accounted of, seeing that it did not preserue them from wickedly perishing. 28 He that trusteth in his riches, shall fall but the righte∣ous shall florishe as a leafe. Solomon pronounceth heere a sentence which is very harde to bee beleeued, and as it seemeth, the experience is in the contra∣ry: and therefore the worldlinges and carnal men, which are coue∣tous, do despise it, and mocke thereat. This same is but too too common, and hath no neede of probation: notwithstanding there Luke. 16. shalbe no inconuenience to bring forth one example, it is rehearsed that after Iesus Christ had admonished his disciples by the act of the steward, to be liberal, & not to set their harts vpō riches, it is said
that the Pharisees which were couetous did mocke at him. Nowe of our own nature we are no better then the Pharisees: it seemeth vnto vs that riches are very profitable, and that they are of great power and excellencie, and that they which haue them with abun∣dance, are well stayed and vpholden: and in this sort wee make ri∣ches our God, and cast behinde vs, and despise the true God, which giueth abundantly al things for to vse. The couetous which would bee esteemed saints and deuout persons, doe make themselues be∣leeue that to set our heartes on the goods of this worlde, doeth not let vs to serue God: and euen the greatest theeues and vsurers doe iudge that they haue doone a great act, & very much for God, when of their rauening they haue laide aside some parte, for to bestow in the seruice of God, fained by men, or els that they haue made godly Legacies by testament, not departing with any thing whiles they liue, for feare they should want themselues. But our Lord doth pro∣nounce vnto vs, No man can serue two maisters. &c. Hee sheweth it also by the seed cast amongst thornes: for if the word which doth teach vs, & guide vs to serue god, be choked, it is vnpossible for vs to serue God: but we do despise and reiect him, to become riche, and to encrease in temporal goods: yea and there are some that are so vnshamefast, and so ouercome with vnbrideled lustes, that they de∣termine wholy to forsake god for a time, that they may become rich and are not ashamed to teach others to do the like. In such manner of folkes is fulfilled that which is saide, That they which woulde be 1. Tim. 6. 9. rich. fal into temptation. They which vse them after such a sort, de∣serue wel destruction, and damnation, for they destory themselues wittingly: they are like vnto them which haue no strength, nor power to stande vpright of themselues, and yet they despise and reiecte him which doeth offer them a stay, and wil vpholde them. For albeit wee are, mooue, and haue our being in God: as hee onely is our Creator, euen so hee onely doeth guide vs, main∣teineth and gouerneth vs, & he onely is our stay and vpholder: and the couetous reiecting him, it followeth necessarily that they Actes. 17. 2 must fall. If wee haue true knowledge of this same, and that wee haue not the eyes of our vnderstanding and senses blinded with the brightnesse of the glory and pompe of the
prosperitie and triumphe of the worldly riches, it shall not be very easie to beleeue that he which trusteth in his riches, shall fall, as So∣lomon doth here pronounce. And before him Dauid, As for the vn∣godly, Psal. 37. 20. they shall perishe, and the enimies of the Lorde shal consume as the fat of lambes: yea, euen as the smoke shal they consume a∣way. Psal. 49. 11. Againe, And they thinke that their houses shal continue for euer. And albeit that wee alwaies see not with the eie the fal of the couetous and of them which haue set their heartes vppon riches, yet neuerthelesse let vs not desire to bee like them, but let vs knowe for certaine that they shal fal so downe, that they shal neuer more arise from the same. They well deserue suche a fal: for too make themselues riche, and for to mainteine them in their wealth, they Mat. 19. 23. vse wicked meanes and are led with vngodly affections, and passe not though they doe wrong vnto their neighbours, but the greatest parte of suche people doe studie and delight to doe iuiurie & wrong vnto their neighbours. Solomon doeth signifie it, when against him which trusteth in his riches, he setteth the righteous: to whom he maketh a very pleasant promise, whē he saith, But the righteous shall florishe as a leafe: but the same is no lesse harde to be beleued then the former threatening: for the wicked so muche as they can, do bring the righteous, into so poore estate and case, that it seemeth they shal neuer rise vp more: and therefore they mocke at the hope of the righteous. But not staying ourselues vpon the opinion of the worlde, nor in the sense of the fleshe, let vs trust vnto the promise of Solomon, before whome the Psalmist hath saide, that the righ∣teous Psal. 62. 11. shal florishe like a palme tree. Let vs then bee certaine that what miserie soeuer wee suffer, the Lorde wil restore vs vnto a pro∣sperous and pleasant state: as the same is signified vnto vs, by sprin∣ging, bringing foorth, and florishing, heere and in other places. As heereafter, Iacob shal take roote: Israel shal florishe and growe, and Esay. 27. 6. &. 35. 1. Ose. 14. 6. & 6. the worlde shalbe filled with fruite. The Desert and the wildernes shal reioyce: and the wast ground shalbe glad and florish as a rose. I wil be as the dewe vnto Israel hee shal growe as the Lilly, and fasten his rootes as the trees of Lybanon: his branches shal spread, and his beautie shalbe as the Oliue tree, and his smel as Lybanon. Solomon also in this place doeth wel shew it, when against falling which signifieth misery and destruction, hee setteth florishing.
And in them both, he vseth the future tence or time to come, wher∣by he doeth somewhat signifie that there shalbe no ende of the fal∣ling of the wicked, nor yet in the prosperitie of the righteous. Ie∣remie doeth likewise signifie it, when he saith, Cursed bee the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arme, and withdraweth Iere. 17. 5. his hart from the Lord. For hee shalbe like the heathe in the wilder∣nesse, and shal not see when any good commeth, but shal inhabite 6 the parched places in the wildernesse, in a salt lande, and not inhabi∣ted. Blessed be the man that trusteth in the Lorde, and whose hope 7 the Lorde is. For hee shalbe as a tree that is planted by the water, which spreadeth out her rootes by the riuer, and shal not feele whē 8 the heate commeth, but her leafe shalbe greene, and shal not care for the yeere of drought, neither shal ceasse from yeelding fruite. And in the first Psalme, when hee compareth the state of the wic∣ked with him that delighteth in the lawe of the Lorde. 29 Hee that troubleth his owne house, shall inherite the winde: and the foole shalbe seruant vnto the wise in hearte. Albeit that (as wee haue seene) it is a dangerous thing to trust in riches, and a profitable thing for vs to be giuen vnto righteousnes: yet to possesse and to vse riches for to succour our houshold at need, is not against righteousnes: they rather serue to bring foorth fruits of righteousnesse and equitie. Many of the olde fathers did abound in wealth, and yet ceassed not to bee righteous: As Abraham, Iob, and the good kinges of Iuda, for they did not set their heartes vpon them, but vsed them as though they enioyed none. Abraham hath wel shewed it in dwelling in the promised lande as a stranger, and in patiētly bearing many remouings & pilgrimages which it beho∣ued him to make. Iob also hath shewed it by the great pacience that he had in the losse of his children, & of his goods, & of his health. The holy fathers which haue thus vsed them, had alwaies enough, and were neuer voide of riches, but were contented, and by wise∣dome did gouerne housholders quietly, and did keepe their family in subiection and obedience, and had authoritie & preheminence ouer their childrē and houshold seruants. If wee follow them (as is very necessary for al heads and fathers of houshold) our businesse shalbe
quietly gouerned, we shal possesse so much goods as shalbe necessary, we shal haue credite and authoritie with our familie, the which shalbe at our commandement for to giue vs al obedience, and please vs in al things. But contrarily, if we burne with couetousnesse, & ther∣by we spare more then is right and reason, not helping the needes of our family, & so do trouble it, making the same sorowful, & giuing it occasion of sorrow, and to spite vs, and to worke our destruction, and labour to take, steale, and to pul from vs what they can, we must looke for a great pouertie, through which we shalbe so astonished, that we shal loose our sense, and so we must be faine to become sub∣iect vnto them which can tel how to gouerne themselues wisely: so beastly and feareful shal we be by our misery. Solomon doth signi∣fie the same saying, He that troubleth his owne house, &c. In the first part of this sentence he compareth the couetous foole vnto him which breaketh & pearseth through the walles of an house, so that the wind entereth in on al sides. Now as the wind vanisheth & can∣not be holdē back: euen so they which spēd their riches to the hinde∣rance of their family, shal not enioy them at their desire, but shalbe depriued of them miserably, and shal receiue no profite of thē. The winde is taken after this signification in Oseas, For they haue sowen the winde, and they shal reape the whirlewind. Againe, Ephraim is Oseas. 8. 7. &. 12. 1 fed with the wind, and foloweth after the East wind. Also such as are prodigal & riotous spenders of goods, shalbe heires of wind. For as in consuming their goods without discretion and good aduise, they doe loose them, if they did cast chaffe in the winde, the which doeth carry and scatter it so farre abroade, that it cannot be recouered: but they are worthy to beheires of wind, that is to say to haue nothing: for also they trouble their owne house bringing their family into ne∣cessitie of begging their bread: and they themselues likewise con∣strained to beg: and for to obteine that which they desire either in al, or in part, they must humble themselues before good houskeepers which haue the discretion & wisdome to gouern and to spend their goods with reason. We may see this same by experiēce in folowing that which Solomon in the second part of this sentence sayth, The foole shalbe seruant to the wise in heart. The prodigal childe hath Luke. 15. 14 proued his part. &c. Furthermore, they inherite the wind which are so much giuen vnto quarrelling and law, that they care not against
whome they begin sute: and for to get peace and loue, they will quit, neither forgiue any thing howe little soeuer it bee that they thinke doeth belong vnto them, but rather then they woulde want of their purpose to obteine the victorie, they become enimies vnto al men. Such kind of people are worthie to haue nothing but wind: for they trouble their owne houses, experience doeth also shew it, that not only their houses, but also the kingdomes through braules and quarrels are ouerthwrone, and they which possesse them are driuen out, and are faine to become subiect vnto them whiche be∣fore were lesse then they. I haue seene the seruantes on horseback, and the Princes trot on foote as seruantes. And if the maister of an houshold ought to be wise, by a more strong reason thē ought kings & princes to be wise, which haue the townes, prouinces, & king∣domes in gouernmēt, to the end that they should not trouble their subiectes, nor guide them as becommeth: and that it doeth happen that their lordships & kingdomes must be transported vnto others: and that in this manner beeing spoyled, they inherite winde: and in steede of ruling, are brought vnder the power of another, by the sufferance of the Lorde, vnto whome it belongeth to remoue king∣domes, and to giue them vnto whome soeuer it pleaseth him. As the Prophets do teach vs, declaring that such mutatiōs do oftē hap∣pen Dan. 2. 21. &. 4. 14. 29. for the contempt of the Word, as hath bin seene amongst those miserable poore men which haue receiued that deuilish interim. 30 The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth soules, is wise. The righteous is not like vnto the couetous niggarde, neither vnto the witlesse prodigal, neither the quarrelling rufler, who doe profite no body, but doe trouble al men, and doe set all in disorder so that they destroy themselues, and doe not bring profite vntoo their neighbours, but hurte. But as the righteous hath not his trust in men, but doeth depende vppon the goodnesse of GOD which taketh care of his, and as hee prouideth what so euer is necessary, giuing him al thinges aboundantly for to vse, euen so doeth hee dispose them in such wise to the profite of his neigh∣bours, that hee bringeth foorth fruite the which doth quicken his
neighbours. Solomon doeth signifie this same: first of all, when he calleth the workes of the righteous, fruit: as also the holie Scrip∣ture doeth often in other places. For as the tree doeth not bring Psal. 1. 3. Iere. 17. 8. Mat. 7 & 12. foorth his fruit for it selfe, but for another: euen so the true righ∣teous, doeth not regard his own particular profite, but theirs which haue to doe with him. And as the fruite of the tree doeth nourishe and giue strength, euen so the righteous laboureth by his works to refreshe and quicken. Solomon doeth wel expresse it, when hee is Gen. 2. 9. not contented to say, is as a tree, but he addeth, of life, wherein hee alludeth vnto the tree of life which was planted in the midst of the garden of pleasure. For as if Adam in steede of eating of the tree of knowledge, had eaten of the tree of life, hee had not dyed, but had bene quickened for euer, and had reuiued his posteritie, the which hee hath made subiect vnto death: euen so the righteous doth pro∣fite his neighbours for the benefite of life, not onely temporal, but also eternal. For hee hath not care of the bodie onely, but also, and that chiefly of the soules. Hee doeth his workes for to helpe the ne∣cessities of his neighbours: and therewith and by the same, he ten∣deth to edifie them to saluation, giuing them a good example, that they may be warned to prayse God, and to giue him praise, for that that he leaueth them not vnprouided of good succour and helpe, and are taught that after their power they ought to doe vnto their neighbours as they would their neighbours should doe vnto them. Beeing thus builded, they shal liue eternally, and also they who so doe build them. Beholde howe the fruite of the righteous is as the tree of life. Secondly, Solomon doeth signifie vnto vs, that the righteous doeth bring foorth fruite which doth giue life vnto his neighbours, when he sayeth, And he that winneth soules, is wise. Wherein for to signifie, that the righteous by his good deeds and wel doing, doth drawe vnto him and winne mens soules, and doeth not suffer them to perishe: but doeth saue them according vnto the wisedome that God hath giuen him. Solomon compareth the iust man vnto a fi∣sher. For as the fisher, to take fishe, is faine to vse deceit and craft, suttletie and discretion, otherwise, hee taketh no fishe, but doeth driue them away, and so doth spende his time in vaine, and looseth his labour: euen so the righteous hath neede of wisedome, the
which may guide him so wisely in his affaires, that hee may winne his neighbours. And also because our Lord saieth vnto his Apostles, Folow me, and I wil make you fishers of men. Feare not, henceforth Mat. 4. 19. Luk. 5. 10. thou shalt take men: hee doeth endue them with great wisedome, filling them with his holie Spirite, for to guide and gouerne them in the taking of men. And in this we must learne, that Ministers of the Church chiefly stande in neede of wisdome, for to learne wel to take soules by good example and sounde doctrine. These are the nets that ought to be cast ouer the sea of this world, &c. Besides this, let vs note that Solomon comparing the righteous and wise man vnto a fisher, secretly admonisheth vs to bee watchful and careful. Wee see that they which occupie the trade of fishing, are vpon the water at al houres, except the winde be contrarie and doe let them: euen so also must we not let passe any occasion of time, for to do wel and say wel, for to drawe our neighbours vnto our nettes and snares. And the same must bee done with a great affection and maruellous desire: for if the fishermen for a temporal gaine, and that soone va∣nisheth away, are so careful, that they care not for their owne lyfe, the which they often put in danger: by a more stronge reason, no man ought to spare his owne person, when it is required to take soules, & to make a perpetual gain. For if they also proceede therein faithfully, they shal neuer loose their labour, nor forgo their reward. It is not like vnto fishing: for if the fishers do not take ought, they loose their gain, & so haue laboured in vaine: but they that fishe af∣ter Eze. 31. 9 & 33. 9. soules, are not depriued of gain, though they take nothing, pro∣uided that they do their duetie faithfully. When you enter into an house, salute the same: and if the house bee worthie, let your peace Mat. 10. 12. come vpon it: but if it be not worthie, let your peace return to you. And herein we are admonished not to be vnthankful towardes the Lord, which ceaseth not to reward vs wel; though we bring nothing to him: and not to forget the honour that he do vs when he doeth attribute vnto vs the taking of soules, the which is his worke, & not mans: this same is after a sort signified, when our Lorde saieth, Sy∣mon, launch foorth into the deepe, & let downe your nets to make Luk. 5. 4. 1. Cor. 3. 6. 2. Cor. 3. 5. Ephe. 2. 10. a draught: &c. And S. Paul doth plainly shew it: Who is Paul then? and who is Apollo, but the Ministers by whom ye beleeued, and as the Lord gaue to euerie man? Not that we be sufficient of ourselues,
to thinke any thing, as of ourselues: but our sufficiencie is of God. We are his workmanship created in Christ Iesus vnto good, which God hath ordained that we should walke in them. For it is God Phi. 2. 13. which worketh in you, both the wil & the deede, euen of his good pleasure. Finally, let vs note, that though we be neither iust nor wise, but so muche as wee are gouerned by the worde, it foloweth, that there is neither fruit of life, nor taking of soules in Poperie: for they are without the word: insteed of fruit, they haue deadly poison, the inuentions & doctrines of men, superstitions & idolatries: and in∣steede to be taken and caught, they are more drowned in the myre of this world. We may also adde, that sith that Solomon speaketh by similitude & comparison, we may apply this sentence vnto an other meaning, to wit, that the righteous doeth not inherite winde, as doeth hee that troubleth his house, but of his righteousnes hee ga∣thereth excellent fruit: and the wise is not like the foole, which hath no wisedome to drawe others vnto himselfe, and to make them to agree vnto him: but must himselfe consent, and be as it were made captiue and subiect vnto the wise, which hath knowledge so to go∣uerne himselfe, that hee draweth his neighbours vnto him by soft∣nesse and gentlenes, and other honest meanes. 31 Behold, the righteous shalbe recompensed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the sinner? We all naturally desire to haue recompense of our labour and trauel, and are glad when wee are promised we shalbe paide for that which is owing vs, and that none wil withholde our labour: and againe, more ioyful when we haue our desires granted, and promise perfourmed indeede. Neuertheles when Solomon speaketh heere of recompense, & doth shew it present, saying, Behold, if we vnderstād wel this meaning, he giueth none occasion vnto our flesh for to re∣ioyce: for he doth not promise such reward as it desireth, as temporal riches, worldly honours, fauour of men, delights & pleasures, peace and rest: but he doth threaten vs with the contrary, as we may see, First of al, when he sheweth the ready recōpēse of the righteous, say∣ing, Behold, or lo, here it is. Secondly, whē he saith in the earth. For the consideration and estate of the righteous in this life & world, is that they pay thē euil for good, they are afflcted & persecuted, they
are subiect vnto pouertie and miserie, vnto sicknesse, cold and heate, hunger and thirst, to sorowes and griefes: and most commonly they suffer such thinges so long as they liue in this world: as the holy an∣cient fathers haue tried, the Prophets, our Lorde Iesus Christe and his Apostles also. Wherevpon doe proceed these complaintes, False witnesses did rise vp: they laide to my charge thinges that I knewe Psal. 35. 11 & 38, 20. not. They rewarded me euil for good: to the great discomforte of my soule. They also that rewarde euil for good, are against me: be∣cause I folowe the thing that is good. And also other complaintes, as may be seene in the 3. 6. 10. and 13. Psalmes, &c. Thirdly, when he denounceth rewarde vnto the righteous, as vnto the wicked & sin∣ners, and doeth not put difference, but onely that by interrogation hee sheweth that there is a greater reason that the wicked & sinners should haue more greater recompense. For albeit, that al afflictions doe proceede from sinne, as from their first cause (for if Adam had not sinned, we should haue bene subiect vnto no afflictions) for the trueth is, there is no righteous man but sinneth, and consequently, which doeth not deserue the foresaide rewarde: but because the wicked doe sinne more, they deserue greater recompense. When Solomon declareth vnto the righteous this recompense or paiment, hee doeth admonishe them that they should arme themselues with patience: and what aduersities soeuer doeth happen vnto them, yet doe they not murmure, nor despight God which doeth afflict and chasten them. For albeit that the Deuil and the wicked doe perse∣cute them, yet doe the righteous suffer nothing but so farre as God slacketh the bridle to Satan and to the wicked, and maketh them ex∣ecutioners of his righteous iudgement, the which he doeth not ex∣ercise with rigour against the iust, as they doe wel deserue, what righteousnes soeuer they haue. Beholde Iob which hath witnes to be a perfect and vpright, and fearing God, yet God did afflict him by Satan, and by robbers his ministers and instrumentes: the which Iob confesseth verie wel, saying, The Lorde hath giuen, & the Lord hath takē: the name of the Lord be blessed. Shal man be more righ∣teous Iob. 1. 21. & 4. 17. & 9. 2. 3. then God? For howe shoulde man compared vnto God, bee iustified? If hee would dispute with him, he could not answere him one thing of a thousande. Nowe that it is not the rigour that God exerciseth his iudgement against the righteous, Solomon signifieth
it after a sort, when he doeth declare that they shalbe recompensed in earth. The righteous of themselues are neuer a whit better then the wicked and sinners, the which doe not onely deserue a temporal rewarde, but eternal: yet God is contented to chastice them in the earth, so long as they liue here, and wil not destroy them with the wicked, which shal perish eternally: and in this maner they shalbee more recompensed then the righteous, as they do wel deserue, when with al their might and ful course they folow wickednes, and with∣out remorse of conscience they giue themselues vnto vnshamefast∣nes, for to commit al vncleannes euen with greedines. But the righ∣teous are displeased at their transgressions and faultes, the which as they are not exempted in this worlde, euen so the Lord doeth cha∣sten them onely in earth: and therefore that they deserue wel cor∣rection, Solomon doeth cal recompense it, or paiment. And for to shewe that the chastisement is sweete, and that it doeth not tende to destruction and damnation, he saieth, on earth. Wherin we must obserue: first of al, that the righteous ought to walke in feare and humilitie, when they vnderstand that they are not so innocent but that they doe wel deserue that God shoulde correct them for their 1. Pet. 4. 17 12. faults, and that he beginneth to execute his iudgements with them. The which he doth for their trial: and therefore Saint Peter doeth admonishe vs, Dearely beloued, thinke it not straunge concerning the fierie tryal, which is amongst you, to prooue you, as though some strange thing were come vnto you. Secondly, the righteous haue here iust occasion for to reioyce & to be comforted, whē they vnderstande that God doeth not punishe them, for their faultes af∣ter this life, but here in earth hee doeth chastise them gentlely, in comparison of that which they haue deserued: and that to the ende that they should not perishe with the wicked worlde. Let vs then remember the admonition: My Sonne, despise not the chastening 1. Cor. 11. 32 Hebr. 12. 5 of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lorde loueth, he chasteneth. Albeit then, that it is for our sinnes that God doeth recompense vs, sending vs afflictions, neuerthelesse hee doeth not proceede through hatred, but by loue and good affection that hee beareth vs, as a good father his children. Thirdly, when the righteous are set against the wicked, we knowe that not∣withstanding that the righteous of themselues are no more worth
then the wicked, yet their faultes are not imputed vnto them, and for the same they shal not perish: as also it is signified after a sorte, when they are not so much recompensed as are the wicked. This re∣compense of the righteous is the rod of man, whereof God speaketh vnto Dauid. But there is here a verie feareful threatening for them 2. Sam. 7. 14. which hate the good, and haue bent al their desire vnto euil, by the which they suffer themselues to be so caried away, that they are gi∣uen vnto dissolute and slanderous life, without any shame or hone∣stie. These are they which Solomon calleth wicked and sinners. The righteous doe sinne indeed, and doe commit verie grieuous faltes, but they abhorre them, they are greeued for them, and do take heed 1. Pet. 4. 15. to be slanderous: as Saint Peter doeth admonish. Let none of you suffer as a murderer or as an euil doer, &c. This is not without cause that this threatening ought to be feareful to the wicked. For if they haue the afflictions of the righteous in abhomination, iudging thē to be persecuted of God, & doe feare the like aduersities: by a more strong reason they ought to be greatly afraid of the rewarde which Shlomō setteth forth vnto thē. For it shalbe greater then that which they see happē vnto the righteous, the which they wold not receiue, so much doe they thinke it harde & sharpe. The Lord striketh his first of al, & seemeth to spare the wicked: wherevpō after the feeling of the flesh, the state of the righteous seemeth to be miserable in cō∣parison of the same of the wicked. Solomon doth after a sort signifie this same, whē he setteth the recōpēce of the iust present, saying, Be∣hold, and maketh mētion of it before the same of the wicked. And S. Peter declareth plainly, saying, It is time that iudgemēt begin at the houshold of God. But the long sufferāce doth nothing profit the ob∣stinate 1. Pet. 4. 17. wicked: as Solomō doth here shew, saying. How much more &c. Esay saith, But when the Lorde hath accōplished al stis worke Esay. 10. 12. vpon mount Syon & Ierusalem, I wil visite the fruite of the proude heart of the king of Asshur, &c. And if it first begin at vs, what shall the end be of thē which obey not the gospel of God? Albeit thē that the wicked seeme to be without feare in afflicting the faithfull: yet 1. Pet. 4. 17 shal they not faile of their paiment. For it is a righteous thing with God, to recōpence tribulation to thē that trouble you, &c. Contra∣rily, in our afflictiōs, let vs take courage, saying with Paul. Therfore 2. The. 1. 6. 2. Cor. 4. 16. we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inwarde man is renewed dayly.
The twelfth Chapter. 1 He that loueth instruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole. WE are al of this nature, that wee boast ourselues to haue great desire to be instructed, & we persuade ourselues that we loue knowledge: and also we commonly say, that knowledge is a goodly thing: as it is indeede: and not only goodly, but of great profite and pleasure. For thereby wee rightly gouerne ourselues and our affaires in this life: and al our enterprises do prosper wel when they are gouerned by knowledge: and therin we receiue profite, and also great delectation: for by knowledge we are so assured, that we proceede in doing our duetie without doubting or feare: knowing and confessing that whatsoeuer we doe (be it in word or deed) is wel done, and it is that which we should do. Now when we doe thus bragge, we do giue signification that we abhorre ignorāce: as indeed it ought to be detested, seeing not only that it is troublesome, but also vnprofitable and hurtful. From the tyme that Adam sinned, darknesse entred into the world, and men loued dark∣nesse more then light: and so haue they walked in ignorance, where∣by they were giuen to al wickednes, and in this manner haue depri∣ued themselues of life, & are fallen into death. But it is not enough to bragge of these foresaide thinges: the chiefe point is, that indeed we should abhorre ignorance, and loue knowledge, not that which Pro. 2. 1. hath but a vain shew, and is only praised of men: but that which is allowed before God, the which is giuen vnto vs of him, when hee eacheth vs by his word, & are diligent to receiue it. And to the end that we should not deceiue ourselues, persuading ourselues that we loue knowledge, wheras we do abhorre it, Solomon doth giue vs a certaine marke, for to iudge rightly whether we loue knowledge or no: This is instruction: when it pleaseth and is acceptable vnto our minde. For he saith, He that loueth instruction, loueth knowledge. Albeit thē that we do vse to sermōs, & read the scriptures, & that we
can talke finely of them, yet if wee be so high that it seemeth vnto vs we can learne no more, and wil not suffer ourselues to be admo∣nished, that we should be taught, corrected, and reprooued where it is needful, wee doe not loue knowledge. But if confessing our igno∣rance, our faultes and imperfections, we take wel in worth that we be taught, admonished, and reprooued, we loue instruction, and cōsequently knowledge. Now that instruction importeth teaching, exhortation, shewing, correction, and reprehension, first of all wee may vnderstande it by the deriuation of the worde which Solomon vseth here in this place. Secondly, when in the first Chapter & eight verse, instruction & doctrine are ioyned together, & in the two and twentith verse, by the complaint of wisedome, and 23. verse, by his admonition: & the 4. Chap. & 1. verse, Children, heare the instructi∣on of a Father. Thirdly, when here against to loue instruction, he set∣teth to hate correction, & against the louer of knowledge, he setteth the foole, saying, But he that hateth correction, is a foole: hee doeth shew vs that the foolish are the contemners & scorners of God, and of his word, the obstinat & stifnecked which harden themselues in their wickednes, for al the exhortation that is made them. It is saide of them, Such as be foolish, shal not stande in thy sight: for thou ha∣test Psal. 5. 5. al them that worke vanitie: but for their contempt and obstina∣cie, they shal perish with the foolish: as aboue in the 1. Chapter and 22. verse. To the end thē that we may not perish with the folish, let vs loue instruction, & let vs not hate correction: and for to do this, let vs be armed with patience, that willingly and with a ioyful hearte we may suffer al afflictions & aduersities, & let vs beare the Crosse, mortifying our flesh, by diuers tribulations. For instruction or cor∣rection, lyeth not onely in wordes of admonition, reprehension and threatening: but also in al sufferinges whatsoeuer it shal please God to send vs. Solomon hath exhorted vs vnto this patience of the Crosse, aboue in the 3. Chapter, verses 11. 12. The Apostle doeth ex∣pounde Hebr. 12. it after this sort, saying, Let vs runne with patience the race that is set before vs. 2 A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne. What good workes soeuer we do, yet must we confesse that wee are vnprofitable seruants: and also that there is no man liuing that Luk. 17. 10
doth good and sinneth not. Let vs not think that by our good deeds we can deserue to drawe the fauour of God vnto vs. Notwithstan∣ding, sith it is saide, That a good man getteth fauour: &c. it is ne∣cessarie that wee shoulde giue ourselues vnto wel doing, if wee will drawe vnto vs the fauour of the Lord. For as it is necessarie that the Mat. 12. . good tree should bring forth his good fruit in his due seasō, euē so, if we be good, we must giue ourselues vnto goodnes, aswel indeeds and workes, as in words. Thus doing, we shal haue witnesse that we are good, and shalbe assured of the good wil of God towards vs: hee wil make vs certaine that wee are acceptable vnto him, and that hee loueth vs, and that of his only grace and mercy. Wherefore, let vs know, that when Solomon saieth, A good man getteth, or shal get, hee speaketh after the maner of men, for to accommodate himselfe vnto our weaknes, and to shew vs that we shal not labour in vaine, if we giue ourselues vnto goodnesse: for the Lorde wil not refuse vs, nor forsake vs, but wil gather and drawe vs vnto himselfe, of his onely goodnes, without any thing of ours: yet must we not thinke it strange, though Solomon doeth attribute vnto man, that which is proper vnto God aloue. This is for to shewe vnto man that hee ought not to be slouthful, & without care: but that he should soli∣cite God to be fauourable vnto him. For as it is not without cause that the Scripture doeth exhort vs vnto good workes, and doeth cal them ours, (and notwithstanding it is saide, We are his workeman∣ship, Ephe. 2. 10. Phi. 2. 13. created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, which God hath or∣deined, that we should walke in them: For it is God which worketh in you, both the wil & the deed, euen of his good pleasure:) euen so also it is not without cause that Solomon promiseth that the good shal draw the fauour of the Lord, though it is the Lorde onely that draw vs vnto himself. No man can come vnto me, except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him. Again, No man cōmeth vnto the Fa∣ther, but by me. Therefore, when we heare that the Scripture doeth Ioh. 6. 44. Ioh. 14. 6. attribute vnto vs any goodnes or vertue, let vs take heed frō bosting ourselues therof, as thogh we had it of ourselues: but let vs acknow¦ledge that God reckoneth that ours, which he of his only goodnes & mercy worketh in vs. Therfore thogh that he alone doth draw vs by his fauor, let vs not think it strange, that Solomon saith, that the good doeth drawe the fauour of the Lorde. Touching the rest, let vs note, that we haue had the like promise here aboue in the 11. Chap∣ter,
He that seeketh good things, getteth fauour, &c. sauing that in that same he maketh mention of fauour generally, & hereof the fa∣uour of the Lord. Wherin we ought to bee aduertised that the fa∣uour of men is nothing but winde and smoke, except it proceede of the fauour of God, and that it be ioyned vnto the same, so that it be for the honour of God, and because that hee loueth vs, that men should beare vs fauour. And therefore let vs not haue our eye vnto the fauour of men, but let vs content ourselues that God fauoureth vs. We are also aduertised, that if we be good, we haue great neede of the fauour of the Lord: for most commonly they which do wel, are out of fauour with the world. Yet the Lord doth not suffer that they should be wholly cast off, and forsaken of men, but doeth raise vp some for to fauour them so much as is expedient for their salua∣tion. And in this sort, it is not properly men which fauour them, but God alone. And therfore, let vs confesse that Solomon saieth verie properly, That a good man doeth drawe vnto him the fauour of the Lorde: and let vs comfort ourselues in this vnfaithfull pro∣mise, knowing that if we be good, though al the world should ryse vp against vs, yet their enterprises shal nothing hurt vs, for God fa∣uoureth vs. And therefore let vs say, The Lorde is my light, and my Psal. 27. 1. Psal. 119. 6 saluation, whome then shal I feare? The Lorde is the strength of my life, of whome then shal I be afraide? The Lorde is on my side: I wil not feare what man doeth vnto mee. Against this promise, hee setteth a threatening for to feare the wicked, saying, But the man of wicked imaginations wil he condemne. Here Solomon setteth the man of wicked imaginations, against the good man: and so, though the word which he vseth, doeth in his tongue signifie the thoughts, whether they bee good or euil: yet by the Antithesis, hee sheweth that he speaketh of him whose cogitations and thoughtes, whose purpose and enterprises doe tende but to euil and hurt, the which hee signifieth also in condemning the man of wicked imaginations. For if his thoughtes were good, he should not bee condemned, but shoulde get fauour of the Lorde, whose office is not to condemne him which hath good cogitations, whereby hee tendeth to doe wel Psal. 72. 12 vnto his neighbours, but to iustifie and absolue him, when the wic∣ked doe condemne him. Hee shal deliuer the poore when he cry∣eth: the needie also and him that hath no helper. It is the manner
of the worlde to oppresse the good, and to iustifie and absolue, and to quit the wicked. For the worlde is so blinde, that it counteth the wicked imaginations for pollicie and finesse of wit; wisedome, and good counsel, for watchfulnes, and care. It is commonly saide of the wicked, that they are woorthie to liue, because they dispatche their affaires wel at the cost and hinderance of the poore. But such iusti∣fication shal not profite them before the Lorde, before whome wee Rom. 14. 10 2. Cor. 5. 10 Psal. 5. 4. must al appeare. Nowe hee knoweth them to be wicked, and ther∣fore he wil not be fauourable. For thou arte the God that hast no pleasure in wickednesse: neither shal any euil dwel with thee. But as God is righteous, so wil he condemne their desert. This con∣demnation shalbe declared in the last day, in the meane while, the Lord doth often dissipate the enterprises of the wicked, and so they come not to the end of their imaginations, but are frustrate: as ex∣perience hath taught, and doeth daily teach. 3 A man cannot be established by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous shal not be mooued. This present sentence may seeme to be a recital of the former. For it foloweth wel, (if God doe condemne man, which doeth imagine euil, and none can resist his iudgement,) that the wickednes of man shal not profite him for to keepe him stedfast in one estate, and to make him prosper as he desireth, and as him seemeth, because hee se∣eth himselfe vpholden with such as fauour him, that he hath credit, and aboundeth in temporal wealth: and as him seemeth, the poore doe tremble vnder him, because of the wrongs and oppressions that he committeth: but hee is farre of from his reckoning, as Solomon Psal. 9. 16. doth here pronounce: and also Dauid in his 9. Psalm, saying, The vn∣godly is trapped in the worke of his handes. Contrarily, albeit that the godly & righteous are sharpely tossed with diuers temptations, and that often it seemeth they are lost & destroyed, yet because they get the fauour of the Lord, it foloweth that they are so wel rooted, that their roote shal not remooue, but shal prosper for euer, though it seeme contrarie vnto the world. 4 A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but shee that maketh him ashamed, is a corruption in his bones.
Solomon doeth here shew vnto the woman what she ought to be amongst her housholde, and in her conuersation with her neigh∣bours, for to be ioyful vnto her husband, & an ornament & honour vnto him, and not to vexe nor grieue him. And therefore the wiues which loue their husbāds, & haue good desire to do their duety to∣wards them, ought diligently to hearken vnto this lesson, that they may vnderstād what they haue to do, or what to auoid for to shew their loue, and to put their good desire in execution. First of al, when Solomon saieth, A vertuous woman: hee doeth shewe vs that the wiues ought not to desire nor seeke the delights & pleasures, rest, & idlenes of the flesh, but to carrie the armour for to resist & fight a∣gainst the concupiscences of the flesh, by the which women are na∣turally drawne to become subiect vnto the former things: and so of themselues they shew thēselues to be weak & faint hearted: yet doe they not think so, but do think thēselues to be very valiāt whē they can get their desires, be they good or euil, & doe thinke to bee verie strōg, when by loud crying, by cursing & railing, by scratching & bi∣ting, or other like violēce, they withstād thē which do hinder thē to obtain their wil, & do as they would. Behold, what is force & pow∣er of the greatest part of women. But the strength that Solomon de∣mandeth of women, is spiritual, the which ought to be exercised by the holie Ghost, who doth teach & guide them to their duetie, ac∣cording as it is shewed them in the holy scriptures, wherin women haue faireglasses to looke in, what they ought to bee, & howe they ought to behaue themselues: as for example, Sara, Rebecca, Abigail, and others. They haue therin also exhortations, laws, & commande∣ments, to the end, that in folowing them, & doing their duetie, they should shew themselues vertuous & strōg. The places of Scriptures seruing therto, haue bene alledged. Nowe that this vertue or power ought to be exercised as hath bin said, Solomon doth shew it, when hee calleth A vertuous woman, the Crown of her husband. For as Pro. 11. 16. & 22. we cannot reioyce of a tree, neither glory nor boast of his goodnesse and excellenice, except it bring vs forth good fruit: euen so, if a wo∣man doeth not exercise her power, and shewe the same by honest and godly conuersation, she cannot be the crown of her husband. For he cannot reioyce nor glorie in the vertue of his wife, as of an excellent and honourable vessel, except that this vertue be shewed outwardly by godly exercise.
When we thus speake, we shew that Solomon doth heere take the crowne, for ioy, glory, honor & precious or namēt: after as crownes Iob 19. 9. Psal. 21. 5. & 65. 11. 12 & 103. 4. Esa. 23. 9. & 28. 1. 3. & 62. 3. Phil. 4. 1. 1. Thes. 2. 19 Iam. 1. 12. 1. Pet. 5. 4. Gen. 2. 18. & 3. 16. 1. Cor. 11. 7. Gen. 2. 18. 24 1. Cor. 7. 2. 34. & 11. 3 are vsed: and also the scripture vseth this woorde crowne in the like sence. And if we loke narrowly to what end the womā was created, we shal find that she ought to be to her husband, a ioyful, glorious, honorable and precious iewel. For the Lord saith, it is not good that man should be by himself alone: I wil make him an helper meete for him. Thy desire shalbe subiect to thine husband, and he shal rule o∣uer thee. And S. Paul saith that the woman is the glory of the man. When the scripture speaketh thus, it teacheth vs that if the woman wil folow the ordinance of God, shee shalbe an excellent ornament vnto her husband. For we must not doute but that God hath ordei∣ned the woman to be a great honor vnto man, for to be a fellowe & ayde vnto him, and that he hath made her subiect vnto man, as the rest of the body vnto the head. But besides this same, let vs note that Solomon saith not of her husbands, or of her neighbours. For as it is not lawful for man to haue many wiues, but one alone: euē so also the wife cannot haue diuers husbands, but one onely: as it may wel be gathered. Likewise as man ought not to ioyne himself to any but to his wife alone, in louing & cherishing her: euē so also the wife ought to content herself with pleasing of her husband, and bee subiect vnto him. Now after that he hath shewed that by the exer∣cise of vertue, the woman ought to reioyce & honor her husbande, Eph. 5. 22. he sheweth by the contrary, that she doth grieue, trouble, & disho∣nor him, when he saith, But shee that maketh him ashamed, &c. The corruption of the bones bringeth great hurt vnto the body, & maketh it disformed, & so the person is vexed & troubled, & cānot rightly do his office. Againe, the wife that despiseth vertue & the ex∣ercise therof, & is giuen to be foolish, & to play the wanton, intem∣perate, arrogant, & rebellious, slouthful & negligent, in this sort she is a shame vnto her husbande, she greatly vexeth & troubleth him, in such wise that he cannot set such order in his house as behoueth, & for this cause his affaires haue euil successe, wherby he is brought vnder foote and to confusion. And in this maner the wicked wife is the destruction of her husbande, where as shee ought to serue him for an helper and succour, according as she is ordeined of God. She is not then only rebellious against men, but also against God: wher∣of
foloweth, that she herselfe must also goe into corruption, and re∣maine in eternal damnation. 5 The thoughts of the iust are right: but the counsels of the wicked, are deceitful. It is not enough that we thinke to do wel vnto our neighbours, and to haue no desire to hurt them: it sufficeth not to thinke to doe right vnto our neighbours, & not to do them any iniury or violēce: but eue rie one ought to be so affectioned, that he should looke how he could deliuer the miserable and afflicted from the wrongs & op∣pressions that the wicked do labour to worke them: otherwise wee cannot boast to be ought worth. For as Solomon heere saieth, The thoughts of the iust are right. Good people do seeke out al the ho∣nest and fit meanes to saue & deliuer the miserable frō the violence and wrong of the wicked. Euerie one of vs ought to labour for it, and chiefly the Magistrates, to whom the word is directed, It doeth Psal. 82. 2. Iere. 22. 3 Rom. 13. 4. 2. Pet. 2. 14 belong vnto them so to doe, for they beare the sword. Priuate per∣sons haue not authoritie to represse iniuries and wronges by the sword: albeit that it is the duetie of euerie one of vs for to help our neighbours, and to deliuer them from the oppression of the wicked. When S. Peter stept foorth to strike with the sword, he was reproo∣ued. We should then looke to minister help vnto our neighbors, but Mat. 26. 51. 52. yet without swoord: except the same be committed vnto vs, by the Magistrate, & that we are expresly charged to vse it. Otherwise, we must haue as it were our hands bound, but not our mouthes stopt. It should serue to giue exhortation, to preach and to threaten, for to turne away iniuries & wrongs. This perteineth vnto al Christians, and aboue al, vnto the Ministers of the word, which should be folo∣wers of the Prophetes & Apostles. Contrarily, it is not enough for the wicked to despise their neighbours, & not to thinke to do them any good: but their heartes are so poisoned with malice, that they cease not to consult and determine, to looke and to deuise all the meanes they can to hurt their neighbours, & to destroy them: and chiefly they which take not heede. Solomon doeth wel signifie this same, when he saith, But the counsels of the wicked, are deceitful. Wee may point out two reasons, for the which the euil which they think, is called deceitful. First of al, because they set trappes to catche them which take no heed of them, or which cannot perceiue them.
Secondly, because they are counterfait & disguised, they faine them¦selues honest & good men, hiding their malice so much as they can: and also they make themselues to beleeue that God doeth not see them, conspiring & inuenting so secretly as they can. Solomon doeth giue vs this same to vnderstand briefly, by the deceitful counsels, & by the Psalme, His mouth is ful of cursing, deceit, and fraude: vnder his tongue is vngodlines & vanitie. Hide me from the gathering to∣gether Psal. 10. 7. & 64. 2. 3. & 94. 3. 8. of the froward: and from the insurrection of wicked doers. Lord how long shal the vngodly: howe long shal the vngodly try∣umph? Thus thinking and saying, they deceiue themselues: and do wel shewe that they are beastes: and therefore, they are sharply re∣prooued. O ye fooles, whē wil you vnderstand? And wo vnto them Esai. 29. 15 that seeke deepe to hide their counsel from the Lord. 6 The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them. The maner and custome of the greatest part of the wicked, is that they would be esteemed for honest and good men, & do boast ther∣of with open mouth. Wherfore let vs not think that Solomon mea∣neth, that the wicked do openly say, let vs laye waite for blood: but they haue this malicious craft, to beare false witnesse against theyr neighbours, to laye false crimes to their charge, & to interpret their workes and their words to euil, to the end that they may haue some cloke, and to seeme that they proceede as honest & good men, whē they labour to bring to ruine and destruction the innocents, the poore & weak which do not take heede of their malice, or haue not power to saue themselues from their violence. The world is so filled with such wicked men, that rightly wee may complaine, The good Mich. 7. 2. man is perished out of the earth. The Prophets, our lord Iesus Christ and his Apostles, haue bene handeled after this sort. And blessed are Mat. 9. 10. they which suffer with them. But what prosperitie soeuer there is in the patience that we haue in trouble, and though we must reioyce therein, yet it is not to say, but that we should haue cōpassion of thē which suffer, & to think how to deliuer thē, & to procure the same: and if wee can not better, and restore it at the leastwise, that wee should labor by prayers, exhortations, & threatenings, if it be need∣ful: otherwise, we are faint, & haue not a right heart, Solomon doth shew vs this same, when hee saith, But the mouth of the righteous
wil deliuer, for whose blood they laye waite. Nowe as such wicked men doe worke the ouerthrow of others, so also shal they be ouer∣throwne themselues: and contrarily, the iust which labour to saue their neighbours, shalbe deliuered, as foloweth. 7 God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the house of the righteous shal stand. The wicked are like vnto an house builded without foundation: Mat. 7. 26. And therefore let the good comfort themselues. 8 A man shalbe commended for his wisedome: but the fro∣ward of heart shalbe despised. There is none of vs that would gladly suffer himself to be despi∣sed, nor to be euil spoken of, but doe al desire to be esteemed, & to be wel and honestly spoken of. Wherfore we must be very attentiue vnto the doctrine that Solomon doth presently giue vs: for he doth shew vs the way for to attaine vnto that which we desire, touching our reputation and good name. This is the wisedome wherewithall if we be endewed, hee doeth promise vs commendation. Wee must therefore be giuen vnto wisedome, and we shalbe had in good repu∣tation, and shalbe praysed and commended. But to the ende that we may not be deceiued, let vs know, that there hath been and are in the world many honest men and wel learned, after the outward ap∣parance, and in the feeling of the fleshe, the which haue bene, & are wel counted of, and praised of them which are led with a carnal and worldly affection: but as such wisdom is condemned of God, euen so, that reputation vanisheth away verie quickly, as al men do proue by experience, sauing those which knowe not what wisdom is. Solo∣mon speaketh not here of such wisdom, but of that which is ioyned together with vpright heart, wherby we labour to profit our neigh∣bours, & to do hurt to no man. He doth shewe it, when he setteth a froward hart against wisdom, saying, But the froward of heart shalbe despised. At the first sight it seemeth vnto the faithful poore afflic∣ted, beeing weake & ful of infirmities, that the contrary of this sen∣tence is true. For we see that as the wicked do please & praise them∣selues: so also they haue a great number of flatterers to applaud and to commende them. And as the faithful doe walke in humilitie, and
esteme not of thēselues: euen so also the world doth contemne thē. This same hath bin tryed & is prooued dayly. Notwithstanding the same letteth not this sentence to be true: for Solomon doeth not speake of that which is done in the world amongst the wicked, but of that which ought to be done, shewing vs, what God doth allow, & disallowe: and what the children of God ought to praise, and what they ought to contemne and abhorre. Let vs then vnderstande that Solomon promiseth vnto them which haue true wisdom, that they shalbe esteemed before God, who also wil cause them to bee esteemed and reuerenced of men so farre as he shal know to bee ne∣cessary for them: and therewith also hee declareth vnto vs what is our duetie towardes them, to the end that we should not folow the foolishnes and malice of the world, which doeth mocke and perse∣cute the wise and prudent, but that wee should haue them in admi∣ration, speaking wel of them, and giuing them honor & reuerence, in being at their commandement, & obeying their admonitions, in∣structions, and exhortations: and in trembling at their reprehensi∣ons and threatnings: as we honour the wise magistrates, godly Mi∣nisters, our fathers and mothers. Contrarily, let vs knowe, that hee threateneth the foolish and wicked which are so much peruerted & ouercome, that they giue themselues to nothing but to vanitie and foolishnesse, vnto vngodlinesse and filthinesse: let vs knowe I say, that hee threateneth such people denouncing vnto them that God wil despise them, with a horrible and fearful contempt. Let vs know also that they are wel worthy to be contemned before men, & that they which know them to be such, should abhorre them, & esteme them not only as filth and doung, but also as poyson and deadly pe∣stilence, euen verily to hate them, and to pray for their destruction, yet without being led with any carnal affection, which should draw vs to seeke our particular profit, and to reuenge ourselues vpon thē which should hinder the same: but that onely we shoulde haue be∣fore our eyes the honour and glory of God, and the rest and peace of his. Then may we say, Stand vp, o Lord, in thy wrath, and lift vp thy selfe. &c. Let God arise, & let his enemies be scattered. &c. Psal. 7. 6. Psal. 68. 1. Psal. 139. 19 Wilt thou not slay the wicked O God? &c. Moreouer let vs note, first of al forasmuch as al wisdome commeth of God, and that none is indued therewith but by his grace and goodnesse, and that for the
same we are esteemed of by our neighbours, and that they com∣mende and praise vs for it, let vs take good heed from being deligh∣ted with ourselues, and to bee drunken with such praises, thinking that they are due vnto vs of right: but walking with humblenes, let vs say, Not vnto vs, O Lorde, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name giue the praise, &c. If we do contrarily, we deserue to heare, What hast Psalm. 115. 1 1. Cor. 4. 7. thou, which thou hast not receiued. 9 He that is despised, and is his owne seruant, is better then he that boasteth himself & lacketh bread. We all naturally are set to glory and boasting, & do loue rest, and are glad that others shoulde labour for vs, and serue vs: for this cause wee thinke it very strange that Solomon shoulde heere com∣mend basenes and seruice. But seeing we loue not to want victuals, and doe feare to starue for hunger, so that for bread wee will applie ourselues to the vilest office that can be thought of, rather then wee wil die for hunger, let vs not therefore finde it strange though So∣lomon doth commend the man that is despised, and doeth apply his worke for to serue and helpe himselfe, and to earne his bread in the sweate of his face. He doth not simply and absolutely commend the basenes and seruice, but by comparison. For in that that man is con∣strained to become slaue and bounde, commeth of sinne. And thus abiection and seruice are after a sort the reward for sinne, which we Gen. 3. 17. were better to suffer, then to runne into further danger & trouble, that is to say, to starue for hunger. There is none of vs but if neces∣sitie pricke him, that wil not rather choose to humble himselfe and to giue himselfe to worke, then to suffer himselfe to die for hunger, by contemning labour and worke. And suche an election is agreeable vnto the ordinance of God, when we are set to worke in good con∣science. Man in the beginning was in a noble and excellent state, as wee may wel vnderstand when it is saide, That God did create him vnto his image and likenesse: and when it is saide, they both were naked, &c. But sinne did otherwayes change their estate. The . 1. 27 &. 2. 24 Eccle. 7. 31 Ecclesiastes doth wel signifie the same, saying, That God hath made man righteous: but they haue sought many inuentions And thus from the beginning we haue experimēted, that he which exalteth
himself, shalbe brought lowe. Now albeit that humilitie & bondage are paines due for sinne, yet seeing they are of smal continuance, & that the Lorde woulde haue vs to beare them for to mortifie our flesh (the which otherwise woulde runne into al filthinesse and vn∣cleannesse, into al insolencie and dissolutenes) we must not abhorre them, neither to be grieued to be despised, to be vile and abiect, and to abase ourselues to doo the woorkes of seruantes, and chiefly when they are fit and meete to prouide for the necessities of vs and our housholde, and needie brethren: but wee must reioyce therein, knowing that in such estate we are not vnprofitable vnto our neigh∣bours and also that wee ourselues therby reape profite. Solomon doth signifie it, by this worde, and is his owne seruant. He meaneth not by this worde to teache vs to be niggardes, to loue ourselues, to make our particular profite, without hauing care of our neigh∣bours. If he spake after the manner of the worlde; and carnal men, which wil say, giue vs more of your purse, and lesse of your courte∣sie: and wil forget al glorie, pompe and magnificence for to labour least we should dye for hunger, there might be inferred vppon his saying, that it were ynough for vs to meddle with our own busines, and not to care for our neighbours: seing that after the world, man is seruant to himselfe, who doth his workes without thinking that his neighbours do belong to him, or that hee is bounde vnto them. And such a woorthy man is preferred before him which boasteth himselfe, and by glory wil not esteeme to set his hand to worke, and in the meane while shalbe ready to starue. They which are most gi∣uen to the flesh, and to the world, haue taken such an opinion, and doe also seeme at the first sight that Solomon doth folow it: but So∣lomon being instructed by the spirit of God, hath vttered this sen∣tence by the same spirit, by whome wee al are one body in Iesus Christ, and euery one, one anothers members. Let vs learne that Solomon calleth man a seruant for himselfe, or his owne seruant, Rom. 12. 4. 1. Cor. 12. 12. Ephe. 4. 4. the which doth folow his vocation, & therin doth labour for to o∣bey God, by louing of his neighbor as himself. Wherupon it folow∣eth that he setteth himselfe to woorke looking to profite his neigh∣bours and labouring to succour them when neede requireth: other∣wise there is no loue in him. Whosoeuer hath this worlds good, and
seeth his hath need, and shutteth his cōpassion frō him, how dwel∣leth the loue of God in him? But wee must marke the next exhorta∣tiō: 1. Iohn. 3. 17. & 18. My little childrē, let vs not loue in word, neither in tongue, but indeede,, and in trueth. A man thus doing, is his owne seruant, and is better then him that glorieth, and yet hath nothing to susteine himselfe, much lesse to helpe his neighbours. When Solomon saith is better, he meaneth not that the needie boaster, and vaine glo∣rious is good, seeing he is neither profitable to himselfe, nor to his neighbours, but hurtful. For to liue, he must vse either craft and sub∣tiltie, or force and violence, or els other vnlawful meanes, as to bo∣rowe without willing to pay againe, or els to sel that which is not his. Such a personage is no better then a theefe, or a robber, in whō there is no goodnesse, but al hurt and hinderance. Therefore when Solomon saith, Better, he denieth that the glorious wanter is good, that he might on the contrary part affirme the goodnesse of him which is despised, and yet he serueth himself so wel, that he wanteth nothing, and laboureth to helpe his poore members to get to sustein themselues. Besides this he willeth vs not to be greeued, though we be despised of the worlde, but that we shoulde conceiue so humbly of ourselues, that we might rightly say, Lord, mine hart is not hauty, neither are mine eyes loftie. Our Lorde Iesus Christ hath not dis∣dained to bee counted an artificer or handicraftes man. Hee disdai∣ned not to take vpon him the fourme a seruant: and therefore S. Psa. 131. 1. Mar. 6. 3. Phi. 2. 5. Paule exhorteth vs, saying, Let the same minde be in you, that was euen in Christe Iesus. &c. Furthermore let vs knowe that Solo∣mon prayseth and commendeth labour and trauell, and sheweth vs that wee ought not to boast ourselues of any goodnesse, when wee doe not apply ourselues to doe our office: for then wee are vnpro∣fitable, and are not worthie of the bread that wee eate. For euen when we were with you, this wee warned you of, that if there were 2. Thes. 3. 10. any, which woulde not worke, that he shoulde not eate. To con∣clude, let vs knowe that Solomon doeth teache vs, that euery one shoulde content himselfe with his owne vocation and state, & ther∣in to labour according as hee knoweth the wil of God to bee: and that none shoulde brag, nor presume to support many charges, and to occupie diuers offices. For as the Prouerbe saith, who so gri∣peth too muche, doeth holde so muche the worse: that is, hee that
woulde al haue, shal al forgoe. They which are contented to holde their estate, are willingly contented with sufficiencie, and aswel for themselues as to helpe the necessitie of their neighbours. Contrari∣ly, they which are vaine boasters, presuming to bee sufficient to go∣uerne many affaires, and doe fall into suche necessitie that they haue nothing whereon to eate, except they borrow it, or stealeit, so much it wanteth that they haue wherewith to satisfie them which labour for them, or to them, to whome rhey stande bounde. The doctrine of Paule is not contrary to this same, when hee saith, Let him that stole, steale no more. &c. This doctrine seemeth very plaine, but it is not easie to doe, that wee can attaine therevnto without bri∣deling Ephe. 4. 28 our corrupt nature, considering the inclination thereof. 10 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: bu the mercies of the wicked are cruell. For to shewe howe the poore despised man, and hee that is his owne seruant is better, he doeth attribute vnto him righteous∣nesse: and that because so much it wanteth that he is not negligent in doing his duety towardes men, that he doth not neglect nor con∣temne his beast which serueth him to labour with al, but doeth ad∣minister vnto him that which is necessary: he sheweth this same, when hee doeth say, A righteous man regardeth. &c. And heerein hee hath respect to the lawe which saith, Thou shalt not muzzle, &c. Saint Paule doeth alledge this law for to shew that the ministers of the worde ought to bee rewarded for their labour, and Deut. 25. 4. 1. Cor. 9. 9. that they shoulde haue distributed vnto them that which is neces∣sary for them to liue and to doe their office. And albeit there is not so little a birde whereof God taketh no care: yet notwith∣stāding for to declare that by his law, god hath had more regard vn∣to men, for whome al thinges are created, then to oxen, Saint Paule denieth that god taketh care for oxē: not that he wold exclude ox∣en from the prouidence of God, without the which nothing can re∣maine in this worlde: but hee meaneth that this lawe was not gi∣uen for the cause of oxen, but to the ende that we shoulde vn∣derstande howe great care we shoulde haue ouer our neighbours, when God commandeth vs expresly to take care of oxen. Nowe
also when Solomon speaketh, that the righteous man regardeth the life of his beast, let vs not thinke that hee doeth attribute righteousnesse vnto a man for taking care of his beast, neither that hee woulde that the man shoulde be counted iust because he regar∣deth to nourishe his horses, or oxen which labour: but hee reaso∣neth from the lesse to the greater, as if he said, If the righteous doth take paine to prouide for his beast, and to doe al the good hee can to him, or is necessary for him: by a stronger reason hee will bee mo∣ued, to shewe gentlenesse towardes his neighbours, and wil accu∣stome himselfe too vse vpright dealing, to the end thereby that hee may doe his duetie to them, and not to defraude them. And so do∣ing, hee shal shewe that hee isled with a gentle and louing, good and righteous affection, and that hee hath no desire to hurte, but that he intendeth to profite his neighbours. By suche exercises hee shal not be righteous: but because he is righteous, he wil apply him¦selfe vnto them, and wil shew himselfe righteous to the edification of his neighbours, as the good fruite maketh not the good tree, but because the tree is good, hee bringeth foorth good fruite, and there∣by declareth his goodnesse. Solomon then doth not here exalt our works to make vs to boast of thē, but he prouoketh vs to do so well that our neighbours shoulde feele and perceiue vs to bee softe and gentle, and not to contemne them, to deale euil with them, to hurte them, and hinder them, as doe the wicked: euen as Solomon doeth signifie, when hee saith, But the mercies of the wicked are cruell, He iudgeth the affections which are inward and hid, the which are knowne to God onely. The hearte is deceitful and wicked aboue all Iere. 17. 9. things, who can knowe it? I the Lorde search the heart, and try the reines. Againe, God seeth not as man seeth: for man looketh on &. 10. the outwarde apparance, but the Lorde beholdeth the heart. Yet neuerthelesse hee medleth not with the office of God, but when hee seeth that the wicked doe abounde in euil fruites of wicked works, that they exercise cruelties in borrowing and not paying againe, seeing that such vngentlenes cannot proceed but of cruel affection, 1. Sam. 16. 7 by such exercises Solomon doeth iudge rightly of the inward parts, though hee doeth not beholde them with his eies. For the tree is knowne by his fruite. And in pronouncing of that which is
within, hee sheweth what their outwarde conuersation is, that is to say, infamous, wicked and cruel. For an euill tree cannot bring Mat. 7. 16. &. 12. 33 foorth good fruite. And because, that none would bee counted cru∣ell, therefore, it is needeful, first of al that wee refourme the inward parte: as the Lorde doeth shewe vnto vs, when hee reiecteth al the outwarde holynesse, for the crueltie which hee expresseth, say∣ing, For your handes are ful of blood. And afterwardes when hee exhorteth, washe yee then, &c. Yee make cleane the outside of Esay. 1. 11. 15. 16. Mat. 23. 25. &. 26. Ezec. 36. 25 the Cuppe, and of the Platter: but within they are ful of bribery & excesse. But it is not in your power thus to doe: it is the worke of the Lord. Then will I powre cleane water vpon you, and yee shalbe cleane: yea from al your filthinesse, &c. Wherefore wee must pray vnto God, and say, Purge mee with hysope, and I shalbe cleane: washe mee, and I shalbe whiter then snowe. The Pope with his shauelinges hath neede thus to pray. For if there bee any people in the worlde which beare any cruel affection, they haue it, seeing that Psal. 51. 7. they do not only spoyle mens goods for to enrich themselues, but also so much as in them lieth, steale soules from God, to giue them to the diuell. They are of the number of them whom Ezechiel spea∣keth, Woe vnto the shepheardes of Israel, that feede themselues: shoulde not the shephearde feede the flockes? For this cause wee Ezech. 34. 2 are admonished to beware of them. They which next succeede the false doctours in cruell affections, are they which vnder colour of ministring iustice, do iudge through parciality, hauing regarde too persons, taking bribes, and not giuing the right vnto him that it be∣longeth Esay. 1. 23. vnto. Thy Princes are rebellious, and companions of theeues. &c. 11 Hee that tilleth his land, shalbe satisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is destitute of vnderstanding. For to giue courage vnto the man which is seruant for himself, and his owne man, hee maketh vs a promise, the accomplishement whereof is very needeful for vs, yea necessary to mainteine vs in this life, he promiseth Satisfiyng with bread: that is to say, that the mā which shalbe diligēt & careful to do his office, to folow his estate and vocation, shal want nothing that is necessary for to liue in this
worlde, but shal haue enough and contentation. For by bread are signified al thinges necessary for to vpholde this life: and by satis∣fiyng is ment contentation. Now hee that is contented with things necessary, is rich enough. Albeit thē that Solomō doth not name but bread only, yet doth hee not promise any smal thing, as might seeme at the first sight: but doeth promise riches, as afore in the 10. Chapter and 4. verse. And sith that these riches are necessary, and that he doth not promise thē but vnto the labourer, it followeth that hee exhorteth vs vnto la∣bour, and doth shewe vs that it is necessary for vs to labour. And albeit that of our nature wee are not so much giuen to do pleasure and seruice vnto our neighbours, as that wee wil leaue our owne worke to doe theirs: and also are not so diligent nor so earnest in taking of paine that wee shoulde take other mens worke in hande with our owne: yet notwithstanding because there are many curi∣ous and vndiscrete, which forsaking their office, woulde gladly take both the office and worke of others in hande, Solomon would not omit to teach vs, that we should keep ourselues within our limits: And therefore he hath not saide simply, That whosoeuer doeth tyll the earth, but hee that tilleth his lande. Let vs therefore learne not to take in hande that which doeth not belong vnto vs, other∣wise wee shoulde not be compelled to leaue our vocation: for wee are not able to deale in diuers estates, neither haue shoulders strong enough for to beare many burdens. Wee are like vnto a body whose members haue diuers operations and offices, and where eue∣ry member doth his owne office without intermedling in the office of the other: and in this sort there is no confusion of disorder in the body, but the members are careful & help one another. S. Paul doth teach vs such similitudes, for to shewe vs that none ought to thinke Rom. 12. 4. 1. Cor. 12. 12 and esteeme of himselfe more then behoueth, that euery one ought to imploy himselfe after the measure of the grace that he hath recei∣ued, and that euery one vse his estate, so as hee shoulde also care for his neighbour. But because hee speaketh but of the tilling of the lande, it might seeme that the promise to be filled with bread, doth not belong but onely vnto them which tyll the lande, which do plant the vines, which doe sow and reape, and which are occupied about the lande: but let vs knowe that al they which busie themselues
in any woorke that is meete and agreeable vnto their vocation which is allowed of God, are woorthy to bee satisfied with bread. And therefore, albeit Solomon doeth not speake but of the tilling of the lande, yet doeth hee not exclude other vocations which are not forbidden of God, but vnder one kinde, hee comprehendeth all occupations and woorkes, and al estates which God hath ordeined for men to bee occupied, that they shoulde not eate their bread for nought, in slouthfulnesse and ydlenesse. If any man demande Gen. 2. 15. & 3. 17. why Solomon hath rather named the tilling of the earth, then any other estate: there may be twoo reasons assigned for the same. The first is, that the tilling of the lande was first ordeined. The seconde is, that thereby the earth doeth bring foorth vnto vs that which is most necessary for the maintenance of this present life: that is to say, bread, by the meanes whereof wee obteine al other necessaries & corporal profits. Wee may wel vnderstand it when Christ tea∣ching Mat. 6. 12 vs to aske that which is needful for this life, doeth not make mention but of bread. Moreouer let vs note, that sithens Solomon doth promise that we shalbe satisfied with bread, that it is lawful for vs to desire riches, but only such as are necessary. It is not lawful for vs to desire a great superfluous abundāce, but we should contēt our¦selues with a smal thing, as Solomō doth signifie it, though he doth promise vs but bread. Not so but that God doeth giue vs al other meates the which we may vse with thanks giuing: but we must not be curious of them, as are the gluttons and dainty mouthed which care only for their mouths & bellies, & care no whit for their neigh∣bours. Albeeit such maner of people haue plently of bread yet are they not filled: for they are neuer satisfied. After this promise hee addeth a threatning to the contrarie, the which hee expresseth by a reproofe, saying, but hee that foloweth the ydle, is destitute of vn∣derstanding. For to expresse and to describe the man which wil not labour, he saith that he is slouthful, that is to say, that hee laboureth to be like vnto them, and heerein he closely doth chide and threaten them: as before in the 16. chap. & 6. verse, &c. And to finishe the re∣proofe, he saith he is destitute of vnderstanding, & by such repre∣hension which is commō in the world against the slouthful, he she∣weth that he that foloweth them, is wel woorthy to dye for hun∣ger: for sith he is voide of vnderstanding, his outward members, as
armes and legges doe feele therof, whereof doth folow pouertie. A slouthful hand maketh poore, &c. And if man for want of labou∣ring Pro. 10. 4. to get his corporal bread, deserueth to bee called destitute of vnderstanding: by a more strong reason, hee which hath no care of the health of his soule, hath a very faint hart. 12 The wicked desireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite. The hunter or the fouler that desireth to make his profit in hun∣ting or fouling, doeth not onely set and lay to take one beast or one foule, but many: and to obtaine his desire, hee prepareth his lawnes toyles and nettes, and doeth place them as hee knoweth they will serue him best to make greatest spoyle of beastes: for he doeth not hunt after them for to nourish and keepe them aliue, but to kil and eae them, and to satisfie his desire: euen so the wicked is not con∣tented to commit one euil, but doeth inuent many, and against ma∣ny persons, and chiefly against the weake and feeble, against the simple and innocent, which want power or wisedom to resist the wicked, as doe the beastes that the huntsman or fouler pursueth. And to come to the ende of his deuises and enterprises, hee vseth diuers artes, according as they are fit to bring him his desire, and come to the ende of his enterprise: one while hee proceedeth by craft and subtiltie, another time by force and violence, some∣times by cruel woordes, as by rebukes, false witnesse bearing and threateninges. Solomon doth signifie the same in fewe woordes, when hee saieth, The wicked desireth, &c. And as it is more amplie described in the Psalmes: Saule against Dauid, Absalon a∣gainst Psal. 10. 7. & 50. 16. his Father Dauid: Iudas with the Scribes and Pharisees a∣gainst Iesus Christ haue wel shewed that they did desire a multitude of euils. The Pope and his souldiours, tyrantes and enemies of truthe doe wel shewe that they desire a multitude of euils against the children of God. Wee feele that other wicked men also, as iudges and vngodly counsellers, murtherers, theeues, vsurers, co∣uetous,
whoremōgers and adulterers do wish a net of euils. For al these haue bent themselues theretoo, & doe dayly. Whereuppon it commeth that the Psalmist prayeth and often complaineth, Drawe Psal. 31. 4. Psal. 35. 4. & 142. 1. 2.  mee out of the net that they haue layde priuily for mee. A∣gaine, Let them bee confounded and put to shame that seeke af∣ter my soule, &c. Againe, I cryed vnto the Lorde with my voyce: with my voyce I prayed vnto the Lorde. I powred out my meditation before him and declared my affliction in his presence. Though my spirit was in perplexitie in mee, yet thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I walked, haue they priuily layde a snare for mee. But as it is commonly saide, that hunters doe often loose their pathes: euen so also the Lorde bringeth to nought the away∣tinges, enterprises, and ymaginations that the wicked woorke a∣gainst the faithful: as Ioseph, Moyses, Dauid, Ezekias, the Pro∣phetes, our Lorde Iesus Christ and his Apostles, and as the true faithful doe also feele at this day. For after that GOD hath exercised and tryed them a certaine time through the pursute of these wicked hunters and huntsmen, in the ende at most neede he doth deliuer them, and perceyuing and knowing themselues to bee deliuered, they say, Who so dwelleth in the se∣crete Psal. 91. 1. of the most high, shall abyde in the shadowe of the Al∣mightie. Againe, Praysed bee the Lorde, which hath not gi∣uen Psal. 124. 6. & 7. vs as a praye vnto their teeth. Our soule is escaped, euen as a byrd out of the snare of the foulers: the snare is bro∣ken and wee are deliuered. But when these wicked huntsmen are sent of GOD for to followe after the vngodly, to destroy them, then they loose not the way. As the Prophete Ieremy saieth, Beholde saith the Lorde, I wil sende out many fishers, and they Iere. 16. 16. shall fishe them, and after, wil I sende out many hunters, and they shal hunt them from euery mountaine and from euery hill, and out of the caues of the rockes. Nowe as Solomon hath compared the wicked vnto the huntsman which pitcheth and set∣teth a long net: euen so contrarily hee compareth the righteous, that is to say, those which haue no desire to hurte, but ra∣ther would profit their neighbours, hee doeth liken them, I say,
vnto a tree which is strongly planted and soundly rooted: as also they are in other places likened theretoo. Solomon making the like Psa. 1. 3. Ier. 17. 8. comparison, saith, But the roote of the righteous giueth frute. As hee hath attri∣buted vnprofitablenesse, hurte, hinderance and destruction vnto the wicked, whereupon commeth their damnation: euen so con∣trarily, hee attributeth frutefulnesse or profite vnto the righteous: Psal. 7. 15. & 9. 16. Pro. 2. 21. & 3. 2. whereupon it doeth folowe that they shal continue, as hath beene treated vpon. The frutefulnesse that the righteous doe bring foorth, commeth from within, as Solomon doeth signifie, when hee attri∣buteth fruite to come from the roote. Let vs then learne that all our inwarde partes must bee sounde and good, if we wil bring forth Mat. 12. 35. any excellent frute. Solomon calleth the inward partes of man A roote, and that very aptly for first of al, as the roote of the tree ly∣eth hidde in the earth: euen so can we not see the affections and de∣sires of man. For what is hee that knoweth the things of men? Se∣condly, as by the frute wee come to knowe what the roote of the tree is: euen so a man by his woordes and woorkes doeth reueale Mat. 7. 16. & 20. what hee is within. Thirdly, as the tree without the roote cannot spring nor bring foorth frute: euen so man cannot bee occupied to profit his neighbours, but so farre as his wil and affection do leade and guide him. Nowe that the roote doeth signifie the inwarde parte, wee may vnderstande it, when Solomon doth place it against desires. Not hee alone doeth vse it in this signification, but Moy∣ses Deu. 29. 18. Heb. 12. 15. Rom. 11. 16. 1. Cor. 3. 6. also, And the Apostle to the Hebrewes. Saint Paule also doeth shewe the same speaking of them that are entred by the Gospel, when he speaketh, he hath planted, and Apollo watered, &c. 13 The euil man is snared by the wickednesse of his lippes: but the iust shal come out of aduersitie. They that are malicious and wicked, may bee encombred in many and diuers sortes by the fault of their lippes. For first of all GOD doeth blinde them and giue them ouer vnto a reprobate mynde, in such wise that they rather beleeue the lyes
of false Prophetes and Doctours, then the trueth: they giue more credite vnto false witnesses, then to the simple and plaine affirma∣tion of the innocent and trustie: and wil rather choose of set ma∣lice false witnesses, then they wil bee put by from oppressing and spoyling the innocent. Such people doe wel deserue to bee sna∣red, to or be destroied: for they goe precisely against the cōmande∣ment Exod. 23. 1. 2 and ordinances of GOD. And as they deserue to bee sna∣red, so shal they bee. Vnto them that are contentious and diso∣bey the trueth, and obey vnrighteousnesse, shalbee indignation and wrath▪ God shal sende them strong delusion, that they shoulde Rom. 2. 8. 2. Thes. 2. 11 12. beleeue lyes, That al they might bee damned which beleeued not the trueth, but had pleasure in vnrighteousnesse. The chil∣dren of Israel were snared by the sinne of their lippes, when they woulde not obey the holy Prophetes, but suffered them∣selues to be deceiued by the false Prophetes. The Turkes and Pa∣pistes lye in the same misery and destruction. Secondarily, as they rayle and abuse their neighbours by iniurious woordes and that their mouthes are filled with craft and treason to woorke the de∣struction of their neighbours: euen so againe shal destruction fal vpon them: Thou shalt destroy al them that speake leasing, &c. A∣gaine, Psal. 5. 6. 9. For no constancie is in their mouthes: within, they are very corruption; their throte is an open sepulchre, and they flatter with their tongue. The worlde is stuffed with such euil tongues, and therefore Dauid complaineth, Helpe Lorde for there is not a godly man left: for the faythful are fayled from among the children of men. They speake deceitfully euery one with his neighbour, flat∣tering Psal. 12. 1. 2 with their lippes, and speake with a double hart, Thirdly, when the wicked are apprehended by iustice, oftentimes GOD suffereth that they hurte and wounde themselues by their owne answeres, when they are examined: & are so founde guiltie: wher∣vpon foloweth the gallowes, wheretoo they condemne themselues by their owne mouth: and so are snared through faulte of their owne lippes: or otherwise beeing examined, if they persist in their lying, not confessing their fautes, they fal more deepely into the Deuils snares: and so are intangled by the faulte of their lippes. To bee short, if the wicked followe their corrupt nature with obsti∣nacie
without returning to repentance, there can bee nothing but sinne in their lippes. For it is saide, Generation of vipers, howe can you speake good thinges, when ye are euil? For from the Mat. 12. 34. & 36. aboundance of the hearte the mouth speaketh. And there∣fore they must needes bee snared in their woordes. For in the same former place it is saide againe: But I say vnto you that of e∣uery ydle woorde that men shal speake, they shal giue account ther∣of at the day of iudgement. And as they haue wicked lippes, so do they ioyne themselues to their like, as to false Doctors, vnto ly∣ers and seducers, and which haue nothing but vanitie and wic∣kednesse in their mouthes. After this sorte they become in∣tangled and are snared. But to the ende that wee may forsake their companie, let vs folowe the counsel of Saint Paule. And forasmuch as it is a singular benefite of GOD to bee preserued Rom. 16. 17. Col. 2. 6. Ephe. 4. 17. & 5. 6. from the deceit and counterfaite speache, fained and false, and not to consent vnto heresies and wicked doctrines, and also not to bee stained with any of them, wee haue neede to pray vnto GOD after this sort, Deliuer my soule, O Lorde, from lying lippes, and Psal. 120. 2. Psal. 140. 1. 2. 3. from a deceitful tongue. Againe, Deliuer mee, O Lorde, from the euil man: preserue mee from the cruel man, which ymagine euil thinges in their heart, and make warre continually. They haue sharpened tongues like a serpent, adders poyson is vnder their lippes. But albeeit that the wicked may bee snared in al these foresaide manners, yet the meaning most meete for this place, is that the wicked cannot beware nor take heede from bee∣ing ouerthrowne and destroied by faire and flattering speaches, by lyes and false witnesses, by slaunderinges and false reportes, by false doctrines and traditions of men. For as hee ymagi∣neth nothing but euil and destruction, and applyeth his mouth, yea all his members, to hurte and anoy his neighbours, he right∣ly deserueth to haue the like happen vnto him. This same may bee vnderstoode when against the euil man, hee setteth the iust: and against to bee snared, hee setteth to come out of aduersitie, saying, But the iust shall come out of aduersitie. He calleth him righ∣teous heere, which doeth not ymagine nor say any thing that may
hurte or anoy his neighbours. Hee doeth not promise him that hee shalbee without aduersitie (for experience teacheth the contra∣rie: Greate are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lorde deli∣uereth Psal. 34. 20. them out of all) but according to the promise heere set downe, he saith that he shall come out of aduersitie. Whatsoeuer then the wicked doe ymagine, thinke, say or doe against the iust, they cannot destroy them. The wicked watcheth the righteous, & Psal. 37. 22. seeketh to slay him: but the Lord wil not leaue him in his hand, &c. In this promise wee are exhorted vnto patience: for trouble or aduersitie lyeth vpon vs, sith it is saide that the iust shal come out thereof. Hee saieth not that hee doeth presently come out, but in time to come, hee shal come foorth. Hee telleth not when, and so it seemeth vnto our reason, that GOD lingereth and tarieth long ere hee helpe vs: but it is no slacknesse. And to the ende that Heb. 10. 37. 2. Pet. 3. 9. Iam. 5. 10. Heb. 12. 2. we should not fayle nor stumble, we must take heed vnto the holy Prophetes, and chiefly vnto our Lorde Iesus. Hee is not onely our example, but also our strength and vertue. It is he which is our pa∣tience: for wee cannot stande fast and continue, except that hee for∣tifie and vpholde vs. 14 A man shall be satiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes shall God giue vnto him. Solomon exhorteth vs to vse wel our mouthes, and to imploy them to speake trueth, to thanke, to praise and to cal vpon God our Father by prayer, when hee promiseth vs that a man shalbe satiate, &c. And heerein hee somewhat alludeth vnto the olde sacrifices. Deut. 12. 7. & 14. 23. For as they which offred the sacrifices, did eate of them by the permission and ordinance of God: euen so by following the counsel of the Prophete O seas, if we take the wordes with vs, and Ose. 14. 2 returne vnto the Lord, and say vnto him, Take away al iniquitie, & receiue vs graciously: so wil wee render the calues of our lippes,
And that in al thinges wee giue thankes alwaies vnto God by Ie∣sus Christ, that is, the frute of the lippes which confesse his name: Heb. 13. 15. If (I say) in folowing the doctrine of the aboue named holy men, wee apply our mouthes to speake trueth, and that by them we giue good counsel vnto our neighbours, admonishing, exhorting, cor∣recting, and threatening them, for to bring them vnto true re∣pentance, and to strengthen them in the fayth: if feeling our ne∣cessities wee open our mouthes, for to require and cal vpon God for to helpe vs, and truely confessing that hee is the authour of all goodnesse, and doe occupie our tongues in giuing of thankes vn∣to him, and to sing foorth his praises: hee wil not suffer vs to lacke or want any thing, but wil giue vs ynough and contenta∣tion. The auncient Leuites and Sacrificers by the ordinance of GOD, were nourished and sustained by vsing their ministery. Num. 18. 9. Deut. 10. 9. &. 18. 1. 1. Chro. 6. 31. Num. 10. 10 Psal. 8. 2. & 11. Dauid ordeined of them to be ouer the arte of singing, according as was commaunded in the lawe of Moyses. And the Psalme 81. ha∣uing respect vnto this order of the seruice of GOD, doeth bid vs, Sing ioyfully: and afterwardes doeth promise vs that wee shalbee satisfied, saying, Open thy mouth wyde, and I shal fill it. For to do this wel, it suffiseth not for the mouth alone to bee occupy∣ed, but the song must come from the minde, &c. That which proceedeth from the mouth of Papistes is no fruite, but poyson: as wee may vnderstande and gather. And therefore this pro∣mise doeth nothing appertaine vnto them: as also they are no∣thing partakers thereof: for they burne so much with auarice, that they are neuer satisfied, and make themselues beleeue that they serue GOD and his Churche wel, when they can make the water come to the mill (as is saide) or increase the goods of the Churche. Of such kinde of people Saint Paule saieth, that they are of a corrupted minde. After this promise, he ad∣deth, And the recompence of the hands, &c. This sentence conteineth partly a promise, and partly a threatening: as wee may vnderstande by other places. This sentence, as also the former promise, shal chiefly bee accom∣plished at the last day. Yet notwithstanding in looking for it, the Lorde doeth shewe some proofes thereof: for euen in this
life present, the good are so wel recompensed that they con∣tent themselues: Contrarily, wee may see feareful punishe∣mentes, fal and lighte vpon the wicked, the which are payde them after their desertes: but that which is giuen vnto the good, commeth of meere grace: as aboue in the 11. chapter, 18. verse, and chapter 12. verse, 2. 15 The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counsel, is wise. When after the natural reason, or humaine sense, or the affec∣tion of the fleshe, wee followe our fantasies, inuentions and good intentes, wee seeme to ourselues to bee very wise, and that wee walke vprightly. But sith that in so dooing, wee wander and goe out of the way which is taught vs by the woorde, the which only is right: Solomon, or rather the holy Ghost, letteth not to pronounce vs fooles, when hee saith, The way of a foole, &c. Moy∣ses seeing before hande howe the children of Israel did stray from Deut. 3 the seruice of God, that hee had taught them, by his woorde, cal∣leth them fooles and vnwise, saying, they haue corrupted them∣selues towardes him by their vice. &c. For the selfe same cause, Ie∣remy also since that time, hath called them fooles, saying, Heare nowe this, O foolishe people, and without vnderstanding, which Iere. . 21. haue eyes and see not, which haue eares and heare not. And for∣asmuch as the Papistes at this day doe the like, delighting in their abhominations, wee may truely say they are a foolishe people. Nowe if they which thinke they doe wel, are foolishe, by a stron∣ger reason, they which boast themselues in their wickednesses, the which they commit against their consciences, deserue wel to bee counted foolish. For this cause also it is saide of them, The foole hath saide in his heart, there is no God, &c. Except therefore that Psal. 14.  wee bee assured that that which wee say, or doe, is according to that which God teacheth vs by his woorde, let vs take good heede from perswading ourselues that wee doe walke right. For there is no way right, but onely that which the Lorde God doth shew vnto
vs in his lawe. The same is not ours, aswel for that that of our nature wee forsake it, and are not pleased therewith, as also for that wee cannot walke, but that GOD wil guide vs, nor goe forewardes without his assistance, as may bee gathered out of the hundreth and nynetienth Psalme. Therfore when any thing doeth delight vs besides the woorde of God, wee are foolishe: for our way is right before our eyes. The same is called ours, aswell for that that wee become forgetful of God, despise him, and rebel against him, for to folowe our fantasies and affections: as also for that that whatsoeuer pleaseth vs, is inuented by our braines, or commeth from our Fathers which haue beene ignorant of the woorde, or that wee attribute the same vnto our wisedome and cunning, vnto our care and diligence. And indeede, we doe wel deserue that such way shoulde be ours, seeing it is nothing worth. For seeing that wee are good for nothing, wee cannot bee occupy∣ed about any thing that is ought. Wherevppon it followeth that wee are foolishe, if wee delight in such woorke: for in such sorte doe wee declare openly our foolishenesse, when that which is nothing worth, yea rather which is hurtful vnto vs, doeth please vs. Contrarily, if so bee by renouncing of that which is our owne, and abhorre it, wee doe giue eare vnto those which giue vs good counsel, and beleeue the same, delighting to folowe it, and to order our life thereafter, wee are wise: as Solomon doeth affirme saying, But hee that heareth counsel, is wise. Hee speaketh not heere of the corporal and external hearing, but of the inwarde and Pro. 1. 25. spiritual. For albeeit that the counsel whereof hee speaketh is the pure woorde of trueth, which serueth to teache, to exhort, to cor∣rect and to threaten: many doe heare this woorde, and yet are not Mat. 7. 26. wyse. Wee must therefore heare with an earnest minde, to take pleasure, and to giue al diligence to folowe the counsel that is gi∣uen vs in the name of GOD, and by his woorde. Otherwise wee must looke for a feareful iudgement: yea more then the Pa∣pistes Pro. 1. 26. or other infidelles, which haue not such communication of counsel as wee haue. They haue counsel which maketh to erre, and wee haue counsel which leadeth vs straight to life, if wee fol∣lowe
it. Notwithstanding they shalbee no more excusable then the most vnthankeful: as are they whome God lighteneth by the preaching of the pure trueth and doe despise it, mocking, refusing and persecuting it. Moreouer, for to shewe ourselues wise, and Luke. 18. 11. Iohn. 9. 28. & 34. not to bee counted fooles, let vs bee more ready to condemne our¦selues, then to boast ourselues: let vs not bee like vnto the Phari∣sees. 16 A foole in a day shalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth shame, is wise. Man is of such a nature, that he wil be feared and douted, and cannot suffer to bee despised, nor to receiue any signe of contempt. If it seeme to him that any labour to trouble him, hee is straight∣waies moued with anger and wrath, and sodainely doeth shewe it by contentions, debates, strifes, and vprores, in outragious wordes and violent deedes. Hee boyleth so vehemently with impatien∣tie and furie, hee hath so greate desire to bee reuenged for the iniu∣rie, that hee perswadeth himselfe to bee done vnto him, that he loo∣seth al boldnesse, and cannot dissemble his naughtie stomacke: and yet, it seemeth vnto him that hee is mighty and strong, and that hee behaueth himselfe as an honest man, and that his heart is vpright, because hee suffereth none to bite him, neither to treade him vn∣der foote. But the holy Ghost doeth pronounce him to bee a foole by the mouth of Solomon, when hee saith, A foole in a day shal-be knowne, &c. Saying, A foole in a day, hee meaneth not that the foole is satisfied to haue shewed his anger and wrath for a litle while, and afterwards, returneth to be reconciled and to be friendes againe with them with whome hee was angry, as euery one of vs must doe, in folowing the goodnesse of our heauenly Father. For he endureth but a whyle in his anger: but in his fauour is life. Psal. 30. . And for to folowe him, wee must obey Saint Paule. Bee an∣gry, but sinne not, &c. Againe, Let all bitternesse, an∣ger Ephe. 4. 26. 31. and wrath crying and euill speaking, bee put away from you with all maliciousnesse, &c. But hee meaneth that wee must not dwell and abyde long in the companie of a foole,
for to knowe the wickednesse of his heart: for as soone as a man shal haue remoued but a strawe without his wil, without pur∣posing to offende him, hee sheweth by iniuries, ragings and vio∣lences, what hee is within. As Caine against Abel: Core, Dathan and Abyram against Moyses: Saule against Dauid: the enemies of the trueth against the children of GOD, not one∣ly Num. 16. amongest the Papistes, but also there where they bragg of the reformation of the Gospel. Also when hee saieth, in a day, hee meaneth not that the foole doeth spue foorth al the poyson of his hearte in one day or in a little tyme. Expe∣rience teacheth vs the contrarie: for wee see that from day to day the wicked shewe themselues more furious against the faithful but hee meaneth that they are easie and doe sodainely shewe their im∣patiencie and furie. In this Solomon doeth exhorte vs, that wee woulde not bee hastily angry, except wee woulde bee counted fooles: that is to say, contemners of GOD and of his woorde, the which for to obey, and to fulfil, the humour of choler is not fit, neither do they care also: and therefore Saint Iames doeth admonishe vs: Let euery man bee swift to heare, and slowe to anger. &c. Wee see heere that wee ought highly to esteeme, gentlenes, softnesse, meekenesse, and friendlinesse, when wee woulde not that men shoulde esteeme vs fooles nor contemners of God. If wee bee indued with such goodnesse, as that we would not despise God, & labour also that he may not bee despised, and that his name shoulde not bee blasphe∣med by vs, likewise wee wil easily dissemble and couer the imper∣fections of our neighbours, and wil not seeke to make them a re∣proche, neither to lay any faulte to their charge, though they haue offended vs: and shalbee led and induced thus to gouerne our¦selues by an holy wisedome and good counsel. Solomon doth teach vs this same when hee saith, But hee that couereth shame, is wise. That wee must thus vnderstande this sentence, Solomon himselfe doeth shewe it, when against the knowledge of wrath, hee setteth hyding or couering of shame: and against the foole, hee setteth the wise man. And though the Antithesis be very propre, euen accor∣ding
to mans reason, yet Solomon speaketh against the opinion and iudgement of the worlde, in both the partes of this Pro∣uerbe. For first of al, the worlde esteemeth and iudgeth the hearte of man to bee vpright and perfite, and not feare∣full nor cowardely, if when hee sheweth by wrath and an∣ger, that hee cannot beare, if hee feele himselfe grieued, and that hee is ready, to reuenge himselfe eyther by woorde or by deede. Secondarily, the worlde doth not count this discretion or wise∣dome when a man wil dissemble or couer an offence, and that hee is not quicke to reuile and rage against him that hath offended him, except hee flye for to take the better leape: that is to say, to seeke to haue him whome hee iudgeth to bee his enemie at his more ad∣uantage, and to handle him after his desire. Solomon speaketh not of such wisedome, which is rather set malice: but of the same whereby wee beare with our neighbour, and wish not to anger nor hurte him. This wisedome proceedeth of true charitie, whereunto 1. Cor. 13. 4 Ephe. 4. 2. 32. & 5. 2. Col. 3. 13. Mat. 5. 39. Rom. 12. 14. 17. & 13. 4 wee are exhorted. Let vs therefore knowe that wee are heere ad∣monished to flye and eschue reuenging of our owne and priuate iniurie: as also our Lorde doth teache vs. But yet notwith∣standing let vs not thinke but that it is lawefull for the fayth∣ful and Christians to exercise and execute the office of a Magi∣strate and iudge, in dooing iustice by wrath vppon him that doth euil. 17 Hee that speaketh trueth, will shewe righteousnes: but a false witnesse vseth disceit. There are many wayes of speaking trueth, though there bee Iohn. 14. 6. & 17. 17. Ephe. 4. 25. not diuers truthes, but one, which is God and his word, Our Lord doeth shewe it, and therefore in what state soeuer we be, wee must speake trueth. Nowe forasmuch as there are diuers states, it folow∣eth there are many wayes of speaking trueth, the which may bee gathered into foure partes.
First of al, the Pastors of the Churche, which are Ministers of the woorde of trueth, which aboue al other ought to professe trueth, haue their manner of speaking trueth by publike and pri∣uate preaching the pure Gospel, and by the same to admonishe, to reprooue, to comforte, to chide and threaten and to make afraide. Secondarily, Iudges and Magistrates which ought to bee righ∣teous and not falsly blamed, haue their kinde of speaking trueth, when they pronounce their sentences with desire of Exo. 18. 21. & 23. 1. giftes, without regarding the person: but onely according as mat∣ters shalbe duely and plainly prooued, &c. Thirdly, they which are called for witnesses, haue their way of speaking trueth, when they plainely declare that which they knowe, and desire not to slaunder nor flatter, nor to speake any thing that may hurte the good name of their neighbour, neither to hurte him either in his body or in his goods, but doe labour to obey the commandementes of GOD written in Exodus the 20. chapter and 23. chapter. Fourthly, the manner of speaking trueth, in our common, familiar and priuate talke, is that wee shoulde talke togither of thinges and matters euen so as they are, and as wee knowe them, without flattering and slaundering, without affecti∣on of telling newes, and without delighting to consume and passe away the time in reasoning and babbling, as vaine people giuen to ydlenesse and slouthfulnesse: for it is very harde for such men to go foreward in the truth: but must needs frō the great vanitie of their heartes speake vaine thinges, whose steppes wee may not follow: and therefore, must wee be sober in woordes, and also not to open our mouthes, but to talke and commen of thinges profitable and necessarie, as of thinges which may serue to the glory of GOD, and profite of our neighbours, and of those matters which con∣cerne our state and vocation, &c. Loe, these are the manners the which wee must holde in speaking trueth: vnto the which if wee bee wel giuen, wee will vtter nothing that may redounde to the hurte of our neighbours, but will rather procure that right may be done to them, and to render to euery man that which is his, without fraude or deceit. Solomon doeth signifie the same, saying, Hee that speaketh truth, wil shew righteousnesse. The
Ministers of the woorde doe wel preache righteousnesse, when by their ministery they labour to turne vs away from al superstiti∣on and Idolatry, and from al iniquitie and wickednesse (whereby the Deuill doeth holde vs captiue vnder his tyrannie) that they might deliuer vs from the same, and by fayth to make vs partakers of the righteousnesse of our Lorde. The Magistrates do shewe foorth righteousnesse, when by their sentences and iudgementes, they render right to them to whome it belongeth, &c. The wit∣nesses by their true depositions doe shewe foorth righteousnesse: for so much as in them lyeth, they guide the iudges, and shewe them the waye to minister iustice. Also when in our familiar talke and communication wee continewe speaking of trueth, wee shewe foorth iustice: for our woordes doe tende neither to disceite nor hurte, but to doe right, pleasure, and seruice vnto our neigh∣bours. Wherefore, let vs vnderstande that to speake trueth, consisteth not onely in the mouth, but also in woorkes. Solomon doeth well teache it vs, when hee ioyneth righteousnesse togither with truth, and that afterwardes against righteousnesse, hee setteth fraude: say∣ing, But a false witnesse vseth disceite. As wee haue set foure kindes of speaking truth, and to shew righteousnesse, so may we do the like in speaking of false witnesse, and in woorking disceite. Be∣sides this, let vs learne that by this Antithesis or against setting, So∣lomon doeth exhorte vs to haue trueth and righteousnesse in great reuerence, seeing that none of vs woulde bee counted lyers nor de∣ceiuers, &c. 18 There is that speaketh wordes like the prickinges of a sword: but the tongue of the wise man is health. There is none of vs that would be pricked or harmed, but do a desire health and do labour by al meanes possible to auoide all dan∣gers and hurtes, and to keepe our bodies in good order and safetie. Nowe if wee haue care of our bodies which are not so excellent as our soules, by a more strong reason wee must take care of them, and to keepe them that they bee not pricked: but that they may obteine health, and that therein they
shoulde continue and increase. For to come to this, there are com∣panies and feloweshippes that wee must flye and reiect, and others that wee must seeke and keepe. Solomon doeth wel giue vs this same to vnderstande, when hee saith, There is that speaketh words, &c. Heere by that, which he placeth the wise against him which speaketh like the prickings of a sworde, wee ought to knowe that if wee will not bee hurte, wee must beware of the foolishe, for they are they which by their woordes are as swordes. There are di∣uers kindes of these fooles which are very dangerous, as are the wicked iudges, and wicked magistrates, false witnesse bearers, flat∣terers, lyers, iesters, and such as abounde in wanton woordes. The woordes of such people doe pricke and smart after twoo sortes: that is to say, without and within. If wee doe not consent with them, and doe not become their familiar acquaintance and friendes, and at their commandement, doe labour by their wicked sentences, by their false witnesse bearings, by their wicked tales, & by their iestings, and scornings for to hurte vs, either in our goods or in our bodies, or in our good name. And if we walke familiarly with them, they prick vs and sting vs within, for they do what they can with their tongues to corrupt vs. Therefore Saint Paule doeth admonish vs, saying, Bee not deceiued: euil woordes corrupt good 1. Cor. 15. 33. 2. Cor. 6. 14. Ephe. 5. 3. manners. Againe, hee saith, Be not vnequally yoked with the infi∣dels: for what felowship hath righteousnesse, with vnrighteousnes? &c. He saieth againe, But fornication, and al vncleannesse, or coue∣tousnesse, let it not bee once named among you, as it becommeth saints, neither filthinesse, neither foolishe talking, neither iesting, which are things not comely, but rather giuing of thāks. We learne then that we must fly such kinde of people, and haue no acquaintāce with them, if wee woulde bee preserued from inwarde hurt, which is a more dangerous and sore wounde then that without. Nowe if wee must seuer ourselues from such folke, by a stronger reason, wee must flye and reiect false Prophetes and lying Doctours, which by sweete woordes and fayre speeches doe deceiue the harts of the ignorant. The wordes of such people are so dangerous and deadly, that Saint Paule warneth Timothie, To stay prophane, and . Tim. 2. 16. vaine babblings: for they shal increase vnto more vngodlinesse.
If it seemed good to Saint Paule to bee needful to admonishe so excellent a disciple of these things, by so much the more haue wee very greate neede to bee warned thereof. Of al these points we cannot take heede, but haue neede that the Lorde shoulde keepe and deliuer vs. The Psalmist doeth wel shewe it vs, when hee is Psal. 57. 4. so diligent to pray, My soule is amongst Lyons: I lye among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are speares and arrowes, and their tongue a sharpe swoorde. Againe hee saieth, & 64. . Heare my voyce, O God, in my prayer, preserue my life from feare of the enemie. Hyde mee from the conspiracye of the wicked, and from the rage of the woorkers of iniquitie: Which haue whet their tongue like a sworde, and shot foorth their arrowes, bitter woordes. Further, let vs note that Solomon doeth accuse such kinde of men to be murtherers, when hee doeth attribute vn∣to them the prickings of a sworde, and so consequently, hee con∣demneth them vnto eternal death. For it is said, You know that no manslear hath eternal life abyding in him. Therefore if wee will not perish with them, let vs soften our tongues, and make them 1. Iohn. 3. 15. sounde and healthful: the which wee shal doe, if renouncing foo∣lishnesse, wee doe folowe the wise, and that by their wholesome doctrine, and good examples wee become wise: for as Solomon saith, But the tongue of wise men is health. As wee commonly cal those things whereby wee get and mainteine corporal health, by the name thereof: euen so Solomon calleth the tongue of the wise, health, because that if wee vse the same and helpe vs by it, wee ob∣teine an excellent health, and are kept therein. If wee bee dili∣gent to heare the wise, and also careful to followe their whole∣some doctrine, wee shal haue health, not temporal and bodily on∣ly, but our soules shalbee so healthful, that wee shal neuer die. The tongue of the wise is of such vertue, that whosoeuer shal helpe himselfe thereby in true fayth and repentance, it shal bring vnto him eternal life: for it speaketh the trueth, it bringeth foorth the seede of life and euerlasting health, as before in the thirde chapter and first verse, vnto the nienth: and the fourth chapter and 20. verse, &c. The Psalmist doeth wel shewe this same, when hee Psal. 119. 40 attributeth quickening vnto the woorde of the Lorde. And our
Lorde Iesus Christ doeth plainely declare it vs, when hee compa∣reth himselfe vnto the serpent, and doth exhort vs to beleue in him. Iohn. 3. 14. Therefore if wee desire health, let vs often resorte vnto the ser∣mons, for it is said, Fayth commeth by hearing, and hearing by the woorde of God. Al Christians according to the measure they haue Rom. 10. 17. receiued, ought for to bring this health: but the Ministers of the woorde aboue al others: for to them it is that the Lord hath com∣mitted the Gospel, after the which they bring wholesome doctrine. And therefore Saint Paule doeth admonishe Timothe to keepe the true paterne of the wholesome woordes, &c. Againe, For a bishop 2. Tim. 1. 13. Tit. 1. 7. &. 2. 1. must bee vnreprooueable, as Gods steward, &c. But speake thou the thinges which become wholesome doctrine. &c. Nowe foras∣much as amongest the Papistes there are no wise men, they are also destitute of health, &c. Moreouer let vs note that although the worlde bee filled with people which haue great appearance of wise∣dome, yet are there fewe in it that haue healthful tongues. Where∣vpon wee may inferre that wise men indeede are thicke sowne, and come but thinly vp. &c. 19 The lippe of trueth shalbee stable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently. Wee woulde not bee iudged reedeshaken and caried with e∣uerywinde, but counted constant. And as we haue this wil, so must wee bee also indeede and truly, least wee bee nowe of one minde, and immediatly of another, except that hauing bene euil instructed before, and euil mouthed, wee change our euil woordes into good, after that by the grace of God wee are informed. This changing doeth not proceede of vnconstancie, but of wisedome and good counsel. The Turkes, Papistes, and other obstinate infidels and har∣dened in their superstitions and idolatries, in their false religions & deuotions, do thinke themselues very constant, when they wil in no wise be turned from them: but it is not in this sorte that wee must count ourselues constant, but before that wee may truely bragge thereof, we must first be armed and furnished inuiolably with truth. that our hartes and mindes may bee so fastened and filled with so great aboundance that they might ouerflowe. Solomon doeth note
it, saying, The lippe of trueth. &c. The man that from the abun∣dance of his hearte speaketh trueth, shalbe so stable and cōstant, that hee shal neuer turne therefrom: his lippe shal not start at a soden, and without good consideration but shal folow the guiding of his hearte and of his vnderstanding. There are many which prate at pleasure, holding true talke, but yet shal not haue the lippe of truth, as they wil shewe by their inconstancie, & that after diuers sortes: for some will soone waxe wery of holding good talke, and wil turne ouer vnto fables and vanities: and other some fear∣ring persecution, had rather holde their peace, or to deny the trueth, then to perseuer in good and true wordes: and other∣some wil pleasure a company of carnal and worldly people, and therefore if in any wise they know that their company delight not in true and Christian talke, they change and turne vnto fables, and vaine iangling. If such men had their tongues of trueth, they would remaine stedfast without euer turning. Trueth is of suche nature, that it neuer changeth, otherwise it should not be trueth. It hath this nature of God, who is vn∣changeable: and therefore as the Psalmist saith, The trueth of the Psal. 117. 2. Lorde indureth for euer. Againe, There is no trueth, but commeth from him onely who is trueth. Wherefore if hee hath once wri∣ten this truethe in our heartes, and that thereby wee bee truely re∣newed, wee can neuer vary nor turne from it. For the giftes and callings of God are without repentance: and so we shal abide stable Rom. 11. 29. and constant for euer. But for this constancie let vs not boast ourselues of it, as though it came of vs, but with humblenesse let vs confesse that it commeth of God, as we may heere knowe it. First of al, because hee attributeth stabilitie vnto trueth, the which wee cannot haue but of the onely grace and liberalitie of God. Secondarily, by that that he saith not, it shalbe stablished: but it shalbe stable. Thirdly, by this worde foreuer: for man of himselfe hath no permanent & continuall goodnesse. We must therefore aske stedfastnesse of God, Psal. 51. 10. &. 12. as Dauid doth, Create in me a cleane hart, O God, & renew a right spirite in me: and in the 12. verse of the same Psalm, he saith, Restore to mee the ioy of thy saluation, & stablish me with thy free spirite.
For they which haue their heartes infected with falshood, dissimu∣lation, & hypocrisie, are not stable, but turne with euery winde, & change their mindes incōtinently. If they haue made any promise, they doe easily falsifie their faith, euē for euery vaine and light cause. &c. They wil often speake traiterously, and vnfaithfully vnto their neighbours, speaking one thing, & thinking another. They wil flat∣ter and praise their neighbours before their faces, and behinde their backes they wil slaunder them, and speake al euil they can of them. They wil closly cary false tales, and when they haue kindled the fire, and that the matter is disclosed, and that it is knowne to be by thē, they doe shamelesly deny it. If they haue reported any good or naughtie matter, and that they are therfore like to come to trouble, they sodenly change their mind, and go backe from that which they haue saide. Behold the inconstancie and vnstabilitie wherevnto the hypocrites and liers are subiect. Solomon doeth signific the same briefly, when he saith, But a lying tongue varieth, &c. As if hee said, The man that out of the wicked abundance of his heart is set∣teled in lying and hypocrisie, is accustomed to lie with his tongue, and cannot be stable and sure: but easily and sodenly doth alter his purpose. For though Solomon doth not expresse but the tongue, yet notwithstanding he doeth accuse the heart, the which is made ma∣nifest by the tongue, which of itselfe is not moued, but onely so farre as it is guided by the hearte. For from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. Naturally we are al such. For let God be Rom. 3. 4. true, and euery man a lyar. Wherefore if we wil not be comprehē∣ded vnder this accusation, let vs follow the counsell of S. Paul, that is, That yee cast off, concerning the conuersatiō in time past, the old Ephe. 4. 22. man, which is corrupt through the deceiueable lusts. &c. Moreouer, let vs note, that hee which hath the lip of trueth, is stedfast, for his wordes are true: they conteine no repugnancie nor contrarietie, but al agree wel together: but they which haue a lying tongue, do often times speake wordes which are contrary one to the other: and so doe fouly vary, sometimes through forgetfulnesse, sometimes of set malice for to deceiue and hurt. 20 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counsellours of peace shalbe ioy.
If he which intendeth to hurt his neighbors, doth proceede vn∣aduisedly & rashly to execute his enterprises, he is quickly discoue∣red: and therefore it is the more easie for a man to beware of him, and to defend himselfe. When the wicked doth openly shewe him∣selfe to bee suche as hee is, without disguising himselfe, if hee be too mightie, men flie from him: and if hee bee weake, they resist him. But contrarily, they which inuent euil, and before that they bigin to execute their enterprises, doe deepely thinke therevpon, and doe a long while purpose in themselues howe they shal come to the end, that their malice may not willingly too soone be discouered, & that they be not hindered to put in execution their displeasure, they dis∣guise themselues, vsing fraude & deceite, treason, and laying await, and so it is not easie for a man to take heede of them, nor to resist them: but is constrained to suffer their wronges and violences, with great griefe and melācholiousnesse. Solomō doth signifie this same, when he saith, Deceite is in the hearte of them that imagine euil. As if hee did say, it is a common and dayly thing that they which imagine euil, which wil hurt and hinder their neighbours, doe not at the first sight shew thēselues such as they bee in their heartes, but doe vse both words and deedes cleane contrary vnto their thoughts and enterprises: as the deuil hath doone for to destroy men, and Iu∣das for to murder our Lord Iesus, The Pope & his shauelings haue no lesse doone for to destroy the Churche of our Lorde: and doe stil continue at this day. But what deceite soeuer they beare in their heartes, they cannot so much hurt as they woulde: for the Lord by the lampe of his Gospel doeth giue vs light, and doeth shewe what their furies are, making vs to knowe their wickednesses: so that the Lorde nowe fulfilleth that which is saide: and then shal the wic∣ked man bee reuealed, whome the Lorde shal consume with the spi∣rite 2. The. 2. . of his mouth, and shal abolishe with the brightnesse of his com∣ming. &c. There are also other people which cary deceit in their heartes, as are murderers: but the most dangerous deceite is that whereby trappes are laide for soules, when in burdening them with the doctrines of men, they are made to beleeue that in keeping thē, they hold the way to life: and thereby men are brought to eternal death. Wee haue saide that when a man cannot take heede of the deceites and treasons of the wicked, and that he is compelled to suf∣fer
their iniuries and violences, that they haue inuented malicious∣ly, that it is with griefe and sorow. Experience doth shew it, & So∣lomon doth note it, when against deceit he setteth ioy, saying: But to counsellours of peace shalbe ioy. And when he placeth the coun∣sellours of peace against them that imagine euil, he sheweth that the imaginers of euill, so much as in them lyeth, doe trouble al, and set al things in disorder, making diuisions and discordes, seditions, and in∣surrections: the which things do cause great troubles and sorowes. Contrarily, they which are giuen vnto holy meditations, and good thoughtes, and haue set their loue vpon the lawe of the Lord, stu∣diyng therein day and night, and in following this holy lawe, doe la∣bour Psal. 1. 2. to set peace in the worlde. Suche people doe not bring trouble nor sorrowe, but ioy: not such as the carnal and worldlinges doe bring, who cannot reioyce except a man please and followe the af∣fections of their fleshe: and make an account of no reioycing, but when they flowe ouer in all insolences and dissolutions. But the counsellours of peace doe so reioyce them that receiue their coun∣sel, that they are best content to see things in good order, that they prayse God, and giue him thankes therfore, and haue al their delite to followe that which is shewed vnto them by the counsellours of peace. To the end then that wee may be partakers of this ioy, wee must folow the counsellours of peace, which are chiefly the ministers of the Worde, whereby they teach vs to bee at peace with al men, & not onely so, but also with God. Al things are of God, who hath re∣conciled Rom. 12. 18. 2. Cor. 5. 18. vs vnto himselfe by Iesus Christ. &c. By this ministery they make peace betweene God & our consciences. We haue also other counsellours of peace, that is to say, our Lords & gouernors, which watch ouer the gouernment of the common wealth, and make ho∣ly ordinances for to stop slaunders, dissentions, seditions and insur∣rections: that the people cōmitted to their charge, may liue in peace. Wee must yeelde vnto their lawes, not onely to the ende that wee may auoide outwarde trouble, but also that wee may haue peace in our consciences. S. Paul doth signifie the same, when he saith, And Rom. 13. 5. therefore wee must be subiect not only for feare of wrath, but also for conscience sake. We ought also al to be counsellors one to ano∣ther, euery man after his state and calling, so doing wee shal haue cause of ioy: For the Lorde saith, Blessed are the peace makers, for Mat. 5. 6.
they shalbe called the children of God. This sentence might be vn∣derstoode after another sort, that is to say, that as they which de∣uise euil for their neighbours, are giuen vnto deceite and treasons: euen so they which wishe peace vnto their neighbours, are filled with ioy, and are not vexed in mind, as they are that inuent malice: for against their willes, their conscience doeth reproue them, and are in an horrible paine, albeit they labour to reioyce in their wicked∣nesse, to the which they are giuen without griefe, with an vnbride∣led lust. The counsellours of peace are oftentimes tormented as∣wel without, as within, but yet they ceasse not to reioyce, and to haue peace in their consciences, knowing that they walke vp∣rightly. &c. 21 There shall no iniquitie come to the iust: but the wicked are full of euill. It hath beene seene in al times, and yet stil is seene, that the iust are persecuted as the wicked and vngodly: but Solomon doeth cleare them from al iniquitie, contrary to the iudgement of the worlde, when hee saith, There shall none iniquitie come to the iust Wherin at the first sight he seemeth to speake against the Scripture. Who can bring a cleane thing out of filthinesse? there is none. What is man, that he shoulde be cleane? And hee that is borne of Iob. 14. 4▪ &. 15. 14. Pro. 20. 9. Eccle. 7. 22. Iohn. 3. 6. Rom. 3. 22 woman, that he shoulde be iust? Who can say, I haue made my hart cleane, I am cleane from my sinne? Surely there is no man iust in the earth, that doeth good and sinneth not. That which is borne of flesh, is fleshe. For there is no difference: for al haue sinned, and are depriued of the glory of God. &c. Or at leastwise, if hee doe not gainst say the Scripture, it seemeth that there is none that is righte∣ous. Al are gone out of the way: they are al corrupt: there is Psal. 14. 3. Mat. 6. 12. 1. Iohn. 1. 8. none that doeth good, no not one. Wee are commanded al to pray for the forgiuenesse of our sinnes. If wee say wee haue not sin∣ned, wee deceiue ourselues, and the trueth is not in vs. Nowe sinne commeth of none but of vs. Euery man is tempted, when hee is drawne away by his owne concupiscence, and is entised. It Iam. 1. 14. seemeth then at the first sight, that he should gainst say the scripture,
or of his saying it might bee inferred that there is none righteous, and that the first part of this sentence is pronounced in vaine. The answere is, that Solomon speaketh not of man as hee is borne of man: for in the same nature he is altogether destitute of iustice: but he speaketh of man as he is regenerated by the spirte of GOD, by whom he is so ordered and guided, that hee abhorreth al iniquitie, and delighteth in goodnesse, and doth giue himselfe thereto so much as hee can. For this cause, though whiles he liueth in this body, he hath stil some relikes of corruption, and that sinne dwelleth in him: Rom. 7. 14. yet because that the seede of God is in him, he delighteth in the law of God. Solomon doth impute none iniquitie vnto him, but doeth purge him thereof: as doth S. Iohn also, He that is borne of God, 1. Iohn. 3. sinneth not, &c. And this is not without cause: for inasmuche as Christ by his spirit & his word, dwelleth in vs, sin is abolished in vs, and yet for the principal part we are counted iust, and to liue iustly, because that with a pure affection, we aspire vnto righteousnes. And albeit that through the infirmitie of our flesh we often fal, yet is it saide, that we worke none iniquitie, that wee doe not sinne, because we doe not consent vnto sinne, but rather in weeping, we resist and fight against sinne, so that we may truly witnesse with S. Paul, That we do the euil we wold not do: for this cause also it is not imputed Rom. 7. 19. &. 8. 1. vnto vs, neither are we condēned for it. This is not to say, but that we should confesse ourselues truely to be sinners, and continually to aske forgiuenes of our sinnes: as Iesus Christ hath ordeined vnto al his Church. Although then that none iniquitie come to the iust, yet Psal. 32. 1. Rom. 4. 7. the iust is not he that hath no sinne, but he to whome God wil not impute it. Wherefore, for to make vs certaine that we are of the nū∣ber of the righteous, let vs aspire vnto wel doing in soundnesse and integritie of conscience, praying vnto the Lorde, Create in mee a cleane hart, O God, and renewe a right spirite within mee. Contra∣rily, Psal. 51. 10. as touching that which hath bin saide at the beginning, that the wicked are honored & beloued of the world, as if they were honest men: yet Solomon doth depriue them of al iustice, when hee saith, but the wicked are full of euill. When Solomon exempteth the iust from al iniquitie, and that contrarily, hee attributeth vnto the wicked, fulnesse of euil; hee declareth that the wicked doe purpose and determine nothing but to doe euil, and to hurte.
And albeit that in some places they make a goodly shew of iustice and holines, as in their almes, fastings, and prayers, yet from the a∣bundance of their euil, they corrupt & defile al: Vnto them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing, nothing is pure, but euen their minds and Tit. 1. 15. consciences are defiled. This sentence thus considered, wee may ga∣ther of the promise and threatening that Iesus Christ pronounceth, They that haue done euil, shal go vnto the resurrection of condem∣nation. Ioh. 5. 29. And thus Solomon by this sentence doeth exhort vs vnto righteousnes, and doeth labour to turne vs away from wickednes: but there are verie fewe which make any account thereof: and as we see by experience, we may wel complaine with the Prophet Esai, Esai. 59. 6. & 14. their works are wicked works, and the worke of crueltie is in their handes: Therefore iudgement is turned backward, and iustice stan∣deth farre of: for trueth is fallen in the streete, and equitie can not enter. 22 The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight. Lying hath alwayes liked men, as appeareth, there where wee may see, that man rather beleeued the Deuil father of lying, then o∣beyed Gen. 3. 6. God. And as he was easie to beleeue lyes, euen so gaue hee himselfe to speake the same with his mouth, and to doe it also by worke, in folowing his father and maister the Deuil: and so made himselfe the enemie of God, who is the father of trueth, euen truth it self. But albeit that mā doth delight to lie, so that it is not without cause that the Scripture saieth, that al men are liers: yet his consci∣ence doeth reprooue him therefore, and causeth him to iudge that Psal. 116. 1 it is wickedly done of man for to lye: as it is manifest by two argu∣ments. The first is, that there is none that would haue any man to lye vnto him: and also we say, that a lier is worse then a theefe, be∣cause we can not so wel take heede from a lier, as from a theefe. The second argument is, That wee ourselues would not be counted ly∣ers: and if any man belye vs, we are by and by prouoked vnto an∣ger: and if we be able, we are readie to strike and to kil them that be∣lye vs. Wee naturally then vnderstande, that it is great wickednesse for to lye: but for to make vs yet more excusable, (except wee fo∣low
this natural light,) the Lord hath giuen vs his lawe by writing, the which saith, Thou shalt beare no false witnesse, &c. Also let vs Exo. 20. 16. folow the instruction of S. Paule, Put away lying, and speake euerie man trueth to his neighbour, &c. Let not whoredome nor any o∣ther vncleannesse bee once named amongst you. &c. Thus doing, we shalbe acceptable vnto God, as Solomon doth pro∣nounce it, saying, But they that deale truely, are his delight. Whē Solomon is not contented to say, which speake trueth: but sayeth, that deale truely: he sheweth vs that trueth doth not lye onely in word, but also indeed and works, that are done so faithfully & with such trueth, that we feare not though they be examined, seene, and knowne. Our Lord doeth wel shew it. Nowe this is condemnation, Ioh. 3. 19. that light is come into the word, & men loue darkenesse more then light. And when he setteth to deale truely, against lying lippes, wee knowe thereby that lying is also in fained and counterfait woorkes, the which haue their colour and disguising for lippes. For it is as much as if they did bragge to be good and lawful. Whosoeuer shal sel a counterfait worke or marchandise, though he say nothing, yet ceaseth he not to lye: for he setteth it to sale, and selleth it also as deare as he can. Contrarily, they that worke truely, though they be dumbe, yet are they true, & work truth, the which God loueth, and thē that work it: as Solomon doth signifie, whē he saith, They are his delight. Herein wee haue the promise of life enclosed & cō∣teined: for it foloweth wel, if we please God, we can not perishe. 23 Awise man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publisheth foolishnes. Solomon attributeth suttletie, that is to say, counsel and wisdom vnto the man that keepeth secret his knowledge: but when we are not borne for ourselues onely, and that God doeth not communi∣cate his graces vnto vs, for to vse them for ourselues, without hel∣ping our neighbours: it seemeth at the first sight that Solomon shoulde attribute malice and vnthankfulnesse vnto him that hideth knowledge, and not suttletie, except wee cal him suttle, which hath the cunning to deceiue and to beguile his neighbours, and to make his profite by the hurt of others. Knowledge ought not to bee kept secret, as Solomon himselfe hath shewed before, in the first Chap∣ter, 20. verse. and in diuers other places, where he exhorteth vs vn∣to hearing. God also hath wel shewed, when hee hath raysed vp
so many Prophetes for to teache his people of Israel. Our Lorde Iesus Christ doeth teach vs likewise, Ye are the light of Mat. 5. 14. & 10. 27. & 28. 19. the worlde, &c. That which I tel you in darkenesse, doe you preach on the house toppe, &c. Goe and teache al people, &c. I answere, that it is notlawful for man to holde his knowledge so secrete, that he should make no man partaker thereof: and also it is not the mind of Solomon to allow such kinde of doing. And therefore that we may perfitly vnderstande this present saying of Solomon, let vs knowe that hee speaketh by comparison, setting the modestie and temperancie of awise and discrete man, against the insolencie and excesse of the foolishe, that hath neither manner nor measure in their sayings nor in their walking, but are ful of boasting & osten∣tation. They would be seene and praised in things that are vaine & nothing worth: as Solomon doeth signifie, saying, that the hart of the fooles publisheth foolishnes. The minde then of Solomon is Mat. 7. 6. to shewe that the wise man, for al the knowledge hee hath, wil ra∣ther holde his peace, and keepe silence, then to giue any signe of o∣stentation and boasting either in his words or workes. He wil marke both the time and a fit occasion for to bestowe his knowledge: and also he wil consider with what people hee hath to doe: and accor∣ding as he shal know to be expedient, he wil imploy his knowledge in vtterance and in doing what he can for the honour of God, and profite of his neighbours: or if it be neeful wil abstaine. Giue not those thinges that are holie vnto dogges, &c. The Ministers of the worde are chiefly they that ought to conceale knowledge, and to take good heed of saying or doing any thing by ostentation: for they are sent of Christe for to preache the Gospel, not in wisedome of wordes that the crosse of Christe shoulde bee made vaine. And 1. Cor. 1. 17. &. 2. 1. 2. Cor. 2. 17. so they ought to followe the modestie of Paule, who saith, And I brethren, when I came, and that they may say, Truely wee are not many &c. And as for such is the duty of ministers, euen so also they that are taught by them, ought not to affect for to shewe that they learned muche, and are very wel learned: but must (following the Iam. 1. 18 doctrine of Saint Iames) being begotten by the worde of trueth, and not of ourselues, but of the proper wil of God) bee swift to heare, and slowe to speake. But notwithstanding let vs not bee slowe to speake, that wee shoulde not teache our housholdes, and family, & also our neighbours, where necessitie should require
for of the gifts that God hath giuen vs, wee must make our neigh∣bours partakers, Euerie one as he hath receiued. And that not one∣ly in wordes, but in workes: lest we be like them, who when they 1. Pet. 4. 10 knowe any arte or science, woulde haue none to know it but them∣selues: they wil not gladly teache it to others, and doe enuy them that doe knowe it. Let vs not I say, be like such people, but with∣out desiring ostentation, let vs make our neighbours partakers with vs of the benefites, giftes, and graces that we haue receiued of God: so doing, wee shalbe wise, and shal conceale knowledge, and shall not folow fooles, who hauing their hearts puffed vp with pride and arrogancie, with ambition and vaine glorie, doe desire to be seene: but because they are depriued of good and true wisedome, & haue not the knowledge of God, they doe bring foorth of their heartes, nothing but folishnesse, and doe shewe openly that there is nothing in them but foolishnesse, as though they proclaimed it by sounde of trumpet, for to make it knowne to all: and yet make themselues be∣leeue that they are very subtil and wise, and would be counted such. The Pope is the prince of such fooles, as we may know by his tra∣ditions, and by his conuersation. For the heart of the foolish doeth not onely leade the tongue, but also all the members of the body. The Nichodemites do thinke to be subtil, to bee wise and very dis∣crete, to wit, when they hold their peace for feare of persecution: but their hearts do wel preach foolishnes, when by outward conuersa∣tion they conforme themselues, & become like vnto the wicked. 24 The hande of the diligent shalbeare rule: but the ydle shalbe vnder tribute. The Princes and great Lords of the earth are naturally led with a desire to rule, so that they may commande others, and no man to haue authoritie for to commande any thing: that they may gather subsidies, imposts, custom & tributes of others, and themselues to be wholy exēpted. And as they desire such things, so are they graun∣ted 1. Sam. 8. 11 Rom. 13. 5. 6. Wisd. 6. 4. Iosu. 16. 10. & 17. 13. thē, & giuen thē of God. Neuertheles haue they not al enioyed this graunt, neither yet doe they al enioy it. Wee haue seene in our time, & do stil see it, that kings in captiuitie do pay great raun∣somes: likewise great Lords to be captiues, and free Cities to bee in
bondage. This same came to passe, & commeth commonly to passe for want of heede and diligence, as experience doeth teache it. If 2. Sam. 8. 1. 2. Kings. 18. 10. & 25. 6. Deut. 4. 28. then Kings, Princes, and Lords, would enioy the gift and graunt of God, let them not giue themselues to idlenes and slouth, vnto neg∣ligence and carelesnes, to vanitie and pleasures, vnto voluptuousnes and sportes: but let them watche, let them labour with great care and with al diligence, and to doe that which is their duetie & office. Thus doing, they shal rule, as doth Solomon signifie, in saying, The hande of the diligent shalbeare rule: but it wil be demanded, whe∣ther it be lawful for them that are diligent, to desire to beare rule. I answere, That they which are not placed in high dignitie, ought to walke in suche humilitie, that they may say with the Psalmist, O Psal. 131. 1. Lord, I haue no high heart, neither high lookes, &c. And that they may truely protest so, they must folow the doctrine of our Lord and maister, Whosoeuer wil be the greatest amongst you, let him be Mark. 1. 10. 43. Luk. 22. 25. Iohn. 6. 15. your seruant. The Kings of the nations, &c. And also let them fo∣lowe his example, as hee setteth before vs in the places before alled∣ged: and when he refused to be a King. But the Kings, Princes, and gouernours of the earth, which haue the preheminence, and are or∣deined of God for to rule and reigne, if they be diligent to doe their office, they may desire to beare rule, not cruel and tyrannical, as do they that vse their corrupt and disordered wil for reason and lawe: but they may desire to beare authoritie, whereby they may serue to the glorie and honour of God, vnto rest and quietnes, vnto the e∣dification and saluation of their subiects. For it is needful that the people should feare, reuerence, and honour their Lordes, rendering to thē obedience in al things, without any cōtradiction or murmu∣ring, but that peaceably, with al humblenes, they shoulde submit themselues vnto the ordinances, statutes, and commandementes of their Lordes, not onely in such thinges as concerne the honour of God rightly, but also in them which belong vnto common peace, and to the order of pollicie: and that the superiours also should bee diligent to execute the iudgements of God as the scriptures of God doe instruct them. When the Lordes shal thus worke, it shalbe Exod. 18. 21. Deut. 17. 16. 2. Chro. 19. 6. Psal. 82. 3. lawful for them to desire domination: and indeed also they shal ob∣teine it, according to this promise, the which is infallible. The hand of the diligent shalbeare rule. The same hath bin fulfilled in many
good Magistrates, Iudges, and Kings, as the Scripture doth witnesse of Moses, of Iosua, of Gedeon, of Ioseph, of Sampson, of Dauid, of Ezekias, and of Iosias. But what domination soeuer diligent Lordes haue and doe obteine, yet is it not without contradiction, as expe∣rience doeth shew it. Yet it is not to say, but that God is true in his promises (as we must esteeme it) & what diligence soeuer they take in doing of their duetie, yet is it neuer such, but that therin is much to be amended. And for this cause, there are no Lords but do wel deserue to meete with much contradiction. Yet it is not to say, that God doeth not performe his promise, so farre as is expedient, and that it is not necessarie that Lordes should punishe their gain saiers. It belongeth not vnto subiectes to withstand that which is wel or∣deined: though they which ordeine them, be not such as they ought Rom. 13. 4. to be. And though it should so be, that in doing their dutie perfect∣ly, the Lordes shoulde haue contradiction: neuertheles wee must in no wise doubt of this promise: for God faileth not to accomplish 1. Pet. 2. 18 it, so farre as he knoweth to be expedient, though we see it not al∣wayes. And as the Princes that are careful and diligent, doe beare rule: euen so euerie one of vs, according to his estate, shal rule, if he labour to folow his vocation. But contrarily as saith Solomon, The idle hand shalbe vnder tribute. They that are negligēt to giue their duetie, must needes bee slaues and as captiues, subiect to ransomes, Impostes and Subsides: as experience sheweth it. 25 Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it. When a man daily worketh, and that it seemeth to him that hee busieth himselfe in vaine, or that hee receiueth not so great profite as he desireth, complayningly he saith gladly, that he is so wery with labouring, that he groweth crooked therewith: signifying thereby that he is not without care and sorowe, and is not contented with the profite that God sendeth him daily, because hee feareth to dye for hunger, and (by a kinde of speech) feareth lest the earth wil faile him. Thus speaking, he sheweth wel, that hee woulde not willingly be crooked, & that it is a thing verie noisome. If we wil auoid such trouble, & not to waxe crooked, we must giue ourselues euery one of vs to folowe our state without heauinesse. For as Solomon saith,
Heauinesse in the heart of man doeth bring him downe. When man taketh care excessiuely, and without measure, with great acti∣uitie, he setteth his heart in a miserable state, he doeth depriue it of al ioy and delight, of al peace and quietnes, as if hee fel vnderneath his burden, without being able to rise againe. Solomon here doth not labour to turne man away from his daily labour, according as is meete for his vocation: otherwise hee shoulde contrarie him∣selfe: for hee sayeth, Goe slouthful to the Emmet, and marke his wayes, &c. An idle hande maketh poore, &c. Hee that tilleth his grounde, shalbe filled with bread. But hee laboureth to roote out 1. Tim. 6. 10. of our heartes the roote of al euil, which is couetousnes, the which whilest some haue desired, they haue erred from the Fayth, and haue intangled themselues with many sorows. Amongst other sorowes, couetousnes causeth the heart of man to be loaden with heauinesse, the which is so heauie a burthen, that it bringeth him down, so that all his thoughtes and desires are vpon the goods of the earth, and can not aspire vp vnto heauen, where Iesus Christ woulde haue vs to laye vp our treasure. For to folow wel these exhortations of our Mat. 6. 20. Hebr. 13. 5 Lorde, wee must aske our daily bread, and to bee contented there∣with. Let your conuersation be without couetousnes. If in steede to yeeld vnto this holie exhortation we vexe ourselues, & do distrust the helpe of God, it is a true argument that the word of God doeth not liue in our hearts: as also Solomon doth signifie it presently, set∣ting a good word against heauines, & ioy vnto crookednes: saying, But a good word reioyceth it. For to put away heauinesse from the heart, Solomon sendeth vs to heare the preaching of the word of God, and not flatteries and sweete wordes of men, the which, albe∣it that for a litle tyme they seeme to recreate and reioyce man, and doe deliuer him from heauinesse, yet the same is of no conti∣nuance: but the ioye that commeth of mens words, doth quickly vanish away, and so is not true, as also their wordes are not truely good. For as there is none but God that is good, euen so also there is nothing but his only word good, and that giueth true and conti∣nuall Psal. 19. 9. ioye to the heart. Now as we cal a thing good, when it doeth nothing hurt, but doeth profite, and chiefly when it serueth our necessarie vses: euen so, Solomon calleth the worde of the Lorde good, because that it doeth nothing hurt the children of God,
though it doeth rebuke them, chide, threaten and feare them, ma∣king them to feele the horriblenes and heauines of their sinnes, and doeth set before them the iudgement of God, wherupon commeth to them great sorow, when they see themselues so poore and so mi∣serable. For albeit that they are greatly sorowful, yet is the same so farre of, that the worde which leadeth them vnto this sorowfulnes, doeth hurt them, that rather it is healthful for them. For though I made you sorowful by mine Epistle, yet doe I not repent me, &c. . Cor. 7. 8. because ye sorowed vnto repentance. If then we receiue the word in feare, it shal not hurt vs, but greatly profite vs: not for one time onely, but for euer. And sith that the children of the world do re∣ioyce at a temporal profite, by a stronger reason the worde of the Lorde ought to giue occasion vnto the faithful for to reioyce, when the same bringeth them vnto eternal life, that euery one of vs may say with Dauid, I haue delighted in thy lawe. Also, Thy testimonies haue bene my delight, &c. It commeth not from ourselues that we Psal. 114. 14 24. haue this delight, and therefore the Psalmist prayeth, Lorde teache me the way of thy statutes. Although then that the couetous doe Psal. 119. 33. often walke with a stiffe necke, and that they seeme to be ioyful, yet haue they a crooked heart, and haue no true reioycing. Euen so, if we wil be deliuered from heauines, and obteine ioye, wee must re∣ceiue the lawe which doeth aduertise vs of our sinne, for to repent therefore: and we must cleaue fast vnto the promises, and stay ourselues thereupon, for to assure vs of the remission of our sinnes and of eternal life. 26 The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them. Whilest we are in this world, albeit that God doeth giue vs this grace that we conforme not ourselues vnto the world, neither are of the worlde, yet must we dwel with them which are of the world, and think them our neighbours, euen though we know that they are nothing worth. Solomon doeth somewhat signifie it, when he saith, The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour. But when he speaketh thus, his chiefe in tent is, not to make vs to vnderstande the same, but to turne vs away from the prosperitie of the wicked.
For Solomon doth set himself against the common opinion of men which iudge them excellent, that haue their scope and course in a∣bundance Psal. 37. 1 of riches, and great credite, and that take their ease and pleasures in this life. For by this that they doe their businesse wel, and bring their purposes and enterprises to passe, the worlde estee∣meth them excellent personages. Contrarily, Solomon doeth heere pronounce, that albeit the righteous seemeth to bee a man of no∣thing, woful and vnprofitable, yet that he is excellent, by this, that whatsoeuer doth happen to him, he goeth not out of the right way. He setteth the excellencie of the righteous in his patience and con∣stancie: as he doeth shewe it, when he saith consequently: But the way of the wicked wil deceiue them. Heere the way of the wicked is taken for that which they are, and doeth happen vnto them: for not knowing themselues, and seeing their prosperitie, credite, and power, they make themselues beleeue that al things are lawful for them: and therefore they liue in al dissolution. They forsake the way of saluation, and take the broad way which leadeth to destruc∣tion. Mat. 7. 13. And that we shoulde not goe astray, wee are warned for to enter by the straight gate. If then wee wil finde excellencie, let vs not staye ourselues with the great number, nor with them that are most esteemed after the worlde, but let vs conuert with the small number and most contemned. Nowe the righteous in this point is saide to be excellent, for the giftes and graces of God, by the which he is ledde and gouerned so wel that he erreth not, but keepeth the right way of saluation and eternal life. That we must so vnderstand it, Solomon doeth shewe it vs, when against excellent he setteth the way that leadeth to errour. For because that the wicked are voide of al gifts, as they deserue, they can not wel guide themselues, what∣soeuer they haue, or that happeneth them, but al thinges are a stum∣bling blocke vnto them, an hinderance, ouerthrow, and destruction: as Solomon doeth giue it wel to vnderstande, when he saieth, that the way of the wicked maketh them erre. And it hath alwayes bin that this hath befal them. The wicked are strangers frō the wombe: euen from the bellie haue they erred, and speake lies. And albeit Psal. 58. 3. that the wicked deserue to walke in errour, yet it is not to say, that the iust can deserue to bee excellent: for, as it hath bene al∣readie
saide, hee is esteemed excellent, not for any thing he hath of himselfe: for al giftes come from the pure liberalitie of God. Solo∣mon Ioh. 3. 27. & 15. 4. 5. 1. Cor. 4. 7. Iam. 1. 17. also doeth signifie it, when hee doeth not attribute to man that hee is excellent. True it is, that man in his first creation was made excellent, when hee was created and formed vnto the image and likenesse of God: but hee lost his excellencie by transgressing of God his commaundement, and by the inuentions that followed thereupon. I considered in mine heart the state of the children of men, that God had purged them: yet to see too, they are in them∣selues as beastes. God made man right, but they sought many in∣ue Eccle. 3. 18 & 7. 30. ntions. Also, as is saide, Solomon doeth not attribute vnto man that hee is excellent, but to the righteous: hee saieth not Man is ex∣cellent: but the righteous is more excellent, &c. In this sort he attributeth excellencie vnto man, inasmuch as hee is iust: the which hee is not in himselfe, but in Iesus Christ. Let vs note besides this, that Solomon doeth not pretend to attribute vn∣to the wicked any excellencie, though hee say more excellent: but hee speaketh also for to repugne and gainsay the opinion of the worlde, which reiecteth, disdaineth, and persecuteth the righteous: as Saint Paule doeth describe it in his person, Truely I thinke, that God hath set foorth vs the last Apostles, as men appointed to death: 1. Cor. 1. 30. 2. Cor. 3. 21. for wee are made a gazing stocke vnto the worlde, and to the An∣gels, & to men. And contrarily, the world hath the wicked in won∣derment, reuerencing and honouring them. And this is as much as if hee did say, If I graunt vnto you that they which yee esteeme, haue some excellencie, yet I woulde haue you to vnderstande, that it is as nothing in comparison of the excellencie of the iust, whom 1. Cor. 4. 9. yee abhorre. And thus a man might well say, that Solomon spea∣keth as it were by Concession. Moreouer, let vs note, that the faithful and iust that are counted before God of great excellencie, are heere admonished not to communicate in any wise with the fil∣thines 2. Cor. 6. 14. of the wicked: as also Saint Paul doeth exhort them. 27 The deceitful man rosteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.
Solomon doeth exhorte vs by this sentence vnto care and dili∣gence, that we shoulde not suffer that to be lost which we possesse, but knowing that it is God which giueth vs that that we haue, bee it litle or much, that we shoulde make great account thereof, & to preserue the same for to vse when wee haue neede. Now for to in∣duce vs theretoo, and to turne vs from slouthfulnes, he compareth the slouthful vnto an hunter: but not in al things. For the slouthful Pro. 6. 9. sleepeth, and maketh no account to occupie himselfe in labour and trauaile, as Solomon hath reprooued him else where: contrariwise the hunter is watchful and with great care and diligence hee consi∣dereth the meanes whereby hee may come vnto the ende to take some peece of flesh: hee pitcheth his toyles and his nets, hee trim∣meth his pitfals, hee goeth and runneth vp and downe according as hee seeth needful to pursue the pray, that it may not escape from him. But it happeneth that the hunter which is vndiscreete and ta∣keth no heede, after he hath taken the veneson, knoweth not howe to trimme and dresse it, for to preserue it from corruption, that hee may make thereof his profit. And in this sort it is that Solomon compareth the slouthful vnto the hunter: as hee doeth shewe it, when he doth say, The slouthfull man rosteth not that he tooke in hunting. Hee calleth the hunting of the slouthful not that which he hath got by his labour and trauaile: for the slouthful refuseth to la∣bour: as it is but too much prooued, and Solomon hath already shewed it & wil shew it heereafter: but the hunting of the slouth∣ful are the goods that are come to him by the labour of other, the which he possesseth by right of succession, or by gifte, or by theft, polling and briberie. Forasmuch as the slouthful wil not occupie himselfe for to get his liuing by honest labour, and that hee ca∣reth not to busie himselfe about good woorkes, hee is often com∣pelled to rauish the goods of his neighbours: and albeit that to do the same, he watcheth and taketh great paines, yet ceaseth not hee to be slouthful: for that which hee doeth, is done for nothing else, but to auoide the labour that God hath appointed, & to enioye the pleasures of the body with the hurt & hinderance of his neighbors. Such slouthful are the most dangerous after the outward apparance, & also after the iudgement of the flesh but their bellies, whereof S.
Paule speaketh, are yet worse: for liuing ydlely and slouthfully, they doe not only rauishe the temporal goods, and doe not onely kil the Rom. 16. 18. Phi. 3. 19. Tit. 1. 10. body: but in so much as in them lyeth they pul away the soules from God, and giue them to bee deuoured of the Deuil: of the which number are the Pope and al his, whome a man may wel curse, after the example of Iesus Christ, Wo be to you, ye Scribes & Pharisees Mat. 23. 13. hypocrites: for yee shut vp the kingdome of heauen before men: for neither yee yourselues enter in, nor suffer them that woulde to enter therein. Al such people shal not roste that they toke on hun∣ting: they take no profit of that which they haue gotten by gaine & dishonestie: for either they spende the same vnprofitably, or it is ta∣ken from them, or else they are compelled to leaue the same with∣out hauing any vse thereof. This same is proued, and we haue some Luke. 12. 20. & 15. 13. & 16. 23. Ephe. 4. 28. 2. Thess. 3. 7. examples thereof. Nowe that wee may not bee of the number of such people, let vs folowe the counsel of Saint Paule, let him that stole, steale no more: and also, so much as wee possibly can, folowe his example. Thus dooing, we shal not loose that which we tooke in hunting, for want of rosting: but that which wee haue taken we shal keepe it diligently, and shal holde it deere and precious, as So∣lomon doth signifie it saying, But the riches of the diligent man are precious. It seemeth wel vnto the couetous and vsurers which take greate paine to gather treasures in this world, that they holde their riches for very preci∣ous, when they dare not vse their treasures for feare to diminish them: and then it seemeth that in thus dooing, they keepe and pre∣serue them wel, and make no smal account of them. But sith God hath created al things that they shoulde bee occupied for the vse of man, wee shoulde knowe that then our riches are precious vnto vs, when wee make them serue according as God hath ordeined them. For so doing, we suffer them not to goe to losse, but do keepe them togither. Wee shoulde esteeme a thing wel kept, when it is applyed where it ought to be, and that it serueth and profiteth. They then that are almose giuers & charitable, haue their riches precious: for they doe wel bestowe it and put it foorth to good profit, Giue, and Luke. 6. 38. 1. Tim. 6. 17. it shalbe giuen to you: Commande them that are rich in this world, that they bee not high minded.
28 Lyfe is in the way of righteousnes: and in that pathway there is no death. Forasmuch as there is none but desireth to liue, & to flye death, except it be for great sorow that he suffereth, hee doe desire death, not preferring and choosing it before life, but for the afflictions that he beareth: and except hee were vnpatient, and did dispaire to bee exempted from such sorowes in this world, he would desire life, and abhorre death, as indeed he doth: for being in his straights, he thin∣keth himself to be in a death more hard thē if his soule were sepa∣rated frō his body. That we may obteine our desires, we must know where life is founde without the danger of death: Solomon doeth teach vs it, when he saith, Life is in the way of righteousnes, &c. When any man hath neede to make a voyage, and vnderstandeth that the high way is dangerous, for theeues and robbers that watch who come by, he wil not take that way if hee may auoide it by any meanes, but seketh some path that wil bring him to the place where he would bee: and so he liueth and auoideth death, whereof he had bene in danger if he had passed by the high way. Wee are Pilgrimes Hebr. 13. 14 in this world. For wee haue heere no continual dwelling Citie, &c. In folowing then the Faith of Abraham and of other holie Patri∣arkes, dwelling in this world, we shal walke as strangers, looking for Hebr. 11. 10 the Citie, that hath a sure foundation. So doing, God wil not be a∣shamed to be called our God. For to accomplishe this voyage, and to come to this Citie, wee must take good heede from taking the Mat. 7. 13. high way, for it leadeth to damnation, because it is ful of theeues, robbers, and filchers, which seeke for nothing but our destruction: As our lustes, the worlde, and the Deuil doe draw vs, and lay baites 1. Pet. 4. 3 Ioh. 3. 3. 1. Cor. 6. 9 Rom. 6. 23 Gal. 5. 21. Mat. 7. 13. Hebr. 12. 1 1. Pro. 2. 1 for vs, that delighting in the pleasures of the heathen, that knowe not God, we should walke dishonestly. So doing, we can not finde life. The reward of sinne, is death: but wee must seeke for a straight pathe that may leade vs vnto life. And for to runne wel therein, let vs laye away al that presseth vs downe, and putting away al malice, let vs abstaine from carnal lustes, which fight against the soule. If we thus walke, we shal finde life; for that way is the path of righteous∣nes, wherein, as Solomon saith, is life, and no death therein. When
Solomon tooke his doctrine from the lawe, whereunto it is lawfull for no man to adde, or diminish, we must vnderstande that he spea∣keth Deut. 4. & 5. & 8. 2. Cor. 1. 20, heere of eternal life chiefly. For albeit that God by Moyses gaue vnto the children of Israel, promises concerning this temporal life (as neuertheles seeing that God doeth esteeme none but his children, whom he hath erected to eternal life, worthie of his promises, for al his promises are yea and Amen in Christ) wee must vnderstand, that in these temporal and earthly promises are enclosed the heauenly and spiritual: as the Fa∣thers Hebr. 11. 9. 10▪ 13. Leu. 18. 5. Rom. 10. 5. did wel vnderstande, and also Moyses doeth signifie the same, saying, The which if a man shal doe, he shal liue in them: the which Saint Paule expoundeth of eternal life. Then when Solomon saith, Life is in the way, &c. Let vs vnderstand it of the blessed and eter∣nal lyfe: as he himselfe declareth it, saying, And in that path way there is no death. For temporal life is not without death, as experi∣ence teacheth alwayes, and the Scripture witnesseth vnto vs: I say vnto you brethren, that fleshe and blood can not inherite the king∣dome 1. Cor. 15. 50. Hebr. 9. 29 of God. Men are appointed once to dye. Wee must also take death heere, for eternal death: as doeth our Lord Iesus, Verely, ve∣rely, I say vnto you, that he which heareth my word, is passed from death vnto life. If any man keepe my worde, he shal not see death. Ioh. 5. 24. & 8. 51. 11. 25. Whosoeuer beleeueth in me though hee were dead, yet shal he liue. If then wee wil liue without death, let vs walke in the path of righ∣teousnes, as wee are taught by the Scriptures aforesaide. The which shalbe done, if hauing the assured hope of our saluation in the righ∣teousnes of our Lord, we giue ourselues to liue after his comman∣dements conteined in his lawe. There is no death. For albe∣it the righteous are the most that are slaine, yet they dye not, but doe passe from death vnto lyfe.
The xiii, Chapter. 1 A wise sonne wil obey the instruction of his father: but a scorner wil heare no rebuke. FOrasmuch as instruction consisteth in commandemēts, counsels, exhortati∣ons, corrections and reprehensions, wherof the rude, simple and ignorant haue neede, and not they that are in∣dewed with so much wisdom as they neede, & ought to haue: and liue ac∣cording thereto before the world, and walke so wisely that they are without reprehension, & haue no need that a∣ny man should shew them any thing: Wee vnderstand not by the wise Sonne, a man hauing wisdome premeditated (for suche a man hath no need that his father should shewe him, either reprooue or correct him) but by a wise sonne we wil vnderstand him that hum∣bleth himselfe vnto his father, feareth and reuerenceth him, wil re∣ceiue doctrine, and endeuoureth to serue him, and to be at his com∣mandement. This sonne is wise, though ther be in him many things which require either admonitions, exhortations, or corrections. Al∣beit then that wee haue many imperfections, yet doe wee not cease therfore to be called wise by the Scriptures, which lie not, so that we confessing ourselues to be such as wee are, doe become easie to bee Rom 13. 7. Ephe. 4. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13 taught & tractable, and endeuour to yeeld subiection & obedience, feare & honour to them that wee ought, folowing the counsel of S. Paul, Giue vnto euery man that which is due to him, &c. So doing, we shalbe wise sonnes, and wil take instruction of them to whome we are committed, and to whom we owe honour & obedience. As then we see, Solomon calleth children & inferiours vnto wisdō, that the youth & the common people should not take licence to remain in ignorance, as though wisdome did nothing belong to them. For gladly such people are wont to say, that they need not to be so wise, & they think that wisdō is not necessary for thē, but for men in au∣thority & dignitie. He doth also exhort thē to receiue instruction of the father: vnder the which name of father, let vs vnderstād al such as
we owe obedience and honour vnto: but as they make no account of wisedome, euen so doe suche people commonly hate instruction, though it be necessary for them. It is too common a vice, that things most necessarie are most despised in the world: there is almost none but feareth to be either too wise or too honest: wherin they are like to children: who according as they are borne of fleshe, doe loue that which is not good for them. Now though we must be like vnto litle children: yet when we are here called to be wise, and to receiue in∣struction, Mat. 18. 3 let vs folow the admonition of S. Paul, Brethren, in vnder∣standing be not children: but in malice let vs be children; Take heed 1. Cor. 14. 20 Ephe. 5. 15 1. Pet. 2. 1 therefore that ye walke circumspectly, &c: putting away al malice, &c. If we make no count of such instructions, we are not wise: but scorners, as Solomon doth shew vs, saying, But a scorner wil heare no rebukes. Wisdom hath complained here aboue, (Chaper. 1. verse 22.) and for their refusal, hath threatened them afterwardes, verse, 24. By this sentence & other alreadie alledged, & Chap. 9. verse, 7. 8. we may vnderstand that scorners are proude, wicked, corrupted, harde∣ned, & vncorrigible. Such people labour to make themselues beleeue Esai. 28. 15 that what euil soeuer doth happen, they shalbe exempted. And ther∣fore they scorne al reprehension. It is not to say that they are assu∣red for their conscience, in spight of their teeth wil reprooue them: whereupon they are feared with the iudgement of God. They shew thēselues verie bold, as if they were in great assurance: but the wic∣ked are as the raging of the sea, &c. There is no peace to the wicked, saieth God. Besides this, let vs note first of al, that scorners haue Esai. 57. 20 eares, but they heare not: they are of the number of them of whom Esai speaketh, Goe & say to this people, heare and vnderstande not, see and know not, &c. The number of them is verie great, as wee Esai. 6. 9 may gather by the similitude of the seed. Secondly, that they which haue charge of others, ought to be vigilāt & careful to giue instruc∣tion, euery one after his state and vocation: and for to do the same wel, they themselues ought to be lerned. We must first be schollers, before we become maisters. They then which neuer made account and esteemed instruction, are not capable nor meete to haue autho∣ritie ouer others. 2 A man shal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the soule of the trespassers shal suffer violence.
It is saide, you shal bring your burnt offeringes, &c. Thou shalt pay thy tenth. &c. Euē so we see that the Lord sought no pro∣fite Deut. 12. 6. & 14. 22. in the Sacrifices, neither ordeined them for to take his pleasure in them: but hee woulde that the people shoulde be refreshed, and reioyced therewith. Nowe Solomon knowing that suche sacrifices were not the principal thinges that God required, as wee may see by the scripture: knowing (I say) the same, and willing to induce vs Psalm. 50. 8. & 51. 18. Esa. 1. 11. Ose. 14. 3. Pro. 1. 31. to offer the true sacrifices, hee maketh an allusion vnto the olde sa∣crifices. & doth shew vs, that if we sacrifice truly, we shal haue pro∣fite with ioy: when he saith, A man shall eate &c. As here be∣fore by eating, hee hath threatened the wicked, and hath foretolde them their ouerthrowe, saying, Wherefore they shall eate. &c. E∣nen so nowe by eating, hee promiseth prosperitie to the good which vse their mouth wel, in sacrificing alwaies praises vnto God: that is to say, the fruite of the lippes, which confesse his name. If then wee wil prosper and haue ioy of our prosperitie, let vs bring forth good fruite out of our mouthes: if we speake, let vs speake as the words Heb. 13. 15. Ephe. 4. 29. & 5. 3. 18. of God, let no corrupt cōmunication proceed out of your mouths. &c. Let no fornication, nor any filthinesse be once named amongest you. &c. Nowe as the ouerthrowe of the wicked shal euer in∣dure, euen so the prosperitie that Solomon promiseth now, is of no smal continance, but shal last for euer. This prosperitie shal come vn∣to them that shal rightly vse their mouthes, and also which shal oc∣cupie all the other members of their body in wel doing, as wee are admonished, I beseech yee then brethren, &c. For though Solo∣mon Rom. 12. 1. doeth make no mention but of the fruite of the mouth, yet he excludeth not the other members, neither reiecteth the good fruite that commeth from them: but vnder the goodnesse that commeth from the mouth, hee comprehendeth the same of the other mem∣bers, 2. Cor. 5. . the which if wee vse wel, wee shall eate the fruite. For we must al appeare before the iudgment seate of Christ, that euery man may receiue the things that hee hath doone in his owne body. Let vs fo∣lowe that which is saide, Bee not deceiued: that which a man hath sowne, that shal hee also reape. &c. If any man shall aske why So∣lomon did rather name the mouth then any other member, we may Cal. 6. 7. answere him, that it is because hee signifieth the prosperitie of the good and faithful by eating, the which is proper to the mouth: for
the mouth is the organe by the which the nourishment is sent vn∣to al the body, and by the mouth are executed al the most excellent workes which concerne the glory and honour of God, as is to sing the prayses of God. If againe it bee demaunded, why hee signifieth the blessed life, rather by eating, then by gold, siluer, and other ri∣ches: I answere, That he maketh an allusion vnto the olde sacrifices, of the which they did eate that offered them. And also, sith that the fruition of the heauenly glory, and of eternal life is our chiefe felicitie, and the greatest ioy that wee can haue or desire: Solomon hath signified it wel and accordingly by eating: and that for to yeelde vnto our rudenesse and infirmitie: seeing that the greatest goodnesse that wee can bodidy haue, standeth in eating: for with∣out it, wee perishe, though wee haue neuer so much prouision of o∣ther riches. What riches soeuer we haue, yet are we miserable con∣cerning the body, except wee eate when necessitie requireth. Our Lorde doeth somewhat signifie, that to eate is the most necessary profite that doeth belong to the body, when in teaching vs for to aske the necessary foode of this present life, hee doeth admonish vs, Mat. 6. 11 that wee shoulde aske our dayly bread. But that it is so, that Solo∣mon making mention of the mouth doeth not exclude the other members, he himselfe doth shew i, when against a fruiteful mouth, hee setteth the soule or person of the trespasser: and against good things, setteth violence: saying, But the soule of the trespasser shal suffer violence: that is to say that the trespassers shalbee punished for the violence doone to God and to their neighbours. Now vio∣lence doeth not onely consist in outagious wordes, but also in al workes that are doone to any mans hurte or hinderance. Conside∣ring then the Antithesis, we may knowe that Solomon vnder∣neath the mouth, compriseth all the other members. But when the soule of the trespasser is set against the mouth, wee maye something gather that the wicked are more earnest too doe euill then the good are to do good: but the earnestnesse they haue, is as if they had deuoured some deadly poyson: for by the violence that they labour to doe vnto God and to their neighbours, they shalbee fedde therewith in eternall death. Besides this, let vs note as amongest the most excellent mouthes, are they whiche
faithfully preache the worde, vnto the honour of GOD and pro∣fite of his Churche: euen so amongst the trespassers, the worst are they that vnder colour of holinesse and religion doe so we false do∣ctrine: whereof Popery is full. And thus the greatest trespasse lyeth in the tongue: as Solomon doeth somewhat signifie, setting the soule of the trespasser against the mouth. Let vs note also that wee must not trust to the good deedes of other men, as doe the poore Papists which trust in the merits of hee saints, & shee saints or in the suffrages of the Churche: and in the meane while to care nothing to put the hande into the pye. Solomon doeth not say that we that we shal eate the good fruit of the mouth of our neigh∣bours. That which our neighbours shall haue done, shall nothing profite vs, if wee haue beene vnfruitefull: The Lorde wil giue to euery one according to his workes: and as Solomon saith, Euery man shall eate the good fruite of his mouth. Neuerthelesse, a they that are diligent to gather the fruite of any tree, doe eate of the same: euen so if wee be careful to heare the holy worde by the mouth of the ministers thereof, wee shal eate the fruite of the same. Likewise if wee participate with the trespasses of the wicked, we shal (as they doe) suffer violence, &c. 3 Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, destruction shalbe to him. There are two principal wayes of keeping the mouth, and con∣sequently of keeping the soule and life: and both of them are very necessary, The one is, to keepe sobernesse and temperancie in eating and drinking. They which haue no knowledge of GOD, doe so iudge: for they say, Of sober life, cōmeth long life. They iudge so by a naturall light without the Scripture: the which besides the saide light, doeth lighten vs, by admonitions and exhortations, by repre∣hentions and threatenings. If we receiue these admonitions, and that wee tremble at his threatninges, wee shall keepe our soules Esay. 5. 11. & 22. 12. 56. 10 Luke. 21▪ 34. Rom. 13. 13. 1. Pet. 4. 2. 3. not onely for a time in this worlde, but also for eternall life. The other manner of keepyng the mouth, is too bee carefull in following the thirde and fourth commandements of the lawe. Thus doeing, wee shall keepe our soules: for none wyll
pursue vs to death, but vniustly: and so wee shall liue first of all in this worlde, so farre as shalbe expedient for our spiritual saluation: afterwardes hel shal haue no power ouer vs, for to swallow vs: but the Lorde wil deliuer vs by his great mercy alone, and not that wee can deserue it. For albeit it is saide that wee keepe our soules, yet must wee attribute nothing, but vnto the grace and vertue of the holy Ghost which is giuen vnto vs: and for this cause that which he doeth in vs, is called ours. Let vs then confesse that the keeping of the mouth, and consequently the keeping of the soule, is the gifte of the holy Ghost: and let vs not thinke that Dauid doth attribute any thing to himselfe, when hee saith, I wil take heede to my waies. &c. Hee doeth shewe it well, when hee saith, Set a watche, O Psal. 39. 2 &. 114. 3. Lorde, before my mouth: and keepe the doore of my lippes. Be∣holde two kindes of keeping our mouthes, the which are very harde for man to doe: for wee haue bellies that cannot bee filled, because they bee vnsatiable, as are those of gluttons and drunkardes, which eate and drinke tyl they burst, and if they haue any thing too thrust into their mouthes, they begin alwayes afreshe: or els they are de∣licate, desiring daintie meate, and sweete drinkes: as are gluttons and licorous fellowes, that haue none other care but to seeke where good wine is, and sweete morsels. Nowe the mouthes of such bel∣lies doe serue them to their appetites if they haue any thing to fur∣nishe the same. Thus much for the first manner. As touching the second, it is no lesse hard. For in our mouth there is a little member which is the tongue, but it is a fire, euen a worlde of iniquitie. &c. The worlde is filled with such tongues: whereof Dauid complai∣neth, Iam. 3. 6. Psal. 12. 2. & 34. 14. Helpe mee, O Lorde, for there is not one goodly man left. &c. They talke of vanitie euery one with his neighbour. &c. It fol∣loweth thē that the number of thē which keepe their soules, is very smal. If we desire to be of this nūber, let vs obey the admonitiō, Keep thy tongue from euil, and thy lippes that they speake no guile. It is of this kinde of keeping our mouth that Solomon speaketh heere, as he himselfe doth giue it to vnderstande, setting rashe speaking & opening of the lippes, against keeping of the mouth: and oppression against keeping of the soule: saying, but he that openeth his lippes. &c. Heere the lyars, periurers, false witnesses, and suche wicked men doe see what rewarde they are worthy of, not only in this life,
but also after this life. For as they which keepe their mouthes, doe keepe their soules, not onely for a time, but also for euer: euen so the wicked and the vngodly lippes ought too bee punished in this Leui. 24. 14. Deut. 19. 16 worlde. The history also of Susanna doth witnesse it. And if in time they come not to repentance, let them looke for eternal death. For the Lorde wil not holde him giltlesse, that taketh his name in vaine. The slaunderers shal not inherite the kingdome of God. Kinges, Princes, and Superiours of the earth may learne a lesson whereof they make no account, they haue their honour and excel∣lencie 1. Cor. 6. 10. in most high commendations: for they can wel tel howe to punishe them greuously which shall speake against them, and do easily let passe the iniuries that are spoken and doone against God, not doing any punishmente therefore, or pay little. So doing they shewe thereby that they are puft vp with excessiue pride, and with a diuelishe arrogancie: for they doe preferre themselues be∣fore God, and doe iudge themselues more worthie, and more excel∣lent then hee: but finally, God shal finde them out wel enough, and shal wel mainteine his honour in punishing them, as they deserue: euen as they are threatened therewith. Diuers greate Lordes haue well prooued, and shal feele that GOD resisteth Psal. 2. 4. &. 82. 6. the proude. 4 The sluggarde lusteth, but his soule hath naught: but the soule of the diligent shall haue plentie. There are iesters and idle bodies, who making no account of gi∣uing themselues vnto good and necessary workes, doe giue them∣selues to followe foolishe and vnprofitable desires and pleasures: and yet for to seeme pleasant & mery, they are not ashamed to pro∣nounce that they woulde not giue their pleasures for a great summe of money. Such folke are muche vnprouided and voide of good sense and sounde idgment, when against their conscience and af∣fection, they reiect by worde that which God hath created for the vse of men, and contrarily doe esteeme and prayse that whiche God hath forbidden in the tenth commandement of his lawe, Thou shalt not lust. In this manner, they doe more esteeme their fanta∣sies, which doe nothing profite, then the liuing God, who giueth vs
all thinges aboundantly for to vse. For this cause they wel de∣serue for to bee brought into extreeme and vtter necessitie, and to haue nothing wherewith to mainteine themselues in this life, but to bee in continual and miserable sorowe al the time that they haue to dwell in this worlde. Solomon doth threaten thē with such misery, saying, The sluggarde lusteth, &c. Hee hath already diuers times vsed the like threates. It is a thing very infamous and reprochable, for to liue in idlenesse, as wee doe iudge al naturally. For albeit that naturally wee loue wel to doe nothing, and that after the fleshe wee Pro. 6. 50. 11 &. 10. 4. & 12. 27. thinke thē happy that haue wherewithal to liue without doing a∣ny thing, yet if wee haue men seruants or maide seruants, or iour∣ney men for to doe our businesse, except they labour diligently, wee wil not looke cheerefully vpon them, they vexe and greeue vs, and wee cannot bee pleased with them: and that is chiefly because wee loue our profite, and doe feare to bee hindered: but heerewith wee haue an agreement that man doeth naturally detest slouthfulnesse. But it is not so much, neither so as wee ought. For we do not abhor it in our owne persons, but so far as we feare to die for hunger, or to become poore and beggers. Solomon doth somthing signifie this feare by the worde of lusting: and when he doth threaten that this feare shal come vpon vs, if we be slouthful, when he saith, But his soule hath naught, The slouthful are heere threatened with po∣uertie and bodily want, & temporal scarcitie, the which is very hard to beare: but yet it is nothing in comparison of the spiritual hūger, wherewith foloweth the depriuation of eternal riches, wherewithal the slouthful shalbe takē, which haue nothing esteemed the threate∣ninges of Solomon, and chiefly they that haue made no account of gathering the spiritual seede of the word, which is the foode of life. To them also chiefly do the threatenings belong, and vpon them are they put in execution, not onely in this life, but more miserably in the other. For if God doe not esteeme them worthy of this present life, and the riches thereof, much lesse will hee counte them worthy of eternal riches. And so the soule of the slouthful which make none account of their duetie, shal haue naught: for it shalbee depriued of temporal riches, and of eternall and heauenly. It is not then with∣out cause that Solomon laboureth so often to awake vp the slouth∣ful by such threatenings, whē he seeth them in so great danger. The
care that Solomon hath so often to threaten the slouthful, shal pro∣fite them that amend, and shal make the vnrepentant more vnexcu∣sable. Now that such threates should not be executed against vs, let vs take heede to turne away from slouthfulnesse, and to occupie our¦selues diligently in labour, euery man according to his vocation. So doing, our soule shal want nothing, but wee shal haue such aboun∣dance of riches, that we shalbe contented. Solomon doeth promise vs it, saying, but the soule of the diligent. &c. As heeretofore hee hath promised, that hee might print it so muche the more in∣to our wits, and for to confirme it more vnto vs, and to make vs more certaine of the goodnesse and liberalitie of God towardes vs: and that being so assured, wee may bee more enclined to giue our¦selues vnto labour according to our vocation, & after as we vnder∣stande to be his wil. Wee wil therefore giue ourselues vnto labour, according as God hath ordeyned it by his worde, and as it hath bin handeled here before, and wil diligently doe our worke, not by de∣sire of enriching ourselues, and keepe backe to ourselues what God sendeth vs, without making our poore brethren and members par∣takers thereof with vs. This is not the wayes to abounde and in∣crease in riches, nor to make our soules fatte, as Solomon doeth shewe it. If wee obey vnto his admonitions, our soules shall not Pro. 11. 24. 25. 2. Cor. 9. 6. Gal. 6. 9. 1. Tim. 6. 17. onely haue worldly and temporal plentie, but also after this life, they shal fully enioy heauenly and eternal riches. For the Lorde doeth not promise vnto his faithful people earthly riches in this life, for to forsake them afterwardes, and to suffer them miserably to pe∣rishe. &c. 5 A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked causeth slander and shame. If we wil be certaine in our consciences that wee bee righteous, and also to giue true witnesse of our wisedome and honestie before men, that they may bee edified, and that we be no offence to them, so much as we can, we must abhorre lying: as Solomon doth shew vs, saying, But the iust man hateth lying wordes. There is none of vs, but hateth to heare lying, and chiefly when lying bringeth vs any hurt, either to our body, to our goods, or to our name. Such ha∣tred doth not proceed of feare that wee haue to sinne, but of feare
that wee haue to suffer losse: and therefore suche hatred cannot make vs certaine, nor our neighbours, that wee be honest men: but therein for to haue and to giue a certentie, that wee are honest men, wee must hate ourselues, in asmuch as we are enclining natu∣rally to lying, according as the Scripture witnesseth it: saying, That euery man is a lyar: & as we of our nature do lye, euen so also are wee ready to beleeue lying, and loue to heare lyes, so that we thinke Psal. 116. 11 therein is no hurte nor hinderance: we delight to heare ourselues praised, and wel spoken of, and to be flattered in slaundering, and in euil reporting of our neighbours, whome wee hate. Nowe as in two sortes wee loue lying, and heereby haue a witnesse that we are wic∣ked and vngodly, and also for to haue a certaintie: that wee are righteous and honest men, we must hate the wordes of lying after twoo sortes, so that wee shoulde feare to pronounce it with our mouth, and to receiue it with our eares. Albeit that al faythfull and true Christians shoulde be thus disposed and affectioned to fo∣low the third & nienth commandement. For for obseruing of them well, wee must not onely beware to abuse the name of God, and to lye against our neighbours, but wee also ought to procure that none should abuse this holie Name, neither speake euil of his neigh∣bours. But, I say, that this same belongeth vntoo al Christi∣ans, yet chiefly vnto the Ministers of the worde to pronounce trueth, and to abhorre the declaring of lyes: and to the Magistrates and Iudges not to receiue false accusation. So doing, the Ministers shal not seduce the people by false doctrines, as doe the Friers and Exo. 23. 1. hypocrites: neither wil the Iudges pronounce wicked sentences. But sith that the Scripture doeth attribute righteousnes vnto them that hate the worde of lying, wee must inferre thereupon, that the number of the righteous is verie smal, and almost none. For it is saide, Helpe Lorde. For there is not one godly man left: for the Psal. 12. 1 faithful are nourished from among the children of men. We con∣clude also, that wee can not be iust, except wee doe violence to our nature, which is enclined to think and to speake lyes. If we let loose the bridle vnto our tongue, according as it is drawne and driuen by the natural inclination of man, wee shal winne nothing to thinke ourselues iust, and to pronounce that we are honest men. Solomon
by the spirite of trueth doeth pronounce vs to be wicked: when he saith, But the wicked deuiseth slaunder. &c. This is not to say, that wee must not accuse them which leade a wicked life. Besides this, let vs note first of al, albeit that though one feeleth himselfe to bee slaundered, hee wil make so great a matter of it, as to thinke it laweful for him to smite and kil him that hath diffamed him, not∣withstanding the greatest parte of the worlde doeth not esteeme it to be any great offence to slaunder their neigbours: experience al∣so doeth shew it, when the worlde alwaies hath beene and styll re∣maineth ful of lying, flatterers, detractours, & false witnesses, which haue laboured and still do labour to slaunder the good & righteous chiefly, as haue Ioseph, Moses, Dauid, the Prophets, Iesus Christ, and his Apostles beene, and nowe the poore faithful ones doe feele it. Heere may bee seene that the iudgment of the worldlinges and carnal, is first of al corrupted, in this, that they iudge the slandering of their neighbours so lite and smal a matter: and if they be slaun∣dered, they counte themselues so greatly offended, that they think it to bee lawefull for them too kil them that haue missesaide and backebitten them. Afterwardes they are filled with crueltie, when they slaunder the iust and innocent. Secondly, let vs note, sithe that they which missereporte their neighbours that are but dust and shes, are pronounced wicked: by a more strong reason they that slaunder GOD so farre as they can, are to bee esteemed most wic∣ked: but when wee cause men to make amendes for the disho∣nour they haue doone to their neighbours, and not to GOD, they wel shewe that they honor more the creature then the Creator. Thirdly, let vs note that in this present sentence we ought to behold the promise of life enclosed, for the faithful which hate lying, and speake trueth, sith that righteousnesse is attributed vnto them. Con∣trarily, that the missereporters are threatened with death, sith they are called wicked. And so when we loue life, and abhorre death, we are heere exhorted to loue trueth, and to mainteine the same, to hate slaunderinges and diffaminges, and to procure the honour of our neighbors. 6 Righteousnesse preserueth the vpright of life: but wicked∣nesse ouerthroweth the sinner.
Wee al desire naturally to auoide hurt, and danger, and to bee in safetie, and to keepe ourselues wel: but most commonly wee knowe not howe, and by what meanes to preserue ourselues: as wee may knowe it, seeing that many doe ouerthrowe and destroy themselues, willing to saue themselues. Nowe that wee may not bee of this number, and that wee knowe howe to preserue vs, Solo∣mon doeth teache vs, when hee saith, Righteousnesse preserueth, &c. Heere hee teacheth vs no newe thing that we haue not seene. But besides that which is there handeled, wee must note first of all, Pr. 11. 4. 5. 6 Eccle. 7. 21. 1. Iohn. 1. 8. that as our righteousnesse is in this worlde neuer without sinne, e∣uen so wee are neuer so perfect, but that wee may still growe: for during this life, howe right a path soeuer wee keepe, yet can it not bee right vnto perfection. Otherwise, wee should not neede to aske Leade mee, O Lord, in thy righteousnesse: make me to knowe thy Psal. 5. 9. & 25. 4. &. 25. 11. wayes, O Lord: Teache mee thy way, O Lorde. The perfection that God requireth of vs in this worlde is neuer such, but that ther∣in may alwaies bee founde some thing to bee amended: neuerthe∣lesse when wee walke in soundnesse of conscience, and with a free hearte, without dissembling and hypocrisie, in that hee commandeth by his worde, imperfection is not imputed vnto vs. And this is the cause wherefore the Scripture calleth vs vpright and perfect: and also wee are so, sith that God accepteth vs for such. The Monkes & Nunnes amōg the Papists do proudely brag of the state of perfectiō, which hath bin brought out of the diuels shop, the which giueth thē to vnderstande that they are not like other, and that in this estate they deserue not onely for themselues, but also for them, that com∣mend themselues to their prayers, & do good vnto their couēt. They resemble the Pharisee, but not in al things: for the same gaue almes, and fasted, but these heere deuoure, so that they deserue the curse. Secondly, Let vs note that if we wil bee wel preserued, it suf∣ficeth not to haue some beginning of religion, of holy conuersatiō Luke. 18. 11 Mat. 23. 14. and righteousnesse, but wee must continewe, and aspire vnto per∣fectiō without being weary. Whosoeuer shal connew to the end, shalbe saued. And that we might learne to perseuer, & come to per∣fectiō, the Lord hath set an order in his Church, to the which we Ephe. 4. 11. Col. 1. 25. 2. Tim. 3. 16. must all obey. In following this order, S. Paul speaking of the Church saith, Of whō I am a Minister. &c. Al Scripture diuinely in∣spired,
is profitable for doctrine. But what order soeuer wee holde in the Churche, it is not in vs to make vs perfect: this is the worke Phi. 5. 1. 6. & 2. 13. 1. Pet. 5. 10. Phil. 2. 12. of God. Holding for certaine that hee which hath begunne a good worke in vs, wil finishe the same: it is God that worketh in you both the wil and the deede. For this cause Saint Peter prayeth. But the God of all grace make you perfect. And albeit that this is the worke of GOD, yet it is not to say, that wee must bee negligent but careful for to aspire vnto this perfection, in following S. Paul, Occupie yourselues about your saluation. &c. And hee giueth Phil. 3. 12. an example to pursue and goe forwarde, when hee saith, not as though I had already atteined to it, eyther were alreadie perfect: but I folowe, &c. But for to come wel to the ende of this same, wee must haue loue which is the bonde of perfection. If wee doe not Collo. 3. 14. thus proceede, wee cannot bee preserued: for we are void of righte∣ousnes, of faithfulnesse, of integritie, and of sound goodnes, where∣in standeth the perfection of ioy, and there is in vs nothing but wic∣kednesse, frowardnesse, and vnfaithfulnesse, which leade men to de∣struction and perdition. Thirdly, let vs note that albeit wee sinne continually, and without ceassing, and that wee must aske pardon for our sinnes, confessing ourselues guiltie of death and eternal damnation because of our sinnes: yet if it displease vs to haue of∣fended, and with true affection giue ourselues to wel doing, the Scripture calleth vs not sinners, for to condemne vs to destruction for our wickednesse: but doeth cal vs saintes, righteous, innocent, because that God for our faith and repentance doeth accept vs for suche, not imputing vnto vs our faultes. Wherefore when the Apostataes and transgressours, (for to lessen their sins wherof they are reproued) doe say that wee are al sinners, comprehending both good & euil, they lye falsly, and doe belie God and his scripture, and doe iniurie to the faithful, setting them in the ranke of them which for their sinnes and wickednesse doe goe into destruction. When they speake thus, they condemne them that GOD absolueth by his worde. 7 There is that maketh himselfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himselfe poore, hauing greate riches.
Wee al come of one father, and of one mother, wee are al one fleshe and one blood, and haue al our affections which tende to our profite: yet haue wee not al like affections, but diuers, and which haue diuers effects, according as it seemeth vnto euery one that hee ought to proceede for to make his profite, or to get honour, and to bee in reputation. For example of diuersitie, or contrarietie of af∣fections and effectes, Solomon saith, There is that maketh him∣selfe riche. &c. Heere Solomon doeth declare vnto vs that there are some which are poore, so that they haue nothing, yet doe they bragge to bee riche, tending by suche dissimulation to get credite, and authoritie, honour and reputation, and by such meanes to finde men that wil lende them, and trust them with their goods. So doe∣ing, they are theeues and robbers, offending God and their neigh∣bours. Contrarily, there are some which possesse great riches, and for feare they haue that men wil aske of gift, or to borrow (so cruel and churlishe are they, hauing no pitie nor compassion of the nee∣dy) doe hyde their riches, and faine themselues poore. These same are little better then the other: for, asmuch as in them lyeth, they hunger starue the poore, and cut their throtes. Heerein Solomon doth declare vs the abuses of the worlde, that wee may learne that wee must not frame ourselues like therevnto, and that wee should take good heed least such deceiuers doe beguile vs. Neuerthelesse it is lawful for vs, yea necessary, to make ourselues riche, where wee are poore, not in heaping vp great treasures vpon earth, as doe the Mat. 6. 19 20. Luke. 12. 15. &. 16. 9. Psal. 37. 16. miserable and woeful couetous (for our Lorde doeth forbid it vs) but laying vp our treasures in heauen, as wee are commaunded. For if wee haue any thing to distribute, wee wil not ceasse to become riche, if wee haue contentation, though wee haue but a little. For a smal thing that the righteous hath, is better then great riches of the vngodly. Wherefore let vs obey the Apostle, Let your conuersa∣tion bee without couetousnesse. In this sort we shalbe as poore, and yet making many riche. Also, When wee are rich, it is lawful for vs, yea necessary to make ourselues poore: not for feare to lende Heb. 13. 5. 2. Cor. 6. 10. Luke. 12. 15. or to giue: but wee must followe the saying of our maister Christ, make you freendes of wicked mammon. &c. It remaineth that they which buy, be as though they possessed
not. Hee exhorteth vs to followe the readinesse and willingnesse of the Macedon Churches, Commaunde the riche. &c. If in follo∣wing 1. Cor. 7. 31. 2. Cor. 8. 7. Tim. 6. 17. the opinion of some, wee wil vnderstande that Solomon by the first parte of this sentence speaketh of them that haue greate a∣boundance of riches, and yet gouerne themselues so euil that they become poore and needy, and sone indetted, there shalbee no in∣conuenience. For wee see many of them which hauing aboun∣dance of riches, do not ceasse therefore to owe much, and that not through excesse or greate superfluous expenses, but their riches doe not prosper with them because that God doth not powre foorth his blessing vpon them, the which onely maketh riche. Contrarily, there are some which haue nothing or very litle, but because that through Pro. 10. . the blessing of God they rule themselues wel, they haue enough and contentation: according as Saint Paule saith, Truely godlines is great gaine, if a man bee contented with that hee hath. Suche 1. Tim. 6. 6. riches are muche more better then the more aboundant, the which are possessed without confessing the blessing of God. To the ende then that for all our pouertie, wee may bee rich, and haue no neede, let vs confesse that the blessing of God is necessary for vs: and ther∣fore let vs aske of him, that hee woulde giue vs this day our dayly bread. And let vs beleeue that it is he onely that gouerneth vs, and giueth vs al things for to vse. For then the giftes of God shalbee profitable vnto vs, and wee shal vse them rightly, and to our cōmo∣ditie and felicitie, when wee shalbe assured by faith that it is God who gouerneth al things, & that we shal aske and loke for al things that we haue neede of, of him. 8 A man will giue his riches for the ransome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche. When wee heare Solomon speake thus, let vs take good heede from blaspheming as doe the Papistes, which say that we must satis∣fie Math. 5. 14, 16. for our sinnes, and winne Paradise by our almes giuen too the poore, and by distribution of our goods vnto the Churches and co∣uentes for to bee partakers with their suffrages and prayers, with this goodly diuine seruice and with the workes of super erogation of Priests and Monks. It is too horrible a blasphemie, by the which
the Papistes doe deny the power and vertue of Christe his death  passion, and asmuch as in them lyeth doe abolishe the same: and no thanke to them that al the worlde is not damned eternally, seeing that there is no saluation in any other. &c. It seemeth wel at the Actes. 4. 12. first sight that Solomon woulde leade men to trust in their riches, & by a kind of speache, to make them their God and Sauiour. But let vs know that Solomon, neuer thought vpon any such matter: for the holy Ghost by whome hee hath spoken, doeth not contrary and say against himselfe. Nowe he attributeth vnto God the ransome of life, but God wil redeeme my soule, O Lorde God forasmuche as wee haue gotten this blessing, neither by our power, wisedome, Psal. 49. 15. &. 130. 3. dignitie, nor riches, but by the meanes of the shedding of the preci∣ous blood of our Lord Iesus Christ. Euē as the sonne of man came not to bee serued. &c. But Christ being come an high Priest of good Mrt. 20. 28. He. 9. 11. 12. thinges to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with handes, that is, not of this building, neither by the blood of Goates and Calues: but by his owne blood entered he in once vn∣to the holy place, and obteined eternall redemption for vs. Kno∣wing that yee were not redeemed with corruptible thinges, as sil∣uer 1. Pe. 1. 18. 19. and golde, from your vaine conuersation receiued by the tradi∣tions of the Fathers: but with the precious blood of Christ. For God so loued the worlde, that hee hath giuen his onely begotten Iohn. 3. 16. sonne, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him should not perish, &c. In this appeared the loue of God towardes vs, &c. Of this raunsome and deliuerance wee are made partakers by faith. Let vs then 1. Iohn. 4. 9. 10 Iohn. 3. 16. & 5. 24. Rom. 3. 24. 25. 1. Pet. 1. 5. 21. knowe and learne that Solomon doeth not heere speake of this raunsome, whereby the soules of the faithful are eternally redee∣med: but hee meaneth that if a man be taken in any misdeede that deserueth corporal punishment, or that hee seeth himselfe in the hands of his enimies, that desireth nothing but his death, hee will not spare his goods, if hee thinke that by them hee may escape and saue his life. That Solomon meaneth so, he himselfe doeth shewe, when against this, hee saith, But the poore cannot heare the reproche. Because, that in what danger soeuer hee is, or what threatening soeuer that is made him, hee cannot redeeme himselfe for want of riches: it is saide, That hee heareth not the
reproch. Hee answereth not vnto the desires of them which haue him in their power, that doe watch and chide him. Theeues and robbers doe chiefly seeke after other mens purses, and for the most part the iudges of the earth are like vnto them: for they wil pardon greate theeues, and hang vp the smal. And thus wee may knowe that by their threateninges and reproches they say, bring, and yee shalbe absolued, & ye shal redeeme your life: they that haue wher∣with, doe heare reproche, but the poore which haue nothing, can∣not obey. Let vs also then vnderstand that Solomon teacheth not the riche that they shoulde deliuer themselues by their riches from the punishment that they haue deserued for their misdoinges. Hee also teacheth not the poore to be rebels, neither to despise correctiō: but hee declareth vnto vs what often happeneth in this worlde. If any man wil vnderstande that the riche are ransomed, and that the poore do feare no exaction of them, there is no inconuenience. And heereof wee may learne that the poore which are contented and take their pouertie and lowe estate patiently, are in greater quietnes thā the rich which feele much more care & pensiuenesse to heape ri∣ches together, and to keepe them: they are most what in feare of them, and in danger of their liues, except the theeues and robbers doe see that they can otherwaies come by them. But againe, seeing that the riche worldlings and carnal men haue their hope and trust in their riches, therefore it is a great heauinesse and trouble to be in feare of ransoming and robbing. Nowe for to auoide such sorow and heauinesse, Let vs folowe this sentence, Put not not your trust in oppression, nor in robbery. Psal. 62. 10. Mat. 6. 19. 2 Luke. 12. 15. &c. After these worldly troubles, they which shal not haue obeied to these admonitions, shal haue eternal sorow. Luke. 6. 16. & 1. Tim. 6. Iames. 5. 9 The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked shalbe put out. When our Lord Iesus Christ saith, yee are the light of the Math. 5. 14. 16. worlde: and after doeth admonishe, Let your light so shine be∣fore men, &c. Hee first taketh the light for them to whome the
charge is committed to teache the people, not onely priuately, but chiefly publikely. Secondly, for the care and diligence of teaching and by wholesome doctrine, and by honest and good conuersation. Suche light ought to reioyce their hearts to whome it is giuen: as Esay doth shewe, How beautiful are the feete of them which bring tidinges of peace? Againe, O yee desolate places of Ierusalem bee Esay. 52. 7. 9 glad and reioyce together, &c. Also our Lorde doeth shewe it, when hee saith, That you may glorifie your Father which is in hea∣uen. For if wee glorifie God, it is with ioy and gladnesse, neither can it bee otherwayes doone. Such light doth not much reioyce the worlde, because it is giuen to wickednesse. Nowe this is condem∣nation, Iohn. 3. 19. that light is come into the worlde, and men loued darkenesse more then light. This remaineth not onely where Popery is, but is also cōmon there where the Gospel is preached. But albeit that whatsoeuer is saide, conteineth trueth, and serueth to edification: yet neuertheles, it is not in this sense that Solomō speaketh of light. The natural sense of this place is, that Solomon speaketh of the ease, prosperitie, and felicitie both of the righteous and wicked. Then when Solomon saith, The light of the righteous reioyceth, &c. wee wil take it after that sorte, as wee tooke that the citie reioyced for the prosperite of the iust. Solomon then would say that the peo∣ple is blessed, and that they ought wel to reioyce, amongst the which Pro. 11. 10. honest men haue no griefe nor trouble, but are in ioy, rest and pro∣sperite. The holy Scripture doeth often vse to shine, to ligh∣ten, brightnesse and light in this sense, as contrarily a man can∣not long reioyce with ease, prosperitie and glory amongest the wic∣ked, seeing they fall into destruction, Solomon doeth nowe signifie Psal. 13. 4. &. 34. 6. & 36. 9. vnto vs this destruction, when hee saith, that the lampe of the wic∣ked shall bee put out. Wherein wee must note that as by the light, the scripture signifieth ioy, glory, ease and prosperitie: euen so by darkenesse it signifieth the contrary. Let vs then knowe that though Esay. 30. 26. &. 60. 1. Pro. 1. 34. 32 &. 2. 22. & 4. 19. &. 10. 25. 27 28. 30. the wicked haue their ease, that they prosper & triumph, yet that al shalbee turned into misery, calamitie and destruction: and therfore that we haue no greate cause of ioy, when we see the glory of the wicked in this worlde, no more then a candle is put out in a most darke night, or that the Sunne doeth loose his light at high
noone tide. Moreouer let vs note, that if the Kings and Princes of the earth wil shewe themselues righteous as they ought, they must Psal. 35. 6. Esay. 13. 9. 10. &. 60. 2. Eze. 32. 7. 8. Ioel. 2. 2. 10. 31. & 3. 15. Psal. 20. & 21. in their triumph and prosperitie, labour to make their subiects glad, in mainteining good pollicie, not committing any exactions for to serue their desires and lustes, but to folowe what is taught them by Moyses, the Prophetes and Apostles: and chiefly for to reioyce the poore faithful. For wicked and dissolute persons reioyce not at good order, but when thinges are in confusion. They loue to sinne in troubled water. And as such is the duetie of Kings and Princes, so likewise ought subiects to reioyce, when their Lords do prosper: & ought to sing with their heart. Finally when he saith, But the candle of the wicked, &c. Let vs learne that we are taught, how we ought not to flatter the wicked, howe high soeuer they be, and what pro∣speritie soeuer they haue, nor enuie their wealth and felicitie. O∣therwise our Candle should be put out. For they which consent to Rom. 1. 31. euil, are worthie of death, &c. 10 Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduised, is wisedome. It seemeth to ourselues that we are of so good a nature, that we desire nothing more then to gouerne vs wisely, in peace, vnitie, and concord one with an other: and doe iudge it great foolishnesse to doe otherwise. But so long as we suffer ourselues to be ruled af∣ter our owne nature, it can not be but there must needes bee strife and debate: and chiefly when things are not done after our desire. For we are so proud, and we think ourselues to be so wise, that we would haue al things to come to passe, and be done after our fansie. If the contrarie happen, according as we think we haue credit, pow∣er and authoritie, we are readie to drawe out our sword, or els to braule and rayle, or els to consume ourselues by lawe: if this proud and arrogant estimation that we haue of ourselues, were cast farre from vs into obliuion and forgetfulnes, and that we did walk in hu∣militie and true wisdome, no strife should be raysed amongst vs. So∣lomon doeth signifie it, saying, Onely by pride. And forasmuche as by pride is mooued contention (the which proceedeth of hatred and for want of loue) it followeth that pride doeth beget hate and
enuiousnes, and thereby is loue quenched. Through pride Cain be∣came Gen. 4. 5. 8. angrie with his brother Abel because hee pleased God: and thereby forgetting the loue that hee ought vnto his brother, hee conceiued a deadly hatred against him: wherevpon hee mooueth contention, and killeth him. Let vs know therefore, that al proud, hateful and contentious persons, are the seede of Caine: and as the true faithful which folowe the humilitie, the softnesse and loue of Christ are called Christians, and are so indeede: euen so the proud doe deserue to be called Cainists, as they are. And therefore as God resisted Caine, cursing and reiecting him: euen so doeth hee resist the proude. I haue saide to the foolishe, bee not so foolish: and 1. Pet. 5. 4 Psal. 75. 5. Luk. 1. 51. to the wicked, set not vp your horne, &c. But God is Iudge, &c. And the virgin Marie sayeth, Hee hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hartes. Therefore as wee abhorre Caine, let vs also not become Cainistes, lest wee bee reiected of God: let vs forsake al pride, hatred, contentions, and debates, walking in hu∣militie, loue, vnitie, concorde and peace. Euen so dooing wee shal not be of the stocke of Caine, but the true children of God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shalbe called the children of God. Let Mat. 5. 9. Ephe. 5. 1. Phil. 2. 1. vs be folowers of God. For to shewe ourselues rightly suche, let vs folowe Saint Paule. For to turne ourselues from pride as it behooueth, and shun contention, for to walk in true humilitie, & to liue in peace according as the scriptures before alledged doe teache vs, we must not become blockish & beastly, neither foolish & voide of vnderstanding, but we must be wel aduised and indued with wis∣dome. Solomon doeth shewe it, when against that which hee hath said he addeth, But with the wel aduised there is wisedome. The proude do iudge & thinke thēselues to be wise ynough & therfore they would that al things should be done after their wil & fantasie, and they wil the sooner contend, as things are not done according as they ymagine, wherein they shewe themselues to want wisedome, and doe declare their furious and madde follie, when they are ea∣sie to beginne contention and stirre vp strife. But they which suf∣fer themselues to bee counselled, and doe delight to folowe good counsel, are iudued with wisdome, whereby they are gouerned vn∣to humilitie, and thereby do they fly contentions & debate, seeking
nothing but peace, friendship and concord with al men, so much as they possibly can, without offending God. This humblenes ought Rom. 12. 18 to be folowed of al men, hauing one minde towards one an other, &c. Notwithstanding this is not to say, but that euerie man by good aduisement and wisedome ought to labour for to hold fast the degree where to hee hath bene called and appointed of God, yet without vnbrideled lust, and without affection to rule, but so farre as is expedient for to doe his duetie well. It is not without cause that wee make mention of the calling and appointment of God, and that we cast away the vnbrideled desire and affection to rule. For first of al, it is not lawful for vs to take in hande to maintaine our¦selues in any degree, except the Lorde hath called vs theretoo, and if our estate be not according to his wil, the which is declared vnto vs by his worde. Saint Paule doeth wel shewe it. Therefore when the Pope and his Clergie haue no calling of God, it rightly folow∣eth, 1. Cor. 7. 20 Ephe. 4. 1. that they foolishly and proudly doe proceede to mainteine their degrees: the fruites whereof are seene: that is, that the king∣dome of the Pope is filled with contention and brawlings, as expe∣rience declareth. The Monks seeme to thēselues to be very humble, Col. 2. 18. and yet they walke in pride. Likewise are their conuents ful of enuy, iniuries, contentions, and debates: One order and sort of Monkes against an other, for to mainteine their Lordship and high dignitie. Secondly, the Kings of the earth for to satisfie their greedie desire, and excessiue affection to rule, doe set the world in trouble through warres and shedding of blood. 11 The riches of vanitie shal diminish: but hee that gathe∣reth with the hand, shal increase them. Albeit, that Solomons intent is not here to teach vs howe wee may heape vp great riches together, yet wee shal not want, but shal abound in wealth, we if wil beleeue him. Hee saith first of al, That the riches of vanitie, &c. By the which hee laboureth to turne vs away from prodigalitie, the which hee calleth vani∣tie, and that rightly: for hee that spendeth his goods more excessiuely then hee ought, doeth followe vanitie: seeyng
that such expences doth nothing profit either his bodie or his soule: as it is easie to be knowne, and the prodigal doe also feele it. For if the prodigal for his owne pleasure doeth commit excesse, his minde thereby is corrupted and made beastly, and his bodie made more heauie and more subiect to sicknesse: and consequently, more neere vnto corruption. Moreouer, howe honourable soeuer the prodigal is, if he spend excessiuely, the same shal nothing profit him, as Solo∣mon doth wel signifie the same, saying, That riches shal diminishe. The prodigal Sonne spoken of in Luke hath prooued it to be true: Luk. 15. 13 and nowe also the gluttons and drunkards, the daintie and sugred mouthes doe also feele it. But albeit that vanitie doeth signifie pro∣digalitie, yet is it not to say, that it is an incōuenient thing to stretch vanitie further, and to take it for alwayes and meanes by the which a man commeth vnto pouertie, as are slouthfulnesse and idlenesse, and also couetousnesse. And if vanitie which doeth diminish tem∣poral riches, ought to be auoided, much more ought the same to be Pro. 6. 6. & 10. 3. & 13. 4 fled that doeth depriue vs of the heauenly inheritance, which is e∣uerlasting. Therefore wee must be careful to flye away from all that that may hinder vs from receiuing of the Gospel, which is the pow∣er of God to saue vs, and maketh vs inheritours and possessours of the heauenly and eternal riches. Secondly, for to shewe vs howe we shal abounde in wealth, hee saieth, But he that gathereth with the hand, &c. Here he exhor∣teth vs to worke, and doeth promise vs that wee increase if wee wil labour, and get our bread by good, profitable, and necessarie works, the which hee meaneth by the hande: as wee may vnderstande it, when hee setteth the hande against vanitie. Solomon hath made vs the like promises heere before. Thus we learne, that by flying of Pro. 12. 11. & 13. 4. vanitie, and doing some woorthie and excellent worke, it is lawful to gather riches together: but we must take heede we set not our heartes vppon them, otherwise, it shal not be togather with the hande, but with vanitie: for it is great vanitie for a man to occupie himself with greedinesse and couetousnesse. As Dauid saith, Doubt∣lesse man walketh in a vaine shadowe, and disquieteth himselfe in Psal. 39. 6. vaine: hee heapeth vp riches, and can not tel who shal gather them. Againe, I turned, and sawe vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is not onely vanitie in suche labouring, but also great crueltie: for they Eccle. 4. 7.
which gather couetously, care least to doe wrong vnto their neigh∣bours, and also through hunger, to starue and kil them. For this cause are they called in the Scriptures theeues, robbers, and mur∣therers: Esai. 1. 59. Amos. 8. and it is layde to their charge, that their handes are full of blood. 12 The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the desire commeth, it is as a tree of life. When Solomon saith, The hope that is deferred, &c. hee doeth shewe vs thereby that we haue great neede of patience, and chiefly in looking for the eternal riches. For by howe muche as the riches are more precious and more excellent, by so muche are men more vexed, whē they are long kept frō the possession of that which is longed for and desired. The worldlinges doe prooue this in their temporal riches: and the faithful doe feele it in the heauenly and eternal riches. Saint Paule giueth witnesse thereto, and not on∣ly Rom. 8. 23. the creature, but wee also which haue the first fruites of the Spi∣rite, euen wee doe sigh in ourselues, waiting for the adoption, euen the redemption of our bodie. Againe, For wee know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle bee destroyed, wee haue building 2. Cor. 5. 1. giuen of God, that is, an house not made with handes, but eternal in the heauens. Abraham felt this languishing, as hee doeth shewe vs, when a certayne time after that God had promised him, I wil make thee growe into a great people, hee complayneth, saying, O Lorde God euerlasting, what wilt thou giue me? Seeing I go child∣lesse. Gen. 12. 2. & 15. 2. Dauid also declareth this his longing, in the 42. Psalme, say∣ing, As the Hart brayeth for the riuers of water, so panteth my soule after thee, O God. The Saintes therefore in looking for Psal. 42. 2. that which they hope for, doe languishe and fainte, but so soone as they obteine their desires, they waxe ioyful and are satisfied. Solomon doeth signifie the same, saying, But when the desire commeth, &c. Dauid also doeth expresse it, saying, I wayted pa∣tiently for the Lorde, and hee enclined vnto mee, and heard me. It is saide of Simeon, That hee wayted for the consolation of Is∣rael,
and the holie Ghost was vpon him. And when hee had recei∣ued his desire, hee prayseth God, and reioyceth, and is satisfied: as Psal. 40. 1. Luk. 2. 25. 29. hee sheweth by his Canticle. Nowe as the holie Fathers in their lan∣guishing were neuer vnpatient, so must wee doe the like, folowing that which the Prophet Abacuk saieth, For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the last, it shal speake and not lye: though it Haba. 2. 3. Hebr. 10. 36. tarie, waite: for it shal surely come, and shal not stay. Again, Ye haue neede of patience, that after yee haue done the wil of God, ye might receiue the promise. 13 Hee that despiseth the worde, shalbee destroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, shalbee re∣warded. Wee must not doubt that Solomon doeth not speake here of the worde and commaundement of God, the which speaketh to the world after diuers sortes, as hee hath diuers Ministers and seruants. He speaketh to the peoples and nations by his Apostles, Euangelists, Pastors and Doctors, which in the name of Iesus Christ doe preach fayth and repentance, according to the holie Scriptures. He speaketh by Kinges, Princes, and Lordes of the earth, when by holie lawes, statutes and ordinances, they labour to guide their subiectes in iu∣stice, and to cause them to liue peaceably and in true and holie reli∣gion. Hee speaketh when fathers and mothers doe teach good man∣ners vnto their children. Hee speaketh also when euery man parti∣cularly doeth admonish or reprooue his neighbour when it is need∣ful. Finally, he speaketh, when we labour through honest and holie conuersation to edifie our neighbours. Whosoeuer doeth despise the worde, after what sort soeuer God speaketh, shalbee destroyed, first temporally (as many haue tried it, and doe daily feele it.) Se∣condly, if there bee no repentance, there foloweth eternal destructi∣on. The holie Scripture doeth shewe vs many examples therof, and also it is replenished with threateninges against the contemners, whereof wee presently haue one, when Solomon sayeth, Hee shal-be destroyed, &c. The first Chapter hath the like threateninges. Pro. 1. 24
Contrarily, if wee gladly heare that which is saide vnto vs in the name of God, and by his authoritie, & that with true zeale of heart we endeuour to obey it, wee shalbe mainteined in good estate, and shal not perishe. Salomon doeth here pronounce it, saying: But hee that feareth the commaundement, shalbe rewarded. Wherin let vs first note, that he saith not simply, he that feareth. For albeit that the contemners are affrayde by the accusation of their consciences, and that they tremble and feare, when the worde and commandement is preached vnto them, yet they cease not to pe∣rishe: for they feare not the commandement wherein is promised rewarde, but they feare the paines and torments. Therefore if we Deut. 4. 10 & 10. 12. desire to be rewarded, let vs feare, not the paine, but the commaun∣dement, forsaking euil, and applying ourselues willingly vnto good∣nesse: because the commandement is holie, iust, and good. This is the feare that our God demandeth, Gather the people together vn∣to mee, &c. that they may feare me. And nowe Israel, what doeth the Lorde thy God aske of thee, but onely that thou shouldest feare him? They that shal haue this feare, shalbee rewarded with euerla∣sting blessednes, which is a rewarde not of merite, but of grace and liberal goodnesse. Secondarily, let vs note, that if wee wil vnder∣stande this sentence of the sayings of Kings and Princes, they ought to learne heere, that their office is to roote out the wicked, and to set good men at rest: for we may also expounde the last woorde of this sentence by, To obteine peace. Mat. 24. 25. Thirdly, let vs note, that the worde, Worde, after the Hebrewe phrase, doeth signifie a thing: and after this signification, wee may say, that hee shalbe destroyed, which despiseth the thing that is committed vnto him. 14 The instruction of a wise man, is as the wel spring of life, to turne away from the snares of death.
As the man which fainteth for want of drinke, if hee meete with a fountaine of water, and drinke thereof, doeth slake his thirst, and is so quickened, that hee is out of danger to dye by thirst: euen so when wee haue Lords and gouernous which do their due∣tie in politike gouernement: when fathers and mothers are carefull of their families as behoueth: and when the Pastours of the church doe employe themselues diligently vnto wholesome doctrine: then haue wee wise men, whose admonitions, counselles and corrections if wee receiue, then doe wee drinke of the fountaine of liuing water, the which wil preserue vs from death, and wil quic∣ken vs, when by such instructions the holy Ghost woorketh in vs, sanctifying and making vs obedient by faith and repentance. For without the working of the holie Ghost, instruction is dead, and is deadly to them to whom it is offered, when they doe not willingly receiue it. Solomon doeth exhort vs to drinke of this spring and fountaine, when hee sayeth, The instruction of a wise man, &c. For to drinke rightly of this fountaine, let vs resort thither whither Esay calleth vs, saying, Al yee that bee a thirst, come to the wa∣ters. Esai. 55. 1. Therefore, for to receiue well the instruction of the wise, and to be refreshed, and to auoyde the snares of death, wee must come vnto Iesus Christ, that hee may make vs partakers of the gra∣ces and giftes of his Spirite, teaching vs by the doctrine of his Go∣spel. For as wee are corporally nourished with bread, wine, milke, and water: euen so ought wee to vnderstande, that our soules are susteyned with the doctrine of the Gospel, with the holie Ghost, and other giftes of Iesus Christ: and are so nourished and sustay∣ned therewith, that wee shal neuer neede any thing. If thou knew∣est Ioh. 4. 10. & 7. 37. the gift of God, &c. Againe, whosoeuer drinketh of this wa∣ter, &c. If any man thirst, let him come to mee, and drinke, &c. Ouer and besides this, let vs note first of al, that they which take vpon them to instruct others, shoulde bee wise, that no man may reprooue or blame them, Thou which teachest an other, teachest thou not thy selfe? And they must be wise, not as Turkes and Pa∣pists, Rom. 2. 21. which thinke themselues verie wise, when they are verie dili∣gent to publishe humane doctrines and diuellishe traditions, by the which they seduce the heartes of the simple, and so doe drawe them to death, and doe not quenche the thirst of the people, with
the spring of life: they are not administratours of the waters of this liuely spring, but they leade the people to a forsaking of the liuing God, which is the fountaine of liuing water: but they must folowe the wisedome of Moyses, of the Prophetes and Apostles, of good iudges and kings, which haue ministred this liuely wa∣ter. Secondly, let vs note, that where there are no wise men, there is no spring of life, but al are snared in the nettes of death. Whereupon wee may vnderstande, howe greate the miserie is wherein the Turkes and Papistes are: and to consider, howe much more miserable are they which haue wise men, and do despise them. They are more miserable then they of Sodom and Gomorrha. Mat. 10. 1 Thirdly, let vs note, seeing that the scripture doeth attribute snares vnto death, that it is not in our power to deliuer ourselues from death, no more then it is in the power of a litle byrde to escape the net, when he is entangled therein. Let vs not boast ourselues ther∣fore of our free wil, as if thereby wee had the power to saue our¦selues. But when wee drinke of this spring of life, that wee taste and digest it, let vs knowe that it commeth because that our Lord Iesus 1. Cor. 15. 55 Psal. 124. 7. Ephe. 2. Titus. 3. Christ hath broken the bandes of death. And therefore, let vs con∣fesse this grace, and say, Our soule is escaped as a byrde out of the snare of the fouler. &c. 15 Good vnderstanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the disobedient is hated. When Solomon speaketh thus, it is not to say that there is any euil vnderstanding: but hee so speaketh to distinguishe it from the same that the worlde esteemeth so much, the which is but foo∣lishnesse before God, and consequently before them which are in∣dued with the spirite of the Lorde. This hee doeth also for to make vs to loue it, and to induce vs to seeke it, seeing that naturally wee loue that which is good. Therefore when Solomon saieth, Good vnderstanding, &c. It is asmuch as if hee did say, Take heede yee order not your manners after the custome of them which thinke that they haue vnderstanding before the worlde. It doeth nothing profite, but to puffe vp men, and to cause them to dispise their
neighbours, and often to become angrie & enuious. But giue your¦selues vnto good wisedome and vnderstanding which wil not swel nor contemne other: it maketh the man of vnderstanding, accep∣table vnto his neighbours, whome hee by his wisedome doth admo∣nishe and comfort, administring vnto them the helpes of saluation, Beholde howe good vnderstanding getteth fauour, aswel to him that possesseth it, as also to the neighbours which are holpen there∣by either spiritually, or corporally. Both of these may bee seene in Ioseph and in Moyses. And to the ende that wee shoulde knowe howe wee ought to gouerne vs after good vnderstanding, Solomon doeth teache vs rightly wherein it consisteth, to wit, in faythfulnesse, vprightnesse and trueth, in gentlenesse, easinesse and softnesse. Wee may vnderstande this same by the Antithesis, when hee saith, But the way of the disobedient is hated. Against, good vnder∣standing, hee setteth, the way of the vnfaythful: and against grace or acceptation hee setteth heere sharpenes or hatred. Whereupon wee may gather, what is ment by good vnderstanding and that they which are indued therewith, ought to be acceptable vnto their neighbours, seeing that they become tractable, and are at their commaundement in what soeuer they can, as God willeth. Let vs also note that the vnfaithful and disobedient can hardly counter∣faite, for to bee founde honestmen, and in the meane time to worke the destruction of their neighbours. And they which haue to doe with them, doe finde them harde, vngentle, stiffe, and cruel: and so their way is harde and hated both to them, and to their neighbours, which doe knowe their hypocrisie, dissimulation, and fayning: albeit that they seeme to bee gentle, soft and gracious to the simple and vndiscreete, and to their lyke. As contrarily the men of vnderstanding which are soft and gracious to thē which loue wisedome, doe seeme hated, harde and sharpe vnto mockars and contemners. 16 Euery wise man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will spread abrode follie. Wee haue seene before, that the cratie or subtil man, doeth Prou. 12. 23.
hyde knowledge, whereuppon it foloweth, that hee is indued with knowledge: and as hee is indewed therewith, so doeth hee also go∣uerne himselfe thereby. Solomon doeth signifie this guyding & go∣uernement, when he saith, Euery wise man wil woorke by knowledge. This knowledge is not the same, whereof Saint Paule speaketh, knowledge puffeth 1. Cor. 8. 1. Esay. 11. 9. vp: but the same whereof Esay speaketh which wil not hurte: for the earth shalbee full of the knowledge of the Lorde, as the waters that couer the sea. Whereunto wee are exhorted by Saint Peter: 2. Pet. 5. 5. Ioyne moreouervertue with your fayth: and with vertue, know∣ledge, &c. Solomon doeth wel shewe vs that hee speaketh of such knowledge, when hee saith, But a foole wil spread abrode follie. The foolishe are depriued of this knowledge: and therefore hee sheweth his follie, proceeding in his affryres rashly, without consi∣dering whither he doe wrong to his neighbours or no: it is ynough for him to bee seene and praysed, and to gaine something if it bee posible: neither doeth hee care to bee beloued, nor yet to loue his neighbours, but is ready rather to fight against them, if hee thinke that they hinder him to come to the ende of his enterprises. Heere∣by wee may know that there are very fewe wise men in the world, and that it is filled with the foolishe, not with such as the world∣linges and carnal men doe count fooles (true it is there are fooles, about whome the mockers and iesters doe take their pastime, and make them, as it is sayde, may games: the world is but too full of such fooles,) but of such as are counted foolishe, and are abhor∣red of the worlde, their number is very smal. Blessed are yee which suffer persecution for righteousnesse: &c. Againe, Blessed are Mat. 5. 11. yee when men reuile you, and persecute you. &c. Heerein stan∣deth the true wisedome, as Saint Paule doeth expresse, Let no man deceiue himselfe. If any man among you seeme to bee wise in this worlde, let him bee a foole, that hee may bee wise. They 1. Cor. 3. 18. which folowe these admonitions are the wise which rule them∣selues by knowledge. And the greate wise men of the worlde with their great traine, are but foolish, for the wisedome of this world is foolishnesse before God.
17 A wicked messenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambassadour is preseruation. When Solomon setteth A wicked messenger, against a fayth∣ful ambassadour, hee teacheth vs wherein wee may iudge the mes∣senger to bee wicked, to wit, when hee doeth not giue himselfe faythfully to doe the message that hee is sent for, and to execute the office that is committed vnto him. Solomon doeth threaten such a messenger with the fal of euil, that is, hee doeth foreshewe him a sharpe and harde punishement, as hee doeth deserue by his infide∣litie and disobedience, whereinto hee throweth himselfe headlong either by set malice, or by negligence and contempt. And thus, there is a double fal: one, whereinto hee falleth headlong himselfe, the which is cause of the seconde. Wee iudge that messengers or Ambassadours are wicked and disobedient, when they breake or leaue out any parte of the commission that is giuen vnto them by their superiours and rulers, and that rightly they are punished as traytours and vnfaythful. By a farre more stronger reason then, they which are sent of God are to be counted disobedient and traytors, when they neglect the message of their Lorde: and consequently, are very worthy to bee grieuously punished, the which they can by no meanes auoide: as Solomon doeth signifie it, when hee saieth, That A wicked messenger falleth into euill. Amongest the messengers and ambassadours of God in this worlde the prin∣cipals, are Kings, Princes, Magistrates, Pastours and Ministers of the Churche: Wherein (if they doe not labour to doe their Psal. 2. 9. 12. & 82. 7. Wisd. 6. 6. Eze. 3. 17. &. 33. 8. & 34. 2. message wel) punishement is prepared. As it hath beene saide, the wicked messenger doeth wel deserue to fal into euil: for al∣so, asmuch as in him lyeth, hee hurteth his neighbours: as So∣lomon doeth signifie, saying. But a faythfull Ambassadour is preseruation. Forasmuch as hee attributeth preseruation vnto the faythful Ambassadour, hee giueth closely to vnderstande, that the wicked messenger bringeth death and is a murtherer, for the which cause it is good reason that hee shoulde fal into euil. The worlde is greatly filled with such messengers, as wee
may see by the multitude of decrees and wicked iudgementes that are pronounced and executed vpon the innocents. Also we may see it by the false doctrines which are sowne by the hypocritical Fryers of the Popish Churche. For to knowe that Kings, Princes, Magi∣strates, and Pastours of the Churche are messengers, let vs note that a man is called a messenger, when hee is sent vnto any place, for to doe or say any thing: Wherevpon it right wel foloweth that wee may cal Kings, Princes, Magistrates, and Ministers, the messen∣gers of God, for they are sent from him. And Saint Paule saith that powers are ordeined of God. And the scripture doeth cal them by a 1. Pet. 2. 14. Rom. 13. 1. Psal. 82. 6. 2. Cor. 5. 20. 1. Cor. 4. 2. 2. Cor. 6. 3. Mat. 24. 45. & 25. 14. name, that signifieth not only an Angel, but also God. Euen so wee cal the Ministers of the worde, the messengers of God: for they are sent for to carry the message of reconciliation: in this ministery, they ought to behaue themselues faythfully and without offence. And consequently al faithful men, euery one according to the charge which is committed to him, ought to behaue themselues faithful∣ly, with care and diligence, otherwise, we fal first into corporal euil, and afterwardes, into euerlasting euil. Contrarily, they which haue faithfully executed their office: as they are healthful and serue for preseruation to thē vnto whome they do seruice, euen so also they themselues shal obteine health and preseruation: they shal not fal into euil, but shal prosper. Solomon doeth signifie this same, say∣ing, A faythful Ambassadour is preseruation. Wee do very wil∣lingly receiue and welcome and honour a good Phisition, by whose arte and science wee obtaine health: wee shewe him a cheereful countenance, and if wee bee able wee wil giue him giftes and pre∣sentes, and doe wishe him felicitie and prosperitie. Therefore when Solomon doeth attribute preseruation or health vnto the faythful Ambassadour, hee closely promiseth him that hee shal not fal into euil: but that God wil keepe and saue him. And therewith also hee sheweth howe the faithful Ambassadour, ought to bee re∣ceiued of men, yea with greater affection then the best Phisition of the worlde: because that the spiritual health is more precious and excellent then the preseruation and health of the body. The Phisi∣tions of the body do so much as they can, to heale the bodies for a certaine space of time: but the preseruatiō & health that the faith∣ful Ambassadours do bring, bringeth continual and euerlasting life,
if by fayth and obedience we receiue their ambassage. Now as there are fewe which gladly receiue the faythful ambassadour, euen so there are fewe which are preserued and haue health in their soules: the faulte whereof lyeth not in the faythful ambassadours. The worldlings doe not feele their sicknes and disease, & therefore they refuse the faithful ambassadours, and so are lost: and so much as in them lyeth, they make the messengers fal into euil, and no thanke to them, that they become not wicked and infidels. But albeit that the faythful ambassadours do bring preseruation and health, yet ought they to acknowledge and confesse that they are nothing but or∣ganes and instruments, and that there is but one Phisition Iesus Christ: of whose office looke Malachie chapter, 4. 2. Mala. 4. 2. 18 Pouertie & shame is to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth correction, shalbe honored. We do naturally feare pouertie, & would not be made a shame & reproche, but do greatly desire to abounde in wealth, to be pray∣sed and honored. But we knowe not how to gouerne ourselues for to flye & auoid that which we feare, and to obteine that which we would haue. And therfore our good God knowing what is needful for vs, and willing our good more then we ourselues, hath by Solo∣mon taught vs the way and meanes, to attaine to the true riches & honors. Now againe he teacheth vs the same. First of al, by a threat∣ning, Pro. 1. 8. & 3 9. 10. & 4. 1. &. 8. 10. 11. 32 saying, Pouertie & shame is to him that refuseth instruction. But the worldlings and carnal men doe nothing but mocke at such threatenings: as they when they contemne the preaching of the worde, when they reiect al instructions, and say that we must turne our backe vnto GOD for to come to wealth and riches. The Lorde knoweth wel a fit and meete time to fulfil his threatninges, making such riches to come to nothing, deliuering them to theeues and robbers, orelse to consume them by lawe, or by some other disorder and euil gouernement: and thus hee bringeth the con∣temners of his woorde, which had a worldly harte, and was lifted vp in pryde, vnto pouertie, beggerie and extreeme necessitie: and in this manner hee bringeth them to shame, and are counted vile and contemptible, euen abhominable. If wee doe feare to bee threa∣ned,
and that in steade of refusing instruction, wee take instructi∣on, admonition, correction and reprehension thankefully, pouertie and shame shal flye farre from vs, and wee shal haue whatsoeuer is expedient and necessarie for vs. Solomon doeth signifie it by a pro∣mise contrarie vnto the former threatening, when hee saieth, but hee that regardeth correction, shalbe honoured. When hee setteth regarding of correction, against refusing of instruction, hee doeth teache vs that to regarde correction, is to become attentiue, and to delight in the admonitions, instructions, and corrections, that GOD giueth vs by his woorde, euen in the chastenings and af∣flictions that hee sendeth vs: according as wee are admoni∣shed. Thus dooing, wee shal not want that which wee neede: Heb. 12. 5. Ia. 1. 2. 12. seeing that GOD doeth offer himselfe vnto vs as to his chil∣dren, and doeth accept vs for such, hee doeth honour vs, and wil for euer honour vs: Blessed is the man which abydeth tempta∣tion, &c. And when hee placeth honour, against pouertie and shame, hee giueth vs to vnderstand that, to honour, is not a courte∣ly reuerence with cap and knee, as s done vnto greate Lordes: but to bee honoured, is to bee wel counted of, and to haue his neighbours at his commandement, and to want nothing but that which may wel bee forborne, and which commeth not to a good ende. To honour, is taken in this signification. If ye wil haue Exo. 20. 1. 1. Tim. 5. 3. examples of them which haue refused instruction, wee will set Caine, the worlde destroyed by the flood, Pharao, the sonnes of Ely, Saule and Iudas. And they which regarded correction, were Abraham, Moyses, Dauid, Iob, Ezechias, the Prophetes, and A∣postles. Wee see by these examples what pouertie and misery doeth come vnto those which refuse to receiue the woorde, for to learne to repent and amende their life: Moreouer wee see also what shame they haue gotten. Therefore let vs know, that if wee folowe them, wee shal come to the like state. That we may auoid the same, let vs labour to folowe these good fathers, which haue beene so famous and renoumed: and wee shall bee their felowes, and partakers with them of one glory. And Saint Paule saieth, But Rom. 2. 10.  to euery man that doeth good shalbe glorie, and honour, & peace, to the Iewe first, and also to the Grecian. And to them which seeke eternal life, glory, honour, and immortalitie of wel dooing.
Let vs therefore take heede howe wee harden ourselues against the spurre, and kicke against the pricke: let vs not despise the riches of Gods goodnesse, &c. For to accomplish it wel, let vs not desire to haue Ministers which wil spare vs, and flatter vs, speaking sweete & pleasant things to our fleshly desire, & humaine reason: but rather let vs pray vnto GOD that hee woulde giue vs ministers whose mothes he hath touched, as he did to Ieremie, that they may feare nothing, but that boldely they woulde follow the commandement, Iere. 1. 9. Esay. 58. 1. Cry aloude, spare not, lift vp thy voyce like a trumpet, and shewe my people their trangression, and to the house of Iacob their sinnes. 19 A desire accomplished delighteth the soule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill. When the wicked and vngodly think and iudge that they haue and enioy their pleasures and desires, they leape for ioy and exceed in all dissolutions and insolencies. I say expressly, when they thinke and not when they haue: sith that all their desires are wicked, the Lord doth not suffer them altogether to enioy them, as they would haue them. For with an vnbrideled licence they woulde take and giue leaue to themselues to doe as they woulde euen to hurte an annoy the innocents: and so the poore faithfull ones which are weake in comparison of them, should haue no rest nor peace. They would bring the Church of God to nothing, and woulde spoile him of his kingdome: And as they haue not the full possession of their desires, euen so also their soules haue not the true ioy, though they doe dissolutely reioyce. If their soules had the true ioy, they should haue peace and quietnes: the which they neither haue nor neuer Esay. 57. 20. Psal. 37. 12. shall haue: for the wicked are as the raging Sea, which cannot rest. The wicked practiseth against the iust, and gnasheth his teeth a∣gainst 1. Sam. 9. 2. him. A man might haue well saide of Saule whilest hee was king, that he had, as a man might say, more then his soule coulde desire, considering the degree whereunto he was called in the king∣dome. Also a man might haue saide that Absolom the sonne of king Dauid, had what his soule could desire, seeing he had the heart . Sam. 15. 1. of the people, in his fathers life time. But these people here (as wee may see by their proceeding) as they haue not had their desire ac∣complished,
euen so haue they not had ioyful soules: as their so∣rowful and miserable ende hath wel shewed it. The desires of such and of their like tended to nothing but to euil and hurt: and there∣fore they came not to the ende of their enterprises. The Lord brea∣keth Psal. 33. 10. & 112. 10. the counsel of the heathen, and bringeth to nought the deuises of the people. The wicked shal see it and bee angry: hee shal gnashe with his teeth and consume away, the desire of the wicked shal pe∣rish. Moreouer Solomon doeth not heere speake of the desire of the wicked, when hee saith. A desire accomplished, delighteth the soule: Hee himselfe doeth shewe it by the Antithesis, saying, but it is abhomination to fooles, &c. Wee may see that hee speaketh heere of the desires, thoughtes, enterprises, and deliberations of the wise, iuste, and faythful men, who desire aboue al things that God should haue his kingdome in them and raigne in them. And to attaine to this, they labour to cast of al infidelitie and incredulitie, al superstition and y∣dolatrie, and al euil affections against their neighbors, that they may walke in righteousnes and innocencie according as Saint Paul doth admonish vs. The Lorde heareth such desires and thoughts: Lorde, thou hearest the desires of the humble, &c. In the fulfilling of these Ephe. 4. 24. & 5. 1. Col. 3. 8. Psal. 10. 17. & 37. 3. 4. desires, the faythful haue their delight. Put thou thy trust in the lord and bee dooing good: dwel in the lande, and verilie thou shalt bee fedde. Delight thou in the Lorde: and hee shal giue thee thy hartes desire. Moreouer the saintes being vnder affliction, desire that it may please God to giue them some ease, and to deliuer them: as it is seene by their prayers and complaintes whereof the scripture is ful. Amongst others: Turne thee againe (O Lord) at the last: & be gra∣cious vnto thy seruantes. And when they feele that God is merci∣ful Psal. 90. 19. & 94. 17. to them according to their desire, they are pleased: If the Lorde had not helped mee: it had not failed but my soule had beene put to silence. This sense is true, but the first agreeth better with the An∣tithesis to wit, that God delighted in the soules of the wyse, iust & faithful men, when they are not ouercome of the temptatiō, which doeth stirre them to euil, but putting their trust in the onely Lorde, doe giue themselues to wel doing. Solomon doeth wel shewe that hee meaneth thus, when he saieth, A desire accomplished delighteth the soule. Hee addeth against it, But it is an abhomination to fooles
to depart from euil. He sheweth that the foolish haue nei∣ther feare of God, nor reuerence to his woorde: that they haue no desire to doe wel, but do hate goodnesse and them which folowe it: they loue wickednes and them which assist them to continue ther∣in, and are companions with them in the same. Wee may plainely see this in the ydolaters and superstitions of the Papistes, wee may see it accomplished in the wicked, which passe nothing at all to committee wickednesse without number, and doe thinke and pro∣nounce them to bee ignorant and without vnderstanding which doe not as they do▪ we may see it in the persecutors of the faythful, which doe thinke they offer sacrifice and an acceptable woorke vn∣to GOD, when they slay the innocent. In this sentence is the pro∣mise of eternal life enclosed, which is the perfection of their delight which haue truly set their affections and desires to doe good: And thus wee are closely exhorted heere to folowe that which S. Paule Rom. 13. 12. Gala. 5. 16. 1. Thess. 4. 3. Tit. 2. 11. 1. Pet. 1. 13. 1. Pet. 2. 11. & 4. 1. doeth exhort vs to do: let vs then cast away the works of darknes, &c. But I say vnto you, walke according to the spirit, &c. This is the wil of God, &c. The grace of God which bringeth saluation to al men hath appeared, and teacheth vs, that we shoulde deny vngodli∣nesse, &c. Wherfore girde vp the loynes of your minde, &c. Deerely beloued, I beseeche you as strangers and pilgrims, abstaine from fleshly lustes, which fight against the soule, &c. For asmuch as Christe hath suffered for vs in the fleshe, arme yourselues like∣wise with the same minde, &c. Thus dooing wee haue life euer∣lasting. There is then no condemnation vnto them that are in Iesus Christ, which walke not after the fleshe, but after the spi∣rite, Rom. 8. 1. 6. &c. Againe, For the wisedome of the flesh is death: but the wisedome of the spirite, is life and peace, &c. In the seconde mem∣ber of this sentence is the threatening of death and eternal damna∣tion Psalm. 5. 5. threatened. 20 He that walketh with the wise, shalbe wise: but a com∣panion of fooles shalbe afflicted. There are some madbraines which desire not to bee wise, and iudge it nothing but heauie studie to learne wisedome: and there∣fore wil heare no counsel: they scorne at al admonitions, and re∣fuse
al corrections, and instructions, because they woulde passe the time merily, and liue ioyfully. But if wee haue any sparke of good vnderstanding and sounde iudgement, if wee had a setled and sta∣blished braine, wee woulde highly prayse wisedome, and desire to bee partakers thereof. And because for al the desire that wee haue therevnto, wee knowe not howe to attaine it, Solomon hath often and diuers times exhorted vs to heare, and to receiue her woordes, her commandementes, instruction, counsel and correcti∣on. And not content heerewith, hee doeth instruct vs what our conuersation ought to bee for to obteine wisedome, when hee saieth, He that walketh with the wise, &c. Let vs knowe that hee doeth not heere promise, that if wee dwell in one countrey or house with the wise, wee shall be come wise. Wee haue at all times seene the contrary in diuers, and so wee may see it still. But he promiseth vs, that if wee willingly do heare the wise, and receiue into our harts that which they teach and instruct vs, and that their company doth not grieue vs, but shall seeke it without dissimulation, that we shalbecome wise, if we keep company, be friendes, and acquainted with the wise, and if we shall loue their doctrine, and that wee labour to be like vnto them. It is better for vs to becom the Schollers and Disciples of the wise, then Esay. 5. 21. & 2. 14. 15. 18. theirs of whome Esay speaketh. Woe vnto them that are wise in their owne eyes, and prudent in their owne sight. If we become the Schollers of such men, wee shall haue no vnderstanding, and shall loose the company of the wise, we shall learne of them nothing but pride and hypocrisie: through the which we shall become accursed. And sith that in this estate we are execrable, wee cannot but looke for grieuous affliction, from the which the schollers of the wise shalbe exempted, as Solomon doth closly signifie it, when he addeth but a companion of fooles shalbe afflicted. Wee must take heed from iudging after the sight of our eyes. For seeing what hapneth dayly in the world, we cannot condiscend vnto the opinion of So∣lomon. Fooles haue the rule of the world and doe prosper therein: they haue their ease, delightes and pleasures: they haue glory and honour: they are in credit and authoritie, and abounde in wealth: and contrarily wise men want all these. Therfore we must open the eyes of our fayth, for to see and know that the felicitie of fooles is
of smal continuance: as hath bene often shewed, and that great de∣struction is prepared for them, from the which they cannot escape. Cōtrarily, let vs know that the suffrings of this present life are not worthy of the glorie to come. Therfore let vs not faint, but though our outward man perish, yet the inwarde man is renewed dayly. Rom. 8. 18. 2. Cor. 4. 16. Whē we were yet Papists we were thē felowes with fooles, who led vs to destruction for to bee afflicted euerlastingly: but now that the Lorde hath deliuered vs from this hellishe companie, and hath cal∣led vs into the societie of his Churche, it is our owne faulte, if wee doe not walke with the wise. Furthermore, they which haue some charge, or degree ought to learne to be wise, that their inferiours & vnderlings, their subiectes and seruantes which are vnder their sub∣iection and gouernement, may become wise, and that both pu∣blikely and priuatly in houses and families, wisedome might shyne, and foolishnesse bee rooted out. For as of foolishnesse wee learne nothing but euil, so there can happen nothing but euil to them that folowe it. Wherefore, let euery man take heede to himselfe, and that hee doe not lightly take familiaritie and acquaintance with all men indifferently: but that we labour to ioyne ourselues with the best, by the companie whereof wee may profit in goodnesse, and we may be made better in thought, desire and affection, in man∣ners, woorkes and wordes. As Ionathas by the acquaintance and familiaritie hee had with Dauid, changed his manners to better: And king Roboam by walking with his yong counsellers, became worse. For to take our profit of this present sentence, let vs remem∣ber what is written: Bee not deceiued: euil woordes corrupt good manners. Bee not vnequally yoked with the infidels: for what fel∣lowship 1. Cor. 15. 33 2. Cor. 6. 14. Ephe. 5. 3. hath righteousnesse with vnrighteousnesse? But fornicatiō, and al vncleannesse, or couetousnesse, let it not bee once named a∣mongst you, as it becommeth saintes. &c. 21 Al affliction foloweth sinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good. The wicked doe thinke, when they doe any thing secretly, or when they colour their malice for to hyde it, that none doeth see them: and therefore doe hope that no euil shal happen vnto them:
and though they commit euil openly, yet because of their credite and power, they thinke that nothing shal hurt them, and labour to make themselues beleeue it is lawful for them to doe what they list: and for this cause thinke to be out of al danger. Against this false Psal. 12. 5. & 64. 6. & 99. 3. Esa. 28. 14. 15 Leu. 26. Deut. 28. and vaine opinion, Solomon pronounceth, That al affliction folow∣eth sinners. And this agreeth with the threateninges of the lawe. True it is, that according to the outward appearance and sight of the eyes, we see not alwayes these threatenings executed: for the Lord doeth dissemble for a certaine time, and in the meane while, the wicked insleede of returning by repentance, doe harden themselues and waxe obstinate in euil, and insteede of humbling themselues by weeping and lamenting, they reioyce and are merry, seeing them∣selues to triumph and prosper, and to haue rule in the worlde. But after some dissembling and forbearing, the Lord putteth his threate∣ninges in execution: as the children of Israel felt it in the wilder∣nesse, and in the lande of Canaan: so also haue many wicked men felt it, and doe stil feele it. And Dauid also doeth wel shewe, that Psalm. 37. . Esay. 5. 18. affliction doeth folowe the sinner: and Esai, Woe vnto them, that drawe iniquitie with cordes of vanitie, and sinne, as with Carte ropes. Wherefore let the faithful take heede from enuying the prosperitie of the wicked, but be giuen vnto goodnesse. And al∣though it seemeth to bee in vaine that they labour to doe well, be∣cause of the great and multitude of miseries that they suffer, & that it seemeth also, howe God persecuteth thē to destroy and condemne them, yet their wel doing shalbe recompenced, for God wil reward and recompence them. Wee haue examples thereof in Abel, Abra∣ham, Leui. 26. Deut. 28. Psal. 18. 17 Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, Daniel, Iob, &c. Wee haue the promises thereof: and Dauid doeth witnesse the same of himselfe. And now Solomon promiseth the like, saying, But vnto the righteous God wil recompence good. Let vs take good heede from thinking of any merite, or to conceiue that by our righteousnesse wee can binde God to yeelde vnto vs the good that hee oweth vs: for it is im∣possible that hee shoulde owe vs any thing. If a seruant or a slaue that is bought with the mony of his Lorde, dooing al the wil and commaundement of his maister, can not binde him to recompense him, much lesse can wee merite towardes our Lorde, wee which
are redeemed not with corruptible things. Let vs looke vpon the si∣militude of the seruant returning from his labour. And if the law∣ful 1. Pet. 1. 18. 19 Luke. 17. 7. and natural childe cannot binde his father to giue him any re∣compence of his labours, although they bee great, what can wee deserue of our heauenly father, who by his onelie grace hath ele∣cted vs before the foundation of the worlde, and hath predestina∣ted Ephe. 1. 5. Iohn. 15. 5. Phil. 2. 13. vs for to adopt vs vnto himselfe by Iesus Christ, according vn∣to the good pleasure of his wil? And if without Iesus Christ wee can doe nothing: and that it is God that woorketh in vs both the wil and the deede euen of his good wil: what can wee pretende? Wherefore let vs humble ourselues: and when it is saide that God wil recompence: let vs knowe that that which is recompenced, is not alwaies dewe, be it good or bad: as when we say, hee hath paide mee yll for good, and contrarily, he hath done to his enemies good for euil. Nowe if we speake thus, we ought to vnderstand that God ought to haue this credite with vs of speaking of his gifts and gra∣ces in this manner, neither ought we to thinke it strange: neither ought we to waxe proude for this kinde of speeche, but to acknow∣ledge that God of his only grace and mercy doeth recompence his righteousnes in vs, wherewith hee hath indued vs, and whereby he hath done good workes. And let vs learne that the good which God doeth vnto vs after our good workes, is called, reddition, payement or rendring againe, recompense, or rewarde, because it commeth af∣ter, and not that our workes are the cause thereof. Wee may nowe wel vnderstand that the Papistes cannot alledge this text nor any o∣ther like too it for to builde their merites, and that they are decei∣ued through their pride. First of al in this that they woulde haue good workes to make a good man, as if the tree ought not first to be Mat. 7. 17. & 12. 33. good, before it can bring foorth good fruite. Secondly, in this that they attribute goodnesse and righteousnesse vnto the works which are nothing but abhomination before God, and are worthy of e∣ternal fire. Thirdly, in this that they woulde make God for such workes to stande bounde to giue them Paradise, from the which they goe backward, and fall into hel. That is, as if a subiect commit∣ted the horriblest iniuries that he coulde against his Prince, to wel∣come him home, and yet woulde binde him to raise him vp to ho∣nour, and to make him riche.
22 The good man shal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs chil∣dren: & the riches of the sinner is layde vp for the iust. It is commonly said that the third heyre shal neuer enioy those goods that are wickedly gotten. And forasmuch as wee desire that our successors, children, & cozens should possesse those goods that we shal leaue them, we must if we wil get goods, get them without ouermuch couetousnes, & without a desire to enrich ourselues. If 1. Tim. 6. 6. Heb. 13. 5. we do labour for them, let vs do it without desire to hurt or hinder our neighbour, and let that which wee possesse, bee holden with good conscience, being readie to distribute gladly of our riches vn∣to the needie, and also to forsake them, where it shalbee needful for the seruice, honour, & glorie of God, & to the edification and pre∣seruation of our neighbour. Thus doing, our goods shal not waste∣fully bee consumed, but both wee and ours shal haue a sufficient a∣boundance. Solomon doeth promise vs this same, saying, The good man shal giue inheritance vnto his childrens children. Al∣though there is none good but God onely, yet the scriptures fay∣leth not to cal him good, which God maketh partaker of his good∣nesse, giuing vnto him a right spirit, a sounde and perfit conscience, and a good affection to his neighbours, causing him to hate and ab∣horre al couetousnesse, spoyling, vsurie, fraude, disceit and wicked trades: making him gentle, liberal, merciful and helpeful towardes them which haue neede. The man that is such an one, shal obteine this blessing of God, that his children and cozins shalbe his heyres. The like blessing was promised vnto Abraham and vnto the other Patriarkes, vnto Dauid, and vnto al seruantes of God: I say expresly Gene. 12. 2. & 13. 15. & 15. 1. 1 Psal. 132. 1 & 102. 2. that the good shal obteine a blessing of God: for albeeit it is sayde, He shal giue: yet it is not to say, that it is in his power, or that hee can doe it of himselfe: but because that God hath giuen him wealth and also giuen him grace to vse them soberly without wasting, the scripture doeth attribute to him, that hee giueth: and that as a mi∣nister and instrument of GOD: for that which is attributed vnto him, is the gift of God. Let vs not then folowe the arrogancie of the riche worldlings, which boast of making their children riche: but if we be rich, let vs acknowledge that it belongeth vnto GOD to giue our children the possession of them after vs.
If hee doeth reigne ouer the kingdomes of men, much more ouer that which is of farrelesse importance. And albeit that diuers chil∣dren Dan. 4. 14. doe not enioy their fathers riches, yet neuerthelesse ceaseth not the present promise to be true, and haue his effect. But foras∣much as it is saide, The good man shal giue inheritance, &c. Let vs knowe, that that which hindereth children to inherite, is, either that the father was not good, though hee appeared so before the worlde, or if hee were good, that his children doe not folowe his goodnesse: and so before God are not counted the seed of the good man: And therefore rightly doeth God depriue them of the inheri∣tance, giuing them ouer to bee spoiled, or vnto excessiue expences, and vnto euil gouernement. Let vs therefore folowe goodnes, and we shal not want an inheritance. The meeke, (as Dauid saieth) shal possesse the earth, &c. The Lorde knoweth the dayes of the righte∣ous, Psa. 37. 11. 18 25. & 112. 1. &c. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lorde, &c. The Lorde doeth truely performe his promises vnto his elect and fayth∣ful, that they shoulde not want to perishe. And by his free and libe∣ral blessing, and by his fatherly care he so prouideth for the families of his, that before they haue neede, hee spoyleth the wicked of the goods they occupie, or that they shoulde enioy according to the world, and doth giue them vnto his seruants. Solomon doth signifie it, when he saith, and the riches of the sinner is laid vp for the iust. Gene. 15. 5. & 17. 8. & 12. 17. & 25. 23. 1. Sam. 13. 13. 14. & 15. 11. & 16. 12. The Lorde doeth shewe this kindnesse vnto Abraham, Beholde the heauen, &c. After the order of nature, Esau shoulde haue beene his brother Iacobs Lorde and maister, and haue had the eldership: but God kept it for they yongest and least. Saule was elected king ouer Israel, but for his foolishnesse and wickednesse hee was reie∣cted of God, and Dauid anointed king. After this, wee may first note, that what labour or care soeuer wee take for the wel dispo∣sing and ordering of our goods, and to keepe them, yet is it not in our power to hold and keepe them, for to giue and bestow them vp∣on our children and nephewes. The blessing of God is necessarie & required therein, without the which we do but loose our labour to studie to winne any thing. And therefore let vs not trust to our counsaile, studie and trauaile: but wee must confesse that both Psal. 127. 1. corporal and temporal riches are the giftes of GOD, and also the possession of the inheritance and holding thereof.
Our Lorde Iesus Christ doth well shewe it, when hee doeth teach vs to aske of our father, Giue vs this day our daily bread. We may learne then to aske of him that it may please him to keepe and pre∣serue them for vs. And if he suffer vs to be spoyled of them, let vs knowe that hee doeth it not without good and reasonable cau∣ses: that is, eyther for our sinne, or to prooue our patience, or for to teache vs too knowe that wee must not stay ourselues vp∣pon worldly riches. Secondly, wee must note, that it is lawfull for fathers and mo∣thers too keepe and lay vp in store some riches for their children: but they must also be carefull too flie couetuousnesse. Thirdly, seeyng that the earth, and the contentes thereof is the Lordes, ther∣fore 1. Tim. 6. 7. 2. Cor. 8. 7. & 9. 6. Heb. 13. 5. Psal. 24. 1. Tit. 1. 15. it followeth that sinners haue nothing in the worlde that pro∣perly belongeth vnto them, nor vnto those which vse the goodes of this worlde with a wicked conscience. And therefore when So∣lomon doeth attribute any wealth vnto the sinner, eyther hee speaketh vnproperly, or after the iudgement of the worlde, which esteeme the riches to belong vnto them which doe inioy them vp∣pon the same title, to wit, that they are without fault before men. Fourthly, albeit that the lande is reserued for the iust, yet is it not lawfull for the good and iust to take and vse at their pleasure what the wicked doe enioy and possesse, except they haue expresse com∣maundement from the Lorde, as when hee ordained that the peo∣ple Exod. 11. 2. & 12. 35. Deut. 1. 7. of Israel should enter into the land of Canaan for to possesse and inherite it. 23 Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is destroyed without discretion. There is none of vs but doth naturally desire to haue abundance of victual, for to keepe both ourselues and our familie from pouer∣tie and beggerie. We are very glad when we see fruitfull seasons, and are partakers thereof: but it is not ynough too desire the same, as Solomon doeth shewe it vs: for wee may see that hee sheweth Prou. 4. & 12. 11. therewith what we must doe for to get foode, as hee had done be∣fore. Nowe that wee may profitably tyll our lande, and get foode for to refreshe vs, hee teacheth vs what we shoulde bee, when hee
sayeth, Muche foode is in the fielde of the poore. If wee wil get much foode, wee must then become poore. This saying will bee iudged to bee verie straunge at the first sight: for wee can not desire to bee poore, because wee see oftentymes, yea daily, howe hardlie the poore liue, and suffer great scarcitie. Againe, the couetous and vsurers, the riche worldlings, and theeues which are like vnto vnsatiable gulfes, will mocke at this, hearing say that we must become poore to obtaine much foode But when wee shal vnderstande in what sense Solomon speaketh of the poore, wee will not thinke this sentence straunge, and shall knowe that indeede wee must become poore to obteine muche foode: and if the poore were not, al the worlde shoulde smart for it. By the poore: Solomon doth not vnderstand them which are destitute of al world∣ly riches. Suche kinde of people doe labour onely for other, and that which they doe, is not called their labour, but theirs which did set them on woorke and hyre them, and paye them for their daily labour or taskes. But in this place the poore are suche as doe not thinke themselues so riche that they can passe without labour, and lyue ydlely: they set not so muche store by themselues, but that they wil abase themselues to doe euen the vilest office that we can think of: so that in doing thereof, they may not bee vnprofitable. Of suche kinde of poore did Solomon speake. In the fielde of suche people, there is oftentimes much foode: for God blesseth their la∣bour, giuing them enough, and a contented minde, which is more then the great abundance of suche as are proude and swolne with Pro. 12. 9. their riches, and maketh no account to set themselues on woorke. For a certaine time their prouisions shal abounde in their houses, but afterwardes God bloweth vppon their riches, and they vanishe away. Contrarily, suche are the poore, that they are contented with a litle, and trauel duely and orderly about that which they possesse, and take not in hande more then they can doe, knowing that hee which gripeth too muche, can not long time holde it. The labour of suche kinde of people is oftentimes verie fruitful, and bringeth foorth muche, though there is no great boast of it: for it is done in time and season.
Beholde, howe there is muche foode in the fielde of the poore Contrarily, when a man taketh in hande verie muche, and more then hee can, his labour must needes perishe, seeing hee can not doe it in due time. Solomon doth well expresse it, when he saith, But the fielde is destroyed without discretion. This needeth no exposition, seeing it is knowne by experience: yet notwithstan∣ding, the want of discretion may be founde not only where more is taken in hande then can bee done, but also there where through negligence men make not account to set themselues on woorke, and are verie glad to doe nothing, but are delighted in idlenesse and slouthfulnesse. There the fielde which shoulde bee wel til∣led, is lost: and that whereof he shoulde rayse profite, is vnprofita∣ble: and so such haue not muche foode, but scarcitie and pouertie, according to the former threatening. Euerie one of vs in our estate and calling are here exhorted to labour, if we wil haue much foode. Pro. 6. 10. 11. For by the labour of the poore, Solomon signifieth all kinde of woorke and labour, which is done with care and diligence. But seeing that spare diet, fasting, abstinence, and sobrietie, are greatly commended in the Scripture, some wil aske, whither it is lawful to desire abundaunce of victual, and to take muche thereof or no? I answere, That it is lawful for vs to desire that which God doeth promise vnto vs by his Woorde: but it is not lawful for vs to burn with couetousnes, neither that we should be like vnto glut∣tons, and drunkardes, which the more they eate and drinke, doe more desire the same, and are neuer satisfied. It is lawful for vs to desire that God woulde giue vs fruitful seasons, and to blesse our labour and trauel, that wee may haue profite thereby, and not to trauell in vayne: and that our desires shoulde not tende to enrich ourselues, nor to fil vs and stuffe our bellies with excesse: but of the prouisions and gayne that God shall sende vs, wee woulde de∣sire to bee good disposers and Stewardes, and woulde take paine to doe it. In this manner we shal haue enough, in the which chiefly consi∣steth the abundaunce of victualls, when it is conioyned toge∣ther with a contented minde. Secōdly, we are exhorted to be cōtēt with our estate, whē God doth
allowe the same, sith it is saide that the poore haue much foode by their labour, It commonly happeneth that they that are contented with a little, doe liue muche more at their ease then doe they which are riche. 24 He that spareth his rodde, hateth his sonne: but he that loueth him, chasteneth him betimes. Beholde this is a lesson which pleaseth neither children, nor fooles, which haue neede of correction: and yet it is profitable for them, yea more necessary then eyther meate or drinke, wherein they are greatly delighted, and doe serue to strengthen the person. When we are young and foolishe, geuen vnto vayne desires and worldly and carnall pleasures, we cannot delight to learne this les∣son, neither can we heare that children shoulde be corrected: but when we are come to age, though we be not instructed in the Go∣spel, yet if we haue any sparke of good naturall iudgement, wee vn∣derstand then that it is needefull for children to be corrected, and doe commend and prayse our parentes for that they did not suffer vs to liue as we listed: and also there are some which can heauily la∣ment and complayne that their parents haue spared them too much, and haue borne too muche with their follies and frowardnesse of their youth, and for this cause, if they haue any children, they cha∣sten them, as they see to be necessary and expedient for them. The very heathen and Turkes doe know this: and there are some which will boast to bee reformed after the Gospel, and yet notwithstan∣ding they will neglect to chastice the follies, insolences and frow∣ardnesse of their children, and will not suffer them too bee beaten with rods, as is necessary: but rather they wil hate the Schoolemai∣sters that shall correct them: and will be ready to reuile them, in¦steede that they shoulde loue them and thanke them, and also too pray them to chasten theyr children sharply in good time for to saue them from the gallowes: for it happeneth oftentimes that the hangman doeth handle & execute them which haue not byn corre∣cted by their Parentes in theyr youth. Wherefore let those fathers and mothers which loue the welfare honor and saluation of their
children (or doe thinke to loue them) learne heere to correct them in good time: otherwise, so farre is it of, that they loue them in∣deede, that they rather hate them: and consequently, are murthe∣rers of their children: for whosoeuer hateth his brother, is a mur∣therer. 1. Ioh. 3. 15. And forasmuche as neither father nor mother woulde bee counted murtherers of their children, but contrarily, woulde giue them their blood, if their children had neede of it: seeing it is thus, I say, the parents must be careful to correct and chastise their chil∣dren betimes. Likewise, Kinges, Princes, Magistrates, and Iudges of the earth, which should bee the fathers of the people committed to their charge, if they loue their subiectes, they wil be careful and di∣ligent to chasten the foolishe, wicked, and dissolute. Moreouer, when the Ministers of the worde doe by it engender and get sonnes & daughters, they also are as fathers to the people committed vnto them, whome they ought to loue, and to shewe them their loue by admonitions, instructions, corrections, and threatenings. But for to returne vnto carnal and natural fathers, of whome Solomon doeth heree chiefly speake, when hee saieth, Hee that spareth his rodde, &c. For heere hee teacheth fathers of housholdes howe they ought to gouerne their children for to make them wise, sober, modest, humble and good) there is heere also an harde pointe to bee resolued: That is, that it may seeme that Saint Paule repugneth this sentence, when hee sayeth, Fathers prouoke not your children to anger. Ephe. 6. 4. Collo. 3. 21. Againe, Yee fathers, anger not your children. For there is no∣thing that the children doe hate more then the rodde, nor where∣with they are more prouoked and angred, then when they are bea∣ten with the rodde, and be made to feele it, so that if they durst, or were able, they woulde rise vp and withstande their parentes, or maisters, when they correct them. This is the solution of the for∣mer doubt. Let vs knowe, that Saint Paule doeth not forbid fa∣thers that they shoulde not correct their children with roddes, but as it might seeme by this, that Saint Paule exhorteth children to giue obedience vnto their parentes, hee speaketh chiefly vnto fa∣thers which haue children, and are not disobedient, nor dissolute, nor rebellious, nor contemners: but with humilitie, feare, and
reuerence, endeuour to please their parents, and to be at their com∣mandement. For we shal see some fathers so sharpe, churlish, cru∣el, seuere, vngentle, and vntractable, which wil not cease to beate and vexe their children which endeuour to yeeld their duetie. Saint Paule would not haue Christian fathers to be such towardes their children which doe their duetie, neither also towardes them which erre: and yet notwithstanding, hee meaneth not that they shoulde not be corrected: as hee sheweth, when hee sayeth, But bring them vp in instruction, and information of the Lorde. Like∣wise when Solomon woulde haue the childe to bee corrected, hee meaneth not that his bodie shoulde be alwayes beaten with a od, but that wee shoulde vse exhortations, corrections, instructions and threatenings: hee meaneth chiefly, wee should not spare such kinde of roddes. Moreouer let vs note, that al inferiours and vnderlings ought to suffer their superiours with humilitie, patience, and obedience. And if wee ought to behaue ourselues thus towardes men, by a more strong reason, towardes God: as it is largely handeled in the 12. Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrewes. 25 The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked shal want. A man that is instructed in the worde of GOD, which labou∣reth to cleaue theretoo by Fayth, that hee may bee assured of the goodnesse of the Lorde towardes him, in woorshipping him, cal∣ling vpon him, praysing and giuing thankes vnto him for al thinges: and also which laboureth by true repentaunce to followe his com∣mandements, that he may gouerne himself towards his neighbours with vnfayned loue, and to edifie them, in holding the true religi∣on, and yet for al this, prayseth himselfe neuer the more, but de∣pending wholie vpon the grace of God, looketh for his mercie only: this man is a righteous man, & is neuer forsaken of God, but obtei∣neth of him that which hee wisheth & desireth: so that he wanteth
nothing that hee can desire, Solomon doeth signifie it when hee saith, The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde. Hee saith this, folowing therin the commandement of the lawe and the promises of God, let no man deceiue his neighbour, &c. The de∣sires of such kinde of people are not outragious, but are contented Leui. 25. 17. & 26. 24. Deut. 28. 3. Psal. 37. 3. & 145. 14. with a litle, which is more worth then the great superfluitie of the wicked. Then let vs not thinke that they resemble and are like vnto gluttons and drunkardes, which knowe not when they bee ful, til their beilie pincheth them and swelleth: nor to wicked couetous men, vsurers and theeues, which are neuer satisfied. And therefore albeit that after the outwarde appearance these wicked men haue something to eate, and doe abounde therein, yet ought we not to bee abashed though Solomon saieth, But the bellie of the wicked shal want. This is according to the threatenings of God. The wic∣ked doe not feare such threateninges, because they see the present Leui. 26. Deu. 28. Psal. 37. prosperitie, by reason whereof they thinke that no euil can happen to them. But God knoweth wel howe to execute his woorde: as it hath beene and is dayly seene. For experience teacheth that those which giue themselues to serue their belly as it desireth, many times become poore, and want to sustaine themselues. There Luke. 15. 13. is an other sorte of wicked men which doe not so much desire to deuoure meate and to swil in drink, as they are to desire, toga∣ther, and to spare mony, for feare, that the earth should faile them: as are the couetous and vsurers for the most parte. The feare of such men shal fal vpon them: for either they are consumed by lawe, or else are robbed and spoiled: and so their bellie wanteth, the which commeth either because they dare not spende, or by lawe and thee∣uerie which bringeth them to beggerie. If they feele it not here, yet can they not auoide it: God knoweth wel howe to finde them out in time. Moreouer let vs note first of al, that it is lawful for faythful men, and Christians, to eate their fill, seeing that God doeth permit it Luke. 12. 2 & 16. 23. Esay. 65. 13. them, aswell in his lawe, as heere, and in Esay: but it is not to say, that they should eate till they burst, as doe vnsatiable bellies, which when they are filled desire nothing but too sleepe, leape or dance after their gluttonye and drunkennesse
making themselues vnprofitable vnto al good workes. Wee must so eate to the contentation of our mindes, that the meates & drinkes may not hinder vs to do our office, but may be made more nimble and more strong, & better disposed to doe our duetie. We shal then haue more care to feede our bodies, to sustaine them therwith that wee may be occupied in our calling, then to satisfie the greedie de∣sire of our flesh. And as we ought to abhorre gluttonie and drun∣kennesse, and to bee sober and temperate: euen so must wee take heede to bee like vnto them which for want of taking (with thanks∣giuing) the meate that God giueth vs, and that are necessarie for vs, wee become not slouthful and vnprofitable in wel doing. Truelie in such things there is a certaine kinde of wisedome. We should ther∣fore take our dayly nourishement, acknowledging and confessing that God maketh grasse to growe for the cattel, and greene hearbe for the seruice of men: That hee may bring foode out of the earth, Col. 2. 23. Psa. 104. 14. 15 and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oyle to make him a cheereful countenance, and bread to strengthen mans harte. Se∣condly, let vs note that what promises soeuer GOD maketh vnto his faythful children of temporal goods, that neuerthelesse he woulde not haue them to set, and fixe al their minde vppon them and to bee tyed to them, seeing hee doeth exercise them by diuers tribulations: but doeth tende to make them aspire and lift vp their mindes vnto the spirituall and eternal refreshing and contenta∣tion. Contrarilie, forasmuch as hee counteth the wicked vnwor∣thy of temporal riches, as hee declareth by his threateninges, they ought not to looke to bee partakers of the heauenly and e∣ternal riches, the which are infinitely and farre more excellent then al that wee can haue and desire in this worlde. Thirdly, let vs note that forasmuch as of our corrupte nature wee are all wicked, and woorthy to perishe with hunger and by eternall death, that therefore by this promise and threatening we are ex∣horted to conuert vnto GOD by fayth and repentance. Fourth∣ly, let vs not bee like vnto the infidells and idolaters, which doe attribute sterilitie and scarcitie vnto the children of GOD, but beholding the vnseasonable times and harde yeeres, in
what sorte so euer they come, let vs confesse our faultes, and ac∣cuse ourselues, and not our neighbours, what wickednesse soeuer is in them. The xiiii. Chapter. 1 A Wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish destroi∣eth it with her owne handes. WOmen whiche haue any naturall sense and wit, doe desire that all thinges should prosper in their hou∣ses, and that nothing shoulde decay, nor want but that al things shoulde encrease and bee mainteined for the entertaiment of their house: and e∣uen there where all wanteth, they wil labour so wel with their handes, that they wil make a good & plenti∣ful house, if it be possible. But what desire soeuer they haue, or what care soeuer they take to raise their estate, yet come they not alwaies wel to passe. Our first mother Eue hath proued it. It is not then e∣nough Gen. 3. 6. to desire, and to labour, but to come vnto our desires and en∣terprises, wee must eschew and flie folly, abhorre it, and be indewed with wisedome. Solomon doeth signifie it, saying: A wyse wo∣man. &c. Now if a woman must be wise for to builde her house, it followeth that the number of them which build, is very smal, see∣ing that it is very harde to finde a wise woman. I haue founde one man of a thousande: but a woman among them all haue I not Eccle. 7. 3. founde. Hee speaketh thus for to shewe that wise women are scant, and not that there are none at al: for wee finde that the Scripture doeth attribute wisedome vnto some women: as vnto Sara, to Abi∣gaile, to Debora. If the women and daughters of this age wil be fe∣lowes Heb. 11. 11. 1. Pet. 3. 6 1. Sam. 25. Iudg. 4. 4. and daughters of these holy women and other, they must la∣bour to be wise, in diligently resorting vnto the sermons, and prin∣ting the pure worde of God in their heartes: for it is saide, If thou
receiuest my wordes. &c. Therefore women and daughters must loue the worde of the Lorde, and must giue themselues vnto con∣tinual Pro. 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 1. Tim. 2. 3. 5 Ephe. 5. 22 1. Tim. 2. 9. &. 3. 11. &. 5. 4. Titus. 2. 3. prayer. So doing they shalbe such as Saint Paule requireth them to be. If they continewe and hold on in this, sorte they shal waste nothing of their housholde, but shal preserue them, and shal encrease by the blessing of God, so much as shalbee expedient. And not onely so, but also (which is more worth) they shal builde their houses with liuing stones, that they may bee a spiritual house, and an holy Priesthoode. Wee al ought to endeuour to attaine thereto, that it may bee saide of vs: yee are no more strangers and foreners, but citizens with the saintes: contrarily, if women bee foolishe, fo∣lowing their owne carnal nature, and committing foolishe actes to the dishonour of God, and to the slaunder of their family, they destroy and ouerthrowe their housholdes, not onely in this that 1. Pet. 2. 5 Ephe. 2. 19 God doth forsake them, for to bring al their temporal goods to dis∣order and confusion, the which they scatter and waste in banketting and delicate fare, in gay & gorgeous apparel, in playes and pastimes, and other dissolutions and insolencies: but also in this that they condemne themselues, and no thank to them that their housholdes doe not fal into eternal destruction. Solomon doeth signifie this same, when he sayeth, But the foolishe destroyeth it with her owne handes. For wee ought too knowe that Solomon doeth in diuers sentences instruct fathers and mothers of housholdes, for to teache them howe they shoulde gouerne and guide their families tempo∣rally, and to defende the necessities of this present life, as it is lawful for them, and as they ought to doe (as wee may knowe by the pro∣mises of God, made vnto the auncient fathers, and by their com∣plaintes, and prayers vnto God: and also when our Lorde teacheth vs to aske our dayly bread) notwithstanding his principal marke, whereto hee tendeth, is that wee shoulde take care to prouide for our spiritual necessities and wants, and to builde and erect vp our houses in the heauens. Thefore when hee speaketh heere, of wise women, hee meaneth not suche as are esteemed so before the worlde, because they can richely make their temporal profite of their house, preferring and setting it aboue the honour of God, and the profite of their neighbours: but hee speaketh of them
which first of al seeke the kingdome of God, and the righteousness thereof. Suche women haue laide a good foundation, which is, Ie∣sus Christe, and therefore they make a goodly and pleasant buil∣ding, and need not to feare that their building should fall for want of a strong foundation: for they builde vpon the strong rocke, against the which the gates of hel shall not preuaile. Let vs learne therefore that if our houses come to bee ouerthrowne, it is be∣cause wee builde not vppon this foundation, or that the stones that wee wil lay are neither fitte, nor meete for the worke. 2 Hee that walketh in his righteousnesse, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, despi∣seth him. The Lorde by his worde doeth exhorte vs to feare him: Ga∣ther Deu. 4. 10. & 6. 13. & 10. 12. mee the people together, and I will cause them to heare my woordes, that they may learne to feare mee al the dayes that they shal liue vppon the earth. Thou shalt feare the Lorde thy God, &c. And this it is that hee doeth chiefly demaunde: as Moyses decla∣reth. And nowe Israel, what doeth the Lorde thy God require of thee, but to feare the Lorde thy God, to walke in al his wayes, and to loue him, and to serue the Lord thy God with al thine heart, and with al thy soule? And albeeit wee are bounde to feare him, ex∣cept wee wil miserably perishe with the worlde which was destroy∣ed by the vniuersal flood: yet that wee may bee lead to feare him willingly, hee promiseth riches to them which shal feare him: and contrarily, hee threateneth and punisheth them which do not feare him. To the end therefore that wee may not bee contemned of the Deut. 10. 13 Psal. 34. 10. & 145. 19. Leui. 26. 14. 1. Sam. 2. 29. Lorde, nor may perishe, wee must feare GOD, and wee shalbee breserued and saued for euer. But there are some which deceiue themselues, making themselues beleeue that they feare God, be∣cause they giue themselues vnto superstition, and obserue mens traditions, and obey the commandementes of men, forsaking
the right way of the law of the Lord, from the which we must not decline neither to the right hād, nor left. Poperie is ful of such people, by the deceipt & craftie working of hypocritical frieres: who may iustly be reproched with this saying: ye haue made the cōmandemēt of God of no authoritie by your traditions. Againe, Woe therefore bee vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because yee shut vp the kingdome of heauen beforemen. Yee compasse Sea and land Mat. 15. 6. &. 23. 13. 25 23. to make one of your profession: yee tythe Mint, and Anise, &c. God of his mercy graunt that amongest vs there bee none suche like nor worse. Nowe to the end that wee shoulde not bee deceiued with suche kinde of people, Solomon doeth teache vs whereby we shal know whither wee haue the feare of God, when he saieth, He that wal∣keth in his righteousnes, feareth the Lord. For to knowe then whither wee feare the Lorde, wee must walke in our righteousnes. But when Moyses forbiddeth the Israelites, Yee shal not doe after Deut. 12. 8. Pro. 12. 15. al these thinges that wee doe heere this day, &c. and that Solomon hath saide heere before, The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes (nowe by our owne nature wee are fooles, delighting in our wayes, and striuing to doe what seemeth vs right) it might seeme that wee haue no certaine argument or proofe of the feare of the Lorde, when wee walke in our righteousnes. This shal serue for the answere, Let vs knowe, that there is no righteousnes that can be attributed vnto vs, as hauing it of ourselues. It is true that God Eccle. 7. 30. hath made man righteous, but they haue sought many inuentions. Man hath no righteousnesse the which is of his owne, but of the gift of God: and yet by his foolishnesse hee hath lost it. Neuer∣thelesse in folowing of the scripture, wee wil cal that ours, which belongeth vnto God, and which is by his grace and liberality gi∣uen vnto vs: for in giuing it vnto vs, hee maketh it ours. There∣fore when GOD giueth vs grace certainely to knowe that hee is our GOD, Father and Sauiour, and that for Iesus sake hee wil not impute our sinnes vnto vs, but doeth forgiue them vs, and that also by this knowledge we are brought to abhorre and de∣test our wickednes & willingly and gladly to folow goodnes, & to giue ourselues to do good works, which he commandeth, and hath
ordeined that we should walke in them: then doe we walke in our righteousnesse, and may bee certified that wee feare the Lorde: as is saide heereafter. And for asmuche as wee are assured that Prou. 18. 13. wee feare GOD, wee may bee assured also that wee please him: wherevppon it followeth that we ought not to stande in doubt whether God doeth loue vs or not, and wil saue vs or not. Psal. 51. 19. Esay. 66. 2. But that we may not bee deceiued, let vs know that Solomon doth not speake heere of suche a feare as doeth make vs to tremble and quake before God, as men do before a sharp, seuere, & cruel iudge: but hee speaketh of suche a feare as doeth leade vs to honour God, and to giue him willing obedience. Hee doeth wel giue it to vnder∣stande, when, against feare hee setteth contempt, saying: But hee that is lewde in his wayes, despiseth him. After what sort soeuer wee take, this worde his wayes, either for the wayes of God, that is to say, for the kind of liuing and gouernment in this world, that god teacheth vs by his worde: or for the wayes of man, that is to say, for the conuersation that man ought to follow: there shalbe no in∣conuenience at al, and the sense shalbe al one. For seeing that man is the creature of God, hee ought not to haue other wayes then those which God teacheth him and commandeth him, but ought to walk straight in them, without turning from them, either to the one side or to the other: otherwise man doeth not feare God, nor honour him, but doeth despise him: as Solomon doeth pronounce: and heerein hee doth threaten al hypocrites and dissemblers, al idolaters and superstitious, & al those which worke iniquitie, shewing them that they can looke for nothing but destruction and damnation, see∣ing they despise the authour of life and saluation. Furthermore, let vs note that if wee wil turne this sentence backwarde, and say, who so feareth the Lord, walketh in his righteousnesse: but hee that doeth despise him is lewd in his wayes: the later sense shal not re∣pugne the former, but we shal heere learne, (as the trueth is) that it is the feare of the Lorde which maketh men to walke in righteous∣nesse: and contrarily, that it is contempt of God which turneth mē aside, and maketh them lewde in their waies. 3 In the mouth of the foolish, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wise preserue them.
It seemeth vnto the wicked which haue authoritie and power, or thinke to haue maintenance and bee supported, that it is lawfull for them to speake what they list: and indeede they vse their tongues at theyr pleasure, as a theefe doeth his sworde, and muche worse: for they sharpen not their tongues onely against men by wicked wordes, by commandementes importable, by false witnesse bearing, lying, flatteringes and slaunderings, and backbitings, but also against God, in forsaking him, and giuing themselues vnto the Diuel, in cursing, swearing, and forswearing, blaspheming, and ta∣king his name in iest, and in aswel mingling it with the vanities and filthinesse, as with humane and diuelishe doctrines, with vnshame∣ful and wanton songes: in such wise that a man may blame them. Thou giuest thy mouth to euil, and with thy tongue thou forgest Psal. 50. 19. &. 7. 9. 11. deceite: euen so also wee may complaine that they haue lifted vpp their mouthes to heauen. This is to haue the rod of pride in their mouth, when they doe thus vse it against God, and against their neighbours, & as they thinke, without hurt and danger it is lawful Psal. 10. 11. &. 94. 7 for them to raile. For they say, God will neuer see it: neither wil the God of Iacob regard it. And as touching men, because they open their mouth against the innocent and weake, they boldly say, With our tongues, we wil preuaile: and our lippes are our owne, Psal. 12. 4 who is Lorde ouer vs? But wee may say vnto them, yee that are without vnderstanding, heare, and you fooles, when will yee bee taught? Therefore albeit that they thinke to remaine vnpunished, yet shal they not escape nor auoide rhe hand of the Lorde: for it is saide. These thinges hast thou doone, and I helde my tongue: therefore thou thoughtest that I was like thee: but I will reproue thee, and set them in order before thee. Againe, Surely thou hast Psalm. 50. 21 Psal. 73. 18. Psal. 94. 21. set them in slippery places, and castest them downe into desolation Again, They gather them together against the soule of the righte∣ous, and condemne the innocent blood. Solomon doeth heere after a sorte threaten them with this destruction, when hee doeth attri∣bute pride vnto them: for that which is highly esteemed before mē, Luke. 16. 15. &. 1. 51. is abhominable before God. And the virgin Mary saith, Hee hath scattered the proude in the imagination of their heartes. God re∣sisteth the proude, and giueth grace vnto the humble. Hee signifieth
also their destruction, when against the rodde of pride, hee set∣teth the preseruation, and conseruation of the wise, saying, But the lippes of the wyse preserue them. The preseruation where∣of hee speaketh, is not worldly nor temporal, it is neither corporal nor carnal: for there are no people in the worlde counted more fo∣lishe, proude, and arrogant in wordes, then the wise, therefore are they hated and persecuted, and put to death. They speake trueth, which the worlde cannot beare: the which also the heathen haue knowne and saide, That trueth getteth hatred. But we must stay ourselues vppon the worde of the Lorde. If the worlde hate you, yee knowe that it hated mee before you. Againe, they shal excom∣municate Iohn. 15. 1 &. 16. 2 you, yea the time shal come, that whosoeuer killeth you, wil thynke that hee doeth God seruice. This is not the con∣seruation or temporal preseruation that is heere spoken of, nor wherevpon wee must bee staied: but Solomon speaketh chiefly of the spiritual and eternal preseruation, as also the destruction of the foolishe which doe proudly speake, is eternal. True it is that as sometimes God sendeth temporal punishmentes too the wicked, and is visibly reuenged of him: euen so according as hee seeth ex∣pedient, hee sheweth and declareth himselfe the preseruer of the wise. Noe and other haue prooued it true. And forasmuche as wee desire to bee preserued, wee must cast from vs the rodde of pride, and take the lippes, which are opened with humilitie and mo∣destie with trueth and temperancie. The which wee cannot doe of ourselues: And therefore let vs pray, Open my lippes O Lorde, and my mouth shal shewe foorth thy prayse. Againe, Set Psal. 51. 17. &. 141. 3 a watche, O Lorde, before my mouth and keepe the doore of my lippes. Thus doing wee shall not bee comprehended among them of whome the Scripture complaineth. For there is no constan∣cie in their mouth: within they are very corruption, their throte Psal. 5. 9. &. 57. 4. &. 64. 2. 3. is an open sepulchre, and they flatter with their tongue. My soule is among Lions: I lie among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are speares and arrowes, and the tongue a sharpe sworde. Hide mee from the conspiracie of the wicked, and from the rage of the workers of iniquitie, which haue whet their tongue like a sword, and shot foorth their arrowes, euē bitter words. &c, Psal. 140. 3.
They haue sharpened their tongues like a Serpent: Adders poyson is vnder their lippes. Such kinde of people fal into destruction, as in the places before alledged yee may see. Wee ought not to bee trou∣bled with this destruction, as though it shoulde destroy vs with them. For euen as in vsing our tongues wisely, wee are not their companions in euil speaking, & proud words: euen so their destru∣ction shal not come neere vs, but our lippes shall preserue vs: that is to say, that God wil allowe of our wordes, and therefore he wil pre∣serue vs from destruction: not so, that wee can deserue it by our lippes, as it ought to bee manifest vnto vs. For sith wee knowe that it is the gift of God to gouerne wel our lippes, wee must not doubt but that it commeth by onely grace that wee are preserued and safely kept. But the Scripture hath his proprietie, to attribute that to the instrument, which belongeth onely to the workemaister which guideth them: and this serueth to beare with our rudenesse, and to be made more easie. 4 Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increase commeth by the strength of the Oxe. There is none of vs all but loueth wel to haue greate rents, for to liue at ease in this worlde: but forasmuche as there are many carelesse and slouthful, which had rather be idle then to worke, and applie their minds to folowe some honest vocation, therefore they must suffer pouertie, and vtterly be destitute of riches: as Solomon hath exhorted and threatened them. And now vnder other wordes hee signifieth the same thing, saying: Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie. Solomon applieth himselfe heere to our kinde of speaking: for whē we are altogether destitute of things, wee vse to say, that wee are cleane emptie. Hee placeth one kinde of labour heere, vnder the which hee comprehendeth al others, and doth declare vnto vs that except wee doe diligently followe the e∣state wherevnto wee are called, and vse necessary meanes to prouide for ourselues and our familie, wee cannot looke but for pouertie, as wee deserue the same. Contrarily, if we doe imploy the power that God doeth giue vs, and duely doe our office, wee shall abounde
in al wealth that is necessary for vs, and according as God shall see to bee expedient for to mainteine and keepe vs in his seruice. So∣lomon doeth signifie this same when hee saith, But much increase commeth by the strength of the Oxe. We haue none other do∣ctrine heere, then suche as wee haue hearde alreadie oftentimes: and it is not without cause that Solomon vseth repetition. For we are slow, negligent and slouthful, and haue neede to be prouoked, & as it were spurred vp, and often to bee put in remembrance what wee haue to doe. Furthermore, by the care that he hath to repeate this doctrine often, he doth shew vs how necessary for vs it is to labour. Euē as the oxen doe drawe the plough for to breake vp and turne ouer the earth, and to make it fit to bring foorth fruit: euen so also must e∣uerie one of vs be occupied about our woorke after his calling, and beare the yoke which God hath laide vpon vs: neither must wee be ashamed to be compared vnto Oxen, neither disdaine to learne of them, seeing that the Scripture setteth them foorth before vs for to be our Maisters and Doctours, not onely before the common peo∣ple, but also before the greatest: as Ieremy doeth complaine therof: Thou hast smitten thē, but they haue refused to bee tamed by disci∣pline, Ier. 5. 3. 4. 5 Mat. 11. 2. &c. Let vs in no wise be like vnto such rebels, but rather let vs folowe the exhortation of the Lord. If wee must needes become subiect vnto worke for to obteine enough of corporal liuing: much more must wee submit ourselues vnto the lawe of the Lorde, and folowe the wayes, that God doeth teache vs, by the which hee woulde leade vs to eternallife. Otherwise, if wee say with the wic∣ked, Let vs breake their bandes: The Lord wil make vs subiect vnto Psal. 2. 3. Deut. 28. 48 Iere. 28. 13. cruel maisters, as he hath done heretofore to the children of Israel, according as he had threatened them, And shalt be subiect to thyne enemie, &c. Thou hast broken the yoakes of wood: but thou shalt make for them yoakes of yron. The Papistes as we may knowe, are vnder a very harde and heauie yoake, when they are vnder such Mat. 23. 4. maisters as our Lorde describeth. Let vs acknowledge and confesse the blessings that God doeth giue vs in employing vs in his seruice, and hee wil giue vnto vs abundance of reuenewes, & chiefly such as are spiritual. For seeing he commandeth, Thou shalt not muzzle Deut. 25. 4.
the Oxe that treadeth out the corne: hee wil not leaue vs destitute of necessary things. But if wee despise the blessings hee giueth vs, and doe rebel against him, let vs looke for punishment: I haue nou∣rished Esay. 1. 2. and brought vp children, but they haue rebelled against mee: and consequently the desolations wherewith God hath threatened his people, came vpon them. 5 A faithfull witnesse will not lie: but a false recorde will speake lyes. This saying of Solomon is so manyfest and knowne to all men which haue the least good naturall wit and vnderstanding, that it needeth none exposition, but onely to bee considered vpon: and thereby wee ought to learne not to lye, but to say the trueth in all our talke. And the rather because wee take it not wel to be coun∣ted or called lyars or false witnesses, but faithful and true: but chie∣fly because that God (which ought to bee preferred before al our desires and affections, our honour and reputation) abhorreth false∣nesse and lying: as hee hath declared by his Lawe, Deut. 19: and cōmendeth trueth vnto vs highly, which he loueth: otherwise hee Exo. 20. 7. 16. &. 23. 1. Leu. 19. 11. 12. Deut. 19. 16 2. Tim. 2. 13. Iohn. 14. 6. &. 17. 17. shoulde denie himselfe: the which we ought neither to thinke nor say: and also it cannot bee, Though we beleeue not, yet abideth he faithful, hee cannot denie himselfe. Hee himselfe also is the trueth: seeing that he neither is, nor can bee separated from his word, which saith, I am the way, the trueth, and the life. Sanctifie them with thy trueth: Thy worde is trueth. But forasmuch as euery man is a lyar, we must confesse that of our nature wee are al false witnesses: and therefore if wee wil become true witnesses, wee haue neede that God woulde send and com∣municate his holy Spirite vnto vs, who is the Spirite of trueth, which leade the disciples of our Lord Iesus Christ into all truth: for the which to obteine, wee must pray, Take not thy worde of trueth vtterly out of my mouth, for I waite for thy iudgementes. It is Psal. 119. 43. &. 5. 7. necessary for vs that in all our wordes and talke wee bee armed with trueth, if wee will not perishe. For the Prophet Dauid saith, Thou shalt destroy all them which speake leasing. Wee
haue a fearefull example thereof in the fifth Chapter of the Actes of the Apostles. And if all our talke ought to bee true, aboue all it is necessary that the wordes which concerne God and Christian religion shoulde bee vttered with trueth. The Ministers therefore of the worde ought chiefly to bee true witnesses. 6 A scorner seeketh wisedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easie to him that will vn∣derstande. It seemeth at the first sight that the first part of this present sentence, repugneth against diuers places of the Scriptures. Pro. 1. 7. 22. 24. Pro. 2. 3. 4. 5. For Wisedome hath called, and her counsell is refused. And shee promiseth the knowledge of GOD. And thus it seemeth that shee speaketh agaynst herselfe. Furthermore, forasmuch as there is no wisedome, but in GOD, and from God, wee can not seeke wisedome, except that wee seeke God, who is contem∣ned of scorners: and therefore they seeke neither him nor his wis∣dome: but they say in their heartes, there is no God: The wicked careth not for God: The foole hath saide in his heart, There is no Psal. 10. 4. & 14. 1. Wis. 6. 12. Mat. 7. 7. God. On the other side, Wisedome shineth and neuer vadeth a∣way, and is easily seene of them that loue her, and founde of such as seeke her. And our Lorde sayth, Aske, and it shalbe giuen you, &c. We see by these scriptures that scorners do not seeke wisedome, & that if they did seeke her, they shoulde finde her. I answere, For to finde God and his wisedome truly, wee must seeke her with all our hart, as we ought to haue vnderstood it before: And Moyses doeth Pro. 2. 3. Deut. 4. 29. teache vs also the same. But if from thence thou shalt seeke the lord thy God, thou shalt finde him, if thou shalt seeke him with all thyne hearte, and with al thy soule. And to doe this wel wee must forsake our wickednesses: Seeke the Lorde whiles he may be found: call vppon him whiles hee is neere. And wee must walke truely in Esa. 55. 6. Psal. 145. 1 the feare of GOD: The Lorde is neere vnto all those that call vppon him: yea to al that cal vppon him in trueth. Mockers and scorners doe not seeke the Lorde after this sorte: and there∣fore they doe not finde him. And yet Solomon doeth not lye, when hee sayth, That the scorner seeketh wisedome. For his
intent is not to attribute suche care vnto scorners, which nothing at al regarde the worde of the Lorde, the which is our wisedome, and vnderstanding, when we receiue it in feare, and that by the same wee learne to assure ourselues of the goodnesse of God towardes vs: and that renouncing al wickednesse and abhorring it, wee set all our delight to follow the commandement of the Lorde. But be∣cause that the scorners doe labour to make themselues beleeue that they tende to gouerne themselues wisely, and woulde be estee∣med wise (for if they be reprooued for their wickednesse, inconti∣nently they crie with open mouthes, that they are honest men: & indeede, we shal see some of them which wil shew some signes wher∣by it shal seeme that they tend to none other thinge, but to behaue themselues wisely, euen to bee guides of other) for this cause Solo∣mon saith, that the scorner seeketh wisedome: but because they seeke it not as they ought, therefore they finde it not: that is to say, that they neither wil nor can gouerne themselues by wisdome. But that it shoulde not trouble vs to seeke wisedome, and that it might be easie for vs to find it, & rule ourselues thereafter, we must haue knowledge. Solomō doth declare it vnto vs, whē he saith, But knowledge is easie to him, &c. By a man of knowledge, Solomon signifieth such an one as is careful to print the pure woorde of the Lorde in his hearte and to delight therein. Such a man shal easi∣ly finde knoweledge: and as hee truely seeketh wisedome, so doeth hee also finde it, and thereby doeth gouerne himselfe, bearing Mat. 11. 30. willingly and gladly the yoke of the Lorde, the whiche hee fin∣deth easie. 7 Depart from the foolish man, when thou perceiuest not in him the lips of knowledge. Because the worlde conteineth more fooles then wise men, and that the fooles doe prosper in outwarde sight, are strongest, most riche, and of greate credite and authoritie, working all thinges af∣ter their owne minde, and hauing flatterers to flatter them, and to say they do well, euen as they would, therefore it seemeth vnto the weake and vndiscrete that they could do no better, nor gouerne them more wisely then to ioyne themselues with them, and to bee
acquainted and familiar with them, for too learne their knowledge, whereby they may rule themselues as they doe, and to attaine vnto the degree of their prosperitie, credite and power. But they are de∣ceiued in this opinion: for they can learne nothing to profit them. Solomon doeth shewe it, when hee saith, Depart from the foolish man: when thou perceiuest not in him, &c. Hee forbiddeth vs the companie of the foolishe, their acquaintance and familiaritie also: for it commeth not of feare that we prosper, but rather in this, that we be not cursed as are the foolish, though they think farre other∣wise, and this commeth because they looke no further then to the earth, and haue no knowledge of God, but walke in darkenesse, and haue their mindes and vnderstanding darkened with ignorance: the which is the greatest plague they can haue in this life: for suche an ignorance maketh them fall into muche wickednesse, in the whiche they become obstinate and indurate: whereupon foloweth their o∣uerthrow and destruction. Nowe that the foolishe haue no knowledge of God, Solo∣mon doeth signifie it, when hee giueth the reason, wherefore hee warneth vs to departe from the foolishe man, and saith, When thou Rom. 1. & 2. Ephe. 4. 17. 18. perceiuest not in him the lippes of knowledge. Had they the know∣ledge of God, and that their hearts were garnished with true know∣ledge they woulde speake of that which they knew and vnderstood: For from the abundance of the hearte, the mouth speaketh. And Mat. 12. 34. thus wee might knowe in them the lippes of knowledge, and learne of them to gouerne ourselues wisely. The which can in no wise bee doone: for not onely they are emptie and voide of knowledge, but do also hate it: wherof it foloweth rightly, that they do not de∣light to speake thereof, & to cōmen or talke therof for the instru∣ction and teaching of their neighbours. In steede then to knowe in them the lips of knowledge, wee heare vanities, and filthie disorde∣red speaches, which proceede from foolishnesse and malice where∣with their heartes doe greatly abounde. Solomon doeth somewhat signifie the same, when he denieth them to haue the lips of know∣ledge: for sith they are great talkers and babblers, they must needes haue lippes through whose infamousnesse wee may learne that they haue no knowledge of God, but are filled with malice and foolish∣nesse. Pro. 12. 23. & 13. 16. They are great medlers, as Solomon doth declare. And foras∣much
as euil wordes doe corrupt good manners, therefore it is not without cause that Solomon exhorteth and commandeth vs to de∣parte 1. Cor. 15. 13 farre from the foolishe man. And because that Popery is stuffed and replenished with suche foolishe men, it were necessary for them which haue any good beginning of the knowledge of trueth, to departe from thence for to seeke the lippes of knowledge and learning. Wee must be diligent to followe this doctrine, and this same of our Lorde: Let them alone, they bee blinde leaders of Mat. 15. 14. 2. Cor. 6. 14. the blinde, &c. And this of Saint Paule, Bee not vnequally yo∣ked with the infidels. &c. If wee cannot departe with our bo∣dies, yet let vs take heede from consenting vnto them, but let vs rather rebuke them, as Saint Paul teacheth vs. It belongeth vnto al Christians to doe the same without feare of loosing either life, goods, renowme, or credite, or the fauour of the worlde: but it ser∣ueth chiefly for the Pastours of the Churche. Our Lorde doeth Ephe. 5. 11. giue vs an example thereof. If euery one of vs for his parte will doe this, then must we arme our hearts & minds with the pure do∣ctrine of the Gospel, and bee so filled there with, that from the a∣bundance of the knowledge that wee shal haue, our mouthes shoulde bee opened for to vtter knowledge and learning, for too Mt. 10. &. 23 make our neighbours partakers with vs thereof, that they might take no occasion to departe from vs, but to loue and imbrace our companie, and to desire our acquaintance and familiaritie. It is not enough for vs onely to depart from the foolishe, but wee must also labour to drawe others vnto vs, and chiefly the weake and ig∣norant, and to shewe ourselues soft, gentle, easie and tractable: that they may knowe wee haue the lippes of knowledge, and to vn∣derstande that wee haue discretion and wisedome, for to gouerne our lippes: not as they which trusting in their wits and wisdome, speake as they list, and wil for no reason that can bee brought them giue place vnto other, nor hearken to any counsel: but to speake as the wordes of God, being readie to receiue instruction of them which are indewed with the spirite of God, as they shewe by their sayings and doeings. 8 The wisdome of the prudent is to vnderstand his way: but the foolishnes of fooles is deceite.
There are many men which thinke themselues wise, prouident and prudent, when they so gouerne themselues that they saue them¦selues from hurt and hinderance, and that none doe stop their pro∣fite: and in the meane while doe labour with al their power to get credite, authoritie and power, and to encrease their riches and wealth of this worlde, without caring whether they doe wrong or no to their neighbours, so that it bee not perceiued, or that men dare not rebuke thē for it. But sith we must beleeue Solomō which saith, The wisedome of the prudent, &c: let vs not esteeme such men to bee indewed either with wisedome and prudencie, but one∣ly with a diuelishe wisedome, subtiltie, and deceite, which wil bring them to destruction: for they vnderstande not their way. Neither knowe they howe they ought to gouerne and guide themselues to doe their duetie and office belonging to their neighbour: though they labour to make themselues beleeue that they are cunning and learned men, but it is to make their profite to the hurt of our neigh∣bours, rather then they woulde misse and faile of their purpose. This is not to vnderstand their way aright, seeing that by such kind of doing, they wander and stray out of the way, so that they runne to destruction. If suche prudent men had their eyes open for to see their destruction, they woulde iudge that they did not vnder∣stande their way: as at the last they shall both knowe and also re∣pent it. We haue an example heereof in the rich glutton: Againe, the answere made vnto the Goates doth also shew it. But their re∣pentance Wis. 5. 3. Luke. 16. 23. Mat. 25. 44. shal nothing profite them, but the more to torment thē: as our Lorde doeth wel signifie the same, when hee threateneth to sende the vnprofitable seruant into darkenesse: and when he saith, that there shalbe weeping, and gnashing of teeth. Whiles wee haue Mat. 25. 30. time therefore let vs take paines to vnderstande our way, that wee may followe it. But it might wel seeme, that it is not needeful for man to vnderstand his way for to followe it, and that there is no∣thing but foolishnesse and wickednesse therein, and that by flying from it, there shoulde bee rather wisedome, and good discretion be∣fore God. For al the imaginations of the thoughts of mans heart are Gen. 6. 5. &. 8. 21. euil continually. Again, The imagination of mans heart is euil, euen from his youth. Wherof it foloweth, that al the waies of mā are no∣thing worth: we haue al gone astray: for their workes are wicked
workes: Let the wicked forsake his waies, and the vnrighteous his owne imaginations, and returne vnto the Lord. &c. The answere, Esay. 55. 7. & 59. 6. Iere. 18. 6. Euen as the seruant which forsaketh the worke that his Lorde and maister hath commanded him, and giueth himselfe to his pleasure, is wicked and slouthful: euen so also, hee which despiseth to walke after the worde of God, who is our Lorde to whom wee al doe owe obedience, and is giuen to liue after his fantasie, is wicked and vn∣faithful. Contrarily, as the seruant which wil truely shewe himselfe faithful and wise, doeth carefully the worke of his maister, as if it were euen his owne: and indeede, hee calleth it his, because hee is bounde to do it, and that it is his duetie and office to bee occupied therein: Likewise, if we wil shew ourselues wise & prudent, as we ought, wee must apply our heartes and mindes, to knowe the way which the Lorde in his worde doeth teach vs: for to followe and walke diligently in the same. Thus doing, wee shal vnderstande our way, not that it is properly ours, not that wee haue chosen it of ourselues: but because our duetie is, to apply our mindes to know and to followe the way which hee teacheth vs and commandeth vs to holde. Wee may say also that the way of Gods commande∣ments is ours, when he giueth vs grace to guide ourselues theren by his holy Spirite, who maketh vs to delite therein, and maketh vs that wee may truely say, I haue had as great delight in the way of Psal. 119. 14 thy testimonies: as in al maner of riches. They which vnderstand this way, are wise and prudent, and can gonerne themselues as ap∣perteineth: and as they know howe to auoide the snares of Satan, and wil not bee deceiued thereby: euen so their affections doe not stretche to deceiue any man. Solomon doeth something signifie this same, when hee saith, But the foolishnesse of the fooles is de∣ceit. Against wisedome, hee setteth foolishnesse, and against the prudent, the fooles: and against to vnderstande his way, he setteth deceite. Wherein he sheweth vs that for asmuch as the fooles do not vnderstande their way, neither wil vnderstand it, they are easily deceiued: and also are giuen vnto fraude and deceit. they are subiect vnto the baites of Satan, and cannot auoide them: as also they labour to entrap their neighbours, and to hurt them, euen to destroy them when they thinke they cannot obtaine their desires
ottherwayes. Suche crooked deceit is described vntoo vs in the Psalmes: Beholde he shall trauell with wickednesse: for hee hath conceiued mischiefe, but he shall bring foorth alie, Psal. 7. 14. & 9. 16. & 10. 15. The foole maketh a mocke of sinne: but among the righteous there is fauour. Let vs first of all note, when Solomon setteth the righteous a∣gainst the foole, that he speaketh of wicked fooles which hate know ledge, which despise wisedome and instruction, and are frowarde, malicious, vnfaithfulll, arrogant and cruell. For those are righteous which loue knowledge, which make great account of wisedome & instruction: and are delighted with vprightnesse, iustice, goodnes, and faithfulnesse: and are ful of gentlenes, humanitie and beneuo∣lence. Herein consisteth righteousnes: as we may gather of the for∣mer Chapters, and also by this present sentence, when Solomon setteth the foole against the righteous, and doeth attribute fauour vnto them. Secondly, when against making a mocke of sinne, he setteth fa∣uour, wee must vnderstande that this mocking is ful of crueltie, and that the foolishe doe not mocke as it were in passing by, when they haue committed any wickednesse against their neighbours by do∣ing of them wrong and iniurie, in dooing of them violence to de∣stroy them: but they runne ouer head and eares, and bathe them∣selues therein, and are rauished and caried headlong with a great abundance of wicked desires and cruel thoughtes. And yet not∣withstanding, they make no great account of their misdoings which they commit to the great detriment and destruction of their neigh∣bours, as if it were a light thing. Solomon doeth somewhat sig∣nifie this same by the worde of making a iest or a mocke: and hath plainely signified it heere before in the tenth Chapter and 23. verse. The worlde hath alwayes beene replenished with such fooles, as al∣so was shewed in the same former place. Thirdly, when fauour is at∣tributed vnto the righteous, let vs note, that wee cannot boast our¦selues of righteousnes, except we be led with sweete & gracious af∣fections towards our neighbours, and delight to doe them good, in folowing the exhortations of S. Paul: Let al bitternes, & anger, and Ephe. 4. 31.
wrath, crying, and euil speaking bee put away from you with al ma∣liciousnes. Bee yee therefore followers of God, as deare children, and walke in loue, euen as Christ hath loued vs, &c. But nowe put Ephe. 5. 1. 2. Coll. 3. 8. yee away euen al these thinges, wrath, anger, maliciousnes, cursed speaking, filthie speaking, out of your mouth. But forasmuche as it is verie harde to finde suche fauour and gentlenes on earth, we may wel know that the worlde is voide of righteous men. 10 The heart knoweth the bitternes of his soule, and the stranger shal not medle with his ioye. The Scripture doeth transferre the bitternesse of the soule, after diuers sortes, and sundrie significations. For first of all, when Moyses admonisheth the children of Israel: that there should not Deut. 29. 18 be among them any roote that bringeth foorth Gall and Worme∣wood: Hee taketh the roote bringing foorth Gall and Wormwood, for the inwarde malice of the heart, the which doth so poyson man, that hee delighteth and assureth himselfe in his wickednesse, and not feeling the punishment of his misdoings, hee bringeth foorth nothing but bitternesse, angring and prouoking his frowarde and corrupted concupiscence to despise God. Wee may gather this in∣terpretation from the verie woordes of Moyses, when hee after∣wardes sayeth, So that when he heareth the wordes of this curse, &. 19. hee blesseth himselfe in his hart, &c. In this same signification is also bitternesse taken. Secondly, bitternesse is taken for crueltie, malice, and sharpnesse. Thirdly, when Ezechias saieth, Beholde, for felicitie I had bitter Hebr. 12. 15 Esai. 38. 17. Act. 8. 23. Ephe. 4. 31. Iam. 3. 14. Luk. 22. 62 griefe, but it was thy pleasure to deliuer my soule from the pitte of corruption: And when also it is saide, that Peter went out & wept bitterly; bitternesse is there taken for heauinesse, sorowe and griefe: as it is also in this present sentence, when it is saide, The heart kno∣weth the bitternesse of his soule. Solomon doeth shewe it, when against bitternesse he setteth ioye, saying, And the straunger shal not medle with his ioye. Let vs vnderstande, that wee are heere admonished, not to seeke our ioye and consolation in outwarde thinges of this worlde, when our heartes are troubled and sorow∣ful: but for to be deliuered and freed from our heauines & sorow,
and to obteine ioye, wee must runne vnto God, knowing that it is not without cause that hee is called the God of consolation: For vnlesse hee doeth comfort vs, what ioye soeuer wee haue, yet must the same bee turned into griefe and trouble. Contrarily, if hee giue vs ioye, and comfort vs, none can remooue nor take away our ioye. Dauid doeth wel confesse this, when he saith, If the Lord had Psal. 94. 17. & 86. 3. not holpen mee, my soule had almost dwelt in silence. Let vs not be blinded and caried away with the pleasures of this worlde, but let vs say with Dauid, Be merciful vnto mee, O Lord: for I crye vnto thee, continually. 11 The house of the wicked shalbe destroyed: but the taber∣nacle of the righteous, shal florish. The wicked labour so muche as they can, to make Solomon a layer, as it hath beene alwayes their custome either by deede or woorde, to belye those which haue threatened and condemned them in the Name of God. Noe the Embassadour of righteousnes Hebr. 11. Gen. 6. 14. Mat. 24. 34 condemned the worlde of the wicked, and that in following the worde of God, but no thanke to them, that they laboured not to shewe that it was but in iest, wherewith they were threatened. In steede where they ought to haue conuerted vnto God by true repentaunce, and to feare his threateninges, they endeuoured to make them voide in banquetting and feasting one with an other, for to put them out of remembrance: and for to preserue theyr houses and families, they made mariages: but for all that euer they could doe, yet was the hande of God strongest, and the ende declared that they were not threatened in vaine. Thus their house was destroyed: as was also the same of the Zodomites, and Go∣morrhians. Gen. 19. 2 Luk. 17. 23 2. Pet. 2. . Mat. 7. 27. The wicked ought to looke for no other ende. Let them labour to be riche, and to strengthen themselues so muche as they can, eyther by heaping vp of goods and riches together, or by credite and power, or by leagues with the more mightie & more noble then themselues, yet must their house fall: for it is not built vppon the rocke. Albeit then that the wicked doe boast and brag and exalt and lift vp themselues, yet shal they not continue. They thinke they are verie sure and stable: as Solomon doeth
signifie it, attributing an house vnto them, and attributing vnto the righteous but a simple tabernacle, the which oftentimes is litle and lowe, and easily remoued hither and thither. Notwithstanding hee compareth the florishing state of the righteous vnto the appearance of the long continuance of the house of the wicked, and doth also preferre the same before it, when hee saith, But the Tabernacle of the righteous shal florish. First of al let vs note that when a simple and weake tabernacle is preferred vnto an house which seemeth strong and mightie, wee are taught not to stay, nor to trust vnto the fayre shewes of this worlde: but rather to seeke humble thinges, and to be contented with a lowe degree: so doing, we shalbe raised vp vnto an excellent and euerlasting highnesse. Secondly, forasmuch as the state of the wicked is compared vnto an house, wee must not therefore maruell though they bee greate in outwarde sight, and doe long stande: as it seemeth to those which haue not like prospe∣ritie. Their state is compared vnto an house: but like to such an house as shalbe destroyed, and shal ouerwhelme such as are therein. Nowe there is none of vs but had rather dwel in such a light taber∣nacle, then to dwel in such a decayed house, how great and faire soe∣uer it be. They which know of destruction at hande, cannot dwel but in great feare. And forasmuch as the scripture compareth the state of the righteous vnto a tabernacle, against the wicked & their estate: therefore wee must not departe from righteousnesse, though that in folowing thereof wee bee despised of the worlde, and that our condition be worse in outwarde sight, then the same of the wic∣ked. For the pouertie of the faythful patiently borne, is much more worth, then the great prosperitie of the wicked. Solomon doth sig∣nifie it, when against destruction, he setteth florishing, saying, But the tabernacle of the righteous shall florishe. But seeing that the floure is soone passed and gone, and that it withereth & becōmeth haye very quickly & dryeth, as we dayly see: and that the scripture compareth the most excellent thinges of this worlde, vnto a floure, to shewe therby their vnstablenesse, inconstancie and vanitie: it may seeme therefore, that the excellent state of the righteous, is not due∣ly Iob. 14. 2. Psal. 103. 15 Esay. 4. 7. Iames. 1. 10. nor rightly signified, when it is said, that their tabernacle shal flo∣rish. To the which I answere, albeit that the floure is of smal conti∣nuance, yet, after winter (in the which it seemeth that al herbes are
deade when the spring time commeth (in the which all herbes and rootes of the earth doe waxe greene, spring and floorish) wee finde al things well and in good case, whereat we reioyce. The Scripture also for to signifie the prosperous and blessed estate of the faithful, doeth attribute to them, flourishing: it saith, Heereafter Iacob shall Esai. 27. 6. & 35. 1. take roote: Israel shal floorish & grow, & the world shalbee filled with fruite. The desert & the wildernes shal reioyce: and the wast ground shalbe glad and floorish as the rose, &c. Such as be planted Psal. 92. 13 14. in the house of the Lorde, shal floorish in the courtes of our God. And because that this prosperous and floorishing estate is not out∣wardly seene, but that the faythfull most commonly are vnder affli∣ction, as experience doeth teach it. The Scripture sayth not that they doe floorish: for they are now as it were in the winter but it saith that they shal florish. And herein it sheweth that their flowre shal continue euen for euer. Solomon doth wel shew it here, when against destruction he setteth flourishing. 12 There is a way which seemeth right to a man: but the yssues thereof are the wayes of death. When any thing is often done in the world, it seemeth there is no euil in it. Wherevpon it followeth that it seemeth good and right: seeing that betweene good and euill, betweene wrong and right there is no difference. There are but a fewe which be of this opinion, but in al estates almost custome is made a law, though it be against the honour of God, and against the loue of our neighbour. We may see the same in superstitions and idolatries, in craftes and occupations, in trades and merchandize. Because the way that such folkes doe holde is commonly vsed, therefore it seemeth too them right: but they shal at the last feele that they wandred and went a∣straye after diuers sortes and very greeuously: as Solomon doeth signifie the same, when he sayth, But the yssues thereof are the wayes of death. Wherein he teacheth the very same thing that Moses taught the children of Israe, Ye shall not doe after al these thinges that wee doe here this day: that is, euery man whatsoeuer Deu. 12. 8.
seemeth him good in his owne eyes. And immediately after, hee Deut. 12. 8. threateneth that if wee followe that which is right in our owne minde and opinion, that wee shal dye, not onely temporally and corporally, the which is common both to men and to beastes, to the Eccles. 3. 19. & 9. 2. iust and vniust, and also wee see that they which walke right, after the iudgement of the worlde, are not in so great danger of corporal death, as are they which seeke to please God, according to his word. Who are rather counted, sheepe for the slaughter. But chiefly by eternal death, wherein the wicked shal knowe, that the way which Rom. 8. 36. they haue holden, was not the right way. Suche knowledge shal profite them nothing, but further to tor∣ment them. Wherefore, let vs vnderstande, that Solomon doth Wis. 5. 3. admonishe vs to walke cleane contrarie to our owne opinion and fantasie, if wee wil auoide death, and obteine life. Furthermore, hee sheweth vs, that wee al of ourselues do tend vnto death: for wee thinke that wee are so wise, that wee can a∣lone guide ourselues. This same is common to al men, vntil they be regenerate and sanctified by the Spirite of God, who by his an∣nointing doeth teach and leade them. To the ende then that we do not enter into the wayes of death, Let vs pray, Leade mee, O Lord, Psal. 5. 8. & 25. 4. in thy righteousnes, because of mine enemies, &c. Againe, Shewe me thy wayes, O Lorde, and teache mee thy pathes, &c. 13 Euen in laughing the heart is sorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines. When the worldlinges and carnal men doe feele themselues troubled and grieued, or when they wil put away and resist griefe, they wil playe and passe the time away as merrilie as possibly they can: they eate, they drinke abundantly, euen til they be drunke or verie neere: they leape, sing and daunse: they delight to reason, to iest and talke of vaine thinges, yea filthie and vncleane: they turne their looke for to feede the same with the appearaunce of beautie. After this manner they laught: but as Solomon saieth, Euen in laughing the heart is sorowful.
For albeeit that in leading such a life they labour to auoide griefe, yet they cannot: for they haue an hang man within in them, which doeth torment them, from whose handes they labour to bee deli∣uered, to wit, their conscience which doeth reprooue them & feare them before the iudgement seate of God for their disordered life: though they stryue to make themselues beleeue that there is nei∣ther God nor Deuill, neither saluation nor damnation. And there∣fore they reioyce dissolutely, as though euil shoulde neuer happen vnto them: but finally they shal feele that they haue beene decei∣ued as Solomon doeth wel declare vnto them, saying, And the ende of that myrth is heauinesse. After that A∣dam had reioyced of eating the forbidden fruite, hee had great hea∣uinesse: Gen. 3. 7. . the which had continued for euer, if God had not redres∣sed it by his promise. The worlde which perished with the flood did no lesse feele, it, than did the Sodomites and Gomorrhians. The Gen. 3. 6. & 7 & 19. Exo. 32. Luke. 16. Luke. 6. 24. 2 Esay. 5. 11. 12. & 22. 12. 13. people of Israel was punished for their idolatrie, The riche glutton was cast into hell. Al these nations haue felt that which Solomon speaketh of: and all such like shal feele it. Woe vnto them, that rise vp earelie to followe drunkennesse, and to them that conti∣newe vntil night, til the wine doe inflame them. And the harpe and viol, timbrel, and pype, and wine are in their feastes: but they regarde not the woorke of the Lord, neither consider the worke of his handes. And in that day did the Lorde God of hostes call vnto weeping and mourning and to baldnesse and girding with sackecloth, &c. 14 The hearte that declineth, shalbee satiate with his owne wayes: but a good man shall rule ouer him. Solomon hath shewed vs heere before what are the wayes of an harte that declineth, when he saide, My Sonne, if sinners intice thee, Pre. 1. 1. consent thou not, &c. For their feete runne after euill, &c. For except mans heart were alienated and estranged from GOD and his woorde, hee shoulde not haue such wicked thoughtes, neither woulde hee giue himselfe vnto such wicked workes, the which doe worthily deserue grieuous punishment: as Solomon doeth shewe.
Let vs not thē be like vnto those that are desirous to heare newes, that they may passe away their time merily and carelesly, so vayne and vnprofitable they are: and yet notwithstanding, they thinke verily they are not sluggish and sleepish, but are quicke and nimble. As such men doe easily beleeue lyes, euen so doe they delight to make others beleeue them also, and they thinke a man a verie foole, or that he doeth them wrong, when hee beleeueth not their words so easily, as did their iesters and flatterers. Secondly, let vs not be like vnto them which loue to bee flattered, and too heare nothing that may trouble or hurt them: but would haue men to speake such thinges as doe please them, or that they thinke to bee profitable for them. They wil diligently heare lyars, false witnesses and slaunderers. Now as God forbiddeth lying, false witnesse bea∣ring, and slaundering, so doth he also forbid, Thou shalt not receiue Exo. 23. 1. 2. Tim. 4. 3. a false tale, neither shalt thou put thine hand with the wicked, to be a false witnesse. Thirdly, let vs take heede we be not like vnto those which haue ytching yeares. The world almost is filled with none other people, and chiefly Turkie, and the places where poperie reigneth. If we fol∣lowe them, we runne into destruction, and doe worthily deserue to perish, seeing that wee are warned therof in diuers places. Hauing 2. Thes. 2. 10. Rom. 16. 17. 1. Tim. 4. 1. 2. Tim. 3. 1. 2. Pet. 2. 1. then so many testimonies, wherby we are admonished, we do wor∣thily deserue to be counted and called fooles and dolts if we beleeue euery thing. And for as much as we cannot take it well to be coun∣ted such, but contrarily, would be holden and esteemed for discrete and wise, therfore we must stand vpon our watch, considering dili∣gently how we should gouerne ourselues, that wee goe not awry. Solomon doeth teach it vs so, when he saieth: but the prudent will consider his steppes. For to consider well our steepes, that we may be well gouerned, and not to beleeue euery thing, wee must Psal. 5. 8. & 25. 4. 119. 12. 105. & 103. pray, Leade me O Lord, in thy righteousnes, because of mine ene∣mies: make my way plaine before my face. Shew me thy waies, O Lorde, and teach mee thy pathes. Blessed art thou, O Lord, teach me thy statutes. Thy worde is a lanterne vnto my feete, and a light vnto my path. The entraunce into thy wordes sheweth light, and giueth vnderstanding to the simple. Nowe for to enioy this same,
well wee must followe the order that Iesus Christ hath placed in his Church. Thus doing, we shalbe wise, discrete and well gouerned, as S. Paule doth admonish vs. Brethren, be not children in vnder∣standing, Ephe. 4. 11. but as concerning maliciousnes be children, but in vn∣derstanding be of a ripe age. But when S. Paule saieth, That loue 1. Cor. 14. 2 suffereth all thinges, it beleeueth all thinges: it hopeth all thinges, it indureth all thinges: it may seeme therefore not to be foolishnes to beleeue euery thing. To the which I answere, The holy Ghost which hath thus spoken by S. Paule, hath saide also by Moyses: If there ryse among you a Prophet or dreamer of dreames, and giue thee a signe or wonder, &c. S. Paule himselfe also hath saide, Trye all things, and keepe that which is good. Againe, S. Iohn saith, 1. Cor. 13. 7. Dearely beloued brethren, beleue not euery spirite, but try the spi∣rites whether they be of God. And therefore, when it is sayde, that loue beleeueth all thinges, let vs vnderstand it of such thinges as may and ought lawfully to be beleeued. For a Christian man Deu. 13. 1. 1. Thes. 5. 21. 1. Iohn. 4. 1. ought not wittingly and willingly to cast away wisedome and right iudgement, and suffer himselfe to be deceiued, that he should not iudge between white & black: but ought very rightly to proceed in simplicitie and humanitie in iudgement, and not to be so wicked as to charge his neighbour with wrong and euill suspition. 16 A wise man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is carelesse. They which for the wickednes they haue committed, do feare to be punished, and yet haue no minde to doe wel, nor abhorre the euil that they thinke and doe commit: such doe not departe from euil, for all their feare: as wee haue examples thereof in Cayn, Pharao, Saule, and Iudas and others. Therefore when Solomon sayth, that A wise man feareth, &c. hee speaketh not of such a feare, but of an holy and honorable affection that the faithful beare towards God wherby they abhor & detest al wicked∣nes, rebellion & disobediēce, & trēble for the euils that they eyther
thinke or commit, knowing that they are greatly indetted to the iudgement of God: and because they are not pardoned, they feele themselues guiltie of death and damnation. And yet notwithstan∣ding, by the trust that they haue in the mercies of God, they loue the good that hee commaundeth, and labour to giue him obedi∣ence. This is the true wisedome, and the feare which God requi∣reth of vs, and as hath alreadie bene handeled. A wise man ther∣fore Deut. 4. 6. & 10. 12. Pro. 1. 7. & 2. 51. & 8. 13. & 9. 10. Rom. 7. 24. feareth the iudgement of God, which hee deserueth for his sinnes, the which also hee abhorreth and detesteth: and therefore by true repentance, hee laboureth to auoide them, and to giue him¦selfe vnto goodnesse, and according as God doth command him by his holie woorde. And being rebuked and reprehended, eyther in his owne conscience, or by his neighbours, hee waxeth not spight∣ful, but confesseth that hee is verie miserable, because of his sinnes and offences. Contrarily, as Solomon saieth, A foole rageth, and is carelesse. When Solomon setteth raging, against departing from euil: and carelesnesse, against feare: wee may first vnderstande that the foole through despight and anger that hee hath to bee rebuked of God in his conscience which doeth pricke him, or to bee admonished and corrected by men, which set the iudgementes of God before him, and doe threaten him with his vengeance: by despight I say, of such admonitions, hee striueth to transgresse his word, and to giue him¦self foorth on to do euil with al insolencie and dissolutenes, with all iniuries & ragings, to the dishonour of God, & hurt of their neigh∣bours. The world destroyed by the flood, & the Sodomites & Go∣morrhians, and Saule did so behaue themselues: as may be gathe∣red by the Scriptures. And nowe at this day many wicked men doe rage after this sort: euen as Iudas hath also raged & fought against Iesus Christ. Secondly, Let vs vnderstand that whē it is said, that the foole is carelesse, that Solomon doeth not attribute vnto him any true assuraunce. For the sounde of a leafe shaken, shal chase him, Leu. 26. 36. Psal. 14. 5. Esa. 5. 20. &c. There they shalbe taken with feare, because God is in the gene∣ration of the iust. The wicked are like the raging sea, that can not rest, whose waters cast vp myre and dirte. But hee doeth attribute arrogancie, boasting and presumption vnto him: whereuppon it commeth, that the foole against his owne conscience, laboureth
to make himselfe beleeue that hee shal wel atchieue his enterprises, and that nothing shal hurt him nor hinder him: and therfore, bold∣ly and rashely doeth hee giue himselfe to doe euil. The wicked Psal. 10. 2. & 12. 4. Esai. 28. with pride doeth persecute the poore, Which haue saide, With our tongue wil wee preuaile, &c. Because ye haue saide, We haue made a couenant with death, and with hel are wee at agreement: though a scourge runne ouer, and passe through, it shal not come at vs. Forasmuch as there is nothing but the only truth of God which can assure man, and deliuer him truely from al feare, the which truth the foole doeth despise and reiect: therefore it followeth, hee can not stande fast, but after the former meaning. And albeit the foole doeth stande fast or is carelesse, yet is hee not assured, but standeth still in feare, and trembleth: euen so, albeit that the wise man fea∣reth, and that hee standeth not fast, yet is he assured and certified of the helpe and goodnesse of God. In this there is no repugnancie: as wee may see by that which hath beene alreadie saide, both of the wise man & foole, otherwise S. Paul would not exhort vs, to make Philip. 2. 2. an ende of our owne saluation with feare and trembling. Hee woulde not haue vs to doubt of the good wil of God towardes vs, nor of our saluation: but hee woulde that we shoulde witnesse and pprooue our obedience, in this, that wee abase ourselues and be∣me humble, confessing howe miserable we are of ourselues, and nowe naked of al goodnesse. This feare is contrarie to the careles∣nesse of fooles and wicked men, wherein they waxe proude and are delighted, or rather are puft vp with a vain confidence of their force and power. 17 He that is hastie to anger, committeth follie, and a busie bodie is hated. Albeit that al vertues doe agree together, and that there is no re∣pugnancie betweene them, and that the worldly wise men doe say, that there is al one instruction of thinges contrarie: yet neuerthe∣lesse al vices which are contrarie vnto vertue, doe not agree altoge∣ther, but there are some, amongest the which there are great con∣trarieties. Amongest others, Solomon doeth heere set before vs two vices, and doeth set them one contrarie to the other. The one
is choler, the which sodainly breaketh foorth by woordes or by actes that are put foorth without regarde had to the ende thereof, whether it shalbe hurtful to a mans selfe or to his neighbours: whe∣ther we shalbe praised or discommended thefore: whether we shal escape as we would after anger is past: it sufficeth to shew his impa∣tiencie, for too make him afraide, and that there may be no resi∣stance. But that is not al waies obteined: for oftentimes it hape∣neth that the vnpatient doe meete with as angry folkes as them∣selues are, or with other discreete men and well ruled, which can wel suppresse them, and make them feele that they doe not wisely but foolishly, which hurteth them. Solomon doeth signifie it, saying, He that is hastie to anger, committeth folly: Hee fo∣loweth heere our manner of speaking. For wee often saye that a man woorketh folly, when that which he doeth serueth to nothing but to bring him to contempt, or to hinder him, & to destroy him in steede that hee ment to do that euil to his neighbour. And when he thus speaketh, he doeth wel shewe vs, that wee ought to be care∣ful to take heede, lest we be sodainly angry, seeing wee would haue no foolishe thing laide to our charge, but woulde haue whatsoeuer we say or doe, allowed to be good. Saint Iames doth exhort vs, say∣ing, Iam. 1. 19. 20 Mat. 5. 19. Let euerie man be slow to wrath. For to preserue vs then from rebellion, and to auoid punishment, let vs folow the patience of our God: The Lord is strong, merciful, and gracious, slowe to anger, and Exo. 34. 6. Psal. 103. 8 Ephe. 4. 31. & 5. 1. Collo. 3. 8. abundant in goodnesse and trueth. And for to folow this wel, let vs obey S. Paul, who saith, Let al bitternes, & anger, &c. be put away frō you. But now put ye away euē al these things, wrath, anger, ma∣liciousnes, cursed speaking, filthy speaking, out of your mouth. Thus doing, we shal not commit follie, but shal work wisdō. The vice that Solomon placeth against hastinesse or anger, is a long & secrete pur∣pose to hurt a mans neighbour, the which at the last is discouered, & maketh a man hated, who after hauing long dissembled the anger & hate that he did beare to his neighbour, doth declare him such as he is, labouring to put his deuises in execution. This is giuen vs to vn∣derstande, when Solomon saith, A busie bodie, or a man of imagi∣nations, shalbe hated. He doeth here shew vs what reward the ma∣licious are woorthie of, that is to say, that as they haue nourished in their harts, wrath, & hatred, euē so it cōmeth to passe that they are
hated as they deserue: first of God, as Solomon saith in his 6. chap. The Lorde hateth an hart that imagineth wicked enterprises. Hee maketh them also to feele this hatred, as Dauid saith: Thine hande Pro. 6. 18 Psal. 21. 8. . shal finde out al thine enemies, and thy right hand shal find out thē that hate thee: Thou shalt make them like a fiery ouen in time of thine anger, &c. When the scriptures speake thus in the name of the afflicted, against busie bodies, it sheweth in the secōd place that they are hated of mē, as they do also wel deserue. But it is not to say that it is lawful for vs to hate them which imagine euil thinges, a∣gainst vs for our owne sakes: but inasmuch as they bee the enemies of God. Oh that thou wouldest slay, O God, the wicked and blood∣die men, to whome I say, departe from me: Which speake wickedly Mat. 5. 44 Rom. 12. 17. Psal. 139. 1 of thee, being thine enemies are lifted vp in vaine. Albeit then that Solomon saith that the busie bodie, or man of imaginations shalbe hated, yet it is not to say, that he alloweth vs to hate our neighbor, howe wicked soeuer he be, for his owne profit or disprofit: but So∣lomon doeth shewe vs what doeth happen vnto the dreamers of malice, and what they deserue to haue. And because that we natu∣rally desire to haue the loue and fauour of our neighbours, and not their displeasure, except we be voide of our right wits, we must here therefore learne to thinke wel and to do wel to our neighbours. 18 The foolish do inherite follie: but the prudent are crow∣ned with knowledge. When wee despise or reiect any thing, it is very harde to ob∣teine and get it: but if we bee careful as wee ought to followe any thing, wee easily get the possession thereof. Wherefore if the foo∣lishe haue neither knowledge nor wisdome, we ought not to won∣der at it: for as wee haue seene, they reiect it. And in steede of that, Pro. 1. 7. 2 they are earnest after folli▪ and therefore, they obteine it: as Solo∣mon doeth signifie it, saying, The foolishe doe inherite follie. It is not of late, but of old: as it is heere signified after a sorte by the preterperfectence of the verbe which Solomon in his language vseth, saying, They haue in∣herited. And so this inheritance is come or descended from father
to sonne, and hath beene more carefully kept, than if it had beene any good thing. But suche is the nature of man, when hee is left vnto himselfe, that hee is rather geuen to vanitie, then to any profitable woorke, rather to follie, then to wisedome, and is more delighted with ignorance then with knowledge. Wherefore he is wel woorthie to inherite nothing that excelleth: and they which folowe him can gather no profite thereby, sith hee hath nothing but follie: for a man can not take that of his heritage which it hath not. Let vs therfore first vnderstād that we are here admonished not ea∣sily to beleeue all kind of words, and to suffer ourselues to be decei∣ued Pro. 1. 26. as fooles: for of such simplicitie or lightnesse, there can come but folly, which is not onely vnprofitable, but also hurtfull. Second∣ly, let vs not greatly desire the companie of the foolish, and to gette their acquaintance and familiarite: for sith they possesse nothing that is ought worth, we can haue nothing but hinderance to keepe them company, though there were no other euill but this, that wee loose our time amongst them, except we rebuke, chide and threaten them, as they deserue: partly to declare that we will not communi∣cate with their vnfruitefull workes of darkenes: partly, for to labor to bring them againe to a sounde vnderstanding, that they may bee turned away from folly, and to giue themselues vnto wisdom, for to be discrete and well gouerned. By this meanes they shall not come to be blamed nor shamed for their folly, but to bee magnified and honoured. Solomon doeth pronounce it, when he saieth; but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. As good worldly hus∣bandes doe labour to get and to haue their possessions and hereta∣ges about them, and do therin greatly delight, for to see their hou∣ses to be compassed round aboute with goodly fieldes, meddowes and vineyards and other earthly commodities: and when they can safely keepe and defend their goods, they are praised and honoured of the worlde, and esteemed as young kinges: euen so the prudent which do spiritually labour, which are gouerned by the leading of Pro. 13. 16. the holy Ghost, and worke all by knowledge, do so abounde in the same, that they are therefore in great estimation and account with them, which do abhor foolishnes & loue knowledge, & whatsoeuer is done and ruled therby. After this sorte are the prudent crowned with knowledge:
aud it is veey meete so to vnderstande it. For the Scripture hath a crowne, and also vseth to giue a crowne, for ornaments of glory, ho∣nour, and magnificence, & also for abundance: as it is said, He hath spoyled mee of mine honour, and taken the crowne away from my head. For thou hast made him little lower, then God, and crowned Iob. 19. 9. Psal. 8. 6. & 21. 4. & 5. 43. & 65. 12. & 103. 4 him with glory and worship, &c. For abundance. Euen as it is said of the foolishe that they inherite folly, because they haue nothing else about them, & that for this very cause they are cōtemned: euen so it is saide of the prudent, they are crowned with knowledge, be∣cause that the same is abūdantly shewed foorth both in their words and deedes: this is the cause, and why they are esteemed. And that wee bee not deceiued in this worde knowledge, let vs not thinke to be prudent, when wee haue muche read and reteined humane sci∣ences: for humane sciences are but vanitie and folly of themselues, and doe nothing serue but to puffe vp a man, & to make him boast and bragge, which is great folly. But then are we wise and crowned with knowledge, when wee giue our mindes and wittes vnto the worde of the Lorde, following after his wil, studiyng diligently and faithfully euery one in his vocation. Moreouer, let vs first note, that albeit the state of the faithful, which are discrete and wel ru∣led, is bace and naught set by before the worlde, yet before GOD (who giueth them the crowne of knowledge) they are in a kingly state: whereof that wee may bee partakers, let vs followe this ex∣hortation of Saint Paule: Brethren, bee not children in vnderstan∣ding, but as concerning maliciousnes, be children, but in vnderstan∣ding 1. Cor. 1420. bee of a ripe age. If very constantly wee followe this exhor∣tation, and that wee ceasse not to perseuer (for all the temptations which happen) tyl wee come vnto vnitie of faith: after the crowne Ephe. 4. 13. Iam. 1. 12. of knowledge, wee shal obteine the crowne of life. Secondarily, let vs note that as a crowne is set vpon the head, that it may bee seene: euen so God crowneth the prudent with knowledge, not that they should hide their talent in the earth: but that they should bring it foorth to light and open shewe, by sounde doctrine and 1. Pet. 2. 9. good workes: for euen therefore are they crowned kings. And heerein wee must perseuer, what persecution soeuer is raised vp a∣gainst 1. Tim. 2. 11. 12. vs. For this is a true saying. For if we bee dead together with
him, wee also shal liue together with him. If wee suffer, we shal also raigne together with him: 19 The euil shal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous. It seemeth at the first sight that this present sentence repugneth diuers proofes and experiences. For first of al, Caine was wic∣ked: eu. 4. 8. & 13. 13. & 19. 4. 2, Pet. 2. 7. & 27. 41. & 37. 23. 28. and so farre was it of, that hee woulde bowe before iust Abel, that rather hee rose vp against him, and slue him. Secondly, the people of Sodome were wicked: and they greatly stroue against Lot who was righteous. Thirdly, Ismael scorneth Isaack. Fourth∣ly, Esau hated Iacob. Fifthly, the sonnes of Iacob spoyleth Ioseph their brother of his precious garment, and solde him. And al∣waies wee haue seene the wicked after the outwarde apparance to bee stronger and higher in authoritie, and to giue no reuerence to the good, but to esteeme them as doung and filth, to reiect and per∣secute thē, for to kil and vtterly to destroy them. And also our Lord saith vnto his Disciples: Blessed are they which suffer for righteous∣nesse sake. If the worlde hate you, knowe it hated mee before you. They shal excommunicate you out of their Synagogues. Again, In the worlde yee shal haue affliction, but bee of good cheere, I haue Mat. 5. 10. Iohn. 15. 18. & 16. 2. 33. ouercome the worlde. I answere, albeit, for the exercise of the faithful, and to trie their patience, God doeth suffer the wicked to rise vp against them, contemne them and molest them: yet neuer∣thelesse at the time appointed, and when hee shall see meete, hee will beate downe the arrogancie of the wicked, and suppresse their furie and crueltie, and subdue them vnto the good and righteous. Esau had surely thought to haue slaine Iacob: but hee came to re∣ceiue him. The king of Sodome went to meete Abraham: And Gen. 33. 4. & 14. 27. & 42. 9. the brethreu of Ioseph came and bowed before Ioseph, &c. Then Pharao called Moses & Aaron, and saide, pray ye vnto the Lord, that hee may take away the frogges from mee, and from my people, and I willet the people goe, that they may doe sacrifice vnto the Lorde. Exod. 8. 8. & 12. 36. Iosu. 2, 12. 9. 25. The Lorde gaue the people fauour before the Egyptians, &c. Rahab, besought the spies. &c. And the Gebonites became the seruants of
Iosuah of the people of Israel. To bee shorte, the people of Israel, who for the most part were wicked, was constrained to bow before Moses, Iosua, the Iudges, Kinges, and Prophetes. Saule humbled himselfe vnto Dauid, when hee confessed and acknowledged his innocencie and righteousnesse. The wicked doe now also reuerence 1. Sam. 24. 1 the good, when the iudges and Magistrates know howe to humble the sworde of iustice: and when by the preaching of the worde, they are confounded, and haue their mouthes fast stopped, or els that they returne from their wickednesse by true repentance sub∣mitting themselues to the exhortations and instructions that are made vnto them by the worde of the Lorde: in following that Heb. 13. 17. which is saide, Obey thē that haue the ouersight of you, & submit yourselues. Therefore this present sentence is true, vpon the which let vs first note, that the iudgements in the olde time were holden in the gates: & thither men came for to obey iustice. For this cause for to declare howe the wicked are constrained to submit them∣selues, and to giue obedience vnto the righteous: Solomon saith, that they bowe at the gates of the righteous. Secondly, foras∣muche as wee must chiefly bowe vnto kinges and gouernours, they are heere admonished to lay aside al malice, to flie al iniustice, and to Rom. 13. 13. 1. Pet. 2. 13. giue themselues vnto goodnesse, and to shewe themselues truely iust, in rendering to euery man. &c. And if any do fal away and be∣come dissolute and rebellious, as there are which wil not encline to them, and wil not obey them as they ought, let them then knowe, either that God wil trie their forces & boldnesse, and whether they bee of good courage to withstande the wicked, and to suppresse their insolencies: either that God doeth punishe them, because they apply not themselues vnto goodnesse and iustice as they ought. Therefore when any insurrections are, let the Magistrates hum∣ble themselues before GOD, weeping and lamenting their faultes: and yet for al this to loose no courage, but manly to vse the sworde which is committed vnto them. Thirdly wee are ad∣monished what kinde of men wee ought to place in authoritie. Fourthly, albeit that the wil of GOD bee (as it appeareth heere) that the wicked shoulde bowe before the good, yet is it not too say that wee shoulde desire men to bow and kneele before vs,
but so much as is required for the honour and glory of God, for the common peace, and for the order of pollicie. For our goodnesse and righteousnesse can neuer bee so excellent, that it should deserue that men shoulde bowe and reuerence vs. Fiftly, sith that vnto God the king euerlasting belongeth all honour and glory, and that it is before him that euery knee shoulde bowe, wee must therefore vn∣derstande that he maketh his Maiestie shine at the gates of the righ∣teous, when hee maketh the wicked to bowe before them. And for asmuch also as hee greatly esteemeth the good and righteous, when he maketh them partakers of the glory, which apperteineth vnto him onely: it is therfore a true argument that hee woulde haue vs highly to esteeme goodnesse and righteousnesse. 20 The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many. Solomon pronounceth heere that which is commonly doone in the worlde, and not that which ought to bee doone. And so hee doeth not giue vs doctrine that wee must follow: but hee accuseth men of ingratitude, of discourtesie and crueltie, when hee saith, The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour. The ingratitude which is committed in the hate of the poore is against God. For whosoeuer hateth the poore, hee doeth not acknowledge the bene∣fites which hee hath receiued of God, without his desertes. Wee are al naturally borne poore both in body and soule, and are voide and naked of all benefites, and cannot obteine either corporal or spiritual, vnlesse God of his onely grace and free goodnesse doe giue them vs without hauing respect vnto vs: for wee are so cor∣rupted and malitious of nature, that wee prouoke him so muche as wee can to make vs poore, and to destroy vs rather then to doe vs good, and saue vs. First of all, touching our body, if wee consider our conception in the wombe of our mother, wee shal knowe, how poore a thing wee are: that wee were very weake and sickly, and that wee coulde haue no nourishment nor increase but of God: for seeing the gouernment of mothers, which is then very disordered, and their lustes vnbrideled, immediately man should perishe, if God did not wonderfully as it were preserue and fortifie him. This poore
state of man, and the helpe of God are wel expressed in Iob. And when wee are borne wee bring no riches with vs. If wee haue any necessay and profitable thing for this body, it is the gift of God: as Iob. 10 8. & 1. 21. 1. Tim. 6. 7. Mat. 6. 11. 25 wee confesse when we aske our dayly bread. And our Lorde doeth reache it vs, when hee woulde not haue vs to take care for this life. Secondly, as touching our soule, wee are no better furnished then was Dauid, who confesseth, Beholde, I was borne in iniquitie, and in sinne hath my mother conceiued mee: And Paul saith, That wee were by nature the children. Therefore if wee be partakers of the spiritual and heauenly riches, it commeth of the grace and Psal. 51. 6. Ephes. 2. 3. 4. Psal. 24. 1. & 50. 12. gift of God, as Saint Paul doth pronounce afterwardes. Now the Lorde making vs prtakers of his benefites (for al is his) would haue vs to confesse the goodnesse and liberalitie that hee bestoweth vp∣on vs. The which wee cannot truely doe: except wee submit our¦selues wholy to obey the commandementes of his wil, which is, that the riches which hee giueth vs, we shoulde vse them as good disposers of them, distributing by loue vnto thē which haue neede. Let there bee no poore man amongest you. Againe, When one of thy brethren with thee is fallen into pouertie, thou shalt lende him. Deu. 15. 4. 7. 7. 10. Again, Thou shalt giue him, and let it not greeue thine heart to giue vn to him. See that thou deale thy bread to the hungrie, &c. If we be not diligent to followe this wil, we are vnthankeful vnto God, considering the bountifulnesse hee vseth towardes vs. Vn∣gentlenesse Esa. 58. 7. and crueltie is made manifest, in the hatred of the poore: For hee that hateth his neigbour is a manslear: and that is because hee exerciseth not the charitie hee ought. They then that charge & burden their neighbours with impostes, vsuries, and oppressions, which doe molest them with lawe and other wronges to destroy them, are heere righly accused of churlishnesse and crueltie. Besides 1. Iohn. 3. 1. the said accusatiō, Solomon doth shew that it is a very miserable thing to be poore, except we can patiently beare it, and do not feare what man can doe vnto vs. As touching the second part of this pre∣sent sentence, which is, But the freendes of the riche are many: Solomon doth not rebuke and blame those which are truely the freendes of the rich: for it is not lawful for vs to hate any man, but it is rather com∣manded vs to loue our neighbours, without regarde of persons.
Likewise they which truely loue the riche, doe not procure to them¦selues any profite to their purse: but if it bee needeful, doe ex∣horte them to occupie themselues about their saluation, in giuing almes to the needie, according to the doctrine of our Lorde, and of Luke. 6. 9 2. Cor. 8. 7. &. 9. 6. 1. Tim. 6. 17 Iam. 2. 1 Saint Paule. But hee accuseth the worlde of flatterie, of accep∣ting of persons and of couetousnesse. They which thus behaue themselues towardes the rich, are called their freendes: not that they are so indeede, but because they seeme so to bee, and woulde bee counted suche. 21 The sinner despiseth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is blessed. Solomon doeth shewe vs that the worlde is ful of sinners, when hee saith, The sinner dispiseth his neighbour: for it is an or∣dinary thing, that they which haue welth, and do not acknowledge that that which they enioy, commeth of the gift of God, do great∣ly flatter themselues, & think that it cōmeth of their owne labour, trauaile, wisedome, and cunning, that riches come vnto them, they confesse not that they bee stewardes of God, but make them¦selues beleeue that it is lawful for them to doe as they list with the goods they possesse: and therefore they haue no care of the needi∣nesse of their neighbours, but doe despise them, as they doe shewe it in diuers sortes. First of al, in not helping their necessities by almes. Secondly, in vsing subtil meanes, to drawe vnto them that little they haue. Thirdly, in pulling their substance from them par∣force and violence, or consuming them by sutes, by vsuries and o∣ther wicked trades. So that the contempt which is heere spoken of, doeth not onely stand in negligence, but in churlishnesse and cruelty that they commonly exercise through all the worlde, as men doe feele it. Wherefore it is not without cause that the Scripture complai∣neth hereof, euē through al the Prophets. This crueltie is somwhat Eze. 22. 29. signified, when it is not saide that the sinner doeth despise strangers and vnknowne, his enimies and aduersaries: but it is said that he despiseth his neighbour: that is to say, him of whome hee ought
to take care and compassion, and to helpe him by loue in his neces∣sities. The crueltie also is signified by the Antithesis that Solomon Luke. 10. 3▪ maketh heere, when he saith: But he that hath mercy on the poore, is blessed. For against despising, hee setteth mercy, which is contrary vnto crueltie. For by crueltie men spoyle and rauishe, and doe all the hurt they can in the worlde to their neighbour: and by mercy, wee lende, and giue libe∣rally, as also the worde which Solomon vseth doth signifie. And when the merciful man is set against the sinner, then doeth it shew vs that albeit by the corruptiō of our fleshe, sinne, dwelleth in vs: yet is not the same imputed vnto vs, nor wee counted sinners but righteous, so long as wee are mercifull. The wicked borroweth, and payeth not againe: but the righteous is merciful and gi∣ueth. Psal. 37. 21 &. 112. 5. 9. Againe, A good man is merciful and lendeth: he hath distributed and giuen to the poore, &c. Not that our mercifulnesse can de∣serue such reputation: but because God of his onely grace doeth accept and allowe it, and is authour thereof. It is not simply saide, that hath mercy: for they which are at their ease, and haue all thinges necessary for them, haue no neede of mercy to bee shewed to them: and therefore Solomon addeth, on the poore. These are they which haue great neede to bee pitied: as also God doeth carefully wil the same by his worde, and it is not without cause: for they haue the most neede of fauour, succour, and helpe: and there are no people in the world more despised, worse handeled, nor more troden downe and oppressed then are they. By experience wee may see it: and also God often complaineth thereof, by his Prophetes. Therefore if it happen vs to fal into the number of the miserable, & afflicted, and that wee are despised, yet let vs not bee discouraged, nor dispaire, as though God had forsaken vs, and careth not for vs. For if wee be despised, it is of sinners who are not acquainted with GOD. But looke what sinners doe esteeme, that is reiected of GOD, and that which they doe despise and reiect, is re∣ceiued and allowed of God. Therefore we must not feare the con∣tempt Psal. 3. 5. of the worlde, nor yet be coupled with sinners, for to consent with them to despise the afflicted, when wee feele ourselues at our
ease, and haue prosperitie: otherwise it woulde turne to our woe. Solomon doeth not heere signifie it, when hee promiseth blessing vnto them that are merciful vnto the afflicted. This blessing shal Luk. 24. & 16. 22. not onely continue in this worlde, but for euer: as also shal the woe of the wicked. And albeit that prosperitie and felicitie is promised vnto our mercy, yet is it not enough to obteine such blessing: but because that GOD receiueth and alloweth it, Psal. 41. 2. Mat. 25. 34. & 5. 7. because wee are elected before all time, and hath prepared for vs this blessing before the beginning or foundation of the world was laide. 22 Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, shall bee mercy and trueth. Forasmuch as the worlde is ful of men which imagine malice, and which deuise euil thinges against God, and against their neigh∣bours, it followeth right well that the number is right great of them which hold not the right way, but doe erre and goe astray, folow∣ing the wayes of destruction. Solomon doth signifie this same, whē hee asketh, saying: Doe not they erre which imagine euill? And forasmuche as there is none of vs al which desireth to erre, that is to say, to goe astray, and wander out of the way, but woulde al walke in a right path, and come vnto the ende of our purpose, and not to bee put beside our intentes, except wee bee out of our wittes, voide of sounde iudgement, and perfect reason: sith I say wee desire the same, or at the leastwise doe labour to make ourselues beleeue that our wil is such: therfore for to obteine the same, wee must diligent∣ly take heede that wee followe not them which imagine euil. And for to doe this let vs not bee like vnto the superstitious and idola∣ters, which forge idols, some of wood, golde and siluer, or of other visible, palpable and grosse matter: othersome, of traditions and mens inuentions, good customes, fantasies and intentes. They de∣uise and imagine nothing but euil, though they falsly beleeue that by suche trashe and ab homination, they do honour and serue God.
But the Lorde, whome no good thing can displease, doth wel shew, that there is nothing but euil in such seruice, when hee declareth, that he abhorreth and reiecteth them: as it is wel taught vs by the first table of Moyses, and by the Prophetes. They make themselues Esay. 29. 1. & 40. 18. & 41. 6. & 44. 9. beleeue that they serue GOD, heerein they fayle and knowe not what they doe, so at the last they shalbe confounded: The Idola∣ters shal not inherite the kingdome of heauen. Secondarily, let vs not ioyne with these mockers and scorners, which boldly despyse and blaspheme God and his doctrine: as though that were but fa∣bles and dreames, which the Pastours and Ministers of the Churche doe preache to them. Such kinde of people are imaginers of euill, when they fight against God, who is enemie vnto al euil, and when they set his holy lawe (which is the rule of al goodnesse, so much as possible they can) at nought. In the which doing, they doe greatly erre, and are farre wyde: as appeareth by this saying: Wo vnto them that seeke deepe, to hide their counsel from the Lorde, Esay. 2. 15. &c. Such men thinke, or at the least labour to make themselues beleeue, that there is neither God, nor Deuil, neither heauen nor hel: but at the last they shal feele that they haue erred. For the cruel man shall cease, and the scornefull shalbee consumed. Therefore will I choose out their delusions, and I will bring their feare vppon them, because I called, and none woulde an∣swere, Esay. 66. 4. &c. Thirdly, let vs not thinke that in hurting and dooing euill vnto our neighbours wee can prosper: though the greatest parte of the worlde bee of this opinion. For as we may see, some thinke to creepe aloft by pryde and ambition, by rebellion and disobe∣dience: some by murthers, seditions, hatreds, malice, and insurre∣ctions: some by theftes, snatching, vsurie, and wicked bargaines: some by whoredomes and adulteries, and other some by flatte∣ries, false tales and slaunderings. But they erre and be deceiued, seeing they turne themselues from the right wayes of the com∣mandementes of the Lorde, and folowe the wyde and broade way Math. 7. 1. which leadeth to destruction. This destruction is wel signified by errour, and also by the Antithesis that Solomon maketh, when hee sayeth,
But to them that thinke on good thinges, shalbee mercie and trueth. When hee speaketh thus, hee debyeth mercy and truth vn∣to those that imagine euil. Wherevpon it foloweth that they can∣not looke but for destruction and damnation partly in this worlde. For as they are filled with malice, craft, deceit, wrong, violence and crueltie against GOD and their neighbours: euen so doeth God render and pay them the like, stirring vp enemies against them, euen such as they haue beene to others. And finally, for to fyl vp the mea∣sure of their destruction, he wil vtterly depriue them of his fauour & mercie, bestowing no parte of his gracious promises vpon them and wil sende them to eternal damnation. Contrarily, vnto them which thinke wel, that is to say, which haue set their loue on the lawe of the Lord, for to giue him the ho∣nour which hee damandeth thereby, and for to serue & profit their neighbours, shalbe graunted mercy and trueth. For as they labour to be faythful vnto God, by giuing true obedience vnto his worde, and beeing gentle vnto their neighbours, giuing them faithfully all their duetie: euen so the Lorde wil make them partakers of his true and vnfallible promises: he wil raise them vp, according as they shal haue neede, such men as wil shewe them fauour, and intreate them with al meekenesse and gentlenesse, & such as wil imagine no trea∣son or other wickednesse against them: neither shal cease to doe thē good, according to his faythful and gracious promises, vntil that in the heauenly ioy and felicitie he giue thē the ful fruition of thē. For his merciful kindnesse is euer more and more towardes vs: and the Psa. 117. 2. truth of the Lord endureth for euer. Let vs note that Solomon doth not preache vnto vs the merite of our workes, when he promiseth mercy & truth vnto them which thinke good things: but he would haue vs while we giue ourselues vnto goodnes that we should not praise our thoughts & operations, as though there were any wor∣thinesse or excellencie in vs, which might moue or binde God to do vs good. But that we should stay ourselues vpon the gentlenes, goodnesse, or mercy of the Lord, by the which only, he is moued to loue vs, & to do vs good according to his gracious promises, in the performing wherof he sheweth the truth of his grace only, & not for to giue vs that which our workes do deserue: for he can owe vs Rom. 4. 13.
nothing. For the promise was not made vnto Abraham to bee the heyre of the worlde by the lawe, but by the righteousnes of fayth. Rom. 3. 24. 25. &. 15. 2. 2. Cor. 1. 20. Secondly, let vs note, that Solomon is heere no lawe giuer, but an Euangelist, leading vs vnto Iesus Christ. For we obteine no mercy, but by him only. For the promises of God are yea and amenin him. 23 In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want. Solomon heere before hath spoken many sentences, for to ex∣horte Pro. 6. 6. &. 10. 45. &. 12. 11. 27. 13. 4. 11. 23. & 14. 4. Gene. 3. 1. vs vnto care and diligence, vnto labour and trauaile. And if wee were such as we ought to bee, to wit, very careful to obey the word of the Lorde, and willing to beare the burthen which hee lay∣eth vpon vs: Solomon shoulde not haue needed to haue pronoun∣ced these sentences. But because we are like vnto asses, which make no diligent speede, except they bee often beaten: and vnto restie iades which when they are spurred, runne backwarde, except the ri∣ders doe pricke them sharply with the spurre, with stroke vppon stroke: for this cause, Solomon doeth exhorte vs nowe againe to la∣bour: when he saith, In al labour there is abundance. It seemeth at the first sight that Solomon repugneth that which is written, The earth shall bring foorth vnto thee, thornes and thistles, and thou shalt eate the herbe of the fielde. When thou shalt til the grounde, it shall not hencefoorth yeelde vnto thee her strength. And I wil breake the Gene. 3. 18. &. 4. 12. Leui. 26. 19. 20. Deut. 28. 16 pride of your power, and I wil make your heauen as yron & your earth as brasse. And your strength shalbe spent in vaine, &c. Againe, Cursed shalt thou be in the towne, and cursed also in the fielde, &c. And this same which is pronounced in these scriptures, commeth often to passe, as experience sheweth it. I answere, That Solo∣mon speaketh of the nature of labour, and of that which natu∣rally happeneth, so that wee doe not hinder it by our ingratitude, infidelitie, idolatrie, superstition, rebellion, disobedience, pride, vn∣gentlenes, crueltie, and other wickednes, wherewith the worlde is wholy infected & corrupted. Hee doeth then teache vs, that if wee hate, detest and abhorre al kinde of wickednesse, wee walke in the
feare of God reuerencing his woorde, by putting our whole trust in his goodnesse, and to folowe his wil, that GOD will blesse our labour, and make vs abounde in wealth, and whatsoeuer wee take in hande, or apply our mindes and spirite vnto, shal pros∣per. Heerein hee speaketh agreeably vnto that which the Sainte haue felt, and according as God hath promised in his lawe and by the Prophets. The Patriarkes were blessed of God, who prospered their labour and the woorke of their handes: in such wise that they did abounde in riches. And the promises are written in the places alledged before, and in the 128. Psalme. And albeeit that in Psal. 128. the sight of the eyes wee iudge not that there is abundance in the labour of them which feare God: for oftentimes the same accidents happened to them as to the wicked: & also they are robbed, or their Eccle. 9. 2. hire is keepe from them, or else they are contented with a little gaine: Neuerthelesse, the labour changeth not his nature, and GOD is true in his promises, after the which wee must not giue them abundance, the which doeth not alwaies consist in super∣fluitie, nor in multitude of great riches of this worlde: but chiefly in contentation, and in this that God knoweth to bee expedient. For the same doeth better furnish, and is also of greater profit, then greater abundance of the wicked. Furthermore, though they which feare GOD and are diligent in labour, shoulde suffer greate want, yet is it not to say but that God is true in his promises: for howe much soeuer we feare God, yet doeth hee alwaies finde ynough in vs to bee amended, and may iustly chasten vs as hee pleaseth. Therefore let vs not iudge of Gods promises after mans reason, nor after the sight of our eyes: but let euery one of vs carefully and faythfully occupie himselfe in his woorke, praying vnto GOD that it woulde please him to giue it good successe and prospering it as hee shal knowe to bee expedient. And let vs not bee like vnto those which giue themselues vnto slouthfulnesse and ydlenes, to vanitie and foolishnes, and passe away their time in iesting and scoffing in merie tales, and ydle woordes: and yet notwithstanding, they desire abundance to liue plentifully and wealthily, and at their
ease, as if they were wel woorthy. But they doe not obteine according to their desire: for euen as they deserue, God bringeth them vnto extreeme pouertie. Solomon doeth signifie it when hee sayth, But the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want: When hee setteth the talke of the lippes, against labour, and that hee threate∣neth it with want, let vs knowe that vnder the talke of the lippes, hee comprehendeth not thanksgiuing, prayers, prayses, holy exhor∣tations and instructions which the faythful make with their lippes: for sith they proceede from a pure and perfite heart, they ought not to bee attributed vnto the lippes, nor threatened with want. For, for such holy exercises the faythful wil not giue ouer nor forsake la∣bour. But yet that popish diuine seruice, and al the disputations and sermons of their diuines and hypocrites, ought to bee attributed vnto the talke of the lippes: seeing they proceede not from a good Rom. 10. 17. 18. 1. Tim. 6. 3. 4. 5. 2. Thes. 3. 6. Phi. 3. 18. 19. hart, nor sounde iudgement: for they knowe not what they say: they are led with curiousnesse, tending vnto ostentation and vaineglory, not desiring to serue Iesus Christ, but their belly. Such rakehelles doe worthily deserue to want and perishe for hunger, and not on∣ly with temporal hunger, but doe deserue eternal damnation. 24 The crowne of the wise is their riches: and the follie of fooles is foolishnesse. It is a thing more often prooued then were to bee wished, that they are nothing set by which haue nothing or very litle: and they which cannot or doe not labour to gather riches abundantly, are iudged fooles and dizzardes. But they which are riche, are highly honoured and praised: the which causeth them to be so greatly de∣sired of al men. For besides this that men are glad not to want, they also loue to bee in estimation and honour: and they that can so guide themselues, are counted wise, and men of honestie. Where∣too it seemeth at the first sight that Solomon agreeth heere, when he saith, The crowne of the wise, &c. But if we consider the thing throughly, wee shal easily see that Solomon is not of this iudge∣ment and opinion. For hee saith not generally, riches: as if it beho∣ued
the wise, for to haue glorie and honour, to bee riche with the abundance of worldly wealth: seeing that they which are truely wise, doe despise and reiect the wealth of the worlde, and doe ga∣ther it, but onely meanely for to get their dayly bread, without a disordered desire, with dooing wrong vnto their neighbour, ey∣ther by catching, or by too great sparing and niggardlinesse. But hee saieth, their riches: that is to say, the riches which belong vn∣to the wise, and by the which they become truely riche. Therefore for to vnderstande what is meant by the crowne of the wise, wee must knowe what their riches are. Solomon hath shewed vs heere before, that the feare of the Lorde is wisedome, knowledge, and Pro. 1. 5. 8. 9. & 2. 1. &. 3. 13 & 4. 5. & 8. 10 11. 14. & 10 14. & 14. 18. vnderstanding. Such kinde of riches are the chiefe crowne of the wise. And yet if they abounde in the riches of this worlde, as the holy olde Fathers did, they are also their crowne: for with wise∣dome can they possesse them, and spende them as neede requireth. Now that by their riches Solomon chiefly meaneth the former ver∣tues, hee doeth shewe it, by the Antithesis hee maketh, when hee saieth, And the follie of fooles is foolishnesse. For hee setteth follie, (which is contrarie vnto wisedome) against the riches of the wyse: as if he saide, The follie of fooles cannot bee, nor knowen but for follie, the which is so detestable as none dare challenge the same to bee his: albeit that she is as an Empresse in the worlde, and that the great Emperours, Kings, and Princes doe obey her, and make their pleasures of it: as they doe shewe, when they take it not in good parte, that any man should turne them from it to bring them vnto wisedome: but they hate and cruelly persecute the wise. And yet for al this they wil not bee counted fooles, but wil bee praysed and honoured as wise, and knowe wel, howe to mainteine their ho∣nour, as they thinke, when they prayse themselues more then God. For if any of them doe neuer so grieuously offende God, they care not for it: but if a man chance to speake of their worship or Lord∣ship, otherwise then they woulde, that man hath committed, in their iudgement an vnpardonable offence. Al these kindes of doing doe wel shewe that naturally wee al praise and extol wisedom: but by the corruption of our nature wee haue a wrong iudgement: in such wise that wee iudge wisedome, to bee follie, and doe extol fol∣lie Esay. 5. 2. 21
in steade of wisedome, the which is no smal offence. As tou∣ching the rest, as the wise doe vse the riches that God giueth them, as they ought, and therein doe declare their wisedome, for the which they be praised: euen so the foolish, which know not or will not know, for what vse God hath created the riches of this worlde, do vse them with al intemperancie and dissolution, or with great a∣uarice doe make more spare then needeth, fearing least the worlde woulde fayle them. And thus do they declare their follie, the which doth dishonor & make them contēptible before the eyes of them which haue a right iudgement: as they wel deserue, not onely for that they rule themselues as fooles and dizzardes, hurting them∣selues by too much prodigalitie or nigardlinesse, but chiefly by that that they are vngentle and cruel: seeking nothing but the hurte of their neighbours: although that at the first sight it seemeth not so, & also that they are persuaded, it is not yll done to vse their wealth at their pleasure. They are easily perswaded theretoo, when wealth commeth in as they woulde, and that they prosper after a worldly manner. For then they cannot peaceably and reasonably vse their cōmodities: but the flesh which feeleth too much of his ease, doth ouerflowe and play the foole: as wee haue seene the people of Israel to haue done. The people sat downe to eate and to drinke, and rose Exo. 32. 6. Deut. 32. 15. vp againe to play. And Moyses doeth blame them for it: but hee that should haue beene vpright, when hee waxed fat, spurned with his heele. Wee may nowe see the same chiefly in Kings and Princes, to whome it seemeth, that what they haue, is rightly dewe to them, & wil neither knowe nor vnderstande that the glory, power & riches they haue, come from God, and that it is a singular gift of GOD, euen his woorke, for a man to rule wel in these matters. In this sort they forget God and their neighbours, and doe exalt themselues, not caring whome they hurte. It is inough for them to be at their ease, and to bee earnest to punishe and torment others: as Saule did to Dauid. 25 A faythful witnesse deliuereth soules: but a deceiue speaketh lyes. There is none that beareth good wil but desireth to pleasure
his neighbours, and wee thinke that wee al haue this desire, and wee make ourselues beleeue so much as wee can, wee woulde not leaue them in necessitie, but to deliuer them as we are able, euen out of the greatest necessities, for to shew and for to be counted their great friendes. Nowe the greatest good turne that wee can doe for any man, is to helpe to saue his life: as it is very plaine. For there is no man which had not rather loose al his goods, then to loose his life. But because euery man knoweth not the way how to proceede to saue his neighbours life, therefore Solomon doeth teache it vs, when he saith, A faythful witnesse deliuereth soules. And forasmuch as there is none but God only which is true, vnlesse hee communicate his trueth by his woorde, wee cannot doe this pleasure vnto our neighbours, to saue their liues, except we be diligent to receiue the woorde to speake after it, and to giue ourselues to doe the workes which it teacheth vs. This is the way which wee must holde for to bee a true witnesse. But albeit there is but this one way, yet may wee shewe ourselues true witnesses in diuers sortes. If being called in iudgement for to beare witnesse of the trueth, or beeing ordei∣ned iudges, wee speake trueth: although that vpon our deposition, othe or sentence, they leade our neighbour to the gallowes, and that hee be hanged, yet doe we not cease to be true witnesses, and to de∣liuer soules. For when Solomon speaketh of the deliuerance of soules, hee meaneth the innocent who are wrongfully troubled, & are in danger of their liues, except that God rayse them vp true wit∣nesses. And also when wee witnesse, or speake truth against the wic∣ked for to sende him to death: though wee saue not his life, yet doe wee not cease to bee a true witnesse, and to saueliues. For in purcha∣sing the punishement of the wicked, wee are cause that diuers doe liue in peace and rest: and thus doe we preserue and saue liues: the which is a very acceptable thing before God, who wil haue the Ma∣gistrate Deut. 17. 6. Rom. 13. 3. 1. Tim. 2. 2. to punish the malefactor vppon the othe of twoo or three witnesses, that the euil being purged, wee might liue in peace. Now if the Lorde be careful of such corporal and temporal sauing and preseruing, let vs vnderstande that by a farre stronger reason hee ta∣keth care for the spiritual and eternal sauing of liues: as hee hath al∣wayes shewed, when hee hath raysed vp true men which haue gi∣uen
themselues to shewe the way of truth vnto his people: as were Noe, Abraham, Loth, Moyses, Iosua, the Iudges, the holy kings and Prophetes. And not content heerewith, hee hath sent his owne Sonne, who not onely was a true and faythful witnes for to preach deliuerance as a minister and seruant: but by himself hath made the purgation of our sinnes, sheadding his most precious blood for the eternal redemption of our soules. And if the deliuerance of our Heb. 1. 3. & 9. 12. Rom. 8. 32. soules be so precious before God, that he hath not spared his owne Sonne, it foloweth therefore that we must be careful thereof before al other things: otherwise we are great contemners of God, and re∣noūce to be saued & redeemed by Iesus Christ: the which is to do him greate iniurie, and consequently to put our soules in bondage with the Deuil, for to loose them and not to deliuer and saue them. Nowe for to be careful of our deliuerance, we must as Iesus Christ hath sent vs his Apostles and disciples for to be true witnesses vnto vs, and asmuch as lay in their ministerie, haue deliuered vs from death and damnation: euen so stil nowe wee shoulde demande of him such Pastours and ministers, which wil bee true witnesses, who wil declare nothing vnto vs but the pure woorde of God, to the which if wee cleaue by fayth and repentance, they shal deliuer our soules. But if in steede heereof, wee haue itching eares, let vs looke 2. Tim. 4. 3. for bondage and destruction: as Solomon doeth signifie, when hee saith, But a deceiuer speaketh lyes. Forasmuch as he setteth the de∣ceiuer against a true witnesse, and lyes against deliuerance, hee tea∣cheth vs that false witnesses seeke nothing else but to holde their neighbours captiue, and to destroy them: folowing therein their father the Deuil, who from the beginning, hath beene a lyer and a murtherer. But as they are the most profitable witnesses, which Iohn. 8. 44. preach vnto vs Iesus Christ: euen so the most exquisite deceiuers are they which vnder the shadowe of religion doe set foorth mens traditions, and doctrines of Deuils, vaine speculations and subtill questions. For such, so much as they can, doe shut vp the kingdome of heauen from men, and doe deliuer them vnto the Deuil. And the other deceiuers doe bring hurt either vnto our goods, or to our name, or to this present life, the which is but a small damage in comparison of the losse of our soules. Neuerthelesse the worlde is so much giuen vnto temporal riches, and maketh so great account
of his good name and loueth this life so wel, that he careth nothing for his saluation, and feareth more the deceiuers which bring tem∣porall hurte, then those which destroy them for euer: yea hee is so blinde that he honoreth them. 26 In the feare of the Lorde is an assured strength, and his children shall haue hope. It is a great comfort for vs, when we thinke that our neigh∣boures are so wel affectionate towardes vs, that we may trust them that they wil not labour to doe vs any hurte, but shewe vs al fauour pleasure, and gentlenes. Nowe forasmuch as al men are lyers and their helpe vayne, and that there is none but God onely true, and that hope onely in him confoundeth not: in as much as hee neuer fayleth to graunt as he requireth: wee must therefore conclude that they which trust in him, shal not loose their hope. If we may once knowe his good affection towardes vs, and so trust in him, assuring ourselues that he would vs nothing but good, we should be ther∣by a greate deale more be comforted then with all the good opini∣ons wee can conceiue of men. For let the man bee neuer so wise or good, yet is hee vnconstant and mutable: but God is faythfull Num. 23. 19. Esay. 55. 8. 9 10. 11. and changeth not his mynde. But to the ende that we conceiue not a vayne consolation, falsely beleeuing that we haue a strong hope in God when we haue but a light opinion of his promises, and yet wil giue ourselues licence to doe after our owne fantasie, and are bold to folow our good intentes, or to liue in al dissolutenes after the affection of our corrupt nature, the which demandeth nothing but libertie of the fleshe, to the ende (I say) that wee conceiue not this vayne consolation, Solomon doeth teach vs, where wee shall finde strong hope, when he saith, In the feare of the Lord is an assured strength. If then we wil be assured that God wil not de∣stroy vs, but assist vs and prouide for vs al thinges necessarie, both for our soule and bodie, and will not forsake vs til he hath placed vs in his heauenly kingdome, we must then haue the feare of the Lord as the good olde fathers fearing God stayed themselues vppon him Heb. 11. 4. Psal. 34. 8. & 145. 19. 20 by fayth, as we may see by the historie of their lyfe. We are exhor∣ted to receyue this feare: and also taught what we haue to doe for
to liue therein. And Dauid promiseth saluation to those which feare him. But seing that we cannot strongly trust in God, except we loue him, as he requireth, it might seeme that to haue a strong hope, wee must not then feare: for feare standeth not in loue, I answere, if wee knowe that God loueth vs, wee doe surely trust in him, and wil not feare to present ourselues before him, and are wel disposed & min∣ded 1. Iohn. 4. 18. to tarie the last day of iudgement, being perswaded of the fa∣therly loue of God towards vs, who neuer faileth vs at neede. For perfit loue casteth out feare: yea the feare which terrifieth, trou∣bleth and tormenteth the conscience, causing man to feele himselfe charged and burdened with great burdens of sinne, dare not offer himselfe to God: but doeth feare him, as a theefe that is taken, fea∣reth the presence of the iudge, and trembleth being deliuered into the handes of the hangman for to bee executed. This is the feare which tormenteth, the which is not in his hearte that is perfit in loue, that is to say, which is wel perswaded that God loueth him. So∣lomon doth not speake now of such kinde of feare, but of the same that Dauid teacheth, and which also hath bene often spoken of. So∣lomon calleth the trust which is in this feare, strong, for to aduertise Psal. 34. 1. Pro. 1. 7. & 2. 5. &. 3. 7. & 8. 13. & 9. 1 & 10. 27. & 14. 2. 16. Psal. 34. 8. Esay. 33. 1, 6 vs that it is but vanitie, when without this feare we thinke we trust in God: contrarily, he that feareth God, shal neuer be shaken to fal. For the feare he hath in God, is as an inuincible fortresse. The Angel of the Lorde doeth pitche his tentes rounde about them which feare him, &c. The Lorde is exalted: for hee dwelleth on high: hee hath filled Sion with iudgement and iustice: and there shalbe stabi∣litie of thy time, strength, saluation, wisedome, and knowledge: for the feare of the Lorde shalbe his treasure. Wherein wee may see that the Papistes haue not the feare of the Lorde, when they stande in continual doubte, whither God loue them or not: for they haue no sounde knowledge. After that Solomon hath taught vs that in the feare of the Lorde there is assured strength, hee shew∣eth vs who they bee which haue this trust, and consequently th feare of the Lorde, when hee sayeth, And his children shall haue hope. Forasmuch as the assurance or strong trust is in the feare of the Lorde, and there are none but the children of God which are Psal. 34. 12. exhorted vnto this feare, & none besides thē do receiue it, therfore it foloweth wel, there are none but they which haue assured strēgth.
Therefore if wee desire to bee assured of strong hope, we must then become the children of God to obteine it. The which wee shal ob∣teine, 1. Iohn. 1. 12. if wee receiue Iesus Christ. And although, being the children of God we shal suffer much, and that it shal seeme by the euils that we shal suffer, that God hath reiected vs, and that for this cause we haue good occasion to bee afraide and to be troubled as pore slaues vnder the bondage of a cruel tyrant: neuerthelesse, seeing that ther∣in we are made like vnto the Sonne of God, who hauing borne the shame of the crosse sitteth on the right hande of God, we must bee assured that our miseries cause not God to denye vs for his chil∣dren. Therefore when afflictions shal pricke and pinche vs, let vs Heb. 12. 2. Rom. 8. 35. Heb. 12. 5. Mat. 7. not doute of the fatherly goodnesse of GOD towardes vs, but let vs aske of him his holy spirite, and wee shal not bee refused nor denyed. 27 The feare of the Lorde is a wellspring of life, to auoide the snares of death. Solomon sheweth vs that there is strong hope and assurance for the children of God, which feare him, when hee compareth it vnto the liuelie spring, and that hee compareth the children of God vn∣to beasts, which are hunted and driuen into the nets & toyle which are set for them that they may be taken and slaine. Nowe it is not without cause that hee vseth such comparisons or similitudes for to shewe the estate of the children of God which feare him. For first of al the children of God are Pilgrims and passengers in this world▪ for we haue no continual abyding citie heere: for the land is mine, Heb. 13. 14. Leui. 25. 23. Psal. 39. 13. and yee are but straungers and so iourners with me. Wherefore let vs confesse, I am a stranger with thee, &c. And in this voyage they are subiect vnto many labours, afflictions and temptations: where∣with they are so changed, that if they were not watered with the feare of the Lorde, they shoulde faint through dispaire, & shoulde haue no sure trust in God: and so shoulde perishe. As a way faring man, wearie and thirstie in his way, if hee can finde no water to quenche his thirst, doeth perish: but if he knowe of any fountaine or spring that is neere, hee reioyceth, hoping that ere it beelong hee wil refreshe and coole himselfe, and slake his thirst, and bee more
strong: euen so, he that truely hath the feare of the Lorde, knoweth hee is neere vnto the liuing water, also that hee is compassed about therewith and hath it in himselfe: for the spring of liuing waters, which is God, dwelleth in him, who mainteineth him, quickeneth and comforteth him in al his temptations, labours and calamities. Thy mercie, O Lorde, reacheth vnto the heauens, and thy fayth∣fulnesse vnto the cloudes. Contrarily, Ieremy saieth, O Lorde the Psal. 36. 5. Iere. 17. 13. hope of Israel, al that forsake thee, shalbe confounded: they that departe from thee, shalbe written in the earth, because they haue forsaken the Lorde, the fountaine of liuing waters. Nowe as God is the fountaine or liuing vaine, and that hee is the spring, it is not by it to prouide for himselfe, but for them which feare him: for it is for them, for whome hee careth. What man is hee Psal. 23. 12. Esay. 66. 2. that feareth the Lorde? him wil hee teache the way that hee shall choose. And to him wil I looke, euen to him that is poore, and of a contrite spirite and trembleth at my woordes. Likewise the faithful are partakers of this spring, not to water themselues alone therewith, but to the ende that they may powre out streames of ri∣uers vnto their neighbours: and to the ende that as God hath gi∣uen them his feare, for they haue it not of themselues: Gather my people together, and I wil cause them heare my woordes, that they may learne to feare mee al the dayes that they shal liue vppon Deut. 4. 10. the earth, and that they may teach their children. And I will giue them one hearte and one way that they may feare me for euer, for Ier. 32. 39. Psal. 34. 12. Pro. 10. 11. &. 13. 14. the welth of them & of their children after them. So also they may teach others according to that which is written, Come children, hearken vnto me, I will teach you the feare of the Lorde. Solomon doeth signifie it also somewhat, in his. 5. chapter and. 16. verse, but more manifestly in other places. We must not be niggardes in di∣stributing of these waters: for in giuing of them, we diminish no∣thing at all thereby, but rather encrease, and in so doing we giue no∣thing of our owne, but are onely the ministers and stewardes of our Lorde Iesus Christ to whom onely belongeth these waters, and hee onely giueth: and therfore we must resort to him for he also doeth Esa. 55. 1. Iohn. 4. 10. 14. & 7. 37. 38. call vs. If we obey to this calling, wee shal want nothing. Beholde thus much concerning the first similitude. As touching the seconde
where Solomon sayth, to auoyde the snares of death: Let vs note that the state of those which feare God, is such, that as it is writ∣ten, Rom. 8. 36. For thy sake are wee killed al day long, and counted as sheepe for the slaughter. And Satan, the worlde, and their owne fleshe doe set nettes for to take them, and to destroy them for euer: but by the feare of the Lord, they which doe leade them to conforme themselues vnto his wil, to obey him, and to put their trust in him, doe auoyde death: for albeit that the wicked kil the body, yet haue they no power ouer the soule: the which not consenting vnto the temptations of Satan, nor to the lustes of the fleshe, ouercom∣meth death and al his forces, and perceth vnto the heauenly blisse, from the which it shal neuer bee put backe. And thus they auoyde the snares of death, not of themselues, but for that that the Lorde doeth heare them and deliuer them. Wee see therefore that it is ve∣ry profitable for vs to obey the exhortation of Saint Paule, which Psa. 34. 18. Phi. 2. 12. sayth, So make an ende of your owne saluation with feare & trem∣bling. That which Solomon attributeth heere vnto the feare of the Lorde, hee doeth in an other place attribute vnto instruction of the Pro. 13. 14. wise, and that very sitly: for whosoeuer is truly wise, hath the feare of the Lorde, and hee that feareth him, is wise, and his instruction tendeth to leade his neighboors vnto this feare, which is the first & chiefe parte of wisedome. 28 In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the destruction of the Prince. Solomon by the king and by the Prince, doeth vnderstande all those which haue power, and are ordeined for to gouerne some countrie or religion. Such kinde of men commonly do thinke them∣selues in high honour and maiestie, when by the credite and au∣thoritie that isgiuen to them by flatterers, eyther by violences that they exercise, or by the abundance of their riches, they make themselues to bee reuerenced and feared, and that no man dare beholde them, but in trembling wise, or in hauing them in more highe admiration then they ought: for they also knowe wel (as
they thinke) howe to mainteine their honour, euen with the con∣tempt of God, without whome neuerthelesse they haue no prehe∣minence, nor authoritie. And if it were not that God causeth his maiestie to shine in them, for to make his ordinance to be regarded, and that pollice should be ordered, to put away confusion, and that the good and innocent might liue in peace and rest, no man woulde make any more account of them, then of the wormes of the earth: for their owne partes, they are no better, albeeit that for the degree and dignitie that God hath giuen them, they are called the children of God, and that wee ought to submit ourselues, with al humble∣nesse, Psa. 82. 6. reuerence and obedience vnto them, so that it bee according as God wil haue it. But in seeking magnifically these former things, they abuse themselues greatly: as Solomon doeth shewe it when he sayth, In the multitude of people is the honour of the king, &c. The Lordes and Princes of the earth for to come to honour, must labour then to get a multitude of subiectes, and to hold them vnder their obedience and gouernement. The which shal easilie bee done, if first they doe yeelde themselues obedient vnto God, folowing his Deut. 17. 16 commandement, and that they become not like vnto Pharao, king of Egipt, who afflicted the children of Israel, lest that they shoulde multiply in his lande: but let them cause the lawe touching straun∣gers, to be obserued: and let them folowe good Kings, as Dauid, Io∣saphat, Leui. 19. 33. 34. Ezekias, and Iosias. So doing, they shal defende themselues, and shalbe truly reuerenced and feared, and shal not falsly and in vaine vsurpe these titles so honourable, the which doe not apper∣taine vnto fauourers and nourrishers of seditious and rebelles, of dissolute and careles, of wicked, scorners and contemners of God and of his worde: but doe belong vnto them which truly confesse their soueraigne Lorde, of whome they receiue their honour, & vp∣hold good pollicie, not only Ciuil, but also Ecclesiastical: to the ende that their people may learne to feare and honour God, by liuing i peace and quietnesse, in loue and good brotherly concord togither. Otherwise the people shalbe constrained to scatter abroade, and to bee dispersed as sheepe going astray, when they haue no shephearde. Nowe as a shephearde loosing his flocke, is vndone: euen so Kinges and Princes, suffering by euil gouernement their people to
scatter heere and there, are voide of honour, and doe ouerthrowe and destroy themselues. Solomon doeth so affirme, when hee sayth, And for the want of people commeth the destruction of the Prince. First of al let vs note that the want of people commeth not chiefly through changing of countrie, when they flye from the yoake of their natural prince: but when there is confusion amongst the people by diuisions, sectes, conspiracies, seditions, insurrections, sturres, debates, vproares, and rebellions. Then principlaities and kingdomes cannot stande: whereupon followeth the destruction of the prince: for he can bee no prince without a princedome, no more then an head is a head of those members that cleaue and ioyne not vnto him. Secondly, let vs note, that forasmuch as the honour of the king stādeth in multitude of people, & not in a cōfused & scattered multitude, that thereof it wel foloweth, that such a multitude is not worthy to bee named a people, but a sorte of Lyons, wolues, ser∣pents, dogges, swyne, yea Deuils incarnate. Thirdly, that it is lawe∣ful for kings and Princes to desire a greate people, and to labour to increase the number of their subiectes by good gouernement, and not by warres: for so farre is it of that by such troubles the number shoulde increase, that rather it doeth decay, and the Prin∣ces come to destruction, as experience sheweth. Also it is lawful for them to seeke honour, and to mainteine their honour for the 3. Sam. 15. & 16. 1. Kings. 12. Dan. 4. 26. & 5. 1. profit and sauegarde of the people, and to holde them vnder feare, least they shoulde fal away and reuolte. And for to doe it rightly, let them diligently take heede from seeking honor as did Absalom, and as did Roboam, Nabuchadnezer, and Balthazer. 29 He that is slowe to wrath, is of great wisedome: but he that is of an hastie minde, exalteth follie. There are diuers in the worlde which wil count a man to bee a foole and an asse, and to haue no heart when (as they say) he dares not looke a man in the face, for to bee angrie immediatly, and is not readie for to bee sodenly reuenged vppon him that hath done him wrong. Wherein they shewe that they knowe not God nor his wayes, or else do iudge God to be but a foole & an Asse: for
from the beginning of the worlde hee hath beene outraged by man, euen in such wise as hee hath deserued that God shoulde roote him out, but hee hath shewed himselfe to bee slowe to anger, and not onely then, but also in al ages: for hee hath not punished men so soone as they haue prouoked him to wrath against them by their transgressions & rebellions, but hath shewed himselfe to be patient, gentle, pitiful, and merciful, looking & calling mē vnto repentance. The Lorde, The Lorde, strong, merciful, and gracious. slowe to an∣ger, and abundant in goodnesse and trueth. &c. The Lord is ful of Exo. 34. 6. Psal. 103. 8. Esay. 55. 7. Rom. 2. 4. compassion and mercy, slowe to anger, and of great kindnesse. They which knowe the Lorde to bee such, wil not count him a foole and an asse, but wise, prudent, and discrete: and they also would esteeme them to bee of great wisedome which followe the wayes of their Creator: as Solomon doth heere, when hee saith, Hee that is slow to wrath, is of great wisedome. It is not without cause that he cal∣leth this wisedome, great: for first of al it is giuen of God, whose gifts we must not count of smal price, litle worth, and contemptible: for there commeth nothing from him, but is of great value and ex∣cellent, and ought to bee esteemed highly. Secondly, wee haue the lustes of our fleshe, which belong naturally vnto vs, by the corrup∣tion that is in vs: ane for this cause are very hard to bee tamed: and therefore the wisdome requireth to be great, which may ouercome them, and keepe them vnder subiection: otherwise we should burne with impatiencie, and shoulde bee kindeled with anger and wrath, and shoulde be violently caried with a desire of soden reuengement vpon those which do vs wrong, or which are too good in our opi∣nion: as Cain was against Abel, the Pharises against our Lord Iesus Christ, the carelesse and dissolute against them which seeke nothing but their saluation. Now not to be like vnto suche furious felowes, Mat. 5. 44. Ephe. 4. 2. Col. 3. 12. let vs obey our Lorde, who saith, Loue your enimies: and S. Paule, Thus doing, wee shal giue true signes, that wee are slowe to wrath, and that wee are of great wisedome: not that it is lawful to desire to bee praised for our wisedome, but that thereby wee shoulde giue example of gentlenesse, meekenesse, softnesse & clemencie vn∣to our neighbours, and shoulde giue them cause to praise GOD, who maketh his giftes and graces to shine in vs. And yet let vs
take heede from esteeming our wisedome to bee great, as though there coulde be added: but let vs knowe, as the trueth is, that wee greatly erre, and haue great neede that God shoulde mainteine vs in wisedome, and encrease the same in vs, otherwise wee shoulde soone bee destitute thereof, and should become amased and furious, and in steede to shewe foorth great wisedome, wee shoulde vtter and set foorth openly folly: as though it were some great vertue, for which it were laweful too seeke honour and glory, Solomon doth signifie it, saying, But hee that is of an hastie minde, exalteth folly: as do now these madde and bransicke men, which rise vp without any cause against the seruants of God. They are not ashamed to haue their folly seene: They are like Lions or Wolues, roaring after the poore sheepe, and yet woulde haue men beleeue that they haue a good cause, and doe vertuously, not to suffer themselues to bee gouerned, after their appetite which seeke nothing but their saluation. Heere∣in they so exalt folly, that wee are compelled to see it, except wee wil close our eies, as doe their fauourers and nourishers which main∣teine suche mad men, in their wicked and malicious folly. Besides this, let vs note, that if our wisedome bee required to bee shewed, and not to bee marked with folly, let vs be slowe to wrath and to be angrie with them which doe vs wrong without cause: muche lesse shoulde wee sodenly despite and murmure against our good God when he doth correct vs, but let vs patiently beare the crosse he lay∣eth vppon vs: seeing hee maketh vs beare no more then we haue worthily deserued: moreouer, & that by this chastisemēt he seeketh not our hurt, as doe men, but our profites and saluation: for by this he calleth vs vnto repentance. 30 A sounde heart is the life of the fleshe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones. Man at the beginning was made, to liue, and not to die: for first, God saide, Let vs make man like vnto our image, &c. And the Gene. 1. 26. &. 2. 7. Lorde God made man of the dust of the earth, and breathed in his face the breath of life, and the man was a liuing soule. Heereof was the tree of life, as a Sacrament. And not onely hee created
him for to liue, but also to bee in felicitie and ioy: as appeareth by that which is saide, The Lorde also planted a garden in Eden. &c. A∣gaine, Afterwardes the Lorde saide, It is not good that man should Gene. 38. 1 liue alone, &c. And also this present life is not counted a life, but a very bitter, & troublesome death, except we liue with ioy & glad∣nesse. Now as we haue been created for to liue, euen so doe we de∣sire the same naturally, and woulde not die: but if followe the cor∣ruption of our nature, wee cannot obteine our desire, but must die. Wee see how God giueth iudgement and sentence of death against Gene. 6. 7. 1 al fleshe, because that malice was great vpon the earth. They which perished by the same sentēce, receiuing the iudgemēt of eternal fire, haue beene set foorth for an example to those which shal liue with∣out reuerence and feare of God, wallowing and delighting in this 2. Pet. 2.  Luke. 7. corruption. And therefore Solomon desiring vs to auoide death, doeth teache vs wherein standeth the life of man, when he saith, A sounde hearte is the life of the fleshe. By a sounde hearte, Solo∣mon doeth signifie, the desires, purposes, and merciful, soft, graci∣ous, and pitiful affections, free from wickednesse, bitternesse, from rigour and crueltie. Vnto these doeth hee attribute the life of the fleshe, that is to say, to man. If wee wil vnderstand it of corporal life, there shalbe no inconuenience: for good and sounde affections make a man to liue ioyfully, which is one of the chiefe partes of this present life: for wee count ourselues to bee in death, except wee liue ioyfully, not after a worldly & carnal maner, which is not to re∣ioyce in holinesse and honestie. Neuerthelesse though this present life be common both to the elect and reprobate, yet is it most meete to vnderstande this sentence to apperteine to the life to come: not that our sounde desires shoulde bee worthie thereof, but by the grace of God it doeth followe it: and it is a certaine trueth that they which are guided with such affections, shal enioy eternal life. Blessed are the pure in hearte, for they shall see God. Nowe there is none of vs which are naturally sounde and pure in heart: and of Mat. 5. 8 Gene. 6. 5. & 8. 21. Iob. 14. 4. ourselues wee cannot haue them suche, vnlesse that GOD doeth cleanse and heale them. Wherefore when Solomon promiseth life (the which wee al desire) vnto a sounde heart, hee doeth aduertise vs to aske, Lorde haue mercy vpon mee: Heale my soule, for I haue sinned against thee, Heale me, O Lord, & I shalbe healed, &c.
Make mee a cleane heart, O God: and renewe a right spirite with∣in mee. If wee wil obteine such requestes, wee must receiue the do∣ctrine Psal. 50. 20. &. 4. 5. Iere. 17. 14. Psal. 51. 12. of the Gospel, by faith, the which is called a sound and whol∣some doctrine, not onely because it is pure and cleane, exempted frō all filthinesse, from lying and deceiuing: but also because it clenseth purifieth, and quickeneth the heartes of those men, whome it pear∣ceth. Saint Paul doeth giue vs this same wel to vnderstand, when hee setteth lyes and fables which corrupt the mindes and spirites of 1. Tim. 6. 3 2. Tim▪ 4. 3. Titus. 1. 9. men against it. Heereby wee may see there is neither health nor life but onely where the Gospel is purely preached and receiued. By the same it is that Iesus Christe hath brought vs life into light: and this is the power of God for to saue al beleeuers. Likewise wee may knowe there is not much health nor life in the worlde: for though 2. Tim. 1. 10. Rom. 1. 16. men doe purely preache the Gospel, yet are wee like vnto sicke men, to whom Phisicke is offered for a remedie to restore life and health, and they refuse and wil none of it: and therefore we haue neede to bee sharpely reprooued, as them of Crete. Nowe that soundnesse of the hearte consisteth in the former good affections and desires, Saint Paule doeth shewe vs, when bee woulde haue vs to be sound in faith, in loue, & in pacience. Solomon also doeth declare it vs Tit. 1. 9. &. 2. 2. heere, when against a sounde hearte, he setteth enuie, saying: But enuie is the rotting of the bones. For enuie signifieth al sinister, malicious and cruel affections: albeit that the worde which Solo∣mon vseth, may be taken in good part, and chieflly when it is attri∣buted vnto God and to his seruantes, which desire nothing but his glory, and the saluation of their neighbours: but when it is set against sounde desires, then must we take it in the euil part, for the contrary affection wherwith they are stained, which are sory, when they see the affaires of their neighbours to haue good successe, though thereby they susteine no hurte: but they woulde bee alone in prosperitie and reputation, and that other shoulde bee Exo. 20. 5. &. 34. 14. 1. Kin. 19. 10 Psal. 69. 10. put backe and despised: and cannot suffer their neigbours, which are better then they, to prosper, nor to bee praysed: but inuent and seeke their destruction, without cause. The Diuel is the father of suche people, which neuer ceassed til that he had almost quite ouerthrowne mankinde: And Caine is their Captaine, whome diuers haue followed: as the brethren of Ioseph, Saule against
Dauid, the Scribes and Pharisees, and Iudas against Iesus Christe: and nowe the most part of those which persecute the poore faithful Christians. The desires of such men are as the rotting of the bones. For as by the rotting of the bones man falleth to death: euen so suche affections doe kill men. For in this worlde hee hath no soundnesse nor rest in his conscience, but is continually tormented, albeit that hee labor to purge melācholie, the which is also a death: and afterwards he goeth vnto damnation and eternal death, except that (with the brethren of Ioseph) he come to confesse his malice, and to be displeased therewith. 31 Hee that oppresseth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore. Although wee be very wicked, and that there be many which of set purpose are giuen to doe thinges which they knowe to serue to the dishonour of God: yet there is none that wil bee counted wicked, and also there is none but wil bee very sory to bee called or esteemed a contemner of God. And therefore, to auoide this repu∣tation, and that none shoulde thinke wee woulde dishonour God, the worldlings and carnal men, yea the most wicked will labour to shewe themselues very zelous of the honour of God, in doing some thinges which shal haue an outwarde apparance of holinesse and religion: as Caine, Core, Dathan and Abiram, and Saule. Other∣some, Num. 16. 18 1. Sam. 15. 15 Act. 8. 18. to colour their wickednesse, and the dishonour they doe vnto God, wil desire to haue some honest vocation, and wil labour therin, speaking of God and of his workes: as Iudas and Simon Magus: but therein they avoide not the dishonour of God, as it appeareth when God declared that hee alloweth not suche kinde of seruices. As by these things doone, with an euil conscience, we ho∣nor not God: euē so also his dishonor standeth not in the omission Psal. 50. 8 Esay. 1. 11. &. 29. 13. &. 58. 11. Mat. 7. 21. of them: but it standeth in this, when wee forsake and doe contra∣ry to that which hee chiefly commandeth, and without the which nothing can please him. It is true that the principal honour wee can giue to God, & that he asketh of vs before al things, is declared vnto vs in the first table of Moses: but wee cannot giue vnto him
that hee requireth, except wee render vnto our neighbours that which wee owe them, without doing them wrong, and chiefly the poore. So that God doth disalowe al the honour that men can doe him, and doeth holde it for dishonour, if wee doe wrong vnto our neighbor, and aboue al, vnto the needie. Solomō doth briefly touch it, when he saith, Hee that oppresseth the poore, &c. We do wrong vnto a man, when we giue him not that we owe him, or when we take frō him that which hee possesseth iustly, and without the which he nor his family can bee mainteined in this life. And this wrong is doone most commonly vnto them which are poore, and haue no abun∣dance of wealth, forasmuch as they haue no power to defend them¦selues, and that no seruice nor pleasureis looked for at their hands. This commeth also because of their weakenesse, why God abhor∣reth those which doe them wrong, and counteth it dishonour doone by them: not that it is laweful to doe wrong vnto the ri∣cher sort, nor to pul away from thē that which they possesse, though they bee wicked, and haue nothing sanctified to their vse. Nowe although wee ought to doe no wrong vnto suche kinde of people, yet haue they no neede to bee commended: for they wil not wil∣lingly suffer to bee wronged: and as they wel thinke, they are strong enough to defende themselues: and do rather pul away the goods of others, then to suffer losse or hinderance. Likewise God hath no care to commende them, but hee commendeth vnto vs the nee∣die, pronouncing that the wrong that is done them, turneth to his dishonour, and that the euil and iniurie that is doone vntoo the poore, is doone vnto himselfe: so that when a poore man is wron∣ged, we do not iniurie to a man onely, that hath no power, but we stande vp against almightie God, who knoweth wel howe to re∣uenge the wrong that is doone vnto him. Solomon doeth note this power, when by signifiyng God, hee saith, reproueth him, that made him: yea, who is aswel a man as the most excellent. And if God hath made man, who is the most excellent creature of the world, it followeth wel he is of power to make al other things, and to defende and deliuer the needie from him that doeth him wrong. Neuertheles by this woorde, Hath made him, Solomon doeth not
chiefly and onely pretende to marke the power of God, but rather would signifie that a man, though he be poore and needie, yet ceas∣seth hee not to bee the worke and creation of God, aswel, or better than the richest: and forasmuch as he is his worke, that hee wil take care of him, and not forsake him. And so this worde Hath made him, ought to be a great comfort to the needie, and to assure them Heb. 13. 5. . of the fatherly care of God towards them, as they are admonished. On the otherside it ought to feare and terrifie the vnmerciful and cruel: for they are admonished, that in doing wrong to the needie, they doe not despise the worke of a man, but so much as lyeth in them, they destroy what God hath made. Wherein they take a worke in hand, which they cannot bring to an ende, and the wrong that they inuent for their neighbour, shal fal vpon themselues. The number of them which doe wrong vnto the needie is verie great, as wee may see. The wordle is ful of suche. Whereuppon it foloweth, that God is greatly dishonoured, although al the worlde woulde be esteemed that they reuerence, and feare God. Nowe Solomon de∣siring that wee shoulde not be of that number which doe dishonor Psa. 7. 16. 17 Luk. 16. 23 God, doeth teache vs howe wee should behaue ourselues towards our needie neighbours, for to honour God: when he saith, But hee honoureth him that hath mercie on the poore. If we wil then doe acceptable honour vnto God, wee must haue mercie vpon the poore, and vnderstand that Solomon setting mercy against wrong, doeth shewe vs, that whosoeuer hath not mercie vpon the poore, doeth wrong vnto him, though hee neither curse nor strike him, nor take ought of his from him. It is to do him double wrong, when he wil not giue him that which he oweth him: the which he doth, when he hath power and abilitie for to helpe his needinesse, and careth not to helpe him. He doeth him great wrong: for in this case hee hateth his brother, and is a murtherer of him. Let vs not 1. Iohn. 3. 15. then loue in worde nor in tongue: but indeede and truth, and wee shal do honour vnto God, which shal very much please him. I wil haue mercie and not sacrifice: and our Lord Iesus Christ doth shew Mat. 12. 7. it when he saith, Come ye blessed children of my Father, &c. For I was an hungry, and ye fed mee, &c. And the Apostle saith, To doe good and to distribute, forget not: for with such sacrifices God is Mat. 25. 34. Heb. 13. 16. pleased.
32 The wicked shall bee cast away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death. Many are giuē to do euil, and beare enuie vnto the senselesse, see∣ing the prosperitie of the wicked. It seemeth vnto mans wit & car∣nal reason, that such prosperitie ought to continue, and that the wic∣ked shal alwaies florishe: for the worldlings and carnal men haue Psal. 73. 3 no further regarde then to that which they outwardly feele, and see before their eyes: but the Spirite of God doth teach vs farre other∣wise by Solomon when hee saith, The wicked shall bee cast away for his malice. The which Solomon doth here expresse briefly, and in another place doeth de∣clare at large. There is nothing sayde there, but the wicked hath al∣ready felt it and we confesse it, if we wil open our eyes as we ought Leui. 26. Deu. 28. Psal. 37. for to beholde the iudgementes that God hath executed vppon the wicked, as vpon Cayn, vpon the world destroyed by the vniuersal flood, vpon Sodome and Gomorrhe, and other wicked men. By so many examples as haue happened, and doe dayly come too passe, we may knowe that God casteth away the wicked for their malice, and maketh them to fall and perishe in affliction and miserie: were it not that we esteeme not to regarde the prouidence of God, and to haue pacience til he hath in time fulfilled his counsel: but we attri∣bute almost al vnto fortune. We may geue vnto this first parte two other senses: wherof the one is, that the wicked shalbe cast away in his misery: that is to say, he shal not stand when aduersity shal as∣sault him, but shalbe so beaten downe, that he shal fal and perishe. The other sense is, that the wicked shalbe cast away in his euil: that is to say, that the euill that he thinketh to doe vnto his neighbour, Psal. 7. 16. shall fall vpon himselfe by the iust vengeance of God. These three senses are diuerse, and not contrarie: For trueth doeth not with∣stande trueth, seeing there is but one trueth: the which notwith∣standing is declared after diuers sortes. Now these three senses are all true, as the Scriptures doeth prooue, and also as the wicked haue felt & tried it. And with this that these three senses conteyn truth, they agree also with the Antithesis. For when Solomon saieth, but the rightoous hath hope in his death: he sheweth that the righte∣ous
shalbe sure and stable, and that he shalbe preserned that no euil shall happen to destroy him. His body may be put to death: but it shal not be to cast him away for his malice, for the faith hee hath in God, the which worketh by loue, is imputed vnto him for righte∣ousnesse, and no malice is attributed vnto him, but all his iniquities are blotted out, neuer more for to be remembred before God. His body shal suffer much affliction & calamities, by the which he might faint, but because he hopeth in God, the which confoundeth not, he shal obteine according therevnto, & shal not be cast away in his af∣flictions, but the Lord wil receiue him to himselfe, and deliuer him. His body shalbe subiect to receiue much euil, euen to be slaine, but seeyng that his conseience doth not reproue him to haue inuented Psal. 34. 20. euil against his neighbor, he feareth not by dying to be cast away frō God, for to be recompensed him: but shal stande sure in this hope, that by his death he shal obtein the reward of the righteous, which is euerlasting life. Herein doeth Solomon geue vs a sufficient proofe for to make euery one of vs to cōsider whether we shalbe cast away, or whether we haue hope. For sith it is the righteous that hath hope, it doeth wel followe that they which are geuen vnto wicked∣nesses cannot hope, but do looke to bee cast away, and too receiue a worthy rewarde of their mallice. Contrarily, sith that righteousnes is set against malice or euil, it followeth that the righteous, who is contrary vnto al euil, and doth abhorre it, hopeth not to bee cast a∣way. For albeit that his righteousnesse is not worthy of that which he hopeth for, yet he knoweth, and is assured that God is true in his promises, according to the which he cannot perishe. And therefore what grieuous afflictions soeuer he suffer, and albeit he haue moti∣ons, and sightes which are harde and sharpe for him to beare, yet doeth he not vexe himselfe, for to distrust the mercy of God. On the other side, forasmuch as we cannot haue this hope, but by the woorde of God, which is refused almost of al, it foloweth that the number of the righteous is very rare, and that very few haue hope. True it is, that so long as afflictions shal not presse vs, we make our¦selues beleeue to be of ioly courage: but when wee bee touched to the quicke, or thinke thereof, then wee faint. Further more let vs note, though that by the corruption of our nature, the malice of vs al is so great, that wee deserue to bee cast away: yet God is so mer∣iful,
that he imputeth our hope vnto righteousnes, and doth not suffer vs to perishe. Wherein we may know that it is very necessary for vs, continually to meditate the word of our Lord, and to labour to conforme our liues therereafter. 33 Wisedome resteth in the heart of him that hath vnder∣standing, and is knowne in the middes of fooles. There is none but doth naturally esteeme himselfe to be wise, & also there is none that would endure to be counted a foole: and yet almost al do despise knowledge and vnderstanding and chiefly diui∣nity, the which is the most necessary: and that there are but a very few, but wil be troubled, when a man speaketh to thē therof. Some of thē would think themselues hypocrites and superstitious, if they gaue themselues therevnto: some thinke themselues too young for to set their heartes therevppon, and thinke it is nothing but Melan∣choly, the which agreeth not with young folkes: but that it belon∣geth vnto those which are olde to be geuen to learning and vnder∣standing. And when they are waxen old, it is great paine & trouble for them to leaue their wonted trade. And thus alwayes they refuse knowledge and vnderstanding: and yet they cease not to attribute to themselues wisedome, though they be altogether voide therof: as Solomon doeth wel signifie, when hee saieth, Wisedome resteth in the heart of him that hath vnderstanding, &c. Therefore of what age soeuer wee be, we must, (if we wil get wisedome) be pru∣dent: and for to be suche, let vs not reiect knowledge and vnder∣standing, as doe the foolish, which nothing esteeme the pure worde of God, which is the prudence and intelligence of the faithful which loue wisedome, and are careful to seeke and enioy her. And when he saieth, that wisedome resteth, let vs not thinke that shee is idle and of no power: but let vs vnderstand, that if we be prudent, wee are so seased of wisedome, and doe so carefully possesse her, that we can not suffer to bee depriued thereof. And notwithstanding shee is not vnprofitable, and they which possesse her, doe not disdaine to open her, and to sende her foorth, that shee may doe her office, and may gaine that whereabout she is appointed. Also the prudent doe cause their wisedome to shine euen amongst fooles, and if it
lay in them, the fooles shoulde bee made wise and prudent: for from the abundance of the hearte the mouth speaketh, and other members also doe execute their office. Solomon doeth signifie it, saying, And is knowne in the mids of fooles. It is not to say that the fooles doe receiue her to bring her foorth into light, and to imparte her vnto their neighbors: for if they should vse her so, they should not be fooles, but wise: but it is to say, that the prudent man wal∣king amongst fooles (whereof the world is ful) doth not frame him∣selfe after their maners, nor foloweth their trade: as they which say, wee must barke with the dogge, and houle with the wolfe: and dis∣guise ourselues after al fashions for to apply vs to them with whom we chance to meete, but hee sheweth himselfe wise and prudent in his deedes and wordes: so that they which haue sounde iudgement, doe easily knowe him from amongst other. Al true faythful Christi∣ans ought to bende theretoo: Brethren, bee not children in vnder∣standing, 1. Cor. 14. 20 Ephe. 5. 15. Col. 4. 5. Ephe. 4. 11. & 14. but in malice be as children. Againe, Take heede therfore that ye walk circumspectly, not as fooles, but as wise. Againe, Walk wisely toward them that are without, and redeeme the season. This is the cause also why the Gospel is preached. And hee therfore gaue some to be Apostles, and some Prophetes, and some Euangelistes, and some Pastours, and teachers. That we hencefoorth be no more children, wauering and caried about with euery winde of doctrine, &c. But the Pastours of the Church should chiefly make their wis∣dome to bee knowne in the mids amongst fooles. For to them doth Iesus Christ say, Ye are the salt of the earth, &c. And S. Paule de∣mandeth Mat. 5. 13. 2. Timo. 3. 2. Tit. 1. 6. 17. of them greate prudence. The Nicodemites cannot boast that they are prudent, nor that wisedome resteth in their heartes. For seeing that the good man out of the good treasure of his hart bringeth foorth good things, therefore shal their wisedome Mat. 12. 35. Iohn. 19. 39. be knowne in the mids of fooles. As Nicodemus gaue it openly to be known in the mids of the madde & raging Iewes. And forasmuch as it is not lawful for vs to dwel amongest fooles, to consent with them, but ought to withstande and reprooue them, correcting and threatning thē: otherwise we should be partakers with thē of their folly, & be like vnto thē: it foloweth that they which faine not to se
their insolences, cannot challenge wisedome. Likewise albeeit that wisedome must bee knowne in the mids of fooles, both by works, and doctrine, yet must wee diligently take heede from dooing our woorkes to bee seene of men: but wee must labour onely to make our tallentes (that the Lorde hath committed vnto vs) to profit and increase. 34 Iustice exalteth a nation, but sinne is ashame to the people. The peoples and nations of the earth desire to bee praised and honoured, to bee famous, and renoumed, for the which they are feared and reuerenced: they desire to haue greate titles. And for to obteine this, they inlarge their limites, and increase their lordships, in ioyning towne to towne, countrie to countrie: they build sump∣tuouse pallaces and castels which they labour to make impregnable and vnaccessible, and care not though in their dooings they wring their neighbours and take not heede whither they doe things plea∣sing or displeasing God. It is ynough for them to obteine their de∣sires, and to finish their enterprises. They thinke by such kind of do∣ings to bee magnified and exalted, but they are much deceiued: see∣ing 1. Pet. 5. 5. Luke. 1. 51. Gene. 6. & 7. & 11. 4. Gene. 6. & 7 & 11. 4. they haue not onely to do with mortal, transitorie and frayle men, as they are, but with the eternal and almightie God, who can tel how to mocke their enterprises, and to frustrate their desires. For hee resisteth the proude: as sayth the virgin Mary, hee hath shew∣ed strength with his arme, hee hath scattered the proude in the ima∣gination of their heartes. The very gyants hade felt it: for though they were mightie, and alwayes famous, yet coulde they not a∣uoyde the general flood. Noes childrens children laboured to get fame and to fortifie themselues, but God scattered them ouer all the earth through the confusion of tongues which he sent amongst them. The Canaanites thought themselues highly exalted, when they were multiplyed, and their cities strongly furnished & fenced with all riches: but at the comming of the people of Israel, GOD knewe wel howe to beate them downe and destroy them. A man might here alledge the Assirians and Babylonians, & almost
all the nations of the earth, and in them to beholde how men doe not rightly proceede to be exalted, if we followe their maners. For as we read in the scripture, God hath vtterly humbled & aba∣ced them. Therefore if we wil be exalted, let vs not desire to bee like vnto these nations: but let vs learne at Gods mouth what gouern∣ment we must folowe. If thou doest obey the voyce of the Lord thy God, he wil ordeine thee head ouer al the nations of the earth. Ac∣cording Deut. 28. 1. too this same, Solomon saith, Iustice exalteth a nation. We wil here take iustice, for the obediēce of Gods voyce, the which is imputed vnto vs, when we beleeue and repent: wherby we lead a pleasing & an acceptable life vnto God. For by fayth we renounce all vayne confidence, which is detestable before God, and cleane vn∣to him onely, according as he demandeth in the Scripture. By repen∣tance we abhorre the euill that God forbiddeth, and loue the good that he commandeth. Thus doing, we shal honour and glorifie him, and he wil also exalt vs according to his promises. And sith we are exalted by faith & repentance, the which are taught vs by the word, it followeth that we haue no righteousnes but therby, and so there∣by we are exalted. But this exaltatiō is not seene of thē that beholde it with a carnal eye, and require nothing but external pompe. Also they beleeue not that by the worde we may be exalted, but rather suppressed and beaten downe. And therefore they reiect this word, and do persecute them which receiue it, and beare it, as though they were sworn enemies to kingdomes and principalities for to destroy and bring them to naught. We must not wonder hereat: for the ex∣altation which proceedeth of righteousnes, is not knowne but onely of them which are spiritual: for it is spiritual, chiefly touching the temporal, it appeareth so little in outwarde sight that they make no account thereof, but onely that they be easily contented. For God procedeeh not (according to our estimation, neither after the ma∣ner, nor affection of men) to exalt nations by iustice. Wee may knowe by this that they which folowe iustice are most commonly scorned, despised and reuiled in the worlde: but yet they cease not to be exalted before God, who doth honor & glorifie them be∣fore men, after as he knoweth to be expedient for them. Nowe such nations as are truely geuen vnto righteousnes, are contented with suche kinde of temporal exaltation as it pleaseth GOD too geue
them, and are not sayde thereat, but haue their hearts and minde fixed vpon the eternal exaltation, the which was prepared in hea∣uen before the foundation of the worlde was layde, and the which they meditate and beholde by fayth and hope. Nowe that iustice ought in this place to bee taken for the obedience to the voyce of God, Solomon doeth shewe, when against iustice, hee setteth sinne, saying, But sinne is a shame to the people. For there had beene no sinne in the worlde, if Adam had not disobeyed the voice of God: Gene. 3. 11. Rom. 5. 19. This is seene by the reproche that God made him: and Saint Paul doeth plainely pronounce it: For as by one mans disobedience ma∣ny were made sinners, so by that obedience of that one, shal many also bee made righteous. Therefore as God by obedience exalteth nations, euen so likewise, by obedience hee bringeth nations to shame: as he threatened the Iewes therewith. And because that they feared not the threatenings, but hardened themselues so much Leui. 26. Deut. 28. the more, in persecuting the Prophets, Iesus Christ our Lorde, and his Apostles: for this cause God hath so put them back & cast them of, that they haue iustly prooued and doe feele, that sin is the shame of nations: neuerthelesse, they neither woulde nor wil yet vnder∣stande. The faithful Christians amongst them haue wel felt it: as we may knowe by their complaintes and confessions. But now thou art farre of, and puttest vs to confusion, &c. Againe, Thou makest Psa. 44. 10. 14. &. 7. 4. Psa. 51. 4. Da. 9. 5. Ir. 20. 11. vs to be rebuked of our neighbours, &c. Againe, Against thee one∣ly haue I sinned, and done this euil in thy sight: that thou mightes be iustified in thy saying, &c. Wee haue sinned, and haue commit∣ted iniquitie, & haue done wickedly, &c. They which neuer knew, nor yet wil knowe, shal fall into euerlasting shame. They which per∣secute mee, shal fal, their shame shalbe eternal, &c. 35 The pleasure of a king is in a wise seruant: but his wrath shalbe towarde him that is lewde. Although it is a true and sure thing, that God who is our high King, doeth delight in that man which can gouerne himselfe with suche wisedome and prudence as is requisite for his vocation, and that he which doth contrarie therto, doth displease him, as the scrip∣ture doth witnes both by promises & threatenings, and also by ex∣amples▪
Blessed is the people, (O Lord) that can reioyce in thee: they shal walke in the light of thy countenance. The Lordes delight is in Psa. 89. 16. &. 147. 11. &. 2. 4. 9. them that feare him: he that dwelleth in heauen, shal laugh them to scorne, the Lord shal haue them in derision. Again, Thou shalt bruise them with a rodde of yron. He hath iustly shewed his wrath against Caine: against the world destroyed by the flood, and by other infi∣nite Psal. 32. 9. examples which ought to mooue vs to folow this exhortation, I wil informe thee, and teach thee in the way wherin thou shalt go: and I wil guide thee with mine eye. And least the riche and great men doe thinke that this doctrine doeth nothing perteine to them, let them giue eare. Be wise nowe therfore, yee Kinges: bee learned, ye Iudges of the earth. Serue the Lord in feare, and reioyce in trem∣bling. Albeit (I say) that it is a thing true and sure, that God deligh∣teth in a man of vnderstanding: yet we wil take this sentence for an Psal. 2. 10. 11. instruction that Solomon giueth vnto the Kings of the earth, and to their seruants & officers. Wherin, first he sheweth that the affection of Kings & Lords of the earth, ought not to be set vpon vanitie and folly (vpon pleasures & pastimes, vpon superfluities & pomps, vpon filthines and couetousnes, and other worldly and carnal thinges: as doe almost al Princes and earthly Lordes, who thinke that al things are made for their pastime, and that they ought to doe nothing els but to liue in pleasure and voluptuousnes, & to doe al thinges after their sensual appetite, so drunken are they in their carnal sense:) but their heartes and mindes ought to bee giuen vnto the lawe of the Lorde. For if they be not wise nor learned, they can not delight in wise seruantes and learned officers: as Solomon hath warned them Deut. 17. 1. 19. heere, saying, The pleasure of a King is in a wise seruant: and doeth shewe them that they ought to take example of Dauid. Se∣condly, he sheweth that a King ought not himself alone to gouern Psal. 101. 2▪ and guide the people committed vnto him, but ought to haue ser∣uants which may serue and helpe him to set order in the pollicie af∣ter the counsel of Iethro: and as did Iosaphat. Thirdly, that Kings and Princes ought not to gouerne after their fantasie, but accor∣ding Exo. 1.  2. Cor. 1. . 6. 7. to the counsell of their learned and wise seruantes. And then they shal shewe that they delight in them, and esteeme and honour them. Contrarily, if they haue none other lawe but their wil, and wil not yeelde vnto the counsel of wise and learned seruantes,
they doe plainely shewe that they doe not delight in wise seruants. Nowe if kings must followe the counsel of such as are learned and wise in the ciuill gouernment, by a greater reason they ought very diligently to beleeue the true and faithful Pastours of the Church, which beare the word of the Lorde: and to attempt nothing in the Ecclesiastical pollicie without the aduise and counsel of those which Deut. 17. 18 are appointed to feede the flocke of the Lorde. This is wel shewed them, when it is sayde, that the king shal write out this law into a booke for himselfe, by the Priestes of the Leuites. For the Priestes lips should preserue knowledge, as they should seeke the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hostes. Fourthly, that offices and administrations of kingdomes, principalities and Lorde∣ships Mala. 2. 7. ought to be committed vnto wise and learned men, and not vnto suche as are ignorant. Beholde this is it which is shewed to vs by the first parte of this present sentence, vpon the which let vs note that delight is here taken for a louing and fauourable affection: and a wise seruant, for him which can so wel gouerne in the administra∣tion committed vnto him, that his Lord reioyseth thereat and prai∣seth it, and is not ashamed to commend the same. Solomon doth so teach it vs, when agaynst delight, hee setteth wrath, and against a wise seruant, him that is lewde, saying, But his wrath shalbee to∣warde him that is lewde. Let vs note, sith that the lewde seruant, or that hee worketh confusion, is set against a wise or learned ser∣uaunt, we must vnderstand that he is a lewd seruant which is voyde of a right affection, of sounde iudgement, and despiseth wisedome and vnderstanding, and careth not too labour in the charge and ad∣ministration committed vnto him, except he labour to set all in dis∣order and confusion, and yet notwithstanding would be counted a good and faythful seruant. The kingdomes principalities, dominati∣ons & Lordships, haue but too many such seruāts, as experience te∣cheth. But we must not maruel thereat: for if the kings, Princes, & Lords of the earth doe disobey, rebel & be vnfaithful vnto their So∣ueraigne Lord & king, they doe wel deserue to haue such seruantes officers & stewards, or rather scatterers & destroiers: & also suche men are cōmonly best welcōe & receiued into the courts & houses of great men, because they can beare good face, goe braue and gay, flatter & slaunder. Wherin we may wel know that such administra∣tions,
are disordered and haue yll successe: for they which are the best welcome and receyued, ought too bee reiected, driuen away and rooted out, if the Lordes did their duetie. Solo∣mon doeth wel shewe it vs, when he saith heere, that the lewde ser∣uant shalbe vnder the wrath of the king. For when hee speaketh heereof wrath, let vs not onely imagine some euil vse and custome some crooked looke, or some blunt speech or sharpe threatninges: But as the king ought to maynteine a wise seruant, in dooing him good, and preseruing him from euill, so much as possiblie hee can, Psa. 101. 8. Rom. 13. 4. 1. Pet. 2. 14. Psa. 101. 11. (otherwise he should not delight in him,) euē so the office of a king requireth such anger against a lewde seruant, that hee shoulde make him to feele it in punishing him, as the confusion and lewdnes that he hath done deserueth, according to the Scripture. I shall soone destroy all the vngodly that are in the land: that I may roote our al wicked doers from the citie of the Lord. The fifteenth Chapter. 1 A softe answere putteth away wrath: but greeuo woordes stirre vp anger. A Although we be inclined and rea∣die to doe euill vnto our neighbours, (as Caine hath well shewed it vntoo his brother Abel, and the children of Iacob vnto their brother Ioseph) and Gene. 4. 8. &. 37. 4. 20. that many doe nothing care though their neighboures are prouoked a∣gainst thē, so arrogant and lofty they are, and presume vpon their autho∣rity: neuertheles, after we haue offen∣ded them, or that we vnderstand that they holde themselues offen∣ded with vs, if we feele or think vs to be more weak, we feare their wrath, and desire to auoyde it, and would be very glad to bee assu∣red that they beare vs no grudge, and desire no reuengment against vs. Now what force and power, or credite and authoritie soeuer we haue aboue our neighbours if we haue offended them, we must think we are the weakest. For in offending our neghbours, we doe
not only set ourselues against men, but against almightie God, who can tel how to take the quarel of those in hand, that are vniustly op∣pressed, & can soone take vengeance in his wrath & fury, without a∣ny resistance. Cain did iustly feele it: so did they which vexed the ho∣ly ancient fathers, & which rose vp against the people of God: as it may be seene in the holie histories: and in beholding the promises and threatenings contained in the bookes of Moses. Albeit thē that after the feeling of the fleshe and outward appearance, we seeme vn∣to Gene. 12. 2. 3. &. 15. 1. 14. Deut. 32. 35. Zach. 2. 5. 9. ourselues to be the more mightie, yet whē we haue offended our neighbours, how weak soeuer they be, let vs esteeme ourselues the weakest, and feare the wrath that is kindeled against vs, because of the offence that wee haue committed, & let vs endeuour to auoide it in quieting our neighbours offended. And to come to this, let vs folow the way that Solomon doth teach vs, when he saith, A softe answere putteth away wrath, &c. By a soft answere, let vs vnder∣stand, and humble confessing of the faltes & offences which haue bin committed, with requests & praiers to obteine pardon of God, and reconciliation with them that haue bin offended: and chiefly when we are exhorted & required. And not only the same, but also, let vs vnderstand euerie soft & gentle word, whereby we labour to quiet those which are angrie, whether it be wrong or right, and to obtein their fauour. Iacob knew wel that such words were fit for to turne away wrath: and therfore he vseth them towards his brother Esau. Gene. 32. 4. 5. & 33. 5 & 27. 41. 1. Sam. 24. 9. &. 26. 18. Math. 5. 23. He had not offended Esau, but hee knew wel that Esau had threate∣ned to kil him. And Dauid for to turne away the wrath of Saul, who did wrongfully persecute him, vseth also a soft answer. Likewise our Lord Iesus Christ doth wel teach vs, If thou wilt offer thy gift to the Altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leaue there thine offering before the Altar & go thy way: first be reconciled to thy brother, & then come and offer thy gift. Again, Loue your enemies, &c. Speake wel of them which persecute you, &c. not rendering euil for euil, &c. And if we must vse a soft answer towards them which doe vs wrong, by a stronger reason towardes God & our neighbours, whom we haue offended. The brethren of Math. 5. 23. 24. 44. Rom. 12. 44. Ioseph did wel vnderstand this, as they shewed it: and Abigaile: Dauid also did prooue, that a soft answere putteth away wrath, As
hee confesseth, I haue sinned against the Lorde, &c. Wee may see heere howe wee must vse a soft answere, for to turne away the 2. Sam. 12. 13. &. 24. 10 sa. 32. 5. wrath, chiefly of God. (For cursed is the fauour which men beareth vnto vs, except wee haue peace with God: the which for to obteine, let vs take heede wee vse not soft answere vnder dissimulation and hypocrisie: as they which say, Lorde, Lorde, and labour not to doe his wil). Secondly, of men: following the counsel of S. Paule, If it be Math. 7. 21. Luke. 6. 46. Rom. 12. 18. Math. 26. 49 possible, so much as in you lyeth, haue peace with al men. And in our soft answere let vs take heede of treason: as Iudas Iscarioth, which saluted Iesus Christe, kissing and calling him maister, and yet betraied him into the handes of his enimies. To whome al such are like which boast themselues to bee refourmed after the Gospel, and yet woulde haue the same abolished. And forasmuche as an aun∣swere or soft word doth put away wrath, & quieteth it, it foloweth wel, that if we fear, as we ought, of prouoking of God, or our neigh∣bours vnto wrath and anger, that wee ought to bee giuen truely vnto such a kinde of answere, and to abstaine from al rude, sharpe, arrogant, and greeuous wordes: As doeth Solomon teach vs, say∣ing, But grieuous wordes stirre vp anger. This same is so playne, that it needeth no declaration, and is so often prooued, that it hath no neede of probation, as touching betweene man and man: and also it is a natural thing belonging to man, to bee prouoked to an∣ger when thinges are not spoken vnto his minde. Caine hath wel Gene. 4. 9 shewed it by the answere hee made vnto God. The Sodomites tooke not the instructions of Lot in good parte, and therefore they waxed angry with him. The sonnes of Iacob doe not very wil∣lingly &. 19. 9. &. 37. 8. heare the dreames of Ioseph: for this cause they became an∣grie, and conceiued hate against him. The answere of Nabal pro∣uoked Dauid vnto anger. Concerning God, let vs not doubte but 1. Sam. 25. 13 1. Cor. 10. 5. 1. Kin. 18. 40 that wee prouoke his anger, when our speeche doeth not please him: as doe all lyers, & as many as speake wickedly. The children of Israel haue wel tryed it after their murmuringes: as the holy histo∣ries doe set it foorth, and Saint Paule also doeth testifie it. The 1. Cor. 6. 9. 10. false Apostles haue felt it. Albeeit that God doeth not alwayes declare his anger against the euil mouthed, yet shal they not auoide it: for the slaunderers, backbiters, periurers and blasphemers shall
not inherit the kingdome of heauen. Let vs then take heed to speake wel, to please God chiefly, and also our neighbours which are easie and willing to be taught. For if the stubborne, transgressours, disso∣lute and wicked, the hard harted and obstinate do become angrie at vs, when we speake not to their minde, let vs not care for it. If our speech which is according to Gods worde, be greeuous vnto them, the same commeth not from vs, but from their malice. If their an∣ger arise, let vs not be afraide thereof, but let vs folowe our charge, as we are admonished in Esai, the 58. Chapter: & Ier. 1. 7. & 2. Tim. 4. 2. & Titus, 1. 7. 8. 2 The tongue of the wise vseth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out foolishnesse. Wee al naturally doe desire knowledge, and to vnderstande how wee ought to gouerne and rule, that wee may gaine therby, & auoid losse: and it greeueth vs to bee ignorant, except wee be children in wit, or blockishe and dul. Wee doe greatly praise them which are cunning to handle their matters wel, and which are careful and dili∣gent to take heede that they haue no hinderance nor losse: and con∣trarily, wee blame them which haue no regarde to their businesse, and wee esteeme them negligent. Nowe if wee bee thus affecti∣oned to worldly things and temporal gouernment, by a more strong reason, must wee bee earnest to learne to guide and gouerne our soules, for to preserue them from danger, not temporal (as are the worldlings, which know no other life, but this temporal, very care∣ful to do this:) but to auoide eternal destruction, and to be alwaies in felicitie and ioy. The knowledge which is necessary thereto, is not found in al: for it is not common to al, but only to them which are instructed & taught of God. Dauid doth so affirme it, The Lord Psa. 25. 8. Psa. 32. 8. Esay. 2. 3. & 48. 17. & 54. 13. Iere. 31. 33. 34. is good & iust. And therefore hee praieth, Make mee to know thy wayes, O Lorde. Also the promises that GOD maketh, doe shewe that the true knowledge commeth from him. And yet notwithstanding, GOD who is our teacher, dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto. For this cause hee ordereth the Instrumentes and Organes, by the which hee will teache vs, and of whome wee must learne knowledge. Solomon doth signifie it, whē he saith, The tongue of the wise vseth knowledge aright, &c.
If thē we wil learn knowledge, & learne how we must guide & go∣uerne our soules for to preserue them from destruction, we must aske of God that he woulde raise vp for vs wise men, not worldly & car∣nal, but such as was Noe, Abraham, Moyses, the Prophets & Apo∣stles: and that he would frame and order their tongue, in such wise that they may pronoūce, as they ought, the pure word, which is the sound & healthful knowledge, without the which al other sciences & knowledges are but darknes & ignorāce, & the way of destructiō damnatiō. And we must pray and him that he would draw vs neere vnto thē, & to heare them with al the desire of our heart, & that by such meanes he woulde accomplish in vs his promise. If wee cleaue vnto other, seing they are vnlike, euen mere contrary, to wit, fooles, Eze. 36. 27. we shal learne nothing but follie. For the mouth of fooles bableth out foolishnesse. Nowe when follie is set against knowledge, which is very profitable, as we haue heard: it followeth rightly that frō the mouth of fooles, we cā receiue nothing but hurt, the which we can∣not auoid, except we be very discrete for to preserue ourselues. For on what side soeuer wee turne vs, wee meete with fooles, who be∣cause of the great multitude where with the world is ful, & because also of their great glistering, and faire shew of holines & wisedome, & of their credite & authoritie doe draw vs vnto them, & doe be∣witch vs with their follie, & doe leade vs vnto destruction with thē, except we be very quicke to discerne betweene knowledge and foo∣lishnes. We haue tried it beeing vnder the yoake of Antichrist of Rome. Wherfore when the Lord giueth wisdome, we must come to heare it, beseeching him to make vs too vnderstande the way of his Pro. 2. 6. Psa. 119. 27. 33. commandementes. Againe, Lorde teach me the way of thy statutes. And albeit that Solomon here maketh no mentiō but of the tongue and of the mouth: yet he excludeth not the other members. For as we haue hearde, a discrete man worketh by knowledge, but a foole openeth follie. There hee speaketh rather of the tongue then of other members: for it is the same that expresseth best what is in Pro. 13. 16. the hearre of man, and is more easily and lightly imparted vntoo a great multitude then by the other members. The tonge is of so greate excellencie, that the Scripture calleth glory, and S. Iames Psal. 16. 9. Ia. 3. 5. 6. 13. saieth, that the tongue woorketh greate thinges, though it be but a little member.
But if it be giuen to goodnes, it commeth not of it selfe: for the tongue is a fire, euen a worlde of wickednes. Therefore it requireth to be guided and ruled by some other thing then it selfe, that is to say, by wisedome. S. Iames doeth signifie it, when he asketh, Who∣soeuer is wise and discreet amongst you? let him shew by good con¦uersation of his workes in meekenesse of wisedome. Solomon also saieth not simply, The tongue vseth know∣ledge aright: but the tongue of the wise: In them is knowledge, and with them it is founde. Therefore no man wil attribute knowledge, Pro. 10. 13. 14. nor the vse thereof to himselfe, vnlesse he be wise, not before men, but before God, which giueth him witnesse by his Spirite. Let vs note further, that if knowledge be not so much vsed as it ought to be, that it is for want of wisedome. But foolishnesse aboundeth, be∣cause that the number of fooles (as hath bene saide) is so great, and can not suffer that the tongue of the wise shoulde vse knowledge rightly. In Turkie no man wil suffer Iesus Christ to bee preached, that hee might be knowne to be our Sauiour with God his Father: as it is necessarie thereby to obteine life. In Poperie, some mention Iohn. 17. 3. shalbe made of Iesus Christ, and yet no man wil heare Saint Paule which hath rightly vsed knowledge, and hath saide, I esteemed not 1. Cor. 2. 2. to knowe any thing among you, saue Iesus Christ, and him crucifi∣ed. But they preferre an heape of trifles before Iesus Christ, who of God is made vnto vs wisdome. As touching the countries where the Gospel is purely preached, yet are they not cleane purged of 2. Cor. 1. 30. fooles. For we shal finde many which cannot abide vs to reprehend, to confute, to threaten them which liue slanderously and dissolute∣ly: and yet we must not so doe, if we wil rightly preach the Gospel, wherein is conteined repentance, vnto the which, for to exhort and bring the people, it is necessarie to crie out against vice and sinne, and to terrifie the consciences of those which are giuen to liue wicked∣ly. For to vse knowledge rightly, we must preache one onely Iesus Christ, and repentance, and remission of sinnes in his name. Luke. 34. 17. 3 The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good. If we haue in admiration, and giue reuerence to Kings and Prin∣ces of the earth, esteeming them wise and prudent, when they are verie careful and watchful to take heed to their subiects, for to know
how euery man doeth gouerne himselfe, that so much as they can, they may set al thinges in good order in their countries and domi∣nions (seeing that al the Empires, Kingdomes, and Princedomes of the worlde are nothing, in comparison of the soueraigne Lordship of our eternal God:) wee must needes bee rauished into a great wonderment, and wonderful astonishment, for to confesse the in∣estimable and incomprehensible wisedome of God, the which ouer∣seeth not one or two Kingdomes, nor by mediatours and interces∣sours (as Emperours and earthly Kings, how litle soeuer the length of their Kingdome is, haue not the power to looke ouer all and e∣uerie where, but haue neede to ordeine noble men heere and there to haue the ouersight, the guiding and gouernment of townes and villages, and that in their name and authoritie, they may set order a∣mongst the people) but hee himselfe ouerseeth al countries of the worlde, and euery particular person therin: and for to order things aright therin, he looketh not only vnto that which is done outward∣ly, as do the gouernorus of the earth: but hee perceth euen vnto the heart & thoughts, & cōsidereth & seeth al the cogitatiōs, thoughts, purposes, affectiōs & desires how deepe soeuer they be. Solomō doth expresse this same vnto vs in fewe words, when he saith, The eyes of the Lord, &c. The holy scripture attributeth sight & face vnto god. Now we cannot comprehende the sight & the face of God without eyes: and therefore the scripture applying it selfe vnto our capacitie, Gene. 1. 10. &. 32. 30. Exo. 3. 4. 7. &. 33. 11. Psa. 14. 2. Gene. 6. 8. &. 18. 3. Psal. 11. 4. 7 & 66. 7. Iob. 10. 4. Psal. 139. 7 doth attribute eyes vnto God. And yet he is a spirit, & hath no eyes. Doest thou see as man seeth? But the scripture yeelding to our dul∣nes, speaketh of God by similitudes, & doth attribute vnto him that which is corporal, that wee may the more easily comprehende that which he declareth vnto vs. Therfore when we see that the eyes of the Lord are in al places, let vs take heed to imagine any thing carnal in him, but let vs vnderstand, that the prouidence of God is of suche length and breadth, that hee looketh not onely to one parte of the world, but hath care of al, and nothing is hid from him: There is no deepe so profounde, but hee pearceth it: for hee hath made al, and ruleth all, and nothing standeth nor abideth but by his will and ordinance. And therefore Dauid by great admiration sayeth, Whither shall I flye from thy Spirite? But that which hee most regardeth in this worlde, is man, for
whom he hath created al things: & albeit he doth prouide for the beasts, yet his chiefe care is for men. Also the Scripture maketh of∣ten Math. 6. 25. 1. Cor. 9. 9. 10 mention of the sight of God ouer men. Likewise Solomon doth signifie here vnto vs after a sort that the eyes of the Lord are chiefly ouer mē. For albeit he saith that the eies of the Lord are in al places, & that he knew wel that the world was not void of beasts, yet hee saieth not that the eyes of the Lorde are ouer the beasts, but behol∣ding Psal. 11. 4. 7. the euil and the good. Albeit that of our vicious & corrupted nature we are al euil, yet, because that God of his grace hath elected some before the foundation of the worlde was layde, that we should &. 33. 13. 14. Gene. 6. 5. & 8. 21. Psal. 14. 3. Rom. 3. 9. Ephe. 2. 3. & 1. 4. be holy through loue: therefore Solomon letteth not to parte men into twayne: that is to say, into euil and good. And it might seeme that he nameth the euil first, because that al men by their nature are such, & those which are left in that nature are a far greater number thē are those which are reformed by the grace of god, & that we are first euil before we be good: & thus hee setteth our owne nature first before our eyes, that what goodnes soeuer we haue, we should not yet boast, as though we had chāged our own selues, & not that it came by the onely grace and meere mercy of our Lord God. I say expressely it might seeme, & not that it is so: for wee must compel no man to beleue that Solomon hath had this respect, in naming the euil before the good: although that that which is sayd, conteineth true and profitable doctrine to leade vs vnto humility & lowlines, as it is necessary for vs. But to come againe to that which Solomon mindeth to teach vs, let vs note that he first saith, that God behol∣deth the euil: by the which we must vnderstand them which de∣light to hurt and to doe euil vnto their neighboures, and doe hate goodnesse. These are they which are largely spoken of here before, and also in Ieremie. Such are the wicked, who are here spoken of, Pro. 1. 7. 10. 24. 2. 11. Iere. 4. 22. Solomon doth shew it whē he deuideth them from the good, whose goodnes is neuer so perfect but that stil some seed of euil remaineth, & that we should need continually to aske forgeuenes of our sinnes but goodnes is imputed vnto them, because they delight to do wel, and that the euil which is in them, displeaseth them. Contrarily, the euil haue no delight but too doe euil. And therefore when it is sayde that God beholdeth the euill, let vs knowe that it is not for delighte that hee hath in them nor in theyr wickednesse.
For Dauid saith, Thou art not a God which louest wickednes: nei∣ther shal any euil dwel with thee. The Lorde alloweth the righ∣teous: Psal. 5. 5. & 11. 4. &. 34. 15. but the vngodly and him that delighteth in wickednes doth his soule abhorre. The face of the Lorde is against them that doe euil: to roote out the remembrance of them from the earth. But contrarily, he beholdeth the good delighting in them, & preseruing them from destruction. The eyes of the Lord are ouer them which feare him, &c. The eyes of the Lord are ouer the righteous: and his eares are open vnto their prayers. Againe, When the righteous crie, the Lorde heareth them. But the Lordes delight is in them that feare him, and put their trust in his mercy. Moreouer let vs Psa. 33. 18. &. 34. 16. 17 18. &. 147. 11. note, that the Lord doth not see as man seeth onely outwardly, but he seeth & knoweth euē the very bottome of him. Let not the wic∣ked thē loke to auoid punishmēt: seeing they haue to do with him who is righteous, and almightie. And let the good, what euill soeuer they suffer, not feare to perishe: seeing that the almightie, who is merciful, careth for them. Finally, let vs note that it is vnpossible to make any image or likenesse for to represent God, forasmuche as his eyes are in al places. 4 A whole some tongue is as a tree of life: but the froward∣nesse thereof is the breaking of the minde. Forasmuche as wee al desire life, and chiefly that which lasteth longest, and if wee bee gentle and merciful vnto our neighbours, we desire their health, and are very glad to bee the cause of the sauing of their life, & we delight therein: Forasmuch as it is so, I say, we must not be negligent of that which is proper and meete therevnto, but diligent to seeke it, and hauing obteined it, to keepe it, and to pra∣ctise it as it shalbee expedient. The worldlings thinke that there needeth nothing but abundance of temporal wealth for to liue, to bee at our ease, to haue our delightes and pleasures of the fleshe, to auoide sorrowe and Melancholie, and to bee mery: and therefore with al their desires and affections, they giue themselues vnto ga∣thering and seeking al the pastimes they can imagine: but the life consisteth not heerein, as hath been handeled. The children of God must not stay at these worldly things and carnal for to liue, but must
seeke other meanes, amongest the which is an wholesome tongue: as Solomon doeth teache vs, saying, A wholesome tongue is as the tree of life. There is health in the tongue, when the hearte is not double, and is not infected with lying, & deceit, and other wic∣kednesses: but is indewed with simplicitie and vprightnesse, and is filled with trueth and other vertues: by the abundance whereof, the mouth speaketh. Then the tongue which is wholesome, is as a tree of life. For as the tree of life planted in the midst of the garden of Eden, brought foorth fruite, of the which if man had eaten, hee had liued for euer: euen so a wholesome tongue bringeth foorth 2. 9. Gene. &. 3. 22. the fruite of trueth, the which quickeneth those which are partakers thereof. For to be partakers thereof, wee must drawe neere to the wise, not with our bodies, but by consent & agrement. The tongue of the wise is health. The instruction of the wise is as the spring of Pro. 12. 18. &. 13. 14. life. Wee must thus drawe neere to them, and not to draw back: for by them doeth Iesus communicate himselfe vnto vs, whome wee must heare: in whome onely we must beleeue, and say to him with the Apostles, Lorde, to whome shal wee goe? Thou hast the wordes of eternal life, of the which al they are partakers, which in faith and obedience receiue the Gospel by the mouth of those which preache Iohn. 6. 68. it purely. By them doth the tongue of the Lord sound foorth, which hath said, He that heareth you, heareth me. Behold the chief helth of the tongue: and also the doctrine which proceedeth thereof is cal∣led wholesome doctrine: and they which receiue it are sounde in faith, by the which wee obteine life. And therefore, wee must all learne of this tongue to frame ours, so doing wee shalbee by our tongues, health, & a tree of life both to ourselues and to our neigh∣bours. Mat. 12. 37. Pro. 12. 6. 14 Pro. 4. 20. 21 22. 23. 24. Thou shalt bee iustified by thy wordes. Let vs then drawe neere vnto an wholsome tongue, and let vs hearken diligently ther∣vnto: as wee haue beene admonished. If we worke after this sort, it shal come to passe that as wee drawe neere truely vnto the wise, euen so shal wee bee endued with wisedome, the which is the tree of life to them which lay holde vpon it. But if wee despise to haue an wholesome tongue, there is no life in vs, neither for vs, nor for Pro. 3. 18. our neighbours, but destruction. Solomon doeth shewe it, say∣ing. But the frowardnesse thereof is the breaking of the minde.
Therefore when we care not to speak wel, and that we breake forth into the wicked and dissolute wordes, wee loose our soules: Thou shalt be condemned by thy wordes. The foolishe in talke shalbee Mat. 12. 37. Pro. 10. 8. &. 12. 13. & 13. 17. beaten. The mouth of the foole is a present destruction. The tongue of the froward shalbe cut out. The euil mā is snared by the wicked∣nesse of his lippes. A wicked messenger falleth into euil. Also we de∣stroy as many as doe heare vs, so much as in vs lieth: Euil wordes, corrupt good manners. Faire wordes and sweete sayings, deceiue 1. Cor. 15. 33 Rom. 16. 18. the heartes of the simple. Wee are heere then taught to bee atten∣tiue to heare those which speake wel and honestly: and also to ac∣custome ourselues to vse our tongues as wee ought. And because that the tongue should be guided after the disposition of the hearte, wee haue neede to aske a cleane heart, &c. According to Gods pro∣mise, Psa. 15. 12. Eze. 36. 25. Psa. 51. 17. I will powre vpon you cleane water, and wash you cleane, &c. In this sort the Lorde wil open our lippes, and our mouthes shal shewe foorth his praise. 5 A foole despiseth his fathers instruction: but he that re∣gardeth correction, is prudent. We al naturally doe iudge that a childe ought to receiue the com∣mandements of his father, and to submit himselfe vnto his corre∣ction and chastening: otherwise hee is counted a foole, and with∣out discretion. And sith that our iudgement is such, and that wee woulde not bee counted fooles and without discretion, let vs heare our father who doeth teache vs & exhort vs to receiue his correcti∣ons. If wee wil doe this same as we ought, we must neither behold the earth, nor the worlde: but forasmuch as we haue one onely fa∣ther in heauen, wee ought for to lift vp our inwarde eyes thither: that is to say, our heartes and mindes, and to bee diligent too heare Mat. 23. ▪ what it pleaseth him to commande vs, for to obey him, and patient∣ly to beare the corrections that hee shal sende vs. Yet neuerthelesse we shold not ceasse to submit ourselues vnto mē which haue supe∣rioritie, & authoritie ouer vs, which haue taken the charge to teach vs, to guide and rule vs, and haue power to chasten and correct vs: otherwise we should be fooles, as Solomon declareth, saying, A foole despiseth his fathers instruction. For al such worthie men
are our fathers, and for such ought we to esteeme them: as also the Scripture doeth attribute this name of father vnto them, because it hath pleased God to impart his honour and his power, and autho∣ritie vnto them. If then we wil not be disobedient vnto our fa∣ther, and be counted fooles, let vs not refuse the instruction of those fathers that God hath appointed for vs in this world: but let vs ho∣nour them, and yeelde vnto them obedience after the degree where∣in God hath placed them. Let children honour father and mother then. Let euery man be subiect vnto the higher powers: Giue vnto Exo. 20. 12. Ephe. 6. 1. Rom. 13. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13. Mat. 22. 21. Ephe. 6. 5. Collo. 3. 22. 1. Pet. 2. 18. Caesar that which belongeth vnto Caesar. Let seruants obey their Maisters. Al these are fathers for the body, to whome we must obey and suffer chastisements, if wee wil auoide to be counted fooles, and to beare the name of discrete, prudent, and wise: as Solomon saith heere. But hee that regardeth correction, is prudent. Now if God wil haue men to knowe our discretion and wisedome knowne by the obedience wee giue them, and by the pacience that wee haue to beare, and to suffer the corrections of suche fathers: by a more Heb. 12. 9. strong reason wee ought to submit vs vnto our heauenly father. For to obey him rightly, wee must heare and receiue his worde with al humblenesse, feare and reuerence, the which is declared vnto vs by the Ministers and Pastours of the Churche, who doe beget vs ther∣by so much as in them lyeth, when they doe preache the same vnto vs faithfully. But because the world is ful almost of an infinit nūber of those which name themselues fathers, but they are cruel, tyrants, murderers, and mankillers, not onely of their bodies, but also of their soules: as are the Pope and his mainteiners, Bishops, Priests, and Monkes: as are al Kings and Princes, which would haue their subiectes to doe homage vnto that Antichrist of Rome, by the ob∣seruation of their traditions and doctrines of men, the which leade men to perdition: we ought not to bee ready to receiue their instru∣ctions, nor obey their corrections, for then should wee be fooles, and vndiscrete: wee shoulde not haue the discretion and wisdome that our heauenly father demandeth of vs, when hee doeth admo∣nish vs by his sonne Iesus Christ our Lord, Take heed and beware Math. 7. 15. Rom. 16. 17. Gala. 3. 1. of false Prophetes. &c. And by Saint Paule: but as fooles and vn∣discrete, wee should deserue to bee reproued as were the the folishe
Galathians. And albeit that wee must giue honour and obedience vnto Princes, though they were not faithful vnto God: yet if they command any thing which cannot be obserued without the disho∣nour Act. 4. 19. & 5. 29. of God, we must in no wise obey them, but rather tel them, It is better to obey God, than men. 6 The house of the righteous hath muche treasure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble. There is no man that desireth to bee poore, neither would that his family shoulde want any thing: and they which are needie are very glad when they finde an house furnished, and that they hope to receiue some helpe of that which they neede. Euen so there is none but desireth to haue enough for to mainteine himself in this world∣ly and temporall life. But al men knowe not how to gouerne themselues to come by it. The worldlings and carnal men say, That for to get great riches, and come to wealth, wee neede but turne our backe vnto God. And though they did not speake thus, yet wil they not ceasse to haue this opinion: as wee may knowe it, by the man∣ner and custome they vse to heape riches together. Although they labour to make themselues beleeue, and also woulde haue other to beleeue, that they are honest men, and that they would doe wrong to no man: And indeede for a certaine time, after the outward ap∣parance they wil florish and prosper, doing their thinges at pleasure. And for this cause the children of God are tempted to follow them, that they also may liue at ease. And therefore, that suche wayes are wicked and detestable before God, and also condemned in the con∣sciences of the wicked (for they knowe wel that they woulde take it in euil part, & would not willingly beare it, if any mā laboured to doe them wrong that they doe vnto their neighbors) for this cause wee are admonished not to enuie those which commit wickednes. By the course of the Psalme, wee may vnderstande that the meanes Psal. 73. 2. 3. Psa. 37. to attaine vnto abundance of riches, is to followe righteousnesse, that is, that in assuring ourselues of the goodnesse of God towards vs, wee might faithfully followe our vocation, in doing no wrong vnto our neighbours, but yeelding that which wee owe them, according as the worde of God doeth teache vs. So doing, we shall
haue our houses filled with plentie of goodes and shal quietly en∣ioye them, as God doeth promise in his lawe. Solomon in folowing of the lawe, hath promised such aboundance. But for to assure vs further, and to leade vs vnto righteousnes, he doeth now againe set Leui. 26. Deut. 28. Pro. 3. 9. 10. 33. &. 11. 24. 25. &. 13. 21. 22. &. 14. 11. the selfe same promise before vs, when he sayth. The house of the righteous hath much treasure. This sentence ought well to leade vs to follow righteousnes, without doubting whither Solomō sayth trueth or no. For albeit we see the righteous very often in outward sight & after mans iudgement, to suffer much pouertie, & to be very miserable, neuertheles according to the iudgement of the spirit their houses haue much treasure, because they haue ynough and are con∣tented, which is more woorth, and are of greater profit then all the riches of worldlinges and carnall men. Let vs then vnderstand that the greatnes of their substance doeth not stand in outward abun∣dance, but in that that they haue wherewith too sustaine them, and that they are readie to help their neighbours with that which they haue. And thus the needy ought to be glad to come to the houses of the righteous: for after as they haue neede, they will helpe their necessitie. Albeit then that we haue the rich men of the worlde in admiration, and that we proclaime them honest men, yet (as we may know by their kinde of doings) they are not righteous, and what a∣bundance of welth soeuer they haue, yet haue they not in their houses any great welth, seeing that for the greatest part of them they haue neuer ynough and doe feare lest the world should fayl them. If then we would haue ynough, contentation, and peace in our houses let vs studie vpon righteousnes and delight therein. For without it there is nothing but sorrowe and trouble, doubtfulnes and vnqui∣etnes, albeit that we labour to be merry and ioyfull when we think we haue yeerely rentes ynough and aboundant: Solomon doth sig∣nifie it saying, but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble. The wicked doth not possesse that which he hath with a sound con∣science, for eyther he vseth deceit or rauening, or he hath neuer y∣nough, or he is vexed if his land doeth not profite and growe as hee would haue it, or if he spende more largely then hee woulde: and therefore he stampeth and fretteth eyther in body or mynde, or with both togeather, and hath no quienesse, but tormenteth him∣selfe,
and chideth and brauleth often with his housholde, or with his neighbours. 7 The lippes of the wise do spread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the foolish doeth not so. We are so couetous of honour and glorie, that it grieueth vs at the heart to be counted fooles, though we bee naturally such, and cannot of ourselues become other. Contrarily, we are very glad when wee thinke that wee are counted wise, or that wee can make ourselues beleeue that we are so. And to mainteine vs in such repu∣tation wee apply ourselues to doe goodlie things outwardly, and which seeme to bee of great profit before the people, either for our¦selues, or for our neighbours. For seeing that men knowe not the thoughtes of man, but as by the effectes which are shewed out∣wardly, therefore we cannot bee counted wise of our neighbours, except that we set ourselues to do or speake some things, the which they may esteeme to proceede of wisedom after the sight of man & iudgement of the flesh. But commonly both we and they are decei∣ued in our estimation and iudgement: as we may now know, if we throughly consider what we were in thoughtes, words, and works, when we were in that horrible darkenesse of ignorance vnder the tyranny of the Pope. We thought then there was no wisedome in the world but there. The holie Ghost doth teach vs by Solomon to iudge otherwise: to witte, that they which imparte knowledge so largely as they can, and delight to make their neighbours partakers with them thereof, that it may fructifie, are wise, when hee sayth, The lips of the wise, &c. We cannot therefore boast ourselues to be wise, because we are not so, except wee bee liberal of our know∣ledge, and doe gladly imparte it according to the state whereunto God hath called vs, and are not enuious nor sory to see our neigh∣bours to profit with vs of our industrie, paine and labour, and that they get by our meanes some knowledge or any arte for to knowe howe to spende their tyme in the seruice of God and of their neigh∣bours, that they may not bee vnprofitable. But GOD must allowe our arte and occupation: for there is no knowledge, but that which God teacheth vs by his worde, and that he alloweth therby.
Except he become our teacher, and that he himselfe open the lippes of the wise for to spread abroade knowledge, the worlde must needs bee filled with ignorance: For the Lorde giueth wisedome, Pro. 2. 6. out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderstanding. Euen so although Solomon doth attribute the seede or spreading abroade of knowledge vnto the lippes, yet is it not to say that knowledge can∣not be imparted by no other meanes but by the lippes. True it is that the worde of God, out of which we learne al knowledge, is taught by the lippes, and that there is no knowledge but onely that which God teacheth, and that the chiefe and most necessarie parte of knowledge is communicated by the lippes of the Pastours and ministers of the Churche: but as they alone are not wise, euen so also they teache not themselues alone al knowledge. They which leade an holie and honest life occupying themselues faythfully in their estate & vocation for to helpe their neighbours at their need, do sowe knowledge, though they should speake neuer a word with their mouthes. Their manners and fashion of dooing, their studies and exercises do speake and teache: and so they shead and spread a∣broade knowledge according to the measure of the wisedome that God giueth them by his worde, after the which wee must order all, and must thereby guyde al things. And to do the same, the wise must speake: and it is for this cause why Solomon sayth that the lippes of the wise shal spread abrode knowledge. Heeretofore hee hath well shewed vs that knowledge may be opened & communicated other¦wise then by the lippes: Euery wise man wil worke by knowledge: Pro. 13. 16. but the mouth, the tongue and the lippes are the principal organes and instrumentes for to set it foorth, when they are moued of the hart therunto, which is the seale of knowledge, wisedom, & vnder∣standing. Solomon doth signifie it, whē he doth not simply say, The lippes shal spread abroade: but he saith, The lippes of the wise shall spread abrode. He doth signifie it againe, when against the lippes of the wise, he setteth the hart of fooles, saying, But the hart of the foolish doth not so. And it is asmuch as if he did say, forasmuch as the wise haue receiued, and doe receiue knowledge into their harts & minds, they do spread the same abrode by their lippes. But fooles do despise knowledge and instruction: and therfore their hart which is voide of knowledge, cannot leade the lips to spread abrode that
knowledge which they haue not: but they must declare and babble out follie whereof they be ful. For to teache the which follie, we need to spende much labour there about: wee do but to much learne it: for it is natural vnto al men. It is not so with knowledge: for the wise must labour much to teache it, as Solomon doeth signi∣fie heere, when hee compareth it vnto seede. For as the ploweman doth not sowe his good seede without paine and care, and yet after his trauell it doeth not al prosper: euen so although the wise be very careful to spread abrode knowledge, yet doeth it not prosper Matt. 13. 3. as it ought to do: experience teacheth it, and our Lord doth giue it wel to vnderstande. Let vs then vnderstande that Solomon compa∣ring knowledge vnto seede, doeth after a sorte accuse men of ingra∣titude, because they despise the liberalitie of the Lorde, which doth not spare to hide knowledge from them. The foolish doe not nowe take heede thereof, but heereafter they shal feele that they are not accused in vaine. 8 The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is accep∣table vnto him. Men haue at al times holden a certaine manner whereby they haue made profession that they had some kinde of religion, and that they woulde serue and honour God. And this hath not onely beene obserued of the good, but also of the wicked. But God neuer accep∣ted the seruice of the wicked: as hee shewed vnto Caine, and as Gen. 4. 3. 5. wee may gather of the Scripture, when from the death of righteous. Abel, it speaketh not that any did serue God, vntil that it saith, That Seth had a sonne, &c. This is not to say that men tyl then did offer Gen. 4. 26. no sacrifices nor oblations, as a seruice vnto GOD: but that they were so corrupted, that God did not accept their seruice, and the multitude of the wicked caused that no man coulde easily discerne whether there were any Churche of God or no, tyl Enoch was borne. Euen so then wee may wel knowe that God allowed not the sacrifices of the wicked: as also hee hath shewed in the time of Exo. 32. 7. Num. 16. 21 Psal. 40. 7. Moses, and hath likewise declared by his Prophetes. Wee haue nowe Solomon which doeth pronounce it plainely, when hee saith,
The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde. By Sacrifice, Solomon vnderstandeth whatsoeuer is doone outwardly &. 50. 8. &. 51. 18. Esay. 66. 3. Mich. 6. 6. 7. for to serue God withal, which hath apparance of holinesse and re∣ligion, and which is ordeined of God for his honor, and for to make profession when one wil protest to bee of his people. Hee pro∣nounceth that al suche kinde of seruice is nothing worth, but to vexe and despite GOD, and to prouoke him to anger and wrath, when it is doone by the wicked which haue no feare nor reuerence of his word, nor beare any loue vnto their neighbors, though they labour to make themselues beleeue it, and woulde haue men beleeue that they are deuout and good Catholikes. Let the wicked there∣fore which haue no minde to amend their liues, but waxe obstinate and hardened in their malice, resorte vnto the Sermons, let them re∣ceiue the Supper of the Lorde, and let them doe outwardly al the workes of a Christian, yet doe they nothing but all abhomination before the Lorde. True it is that they shalbee greatly praised of those which know not their wickednesse, & shalbe esteemed more holy and deuout, than honest and good men: as also they labour to bee preferred before them. Solomon doth signifie it after a sorte, when hee doeth attribute to the wicked that they doe offer sacri∣fice: the which is a thing of greater apparance then is the praier which Solomon doeth attribute vnto the righteous, But the prai∣er of the righteous is aceptable vnto him. Wherein the faithful and children of God are warned to walke in righteousnesse, with∣out declining from it, and that in al their necessities they shoulde direct their praiers vnto God, not seeking to bee seene of men, and shoulde not bee troubled, though the seruice they doe vnto God, is not of such gret price before the world, as the goodly visour of the wicked. Yet notwithstanding let them bee greeued that the worlde iudgeth so wickedly: but as touching them, let them bee Mat. 6. 5. contented to bee assured that God doeth willingly heare them, for to grant vnto their petitions. Solomon doth giue vs this to vnder∣stād, when he saith, That their praier is acceptable vnto the Lord. When hee speaketh thus, hee sheweth vnto vs that they which are righteous in hearte, are neuer refused, but that God doth de∣light to helpe them in their necessities. Diuers Saints haue proued
it true: and amongest others, Dauid: I besought the Lorde, and he hearde mee. The Lorde saith, To him wil I looke, euen to him that is poore, and of a contrite spirite, and trembleth at my wordes. Like∣wise Psa. 34. 5. Esay. 66. 2. we may heere learne, that for to be assured that our praiers are acceptable vnto the Lorde, wee must haue testimonie in our heartes that wee truely hate wickednesse, and that righteousnesse doeth please vs: Wel beloued brethren, if our heart condemne vs not, 1. Ioh. 3. 21. 22. then haue wee boldnesse towardes God, And whatsoeuer we aske, we receiue of him. But what righteousnes soeuer is in vs, yet doeth it not deserue to be heard. When God heareth vs in our righteous∣nesse, it is of his only pleasure, and good wil that he beareth towards vs: as Solomon doeth signifie by the worde which is interpreted acceptable vnto him. Wherein the faithful ought greatly to bee comforted, when they vnderstande that they are in fauour with the Lorde, which oweth them naught, nor yet standeth bounde vnto them for any thing. For the good wil hee beareth them, is not to do them good onely in this worlde, but to saue them eternally: as the righteous by their praiers tend chiefly therevnto, knowing that the worlde passeth away. And forasmuch as the Papistes doe cal their Masse a Sacrifice, they may see heere that when it is celebrated by the wicked, that it is nothing els but abhomination to the Lorde: and so it is then of no profite: the which is against their foolish opi∣nion: to wit, that their masse celebrated by a wicked Prieste, is of as great efficacie as if it were saide by a good. But forasmuch as the good doe not allowe stincking and abhominable idolatrie, therefore it followeth that all they which celebrate the Masse, are nothing worth: for it is the most wicked idolatrie that euer was inuented in the worlde. 9 The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteousnesse. Forasmuch as we doe al naturally consent and agree that God which is true must bee honoured, therefore wee must take heede from allowing that hee shoulde bee falsified and proued a lyar: as it semeth reasonable to al men, except they bee out of their wittes, past shame, and altogether possessed of the Deuil. But albeit that we cōfesse that it is very reasonable & that it should be too great wic∣kednes for to belie god, yet diuers of those which wil speak so for to
shewe themselues wise and very zelous of the honour of God, will wel allowe the manners, fashions, and trades of the wicked, their counsels, enterprises and threatenings: as they shew when they pro∣nounce them to be honest men: the which is to make God a lyar, who declareth vnto vs that hee reiecteth and forsaketh, & counteth whatsoeuer the wicked doe take in hande for wickednesse, though it haue a goodly shew of righteousnesse, vprightnesse and reason. He doth lo pronoūce it by Solomon, saying, The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde. When hee attributeth way vnto the wicked, hee doeth yeeld vnto our rudenesse, & speaketh after an humane and carnal sense: for truely the wicked doe holde no way, but the same of perdition. And it is not without cause that hee speaketh thus: for albeit that the threateninges and doinges of the wicked haue some kinde of reason, and that it seemeth they are zea∣lous of righteousnesse & equitie, neuerthelesse as they are wicked, euen so doe they walke in wickednesse, the which is their way. So∣lomon doeth shew it wel, when against way, hee setteth righteous∣nesse, saying, But he loueth him that followeth righteousnesse. We wil heare take iustice, for the manners and trade of life of the righteous, which desire nothing but to yeelde to euery one his du∣tie, as they are bounde by the worde of God. But because that such righteousnesse proceedeth from an heart purified by faith, the Lorde loueth him that followeth him, and which laboureth to con∣forme himselfe vnto his God: for the worde of the Lorde is true, Psal. 33. 4. 5. &. 11. 8. and al his workes are faithful. Hee loueth righteousnesse & iudge∣ment, &c. For the righteous Lorde loueth righteousnesse: his countenance wil behold the thing that is iust. Let vs therefore fol∣lowe righteousnesse, the which is not to frame ourselues after this worlde. For the wil of God is the onely rule of perfect righteousnes. And let vs diligently thinke with ourselues, that it is no smal grace Rom. 12. 4. to bee beloued of the Lord: and contrarily, that it is a thing great∣ly to be feared, for to bee abhorred of him. For God loueth not the righteous for one time onely: but hee continueth to loue them: as Solomon doeth somewhat signifie by the Verbe of the Futuretence which he vseth. And the Lord shal shew them this im∣mutable loue, when he shal giue them the eternal possession of the heauenly kingdome. He hath loued thē before the foūdation of the
worlde was laide, wherevpon it followeth that hee wil alwaies loue them, for hee is vnchangeable. The giftes and calling of God are without repentance. And forasmuch as he hath loued vs before the Rom. 11. 28. foundation, therefore it followeth wel that it is not for our righte∣ousnesse, but of his onely grace and goodnesse, and for the loue of Christe, in whome hee loueth vs. Wee are not more worthie then the ildren of Israel, to whome Moses saith, Because he hath loued Deut. 4. 37. & 7. 6. & 9. 4. thy fathers, and hath chosen their seede after them, he hath brought thee out of Egypt. The Lorde thy God hath chosen thee to bee a people for himselfe: doe not thinke in thine hearte, &c. The Lorde for my righteousnesse hath brought mee into this lande. Also our following of righteousnesse is neuer suche, that it can deserue the loue of God. For albeit that in folowing righteousnesse we doe giue a certaine witnesse that wee loue God, yet is it not to say, that thereby wee can binde God to loue vs: but of his grace and goodnes hepreuenteth vs. And thus, forasmuch as God for the loue that hee beareth vs, doeth make vs to folowe righteousnesse, to loue him, and to loue his worke in vs, and doeth accept it, and giue vnto it a rewarde of his grace and liberalitie, and not that hee oweth, 1. Iohn. 4. 10. neither that hee can owe any thing to him that followeth righte∣ousnesse: but the loue which hee beareth to them that followe righteousnesse, is but a continuation of the same, which was before the foundation of the worlde. This perseuerance and continuation of loue ought to bee a spurre to make vs not to walke, but to runne 1. Cor. 9. Gala. 5. 2. Tim. 4. Acts. 13. & 20. 24. in the path of righteousnesse. And also the life and conuersation of a Christian is compared vnto a course or rase in running. 10 Instruction is euill to him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, shall die. Solomon hath often spoken of instruction, in exhorting vs to receiue it, by praysing them which receiue and keepe it, in complai∣ning also of them which reiect it, blaming and threatening them. And then and there wee haue declared that instruction consisteth in doctrine, in exhortations, reprehensions, admonitions, corrections, threateninges, punishments and chastisements: which are thinges very profitable and necessary for men, after the conuersation they
leade, and as they are disposed: and therefore they ought to counted good, when they are applied vnto vs by the wise which can tel how to vse them, not after our fantasie, but as they see is needeful for vs. Neuerthelesse there is almost no man but is greeued, as expe∣rience doth teach vs by the great number of rebels, whereof the worlde is ful. Solomon also doeth shewe it, when he saith, Instru∣ction is euill to him that forsaketh the way. Forasmuch as hee which forsaketh the way, doeth finde instruction euil, and doth not like of it, it followeth therefore that it doeth naturally displease all: for there is none but leueth and forsaketh the way when hee is gui∣ded after the corruption of his nature, the which bringeth and lea∣deth vs to thinke and consider of ourselues great thinges, and to make vs beleeue that wee are wise enough, to rule and gouerne our¦selues, without hauing need of instruction, & we think that we are wronged if any man medle to shewe, or correct, and reproue vs: and doe hate those which labour to bring vs the right way by exhortati∣ons, and instructions, by corrections and threatenings. Thus do∣ing wee stande in a poore state, and in great peril: and if God by his grace and goodnesse did not withdrawe vs, and set vs againe in the way that hee sheweth vs by his worde, wee goe vnto death. For he that hateth correction, shal die, euen eternal death. Wherefore we must change our nature, or rather that God woulde change it in vs: for of ourselues wee cannot: and shoulde take suche heede to our¦selues that we should not forsake his way wherein the Lord hath set vs and dayly doth set vs by his word. Otherwise we should be af∣flicted as were the people of Israel, and shoulde finde instruction e∣uil, and hate correction, and therefore wee should die: as Solomon doth threaten vs therewith. 11 Hell and destruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the sonnes of men? When the wicked doe follow any cause which is not good, they labour by al meanes that possibly they can to abuse the iudges, and to cause them to finde theirs to be good, either by subtil inuentiōs, and great heapes of rowling wordes, either by giftes or presents, or by importunate praiers that they cause their friendes & kinsmen to make for them: & if they can by any meanes, they wil work that the
iudges shal not know their wrong matter, and shal not see the iniu∣tie that they labour to doe vnto their neighbor. And if they behaue thēselues vnfaithfully towardes the earthly iudges, they thinke and say much more euil of God. For forasmuch as they see not God be∣fore thē, and that he doth not punish them incontinently for their wronges, iniuries, and violences, they thinke that God maketh no account of those whom they doe wrong vnto, and that he hath for∣saken them, or that he seeth not what they doe, or els that there is no God. The Scripture doth giue vs witnesse that such are the affe∣ctions and thoughts of the wicked: But I am a worme, and no man. Ps. 22. 7. 8. 9. &. 71. 9. &. 10. 12. &. 94 7. &. 14. 1 &c. They, which see me, laugh me to scorne. He trusted in God that he would deliuer him. Againe, For mine enimies speak against me, & they that lay waite for my soule, take their counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him, persecute him, & take him, for there is none to deliuer him. He hath saide in his heart, tush, God hath forgot∣ten, &c. And yet they say, tush, the Lorde shal not see: neither shall the God of Iacob regarde it. The foole hath said in his heart, there is no God. Likewise when the good and innocent bee afflicted and persecuted, either in their goods, or in their persons, without desert at their enimies handes, and that the euil which is wrought against them is great and of long continuance in their iudgement, and that they see not how they shal escape out of it, they thinke that God is departed frō thē, & hath forsaken thē, or that he knoweth not their innocencie, & maketh no count to defend thē, & to mainteine their good cause. We may see this same by the cōplaintes that the Saints do make in the scripture, Why stādest thou so far off, O Lord, & hi∣dest thy face in the needful time of trouble? How long wilt thou for∣get Psa. 10. 1. &. 13. 2. & 44. 24. &. 73 12. 13. me (O Lorde) for euer: How long wilt thou hide thy face from mee? Vp Lorde, why sleepest thou? awake and bee not absent from vs for euer. Loe these are vngodly, these prosper in the worlde, and these haue riches in possession: and I haue saide, then haue I clean∣sed my heart in vaine, and washed my handes in innocencie. Behold the blasphemies which the wicked doe maliciously & against their consciences, vse against the Lorde: and also the complaints that the Saints make by the infirmitie of their fleshe. Nowe for to repell and put bake the blasphemies of the wicked, & to withstande the com∣plaints of the righteous and innocent: for to shewe the wicked that
they can neither speake nor thinke so secretely but that God seeth and knoweth wholy for to yeeld vnto them as their malice hath de∣serued: and for to make the righteous to vnderstand that God is not ignorant of their innocencie and integritie of their heartes, and that according thereto hee wil recompence them: Solomon saith, Hell and destruction are before the Lorde, &c. Or, the gulfe and bottomelesse pit. Hee doeth teache vs heere that there is no∣thing hid so deepely, that God seeth not clearely and plainely: as al∣so Dauid doeth shewe vs. We must not wonder at this for to doubt Psal. 139. 1. thereof, seeing that it is he who hath created al things, and disposed al, who hath placed euery thing as it pleased him: hee ruleth al, and al thinges are guided by his prouidence, and there is nothing that can remoue from his place, except he commande it. I am the Lord, and there is no God besides mee. And therefore, the wicked are rightly reproued. Take heede yee vnwise among the people: O yee Esay. 45. 5. Psal. 94. 8. 9. fooles, when wil yee vnderstande? Hee that planted the care, shal hee not heare? or hee that made the eie, shal he not see? And there∣fore, let this present sentence serue to leade vs to thinke carefully that wee are continually before the Lorde: and so consequently to make vs walke in feare and obedience, as good children ought to doe, in the presence of their fathers. And in this feare let vs assure ourselues that wee shal neuer want, seeing that the eies of our fa∣ther are alwaies vpon vs. 12 A scorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wise. Solomon heere shortly describeth what the scorners are: to wit, that they take not in good part, to bee either disprooued, or rebuked: but doe refuse al correction, and doe hate them which re∣proue thē. For sith that betwene hatred & loue, there is no meane, it must needes followe that they hate those whome they loue not. For further to expresse this hatred, and for to shewe that they doe wrongfully hate those which reproue them, hee saith, That the scorner wil not goe vnto the wise. In this worde will not goe, hee sheweth that the scorners doe withdrawe themselues so farre as Pro. 1. 24. 25 29. 30. they can, and wil not hearken diligently vnto the counselles of those which reprooue them: as hee hath declared more at large.
In this worde goeth not, or, wil not goe, wee may see the hatred to be expressed: for if they did not hate them which reprooue them, they would goe vnto them not with their corporal feete onley, but chiefly would runne vnto them, with their minde and affectiō, and would yeeld their heartes and mindes attentiue vnto their wisdom for to be partakers thereof, and would not so diligently and so ear∣nestly persecute the rebukers whome Solomon calleth wise. And thus they goe but too much with their bodies vnto the wise. Nei∣ther is it of this kinde of going that Solomon speaketh, albeit, wee must seeke the companie & acquaintance of the wise, for to receiue instruction of them. And forasmuch as the scorners doe hate those which doe reprooue them, it foloweth, they are murtherers. Here∣vpon Math. 5. 22. 1. Iohn. 3. 13 we may knowe, that scorning and mockerie is a great wicked∣nesse, and that the scorners are most wicked, and that the gallowes of hel is prepared for suche, as for wicked murtherers: though they bragge to be honest men. Nowe that they doe wrongfully & with∣out cause hate those which rebuke them, Solomon doeth shewe it, when hee calleth the rebukers, wise: for sith they are wise, they take diligent heede from hurting of any man: but they labour to speake by wisedome, that they may profite their neighbours. But we might demaund howe Solomon doth here attribute wisdome vnto those Pro. 10. 11. 20. 21. 31. & 13. 20. Pro. 9. 7. 8. which rebuke scorners: seeing that he, hauing declared what trou∣ble happeneth to him which correcteth the scorner, doeth forbid to rebuke the scorner. For if it were wisely done to rebuke, he would not forbid it. For to absolute this, wee must runne vnto the expositi∣on of these two sentences. Wee may also say, that Solomon doeth not here declare how the wise ought to behaue themselues towards the scorners: but he sheweth what affections and desires the scor∣ners haue against the wise, and whereby we might know a man to be a scorner: to wit, when he sheweth himselfe euil affectioned to∣wardes them which labour to amend him, and that hee doeth de∣spise and not vse their companie to be instructed by them. Wherein we see that wee may rebuke the Nicodemites of scorning: for they loue not those which rebuke them, for their dissembling against their consciences: and also resort not to the companie of the faith∣ful, where God is purely and freely serued: they beleeus they are wise enough, and regard not to goe vnto the wise whom God hath
ordeined Pastours & Doctors of his Church, for to vtter faithfully true wisdome, and to teach it vnto his people, by admonishing, dis∣proouing, rebuking, and threatening. And if the Nicodemites ought to be rebuked of scorning, by a more strong reason ought they to be rebuked, which by the grace of God haue had wisemen sent vnto them for to instruct them, & yet, to the great contempt of the Go∣spel, and of those which preach it, do wallow in al dissolution: so that the more they are rebuked, the more they doe them. These mockers here, if they heare that we do cal ourselues wise, wil mocke & laugh therat, saying, That we presume much of ourselues, & in scorning-wise, wil say, Behold our wise men. But we wil answere therto, that it is God which calleth vs wise. Likewise S. Paule forbeareth not to cal himselfe wise: and saith, that he speaketh wisedome: hee saieth Mat. 23. 33. 1. Cor. 3. 10. &. 2. 6. Collo. 1. 28. also that he teacheth euerie man in al wisedome. Now we haue the selfe same office which Saint Paule had, and wee can not teach wise∣dome except we be wise, not of ourselues, but by the spirit of God. Notwithstanding, wee doe not so attribute wisedome to ourselues, that nothing more may bee added: but wee confesse that wee haue neede of daily encrease in the same. 13 A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the sorow of the heart the minde is heauie. We are very glad whē our neighbors do beare vs a louing coun∣tenance: and if we loue them truely, we desire to shewe them a me∣rie looke, because we would not grieue them. Now forasmuch as a ioyful heart (as Solomon saieth) maketh a chearful countenance: it foloweth therefore first of al, that wee ought to labour to cheare vp our neighbours, not after a worldly and carnal maner, which wil vse pleasant tales, foolish toyes, and vaine flatterings, lyes, and slan∣deringes for to passe away the time with as naughtie people as them¦selues. But we wil endeuoure to make them glad, in not doing them wrong, and procuring their wealth towardes God, so muche as we can to the vttermost of our power: and chiefly their spiritual wealth: for there is no true ioye in the heart, without this spiritual wealth. The ambitious, auaritious, whoremongers, theeues, gluttons, and al dissolute persons will reioyce when they haue all that they can
wishe and desire: but they can not haue a ioyful heart, as they well shewe by their grutching and murmuring, and dispightfulnes that they make: albeit that oftentimes they force themselues to laugh with open throte, and to take al the pleasures that possibly they can: neuerthelesse by other actes and words, & by other gestures, which partly come from the face, they shewe that they haue no inwarde ioye, when their countenance sheweth it not. For the face of man is al that is shewed outwardly: for the word which Solomon vseth, standeth alwayes plural, and commeth of a verbe which signifieth to beholde, and so signifieth whatsoeuer is seene in man. Nowe in the worldly & carnal men, a man may see many things which are ney∣ther faire, good, nor pleasant, though they be laughed at: wherevpō it foloweth, that they haue no merie hearts. And also their laughing lyeth not but only in dissolutions, intisements, filthines & vnclean∣nes: and in these things consisteth the ioy of the world. But the true ioy standeth in the holy Ghost: as Iesus Christ doth wel shew, whē Iohn. 14. 16. he calleth him the Comforter. And not without cause: for there is none that truly can touch our harts but he, & we cānot but by him reioyce in God: as the scripture doth teach vs, & admonisheth vs so to do. Secondly it foloweth, of this sentence, that if for the loue that Psa. 5. 12. &. 32. 11. & 33. &. 31. 13 Phil. 3. 1. & 4. 4. 1. Thes. 1. 16 1. Pet. 4. 13. we beare to our neighbors, wee desire to shew thē a chearful coun∣tenance, we must haue a chearful heart, not with worldly and carnal ioy, but spiritual & diuine, as belongeth vnto the children of God. The which we shal enioy, if whatsoeuer happen vnto us, we be cō∣tented & take it in good part as cōming from the hand of God, be∣ing assured that he loueth vs, & that hee sendeth vs nothing but is expedient for vs: & that knowing it, we yeeld him thanks therfore, and sing him praises, and run vnto him in al our necessities. Such ioy shal garnishe our faces, and make vs acceptable vnto God, and our neighbors, which know and loue the trueth, wil thinke vs faire and pleasant. Those men & women therfore which would haue shining Ps. 119. 162. faces, let them not seeke to paint, nor to deck thēselues after the fa∣shion and trade of the worlde, but let them labour to reioyce theyr heartes in the Lorde. The which they shal doe, if they set all theyr delight in his word: so that they may say, with Dauid, I reioyce at thy word, as one that findeth great spoiles. This is the ioy & beau∣tie whereof Solomon speaketh, when he saieth, A ioyful heart.
For let vs not thinke that hee woulde teache either men or women Psa. 119. 162. howe they should trimme vp their faces: there is none but is natu∣rally too cunning a workman therein. Let vs folowe this ioye, and shunne the worldly, the which bringeth nothing but sorow & tro∣ble: as they that desire it themselues, doe feele it and confesse it: for they say, For one pleasure, a thousande displeasures or sorows. Now if we be greeued, we can not haue a merie and ioyful face: as Solo∣mon A prouerb of worldly men. doeth signifie, saying, But by the sorrowe of the hearte the minde is heauie. For sith that by the heart and minde, the bodie is guided and ruled, and that there is no outwarde disposition in the bodie, but commeth from within, it foloweth verie wel, that man can not shewe a louing face, when he is inwardly troubled and grie∣ued, vnlesse he counterfaite and disguise himselfe. But yet finally, it can not be but that he must needs shew what he hath in his hart, and that his fainednesse wil not declare: for the hypocrite and dis∣sembling man is so inconstant, that he cannot alwayes hold one state and one purpose. But albeit that Solomon against a good and holie Rom. 12. 15. 2. Cor. 6. 10. &. 7. 10. Esay. 22. 12. ioye, doeth set sorowe and heauinesse, yet it is not to say, that al so∣rowe is euil, nor that it maketh man to haue an euil countenance, nor that wee must flye al sorow. Saint Paule doeth teach vs so. 14 The hart of him that hath vnderstanding, seeketh know∣ledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with foolish∣nesse. Wee doe not gladly suffer ourselues to be called fooles, neither do we desire to be counted such, but we are glad whē we are coun∣ted wise, learned, and discreete: and this is also a great delight vnto vs when wee can knowe that our wisedome answereth vnto the e∣stimation, and that we are truely such as wee desire to be esteemed, and that wee can giue token and proofe thereof to our neighbours. Now for to come by such knowledge, and to giue such a significati∣on, we must not folowe the worldly and carnal people, the supersti∣tious and idolaters, the ambitious and proude: whereof some doe thinke themselues to bee verie wise and discreete, when they haue wit, and cunning to guide wel their particular affaires, and to make their temporal gaine, though it be to the hurt & detriment of their
neighbours. Some wil attribute wisedome and discretion to them¦selues, when they shal folow their owne fantasies and good intents, and that they shal labour to shewe themselues verie zealous of the honour of God, though they doe cleane contrarie vnto his worde. Other some will thinke themselues wel learned, when they can so worke that the world may wonder at them, and honour them, and can finde the meanes to haue credite, and to bee in authoritie and to beare rule. But wee shall then haue certaine know∣ledge to be wise, and shal giue true signes therof, when we shal haue al our affection set to driue al ignoraunce from vs, and to giue our¦selues vnto the pure worde of God, that we may learne perfectly to gouerne ourselues thereafter. Solomon doeth thus pronounce it, when he saith, The heart of him that hath vnderstanding, &c. For this only word is our wisdome & our knowledge. Without it there is nothing but foolishnes, ignorance, darknes & blindnesse: albeit that in sight & outward maner of doings, there seemeth to be great wisdome without this word. But as alreadie hath bin handeled not long agone, there is neither wisdom, nor knowledge, but that which the Lord giueth from his mouth, the which he giueth and imparteth by the wise, which are his instruments. It is the word of God which is the true foode of our soules, seeing that by it, & in it, Iesus Christ Ioh. 6. 35. doeth giue himself vnto vs with al his goodnes, euen hee which is the bread of life. And although that man is not wise, except his hart be armed with this knowledge, & that it seemeth we haue no need to seeke for that which wee alreadie possesse: neuertheles because we neuer haue such perfect knowledge as were necessarie, and that 1. Cor. 13. 9. Ephe. 4. 12. 13. wee haue neede of increase, therefore the heart of the wise seeketh knowledge, vntil that he come vnto the measure of the full age of Christ: whose disciples & schollers we must be, and to learne of him so long as we liue. If in this wise wee seeke knowledge, wee shall finde it. Let vs not then be like vnto those which are full of ser∣mons before they haue throughly tasted them. For if they had wel Pro. 2. 3. tasted thē, they would desire them more: seeing that it is so delicate and daintie meate, and doeth neuer grieue nor wearie the children of God, but doe so long as they liue earnestly desire it: though they haue the same abundantly, but doe neuer cease to adde knowledge vpon knowledge: and as they abound in knowledge, and that they haue their hearts wel fenced, euen so do they gladly talke therof, for
to make their neighbours partakers of the same. For they which are truely wise and learned, haue no straight and close hearts, for to re∣teine knowledge with themselues, but large and open for to spread and distribute the same with their mouthes. Solomon doeth signifie this same after a sort, when against the heart of the wise, hee setteth the mouth of fooles: and against seeking of knowledge, hee setteth to be satisfied or fed with foolishnes. It is as much as if he did say, Euen as the wise with al the desire of his heart doeth giue himselfe vnto knowledge, doeth delight and feedeth himselfe with the same in communicating and opening of it: euen so the fooles giue their heartes vnto foolishnesse: as it is manifest, when they haue theyr mouthes filled therwith, that they neuer cease for to babble out the same. Nowe wee are al of such nature, and can be no better of ourselues. Wherfore we haue need to pray vnto God, that it may please him to change euerie one of vs according to the state wherin we are placed, and that he would giue vs an heart to seke knowledge, that our mouthes or our faces be not fed with follie: that is to say, that we take al our pleasure and pastime in things contrarie vnto know∣ledge. For after the common maner of speaking, To feede himselfe with any thing, is to be giuen thereunto, and to haue therin his de∣light, and to spende therein his time. And it is not without cause, that some doe so speake: for there is nothing in this worlde that some had rather do, then to eate and to drinke: as experience tea∣ceth when they will forsake al kinde of work for to goe to it. Wher∣in the children of God ought to learne to be shamefast if they bee not desirous to be fed with knowledge. 15 All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good con∣science is a continuall feast. Prosperitie is a state that al desire: and contrarily, there is none but wil auoide himselfe from miserie, so much as hee possibly can: but it is not giuen vnto al to enioy their desires, and some forsake that which they desire: and some yl handeled & persecuted of their neighbours, either in their good name, or in their bodies, or in their friendes. If they bee infidels and vnpatient, not knowing that God (who is iust & merciful) doth send them these torments & paines, they feele not this euil only without, but also they tormēt thēselues
within: and so they haue no prosperitie, neither in their owne o∣pinion, nor iudgement of the world. And in this sort is fulfilled in them that which Solomon pronounceth, that All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: that is to say, haue no good time, but lyueth, or rather pineth away with miserie and calamitie. But if they which are persecuted and tormented, or to whome there hap∣peneth any euill without the helpe of men, are faythfull men, and knowing that it is God which sendeth the affliction, from whom so euer it commeth, doe beare it patiently, and aske of the Lorde, that it may please him to maynteine, strengthen, and comfort them: al∣beit that such men (in the estimation of the worlde, and after the sense of the flesh) haue nothing but euill dayes. For what strength, constancie and boldnes soeuer the faythfull haue in their miserie and calamitie, yet they are not insensible: otherwise they shoulde haue no neede of patience, seeing they could suffer none: Euen so is pati∣ence begotten of tribulation: and the scripture exhorteth none vn∣to Tribulation is the mother of patience. patiēce, but such as suffer. Albeit (I say) that after the outward ap¦pearance and feeling of the fleshe their dayes are euill, and haue no prosperitie, yet are they happy before God, both in their consciences and minds they haue more quietnes and rest, then haue they which count themselues most happie of the worlde, and so their dayes are not euill, though they be afflicted and suffer much. Notwithstanding wee doe not falsifie Solomon, for he speaketh chiefely of the affli∣cted, which neither can nor will beare affliction patiently, and spea∣keth after the iudgement of the world which sometimes faileth, and after the sense of the flesh which the faythfull resist, and by the help and grace of God doe ouercome it. And forasmuch as they be of good courage, they cease not euen in the middest of afflicton, how hard and sharpe soeuer they be, to be merry, as if they remained stil at a feast and banquet alwayes to make good cheere. Solomon doth signifie it, saying, But a good conscience is a continuall feast. God Ioh. 15. 18. 19. 20. & 16 33. Mat. 5. 10. 11. Iam. 1. 12. doeth exhort vs in diuers places, to be of good courage, and doeth also set foorth himselfe as an example, and doeth pronounce vs bles∣sed, if we endure patiently. The Apostles likewise thought them∣blessed, and went ioyfully before the Consistorie, because they were counted woorthie of this honour, too suffer reproche for the name of Iesus Christe. Their dayes then were not
al euil, but only in the iudgement of the world, which thought them to be cursed, and in the feeling of the flesh, which is alwayes weake and euil. Therfore if we wil auoide & shun euil dayes, and to be me∣rie, 1. Pet. 4. 12. and to be in a continual feast, let vs not vex ourselues, what ad∣uersitie soeuer happen vnto vs: but let vs take a good stomake, re∣ioysing Gene. 47. 9. Ephe. 5. 16. 2. Tim. 3. 1. in the Lord: as we are admonished, Dearely beloued bre∣thren, thinke it not straunge, concerning the fierie trial, which is a∣mong you to prooue you, as though some strange thing were come vnto you. Let vs note further, that al dayes are the good creatures of God, and there is none euil in them, but they are called good or euil, according to that which happeneth in them, & after that which is either done or suffred in them. Iacob calleth the dayes of his life euil, because he had suffered much euil. And they are called euil be∣cause of the slanders and corruptions, which are done in them. And the times are called dangerous. The euil then is not in the dayes, but in the persons which are in them. And so, it is by accident that they are euil, and not by nature. As touching the rest, as carnall men doe thinke themselues to haue a merie time, when they see the table alwayes couered and beset with good meat, and that they haue a good stomake to eate and drinke, and haue their desire: euen so when we haue a good heart, what thing soeuer happen vs, we haue the continual feast of Gods grace, whereby we are mainteined, and Esay. 55. 1. Math. 22. 2. doe neuer want, and also shal neuer want. This grace is wel compa∣red vnto a feast, when we are al called to drinke and to eate. 16 Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treasure, and trouble therewith. Wee desire al that good should happen vnto vs, and do la∣bour to bring our good into better: but for to haue either good, or to attaine vnto betternes, al doe not knowe the right way therevn∣to. Forasmuche as sometimes alreadie it hath bene alledged, it see∣meth vnto many, for to get riches, and to liue at pleasure, we neede but to turne our backes vnto God, not to reuerence his word, nor to set by our neighbours, nor to care whither any doe them wrong or no, prouided that wee gaine something, and gather riches toge∣ther, that we may haue enough to make good cheare withal, and
to bee at our ease and to reioyce. But albeeit it happeneth that such men haue ynough, and that they seeme to liue pros∣perously and without hardnesse: and also that they labour to put away from them al heauinesse, striuing to make themselues beleeue that they are without danger, and that no hurt can happen vnto them, yet haue they neuer stedfast assurance, but doe tremble and are troubled: for their conscience doeth reprooue them, although they bee without true repentance and healthful so∣rowe. They feare theeues also, chances and yll fortunes: as through infidelitie and ignorance they attribute whatsoeuer doeth happen vnto them, vnto fortune, when they come vnlooked for. It seemeth vnto the worlde that such men doe holde the waye to get riches, and to attaine the better: and contrarily, that they are vnhappie and faintharted, which fearing to offende GOD, doe not giue themselues to gather by the hurte of their neigh∣bours, but are contented with that litle which they possesse iustly. Beholde the iudgement of the world and of the flesh: but the holy Ghost iudgeth cleane otherwise, saying, Better is a little with the feare of the Lorde, then great trea∣sure, &c. Now as it is the iudgement of the holy Ghost, euen so must hee make vs to vnderstande it, and to consent thereunto. For naturally it doeth grieue vs to haue but a litle, and wee make but smal account of the feare of the Lorde, because wee see him not, and knowe not what his feare is. I say that wee are naturally thus Pro. 2. 1. disposed: but if by the reading of the scriptures and resorting vn∣to sermons wee bee diligent to learne wisedome, wee shal vnder∣stande the feare of the Lorde. And once hauing this feare, which is a reuerence that leadeth vs to giue a willing obedience vnto the woorde of our God, and to assure vs of his goodnesse towards vs, the which wee shal possesse howe litle soeuer it bee, and shalbee more profitable vnto vs, then are the great riches vnto the wicked. Psal. 37. 16. Pro. 10. 2. 3. & 13. 25. A smal thing that the righteous hath, is better then greate riches of the vngodly. Nowe that in the feare of the Lorde there is assu∣rance, Solomon doeth plainly pronounce it. And he doth here som∣what signifie it, when against the feare of the Lorde, hee setteth Pro. 14. 26. 27. trouble: for where trouble and vexation is, and where there is no
rest, there can bee no safetie, rest, nor peace. Wherevpon it doeth rightly folowe, that they which haue the feare of the Lorde are hap∣pie, though they haue but a little: & the wicked are cursed, though they winne al the worlde. And as they which feare God are happie and blessed, not only presently, but also in the worlde to come (for they are the housholde folkes and children of God: whereupon it foloweth that they shal inherite the kingdome euerlasting:) the wicked likewise who are not without feare, not of God, but of pre∣sent aduersitie, and of tormentes in time to come (as is signified by the trouble) are cursed euen nowe, though they possesse greate riches, sith that it is with trouble. And shalbee cursed also in tyme to come. For what profiteth it a man to gaine al the worlde, and to loose his owne soule? And also sith that trouble is set against the Mat. 16. 26. feare of the Lorde, it foloweth that where it is, there they are in danger of their soules, seeing that the promises of God doe belong only vnto them that feare him, and not to them which are troubled and grieued for that which happeneth in this worlde, without loo∣king to amende. And forasmuch as the promises of God, which are vnfallible, belong vnto them which feare him, it foloweth againe that there is safetie in the feare of the Lorde: and contrarily, that they cannot be but in dout & distrust where it is not. For to make our profite then of this sentence, let the feare of the Lorde bee our Luke. 12. 15. & 16. 9. Heb. 13. 5. treasure, contenting ourselues with a little, auoyding couetousnes: after the admonitions of our Lorde, and of the Apostle. 17 Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then astalled oxe, and hatred therewith. Eueryman commonly desireth to make good cheere, and to liue merily: and to doe the same, it seemeth to them which are gi∣uen to their mouthes and subiect to their bellies, that they neede no more but to haue the table throughly furnished with a num∣ber of dishes, and good wyne, and to eate and to drinke til they burst, without caring howe they with whome they eate and drinke are affectionate towardes them, nor what loue they beare to them which lay the table, or for whom they spread the table. It is ynough
for them to satisfie their bellie, and to deuour and swil at their plea∣sure, so beastly are they. But Solomon doeth shewe vs that the greate cheere consisteth not in the abundance of dainty meates, nor of strong and sweete wines, and that answereth and pleaseth the pallate of the mouth: for hee saith, Better is a dinner of greene herbes, &c. By the dinner of herbes, hee meaneth a meale that is easily and soone made readie, & which standeth not of many dishes, nor of greate cost: but that is simple, light, and shewing sobrietie and temperancie. Solomon maketh a great account of such a meale, if they which eate it are friends to∣gether. Friendship then is the sauce which maketh the meate good: and not only this, but also it is the rule after the which al our works ought to be wrought, otherwise they are nothing worth. Solomon Loue ought to be the sauce to meate. 1. Cor. 13. 1. (I say) doth highly praise such a dinner or meale, that he doeth pre∣ferre it before great, sumptuouse and delicate bankettes, which are holden amongst men which loue not togither, but doe hate one an other. These great bankets are signified by the fat oxe. Nowe albeit hee speaketh this, preferring a smal thing with loue vnto very great things which are vsed with hatred: let vs not thinke that he would make vs Charterhouse monkes, and to forbid vs the vse of meates, the which are al good: but he sheweth vs the excellencie and power of friendship, which maketh that which is smally accounted of, and which seemeth to be vile and contemptible in respect of other nou∣rishments, to be highly esteemed. Contrarily, hee sheweth vs what filthinesse and wickednes there is in hatred, when for that the good meates & sanctified vnto our vse, are lesse praised then they that are almost of no price, if we make comparison betwene them, and that wee looke vnto the common estimation and sale that is made of them: and likewise of what nourishment and substance the one is in respect of the other. And also (as the Phisitions doe say) herbes doe not nourishe a man. Wee are therefore exhorted to abhorre and fly hatred: and are admonished to keepe vs from them which hate vs: for before that we be wel reconciled, their company and con∣uersation Gene. 4. 8. & 37. 24. 2. Sam. 13. 29 Mat. 5. 44. Rom. 12. 17. is very dangerous. Righteous Abel hath wel felt it. So did Ioseph who was hated of his brethren. Likewise, Amnon. We are also exhorted greatly to esteeme friendship, and to seeke it with al men: as our Lorde teacheth vs so to doe, and Saint Paule.
And are admonished to liue soberly with those which loue vs, so that our friendship ought not to cause vs to exceede in cost, as doe the worldly and carnal men: nor yet so to passe measure that wee shoulde take leaue and licence to giue ourselues vnto al intempe∣rancie & superfluitie. Let vs vnderstand therfore that we are taught to folowe sobrietie and temperancie, and to abstaine from making or vsing of greate and superfluous bankets, for to mainteine the which, some dispende outragiously, in forgetting of the poore, and despising them: as we haue an example thereof in S. Luke: and we see it dayly through the worlde, that they which either make or Luke. 16. 19. haunt great bankets, make smal account of the poore. 18 An angrie man stirreth vp strife: but he that is slowe to wrath, appeaseth striefe. Experience maketh this sentence so plaine, that it needeth none exposition, but wee haue great neede to meditate it wel and to take heede that wee bee not sodenly ouercome with anger, nor bee pro∣uoked to bee easily angred and moued to wrath. Otherwise, wee shoulde shewe ourselues to bee out of our wittes: for we seeke for that which we should feare, if we haue neuer so litle sparke of light and natural knowledge: for being so kindled with anger and wrath, we stirre vp debate so much as in vs lyeth: for our furie doeth stirre vs vp to striue & contende with our neighbours for nothing, or for a trifle: or else we prouoke our neighbours which cannot beare our Gen. 4. 8. & 37. 23. 2. Sam. 25. choler to striue against vs. Caine was the captaine of such as are fu∣rious, as we may see it. And also the brethrē of Ioseph haue folowed him. Saule against Dauid, Iudas and the Iewes against our Lord Ie∣sus Christ. Nabal moued Dauid vnto anger. Beholde howe the fu∣rious doe stirre vp strife and do shewe themselues to be out of their wits, and to doe contrary vnto that which it desireth naturally. We woulde not bee esteemed such: wherefore wee must abstaine from wrath, anger, and furie: and chiefly to keepe vs from dooing of e∣uil. Leaue of from wrath and let goe displeasure: freate not thy Psal. 37. 8. selfe, else shalt thou bee moued to doe euil. I say expresly to doe euil and to hurte our neighbours: for it is very needeful to bee angry and to shewe our displeasure, for to labour to terrifie
the consciences of transgressors and wicked people, for to bring them vnto repentance, or to make them more vnexcusable. Moyses and the Prophetes did so handle the Iewes. So did our Lorde Iesus Christ deale with the Scribes and Pharisees. And his Apostles and disciples haue folowed him. If we folowe them as wee ought, and as is necessary, and vpon our anger there ariseth some strife, wee must not therefore be astonished nor discouraged, as though some strange or newe thing did happen vnto vs: for it happened so vnto Moyses and to the other aboue named. Likewise strife shoulde not bee imputed vnto vs, but vnto the rage and furie, to the malice and wickednesse, vnto the pride and arrogancie, to the obstinacie and hardehartednesse of those which offende, and runne into al disso∣lutenesse and insolencie. Neuerthelesse the malicious and peruerse Rom. 15. 5. 6. 1. Cor. 1. 10. & 12. 13. Ephe. 4. 4. 1. Pet. 3. 8. Mat. 11. 29. Iohn. 13. 19, 1. Cor. 4. 16. & 10. 31. Ephe. 5. 1. Phil. 3. 17. Heb. 13. 17. wil say, that if any strine against vs, that it is because wee doe them wrong, when we boldly say vnto them the truth, with such seueri∣tie and sharpenesse as they deserue. The like hath hapned vnto our Lorde and Maister Iesus Christ: and therefore let vs not cease care∣fully to do our office, what thing soeuer they lay to our charge. Let it suffice vs that the holy Ghost doeth giue a certaine and true wit∣nesse in our hartes, that we desire not to bee angry, but so much as possibly we can, and as our office requireth it, to be slowe to anger, and to quiet strife: for it lyeth not in vs to haue peace with all men, when we beare the worde of peace and the message of reconcilia∣tion, and that our sermons tende to leade vs to be of one minde and consent. Nowe as this is the office and the duetie of Pastours of the Church, euen so they which are taught by them, ought of them to take example, and to folowe them: and not they them, but Ie∣sus Christ who speaketh and woorketh in them by his holy spi∣rite. 19 The way of a slouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine. When we haue any vocation in hand, and that we earnestly set ourselues to do what our duetie requireth, we are glad if wee finde therein no hardenesse, and when we find nothing to hinder vs from going forward as God hath ordeined and commanded by his word:
yea if we haue any feare or reuerence theretoo. Whatsoeuer God teacheth vs by his woorde, is our estate, our duetie and vocation which the scripture calleth, way, If therein wee woulde finde no let nor hardnesse which may stoppe vs from running our course, let vs not be negligēt, sluggish nor slouthful. For they that are such, are voyde of good courage and willing minde: and therefore doe finde nothing of that which God ordeineth and commandeth ea∣sie to bee done, but are so full (as it is saide) of let mee rest, that they forbeare and cease from al good woorke, least they should be pricked, and get a thorne in their finger. Solomon doth signifie it, saying, The way of a slouthfull man is as an hedge, When as a way fa∣ring man meeteth with a very thicke hedge of thornes which doth Pro. 6. 6. stop him to go any further, and to make hast in his way he is trou∣bled and grieued: euen so the slouthful man which is giuen to take his ease, and to liue in ydlenes, without caring, but for to sleepe and to rest, doeth finde that God which ordeineth to do after the estate and vocation wheretoo he is called, troublesome and grieuous. So∣lomon calleth the same the way of the slouthful: not because hee walketh therein, but for that in folowing the ordinance of God, he should walke therin. He compareth it vnto an hedge of thornes, not for to gainsay that which is written in the lawe of the Lord, nor al∣so against that which our Lord saith: but he speaketh after the opi∣nion of the slouthful: who is here called slouthful, not for that that Psa. 19. 8. & 119. 14. Mat. 11. 29. he abstaineth from al kind of worke, but because he delighteth not to walke in righteousnesse, according to the worde of the Lord: but doeth turne his backe against him, and stryueth to doe the con∣trary. Solomon doeth giue it vs so to vnderstande, when against the slouthful man, he setteth the righteous, saying, But the path of the righteous, &c. It is then yll spoken, to attribute goodnesse to him which careth not to do wel: & therfore, let vs not consent vnto thē which shal say of a man, hee is a very good man, but he is negligent & slouthful: hee careth not greatly for any woorke: for it foloweth wel that if a man be righteous, he is also readie to do wel: and con∣trarily, if he be slouthful, that he maketh no count of goodnes nor of righteousnes: & consequently that it is euil spoken, to say that the slouthful is an honest man: but if hee be called a wicked man, it
is the trueth, as Solomon doth teache it, when against the slouthful man, he setteth the righteous. Speaking thus, hee sheweth that the slouthful, is a wicked man, and that he is voide of al righteousnesse: and there with that there is neither care nor diligence whereof wee must make account, except so farre as wee proceede in righteous∣nesse and that wee bee not grieued to doe wel, but that we delight therein, and that we reioyce in it as in a thing that wee finde very easie to be done. Solomō doth signifie this same by the plaine pathe. For as the passenger which findeth his way cleane frō al hinderāces doth delight in his way: euen so is righteousnesse the cause that man taketh pleasure to doe diligently his duetie, and to do carefully his office. Let the theeues, couetous, vsurers, deceiuers, and cor∣rupters of Marchandizes euen kil themselues so long as they will with labouring, let them be dayly at woorke, and let them not cease neither day nor night, yet do they not deserue therefore to bee cal∣led diligent: for sith they are without righteousnesse, there is no∣thing in them but slouthfulnesse. And also when they shalbee well considered of, wee shal neuer finde them contented, but com∣playning that they cannot attaine their purpose: and so their way is as an hedge of thornes. Furthermore, if such men might obteine their desires without any trauaile, they had rather a great deale to do nothing at all, then to worke. For also it is not with any good desire they haue to spend the time well, that they labour, but onely they tende to keepe them¦selues from begging. Moreouer, forasmuch as that man which cea∣seth to doe his dutie, for to busie himselfe about nothing, or wic∣kednes, doeth well deserue to be called and esteemed slouthfull: ther¦fore it followeth that theeues and all they which follow not righ∣teousnes, are woorthy to be counted slouthful: and contrarily, that all righteous men are diligent. For by righteousnes they are led to watch and to labour, and not onely to walke, but also to runne by their path, with great desire and earnest affection they haue to doe their duetie. Wherein we may see that the number of the slouth∣full is great, and that the number of the righteous is verie smal. 20 A wise sonne reioyceth the father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.
After the wonted custome of the worlde, the fathers and mo∣thers are very glad, and ioyful when their children are aduanced to honour dignitie, credit, preheminence and authoritie, and that they be politike and subtil to gather riches and temporal goods for them∣selues, and set al their care and diligence to bee riche. The Kinges, Princes and rulers of the earth do reioyce, when they haue a great multitude of subiectes giuen to flatter them, and put themselues in danger for to mainteine their quarels, and to serue their desires, though they be against God. They which despise God for to shewe themselues to be altogether at the commandement of their Prince, are most commonly counted for the best subiectes, and are most ac∣ceptable and best welcome. For the kings and rulers of the earth doe set more store by themselues then they doe by God, and woulde haue God forgotten, that they might bee obeyed without contra∣diction. The Maisters and Dames delight greatly to see their ser∣uantes and maydes to be so busie and diligent to do their worke & to profit the house, that they forget to serue God, and care not though they do wrong vnto their neighbours, so that they please them whome they serue. We see then that al goeth to naught in the worlde, when we reioyce at the trades and kindes of doing which leade soules vnto damnation, in steade that we ought to weepe for it, and rebuke and threaten those which occupie themselues in any affaires without the feare of God, and without loue to their neigh∣bours. They which so reioyce, shal at last weepe. And therfore, least we be of their number, let vs doe nothing without the feare of the Lord, nor without charitie, nor let vs not delight in such workes: & albeit that we are in the worlde, yet let vs not be of the world: but let euery one of vs, according to the degree wherein wee are placed of God, reioyce to see his inferiours to rule and guide themselues wisely in their businesse. Solomon doeth shew vs that we should so do, when he saith, A wise sonne reioyceth, &c. Al superiours & al such as haue any authoritie are heere closely admonished to bee wise, otherwise they coulde not reioyce at the wisedome of those which are vnder their charge and gouernement, but rather woulde be delighted with their follie: for fooles do exalt foolishnes, & loue their like. They are also admonished to teache wisedome aswell by wordes as by workes, euery man after the degree wherein he is pla∣ced:
for the lesser must learne of the greater for to become wise, for to reioyce afterwardes by their wisedome their superiours and go∣uernours. This same (as hath beene saide) is here closely taught vs: but it is openly shewed vnto children, and consequently vnto al in∣feriours, that they must needs be wise, and that they shoulde so wel gouerne themselues by wisedom, that their fathers and mothers, their superiours and rulers may delight in their conuersation and liuing. For to doe it wel, the worde of the Lord must be their only wisedome, and that thereby they may bee brought to feare, reue∣rence and humilitie, that they may willingly giue such obedience as they ought vnto their fathers and mothers, to their superiours and rulers, and may be wholy at their commandemēt, so that they may reioyce at wisedome, and not at follie. This same is taught vs by the Exod. 20. 12. Deut. 6. 20. Ephe. 6. 1. Rom. 13. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13. holy scriptures. Nowe that the wisedome which is heere spoken of, standeth in this, Solomon doth shew vs, when against a wise sonne, hee setteth a foole with his stubbornesse: saying, But a foolish man despiseth his mother. It is not without cause that Solomon maketh mention of the mother, and that he condemneth that man of fol∣lie which by his rebellion and disobedience, or other wickednesses, grieueth and vexeth his mother, and maketh her sorowful: for it is not only commanded vs to honour our father, but our mother also. But it seemeth to many children that their mothers are but their seruantes and maydes of the house, and that we need to make none account of them. Solomon doeth attribute foolishnesse vnto such men, and that very rightly: for they haue not the wit to consider, that they were made men in the wombe of their mothers, other∣wise they had not bin men. For man is not without the womā: but the man is by the woman, and that not without greate paynes and sorowes. It is very like that Solomon not beeing contented to say, 1. Cor. 11. 8. Gen. 3. 16. The foole despiseth his mother: but calling him a man, woulde put him in remembrance of these former things: and also that it was not without care of the mother, that he is growne since his byrth, and come to mans state: for that that he is man, hee commeth from his mother. Moreouer calling him a man which despiseth his mother, and rebuking him of foolishnesse, he teacheth vs, that our great age doth not exempt vs from the honour that God commandeth vs to beare
to our mothers, otherwise wee shoulde shewe ourselues to bee fooles. 21 Foolishnes is ioy to him that is destitute of vnderstan∣ding: but a man of vnderstanding walketh vp∣rightly. Wee commonly call a man fainte harted, lacking courage, and voyde witte, when hee cannot, nor will not giue himselfe to followe that which belongeth to his vocation, or that he wil not, and cannot tell what kinde of life to choose, for to spende his time about good woorkes, the which God hath prepared that we shoulde walke in them, and that if wee doe rightly imploy ourselues therein, wee re∣ioyce in the Lord. Neuertheles, there is no man which hath his hart so faint, nor his courage so bace, but doeth apply himselfe to some thing, for the minde of man, is neuer vnoccupied, but is filled with thoughtes, purposes, enterprises, willes, desires, affections of sorrow or of ioy: For man must needes passe away his time, the which hee cannot doe without the former thinges, the which are such, as is the disposition of the heart. If the heart be good and right, the thoughts shalbe good and right: contrarily if it be euil, so shal they also be e∣uill. This is iudged naturally, but yet our Lord doth shew it vs by Mat. 12. 33. & 15. 17. 18 the similitude of the tree, and by the things which proceed from the hearte. Solomon also doeth giue it vs to vnderstand, saying, Foolish∣nes is ioy to him that is destitute of vnderstanding. When he spea∣keth thus, he declareth vnto vs, that all his affections, delectations counselles and thoughtes, which may and will not choose, and folow some good and right kinde of liuing, doe tende to make him goe a∣stray, or else to make other to goe astray and to scatter them: as is signified by foolishnes which is his reioycing. For foolishnes heere is not taken only for any light vanitie which is committed for want of heede: but is heere chiefly taken for all wickednes contrarie vnto righteousnes. And so the destitute of vnderstanding is counted a∣mongest the number of them which forsake the right path, for too Pro. 2. 13. walke by the wayes of darkenes. And Solomon doeth heere giue
it vs to vnderstand well, when against foolishnes he setteth, walketh vprightly, saying, But a man of vnderstanding walketh vp∣rightly: that is to say, that that man which giueth his heart and minde vnto the woorde of the Lorde, and reioyceth therein, doeth not wander, neither doeth delight to see or to make other to goe a∣stray, but doeth studie and apply himselfe to take and remoue al stoppes and lets out of the way, which might hinder him from do∣ing rightly his estate, and which might also hinder his neighbours, that is to say, that his affection is right, and is continually occupied Psal. 1. 2. in meditating the lawe of the Lorde, that hee may learne thereby to correct and amend his life, and be an example to other, for to leade them to walke rightly: and if it bee needful, to vse exhortati∣ons, admonitions, corrections, and threatenings. Loe what to walke vprightly meaneth. For wee must not only haue care of our¦selues, but also that wee haue an eye vnto the edification and sal∣uation of our neighbours. Wee cannot doe this of ourselues, as Psal. 51. 12. & 119. 17. 133 Mat. 3. 1. & 5. 13. 14. Dauid did very wel knowe it: and therefore, hee prayeth, Create in mee, O God a newe heart, &c. It pertaineth chiefly vnto the Pastours of the Churche to walke thus vprightly: for Saint Iohn the Baptist was the voyce of a cryer in the wildernesse: euen such also ought the ministers of the woorde to bee: for they are the Heb. 13. 17. salte of the earth: and the light of the worlde: they are watchmen that must giue account for our soules. Nowe euery one of vs must followe them, according to the degree wherein wee are set. Wee haue al heere a very profitable lesson, but chiefly they which haue any authoritie. And wee ought to vnderstande that by how much as wee are in higher authoritie, by so much the more must wee bee the wiser. As touching the rest, the wise and they which shal folowe their vpright walking, haue a promise that they shal not fall into the pit of hel, but shal goe into life: for they cannot walke vprightly but in the straight way which leadeth vnto life. Contrarily, the destitute of vnderstanding are caried by death: for reioycing in foolishnesse, they yeelde and obey vnto him that hath the Lordship of death, that is to say the Deuil, for whome and his Angels, is prepared the fire that neuer shalbee quen∣ched.
22 Without counsel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counsellers there is stedfastnesse. According to the affaires that wee haue in hande, so must wee choose our counsellers, for to come to the ende of our purpose, en∣terprises, or desire: otherwise wee shalbee voide of our intent: e∣uen as wee do dayly prooue it, and as they deserue which wil go∣uerne themselues after their owne fantasie, and despise al counsel: & so doing, do despise God: for of him commeth al counsel. With him is wisedome, and power: and he hath counsel and vnderstanding. Ioh. 12. 12. Esay. 40. 12. 13. Pro. 8. 14. 15 16. Who hath measured the water with his fist? Who hath instructed the spirite of the Lorde? or was his counsellour, or taught him? And heere before. And as in gouerning ourselues after our owne fantasies, wee despise God, and doe shewe ourselues very proude and arrogant: euen so God, knoweth howe to despise and to beate downe them which so vse themselues, in auoyding their purposes and enterprises. Solomon doeth shewe it vs, when hee saith, With∣out counsel thoughts come to naught. This hath beene prooued true from the beginning of the world in Adam and Eue: afterwards in the world by the destruction of the flood: afterwardes in them Gene. 11. 5. which builded the tower of Babylon, and so successiuely in diuers others. As in Pharao, Saule, Roboam, &c. And of our time we see it in the greate states of the world, which thinke to destroy the church of God. According to these experiences, and also as the holy Ghost hath giuen knowledge to the holy fathers, they did pronounce the bringing of thoughtes and enterprises of men to naught. God doth scatter the deuises of the craftie, &c. Againe, He taketh the wise in their craftinesse. The Lorde knoweth the thoughtes of man, that Iob. 5. 12. 13 Psa. 44. 11. Psa. 146. 3. 4 they are vanitie. Put not your trust in princes, nor in the sonne of man, for there is no helpe in him. His breath departeth, and hee re∣turneth to the earth: then his thoughtes perish. It is very necessarie that God shoulde so deale with the wicked and proude, and there∣fore, Dauid douteth not to pray against them, destroy them O God, Psa. 5. 11 &. 140. 8. &c. Let not the wicked haue his desire, O Lorde: performe not his wicked thought, least they be proude. Therefore if we woulde not haue our thoughtes brought to nothing, nor made vaine, but would
come to the ende of that wee thinke and purpose, we must come to aske counsel at God, from whome onely commeth al counsel. But because he dwelleth in the vnaccessible light, and that hee is of an incomprehensile maiestie and highnesse, that wee may be partakers of his counsel, for to make our thoughtes to stande and bee stedfast and to bring foorth their effect, hee abaseth himselfe vnto vs by his worde, the which he communicateth vnto vs by his wise men and discreete, to whome he giueth knowledge, & openeth their mouths for to make them to distribute counsel as we haue neede thereof. Wee must then listen diligently to them which are committed for to teache vs, gouerne and leade vs: and as our affayres doe require, and that wee shoulde seeke counsel of them which are learned and haue experience: for al the counsel that we haue neede of, lyeth not in one mans braine but euery man hath his measure which it plea∣seth God to giue him. Wee haue neede therefore, for to come to the end of our affaires, that God shoulde raise vp for vs many wise men and discreete: Solomon doth wel signifie it, saying, But in the multitude of counsellers there is stedfastnesse. That is to say, That if it please God for to raise vp for vs a multitude of wise, discreete, and men of experience, and that learning of them, wee folow their doctrine, counsel and aduise, wee shal come to the end of our enter∣prises, wee shal not bee voide of our desires, but shal obteine our wishe. For, because wee folowe the counsel that God giueth by his wise and discreete men, and doe not folowe our fantasie, wee must be assured that the Lord wil giue a good issue vnto our thoughts & deliberations. Wee haue had almost the like sentence before. Nowe Pro. 11. 14. in them both, wee are admonished not to bee like vnto Absolom, which came not to his wished ende, but wanting men of good coūsel, dyed miserably: nor to Dauid, when he numbred the people: nor to Solomon, which folowed after many women: nor to Ro∣boam. 2. Sam. 18. 9 10. 2. Sam. 24. 1. 1. King. 11. 1. & 12. 8. Esa. 29. 13. 14. Neither let vs bee like vnto the Papistes, which wil bee saued by seruing of God (or rather the Deuil) by mens doctrine: other∣wise GOD wil depriue vs of men of counsel. Therefore, this peo∣ple draweth neere to mee with their mouthes, but their heartes are farre from mee, the wisedome of the wise shal perish.
23 A ioy commeth to a man by the answere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due season? Solomon doth not here speake generally, when hee saith, A ioy commeth to a man by the answere of his mouth: Otherwise there should be repugnancy in the scriptures: the which ought to be nei∣ther thought nor said. For our Lord Iesus Christ saieth, Truly I say Mat. 12. 36. vnto you that for euery ydle word that men shal haue spoken, they shal giue an account. Wherupon it foloweth wel that man hath not ioy for euery answere of his mouth, except it be some tempo∣ral & transitory ioy, which contineweth not. But let vs not thinke that Solomon busieth himself to put forth a sentence of any light or slender matter, and to ioyne theretoo a promise, but let vs vnder∣stande that he promiseth heere, a stedfast ioy and one of long conti∣nuance. For these sentences are the wordes of God, whereby we are rather withdrawne from vaine ioyes, then inuited & exhorted to set any hope or trust in it. The Deuil, the world & our owne fleshe, do draw but to much to take ioy & pleasure in our words, though they be nothing worth, and that they be hurtful vnto vs, as the end doeth shewe it. Let vs vnderstand therfore that Solomon doth not speake generally of al words which proceed out of our mouths, but only of those which are vttered, as wee are commanded. Solomon doeth expound it so himself, when he asketh now, saying, And how good is a word in due season? The which is as if he saide, If wee wil haue ioy of the answere of our mouth, our word must be good thē, & for to be good, it must be spoken in due time, for a foolishe and wicked woorde hath neuer no due time, seeing it ought ne∣uer to be vttered. Now we cannot wel folow these admonitions, ex∣cept wee obey vnto that which is saide, If any man speake, let him speake as the words of God. Wherupon foloweth that a word spo∣ken Ephe. 4. 29. & 5. 3. Collo. 4. 6. 1. Pet. 4. 11. Ps. 119. 13. 23 46. 54. 97. in due time, being good, is the woorde of God, & that it is the same answere of the mouth, wherein there is ioy comming to the man that hath an vpright hart, & he may say with Dauid: With my lips haue I declared al the iudgementes of thy mouth. Princes also did sit & spake against mee: but thy seruant did meditate in thy sta∣tutes. I wil speake also of thy testimonies before kings, and wil not
be ashamed. Thy statutes haue beene my songues in the house of my pilgrimage. Oh howe I loue thy Lawe! it is my meditation continually. And forasmuch as ther is no season wherein wee ought not to preache the woorde of GOD, therefore it foloweth that it is good at al times, and that they which pronounce it with good heartes, haue ioy thereof. And sith that the Scripture doeth attribute ioy vnto this woorde, it foloweth that it taketh away ioye from the woorde of men. For albeit that men doe laugh in their worldly communications and talke, and delight therein, and fauour it, yet therein is no true ioye: as wee may knowe in ma∣ny men, and as the ende doeth shewe it in all. Contrarily although wee speake the woordes of God as we ought, and are therfore per∣secuted and afflicted, yet neuertheles we cease not to reioyce, yea with an euerlasting ioy: As our Lorde Iesus Christ doeth signifie it saying, no man shal take away your ioy. Albeit that the Apostles, for speaking in the name of Iesus Christ, were beaten, yet were they Iohn. 12. 22. Acts. 5. 41. not without their ioy, And so departed ioyfully, because they were counted woorthy to suffer for the name of Iesus. Some doe vnderstand this sentence, as if he woulde say that a man doeth re∣ioyce and is well pleased, when he obteineth what hee demaundeth Now albeit there is a diuersitie in these two senses, yet there is no contrarietie. 24 The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath. He doeth shewe vs the trade and way that we must holde for to liue when he sayth, The way of life is on high to the prudent. And he doeth shewe howe we shoulde be affectionate, and what knowledge we must haue for to holde and folow this path: when he sayth, that it is to the prudent: & that he addeth, to auoid from hel beneth: if then we wil liue, we must not hang downe our heade, ex∣cept Luke. 18. 13. it be for shame and sorow for our sinnes, as was the poore pu∣blican: but we must be righteous, not after the maner of the Pha∣risee, which bragged of his worokes, which hee thought worthy of great reward & cōmendation: but for to lift vp wel both our eies & our head, let vs despise the world & renounce ourselues, & let vs
liue an heauenly lyfe: as the Scriptures doe admonish vs in diuers places: Amend your lyues. &c. Seeke first for the kingdome of God Mat. 4. 17. & 6. 33. & 16. 24. Luk. 21. 34. 36 Rom. 12. 1. 2 &c. If any man will follow me let him renounce himselfe. &c. Take heede to yourselues, &c. Watch therfore and pray continually, &c. I besech you therfore bretherē, by the mercies of god, that you giue vp your bodies aliuing sacrifice, holy, acceptable vnto God, which is your reasonable seruing of God. And fashion not yourselues like vnto this worlde, &c. And that considering the season, that it is & 13. 11. 12 now time that we should arise from sleep. &c. The night is past, the day is at hand, let vs therefore cast away the woorkes of darkenes. and let vs put on the armour of light. If then yee bee risen with Christ, seeke those thinges that are aboue, where Christ sitteth at Collo. 3. 1. the right hande of God. If we shoote not at this marke, we cannot brag to be Christians: for our conuersation is not such as it ought to be, as S. Paule speaking in the name of al the faythful, doeth shew vs, saying: Our conuersation is in heauen, &c. This conuersation is described vnto vs in Esay and in Micheas the fourth Chapter. Phil. 3. 20. Esay. 2. 1. Miche. 4. 1. Thus much for the path of life which is aboue. As touching nowe the affection and knowledge that is required for to holde this path, let vs marke howe we are admonished. Be you not like an horse, or like a mule which vnderstand not: But we must suffer ourselues Psalm. 32. 9. to be handled and guyded by him which sayth vnto vs. I will in∣struct thee, and teach thee in the way, that thou shalt goe, and I will guyde thee with mine eye. Suffering ourselues thus to be guided by the woord, which is our prudence and vnderstanding we shalbe wise, and as we desire we shal liue, folowing the way of life, and shal auoyde from hel beneath, where there is nothing but eternall death, nor can be none other. For sith that the Gospel doeth attribute lyfe vnto high, which is contrary vnto beneath: it foloweth wel that he which hath not wisedome to goe vp, and to auoyde from beneath, goeth to destruction. We must then mount vp to God, for to learne wisdome of him: and for to doe this, let vs heare him speake by the mouth of his ministers: sith he will thus teache vs. Hee can well ynough teach vs without meanes, but so long as it pleaseth him to vse these his organes, let vs not despise them.
25 The Lord wil destroy the house of the proude men: but he wil stablish the borders of the widow. The wicked proud, presume so much of their credit and pow∣er, and of their prosperitie, that they make themselues beleeue that no euil shal happen either to them or to their house, and that they shal want nothing, and as they falsly beleeue the same, euen so, be∣fore the eyes and in outwarde appearance, they flourishe in this worlde for a time, which doeth not seeme of smal continuance to the feeling of the fleshe: so that the poore faythful, which are af∣flicted, are grieued therewith, and tempted to folowe those wicked men, for to haue their ease, and to be in prosperitie, as they see the wicked are. All this same hath beene shewed alreadie by the holie Scriptures. Nowe albeit that in the former sentences, Solomon hath Pro. 2. 2. 22. & 3. 31. & 12. 7. & 14. 11. sufficiently pronounced destruction and damnation to the wicked, and stedfastnesse vnto the righteous, yet hee is not satisfied there∣with: and therefore, to assure and to comfort chiefly the faithful, hee sheweth nowe that which wee haue heard before, when hee sayeth, The Lorde wil destroy the house of the proude men. Here∣tofore hee hath pronounced the destruction of the wicked, not naming who hath done it: but nowe hee declareth expresly, that it is the Lorde. Nowe the word which hee vseth, the which we ex∣pounde Lorde, signifieth him that hath his being of himselfe, and by whome al things are, and without whom nothing is. And for∣asmuch as it is suche a Lorde, as doeth take in hande to destroy and beate downe the house of the proude, it foloweth, it can not stand. It is necessarie therefore that they and their houshold which doeth folow them, and al their goods, must go vnto destruction: for there is no power that can withstand suche a Lorde, albeit that the wic∣ked be so proude, that they striue to withstande him. And also, hee is an enemie vnto the proude, as he hath alwayes shewed, euen from the beginning of the worlde. We doe thus expounde the destruction of the House, and not onely of the buildings and ma∣terial houses: for albeit that the pride of the wicked is shewed in sumptuousnes and costlines of buildings, in the which they are plea∣sed, and take their delight: yet neuerthelesse in this place we ought
to take the house, for al that seemeth to be in the possession of the proude. I say expresly, which seemeth to be: for truely, the proude haue no possession, sith the Lorde God destroyeth their house, and taketh it from them. And as by naming the Lorde to be the destroi∣er, hee sheweth, that the proude cannot withstande him, and that indeede and trueth they haue nothing: he teacheth vs also that no euil shal happen to the wicked, but from the hande of the Lorde, though it seemeth often contrarie, because that God sendeth visible meanes, to the which the destruction is attributed: and if he wor∣keth secretly, then they doe impute it vnto fortune. But howsoe∣uer it be, that destruction commeth to the wicked, wee must vnder∣stande, that it is the Lorde which destroyeth their house, the which they builde with iniuries and wrongs, with rakings and extortions, with blood and with murther: as the Prophets doe rebuke them for it: Heare, I pray you, O heades of Iacob, and yee Princes of the house of Israel: shoulde not ye know iudgement? But they hate the Mich. 3. 1. 2. good, and loue the euil: they plucke of their skinnes from them, and also the fleshe from the bones, &c. Woe vnto him that buil∣deth a towne with blood, and erecteth a Citie by iniquitie. The Lorde shal enter into iudgement with the antientes of his people Aba. 2. 12. Esa. 3. 14. and the Princes thereof: for ye haue eaten vp the Vineyarde: the spoile of the poore is in your houses. As a Cage is ful of birdes, so are their houses ful of deceite: thereby they are become great and Iere. 5. 27. waxen riche. Wee see therefore that the Lorde hath good cause to destroye the house of the proude. Contrarily, hee taketh care to builde and to mainteine the house of the humble, euen with theirs which maketh no count of them, and also are despised in the world, yea, afflicted and outraged. Of suche kinde of people, I say, God ta∣keth pittie: and therefore hee helpeth their miserie and pouertie. Solomon doeth signifie it, saying, But hee wil stablishe the bor∣ders of the Widowe. By the Widowe, hee meaneth al suche as suf∣fer, poore and miserable: whome the worlde careth nothing at all for, but doeth reiect them, and labour to destroy them. But the Lord mainteineth them as he seeth to be expedient for them, and proui∣deth for al their necessities: as is heere signified by to stablishe the borders. The miserable ought heere to comfort themselues, when they see how God doeth offer himselfe vnto them, and becommeth
the Carpenter of their houses, and they which doe them wronge are admonished that they haue to doe with a strong enemy. Foras∣muche as Widowes, fatherlesse children, and strangers are not com∣monly supported by men, therefore no man feareth to doe them wrong, to oppresse, to polle & to doe thē violence: but notwithstan∣ding they take in hand and ioyne with a strong match: for the Lord doeth greatly fauour them, as it is here briefly shewed vs, but more Exod. 22. 1. Esa. 1. 23. Za. 7. 9. 10. largely in other places. Thou shalte not oppresse a stranger. 26 The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleasant wordes. Although that by the corruption of our nature we are al euil, and that wee are as it were yoked to sin, yet the holy scripture doth make distinction betweene the good & the euil: the which is an ar∣gument that God doeth not impute wickednes vnto al men, & that there be some whom he alloweth for good and righteous, and that of his only grace & goodnesse. If then we haue our harts & mindes hardened in euil, making no account to repent, but delighting in fil∣thines & vncleannes, in malice and wickednesses, the scripture cal∣leth vs wicked, as we are so indeed. And whatsoeuer we think, con∣sult of, deliberate, would, desire & take in hand, is in vaine: euen so is that which we either do or say. Solomon doth shew it vs, saying, The thoughts of the wicked are abhomination to the Lord. For sith Psa. 11. 7. the Lord is righteous, & loueth righteousnes, and that he abhorreth the thoughtes of the wicked: therefore it foloweth wel there is no goodnes in thē: for, inasmuch as the hart is filled with abhominable thoughts, therfore it can bring foorth none other but wicked words and workes. This same is taught vs by the similitude of the tree. Let the sayings and doings of the wicked, haue neuer so goodly shewe, Mat. 12. 33. yet are they not acceptable: as wee haue seene, in the 8 verse. The sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde. And sith also that the thoughtes of the wicked are abhominable vnto the Lorde, it foloweth, that the wicked are abused, when they labour to say or to doe any thing so secretly that GOD shoulde not knowe it: for sith that he pearceth vnto the thoughts,
hee must needes haue knowledge of the desire, the which is not so muche hid: seeing that men which are pour blinde, may know and iudge it. And not onely they are deceiued, but which worst is, they doe iniurie vnto God, esteeming him lesse then they doe a woorke∣man towardes his woorke: for they wil confesse plainely, that hee which hath wrought any thing, knoweth what is in it: but that which the wicked thinke of God, when they wil hide themselues from him, it is as muche as if the worke should say to him that hath made it, Thou hast not made me, or, Thou vnderstandest it not. And therefore, it is not without cause why he complaineth of them. Yet wil they say, The Lorde seeth them not. Woe vnto them that seeke Psal. 94. 7. Esai. 29. 15. 16. deepe to hide their counsel from the Lord: for their workes are in darknesse, and they say, Who seeth vs? And who knoweth vs? Let vs take heede from doing such iniurie vnto our God, but rather let vs giue him thanks, saying, O Lord, thou hast tried me and knowne me. &c. Thou knowest my sitting and my rising: thou vnderstandest Psal. 139. 1. 2 my thought a farre of. If we do truely confesse this same, we wil ab∣horre and detest our euil thoughtes, and consequently, we wil great∣ly feare to speake euil and to do euil, knowing that wee are alwayes before our God, who loueth no wickednes. Now for to execute the same wel, wee must change our nature. Solomon doth giue it vs to Psal. 5. 5. vnderstande, when he saieth, But the pure haue pleasant wordes. If wee be cleane from our filthinesse and wickednesse, by the grace and working of the holie Ghost, our thoughtes shal not be abhominable to the Lorde: for our wordes shalbe pleasant and acceptable vnto him. The which could not be, except they proceeded from pure and cleane thoughtes: for the inwarde parte must first of al be pure and Mat. 23. 25. cleane, and then that which is without, shalbe pure and cleane. And as in this sort wee shalbe acceptable vnto the Maister and Lorde of life and saluation, euen so shal we be assured not to perishe, but to inioye the presence of our God. Finally, let vs note, That whosoe∣uer Mat. 5. 8. hath not pleasaunt wordes before God, hath filthie thoughts. 27 He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne house: but he that hate th giftes shal liue.
He that is prodigiall, spending excessiuely, or that maketh no account to gain his bread, by giuing himself vnto some good works, which may helpe to nourishe him and his familie, they say that hee holdeth a fit and right way and trade to bring al to naught and to be banker out, and that hee falleth in decaye, and that hee is neare vnto destruction. Wee can not deny this same, seeing there are so many proofes of experiences. But if a man be straight and holdeth fast, and spareth, and keepeth his goods carefully, labouring alwaies to adde to them and increase the stocke, hee wil thinke himselfe to be a good and diligent housholder, and it wil seeme vnto him, that he holdeth a meetely good trade, to become riche. His worldly and carnal neighbours, wil be also of the same opinion, & wil thinke, that there can be no better meanes to gaine his liuing, then to bee actiue, and to be readie to drawe vnto himselfe. This is the com∣mon opinion, but yet it ceaseth not to be false and wrong. Solomon doeth shewe it, when hee sayeth, Hee that is greedie of gaine, &c. Hee reprooueth here al co∣uetous, which neuer haue enough, and the more they haue, the more they desire to haue, and stil labour to gather, & care not whe∣ther they doe wrong or hurt vnto their neighbours, but giue them∣selues to peele them, & chiefly whē they think that their neighbors are simple, & that they haue not the power to be reuenged & to de∣fend themselues. They which thus couet gaine, do labour to make a sure and continual recompence, and to fil their houses with such a∣bundance, as neuer they nor their posteritie may haue want: but let them florish, prosper, & be at their ease for euer. Solomon, I say, re∣prehendeth al such couetous men, when he saieth, that they trouble their owne houses. Now that they trouble their houses, Saint Paule doeth shewe it, They that wil be riche, doe fal into temptation and 1. Tim. 6. 9. snares, and into many foolish & noisome lustes, which drowne men in perdition and destruction. But he reprooueth those chiefly which are in authoritie, which haue power and are aloft aboue other, and which haue the charge and office, & haue the ruling of their neigh∣bours: and in rebuking them, he also threateneth them with death and destruction. We ought thus to vnderstand it, forasmuch as the lawe expresly doeth forbid them couetousnes, and that God by his Prophetes is angrie with them, doeth reproche them for their
couetousnes, and doeth threaten them aboue al other, Thou shalt Exo. 23. 8. Deut. 16. 18 19. & 17. 17 take no rewarde, &c. Thou shalt ordeine thee Iudges, that they may iudge the people with right iudgement. Neither shalt thou take any rewarde, &c. And it is saide of the King also, that hee shall not heape vp golde and siluer vnto himselfe. As touching the rebukes and threatenings, wee haue alledged some places, as the 25. verse. Solomon also giueth to vnderstande, that hee chiefly reprooueth great men, when against greedinesse of gaine, hee setteth, to hate giftes, the which is verie fit and proper vnto them which are in au∣thoritie or office: euen as hath bin shewed by the law, for he saith, But he that hateth giftes shal liue. Moreouer let vs note in this Antithesis, that when he setteth, to liue, against troubling of the house, he doeth shewe vs that he doth not speake of a temporal trouble, and that soone taketh ende, but of an eternal destruction, as the same of the riche. For sith that hee Luke. 16. 26. promiseth life: and they which hate auarice, and giftes, doe often liue in penurie, pouertie and afflictions, the which is not properly to liue: let vs not thinke that hee speaketh onely of this life: other∣wise the state of honest men shoulde bee more miserable then the state of the wicked. But let vs vnderstande that hee promiseth lyfe eternal vnto those which hate and abhorre couetousnesse. If wee 2. Cor. 8. 7. & 9. 6. Ephe. 4. 28. 1. Tim. 6. 17. Hebr. 13. 5. wil be partakers of this promise, let vs folowe the admonition of Saint Paule and of the Apostle, and let vs in no wise folowe the o∣pinion of the carnal and worldly, which say, there is no better get∣ting then giftes. 28 The heart of the righteous studieth to answere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things. Solomon doeth not simply say, The heart studieth to answere: for it were then a general and vniuersal sentence, the which for the corruption of our nature, and the malice thereof, can not bee true: for there are blockishe mindes, and light wittes, which studie not, but doe onely rashly thinke what they wil say, so that it seemeth, they speake at a venture without studie: as they themselues doe wel confesse, either for to excuse themselues, or for to shewe that they care not what they say. For sith it is so (as the trueth vtte∣reth)
that from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh: it foloweth that man doeth not answere without studie, albeeit that Mat. 12. 34. it is without meditation: for studie, is done with thought, delibe∣ration, counsel and aduise. Solomon knowing this, woulde not ab∣solutely say, the heart studieth: but hee saieth, The heart of the iust doeth studie. And so he doeth not attribute studie to the hart, but to righteousnesse. If then wee woulde rightly studie to answere and speake as wee ought, let vs change our nature, and that of wic∣ked and vnrighteous wee may bee made good and righteous. Then God wil accept vs for righteous, giue vs grace to studie for to an∣swere, not vaine nor wicked thinges, but shal set our affection and desire in his lawe, and therein shal studie continually: in such wise as our mouthes shal talke of wisedome: and that wee may truely say, that the lawe of the Lorde is our continual studie: as also it is Psal. 1. 2. & 37. 30. & 119. 97. Deut. 6. 6. & 11. 18. commanded. And these woordes which I commande thee this day, shalbee in thy heart: lay vp then these woordes in your heart and in your minde, and binde them, &c. If wee bee thus giuen to studie, wee shal haue an argument of probation that wee are righ∣teous and wee shal delight to answere and pronounce righte∣ous and holy things. Wee wil not also take the name of the Lord GOD in vaine, neither wil wee beare false witnesse against our neighbours. To bee shorte, there shal not come foorth of our mouthes, any thing but pure, holy and cleane, according too Saint Paules counsel. And in thus dooing wee shal put away from vs a wicked mouth, &c. Contrarily, if wee make no account of studie, wee shal haue an argument and proofe that we are nothing Ephe. 4. 29. & 5. 3. Pro. 4. 24. woorth: and as wee shalbee wicked, euen so shal wee bee light and rashe to pronounce, euil things: as saieth Solomon, But the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things: to wit, against God and against their neighbours: for they make no conscience of blas∣phemie against God, nor to belye and to slaunder their neigh∣bours, or else to infect them with euil woordes: the which is a∣gainst the opinion of those which say, that words do not stinke, a∣gainst whome Saint Paule standeth, saying, Bee not deceiued. Euil 1. Cor. 15. 33. woordes corrupt good manners. Now albeit that he doth attribute euil thinges vnto the mouth, yet it is not to say, that they doe not
proceede from the heart, from the abundance whereof the mouth speaketh: but wicked things are attributed vnto the mouth, as vn∣to the instrument, which the heart vseth for to blowe or vtter out. Euen so the wicked may bee wel called, people without heart, af∣ter the common phrase of speeche, which is to say, that a man hath no heart, when he foloweth not his duetie. Furthermore the wicked sorte doe not thinke how they shoulde dispose and order their hartes, neither doe they thinke they haue any, as wee may knowe it, when they boast that they haue spoken something without studie, and that they reioyce in their sayings & outward doings Let them then which speake at aduenture, & vtter something nothing worth, not bragge to bee honest men, sith that Solomon doth attribute the spewing out of euil thinges vnto the wicked. But let euery one of vs reforme his tongue, in not vttering any thing abrode which shal not be first of al wel meditated by the woorde of God: otherwise wee cannot say that there is any reli∣gion in vs. If any man thinke to bee religious or deuout amongest Ia. 1. 26. you, and refraineth not his tongue, his religion is in vaine. If wee studie wel for to answere according to the meaning as we haue saide, before whome soeuer it bee, wee proceed as we ought, and obserue that which our Lorde commaunded his Apostles to Mat. 10. 19. Luke. 12. 11 & 21. 15. keepe. For hee forbiddeth not studie: but hee woulde not haue vs careful and to take thought, fearing to want an answere before the great men of the world. 29 The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous. The scripture witnesseth that God filleth heauen and earth. Wherin we must vnderstande that GOD is present euery where 1. Kin. 8. 27. Psa. 139. 7. 8 Esay. 66. 1. Iere. 23. 24. and ouer all. And yet Solomon saieth nowe, that the Lorde is farre of from the wicked: but it is not by distance of place, but by consent and helpe. For the Lorde agreeth not with the wicked, but abhorreth both them, their thoughts, and their woorkes, as wee haue seene heere before. Hee doeth not helpe them, but forsaketh and casteth them of. And also when the fayth∣ful are in affliction, and feele not the helpe of the Lorde present, Esay. 59. 1. 2.
they complaine that the Lorde is farre from them, and hath forgot∣ten them. Therefore let vs vnderstande that the Lorde is farre from the wicked, because hee giueth them not helpe: and it is because Psa. 10. 1. &. 13. 2. & 22. 2. Pro. 1. 25. Psa. 119. 155 they nothing regarde his worde. Health is farre from the vngodly, because they seeke not thy statutes. Wee may say also that the Lord is farre from the wicked: because that they themselues runne farre from him, and wil neither knowe him, nor vnderstande his workes, but say there is no God, and that fortune ruleth all. Wee may choose these three senses of the Antithesis that Solomon maketh heere, when hee saith, But hee heareth the praier of the righteous. For sith that against to bee farre of from, hee setteth in this verse, to heare the praier: and the Lorde in hearing, consenteth vnto the righteous, & is their helpe, and the righteous by their praier doe draw neere vn∣to God, so much as they can, crauing his presence and his helpe, and wishing to knowe him more and more, and to vnderstande his do∣ings and workes, it followeth wel that Solomon doeth shewe that we must vnderstand that the Lord is farre from the wicked, after the former sense. And thus in fewe wordes, Solomon doeth describe vnto vs the misery and destruction of the wicked, and also their ma∣lice, blindnesse, and obstinacie: & contrarily, the felicitie, & stabilitie of the righteous, and also their easinesse of learning and obedience, The righteous in this worlde seeme to bee cursed, and as it were for∣saken of God: for the worlde doeth afflict them, and labour to de∣stroy them: and for this cause it seemeth that God doeth not care for them, that hee hateth them, and hath reiected them: but sith that God heareth their praier, it followeth that they are and shalbe Psal. 22. 2. &. 71. 11 blessed, and shalbe firme and stable: for by their praiers, they aske deliuerance from al euils, & that God would preserue thē and giue vnto them euerlasting blisse. The which hee graunteth them, as we heere doe heare, when it is saide that the Lorde heareth their praier: Psal. 23. 18. 19 &. 34. 18 &. 145. 19. &. 50. 15. and also in other places. And forasmuch as the righteous do pray, the which God heareth, it followeth that they become willing to learne and obedient, vsing prayer, whereby they obey God, who saith, Cal vpon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will heare thee: and also that they aske nothing but according to his wil, otherwise they should not be hearde. And thus they become willing to learne,
and obedient, and the Lorde doeth not impute their sinne vntoo them, for the which cause nee is farre from them, as from the wic∣ked, we might adde (as the trueth is) that God accepteth their fayth Heb. 11. 6. Mat. 21. 22. Iohn. 15. 7. without the which none is acceptable to God, but with fayth he a∣uoweth all: as our Lorde promiseth. Wee doe then vnderstande howe wee shoulde make acceptable prayer vnto God, and shal haue a true argument that we are righteous, to wit, if wee bee cer∣tayne of the goodnes of GOD towardes vs, and that in this cer∣taintie we desire and labour to order ourselues vnto the wil GOD. For true fayth is not ydle, as our Lorde doeth teache vs, when hee asketh repentance with fayth. Whosoeuer woorketh righteous∣nes, Mark. 1. 15. Gala. 5. 6. Iea. 2. 14. 1. Ioh. 3. 7 is righteous. Nowe forasmuch as there is none, except hee bee out of his witte, which would haue God farre from him, but al de∣sire his helpe and succour, wee must needes abhorre al kinde of wic∣kednes, and that we aske of God to be iustified: that by our prayers wee may drawe him vnto vs for to helpe vs in all our necessities. Albeit then that GOD our father knoweth wel what wee haue Mat. 1. 8. neede of before wee aske: neuertheles sith that he woulde haue vs to pray vnto him, and that he delighteth when we speake vnto him priuily, let vs humble ourselues before him, submitting ourselues wholy to his holy wil, and confessing that all goodnes commeth from him, and that of ourselues we haue not, neither can haue any thing. 30 The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte. As the man which hath lost his sight cannot reioyce in his hart, but is troubled and greeued: euen so he which feeleth himselfe to diminishe in wit, and looseth his vnderstanding, cannot haue true ioy. Contrarily, as he that hath been blinde (if he recouer his sight,) doth delight and reioyce in himselfe: euen so hee which hath wal∣ked in the vanitie of his thought & imagination, if he come to be a∣waked Ephe. 6. 14. and raised out of his sleepe, and riseth from the dead, and that Christ doth lighten him, he wil reioyce in the Lorde, he wil cast far from him the workes of darkenesse, hee will be no more darkenes, as sometimes he was, but being light in the Lorde, wil walke as a Rom. 13. 12. Ephe. 5. 8. childe of light, receiuing that which is acceptable to the Lorde. So∣lomon
doeth declare vs this same in fewe wordes, saying: The light of the eies reioyceth heart, &c. We must thus vnderstand this sentence: for it shoulde not be notable, if Solomon spake of the corporal eies onely, except it were by comparison, admonishing vs, that if we haue a ioyful heart and are glad, when the darkenes of the night, or of any darke prison, or deepe pit, are passed, & that wee Rom. 13. 1, 2. Chr. 20. 12. doe see the brightnesse of the Sunne, and are at large in corporall and temporal libertie: by a much stronger reason ought wee to re∣ioyce when the night is past, and that the day is come: wherein the Psa. 25. 15. & 123. 1. 2 &. 141. 8. Lorde giueth vs that wee may walke honestly. Likewise the eies in the holy Scripture are taken for the spirite and minde of man in ma∣ny places. But our eyes are towardes thee. Mine eyes are euer to∣wardes the Lorde. Now when the Spirite and minde of man is ligh∣tened Mat. 6. 22. Psal. 19. 9. & 119. 14. 16. 162. by the worde, so that thereby it is lead in righteousnesse and true holinesse, hee reioyceth and delighteth. Suche is the nature of the worde receiued and disgested. Neuerthelesse, when it is saide, That the light of the eyes reioyceth the heart, wee may take these wordes as if hee saide, That man reioyceth in his heart, when hee seeth himselfe at rest and peace, and in prosperitie: so that he is not vexed, nor molested. For as the night, the darkenesse and obscuritie is taken for vexation, sorowe, aduersitie and miserie: euen so the light is taken for the contrarie. Wee haue looked for light, and be∣holde Esai. 56. 9. darkenesse, &c. This last sense is verie fit for that which Solo∣mon addeth, when hee saith, And a good name maketh the bones fat. For he sheweth by what meanes a man shal obteine prosperitie, peace & rest. He would haue man so gouerned, that he shoulde giue none occasion to bee blamed & rebuked, nor that any man shoulde thinke euil of him: but that hee shoulde get not abundance of tem∣poral goods,, power, credit, and authoritie: but shoulde labour to liue so wel, as he shoulde obteine a good name. He expresseth howe necessary it is for man to haue a good name, when hee saith, that it maketh the bones fat. For as when the bones are filled with marowe & compassed with flesh and skinne, a man feeleth himselfe whole & soūd: euen so he which getteth a good name, & is in good reputatiō with his neighbors, feeleth his ease: for his neighbors do not trouble him, & he knoweth that he proceedeth in a good con∣sciēce towards thē, the which is a great prosperitie, which Solomon
signifieth by fatting of the bones. The bones heere, which are mem∣bers of the body, are taken for the whole man: but chiefly for the Deut. 31. 20 Iob. 36. 16. Psa. 23. 5. &. 63. 6. & 65. 12. Esay. 55. 2. Iere. 31. 14. Pro. 11. 25. &. 13. 4. inwarde man, whome Solomon laboureth by these sentences to frame: otherwise they shoulde not bee notable. Nowe that to make fat, is taken for ease and prosperitie it is manifest enough in the holy scripture, For I wil bring them into the land (which I sware vnto their fathers) that floweth with milke and hony, and they shall eate, and fil themselues, and waxe fat. 31 The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, shall lodge among the wise. We wil not take the eare here, for the corporal member which is so named, nor harkeneth, for the outward hearing only, though it be verie profitable and necessarie: for wee may see many of those which heare correction of life, and yet doe not lodge amongst the wise, but doe despise and flye them, and some doe feare to meete them, and other some doe hate them and persecute them, diuers are sowne by the high wayes side. But we wil take the eare for the vn∣derstanding, and for the inward man, and to heare, for to receiue, to get & to obey. In this sort, there is no doubt but this sentence is ge∣nerally true, The eare that heareth, or hearkeneth to the correc∣tion, Mat. 13. 4. &c. If we wil then be wise & companions of the wise, & to be counted truely wise, we must not chafe, murmure, despight, nor stand against those which admonish, reprooue and correct vs in the name of God and by his woorde, but we must diligently heare the word of those which labour to amende and direct vs, that they may draw vs away from death, and leade vs vnto life. They which chide, cor∣rect and threaten vs, are the organes and instruments of GOD for to quicken vs: contrarily, they which prayse, flatter, and dissemble to see our fautes, are the organes & instruments of the Deuil for to kil and slay vs. And therefore Solomon doeth attri∣bute life vnto correction. In this he doth shew vs that he which ta∣keth vpon him to correct, ought to doe it by the word of God, the which only quickneth. For this cause God willing to admonish & re∣buke his people by his Prophet Ezechiel, doeth say vnto him. Thou Eze. 3. 17. 18 19. & 33. 11 shalt heare the wordes of my mouth. And afterwards he sheweth
him that if hee doe dissemble, that death followeth after: contra∣rily, if hee did exhort them, then life should followe both vpon him and vpon them which shoulde conuert. As truely as I liue, saith the Lorde God, I desire not the death of a sinner. We must be ware of the Popish corrections: for they come not from the mouth of the Lorde, but by the doctrine of the Diuel. But if wee cast of suche filthines and corruptions, and submit ourselues vnto the correction of life which is made vnto vs by the pure word of the eternal God, wee shal dwel and lodge with the wise, nor for a day or twaine, or certaine yeeres, but for euer: for if we lodge in this world amongst the wise, walking with them as wee ought, wee shal followe them vnto the heauenly habitations and lodgings, where is and shalbee their abiding: for the very wise indeede haue no continuing Citie Heb. 13. 14. &. 11. 13. heere, but they seeke for one to come. They thinke thēselues guests, strangers, & pilgrimes in this world. Therefore when Solomon doth promise vs a lodging among the wise, hee doth closely exhort vs to forsake the worlde. 32 Hee that refuseth instruction, despiseth his owne soule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderstan∣ding. It is very necessary that wee shoulde bee careful for our soules, because that through the corruption and malice of our nature they bee weake and giuen to euil: wherevpon they easily goe to destru∣ction and damnation. But there are but a fewe which thinke vppon this necessitie, and they thinke that they prouide wel enough for their soules, if they gather treasure enough. So doing, they turne Luke. 12. 16 &. 16. 19. their backs vnto God, who is the father & shepheard of our soules: they cast away his worde, which is the spiritual foode, fit, meete, and necessary for our soules, the which is communicated by the holy Scripture inspired of God. It seemeth vnto them that in reiecting 2. Tim. 3. 16. the yoke of the Lord they shal haue a mery time, and shalbe at their case, making good chere after the fleshe. In this sort they are decei∣ued if they thinke to haue care of their soules: for they doe rather loose them, as witnesseth the general flood and the ouerthrowing Luke. 12. 20 &. 16. 23. of Sodome and Gomorhe, and of the two rich gluttons. Solomon
also doth signifie it, saying He that refuseth instruction, or which careth not for, or forsaketh instruction, or discipline, &c. When by these words he signifieth the destruction of those which cannot en∣dure discipline, and instruction, and correction by the word of God, hee sheweth also that they deserue to perishe, seeing that in despi∣sing their soules, they doe against nature. For no man euer yet ha∣ted his owne fleshe. If the soule bee not gouerned as it ought, then must the whole man faile, which beareth the life of the soule, the which is mainteined by discipline, instruction, and correction. Albe∣it Eph. 5. 29. then that no correction for the present seemeth to be ioyous, but greeuous, yet let vs not refuse the same, seeing it bringeth foorth fruite afterwardes. True it is that the Apostle speaketh of the cha∣stenings that God sendeth vnto his children, the which ought not Heb. 12. 11. to bee esteemed after the feeling of the fleshe, who abhorreth the crosse, and shunneth it, as children doe the rod, not knowing howe profitable it is for them to bee corrected. But wee must haue respect vnto the ende: to wit, that the chastisments bring foorth righteous∣nesse: for the crosse leadeth vs vnto the feare of the Lorde, vnto a religious and holy life. Moreouer, the instruction or discipline which is spoken of, doeth not stande onely in woordes, but also in temptations, afflictions, and aduersities which it pleaseth God to sende vs. When the Lorde doeth lay them vpon vs, wee must not re∣fuse them through impaciencie, murmurings, and dispitefulnesse: He woulde haue vs to possesse our soules in patience: otherwise wee despise him, the which is very vnwisely doone of vs: as wee ought wel to vnderstande it: for it is great foolishnesse for a man to suffer Luke. 21. 19 him to perish. The which they do, that refuse instructiō: for in despi∣sing their soules, they forsake them, and so they must perishe. Solo∣mon therefore by the despising of the soule, sheweth the foolishnes and destructiō of them which care nothing at al for discipline. Con∣trarily, hee sheweth vs the preseruation and wisedome of those which willingly and gladly receiue al good instructions, admoniti∣ons and corrections that are made to them, and doe patiently suffer the corrections which God sendeth them, whē he saith, But he that heareth or obeieth. &c. Forasmuch as against despising of the soule, he setteth, getteth vnderstanding: let vs vnderstand that they which are not rebellious against the corrections, but doth receiue them pa∣tiently,
are wise, and by their wisdome are kept from destructi∣on: for as the soundnesse of the inward parts of the body is the pre∣seruing of the whole man: euen so wisdome which is the spirituall Pro. 1. 33. &. 2. 10. &. 3 13. health, keepeth the inward life of man. We speak thus, because that life and wisdome lyeth in the heart, as the Scripture saith. And the Lord hath not giuen you an heart to know, & eies to see, &c. I haue Deut. 29. 4. Psal. 22. 15. &. 40. 13. &. 104. 15. Pro. 10. 8. 13 &. 11. 12. 14. 30. 33. bin powred out as water, and my heart hath been melted like waxe, &c. A number of euils haue compassed mee about, and therfore my heart hath failed mee, &c. And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, &c. And albeit that getting is heere spoken of, yet let vs not vnderstande that it is any other thing then a pure and liberal gift of the Lorde. 33 The feare of the Lord is the instruction of wisdome: and before honour goeth humilitie. As we may see, Solomō is neuer wery to speake of the feare of the Lord and of wisdome: for he hath already oftentimes talked therof, and now againe he speaketh thereof, saying, The feare of the Lorde is the instruction of wisdome. Wherin he sheweth to his auditorie, that they ought not to bee greeued though he often repeate and re∣hearse one selfe doctrine, & that it is very necessary for vs too haue the feare of the Lord set before vs, whereby we learne not to flie frō the presence of God, and to hide ourselues from him, as if hee were a sharp & vnmerciful iudge, or a feareful and cruel tyrant: but wher∣out we learne wisdome. This feare doth not set before vs the paines & torments, for to bee astonished and terrified by them, as are the wicked which haue no minde to amend nor to doe wel. Albeit that we must feare the iudgements of God, wherewith we deserue to be beaten downe for the sinnes that we commit without ceassing and continually, desiring God to haue mercy vpon vs, and that being as∣sured therof, we should abhorre our sinnes, and turne vs to do wel, as he teacheth vs by his holy word, the which we shuld haue in such reuerēce as it should greatly displease vs to doe any thing against the same, and that our delight should be to submit & humble our¦selues thervnto, for to yeeld true obedience vnto our God. The holy Heb. 11. 7. Gene. 22. 12 Exo. 14. 31. Ps. 119. 120. fathers had this feare: as the scripture witnesseth of Noe, & of Abra∣ham. Again in Exod, The people feared the Lord. My fleshe trem∣bleth for feare of thee, and I am afraide of thy iudgementes.
This is the feare that God requireth of vs. This feare is the instru∣ction Deut. 6. 10 & 6. 2. 13. & 10. 12 Psal. 22. 24. & 33. 18 & 34. 10 of wisdome, as Solomon saith: And the cause of our foolish∣nesse is, that wee want this feare, whereby we might be truely wise: for it holdeth vs vnder the obedience of the word of God, which is the wisedome of the children of God. Without feare (as hath beene said) we are but fooles, and wee must begin thereby to forsake foo∣lishnesse, and to come vnto wisdome, which is the most honourable degree that we can obteine in this worlde: and yet there is nothing more vile and contemptible then is this feare, which hath been spo∣ken of, and from whence proceedeth this wisdome so honourable, euen as the worldlings themselues doe say, though they vnderstand it not. But since that Adam sinned, and that he hath made himselfe vile and contemptible, we must by humilitie and lowlinesse, contēpt and shame, come vnto honour: for as Solomon saith, Humilitie goeth before honour. If wee wil be honoured, let vs not bee like vn∣to our first parentes, who from the beginning woulde bee like vnto God: and minding to exalt themselues, haue suppressed and o∣uerthrowne themselues with al their posteritie, yea, euen vnto hel, from whence none coulde haue raised himselfe, except God of his grace and mercy, had not taken pitie vpon mankind. In thinking to exalt himself, he hath cast downe himselfe into great shame and re∣proche. Therefore let vs not seeke to raise our estate but let vs true∣ly confesse ourselues to be such as wee are indeede, to wit, vile, and of a base condition: let vs abace and humble ourselues, not praising ourselues before men to deface others. For to doe the same, let vs giue honour one vnto another, and let nothing bee doone by con∣tention Rom. 12. 10. Phi. 2. 3. or by vaine glory, but by humblenesse of heart. And let vs chiefly humble ourselues before God, not esteming ourselues wor∣thie to appeare before him, & he shal exalt vs. Two men went vp in∣to the Temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, & the other a Publicane, Luke. 18. 10 &c. And S. Peter saith, Humble yourselues therefore vnder the mightie hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time, &c. Wee 1. Pet. 5. 6 Luke. 24. 46 Phi. 2. 5. must not disdaine for to followe Iesus Christ.
The xvi. Chapter. 1 THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the an∣swere of the tongue is of the Lorde. FOrasmuche as from the abundance of the hearte the mouth speaketh, it followeth therof, that hee which gi∣ueth man leaue to speake, is gouer∣nour of the heart, and doth order it for to make it to vttter by the tongue such speache as hee pleaseth. Not∣withstanding, Solomon saith, that the preparation of the hearte is in man. Wherein it seemeth at the first sight, that there are three absurdities or inconueniences. For first of al it seemeth by his saying, that man hath power to prepare or di∣spose his hearte as he wil: wherevpon it followeth that wee haue no neede of the promises that God maketh vnto vs touching the Deut. 30. 6. Ier. 24. 7. & 30. 33. Eze. 11. 19. & 36. 26. Psal. 51. 12. refourming of our heartes and mindes, and also that wee haue no neede to pray vnto God for the ordering of our heartes, and that in vaine the holy fathers haue praied for it: as Dauid praied. Second∣ly, it seemeth that hee doeth attribute that vnto the creature which belongeth vnto the Creator onely: For sith that the answere of the tongue is of the Lorde, it followeth also that it is he which prepareth the hearte for to cause the tongue to speake. If hee must needes meddle with gouerning of the tongue, it is very necessary that hee haue in his power the ruling of the hearte, and to dispose it at his pleasure. Dauid did so wel vnderstande it: and therefore he asketh first Psal. 51. 12. 17. & 10. 19. the creation and renewing of the minde, and afterwardes hee asketh that God woulde open his lippes: Againe, Lorde, thou doest heare the desire of the humble: thou preparest their hearte, and thine eare hearkeneth therevnto, &c. Thirdly, it seemeth that hee preferreth
the creature vnto the Creator, attributing more vnto him then vn∣to Iam. 3. 6. the Lorde. For though the tongue is a member very hardly too bee gouerned: yet is it nothing in comparison of the hearte, from whome verily proceedeth the hardnesse of the tongue. We might alledge the fourth inconuenience: that is, that it should seeme that Solomon doeth attribute freewil vnto man, as touching the inward operations, and shoulde denie it him concerning the outwarde: which are not of so great excellencie: as our God doeth well shew 1. Sam. 16. 7. Psa. 7. 10. Iere. 17. 10. it vs, when hee challengeth the knowledge of the inwarde thinges. Wherefore let vs not thinke that Solomon hath pronounced the first part of this sentence affirmatiuely, as though hee gaue power vnto man for to prepare his hearte, as hee wil: but let vs vnder∣stande that he speaketh after a humane and carnal sense, in deriding the foolish trust of men, which doe boldly thinke, to consult, to pur∣pose and to take in hand euery worke of themselues without calling vpon God: seeing that without him they cannot pronounce the least worde that might bee spoken: the which is farre much lesse then to purpose, consult, and take in hande any thing to do. And is asmuch, as if he did say, man is so proude and arrogant, that hee dare of himselfe take in hande al thinges, euen the highest and the hardest, and yet there is not a little worke that is in his power to doe. We must then vnderstand howe Solomon vseth heere an iro∣nical kind of speach against the arrogancie of men, which dare take so much in hand. And for asmuch as the holy Ghost doth deride thē, it is an argument and proofe that they are neere vnto destruction. Nowe to the ende that wee may not be mocked, nor destroyed with Psa. 2. 4. 5. the arrogant, wee must humble ourselues, truely confessing that we haue neither spirite nor vnderstanding which can of it selfe consult vpon any good work. Solomō did wel vnderstand it, as he doth here closely shewe it: but it is more plainely expressed in the answere and demaunde that Solomon maketh vnto God, and also in the an∣swere that God made vnto him. Let vs also confesse that wee haue neither mouths nor tongues which can pronounce any good thing, except God giue it. The confusion of tongues doeth shewe it, 1. King. 3. 6. Gene. 11. 7. Psa. 51. 17. and in other places also. I haue expresly saide nothing that good is: for euil answeres come of ourselues, and of the Deuill, to whome
God giueth the reprobate ouer. Al the wayes of a man are cleane in his owne eyes: but the Lord pondereth the spirits. Neither Dauid, Iob, Esay, nor Daniel did euer thinke their Psa. 19. 13. 14. & 51. 3. Iob. 14. 4. & 15. 15. & 25. 4. wayes to bee cleane. And if with an vnfayned heart wee dayly aske pardon of God for our sinnes, our wayes wil not seeme vnto vs to bee cleane. For this cause when Solomon saieth, All the wayes of a man are cleane, &c: let vs vnderstande that hee spea∣keth of men which haue no knowledge of the trueth, nor doe fo∣lowe it, but are guided and ruled by their fantasies, and make them∣selues beleeue so much as they vtterly can, that whatsoeuer they thinke, say and doe, is good and iust, and that there is nothing in them that may bee reprooued, but praised and commended. With such kinde of people poperie is much replenished, and chiefly the celles and dennes of those spiritual theeues, Monkes and Nunnes. They also which cannot suffer to bee tolde their faultes, but what wickednes soeuer they commit, haue their mouthes ready open to lye, in reporting themselues to be honest men, doe labour so much as they can to make al their wayes cleane in their owne eyes and before their neighbours. But of al these same their iniquities are so stinking, that we may know that there is no cleannesse at al in them. If they wil not confesse it, yet God is not blinde: he hath so sharpe and pearcing a sight, that nothing can be hidde from him: as already sometimes hath beene shewed by the scriptures, and Solomon doth nowe shewe it vs, when he saith, But the Lorde pondereth the spirites. Solomon compareth GOD heere vnto a merchant, who for to discerne wel and truely betweene one marchandise & another, vseth ballances and waites. Now the ballāces of God are his wisedom, knowledge & vnderstā∣ding. By such ballances he trieth the goodnes and the frowardnes of mens harts, and thereby iudgeth with al equitie and vprightnesse, and truely. The Lorde is in his holie temple, The Lordes seate is in Psa. 11. 4. &. 33. 13. & 94. 9. &. 44. 21. heauen. His eyes consider the poore: and his eye liddes trieth the children of men. The Lord looked downe from heauen, and beheld
al the children of men. Hee which hath planted the eare, shal hee not heare? If wee had forgotten the name of our GOD, and helde vp our handes to any strange God, woulde not God haue sought it out? for hee knoweth the secretes of the hart. Al∣beeit then that men doe flatter and praise themselues, making them∣selues beleeue that there is nothing but al goodnesse in their waies, yet they winne nothing thereby, but doe rather loose and hurte themselues: for they haue to doe with a iudge which wil not iusti∣fie the vngodly which delighteth in his wickednesse. Thou art not a Psal. 5. 5. God which louest iniquitie. Therfore, what faire shewe of holinesse and righteousnesse soe∣uer that is shewed foorth in our life and conuersation, yet let vs not esteeme al our wayes cleane: but let vs confesse that we haue marks and blottes, vncleannesses and filthinesses which haue neede to bee clensed and purged. Let vs beleue, That if we say, we haue no sinne, we deceiue ourselues and there is no truth in vs. When wee shal 1. Iohn. 1. 8. truely confesse our filthinesse, though wee haue a iudge that loo∣keth narrowly vppon vs, yet will hee haue compassion vppon Heb. 4. 13. vs. 3 Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes shalbe directed. Albeeit that wee finde howe harde it is, yea almost vnpossible to bring many things to passe which we thinke, of and to finishe them as wee woulde (for most often our thoughtes and enterprises are made voyd:) yet are wee so wise in our opinion, that we thinke our¦selues sufficient to gouerne our affaires of ourselues, and to order our thoughtes. And heerein wee shewe a pride that Solomon la∣boureth to suppresse, when he sayth, Commit thy workes vnto the Lord, and thy thoughtes, &c. He laboureth also to deliuer vs from such weakenesse as hindereth vs to woorke, the which doeth seeme for to surmount our power and capacitie. Hee laboureth to turne vs away from distrust, which doeth torment vs, although with great boldnes we imploy and oc∣cupie ourselues about our duetie: but wee thinke that the labor that wee take, shal not bring foorth such fruite as wee desire, or that it
shal come to nothing, and that wee shal loose our paines, and our thoughts shal vanishe into smoke. Therefore for to remedie these three vices, pride, weakenesse, and distrust, hee woulde haue vs to re∣ferre ourselues to the pronidence of God. They which haue com∣mitted themselues thereto, haue come to the ende of their affaires, whereas other haue beene made voide of their hope. Adam and Gen. 3. &. 6. Eue did not commit their affaires vnto the Lord, but to the Diuel: and therefore they did not obteine their desire. Noe, contrarily referred himselfe vnto the prouidence of God, building an Arke at his commandement, for the sauegarde of his housholde, and his thoughts were directed: for as hee hoped, so came it to passe. Let them then which feele thēselues weake & voide of al mens help, not bee discouraged nor dispaire, as though it were vnpossible that they coulde obteine their wishe and desire: but in working as God gi∣ueth them, let them rest vpon the prouidence of God, and hee wil giue vnto them prosperite, as shalbe necessary for them. Solomon is not onely a witnesse hereof, but his father Dauid before him, see∣ing the worldly prosperitie of the wicked, the which was a greate temptation vnto the faithful and innocent which were in aduersitie doeth admonish them also, saying, Trust thou in the Lorde, and be Psal. 37. 3 & 55. 23. 1. Pet. 5. 7. doing good. Cast thy care vpon the Lord, and hee shall relieue thee. And after them, Saint Peter. And heerein we must not scatter with ehe wolues, nor feare if wee become sheepe that the wolues should tate vs: but knowing the prouidence of God, and the care that hee hath ouer vs, let vs bee patient and gentle, and let not the wic∣kednesse of men prouoke vs to be like vnto wilde beastes which re∣uenge themselues with their teeth, feete, nailes, and hornes, for to keepe that which they haue, or to spoyle other of theirs. Let vs then bee at peace and quietnesse in our consciences, and mindes, and to∣wardes our neighbours let vs bee soft, modest, gentle, and lowly. Concerning the rest, though wee must commit our affaires, and cast our burden vpon the Lorde, yet is it not to say, that God woulde haue vs to bee like vnto stones, and that wee shoulde bee voide of al iudgement Solomon doth signifie it, when he saith, Commit thy workes: and Dauid, when he saith, And giue thy selfe to doe well. They doe not preache vnto vs that God careth for vs for too leade vs vntoo idlenesse, slouthfulnesse, and carelesnesse: but least
that wee shoulde bee ouercome with feare, and that ouer muche thought shoulde driue vs vnto impaciencie: for the knowledge of the prouidence of god doth not deliuer vs frō al care, so that it is lawful for men to be without care, and to liue after the pleasure of their sensualitie and lust. Wee must not for the prouidence of God suffer our fleshe to haue his ease: but that our faith should make vs quiet and peaceable, and that wee shoulde prouoke ourselues nei∣ther inwardly nor outwardly against our neighbours. When euery one of vs shalbe careful to folow his vocation in a good conscience, beholding that God doth commande vs so to doe, and hoping that God wil blesse our labour, as he shal see expedient, committing our workes vnto the Lorde, then shal our thoughts bee directed: for wee shal not be made voide of our hope, but shal obteine our de∣sires: as the scripture doth shew in diuers places. Therfore let vs vn∣derstande that Solomon woulde haue vs to bee careful, and that we shoulde diligently imploy ourselues vnto work, and that we should doe our workes not thinking that of ourselues, wee can finishe to make our enterprise prosperous, or that in our worke wee must trust vpon some body, and that one of vs shoulde stay himselfe vpon an other, scattering our workes heere and there, and committing them to many: as doe the poore miserable Papistes which haue their re∣course and trust in many Patrones and Aduocates: but contenting ourselues with one onely Aduocate, wee must make as it were a scroule of our workes, binde them vp together, and commit all the charge to him, without distrusting him. Thus doing, our thoughtes shalbee directed and established, that wee shall obteine as wee de∣sire. Solomon hath so vnderstoode it, when hee saide, Commit thy workes. &c. 4 The Lorde hath made al things for his owne sake: yea, e∣uen the wicked for the day of euill. The names and titles which are attributed vnto God in the scrip∣ture doe shewe that he is of suche vertue, maiestie, and might, that hee hath no neede of any creature for to borrowe that, which hee wanteth, or to make him more perfect in himselfe. The scrip∣ture doeth name him the Almightie, The Lorde, The Almightie,
the highest, the holy one: not after the maner of men, which for to flatter the great men, and to bee welcome towardes them, wil giue thē titles which might wel agree vnto their estate, but they withstād their manners and kinde of doings, as some wil cal the Pope, their holy father: and yet there is neither holinesse nor fatherlinesse in him, except hee beget bastardes, or children to the Diuel, by do∣ctrines and mens traditions. Other shalbe called Catholike and most Christian, and yet notwithstanding they shal haue neither faith nor Christianitie, but shal labour for to abolishe the faith and religion: as the interim doeth giue witnesse, and the prisons, banishmentes, confiscations and burninges doe shewe it in Poperie. But our God is of such nature, that no man can giue vnto him titles and names too excellent, yea it is altogether vnpossible that wee should expresse by words what he is: for hee surmounteth infinitely al things both heauenly and earthly, both corporal and spiritual, so that wee cannot worthily enough either thinke or speake of him. Wherefore, let vs with al humblenesse, feare and reuerence, thinke and speake of our God, knowing that of ourselues we are not fit nor meete ther∣vnto. Now for to thinke or speake wel thereof, let vs beleeue & cōfesse that which was saide at the beginning, That hee is of suche vertue, and power, that hee hath no neede of any creature, to borrowe and take of him what he needeth. He hath wel shewed this same, when Gen. 1. Psal. 33. 6. Esay. 40. 12. of nothing hee created al things by his onely worde. Esay also doth wel shew it, who is he that hath measured the waters with his fist? & counted heauen with the span, & comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure? and waighed the mountaines in a waight, and the hilles in a ballance? Who hath instructed the spirite of the Lord? or was his counsellour, or taught him? Neuerthelesse foras∣much as God hath nothing more precious, nor more that hee estee∣meth then his name, his glory, and his honour, and that he wil bee knowne, serued, and honoured, for this cause hee hath had regarde to himselfe when hee created al thingss and woulde and wil stil bee glorified in them. Solomon doth declare it vs now, when he saith, The Lorde hath made all things for his owne sake. Hee speaketh rightly so: for when hee purposed to create the heauens, the
earth and that which is conteined in them, there is nothing which can moue him thervnto, but himselfe. The goodnesse and excellen∣cie of things which hee purposed to doe, coulde not stirre him vpp to doe it: for there neither is, nor can be in any creature, any good∣nesse or worthinesse, that God of his onely grace and pure liberalitie hath not put in them, & for the which he ought not but to be prai∣sed, glorified, and thanked. To the end then that we may not haue such witnesses against vs, let vs loke to what end God hath created vs, and let vs followe it, and willingly glorifiyng our Creator, tru∣sting vpon his goodnesse, and giuing ourselues to followe his will: and that wee bee not like vnto the wicked, which doe tende to no∣thing but to dishonour God, and wil not serue him, and yet hee hath created them for himselfe: as Solomon doeth signifie, when hee saith, All things. They must therefore serue him against their willes, and to their hurte and destruction. Solomon doeth shewe it when hee doeth more openly expresse that GOD hath created the wicked euen for himself: For hee is not contented to say that God hath made the wicked, but hee saith, euen the wicked for the day of euill. This is a very strange thing at the first sight, to say that God hath made the wicked to be glorified in their destru∣ction. But the matter well considered, wee shal see the goodnes and iustice of God shine therein. When hee stopped the purpo∣ses of the wicked, and doeth bereaue them of their enterprises they take in hande against his people, any man that hath sounde iudgemēt wil not say but that it is good: & when for their obstina∣cie and hardnesse hee shal destroy them, men shal knowe that hee is iust, as hee hath doone vnto the people of Sodom, and to Pharao Gen. 19. 24. and to the people of Egypt, vnto Saule, and vnto diuers other wic∣ked men. And if they dare spue out this blasphemie against God, & say, that the faulte ought to bee imputed vnto him, seeing hee ma∣keth the wicked to this end, & that it is not possible to resist his or∣dinance & will: to this wee may answere, first of al that Saint Iames saith, Whē any man is tempted, let him not say, I am tēpted of God, for God tēpteth no man. Secōdly, that which Paul saith, But what Iam. 1. 3. art thou, O man, which disputest with God? We must not be so pre∣sūptuous, as to iudge of gods works which surmoūt our capacity, Rom. 9. 20.
but in humbling ourselues vnder iustice, which is incomprehensible vnto vs, let vs crie, O the depth of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of God! how incomprehensible are his iudgements, and his waies past finding out! In this our crie, let vs feare the iudge∣ments Rom. 11. 33. of God, as did Noe: and let vs haue compassion vppon the wicked, as had Abraham. Behold, howe we must be haue ourselues towardes the iudgements of God, and not to examine them from Hebr. 11. 7 Gene. 18. 24. point to pointe, for to iudge of them after our sense and reason: for they are vnsearchable. And if we can not rightly behold the Sunne, which is but a creature, by a more strong reason wee must vnder∣stande, that it is vnpossible to see God in his Maiestie: wherevnto neuertheles wee labour when we enquire of his iudgements more then that he doth open vnto vs by his worde. 5 All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee shal not be vnpunished. It is not without cause that Dauid protesteth, Lord, my heart is not hautie, neither are mine eyes loftie, neither haue I walked Psal. 131. 1 in great matters and hid from mee. For hee desired to liue after the wil of the Lorde: as hee doeth shewe by his desires and prayers that hee maketh: let the wordes of my mouth, and the meditation of mine heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lorde, my strength and Psal. 19. 14. my Redeemer. O Lorde, I beseeche thee, accept the free offeringes of my mouth, and teach mee thy iudgements. Teache mee to doe thy Psal. 119. 108. & 143. 10. wil, for thou art my God, &c. Nowe hee knewe that hee could not please God, but in submitting himselfe vnto him in al reuerence, feare and humilitie: for as hee wel vnderstoode, the proude doeth displease him, and are abhominable vnto him. The Lorde hath wel shewed it in the ouerthrowe of Sodome, Beholde the sinne of So∣dome thy sister was pride, fulnesse of bread, and idlenes, &c. He hath done the like in the destruction of the enemies of his people: and the Eze. 16. 49 Scripture doeth witnesse it in diuers places. Amongst other places we haue Solomon, who saieth nowe, Al that are proud of heart, are in abhomination to the Lord. And sith there is none of vs, how ignorant soeuer he be, that would be abhorred of the Lord, but do
all from the highest to the lowest desire to please him, wee must re∣nounce pride, which chiefly consisteth in the contempt of the word, and in the boldnesse or rather ouerboldnesse that we haue to giue ourselues vnto wickednes with a set purpose, euen when we know well that wee doe euil, and that therein wee be assured, or at least∣wise labour to make ourselues so beleeue that wee haue no neede to feare: but notwithstanding what resistaunce soeuer wee meete withal, wee wil goe forewarde with our enterprises. The worlde destroyed by the flood, was stained with suche pride: as wee may Gen. 6. 2. Pet. 2. 5. 6. 7. knowe it, when by the space of sixe score yeares they regarded not to heare Noe the Embassadour of righteousnes. Euen so were the Zodomites which oppressed iust Lot, by their filthie conuersation. The people of Israel likewise was blotted therewith: as wee may see by the rebukes that Moses and the Prophetes haue often giuen Deut. 32. 5 Esai. 28. 14 them. And nowe when the same wickednesses doe reigne amongst those which brag of the name of Christendome, they shewe wel that they are defiled with the same pride: wherevppon wee must looke for an horrible destruction: for God chaungeth not. If in time past, hee hath so reuenged himselfe vpon the proude, decla∣ring that hee abhorred them, although hee seeme to dissemble, or that he knoweth not at this time the pride of these wicked mockers and contemners, yet after hee hath patiently looked for their a∣mendement, hee wil destroy them in his wrath, the which they daily heape to themselues: for the punishmentes of times past doe declare that the wicked in time present shal not escape the hande of Rom. 2. 5. 2. Pet. 2. 5. the Lord. Let vs therefore flye al pride, and not looke what cre∣dite, authoritie and power, the proude haue in the worlde, because they are in great number, and are wel ioyned and confederated af∣ter the carnal sense. Notwithstanding, these thinges that the worlde esteemeth greatly, shal nothing let that God at his appointed time shoulde not destroy them: they shal not be exempted from his wrath, but that it shalbe easie for him to destroy them therein. So∣lomon doeth signifie it when he sayth, Though hand toucheth hand, he shall not be vnpunished. The wicked doe giue handes one vnto another, to doe euill, and doe mainteine themselues as though they did conspire to resist God: but he mocketh their con∣spiracies.
Heeretofore Solomon hath vttered the like sentences a∣gainst the frowarde and wicked, comforting also the vpright and perfect by promises. 6 By mercie and truth iniquitie shalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill. When the superstitious and idolaters doe thinke that God is angrie against them for their sinnes, and that they feare to bee pu∣nished for them, for to auoide the paine, and not sorowe for their sinne, they wil labour to content God with ceremonies and obser∣uations of doctrines and mens traditions, with foolishe deuotions which they do vpon a good intent, & other inuentiōs of their own braines that God neuer commaunded, but doe displease him: for hee woulde haue vs attentiue vnto his worde onely, and that wee shoulde serue him after his commaundementes, by the which hee doeth declare vnto vs his wil, whereunto wee must obey, forsa∣king al wickednesse. Thus doing we shal haue God merciful vn∣to vs: as Solomon doeth promise vs, saying, By mercie & trueth iniquitie shalbe forgiuen. Solomon heere woulde not haue vs to linger about trifles for to please God, as if hee were a little childe that might bee pleased with an Apple or with a Ball; or some foolishe and vaine man, which is pleased with worldly pastime: but that wee may not bee like vnto the Scribes & Pharisies, & lest we deserue the rebuke that is in Saint Mathew, he setteth before vs what is the greatest pointe Mat. 23. 23. of the lawe, and that which God most requireth aboue al things: to witte, mercy and trueth: and doeth promise vs, that if wee bee true vnto our God, not turning from him after straunge Gods, but haue al our trust in him, beeing assured of his goodnes towards vs, and certified that he doth loue vs, & that in this certaintie & assu∣rāce we be soft, gentle, louing & merciful towards our neighbours, in helping them with that which they haue need of, that God wil be merciful, and wil not impute our sinnes vnto vs. Notwithstanding let vs not thinke that hee will leade vs to trust in our merites, nor that he intendeth that by our mercy & our truth we should satisfie
our faultes before God, so that by such satisfaction, God should bee pleased, and should forgiue vs the paine, the which otherwise hee had laide vpon vs for our offences: but after the maner of the scrip∣ture, hee signifieth that they which by mercy and trueth shall con∣uert vnto God, forsaking their former vices and sinnes, that they shal finde him merciful: as if hee saide, If wee rest and cease from our misdeedes and wickednesses, so wil God appease his wrath, and make his iudgement to cease, and wil forbeare the condemnation and punishment that wee had deserued. Nowe because it is need∣ful for to haue constant perseuerance in trueth, and folowe good∣nesse and mercie, let vs flye al wickednesse. Solomon doeth shewe vs howe wee shal come vnto the ende, when he saieth, And by the feare of the Lord they depart from euil. The which he hath taught vs before. Besides this, let vs first of al note, that although Solomon Pro. 3. 7. & 8. 13. & 14. 16. nameth mercie before trueth: yet wee must vnderstand, that by or∣der fayth proceedeth, and mercy foloweth as the fruite, but vnsepa∣rably. Secondly, let vs note, that the iustification that wee obteine by the remission of our sins, is giuen to fayth, for that it layeth hold vp∣on the free promises of God, from whome come al blessinges to vs, and nothing from our merites. 7 When the wayes of a man please the Lord, he wil make al∣so his enemies at peace with him. If wee be stirred to anger, or that wee haue a contentious and troublesome spirite which wil sodenly fight, and doeth delight in fighting, braules, and dissentions, wee shoulde greatly desire peace, and wee thinke that wee can haue nothing to profite vs without it: the worldlings and carnal men, which wil counsel their neighbours how they shal take their ease, saying, Buy peace, and an house alrea∣die made. And indeed peace is a verie great blessing, which is much desired, and chiefly when wee haue to doe with enemies, that wee thinke to be stronger then wee bee, and whome wee feare shoulde hurt vs, and with whome wee shoulde haue mortal warre. But of∣tentimes it happeneth, that willing to auoide one warre, wee enter into a more dangerous. Wee seeke peace with men, and we make
ourselues the enemies of God: for wee folowe vnlawful meanes: as did the children of Israel for to deliuer themselues from their e∣nemies, and to cause warre to cease, had their refuge, sometimes to Exo. 3. & 34. 12. Deut. 7. 3. Esay. 31. 1. the Egyptians, sometimes to the Assirians against the commaun∣dement of God, who had forbidden them to make leagues with strange peoples and idolaters. Woe to them which goe downe in∣to Egypt for to seeke for helpe, and haue not enquired of the Lord. The Papistes are of that number which seeke vnlawful meanes: as is seene in al their deuotions in time of warre. And as touching particular matters betweene man and man, for to get peace and to stay his enemie, hee thinketh there is no way but to suppresse him, against that which Iesus Christ teacheth vs, Resist not euil, &c. But as wee commonly feele by experience, by such kinde of doings the fire is kindeled more strongly, and for one Mat. 53. 39. Rom. 12. 17. 1. Peter. 3. 9. enimie wee get many, as also wee deserue: for in so doing wee fol∣low not the waies of peace, which is to please, & to be an acceptable seruice vnto God, who is the authour of al peace, and giueth it too them which giue themselues to please him: as Solomon doeth pro∣nounce it, saying, When the waies of a man please the Lord. &c. If then we woulde haue that God shoulde stay our enimies, and that he should quiet them (as there is none but he, that can doe it) let vs looke so honestly to gouerne ourselues, that we neither thinke, speake, nor doe any thing that shoulde displease him. The which we shal do, if wee feare him, and trust in him folowing his commandements, Hee delighteth not in the strength of an horse: but the Lords delight is Psa. 147. 1. 11. & 149. 4. in them which feare him with lowlines of minde. For the Lord de∣lighteth in his people: and helpeth the meekeharted. Let vs then proceed after this sort, trusting in the Lorde, that wee may protest, Lord, I lift vp my soule vnto thee: in thee my God doe I trust. Thus doing, our wayes shal please the Lorde, and so much as shalbee ex∣pedient, Psal. 25. 1. 2. he wil quiet our enemies: as he hath done Laban towardes Iacob, and Esau towards Iacob, Pharao towards Moyses, Saule to∣wards Dauid: euen as we may see by the holy histories. Let vs then walke in humblenesse of minde, fearing our God, depending vppon him, and giuing ourselues to obey him, then may we say, The Lorde
is my light and my saluation: whom then shall I feare? the Lorde is Psa. 27. 1. &. 118. 6. the strength of my life: of whome then shal I be afrayde? The Lord is on my side, therefore I will not feare what man can doe vnto me: We must thus thinke, speake, and woorke with patience. Cast not away your trust the which hath great recompence of reward. True∣ly Heb. 10. 35. 6. ye haue neede of patience, that after hauing done the wil of God, you may obtaine the promise. 8 Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes with∣out equitie. Solomon willing to leade vs to sobrietie, contentation, softe∣nes, and goodnes, to reuerence and obedience towardes God, vntoo peace, vnitie and amitie, towardes our neighbours, doeth set before vs, that, Better is a little with quietnes. &c. Wherin he agreeth wel with twoo former sentences. But what care soeuer hee hath to Pro. 15. 16. 17. teach vs wel and to shew vs how we shal make our profit of the ri∣ches that God giueth vs. Neuertheles, those which thinke and say, that we must turne our backe vnto God for to become rich, as doe the couetous & vsurers, they which occupie with wicked trades, & do pille, & extort, theeues & robbers & al kind of people, which haue their hearts so much in the world, that they feare the earth shal faile wil mocke at his doctriue, euen so will the gluttons, and drunkardes which haue vnsatiable bellies, and al they which knowe not the pro∣uidence of God, and stay not themselues therevpon, but thinke that fortune which is nothing, doeth rule, and that riches doe happen to those whom fortune fauoureth, or which taketh care and haue cun∣ning to get them. Al such kinde of people wil mock at this doctrine as the Pharisees which were couetous, did mocke our Sauiour Iesus Christ, when he sayd, Make you freendes with the riches of iniqui∣tie. Luk. 16. 14. 9. But what contempt and mockage soeuer they vse, the former sentences cease not to be true, & we haue not only Solomon which giueth witnes hereof, but before him Dauid also, A smal thinge that the righteous hath, is better then great riches of the vngodly. And Psa. 37. 16. also experience hath shewed it, and doeth still shewe it. Abraham being the land of Canaan as a stranger, was not after outwarde ap∣pearance
to be compared in worldly wealth with the Kings & Prin∣ces of the earth: but the people that he had in respect of them, was better thē their great abundance was: for with this that he was cō∣tented & had enough, & possessed in a sounde conscience, without doing wrong to any man, that which hee had, hee had obteined the great heauēly riches, which he looked for. Cōtrarily, the great men Heb. 11. 10. of the earth aspiring continually vnto greater riches, hauing neither contentation nor enough, but hauing committed much wrong and violence, & being at continual strife, in the ende perished most mi∣serably. Sodome is a feareful example thereof. Moyses did so vnder∣stande Gene. 18. 20. & 19. 24. Eze. 16. 49. Heb. 11. 24. 1. Kinges. 17. 10. Luk. 12. & 16. it, when hee denied to bee the Sonne of Pharaos daugh∣ter. Elie and the widowe which nourished him, did prooue it true. For the reprouing and condemning of wicked riches, we may bring examples out of Saint Luke. And for the time present we may see, if wee haue eies, that the poore which are contented with a little, liue more at their ease then they which aspire vnto greater riches. I say expresly the poore which are contented: for the poore world∣lings and carnal minded men which thinke they serue for nothing but to get, are in a most miserable state: because that first of al they are neuer contented, but doe murmure and grudge, euen against God, who seeketh to kil them, as they holde in their fantasie and minde: as by impatience they dare spue out. Secondly, they liue in an euil conscience: for being discontented with their pouertie, they perswade themselues that riches are common, and that they may take them where they finde them: and indeede, where they are not seene, they pille, poule and steale whatsoeuer they can meete withall. Thirdly, as they are in paines & torments in this world, euen so after this life they shal remaine for euer: for they haue bin iniurious both to God & to their neighbors, in that they haue not bin contē∣ted with the things which God hath giuen them, though they were smal, but murmured & waited not vpō his prouidēce, & in this that they haue rauished the goods of their neighbours, against the com∣mandement of God, Thou shalt not steale: & against loue. Let vs thē looke to folow our Lord, Take heed, & be ware of couetousnes: lay Luke. 12. 15. Math. 6. 19. not vp your treasures on earth, but make you treasures in heauen:
And Saint Paul agreeth herewith, teaching vs to help the necessitie 2. Cor. 8. 7. & 9. 6. Heb. 13. 5. of the poore. The Apostle likewise, saith. Let your conuersation bee without couetousnes, &c. Thus doing, wee shal possesse our goods in righteousnes, the which, as concerning our present purpose, con∣sisteth in this, that we put our trust in the prouidēce of God, & that we be good & faithful stewards of the riches that he hath commit∣ted vnto vs. In this maner when wee shal haue but a little after the feeling of the fleshe, it shalbetter profite, then if wee did other∣wise possesse great wealth. For they that are riche without righ∣teousnes and equitie, shal perishe with their goods. When Solo∣mon speaketh thus, Hee condemneth not absolutely great reue∣news, Mar. 10. 22. 23. but those which are wickedly gotten & possessed, which con∣sisteth, touching the present matter, in distrust of the prouidence of God, in vnsatiable couetousnesse, and in contempt of the poore. 1. Timo. 6. 9. 9 The heart of man purposeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his steppes. As we beleeue that God hath created the heauen and the earth, the sea, and al the contents in them, euen so ought wee to holde for certaine, that hee gouerneth al, & that al is disposed & gouerned by his prouidence, & that al is done by his counsel & ordinance, & this that which we daily confesse, when we say, I beleeue in God the Fa∣ther almightie, maker of heauen & of earth. For confessing him to be Almightie, we wil not only say, that hee hath the power without exercising it, but that he hath al creatures in his hand and subiectiō, that he disposeth al creatures by his prouidēce, gouerneth the world by his wil, & guideth whatsoeuer is done after, as best pleaseth him: for wee must not imagine, that the power of God is ydle: but wee must vnderstande further: to wit, that hee is alwayes at woorke, and that nothing is done but by him, or with his leaue, and with his ordinance. The Scripture doeth giue it so to vnderstande in diuers places. The heauens were made by the woorde of the Psa. 33. 6. & 104. 24. Iohn. 5. 17. A. 14. 15. Lorde. O Lorde, howe wonderful are thy woorkes! My Father woorketh hitherto, and I woorke also. Turne you vnto the liuing GOD, who hath made both heauen and earth, &c. Hee giueth
life and breath vnto al, &c. Hee which planteth, and hee which watereth is nothing: but God which giueth increase. There is 1. Cor. 3. 7. &. 12. 6. Phi. 2. 13. one God which worketh al things in al men. It is God that woor∣keth in you both the wil and the deede, euen of his good wil. And forasmuche as it is God which exerciseth his power, neuer ceasing from woorking, but dooing al thinges as seemeth him good both Psa. 135. 6. in heauen and in earth: as Dauid doeth confesse it, I knowe that the Lorde is greate: The Lorde hath done al thinges according to his wil, both in heauen and in earth: let vs take heede to attri∣bute any thing to ourselues, as if of ourselues wee had some po∣wer: but in al humblenes, let vs confesse and acknowledge, Lorde I knowe, that the way of man is not in himselfe, neyther is it in Iere. 10. 23. man to walke and to directe his steppes. For wee must acknow∣ledge, as the trueth is, that wee are altogether in the handes of GOD, and that hee disposeth of vs, against al our humane and carnall thoughtes, that wee shoulde not presume to assure our¦selues in our estate, allowing it good of ourselues, for God can chaunge it immediately, and doe with it as hee hath ordeined in his eternal counsel, the which ought necessarily to bee fulfilled, and can not be altered. Notwithstanding, let vs take heed from falling into this false o∣pinion and errour, for to thinke, or to say, that we haue nothing to doe, & to meddle, to think, to counsel & take aduise how we should gouerne them ourselues, seeing that it is necessarie that al must hap∣pen as God hath ordeined frō euerlasting. For as it is great foolish∣nesse and ouerboldnesse to take in hande any woorke without the Lorde, by whose gouernment wee are al ruled: euen so is it great beastlinesse and blockishnesse, for to esteeme that the prouidence of God shoulde stoppe and hinder vs that wee shoulde not consult and deliberate vpon our affayres, and shoulde not labour to doe them with good discretion. And therfore, as here before, in the first verse, hee hath mocked at the foolishnes and arrogancie of those which enterprise of themselues: euen so nowe hee reprooueth the beastlines and blockishnes of those which think that the prouidēce of God hindereth vs to counsel howe wee shoulde rule ourselues in our busines, when hee saieth, The heart of man purposeth his way, &c. When he thus speaketh, hee doeth shew vs that the eternal
ordinances of God doe not hinder vs, but that wee shoulde looke vppon his wil to prouide for ourselues, and to rule al our actions. Now this is not without some manifest reason: for hee which hath bounded and limitted our life, hath also therewith giuen a careful∣nes, and hath fenced vs with helpes & meanes to preserue the same. He hath also made vs to foresee dangers: and to the end that they shoulde not oppresse vs without warning, hee hath furnished vs with remedies. Wee may nowe see what belongeth to our office: to wit, if God hath committed the charge vnto vs to preserue our life, let vs keepe it: If hee doeth offer vs helpes and succours, let vs vse them: If he doeth shewe vs of the dangers, let vs not cast our¦selues at aduentures, and without consideration: If hee furnishe vs with remedies, let vs not despise them. Let vs not then folowe these dreamers which doe not consider howe the Lorde hath inspi∣red and breathed the knowledge of counselling and taking heede, whereby they serue the prouidence of God, and vnto the conser∣uation of our ownelife: as contrarily, by contempt and blockish∣nes they drawe and cal vpon them the plagues which the Lord God hath ordeined for them. For wee shal see that a man which is care∣ful to consult and deliberate, shal deliuer himselfe from present and neere dangers, and the foolish and negligent for want of conside∣ration and counsel, shal perishe. And this because that foolish∣nesse and wisedome are instrumentes of Gods prouidence, aswel for one parte as for the other: For this cause God hath hidden from vs thinges to come, that wee shoulde withstande them, as in ad∣uentures that men looke for, not knowing what shalbe the ende, and that wee should not cease to set against them the remedies pre∣pared, till wee become vnto the marke, or that our care serueth vs to no profite. Then the prouidence of God ought not to hinder vs, but that wee shoulde doe our office, and prouide for ourselues. Beholde, Saint Paule saieth wel, that God worketh both the will, and the deede in vs, and yet hee ceaseth not to exhort vs to worke Phi. 2. 13. 12. out our saluation. 10 A diuine sentence shalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth shal not transgresse in iudgement.
Diuination is a thing verie abhominable before God, as the scrip∣ture doeth shew vs: first of al, when it is commanded that the diui∣ners shalbe put to death. Secondly, when Israel is praised for this, that they had no soothsaying nor diuining. Thirdly, when it is Leui. 20. 27. Num. 23. Deut. 18. 11. 2. Kin. 17. 17▪ forbidden to aske counsel at the soothsayers. Fourthly, when a∣mongst the abhominations, for the which the people of Israel pro∣uoked the wrath of God, it is said, that they were giuen to folow soothsayers. Fifthly, when the Prophets are careful to turn the peo∣ple away from the soothsayers: yet would Solomon haue that diui∣nation should be in the kings lips. Heere he desireth nothing against the law of the Lord, but hee speaketh by a similitude, & would that as the Diuines doe promise themselues that they are inspired from God, & that they persuade men to beleeue that they giue a true and certaine answere, as if God had reuealed & spake by their mouths: euen so, that kinges and gouernours of the earth shoulde bee so instructed in the lawe of the Lorde, that according thereunto they shoulde consult, purpose and counsel to doe iustice and iudgement, and shoulde giue themselues to pronounce righteous and true sen∣tences, and to publish holie decrees & ordinances: in such wise, that for the aduancement of the glorie and honour of God, and for the profite and saluation of the people, they shoulde be in so great esti∣mation towards the children of God, as were the Diuiners amongst the superstitious and idolaters. Solomon doeth expounde him¦selfe, when hee addeth, His mouth shal not transgresse in iudge∣ment. For hee declareth that hee woulde haue the diuination suche, that the Kinges shoulde neuer speake but thinges that are right, and iust. Wherein he sheweth not, what are the great men of the earth, but what they ought to be in their wordes, and so con∣sequently in their thoughtes and affections of their heartes, from which the wordes doe come. Wherein also hee giueth vs to vn∣derstande, that they which can not diuine, doe straye from equitie, and consequently, are not worthie to bee in authoritie and gouern∣ment: yet, it is not to say, that their subiectes should not giue them honour and obedience in whatsoeuer they offend not against God, Rom. 13. 1. 5. 1. Pet. 2. 13. 1. Tim. 2. 1. And they must pray for their Superiours. Likewise, let this sentence serue vs to exhorte vs to leade so holy a life, that wee may please the Lorde, and that wee take good heede from prouoking him to
anger by our wickednesses: otherwise wee should be worthie that hee shoulde remooue and take away from vs suche Princes & Go∣uernours as haue diuination: as hee hath threatened his people of Israel, and hath executed it, when hee gaue them Kings, Gouernors, and Priestes, vnder whom al thinges were corrupted, and when he Esa. 3. 2. made them subiect vnto idolatrous Kings. 11 A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke. The Kinges, Princes and Lordes of the earth, doe ordeine waights and measures in their countries, and according to their or∣dinances must the Merchants sel and buy their marchandizes, with∣out any deceit or guile. And to the ende that the same may bee the better obserued, the Magistrates, Iudges and Superiours ought to be watchful that the waights, and measures should be knowne of al men: they ought also to be vigilant and take diligent heede to this, that they which sel, keepe not two kindes of waights, & two kindes of measures. Moyses was as the Prince and Gouernour of the peo∣ple, and it is to him that God speaketh that hee shoulde cause it to bee obserued. Yee shal haue a iust balance, and iust waightes, &c. Thou shalt not haue in thy bagge twoo maner of waightes. Leui. 19. 35. Deut. 25. 13 Nowe forasmuch as God hath commanded iust and true waights, and that hee abhorreth the contrarie, it foloweth wel, that they which cause iust waightes to bee kept, and also they which sel them, doe the woorke of God: for hee commaundeth nothing but that hee himselfe shoulde doe. Solomon did so meane, as hee sheweth when he saith, A true waight and Ballance, &c. Hee shew∣eth also that the false sellers and they which suffer them, doe falsifie the woorke of the Lorde God, and so muche as in them lyeth, doe make him a false God: and so not onely they deceiue their neigh∣bours, but also they labour to make God guiltie of great enormi∣ties: for suche sale is abhominable, as the places before alledged do shewe it. And Micheas, Are not the treasures of wickednesse Mich. 6. 1. 11. yet in thy house? Shall I purge awaye the false Ballaunce? &c. Suche sellers also woorke the woorke of the Deuil, and doe serue him, for GOD must needes be serued, otherwise wee
serue the Deuil. Furthermore let vs note, that Solomon doeth set vs downe heere one kinde of Ciuil ordinances, for to shewe vs that al suche as repugne not the worde, and are made for to mainteine good order in political gouernment, are of God and not of men. Finally, wee are heere admonished that God loueth the diuision of goods of the world, which are done without deceit: for if al things were common, wee shoulde not neede balances nor waightes. 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes for the throne is established by iustice. The holie Ghost hath bene verie careful and diligent to shewe vnto Kings, Princes, & gouernors of the earth their lesson: as wee may see by the Scripture. Moreouer, Prouide thou among al the Exo. 18. 21. Deut. 17. 18. Psa. 2. 10. & 58. 2. & 82. 3. 2. Chro. 19. 6 people, men of courage, fearing God, men dealing truely, hating couetousnesse: and appoint suche ouer them, to bee rulers, &c. And when hee shall sit vpon the throne of his kingdome, then shal hee write him this lawe repeated in a booke, by the Priestes of the Leuites. And now by Solomon hee instructeth them, saying, It is an abhomination vnto Kings, to commit wickednes, &c. For Solomon doeth not pronounce that which the Lordes of the earth daily doe, as experience doeth shewe it from al ages, for the most parte they haue bin & are giuen to great vngentlenes & cruel∣tie: but he sheweth them what they must do for to be truely kings, and strongly to stablish their kingdome, for to reigne and to rule in peace, not only of this world, but in ioy and rest of conscience. First of al, hee woulde haue the Kings and Rulers of the earth to abhorre wickednesse: that is, forasmuche as they are Lieutenantes of the holie and pure God, which hateth al wickednesse, they ought to esteeme themselues abhominable, and to be displeased with them¦selues, if they bee turned backe from purenesse and holinesse, and if they shoulde bee giuen to thinke, say or doe, any wicked thing: so that they might say with Dauid, I abhorre al the wayes of false∣hood. Againe, And I hate al false wayes. The Lorde would haue Ps. 119. 104. &. 128. 163. Amos. 5. 15 vs doe so: I hate falsehoode and abhorre it, but thy lawe doe I
loue, that is to hate the euil, and loue the good. And because that men refuse to obey him, hee vseth great threateninges and com∣plaintes, and against the Rulers of the worlde. Nowe as the Kings Psal. 2. 2. & 82. 2. Esai. 1. 22. 23. ought to abhorre to bee giuen vnto wickednesse: euen so ought they to counte their subiectes which commit wickednesse, and wil not cease, but doe delight to passe their time therein, and hate them which labour to withdrawe them from it, and ought to shew forth indeede that they hate and abhorre them. The which they shal doe, if they ridde both their houses and countries of suche people, in punishing and rooting them out as they deserue, & as God hath commaunded it. The which Dauid hath wel vnderstood: for this cause, for to giue a lesson vnto Kinges, hee maketh a goodly prote∣station. Some good Kings (but few in number) haue folowed Da∣uid: and so their throne was stablished for their time: as the histo∣ries Psal. 101. 2. do shew it: though some of them haue born off great stormes: as Dauid, Iosias, Ezechiel. Notwithstāding, because that in the feare of the Lord they haue bene turned away from wickednesse, and so much as they haue bene able, haue rooted it out of their dominion, and haue folowed righteousnes in gouerning both themselues and their subiectes rightly, they haue ouercome al dangers, and haue reigned in peace: and so they haue tried that to be true, which So∣lomon saieth, For the Throne is stablished by iustice. The which we must not vnderstande onely of Kinges, but also of al them which haue any authoritie, rule and gouernment: as of fathers and mo∣thers, of maisters and dames. This is yet not to say, that Kinges ab∣horring wickednes, shoulde tende to stablishe their throne, for to triumph and prosper after a worldly sorte, but for to serue the glo∣rie of God which doeth exalt them, and for to make their subiects liue in peace vnder the feare of the Lorde. And as Kinges haue here their lesson, euen so also haue closely the subiectes, which desire the prosperitie of their Kinges: that is, that it sufficeth not to crye, God saue the King, but wee must abstaine from al wickednes, and folowe righteousnes: otherwise wee procure the ouerthrowe of the Throne, 13 Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that speaketh right thinges.
Hee continueth stil in giuing instruction to Kings, and woulde haue that he should not delight to heare iesters, flatterers, liers, and slaunderers, and that they shoulde not suffer vnder them, corrupt Iudges and Magistrates, which pronounce either for hatred, or for fauour, for loue, or for accepting of persons, false iudgements, and wicked sentences, and harde ordinances: but that they shoulde haue about them, and intertaine in their houses and Courtes graue men, wise & faithful men, and that they shoulde delight and reioyce in the wordes of their lippes and mouthes which are very profitable and necessarie: for of such men yee shal heare nothing but iust and righteous words, according as their hearts and mindes are directed: and that in their countries & dominions & Lordships, they should be careful to place such Iudges, Magistrates and Officers, not proui∣ding officers for men, but offices of fit & sufficiēt persons, for to ex∣ercise rightly the iudgements of God, & to pronounce right things and sentences, and to make iust and righteous ordinaunces for to guide and to mainteine the people committed vnto them, in true religion, in the feare of the Lord, and in the reuerence of his word, by the which their subiectes doe learne to liue in peace and loue. 14 The wrath of a King is as messengers of death: but a wise man wil pacifie it. Solomon doeth not heere teach Kings and Rulers of the earth to be furious and cruel, as was Pharao towardes the children of Is∣rael: Saule towardes Dauid, and towardes Abimelech the Priest in 1. Sam. 22. 16. Dan. 3. 19. & 6. 16. Exo. 2. 12. & 32. 27. Rom. 13. 4. 1. Pet. 2. 14 Nob: Nabuchadnezer towards Sidracke, Misacke, & Abednago, and towardes Daniel: Herod towardes Saint Iohn Baptist: & as are now the great Lordes of the earth towardes the faithful: Hee also doeth not reprooue their wrath, which they ought to vse against the wicked, as did Moses smiting the Egyptian: and against three thousande men: Iosua against the inhabitants of the lande of pro∣mise: and as al Rulers ought to doe against Rebelles: But when hee compareth the wrath of Kinges vnto messengers of death, hee sheweth first of al, that the Kinges ought not to be merciful & gen∣tle towards the wicked, as was Elie towards his childrē, & as rulers 1. Sam. 2. 23.
commonly: wherevpon is come to passe as it is saide, The rent ga∣therers haue spared the Crowes & pardoned them: but they afflict and torment the pigions: and also the great theeues do escape, & the litle picke purses are hanged: but they must do iustice in wrath, and not let the wicked escape from their hands without punishment for that they haue deserued: Let the Kings be careful & diligēt to wea∣ken the wicked, & to take from thē al resistance, & that they may Rom. 13. 4. haue no power to be reuenged: as Solomon doth wel teach it, when he is not contented to say, the messenger of death singularly: but in the plural number, as Messengers. For a man which hath but a litle heart, wil not suffer himselfe to bee beaten of a man alone, but if diuers doe assayle him, howe valiant soeuer hee is, hee can not with stande, neither wil he trie to reuenge himselfe. Secondly, hee sheweth to the subiectes, that forasmuch as death is naturally fear∣ful, therefore they ought to feare for committing any fault, wherby they shoulde prouoke the wrath of their Superiours against them. And not onely so: but also that they ought to labour to quiet the wrath of their superiors, though they haue not prouoked it through their fault. And to doe it wel, they must be wise: as Solomon doth signifie here, when hee saith, But a wise man wil pacifie it. Hee sheweth also to Kings what kinde of people they ought to haue a∣bout them, & to whom they must giue eare, for to beleeue & folow their counsels. Furthermore, forasmuch as the wise do pacifie wrath, it foloweth, that fooles doe stil mainteine it. Nowe the wisedome which we must vse for to pacifie wrath and anger of Kings, is to be Rom. 13. 1. giuen to doe wel, and to giue them the honour and obedience that we owe them. I say expresly, that wee owe them: for wee must not seeke the fauour of Kings by vnlawful meanes, as doe flatterers: but we must rather sustaine and suffer the wrath of Kings, then to com∣mit any thing that is against wisedome, which is taught vs by the worde, in folowing the custome and patience of Sidracke, Misacke and Abednago: for wee must rather obey God, and honour and re∣uerence him, then men how great soeuer they be. 15 In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fa∣uour is as a cloud of the latter raine.
As in the first parte of the former sentence hee hath shewed to kings and rulers of the earth, what they ought to bee towardes the wicked, euen so in this sentence hee sheweth howe they shoulde behaue themselues towardes the good, that is, that they should be so sweete, so gentle, so gracious & fauourable, that the good should feele themselues quickned, and restored & preserued from hurt and detriment, from mole station and trouble, from ruine and destructi∣on, and that they shoulde not liue in sorrowe and languishing, but florishingly & in their prosperitie, and to be in peace and rest, in ioy and pleasure. Solomon signifieth these things by the light of the kinges countenance, wherevnto hee attributeth life, of the which wee make little account, but thinke to bee in death, except wee in∣ioy the former blessings: for as by night in darkenesse though wee liue, yet if they shoulde continue, and that we had no day, but were depriued from the brightnesse of the Sunne, wee shoulde pyne a∣way, and thinke ourselues miserable, and had muc ther die, and also wee cal such a life a very death: euen so when the good and simple, the righteous, and innocent, haue straight and sharpe, cruel, and tyrannous rulers, because that vnder suche rulers they are il handeled, though they liue: yet for the miseries, wronges and vio∣lences which they suffer, they languish and pine away, and are as it were in death. Contrarily, as when the Sunne shineth, and that wee haue the fruition of his brightnesse, we liue in ioy and delight: euen so when princes doe shewe vnto the good, their fauour and gentlenesse, they are at ease, and leade a ioyfullife. Hee signifieth al∣so these thinges, by his fauour: the which hee compareth vnto a cloude of latter raine. For as such a raine doeth ripen the corne, and refresheth the reapers, and maketh them glad, keeping them from thirst: euen so the fauour of kings, is very pleasant and profitable vn∣to the good and innocent. 16 Howe much better is it to get wisedome then golde? and to get vnderstanding, is more too bee desired then siluer. When wee followe our natural inclination, which is corrupted and vitious, we thinke we proceede rightly, and that wee tende to
make our profite for to keepe vs from hurt, and to mainteine vs in good estate. Now our nature doth leade vs after couetousnesse: for when we yeelde vnto it, we praise aboue al thinges the worldly and temporall riches, and doe nothing esteeme whatsoeuer wee thinke to stoppe vs, from atteining vnto the fruition & possession of them, we turne our backes to God, we despise al religion, we forget al charitie, wee forsake all faithfulnesse and trueth: wee make ourselues beleeue that in this maner wee shal greatly profite, and that we shal builde a faire house, and that wee shal gather riches for to liue in honour, and reputation, for to enioy our ease and worldly pleasures, and to Pro. 2. 1. & 3. 13. & 4. 4. & 8. 10. bee in ioy, and at rest, and that thus wee may liue a long time, and in good estate, and great prosperitie. But in this opinion wee are de∣ceiued: as Solomon doeth shewe vs. And not content herewith, hee reiterateth and repeateth againe the same woordes, when hee saith, Howe much better, &c. Hee vseth repetitions, knowing what is the nature of man, and that it cannot but very hardly bee changed. And the time is but lost that is bestowed about many: for the couetous where with the worlde is filled, hearing these wordes, doe nothing but mocke thereat, and doe preferre the goods of the worlde, before al spiritual graces, yea euen God: and haue no other God but their riches: albeit that with mouth and ceremonies of great apparance, they make profession to knowe God. And as they doe, so doe they teache their children, to doe the like. The coue∣tous are not alone which despise this instruction, but with them, are those which haue their heartes more giuen vnto worldly and carnall thinges, then to GOD: as are the ambitious and vo∣luptuous. 17 The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his soule, that keepeth his way. There is none but naturally doeth think himselfe righteous: and euen the dissolute and wanton, the most wicked and vngodly, are the most hardie to boast themselues that they are honest men.
And because they are so arrogant and presumptuous, therefore they are honest men. But because they are so arrogant and presump∣tuous, they wel deserue to bee reprooued, and to bee disprooued, and to bee saide vnto, Your wicked life which is giuen vnto euill, and therein doeth delight, is a very true argument that there is no righteousnesse in you. Solomon doth wel shew this same close∣ly, when he saith, The path, &c. therewith he giueth vs a certaine proofe for to assure vs whether wee be righteous or no: to wit, if our conuersation and manners are suche indeede, as that wee flie backe from al wickednesse. To helpe vs heerein, wee haue neede of Pro. 4. 26. 27 & 8. 13. & 14. 2. 16. Psal. 34. 13. the feare of the Lorde and of wisedome, as Solomon hath shewed heeretofore. And therefore because it is not enough to walke wise∣ly, in the feare of the Lorde, and to desist from euil, as Dauid doeth teach it, promising the same, when hee addeth, And hee that kee∣peth his soule &c. And sheweth that wee ought to giue our¦selues vnto goodnesse, when he speaketh of keeping his way. The which cannot bee doone but by resisting euil with goodnesse. 18 Pride goeth before destruction, and an high minde be∣fore the fall. There is none which desireth or wisheth his destruction, and ouerthrowe: but wee al tende vnto the conuersation and mainte∣nance of ourselues, and of our goods. And to doe the same, wee are all blinde, and cannot tel howe wee shoulde proceede therein, except wee bee guided by their worde: for after our humane and carnall sense, we are led for to magnifie and praise ourselues, and wee think that in this manner wee shal doe our businesse wel, and that we shal prosper. But following such an opinion and fantasie, and holding such trade we deceiue ourselues: for in steed of prospering, we go to destruction & decay. Solomon doth so declare it vnto vs, when hee saith, Pride goeth, &c. Adā hath wel proued it, when he tooke vpon himselfe so muche that hee woulde be like vnto GOD, for to knowe both good and euil, to the ende that hee might make his worke and businesse to prosper, in steede of being like vnto GOD,
hee made himselfe the slaue of the Diuel: in steed of prospering, hee sought his woe, and hath brought both himselfe and all his posteri∣tie to destruction. Wee might bring innumerable persons which haue prooued that pride goeth before destruction, as Solomon doth pronounce, not once, but twise: for hee addeth, and an high mind, &c. Hee vseth Repetition, the which serueth better to imprint the doctrine in our mindes and vnderstanding, and that wee should bee lesse excusable, if wee doe not make our profite of the doctrine, And also wee are taught, that the holy Ghost is very diligent and careful to teache vs. Therefore let vs not despise this diligence and care: and forasmuch as wee desire to auoide destruction, let vs take heede to flie pride, the which lyeth not onely in our outwarde con∣uersation, but chiefly in the inwarde affections: as Solomon doeth shewe it, when hee calleth it an high minde. An high, braue, and magnifical conuersation, is not properly pride, but the fruite there∣of. Therefore to flie pride, let vs refourme our affections, and let vs not onely become of an humble and lowly behauiour, but chiefly of an humble minde. Thus doing, wee shal not be beaten downe, but raised vp: for whosoeuer humbleth himselfe, shalbe exalted, not Mat. 11. 29. Phi. 2. 3. 1. Pet. 5. 5. of men, but by God, and so the exaltation shalbe eternal. And for∣asmuch as pride doeth goe before destruction, if wee bee constrai∣ned to suffer some destruction, let vs confesse wee haue not walked in humilitie, but that pride hath takē & beaten vs down. Therfore let vs think that they are our owne cogitations & affections which destroy vs, and not the visible aduersaries, nor the accidens which happen without hauing forseene them. 19 Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the spoiles with the proude. It is farre better to submit ourselues willingly vnto the yoke of the Lorde, and to beare the crosse, patiently to suffer al afflictions with the people and children of God in acknowledging and confes∣sing our faultes and sinnes, than to possesse abundance of temporal riches, and to bee partakers with the proude and high minded. In this sort, wee shalbee companions and felowes of Abraham and other Patriarkes, of Moses, of the Prophetes, made like vnto Iesus
Christ, and followers of the Apostles. The Crosse and afflictions are signified vnto vs by an humble minde. And to the ende that when they come wee may followe this admonition, Dearely belo∣ued, thinke it not strange concerning the firy tryal, which is among you, to prooue you, as though some strange thing were come vnto 1. Pet. 4. 12. you. Solomon doeth shewe vs that wee are not alone, but that we haue some, whose example wee may follow and learne, when hee saith, with the lowly. And therewith hee woulde haue vs to haue compassion of the afflicted, ready to suffer all kinde of affliction with them, in folowing the Hebrewes. To whom the Apostle giueth wit∣nesse, Heb. 10. 32. Call to minde the dayes that are past, in the which, after yee had receiued light, yee indured a great fight in afflictions &c. The possession of great riches, is signified by diuiding the spoiles with the proude. Wherein is marked the euil conscience and also the vio∣lence of the proude, and heere is shewed vs that they are so proude and arrogant, that they permit themselues to liue of spoile, and haue no pitie of the affliction of the humble. Of such presumption fol∣loweth destruction: and contrarily, forasmuche as God accepteth an humble minde, there followeth restoring & life for euer. Let vs then conclude, that it is better to be of an humble minde with the lowly, then to diuide the spoyles with the proude. 20 Hee that is wise in his businesse, shall finde good: and hee that trusteth in the Lord, he is blessed. Albeit that wee must referre ourselues altogether vnto the pro∣uidence of God, and that we can haue nothing but thereby, and that wee must haue al things of his hande, and that nothing doeth come to vs but by the pure grace & liberality of our God, without being Pro. 10. 22. Psa. 37. 3. & 127. 1. lawful for vs to thinke or say, that wee may obteine some thing by our wisedome and cunning, by our care and labour, for it is the bles∣sing of the Lorde which maketh men riche, for this cause also Dauid doeth admonishe vs, Trust thou in the Lorde, &c. Except the Lord builde the house, their labour is but lost that builde it: yet this is not to say, that wee must bee slouthful, and not to doe something looking that God shoulde feede vs. Euen before that man had sinned, God put him into the garden of Eden for to dresse it, and to
keepe it, and after his fal and offence hee laide paine vpon him, and woulde that man shoulde eate his breade in the sweate of his face: Gen. 2. 15. & 3. 17 Psal. 128. 2. And Dauid alloweth greatly trauel and labour. And wee see that men neuer ceasse to worke in the worlde, and still to spend the time in working for to feede both men and beastes: and yet, wee must confesse that God prouideth for al, and feedeth them, and main∣teineth them. Our Lorde doth teache it vs, commanding vs to aske our daily bread of God, in saying, Giue vs this day our daily bread: & forasmuch as he forbideth vs to care for clothes or foode: there∣fore Psal. 104. 14. 15. 27. 28 Mat. 6. 11. 25. let vs awaite vpon the prouidence of God, and let vs wholy de∣pende therevpon, and not in slouth, and idlenesse: for in so doing, wee shalbe worthie to want: but let vs bee occupied in care and diligence euery one after his vocation, committing our worke vn∣to the Lord, and he will make that our labour shall not bee vnfruit∣ful, but shal bring profite according as it hath beene woont in time Pro. 6. 10. 11. & 10. 4. & 13. 4. past, and as he hath promised to the children of Israel, by Moses and by his Prophets: and also experience teacheth it. For this cause So∣lomon douteth not to say, that hee which is wise and diligent in his businesse, shal finde good: as he hath saide. And when he admoni∣sheth vs to waite vpon the prouidence of God, saying, And hee Pro. 10. 3. 4 5. & 12. 11. that trusteth in the Lorde, he is blessed. And sith that wee must worke, we must not looke vnto our cunning and labour, but must assure ourselues of the goodnesse of the Lorde, being certified that he wil make our worke to prosper enough, for to mainteine & feed both vs & our family, so much as shalbe necessary for vs: he wil do this first of al in this worlde, and finally wil cause vs to finde euerla∣sting riches in the kingdome of heauen: as Solomon doeth signifie, calling him blessed which trusteth in the Lorde: for if God did vs but good heere in this worlde, wee should be in like degree, either with the beastes or with the wicked: and so we should not be bles∣sed. And also the trust that the faithful haue in the Lorde, ought not to be staied vpon things of this world, where wee haue no abiding citie, but ought to bee lifted vp, aboue al heauens, wee must follow the faith of our father Abraham and of other holy Patriarkes. Nowe forasmuche as in working wee must trust in the Lorde, and Heb. 11. 9 we cannot do it, except wee giue our heartes vnto his worde, the
which doeth shewe vs what wee haue to doe, and doeth guide and leade vs in whatsoeuer wee haue to doe, therefore it followeth that the worde of the Lorde is chiefe part of our worke. And also the worde that we haue expounded, businesse, signifieth, word: after the which signification, wee might giue an other sense vnto this sen∣tence, and say, hee that is attentiue vnto the worde, shal find good. This sense heere is diuers and not contrary, but true agreeing vnto the promises that God hath made to them which shal submit them¦selues vnto his worde, by faith and repentance. Moreouer, sith that in working wee must trust in God, being certified that hee wil not deceiue vs, but wil fulfil his promise, making vs to finde good, and blessing vs, it followeth that we are taught howe wee shoulde fol∣lowe the faithfulnesse of our God, and in no wise to labour too dis∣guise and counterfaite our businesse and our worke, for to beguile and deceiue our neighbours, otherwise wee shoulde not haue our trust in the Lorde, but in deceit, whereby wee might draw the sub∣stance of our neighbours vnto vs, and in this manner we should de∣serue that our labour shoulde perish in smoke, and that wee shoulde want al goods. Therefore if wee wil be partakers of the promises conteined in this sentence, let vs proceede in doing of our worke and businesse with al fidelitie and trueth, following the counsel of Dauid; Put not your trust in oppressiō nor in robbery: be not vaine: Psal. 62. 10. If riches increase, set not your heart theron. Finally, let vs note that Solomon doeth not attribute riches vnto workes, but vnto faith: though goods doe followe workes. 21 The wise in heart shalbe called prudent: and the sweet∣nesse of the lippes shall increase doctrine. Wee finde very fewe people which delight to bee esteemed or called fooles, ignorant or blockish, but al desire to bee praised and commended as wise, learned, and discrete. Nowe for to obteine this reputation and praise, wee labour to doe or say some thinges which are esteemed of the worlde, and which doe rauishe the mindes of men into admiration and woonderment for the new∣nesse and strangenesse thereof, or for the faire shewe, or temporal
profite that is receiued of it, or is loked of it. In the meane while God is forgotten, and his worde despised, the which onely is our true wisdome and prudence, when our hearte is set therevpon, when we truely loue it, and that with a sounde and perfect affection, wee frame our manners after that which it teacheth vs. If wee vse our¦selues thus, God wil giue vs this grace, that for the wisdome of our heartes, we shal obteine reputation and praise of prudence and vn∣derstanding: Solomon doeth signifie it, when hee saith, The wise in heart shalbe called prudent. And because that some might haue asked, whereby shal wee knowe a wise man in heart, that we may truely call him prudent or learned: seeing that man seeth but the face, and there is none but God which knoweth and searcheth the heartes: I answere, that the wisedome of the hearte is shewed foorth in the lippes, and sweete and gentle wordes, by exhorting our neighbours to learne, and giueth them a desire to growe and in∣crease in doctrine, and to become more and more learned. Solomon doth giue it vs so to vnderstande, when he saith, and the sweetnesse of the lippes shal increase doctrine. Heere hee nameth nothing but the lips, because they are the organes & instrumentes, by the which the worde of God is communicated vnto vs, the which is our wise∣dome and vnderstanding. And yet vnder the sweetnesse of the lippes, hee leaueth not to comprehende al actions and kindes of do∣ings, whereto wee are led by loue, for to bee a good example vnto our neighbours, and to giue them instruction, not onely by worde of mouth, but also by conuersation of life. For it is not enough that our lippes shoulde preache, but also al our life. Beholde, this is the sweetenesse, whereby wee must exhort our neighbours too receiue doctrine more and more, shewing vnto them the wisedome of our heartes, that to the glory of God, and profite of our neighbours, we may bee praised and commended as prudent. Notwithstanding we must take heede of the sweetnesse of false Prophetes and lying Tea∣chers, Rom. 16. 17. 18. that wee bee not deceiued and beguiled aswel by their words, as by their workes. 22 Vnderstanding is a well spring of life vnto them that haue it: and the instruction of fooles, is folly.
When we are greatly a thirst, wee desire very earnestly to finde some good and cleere fountaine, that wee may drinke thereof, and slake our thirst. Nowe wee are al naturally dry with blindnesse, ig∣norance, vanitie, and with follie, through which wee faint, and do miserably dye, except wee bee succoured. And because wee desire life, and cannot tel where to finde it, and yet wee haue greate neede of it: for this cause Solomon wishing our good, hath here∣tofore Pro. 2. 1. & 3. 13. & 4. 1. & 20. & 28. 35. &. 9. 11. exhorted vs vnto wisedome, knowledge and vnderstanding, and hath promised vs that there wee shal finde it. And not content heerewith, nowe hee maketh vs the same promise, when hee saith, Ʋnderstanding is a well spring of life, vnto them that haue it. Wherein hee sheweth vs that wee ought to bee very careful and diligent to reade the scriptures, to folowe good and true Doctours, to loue their doctrine, and to imprint and graue it in our heartes, that it may there take such deepe rooting, that wee may be alwaies seasoned, and may neuer bee depriued thereof: thus doing wee shal finde the spring of life, for to guide vs vnto immortalitie. And that this spring may not faile nor dry in vs, let vs continewe stil drinking of this water, without drunkennesse, and let vs not runne hither and thither by curiousnesse, for to heare newe thinges, and which haue greate apparance of wisedome: for if wee turne backe from this vnderstanding, wee can learne nothing but foolishnesse: for∣asmuch as, the heart of fooles babbleth out follie: and nowe hee saith, Pro. 12. 23. And the instruction of fooles is follie. And as the fooles can teache nothing but follie, euen so can they not abide to bee instru∣cted, to bee exhorted, admonished, corrected, and reprooued by the woorde of the Lorde: but for al instruction, they desire to heare of pleasant things to the flesh and lustes of things which haue a great outwarde shewe of wisedome after the worlde, of vaine and fri∣uolous things, of foule & slanderous things which are nothing else but foolishnesse, the which doeth so change and drye our soules that they perishe, and runne vnto eternal death for them. Solo∣mō doth giue vs so to vnderstand, when against the spring of life, he setteth follie: for speaking of life, he would not haue vs to stay about this present life, which is common both to al men and to beasts: but
he laboureth for to make vs to aspire vnto that blessed life, which neuer shal haue end. Now sith that follie is set against this spring of life, it foloweth wel that it is no light vanitie, wherewith also the faythful are stayned: but because they are truely displeased there∣with, therefore the Lorde will not impute it vnto them. But folly is a filthines which greatly defileth the fooles, with the which they are not displeased, but doe take their pleasure therin, and are so sore changed thereinto, that they perishe eternally and as many as doe folowe them. 23 The heart of the wise guideth his mouth wisely, and ad∣deth doctrine to his lippes. For want of hauing wisedome surely printed in our heartes, we are naturally inclined to speake at aduenture, neither doe wee make any account to take heede for to speake well. For this cause if wee bee reprooued for speaking euill, and that wee can not deny it, wee excuse ourselues to haue spoken it without thinking to speake it. This excuse shoulde be true, if wee did adde this woord well: say∣ing that we haue spoken euil, without wel thinking of that which we shoulde haue sayde. We cannot speake without thinking: for first of al if we speake ioyfully, it is because we delight therein, and that our heart taketh pleasure so to doe: And if wee speake anger∣ly or sorowfully, it is because that we are troubled in our heartes, for the matter whereof we speake. Secondly wee must not belye the infallible trueth, the which sayth, that from the abundance of Mat. 12. 34. the hearte the mouth speaketh. Solomon hath wel shewed vs, that some doe speake at aduenture and euil also, through want of wise∣dome, Pro. 10. 8. 13. 14. 20. 21. & 15. 2. because he hath attributed it to the same. Hee doeth shew vs the same nowe also, when he saith, The heart of the wise guideth his mouth wisely. &c. Hee sayth not simply and onely the heart, but he addeth of the wise: for the heart alone of it selfe is nothing woorth: whervpon foloweth that it can do nothing that is ought woorth. It must be reformed by wisdome, for to guyde our mouthes well and prudently. If then wee bee voyde of wisedome, wee cannot speake as we ought, but where wisedome is, there shalbee
a good woorde: as Solomon doeth declare the same, when hee addeth, And addeth doctrine to his lips. That is to say, that the hart of the wise doth teach his lips how they ought to be opened for to speake wel: or that the hearte of the wise by his lippes teacheth other, and giueth them doctrine. These twoo senses are diuers, but they a∣gree wel together: for a wise man also doeth them both, and the se∣cond is not without the first. 24 Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: sweetenes to the soule, and health to the bones. The fleshe reioyceth and is pleased, when a man is praysed and flattered: it alloweth well of the woordes that are vttered: as hee thinketh none coulde speake better to him, nor vtter any thing which should please him more, but howe long soeuer it be, they which listen and giue their eares vnto such prayses and, flatteringes shall feele that insteede they thought to eate honie, they haue ea∣tengal: and that in steede of drinking some sweete liquor, they haue drunken vinegre: and insteede of hauing health, they haue beene ta∣ken with death: As Adam and Eue which beleeued the serpent, as Roboam which beleeued his yong counsellers, and as the children of Israel which cleaued vnto the false Prophets which preached to them peace, when the Prophets of God did foretel them the greate miseries and calamities that were at hand. Solomon also doeth Pro.. 5. 3. 4. giue it vs to vnderstand. The Papistes also shall feele what the woordes and preaching of their Friers are. I haue sayde expresly, that the fleshe and sensualitie doeth wel allowe of flattering words and not that they are so indeed. Solomon doeth well shewe it, when he doth giue vnto fayre woordes three titles, which agree with the woordes of God. The first is, that they are likened vnto the honie combe, the second, that they are sweete vnto the soule: the thirde that they are health vnto the bones. For that which is proper vn∣to the woorde of the Lorde, cannot agree with the woordes which come both from the diuel & the flesh: and it were a great blasphemy
to attribut vnto them such fayrenes. Nowe that these titles belong vnto the woordes of God, the Scripture doeth shewe vs. The lawe Psa. 19. 7. & 119. 103. Pro. 4. 20. 21 22. of the Lord is perfit conuerting the soule. &c. Howe sweete are thy promises vnto my mouth! yea more then hony vnto my mouth. Wee will not then say with the worldlinges, O howe wel is that spoken, when men talke of matters pleasant to the flesh: albeit that the woordes seeme to be of God and spoken of deuotion True it is that the gracious and gentle woordes of freendes are very fayre, and are profitable as well to the soule as to the bodie, when by them we proceede as God teacheth vs by his woorde, and not when some haue respect onely to please men, and to winne their fa∣uour and good will. 25 There is a way that seemeth right vnto man: but the yssue thereof are the waies of death. As it is not without cause, nor vnprofitable, that Solomon repeateth the sentence woorde for woorde, that hee set in the fourteenth chapter and twelfth verse: Euen so ought wee to bee carefull to meditate the same, and therein to beholde our corrupt nature, which followeth his fantasie and good intent, turning away from the path that GOD teacheth vs by his woorde, also to beholde therein our destruction, that wee may labour to auoyde it. 26 The person that trauelleth, trauelleth for himselfe, for his mouth craueth it of him. There is none except he be impudent, or blockish, which doth deny that wee must beare the yoke of the Lorde willingly, yet do we al naturally deny it not by woord, but indeede. For God hath layde payne, labour, and trauell vppon our backes, and yet wee loue rest, ydlenes, & slouthfulnes: as wee are conuinced by our consci∣ence, and the rich worldlinges doe shew it, when they liue after the pleasure of their fleshe, making themselues beleeue that it is laweful for them to take their ease, delightes and pleasures without applying themselues too some honest and profitable vocation:
for because that they haue abundance of goods, for to liue with∣out doing ought, they would thinke it too vile and bace a thing for their maistership and worship, to set hande to woorke, or to giue themselues to some vocation, wherin they might get some mony, or serue their neighbours. Al that serue, and are hired either for a yeere, or from day to day, and doe not their worke so carefully and faithfully in the absence of their Maisters, as in their presence, either bee it in presence or in absence doe make no account to doe their worke wel, do also shewe it. And albeit that diuers, euen of those which are not taught in the worde of God, bee very earnest and stoute at their worke, yet is it not to say that they worke willingly, but it is because they loue themselues, and desire to gaine something for their profit. Solomon doeth signifie it, saying, The person or soule that trauaileth, &c. Or, that most commonly, they feare to haue nothing put in their mouthes and to eate. The reason that So∣lomon giueth, doeth shewe it, when hee sayeth, for his mouth cra∣ueth it. He sheweth that it commeth not of a franke and free hart, nor by charitie, that they are giuen to worke: but that they haue re∣gard to themselues, and feare to want. And thus Solomon doth not teache vs expresly what we haue to doe: but he doth shew vs what our nature is, and with what desire it is led, and what wee do com∣monly. And yet we must not thinke that he alloweth vs to doe that which he pronounceth heere, except that in labouring for ourselues we do also take care of our housholdes, and shewe compassion on Ephe. 4. 28. the needie and on the necessitie of the poore: and that folowing the admonition: let him that stole, steale no more, but let him rather la∣bour, with his handes the thing that is good, that hee may haue to giue vnto him that needeth. He therfore rebuketh the slouthful∣nesse of our nature, and therewith doeth somewhat shewe vs that hee which laboureth not, is worthy to dye for hunger: as Saint Paul declareth, for if any man wil not worke, let him also not eate. Some 2. Thes. 3. 10. do take heere trauaile for molestation, trouble and punishment: and do interprete this sentence, as if Solomon did say, The foule of man doeth forsake molestation: for his mouth giueth him occasion: that Mat. 12. 36. 37. is to say, That there happeneth great troubles vnto a man that spea∣keth rashly and without cause. This sense is true, and very agreeable Iam. 1. 26. & 3. 6. to the scriptures: it agreeth also with experience: notwithstanding it
is much constrained: and therefore wee wil receiue the first sense the which doeth teache vs that wee must not bee slouthful, but at the lest wee shoulde trauaile for to auoyde pouertie, I say, at the least: for that which ought chiefly to induce vs to trauaile is obedience that wee owe vnto our Lorde, and consequently the duetie that wee owe vnto our familie, and to our poore neighbors: For God hath no neede of our trauaile, nor of the profit that com∣meth thereof. 27 A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire. When a man ymagineth euil against his neighbour, that his wicked enterprise shoulde not bee knowne, and that he shoulde not bee let to atchieue the same, hee hydeth himselfe so much as he can, counterfayting an honest man, or at the very least dissembling that hee woulde euil to him whome hee watcheth: and yet in the most deepest and most secrete corner of his hart, hee looketh and deui∣seth by what meanes hee may ouerthrowe and destroy the simple and innocent, which doe thinke nothing of his trappes that the wicked hath prepared, no more then doth the wilde beastes thinke and know that hunters haue digged pittes for to make them to fal into them. Solomon doeth signifie this same, saying, A wicked man diggeth vp euil. Hee attributeth wickednesse and vngodlinesse, or, as some haue, no worthinesse to those which diuise euil, and conspire to ouerthrowe the simple and innocent, e∣uen God, if it were possible for them: as are they which bragge themselues to bee reformed after the Gospel, and say that they wil mainteine it: and yet haue no religion, and woulde gladly ouer∣throw and put downe the holy doctrine, and so consequently God, through hatred that they haue conceiued against his seruants. And whiles that these wicked and peruerse men, digge vp euil, labouring to destroy the holy doctrine, and al order and pollicie, and to bring al to confusion, if we rebuke them, then they cry that they are honest men, and are readie to make them repent which say the contrary, in miscalling and reuiling them, or vnder colour of iustice causing them to make amendes by restoring their good name. In these cryings and manner of doings they bely the holy Ghost, who by the mouth
of Solomon calleth them men of no estimation, and peruerse. But finally they shalbee prooued lyers with effect, which they shal not helpe: for they shal receiue their rewarde with their father & their God the Deuil, who is the father of lyes, & a murtherer frō the be∣ginning, whom they folow: for no thanke to them that the children of God be not murthered. Now albeit that sometimes, and for a while such kinde of people of no valour and wicked do secretly de∣uise in their hartes, or with their like in their dennes of theeues, or on their alebenche: yet they cannot alwayes holde out, but that at the last, by gestures, countenances, manners of doings and wordes, they wil declare their crueltie, and shew that they aske nothing but al destruction and desolation. Solomon doeth signifie it, when hee saith, That in his lippes is like burning fire. Their heartes are so ful of wicked ymaginations and enterprises, that they must needs spue out as drunkardes which haue drunke too much wine, euen til they burst. They cannot keepe themselues backe from committing of haynouse and cruel actes against those which cannot reuenge themselues, and to blowe out threatenings against them which de∣sire nothing but their good, and tel lyes, and vtter slaunderings, re∣uilings and shameful things against them which folowe trueth and are vnreprehensible before men. Solomon compareth these actes and woordes vnto a burning fire: for as the fire consumeth al that it meeteth with, except it be quenched: euen so men of no account, wicked and peruerse, woulde spoile and destroy by their power and violences, by their lyes and slaunderings, by their iniuries and reui∣lings, the good and innocent, if God did not bridle them: so that they worke not such desolation as they would, but such as GOD suffereth them. The wicked doe vexe and torment them∣selues greatly for to hurt other: as they wel knowe, and as also the worldlings doe confesse it: for they say they take more paine to doe euil then to doe wel. Solomon also signifieth their great trauaile, when he saith, That they digge, vp, and that there is a burning fire in their mouthes. And thus they are very miserable and woful, when they deuise euil for their neighbours. But if they remaine hardened and obstinate, and that they wil not conuerte from their wicked wayes, they shalbee yet much more woeful: for they shall
bee made voyde of their intentes, and the euil that they deuise to doe vnto others shal fal vpon themselues: as Caine, Pharao, Saule, Absalom, Iudas and other wicked doe nowe feele it: and the scrip∣ture doeth witnesse it, Beholde, hee trauaileth with mischiefe, hee hath conceiued sorowe, and brought foorth vngodlinesse: hee hath grauen and digged vp a pit and is fallen himselfe into the destructi∣on that he made for other. For his trauaile shal come vpon his owne Psal. 7. 15. & 9. 16. head, &c. If wee see this daily come to passe in the worlde, God is righteous, and though he be slow, yet the wicked, obstinate & hard∣harted shal not escape his hands. 28 A froward person soweth strife: and a taleteller maketh diuision among Princes. If we be not madde & furious, we do rather loue peace & vni∣tie, then dissention and warre: wherefore wee haue neede to seeke the meanes of peace, and to mainteine it and to fly those of warre, and to abhorre them. But there are some people so euil complexio∣ned, and so filled with malice, that they woulde haue men to thinke of them that they desire nothing but peace, whereas they tende to fil the world with braules and dissentions: for wheresoeuer they become, they labour to ouerthrowe al good order, al good coun∣sel, and lawful deliberations and ordinances, al good agreements, & louing pactions. Solomon calleth such malicious men, froward per∣sons: or persons of peruersities: & not of peruersity alone in the sin∣gular number: for they are not content to haue once brought some disorder, trouble or confusion, but they perseuer in exercising their peruersities, by the which they stirre vp dissentions, not in one place onely, but as hee which soweth, doeth not onely sowe one or twoo graines, but doeth cast al ouer the grounde that he hath plowed, & doeth couer it throughout from one end to the other, euen so the froward doe raise vp diuers dissentions, and no thanke to thē, that they fil not the worlde. Solomon doeth signifie this same, when hee saith, That a person of frowardnesses, soweth strife. And for to de∣clare vnto vs, of what peruersities, and of what strifes hee chiefly meaneth to speake, hee addeth, And a taleteller maketh diuision among Princes. By a frowarde person, or man of peruersenesse, hee
meaneth lyers, flatterers, sclaunderers, and house burners, which cease not to blow into the eares of princes, for to encourage them against other princes, their neighbours, and to make warres against them, whereas before they were quiet, and vnited together: and by strife he meaneth, the enimities, the hatreds, the troubles, & the warres which are stirred vp by the false tales of such peruerse men. Wherein he teacheth vnto princes of the earth, not to haue ytching eares, and that they should not be easie nor inclined to heare tale tellers, but that rather they shoulde hunt them away, yea roote them out as seditious and rebelles, and disturbers of the common wealth, and of common peace. Therefore let princes take heede to folowe the wisdome that Dauid doeth shewe them saying, I wil set no wicked thing before mine eyes, I hate the woorke of them that Psal. 101. . fal away. &c. Secondly, he teacheth vs that we should be careful too bridle our tongues, as also Saint Iames doeth admonish vs, saying, Let euery man be swift to heare, and slowe to speake. &c. Againe, if any man thinke himselfe religious among you, and refrayneth not Iam. 1. 19. 2. his tongue, but deceiueth his owne hearte, this mans religion is vayne. Thirdly forasmuch as wee loue, or should loue peace, there∣fore so much as in vs lyeth wee should be at peace with all men. Fur∣ther Solomon doeth admonish vs that we should not be frowarde nor tale tellers, according to the defence. Thou shalt not goe about Leui. 19. 2. amongest thy people as a backbiter. 29 A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good. If wee wil keepe ourselues from being deceiued and seduced, let vs not indifferently folowe al companies: let vs take heede of sinners. And to doe this wel, let vs apply our eares vnto wisedome, Pro. 1. 10. & 2. 2. 10. & 5. 1. for when wisedome shalbe entered into thy heart, then shall discre∣tion preserue thee. &c. Also he hath admonished vs to hearken vn∣to wisedome, for to keepe vs from the strange woman. &c. Nowe him that Solomon hath before called, sinner, wicked, a stranger, now he calleth him man of iniquitie, or man of violence: that is too say, which without doubt of conscience doeth hurte vntoo his neigh∣bours, and maketh as it were professiō thereof, for to induce others
to doe the like. Solomon saieth, that such a man, seduceth or de∣ceiueth his neighbour: and afterwardes he sheweth what the deceit is, when he saith, and leadeth him into the way which is not good. Wherein wee see that hee speaketh not of any light deceit, as to de∣ceiue his neighbour in drawing subtilly his goods vnto him, his la∣bour & his paine, euen as they are wont to do which desire to make their particular profit by the hurt of other: & for to doe this, they vse craftines & subtiltie, that we may take heede of them: but hee speaketh of a deceit greatly hurtful, seeing it draweth soules vnto perdition: for they must needs perishe which walke not in a good and safe way. The other deceit in comparison of this same is but light for those which suffer it: for it is nothing but a temporal mat∣ter, which is nothing to the soule: albeeit that they which vse it, shal not finde it light: for they doe it with the losse of their soules, seeing they are couetous, vsurers, theeues and robbers: but they which leade men into the way which is not good, are murtherers not only of the bodies, but also of soules: wherupon doeth folowe that the deceit that they vse shalbe very hurtful vnto them: for no murtherer hath eternal life dwelling in him. Wherfore we may vn∣derstand 1. Iohn. 3. 15 that almost al the world goeth vnto damnation: for it is ful of men of iniquitie, which deceiue some after one sorte, and some after another, in example of life and conuersation, and in wordes & doctrine. 30 He shutteth his eyes to deuise wickednesse, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to passe. Hee continueth stil in speaking of the wicked, vngodly, and fro∣ward, of whome he hath spoken in the three last sentences: and that we should be more careful & watchful to take heed and beware of them, he doth attribute vnto them certaine disguisings, which they vse when they ymagine euil, & that they labour to accomplishe it. Solomon doeth signifie it, By shutting his eyes, and moouing of the lippes. And this is very fitly, for when the wicked doe ymagine euil, they wil make as though they sawe them not against whome they intend mischiefe: or for better to betray them, they wil not looke vpon them with open eyes, shewing them that they are their open enemies, but wil shewe them a smiling countenance, with lyering
eyes. Euen so the wicked which woulde take their neighbours a vnwares, for to hurt them, without being able to keepe and saue themselues, they wil not crye out with a loude voice, saying, It is you whome wee malice: but for to deceiue better, they wil speake sweetly, as it were with a fained voice, and wil not but halfe open their mouthes. Likewise Solomon hath not said, hee openeth: but he moueth his lippes. Let vs also vnderstand that vnder these twoo signes Solomon comprehendeth al gestures and manner of doings which the wicked vse for to counterfaite, that they may deceiue & hurt more easily: for he hath studied to giue vs shorte sentences in wordes, but yet great in vnderstanding. They which haue any doo∣ings with the wicked, which faine and counterfaite, doe feele that they do not only close & shut their eyes, and that they do not on∣ly moue their lippes, but that they haue as it were an innumerable wayes of doing by the which they faine for to hurt openly. The De∣uil is a subtil Doctor: and as he hath diuers knackes in his budget, e∣uen so doth he teache them vnto his disciples for to make thē mai∣sters of art. Among the which they are not the worst which seeke our goods, and take away our good name, and hurt our bodies: but they are the worst which lye in waite to destroy our soules. 31 Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteousnesse. Albeit that men naturally desire to liue long in a flourishing state, of meane age, and to continew stil in the same power & strength, as we may know by old men, who lament their youth past, & gladly woulde that the youth had tenne or twentie of their yeeres: and haue no pleasure to thinke nor to heare speaking that they are old, except it be that for their age they thinke that they shal obteine some office, aboue and before the youth: yet for al this there is none but doeth desire to attaine vnto a very olde age: the which desire is not to bee blamed, so that it is not for feare of death, nor for doubt of what shalbecome of vs after this life, as doe the infidels and faithlesse: but let our desire beholde the promise that GOD Deut. 4. 4. & 5. 33. & 30. 16. hath made vnto them which shal obey his woorde: to witte, of prolonging their daies vpon earth. Likewise when a man hath liued
past seuentie or foure score yeeres, hee boasteth often of his olde age, and doeth reioyce therein, and hee looketh that some shoulde reuerence him, as a thing very honourable: euen as at al times, and amongst al peoples, it hath beene, except towardes wanton and shamelesse youths. For it is a natural and very reasonable thing, that folkes shoulde honour their elders: and also God doeth commande Leui. 19. 32. it. Nowe wel to obey this commandement, the youthes must behaue themselues towardes their elders, as children ought to be∣haue themselues towardes their fathers and mothers, and chiefly to folowe their counsel, so farre as they labour to leade vs accor∣ding as GOD teacheth them by his worde: otherwise age is no crowne of honour: euen as Solomon doeth signifie, when hee ad∣deth, When it is founde in the way of righteousnesse. It is not age then which maketh the olde man to bee crowned with glorie: as they which were destroied by the flood, haue wel shewed, and they of Sodome and Gomor, and other olde doaters filled with foolish∣nesse, ignorance and iniquitie: but it is wisedome which maketh the crowne glorious. Therefore if wee wil bee honorably crowned for our age, let vs not aske to bee praised for our great age, but let vs fo∣lowe that rightly which God requireth of vs, euery one of vs ac∣cording to the state wherein God hath called vs. Thus doing, though wee bee no old men, yet shal we haue age which shalbee a crowne of glory vnto vs. The scripture also speaking of the Elders, hath not respect to the age, but to their duetie & office, neither is it required that a man shoulde be olde in yeeres for to beare office, but in man∣ners. And forasmuch as the aged ought to be of more experience and more wise, that rightly they may gouerne others, therefore for this they which beare office either in the common wealth or in the Church, are called Elders: and although they bee young, yet if they behaue themselues as they ought, they haue age which is to them a crowne of glorie. Thus age doeth not make men honourable and glorious, but righteousnesse. 32 He that is slow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.
The mighty, or rather the hastie & furious, are esteemed very ex∣cellent, & winne great fame in the world: as we see, & also the ho∣ly scripture doth giue vs examples thereof. At this time were the gi∣ants Gene. 6. 4. & 10. 8. 91. dwelling on earth, Those were the mighty ones which in al a∣ges haue bin men of fame, Nemrod became mightie on earth, &c. And as such mightie men are esteemed, euen so do they also make account of themselues, & thinke they do profit, & that they are not cowards, but haue a couragious heart, because they suffer none to deuour them, but can soone deuoure others. Notwithstanding they which proceed with al gentlenes, humanitie, lenitie, modestie & cle∣mencie, & which suffer with al patience that rather other should do them iniurie, wrong & violence then to hurt any person, are coūted dizzards, cowards, & nothing worth, vnworthy once to talke with men of honestie, & worthy to be despised & reiected of al honest men, which wil suffer at no mans hand any molestation. This is the iudgemēt of the world: that is to say, of al those which are not made newe creatures by the regeneration and sanctification of the holy Ghost. But they which are lightened, sanctified & regenerated, doe iudge otherwise, & pronounce with Solomon, he that is slow to an∣ger, is better then the mighty. Here Solomon doth first set and pre∣ferre the slowe to anger, before him that is mightie: not for to con∣dēne the strong & mighty, except that through their force they take leaue to do iniurie & outrage to their neighbors without cause: the which cannot be done without anger, hatred, wrath & furie. And it is in this only point that the mightie ought to bee condemned, for strength is the gift of God, wherwith diuers of the elect & children of God haue bin indued, & haue vsed the same in anger & wrath a∣gainst the enemies of God, & his people: as Moses, Iosua, and other gouernours of the people of Israel: & as al the iudges & mighty ru∣lers ought to vse against thē which do euil. We wil then with Solo∣mon preferre the slow to anger, before him that is mightie, because that he is of great wisdom, whereby he can temperate his passions, and patiently beare the iniuries & outrages that are done to him, as he knoweth to be expedient: the which is no smal vertue: seing that Exo. 34. 6. Psa. 103. . Esa. 55. 7. Rom. 2. 4. in the same he is a folower of his God, of whome the scripture wit∣nesseth that hee is a God of pitie, of clemencie, and slow to wrath, &c. And as it is not for want of might that God is thus patient, as
hee can and coulde wel shewe taking vengeance of his enemies in conuenient time: euen so God doeth not take force for him that is slowe to wrath, but that hee may ouercome his enemies, when the time is come: whereas the mightie for his arrogancie is often depriued of his enterprises, and his violence lighteth vpon himselfe by the iust punishement of God. Loe this is the first cause why we esteeme the slowe to anger better then the mighty. Secondly, as the mighty which presumeth on his strength, doeth greatly hurte his neighbours by mouing strife: euen so contrarily, the slowe to anger doeth profite his neighbours, setting them at peace. Consequently, Prou. 15. 18. Solomon opposing and preferring him that ruleth his owne minde vnto him that winneth a citie. He doeth somewhat expounde what he meaneth by the slowe to anger and by the mightie: that is to say, that he is slowe to anger that suffereth not himselfe to be transported of his carnall affections, and humane and naturall passi∣ons which prouoke him to anger and wrath, vnto indignation and furie, to violence outrage and vengeance, but doeth rather subdue, tame and holde in subiection, and mortifie them. It is not without cause that Solomō setteth such a personage against him which con∣quereth townes: For he doeth no outrage, violence nor hurte, but onely to his vitious and corrupted nature, he maketh no warre but with himselfe, that is, that his fleshe or sensualitie, which lusteth against the Spirit, should not obteine his desires and affections: But he that taketh townes, doeth oftentimes make greate destru∣ction and desolation. Hee that ruleth his minde quencheth a greate fire: For naturally wee are al kindled, with wrath, with an∣ger, and with desire of vengeance: but hee that winneth cities, mainteineth his fire and kindleth it more and more, and by it hee lighteth another, burning castles and villages, yea cities and townes also. Hee that ruleth his minde is readie to doe good vnto them which trouble him without cause: But he that winneth townes, doeth wrong, and iniurie, outrage and violence, vnto inno∣centes. Now in these causes of comparison, we see plainly that Solomon doth rightly more cōmend him that ruleth his courage, thē him that taketh and winneth townes and cities. But besides these same
wee may adde, that hee which winneth cities, doeth suffer him∣selfe to be caried away of his passions and carnal affections, the which rule in him, and is not maister ouer them. The contrary is in him which ruleth his courage, as hath beene declared. Further∣more Iam. 3. 6. in the tongue is a fire, yea euen a worlde of wickednes: and in the tongue there is no euil, but that it commeth of the mind: ther∣fore it foloweth, that he which ruleth his minde, is more valiant thē he which winneth cities and townes: for he ruleth and conque∣reth a world. 33 The lot is cast into the lappe, but the whole disposition thereof is of the Lorde. For to part or to make choyce of any thing, is when men vse too cast the chaunce or lot, for to knowe what parte they shal haue, or who shalbe chosen. And it is not come vp of late, that this maner of doing is vsed, but from al antiquitie, and euen by the commaun∣dement of God among the children of Israel: the which comman∣dement they folowed. And the Apostles also vsed too cast lottes, Leuit. 16. 8. Num. 33. 54 Iosu. 14. & 15 Acts. 1. 26. Leui. 19. 31. & 20. 6. Deut. 18. 10 Wherevppon foloweth, that it is laweful to vse lotterie, so that there be no inchauntmentes, forceries and art magicke and diuelish practises, mingled therewith: which are abhominable before the Lord. And in vsing of lottes for the partitiō or election, we must take heed of the false & wicked opiniō of infidels, which attribute vn∣to fortune and chaunce, that which hapneth, and commeth to them by lot. For contrarily we must attribute to the counsel and proui∣dence of GOD, whatsoeuer wee obteine by lot, bee it muche be it litle, be it good, be it euil, be it that it pleaseth or displeaseth vs. Solomon doeth teache vs this same, when he saith, But the whole disposition thereof, is of the Lorde. Wherefore let vs bee readie to giue thankes vnto the Lord for al things that we obteine, euē those things which seeme wel to be very casual & set forth to fortune & chance: as are those which happen by lot, for the worldlings casting into the lotterie, are wont to say, come what may come. Likewise shal the children of God, if they take not heede and beware. Wee must bee assured that howesoeuer the lot bee cast, that nothing
can happen but by the prouidence of God, and that that must needs come to passe without changing, which God hath purposed and ordeined in his eternal counsel. It is therefore good reason that we committe al our affaires vnto him, beseeching him to guide them according to his good wil, and that wee content ourselues with that which shal happen to vs, and giue him thankes and praises therefore. Let vs then acknowledge and confesse that whatsoeuer commeth to vs by lot, the same is the gift of God, vpon such con∣dition that we shoulde bee faythful stewardes thereof. And though the lotteries be lawful in harde matters, yet thelesse that they are vsed the better it is. The xvii. Chapter. 1 BEtter is a dry morsel, if peace be with it, then an house ful of sacrifices with strife. WHen according to the law that God ordeined by Moses, they did sacri∣fice, & offered their oblations, the people did eate of the sacrifice, and therein neither the Leuite, stranger, Leui. 23. 40. Deut. 12. 7. & 14. 23. fatherlesse child, nor widow ought to be put by and left out. In such as∣semblies they made good cheere, they eate and dranke ynough and were filled: yet is it not to say, that such feastes were the best refreshing that they could inioy: for the goodnesse of the banket or feast did not stand in the abundance of meates, neither in the delicate and fine dressing thereof. Solomon doeth so shewe it. Therfore if we wil feede at a good banket, let the meates be seasoned with friendship and loue: let both the hoast or Pro. 15. 17. maister of the feast & the guest or friend, be good friends & louers togither, let there be peace betweene them without any strife. So∣lomon doeth signifie it nowe againe, when hee saieth, Better is a dry morsel, if peace bee with it, then an housefull of sacrifices.
by the dry morsel, hee meaneth a dinner that asketh not much cost for to dresse, and in the which wee liue soberly without excesse: If they which together at suche a banquet are freendes and louers together, their meale is better then are those bankettes, wherein is strife and debate, yea though that GOD hath ordeined suche ban∣kets: as Solomon doeth well signifie, when hee doeth cal them Sa∣crifices, wherewith the temple was filled, the which is signified by the house full of Sacrifices with strife. Strife and debate doe then defile that which God hath ordeined for his seruice, and for the vse and ioy of men, and for to leade them to sing him praises, and to giue him thankes. Wherefore let vs vnderstande that Solomon doeth commende peace vnto vs, and woulde haue vs to flie strife, for to liue easily, quietly, and pleasantly, and chiefly ac∣cording too our minde. The fine mouthes, gluttons and drunkardes cannot easily agree with Solomon, but rather will mocke him. 2 A discrete seruant shall haue rule ouer a lewde sonne, and hee shall deuide the beritage among the bre∣thren. The greatest part of the youth do thinke that they ought to doe nothing els but play, and take their ease and pleasures, and chiefly when they haue riche fathers, and are serued and obeied by their seruantes and houshold folkes, and also they think that they should bee serued aswel as the maister of the house, and are not long in wa∣sting the goods that their fathers and mothers, the seruants and housholde folkes haue gathered with paine and labour, with greate care and diligence, and labour to rule and gouerne, and to be feared and reuerenced. Now in this manner they magnifie them, and extol themselues, and doe promise to themselues great riches: but very often they fal very lowe, and are suppressed and humbled, and also are depri∣ued of their hope: for they doe not obteine the goods that they promise themselues, but others doe take them, at the least a good part of them. Solomon doeth shewe it vs, saying, A discrete ser∣uant shall haue rule ouer a lewde sonne: and hee shall deuide the
inheritance among the brethren. Heere Solomon doeth well shewe that God suppresseth and humbleth the proude younglinges euen to make them subiect vnto the most miserable after the world, and to those which should be their seruants and slaues: for these ser∣uants of whom Solomon speaketh, were of such conditiō, that they were bought & sold as beastes, & were so compelled to labour for those which had bought them, that they & their children, & what∣soeuer they did get, did appertaine and belong vnto their maisters, & vnto their posteritie & linage. Solomō doth not speak this with∣out experience: as hee doeth witnesse, I haue seene seruantes on horses, and princes walking as seruantes on the grounde. This Eccle. 10. 7. Gen. 14. was seene in Ioseph the sonne of Iacob. Nowe although that such seruantes, before the worlde, were miserable, vile and abiect, yet there were some of them which were not discouraged, but with good wil and right affection endeuoured what they could to please their maisters: as they are exhorted chief∣ly. And euen so must al they which serue for wages & reward do the like for the time that they serue and are hired: for they are, af∣ter a maner of saying, as it were bought for a time, and are bounde to yeelde subiection and obedience. Wherevnto if they bee giuen Ephe. 6. 5 Col. 3. 22. 1. Tim. 6. 1 Titus. 2. 9 1. Pet. 2. 18. carefully and faithfully, they are wise and discrete seruantes, and by their prudence they shalbee exalted, as out of the mire and dust vn∣to honour and glory, euen aboue the children of the house, which bring confusion: that is to say, which by their folly, falling away, & dissolution, doe set al in disorder, in making superfluous and ex∣cessiue expences. Wee may see this gouernment and ruling euen in this worlde: but it shalbee seene plainely in the last resurrection, when the sheepe shalbe receiued before the goates: for let vs not think that Solomon would haue vs onely to seeke worldly and tem∣porall honour. True it is, that hee speaketh of a temporal ruling whereat the children of God ought not to bee staied, but hope for the eternal, wherein they shal truely gouerne ouer the lewde chil∣dren. For they shal as it were treade them vnder their feet, when they shalbe exalted vnto the heauenly kingdome, & the lewde chil∣dren shal discende downe into hel and death eternal. And when Solomon saith, that the discrete seruant shall deuide the heri∣tage,
&c. Hee sheweth that God can wel tel howe to depriue the lewde children of their hope, & to worke that they shal not enioy the heritage. And therewith he also promiseth temporal welth vnto slaues: and in this, he would assure vs, that although we be the most miserable in the worlde to the sense of the fleshe and outwarde fight, yet shall wee not want riches: but if neede bee, GOD shall make vs equal in wealth, with the most richest. This same is wel signified by diuiding the heritage with the brethren: for after the Hebrue expositors, to diuide the heritage among brethren, is to take a portion of goods with those which are brethren, and to whome after the world goods do appertaine. But when wee hearesuch tem¦poral promises, let vs vnderstande that God wil not satisfie his dis∣crete and wise seruants, with riches which are common to fooles: and therefore, let them bee assured that the heauenly and eternal ri∣ches are theirs, and that they shal haue the possession of them by continuing in prudence & wisedome. Solomon hath shewed vs the same plainely. Contrarily, if God threaten the foolish and lewde, Pro. 3. 13. & 4. 5. to depriue them of their worldly wealth and honour: and make no account to amende themselues, wee must vnderstande that hee counteth them not worthie of the heauenly glory, and eter∣nal blessednesse. 3 As is the fining pot for siluer, and the fornace for golde: so the Lorde trieth the heartes. Saint Peter doeth admonishe vs, saying, Dearely belooued, thinke it not strange concerning the firie trial, which is among you, 1. Pet. 4. 12. to proue you, as though some strange thing thing were come vnto you. This trial ought in no wise to bee giuen vnto fortune. And though the Diuels and men bee organes and instrumentes for too trouble and torment vs, yet they doe not prooue vs, but it is God Iob. 1. Exo. 20. 20. Iob. 7. 18. Psal. 26. 2. & 66. 10 & 139. 1 that doeth it: As the Scripture sheweth it. Solomon following the same, saith, As is the fining pot for siluer, & the fornace for gold: &c. Wher∣in we haue to note, forasmuch as the trial of God is compared vnto the fining pot & fornace, that therefore it foloweth, that god trieth
our heartes by tribulation and afflictions, by miseries and calami∣ties: and that sometimes for one cause, and sometimes for another. For as by the Fornace, sometimes golde is purged and purified from his scumme, and from his filthinesse, and sometimes wee trie whe∣ther it be good, fine & lawful: euen so God also doth trie our harts in sending to vs afflictions, for to purifie them: for by temptations wee are admonished to confesse our faultes, and to aske par∣don: and thus wee are purged from our scumme and filthinesse. The Scripture doeth shewe vs that diuers saintes being vnder af∣fliction, haue confessed their faultes, and haue asked forgiuenesse, Num. 21. 7 1. Sam. 7. 5 & 12. 10. Psal. 106. 6 Esay. 59. 12. & 64. 5 Dan. 9. 5. Gen. 22. 1 Deut. 8. 2. Psal. 26. 2. &. 66. 9 & 139. 23. and also for those of their neighbours. Otherwise by afflictions and aduersities, GOD trieth our heartes, for too prooue their righteousnesse and perfectnesse, or to shewe foorth their wicked∣nesse and vngodlinesse. After this sort GOD tried Abraham, commanding him to sacrifice his sonne. Hee hath also prooued the children of Israel. Wherefore this sentence may serue to teache vs paciently to beare the afflictions that wee may suffer, knowing that it is God which layeth them vppon vs, for to purge and too cleanse vs, & to make vs wise and very discrete to walke vprightly: the which are two blessings greatly to bee desired. As also Dauid doeth wel shewe it when hee requireth to bee tried, and when hee woulde haue men to prayse the Lorde. And adding the reason, hee saith, O God thou hast proued: thou hast also tried vs, like as siluer is tried. Trie mee, O God, and seeke the grounde of my hearte: Prooue mee, and examine my thoughtes. Saint Iames also saith, Blessed is the man which indureth temptation: for when hee hath beene tried, hee shal receiue the crowne of life, Iam. 1. 2. which GOD hath promised vnto those which loue him. And when the Apostle Saint Peter sayth, That the prouing of your faith, being much more precious then golde that perisheth (though it be tryed with fire) might bee founde vnto your praise, and honour and glory, at the appearing of Iesus Christe. Therefore let vs willingly receiue the admonition of the Apostle: My sonne, despise not the chastening of the Lorde, neither fainte when thou art rebuked of him. For whome the Lorde loueth, hee Heb. 12. 5. 6. chasteneth: and hee scourgeth euery sonne which he receiueth.
Wee may learne this out thereof also, that we can neither doe, say, nor thinke any thing that GOD seeth not better then wee our¦selues: as hath beene shewed by the scripture. 4 The wicked giueth heede to false lippes: and a lyar hear∣keneth to the naughtie tongue. All men are ready and enclined naturally to hearken vntoo them which speake wickedly of other. Some are so delighted there∣with, that they thinke that they are wel thought of therefore, and perswade themselues that they are suche, and doe turne the rebuke that is giuen to their neighbours vntoo their owne praise and good commendation. Wherein they are deceiued: as Solomon doeth shewe, attributing vnto them wickednesse,, the which in this place is very fit and meete, chiefly to Princes & Lordes of the earth who worship themselues in their lordships, power and authoritie, and require for to bee worshipped. And as they delight to heare wickednesse spoken, as lying, slaundering, and false witnesse bearing for to helpe forwardes the destruction of their neighbours: euen so they themselues are lyars: as Solomon doeth pronounce, saying, And a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue, or tongue of de∣struction. Heere hee calleth him a lyar, whom before hee hath called wicked or naughtie. Wherein he sheweth of what naugh∣tinesse or wickednesse hee speaketh: that is to say, of lying. And thus hee accuseth the wicked not onely to giue eare vntoo them which lie wickedly, but also that he himselfe lieth: the which is no wonder: for euery man gladly reuerencech his like. Wee may see that the princes of the worlde doe loue wel to lye, they are no nig∣gardes of their promises: but they perfourme little or put nothing in execution, and doe delight in making them faire & goodly (as is saide) not onely in light thinges: but where by their leasinges men suffer most, there doe they laugh most of all. Wee doe also often see come to passe that the strifes of Princes doe bring great destruction. There are some which are no Princes, and yet labour to doe the like: so that on what side soeuer wee turne vs, wee meete with none but lyars: so full is the worlde of them. And therefore it is not
without cause that Dauid lamenteth. And euen of the people of God, it is saide, It is a people prouoking to wrath. Lying chil∣dren, Psa. 5. 10. & 12. 2. 3. Esay. 30. 9 & 57. 4. children which wil not heare the Lawe of their GOD. On whome haue yee iested? Vpon whome haue yee gaped, and thruste out your tongues? Are not yee rebellious children, and a false seede? And they bende theyr tongues like their bowes for lyes, &c. Hee also calleth destruction or naughtie, that which be∣fore Iere. 8. 6. & 9. 2. hee had called wicked. Wherein hee sheweth that the lyars, false witnesses, slaunderers and flatterers, are daungerous, and great∣ly hurtful: as also experience teacheth: for by their tales they doe stirre vp anger, malice, striefes, seditions, warres, whereby diuers houses and families, euen townes and regions doe come vnto de∣struction. But the worst destroyers, are those which set foorth diue∣lishe doctrine and mens traditions, in steede of the pure doctrine, or els doe mingle them one with another, colouring the trueth: for the destruction that they make is not of any temporal goods and bo∣dies, but they loose the soules and bodies for euer. And albeit that it is by deceit, trappes and vnder colour of religion, yet they which are deceiued: ceasse not to bee giltie: as Solomon doeth signifie, when he calleth them lyars which hearken vnto the naugh∣tie tongue, or tongue of destruction: and the Apostle S, Paul doeth 2. Thess. 2. 9. 10 shewe it. Furthermore let vs note, that in this place to hearken and to giue eare, is not to heare as passing by: for otherwise wee must at∣tribute wickednesse and lying, vnto those which are regenerate and sanctified by the Spirite of GOD: seeing they often heare lippes which speake iniquitie, and tongues which woorke destru∣ction, for the which cause they are afflicted, seeing that GOD is therein offended, and that their neighbours haue hurt thereby al∣so: and therefore they doe reprooue them sharpely: but to hear∣ken and to giue earo, is to hearken with the hearte and minde, and therein to delight. If then wee wil not bee called neither wic∣ked, nor lyars, let vs delight to heare the trueth, the which is ex∣empted from al wickednesse, and tendeth not to destruction, but to conseruation and righteousnesse.
5 Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at destruction, shall not be vnpunished. Al the worlde boasteth to honour God, and perswade them∣selues that they woulde in no wise displease him: for there is no motion so barbarous, nor so superstitious, and idolatrous, yea so corrupted and dissolute, so passing measure and vntemperate, which hath not some kinde of doing, by the which men thinke to serue God, yea euery mā particularly laboureth to gouern himself in such sort that none may thinke of him but that hee seeketh the honour of God, at the least wise, hee laboureth to persuade himselfe hee doeth so. And yet wee despise the stranger, the fatherles, the wi∣dowe and other needie and poore, yea, they are wronged and op∣pressed against the expresse ordinance of God, who hath comman∣ded, Thou shalt not doe iniurie to a stranger, neither oppresse him, Exo. 22. 21. 22. Leui. 19. 33. 35. for ye were strangers in the lande of Egypt. Ye shal not trouble any widowe, nor fatherles childe. Thus doing we do mocke the poore, with a mockage that is not light for to offende a man smally, but to doe God great dishonour. Solomon doeth signifie it, saying, Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him, &c. For∣asmuche as there is none but God that inricheth and maketh men poore, it foloweth, that wee doe reproch him when wee mocke the poore, in not helping him as they ought, & in doing him wrong, and in persecuting him, for hee is despised for his pouertie, & trou∣bled therefore: and therfore it is euen asmuch as if we did reproche God for setting such a man to bee mocked, troubled, and molested, and that if they doe him iniurie out of the which he can not deliuer himselfe, that hee is the cause thereof. This same is but to too com∣mon in poperie: albeeit that they perswade themselues that they woulde doe no such iniurie vnto God: but the effect doeth shewe the contrary, when wee make no account of the poore, in compa∣rison of Images and ceremonies: euen when for to mainteine them wee will polle the poore: and woulde to GOD that they which boast themselues to bee reformed after the Gospell were
not giuen vnto suche mockery, or rather worse. But what? For to mainteine themselues at their ease and pleasure, to winne credite and authoritie, they wil vse crueltie towardes the poore, or at the least will make themselues companions of those which doe op∣presse them, & will as it were holde vp their chinne, and make them more bolde. All such kinde of people doe take their pa∣stime and ioy, so to handle the poore, for to destroy them: for the which they shal not escape vnpunished. Solomon doeth declare it, saying, And hee that reioyceth, &c. Hee calleth the trouble, vex∣ation, damage and detriment, the spoyling and desolation which the poore doe suffer, destruction, because they are voide of humane helpe, and are tormented and molested, and no man helping nor succouring them as they ought, but contrarily, they haue not so little but they wil haue it. This violence may wel be called destruc∣tion, when they which doe it, care not what miserie and desolation they bringe vppon the poore, and woulde rather put them to death, then to fayle of eating them, euen to make them to begge their bread. And therefore the Scripture calleth them murthe∣rers and menslears. And so they well deserue punishment: as also the threateninges are conteined in diuers places, as wee may Esai. 1. 21. Osee. 4. 1. 2 Psal. 94. 3. Zach. 11. 4. 5 1. Ioh. 3. 15. Rom. 12. 15 1. Cor. 12. 26. Mat. 9. 13. Pro. 14. 31. Mat. 25. 40. see by the Scriptures, God hath executed them also. And forasmuch as there is none of sounde iudgement which woulde bee counted a mocker, nor contemner of God, nor destroyer of the poore, nor that would haue God to punish him, we must weepe with those which weepe, that we may haue compassion of our poore mēbers which suffer, shewing mercy by vnfained charitie to the needie: I wil haue mercy and not sacrifice. Thus doing we honour God. For the good that we do towards the poore, is counted to be done vnto God. 6 Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers. Forasmuch as God blessing man, saide vnto him, growe and in∣crease, Gene. 1. 28. & 19. 1. 7. & 13. 16. & 17. 2. and replenishe the earth: and to Noe, and to Abraham, and to other holy Patriarkes: Therefore olde men ought wel to re∣ioyce, and count themselues happie, and to counte it for
a great honour and beautifying, when they haue a great stocke and linage, and that they may see themselues to bee Grandfathers. Da∣uid Psal. 128. 1 sheweth wel this same: and Solomon hauing regard vnto suche promises, sayeth, Childrens, children, &c. If wee haue then a mul∣titude of children and cousins, let vs confesse it with ioye and glad∣nesse that God hath blessed vs, and honoured vs: and let vs not re∣semble the worldly and couetous infidels, which complaine to bee charged with too many children, when they haue more then they doe desire, where they ought to reioyce, and thanke God, who doth communicate vnto them the title of Father, the which belongeth Mat. 13. 9. vnto him onely. Let vs not also be like vnto them which doe so dote ouer their children, that they suffer them to runne at randon, and where they list, and doe not teache them the feare of the Lord, and neither doe correct and rebuke them for feare that they should trouble them. Suche kinde of people, so muche as in them lieth, doe despise their Crowne: for they take the way for to be troubled and dishonoured for their children: seeing it is a daily & common thing that the children which are not corrected, waxe corrupted, and giue themselues vnto dishonest and wicked liuing. Therefore for to Ephe. 6. 4. Collo. 3. 21. Gen. 18. 19 be crowned honestly with our children, let vs folowe Saint Paules teaching: Fathers, prouoke not your children vnto anger: but bring them vp in instruction, &c. Be ye the folowers of Abraham, to whō God giueth witnes that he woulde commande his sonnes and his housholde after him, that they keepe the way of the Lorde, and to doe righteousnes and iudgement. And although it is a common matter aswel vnto the children and elect of God, as also to the chil∣dren of the Deuil and reprobate, to haue great posteritie, and that ordinarily the infidels haue more children then the faithful, & that God suffereth them to increase: yet the minde of Solomon is not to giue the Crowne vnto the faithful, but onely to the beleeuers: for what hee saieth, is spoken according to the former promises, the which are not sure and stedfast but vnto the faithful, who doe ac∣knowledge the honour that God doeth vnto them, when he giueth them children abundantly. And because they are not vnthankful to∣wardes God, hee doeth giue them a continual ioye, the which shal neuer be taken from them: but it shal rather growe vnto an eternal blessing, wherin they shal obteine the crown of immortal glorie: for
God doeth not corporally crowne his, for afterwardes to make no account of them: otherwise their state should be no better then the same of the infidels: for they reioyce and are glad, and count them¦selues blessed to see themselues fathers of a greate stocke and kindred: but suche ioye is not of any continuance, considering the teares, and gnashing of teeth, which shal folowe it. Nowe that it is the intent of Solomon to giue the Crowne vnto the elect of God, hee doeth somewhat shewe it, when he addeth, And the glorie of the children are their Fathers. For sith hee conferreth the glorie and honour of the children with the crowne of the Elders, it folow∣eth wel, that his minde is to attribute the crowne vnto the faithful Fathers: for the children are not honoured by infidels fathers, but Psa. 95. & 106. 6. 7. Esay. 43. 27. &. 65. 7. Iere. 2. 5. 6. Exe. 2. 3. & 16. 3. Mat. 23. 30. rather dishonoured: and chiefly when they folow the way of their fathers: for their fathers faults & iniquities are laid to their charge by the Prophets, saying, they are like their fathers. The Scripture is ful of suche reproches. And if the children haue had good fathers, and that they be wicked, their fathers also are not honoured by thē, Iohn the 8 Chapter, 37. verse. 7 High talke becommeth not a foole, much lesse a lying talk a Prince. There is none so foolishe in the worlde, but persuadeth him∣selfe that when hee speaketh, none could speake any thing better: and the most foolishe doe thinke they speake goldenly (after a kind of speaking,) and yet they neither saye, neither can, or they wil not speake any thing woorth, nor wherein they which are truely wise, may be delighted therewith. Solomon doeth signifie this same, say∣ing, High talke, or the lippe of excellencie, &c. The foole can not haue the lippe of excellencie: and therefore let vs vnderstande that Solomon doeth not speake of that which the foole hath, but of that which he thinketh to haue, or that would that other should giue it him. Now forasmuch as there is no word of excellēcie, but the pure trueth, it foloweth therefore, that by the lippe of excellencie, Solo∣mon vnderstandeth the mouth which speaketh agreeably & accor∣dingly vnto the worde of God. Hee shewerh this same, when a∣gainst
the lip of excellencie, hee setteth a lying lippe, or lying talke: saying, Much lesse, &c. For the contrarie of lying, is trueth. Here∣in hee sheweth that the foole hath nothing more proper to him then lying, and that hee is so filled therewith, that trueth cannot a∣gree with him, neither can hee delight in it, but doeth hate it. For the foolishe whereof Solomon speaketh are the children of the De∣uil, Iohn. 8. 44. who is the father of lying. They are like vnto him of whome Dauid speaketh in his 52. Psalme and 4. verse. Hee sheweth also vnto kings and Princes of the earth that they ought not to be fooles to speake leasing, in peruerting of iudgement, in making wicked lawes, and pronounce vnrighteous sentences against the trueth, right and equitie: for seeing that they doe not exercise the iudgement of men, but of God, and that the scripture calleth them Gods, God is truth, therefore they ought to vnderstande that it is more vndecent for 2. Chro. 10. 6 Psal. 82. 16. them to pronounce and to doe any false matter, then it is for the foolishe and wicked to counterfaite honest and wise men. Notwith∣standing if the worlde bee replenished with those which sit in the thrones of Kings, and iudicial seates, which commit either indeed or in woorde greate falsnesse: in such wise that wee may almost Psal. 82. 2. Esay. 1. 23. Iere. 5. 26. Za. 7. 9. complaine of al superiours and gouernours, and say to them, howe long wil yee giue wrong iudgement: and accept the persons of the vngodly? And so there are but a fewe which are worthy of such seates, but rather to bee placed in the order of fooles. Wherefore they ought to looke for an horrible and feareful vengeance. If they Psa. 2. 4. 5. Esay. 1. 24. Deut. 17. 18 Psal. 2. 10. which haue any knowledge of God, wil auoide it, let them dayly growe and goe forewarde in the same knowledge by the continual studie of the diuine doctrine. 8 A reward is as a stone pleasant in the eyes of them that haue it: it prospereth, whither soeuer it turneth. Wee doe naturally iudge that it is a foule and wicked thing for magistrates & superiours of the earth, which haue the administra∣tion of iustice, to loue gifts & rewards, and to take them: and euen they also which receiue them coulde wel condemne others which
shoulde doe as they doe: but couetousnesse hath corrupted and doeth so corrupt the nature and blinde the wits, and peruerte iudgement, in such wise that men delight to forget natural honestie, and finde nothing more faire, nor more delectable then to enriche themselues by the cost of other: they loue wel to receiue and take that which doeth cost them nothing, but onely to doe them plea∣sure which haue rewarded them, for to doe wrong and iniurie vn∣to other. Solomon doeth discouer this corruption and wickednes, saying, A rewarde, &c. Hee doeth first compare the giftes and rewards that are giuen vnto iudges, vnto precious stones, the which wee gladly beholde, because wee esteeme them and find them faire: and thus he expresseth the greate affection that the wicked iudges haue to take rewards and giftes. Wherein let vs note that hee saieth not what they ought to doe, but he toucheth the great actiuitie & wicked couetousnesse of the iudges of the earth, which are very glad and ioyful that men wil blinde their vnderstanding by force of giftes and rewards. And thus hee sheweth that the worldly and carnal wisedome, which wee commonly desire to bee in iudges and gouernours of countries, (for oftentimes, for the gouernement of the pollicie and iustice, we ordeine worldly wise men) doeth holde vs backe to forget natural honestie, and to bee fouly corrupted. Wherefore wee ought to knowe that the rulers of the earth haue neede of another wisedome: the which is mentioned before in the Pro. 3. 13. & 8. 14. Exo. 18. 21. 1. Sam. 12. 3. 2. Chro. 19. 5. Exo. 23. 8. Leui. 19. 15. Deut. 1. 16. & 16. 18. Esay. 1. 21. & 5. 23. Iere. 5. 26. Eze. 22. 27. Miche. 3. 9. Sopho. 3. 3. 8. chapter and 14. verse. Iethro (the father in lawe of Moyses) did knowe that this wisedome was fit and meete for iudges: and there∣fore hee saide vnto Moyses, Do thou seeke out amongst al the peo∣ple, men of courage, fearing God, men dealing truely, hating coue∣tousnesse: and appoint such ouer them, to bee rulers ouer thou∣sands, &c. Samuel was indued with this wisedome: Iosua requireth the like of iudges. These twoo personages and such like had re∣spect vnto the lawe of the Lorde. And because that GOD hath giuen this lesson vnto iudges, the Prophetes doe crye out sharply against those which doe the contrary, calling them theeues and murtherers. Secondly, when hee saieth, Whither soeuer hee turneth, &c. Hee compareth the giftes and rewardes vnto men, to whome al things come as they woulde and wish, of what side soeuer they turne them, they obteine whatsoeuer they desire.
Wherein hee sheweth that they which take rewardes, doe neither regarde right nor equitie, but peruert iudgement, and folowe the ende for the which they haue receiued the rewardes. And as it is not lawful to take rewardes for iudgement, so also ought no man to giue them, howe good right soeuer they be assured to haue. For in thus doing they shoulde bee an instrument of Satan, for to accu∣stome the Iudges vnto theft and polling: and they were farre bet∣ter to loose their cause, howe good soeuer their matter bee, then to induce the Iudges by giftes to giue sentence: forsomuche as in vs lieth, we make them to breake the lawe of God, and to forget ho∣nestie and natural equitie, and are cause of their destruction and per∣dition. They then which haue an euil cause doe most wickedly, to giue rewardes. They therefore which haue an euil matter, let them forbeare and cease to doe so, and they whose cause is good, let them commit it to God, staying themselues vpon his prouidence. 9 Hee that couereth a transgression, seeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, separateth the Prince. The Princes of the worlde doe desire neither Esaies, nor Iere∣mies, nor Ezechiels, nor Iohn Baptists, nor Pastours, nor Doctors, which wil rebuke them to their faces, for their euil doings: but ra∣ther they say vnto the seers, See not, and to the Prophet, Prophe∣cie not the trueth vnto vs: but preach vnto vs pleasant things, &c. Esai. 30. 10. 11. And they doe abhorre those which tel and shewe vnto them their transgressions. They thinke al thinges are lawful for them: they flatter themselues, and also would be flattered by other: and ther∣fore suche as can dissemble not to see their wickednes, are the best welcome towardes them, they winne their fauoure and friendship, as they doe wishe and desire the same. Solomon doeth signifie this same, when hee sayeth, Hee that couereth a transgression, &c. Though it be an ordi∣narie thing to hide the euil that they doe, whose fauour and friend∣ship according to the worlde wee desire, of what qualitie soeuer they be, yet doe wee chiefly expounde this sentence of those which labour to insinuate and creepe into the fauour of Princes: partly
for to ioyne this sentence vnto the two former: and partly for that, that Solomon doeth shewe it, when hee addeth, But hee that re∣peateth, &c. That is to say, that hee which is not satisfied to haue once admonished the Prince of his euil doing, but, seeing that the Prince perseuereth and continueth in euil, or, againe doeth worse, doeth continue stil also to reprooue him, hee separateth the Prince from him, so that hee is hated of him, and is persecuted vnto death, if the Prince can apprehend and take him. The Prophets and Apo∣stles haue truely prooued this same. So also do they which reprooue any people which persuade themselues that they are Princes, and woulde be esteemed for suche: but what separation soeuer is made, wee must not cease to repeate the thing, and wee ought wel to take heede from hiding their faultes, labouring to hold worldly and car∣nal friendship with the wicked. It is al our dueties: but chiefly it doeth belong vnto the Ministers of the worde. And our Lord would Esai. 58. 1. Ier. 1. 7. 8. 18. 19. Mat. 18. 15. haue vs to preache repentance: the which is not done as it requi∣reth, except that the faultes be discouered. And hee would haue e∣uerie man to rebuke his brother. Wee ought then to vnderstande that Solomon doeth not heere pronounce what wee ought to doe: but hee sheweth what the nature of flatterers is: to wit, that they wil not rebuke the trangressions, not because they loue their neigh∣bours, but because that they loue themselues, and woulde also bee beloued of other. Suche were the false Prophets amongest the peo∣ple of Israel, who in steede of rebuking and threatening the people, and the Princes of their misdooinges, made them beleeue that al Ier. 23. 16. Eze. 13. 6. should goe wel on their side: and so they loued them not: for they did deceiue and destroy them. Suche are those nowe which become the felowes of the wicked, or that flatter the Nicodemites. He she∣weth also what the hardinesse & arrogancie of those is, which think themselues great, and mightie: to wit, that it seemeth to them that they haue licence to doe whatsoeuer they wil, and that no man Rom. 12. 18. Hebr. 12. 14 ought to rebuke them. But because that wee ought to haue peace with al, some expounde to couer the transgression, as (Chapter, 10. verse 12.) wee haue expounded couereth al trespasses: and to sepa∣rate the Prince, as Chapter 16. verse 28. If wee wil folowe this sense which is true, and conteineth good doctrine, as wee haue
seene, wee must say that this sentence is a repetition of the two for∣mer sentences, the which is not vndecent nor vnmeete. Neuer∣theles, because that Solomon by these sentences hath laboured to aduertise vs of diuers and many thinges, there is no inconuenience to say, howe Solomon doeth giue vs heere a newe aduertisement. And therefore, I haue taken this sentence in the first sense, leauing the readers in their libertie to choose which of the two senses they shal like best, and most meetest. 10 A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnder∣standing, then an hundreth stripes into a foole. Forasmuche as wee al doe offende in many thinges, it folow∣eth that what wisedome soeuer we haue, yet is it not so perfect but Iam. 3. 2. that wee haue great neede to be aduised and admonished, to be cor∣rected and reprooued, that wee may become more wise and better aduised. Solomon would giue vs the same here to vnderstand. Also Pro. 9. 8. 9. they which are truely wise and learned, are not arrogant and pre∣sumptuous, so farre as to thinke that they haue no neede to bee ad∣monished and rebuked: but with al humblenes doe heare instructi∣on, and thinke wel of them that rebuke them. They looke not to be handeled sharply, but by the onely woorde of the messengers of God, they doe truely confesse their faultes: as Dauid at the Prea∣ching 2. Sam. 12. 1 Luk. 22. 61 62. of Nathan the Prophet, and as Saint Peter at the onely looke of Iesus Christ. Contrarily, the foolishe are so proude, arrogant, and so hardened, that not only they disdaine the rebukes by words, and doe iest thereat, but also they kicke against the spurre, despigh∣ting and murmuring against the roddes & corrections of God: and so muche it wanteth that they humbly and with patience receiue them to amendment, that rather they waxe obstinate and indurate, and become worse. Pharao King of Egypt is a glasse thereof: as we may see from the beginning of the seuenth Chapter of Exodus, vn∣to the ende of the 14. Euen so are the Iewes also which were cha∣stened so farre as that they forsooke GOD, as a man might saye, as it appeareth by the Scripture.
11 A seditious person seeketh onely euil, and a cruel mes∣senger shalbe sent against him. The beginning of this present sentence may be taken after two senses. The first is, That hee which is a rebel to God and his worde, and to them which haue charge from him, doeth shewe by his re∣bellion and resistance that hee beareth hatred and malice, whereby hee deuiseth nothing but to despight God, to tread his word vnder foote, and to hurt those which exhort him in the name of GOD. The children of Israel haue thus done in al times: as the Scripture witnesseth. They beganne euen at the departing out of Egypt, and so continued in the wildernes, and in the lande of Canaan. Our Lord Iesus Christ doeth rebuke them for it. When we were vnder Mat. 23. 34. Poperie, liuing in infidelitie and ignorance, we were neuer a whit better. Let vs nowe take heede that we become not worse, when the light of life doeth shine vnto vs. This first sense agreeth wel: for the rebellion of suche, commeth because they loue not God, nor their neighbours. Now they which haue no loue, can not but ima∣gine euil. The seconde sense is, That hee which thus rebelleth, doth tende to nothing but his destruction and ouerthrowe, seeing hee hath to doe with a strong enemie: for albeit that hee dealeth as he thinketh good, with weake and frayle men: yet he riseth vp against God. Beholde, this is for the seconde sense, the which dependeth vp∣on Exo. 16. 7. Num. 14. 11. the first: and foloweth it: for it foloweth wel, that if a sediti∣ous person seeketh onely euil to his neighbour, that euil again must happen to him: as hath bene shewed here before. The wicked man must needes fal into the pit that hee hath digged for other. Now af∣ter what sorte soeuer the seditious seeketh the euil, hee is wel wor∣thie that euil shoulde light vpon him: and therefore, that he might bee punished, A cruel messenger, shalbe sent. By the cruel mes∣senger, hee meaneth al meanes by the which God afflicteth and pu∣nisheth the seditious, for to destroy them, without any remedie, be they men or Deuils, yea Angels of heauen: bee it by pestilence, fa∣mine, pouertie, warre or other sicknesse. To bee shorte, al things that are sent vnto the seditious for to destroy him, howe good
so euer they bee of themselues, yet are they cruel messengers vnto the rebel: though by nature they are not suche. In this sense the Esai. 13. 9. Ier. 6. 23. & 50. 42. & 30. 14. Esai. 37. 36 day of the Lord is called a cruel day, and the Assirians and Chalde∣ans cruel, and the Medes and Persians, and the chastisements of the Lorde cruel: The Angel of the Lorde was a cruel messenger vnto the Assirians. 12 It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie. Man by his first creation was made verie excellent, but by his sinne hee became so vile and abiect, so cursed and wicked, that he Gen. 1. 26. 27 Eccle. 3. 18 & 7. 30. is not woorthie of himself, to be placed amongst beastes, but ought to be set more lowe. The holie Scripture doeth compare him often vnto cruel beastes, as to Foxes, Wolues, Lions and Leopards. Here∣in it sheweth after a sort, that man is worse then they: considering that these beastes doe folow the nature that God hath giuen them: and man of his owne malice hath corrupted his first nature, wherin hee was created, for to giue himselfe vnto al wickednes, making himselfe like the Deuil, which is the most dangerous, the strongest and the most cruel beast to meete with al that is on the earth, for there is no force nor wickednes to bee compared vnto the same of the Deuil, as Saint Paule doeth wel shewe. Nowe seeing it is thus, it is vpon good cause that Solomon saieth, That it is not so dange∣rous Ephe. 6. 10 to meete with a Beare, which hath newly lost her whelps, then to haue to doe with a foole, that foloweth his foolishnesse with a loose bridle: and as touching our nature, corrupted and malitious, wee are al fooles and ledde by follie, from the which wee can not neither wil be exempted, but doe folowe it most hastily, it folow∣eth therefore, that we are verie fierce and cruel, except that God by often admonitions, rebukes, threateninges and chastisements, doe make vs soft and gentle. And thus, it is a verie dangerous thing to haue to doe with a man, before that God hath regenerated and renewed him by his holie Spirite, and hath mortified his members which are on earth. If then wee bee not so vngentle, nor so cruel as others, it commeth not of our goodnesse, but of the onely mer∣cie Coll. 3. 50.
of God, whereby hee hath changed and softened vs. Furthermore, let vs learne that follie is no smal vice, but a wic∣kednesse greatly furious, by reason whereof the foolishe are vne∣qually yoked with other: and thus they are forsaken of al, the which is a great miserie, for no man can dwel with them. And as by Psal. 5. 6. & 18. 26. Collo. 3. 12. their violence and crueltie, they driue away other, euen so, God can not abide them in his presence. And suche as they shew them¦selues towardes or against their neighbours, euen so wil God shew himselfe towardes them againe. Let vs then take heede to folowe Saint Paule, which doeth ad∣monishe vs thus, Nowe therefore as the electe of GOD ho∣lie and beloued, put on tender mercie, kindnesse, humblenesse of minde, meekenesse, long suffering: forbearing one an other, and forgiuing one an other, if any man haue a quarrel to an other: e∣uen as Christ forgaue you, euen so doe yee, &c. And in this sorte shalbee accomplished in vs, The Woolfe shall dwel with the Lambe, and the Leoparde shal lye with the Kid and Esai. 11. 6. 7. the Calfe, and the Lion and the fat beast together, and a little childe shal leade them. 13 Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil shal not departe from his house. The worldlinges and carnally minded, doe esteeme and pro∣nounce a man to bee of a fainte courage, when hee steppes not Exo. 23. 4. 5. Mat. 5. 44. Rom. 12. 17 1. Pet. 2. 9. foorth to be reuenged of his enemies, and to yeelde them the like, or woorse: but God iudgeth cleane contrarie, when he comman∣deth vs to doe good for euil vnto our enemies. Whereuppon it followeth, that they are woorthie and valiant, which doe beare the iniuries and doe not render euil for euil, but rather good for euil. It foloweth also, seeing that God hath commanded to doe good vnto our enemie, that hee which yeeldeth euil for euil, shal not goe vnpunished, as a transgressour of the lawe: although that in reuen∣ging hee seemeth not to offende against natural light. I say expresly, he seemeth: for in this place, that which is called natural light are
deuilishe darknesses, with which the sensual man hath his mynde darkened, and can not knowe howe patient hee shoulde bee, and beare with his neighbours which fayle. Nowe if God punish them which yeelde euil for euil, by a stronger reason the vnthankful, vn∣gentle and cruel which oppresse those which haue done them good, ought to looke for sharpe punishment. Solomon doeth plainely shewe this same, when hee sayeth, Euil shal not depart from his house. This is not alwayes seene with the eye: for the Lorde doeth suffer the vnthankful and cruel to prosper in this worlde, that they dispose and order their houses at their desires, yea, euen a long time, in outwarde appearance: but his vengeance ceaseth not for al that to be readie, for to be executed at time conuenient openly: the which he doeth vppon some later, and vpon the other sooner sending them great troubles. And yet he that suffereth not that they should bee without euil: for by reason of their ingratitude and crueltie which they knowe to bee against nature, their consciences doeth reprooue them, and haue their mindes in continual feare, and are terrified with the iudgement of God. For albeit they labour by al meanes to take their pleasure and bee mery, for to forget the euil they doe, or perswade them∣selues to beleeue that they doe none: yet seeing that they yeelde euil for good, they resist against nature, and fight against it, they cannot auoid but that their wickednesse will appeare before them, and conuince them in their conscience that they are wicked: and therfore they are in a continual trembling and fearefulnes, although they labour sore to assure themselues and to be glad: For there is no peace to the wicked. And so they beginne their hel euen here hoth they and their housholdes which folowe their steppes and wayes. Now forasmuch as by our corrupted nature we are al inclined and geuen to yeeld euil for good, we ought wel to feare this threat∣ning, seeing we desire that al should be wel and prosper in our hou∣ses and families, both in our time, and after our decease from gene∣ration to generation. Let vs take heede, that we folow not our corruption least wee he of the number of those against whom the Prophet Ieremie doth
both pray and prophesie. Therefore to be exempted from such euil, Ier. 18. 19. wee must bee gouerned by the holie Ghost, which may make vs to yeeld that duetie which wee owe vnto our neighbours. 14 The beginning of strife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off. It is a verie dangerous thing to breake howe litle soeuer it be, a browe or bancke which keepeth in a riuer in his course, least it shoulde spreade ouer the erable lande or meddowes, or through townes or villages: for so soone as ther is but neuer so litle a breach begonne, if the riuer beginne once to grow and to swel, the vio∣lence & rage of the water wil easily enlarge the breach: & thē there is an inundation & flood made, which bringeth great temporal hurt whereas the ouerflowing happeneth. Nowe if wee feare such an opening for the danger or hurt that foloweth, wee must needes feare to begin a striefe, and to stirre vp any debate amongst our neighhours of what qualitie or condition soeuer they bee, but chiefly betweene kinges and Princes, and lordes of the earth. For looke by how much as the riuer is the grea∣ter, by so much shal the breache of the banke bee more dangerous: euen so also by howe much as men are of greater strength and po∣wer, by so muche is the striefe more dangerous which is begunne to be raised betweene thē. We ought then to feare to begin any strife: for as by a breache and opening of the banke, the waters breake in, which bring great hurt to the goods on the land: euen so also the beginning of a strife, bringeth greate hurte both to the bodies and soules of men: for hatreds, spites and desires of vengeance are kin∣dled, 1. Ioh. 2. 3. 14. which kil the soules. Also by the beginning of strife are raysed seditions, insurrections, frayes and cruel warres, and much blood is spilt, besides theftes and spoylings, besides whoredomes, and adulte∣ries, and besides other oppressions. Solomon maketh this compari∣son, when he saith, The beginning of strife is as one that openeth the waters, &c. Not that al thinges are like and equal, as hath beene alreadie
shewed, and also may be seene by experience, but Solomō maketh this comparison, for to shewe that it is verie harde to let and stop, that many euils shoulde not folowe vpon the beginning of stryfe. And therefore hee admonisheth that wee shoulde take heede from beginning of debate, saying, Therfore ere the contention, &c. Hee doeth heere teache vs, that if wee see our neighbours to bee incou∣raged to make debate with vs, let vs bee readie to seeke peace and reconciliation with them, and let vs be so gentle, gracious and pa∣tient, that wee may leade our neighbours vnto quietnes, and to de∣sist and leaue off the euil that they deuise. And for to doe this wel, we must take heede from nourishing of hatred in our hearts: for hatred stirreth vp strifes. And so to leaue off wel, before the Pro. 10. 12 contention bee medled with, wee must bee enclined to brotherly loue. 15 Hee that iustifieth the wicked, and hee that condem∣neth the iust, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde. Wee al doe naturally knowe that God loueth the righteous and keepeth thē: & contrarily, that he hateth the wicked, & letteth them perishe, yea, doeth punishe and destroy them. Wee know al∣so naturally that we must be folowers of God, hating euil, and per∣secuting it, & to bee louers of goodnesse, & folowers of it, and wee would be accounted to be thus affectioned: and are readie to think and pronounce of others which doe the contrarie, that they be no honest men. Wee also iudge naturally, that the righteous ought to be mainteined and conserued, and the wicked reiected and cast off. Nowe for to helpe this natural iudgement, and for to make them which shal stande against it more vnexcusable, God hath giuen vs his lawe by writing, by the which hee commaundeth vs the good, and forbiddeth vs the euil, not onely giuing vnto vs the twoo tables of stone, but also diuers other commaundementes and for∣biddinges, for the exposition of the saide tables: as wee may see it in the Bookes of Moyses: whose doctrine Solomon folow∣ing, sayeth,
He that iustifieth the wicked, &c. When hee speaketh thus, hee hath regarde vnto that which is saide: for to declare this same Exo. 23. 6. Leui. 19. 15. Deut. 1. 17 & 16. 19. Esai. 5. 23. & 59. 14. Ier. 21. 12. & 223. Amos. 5. 6. wel, the Lord hath added vnto his lawe, the Prophets, which haue often cried out vpon the wicked Iudges. And forasmuch as in iu∣stifying the wicked, wee goe against the right and natural wri∣ting, wee woorthily deserue to be abhorred of the Lorde, which is authour not onely of the lawe written, but also of natural know∣ledge: for we haue no knowledge, nor natural light, but that which hee hath giuen vs. Against the which if wee stande, wee are worse then bruit beastes which folowe their nature: and in going against the lawe written, we are like vnto seruantes and maides which de∣spise that which they be ordeined and commaunded to doe about their maisters woorke, and labour to marre al for to vexe and to de∣spite them whom they shoulde please and obey. Nowe if such, ser∣uantes and maydes are hated of vs, if we haue any such, it foloweth rightly that wee must be in abhomination to the Lord, whome wee ought to obey and please, if wee stande agaynst the Law that he hath giuen vs by writing. Whervpon foloweth eternall death: for none can obteine saluation except he please the Lorde God. Wherefore the wicked iudges ought well to tremble: for this sentence is cheef∣ly directed to them, and also the threatnings which are in the places before alleadged. 16 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wisedome, and he hath no heart? The flatterers which desire to make their particular profite with the riche, howe wicked soeuer the riche bee, cease not to la∣bour to persuade them to beleeue that they are good men, and that they doe very wisely whatsoeuer they take in hande: and cheefly when they are giuen to gather together: and contrarily, the poore are despised, and are counted fooles, except they laboure to become rich: and thus it seemeth vnto the worldlings that wisedome com∣meth from riches. But let the wicked man which is here named a foole, haue in his hand readie for to giue so great a price as he can: or that hee hath for to holde it and to keepe it, yet shall hee not
be wise. For first of all such fooles despise and reiect all meanes fit and meete to come by wisedome, and also refuse the thing it selfe. Secondly, blessed is the man which findeth wisedome. Wherevp∣pon foloweth that no sufficient price that may be giuen, can get it. Pro. 1. 7. 22. & 3. 13. But the meanes fit and meete to come by wisedome, is to apply our heartes thereto: the which the foole can not, nor will doe: as So∣lomon heere sheweth, when he sayth, The foole hath no hearte. Leauing then the fooles, let vs set our mindes, our heartes and vn∣derstandinges, vpon the pure woorde of God: and we shall obteine wisedome by the grace and gift of GOD. Sith then it is the Lord who giueth wisedome, the which we must seeke with al our heart Pro. 2. 1. and we haue no heart that is ought woorth: Therefore it folow∣eth wee must demaunde a cleane hearte as Dauid did. Psal. 51. 12 17 A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduersitie. They that are rich or mightie, which haue credit and authori∣tie, they whose matters happen as they woulde haue them, and are in great prosperitie, doe finde many which doe honour and reue∣rence them, which declare themselues to be at their commaunde∣ment and shew them great tokens of loue, labouring to make them beleeue that they are their singular freendes, but if fortune change and growe to woorse, they which before shewed themselues their freendes, doe mocke at them, turne their backes vpon them, or per∣secute them, where they ought to be more ready and careful to help them, if they were truely freendes: for in necessitie a freende is knowne. Wherevppon foloweth rightly, that they which shewe them¦selues freendes in prosperitie, were not freendes indeede. For, as sayth Solomon, A freende loueth at all times. Hee regar∣deth not whither it be day or night, whether they bee in aduer∣sitie or prosperitie, in a storme or fayre weather, in peace or in war in power or in weaknes, in honour or shame, in riches or pouerty, but
the true friende loueth & declareth chiefly his loue, whē his neigh∣bour is in trouble, griefe and vexation, in sorowe, affliction, and necessitie: yea, though hee were hated and persecuted of all the world. Solomon sheweth wel this same, when hee addeth, And a bro∣ther is borne for aduersitie. Forasmuche as the friende is borne as a brother to tribulation (seeing that the brother neuer ought to forsake his brother for any miserie that hee suffereth, but ought to haue care of him, chiefly in his afflictions: for then haue wee also most neede of true friendes) hee sheweth wel, that wee must bee friendes vnto the needie and painful, and to them which suffer ca∣lamitie and miserie, and brotherly to helpe them with al our pow∣er: for the true brother imployeth and bestoweth himselfe gladly altogether for his brother, sparing nothing that hee hath, or may haue, til he hath deliuered his brother out of affliction. And when hee speaketh of birth, in the which the creature is al newe, and be∣ginneth to bee, hee sheweth that hee which hath shewed himselfe to be a true friende to his neighbour in prosperitie, that in time of miserie hee wil begin to declare vnto him more abundantly his loue, not by wordes onely, but indeede: as wee are admonished by the Scripture in expresse examples and testimonies. Abraham may bee an example, in the deliuerance of Lot: and also Moyses Gen. 14. 14 Exo. 1. 12. Gen. 43. Exo. 22. 25. Leui. 19. 9. 10. 18. Deu. 15. 7. Iam. 2. 15. 16 1. Ioh. 3. 17. when hee smote the Egyptian, and in the labour that hee tooke to deliuer the children of Israel: Ioseph likewise. As touching the witnesses, they are many in number. He shew∣eth vs also by this birth, that if wee haue not shewed some signe of friendship vnto our neighbour, when hee was in prosperitie, that yet we should begin to loue him in his necessitie, in helping him af∣ter our abilitie and power. By these things wee may knowe, and al∣so by experience, that the poore, the fatherles, the widowes, and the strangers, haue not many friendes. 18 A man destitute of vnderstanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth suretie for his neighbour.
Albeit that Solomon doeth attribute want of vnderstanding, or faintnesse of heart vnto a man which becommeth pledge for his neighbour, yet hee pretendeth not to turne vs away from answe∣ring for our neighbours, when necessitie requireth, and so that wee may doe it without bringing ourselues and our familie into danger of begging our bread miserably, and not that strangers shoulde bee set at ease at our cost: as hath beene handeled, Chapter 6. verse 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 19 Hee loueth transgression, that loueth striefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, seeketh destruction. Forasmuche as there is none of vs that woulde bee esteemed a transgressour, neither is there any man that desireth (as hee thin∣keth) his destruction, let vs vnderstande, that when Solomon doth shewe vs that from strife wee come to delight for to transgresse, & that frō pride or exaltation, which is signified by him that exal∣teth his gate, proceedeth death and destruction, let vs vnderstande, I say, that hee doeth exhorte vs that wee shoulde turne away from al striefes, which come of enimitie, hatred, malice, and appetite of vengeance. Nowe hee sayth, that hee which delighteth to haue suche strifes, delighteth to doe euil, giuing himselfe vnto al sinne and vi∣ces, in committing the which he thinketh to ouercome his enimie with whome hee is at strife: and so strife is the roote of much mis∣chiefe, when we are led to strise through hatred and enuie: contra∣rily, the strife shoulde bee mainteined, when it requireth the maintenance of the honour and glory of God, his pure trueth, and the edification of his Church, against the Heretikes, and to defende the righteous & innocent against the violēce of the wicked. He that loueth such debates, loueth not transgression, but doeth abhorre it, and loueth trueth: for he followeth that which God desireth and Iere. 17. 17. 18. 19. Gen. 11 Esa. 36. & 37. Dan. 4. 2. Sam. 15. commandeth. Let vs also vnderstand that he doeth admonishe vs to put of al pride and highnesse of minde, when hee threateneth him with destruction which exalteth his gate. Wherefore, let vs not be like vnto them which builded Babel: nor like vnto Zennacherib, Na∣buchadnezer, nor Absolom. Wee are also exhorted after a sort that
wee shoulde bee carefull to builde the Churche and house of God, and to make ourselues freendes in communicating of our goods vnto the needie: and in so doing, we shal haue not onely gates made of corruptible stones, but also eternal tabernacles in the heauens. 20 The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, shal fall into euill. Wee may see before our eies that the wicked and froward haue temporal felicitie and ioy, that they are at their ease, and doe great∣ly florishe: and therefore, it seemeth at the first sight that Solomon standeth against experience, when he saith, The frowarde heart findeth no good, &c. But if wee consi∣der the nature of the frowarde heart, which is to deuise euil conti∣nually, and to giue no rest vnto his minde, wee shal knowe that the froward heart howe florishing soeuer hee bee, shal not finde the good that is spoken of in this place: for Solomon speaketh not heere of temporall goods which are common both to good and to bad: but of those goods whereof Dauid speaketh in his Psalme. 34. ver. 13. If such goods are not founde by the froward heart, it is no wonder, for hee neither asketh nor seeketh it: the which is re∣quired in the finding thereof, and also hee is in abhomination too the Lorde. Nowe the Lorde doeth not giue vnto the frowarde whome hee hateth and abhorreth, that which hee hath ordeined properly for his children, whome hee loueth, and in whom hee taketh his de∣light, Mat. 7. 7. Pro. 11. 20. but sendeth them euil, whereinto they fal and perishe. Solo∣mon pronounceth this fal and perdition, saying, And he that hath a naughtie tongue, shall fall into euill. For although he speaketh heere of the tongue, yet doeth hee not say any thing which is not ioyned to the former part, and which followeth not also: for sith there can come nothing out of the poke and sacke, but that which is within, euen so it followeth, that it is necessary for the frowarde heart to haue also a lewd & naughtie tongue, the which speaketh frō the abundance therof. And so, they which speake euil, cannot be said to bee good and honest men, if they wil not lie, and falsifie the vn∣fallible Mat. 12. 34.
trueth, which calleth the Pharisees which spake euil, Gene∣rarion of vipers. And also forasmuch as the frowarde hearte doeth finde no good, he must then needes finde euil, that if it bee in this worlde openly, yet hel shal finde him. And therefore, let vs not bee enuious to be of a frowarde heart, nor naughtie in our tongues, but let vs folowe Solomon. And because it is the gift of God, wee must Pro. 4. 23. aske it of him. 21 Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himselfe sorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy. Forasmuche as it is a blessing of God to beget children, and to haue kindred, it is no reason that we should bee greeued when wee haue a multitude of children, but confessing truely that it is the gift of God, wee must therefore giue him thankes and praises, in follow∣ing the good old fathers, which reioyced when the Lord gaue them linage. And for to continewe in this ioy, the fathers and mothers must bee careful and diligent for to enstruct their children in the Gen. 4. 1. 25. & 21. 6. 1. Sam. 2. Luke. 68. Ephe. 6. 1. Collo. 3. 20. Ephe. 6. 4 feare of the Lord, admonishing, correcting, and chastening them, for to make them obediēt vnto God, which commandeth them, to ho∣nour their father and mother. And for to obey them wel, let them folow what S. Paul saith, Children, obey your father and mother in the Lorde: for that is righteous. Now for to leade them rightly thereto, let the fathers and mo∣thers bee careful, of that which Saint Paul doeth admonishe them, And yee fathers, prouoke not your children to wrath: but bring them vp in instruction, and information of the Lord: And this they must not doe onely with word, but chiefly with holy conuersation, giuing them good example: let them followe also that which Saint Paule teacheth. Let the elder men bee sober, honest discrete, sound in the faith, in loue, and in patience. Otherwise the children in Titus. 2. 2. steede to stande in feare, to bee obedient, humble and modest wil bee proude, rebellious, arrogant and dissolute: and thus in steed too bee wise, they shalbee fooles: and in steede of giuing ioy to their parentes, they shal bring them sorowe: For hee that begetteth a foole &c. Solomon hath already heeretofore fore∣taught
vs this same. And forasmuche as parentes do not conceaue a∣ny sorowe for their children, except folly appeare, the which cannot Pro. 10. 1. & 15. 20 bee seene til they are past their infancie, therefore it followeth that to beget, is not taken for the first generation, wherein the children haue no knowledge nor discretion, but for the disposition that the children do get, either by the negligence and wickednes of their pa∣rents, or els by the wilfulnesse, and obstinacie of the children them∣selues, or els by them both. If the disposition come by the fault of the parents, then can they not of themselues bee sory, for the folly of their children, but doe rather delight therein, take pleasure and reioyce thereat. But wee must not thinke for al this but that Solo∣mon saith ture: for God can tel howe to finde out suche parentes, & conuert their ioy into sorow, in raising vp their children against them, or giuing vp their children vnto such wickednesse that they shal come to the gallowes, or els by destroying both themselues and their children by diuers miseries and afflictions. But if hauing doone their duetie, by admonitions, corrections, and chastisinges, they coulde beget none but fooles, they shalbe sorowfull, but yet it shalbe to the hurt of their children. Wee may apply this same vnto Superiours and subiectes, to Ministers and their people. 22 A ioyfull heart causeth good health: but a sorowfull minde drieth the bones. There is no man but vnderstandeth and confesseth, that if a sicke man doe willingly and gladly take Phisicke, but that it may be pro∣fitable for to restore strength to the members weakened, and good colour vnto the face againe, which was decayed by sicknesse: con∣trarily, if a man bee vexed and troubled, and that hee delighteth in nothing, nor in any good medicine that is prescribed him, it shal not profite his body, but wil come to nothing, and vanishe away with∣out restoring him. Solomon doth plainely pronounce it, when hee faith, A ioyful heart causeth good health: but a sorowfull minde dryeth the bones. And in this hee teacheth vs, that wee may not giue ouer reioysing, though that God doeth smite vs and sende vs
sicknesse: but that with ioy wee shoulde vse the meanes ordeined of God for the recouering of helth, strength, and force, that we may not bee vnprofitable, as dry bones, but may bee fit and apt to serue God and our neighbours in the vocation whereto wee are called. And so hee teacheth vs howe wee muste vse the thinges that God giueth vs for this body, that wee make them not vnprofitable and vnfruitful: and hee sheweth vs that wee must not despise our bodies: for God also hath not disdained them, when hee created al thinges for them, and that he would administer vnto them al things necessary for them: as our Lorde Iesus Christe doeth teache vs, when hee saith vnto vs, That wee shoulde aske of our heauenly fa∣ther, that hee would giue vs this day our daily bread. Also he hath created both the Phisition and Phisike, reteining neuerthelesse to himselfe the healing. Therefore in vsing ioyfully the helpe of Phi∣sitions, Eccl. 38. 2. Chro. 16. 1 and of medicines, let vs not put our trust therin, but in God: not doing as Asa did. Nowe albeit that in this sentence wee may learne that which hath beene saide, yet wee must vnderstande that Solomon preten∣deth by corporal thinges to bring vs vnto spiritual. And therefore that our bones may not dry away, least wee perishe without reme∣die, let vs take heede that when wee are sicke, yea dead by our sins, that wee bee not greeued that the chiefe Phisition Iesus Christe shoulde come vnto vs, and exhort vs vnto repentance, wherevnto Luke. 15.  let vs bee giuen with ioy: as also there is ioy in it. &c, 23 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosome to wrest the waies of iudgement. There are many which perswade themselues to beleeue that they doe no euil in taking giftes, prouided that they haue not ex∣acted nor required them, and that no man seeth any thing, for it is the custome of wicked iudges, which woulde be in estimation, more to feare men then God, or to labour to set God wholy in contempt and forgetfulnesse, and haue their respect vnto men. But what wise∣dome soeuer they challenge, yet are they wicked: as they shoulde wel vnderstande, when God forbiddeth iudges expresly too take giftes, and that hee calleth them which receiue giftes, theeues and
murtherers. Solomon also doth giue them it to vnderstande, when he saith, A wicked man taketh a gift, &c. He discouereth and openeth the wickednesse of such iudges: first of al when hee saith that they take it out of the bosome: for hee sheweth that in taking the gift secretly, they doe against their conscience, and that they haue more reuerence to men then to God, or that they bee of the number of those of whome the Psalmist complaineth. Secondly when hee saith, To wrest the waies of iudgement. For he sheweth that hee vi∣olently pulleth the right from him to whome it belongeth, as hee knoweth wel, but his couetousnesse doeth compel him to counter∣uaile Psal. 94. 3. the gift to him which hath giuen it him, as Solomon hath shewed heeretofore, saying, that wheresoeuer the gift is giuen, it prospereth. And thus Solomon doeth shewe vs that the iudges, which receiue giftes, neither can, nor wil administer iustice, and therefore they rightly deserue to bee called wicked. Let iudges and magistrates vnderstand that they are heere admonished, that if they wil rightly administer iustice, they must wholy absteine from taking of giftes. Also they ought to shunne flatteries and worldly honours, and to haue no respect of persons, for by these thinges they wrest iudgement, aswel as by the receite of giftes, but the holy Scripture doeth more often make mention of giftes, because that giftes are of greater power, so that they which loue them, wil be ready for to be∣tray their fathers and mothers. 24 Wisedome is in the face of him that hath vnderstan∣ding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde. There are many men which thinke that they cannot be wise, except they visite and see farre countries, and except they can vn∣derstande diuers languages, and except they giue their eies to be∣holde, and their mindes to consider the fashions and manners of diuers peoples and nations, and except they had prooued many thinges: but the true wisedome requireth no man to trot hither
nor runne thither, for to bee talked with, but shee doeth offer her¦selfe vnto those which giue their mindes and vnderstanding vnto Pro. 2. 1. the woorde of the Lorde, for to beleeue it and obey it. Such men so attentiue and learned in the worde, which is our only wisedoe and prudence, neuer want wisedome, as Solomon doeth shewe it, saying, Wisedome is in the face, or in the presence of the wise: but hee that wandereth hither and thither for to make himselfe wise, is de∣stitute of wisedome and prudence: for hee is a foole: as Solomon doeth pronounce, saying, But the eyes of a foole, &c. Notwithstā∣ding wee wil not condemne the Queene of Saba of foolishnesse, for the voyage that she made vnto Ierusalem. For then there was wisedome but in Iewrie, where the woorde of God and his ser∣uant 1. Kings. 10 were, and that tyme there was no suche wisedome in al the worlde as was the same of Solomon. Our Lorde Iesus Christ also 1. Kin. 11. 12. Mat. 12. 42. hath allowed the voyage of the same Queene. Wee wil not con∣demne the Apostles of our Lorde, which wandered vp and downe through the worlde: for it was done at the commandement of Ie∣sus Christ, and was not taken in hande for to learne wisedome: for before that they departed from Ierusalem they were filled with the holy Ghost, which is the spirite of wisedome: but they went Acts. 2. 4. Esay. 11. 2. to winne wise men vnto our Lorde, by the preaching of the same wisedome wherewith they were indewed. Wee wil not also con∣demne those of follie which wanting this wisedom in their coun∣trie, seeke out the places, where God hath planted his pure worde, which is the true wisedome. 25 A foolishe sonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a hea∣uinesse vnto her that bare him. When Solomon hath alreadie so often reprooued the foolishe sonne, and praised the wise childe: and not contented therewith Pro. 10. 1. & 13. 1. & 15. 5. 2. doeth still rebuke the foolishe childe, hee sheweth wel that it is very needful that fathers and mothers, and all superiours and gouernours, shoulde bee very wise, that they may teache wise∣dome vnto their children, vnto their subiectes, & to those which
they haue in charge and gouernement. Hee sheweth also that it is a very detestable thing both before God and men, which haue any good feeling, that A foolish sonne, which by contempt of ho∣ly and honest, modest, and humble conuersation doeth vexe and torment his parents, to whome hee oweth al honour and reue∣rence, al obedience and submission, al pleasure and seruice. Hee sheweth further by so many reprehensions that the foolish chil∣dren wil not gladly bee amended, but doe delight in follie, and bee hardened therein by custome, and perseuerance in wickednesse. And thus follie is so familiar and acquainted with them that it is almost vnpossible for to heale them of it. Where∣fore let the fathers and mothers, and also al gouernours of youth, not bee slouthful and negligent. And when for to signifie the mo∣ther he saith, Her that bare him, hee doeth giue vs to vnderstande that there is greate ingratitude and vnthankefulnes, yea crueltie in the foolish sonne, when in vexing his mother, hee wil not confesse the great blessing that he hath receiued by her, when she did beare him, nine mouthes in her wombe with great paine and many sorowes, and that with extreeme trauaile shee brought him foorth into the worlde, and with great care shee did nource and bring him vp ten∣derly in his infancie and youth. 26 Surely it is not good to condemne the iust, nor that the Princes shoulde smite such for equitie. Wee might meruaile why Solomon setteth downe that which the most idiot and ignorant doth know and confesse, for a notable sentence and prouerbe. It might wel seeme that it were for nothing that hee hath pronounced such a sentence, seeing also that the most wicked doe agree theretoo. But the scripture requireth not onely confession of mouth, but true consent of hearte. Nowe though the wicked haue goodly shewes for to counterfaite themselues to bee honest and good men, and make vs beleeue that they woulde not consent that any righteous and faythful, little or greate, shoulde bee in any wise troubled,
because they knowe naturally that it is not wel doone: neuerthe∣lesse they ceasse not to be fleshed, to doe hurt and violence vnto the innocent, iust, and faithful man, they are of so frowarde and wic∣ked a minde, and conscience corrupted. And therefore, when So∣lomon saith, Surely it is not good to condemne the iust: It is not chiefly to teache vs that wee shoulde not condemne the iust: for the same is so wel knowne, that it may make those which do contrary vnex∣cusable. But it is to reprooue the tyranny and violence of the wic∣ked which haue authoritie and power, and to make them feele that they doe against their conscience. And this is chiefly directed vnto kings and lords of the earth, because that without regarde to right and equitie, they woulde haue al thinges to bee doone after their will and fantasie. Wee may thus vnderstande it, by that that hee maketh mention heere of smiting princes for equitie, by which are signified al good gouernours, which are often mole∣sted and pressed to pronounce wicked sentences, for the pleasure of their superiours. This serueth also for to admonishe kinges and su∣periours of the earth, not to do wrong vnto the righteous, but that they shoulde mainteine them, and conserue them: and that if they haue good gouernours and magistrates in their countrey and lord∣ships, that they shoulde admonish and stirre them vp to iustice and iudgement, rather then to trouble and torment them for iudging rightly. And herein we haue almost a repetition of the 15. verse, the which repetition is very necessary, for to rebuke the tyrāny & cru∣eltie of the great, the which is so deepely rooted in their heartes, that their wil standeth for a lawe. And when they which com∣mit euill, shoulde bee abhorred, chastized and rooted out, hee sheweth that wee shoulde not suffer tyrants to beare rule. 27 Hee that hath knowledge, spareth his woordes: and a man of vnderstanding is of an excellent spirite. There is neither man nor woman but doeth praise himselfe in his hart, & we all doe desire naturally to appeare learned, though we be ignorant, and feele and iudge it in our consciences: and euen
the most ignorant doe striue by many wordes to winne estimation and reputation. This is prooued by experience after diuers sortes: and amongst other wee shal see the sophistical doctours and dispu∣ters, 1. Ttm. 1. 4 & 6. 3 2. Tim. 2. 15 16. 17. 23 which woulde shewe themselues by long and diuers disputati∣ons to bee good diuines, whereas they vnderstande nothing of that which belongeth to God. Wee may thus speake of them after Saint Paule. And as touching humane artes, they which knowe least of them, wil speake of them most boldly. Solomon doeth shew vs wel, that wee must make no account of suche people, when hee saith, Hee that hath knowledge, spareth his woordes, &c. Where∣in wee must learne, that hee which hath true knowledge of any thing, speaketh not thereof at aduenture and vnconsiderately, but he markerh fit opportunitie, hee considereth how, when and before that neede requireth him to open his mouth. And heerein hee sheweth that he hath not a flying spirit nor senseles mind but a stai∣ed and setteled minde, which is not tossed aboue measure to thrust out wordes, but wayeth what hee hath to say. The same commeth of great excellencie, whereof they are partakers which are not de∣lighted with folly nor with ignorance, but are carefull to know and vnderstande profitable and necessary thinges: and chiefly by the worde, which is our wisedome and knowledge. Solomon doeth affirme it when he saith, And a man of vnderstanding is of an excellent spirite. Now forasmuch as the excellencie of the spirite is not giuen vs that wee shoulde hide it (for a candle is not lighted for to bee put vnder a bushel, but vpon a candlesticke: and it lighteth al that are in the house) let vs not thinke that when Solomon praiseth him which spareth his woordes, that hee woulde haue vs dumbe, nor that wee shoulde feare, as greeued to make our neighbours parta∣kers of our knowledge, and vnderstanding: seeing also that it is the nature and propertie of wisedome and vnderstanding for to com∣municate Pro. 1. 21 themselues: but hee would haue vs to speake wisely, the which dwelleth and abideth with discretion. 28 Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that stoppeth his lippes, is prudent.
Commonly fooles doe talke very muche, vttering not one∣ly vaine, friuolous, and pleasant thinges to the fleshe, but most often vngodly and wicked thinges, abhominable and detestable thinges: as flattering woordes, lyes, false witnessinges, slaunders, othes, per∣iuries, cursinges, blasphemies, and deniynges of God. This is the common trade of wicked fooles to vse suche filthinesse and infecti∣ons, and to spue them out of their stincking mouthes, because that their inward parts ouerfloweth: but the wise, which haue no desire but to please God, & to profite their neighbors, do diligently heare and are sober in wordes. They loue better to bee schollers and dis∣ciples, then to be maisters and doctours: except they know that Psal. 5. 1 their duetie requireth to speake, for to stoppe the mouthes of the wicked, and to instruct the ignorant, and to arme them, that after∣wards they may resist the euill speaker, as need and opportunitie shal require. Nowe because that in sobrietie of wordes their wisedome shi∣neth, when the fooles dissemblingly doe holde their peace, they are counted wise and learned: it is not therefore to say that they are suche: but if wee desire to shewe ourselues wise and prudent, as behoueth, wee must keepe backe thinges which are hurtful and bring damage, and which serue for nothing but to dishonour God, and to offende our neighbours. Solomon hath shewed vs the same. Nowe let vs note, that to shewe ourselues wise and pru∣dent in holding our peace it is not enough too vtter no∣thing Pro. 10. 19. 20. 21. that is euill: but wee must abstaine from al hurt, or rather to suffer with patience the iniuries and wronges, then to doe the same vnto our enimies and aduersaries, being assured that God wil not forsake vs, but wil deliuer vs at the time appointed: for the si∣lence that pleaseth God consisteth chiefly in patience, in faith and repentance.
The xviii. Chapter. 1 HE that is at libertie, seeketh freely, and studieth euery doctrine, for the desire thereof hee wil separate himselfe to seeke it, and occupie himselfe in al wis∣dome. IT is a common saying, whosoeuer hath a fellowe hath also a maister: for hee cannot doe whatsoeuer he would, but must sometimes dissem∣ble, and suffer thinges which please him not, and to leaue many workes that hee would gladly take in hand, because hee thinketh them either profitable or necessary, and must subiect himselfe and agree with his fellowe, for to mainteine familiaritie and friendship, and to haue peace, and to auoide and shunne greater hurt. Nowe if betweene felowes and companions the matter thus standeth bounde, it foloweth wel that hee which is bonde and slaue, cannot folowe his desires, but must yeelde himselfe subiect and obedient to the wil and commaundement of his maister and lorde, and cannot meddle with suche workes as come in his minde, but is bounde and tyed to the will of his maister. Wherefore it seemeth right, that there is nothing better then to bee at libertie that wee may doe according to our wil, and followe our counselles. And if wee doe make this accounte of corporall libertie amongest the worldlinges, the children of GOD ought muche more to set by their spiritual libertie, of the which we are depriued through the corruption of our nature, and are the slaues of sinne, our flesh Ioh. 8. 34. Rom. 6. 16 & 7. 14. Gala. 5. 17. consenting therto, & which to obey, it fighteth against the spirite: in such wise as we do not that which we would before God. But if wee wil be set free, & to do our wil at libertie, let vs take heede for
to separate vs from sinne, in not suffering it to rule in our mortall bodies: as wee are admonished. In this sorte wee shalbee deliue∣red, Rom. 6. 12. &. 13. 13. 14 Gal. 5. 16. 1. Pet. 2. 11. separated and made free for to followe our desires, which shall not bee to obey the fleshe and his lustes, but for to serue God wil∣lingly and gladly, according to his worde: which is al our doctrine: for in seeking it after our desire, and thrusting ourselues into the same by faith and good woorkes, we shall bee furnished with neces∣sary doctrine to get wisdome, knowledge and vnderstanding withal. And there is nothing that wee can desire further, except that wee shoulde perseuer and profite more and more in the same. But wee cannot attaine the ende thereof, vnlesse wee fight valiantly against the Diuel and the worlde, yea euen against ourselues. Saint Paule doeth wel giue vs this same to vnderstande, when hee woulde haue vs armed with al the armour of God, and when hee sheweth vs the Ephe. 6. 10. Rom. 6. 13. & 7. 14 Gala. 5. 17. cōtrarietie which is betwene the flesh & the spirit. Therfore when by the worde of the Lorde wee labour to reduce the corrupted and dissolute, they must not complaine that wee wil take away their li∣bertie, and make them subiects. 2 A foole hath no delight in vnderstanding: but that his heart may be discouered. The foolish, the number whereof is infinite, doe not delight, but to thinke wickedly, to speake vngodly, and to do workes abho∣minable. Pro. 12. 13. & 13. 16 & 15. 2. Solomon doeth signifie this same, saying, But that his heart may be discouered, which is filled so ful of vncleannesse, that he must needes spue it vp, and publish his folly. 3 When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche. When Dauid saith, The wicked hath made boast of his owne Psal. 10.  heartes desire, and the couetous blesseth himselfe: hee contemneth the Lorde, &c. hee declareth the nature of the wicked, and his ma∣ners, and kindes of doing, which are much vnreasonable, and ought not to bee borne withal. For it is not against man that he standeth
vp by contempt, but also against God: and is so vile, filthie and vn∣shamefast, that hee hath no shame at al, and careth not to spoile God of his honour, to whome onely wee owe all honour and glory, neither maketh hee any account to giue that which hee ought vn∣to his neighbours, but without conscience giueth himselfe to doe them iniurie wrong and violence, which is to dishonour them. For as the honour lyeth not in gesture of body, or wordes which haue some ciuilitie and faire shewe, but in readinesse and diligence of do∣ing our office and duetie towardes them: euen so the dishonour standeth chiefly when wee passe not to doe that wee ought. The Apostle Saint Paule very largely describeth this nature and maner Rom. 1 of doeing. And Solomon doeth expounde it in fewe woordes, saying, When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man reproche. Nowe as the wicked disdaineth euen so is hee disdained of GOD: and as hee doeth dishonour, so shal he bee dishonoured. This is shewed vs, when the wicked are com∣pared vnto hay, and to the smoke, and to dounge, and to goates. 1. Sam. 2. 30 Psal. 1. 4. Mat. 3. 12 Psal. 2. 4 Prou. 1. 25 Psal. 37. 2. 20. & 68. 3 Esay. 65. 5. Psal. 83. 11 Iere. 16. 4. & 25. 33. Math. 25. 32 And thus contempt and dishonour commeth with the wicked and vile man in two sortes: that is, that hee contemneth and is contemned: hee dishonoureth and is dishonoured. But the two sortes are not like. For although that by contempt and dishonor hee laboureth what hee can to set GOD and his neighbours at naught, and at perdition, yet his paines bringeth not foorth his effect, as he pretendeth, but fall vpon himselfe, as hee shal one day feele. Moreouer, let vs note that the lordes of the worlde are heere chiefly accused to bee wicked, albeit that for their authoritie and power they are declared honest and good men; and to bee villaines, though nowe they bee named noble, magnificent, worshipful, right honourable, high and mightie: for in their heartes they worship themselues, and thinke not that they are subiect vntoo God, nor that they ought to honour any man: but God can tell wel enough howe to beate downe their loftinesse and pride: as hath beene heeretofore alledged. Wherefore let vs take good Deut. 6. 13. Esay. 58. 7 heede from making ourselues beleeue that wee bee great and
noble, but let vs walke in al feare, carefulnesse, and reuerence, and let vs folowe the commaundementes and admonitions of our God Rom. 12. 10 & 13. 7 Phil. 2. 2. and of his seruants. 4 The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well spring of wisedome is like a flowing riuer. If wee haue neuer so little good feeling with good affection, wee desire to knowe and to vnderstande howe wee shoulde rule ourselues for to please God, and bee fruiteful and profitable vn∣to our neighbours: and woulde bee very sory if our vnderstan∣ding failed vs: but wee neede not to feare the same, if willingly wee yeelde vs Disciples and schollers of our Lorde, hearing them, whose mouthes hee hath indued with wisedome for too instruct vs: for as wee finde alwaies something to drawe out off hollowe and deepe waters and riuers abounding with waters: euen so in resorting to wise men, and diligently hearing them, wee shal neuer want doctrine, but shal haue abundance and grow in wisdome, and in al spiritual and necessary blessinges. Nowe also Solomon vseth the foresaide similitude, for to Prou. 1. 5. shewe vs the same, when hee sayth, The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters, and the welspring of wisedome is like a flowing riuer. Wherevpon let vs first note, that when the doctrine, the gra∣ces and giftes of the holy Ghoste, which are communicated vntoo vs by the mouth of the wise, are compared vnto hollow and deepe waters, vnto great and flowing riuers, out of the which it is law∣full, for euery man to drawe freely, the saide spiritual blessinges are freely giuen vnto vs: as it is plainely and openly declared, when Esay. 55. 1. Ioh. 4. 10. 14 the Scripture speaketh of gifte and of giuing. And thus, must not they which haue wisedome, and chiefly the Ministers of the woorde of God, be niggardes of this water, when they haue it in all abundance, and that they labour not to enriche Iohn. 7. 38. Mat. 10. 8. them selues by the communication of their owne wisedome,
but let them be contented to liue by their woorke. Secondly let vs note, that though the sluce be set open, & that we make no account of the water that runneth through for the abundance thereof, yet it is very necessary. Euen so, though that the worldlinges and car∣nal men doe despise the graces and giftes of the holy Ghost, yet with∣out them they shal perish. Albeit then that the holy Ghost doeth display and vnfolde his graces in diuers sortes and abundantly, yet it is not to say that wee must contemne them or loath them. Thirdly let vs note, albeit that Solomon sayth simply of a mans mouth, without adding eyther good or wise, or righteous or lear∣ned: yet ought it to be so vnderstood: as he himselfe doeth shew it, when he addeth, and the welspring of wisedome is like a flowing riuer. For out of the mouth of fooles, vnrighteous and wicked, commeth nothing but myre and durte, and not water. And also none is woorthie to be called a man, except that in his speech hee sheweth that the image of God, where after hee was created, is not altogether blotted out in him. The which the wicked wil not, nor cannot doe, but by their woordes they shewe that they haue the marke of the diuel their father. Let vs vnderstand therefore, that for to shewe ourselues men indeede, our woordes must be as cleare and cleane water. And for to doe this, let vs obey Saint Paule. Fourthly, let vs note that the vse of the doctrine and of the Sacra∣ments ought to be continually in the church, and those that are pla∣ced doctours and pastours in the same, ought to doe their office so Ephe. 4. 25 & 5. 3 carefully, that they should content and satisfie the thirstie people with the woord. For if we must quench bodily thirst through cha∣ritie, by a more strong reason ought we to refresh the thirstie soules: and that that, which the Prophet saith may be fulfilled, In the wilder∣nes shal waters breake out, and riuers in the desert: and the drye say. 35. 6. 7. & 44. 3. grounde shalbe as a poole, and the thirstie as springes of water in the habitation of Dragons. &c. Fifthly let vs note, that wee must diligently thinke vppon that which we must speake: for if wee speake at aduenture, insteede of drawing of cleere water, we shal draw puddle. And therfore it is not without cause that Saint Iames, woulde haue a man to be slowe in Iam. 1. 19 speaking, and hastie in hearing.
5 It is not goood to accept the person of the wicked, to cause the righteous too fall in iudgement. Man loueth himselfe so much, that he is naturally enclined to seeke his profit: and for to doe the same, he laboureth sometimes to be at the commaundement of those whose displeasure hee fea∣reth: sometimes he fauoureth those whom he thinketh wil bee profitable vnto him: and sometimes he beareth with those to whom he thinketh he is beholding & standeth bounde: & albeit that he is conuinced in his conscience, that they are wicked, and that hee can∣not be mainteined of them except he doe wrong to other: yet hee ceaseth not to haue this affection and to doe wrong vnto his neigh∣bour against his conscience. Amongest such people, the most per∣nicious are the iudges and gouernours of the lande which are led with flattering woordes, and desire to be commended and praised, which are led with ambition and vaynglorie, and which are coue∣tous, coueting to get riches for to haue credite, and to bee mightie. For this cause Solomon hath alreadie rebuked them, and nowe a∣gaine he reprooueth and accuseth them, when hee sayth, It is not good. &c. Wherein he speaketh like vnto Moses, and vnto other Pro. 17. 15. 23. 26. Exo. 23. 1. 2. 6. Scriptures alleaged alreadie heere before, which serue vntoo the greater condemnation of the wicked, which beare fauour and re∣gard, their like, for to depriue the iust of his right. For though the Scripture did make no mention that such kinde of dealings are wic∣ked, yet is there not so wicked a man that is not conuinced natural∣ly: seeing that al iudges would be esteemed that they doe iustice and iudgement: and if they had any iust cause or quarrel, they could tel well howe too condemne those which shoulde make them too loose it. 6 A fooles lippes come with strife, and his mouth calleth for stripes. Seeing that iniquitie doeth couer and close the mouth of the Pro. 10. 11. 32. & 11. 9 & 12. 6. wicked, and the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowarde thinges: and the hypocrite hurteth his neighbour with his mouth: The tal∣king
of the wicked is to lye in waite for blood: and a foole sprea∣deth & 13. 16. & 14. 3. & 15. 2. 28. & 16. 27. abroad follie: and in the mouth of the foolishe is the rodde of pride. And the mouth of fooles babbleth out foolishnes: and the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil thinges: and a wicked man dig∣geth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire: and seeing also that they which haue not their affections wel ruled and ordered, nor their passions wel tamed, but are vnpatient, can not suffer to bee contraried, and wil not dissemble that which displeaseth them, it is not without cause that Solomon saieth nowe. A fooles lippes come with strife, and his mouth calleth for stripes. Therefore if wee desire to doe as Saint Paule doeth teach vs, that is, to haue friendship and peace with al men, wee must flye backe from follie, lest it take roote in our heartes, and fil them therewith, so that from the abundance thereof, our mouthes speak flattering woordes, leasinges, slanderinges, false witnessinges, cur∣sings, and other iniurious and outragious woordes. For if suche thinges come out of our mouthes, and that wee should haue to do with men that woulde bee sodeinely mooued to anger, impatient and brainsicke, wee shoulde not bee without strifes and dissenti∣ons, without warres and battels. Notwithstanding, this is not to say, that wee must not continue stil to rebuke vices and wickednes with anger, sharpnesse and ri∣gour: and chiefly when they are committed with obstinacie, arro∣gancie and offence. Neither ought wee to care though some take suche reprehension iniuriously, cal vs fooles, and starte vp against vs: for the Saintes which are gone before vs, haue sustained suche combattes, and wee must followe them. And if wee must take heede for speaking foolishly, for to auoide strife and blowes, and to bee at discorde and hatred with our neighbours, by a stronger reason must wee beware of speaking foolishely before God. 7 A fooles mouth is his owne destruction, his lippes are a snare for his soule.
For to shewe that the vanitie and follie, that the malice and wickednes of the fooles woordes hurt him: and that the euil hee seeketh to doe to another by his mouth and his lippes, wherewith hee vttereth flatteries, slaunderinges, lyes, false witnessings, wanton and lasciuious woordes, vayne othes and blasphemies, shal fal vpon his heade, and that he shalbeare the punishment, Solomon vseth twoo similitudes. The first is taken from a thing, which may bee diminished and broken, and can by no meanes be repayred and set vp againe. And thus the fooles, are deceiued in their speaking: For albeit they knowe wel that they flatter and lye, yet they say, Wee wil preuaile with our tongues, our lippes are our owne: who is Psa. 12. 4. 5. Gene. 9. 22. & 11. 4. 21. 9. Psa. 31. 18. 19. & 35. 19 & 50. 17. &. 52. 3. Lorde ouer vs? But the holye Ghost demaundeth that the Lorde woulde cut off all flattering lippes: as hath beene doone towardes many: amongest the which wee may set Cham, the builders of Babel Tower, Ismael, Roboham, Sennacherib, Nabuchadnezer. And with these examples, wee haue also diuers threatnings. The second similitude is taken from beastes, which runne into the netes and snares, out of the which they cannot escape, and so must dye. Euen so the foole is taken by his woordes, and is con∣demned: Wherevppon followeth his destruction. But the thinges are not altogether like: For the beastes are simple, and thinke on none euil when they runne into the cordes, nettes, and snares. And so they perishe without their fault. And the foole by the vanitie and folly, by the wickednesse and abhomination Pro. 1. 17. which proceedeth and commeth out of his mouth, and his lippes doeth set cordes and nettes for his neighbours, which haue done him none euil: and therefore his iniquitie shal fal vppon himselfe, and shal perish therein. The preachers of the popish Church and the singers or quier men doe set snares for the poore sim∣ple and vnlearned: But at the last they shalbe taken therein themselues, with al those which seeke by their talebearing the Psa. 9. 16. Mich. 3. 5. destruction of their neighbours. After this sense we may say that this present sentence doeth folowe the former: for of strife and blowes doe come and proceede great ouerthrowes and
destructions: and because wee feare them, wee must be carefull to speake wisely: to the which let vs vnderstande that Solomon doth exhort vs: but after the opinion of some, wee are exhorted vnto fasting, abstinence, sobrietie and temperancie: for as they take it, Solomon doeth shewe the hurt that commeth of gluttonie & drun∣kennes, of the abundance and superfluitie of meates and drinkes, which passe through the mouth and betweene the lippes. True it is, that the gluttons and drunkardes doe kil themselues, and sende their bodies and their soules vnto perdition. Notwithstanding the first sense seemeth vnto me to agree best. 8 The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie. Solomon here sheweth vs, that the foole which medleth with slandering, and to beare false witnesse, and to carrie about wicked tales, doeth not onely seeke his owne destruction, but theirs also of whome hee speaketh sinisterlie: and it is chiefly his purpose to hurt his neighbours by his mouth and to destroy them. And for to shew the same, he vseth a similitude taken of a speare or lance which hur∣teth a man, and is so sharpe and pricking, that not onely it pearceth vnto the bones, but vnto the deepest parte of a man, and woundeth him to death. And heerein hee speaketh according to the Psalme. The similitude may bee taken from the poyson which hurteth the Psal. 52. 4. & 57. 5. & 59. 7. & 64. 3. & 140. 2. man, and pearceth to the bowels. Wee haue seene heeretofore di∣uers times, that tale cariers and slanderers, liers, and false witnes∣ses, doe bring great hurt, and worke great destruction: as wee may see it heere againe, when Solomon doeth compare them vnto mur∣therers and poysoners, which spare not the liues of their neighbors. Nowe if we must labour to flye suche kinde of people, which desire the destruction, either of our goods, or of our good name, or of our bodies, muche more them which labour to destroy our soules by false doctrine. And let vs learne, that as wee woulde haue none to hurt vs either with tongue or with weapon, euen so also let vs not hurt any other man.
9 He also that is slouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waster. Many through the world doe take their pastime after the flesh, permitting to themselues whatsoeuer they desire, in playe, in glut∣tonie and drunkennes, in slouth and carelesnes, in pleasures & vo∣luptuousnes: and care not at al to set their hande to worke, and to doe their office, after the state whereuntoo they are called: and yet they woulde haue vs beleeue that they spoile nothing, because their intent (as they thinke) is not suche, and that they commit no euil of set purpose. But if wee beleeue Solomon (as wee ought) we wil hold them for great wasters: for he calleth him which is slouth∣ful in his woorke, Brother of him that is a great waster. Where in hee sheweth that hee would haue vs to count the slouthful & care∣les for wicked wasters. And so hee priuily accuseth them to bee theeues & murtherers, and that rightly: for they steale that wher∣by they liue, seeing that they winne it not lawfully: and so much as in them lyeth, they kil the poore, for whome they should be care∣ful, and diligently to woorke. And so slouthfulnes or slacknesse, is no smal vice: seeing that hee which is giuen thereto, is not hurtful onely to himselfe, but also to his neighbours: though hee wil not knowe it. For if wee tel him which is slouthful at his woorke, that hee doeth not his duetie: hee wil answere, hee doeth wrong to none but to himselfe: wherein he belyeth Solomon, yea the ho∣ly Ghost which calleth him brother to the maister of wasting. Let vs then vnderstande that almen are admonished to be watchful and diligent in their vocation, and carefully to doe their office: & chiefly the fathers of houshold, Magistrates, & the Pastours of the Church: for the negligence of the maisters of the house, doeth so muche or more hurte in the housholde, then the superfluous and excessiue spending. The carelesnesse of Magistrates, hurteth as muche or more the common wealth at home, thā the enemies do with warres abroad. The slouthfulnesse of Ministers and their ignoraunce to∣gether doeth no lesse hurte to the Churche, then the crueltie of tyrantes, which striue to oppresse it by warre and violence. And
as the negligent and slouthful is like vnto a great spender and wa∣ster, euen so shal he be punished likewise: as it is shewed vs, in Mat. 25. the parable of the virgins and talentes. That wee may not bee of the number of suche, let vs watche carefully to doe our worke with prudence and faythfulnesse: as wee are taught in the saide pa∣rables. Mat. 24. 42. 10 The name of the Lorde is a strong Tower: the righte∣ous runneth vnto it, and is exalted. There is no man but desireth to liue in peace, and to bee out of danger of his aduersaries. And for to obteine the same, euerie man according to the power hee hath, doeth arme himselfe with leagues of friendship, and retyereth into strong places, and if he can, hee wil remaine in places which seemeth him inuincible. In olde time it was thought that the highest places were the surest, for that the enemies had not easie accesse to the same. We may see the same in the building of the Tower of Babel. Likewise Dauid signifying the safetie either that hee had had before, or that hee desired presently to haue, speaketh of the high Gen. 11. 4. Psa. 18. 3. 34 & 27. 5. 40. 3 & 16. 3. places and of high rockes, and heerein hee sheweth vs, that all our trust is and ought to bee set in one onely GOD, and when he keepeth vs, that wee are strongly armed, and defended against al contrarie power, and that there is no violence either earthly or hellishe that can hurt vs. Solomon doeth signifie the same, when hee saieth, The name of the Lorde is a strong Tower, &c. Wherein wee haue to note, that the name of the Lorde, is not this woord, God or Lorde, or any other worde that wee speake of, for to sig∣nifie that we speake of God: neither is it also this writing of foure Hebrewe letters, Iehouah, which the Iewes doe say, is the name of God, and that it is ineffable: And not knowing what this name of God ineffable is to say. (The which is none other thing then that there is nothing either in heauen, earth, hel, depthes vnder the earth, nor tongue, nor voice that is able to expresse the least prayse which belongeth to God, because of his great glory and excellencie) they obserue a foolish & foule superstition, and dare not pronounce
these foure letters aboue saide, and in their place they say, Adonaie But the name of the Lorde, is himselfe, as he is named the Euerla∣sting, Creatour, Gouernour, and disposer of al thinges: according as hee is called wise, iust, holie, mightie, merciful Father and Saui∣our: Gen. 4. 26. Exo. 3. 13. 14. 15. & 34. 6. 7. Deut. 6. 13 and according to the fame of these vertues & blessings which are without number, incomprehensible, and can not be expressed. The holie Scripture doeth shew it vs. For this word of God ought not to be called vpon. Hee expresseth wel this name. And when he would haue vs to sweare in his name, hee meaneth not this worde, God, or Lorde, in witnesse of trueth. His name therfore is himself, which is compared vnto a strong Tower: not as touching himself, that hee can or ought to be compared vnto any corruptible thing, howe excellent soeuer it can be: but the Lorde for to humble him¦selfe vnto our rudenesse and weakenesse, doeth compare himselfe vnto earthly thinges. As here by Solomon he is compared vnto a strong Tower, for to teache vs that as the worldlinges doe thinke themselues out of the danger of their enemies, when they are inclosed in a strong Tower: euen so, if hee keepe vs, wee shal not perish. Now for to obtein such safetie, we must fly al wickednes, infidelitie and incredulitie, al slouthfulnesse, and carelesnesse, and giue ourselues vnto al goodnesse, and with care & diligence com∣mende ourselues vnto the keeping and protection of our God. So∣lomon doeth teach vs this same, when he saieth, The righteous runneth vnto it, and are exalted. For the wicked, vnbeleeuing, negligent and contemners of the grace and helpe of God, are cast off from him: and thus they are not exal∣ted out of the dangers of their enemies, but are giuen vnto them to doe with them as they wil: as diuers wicked men haue felt, and doe feele. For if they be not at the wil of their carnal enimies, yet are they at their spiritual, to wit, the Deuils: as finally, they shall feele it in eternal tormentes, being thrust downe into the infernal gulfes. Let vs therefore vnderstande, that Solomon doeth exhort vs o loue righteousnes, and to delight therein, and that in folow∣ing Psal. 9. 16. carefully our vocation, and walking straight in our wayes, iwee should depend wholly vpon the protection of our God, and he
shal exalt vs high, and set vs in so strong a Castle, that our enemies shal not be able to doe any thing against vs: and also wee shal not feare them, but holding fast the promises of our God, wee shal say, The Lorde is my light and my saluation, whome shal I feare? Bee Psal. 9. 10. & 12. 6. & 33. 18. 19 & 34. 8. & 18. & 37. 39. & 27. 1. & 31. 2. vnto mee a strong Tower, and as an house wel fenced, for to saue mee. Let vs also vnderstande that hee teacheth vs to knowe who they are that are righteous, what their rewarde is. Whereupon we may gather who they are that are wicked, and what their destruc∣tion is. And when hee saieth not, Hee shal exalt himselfe: But he is exalted, hee doeth teache vs to renounce our merites and free wil. 11 The riche mans riches are his strong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination. Albeit that Saint Peter doeth teache vs, that al our strength and safetie standeth in the name of the Lorde: and that it is also the Act. 4. 11. 12 trueth, as diuers holie men haue prooued, and amongst other the people of Israel, as they doe acknowledge it with Moyses, yet the worldlings can not receiue it into their mindes, but despising what∣soeuer is saide of the prouidence of God, and of the care that God Exo. 15. 1 Psal. 48. 2. hath ouer vs, doe occupie themselues about that which they thinke, and looke for, and staye vppon that which they see, and thinke they can laye holde on, or vppon that which alreadie they haue possession of as they thinke. The ambitious wil think them¦selues to bee verie strong, and to be in safetie, if many doe com∣mende and prayse them, and bowe vnto them, if they haue cre∣dite, and that they thinke they are esteemed and had in admira∣tion. Wee might heere make a discourse of al the vices, and of al the vanities whereby men are so deceiued, that they make their fortresse of them: not so that they be truely assured: for if there commeth to them neuer so little affliction, but that they tremble as an Aspine leafe, though they shewe a great bragge: for the in∣fallible trueth hath pronounced, that there is no peace to the wic∣ked. Nowe leauing suche discourse, let vs come to consider the ri∣ches Esai. 48. 22.
of this worlde, the which of themselues are good, after the vse wheretoo GOD hath created them, and it is laweful to pos∣sesse them, and to vse them with thankesgiuing. If wee looke nar∣rowlie howe they are vsed, howe they are esteemed, wee shall see that they which are without them, or which haue not ynough, doe tremble and quake oftentimes, with feare they haue, either that the earth (as it is saide) shoulde faile them: or that if strife, dissenti∣ons and warres shoulde arise and bee moued against them, that they shoulde not haue wherewith to defende them: on the other side, that they which haue abundance of them, wherewith they are con∣tented as they seeme, except they haue the feare of God, and that they knowe howe they must vse the abundance of riches that God giueth: wee shal see that such kinde of people wil so abuse them∣selues, that they wil make of their riches their God, or themselues to bee gods: and wil perswade themselues to beleeue, that none e∣uil, howe greate soeuer it bee, shal light vpon them, but that they shal ouercome it wel ynough: for they haue this Diuellish opinion, that al things obey vnto money. And therefore, Solomon speaking vpon their opinion, saith, The riche mans riches are his strong citie, &c. Wherein So∣lomon doeth closely reprooue the opinion of the worldlings and carnal minded, which thinke and say, that the riche of the worlde are happie and good men: for when hee discouereth the imaginati∣on and fantasie of the riche, which is, to haue no trust nor assurance but onely in his riches: In that hee saith that the riches of the riche are his strong citie: hee sheweth wel that the worldly riches are not righteous: and so they are not good men, otherwise they would holde the name of God for a strong tower, and would thereto haue recourse and woulde not imagine their riches to be their strong ci∣tie, nor their high wall. In such imaginations there is no righteous∣nes, but all iniquitie, wrong, extortion, and violencee: for sith that they haue such imagination, and such estimation, of their riches, no thanke to them though they do not spoyle and rauish away the sub∣stance of other. And therefore it is not without cause that riches haue and beare the title of iniquitie, and that our Lord Iesus Christ Luke. 16. 9. 13 Mat. 19. 23. doeth set them against God, and that he doeth depriue them of the kingdome of heauen. Solomon then speaketh not of al rich men:
for many haue bene riche, which haue trusted in God, and haue ser∣ued him according to his woorde: but hee speaketh of those which contemne God and his woorde, and haue al their affection set and giuen to the riches of the worlde, of whose number Saint Paule woulde not haue vs to bee. Saint Iames also laboureth earnestly to 1. Tim. 6. 6. 17. 18. Iam. 1. 9. & 2. 5. & 5. 1. Po. 10. 22. &. 11. 28. turne vs away from them. Solomon also hath trauailed to pul vs away from them. If wee wil folowe and obey them, let vs take heed to chalenge to ourselues any force, as doe the riche worldly men: euen as Solomon doeth signifie it, when hee saieth, not simplie, a strong cite: but his strong Citie. Let vs not also folowe our imagi∣nation, for by it wee coulde not giue ourselues vnto goodnesse. As touching the rest, let vs note that Solomon doeth not here pro∣nounce what the riche ought to thinke or to say: as hath bene han∣dled. It shal not bee also vnfruiteful to note that Solomon hath compared the name of God onely to a tower: and heere hee com∣pareth riches vnto a Citie, which is much greater then a tower. It commeth not because that he esteemeth riches more then the name of the Lorde: but wee may say that it is because that the worlde∣lings and carnal minded esteeme more the temporal goods, and are more in loue with them, then are the righteous with the graces and giftes of God: and also that they which desire and loue riches, and thereuppon set their heartes, and trust in them, are much more in number, then are they that haue their refuge vnto God. And there∣fore, the riche haue need of a citie, where the righteous haue y∣nough of a tower. Moreouer, a citie which is often more faire to see too, & of greater shew then a tower, ought to be attributed vn∣to worldly riche men, for they wil bee greatly seene. 12 Before destruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlinesse. The first creation of man was very excellent, but hee remained not in this excellencie, because that he contented not himself there∣with. Ge. 1. 26. 27. Eccle. 3. 18. &. 7. 30. Now although that his posteritie did wel knowe that for hau∣tinesse of his heart he had destroyed himselfe, and al mankinde, yet did they make no count to humble themselues, and to yeelde obe∣dience
vnto their Creatour: and therefore a greate destruction fel vppon the worlde: as wee haue seene in al ages, from the be∣ginning of the worlde: the which is yet seene to this day: but the world doeth iudge such destructions and ouerthrowes to come by fortune, or through the desire and violence of men: and no man knoweth and seeth that it is God, who smiteth, to beate downe the arrogancie and hautinesse of mans heart. For this cause, Solomon doth admonish vs, & would haue vs to know that the ruines which happen vnto vs, come for the pride of our harts, when he saith, Be∣fore destruction the heart of man is hautie. &c. When hee pro∣noūceth this sentence, he sheweth vs that we should abhorre pride and arrogancie, not onely that wee shoulde shewe ourselues so by wordes, by workes, by gestures, and behauiour, but chiefly that the roote should be such from whence such fruites do come, the which lyeth in the heart possessed with hautie & hie thoughts, deliberati∣ons inuentions, & desires: but we perswade ourselues that wee are something. Seing that for such hautinesse, he pronounceth that de∣struction shal folowe, the which we in no case desire, but do shunne and feare it, he doth shew it (as is said) that wee should detest pryde so that we might truly say, Lord, I am not high minded, I haue no proude lookes. Thus doing we shal abace ourselues, & walk in hu∣militie of minde, the which shal make vs honorable, & shal exhalt Psa. 131. 1. vs vp to glorie: for the which to attaine and come too, we must not labour to shew ourselues, & to put forth ourselues after the man∣ner and custome of the worldlings, who counterfayting the humble minded, do praise themselues, and also woulde bee praised of other, either for their riches, or for their knowledge, or for their race and kindred, or for their credite and authoritie: but we must pul downe our harts, nothing esteeming ourselues: and it is necessarie that we shoulde suffer the worlde to count and holde vs as vile and abiects. For Solomon saith, Before glorie goeth lowlinesse. Albeit that many, as Abraham, Io∣seph, Moses, Dauid, & others, after hauing bin despised, yea & perse∣cuted, haue beene raysed vnto temporal glorie: yet by our lowlines and humblenesse, let vs take diligent heede not to looke for and de∣sire the same: but if walking in true humilitie of minde,
and being cast of & persecuted, it shal please God to rayse vs vp vnto temporall glory, and to make vs honourable before men, as he hath done these good men, let vs vse it as though wee had it not. The which we shal doe, if being raised wee shal procure and seeke the honour and glorie of God, the profit and saluation of our neigh∣bours, and if wee haue not set our affection vpō this worldly glory, we shal aspire and mount vp to the heauenly and eternal: for also it is the same which doeth chiefly folowe lowlines. And also the holy Scripture doeth not teach vs howe to come vnto glorie, by seeking honours and high roomes of this world, the which are good: pro∣uided that wee obteine them without desiring them: and beeing placed, doe behaue ourselues therein rightly: but by teaching vs to haue patience when we are despised, hated and persecuted in the world, knowing that such lowlines shal not long continue, and that after the same we shal enioye inestimable and eternall glory. As touching the rest, wee might heere alledge that which was sayde, Chap. 16. verse. 18. 19. 13 He that answereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and shame vnto him. They that haue nimble and light tongues, and can readily saye, whatsoeuer cometh into their minde, doe greatly delight to babble & to reason, to pronounce vaine, friuolous, foule, filthie, infamous, vngodly and wicked thinges: and are so swift and readie to speake, that they cannot suffer another to ende his matter, yea hardly to beginne: and yet they would be counted wise, and labour to cast of al shame from them: as though they did wel deserue to bee prai∣sed and honoured, for their readines or rather hastines, of their vn∣discrete babbling. And indeede they which are like vnto them: or which affect such babbling, doe praise them, and woonder at them, as though they were very eloquent, and were an honorable thing, and woorthie of praise to haue such nimblenes in tongue. But the holy Ghoste by Solomon doeth pronounce that they are but fooles and vnshamefaste, when hee saieth. Hee that an∣swereth
a matter before hee heare it, it is follie and shame to him. If they wil not or cannot confesse themselues to bee such in this life, and learne to heare, and to holde their peace, til neede requi∣reth them to speake, and that they knowe what and howe they ought to speake, they shal at last bee confounded, and bee silent be∣fore the greate iudge, whome they ought to honour by their tongues, in pronouncing with discretion and modestie things wor∣thy of subiectes and seruantes of God. And then they shal knowe that they were fooles and vnshamefast, but it shalbe too late: such knowledge shal nothing profite them, but for greater torment. Wherefore, forasmuch as it is needful to flye follie, and vnshame∣fastnesse, and that we shoulde feare to bee counted fooles and vn∣shamefast, let vs not offer to speake, before wee haue diligently hearde: let vs looke first to bee disciples, before wee take in hande to teache. Let vs marke the Psalme saying not, Come children and speake: but Come, hearken vnto mee, I wil teache you the feare of Psal. 34. 11. the Lorde. Wherein hee declareth that they which offer themselues to speake before they bee taught, haue not the feare of God, and that it is not possible that there shoulde come out of their mouthes any thing but euil. Let vs then take heede that wee offende not Psal. 39. 2. Iam. 1. 19. & 3. 2. with our tongues, &c. And because that it is a greate perfection in man, to rule his tongue wel, and that wee cannot of ourselues at∣taine theretoo, wee ought therefore to pray vnto the Lorde, Set a watche O Lorde before my mouth: and keepe the dore of my lips. Psal. 141. 3. It is the duetie of subiectes and of ignorant persons chiefly to heare. Therfore let children, seruants, and maides learne heere to bee silent, and to hearken: but principally for to giue obedience vn∣to them which may commande them. As concerning the rest, wee might heere apply that which hath beene saide before, chapter 17. ver. 27. & 28. 14 The spirit of a man wil sustaine his infirmitie: but a wounded spirite, who can beare it? The afflictions are not only troublesome to them which know not God, but also to the elect and faythful: as wee may see it by the fearefulnesse and trembling that they haue had, and by the com∣plaintes
they haue made, and by the admonitions which are made to them: amongst other we may alledge Abraham, Iacob, and Da∣nid, who were excellent men. But albeeit that the fleshe is troubled and grieued and mourneth vnderneath his burthen, yet neuerthe∣lesse a man of a good spirite knowing indeede that al commeth to him from the hande of God taketh a good heart, and beareth pa∣tiently and ioyfully the euil he suffreth. Solomon doeth thus pro∣nounce it, when he saith, The spirit of a man, &c. Heere the spirite, can not be taken for the soule: for al men haue soules, and for the greatest parte of them, they doe not patiently beare the euil that God doeth sende them: but wee wil take the spirite for that which is contrary vnto the outwarde man: that is say, for the inwarde man. This spirit wee cannot haue of ourselues: and therefore, let vs aske, Make mee a cleane heart, O God: and renewe a right spirite within mee. This spirite is the meanes, the strength and power which causeth our spirite strongly and manfully to beare al afflictions and aduersities, which happen in this life, and doe weaken and corrupt it, and cau∣seth that wee bee not grieued for any defaute that wee haue of ne∣cessarie things appertayning to the state of this life. It is the spirite that maketh vs not to bee effeminate, to bee afraide of our owne shadowe, for to make vs soroweful and to trouble vs with the least hurte that might happen: but giueth vs a mans hearte for to resist the temptations strongly, to suffer patiently the miseries, & ioyfully to beare the burthens that our outward man refuseth and reiecteth for his weakenesse. Beholde, howe wee must vnderstande the spi∣rite of a man wil sustaine his infirmitie, to wit of man. And also Solomon doeth giue it so to bee vnderstood, when hee asketh, But a wounded spirit, who can beare it? For against the spirit of man, hee setteth a wounded, sorowful, and grieued, and which hath no might, the which is the spirite or courage of effeminate persons, which are immediatly feared, and quake at the shaking of euery leafe, and weepe for the least griefe, and faint and fal vnder the least burthen that can be laide vpon them. It is vnpossible for man that hath such a spirite or courage so weake, that he shoulde bee able to beare any thing: seeing that his heart faileth him: neither is it possi∣ble for the outwarde man euer to bee able to resist. Let vs then vn∣derstande
howe Solomon doeth heere admonishe vs, that wee shoulde not bee afraide for the greatnesse and heauinesse of af∣flictions which happen vnto vs in this worlde: but that putting our trust in God, wee shoulde reioyce euen in the most hardest and troublesome time, being certaine that the Lorde wil giue vs a good ende. 15 A wise hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wise seeketh learning. It is commonly saide, that knowledge is a faire possession: and therefore many doe aspire vnto it and looke after it, as they thinke: but yet fewe people doe atteine it: for many in steade of folowing knowledge to be indewed therewith and to obteine it, goe backe∣warde, flying from it as from the pestilence, euen as do the simple and idiots in Poperie, when they dare, or wil not reade the holy scriptures, nor heare the pure trueth, lest they should bee poysoned ther with: and as doe the mockers and contemners, which wil not learne so much goodnesse, least they should be too wise, and breake their wits. These fellowes, what worldly knowledge soeuer they haue, yet are they ignorant: what carnal wisdom soeuer they haue, yet are they fooles. And thus they get not knowledge: and so long as they remaine in such fantasies, neither can they nor wil they ob∣teine her: for she entreth not but into the hearte of the wise, as So∣lomon doth pronounce it, saying, A wise heart getteth knowledge. Wee expounde this same of the pure trueth of the word of God, the which onely is worthy to be named knowledge. Notwithstāding we do not refuse the know∣ledge of men and liberal artes, which are giftes of God & serue this present life: but when wee haue learned them perfitly, yet are wee blinde and ignorant stil, except we haue the pure truth, and that we submit and subiect al other sciences, vnto the same. And therefore for to be partakers of this getting, we must not be like vnto brute beastes which haue no vnderstanding, but we must haue an hart of vnderstanding and knowledge. Solomon doeth teache vs what wee shal doe for to obteine this wisedome and learning, when hee saith,
And the eare of the wise seeketh learning. This is, that wee shoulde haue a true affection to know the wil of God by his word, and that for to attaine this knowledge we should become the schol∣lers and disciples of God, and of our Lord Iesus Christ, reading the scriptures, and hearing them diligently which purely preache the trueth. And let vs note that he calleth not them wise, which neede not to be taught, but those which haue a right affection to learne & to bee taught, otherwise they shoulde not neede to seeke for lear∣ning. Let vs also note that forasmuch as Solomō calleth knowledge a getting, he teacheth vs that in the same is great profit: seeing also that it is gotten by the wise, and that he hath his desire thereuppon: the which is signified by the hart. And also that we must not thinke a wise man wil set his heart vpon a thing of nothing and vnprofi∣table. And as touching the vtilitie and profit of this getting, wee haue seene it handled heere before in diuers places. 16 A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men. Solomon hath heeretofore rebuked the couetousnesse and vn∣iustice of Magistrates, Iudges, and gouernours of the earth. And be∣cause Pro. 17. 8. 23. that such wickednesses doe reigne and abounde in the worlde, and are rooted so deepe in mens heartes, that at al times and in al countries they haue spread forth their branches, and brought forth their wicked fruites: hee is not satisfied with the foresaide repre∣hensions: but to make these couetous, vngodly & wicked theeues, which occupie the seate of God, the more vnexcusable, hee doeth touche and reprooue them for this, that the poore which bring thē no giftes, are troden downe and oppressed, and as compelled, and not of free accesse, but onely they which bring giftes are best wel∣come, when hee saith, A mans gift, &c. Heere hee compareth the presenter of giftes vnto a messenger that is thought to bring some good newes, or that commeth from some greate Lorde: they wil make those stande backe which hinder him to passe and come neere, to doe his message: they wil giue place vnto him, and bring him to the kings chamber, and shalbe wel receiued, not only of the meane sorte, but of the king himselfe and of the greatest nobles of his
court. Euen so is it with him that bringeth giftes: he is wil come to∣wardes wicked iudges, they wil not let him tarrie and waite at the gate to catche colde, or for to be preassed and thrust of with one & then with another, which come and waite at the gate: but the gate is opened so soone as hee commeth, and is brought in. Hee calleth heere the wicked iudges and magistrates great men, because that God hath raysed them vp into authoritie, and that they are in so excellent an estate, that others are subiect vnto them: or that them∣selues Rom. 13. 1. doe praise themselues, and esteeme themselues so much, that they thinke none ought to come neere vnto thē, except they please. Nowe after what sorte soeuer he calleth them greate, yet doth hee put them in minde of their office, teaching them that they ought not to humble and abace themselues so lowe, as to become slaues & bondmen to giftes and presents: the which they bee, when they re∣ceiue them: for they do binde themselues to doe that wherfore the gift was giuen them, and cannot doe otherwise. 17 He that is first in his owne cause, is iust: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him. It is a very dangerous matter to haue to doe with an ignorant iudge, and such an one as either knoweth not his office, or is giuen lightly to beleeue one partie, and then careth not for that which may bee alledged on the other side, but wil condemne him howe good right soeuer hee hath: and hee that can get first to declare his matter, shal winne the day, though his right be not so good, & what complaint or request soeuer the other partie can make, and that hee declare howe hee ought to conferre the sayings and the allegations of both parties togither, for to knowe who hath the wrong case & who the right: yet shal it not bee hearde by a iudge that is light of beleefe and credit, or ignorant, or that wil bee corrupted by giftes, or by fauour of persons: and after this sorte, iudgement is violated and peruerted. Whereof Solomon complaineth, saying, Hee that is first in his owne cause, is iust, &c. It is not without cause that hee maketh this complaint: for the office of iudges requireth aswel to heare the poore as the riche, the stranger as his owne father, and the last aswel as the first: and to iudge euery man rightfully, and to
haue an equal balance for al men: for they are in the seate of God: & as King Iosaphat saith, Take heed what ye do: for ye execute not 2. Chro. 19. 6 the iudgements of man, but of the Lorde, &c. And this is according to that which is written in the lawe. But what commandement so∣euer Deut. 1. 16 there is in the law, yet the Iudges haue made no count therof: as we haue prooued. Wherupon also with Solomō haue proceeded many complaints & threatnings that God made by his Prophets, a∣gainst the iniquitie & wickednes of iudges: as hath bin alledged al∣readie. Folowing this sense then, wee wil take the iust, not for him which is so indeed, but for him that is iustified, & to whome right is giuen, & hath wonne his sute. Moreouer we wil take to make en∣quirie, for to complain and make a declaration, in enquiring howe his aduersarie hath gained his sute, and how the iudge hath not bin more careful to examine rightly their cause: or howe it is possible for thē which sit in the seate of God to iudge wickedly. Or, to make request, may be taken, for to make pursute, that his matters may be hearde and looked ouer againe, and that it may be taken in hand a∣gaine vpon a newe sentence, for to examine witnesses and to bring forth letters and contracts, for to shewe that hee hath good cause. But Solomon sheweth that such inquisitions shal nothing preuaile nor profite, when he saith, Hee that is first in his owne cause, is iust, &c. As some doe take it, Solomon would say, That hee which beginneth to pleade against his neighbour, thinketh he hath a good cause, and that he is iust, & therfore, that the iudge should giue sen∣tence on his side: but when his aduersarie is come, and the matter throughly examined, it shalbe founde otherwise. According to this sense, Solomon doth shewe vs that wee are to much affectionate to haue our cause founde good, and are blinded therewith. After the iudgement of others, this present sentence signifieth. That the iust doeth first accuse himselfe, and then is iudged of others: as Iesus Christ teacheth him. And after this opinion wee must adde, That Mat. 7. 1. the iust suffereth his neighbour to teach, to admonish, & to correct him: bycause he saith, His neighbor commeth, & maketh inquirie of him. So we are admonished not to take in hand to be maisters, but rather to suffer as little disciples and schollers to bee corrected, as Iames doeth ex∣hort Iam. 3. 1. Mat. 18. 15. vs. Notwithstanding it is not to say, that wee must not correct
those which erre, as Iesus Christ commandeth. 18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and maketh apar∣tition among the mightie. Solomon hath taught vs before that the lot is gouerned by the Prou. 16. 33. Lord: the which is a very necessarie doctrine, that wee shoulde not attribute any thing vnto fortune, but that wee should knowe howe things which seeme neuer so much casual, or chaunceable, doe come to passe as God hath ordeined, and that wee shoulde bee contented with whatsoeuer hapneth, knowing that it is the portion that God giueth vs, and which is profitable for vs: and that we should be cer∣taine that if God did knowe any thing more profitable for vs, hee woulde surely giue it vs, as a good father doeth vnto his children. Now when he saith, The lot causeth contentions to cease, &c. Hee doeth teache vs that if there bee any thing to be parted among vs, and for the which wee are in danger to goe to lawe, that rather we shoulde cast lots who should haue it, then to fight one against another with anger & malice, with hatred & enimitie. And heerin he something sheweth that it was not without cause that God did ordeine that the land of Canaan should be parted & diuided by lot among the children of Israel: it was a very seditious people, & hard to bee ruled and contented: as Moyses and the other gouernours did feele. But because wee haue not lotterie much vsed nowe, let vs learne by this sentence howe Solomon woulde not haue vs to bee at discorde togither, but that wee shoulde vse the meanes which God giueth vs, for to auoide al strife, and that wee shoulde not fol∣lowe our fantasie, but shoulde submitte ourselues by agreement vnto the iudge, or other louing and friendly arbitratours: and that wee shoulde stande vnto their iudgement, without nourishing hatred and rancour betweene vs. Beholde what wee haue heere to learne. As touching the rest, Solomon maketh mention of ma∣king partition among the mightie, to pacifie those which are obsti∣nate and hardened to the lawe, or to fight one with another, by lot. And heerein hee teacheth vs that the woorde of the Lorde ought to haue more authoritie among vs to set vs at vnitie
and concorde, then the lotterie: and also that it is farre better that the mightie of the earth shoulde agree by lot, then by violence and strife to obteine what they demande. 19 A brother offended is harder to winne then a strong ci∣tie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace. If al men, howe strange soeuer they bee one to the other, either in countrie, language, or linage ought to bee vnited in concorde, peace and friendship by lawe of nature, and by howe much as they are one like to the other, hauing beene created one like vnto the o∣ther, and hauing like affections: and albeit they haue diuers fathers & diuers mothers, yet are they al of one blood: by a stronger reason, Acts. 17. 26 brethrē which are of one fleshe, of one father and of one mother, ought to be careful to keepe & hold togither. The which Iuda consi∣dering, Gen. 37. 26. 27 saide, What shal this profit vs to kil our brother, and to hide his blood? for hee is our brother and our fleshe. And ought rightly to feare to bee diuided and separated through hatred and enimitie: for if betweene strangers, which agree not, there are discords and combats very hardly to bee pacified, yet are they much more harder to be appeased betweene brethren. Solomon doth signifie the same, saying, a brother offended is harder to winne thē a strōg citie, &c. For speaking thus, he sheweth that if a brother feeling himselfe or thinking to bee offended with his brother, doeth reuolt from him, and proclaimeth to bee his enemie, that there is no lesse, but more hardnesse to winne and quiet him, then for an armie to take a strong towne and wel fenced citie by assaulte, or to breake open the gates of a pallace, &c. And thus the brethren are admonished heere to be very careful to keepe brotherlie vnitie together, and diligently to fly al occasions of strife: and chiefly not to bee like vnto Caine, who without any iniurie offred by Abel, conceiued a deadly hatred, not Gene. 4. 8. & 37. 4. to folowe the children of Iacob, which coulde not suffer that their malice shoulde bee discouered by Ioseph. Therefore let vs fly al ha∣tred, anger, and rancour: for they that are intangled therewith, are of the number of murtherers. There are other literal expositions, Mat. 5. 22. 1. Iohn. 3. 15. but they al serue to shewe vnto the brethren howe profitable and
necessarie it is for thm to agree together, if they wil continue: for if they be wel ioyned together, they shalbe as it were iuincible. If it be thus amongest carnal bretheren, by a stronger reason, they that are brethren in Iesus Christ, and holde spirituall vnitie, shalbe for∣tified against all worldly and hellish power. 20 With the fruite of a mans mouth shall his belly bee sa∣tisfied: and with the increase of his lippes shall he be filled. Not onely man in the Scripture is compared vnto a tree, but also almost euery member of his bodie, as nowe Solomon maketh the mouth and the lippes like vnto a tree, or to his branches, or also vnto a peece of land, whose fruites and reuenues we gather. For he saith, With the fruite of a mans mouth, &c. In the which compari∣son he vseth Repetition, saying twice al one thing, after the maner of the Scripture, for a greater confirmation, and to shewe, that that which is sayde is very certaine, and shall out of al doubt come to passe. Wherevpon the faithful, which are wel instrcted to speake wisely and purely, ought to be rightly comforted, and the wicked which talke vanitie and lying, ought to be sore affraide, if they vn∣derstoode what Solomon pronounceth against them: for as tou∣ching the faithful which speake holy and honest things, as praiers, Psalmes, and spirtual songues, and al other woordes which serue too the glory and honour of God, and to the edifying of their neigh∣bours, they haue a promise that their woorde shalbe profitable, and shalbe rewarded so abundantly, that they shal not want any thing, and shal not neede to desire any more. Solomon signifieth this same when hee saieth, His belly shalbee satisfied. For as when the belly is filled with meates and with drinkes abundantly, he is full and desireth no more: euen so the reward of the good speaker, shalbe so liberal, that his desire shalbe accomplished for euer. For as in speaking trueth with his mouth, hee hath confessed God: euen so also hee shalbee confessed and knowne of God in the heauenly glorie, wherein Psal. 16. 11. & 17. 15. there is fulnesse of ioy, &c. Contrarily, the wicked which haue
euil mouthes, and venemous lippes, haue an horrible and feareful threatning, which is, that as they doe giue their mouths and lippes vnto euil, both against God and their neighbours: euen so also they shal haue al their fil of plagues for euer. By this same let vs knowe that it is no smal goodnesse for a man to gouerne his mouth right∣ly, Psal. 5. 7. 11. and also to talke wickedly is no smal euil. 21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, shal eate the fruite thereof. Euen as by violent smyting of the hands, we kil, euen so contra∣rily, in helping with them wee labour to preserue a man in life: and as it seemeth right that the euil wee suffer, and also the good which wee possesse, doe proceede from the handes, and that they are the instrumentes seruing eyther to wel doing or euil, euen so we trans∣ferre it from the arme, attributing it vnto the profitable or hurte∣ful member, of the handes: as when Solomon saith, Death and life, &c. Hee giueth an hande to the tongue, because it is a member that hurteth very much if it bee applied vn∣to euil: & contrarily it helpeth much, when it is wel vsed. This same is knowne, and is seene by experience: for in lying, flattering, slaun∣dering and false witnesse bearing against our neighbour, wee goe about to destroy him, and no thanke to vs which haue so vene∣mous tongues that our neighbours of whome wee haue spoken e∣uil, be not slaine. Contrarily, in speaking trueth, and by the same excusing our neighbours, which otherwayes were in danger of their persons, we haue preserued their life: as Ioseph, Dauid, & Su∣sanna, and others haue prooued it. Also in hauing wordes of edifi∣cation and wholesome doctrine in our mouths, we lead our neigh∣bours, who are wel edified, vnto eternal life. But though Solomon doeth attribute vnto the tongue, that it applyeth his hande vnto contrarie vses, the same is not to say that hee alloweth that the tongue shoulde bee a murtherer, except it be by accident, & against the minde and wil of him that ruleth his tongue: for there is no tongue so wholesome nor healthful that bringeth not death vnto the wicked, vnbeleeuing, obstinate and indurate, mockers and con∣temners
of trueth. And he shal smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lippes shal he slay the wicked. S. Esay. 11. 4. 2. Thes. 2. 8. 2. Cor. 2. 14. Ia. 3. 3. 9. Iames agreeing with Solomon woulde haue vs to apply our ton∣gues, to nothing but to goodnesse: for hauing made a complaint a∣gainst the malice of the tongue, he doeth admonishe vs not to vse it as the common sorte of men doe. If we wil beleeue Saint Iames, wee shal haue a good rewarde: otherwise wee shal haue plagues our belly ful: as hath beene handled in this present sentence: and as nowe Solomon doeth signifie it, when he saith. And they that loue it, &c. For wee loue the tongue according as the affections are ordered. Hee that hath an euil minde, wil de∣light to haue a venemous tongue: hee himselfe also shalbee poyso∣ned with his owne tale. Contrarily, hee that hath a good heart wil delight in wel gouerning his tongue, for the which, good shal come vnto him. 22 Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draw∣eth fauour from the Lorde. Wee ought to haue the estate of mariage in great reuerence, for diuers reasons. First of al, it is honorable. Secondly, it is not the de∣uice Heb. 13. 4. Gene. 1. 27. & 2. 24. Mat. 19. 4. Gene. 2. 18. 1. Cor. 7. 2. of man, but a worke and an ordinance of God. Thirdly, it is profitable. Solomon doth expresse this same in one woorde, when he saith, Hee that findeth a wife, &c. For there is nothing good which doeth not proceede from God, and whatsoeuer God doeth & ordeineth by his worde, for to bee obserued amongst men, is ho∣norable. But hee expresseth, yet more plainly that mariage is profi∣table, and that it is the worke of God; when hee doeth attribute is vnto diuine grace, saying, Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde. Wherein hee compa∣reth the grace of God vnto a fountaine, pit or riuer, out of the which wee may drawe abundantly. And this is for to shewe howe God greatly fauoureth them which are ioyned togither by laweful mariage: for seeing that it is so, that he which findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, it foloweth thereof also, that the woman which findeth an husbande, findeth also a good thing: considering 1. Cor. 12. 3. 8 Gene. 2. 18. that the man is the womans head, and the woman by the man.
But Solomon calleth the wife the good thing of the husbande, re∣specting the ende wherefore shee was created. And in this hee ad∣monisheth wiues priuily, of their duetie that they haue to giue vn∣to their husbandes, the which is, to bee altogither at theyr com∣mandement, and that they might vse them with al holynesse and honestie at their pleasure, as the good that properly belongeth vn∣to them. Let the wiues therfore obey perfitly vnto theyr husbands. Ephe. 5. 22. 1. Pet. 3. 1. And also Solomon admonisheth heere the wiues to bee fruitefull and profitable vnto theyr husbandes, to be of a sweete and louing conuersation. Wherefore the wiues must not heere bee deligh∣ted, as though Solomon sang foorth their praises, and woulde giue them to vnderstand, that their husbandes were bound to them: but wee must vnderstande that in praysing good wiues, he reproueth, rebuketh and blameth those wiues which doe not giue their duetie vnto their husbands, and sheweth that they are not worthy to bee called wiues, except their husbandes doe finde in them the good∣nesse that ought to bee in them. The husbands also are heere admo∣nished not to despise their wiues, but to haue them in good estima∣tion, and to loue them: seing that no man despiseth gladly the good thing that hee hath founde: and chiefly, when they which fauour and loue vs, doe offer and giue it vs. Let the husbandes therefore loue their wiues as their good thing, and not onely so, but much more effectuously, as they are taught. As touching the rest, let them Ephe. 5. 25. 1. Pet. 3. 7. that are wel maried, not thinke that they haue gotten this benefite through their diligence: but let them confesse howe it was the only grace of God that brought them vnto it, and caused them to finde that good gift. And let those which finde themselues not wel mar∣ried, take heede that they blame not mariage, but acknowledging their fautes, pray vnto God to remedie the euil that is betweene them. 23 The poore speaketh with prayers: but the riche answe∣reth roughly. When we thinke wee haue neede of any thing that our neigh∣bour can giue vs, and that wee hope hee wil graunt it vntoo vs, wee speake fayre and gently vnto him, and beseeche
him with al humblenes, declaring ourselues to bee his lowlie and humble seruantes, readie to obey him in al things. Solomon doeth expresse this humble maner, saying, The poore: he saith expresly, the poore, signifying first of al, that when man hath neede of any thing, and can not come by it, except it be giuen him, in this respect he is poore, howe riche soeuer he be in other thinges. Solomon then doeth shewe vs, that pouertie doeth outwardly beate downe the hornes of pride, the which is a vice naturally rooted in vs. Hee doeth also shewe vs, that we al ought to speake graciously one vn∣to an other: for by our creation we are poore. And if wee be raysed Iob. 1. 21. 1. Tim. 6. 7. Psa. 24. 1. & 50. 12. 1. Sam. 2. 7. 8 Pro. 10. 22. to haue credite and authoritie, to haue power and riches, this com∣meth not of ourselues: al commeth from God. And hee enri∣cheth whome hee wil: and the blessing of the Lorde maketh men riche. And therefore let vs vnderstande, that Solomon reprooueth the pride of worldly riche men, when he saith, But the riche answereth roughly. I say expresly of worldly rich men, whose number hath alwayes bene verie great: and amongst other, wee may set Pharao, Nabal, Roboam, Sennacherib and Na∣buchadnezer. The riche which haue the feare of God, are not puf∣fed vp with their greatnes, neither doe they esteeme themselues for their riches sake: and therefore they answere not roughly, but are sweete and gentle in their woordes: as were Abraham, and the holie Patriarkes, and the good Kinges of Israel, and others, which haue beene neuer the more puffed vp for the abundaunce of worldly wealth: but truely knowing that al commeth from the gift and grace of God, haue humbled themselues, folowing that which Saint Paule teacheth vs. They are then the riche men of this worlde, which answere roughly, not onely in woordes, but 1. Tim. 6. 17. also indeede and facte: as wee may see by the oppressions, violen∣ces and wronges they doe. Now that wee may not be of the num∣ber of suche riche men, which aunswere roughly because of their Iam. 2. 6. 7. & 5. 4. 5. 6. Rom. 12. 16. Phi. 2. 2. greatnesse and riches, according to that which Saint Paule tea∣cheth vs. And if wee must thus poorely behaue ourselues to∣wardes men, by a more strong reason must wee earnestly beseech God, as pooremen, destitute of al riches, but chiefly of such as are spiritual, and not to be puft vp with bragging of our merites in
the presence of the Lorde. Let vs truely make the confession that Luk. 1. 0 2. Cor. 8. 9. the Publican did, and let vs detest the boasting of the Pharesee. Thus dooing, wee shal not long remaine poore, for Iesus Christe wil in∣riche vs: As Saint Paule sayeth, Yee knowe the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, that hee beeing riche, for your sakes became poore, that wee through his pouertie might be made riche. 24 A man that hath friends, ought to shew himselfe friend∣lie: for a friend is nearer then a brother. We commonly say, it is a good thing to haue friendes, and that one ought to preferre thē before al worldly treasure: for it is an easie thing, to recouer goods, but not so easie to obtaine friends. And therfore if one be careful to keepe his temporal riches, and to main∣taine himselfe thereby, by a farre greater reason ought he (when he hath friends) to keepe them wel, and maintaine himselfe with them in amitie, being at their commandement, not in wordes onelie, but indeedes also, and trueth. Solomon speaketh so when he saith, The man that hath friends, &c. Heerein he regardeth, that God in his lawe, hath not giuen his commandements for a smal time, by the which hee teacheth vs that which wee ought to doe to our neigh∣bours, and howe wee shoulde maintaine ourselues in amitie with them. Wherefore let vs not thinke, that Solomon speaketh heere of table friends, of plaie fellowes, or other dissolutions, and wicked conspiracies. But hee speaketh of the friendes which haue learned by the worde of God to loue, and for his loue doe loue. He shew∣eth it when hee yeldeth a reason why one shoulde mainteine him∣selfe in friendship, and that hee saieth, There is a friend, &c. Table friendes are not so surely conioy∣ned, but they may be easily separated, by the least occasion that can be. But it is a harde thing to make those friendes which loue toge∣ther in God, and by his worde, to leaue one an other: for they are brought to loue together by the holie Ghost, which is a band indis∣soluble. And so, although carnal brothers fal out, and forsake one an other, yea, although they lift themselues vp one against an other euen to the death: notwithstanding, they that loue in the trueth, al∣though
they be not naturall brethren, yet they haue a sure and sted∣fast coniunction. Insomuch that they loue as muche, or more in ad∣uersitie, then in prosperitie. And so it is saide, that in a matter of neede, one knoweth his friend. Our Lord Iesus Christ hath shewed vs by proofe, that thus we ought to loue. The xix. Chapter. 1 BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuseth his lippes, and is a foole. HEere Solomon hath no regarde to speech, which is an easie thing, and wheretoo the wickedest wil accord in woorde, to the ende to get cre∣dite, and to be accounted wise: but if wee weigh more neerely the af∣fections, thoughtes, opinions, and phantasies of men, which are verie harde to rule and gouerne, wee shal knowe that Solomon saieth not so without great cause: for as it is daily seene, the poore man is in cō∣tempt, and out of fauour with al men: and be there neuer so much wisedome, prudence or foresight in him, yea, although it plainly ap∣peareth, yet is he reiected as vnprofitable, and persecuted as a wic∣ked person. And they which doe this, wil persuade themselues they doe wel, although the ordinarie talke goe quite contrarie. But men for the most part, speake as birdes in a cage, not vnderstanding what they say, nor receiuing fruite or benefite thereof. And thus while the lyers, deceiuers, flatterers, backbiters, sowers of false doctrine, and false opinions, shal haue the vpper hande, and be reputed ho∣nest, eche one shal desire to resemble them, because they are wel∣come, and muche accounted of. So see wee wel, that not without great cause Solomon saith, The poore man in his, &c.
Hee knewe wel that we had neede of such aduertisement, because there are verie fewe which make account of pouertie, and muche lesse of simplicitie, and purenesse. Pouertie also is a thing which of it selfe ought not to be esteemed: it ought (to the ende it may bee of some value) to be ioyned with a good conscience. For this cause Solomon hath wel foreseene, not to say simply, The poore man is better, &c. but he addeth, Walking in his integritie and purenes: for it is that which maketh the poore man, being nothing worth of himselfe, to be founde profitable and good, without the which he that is poore, can not but annoy and hurt, offende and endamage: but when hee is accompanied with integritie, hee contenteth him¦selfe with his estate and calling, and wil bee right sorie to offende any man, either in woorde or deede, stil desiring to doe profit and pleasure to his neighbours. And thus, Hee is better then he that abuseth his lippes, &c. For hee that is suche a one, not onely is vnprofitable, but also noysome and hurtful. As Solomon expres∣seth it, saying, Hee is a foole. For (as often it hath bene said) he calleth him foole, which is giuen to doe hurt, and delighteth ther∣in. And herein hee sheweth, that the peruersitie of the lippes pro∣ceedeth from the follie or wickednesse of the heart. And therfore shoulde wee laye away our wickednes, and walke in integritie: the which is ours onely, because it is giuen vs from God, and therein let vs delight. Let no man builde vppon his owne goodnesse, al∣though Solomon say, Walking in integritie. Besides this let vs note, that when Solomon setteth the foole a∣busing his lippes, a contrarie, to the poore man walking in his in∣tegritie: hee tasketh the riche worldlinges of follie, which is the wickednesse of the heart, whereby they depraue and abuse their lippes, wherewith they speake in pride and malice, and giue licence to their owne appetite to speake against God and their neighbors. Then to the ende we merit not to be tasked with such wicked and foolish persons, let vs loue integritie, and walke in the same, procu∣ring in all our woords and actions the honour and glory of God, and doing truely to our neighbours euery thing, as wee woulde they shoulde doe vnto vs: so that wee may say, I haue beene vncorrupt before God, and haue kept my selfe from offending him.
I haue lifted vp my heart to thee, In thee, my God, haue I tru∣sted. If wee walke thus, what pouertie, or affliction soeuer wee Psal. 18. 24 & 26. 1. haue, wee shal want nothing: for the Lorde God is our Sunne and Buckler. The Lorde spareth no good from them which walke in innocencie. Not because our owne righteousnes deserueth Psal. 84. 12. it. For although Dauid (after recital how God assisted him) saith, The Lorde hath rewarded mee according to mine owne righte∣ousnesse, &c. Psal. 18. 17 21. Notwithstanding, hee trusted not in his owne integritie, but in God onely, as hee sheweth it. Note we also that according to the foresaide exposition: when Solomon saieth, That the poore man is better, &c. hee speaketh of the goodnesse of the conscience, of ma∣ners, Psal. 18. 3. 31. 13. and behauiour, as wel in worde as indeed, and wil, that for this goodnes the poore man be esteemed, and preferred before the foole, be hee neuer so riche and mightie: As also God preferreth him. But the opinion of some men is, that Solomon prayseth more Psal. 34. 11 Luk. 1. 51. & 6. 20. Iam. 2. 5. the condition of the poore man, then of the foole, and that hee esteemeth the poore man walking in his integritie of life, to be more happie then the foole which abuseth his lippes. This exposition conteineth trueth, and dependeth of the former: for if the poore man be preferred by God, it foloweth, that he is in good estate, and more happie then the foole. 2 Desire without discretion is not good: and he that hasteth with his feete, offendeth. Those which are not instructed in the worde of God, but ledde by the sense of their owne corrupt nature, and according to the ap∣petite of the fleshe, haue diuers and sundrie desires, and haste, (as muche as in them lyeth) to attaine to the ende of them, and to en∣ioye them. They thinke stil, it is no hurt to desire that, which they haue in their phantasie, although they knowe not what the ende wil bee, neither if it be profitable for them to obtaine it, according to their desire. If the worlde reprooue and condemne not suche desires, the holie Ghost ceaseth not to blame and reiect them as vn∣profitable and wicked, saying by Solomon, Desire is naught, &c. And it is in folowing that which God forbiddeth.
Therefore seeing God hath giuen suche commaundement: it is Exo. 20. 17 not without cause that Solomon blameth it. For it is not lawful to make that good, approoueable, which God forbiddeth, whose onely wil should suffice vs, for the perfect rule of al iustice and equi∣tie. Likewise naturally wee perceiue, that in desiring we are pro∣uoked to strife and debate, if we obtaine not our desires, and enioy them at our pleasure. And therefore Saint Iames doeth worthily rebuke the couetous. But when we see, that the antient holie Fa∣thers Iam. 4. 1. (as Abraham) haue had desires, which haue not bene reproo∣ued, naye rather haue obtained according vnto them, yea more then Gen. 15. 2. & 12. 2. & 13. 14. & 21. 1. & 28. 20. 13. Psal. 50. 14. Mat. 6. 9. Psal. 145. 18. Rom. 3. 9. they could themselues desire: Hee desireth it according to discre∣tion, as appeareth by the promises, and so hee obteineth it, Iacob desireth that the Lorde God wil assist him, folowing heerein rhe promise made. Dauid desireth often to be deliuered from his e∣nemies, for hee knewe that God woulde that hee shoulde raigne in Israel. Also seeing it is Gods wil that wee shoulde cal vpon him, and that our Lorde God hath taught vs to praye, and that we haue the promise to bee hearde, wee shoulde and ought to vnderstande that Solomon blameth not al desires: for hee himselfe hath wished and obtained. And in this place he sheweth it also, when he saith not absolutely, Desire is not good: but hee addeth to it, Without discretion: as if hee shoulde say, That when wee wishe for any thing, whereof we haue not certaine testimonie in our consciences, that the worde of God alloweth it, suche wishe is not good. It is without fayth, which is the foundation of al goodnesse, yea the goodnesse of our desires, and without the same, it is impossible to please God. And by consequence hee imputeth it a sinne. And for this cause the infidels are frustrate of their desires: as many haue Hebr. 11. 6 Rom. 14. 24. prooued it, and principally the enemies of God, and his people, And the holie scripture yeldeth testimonie therof. The desire of the wicked shal perishe. Likewise, that it is not good to desire Psal. 112. 10 without discretion. Solomon sheweth it, when he calleth it sinne, saying, And he that hasteth. He saith the same that we haue expoun∣ded, but vnder other wordes, wherein hee speaketh by similitude. For euen as hee that runneth with his feete, without any other consideration, but that hee come to the ende of his race, and at∣chieue
his iourney, falleth and stumbleth against them that he mee∣teth, and so doeth them hurt: so he that is ardent in his desires, and boyling in his affections to doe a thing, not knowing whether it be lawful for him or no, is not cleare without damage, principally of his soule, & he troubleth & hurteth others, and so sinneth. And to accomplishe his desires hee doeth that wrong to his neighbours, which he woulde shoulde not bee done vnto himselfe, and he doth them not that good which he is bound to do, and which he would should be done vnto him, if hee were in the place and estate of his neighbours. And (which worse is) hee giueth not the honour to Gods prouidence: which is due theretoo, for hee distrusteth thereof, and hath al his whole endeuour on his enterprise and affections. Hee leaueth God behinde, and puts him backe, to the ende hee bee not letted to runne after his desires, which he would Psal. 38. 10. & 42. 2. & 119. 20. 131 Esa. 26. 8. 9. renounce, and bee coye to atchieue, if hee had God in his thought, and desired like the Psalmist, and Esay. 3 The foolishnesse of man shal peruert his waye: And his hart shal fret against the Lorde. It seemeth that the wicked prosper and doe their busines wel in this world: and therefore they are accompted honest, sage, & wise, which thing they desire and couet, and enforce themselues to ap∣peare so. Notwithstanding in their businesse, they neuer come to the ful ende of that they desire. And therefore they streine them∣selues, bee it right or wrong to obtaine their owne wil, and by this meanes they marre al. First, for them for they haue thoughtes and deliberations, which proceed from the malice of their consciences, the which Solomon calleth follie: Eliphas, guile and sutteltie: and Dauid, vanitie. Wherevpon enseweth, that they can profit nothing, Iob. 4. 12. 13 Psal. 94. 11. but must of necessitie be frustrate of their enterprises, & attemptes as one may see by the places afore alledged, and as Solomon pro∣nounceth it saying, The follie of man shall peruert his wayes: &c. Secondarily, as much as in them lyeth, by their follie and wickednesse, they doe al manner euil, to their neighbours where∣as
they shoulde doe good and bee sage to profite and helpe them. And so they peruert their way, practising and doing cleane contrarie to their office and duetie. Then as they are peruerse, so God is to them peruerse, not permitting them to come to the end of their en∣terprise Psal. 18. 27. as they woulde: And when they thinke sure to haue an end of the same, God ouerturneth al, and maketh the wicked feele, that it is hee that is troubled: & disturbeth them to dispose their waies, according to the appetite of their follie. Yea for that cause, he han∣dleth them so rudelie, that they knowe not in what taking they are, but they feele great resistance, whereat they are angrie, agrieued, and dispited. And although it seeme to bee against men onelie that they would deale: notwithstanding insomuch as they cast their rage against innocents, whose defender God is: they fret and fume a∣gainst him, not in wordes onelie, but they beare him a grudge also in heart. Solomon speaketh so when hee saith, And his heart, &c. One may wel say also that foolish men fee∣ling the iudgement of God to persecute them (because they can∣not shunne it) in their hartes, doe accuse God of ouermuch rigour, crueltie, and iniustice: and woulde that there were no God. And thus they chafe, & fret directly against the Lord. One may see these twoo kinde of frettings in Cain, he grudgeth against his iust brother Abel, and kils him: and then hee accuseth God of iniustice, and dis∣payreth. Gen. 4. 5. 1. Sam. 18. 8 And Saul beareth hatred against Dauid, whome he knewe and confesse, to be innocent, and persecuted him to the death: and finallie feeling that God had forsaken him, waxeth spyteful, and see∣keth counsel at the Diuel. Iudas waxed spyteful against Iesus Christ, the Lambe immaculate, and soulde him to be put to death. And af∣terwards through dispaire waxed frantike, and hanged himselfe. So∣lomon therefore sheweth vs that follie is a great wickednes, & that we ought to be careful to roote it out of our hartes: otherwise wee shalbe so vnaduised, that if our busines proceede not according to our desires, we shal fret against God to our owne confusion. There∣fore to roote out this follie, it behoueth vs to be attentiue to that sapience which is taught vs by the woorde, and by the same to learne, howe to frame al our waies, and words, to the honour & glory of God, and to the edification and health of our neighbour. Thus dooing GOD wil prosper our proceedings according
as hee shal thinke expedient. And although wee attaine not wholy to the ende of our enterprises, yet wee shall take well in worth al that which shal happē to vs, bee it prosperitie, or aduer∣sitie, and not grudge against God: whome Solomon heere calleth the Lorde, or the eternal. Wherein he signifieth that al things are subiect to him: and that it is meete, that without murmure, contradiction, or despite, al submit themselues to his wil, as to the rule of perfect iustice, knowing that what resistance soeuer we find or what affliction soeuer wee endure, al happeneth vnto vs by his wil and prouidence. And in the meane while hee ceasseth not to loue vs, assist vs, and keepe vs. And therefore in steede of grud∣ging, it is meete that wee say with Dauid, That if hee say to mee, Thou pleasest mee not, beholde mee, Let him deale with mee as it 2. Sa. 15. 26. Psa. 23. 4. & 119. 137. Iob. 13. 15. Gen. 3. seemeth him good. And with Iob, Although he kil mee. &c. Be∣sides, let vs take heede of striuing to exalt ourselues by ambition and arrogancie, as our father Adam did, who willing to bee like to God, peruerted his way, and is fallen from his dignitie, & excellency into a miserable estate: & feeling his misery, hid him from God, but seeing that hee coulde not escape his sight, hee laide al the fault vp∣on the woman, and the same vpon God, which is a spice of this murmuring and grudge. 4 Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is separated from his neighbour. Solomon saith nothing in substance heere, but that which he hath saide aboue: notwithstanding hee seemeth at the first shewe both there and heere to haue differed from that which hee hath said els where. But if we consider these sentences accordingly, we shal find that this present sentence, is as it were a declaratiō, by the which hee giueth to vnderstande, that many are freends to the rich, and that is not in trueth: for they loue the goods and not the per∣son, but onely because hee is rich, hee saith not, Man assembleth many freendes: But goods assemble, &c. One makes many fetches, one hath many gestures, one vseth many woordes, too make a man beleeue hee loueth him: and this while hath hee his heart fixed on his riches, and goods: And al that which one sayth,
and doth about the person, is no more but draw from it, that which he loueth: that is to witte, his goodes, his riches, his substance. One may knowe this by experience, for if the rich man become poore, they make no account of him, yea they studie rather to doe him hurt, and hinderance, then to ayde and profit him, as also Solo∣mon declareth it saying, But the poore man is separated from his neighbor or freende. Those which shuld loue him, hate him: they which shold help him, hurt him: those which should assist him, absent themselues from him: they which should defend him, persecute him: and so in verity the poore man hath no freende according to rhe ordinary course of this worlde. And therefore when Solomon speaketh heere, of the poore mans freende, he speaketh not of him, that is so indeede, for hee is inseparable, but of him that shoulde bee so, or that hath made semblant to be so. Wee see therefore that Solomon speaketh 1. Esay. 58. 7. not heere against that which is spoken of before in the seuenteenth chapter, and seuenteenth verse, for there he speaketh of the true charitie that one hath towardes his neighbour, which neuer chan∣geth. And heere he speaketh of the affection and loue, which men haue to the riches of the world, and sheweth that man is too vnre∣sonable when he preferreth thinges corruptible and transitorie, in∣sensible and deade, before that which is his fleshe, to wit, the image Mat. 8. 24. & 25. 35 of God which shineth in man. And not onely preferreth them be∣fore the image, but (which woorse is) before God himselfe whome he despiseth and hateth, when hee setteth his affection on riches. And so hath God the poore man in recommendation, that what∣soeuer one doeth to him, he reputeth it done to himselfe. Insomuch therefore, that wee ought to loue God aboue all thinges: let vs take heed of despising the poore, and of separating them from vs, to set our affections on earthly things, which when a man onceloueth, he cannot easily withdraw himselfe, but pursueth more and more. And so by this meanes it is somewhat practised that the freende lo∣ueth alwayes: for the auaritious loueth his riches at al times, and neuer separateth them from him: but when by the grace of God hee is changed and made a newe creature, following har∣tily al holy admonitions of the Scripture which tende to turne vs from couetousnesse. These thinges thus considered, wee may see
that Solomon rebuketh the worlde of auarice and crueltie: which cannot bee in a man without defiance and rebellion against God. 5 The false witnesse shall not be vnpunished, & he that tel∣leth lyes shall not escape. For our Lorde God is veritable, and loueth trueth, and that in the same hee doeth all his workes, and disposeth al thinges, with∣out any disguising, colouring, or counterfeiting: hee will that wee which are created after his owne image, shoulde be his followers, making shine that image in vs, conducting to veritie. To the which to sticke inseparably, it behooueth vs to flie and detest the contrary, which is lying. And though wee knowe naturally that we ought not to lye, neither to God nor men (for wee cannot abide that an otherlye to vs:) notwithstanding in that wee are so negligent to do our duetie, and that we encline more rather to corrupt this image, and to depraue our nature by lying, then to continue, & preserue it in trueth. For this cause to waken vs, and admonishe vs of our due∣tie, the Lorde God hath giuen vs his lawe by writing, in the which by two commandements hee forbiddeth vs lying, neither to his dis∣honour, nor to the detriment of our neighbour. Thou shalt not take the name of thy Lord God in vaine: Thou shalt not beare false witnesse. &c. To the first he addeth a threatening, and he ordeineth Exo. 20. 7. 16 Deut. 19. 1 a temporal punishment to the false witnesses, by the which he ought to vnderstande, that perpetual tormentes are prepared for him, if hee acknowledge not his fault and amende. For thou shalt destroy Psal. 5. 7. al them that speake lyes. These commandementes, manacing and threatning punishment, ought to suffice to conuert vs from al lying: but our nature is so wicked, that it weyeth not one warning. And therefore, after God had once giuen his lawe to Moyses: his wil was, that hee shoulde write the Deuteronomium, which is a repetition or declaration of the lawe. And not content herewith, he hath raysed vp diuers wise men, and Prophetes, who seeing the obstinacie of the worlde, and the stubbornenesse of it, haue incul∣ced the Lawe and threateninges by voyce, and by wryting: as is seene in the olde Testamente. And amongest others,
Solomon hath doone so, as one may see in many of his Prouerbes, and presently in this saying, The false witnesse, &c. In the which hee saith nothing, which hath not beene saide, and written before him in the lawe, as wee haue seene. Neuerthelesse we iudge not Psal. 5. 7. this sentence superfluous, seeing the world is so wicked, that it ma∣keth no account of fearing God, when it is so throughly warned. Wee shal learne therefore in this manace, that the false witnesse, backbiter, and flatterer, that those which swere vainely, forswere, and blaspheme, if they escape for a while the handes of men, and bee supported and mainteined, yet they cannot escape the fury and re∣nenge of God. Also the iudges, and gouernours of the earth, are warned to bee carefull to punishe suche people according to the lawe of God. Wee may comprehende vnder this manace, al false teachers. For their doctrine is but lyes to deceiue the soules, and false witnesse against God, in that they attribute not the honour to him which is his, but studie to haue it to themselues, and so trans∣port it to other creatures. 6 Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth. When wee thinke wee haue neede of any thing, or that wee couet more then wee haue, in that our natural couetousnes is cor∣rupted, and of it selfe insatiable, wee looke who they bee, that haue power to doe vs good, and who are most inclined to shewe themselues magnificent, and vseliberalitie. Towards such men wee play the poore, and humble, we reioyce them, and flatter them, sub∣mitting ourselues by wordes and exteriour gesture, wholy to their commandement. And because Princes, and greate Lordes are they which haue greatest authoritie, and which shew themselues ordina∣rilie most liberal, there is preasse to come to them, and many present themselues to doe them seruice, protesting that they are their hūble seruitours. Solomon expresseth this saying. Many hang vpō the face of the prince, &c. This is not to say, that he teacheth vs so to doe, for although it is meete wee bee subiect Rom. 13. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13. and vnder Lordes and superiours: notwithstanding wee ought not
to hang on their faces, for heerein is naught but hypocrisie, and dis∣simulation. And such a one hangeth on the Princes face, as dis∣praiseth him, and mocketh him in his hearte, who hateth him and woulde haue him put downe, for to bee in his place, if it were pos∣sible. For, to hang vpon the Prince, is not to do him honour and re∣ue rence, and to humble himselfe to him with free courage as one ought: But it is in considering his hautinesse and great power, his credite and authoritie, his goods and riches, his promptitude and li∣beralitie which are the face of the Prince, to play the wanton be∣fore him, to seeme to loue him, and to beare him good and humble affection, to the ende to bee supported by him, and drawe from him his riches, and bee in credite with him, Solomon expresseth this dissimulation and faire shewe, saying: And euery one is a freende, &c. For hee speaketh not of him that is a freend indeede, and loueth at al seasons. Hee that is such a one, regardeth not if one giue him, and affecteth it not, but hee is rather readie to giue, if necessitie require, then to take. He desireth giftes, but when great neede is, hee speaketh not (I say) of such a freende, but of them whome he hath treated of. Such freends loue not the person, but rather hate him, for if one giue not them as they desire, they are so actiue to take, that they imagine and re∣garde, howe they may get into their handes any thing. They are therefore freendes to the giftes, & not the to person. Although So∣lomon say that euery one is a freende to the man that giueth: and saith not a freende to the gift: notwithstanding, in that which wee haue saide, wee haue not gaine saide Solomon. For he speaketh not of that which is so indeed before God, but of that which appeareth outwardly to the eies, and of the opinion that they woulde one shoulde haue of them, which haunt the riche onely to get some of their substance: and so hee taxeth the hypocrites, flatterers and a∣uaricious, with whome the worlde is replenished. As also he giueth to vnderstande by these two wordes, Many, and euery one. Hee Esa. 9. 9. 17. Psa. 12. 2. 3. Iere. 6. 13. Rom. 12. 9. Ephe. 4. 25. Phi. 4. 8. maketh therefore stilly the complaints which are els where. Al are hypocrites and wicked, and eche mouth speaketh lauishly, and still also hee warneth vs, that wee walke in veritie towardes our neigh∣bours, And that wee loue without dissimulation, as Saint Paule admonisheth vs openly. Also those Princes which haue the power
to helpe the necessitie of the poore more then others, are warned not to bee so giuen to couetousnesse, that they turne the deaffe eare to those that haue need of their succor & aide: But according to the title which Solomō giueth thē heere (the which in his tongue signi∣fieth liberal & free willed) they ought franckly, & in a ioyful wise to distribute largely of their goods, not to minstrelles, Mirthmakers, flatterers, fooles, baudes and Ruffians, as the common vse of princes is to exalt and eleuate them to riches and honour that are nothing worth: but to the indigent and needie, which are commonly re∣iected and dispised, yea pilled and polled if they haue any thing at al. Princes & great Lords ought to be fathers to such poore afflicted, and to comforte them, deliuering them frō aduersitie & oppression, to the ende they may truely say with Iob, I haue deliuered the poore when hee cried, and the Orphan that had no aide. So euery one Iob. 29. 12. in his degre, according as God hath giuen him power, ought to fo∣lowe this which is saide of the Prince. For as naturally wee haue euery one the courage of a foolishe and ouerhardy prince: so it is meete that correcting our corrupt nature, wee followe in al righte∣ousnesse that which a Prince ought to doe according vnto God. Moreouer if they which loue their particular profite vse them¦selues so, that they shew themselues as friends to them that giue: by a farre more reason, if one helpe vs in our necessitie, wee ought truely to bee freende to them that haue pitie on vs, and to please them, and to shewe ourselues bounde vnto them. For if wee ought too loue our enimies, by a farre more reason shoulde wee loue them that loue vs and declare the same loue towardes vs, in communicating to vs, the goods wherewith God hath endowed Mat. 5. 44. them. If one loue a toole or instrument which hee findeth fit for his businesse, which cannot mooue nor stirre but when it is mooued, because it is insensible: by a farre more reason, ought one to like of the instrumentes of GOD which desire to bee hande∣led and conducted by the holy Ghoste, and take pleasure in doing good. If God (as it is true indeede) loue such persons, to whom hee is no way bounde, by a farre more reason ought wee too loue them, and do them seruice in that they haue neede of vs, & that we may stand them in steede either with counsel, or with the worke of
our handes according to the state whereto God hath called vs, o∣therwise we shoulde bee vngrateful. Moreouer when wee couet to haue freendes rather then eni∣mies, let vs be enclined to giue, seeing that as Saint Paule saith, It is meete wee remember the wordes of the Lorde, who hath saide, Act. 20. 35. That it is a more blessed thing to giue then to take. And if the worldlinges by vaine glory, which is a thing of no endurance bee prouoked to giue and bee liberall, not looking for any rewarde a∣gaine: by a farre more reason, Christians ought to bee mooued too liberalitie, considering the promise of the Lorde. If wee doe o∣therwise, Luke. 16. 9 wee are infidels, and cannot worthily receiue the Supper of the Lorde. 7 All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themselues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing. According to the common experience of the worlde, it is a miserable thing to be a poore man: for what necessitie soeuer hee hath, he shall scarse finde one which will haue pitie or compassion vpon him, and helpe his indigence, but rahter flee him and hate his companie. Solomon following the same experience, pronounceth it thus. It is a very lamentable thing to see the poore man so vn∣curteously and cruelly handled. But it is farre woorse, according to common proofe, when those which are of his owne fleshe and blood, not onely, haue no pitie on him, but also hate him. If it bee so (as dayly experience sheweth it) we ought not to maruell if those which thinke themselues nothing bounde but by neighbour∣hood and familiaritie, despise him and withdrawe themselues from him. Solomon expresseth this great crueltie, when hee saith, All the brethren of the poore, &c. When the brethren are faithfull, and haue the feare of God before them, they are careful to obey his lawe and commaundementes. And so Solomon speaketh heere of carnall brothers and infidelles, which haue their hearte on their profite altogether. If they haue brethren in necessitie, naked of aide and succour, they cannot see them: for they think that they let them, to come to their purpose: & therfore they hate thē & cannot
giue them a good worde, nor heare any request or complaint that they make, nor bee their intercessours in any matter of waight which wil doe them good: for they are so attentiue to doe their owne businesse, that they thinke if they should giue a good worde to their poore brethren, or heare their requestes, or complaintes, or beare any burden for them, it would hinder them greatly. Solomon expresseth this beastly barbarousnesse, and saith, Hee giueth cre∣dite to wordes, &c. Ioseph the sonne of Iacob hath prooued the like beastlinesse and crueltie, as his owne brothers confesse. But al∣though it bee so, and that Solomon rightly reproue the barbarous∣nesse and crueltie that one vseth towardes another: neuerthelesse Gen. 42. 21. what affliction and miserie soeuer the poore endure, to the death, yea, yet let them not dispaire, but consider there is a God in hea∣uen, which hath care ouer the poore that trust in him. Then see∣ing it is so, that God (who is father of vs all) hath suche care ouer the poore: let vs take heede that wee bee not of those brethren which hate the poore, nor of those felowes which withdrawe them¦selues Deut. 15. 4. Psa. 22. 25. & 34. 7. & 69. 34. 7. & 42. 9. from them. If the poore man vtter wordes, requiring vs to assist him, yet let vs not despise his request, as vaine or enuious, but giue him a speedie answere, not of the mouth, but of aide and suc∣cour, according as hee hath neede. Furthermore, let vs note, that where hee saith, All the bre∣thren of the poore hate him. This hate is very ordinary, and so commonly practised, that it is made a custome. And men way not whether they doe wel or il, and many hate the poore, which thinke it not. But they shal not therefore bee excused: for their owne con∣science accuseth them, that they are not so wel affectioned to∣wardes the poore, as they would one should be vnto them, if they were in that estate. And thus they beare not that good wil to the poore, that they thinke they doe. Whervpon ensueth, that they hate them, for betweene loue and hate cannot be any good meane. Be∣sides this, let vs note that although Solomon willeth vs to answere in words, or giue words to them which pray and speake to vs: yet notwithstanding hee woulde not haue vs to feede the poore with wordes onely: but hee sheweth vs, that if wee refraine them in speache, & spare our tongue, by a farre greater reason we wil grutch to aide them with our goods, which wee esteeme fatre more then
our words. Let vs not therefore be niggards of profitable speaches, but let vs loue principally indeedes and trueth. Iam. 2. 15. 1. Ioh. 3. 18. 8 Hee that hath a hart, loueth his soule, and keepeth pru∣dence to finde riches. There is nothing that wee loue so naturally as this presente life, and al that we thinke, say, or doe, tendeth onely to get where∣withal to mainteine vs in the same, and keepe vs in good health, and heartes ease: yet although this care bee naturall in vs, notwith∣standing wee prosper not, if wee haue not the hearte in good plight (as they say) indewed with natural vnderstanding, and that wee bee of a quicke wit, and foresight. For the foolishe and brainelesse sort, oft put their life in great hazarde, and in steede of finding goods, loose the same, and marre al they goe about: and if wee loue so much this brief and transitorie life, and the fraile and brickle goods, for the maintenance of the same: wee ought farre more to loue the heauenly life, and felicitie which is eternal: but of ourselues we cānot come to this loue, for we are fooles, wicked, negligent, & slouthful: and so we are loose of courage and faint hearted: wher∣vpon ensueth the destruction of our soules, and way to death: and to loue our soules wel, and to enriche them, it behoueth vs to bee prudent in heart, as Solomon saith, He that hath a heart, loueth his soule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches. But when wee haue naturally a lacke of hearte, wee cannot haue it of ourselues, because wee cannot or will not change our nature. That is the worke of GOD: as wee ought to vnderstande by his promises wherefore we ought to pray, Deut. 30. 6 Iere. 24. 7. Ezech. 11. 19 &. 36. 26. O God, create in mee a pure hearte, and renewe in mee the spirite of righteousnesse. And also by that which hath bin oftentimes tou∣ched, of him that wanteth heart, and is loose of courage. And by that which hath beene touched in the 15. Chapter, and the 31. 32. wee may and ought to vnderstande, that hee possesseth hearte, which is so instructed by the worde of GOD that by the same he hath sound iudgement, and good aduise to conduct himselfe, in the feare and reuerence of the Lorde, and hath a good will, and right
affection to yeelde himselfe obedient to God, and helpeful too his neighbours. He that is such a one, loueth his soule, and not as Worldlinges doe, and Epicures, which studie to liue at heartes ease, and haue the fauour and support of the worlde without any con∣tradiction, or resistance. Such men are much deceiued, as our Lorde Iesus Christe sheweth vs. But the man that hath a hearte, loueth his soule in such maner, that he hath a care to gouern it according Mat. 16. 24 Iohn. 12. 25. to the wil of God, prest to endure with pacience al maner afflicti∣ons which it shal please the Lorde to sende. In this manner hee kee∣peth prudence which leadeth him to those goods, which are proper to preserue his soule whom he loueth. Now the goods which he getteth, is the fauour acceptable to the Lorde, by the which hee obteineth, that his sinnes bee not im∣puted to him, but is made partaker of the iustice of Iesus Christe, by the which he commeth to euerlasting life. Let vs note in the rest that although there bee none but God, which prouideth of his owne meere grace and good wil, al that which is necessary for vs for the time present, and the time to come, aswel for our bodies, as our soules. Notwithstāding this letteth not, but with sound iudge∣ment, prudence and good aduise, wee may followe those meanes by the which wee prouide for this life, and doe that which is good and necessary for our health. For it is no inconuenience that GOD doethal, and wee bee his instruments by the which hee worketh. What heart then soeuer wee professe, what prudence or vnderstan∣ding wee haue: let vs reknowledge in veritie, that it is onely God which willeth and accomplisheth: and to him let vs giue all praise and glorie in al thinges. 9 The false witnesse shall not escape vnpunished: and hee that speaketh lyes, shal perish. Beteweene the fift sentence of this Chapter, and this, is no diffe∣rence, sauing in the ende of the fift sentence, there is Shall not es∣cape, and in this Shall perishe, which is the exposition of shall not escape. And so this is here a repetition not vnprofitable to the wel disposed: for they are againe warned, that God greatly detesteth false witnesse bearers and lyars, and therefore they to bee careful to
thinke and say, the trueth, and flee all lying. This repetition also ser∣ueth to make the false witnesse bearers and lyers more blame woor∣thy, when they haue once despised so many warninges, and not ta∣ken heede to amend. 10 Pleasures are not seemely for a foole: much lesse for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes. Although the wicked which despise true sapience, and are there∣fore called fooles, haue commonly good store of goodes, eyther by succession, or giftes, or by their owne industry, and that they enioy them in delight and heartes ease, at theyr owne pleasure: and that because they spende the time gallantly and make good cheere: they are therefore accompted worthy to liue, and haue abundance of ri∣ches: notwithstanding because they haue not the feare of God with them, and be not his children, it were more fit for them to haue no riches at all. And that which they haue, they vsurpe it wrongfully by what title soeuer they possesse it. Wherevpon ensueth, that they cannot vse it, nor rightfully enioy it, at their ease and pleasure. So∣lomon pronounceth it, saying: Pleasures are not seemely, &c. As when we know any one to be a thiefe, & liue by robbery, we can∣not, nor ought not to allowe his wickednesse, nor affirme his life good and honest, but rather iudge it disordinate, and detestable. So before God, who knoweth the foolish, it is not found fit, that they liue at their pleasure and ease of theyr fleshe although hee permit them as is seene: For there is none in the world, according to out∣ward apparance that haue more their pleasures then the foolish and wicked. And as God which knoweth all, alloweth not that the foo∣lish haue their pleasures to the damage of the miserable & afflicted: Euen so, when God hath opened the eyes of his seruantes and principally those which he hath lifted vp in preheminence, and geuen too vnderstande the wickednesse of the foolishe, they ought too detest and hate those fooles whome they see so at theyr ease. For they cannot enioy the delightes of this worlde without greate disorder. And although a man cannot per∣ceaue it alwayes, yet it ceasseth not to boe a greate hinderaunce
to the feeble, simple, and innocent of whome the foole makes no accompt, but rather studieth to afflict & vex them, pilling, and pol∣ling them, or refusing to pleasure them to enioy the better his owne ease and pleasure. Then if pleasures are not seemely for fooles, who notwithstāding seeme fit to enioy them, because they are rich or of noble parentage, and in authoritie, or because afore time they haue taken paynes, to liue lastly at their ease: If to such people (I say) pleasures are not seemely, by a farre more reason it is not fitting, that inferiours shoulde enterprise ought, against or aboue their supe∣riours, to put themselues in their ease, or haue their pleasures, to the preiudice of their superiours. Solomon sheweth this, say∣ing, Much lesse for a bounde man, &c. By the name of bondman hee meaneth al inferiours, as children, housholde seruants, wayting men, Chamberlaines, subiects and vassailes, which are bounde to o∣bay, feare, & honor them that are in power by Gods appointment, and whome they ought to serue without grudge, or contradiction, and as much as in themlyeth, worke their delightes, which are prin∣cipally in bearing rule, without resistance, or rebellion. For great mē of the earth, & al those that haue preheminēce as kings, princes, ma∣gistrates, gouernours, fathers, mothers, maisters, & rulers, although they haue many cares, and great trauaile to maintaine themselues in their principalitie, notwithstanding they haue no greater pleasure, then when their subiects and Inferiours worke no sedition against them, but endure in al humilitie, their rule and goueruement: which to enioy, they take thought and deliberate, they payne and trauel themselues, and spare for no cost, esteeming this as nothing, so they may beare rule: for they knowe, that in gouerning, they may doe as please them, and obtaine al their desires, euery one beeing at their commandement: and thus they shal enioy their pleasures. The foo∣lishe thirst after such pleasure. But of what power, or calling soe∣uer they bee, it is not seemely for them, but rather requisite that the wise beare rule ouer them and tame them. Wherevppon enseweth that which Solomon saieth, That much lesse ser∣uantes which are slaues, and of the most vile and abiect condi∣tion of the world, are meete to gouerne & beare rule ouer princes:
But they and all inferiours ought to humble themselues, and by their obedience reioyce their superiours, for they ought of free will to submit themselues: as Saint Paule teacheth them in many pla∣ces. One may also say that if the foole be in prosperitie and haue his ease and delightes, yet can he not vse them as he ought: Much lesse can a slaue of seruile condition, beare rule ouer princes, and order them as he ought. Let vs note first of all, that pleasures are not forbidden if we vse them soberly, and without excesse: for God hath not giuen riches vnto man onely for to vse them, but also to reioyce and take his pleasure in them. And so haue the Saintes, not onely vsed them for necessitie, but Leu. 23. 40. Deut. 16. 12 also for delight, and yet soberly, to the ende the dissolute and ouer∣lauish, should not take occasion thereby to woorke excesse. Se∣condarily let vs note, that to inoye our pleasures wel, and to be ca∣pable thereof. We ought to detest and hate folly, and aspire to wisedome, giuing ourselues to the same. For we cannot haue the true vse of pleasure, if by wisedome wee bee not taught how to vse it. Also there is no true ioy, nor delight but in wisedome, who a∣lone maketh vs to inioy it, as is aboue seene. Thirdly, let vs note that seruantes ought to be content with their state, vntil such time as they may lawfully fet free themselues: and whiles they bee in 1. Cor. 7. 20. 1. Tim. 6. 1. seruice, to thinke their maisters worthie of al honour. Fourthly, let vs note that sith the pleasure of princes is in bearing rule, they ought to exercise no tyranny. 11 The foresight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes passe. Seeing wee are al the children of one father, wee ought there∣fore al to desire to resemble him: and as hee is to vs gentle, gracious and pitiful, so ought wee to bee one to another: as our Lorde Ie∣sucs Luk. 6. 36, Ephe. 4. 1. & 5. 1. Col. 3. 8. 12. Christe admonisheth vs, and the Apostle Saint Paule, But wee cannot so followe our heauenly father, if wee bee not indued with prudence and foresight, as Solomon sheweth wel, when he saith not a man doeth defferre his anger, but the foresight of a man, &c. Hee sheweth also that it is God which leadeth man to bee courteous and gentle: For foresight, or wisdome or vnderstanding, is of God.
Hee sheweth thirdly, that he which is soone mooued to anger, hath no foresight, but is frantike and foolishe as hee sheweth it by folly Psal. 4. 8. Pro. 2. 6. indeede. Solomon expresseth this more plainely els where, and when hee addeth, And it is his honour, &c. Hee sheweth that the man well grounded in vnderstanding and foresight, excelleth in charitie to∣wardes Pro. 12. 16. &. 14. 29. his neighbours, who haue offended him, when not onely hee easily pardoneth them, and putteth in obliuion al their faultes and offences, but also hath great ioy, and esteemeth himselfe happy, to bee in good concorde, and vnion with them, that haue wrought offence towards him. In this hee is a right follower of his heauen∣ly Exo. 34. 6 Luke. 15. 4 father, who is saide to be a pitiful God, merciful, slow to anger, ful of mercie and trueth, &c. Besides this, note we that Solomon vseth here a similitude, takē of thē which haue any voyage to make in hast. As they that take no care to breake down hedges, or fil vp brookes & ditches that lye in their way, but leape or passe ouer thē: so if we will worke by good aduise, and make our voyage to the heauenly kingdome, let vs not stande to examine to the vttermost, euery in∣iury that is doone to vs, thereby to incurre hate, debate and strife, and to take vengeance on them that offende vs: otherwise we can∣not come where we woulde or shoulde come. For if wee pardon not men their faultes, our heauenly father wil not pardon vs ours. Mat. 6. 14 15. 20 Where one may say, hee vseth a similitude taken of persons puisan and valiant, to whom it is an easie thing to ouercome their enimies, and ouerunne them. It is fit wee resemble them, as Saint Paule ex∣horteth vs. One might bring in heere that which is saide aboue, Chapter 10. & verse 12. & Chap. 14 ver. 29. & Chap. 15. ver. 18. & Rom. 12. 19. Chap 16. ver. 32. & Chap. 17. ver. 9. 12 The kings displeasure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the grasse? Solomon teacheth heere two things principally. The one that subiects and inferiours shoulde take heede least with their wicked∣nesse of life, they doe prouoke their princes iust indignation a∣gainst them, and that by holy conuersation, and true obedience, they
studie to winne their fauour, and make that they be to them, helpe∣ful and profitable, as the deawe profiteth the grasse, making it waxe greene, encrease, and multiplie, and keeping it from the heate of the Sunne, which otherwise woulde burne and drie it vp. Neuerthelesse, this is not to say that wee should flatter kings and princes, and make them drunke with their owne greatnesse and glory: as the common tricke and practise of them is, which wil creepe in credite with the Lordes of the earth, and make their owne profite by them, in putting back and detracting their neighbours. But it behooueth vs onely to humble ourselues to our superiours, and yeeld them that obedience which is due to them by Gods appointment. Thus doe∣ing, if they bee not tyrants, wee shal profite by them: and although they bee tyrants, yet God wil not let our obedience to bee in vaine, and altogether vnprofitable, but wil make that what inhumanity or crueltie soeuer they execute against vs, yet shal they not deuoure vs as the Lion doth the pray which hee holdeth in his pawes, and wil make vs prosper, and liue at our pleasure as hee shal see expedi∣ent. One may see this in Pharao king of Egypt, and the children of Israel, in the wicked kings of Iuda and Israel, & in the Prophets. The second is, that Kings, Princes, and Superiours are aduertised of their dueties, which is, That they ought to be mooued to wrath and an∣ger, and rore like Lions in threatninges condemnations, and pu∣nishments towards the wicked, which liue disorderly in dispraising and blaspheming God and his worde, and in iniuring and offending their neighbours. Contrariwise they are aduertised, that they ought to be pleasant, gracious, & courteous towards the good, & to keep them from iniuries, and outrages of the oppressions, and violences of the wicked, as the deawe keepeth the grasse from the heate of the Sunne. And as the deawe maketh the grasse to grow and augment: so kings and superiours of the earth ought to bee careful to make the simple, iust, and the innocent prosper, and principally according to the soule, in rooting out of their countrie al reprochful persons, and being careful to cause that GOD haue audience by preaching of his woorde, and that good order bee kept without exception of persons, and true religion obserued. Moreouer, let vs con∣sider, that if God woulde that wee shoulde bee suche towards our
superiours, it behoueth vs to bee farre more humble, and reuerent towardes him: for hee is king of kinges. And if hee appoint vs superiours, and commaunde them to bee rigorous, or gentle, accor∣ding as occasions serue: wee ought to vnderstande by farre more reason, that he is such a one towards men as hee declareth to vs, in his worde. Who desireth a more ample declaration, then hee hath set downe, in the sixteenth Chapter, verse 10. vntil the ende of the 15. verse? 13 The foolish childe is the fathers sorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping. It liketh not many fathers to watche and warde their children, and to keepe them vnder, to learne them to bee wise. They haue this foolishe opinion, that they shoulde let them doe as pleaseth them: because being younge, they may spende the time merily, and liue without melancholie. They thinke that if one should presse them to vnderstande wisedome so soone, they woulde bee leane, and pensiue, dul, and blockishe, and not haue a quicke wit, to thinke, say, or doe any thing pleasantly, nor shewe themselues lustie gallants, or mery companions, as they ought. And therefore such fathers de∣spise God & his word, and are also the cause that their children are mockers and contemners of al iustice and holinesse, and so they sinne against the holy Gbost. For this cause they receiue their pay∣mēt of care which they haue had to entertaine their children in fol∣ly, and wickednesse: whereat they bee greeued and much vexed as they wel deserue. They haue graffed the tree with euil graffes, and therefore they eate the fruite of anguishe and sorow. Solomon expresseth it wel, saying: The foolish childe is the fathers sorowe. Hely hath proued this: notwithstanding it is not to say, that if fathers be afflicted & receiue griefe by their children, who are not wise, that it proceedeth alwaies 1. Sam. 2. & 3. &. 4. Gen. 26. 34. 35. &. 28. 8. 9. of the fathers negligence: for behold Isaac who hath beene grieued with the follie of his sonne Esau. Beholde also Dauid afflicted by his sonne Absolom. Solomon reproueth not here only the fathers, which do not their dueties to teach, admonishe, correct, and chastice, their children in
time, to make them renounce follie, and giue themselues to wise∣dome: but hee sheweth also to the foolishe children, that they are disobedient, and rebellious to the commandement of God, which wil, that the childe honour the father and mother, which is not on∣ly to make them some signe of reuerence, by gesture of the bodie, or by woordes of the mouth, but that they be indeede humble and o∣bedient to their fathers, and mothers, doing them honour and re∣uerence without faining, assisting them carefully, and being wholy at their commandement in the Lorde, as they are bounde, and as the holie Scripture teacheth them in many places: and as it hath bene treated of heretofore in diuers pointes. But the foolish childe in steede of dooing this good and honour to his father and mother, doeth displease them, woorke their woe, and hinder and endamage them, as Solomon sheweth, when hee saieth, The foolishe childe, &c. And heerein hee giueth to vnderstande, that the childe that is suche a one, is to be holden vnwoorthie to liue vpon the earth: and that Magistrates according as the lawe commaundeth, ought to put too their hands and punish him, yea with death. And although men doe not their duetie therein, yet God which is iust, wil not leaue suche iniquitie vnpunished, but wil worke his horrible ven∣geance, and most terrible iudgement vpon suche a childe. Where∣fore, insomuche as wee loue our children, let vs chastise them be∣times, and that it be not long of vs, that they shunne not that ru∣ine. Solomon also sheweth, that fathers and mothers ought not to esteeme it a thing of smal value or litle importāce, that their chil∣dren are fooles: but to account it a great misfortune and greefe: Not so muche for the damage and dishonour they haue thereby, as for the zeale of the glorie of God, and edification, and saluation of their children: for they ought to preferre this aboue al temporal ri∣ches. Of foolishe children hath bene spoken heeretofore. Solomon addeth, And a brawling wife, &c. Although brawling and contenti∣ous wiues, and which lift vp their voice on high, to iniurie and of∣fende Pro 10. 1. &. 13. 1. 15. & 1. 5. 20. & 17. 21. 25. their husbandes and neighbours, thinke not that they doe il, because they haue this as a custome, which they haue incurred either by lightnesse or pride, not regarding to render due honour and obedience to their husbandes, and humblenes and humanitie
(as they ought) to their neighbours, neuertheles their brawlinges are most hurtful, and cause of great ruine and destruction. Although one prooue it but too muche, yet Solomon leaueth not to shewe it, when hee compareth the brawlinges of a woman, to the couer of a house, which is so broken, that when it raineth, the water droppeth in, on the planckes and walles, and rotteth them: so that the house is readie to fal, and maketh great ruine and destruction. So when women are giuen to contention and brawling, they are cause of great euil, as is daily prooued: but besides this proofe, one may see it in Iezabel. In this example wee see, that brawlinges light not on them onelie whome they are meant too, but on them also, which make them. 1. Rom. 18. & 19. & 21. 2. Rom. 9. 1. Pet. 3. 4. 3. Cor. 14. 34 1. Tim. 2. 11. Ephe. 5. 22. Wherefore wee may vnderstande, that it is not without cause, that women are warned to be peaceable of spirite, and Saint Paule wil haue them to holde their peace. Therefore to bee in silence and subiection, let them folowe the admonition of Saint Paule. Wo∣men, be yee subiect to your husbandes, as to the Lorde. Wee may see by this that hath bene heere handeled, that it is verie requisite for a father of an housholde to bee watchful, both ouer his wife and children, to the ende, to keepe them in wisedome and modestie. For if his children bee fooles, and his wife a brawler, hee is double mi∣serable. 14 House and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a discreete woman is the gift of the Lord. Although God is the Creator, disposer, and gouernour of al thinges, yea, of countries and regions, and that hee giueth king∣domes Dan. 2. 21. & 4. 14. Gen. 13. 15 & 15. 7. to whome it pleaseth him: and although God had giuen to Abraham the lande of Canaan, and that the children of Israel were the heires of Abraham: neuertheles, after the death of A∣braham, Isaac, and Iacob, God suffered not to bee saide, that hee gaue, or woulde giue to the children of Israel, the saide lande for inheritance. I say this, because it might seeme at the first shew, that Solomon transferred to creatures, that which is proper to the Crea∣tor, when he saith,
The house, &c. But the resoluing thereof is easie: for one may say that Solomon speaketh according to the phrase of speeche of children, which succeede their parents in the goods which they haue possessed and left them. Or that hee speaketh according to the lawe of nature, which is, that children shal succeede in the wealth of their fathers. But this lawe is not so natural but that it procee∣deth from God, who is authour of that nature, which is good and reasonable. Likewise the order of succession is of his ordinaunce, Gen. 12. 7. & 15. 15. & 15. 4. & 21 10. 11. 12. Leu. 25. 44 Num. 27. 6 as wee finde written in many places. Although therefore God giue al thinges both to the fathers and to the children: notwithstan∣ding, in that hee hath ordained, that the children shoulde inherite the goods that their fathers haue possessed, for this cause the hou∣ses, and riches which they leaue to their children are called, The heritage of the fathers. And heerein one transferreth not to the creature, that which is proper to the Creator, seeing hee himselfe calleth it so. And so it happeneth often, that fathers trauel and take payne, to assemble and get goods together. And for this onely, because they haue chil∣dren whome they couet to prouide for. And therefore one may say, that Solomon speaking so, hath somewhat admonished chil∣dren not to waxe proude, for the goods which they possesse, and wherewith they are enriched, not hauing trauelled for them: but that they knowe that they haue them by the care and diligence of their fathers, vnto whome God, and none but God gaue them. And that afterwardes by their meanes, hee hath put them into their handes, to dispose and spende with sobrietie, and aide therewith them that taste necessitie. But although God wil, or permit that children acknowledge their riches to bee the heritage of their fa∣thers: yet hee wil not that the principal temporal good of this worlde be reknowledged of any other but of him alone. Solomon sheweth it, when he saith, But a discreete woman, &c. That a woman is the princi∣pall temporall riches that a man can haue, GOD giueth to vnderstande, when hee saide, that it was not good for man to bee alone, when hee called her the aide of man, and when hee Gen. 2. 1 made her of one of his ribbes.
Saint Paule also sheweth it, willing that men shoulde loue their wiues, as Iesus loued the Churche. And wee ourselues ought to knowe it, when by the woman, man obteineth issue, and is made a Ephe. 5. 25. father which is no smal blessing, as may bee seene by the desire that the holie fathers had to haue progenie, and the promises that God made them therof, which could not haue bene accomplished with∣out a woman. By these reasons wee may also vnderstande, that a woman, and principally the discreete, is not the inheritance of the father, but the excellent gift of God. For first, it is not in fathers to Deut. 28. 4. 11. Psal. 28. 3. giue wisedome to their daughters, although their office be to in∣struct and teach them in the feare of the Lorde, which is the prin∣cipal wisedome, and vnderstanding prudence proceedeth of the on∣ly grace and liberalitie of the Lord. Secondarily, for the most part, fathers are not so careful to finde wiues for their sonnes, for feare of forgoing any portion of goods which they possesse. Or if they doe, they searche them out riche wiues, not those that are discreete. Although therefore, when one wil marrie himselfe, it behooueth him with care and diligence, and with great discretion to regarde with whome hee match him, and that hee ought not to proceede at randon, nor as one carelesse and without foresight, yet when we haue found a good and honest par∣tie, it is fit wee acknowledge that shee is come intierlie by the grace and mercie of our God, which giueth vs foresight and aduise∣ment to conduct vs rightly, and to seeke that which is good and profitable for vs. And in the meane while, hee maketh vs meete with that which he thinketh good. Abraham knew wel this same, as he sheweth it, when hee sendeth his seruant to take a wife for his sonne Isaac. And sith it is meete we haue suche reknowledging, those which haue discreete wiues, ought to preferre them before al Gen. 24. 7. goods of the worlde, otherwise they despise not onely the creature, but the Creator, whose gift they esteeme not as they ought. On the other side, if the wife be discreete, she wil reproch her husbande in nothing, but in al humilitie and modestie, wil acknowledge first, that she hath no discreetnes of herselfe, but of the gift of God Se∣condly, although it be by her consent that she is maried: notwith∣standing, it is God that hath ioyned her to her husbande, to the ende that by her prudencie, shee bee his aide and consolation, ta∣king
the care of the house vpon her. 15 Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a sleepe: and a soule accu∣stomed to craft, shal suffer hunger. It may seeme at the first view, that this sentence fauoureth them that loue sleeping: teaching them howe they shal prouoke sleepe, and enioy that which they loue: but seeing that slouth is vaine, vn∣profitable, hurtful, dishonest & wicked, (as one may perceiue here∣tofore) and that it is not good to be giuen to sleepe: wee ought to knowe that Solomon argueth heere the sluggishe, shewing them whereto they serue, to wit, to nothing but to occupie a place, Pro. 6. 6. & 4. 5. 26. & 12 11. 24. 27. & 13. 4. & 15. 19. and bee as it were a let, and domage. Also hee threateneth them pouertie and want, whereof they bee wel woorthie: as hath bene aforesaide. And Solomon partly pronounceth it heeretoo, when he ioyneth the slouthful to him that is giuen to fraude, saying, And a soule accustomed to craft, shal suffer hunger. It might seeme at the first viewe, that this coniunction is not agreeable, and that Solomon might haue made an Antithesis, putting the slouth∣ful, which ceaseth and wil doe nothing, a contrarie to him that is accustomed to craft: for he that goeth about to deceiue his neigh∣bour, and make his owne profite by the hurt of an other man, is not asleepe, nor yet giuen to rest, but is ful vigilant, and taketh great paynes. I answere. True it is, that herein the slouthful and the craf∣tie, are contraries: but they sticke not to agree in some pointes: for as the craftie by taking payne, getteth and snatcheth away o∣ther mens substance. So the slouthful, by taking his rest, depriueth his neighbour of that succour and aide hee ought to shewe him. And as the slouthful coueteth much, and hath nothing but pouer∣tie and want, and suffereth much, as he wel deserueth: so although the craftie man get goods abundantly: neuerthelesse, his fraudes and rapines, wil not serue him, but he shal suffer hunger, partly be∣cause hee shal neuer haue enough, partly because God wil not suf∣fer him to enioye his desires at ful. And yet although in this life hee had his desires to the vttermost, yet finally, hee shalbe in ex∣treeme indigencie, as is written of the riche man.
Let vs not therefore learne to sleepe heere, but rather to watche: nor to take our rest, but rather to labour: nor to deceiue, but ra∣ther Luk. 16. 24 to folowe fayth and loialtie: and thus dooing, wee shal not suffer hunger, but shal haue suche suffisance as wee shalbee content withal. 16 Who so keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne soule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, shall dye. If wee take, (to keepe the commaundement,) to fulfil al that which God hath commaunded vs in his lawe, there is none which can keepe his soule: for there is none that can so keepe the com∣maundement. Saint Paule sheweth it wel in diuers places. If there∣fore wee wil knowe howe it behooueth vs to keepe our soules, it is Rom. 7. 14. & 83. Gal. 5. 17. necessarie wee knowe, howe wee shoulde gouerne ourselues to keepe the commaundement. Solomon sheweth it when he saith, Hee that regardeth not his wayes, shal die. To the keeping of the commaundements hee putteth the despising of his wayes, a contrarie. Whereby we may gather, that to keepe the comman∣dementes is, to haue a firme affection to serue God first of al: and next his neighbour, according as God hath taught vs by his word: to haue care to renounce al vnbeliefe, and to assure ourselues of the bountie and loue of our heauenly father towardes vs, by the meane of Iesus Christe, to be careful to forgoe al wickednes, and to giue ourselues with al our power to doe wel, according as God hath commaunded in his lawe. Whosoeuer keepeth so the com∣maundement, although sinned wel in him, and that hee be in great fault, as wel in his fayth, as in his affections, thoughts, & works, yet neuertheles his faultes shal not bee imputed to him, to suffer thereby any detriment: but he keepeth his soule to euerlasting life. For dooing so, hee loueth God, and God loueth him, hee dwel∣leth with God, and God with him. Meanewhile, let vs not thinke Ioh. 14. 23. that suche keeping of the commaundement, is the cause of keeping of the soule, and that by suche keeping of the commaundement, wee deserue the conseruation of the soule: but onely that it is the
meane to keepe the soule to life euerlasting, the which we obtaine because God loueth vs in Iesus Christe. The loue of God is the onely cause of our saluation. Although then, that in keeping the commaundement, one keepeth his soule: that is not to say, that for any dignitie there is in vs, or for any thing that wee thinke or doe, wee may merite with God to be reserued in life. Now there∣fore, sith wee vnderstande what it is to keepe the commandement, it must needes bee easie vnto vs to vnderstande the neglecting of the way, which is contrarie to this: and not to make account of al that which God hath appointed vs by his worde, which tea∣cheth vs euerie thing what wee ought to thinke, wil, beleeue, saye, or doe: which thinges are the wayes of God, insomuch as hee hath ordeined them: and conducteth vs in them: and they are ourwaies because we ought to walke in them, and be assured not to perishe, when wee perseuer in the same. And because that of Psal. 91. 11. ourselues, wee doe nothing but erre and goe out of rhe way, wee ought to pray, Lorde, make mee vnderstande thy way, and teache mee thy footepathes. And to acknowledge in all humilitie. Lorde, Psal. 25. 4. Iere. 10. 25. I knowe that the way of man is not in himselfe, if wee doe other∣wise, wee regarde not our wayes: and so wee cannot assure our¦selues that our life shalbe saued, but we must looke for death. For he that regardeth not his wayes shal die. One may also applie this sentence to life and death temporal, for if wee bee ohedient to our rulers and gouernours, they are bounde to preserue vs from the violence of the wicked. Contrari∣wise, if not making count of doing our duety, wee liue dissolute∣ly, theyr office is to vse the sworde agaynst vs, For hee is the Minister of GOD for thy wealth: but if thou doe euill, feare: For hee beareth not the sworde for naught, for hee is the minister of God too take vengeance on him that doth euill. Rom. 13. 4. Note we, that although it behooueth one to renounce him∣selfe, too keepe his soule, notwithstanding hee must not renounce his wayes, but those which hee hath followed, o∣beying Mat. 16. 24. the corruption of the fleshe. Suche wayes are dis∣pleasaunt vnto GOD, and because of them, the Sonne of God hath suffered death. And seeing it was needefull and necessary that
the Lambe immaculate, should be so cruelly handled to deliuer vs Gen. 6. 5. Isa. 53. 4. from the eternal perdition, which wee had deserued by our corrupt wayes, it is good reason that wee hate and abhorre them, and that wee retyre ourselues from them, making our wayes good. Thus doing, we shal not despise our owne wayes, we shal not go astray Iere. 7. 3. &. 18. 11. Eze. 18. 23 & 33. 12. Ps. 1. 1. & 119. 1. from that which God demaundeth of vs. And so wee shal not dye, but be blessed and happie. 17 Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it shalbe paide him againe. Our good God beareth great loue and fauour towardes them that are poore and needie: as the holy Scripture testifieth, & as hath beene alledged in the law in the Prophetes & Apostles of foretime. But men make no account of their aduertisements and admoniti∣ons, neither doe they feare their complaintes and threatnings, as is seene by the smal account that they make of the poore, by the op∣pression, outrage, and violence, that the poore strangers, orphans, and widdowes indure. And that which is cause, why these poore are so despised, reiected, and misused, is the malice, ingratitude, and crueltie of men, who are so readie to their particular profite and so greedie of gain, that they think if they pill not thē, which cānot de∣fende themselues, they make not their market halfe wel: and if they shoulde ayde the weaker sort any whit at al, or giue any almesse to the needie, who haue not wherewithal to requyte it againe, they shoulde susteine great losse and neuer be able to recouer it. Thus by their disordinate desires, they tende stil to augmentation, at least wise they cannot suffer any apparance of diminition or losse. But such people are abused, as Solomon sheweth saying, He that hath pity vpon the poore, &c. When one lendeth to an honest man, hee feareth no losse, but hopeth, and is as it were assured that hee wil not be vngrateful, but wil acknowledge and confesse the pleasure which he hath done him, and restore willingly that which hee hath len thim, yea with profit, & wil yeld some recompence for the plea∣sure
which hee hath done him: By a farre more reason ought wee to be assured, that when wee haue done any good to the poore, we shal not loose it, but it shalbe restored, and wee shal haue a verie good recompence: for wee haue not done it vnto a man, but to God, who taketh it not on this condition, neuer to restore it a∣gaine: but as pure and loyal, readie to yelde it againe, which he wil doe certeinly, yea with vsurie, by a maner of speeche: as Solomon expresseth it by Retribution. For this cause wee ought to bee readie and most willing to benefite the poore, as Solomon striueth to teach vs heere. And therewithal declareth vnto vs, first the honour which God doth to them, which haue pitie on the poore, and doe them good, giuing them the title of pitiful, which is properly to him a∣lone: for he alone doeth benefit vs, not being bound therto: & we can doe no good but what wee are bounde to doe, and should not once think to receiue any recompence for the same again: but rather should acknowledge that wee are vnprofitable seruantes, to thinke that any one is boūd to vs. Our Lord Iesus Christ sheweth this wel. Luk. 17. 7. But our good God giueth vs suche titles to aduertise vs, that wee bee his folowers, and as wee woulde that hee shoulde doe vnto vs, so wee shoulde doe to others, beeing certaine that hee wil recompence vs wel. Hee declareth secondly, that God requireth not of vs with rigour that which is his, but hee taketh it by bo∣rowing, Mat. 5. 7. Luk. 6. 36. to the end to restore it, as though hee were bound therto, although to him al thinges appertaine. And so to speake properlie, it is God which lendeth, or rather giueth vs al thinges to vse and dispose, and distribute to his familie, and wee can neither giue nor Psal. 24. & 50. lende to him. Notwithstanding, this is not to say, that Solomon speaketh not wel, when he saith, One lendeth to the Lorde. For one may say, that hee iesteth with vs, because of our rudenesse and ignorance, as a mother doth with her children: to giue vs more easily to vnderstande, how rea∣die the Lorde is to benefite vs, when hee reputeth that which is his owne, to bee lent him by vs, and wil restore it to vs as though hee were bounde theretoo, and as though hee had some thing of ours in his handes. A man may also say, that hee speaketh after our maner of speeche.
For when wee haue giuen any thing to any one which is not base conditioned, and that wee hope hee wil acknowledge it, and ren∣der vs againe the like or better, wee say, that wee haue lent him it. Or if one haue giuen vs any thing, and that wee bee willing to re∣quite it againe, wee say, that wee haue but borowed it. Thirdly, hee declareth vnto vs the liberalitie of our God, when hee sayeth, That hee wil restore, the retribution to him that shal haue lent. For of his grace, hee maketh himselfe as detter, when it is said, That hee wil restore. It is meete to vnderstand and say, that it is of his grace, seeing hee can be in dette to no bodie, and al are in det to him, and there is none that can paie that det. And as if one had done him some great pleasure, and had merited to be recompenced therefore, hee promiseth retribution, declaring that hee wil not onely render that which hath bene lent him, but also wil giue hyre, and profite to him which hath lent it him. Retri∣bution is made first in this worlde, when God doeth giue suffisance and contentment to them that are pitiful to the poore, although it seeme often, that they haue but litle. Secondly, it is made in the last resurrection. For the rest, be∣cause mention is made heere, of restoring, and retribution: the ar∣rogant Psal. 37. 9. 16. 17. Mat. 25. 34. dreamers, which demaund recompence of their good deeds, woulde heere founde their merites, and say, that in dooing good, they gaine the kingdome of heauen. But it is an easie thing to shew them that they are abused: for seeing the heauenly kingdome is the retribution, and inheritaunce of our father, which hee hath prepa∣red for his children before the foundation of the worlde, it folow∣eth, that one can not merite it: for wee were not before the foun∣dation of the worlde, and so children cannot merite the inheritance of their father, what seruice or duetie soeuer they doe to him. For they neither doe, nor can doe any good to their father, which they are not bounde to doe. If it bee so with men, which can leaue their children but temporal thinges, and of smal enduraunce. It is not fit that wee shoulde bee so arrogant, as thinke to come to the heauenly kingdome by our merites, and binde God to vs, to giue it. But the kingdome of heauen is called hyre, rewarde, or re∣tribution, because it foloweth our paynes and labours, our workes,
and good deedes: not that they are worthie thereof, but that it pleaseth God so to accept them, and that hee himselfe maketh them, For it is God that woorketh in vs both the wil and deede, Phil. 2. 13. according to his good pleasure. Heereby wee haue a good argument to knowe, that retribu∣tion commeth not by our merites, but by pure grace, and libera∣litie. Also it woulde bee no inconuenience to say, that the scrip∣ture speaketh of God according as one speaketh of Kinges and Prin∣ces, which vse great liberalitie, and giue great giftes and presentes for their pleasure, to those which haue done them but a smal ser∣uice. One may say of suche Lordes, that they haue wel rewar∣ded them, but one can not say, that they haue deserued it. If there∣fore it please our God to vse great liberalitie towardes vs, and to cal it, rewarde, let vs acknowledge, that wee haue not deserued it, but that it is his good pleasure to deale so with vs. 18 Chastise thy sonne, while there is hope: and let not thy soule spare for his crying. Solomon hath alreadie often warned children to receiue the instruction and correction of their fathers and mothers: and hath shewed fathers and mothers, that they ought to instruct and cha∣stise their children betimes, if they loue them: for otherwise they hate them, which is a thing against nature. For one loueth natu∣rally his owne blood, and principally him that is sprong of his en∣trailes. Nowe although it be a thing verie harde, and almost impossible that a father should not loue his childe: notwithstanding, some sticke not to fayle often in this loue, in making themselues beleeue they loue their children, and in the meane while by flatteries, and pardons, or by great libertie and licence, they let them bee lost: which is a good argument that they loue them not as they ought to doe. And because this thing is so vsual, Solomon is not content to haue saide: Hee that spareth the rodde hateth the childe: but he that loueth Pro. 13. 24. him, chasteneth him betime:
but to teache fathers, what they ought to do with their children whome they loue, hee commandeth them expresly, Chastise thy sonne. How one ought to chastise, hath bene treated off in the place afore alledged. It resteth to know when one should chastise. Solo∣mon sheweth it, saying, When there is hope, to wit, that the childe by chastisement, may come to amendment: which is, when the childe is yet tender of age, and not accustomed nor hardened to yl dooing, nor hath not learned to despise his parentes, nor mock at their admonitions, corrections, menacinges, and scourgings. This is the time whereof Solomon speaketh in the place aforesaid. And to the ende that the childe become not a mocker and con∣temner, obstinate and stifnecked, and that al hope of amendment passe not: Solomon wil not that one suffer them to rage, exclaime, make noyse and murmure, in rebelling either in high wordes, or outragious and violent deedes, but that without delaye, they bee reprehended assoone as the fault is spied, be it neuer so little: wee shoulde vnderstande this, when Solomon saieth, And let not thy soule spare for his crying. Some say, Haue no regarde of his cry∣ing. Cease not to chastise him although hee crye. Some, And let it not enter into thy thought to kil him. For Magistrates are ordei∣ned to take reuenge on the childe that wil not bee ruled. Because the Hebrewe tongue endureth suche diuersitie of senses, which neuertheles are not contraries, it is free for euerie one to followe which hee wil. And this while, let vs not bee of the opinion of them, which saye, that one ought not to chastise children with roddes, for that is inhumanitie. Then if suche chastisement bee inhumanitie: wee may say by farre more reason, that God hath taught fathers and mothers to bee cruel. When hee wil haue chil∣dren that wil not bee ruled, to bee put in the handes of Iustices, to bee punished with death: and by consequent, one shoulde accuse God of crueltie, which is no way lawful. They that wil not haue them chastised with roddes, builde vppon this passage of Saint Paule (If at leastwise they reade the Scriptures,) to wit, And you fathers, prouoke not your children to anger, but bring them vp in instruction, and information of the Lord. Heere the Apostle forbiddeth not the rodde, but hee wil that
the correction be moderate, and that fathers bee not cruel, nor fu∣rious towardes their children: for too great rigour is cause that Ephe. 6. 4. Col. 3. 21. children hate their parentes, and that they rebel against them, and retyre themselues from their yoke and subiection, that they loose their courage, and haue afterwarde no heart to doe wel. 19 A man of great wrath shal suffer punishment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come a∣gaine. Many thinke they cannot do their businesse halfe wel, nor come halfe so soone to the ende of their enterprises, if they be not an∣grie bitterlie against them, which resist them, or let them to doe as they wil: and take no heede if they haue iust cause or no, to be so angrie, but they fret and fume, as though they were madde. Of the which number one may first put Caine, who hath wel shewed to his brother Abel, that hee was a man of great anger, when hee slewe him. Hee thought by this meanes to doe as hee would himselfe, and to liue at his heartes ease, thence forwarde: but hee hath had the paine, and torment therof as appeareth. In the second place one may put the brethren of Ioseph. They haue felte the payne of the great anger which they bare against the saide Ioseph, as they Gen. 4. 8. 11. themselues confesse. Wee wil set downe Pharao King of Egypt in whome this sentence hath bene more and manifestly verified, as is seene from the beginning of Exodus, to the ende of the 14. Chapter. One may see that hee hath borne great anger against the children of Israel, for the which cause he hath receiued great woundes, from the which hee hath bene deliuered by the prayers of Moyses: but hee hath not ceased to returne to his ire and furie, vntil such time as hee was drowned in the sea. Also one may set downe heere al theeues and murtherers, which thirst after mans blood, who ought to bee punished by Kinges, Princes and Magistrates: for if one pardon them, they cease not to doe so againe, as is commonlie seene to come to passe. Let vs vnderstande therefore that wee are warned to eschue an∣ger, if wee wil bee free from paine, punishment and torment. Also
Kinges and Magistrates are aduertized, that they profite nothing when they giue pardon to the wicked: and therefore they should let them suffer punishment. Some ioyne this present sentence, to that going before, according to the thirde exposition, saying, That if the fathers anger bee so great towardes his sonne, that he thinketh to kil him: this anger or furie, is greatly hurtful to him, but hee ought to spare him, in hope he wil amende▪ And indeed it is not good, that a father of an housholde, shoulde yeelde him¦selfe to anger for euerie matter or trifle, either against his chil∣dren or his seruauntes or neighbours. For the anger of man Iam. 1. 30. fulfilleth not Gods iustice. So in what sense soeuer wee take this present sentence, wee are admonished to bee gentle, meeke, and tractable. Yea, when by our meekenesse and gentlenesse, wee o∣mit nothing of that which is our office, but serue to the glorie of GOD, and edification of his Churche: and in as muche as wee can, conuert soules to God, and serue to the augmentation of the kingdome of Iesus Christ our Lorde. 20 Giue eare vnto counsel, and take correction: that thou mayest bee wise in thy later dayes. Wee are all by nature not onely ignoraunt, and brutishe, but also foolish, and wicked, and neither wil, nor can of ourselues chaunge and amende ourselues, nor better our estate. Notwithstanding, wee haue not suche opinion of ourselues, nor take it not in good parte, that others shoulde account vs so, but striue and studie to make vs bee thought good and wise, and couet that our neighbours shoulde esteeme vs so. Whereby wee are verie muche abused: but the abuse is not suche, but it may ea∣sily be remedied, as Solomon sheweth vs, saying, Giue eare vnto counsel, and take correction: that thou maist be wise in thy later dayes. Hee teacheth vs what wee haue to doe to dispoile ourselues
of ignoraunce and brutishnesse, to flye from follie and wickednes, to the ende that at leastwise wee become wise in the latter dayes. And to doe the same, hee proceedeth by degrees. First, hee gi∣ueth vs remedie against ignorance and brutishnes, when hee ad∣monisheth vs to giue eare to counsel. For the counsel whereof hee speaketh, is the woorde of God, which (as hath beene di∣uers times spoken of) is our wisedome and vnderstanding, of the which wee participate not but by the holie Scriptures. Where∣vppon ensueth, that Solomon inuiteth vs to the reading and hea∣ring of Sermons, wherein the holie Scriptures are declared vs: this is the first degree: as wee ought to vnderstande by Moyses and the Prophetes, when they inuite vs so often to heare the woorde of the Lorde, yea, afore al other thinges. It is the right entrie, to come to true wisedome. Secondly, hee giueth remedie for fol∣lie and wickednes, when hee woulde haue vs to take correction: which is to say, That we hearken to the word of God so attentiue∣ly, and with suche affection, that the threatenings therin pronoun∣ced against vs, make vs to tremble: that we haue feare and horrour at the iudgementes which they shewe vs to haue bene executed a∣gainst the wicked, and of that they shal susteine in the time to come. And that the admonitions, exhortations and warnings, make vs ashamed of our life passed, and to beare a special hate to wickednes, whereto wee haue not onely bene enclined, but also giuen and ad∣dicted, and that we take pleasure to amende our life, in walking in al honestie, holines, and iustice. Beholde what it is, to take correction, as may bee gathered by many places of these Prouerbes. But one may say, that they which walke by these two degrees, are wise, as hath beene seene heereto∣fore in diuers pointes of this booke. The answere heereto is, that Solomon meaneth, that one hereby aduaunceth himselfe fur∣ther in wisedome, and encreaseth therein successiuely, and is in waye to giue certaine proofe thereof, and to bring foorth fruites. There is also an other difficultie, which is, that Solomon seemeth to be content, if we be wise in our later dayes. Wherunto we answer, that indeed it is better we be wise late thē neuer, as may be seene by the theefe: but we are not promised, that when we haue spēt al our Luk. 23. 40
life in pleasures of follie, and naugh tinesse, God wil afterwardes giue vs the grace to amende, and folowe true wisedome. And So∣lomon giueth vs hope of nothing which hath not his foundation on the promises of God. And therefore when he saith, In thy later dayes, &c. Let vs take it for al that time wherein wee are called to fayth and repentance, wee may wel cal it, The la∣ter dayes: for first, after being once called, it is not meete wee re∣turne to our first estate of follie and wickednesse. Secondarily, the dayes of man are short, and hee liueth (by his wil) longer, in follie and wickednesse, then in wisedome and good∣nesse. Wherefore one may wel cal his later dayes, the time which hee applieth in wisedome and wel doing. Let vs note finally, that it is not to bee maruelled at, if in the world there be many fooles, and fewe wise men: seeing they wil not folowe the counsell of Solomon. 21 There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counsel of the Lorde shal stand fast. There is none of vs which desireth not to bee in good estate, and haue prosperitie of long endurance, but man of himselfe can∣not attaine to it in this world: also there is nothing vnder the Sun which is not subiect to chaunge, as is daily prooued: yea Kinges themselues which are puisant and mightie, haue not their estate permanent. Notwithstanding, man thinketh not so, but he deemeth him∣selfe not of so smal value, as to take vpon him an estate of no en∣durance, Dan. 2. 21. rather al they which are come to any degree of prosperi∣tie, say naturally in their hearts, that they wil neuer stirre nor moue, and al because they haue tasted no aduersitie: but it happeneth of∣ten, that they are frustrate of their opinion: which is cause that they thinke, and rethinke, they take newe counsels and make ma∣ny deliberations, as Solomon expresseth, saying, There are many thoughts in the heart of man: when he speaketh so, it is not to say, that hee alloweth so many thoughtes to be
in the hart of man, but rather blameth them, and sheweth that they are vaine, when hee setteth against them the counsel of God, say∣ing, The counsel of the Lorde shall stande fast. Hee argueth and reprooueth those, which of themselues wil gouerne themselues, & place them in estate, stable, and permanent: and to come to the end thereof they thinke, consult, & determine often, and in many sorts: and this without asking at the mouth of the Lorde, without cra∣uing counsel at him, and aresting themselues at his worde. It see∣meth to them that they are but too wise, to knowe howe to set in order and sure estate their businesse. Such rashe headed and ar∣rogant fooles ought wel to be reprehended, whereon they esteeme themselues so much, & despise so boldly the eternal wisdome, with∣out the which we cannot but goe astray, stumble, and fall. There are also in the scripture many complainres and threateninges against such arrogant fellowes. Contrariwise, hee promiseth a sure estate Iob. 12. 13. Ioh. 5. 12. Psa. 33. 10. Isa. 8. 9. Iere. 11. 7. Leuit. 26. 3. Deut. 28. 1. Psa. 33. 11. to them, which renounsing themselues and al their owne counsel, take the counsel which God hath ordeined them by his worde, which teacheth them to yeelde a voluntary obedience to the Lord, and to cleaue to his gooduesse and mercy, not any thing doubting of his fatherly loue towardes them. Hee maketh not this promise of himselfe, but following the holy Scripture, hee hath also re∣garde to that which is saide, The counsel of the Lorde shal stande for euer. And so, wee take not heere the counsel of the Lorde for his eternal wisedome: by the which afore the foundation of the world he hath ordeined al things. This counsel is secrete, and to vs incomprehensible. Neuerthelesse wee shoulde not sticke to confesse that such counsel is, and shalbe firme, as Esay confesseth it. Also of the firmenesse of this counsell dependeth the firmenesse of that Esa. 40. 12. Rom. 11. 33. Esay. 25. 1. Rom. 16. 25. Ephe. 1. 9. which is giuen vs dayly by the worde: for when the worde is pro∣nounced to vs, it is because God hath so ordeined it before the be∣ginning of the worlde. By the reuelation of this secret, the elect of God are deliuered from vanitie, and made firme and stable. 22 That which is desirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: insomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.
Although wee be wicked of nature, and many perseuer obstinately in their malice and naughtinesse, taking delight to pro∣fite themselues by the hurt of others, in deceauing, polling and robbing, and despise to order themselues by vpright dealing, not∣withstanding if they haue any thing to barter or vse traffique with their neighbours, that which they most desire in them is, vpright dealing, and that they wil not seeme to deceaue them: for although they be worth nothing, yet they haue a certaine feare to deale with cousoners, lyars, hypocrites, and dissemblers, bee they neuer so rich, and diligent in doing their businesse: yea they loue better to haue to doe with a poore man naked of all goods: with whome they thinke to profite more then with the lyar, dissembler and de∣ceiuer bee hee neuer so rich. Solomon expresseth wel this same, saying, That which is desirable in a man is his vpright dealing. If this sentence be practized and verified any whit by the wicked, that is not say, that it shoulde not bee practised in al thinges, and princi∣pally in thinges of weight, and excellency. As if there bee a question to chose, or make a King, Lorde, Magistrate, or gouernour in a coun∣trie, it is meete to desire vpright dealing, as Iethro sheweth: also we may gather it out of many places of the Psalmist. It behooueth vs not to be scrupulous about the poorenesse of the person as GOD sheweth wel to Samuel, when hee appointeth him to annoint Da∣uid King ouer Israel: we ought also to vnderstande it by that which Exo. 18. 21. Psal. 2. 10 & 72. 1. 12 & 82. 1. & 101. 1. 1. Sam. 16. 1 12 Eccl. 4. 13 & 9. 13 is saide els where. It is not fit therefore to haue regarde to nobi∣litie or riches, nor auncientnesse of race, and family, but to desire vp∣right dealing. Likewise if there bee question to choose Ministers of the worde of God, it is right necessary to desire vpright dealing be∣cause they haue the gouernment of soules, which haue bin bought so dearely and preciously. Also one can giue no iudgment of a mans vpright dealing, but by his former conuersation, whereof one hath certaine proofe. This first part of this sentence may be expounded diuersly, because of one worde which hath diuers significations in the Hebrue tongue, to wit, mercy, shame, religion, reproche, and defame: but leauing the diuersitie of expositions aparte, let vs learne heerein, that as wee woulde our neighbours shoulde vse
vpright dealing towards vs, and not disguise themselues any way: So wee shoulde doe the like towardes all men. 23 The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the same, lodgeth where no plague shall visit him. God greatly recommendeth vnto vs his feare: as is seene in the Lawe, the Psalmes, and Prophetes of whom we are often admoni∣shed Deut. 4. 10. Psal. 22. 24. to this feare. Nowe although the feare that hee demaundeth, serue to his glory: notwithstanding hee demandeth it not, for any profite that hee shal reape thereby: for hee hath no neede of vs, neither can we profite him any way. But hee demandeth it to the ende, we be ad∣uanced in goods, and honour, not onely fraile and transitory, but chiefly, heauenly, and eternal. Solomon signifieth it by this worde Life, when hee saith, The feare of the Lord bringeth a man to life. True it is, that Superiours ought to keepe from al wrong and vio∣lence, those which feare God, to the ende they may liue in peace, & tranquilitie seruing God. And Moses in many places, promiseth longlife vppon earth, to them which keepe the commandements of God. Wherevpon the Apostle Saint Paule building, saith, That the feare of God is profitable in al thinges hauing promise of life pre∣sent, and also of life to come. Neuerthelesse, seeing that the life present is common to men with beasts, & that the wicked often∣times liue in this worlde, more happily according to the outwarde apparance then the good and faithful which haue the feare of the Lorde before their face: for this cause when wee haue promise of life, wee vnderstande that the life present is not but as it were a shewe of the life to come, and that wee ought not to stay there∣in, to make our dwelling heere belowe, as in our heritage: but wee must aspire on hie to heauen, where their life is, that feare god, folowing the faith of the good fathers. And that with firme assurāce
wee say with Saint Paule. We are not we cried: but although. &c. Aso wee knowe that if our earthly house of this Iodging be destroi∣ed, Heb. 11. 13. 2. Cor. 4. 16. we haue an euerlasting house in heauē, which is not made with handes. Saint Paule inuiteth vs to aspire to this life. Sith therfore it is aboue, which wee ought to aspire to, knowe wee, and bee wee Col. 3. 1. assured, that when life is promised them which feare the Lord, it is meant chiefly eternall life. Contrariwise when we see the threate∣ninges which are spoken against them, which are without the feare of God, knowe wee, that they shal not liue, but death shall swalowe them eternally, with that, that from now many begin their Psa. 55. 20. 24. hel, partly because their owne consciences reprooue them: & they cannot rest therefore, partly because they are afraide of the iudge∣ments of God. Whereby they dispaire, not seeing any way howe they shal escape them: and partly because they haue often great mi∣series and afflictions, wherewith they are tormented greatly, not knowing that hee is God which afflicteth them iustly. Caine was Gen. 4. the captaine of suche people, also hee began his hel in this worlde: as may bee seene by that which is written of him. Pharao may well come next after, as is seene in Exodus, by the plagues which GOD sent him, and by the acknowledgement which hee made of his wic∣kednesse, in the which notwithstanding hee remained indurate and hardened. Let vs put Saule in the thirde place, who pursued Da∣uid vniustly against his conscience, as is also seene by his owne con∣fessions. 1. Sam. 24. 18. & 28. 7. & 31. 4. Also God hath sent him great miseries and afflictions, frō the which, seeing hee coulde not escape, hee had recourse to the Di∣uel, and dispaired and slue himselfe: wee see therefore what a mi∣serable thing it is to reiect the feare of the Lorde, for to giue ones selfe to wickednesse: and contrariwise, that there is great felicitie for them which through the feare of the Lorde doe hate and detest iniquitie, and couet to render true obedience to God, according as he demandeth by his worde, and to be also at their neighbors com∣mandemēt, asswel for the edification & helth of their soules, as for the commoditie of this life. Solomon expresseth also in other words this felicitie, saying, And hee that hath the same, lodgeth, &c. In the which hee sheweth vs, that to bee happy by the feare of the Lord, is not enough to feare him in any one part of our conuer∣sation,
and in the rest to bee giuen to followe our owne fantasies: as those which feared the Lorde, seruing likewise their gods: and as the Papists doe, which are followers of this foresaide kinde of men: for they make a shewe of fearing of God, in that they folowe 2. Rom. 17. his worde some what, and principally in this that they haue obser∣ued baptisme, and that they vse some loyaltie one towardes ano∣ther: for the rest, they are abhominable in their Ceremonies and seruices which they call diuine, beeing indeede diuellishe: and they are also abhominable in their wicked traffiques, fraudes, and couso∣nages, in their othes and blasphemies. Therefore they obteine fe∣licitie by the feare of God, it is not enough to vse some faire apparāce of holynesse, in contemning al the abuse, and abhomination of su∣perstitions and Idolatries, of Painims, Papists, and other infidelles, frequenting sermons of the woorde, and communicating the Sa∣cramentes: and in the rest to bee Athiestes in our heartes, and our mouthes replenished with euil talkings, our affections bur∣ning with auarice, wee embrased with hate and rancour, and who∣ly giuen to fraudes, cosonages, and other abhominations. But it is meete, that as a man which desireth to bee whole and sounde of body, followeth willingly the counsel of a good Phisiti∣on, and to fil and satisfie himselfe, eateth not but good meates con∣uenient & proper to ingender blood, and reiecteth al others which are not proper to mingle with the good. Euen so wee shoulde en∣tirely followe the counsel of God, who is our soueraigne Phisition and fil and satisfie ourselues with his feare, folowing orderly that which hee teacheth vs by his woorde, and reiecting al other feare which our soueraigne Phisition reprooued. Solomon vseth the same similitude here, as may bee seene by the woorde filling, which signifieth in his language satisfiyng or appeasing of hunger, and pro∣miseth to him that shal satisfie himselfe with the feare of the Lord, great assurance, when he saith, That hee shall lodge where no plague shall visit him. Hee v∣seth a similitude taken by a traueller or stranger who arriueth in a Isay. 8. 12. & 29. 3. & 41▪ 8. & 43. 1. & 44. 2. 1. Pet. 3. 14. lodging or Inne, which is out of the danger of theeues, & hath good gates and walles very strong, and those of the house are honest folkes and are careful to shut their doores, and vse a traueller or
passenger gently, and see that hee be not offended, nor suffer no wrong in their house. Euen as such a traueller is in great suretie, according to humane sense: so hee that feareth the Lorde, findeth good lodging, & sure entertainement, and there is no man that can doe him any harme. This is it which God hath promised to his peo∣ple by Moses, and afterwarde by Dauid and his holy Prophetes. But one may say: there is none in the worlde, that suffer more outra∣ges, Leu. 25. & 16. 2. Deut. 8. 6. Psal. 22. 24. 25. & 34. 8. Esay. 33. 14. Exo. 25. 5. iniuries, & violences, nor that are persecuted more cruelly, then they that feare GOD. Abel hath prooued it, Dauid, the Pro∣phetes, Iesus Christe and his Apostles, whome hee hath foretold their afflictions. To this I answere, That to bee visited with euill in this place, is to bee vanquished therewith, so that one is not able to recouer himselfe: as it is taken in diuers places of the Scrip∣tures. 24 The slouthfull man hath shut his handes into his bo∣some: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth. Solomon hath often tolde vs alreadie the nature, gestes, and qualities of the slouthful, & the misery and pouertie which of force they must indure by their slouth & negligence: notwithstāding, be∣cause the number of them encreaseth dayly, and continueth, and that wee are al of so wicked a nature, that wee wil bee content too liue at our owne pleasure without doing any thing, but to sporte and play, and to enioy the delights and pleasures of this worlde, and wil not thinke on the hyre of slouth, nor heare speake of euil, which shal followe after, which wee must of force suffer, will we or nil we, if wee bee slouthful: for this cause hee contenteth not himselfe with so many aduertisements which he hath alreadie giuen vs: but to the end we may take more heede, or at least wise be more inexcu∣sable, and iudged worthie of miserie, hee repeateth heere againe vn∣der contrary wordes, the negligence, and little care of the slouthful, by the gesture of a man, who because of the great colde he endu∣reth cannot put his hande to worke, but is constrained to shut it into his bosome to keepe it warme, when he saith,
The slouthfull man hath shut his hande into his bosome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth. And by good reason speaketh hee soo: for the slouthfull wil not warme himselfe with his businesse, but is still as it were very chilly & cold. Whervpon ensueth that of force the great indigence which taketh and assaileth him, must make him suffer hunger, as Solomon expresseth, saying, And hee will not take paine to put it to his mouth. In so say∣ing hee sheweth the long abiding of the hande in the bosome, and the continuall and obstinate negligence of the slouthful, which if he woulde forsake, hee might so one remooue his hande from his bo∣some, and set it a worke, whereby hee might haue wherewith to re∣turne to his mouth and susteine himselfe. But seeing hee maketh no account thereof, he must of force perish with want, and be poore and miserable. And if one put a contrary to this, that there is a great number of sluggardes, which put well their handes to their mouth, eate and drinke, & make good cheere, and their goods ne∣uer faile them: as is seene in the Clergie & monkery of the Papists. Answere First. Solomō sheweth what the slouthful are worthie of, and what it is they deserue: as also the Apostle Saint Paule shew∣eth, when hee forbiddeth giuing meate to the slouthful. Second∣ly, 2. The. 3. 10. seeing they are not worthie to liue: and that they vsurpe that which they haue, as theeues and robbers that lyue by rapine, yea by what title soeuer they possesse their goods. Thirdly, if the slouthful for a time liue at their ease, they come atlast vnto great pouertie: as is dayly seene in many who inhe∣rite richly their fathers patrimonies, and afterwardes liuing in de∣lightes, without doing any thing, haue not had wherewithal too put their hande to their mouth, but by begging, filching, robbing or deceiuing. Fourthly, if God spare the slouthful for a time, hee knoweth howe to visite them afterwardes: and if it bee not in this worlde, it will bee in death euerlasting, as may bee seene by the wicked riche man, Luke 16.
25 Smite the scornefull person, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wise man, hee hath vnderstanding to knowledge. One saith commonly that it is best to beate the dogge before the Lion: whereby is signified that to warne and feare the hautie, proud, & arrogant, stiffnecked, and obstinate, it is best to chastice the feeble, although they haue sinned in little, or nothing. And as one saith, who without al right or reason, so one doeth wickedly in do∣ing so: and the sentence is practised, which saith: Censours tor∣ment and afflict the Doues, and spare the rauens and pardon them. For one shal see (as the common vse is) that Kings, Princes, and ma∣gistrates and iudges wil sooner and more sharpely punishe the sim∣ple person which hath not much offended. They are not so taught by God, who resisteth stoutly the proude, and giueth grace to the humble: as he hath wel shewed at the Deluge, at the subuersion of Sodom, the destruction of Pharao, and other desolations whereas hee hath smitten the scorneful, and spared the lowly, to the end that the ignorant and simple which are not yet wel aduised, may feare and learne to walke wisely. Therefore sith the superiours of the earth are in the seate of God, they ought to bee his followers in punishing them that haue no feare of God, nor reuerence of his woorde, and that by their dissolute life and insolencie, worke great scandalles, and offende their neighbours, with wronges and outra∣ges, and violences, to the end that the rest may be afraide to giue themselues to such wickednesse, Solomon warneth them hereof, saying, Smite the scornefull person, and the ignorant will the better take heed: for if one reprooue the wise man, hee hath vnderstan∣ding, &c. Hee saith not, admonishe freendly the mocker, and reprehende him in secrete: for he knewe wel that one shoulde profite nothing that way, as hee hath aboue saide: But hee will that one smite him, and punishe him, according to his demerites, to the ende hee may bee an example, and that others may come to repentance and amendment of life, and that they be not so har∣dy
to giue themselues to wickednesse, but haue it in abhomination, and flee from it intierely. See heere the heede which Solomon spea∣keth of when hee saith, That the ignorant wil take better heede. Hee wil not that by his heede, he hurte his neighbours, but that he flee from mockerie. For the rest, when hee putteth the wiseman a contrary to the scorneful, saying. If one reprooue the wise, hee wil haue vnderstanding to knowledge. And that hee saith not. Smyte him: but reprooue him: hee sheweth principally two thinges. First, that one calleth not him wise which hath no faute (for such a one is not any way to bee founde, or if hee bee founde, yet hee is not to bee reprooued, but praised, and extolled) but hee which by infirmi∣tie beeing falne, relieueth himselfe by repentance, and taketh in good parte, to bee argued, blamed and reprooued: for hee knoweth that such admonitions, and corrections, serue him for a schoole to bee come yet more wise, and better aduised. As Solomon expres∣seth it, saying, Hee hath vnderstanding to knowledge. For hee vnder∣standeth not at the beginning but by augmentation, wherof hath beene spoken heeretofore. Secondly, That they which are trac∣table and of good capacitie, ought not to bee handled rigorously, as the vncorrigible, scorneful, and contemptuous: although one may wel vse sharpe woordes, and seuere speeches: as is to bee vn∣derstoode by this woorde reprehending: for if a man haue wit of himselfe, hee ought therefore, to bee better aduysed, and to guide himselfe wel that hee fal not, and it ought to bee a greate shame to him, to commit a fault worthy reprehension, bee it neuer so little. 26 Hee that hurteth his father, or shutteth out his mother, is a shameful and an vnworthy sonne. There are some children which thinke it is laweful for them to spende their fathers goods at their owne pleasure, and so they make greate wast of the same, and put their fathers in pouertie, and want: and despyse their mothers, because they are women, who doe no∣thing
but trouble the house, a lest, and offende them, and seeke to chace them out, principally when their fathers bee dead: And in thus doing, they thinke them∣selues couragious champions, honest men, good companions, and men of accompt, and light on table fellowes, and playepheers, who knowe howe to flatter them, and make them beleeue that they are worthy to haue goods, because they knowe howe to spende them pleasantly and in good felowship. But because the woorde of God ought to bee preferred before al humane wisedome, and so by con∣sequence before al foolish phantasies: and that such children, consu∣mers of substance, and contemners of their parents, not only despise humane wisedom which teacheth children to be sober, modest, tem∣perate, and humble to their parents, but also are disobedient and re∣bellious against God, who commandeth that one honor father and mother: for this cause Solomon calleth them shameful and vnwor∣thy, saying, The sonne is shameful and vnworthy, &c. Solomon speaketh not heere obscurely: for he speaketh according to our maner, which is, to cal a person shameful and vnworthy, which leadeth so wicked, filthy & abhominable life, and in such inhumanitie ingratitude and crueltie, that not only he ought to be ashamed thereof, but also de∣serueth to bee opprobrious & despised. Which thing those children wel deserue, which hurte or vndoe their fathers, and chace, or shut out their mothers. The law ought so to handle them, that they bee an example to others. But because it pleaseth vs not that our chil∣dren should come to such reproch and shame, as to be punished o∣penly, for offendors, & that we ourselues shoulde be abashed, grie∣ned, & vexed thereat, it is meete aforehande that fathers and mo∣thers be careful to order their life according to the worde of God, and according to the same word to watch ouer their children, brin∣ging them vp in the feare & knowledge of the Lord. And that mo∣thers take heed of being too much doted ouer their children, but that they shew themselues graue and make them feare them. For it hapneth oftentimes, that children, which are cockered, and brought vp tenderly, worke most woe to their mothers. And principally, whē they haue most neede of succour, which is after the discease of their
husbands when they are widdowes, or sick, or aged: It is then say I, that children ill brought vp, despyse them, offend them, & do them wrong, & seeke in this sort, to shut them out far from them, where by right they should enterteine them carefully, in al humanitie & gentlenesse, with feare, humilitie, and reuerence. Such children are shameful and vnworthy principally before God, which knoweth wel howe to destroy them, and put them backe from him with the Diuel, vnder whome they serue. 27 My sonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderstandinge. Seeing that Solomon admonisheth his sonne, that is to saie, him that is minded to obay his commandements, and beleeue his do∣ctrine, and hath already a good beginning, or yeeldeth himselfe at∣tentiue, to learne good doctrine: seeing (I say) that it is to such a sonne, that hee speaketh, and admonisheth him to heare no more any false instruction: let vs vnderstande that he speaketh not of the instructions of the Priestes and Doctors of the Gentils, which led them to abhominable obseruations, & who fought directly against the lawe, in so much that the most rude amongst the children of wisedome, amongst the people of Israel might knowe them, and ea∣silie keepe themselues from them, if they woulde not worke against their owne consciences, and despyse God willingly. It was easie for them to take heede thereof: for in the lawe they were often war∣ned, both by expresse wordes and by sharpe threatnings: But hee talketh of the instructions of them who vnder shadowe of beeing Iewes, and magnifying with their mouth, the lawe of God, shewing themselues very zelous of the glory of God, and profite of their neighbours, deceyued the people, bringing in sectes, and practising superstitions, which had some spyce of holinesse and religion. And so they peruerted the state of the Churche, which was wel ordey∣ned and disposed: as Core and his companions. As also those a∣gainst Rom. 16. 1 Ier. 4. 14. Ezech. 13. 1. whome the true Prophetes cryed, and amongst the rest Iere∣mie and Ezechiel.
Of such Prophetes the number hath beene great, as may bee seene in the 1. Kings, chap. 18. vers. 19. And not onely then but also in the tyme of our Lord Iesus Christ, and his Apostles: the Scribes, and Pharisees, and others were of that number: as our Sauiour shew∣eth Math. 16. 6 & 23. 13. Phil. 3. 18. Ioh. 2. 18. & 4. 1. it, when hee willeth men to take heede of their leauen, and when hee pronounceth them euil lucke. Saint Paule also sheweth it, and Saint Iohn. Such fellowes are very dangerous, because of their doctrine which beare a fayre shewe, are in the meane whyle turned from the obedience of the lawe which is the true know∣ledge Deut. 13. 1. Esa. 9. 15. Iere. 23. &. 18. 15. Rom. 16. 17. 2. Tim. 2. 14. Ose. 4. 5. Mat. 24. 4. 11. 23. Act. 20. 29 30. 1. Tim. 1. 4. 2. Tim. 3. 1 2. Pet. 2. 1 Psa. 25. 4. & 119. 33. & 3. 8. 10. as there are many aduertisementes thereof. Saint Paule also sheweth the danger wel. Solomon therefore admonisheth his sonnes, to wit, eche faythful Christē man, not to giue eare to con∣sent to the instruction of such false Prophetes, which make the true preaching of the woorde to bee despysed, which is the true knowledge, without the which wee are blinde, and  force must goe astray, stumble, fall, and perishe. This present ad∣monition is nowe as necessarie for vs, as it was at the tyme of Solomon. As wee ought to vnderstande by that which our Lorde Iesus Christe hath foretolde vs, and Saint Paule and Saint Pe∣ter. Let vs note therefore that wee are admonished diligently to reade the scriptures and frequent sermons of the woorde of trueth. For it is there that wee heare the woordes of know∣ledge. Not to goe astray therefore, wee haue to pray with Dauid: Lorde make me to knowe thy wayes: direct mee in thy trueth, and instruct mee. 28 The false witnesse scorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie. Many weigh it not much to beare false witnesse against their neighbours, although their owne consciences reprooue them, and this may bee, because they thinke, or else seeke to make them∣selues beleeue, that they do no hurt but to them against whome they witnesse falsly, who are men as they are, and that they abuse none by theyr false witnessing but earthly iudges: but heere Solomon doeth shewe them that this is not so light
a matter as they make it and that they open their mouthes euen vp into heauen and speake against God: for they scorne against iudge∣ment, the which although men exercise it, notwithstanding it is not their iudgement but of God, of whome iudges are but mini∣sters, and as it were instrumentes. And hee alone is iudge of al the worlde, and so the wrongful witnesse, not onelie stryueth to set Gen. 18. 25. Rom. 3. 7. 8. 9. Psal. 7. 9. & 9. 8. 9. & 75. 6. 7. 8. disorder, trouble, and confusion in worldly affayres in doing their neighbours dammage, and abusing the iudges to make them erre from the right, but also hee despyseth God, and asmuch as in him lyeth, depriueth him of his trueth, and righteousnesse, and conse∣quently of his diuinitie, for hee cannot bee God, but hee must bee veritable, and iust, which is a mockery so detestable, that God wil not leaue it vnpunished, as Solomon hath saide before in this chap∣ter, ver. 5. and 9. But the false witnesses are so affectionate to yl speaking, and finde so much sweetenesse therein, that they thinke not of that which wil folowe, but onelie to speake euil with greate desire, and pronenesse. As gluttons and drunkardes doe which de∣uoure meate, and swallowe vp drinke with the greate desire that they haue to fil their bellyes, and cease not to put in their mouths: for al their pastime is to eate, and drinke. Euen so false witnesses ap∣ply al their studie to speake wickedly. Solomon signifieth the same saying. And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie. Where∣in also hee signifieth the ruyne of the wicked, which giue their mouthes to euil speaking: for as the gluttons, and drunkardes kil and choke themselues with too much excesse, euen so the wicked shalbe condemned for the words of their mouths. And wheras the holy scripture applyeth it self often to our maner of speaking, it must not be thought strange of that which we haue said for when we see any one desirous to tel a tale, we say he byteth vpon it, as vppon an apple: and so wee say of gluttons and drunkardes, that they kil themselues, because they neuer cease as it were, to drinke and eate abundantly. Neuerthelesse, because the woorde deuoure doeth signifie also, to hyde, some expounde it that the wicked dissemble iniquitie, because in bearing false witnesse they would bee thought to speake trueth.
29 Iudgementes are prepared for the scorneful, and stripes for fooles backes. There are diuers scornefull persons in the worlde and in diuers sortes, as experience sheweth it, and Solomon hath witnessed it here∣tofore speaking of the scorneful in sundry manners. Nowe although it cannot be but their consciences must reprooue them oftentimes, and mager their heartes they must be afrayde of the iudgementes of God, neuerthelesse they cannot truely vnderstand that there is a God, a iudge iust and seuere, who ought to iudge and punish them in ire and fury. As it appeareth, when for any remorce of consci∣ence that they haue, yet they reuert not at al from their scornfulnes but are rather obstinate and hardened therein, as if they had made aliance with death and hell, and as though they had power to resist God, and to command him to desist from that which he hath prepa∣red Isaack. 28. 14. 15. for them, and renounce that which he hath enterprised against them. But euen as all suche presumption is vaine, arrogant and wic∣ked, so the holy Ghost laugheth at it, and sheweth that it shalbe put downe, made nothing, punished, and destroyed, Solomon declareth it in this present sentence. Iudgementes are prepared &c. For se∣ing that God is not variable, and that he hath prepared iudgementes for the scorneful, it followeth wel that he wil make them feele them punishing them horribly, and without appeale, yea afore they them¦selues shal know of it, as Solomon signifieth by the word of iudge∣mentes: the which signifieth not here any arestes of the mouth, or any deliberations or sentences verball, but the horrible, and fearfull Exod. 6. 6. & 74. & 12. 12. Isay. 3. 14. Iere. 1. 16. execution, of the eternal decree of God agaynst the wicked as it is taken in other places, where God manaceth the wicked to punish & destroy them. Solomon also sheweth it when he ioyneth stripes to iudgementes, saying, And stripes for fooles bckes. For this is but an exposition or repetition of the wordes precedent, as the manner of Scripture is to resay one thing twise or thrise, and to call it by di∣uers names. That therfore which Solomon hath called iudgements, he calleth stripes: and the scornefull, foolish, threatning them gree∣uous punishment, not in their goodes, but on their owne person:
for he sayth that stripes are prepared for their backes, which is to say that God hath determined, and appoynted to afflict and punish the persons of fooles by diuers and sundry afflictions and punishments, as the Egyptians haue proued, and also the obstinate and rebellious amongst the people of Israel and others. Solomon signifieth wel the diuersity of punishmentes, when he saith not stripes in the singular number, but in the plurall. And that the backe or body is taken for the person, it is manifest, for God afflicteth not the wicked onely in their outward members, but also in their soules and mindes as they well feele it. And in other places the backe or body is taken for the person. In our common language we call the garde of the body of a∣ny one, him which kepeth him to the end none doe hurt to person. And although many scorneful and foolish persons feele not in this world these iudgementes and stripes, neuerthelesse that which is ordeyned for them, shal not fayle. For hauing abused the wisedome of God, they shal receaue at last their merites, and desertes. One may also say that Magistrates and iudges are warned of their office: Rom. 24. for they are ordeyned of God to doe iudgement and iustice, in puni∣shing the wicked, and deliuering the good from all iniuries, and vio∣lences. Rom. 13. True it is that scornefulnesse, and folly haue their principall seate, and residence in the heart, whereof men cannot be a fit iudge, there is none but God which soundeth and proueth the hearts. But as a liuely spring andful of water must needes emptie himselfe; or as a draughtful of filth and doung breaketh and casteth his smell a∣broade, and infecteth al them which are about it: So the scornefull and foolish spil their wickednesse, in committing great scandals, or doyng great outrages, or violences to their neighboures. Of suche thinges men are iudges, and ought to punish them.
The xx. Chapter. 1 WIne is scornefull, and strong drinke troublesome: and who so erreth in the same, is not wise. ALthough God hath created wine and other drinkes, which haue greate strength and sauour, and giueth vs them not onely to susteine and forti∣fie vs, but also to reioyce and delight vs, (as may bee seene in Moses as hath beene alledged:) notwithstan∣ding this is not to say, that one shuld Pro. 3. 10. Psa. 104. 15. Gene. 9. 21. & 19. 33. take such abundance thereof as to be drunk, as Noe, & Lot did. And also it is not lawful to delight in taking too much thereof, when chiefly for the abundance thereof one shall not be drunke, as the forena∣med were. For the excessiue abundance maketh not one drunke alwaies, insomuch that by the same one cōmitteth only one fault or two: But it chauncerh to many, that when they haue exceeded one tyme, and that the drink pleaseth, they return therto twise or thrise, and afterwardes continue and perseuer therin, as long as the occu∣pation agreeth with them, and there is nothing that pleaseth them more, then to intunne the wine into their throtes. And so they a∣buse greatly the good creatures of GOD, against whome they are verie vngrateful, not acknowledging that God giueth vs meat and drinke, for to vse in all sobrietie and temperance. Also hee ren∣dereth them the hire, that they deserue, deliuering them vp in a re∣prooued sense: As Solomon sheweth it in three woordes. The first when he sayth, wine is skornefull. Heere wine is not taken for the licour that GOD bringeth vs foorth of the vines: but for him that is adicted to the same, and hath therein so greate de∣light. For as one calleth man by the vertue and grace wherewith he is indued and adorned: So doeth hee also by the vice whereto
hee is adicted and wherein he is greatly enwrapped. Example: the man is called flesh, because he is giuen to fleshly lustes, the faithfull are called light. You were of late darkenesse, but now you are light to the Lorde. Solomon therefore calleth wine, him that abuseth Gen. 6. 3. 2. Cor 5. 21. himselfe therein, and by the same is corrupted: and sayth that such a drunkarde is skorneful: wherein he signifieth wel that hee is deli∣uered vp into a reprobate sense. As one may vnderstand by that which hath beene treated of heretofore of the skorneful. And al∣though we had no passage of the Scripture, which taught vs that we might say, that wine is taken for him which is giuen thereto, yet we might say, that Solomon speaketh so, applying himself to our man∣ner, which is to attribute vnto wine, that which drunkardes doe, and say. Wherein drunkardes ought to haue great shame, and find themselues very culpable, when it must bee, that for their vice, the creature of God which is good, be so reproched. Also the Lord can holde them culpable in that they abuse so his good gift, and defile it by intemperance: And finally wil declare against them his iudge∣mentes Pro. 1. 22. & 9. 7. 8. & 13. 1. & 14. 6. & 15. 12. and stripes, which he hath ordeined for them. The second, is when he sayth, Strong drinke troubleth or is troublesome. By strong drinke the Scripture intendeth ordinarily the drinke, which hath force to make a man drunke. But heere we take for the per∣son which is so much giuen thereto, and taketh so great abundance thereof, that by the same he is mooued to strife, debate, and mutuny insomuch that one can haue no peace with him, nor reconciliatiō at al. And so he that is giuen to take abundance of drink, which maketh drinke is deliuered vp into a reprobate sense, also he is vnreconci∣liable. As one may see where Saint Paule sayth, that they which are abandoned in a reprobate sense amongst other vices are full of strife, and that they bee without naturall affection, peo∣ple. The third is, when hee sayth, that who soeuer erreth in the same is not wise, When either by ignorance, or astonishment, or wandering of the spirite, he putteth himselfe out of the right way and goeth not where he should, or by obstinacie, or his owne opi∣niate minde, leaueth his way, and afterwarde cannot finde it againe nor knoweth not where he goeth. Therefore drunkardes doe so abuse wine and strong drinkes, that they loose thereby al memory,
sense, and vnderstanding. And what rebukinges soeuer one giue them thereof, they make but a iest of it as Solomon pronounceth, saying, wine is skornefull. And mooue strife and debate agaynst them, which seeke to leade them in the right way, sooner then they will geue them thankes for their friendly warninges, as Solomon pronounceth it, saying: Strong drinke is troublesome, or stirreth strife. And so drunkardes by their scornfulnesse and strife doe goe a∣stray, and by ignorance, astonishment and wandering of their wits, and by obstinacie and malice deliberate. Wherefore one may con∣clude with Solomon that they are not wise, and also that they shall not be: as Solomon signifieth, vsing the future tense. And al∣so one may well say, that they are abandoned into a reprobate sense: for as experience sheweth vs, they geue themselues to doe thinges which are not lawfull. Thus doyng, they goe astray in suche sorte, that they neuer finde the kingdome of GOD. For first they haue in this life neyther fayth, nor repentaunce, Rom. 1. 29. without the which one cannot serue GOD, and geue him the honour and homage which he oweth him, acknowledging him for soueraigne king and gouernour. But rather by incredulity and wickednes they serue the Diuell. Secondly, they shall not enter into the kingdome of Heauen, to enioy the same with the wise, iust, and sober. Let vs vnderstande therefore that Solomon aduertiseth vs couert∣ly 1. Cor. 6. 10. of that which the holye Scripture in diuers places admoni∣sheth vs. Let vs obey these holie and necessary admonitions: otherwise wee shalbee without hearte, and of force must die. For wee shalbee without wisedome, in the which there is life. Some translate in the steede of, to goe astray, too delight: both the two agree well with drunkardes: and in as muche as they delight too bee drunke, they loose their sense, wherevppon of necessity they must goe astray. 2 The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynst his owne soule.
If the simple, and feeble beastes which haue neyther teeth nor nayles sufficient to defende themselues withall; or likewise little children, and they which feele not themselues strong ynough, and well defended, are afrayde, when they heare the Lyon roare and approche: it is right necessaty that subiectes bee carefull too keepe themselues from committing any thing, whereby they may merite to be threatned by theyr Lordes, and superiours, as So∣lomon hath shewed vs. And because euery one of vs hath the hearte of a king, and that naturally wee couet libertie, or rather Pro 19. 12 rule and Lordshippe, and will not submitte ourselues as subiects, but rather rise vp and make rebellions: for this cause Solomon warneth vs agayne of the power, seuerity and rigour, of the yre and reuenge of kinges and superiours of the earth, when hee say∣eth, The feare of the king, &c. Hee sheweth vs that as the Li∣on being hungry, spareth, not his pray, when he hath it betweene his pawes, so if wee bee apprehended, hauing offended our su∣periours, wee haue too knowe that our life dependeth there∣vppon. As also he sayeth consequently vnder other woordes, say∣ing: That he which prouoketh the king to anger, offendeth a∣gaynst his owne soule. That is to say, that he putteth his life in danger, that he deserueth to bee executed and put to death by iu∣stice, or endure other paynes very grieuous. For hee that is disobedient to the king, and prouoketh him to anger, not fulfilling his will by humble subiection, is the kings pray, and not they which liue honestly, humbly, and religiously. Also kinges, princes, magi∣strates and gouernours doe not affray with threatninges such per∣sonages. Much lesse seeke they to teare them in peeces and deuour them, but they vse beneuolence towardes them, which is as the deawe vpon the grasse. When therfore Solomon saith: Pro. 9. 1. The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon, he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth against his owne soule. It is not to harten proude and cruel Tyrantes agaynst they Subiectes and inferiours, to the ende too vexe, torment, and de∣stroy them: But it is too aduertise kinges which will raygne
truely as they ought, of that seueritie and rigour, which they ought to vse against the disobedient, and rebellious, the obstinate, and stiffenecked in their wickednesse, dissolutions, and insolencies. Such persons are the pray of kings and not the simple and innocent, which seeke to render due obedience. But as the vse is nowe, the wolues eate the sheepe, they spare the wicked, and afray the good, doing to them outrage and violence vnder the colour of iustice. It is secondly to shewe Subiectes and inferiours that they ought to walke in feare vnder their Lords and superiours. Otherwise to looke to proue their fury like the hungry lyons. Also when Solomon saith, And he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynst his owne soule: he teacheth vs not that we should spare kinges in their vi∣ces, neyther that we shoulde feare to rebuke them for feare of their anger, and incurring their displeasure. Thus doing wee shoulde bee hypocrites, dissemblers, flatterers, traytoures to God, and to them which wee spare in their vices. Which wickednesse to eschew, let vs follow the constancy of the Prophets and Apostles, who haue spo∣ken frankly and couragiously to kings, and Princes, & haue not fea∣red their euill graces, as the holy Scripture witnesseth. Also they haue beene towardes such kings and Princes, as the pray betweene the pawes, and iawes of the Lyon. And according to the opinion of the world, they haue offended against their soules in not speaking and doyng as pleased those kinges, and haue beene worthy of death in the opinion of carnal men because the Princes were angry at their constancie and magnanimity, which they haue reputed obstinacie, and resistance or rebellion, as yet at this present, they vse to doe a∣gainst the poore faithfull sorte. Hee teacheth vs not I say, that wee shoulde spare such tyrantes: But that wee keepe ourselues, least by our wicked conuersation, and reprochful manners dissolute and vn∣ruly, and our deedes outragious and violent, we prouoke to anger our Princes & superiours, which are ordeined ouer vs. This should be to resist the superiour power: And so we should offend agaynst our soules putting them in danger of damnation, not onely tempo∣rall, but also eternall. Therefore if it behoueth vs to bee carefull to keepe ourselues from prouoking mundane princes to anger, which Rom. 13. 2. are but Lions whelpes: by a farre more reason wee ought carefully to regarde that we feare the great Lion, who not onely teareth in
peeces the flesh and bones of them which resist him, but destroyeth them for euer. This greate Lyon is our God eternal and almightie, into whose handes it is a feareful thing to fal. It is hee of whome it is saide. His roaring is as it were the Lyon hee wil roare and hantche vp his pray, and there shalbe none which shal recouer it. wee haue to doe also with another Lyon which is the Diuel, whom wee ought stil to prouoke to anger and wrath, in resisting him. Hee Heb. 10. 31. Esa. 5. 29. 30 & 31. 4. Ose. 11. 10. & 13. 7 1. Pet. 5. 8. 9. Iam. 4. 7. is not lyke to kings of the worlde, which haue the power from God, to punishe in their anger them which resist them, and to take reuenge vpon them: but the more one resistes him, the more, one is assured that hee wil doe no hurte. And as a people that wil resist some tyrant, munite, and arme themselues with al armour and munitions necessarie: Euen so to resist the Diuell, who is the murtherer of our soules, and to make him flee, it behooueth vs to arme and defende ourselues, as Saint Paule admonisheth vs. Ephes. 6. vers. 10. 3 It is a mans honour to keepe himselfe from strife: but euery foole will be medling. When wee are al created to the Image and lykenesse of our God; it is good reason that we be his followers, and that we thinke it greate honour if wee folowe him wel. As when a childe hath a good father, it is honour to him to seeke diligently to represent the manners of his father in his life and conuersation. Such a childe is greatly praised and esteemed amongst them that haue any little sense at all. And also the desire of fathers is commonly that theyr children at the least wise resemble them, if they cannot come to a greater perfection. Nowe our God and father is the God of peace and loue: as hee hath manifestly shewed vnto vs, for when wee were his enimies and aduersaries by our sinnes, by the which wee fought against him, prouoking and stirring him vp to anger against vs, hee hath loued vs so much that hee hath deigned to make peace with vs, and reconciled vs to him by the death of his sonne. Hee hath not made such peace and reconciliation with vs, for the
loue that wee had towardes him: neyther hath hee done it against his wil, fearing to bee dishonoured thereby, as the fleshly men and Rom. 5. 8 Ephe. 2, 1 Col. 1. 21, 22 Ioh. 3. 14 1. Ioh. 49 Luk. 2. 13. 14. Eph. 1. 5 Col. 1. 21, 22 Psa. 29. 8 Esa. 62. 5. & 65. 19. Mat. 18. 11 Luke. 15. 34 worldlings, proude and arrogant, would esteeme themselues to bee dishonoured as of a bace minde and courage, if they shoulde seeke their enemies, to reconcile themselues and make peace with them. But he hath esteemed such peace and reconciliation glory and ho∣nour. And seeing that for this peace and reconciliation hee wil bee glorified: it foloweth wel that he esteemeth it a glory, and as he esteemeth it a glorie, so hath hee done it cheerefully, without forethinking the good which hee hath done to vs vngrate and per∣uerse. Thus doing, our good God and father hath thought it glory and honour to cease from strife. And seeing it is glory and honour to children to followe the gentlenes, benignitie, and humanitie of their fathers, it behooueth vs to followe our heauenly father ceasing from strife. And to doe this same wel, it behooueth vs to take away al e∣nimities, hate and rankour, wherof debate and strife, dissentions and mutunies proceede, and to make peace with al men. It is not there∣fore Pro. 10. 12 Rom. 12. 17. Mat. 5. 44 & 23. 23. onely towardes our freendes that wee shoulde cease our strife, but also towardes our enemies, who aske but our destruction. And it is not meete wee thinke, that wee are dishonoured if wee humble selues, so farre as to seeke our neighbours to make peace and recon∣ciliation with them. It is not meete that this bee done vnwillingly: as they that wil say they wishe no harme to their neighbours, and in the meane while, wil neither see them nor meete them, nor doe them any pleasure at all. It behooueth that it be of francke courage, and Mat. 18. 35 free will that we reconcile ourselues one to another, forgetting in∣iuries past, as if we neuer had been wronged: our Sauiour sheweth vs that we must so doe. And seeing we craue of God whome wee Psa. 25. 6 & 79.  haue greeuously offended, that he wil haue no remembrance of our faultes, &c: It is good reason that we doe the lyke to our neigh∣bours, for it is vnpossible that they shoulde so much offende vs, as we haue offended our heauenly father. This is shewed vs by the parable which is in S. Mathew chap. 18. ver. 23. Ephe. 4. 31 33. & 5. 1. 2 Let vs cease therefore from strife (as it is saide) and folow that
our glorie shal not bee transitorie, but eternal, for wee shalbee the children of Col. 3. 8 Mat. 5. 9 God. Contrariwise, if wee bee giuen to stryfes, this shalbe obiected against vs, for although the worlde make accompt of the vertuous, and stout, and those, which can reuenge themselues, & iniurie their enemies: notwithstanding the holy Ghoste pronounceth them fooles, saying by Solomon that Euery foole wil bee medling. This is no smal reproche to be called foole by the holy Ghost. 4 The slouthful body wil not labour, because of winter: ther∣fore shall he begge in haruest, and haue nothing. It is a great paine and trauel to plow, till, and labour the ground in winter, because of the frost, snowe, and rayne: as they prooue it which medle therewith. But for the difficultie which they finde therein, they cease not to apply their labour: Some through hope of gaine, some for feare of pouertie, and other some because they knowe that one shoulde apply his woorke at al times and seasons, according to the state wheretoo hee is called: and that they should with al diligence seeke to ouercome al difficulties, to the ende they neither put themselues nor their familie in danger to begge their bread, and for the most parte not to finde one which wil giue any thing. As the slouthful deserue wel, and also Solomon threateneth them therewith, saying, The slouthful body wil not labour, &c. As for the manace of pouertie, it hath beene amplie treated of. But wee must note first of al, that there are many which thinke themselues not slouthful, & neuerthelesse if they meete with any little winter, that is to say, any let, which seemeth to them harde to ouercome: they are so deintie, that they thinke one shoulde excuse them of the woorke. Such persons (after Solomon,) ought to bee esteemed slouthful: for they labour not in the winter. Heere vnder Win∣ter hee comprehendeth al the seasons that seeme difficile to them that woulde liue at their ease, and would eate their bread
and doe nothing, but that which seemeth to them good, according to the sense of their fleshe. As also vnder the name of labouring, wee ought to vnderstande al dooings wherein men ought to apply themselues. Secondly it is to bee noted, when hee saieth, that the slouthful shal begge or craue in Haruest, that idle persons will thinke thereby that one ought to giue them their demande, when hee hath gathered goods ynough, and that hee ought not to spare from them, seeing they are in pouertie, and knowe wel how to spend it. There is a great number of such sluggardes in the Papacie, were it but amongst the Monkes and Priestes. And in euery country whatsoeuer, there are many idle persons which followe plaies and pastymes, after the which they make great cheere, and search out the tables of them whome they thinke are riche, or haue made a good haruest, and are liberal. Thirdly, let vs note that when hee saieth. That the slouthful shal haue nothing: Hee speaketh principally of that which the slouthful deserue, and also of that which cannot fayle them. For although ydle bellies bee for a tyme filled, notwith∣standing it is not wholy to their contentement: for they haue neuer so much as they would haue, & yet at last they come to a miserable indigence, and are naked of al goods: As they finde, which are in hel. The riche also are warned not to communicate their goods to such slouthful persons. 5 Counsell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderstanding will drawe it out. There is none but God alone which can know, and bring to light, that which lyeth hid in the heart of man: as hath bin shewed here∣tofore by the scripture in diuers places. And although we think very profoundly without any outward motiō, yet our thoughts stick not to be present with him, as wel as if we should expres thē by words or works: the 136. Psalme sheweth this wel, and foorthwith decla∣reth what it is, insomuch as GOD hath formed vs as wee are.
But al though it appertaine to him alone to haue such knowledge, and that none other can haue it, neuerthelesse wee are so curious, that we wil know that which we cannot know, as appeareth by that which hath been already saide: for seeing it apperteineth to God, the creature can do nothing in it, and ought not once to presume to at∣taine thereto. Solomon also sheweth it wel, when he compareth the cogitations deliberations, enterprises, and willes of the heart of man, to deepe waters, saying, Counsell in the heart of man, &c. This is not to say, that the heart of man is nor more hidden, and harde to sounde, then the bottome of the deepest waters in the worlde: But Solomon ma∣keth such a comparison, to shewe that if a man finde it harde, yea vnpossible to pearce the depth of the great Sea: then he ought not to presume to knowe that which man cōsulteth & decreeth in his hart: for it is yet more hiddē thē the depth of Sea: & also it disgui∣seth it selfe in diuers fashions, as euery one of vs may knowe, if wee consider it more neerely, according as he is sensual, and giuen to his natural corruption. Likewise there is none of vs, which knoweth intirely the counsels of his hearte: for then wee should haue no sinnes which shoulde bee hidden from vs, for the which Dauid Psal. 19. 13. prayeth, saying, Who is hee that knoweth his offences? Deliuer me, therefore from my hidden faultes. Neuerthelesse this argueth not, but one may somewhat knowe what a man is in hearte: for if wee haue the patience to consider according to the woorde of the Lorde (the which onely is our wisedome and vnderstanding) the wordes, behauiour, and doinges of them which seeke to hide and disguise themselues, at last their heartes wil not bee discouered too vs, and wee shall knowe their counsels, deliberations, and enterpri∣ses: For God by his woorde will giue vs such wisedome, that it wil bee as easie to vs to discouer and see that which is in their heartes, as it is to draw water out of a wel or riuer which is at euery ones commaundement. Solomon sheweth vs this, saying, And a man of vnderstanding will drawe it out. It is not without cause that hee sayth, A man of vnderstanding, Math. 7. 15. Act. 20. 28. Rom. 16. 17. for it is very needefull that one haue a neere regarde too drawe out such counsell. Our Lorde and Sauiour sheweth it vs: and the
Apostle Saint Paule. True it is that the Lorde to giue vs the more occasion to watch, permitteth for a time that wee bee some∣what deceiued by hypocrites, to the ende also that afterwardes, ha∣uing our eies opened, we may knowe, that it is hee alone, who gi∣ueth vs the vnderstanding howe to drawe out that which lay too deepe for vs before. 6 The mightie man is named a well doer: but who shal finde a faithfull man? It is the manner of worldly men, which seeke to get some of the substance of the riche, to flatter them, and curry fauour with them, calling them wel doers. It is al one to them if they lye, ma∣king them beleeue that if in times past they haue receiued nothing of their benefites, yet by such flatteries in time to come they wil in∣duce them to be beneficial to them. Solomon expresseth this in briefe, saying, The mightie man is named a well doer. Nowe as hee is called a man beneficial, or wel doer, hee ought also to bee so: for the Scripture giueth not such a name in vaine, neither heere, nor els where: and this is not to aduance flatterers and encrochers, but Luke. 22. 25 Rom. 13. 3. to mainteine the good and iust. But it is a thing very rare to finde a Prince or great Lorde, which answereth to the titles that are attri∣buted vnto him, as experience doeth wel shewe, whereto Solomon hath regarde saying, But who shall finde a faithfull man? Although it bee vniuer∣sally true, and without exception, that God alone is faithful, and that al men are vntrue: notwithstanding in this place (as the sense requi∣reth it, and because he hath spoken in the beginning of the sentence of a mightie man) wee wil take the man for him which is in prehe∣minence and authoritie, and wil vnderstand that Solomon accuseth heere the mightie of disloyaltie, oppression, andviolence, because Esa. 1. 21. & 3. 13. & 5. 23 Amos. 2. 6. they doe not answere to their title of well doing, but in steede of being men of benificence, they are theeues, robbers, murderers, and homicides, as is laide against them in the scriptures.
7 Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iust: and his chil∣dren shalbe happy after him. We desire naturally to be reputed iust, and that al goe well in our family, not onely during our life, but also after our decease. Nowe to the ende wee haue no vaine reputation, but bee iust indeede, yea before God, and that wee ourselues haue witnesse thereof in our owne consciences: Solomon sheweth vs the way that wee ought to walke in, when hee saith, He that walketh in his integritie, is iust: and his children shall bee happy, &c. Hee saith not, hee which referreth him∣selfe to bountie and vertue of his neighbour, and attendeth to his merites: to the ende wee doe not as the Papistes doe, which re∣commend themselues to the merites of Saints which are departed, and attende on the suffrages and workes of supererogation of fat bellied Monkes. It is not meete that wee bee fainte hearted, to rest and take breath, nor that wee ease and repose ourselues, as if our legges were a weary, or our feete chafed: but wee ought too walke being conuersant with our neighbours in sounde and pure conscience, without malice, fraude, or any disguisement: and doing frankely to our neighbours, as wee woulde they shoulde doe vnto vs, keeping loyaltie to them, and loue vnfained, being ready rather to endure damage, then to hurt another man. This is the integritie in the which al faithful men ought to walk, to deale purely and iustly in the house of the Lorde, which is his Church. This is wel taught vs in the scriptures. If wee walke in suche integritie, wee are of the number of them which haue place in the house of the Lorde: Psa. 15. & 24 Psa. 33. 4. 15. Psa. 3. 5. wherevpon ensueth that hee accepteth vs as iust: For the woorde of the Lorde is righteous, and al his workes are faithful. Hee loueth righteousnesse and iudgement: the earth is full of the good∣nesse of the Lorde. For thou art a God which louest not wicked∣nes. The wicked shal not dwel before thee. It foloweth also that we walke according to his lawe: for there is no integritie but that which is taught vs by the woorde of God. One may see this clearely in the Psalme 119. 1. and in many places of the same Psalme,
And seeing it is so that our integritie, lyeth in keeping of the Lawe of God, the which is not in our power, it followeth that of our¦selues wee cannot walke in our integritie. And therfore although it bee called ours, and that it is the way of iustice: yet neuerthe∣lesse let vs take heede to glorifie ourselues in our owne way, as if of ourselues wee did walke so: but let vs aske the guiding and gouernment of our God. Otherwise wee cannot walke according to his commandements, as is shewed vs in many places by his pro∣mises, Psal, 25. 4 119. 33. wherewith wee shoulde not haue to doe, if of ourselues wee had the power to doe that which hee promiseth. Wherfore al∣so although it be said, that who so walketh in his integritie, is iust: let vs not imagine that our integritie maketh vs iust. But when wee walke rightly and roundly, without dissimulation or fraude in that which God hath taught vs by his worde, wee haue a certaine argument that wee are iust: for wee bring foorth the fruites ther∣of, the which make vs not iust, but because God iustifieth, and sanctifieth vs by his spirite, we bring foorth the fruits of iustice: and 1. Ioh. 37. so walking in integritie wee haue witnesse that we are iust. Also we are certaine of our election to eternal life: for them that he hath predestinated, he hath also called, & thē that he hath called, he hath also iustified: and them that hee hath iustified, hee hath also glorifi∣ed. Rom. 8. 30. And so wee haue testimonie of being blessed, not onely for ourselues, but also for our children after vs: as Solomon pronoun∣ceth saying, And his children shalbe happy or blessed after him. Not that the father deserueth it, nor yet the children, but it is by the meere mercy of GOD according to his promise. Wherefore wee ought to vnderstande the promise that Solomon maketh here, according as the Apostle Saint Paule expoundeth it. All they Gen. 17. 7 Exo. 20. 6 Rom. 9. 6. which are borne after the fleshe, of iust people, are not iust, nor blesse for the same: and contrariwise, they which proceede of the wicked, are not vnhappy therefore: as it is shewed to vs ve∣ry well in Ezechiel, Chapter 18. 8 A king which sitteth in throne of iudgement, chaseth away all euill with his looke.
Kinges, Princes, Magistrates, and Superiours of the earth are so much doted ouer their owne greatnesse, and preheminence, that they thinke one ought to tremble vnder them, when in the meane time they passe their dayes in pleasure, and make good cheere, slee∣ping, and resting at their ease, without taking care to minister iu∣stice, and regarde to roote out the wicked reprochful, and insolent. Whereby it commeth to passe that il deedes increase and indure, and it is an hard thing to remedie it: for this cause Solomon being willing to amende such disorder, and loosenesse, admonisheth kings of their duetie, saying, The king, &c. Hee wil first of al that Magistrates bee not as them, whome God complaineth of by his Prophet Esay: but that they bee set in the throne, not of pride, pompe, and vaine magnifi∣cence, nor of oppression, outrage, and violence (as the most parte of them which haue the title of administratours of iustice, come to possesse the seate, for to make their own profite by wrōging others) but that they be set in seate of iudgment, that is, in what part soeuer they bee, their affections and studies tend, to do right to euery one, to punish the wicked, mainteine the good, and deliuer the feble and oppressed from the violence, tyranny, and crueltie of the wicked. Secondly, as God, (whose liefetenants they are) beholdeth with his eies al things: so he wil that kings haue eies, that is to say, care and diligence, to watch ouer them which are giuen them in charge, and of whome they haue the gouernment, to the ende they may banish and chace away al wickednesse, and that trueth, iustice, holinesse, & innocency may raigne: and because what heede or diligence soe∣uer kinges and princes vse, yet they are neuer of themselues suffici∣ent to chace away al euil: but they haue neede too haue honest mē to beare charge vnder them, as Iethro admonisheth Moses ther∣of: also king Iosaphat constituted Iudges. For this cause the kings Exo. 18. 14. 2. Chro. 19. 5 eies may bee taken also for them which helpe him to administer iu∣stice. This while it is not meete to say that it is lawful, to referre himselfe to them wholy, without taking heede there to himself: for if he make no account to looke with his owne eies, and his officers doe any vniustice, the fault shalbee imputed to him. It is meete meete therefore that superiours which appoint officers vnder them regarde neerely what men they bee that they appoint. For the rest,
although euery one ought to helpe his neighbour, and defend him, so much as is possible, from al oppression, and violence, yet is it not lawful for particular persons which are not in office, to place them¦selues vpon the throne of iudgement, for to chase away euil. Solo∣mon sheweth it wel, when hee attributeth this same to kinges. So doeth our Lorde Iesus Christe when hee reprehendeth the Apostle Peter, for the cut eare. Matth. 26. 52. 9 Who shall say, I haue cleansed my hearte: I am cleane from my sinne? It is written that God created man to his owne image and likenesse: whereto Ecclesiastes hauing regarde, saith: That GOD Gen. 1. 27. Eccle. 7. 30. hath made man iust and right, but by vnthankefulnesse, and mis∣knowledge, by arrogancy and rebellion, he hath soone defaced and abolished this image, and is fallen from his righteousnesse: as is seene in Gen. 3. and Ecclesiastes signifieth it, when in this place afore al∣leadged, hee sayeth that men haue sought out many inuentions. Now man by his fal is somuch corrupted and made seruant to sinne and death, that all his posterity is infected therewith. Inso∣much that none is exempt from sinne, but all are so hardly bound therto that they cannot free themselues. And this is not in the out∣warde partes onely that hee is suche a one, but principally in the in∣warde partes, which soyle, and corrupt the other members. And therefore Solomon demandeth not, who hath washed his handes or feete? or, who hath cleansed his body? for the outwarde wa∣shinges or bodily purginges, although ordeined in the lawe, serued to no ende, but rather were hurtful, but that they were instruments to conduct the person to search his spirituall purgation in the blood of Iesus Christ, and to knowe that he had neede to bee clensed in∣wardely, but he asketh: Who will say, I haue purged my hearte, I am cleane from my sinne? Wherein weee ought to learne that the filth and infection
which soileth and corrupteth the person, is of the heart, and that the prrincipal care that wee ought to haue of ourselues, is that wee be pure and neate in our heartes and consciences, which thing we can∣not attaine to by faith and repentance. Let vs beware of resembling the Scribes and Pharisees, to whome Iesus Christ obiecteth their Mat. 23. 25. hypocrisie. Neuerthelesse the principal meaning of Solomon (when hee maketh such interrogation) is to shew vs, that man, be hee neuer so iust and holy, ought not, nor cannot truely vaunt him¦selfe, that hee is pure and cleane from sinne. This hath been she∣wed by the figures and shadowes of the lawe, when it behooued vs so oft to renewe the sacrifices, oblations, and washings: and be∣fore Solomon, Dauid wel shewed it, when hee was so heedeful, to aske stil pardon for his sinnes. It behooueth vs also to learne so of 1. Kin. 8. 46. Eccle. 7. 21. Psa. 19. 13 14. & 25. 6. 7 11. & 51. 3. 4. 5 Luk. 18. 1. Mat. 6. 12. Luk. 18. 9. 1. Ioh. 1. 8. 9. 10. Esai. 64. 6. 8. Psa. 143. 2. Rom 7. our Sauiour, when hee wil, that one pray without cease, and hee teacheth vs to demaund pardon for our sinnes: And when he shew∣eth by the similitude of the Pharisee, & the Scribe, that man ought not to trust in himselfe. It is meete we learne it also of Saint Iohn. Knowe wee therefore, that wee ought not to vaunt of our clean∣nesse, but in al humilitie and mistrust of ourselues, say with Esay, We are al as filth and doung, and al our righteousnes is, as a spotted peece of cloth, &c. And therefore wee shoulde pray with the same Prophet, Nowe goe too Lorde, thou art our Father, we are the claye, and thou art hee which formest vs, and we are al the workes of thy handes. Lord be not so angrie against vs, neither remember our iniquities any more. And with Dauid. Lorde enter not into iudgement with thy seruant, &c. And that wee perceiue clearelie (as Saint Paule did) that there is no goodnesse in vs. Thus doo∣ing wee shal not proudly vaunt ourselues to haue purged our heartes, but wee shalbee humbled, and then GOD will ex∣alt vs. 10 Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of measures, both these are abhomination vnto the Lorde. When Marchants which seeke to enrich themselues by the hurt
of others, vse wicked and vnlawful fetches which they cal subtitle, to the end to disguise the commodie and set it foorth to make it ap∣peare better then it is, or of more measure and weight, or selling it dearer to the simple, then to the skilful, they thinke not that God re∣gardeth it, much lesse that hee taketh ill the iniquitie which they commit in deceauing their neighbours, selling them as deere as they can, either with disceite, or with lesse weight or measure then is lawful: they perswade themselues that God hath other thinges to doe, then to to settle themselfe to see if there be true dealing a∣mongest merchantes or no, for they thinke, that it is but aduenture or fortune, or suttletie, or diligence, which is the cause of making a man riche. This while, although in crauing their trade of fraude, and trumperie, of theft and robberie, they acknowledge not God as they ought to doe: neuertheles they are greatly to blame because they doe against their owne consciences. For they woulde be loath to haue one vse them so, and woulde soone condemne as wicked, al suche as vse suche traffickes, were it not that they were of the same trade, and studie to get profite thereby. But when God hath a care ouer hearbes, and litle birdes, yea, ouer the heares of our Mat. 9. 26. & 10. 29. heades, which wee esteeme no great matter, it is good to vnder∣stande that hee regardeth wel howe men vse vs, and taketh it not in good parte, if one beguile vs, or pil and powle vs: but hath in hate and abhomination, them which vse fraude and disceite. So∣lomon sheweth it, saying, Twoo manner of weights, &c. Heere wee see howe for the ini∣quitie of the disceitful, things without sense, & dead, which can do neither good nor harme, are abhominable before God, much more they which so abuse them. Which thing Solomon also wil that we should vnderstande by this present sentence. Also it is good reason, that such disceiuers be abhorred of the Lord. For, asmuch as in them lyeth they falsifie them: for weights, and measures are the woorke of the Lorde. There is none but hee feeleth himselfe greatly offen∣ded, if one seeke to make false his worke: wee ought not therefore to maruel if God abhorre them that sell by false waight and mea∣sure, Pro. 16. 11. or which haue one weight to buy by, & another to sell by. This falshood, & diuersitie is marked, or noted, when Solomon doubleth
the words, saying, Two maner of weights, & two maner of mea∣sures: which is to say, the great, to buye by; and the litle, to sel by. And they that haue a double measure of corne, the great to buy by, and the litle to sel by, are al abhominable before God. Although we had but a natural light which taught vs to doe to our neighbours, as wee would they should doe vnto vs, yet wee ought to be iust in weight and measure: And by farre more reason, when God com∣mandeth it. 11 The childs also shalbe knowne by his conuersation, whe∣ther his workes be pure and right. Many thinke that one ought to let children doe according to their owne phansie, not vexing them, nor constreining them at al to keepe themselues vpright, and vse honest dealings, & good ma∣ners, nor to accustome their wittes to practise things pure & right, to exercise their tongues and handes therein, and others members as neede and oportunitie require. At leastwise, there are many fa∣thers and mothers, there are many Superiours and Gouernours, which haue no care to holde youth vnder in feare, and refourme their insolencie and dissolution. Whereof it commeth, that when children are more in age, they are of wilde and wandering wittes, of peruerse and corrupted willes and affections, and applie not their members but to vanitie and follie, to shame, and filthines, to works wicked and abhominable. And when they are come to perfect mans age, according to the time of life, they neither can nor wil finde in their heartes to change, but if they could they would by their willes waxe far woorse: as one may see by experience, when they prouoke young folkes to giue themselues to pastime, with al insolencie, and loosenes of life, and that they desire also to be young againe, to ac∣complishe the desires of the fleshe, in their concupiscences. But be∣cause wee ought to couet that our children shoulde become honest men, and reioyce to see them in good company, whereby wee may iudge, and hope, that in time to come, they wil gouerne themselues honestly in al purenesse, and vprightnesse, it is not meete that wee be of this foolishe opinion, or that wee folowe this negligence. But that wee be heedful, and diligent, to guide and keepe youth which is
cōmitted to our charge, bringing thē vp in the feare & knowledge of the Lorde, to the ende, that as muche as in vs lyeth, wee teache our children and seruants good and honest maners, and that we ac∣custome them in the same: insomuche that wee seeke to bring to passe that they giue themselues thertoo, and take pleasure therein, and applye al their whole studies thervppon: if wee can gaine thus muche of our young folkes, wee haue good hope that in tyme to come they wil walke vprightly, and giue themselues to cleane and pure woorkes. Solomon affirmeth and pronounceth it, saying, The childe also shalbe knowne, &c. Let vs not thinke that he spea∣keth according to the maner and opinion of wise worldlinges, who iudge of children in the time to come, according as they see them enclined of themselues, without the worde of the Lorde. For such an inclination be it neuer so faire, is but filth, vanitie, hypocrisie, and wickednesse. But hee wil that by the worde of God, wee gouerne young age, and that wee vse them to honest and religious conuer∣sation. It is verie necessarie to doe so: for this worde is the rule of al ages, Dauid sheweth it wel. And Saint Paule praiseth Timo∣thie, Deut. 4. 9. 10. & 6. 6. 7. & 11. 18. 19. Psal. 34. 12. 2. Tim. 3. 15. in that euen from his youth hee hath had knowledge in holie letters. 12 The Lorde hath made both these twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to see. The worlde is giuen to speake foule and filthie, iniurious and yl wordes, in diuers sortes: To doe also detestable, hurtful, vilai∣nous and infamous woorkes. And although the conscience of ma∣ny, yea, of al, almost reprooue them, yea make them to tremble, wil they, nil they, neuertheles they striue to persuade themselues that God heareth not their speeches, nor seeth not their doings, But if a workeman which hath made a worke, doe know the same in al partes, and wotteth wel to what vse his worke is most proper: By a farre more reason, it is meete we doe this honour to our Lord Psal. 59. 7. & 64. 6. God, and Creator, to acknowledge and confesse, that there is, nei∣ther wordes nor woorkes in the worlde which hee heareth not, or
seeth not, bee they neuer so hid, and secret. Solomon sheweth it wel when he saith, The Lorde hath made both these twoo. &c, Hee nameth but two for briefnesse sake. But that which hee let vs vnderstande, that there is no parte or member of man which hee hath not made, and which hee hath not himselfe placed vppon the body as seemed him Iob. 10. 8. Psa. 139. 5. 1. Cor. 12. 18 good. Then if it bee so (as of force wee must beleeue it is so) it fol∣loweth that there is neither breath nor motion in any part of mans body, but God seeth it and vnderstandeth it. And therefore it is by good right, that the Psalmist complaineth of the wicked which vse violence, and perswade themselues that God neither heareth nor seeth any thing. Also because they play so with God, hee pronoun∣ceth them accursed by his Prophete Esay. Let vs learne therefore Psa. 94. 6. 7. Esa. 29. 15. heere to apply al our senses to heare, say, and doe, that which God hath ordeined by his woorde, without despysing or mockery at all, knowing that hee which hath made vs, is alwaies present with vs. And if wee abuse our members, which ought to bee the temples of the holy Ghost, let vs knowe that God wil cal vs to accompt there∣of, Psa. 139. which wee shal not absolutely performe, and therfore hee wil destroy vs, yea without any difficultie, ad Dauid signifieth wel when Psa. 59. 9. he saith, But thou Lorde wilt haue them in derision, and wilt laugh al the heathen to scorne. Wee merite and deserue well then to bee derided, despysed, and reiected of our God, if wee abuse our members. For it is an in∣fallible argument that the inwarde parte is infected, and corrupted, when the outwarde hath his mouings. And thus wee are wholy and intyrelie infected and filthy, and by consequent abhominable before our God, whose handywoorkes wee abuse wickedly. Let vs learne moreouer that if there bee any likelyhood of good∣nesse in our members, not to forget ourselues nor to bee puft vpp with pryde, to despyse them which seeme not too bee so prompt and ready as wee thinke ourselues to bee: But in all humilitie and modestie acknowledge GOD, who hath gi∣uen vs the vertue that is in our members, to the ende wee em∣ploy it to his glorie and the profite of our neighbours. Other∣wyse wee are vnthankeful and proude: for without the ayde of
him which hath giuē vs eares & eyes, we can neyther heare nor see. Balaams Asse saw the Angel. The eies of the two that went to Emaus Nom. 22. 23 Luke. 24. 16 were closed. For the rest, let vs note that if of ourselues wee haue not the outward senses, nor the motions thereof, then of ourselues we cannot haue that which is more excellent, as our spirites, and the motions of them which proceede of the regeneration of the holy Ghost to conduct vs in al holinesse, and innocencie. For he that cā∣not do the litle, cannot doe the much: knowe we therefore that our spirits cannot rightly contemplate nor vnderstande but that God is their helper. Also although wee take paine to giue counsel, and to gouerne, yet our labour is in vaine, if God doe not gouerne it. The common sorte heare and obay their superiours, if GOD giue them good vnderstanding and tractable heartes. Princes see cleere∣ly, and are wise, and giue good order, and foresee well for the com∣mon wealth, if they bee ayded by GOD. This may somewhat be vnderstoode by the Psalmist, wherefore we haue to followe the Psal. 33. 13. Iames. 1. 5. counsell of S. Iames. That if any of you haue lacke of vnderstan∣ding, let him demande it of God, who giueth it to al men simply, and it shalbe giuen him, &c. 13 Loue not sleepe, lest thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maist haue bread ynough. There is no man which in his owne phansie is desirous of po∣uertie: Neuerthelesse many sommon it with great hast not mouing a foote but resting at their ease, as the slouthful doe. And Solomon Prou. 10. 11. hath somewhat touched it: but he wil not that we resēble such slug∣gards, as he declareth vnto vs, saying, Loue not sleepe. &c. Hee for∣biddeth not one to take his rest, and sleepe, for it is a thing natural to men, which proceedeth not of sinne. For if sleeping had procee∣ded of sinne, our Lorde Iesus Christ had not slept as hee did. And men of force must sleepe, as experience sheweth vs. For without Gen. 2. 21. sleepe they coulde not performe their businesse. But it is meete that sleepe bee moderate, and temperate and that it be taken at conueni∣ent Mat. 8. 24. houres. That we resemble not them, which are not content to sleepe a nights, but also spend therein the most part of the day: Nor they which take their pleasure, to play a nights, & then make the day their night, lying, and sleeping til breakefast or dinner bee ready.
Solomon forbiddeth vs the loue of sleepe, after the maner of such folkes, to the ende it happen not, that pouertie assaile vs: not that hee meaneth, that the thing which ought principally to keepe vs from the loue of sleepe, is the feare of pouertie: but hee hath re∣garde to that which wee feare naturally aboue al thinges, excepte death, and threateneth the slouthful with that, which they feare wil betide them. And after this threatening, hee admonisheth vs to wakefulnes, when hee saith, Open thy eyes, &c. not to playes, and pastimes, and other dissolutions and insolencies, as there are many who are too muche wakeful about the same, but hee admonisheth vs to watche about our buisinesse which is committed vs to doe, as hee sheweth by the promise which hee addeth, saying, That thou maiest haue bread enough, for hee saieth, Hee that laboureth the earth, shalbe satisfied with bread. In eche labour is abundance, the Pro. 12. 11. & 14. 23. & 13. 4. soule of the diligent shalbe satisfied. 14 It is naught, it is naught, saieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himselfe aside, he boasteth of his bar∣gaine. As there are wicked sellers which disguise their wares, extolling it, and praising it, and setting it out farre more then they ought, by lying and swearing, or rather forswearing, to the ende to sel it for the most that they can: and sel it with lesse measure or lesse weight, or in some other maner of way, vnlawful: So are there buiers which are litle better, for they wil doe nothing but watche how they may deceiue the sellers, and chiefly when they thinke that they are not skilful and wylie, but proceed in simplicitie, or vnderstand not what the ware is woorth, or els are so needie, that they are constrayned to sel that which they haue, at a smal price: then the suttle and craf∣tie buyers, knowe howe to disprayse the same, saying, that they knowe where is as good, and at a better price, or varie so muche, that they make them forget the number, or els wil haue more weight, or measure, then it behooueth them, or wil giue some mo∣ney in hande, and the rest take at credite, neuer to paye. The expe∣rience thereof is but too manifest. Neuertheles, Solomon letteth not to shewe it vs, when he saieth,
It is naught, it is naught, saieth hee, that buieth. Hee spea∣keth so, to the ende, to shewe buiers, which wil haue things almost for nothing, that the holie Ghost knoweth wel their malice, and that against their consciences they dispraise in wordes, that which they woulde buye, and which they knowe to be of a good value, for after that they haue obtained it at a lowe price, they scoffe and iest at the seller behinde his backe, and glorifie themselues in the deceite they haue wrought. Solomon speaketh so, when he sayeth, But withdrawing himselfe aside, hee boasteth of his bargaine. Some say, Naught, naught, sayeth he, that possesseth: but when the thing goeth away, then hee praiseth it. Wherein they vnderstand, that Solomon blameth those which are not content with their estate and condition, and neuer say wel thereof: but when they are falne into a woorse, then they acknowledge and confesse that they were wel. Then according to this seconde sense, let vs learne to content ourselues with our calling, although it be poore, and laboursome, knowing that wee haue nothing, be it good or euil, but it commeth by the wil of God our father, to whome wee owe al obedience. and to take al in good parte at his handes, to prayse it, and giue him thankes for it. For in what sort soeuer hee afflict vs, he neuer depriueth vs of those thinges which hee knoweth are needefull for vs. 15 There is golde and a multitude of stones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel. The fleshly and wordly men, which wil bee fine and gaie in their bodies, houses, and also in their riches and treasures, seeke to decke themselues with goldringes, fayre and riche Pearles, and stones verie precious, Chaines of golde, and other ornamentes a∣bout their garmentes: And as farre foorth as they can, they garnish their houses with vessels of golde and siluer, to the ende, that all shine with them, and men haue them in admiration: for suche sightes do dimme the eyes of the poore which are simple, & would gladly bee of power to appeare like vnto them. So also they seeke to hoarde vp in their treasuries, great sommes of gold and money.
And when they are so enriched, they please themselues greatly, as being possessours of the most precious thinges of the worlde. And indeede there is no worldly thing more precious than golde and pearle. Also the holie Scripture (to applye it selfe to our rudenesse) beeing willing to shew vs the excellencie of the worde of God, and howe wee ought greatly to esteeme it, compareth it to gold, siluer, and precious stones. It is onely because of our rudenesse, that such Ps. 12. 7. & 18. 31. Mat. 13. 44. Psa. 19. 10. a comparison is made. For the woorde of God surmounteth infi∣nitely, and incomprehensibly al riches of the worlde. And there∣fore, if wee esteeme and praise worldly thinges that are precious, it behooueth vs farre more to be affectioned to the worde, and say with a pure, and cleane heart, The iudgementes of the Lorde are more to bee desired than golde, and more sweete than honie, &c. The doctrine of thy mouth is better vnto mee then a thousande 11. & 119. 72. 127. Pro. 3. 13. peeces of golde, or siluer. I haue loued thy commandementes more then gold or Iewels. Solomon hath shewed vs heeretofore, that wee ought to be so affectioned to this worde. Hee sheweth it vs presently, when he saith, There is golde, &c. Wee ought to esteeme nothing more pre∣cious then the worde of trueth, which is spoken vnto vs by the lippes of the Ministers of the Lorde. That worde is the knowledge which maketh their lippes precious. And if the worldly sort do take pleasure, and delight their eyes when they see fayre Iewels of gold, and precious stones, by a farre more reason, wee ought to bee at∣tentiue to the lippes of knowledge, to receiue it, not as the seede which falleth by the high way, or on rockie grounde, or amongest thornes, to receiue thereby some transitorie or temporal tast: but as the good earth doeth which maketh the seede to flourishe: so it behooueth vs to receiue this knowledge in heart pure and neate, thereby to reioyce and feede our soules. Not as they which feede onely their eyes, when they beholde any fayre Iewel, and after∣warde haue no fruition thereof. But if wee receiue the word with a good hearte, it wil remayne with vs for euer, and wil ne∣uer departe from vs: for it is not like fraile and transitorie things, but endureth and abideth for euer.
And therefore Saint Peter counselleth vs to loue one an other in Esai. 40. 6. 7. 8. 1. Pet. 1. 23. heart purely, being regenerate not of corruptible seede, but incor∣ruptible, to wit, the worde of God, liuing, and enduring for euer. If wee desire to come to this, let vs folowe the counsel that Solo∣mon giueth vs. Get thee (saieth hee) from a foolishe man, &c. Pro. 14. 7. Thus doing, we shal not onely haue pleasure to heare the lippes of knowledge, but also our heartes shalbe so replenished with science, that of the abundance there of, our lippes shalbe opened, and speake to the praise of God, and the edification of our neighbours, after the counsel of Saint Paul. Ephe. 5. ver. 19. 20. 19 Take his garment that is suretie for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne sake. The Lorde God in his lawe permitteth, that one take a pledge of him to whome hee hath lent any thing, but hee wil that incon∣tinent the pledge bee giuen againe to the poore, and that rather one Mat. 5. 42. Luk. 6. 30. 35. endure some losse, then to bee vnkinde and cruel towarde the indi∣gent, and needie, folowing that which Iesus Christ hath taught vs. Solomon folowing the lawe, wil that wee take heede of loosing our goods which we lende, and for the suretie thereof, to take a pledge, for hee sayeth, Take his garment, &c. And therefore he speaketh not of ta∣king a pledge betweene brother and brother, that is to say, of him that is of the same nation, and religion with him that lendeth, and taketh pledge, as there is expresse mention made therof in the law: for it saith not, when thou lendest to whosoeuer, but, to thy neigh∣bour, to wit, hee that is a Iewe by nation and religion as thy selfe, but hee speaketh of people which knowe not one another, nor knowe not the faculties, and neede the one of the other, as may bee seene by that, where hee saieth, A stranger: but for exposition he saieth also, The vnknowne. For this cause hee maketh no mention of restoring the gage againe straight way. Neuertheles, let vs not thinke, that hee wil permit more or greater rigour then God doeth
in his lawe. For (as it hath beene touched) The lawe speaketh of them which are of the same nation and religion, and which knowe one another, and howe eche thing standeth amongst one another. And Solomon speaketh of the vnknowne, and willeth that one bee careful to take good assurance, for one knoweth not whether they be men of a good conscience, and conuersation, or prodigal, and excessiue in expences, as dicers, gluttons, drunkardes, and whore∣maisters. In whose handes it is not good to trust ones goods: but if hee doe, to take a sure pledge for safegarde: for goods are com∣mitted to vs, not to let them goe at randon, but to dispende rea∣sonably, and helpe our neighbours therewith, which are poore and indigent. Meane while, let vs esteeme none as strangers, but those which are of a dissolute life. For Iesus Christ hath vnited vs Ioh. 10. 16. Ephe. 2. 14. all. 17 A man thinketh the bread sweet that is gotten with de∣ceite: but afterwardes his mouth shalbe filled with grauel. Wee ought to knowe by that which is commanded vs in the lawe, and by the great number of aduertisementes which are made vs in diuers places of the Scripture, that God loueth trueth, iustice, innocencie, loyaltie, and humanitie, and wil that wee folow these vertues: where contrariwise, hee hateth lying, iniquitie, false dea∣ling, deceite and crueltie, and al wicked traffickes, deceites, and disguisements, which hee wil in no case that wee vse. Then if wee were the seruantes of God, fearing him as wee ought: if we woulde frankly obeye our heauenly Father, as good children, wee shoulde thinke his commaundementes good, and take great plea∣sure, to folowe and keepe them, being verie loath and sorie to faile in any one pointe of them. But wee are of so corrupt, and wic∣ked a nature, that wee wil not hearken to our God and Father, but thinke that too sharpe and rigorous, which hee commaundeth. It seemeth vs, that hee is too seuere and rigorous, and that wee shoulde neuer haue good daye, if wee shoulde yeelde ourselues subiecte to his wil. For this cause, turning backe, and wholy re∣uolting
from him, reiecting his yoke, wee giue ourselues to the de∣uil, and wil accomplishe his desires as if hee were our good father, and wee his children altogether at his commandement: for as hee Ioh. 8. 44. is a lyer, and father of al lyes, and as hee hath beene an homicide from the beginning, and hath not dwelled in trueth, nor trueth in him: so we loue lying & crueltie, and take delight to liue by fraude and deceit, exaction and oppression. Solomon signifieth this in one worde, when hee saieth, Bread that is gotten with deceit, &c. Hee saieth not abso∣lutely, that suche bread is sweete, but hee saieth, That a man thin∣keth it sweete, wherein hee taxeth greatly the peruersitie, malice, inhumanitie, and crueltie of man, in that hee hath pleasure and de∣light to liue by a wrongful, violent, & outragious meanes, the which bringeth to his neighbour woe and griefe: and is to him verie bit∣ter: for a man can not eate the bread of deceit, but hee must make them eate the fruites of anguishe, whome he deceiueth, pilleth, and oppresseth. So Merchantes and worldly Artificers, which set not before their eyes, nor make no account to loue their neighbours, as muche as in them lyeth, make them eate a sharpe and sowre bread, whome they deceiue. So doe al Princes, Magistrates, and Iudges which loue bribes, and giftes, and which haue respecte of persons: but aboue al the Monkes of the Papacie (who vnder shadowe of their gaie diuine seruice, or rather diabolical, get to themselues the substance of the simple, which beleeue in their lying) make folkes eate a bread so bitter, that the soules are lost and destroyed for euer after it. The bread therefore of falshood, is not sweete ab∣solutely: because it endomageth them of whome it is taken. So doth it also to them that eate it: for their fraudes and theftes, their exactions, and oppressions, their inhumanities, and violences, (which are the bread of falshood or deceit, because they possesse not iustly, the goods which they haue heaped together by suche iniquitie, neither can they vse them lawfully) are finally gree∣uous and noysome to them, as Solomon pronounceth it, say∣ing, But afterwardes his mouth shalbe filled with grauel. Hee vseth heere a similitude of corne, which hath beene threshed on a
dustie flore, or grounde, immediately after the Mill hath bene pic∣ked. Of suche corne one may make fayre breade, but they that shal eate of it, shalbee vexed at the grauel which they shall finde betweene their teeth, for it hath no sauour, but rather hurteth the teeth, when it comes betweene them. So the breade of de∣ceite wil bring in the ende great domage to them which eate it. For through the same they shalbee cast into vtter darkenesse, where shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth. 18 Confirme thy thoughts by counsel: and so make warre with wisedome. The Princes of this worlde haue great thoughtes, and di∣uers, and knowe not for the most parte howe to atchiue them. They esteeme themselues so great and puisant that they dote ouer their owne hautinesse and power, and thinke verily that none shoulde resist them, or at leastwise if they doe, to bee able too beare off the blowes, and easily become conquerours. But expe∣riēce hath shewed it in Pharao, and Sennacherib, and many others, and also sheweth it nowe in our time, that the great men of this worlde are often frustrate of their attemptes: which ought to be a great shame and griefe to them which esteeme of themselues so. Nowe to the ende that faythful and Christian Princes come not to such confusion, Solomon warneth them saying. Confirme thy thoughts by counsel: and somake warre with wisedome. Wherein he assenteth somewhat, that kings & Princes shoulde thinke on that which they haue to doe, and chiefly when there is question of warre. For it is not meete then that they be asleepe. But he wil not that they proceed in the execution of their thoughts, ac∣cording to their phantasies, & opinions. For most cōmonly by their ambition & disordinate desire of raigne & bearing rule, they wil put oftentimes, both them and their subiectes in greate danger.
And therfore he sayth not, Confirme thee in thine own thoughtes of thy selfe, but, by counsel. And that is it which wee haue alrea∣die alledged heeretofore in some places, That Kinges and Princes are not sufficient of themselues alone to rule and gouerne, but they shoulde haue about them, men of good counsel and ade. If they folowe the admonition of Solomon, and that warre be mo∣ued against them, it shalbe easie for them to resist it: as Solomon promiseth, saying, And so make warre with wisedome. For we ought to knowe that Solomon admonisheth not Princes, but be∣cause hee knoweth that the wil of God is suche, as importeth pro∣mise. And that which is also done truely by wisedome, is neuer vn∣done, but hath yssue, and durance. Let vs vnderstande also, that hee commandeth not to make warre, but hee sheweth that for the good guiding of the same, it behooueth to proceede by wisedome not humane, but diuine, which is so say, that one enterprise no warre, but first hee knoweth that God appointeth it: wherevppon ensueth, that it is not lawful for kings & princes, to make warre, to enlarge their limites, and make themselues great earthlings, but for too defende the countrie which GOD hath committed them in charge. Notwithstanding some wil say, that the children of Israel haue assayled many people, and destroyed them by warre. But for an∣swere one may say againe, that one particular feat which God com∣mandeth for a time, ought not to be turned in consequence, to bee made laweful for euery man. One may say moreouer, that that which hath happened to the children of Israel, hath beene done in figure of things to come, to wit, to instruct vs that wee haue no ac∣quaintance with the enemies of God, which are chiefly the Diuel, and our owne sinnes. 19 Hee that reuealeth secrete counsel, turneth to a backe∣byter: wherefore meddle not with him that offen∣deth with his lips.
Solomon accuseth him of backbiting, whome his neighbour hath made priuie of some of his secrete imperfections, to discharge Pro. 11. 13. his heart, and be vnloaded thereof, and to haue some rest in his spi∣rite: when incontinently, hee publisheth that which he hath heard or seene in secrete, to the ende to be welcome amongst the enemies of him which hath bewrayed himselfe, or amongst them which are couetous to heare euil speeches of others. And in this wise, hee striueth to hurt his neighbour, either in his name, or in his goods, or els in his person. Solomon doeth so here, saying, He that re∣uealeth secrete counsel, turneth to a backbiter. And this is, because the world is greatly replenished with reporters of things which pro∣fit nothing, neither to thē which tel them, nor to them which heare them. And so of flatterers which seeke to be welcome vnto them, which delight to heare one praise & extol them, and dispraise others. Likewise of backbiters, which seeke the decaye of their neighbours, and procure it in lying, and speaking false witnesse against them. It is also, because that of our corrupt nature, wee are enclined to co∣uet glorie and praise, and thinke that we should be the rather prai∣sed, if wee speake yl of our neighbours. And if we be not often ad∣uertized of our duetie, we forget ourselues, and applye our tongues (headlong) vnto euil speaking. And because wee are neuer so wel reformed, but stil our nature is inclined, to bee soone agayne corrupted and peruerted, and because euil woordes corrupt good manners. Solomon wil in no case, that we conspire with the back∣biters, nor that wee be familiarly conuersant with them, nor that he consent to them any way. He forbiddeth vs this, when he saieth, Wherefore meddle not with him, &c. It is verie necessarie that wee vnderstande this same, according as it hath bene expoun∣ded. For as long as wee be in this world, it must needes be that dar∣nel must growe amongst the Wheate, but when God hath giuen vs the grace to be Wheate, let vs take heede that wee turne not into darnel. Let vs walke therefore in feare and trembling, and take no pleasure at al to be amongst backbiters, which offende with their lippes, that is, which speake against their consciences, and against that which they knowe to be good and right, and forsake the word of trueth, giuing themselues to lying. Then if it wil doe vs hurt,
to be amongest suche people, muche more ought wee to feare, to agree with them, either in speaking or hearing euil. And wee ought to knowe that when our hearing and speeche are corrupted, the rest is woorth nothing, neither within nor without. 20 The lampe of him that curseth his father or mother, shalbe put out in the depth of darkenesse. After that God had commanded vs to honour father and mo∣ther, hee adioyneth a promise of long life theretoo, which is sin∣gular and special to this commaundement. And therefore Saint Paule sayeth, That this is the first commaundement of promise, and Eph. 6. 2 by this promise, hee giueth hope of felicitie and prosperitie, to chil∣dren which wil be obedient to their fathers, & honour them. Con∣trariwise, hee wil that those children which in steede of honouring father and mother, doe vexe them by disobedience and curses, shalbe put to death, as hath bene alledged heeretofore. Then seeing hee deemeth not suche children woorthie of the life present, it fo∣loweth, that they shalbe depriued of the heauenly light, and sent into vttermost darkenesse. Solomon signifieth this, saying, The lampe of him, &c. This maketh not, that wicked and rebellious children shal haue any lampe of true ioye, and prosperi∣tie, but onely that which they thinke they haue: which as is saide) shalbe put out in the depth of darkenesse. For they shalbee in so great payne, and anguish so sharp, & torments so troublesome, that of the prosperitie which they thought to haue, there shal remaine no whit, neither shal there bee remembrance of it any more. The paines that they shal suffer, shal surmount, al that which hath gone before, as contrariwise, the ioye that the obedient children shal haue of the heauenly prosperitie, shalbe so great, that if in this life they haue suffered payne, griefe, and teares, they shalbe al defa∣ced, and blotted out of remembrance. Wee vnderstande therefore by the Lampe, which is cleare and bright, ioye and prosperitie: And by the darkenesse, sorow, sad∣nesse,
yll lucke, and miserie, according as the Scripture speaketh oftentimes of light and darkenesse, shadowe and obscuritie. And chiefly in Iob, in the Psalmes and Prophetes. But because light signifieth also knowledge, and darkenesse ignoraunce: some say, that Solomon meaneth heere, that rebellious and disobedient chil∣dren shalbe punished with great ignorance: whereof ensueth great decaie. For it must needes be, that those which can not guide them¦selues by the wordes of the Lorde, must perishe. And so in what sense soeuer wee take the lampe, and darkenesse, let vs know that Solomon pronounceth for wicked children, euerlasting perditi∣on. 1. Kin. 11. & 15. 4. 2. Chr. 21. 7. Moreouer, because in the Scriptures a Lampe is taken for po∣steritie. One might say, that Solomon threatneth vnruly children, that their ofspring shalbee of none indurance, and the memorie thereof soone abolished, or that they shal haue no yssue: as is seene to come to passe in many obstinate children, who because they haue not had their parentes in honour as they ought: God hath depri∣ued them of issue, and permitted not that they should enioy that honourable title of father. Whereof also ensueth, that hee disalow∣eth them for his children, and so consequently, they are the chil∣dren of the Deuil. And therefore in which of the three senses so∣euer wee take this sentence, let vs note, that Solomon foretelleth destruction to wicked children. 21 The heritage that is gotten in haste, shal not be blessed in the ende. It is a harde thing for a sensual man to endure pouertie, and therefore eche one flyeth it as muche as hee can, and foloweth the meanes which hee thinketh wil make him riche. And heereby, some haste to get a great heape of golde and siluer; other, marchan∣dise; and others, houses and landes. They thinke that when they haue beene quicke at the beginning, and made haste too make themselues riche, then they shal neuer haue pouertie, but their goods will encrease and multiplie, and they shall growe
euerie day richer and richer. Nowe because they which striue to enriche themselues in haste, proceede therein with an euil consci∣ence (as they themselues wel knowe: for they would not that one shoulde proceed with them, as they doe with others: and so Saint Paule sheweth vs their euil conscience:) for this cause they are at last frustrate of their attempts, and their goods decaie at the twink∣ling 1. Tim. 6. 9. 10. of an eye, and vanishe away, so that they fal into great pouer∣tie, as many feele the proofe thereof. And Solomon speaketh it, saying, The heritage that is gotten in hast, &c. Wherevppon ensueth, that man enricheth not himselfe, in hasting after the goods of this worlde, seeing that the heritage so gotten, is not bles∣sed: for the blessing of the Lorde maketh riche. Which thing A∣braham and other holie fathers, which were not couetous, haue Pro. 10. 20. prooued, as the scripture witnesseth, saying: that God hath bles∣sed them, and multiplied them greatly. On the other side, Achab and Iezabel, were couetous of Naboths Vineyarde, and had it by 1. King. 21. Rom. 22. Rom. 9. and by: but it was not blessed with them. Also the thirtie pence which Iudas receiued, were not blessed with him. Let vs vnderstande therefore, that in this sentence we are taught to doe our businesse carefully, and attende with patience the goods and profite which it shal please God to giue vs, folowing many ad∣monitions of the scriptures alledged heretofore. 22 Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy trust in the Lord, and he shal deliuer thee. We desire al to be out of danger of the violence and outrage of our enemies, and to attaine thereto, it seemeth vs, that there is no∣thing better then to fortisie ourselues, not to susteine and endure patiently the euil which they wil doe to vs (for that wee thinke is for them to doe, which haue no blood in their nayles) but we seeke to fortifie ourselues, to the ende, to recompence the euil which one doeth to vs, or more: for in this case wee seeke (as much as is possible for vs) to owe nothing vnto them, which haue giuen or done vs any thing against our wil.
But it is so muche absent that wee shoulde render ill for il, that we ought to take great heed that it enter not in to our thought to doe any mischiefe, or to render the like to them which doe vs harme. Solomon sheweth it vs wel for he saith not, recompence not euil for euil. But say thou not, &c. When hee forbiddeth one to threaten his neighbour with wordrs which proceede from the hearte: It followeth wel that hee reprooueth the inwarde spring without the which the mouth coulde not vse any threatenings. Also in the Scripture, speache is taken for thought, and chiefly when it is saide, That the wicked say thinges abhominable, the which Psa. 14. 1. notwithstanding they woulde not speake foorth, for although they bee wicked, yet they woulde bee counted honest men, which they should neuer, bee if they were lauishe of their wordes. It is not meete therefore that wee bee reuengeful in our thoughts, nor that we shew ourselues so by words or threatnings, much lesse indeede, and execution. But it behoueth vs to be wary, peaceable, & patient, as Solomon teacheth vs saying, Put thy trust in the Lorde: Hee wil not that wee take paine, to recompence the euil which is doone to vs, but that wee haue regarde to the Lord, hoping vpon his succour and aide, & as∣suring ourselues that hee wil not abandon vs to the wicked wil of our enimies, but deliuer vs therefro. Solomon promiseth it say∣ing, And hee shall deliuer, &c. Hee promiseth nothing heere but the holy fathers haue prooued it. And therefore if wee will be partakers thereof, let vs foll owe their faith and patience: and for to doe it wel, let vs obey that which our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christe teacheth his Apostles. And when hee saith, Put thy trust in the Lorde, let vs not thinke in any wise that the Lord is ab∣sent Mat. 5. 39. 44. Rom. 12. 14. 17. Col. 3. 12. 1. Pet. 3. 9. Psa. 10. 1. &. 13. 2. & 44. 24. from vs, or that he is farre off, although according to our sense, hee bee so, because wee cannot alwayes perceiue his aide in our an∣guishes and tribulations, whereof the Saintes also make complaint. It is onely according to mans sense that hee is absent from vs, for in veritie hee seeth all that is done about vs. Hee is alwaies pre∣sent to assist vs, and aideth vs to the end we fall not in the danger which is prepared for vs as the Saints haue wel knowne. And there. fore after their complaints they comfort themselues with the assi∣staunce
and succour of the Lorde. Note wee also that although God reserue the reuenge to himselfe, neuerthelesse it is not meete that wee shoulde request him to take reuengement ouer our eni∣mies, hauing regarde to vs: but it behoueth vs to put our whole trust in the Lord, referring ourselues wholy to that which seemeth Ps. 10. 14. & 13. 6. him good to doe, without desiring hurt to them which do vs hurt: for such is the will of God, although his office bee to defende the innocent, and punishe and destroy the outragious and oppressours, as hee doeth still at times conuenient: finally, when it is saide that God wil saue them which put their trust in him with patience: let vs note that although God suffer the innocēt to endure oftentimes euen vnto death, by the violence of their enimies: neuerthelesse hee ceasseth not to bee true in his promises, and to fulfil them. For the innocent which haue true patience in their afflictions, and temptations, although they dye in the same, yet they are saued, and deliuered in that they ouercome them, and are victorious by faith, and patience: and thereby obteine eternal saluation, to the which the children of God ought principally to aspire: when they haue any promise to bee saued, and deliuered from the handes of their enimies: for it is then that they are wholy deliuered. 23 Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and false ballances are not good. Solomon hath alreadie aduertised vs in diuers places that wee should bee iust and equitable in that which we haue to change Prou. 11. 1. & 6. 11. & 20. 10. together as wel in buying as selling: and nowe hee admonisheth vs againe of the same, not sticking to pronounce one sentence of∣tentimes to the ende wee flatter not ourselues in falshoodes and deceites, seeme they neuer so little to vs, but that wee knowe, that if we be not vpright, faithful, and loyal to our neighbours, as wee woulde they shoulde bee vnto vs, wee shoulde bee the more inex∣cusable and worthy of greeuous punishment, when wee haue byn dul and sluggishe, or hardened and obstinate in our fraudes, and deceites, after so many admonitions. It is not onely Solomon that hath troubled himselfe to warne vs, but we haue the lawe,
the Prophetes, Iesus Christe, and his Apostles also. Likewise (wil we or nil wee) our owne consciences teache vs the same, when we con∣demne them that vse vs not rightly, loyally, and faithfully, as wee desire: hauing then so many maisters, wee shall greeuously bee pu∣nished, if wee despise to giue them audience and obey them. 24 The steppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then shall a man knowe his owne waies? There is none of vs, but hee naturaly, attributeth to himselfe power to conduct and gouerne himselfe, ann thinketh that hee hath free will and libertie to doe wel or euil. In which thoughts there is great pride: for by this meanes man rauisheth to himselfe the ho∣nour and glory of God, and maketh himselfe his God and his Saui∣our, and leaueth his creature, as if hee had not too doe with him, whereas man ought to humble himselfe, and knowe that he ought in no wise to attribute that to himselfe which is appertinent to Exod. 15. 13. Deut. 32. 10, 11. 12. Ps. 6. & 25. 45. 89. & 27 11. Ier. 10. 23. God. Therefore it is hee that guideth and gouerneth vs. We may also see it in many praiers. Solomon following his praiers saith, Now the steppes of man are in the handes of the Lorde, &c. Whervnto Ieremie accordeth. But we must note that Solomō spea∣keh not, of manners, deedes, deliberations, and affections of man according as he were the sonne of Adam: for therein is nothing but corruptiō, of the which God is not the authour: It is mā which hath corrupted himselfe by his owne wil. But Solomon speaketh of a man, who renouncing himselfe, and declining from his infirmitie and naturall corruption, striueth to thinke wel, say wel, and do wel. We ought to knowe manifestly, that God is the authour of suche steppes according to the testimonies aforesaide: and that Solomon speaketh heere of the steppes of him that forceth himselfe. Hee she∣weth it som what, whē he vseth in his speach here a worde taken of force and puisance, and signifieth man: whereby wee are admoni∣shed that if we haue any powerto apply ourselues to wel doing, that we shold acknowlege it to come of god, & not attribute any praiers to ourselues for the same, but let vs say, The Lord is my strength & Exod. 15. 2. Iob. 12. 13. praise, & he is become my saluatiō, with him is wisdom & strēgth,
counsel, and vnderstanding. Then seeing it is so that our steppes are the Lordes, whose works are incomprehensible to man, it fol∣loweth Psa. 28. 7. 6 35. Esay. 12. 2. that man of himselfe, knoweth not what hee hath to thinke deliberate, say or doe, to flye from vice and followe vertue, as So∣lomon sheweth, saying, Howe then shall a man knowe his owne waies? Heere hee speaketh of man according as if hee were sonne of Adam, and of na∣ture corrupted: also hee sheweth it somewhat, when in his speach to signifie man, hee vseth this worde Adam: and though hee vsed it not, yee wee ought to vnderstand it so, seeing that God hath crea∣ted man from the beginning to his owne Image, and likenesse, and hath made him right or streight: but being corrupted by sinne, hee hath made himselfe ignorant, dul, and bruitishe, not because he hath not naturally sufficient knowledge of the good way which he ought to holde, to the ende hee bee made inexcusable, if his life and con∣uersation bee not such, that by the same, God may bee glorified as hee ought. When therefore Solomon addeth this present interro∣gation, it is as though he saide: If man indued with vertue, haue Rom. 1. 18. neede to beeguided, and gouerned by the Lorde: by a farre more reason the sensual man, which makes no account to resist the affe∣ctions of his fleshe, shal haue no vnderstanding to knowe that which hee ought to follow, neither maketh he account therof, but rather goeth astray. To knowe therefore and to vnderstande our way, not that which we imagine or finde good in our owne sight, but that which God sheweth vs by his worde, (which is called ours, because wee ought to followe it, without declining either this way or that way, but to obey vprightly our Lord god) it is meet we renoūce our na∣tural corruption, to wit, our first Adam, & that the holy Ghost for∣tifie vs, and giue vs courage, and teache vs the right wil of God, wherein lyeth our way, otherwise wee shal remaine dul and igno∣rant. It is not therefore in vs, nor in our free wil, to doe or vnder∣stande that which is our duetie. Neuerthelesse, when God calleth vs, and teacheth vs by his worde, wee ought to striue to walke in the way which hee sheweth vs, and not ceasse to craue his conduict without attending newe inspirations, nor that hee should take vs visibly by the hande, for to leade vs: for the worde that is spoken
to vs dayly, is sufficient to doe that same: for by it the holy Ghost teacheth vs, and guideth vs, if we stop not our senses, and drawe backe ourselues. 25 It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holinesse: and after the vowe, to make enquirie. Because wee see not God with our eies, and that we heare him not with our eares, neither also it seemeth vnto vs that hee neither heareth nor seeth vs: for this occasion wee are not afraide to de∣priue him of the honour which wee doe owe to him, and are abu∣sed so farre, that wee thinke not of the euil which wil come to vs thereby. This while wee ceasse not to be in danger of perdition, as Solomon signifieth, when he saith, It is a ruine for a man, &c. Heere Solomon hath regarde to that which is written of vowes in the lawe, as God woulde that Leuit. 27. 9. Num. 30. 3. Psa. 76. 12. one shoulde doe him this honour, to holde holy that which he hath vowed to him, & not to applie it to prophane vses, but to yeeld it to him according to his promise made. Also when by baptisme we are dedicated to him, and sanctified by the worke, we ought to offer our¦selues continually to his seruice, and to separate ourselues from all prophane thinges, to the ende that wee bee holinesse to the Lord. Exo. 22. 31 Leui. 11. 44 & 19. 2 1. Pet. 1. 14 and that we yeelde ourselues to him, according as wee haue promi∣sed: and also he calleth vs thereto, and commandeth vs, You shalbe holy vnto me, otherwise we shal deuoure holynesse, appliyng it to another vsage then is lawful, and this shoulde bee after the vowes to make inquirie, howe wee shoulde bee deliuered from rendring them to doe then as wee woulde ourselues. And in this sorte wee iest at God, to be iested at of him again: and to be destroyed, as we wel deserue, then to the ende that wee fal not into such inconueni∣ence, let vs followe with perseuerance that which Saint Paule tea∣cheth vs, I pray you therefore brethren that you offer vp your bo∣dies Rom. 12. 11. 2. Cor. 6. 14 a quicke sacrifice, holy, and acceptable vnto the Lord, which is your reasonable seruice. 26 A wise king dispearseth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.
Because there are not many kinges, princes, and superiours in the worlde which make account of vnderstauding or dooing their duetie, but despising gouernment and administration, they giue themselues to pastime, and against all right and reason, fauour them Psa. 2. 10. Deut. 17. 18 1. Kings 3. 9. that are wicked afore the good and the iust. For this cause Solomon knowing that they had neede to be well admonished, too the ende they might returne to doe their duetie wel, or else, be the more in∣excusable, is not content to haue so often afore warned the kinges of that they had to doe, but againe here he admonisheth them of their duetie saying, A wise king &c. Wherein first of all hee sheweth that kinges haue neede of wisedome, according to the admonition of Dauid: And therefore they ought too bee carefull, too regarde the woorde according as it is commaunded them, and that they praye with Solomon, Thou shalt giue to thy seruant a heart, which hath vnderstanding to iudge thy people, and to knowe the good from the euil. If kinges be so wise, they wil not only vnderstand that which they haue to doe, but also minister right to euerie one, according as it appertayneth. Which thing Solomon sheweth vs heere, although he expresse but dispersement and scattering of the wicked: for this is done to conserue the right to the good, and to make them liue in peace. Hee sheweth moreouer that kinges ought to bee mortal ene∣mies to the wicked, in such wise, that as a mightie king pursuing his enemies and smiting them athwart, maketh some to falhere and other some there, so that they cannot rise againe, euen so is it meete that they ouerthrowe and destroy the wicked. And as in the time when they fought and went to warre with waggons or chariottes, they ranne the wheeles ouer the bodies of the enemies, which were smittē down to the groūd, to bruze thē, to the end that they should not reuiue again: so kings & superiours, ought to bruse the wicked, to the ende they haue no more power to doe euil to any body. Hee that woulde vnderstande by the wheele any kinde of torment that the Iewes vsed, it woulde be no inconuenience. For the rest, when Solomon threateneth so the wicked of being dispersed and brused, let vs vnderstande that hee warneth vs too flie from wickednesse, and to giue ourselues to wel doing according as God commandeth
it in his lawe, and according to the ordinances of our Princes and superiours which are wise and prudent, and which seeke not, but that God be serued and honored according to his worde, and their subiects liue in peace, and good vnitie togither. 27 The lampe of the Lorde is the soule of man, searching all the inward partes of the belly. The lampe that is cleere and shyning serueth to many vses: first to guide them that walke by night in the darke, and to make them see their way, to the intent they goe not astray, nor smyte them∣selues against any thing, or fal into any ditch or caue. Secondly, it giueth light to them that are locked in darke prisons, wherein they see neither Sunne nor moone: And for these twoo purposes it is as it were halfe a life to them that vse it, for those that are, or walke in darkenesse, are as it were halfe dead. Thirdly, it serueth to finde things hid in holes, & in the darke. Now that which the lampe doth outwardly, and corporally, the worde of God which liueth & raig∣neth in our harts by the holy Ghost, doeth the same in wardly and spiritually. And therefore the scripture calleth it Lampe or light, & attributeth to the word the things aforesaid: and this is not with∣out cause, for of ourselues we are and walke in darknesse of igno∣rance, not knowing what we haue to doe, and it conducteth vs. Thy woorde serueth for a lampe to my feete, and as a light to my Ps. 119. 105. 130. Rom. 7. 14. Eph. 2. 8. Ps. 19. 8. 9. pathes. Of ourselues we are dead, being seruants & slaues to sinne and death, and the worde lightneth vs, freeth vs, and quickneth vs. Of ourselues wee are hypocrites, and cannot, nor wil not knowe that which is in vs. But the woorde discouereth and reuealeth the things that are hid in the depth of the heart. And so it is not with∣out cause that Solomon saith, The Lampe of the Lorde, &c. For as the soule giueth life to the Iohn. 8. 31. 32. & 16. 8. Heb. 4. 12. Deut. 27. 26. Gal. 3. 10. body, so the word of God maketh man quicke: and principally when man by faith cleaueth to his promises. For by the lawe, wee are accursed and condemned, in so much as wee cannot accom∣plishe it, but wee liue, and are saued by the assurance which wee haue in the promises: for the innocencie, obedience, iustice,
and holinesse, of Iesus Christ are imputed to vs. Neuerthelesse wee ought not to separate the lawe from the promises. For were it not Rom. 5. 18. 19. 1. Cor. 5. 21. Deut. 30. 15. Leuit. 18. 5. Rom. 3. 20. our corruption and naughtinesse, it were to vs a cleere lampe to re∣ioyce and quicken vs as one may see. Also it searcheth well the in∣warde partes of the bellie when it discouereth to a man the malice of his hart. For by the lawe it is giuen to knowe sinne. 28 Mercy and truthe shal preserue the king, and with lo∣uing kindnesse his seate shalbe established. For as much as kings haue not one onely duetie towardes al their subiects indifferently, but it behoueth thē to handle the wic∣ked after one sort, & the good after another: For this cause the holy scripture giueth them now one instruction, and now another, to the end that they may knowe how to render euery one his deserts. We haue seene heretofore, that when Solomon would encourage kings against the wicked, hee hath attributed to them, rigour, seueritie & crueltie, and to make them meeke and gentle towardes the good he Prou. 16. 14. 19. 20. 2. Prou. 16. 35. hath attributed to them mercy and benignitie. And nowe againe he warneth kings of their duetie towardes the good when he saieth, Mercie and trueth, &c. And therewithal hee sheweth them, that to raigne, and beare rule long tyme, and without resistance, it is not meete that they vse tyrannie and crueltie, disceyt, or disloyal∣tie, but that they bee merciful and true. Benignitie regardeth prin∣cipally the subiectes. For they are willingly induced to loue their su∣periours, and obay them freely, when they see them gentle, curte∣ous, pitiful, and that they are more inclyned to mercy then to ri∣gour and seueritie. Trueth also regardeth the subiects. For it is not meete that Princes vse fraude to their subiects, but that they de∣fende and keepe both them and their goods faythfully. Notwith∣standing one may say that trueth hath respect principally to them abrode, with whome Princes haue any thing to practise. For if they wil raigne peaceably and without contradiction, it is meete that they keepe faythfully their promises, and that they seeke no way to breake the fayth promised, neither by disceit nor violence or any other meanes towards them with whome they haue to doe,
if one wil say that mercy regardeth men, and trueth God, I wil notwithstande them: for it is necessary that kinges serue God in trueth according to his worde, eschewing al thinges contrary to the same, and making it bee kept of their subiectes as much as in them lyeth, to the ende that God bee honoured as hee requireth. And also, as it is so that they holde the seate of God, who is iust and true in al his iudgements, it is meet that they iudge with iustice & trueth, without respect of persons, or couetousnesse of giftes and pre∣sents, and that they repulse the lyars, flatterers, talebearers, and backbiters, punishing them, and destroying them with all false wit∣nesses. Thus doing they shalbe preserued, and established in their thrones, as the good kinges haue tried it. Pharao hath not vnder∣stoode this same, neither hath hee beene preserued, but after many plagues hath beene destroyed in the waters of the Sea: one may ioyne Solomons sonne who woulde not handle his people gently. If therefore kinges and princes wil not come to the like condition, let them not lift vp their heartes ouer their brethren: but let them followe the meekenesse of Moses, Iosue, Dauid, Iosias, Ezechias, & such others, which haue been preserued, and haue established their Deut. 17. 20 thrones by benignitie and mercy. And because it is not most com∣monly profitable for the people to change their kinges and princes, when they haue them that gouerne well: subiectes ought to vnder∣stande that they are heere warned to pray to God for their superi∣ours, to the ende it may please him to preserue them. And whiles they liue in this humilitie and obedience, that they giue occasion to their rulers to bee curteous and iust, for to followe their head. 29 The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged. It seemeth at the first, that Solomon speaketh according to the fantasie of young folkes, which glorifie themselues in their force, vaunte of their actes which haue any apparance of vertue, and e∣steeme themselues noble, and worthie to bee had in estimation with the worlde, when they haue behaued themselues valiantly. And also that he speaketh according to the opinion and desire of old
men to whome it seemeth, that it is a great matter to haue liued so long that their bearde and heares are waxen white, and wil that one honour them because of their olde age, which sheweth himselfe in the whitenesse of their heares, although in themselues bee neither knowledge, skil, nor prudence. And if we should take this sentence thus, it were not far amisse: notwithstanding, it behoueth vs to vn∣derstande, that Solomon hath not spoken it to please either the young or the old, nor to make vs sticke at their fantasies and affe∣ctions. But know we that when he saith, The noblenesse of young men is their vertue, hee sheweth first to fathers and mothers, & to al them which haue gouernment or superintendence, if they will that their children, or inferiours become honorable & renowmed, or worthie to be accounted excellent, that they ought to be careful to teach vertue to youth, and to accustome them to the same: not vnto that which one calleth vertue according to the worlde, which is to bee couragious, and to haue blood in the nailes, to render euil for euil, and to doe outrage and violence vnto them which one hath in hate, or to take great paines to become rich, and to keepe (as one woulde say) a good house, such men according to the world are wil∣lingly esteemed noble. But that in following the word of God, one giue good example of life to the younger sort, that one teache them, admonish them, reprehend them, & correct them, and that one ac∣custome them to applie their time in good workes, and that they learne to haue charitie, yea towards their very enimies. See here the vertue, wherein consisteth the noblenes, excellencie, glory, & honor, of young folks. Secondly he sheweth that the younger sort are kna∣uish & infamous, worthy of al rebuke and reproch, if not being wel instructed they fashion not their maners in al humilitie, & modesty, temperance, honestie, holinesse & iustice, according to gods word: for in the obedience and faith of the same there is vertue, & not o∣therwise. Also therein it is that God craueth one to apply his force, Deut. 6. 5. Eph. 6. 16. 17 and S. Paule sheweth wel that there is vertue in the worde: and when Solomon adioyneth, And a gray head is the honor of the a∣ged: he sheweth first of al to old folkes, that they ought to be graue temperate, wise, prudent, acknowledging that God hath done them this honour to haue mainteined them in this life so long that they are waxen white, and to haue giuen them space to learne vertue,
and followe the same, that they might haue vice in disdaine, and be an edification to the younger sort. Secondly, he sheweth to them that are young, that they ought not to puffe vp themselues in pride and disdaine against their elders, although for the feeblenesse, and debility of the body they seeme vnprofitable, & a let or hinderance, but in al humilitie and gentlenesse they ought to forbeare them, & with al care and diligence to assist, and honor them, in such sort that they be wholy at their commandement. It is necessary that wee Leui. 19. 23. learne this in this present sentence, otherwise there will bee no ex∣cellencie in the same. Let vs not thinke therfore that Solomon hath forced himselfe to teach vs carnal or temporal nobilitie, wherof the worlde makes account, through some force, magnanimity and hard∣dinesse, which they perceiue in the deedes and feates of some per∣sonage led by glory and ambition: nor that hee maketh great ac∣count of the white heares which are on the chin, or on the head of old men: for al this passeth, but the vertues which he teacheth vs in this sentence, are in eternal memory before God, and they which follow them shal remaine for euer. 30 Brused woundes purge euill: and stripes in the inward partes of the body. When we are bodyly sicke, wee wil be handeled gently, and it seemeth vnto vs that the Phisitions and Surgeons are vncurteous, and haue no compassion vpon vs, when they ordeine vs sharpe me∣dicines, or apply to vs any pearcing ointment, or other thing which augmenteth the dolor for the present time. Neuerthelesse it is need∣ful & necessary that somtimes one spare not the patient for to purge and cleanse him of the filth and corruption which is in his body. O∣therwise he is in danger of his person for the life present. Also al∣though we be very euil, & that this euilnesse hath so corrupted vs, that al our conuersation is polluted & defiled therby, and that there is in vs no intire thing: neuerthelesse we woulde haue others to flatter vs, and account vs for honest men: and thinke that they which admonish vs, reprehende vs, checke vs, & threaten vs, accuse vs, and condemne vs, are our enimies and hate vs. But it is necessary to purge the inwarde naughtinesse which corrupteth al our conuersation, that men rebuke vs sharpely, and threaten
vs rigorously, and that they plundge vs euen into the depth of hell, making vs dispaire of ourselues, as if without remedie wee were wounded, and murthered euen vnto the death. This is the way to cleanse the wicked, which are very muche infected, corrupted with vice and iniquitie, and yet flatter themselues in their owne diseases. Solomon pronounceth it so, saying, Brused woundes purge euill. Dauid after the adulterie and murder flattered himselfe wel, when he made no account to confesse his faultes. But the sharpe & sowre reprehension of Nathan, serued him for a purgation. So did the re∣prehension of Saint Paule to the Corinthians. But let vs note that Solomon speaketh not of the wicked reprooued: for to suche men rorrection profiteth nothing, but to make them obstinat, and bring them in despaire, as Cain, the whole worlde destroyed by the flood, 2. Sa. 12. 12. 1. Cor. 5. 1 2. Cor. 7. 8 Sodome, Pharao, Saule. The xxi. Chapter. 1 THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, so hee may turne it whither soeuer hee will. THE kinges of the earth are in great estimation and admiration with the worlde, men feare them & worship thē, men trēble at their puisāce ho∣nouring their highnesse, and hum∣bling themselues vnto them, ren∣dring them obedience, and fearing to prouoke their anger, submitting themselues wholy to their wil and pleasure. Insomuch that they seeme to encline the hearts of their subiects, whither it please them. And it is no maruel if kinges be so honoured of the worlde, seeing that god honoureth them, giuing them his titles, calling them gods, and supe∣riour powers, placing them in his seate, to exercise iustice, & iudge∣ment indifferently and vprightly, and willing that men shoulde submit thēselues to them without any resistāce or rebelliō. So kings
make themselues redoubted as much ae they can, to the end to sub∣mit their subiectes heartes to them, and bowe and order them as it seemeth them good: this while what highnesse soeuer they haue, (wil they nil they) yet they haue a superiour which hath another maner of puisance aboue them, then they haue aboue their subiects & inferiours, for they hate not the power to gouerne their subiects heartes at their pleasure, although they haue authoritie to com∣mande, and the other ought to obey. But God which is their so∣ueraigne Lorde, and ruler, hath not onely power to commande, but also to dispose their heartes at his pleasure, without let or resistance at al. Solomon sheweth it them wel, where hee compareth their heartes to riuers of water saying, The kings hearte is in the hande of the Lorde, &c. Kings ought not therefore for to vaunt of their powers: for although riuers swell sometimes, and flow ouer with such impetuositie as though they woulde cary al away with them: and although also kinges haue hautie and stout hearts, and thinke themselues so migh∣tie, that they weene none may resist them, but that they shal cut and cary away al at their pleasure: neuertheles as by sluces, rampiers, or other inuention one may resist a great riuer, and stop it from doing harme: so it is easie to God to set a stay for kinges, that they hurte not with the pride and hautinesse of their heartes: as Solomon sig∣nifieth clearely, when hee compareth their heartes not to great ri∣uers, but onely to little running brookes which turne their courses easily which way one pleaseth. It is not fit also that they shoulde vaunt themselues of their free wil: for as riuers turne not rhem∣selues this way, or that way, nor cannot doe it, but men turne their courses according as it seemeth them good which haue to do there∣with: So as Solomon saith, God turneth the kings hearte whither he wil: Hee saith not that hee turneth it to this or to that, but whither he will, for as the scriptures shewe vs: hee inclineth one to one thing, and another to another thing: one man nowe to one thing, and by and by too a contrary. Hee turned the king of Egypts hearte in Iosephes time, to doe wel to Iacob and his kindred. Contrariwise hee turned Gen. 45. 16. his successours hart, to misuse the children of Israel after the death of Ioseph. This inclination ought to bee wel knowne of vs, when
God saith to Moses. But I am sure that the king of Egypt wil not let you goe, but by a mightie hande. And yet more manifest Exod. 1. 8. & 3. 19. & 4 21. when God saith, And I will harden his hearte, &c. Hee hath turned Dauids heart to goodnesse, as appeareth, when hee saith, From this day forwarde, the spirite of the Lorde shal prosper in Dauid. And afterwardes hath enclined it to euil: but one might make here two obiections: the one, that kings are not culpable, when they do euil, 1. Sam. 16. 13. 2. Sam. 24. seeing that God enclineth their heartes thereto: the other, that God is the cause, and authour of sinne. An answere to the first obiection, although God doe turne the heartes of kinges to euil, yet are they neuertheles culpable: for god by his iust iudgement, which is incomprehensible to vs, prouoketh them to euil, either to punish their former sinnes by other sinnes, and make them more fautie, Rom. 1. 24. or for to punishe and chastice them whome hee thinketh good, as hee stirred vp Sennacherib, and other kinges against his people of Israel: or to trie and exercise his chosen ones to patience: as hee hath by the minister of Satan stirred vp the Chaldians and Sabians Iam. 1. 13. 14 against Iob: but the wicked hauing no knowledge of the iudge∣ments diuine, no reuerence to the prouidence of God, nor any feare of his worde, are carried away by their owne concupisences. Like∣wise the wicked doe not referre their faultes vnto God, but being reprooued by their owne conscience, confesse their wickednesse, as Pharao knewe wel that he was an offendour, Saule maketh the same confession or very like. Dauid elected of God, hauing numbred Exod. 9. 27. 1. Sam. 24. 18. & 26. 21. 2. Sam. 24. 10. the people, layeth not the faulte on God, but confesseth his owne offence. Wherefore for a briefe answere to the seconde obiecti∣on, wee see that God is not the authour of sinne: for the rest, search the Institutions of Iohn Caluin. So Princes and Magistrates are taught to haue God in honour and reuerence, crauing his conduct and gouernance, and that they feare to bee giuen vp into a repro∣bate sense, as many haue been. Also subiects are admonished to pray for their superiours, otherwise they are in danger lest it wil happen to them according to the threatninges which are in di∣uers 1. Tim. 2. 1. Esa. 3. 1. Ose. 13. 11. places. For the rest, if kinges which are mightie, as they think, and which make themselues redoubted, haue neede to bee go∣uerned by GOD, who turneth their heartes at his pleasure, it is
not meete that we promise ourselues any thing against the will of God. 2 Euery mans way seemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart. Man is so much giuen to flatter, praise, and esteeme of himselfe: that hee neither can nor wil finde any thing in himselfe worthie of Pro. 3. 5. 6. 7. & 12. 15. & 14. 12. & 16 2. 25. reprehension, but perswadeth with himselfe, that al that he willeth, thinketh, enterpriseth, saith, or doth, is good & iust: wherein he is deceiued, as Solomō pronounceth it. And because so foolish an opi∣nion, cannot easily bee rooted out of the thoughtes of man, there∣fore Solomon rebuketh it nowe againe, when he saith, Euery mans way, &c. 3 To doe iustice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then sacrifice. From the beginning of the worlde, men haue thought to doe God great seruice, when they haue offered vp sacrifie, of beastes which they killed, of the which, or of other goods of the earth, they made great oblation and after the flood, they haue not forgotten this custome. And as men haue esteemed it, so the Lorde hath al∣wayes Gen. 4. 3. 4. Gen. 8. 20. & 12. 7. 8. & 13. 18. helde acceptable the sacrifices of the faithful, who offered them in firme faith, and true repentance, regarding the true Messias which ought to bee sacrificed onely and perfect for the remission of their sinnes, whereat they were sore agreeued and displeased. And then when hee gaue the tenne commandementes, hee ordeined sacrifices, which is a good argument that they were acceptable too him, as is seene in Leuiticus: I haue spoken specially of the faithful, which are neither hypocrites, nor ambitious, nor theeues, nor mur∣derers. For although the faithlesse full of al iniquitie, violence, & extortion, did offer oblations, and sacrifice, which had great appa∣rance of holynesse and religion: and that they shewed by Ce∣remonies that they had a meruellous great zeale to the seruice of GOD, neuerthelesse their sacrifices pleased not the Lorde,
but rather prouoked him to wrath and anger, and he despised them as thinges abhominable: but hee willeth that the wicked shoulde turne from his euil wayes refraining to doe iniurie and violence and giuing himself to al right and equitie, in restoring to euery man that which belongeth vnto him, helping the oppressed and afflicted, Psa. 40. 7. & 50. 7. and deliuering them from the handes of those which doe them wrong: which thing apperteineth principallly to kinges and superi∣ours of the earth: but it is meete also that euery one apply himselfe therein, as much as is possible. And so his workes shalbe agreeable to the Lorde, more then al the oblations of beastes, or fruites of the earth, Solomon pronounceth it thus in briefe, saying, To doe iustice and iudgement, &c. Hee sheweth vs in one worde that which wee haue principally to doe, to the ende wee stu∣die not on thinges, which haue a faire apparance outwardly, and bring no profite, aide nor succour to the poore afflicted. Also he re∣proueth in briefe the kinges and gouernours of the earth, which are hypocrites, as were the Scribes and Pharisees, which are oppres∣sours. Hee reprehendeth likewise all hypocrites, which loue to bee seene, and praised, and in the meane while haue no care of their Mat. 22. 23. 25. Esa. 1. 10. 23 neighbours, as are in the Papacie, the eaters of the crucifixe, as also are they which come to sermons of the worde, and communicate the Sacraments, and yet sticke not to bee replenished with fraudes deceites, in humanitie, and crueltie. Wherefore let vs not thinke that Solomon reproueth sacrifices, vnder the which he comprehen∣deth al the works commauded in the first table: but onely the abuse committed therein, neither is he contente that one doe iustice and iudgement, for one ought principally to mainteine the honour and glory of God, and to obserue true religion, which is commanded vs in the first table. But by the workes of the seconde Table, the ob∣seruation of al the lawe is set downe: for if wee abstaine to doe in∣iury to our neighbours, if in asmuch as in vs lyeth, we doe succour them which are oppressed, and deliuer them, if finally wee imploy ourselues to doe the workes of charitie, we giue signification of the feare of God, by the which the fruites of iustice, iudgement & cha∣ritie are brought forth. And therfore although one cānot loue god, vnles hee loue his neighbour: notwithstanding, this is not to say, that the loue of God proceedeth of the loue of his neighbour. But
if wee loue God truely, it is necessarie that we loue our neighbour. As also wee haue the commaundement of him, That hee that lo∣ueth God, loueth also his neighbour. It is true, that if we loue our neighbour, we giue a signe that wee loue God: for the loue that we 1. Ioh. 4. 20. 21. Rom. 13. 10. beare towardes our neighbour, is the fruite which bringeth foorth the loue which wee haue to God warde. And so when Saint Paule saieth, That hee which loueth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the lawe, hee exempteth vs not from the workes of the first Table: for his intent was to speake in this point of the duetie which the lawe commandeth vs to doe to our neigh∣bours, whereto wee woulde not applye ourselues, if wee did not loue them: but louing them truely, we doe to them al duetie. And meane while it is true, that the lawe is accomplished by charitie to∣wardes our neighbours, the which proceedeth not, but of the loue that wee haue to God, and therof yeeldeth testimonie, as the effect doeth of the cause. 4 An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is sinne. When the wicked allowe of themselues in their owne hearts, and that they think they are somewhat more excellent then others, they cannot guide themselues, but they must giue some outwarde signe of this pride and arrogancie, and persuade themselues, that in so doing, they doe wel, and by this meanes, keepe their credit, and come to the ende of their attemptes gallantly: but in suche sorte of dealing, they abstaine not to do iniurie and violence to their neigh∣bours, against whome they lift vp themselues fiercely, and take ioy and delight therein. And so there is great wickednesse in their pro∣ceedings, estate, and ioye. Solomon sheweth it by this worde sinne, when he saith, An high looke, and a proude heart, &c. Wherein we haue to note first of al, That an high looke, (as al other brauities and pompes of the bodie) is a signe and token of the pride which is in the heart. And therefore one calleth it pride, and it is sinne, as it is iudged naturally to bee without the scriptures: for men wil say, Beholde a great pride, to wit, when one seeth any to bee very glori∣ous,
and beare his head on high, or vse any other gesture contra∣rie to humilitie and lowlinesse. And they wil say, hee hath a stoute and loftie heart: Therefore, with nature the Scripture imputeth this to pride, and blameth, and condemneth it, and threateneth to destroy it, as hath beene seene to happen to some, who haue bene destroyed for their pride which they shewed by outwarde gesture. And because wee wil not be so beaten downe by the wrath of the Lorde, it be hooueth vs to humble ourselues, as wel in our hearts, as in our gesture and dooinges: so that wee may protest, Lorde I Esa. 2. 11. & 3. 15. & 5. 14 Dan. 4. 26. & 5. 22. Psa. 131. 1. am not high minded, I haue no proude lookes, &c. Thus doo∣ing, humilitie shalbe deemed a vertue in vs, and we shalbe exalted of our God. Note secondly, that the pride which is betokened by high lookes, and a proude heart, is called the Lanterne of the wicked: because they guide themselues by the same, and therein place their ioy and pleasure: for they think they should not doe their businesse halfe wel, if they shoulde not seeke by pride to extoll themselues aboue others. Note we thirdly, that of the proude heart proceedeth the high looke, with al the other fruites of pride, which are in great number, which we ought to take to be comprehended heere vnder one kinde. Let vs note finally, that seeing the lampe of the wicked, is imputed as sinne to them, they make of vice, vertue, & so contrarie. Esa. 3. 20. 5 The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteousnes: but he that is hastie, commeth verily to pouertie. We are al slouthful by nature, as we ourselues wel perceiue, yet neuerthelesse, we thinke that we are woorthie to haue muche sub∣stance: but we iudge in the meane while, that there is none but the diligent that ought to haue plentie of goods: wherein wee shoulde iudge aright, if we vnderstood who they were that are diligent, for Pro. 10. 3. 4. 5. & 11. 25. & 12. 11. & 13. 4. 23. 25. & 14. 4. 23. & 20. 13. we wil consent to that which Solomon hath spoken heretofore, and to that which he saith presently: That the thoughts of the diligent are onely vpon plenteousnes, &c. He speaketh but of thoughts, but he sheweth therwithal, that they are not vaine and light thoughts, which are without effect, for he saieth, Of the diligent, that is to say, of him which thinketh not to couet onely, as the slouthfull
doe, but thinketh, in imploying himselfe carefully to his busines, to the ende it may be dispatched duely, and may profite and yeeld him suche abundaunce, that hee may be farre from pouertie, and neede, which if wee wil be free from, wee ought not to proceede in our affaires, rashly, and without consideration (for there is on∣ly plenteousnesse, where the diligent thinketh wel without rashe∣nesse) as the hastie doe, which boyle with inordinate desire, and neuer obtaine their wishes soone enough, as they thinke, nor such plenteousnes as they woulde haue: and because they proceede in their enterprises without good consideration: in steede of hauing plentie with the diligent, they run into pouerty. As Solomō addeth, But he that is hastie, commeth verily to pouertie. Hee is not content to affirme simply this same, but because he speaketh against the sense of many (for we neuer are soone enough come to our de∣sires) he striueth to confirme his saying, by this word verily, or one∣ly. He hath alreadie saide the same. Then although there were none other fault but that he which is hastie, proceedeth rashly, and with∣out aduise, hee deserueth wel to be poore and needie, but there are Pro. 20. 21. other foule faults. One is, that he mistrusteth of the bountie & pro∣uidence of God. Cōtrariwise, he which beleeueth, is not hastie. The other is, that willing to enrich himselfe, he falleth into temptation, and many foolish desires, which plundge men in perdition, &c. Wee Esa. 28. 16. 1. Tim. 6. 9. 10. see likewise by this Scripture, that it is not lawful to couet plente∣ousnes, although of it selfe it be good, and that a man which thin∣keth diligently vpon his businesse, may lawfully possesse it, not set∣ting his heart thereupon. A man therefore being readie to thinke vpon his businesse, and diligent to doe it, may possesse the plentie which proceedeth therof, with a sure & sound cōscience, and in the Psal. 62. 11. Luk. 12. 15 Mat. 6. 19. 1. Tim. 6. 7. & 17. Hebr. 3. 5. 6. meane while, shal take heede of couetousnes. And to do this wel, he shal folow that which is saide in diuers places. 6 To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie tos∣sed too and fro of them that seeke death. Wee doe al naturally feare pouertie, and flye from it as much as is possible for vs, for we see that the poore endure many miseries, and are despised, and forsaken of the world, yea, hated of their owne borne brethren. As Solomon hath saide, if one arise against Pro. 19. 7.
them, it seemeth that they ought to be incontinently quailed: for they haue neither power nor succour, but languish in this world: insomuche that it seemeth, they are continually in death. Contrari∣wise, naturally we loue riches, seeking for thē, & hoarding it vp as much as is possible: for we persuade ourselues that when we haue heaped store of worldly goods, in golde and siluer, in houses and o∣ther heritages, wee shal not bee subiect to themiseries of this pre∣sent life, we shal get many friendes, which wil fauour vs, honour vs, and present vs with al pleasure and seruice. And as it seemeth, wee shalbe in suche prosperitie, that wee shal not thinke to dye, al∣though we knowe and confesse, that wee must needes dye. But to attaine to their riches, men imagine fraudes, cousonages, vsuries, theftes, and wicked dealinges, and to practise it, and atchiue it, they lye, sweare, and forsweare, they curse and banne, they renounce God, and giue themselues to the Deuil. The most parte of Mer∣chantes and Artificers knowe this same. And if one rebuke them for suche wickednesse, straight way they answere, That they should bee otherwise fooles and shoulde sel nothing. And in case fathers deale thus wickedly, they wil that their children resemble them, or be rather woorse: for at twelue or thirteene yeeres of age, they set them to keepe shoppes, and teache them their craftes, or rather de∣ceites, by the which they obtaine vniustly the substance of the buy∣ers. And in this maner, they thinke to establish their state wel, and to be perpetuated either in themselues, or in their children & succes∣sours, they thinke stil to launche forwardes, and make themselues strong enough to shun death: but in steed of exalting themselues, they perish miserably, and go to Death. Solomon speaketh it plain∣ly, when he saieth, To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie tossed too and fro of them that seeke death. Wherein wee see, that that which the wicked feare, happeneth vnto them. Moreouer, we are admonished, not to bee careful to heape vp muche goods in this worlde, seeing it is but vanitie and perdition. 7 The Rapines of the wicked shal destroye them: for they haue refused to doe iustice.
Because it is seene that the wicked which take and rauishe al they can get either by deceite and guile, or by violence and oppres∣sion, or by receite of giftes and brybes, or other meanes vnlawful, doe prosper in the viewe of the world, and haue credite and autho∣ritie and that it seemeth that they be of long endurance and liue at their ease, for this cause many snatch vp goods where they can find them, and for the most parte vniustly. Of whome the principal and captaines are the iudges and gouernours of the earth, which deale by respect of persons, and loue and take brybes and giftes, too doe wrong to him that hath good right. And although the Scriptures often complaine of such pillers, and raueners, and threatneth them destruction, as hath beene alleadged heretofore, and also their con∣sciences reprooue and reprehend them, and they themselues con∣demne them which are petie theeues in respect of them, and that they ought to vnderstande that as they condemne the petie theeues to death, so they themselues are woorthie of ruine and destruction. Neuerthelesse they thinke that to take on all handes and on al sides, is the best way for to make themselues great and mightie, and haue a lasting house, and as it were perpetuall. But because they cannot vse such trade, but by renouncing all equitie and right, and doing wrong and iniurie outrage and violence to their neighbours dispoi∣ling them of their substance, for this cause their iniurie shal returne vnto themselues. As Solomon pronounceth it saying, The ra∣pines of the wicked shall destroy them. Wherein he speaketh prin∣cipally of kinges iudges, and gouernours of the earth, which are the greatest theeues and raueners, as is aforesaide. The reason which he addeth, sheweth wel that it is of such men that hee speaketh, when he sayth, For they haue refused to doe iustice. True it is that we ought al to doe our endeuour in helping eche one his neighbour, and de∣fending him, inasmuche as wee can, from the yldealing of the wic∣ked. But because the Superiours of the earth are placed in the seate of God, and that their office (as they can wel tel) is to doe iustice: It is lawful to vnderstande, that this present sentence pronounceth principally, that they shal perishe wickedly: for they make no ac∣count to doe right, in ayding the feeble, and defending them, but rather eate and deuoure them: as it is laide to their charge, & they Psal. 82. 2. 6. 7.
are manaced destruction. Ia. 33. 1. & 8 There is a man, whose waye is frowarde, and strange: but the worke of the pure man is right. There is none but he thinketh or striueth to persuade himself, that he is an honest man, and that hee walketh so vprightly, that in him is nothing worthie of reprehension: so proude and haughtie is the nature of man, striuing to forget his owne iniquities, which are continually before his eyes. Insomuch, that if he commit any thing or imagine against his neighbour, that which he would not should be done vnto himselfe, it can not be but his conscience wil reproue him. Notwithstanding, hee resisteth it as euerie one may feele in him¦selfe naturally, and as Solomon hath sometimes spoken, when hee saieth heere aboue, verse, 2. That euerie mans way seemeth right in his owne eyes. And nowe hee sheweth openly, that this opinion of vprightnesse is false, when he sayeth, There is a man whose way is frowarde and strange. Wherein we haue to note, that although it be saide, The Lord hath looked from heauen vpon the children of Psal. 14. 2 Esai. 64. 6. Iere. 17. 9. men, to see if there were any which vnderstoode and sought after God, but they are al gone astraie, &c. And wee are al as it were filth, &c. The heart is deceitful and frowarde, more then al other thinges, &c. Neuerthelesse, Solomon condemneth not vsal, be∣cause that God accepteth the woorkes of him that is regenerated, which Solomon calleth pure, saying, But the worke of the pure man is right. For although beeing left off in the corruption of our nature, wee walke in frowarde and strange wayes, doing wrongful, and abhominable woorkes, which leade vs to perdition, and that we cannot be so iust, but wee must needes sinne: neuerthelesse, when our Lorde Iesus Christ by his ho∣ly spirite mortifieth our wicked concupiscenses, and disordinate af∣fections, hee purgeth vs so, that our affections are holy, good, and iust, and cannot be otherwise, insomuche, as the holie Ghost con∣ducteth them, and guideth them. The it foloweth, that wee take pleasure to walke vprightly, and wee cannot be turned therefro, to abandon intirely the right way, and withdrawe ourselues wholly
from righteousnes for we haue the seed of God which is perpetual, that is to say, which maketh them to perseuer in holines and iustice which are engendered of God by his seede. For whosoeuer is born of God, doeth not sinne, for his seede remaineth in him, &c. This 1. Ioh. 3. 9. is not to say, but this seede is sometimes choked of them, that are regenerate, as it hath beene in Dauid, but it is neuer wholly extin∣guished. 9 It is better to dwell in a corner on the house toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide house. God at the beginning created man and woman, and ioyned them together in marriage, to the ende they shoulde liue together in peace and vnitie, whereby they might haue ioye and consolation and be an aide and comfort one to the other, as members of one bodie. And principally it is sayde that the woman is an helpe too man. But men and women despise the end and purpose of GOD, Gen. 2. 18. and not weighing the duetie which they owe one to another, seeke for earthly goodes and substance, and couet earnestly, the highnes and magnificencie, the glory and honour of the world. When they are about to marry, they enquire not principally of the life and ma∣ners of the man or woman, that is to be had, but aboue all thinges they haue regard to the goodes and riches, to the might, credite au∣thoritie, and noblenes of the parentage, that thereby they may be∣come greate and haue support and credite, and a greate number of people, which shall woonder at their riches, reuerence them and court them: Or at leastwise that they may haue wherewith too walke by their neighbours, liue at their ease, and vse great traffique or haue inheritāce of great reuenue. Now because in this sort they forsake God, and regard more the world, it comes to passe that for the confusion of such persons, and to punish their vanitie and pride their greedines and auarice, God ouerturneth the lawes of mariage: So that a man that wil marrie, insteede of finding an honest wife, which should support and aide him, giue him peace, ioy and conso∣lation, God giueth him a proude and fierce wife which serueth to no other purpose, but to torment & vex him, braule & make war with him, and put him to great trouble and sorrow: when a man hath
mette with suche a matche, hee saieth in his heart, that which So∣lomon auoucheth, saying, It is better to dwel in a corner on the house toppe, &c. Also the wife that wil marie, in steed of finding an honest man which wil loue her, and be acceptable & pleasant to her, meeteth with a proud and cruel man, a churle, and one with whō she can haue no quiet∣nes. Then saith shee also in her heart, That it is better to dwel in a corner on the house top, then with a brawling husbande in a wide house. Beholde heere howe wee shoulde applye this sentence, al∣though Solomon make mention but of the woman, and not with∣out cause: for seeing that the woman is chosen by the man, & was created to assist and obeye him, and be subiect to him, as the Church is to Iesus Christe: It is good reason, that shee be rebuked by name, when in steede of keeping the housholde in silence and peace, shee Ephe. 5. lifteth vp herselfe against her husbande, and resisteth him: also be∣cause by proofe women are more prompt & readie to striue against their husbands, and that this vice is most common amongst them, Solomon speaketh the rather of the brawling woman, and blameth her: who in as muche as shee is inferiour to her husbande, shee ought to suffer patiently the seueritie of him, rather then to moue debates, and striue against him. Note wee also, that when the toppe of the house, whereupon one endureth great heate and alteration in the sommer, and great colde in the winter, is preferred before the company of a brawling woman, howe riche or noble soeuer shee bee: women are warned to walke warily in al humilitie and obedi∣ence, and be gentle, pleasant, and louing, as they are taught to bee in many places of the scripture, which haue bene sometimes heere∣tofore alledged. 10 The soule of the vngodly wisheth euil, and his neighbour shal finde no fauour in his sight. There is none but hee woulde be esteemed an honest man, but in the meane while, al (as it were) haue their harts enraged, & their affectiōs poisoned, their desires replenished with rācor & hate, with strife & wil to reuenge, their determinations and enterprises ful of inhumanitie and crueltie, of outrage, violence, and oppression,
of murther and homicide. Solomon knewe mans inwarde wicked∣nesse to be such, that they had neither feare nor knowledge of God, Iere. 17. 9. but despised al correction, and scorned thereat. And therefore hee complaineth saying, The soule of the vngodly wisheth euil. This is not that he coulde sounde the harts, and pearce the inwarde cogita∣tions: for that appertaineth to God onely: But hee had this know∣ledge of the desires and affections: as also wee may haue by the fruites which proceed therof. Hee seeth howe the wicked haue no pleasure to doe workes of mercy, nor vse charitie towardes them which haue need & necessitie therof, but rather to doe them al the wrong that they can, not sparing them any more then a hungry Ly∣on, when hee hath caught his pray. Solomon expresseth such euil fruites, and complaineth thereof saying, And his neighbour shal finde no fauour in his sight, or shall obtaine no mercy, or shal not be spared. The Hebrewe tongue im∣porteth al these three senses in one worde: and yet there is no con∣trarietie, although there bee diuersitie. Also the innocent are di∣uersly despised, and ill handled of the vngodly, who wil not once lende them a good looke, nor vse any courtesie towards them, but rather vse them as cruellie as they can inuent. Knowe we moreouer, that Solomon taxeth heere the hypocrites principally, which coun∣terfeit Saintes and Lambes, either by ceremonies or by words or by other deeds, and gesture, by the which they seeke to intrapp them which are not wel aduised, and to oppresse them, to make their pro∣fit by the losse and damage of others. 11 When the scorneful is punished, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wise is instructed, hee wil receiue vnderstanding. Because this present sentence hath beene alreadie handled, wee Prou. 19. 25. wil note only, that the repetition heere made, is very necessary, to the end we may learne to regarde neerely the punishmentes which happen to the wicked, either by the iudges mouth, or by warres, or by other meanes, which they thought not vpon. And that these punishements serue to schoole vs, to the ende wee may feare to de∣spise, with obstinacie and stubbornesse, the instructions, admoniti∣ons,
and reprehensions which are made to vs, and the good coun∣sels and aduisements which are giuen vs by the woorde, knowing that wee cannot haue too many examples, to aduise vs, and bring vs in feare. For wee are so foolishe of our owne nature, that easilie wee are persuaded, and drawne, to followe the wickednesse of moc∣kers and despisers of al holinesse and religion. On the other side wee cannot be so wise, but wee shal haue greate neede to increase in knowledge and vnderstanding. And we ought to take heede, not to thinke nor say that wee haue ynough, and that no man hath to doe to instruct vs. 12 The iust man instructeth the house of the wicked: But for wickednesse, God ouerthroweth the vn∣godly. Although the vngodly persecute the iust, as though they had de∣serued it, and despise to take example by their godly conuersation, and although they reiect al good doctrine as vnprofitable or hurt∣ful: Notwithstanding the iust which is iust indeede, looseth not his courage, he ceaseth not to shewe himself a mirour of holy life, nor to teache the wicked, counselling them and correcting them, accu∣sing them and threatening them with the wrath and vengeance of God, and condemning them as worthy of the horrible iudgements of God. Solomon signifieth this when hee saith, The iust man in∣structeth the house of the wicked. Hee speaketh not so without good proofe, for hee was in the time of the Prophetes who were of an vnstained life and sound doctrine, and ceased not to teach, ad∣monish, correct, and threaten the wicked according as God com∣manded them. And afore that time there were many iust men which had done the like: As Noe which was a iust man, & was Herauld of iustice, and condemned the worlde. One may heere set downe A∣braham, Lot, Moses, Iosue, & others which were before Solomons Gen. 6. 9. 2. Pet. 2. 5. Heb. 11. 7. time. After whome also there were many other iust men, and a∣mongst the rest, the Apostles of our Lord & Sauiour & theyr suc∣cessors, which haue liued holily, and purely administred the worde. And because in the Hebrew tougue, one worde hath diuers signifi∣cations, some for instruct, say consider wisely. And it is wel said: for
it is very conuenient to regarde that which the wicked doe, and to take heede thereof, that we consent not to their woorkes, but rather reprooue them thereof. And also of that which happeneth or shal happen vnto them, to the ende we enuie not their prosperitie, which is of no endurance, and after the same, they are in perpetuall miserie. Other say, to make prosper, as Abraham made the king of Sodome to prosper, and Iacob Laban, God caused Ioseph to make his maister to prosper. But although one instruct the wicked, al∣though Gen. 14. 16. & 30. 29. & 39. 2. one consider the state of his house, to seeke to refourme it, although one make his goods to fructifie & prosper: Neuerthelesse because he despiseth the word, and is puffed vp with pride, and ad∣dicted to all wickednes, for this cause nothing profiteth him, but all the goods that hee getteth, be they spiritual or temporall, turne to his destruction: which if it be not in this worlde, God ceaseth not to reuenge it at last, as Solomon expresseth saying, But for wickednes God ouerthroweth the vngodly. Heere Solomon sayth nothing, but the wicked haue prooued it at al times, and doe prooue it yet. Also the Lawe and the Prophets are ful of such threatninges. But although the wicked are woorthie of no good, and that they are threatned destruction: Neuerthelesse it is not lawfull for vs to wishe them euil, much lesse to woorke them the same: but rather to desire their welfare, and chiefly the health of their soules, we ought to instruct them and shewe them the way of health, and not to bee affraide of loosing our paines: for when wee beare the worde of truth vprightly, we are a good smel to the Lord. Thus dooing, God wil not ouerthrowe vs with the wicked to de∣stroy 2. Cor. 2. 14. vs, but if we bee comprehended with the wicked in tempo∣ral destruction, God wil gather vs againe to himselfe, and deliuer our soules from perdition, but he wil destroy for euer the soules of the wicked without any remission. 13 Hee that stoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, shall crye himselfe also, and not bee heard. God hath shewed himselfe very merciful towardes vs, when
before wee euer called vpon him, hee prouided for our necessitie, creating al things for our vse, and giuing vs plentie thereof. Neuer∣thelesse to the ende we shoulde not be vngrateful, but acknowledge whence this comes, he permitteth vs to haue pouertie, and wil that we vnderstand, that without his grace, liberalitie, and blessing, our goods profit vs nothing: to the ende that wee may bee careful to craue that he wil giue vs our daily bread: as Iesus Christ teacheth vs to aske: and as our good God and father is merciful vnto vs, and giueth vs liberally that which wee request: So hee wil that wee re∣sist, according to our power the pouertie of our neighbours, di∣stributing to them any goods, as wee woulde they shoulde doe vn∣to vs, if wee were in their cace. And heerein hee requesteth no∣thing but that which is reasonable: as wee ought naturally to vn∣derstande without scripture. Notwithstanding to waken our na∣ture, which is negligent to doe good to the needie, and to shewe vs that hee hath great care ouer the poore, hee recommendeth them to vs by diuers commandementes, in the Lawe and Prophetes, and in the wrytings of the Apostles and Euangelistes: adding promi∣ses, and also threatenings to the commandementes, to giue hope to the liberal and pityful, and to afray the cruel and vnmerciful, and make them the more inexcusable. As hath beene alledged heereto∣fore. But because that God executeth not presently his threatnings Pro. 14. 31. & 19. 17. or forgetteth them easilie: and therefore it is needful that one re∣peate them, as Solomon wel knewe: For this cause to the former promises and threatnings, he addeth another saying, Hee that stoppeth his eare, &c. This present threatning is executed often in this life. For one seeth that by warres, lawing, fa∣mine and euil gouernement many riche men are impouerished and when they craue any thing, then they obtaine not that which they desire, and whereof they haue need. The scripture also giueth vs ex∣amples thereof. As of Esau who soulde his byrthright. One seeth Gen. 25. 29. & 27. 34. Heb. 12. 17. Luke. 16. 19. Mat. 25. 14. Iam. 2. 13. that Esau was giuen to his pleasures, which is a signe that hee made no accompt of the poore. As also the yonger of the twoo sonnes spending his portion prodigally, sheweth well that hee had no care nor regarde of the poore. It is execu∣ted also very horribly after this lyfe in hell, in damnation and
death eternal, as is seene in the scriptures. Also as wee ought to bee liberal of our earthly goods towardes the indigent to susteine this bodily life: so wee ought to haue pitie on the soules of them, which haue neede to haue their fautes pardoned: Otherwise God will not Mat. 12. 14. 15. & 18. 23. pardon vs ours. 14 A priuie rewarde pacifieth displeasure: And a gift in the bosome stilleth furiousnesse. When men beganne to multiply on the earth, it was corrupted Gen. 6. before God, and replenished with extortion and wrong. Wherein wee haue argument that the feeble and weake were oppcessed, that the poore and needy were despised and forgotten. For this cause God was much an angred, and destroied the worlde by the flood. Also the Lorde saide, The cry of Sodome and Gomorrha is mul∣tiplyed, Gen. 18. 20. and their sinnes are very grieuous, &c. Ezechiel expoun∣deth Eze. 16. 49. what this cry and sinne was. For this cause Gods wrath was kindled against them, and hee destroied them. Heerein wee ought to bee aduertised, that if wee resemble them, wee shal also perishe by the iust vengeance of God. Nowe to shunne this yre and furie, So∣lomon sheweth vs what wee haue to doe when hee saieth, A pri∣uie gift, &c. Wherein wee haue to note, that to imprint surelie in our hartes that which hee teacheth, hee saith one thing twise. Also the doctrine which hee giueth vs heere, is so excellent and necessary, that it deserueth wel to be repeated, and also declared and expoun∣ded. Of it Iesus Christ himselfe is a good expositour. If wee take this present sentence in this sense, wee haue together with the do∣ctrine Mat. 6. 1. therein, promise of euerlasting life: for seeing that God re∣freineth his anger, and rage, when wee giue to the poore for his sake, it foloweth wel that wee shal not perish, but that by his grace and goodnesse we shal liue eternally. But if we vnderstande this sen∣tence, of brybes and giftes, that the iudges, and gouernours of the earth take to peruert the lawe and equitie, it be hooueth vs to say, that Solomon accuseth the Magistrates and rulers of rapine, which Rom. 13. ought in their anger to roote out the wicked. But to spare and fa∣uour them, they let themselues bee corrupted by giftes and brybes, for the which they doe wrong to the innocent: and fauour the wic∣ked
as hath beene alreadie spoken of diuers times. In this sense, wee haue a menace of eternal death against wicked iudges that spoile and rob. For theeues and couetous persons haue no parte in the kingdome of God. They are also accused that they, and those which giue them giftes and bribes, proceede against their conscien∣ces 1. Cor. 6. knowing wel that they doe wickedly, when they dare not pub∣likely before the worlde, the one giue, nor the other take: which thing Solomon signifieth wel, speaking of priuie giftes and of bo∣some. 15 The iust man hath ioy to do iustice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie. Wee al desire to reioyce and be merie, and to bee exempt from al feare and horrour. But there are very fewe which knowe howe they ought to reioice, nor in what. For after the common trade of the worlde, the manner of reioicing is, to take pleasure in laughing at vanitie and follie, at filthinesse and villanie, at dissolution and naughtinesse, and this is when one reioiceth at the desires of the flesh. As when one hath abundance of riches, credite, and power, or when one commeth to the end of his enterprises, and findeth no resistance, but rather eche one fauoureth him, and seeketh to please him in al things. I say namely, that this is the common trade of the worlde, whereof the iust man is not. And therefore hee reioiceth not in this manner, nor at such thinges. But hee reioiceth in doing wel, and helping those which haue neede of his aide, defending, and deliuering them which are oppressed. Such a care according to the worlde, is but trouble, griefe and sadnesse: for dooing thus, one hath neuer good day, as worldlings say and thinke. But making no account of their opinion, let vs sticke to that which the holy Ghost saith thereof by Solomon, saying, The iust man hath ioy to doe iustice, &c. Now seeing it apper∣taineth principally to Kings, Princes, and gouernours to doe iustice, they are heere taught that their ioy ought not to bee in delights & pompes, in pleasures and playes, as their common vse is, when they haue no feare of God: but to render right to euery one carefully, in
defending the innocent, feeble and weake: and deliuering thē from the violence and oppression of the wicked, and punishing the op∣pressours and offenders. Otherwise they are not iust, but wrongful and wicked: which thing is not seemely for them which are placed in the seat of God, which loueth iustice and righteousnesse, and ta∣keth pleasure therein. Also that which causeth ioy to them, that doe iustice, is that they are certaine that God accepteth their doings, & esteemeth of them, and they themselues do nothing whereof their consciences reprooue them. The vngodly, and wicked haue no such certaintie: true it is that they striue to assure and harden themselues in their misdeeds, and deliuer themselues from al scruple, and cast a∣way care to reioice in riots and insolencies, excesse, and dissoluti∣ons. But the word is true without exception, which saith, that there is no peace for the wicked: which accordeth wel with that which Isa. 48. 22. Solomon saith here, But horror is to thē that worke iniquitie. And it is in folowing the curses, which are threatened to the transgres∣sors of the lawe. Although then that the iust in this worlde, which Deut. 28. 28 65. 66. giue themselues to doe their duetie, seeme sad and sorowful, neuer∣thelesse for the quietnesse, and ease of their consciences, and for the assurance that they haue, that their workes please God, they reioice and take pleasure to employ themselues to doe good. Also although the wicked seeke to leade a pleasant life in toying and fooling, and though they seeme merie, yet neuerthelesse they haue no true ioy, for through their misdeeds their consciences accuse them, and tor∣ment them, mawgre their harts, with the feare of the iudgementes of God. And so although they striue to shewe out wardly a smyling countenance, and take their pleasure in making good cheere, eating and drinking, singing, leaping, and daunsing, yet they cease not to haue within them the worme that gnaweth, grieueth them, and maketh them sad: and thus they haue no true ioy. If therefore at our neede wee wil haue ioy that is durable, let vs beware to doe any thing, whereof our consciences may reprooue and ac∣cuse vs, which thing wee shal wel doe if the onely woorde of GOD bee the rule of al our actions: for wee can haue no peace in our consciences but by the same. And there is nothing which can assure vs that wee doe wel, but this holy woorde.
Wherefore it behoueth the wicked, which make no account to doe good to their neighbours, but rather afflict them, and haue no right knowledge of God, to tremble, and haue no assurance. Then if they so tremble, they cannot bee in lasting ioye, but must needes haue Ps. 14. 4. 5. continual horrour and feare, griefe and sorrowe: where contrari∣wise the iust are inuited to ioy. Ps. 32. 10. 11 16 The man that wandereth out of the way of wisedome, shall remayne in the congregation of the dead. Because the worde of God is simple, and teacheth vs not hye & excellent things in the opinion of the world: for this cause it is de∣spised, and men make no account to folowe the way which it tea∣cheth: thinking it a great dishonor to be conformable to the same: and that they shoulde bee scarce worthy to liue. Likewise men per∣secuted at al times, and presently doe, those, that folowe it as wic∣ked, and esteeme them vnworthy of life. But those which despising the worde, seeke out things which are in price with the worlde, and folow thē, are reputed honest men, & are placed alwaies in the most honorable place amongst worldlings. Which is the cause that they thinke themselues to be in good estate, and of such force that they shal neuer perish. Wherein they disceiue themselues, for seeing the worde of God is our wisedome and vnderstanding, and that hee which doeth the things appointed by the same shal liue: and as wee Deut. 4. 6. Leuit. 18. 5. Pro. 16. Mat. 22. 32. see, there is long life in her right hande: it foloweth, that without this wisedome there is nothing but death. And therefore Solomon saith: The man that wandreth out of the way, &c. Hee speaketh not of them which are dead bodily: for if they haue bene faithful, they are not dead, but liue. Solomon therefore condemneth al worldly wise men to death eternal: for there is none that shoulde bee estee∣med dead, but those that are in the same. In the death of the faith∣ful, Iohn. 5. 24. & 11. 25. 26 there is nothing but a passage to life: seeing that our Sauiour so saith. Wee are therefore heere admonished to folowe rightly the only worde, if we wil liue, and are threatened death eternal, if wee wander out of the way of the same.
17 The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who so delighteth in wyne and delicates, shall not be riche. It is not ill done to liue pleasantly: bee it in taking bodily repast, or doing any other thing (as it hath bin partly spoken of elsewhere) God hath not put vs in this world to giue vs onlie necessarie things for ourselues, but also delectable, and pleasant, to recreate vs with sobrietie and temperance, without any disordinate desire. It is not without a very needful cause that I say with sobrietie: for it is not meete that the children of God bee like vnto worldlings, which neither thinke their meate sweete, nor drinke good, if they laugh not with open mouth as they say, and bee in companie with those which doe play the vnthrifts. Whiles they are busie about such de∣lights, or rather about such wantonnesse they thinke not that they offende a whit: and therefore they spare nothing, but spende super∣fluously and with great excesse. But although it be late, yet they shal receiue their hyre which they deserue: that is to say, pouertie and want. As Solomon threateneth them saying, The man that loueth, &c. This is not to say that it is ill done to reioice in taking ones repast naturallie, nor that it is amisse to vse sweete wine and meates, which Solomon comprehendeth vnder the name of delicates: if so bee it we vse them, as S. Paul teacheth. For in this also consisteth the ioy of the Christians: and not in ryot 1. Timo. 4. 3. and greate desire to fulfil the appetite of the belly, and pleasant taste of the mouth. As is the tricke of the prodigal and gluttons, to seeke to satisfie their sensualitie. Also Solomon saieth not, The man that delighteth, &c. shal haue pouertie: and hee that drinketh wine, and eateth good meates shal not bee riche. But he saieth, He that loueth, By the which worde hee sheweth that hee speaketh of him, which is wholy giuen to banketting, drunkennesse, and glut∣tonie, and hath no delight in sobernesse, and temperance. Solomon threateneth such a one of pouertie, as our Sauiour doth also, which pouertie beginneth after in this life, as is prooued by them which Luk. 6. 52. hauing spent their goods prodigally, are constrained to begge their bread: some frō dore to dore, othersome in borrowing money neuer
to restore it againe: the rest in seeking their liuing by playing the Parasites and flatterers, which is a miserable estate, but it shalbee without comparison far more miserable after this life. As one may see in the riche man which is in hel. Let vs folowe therefore sobrie∣tie, and temperance, not desiring to enriche ourselues. For al∣though Luk. 16. 23. that riches are good, and that it is laweful to bee riche, yet neuerthelesse one should not set his affection thereon: As hath beene shewed heeretofore by the scriptures. Also beeing in pouer∣tie, we shoulde not detest it, to rage and murmure against God, nor to giue ourselues licence to take goods, where wee finde them, but by lawful meanes and waies, wee shoulde seeke to shunne the same, applying ourselues ech one to his businesse wheretoo he is called. 18 The vngodly shalbe a ransome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iust. It might seeme at the first shew, that Solomō speaketh against ex∣perience, and against the scriptures. First of al (as it is prooued in the worlde) one beateth the dog before the Lyon: And so the wicked and vngodly pay not ransome for the iust and righteous, but rather the innocent are the ransome of the wicked. The answere to this experience is, that it is not amisse that Solomon speaketh contrary to the same: for his intent is not to shewe how the wicked are han∣dled of the world, and in the world. For the world afflicteth not his owne, to spare the innocent. Secondly, as concerning the scriptures, Solomon speaketh not against them: for although Iesus Christ bee the ransome of the wicked and vngodly (who is onely iust & righ∣teous Isa. 53. 4. Mat. 20. 28. 1. Cor. 1. 30. Gal. 3. 13. & 4. 4. 5. 1. Tim. 1. 5. 1. Ioh. 4. 9. 10. by nature) which hee hath paide for vs wicked and vngodly, as was figured foorth in the lawe by the sacrifices, and oblations, and was foretolde vs of the Prophetes, and also as hee himself hath saide, and his Apostles affirmed: Neuerthelesse there is no diuer∣sitie betweene the scriptures, and that which Solomon speaketh saying, The vngodly shalbe a ransome, &c. For if wee take good heede wheretoo the enterprises of the wicked tend, and howe God can wel ouerthrow them, we shal vnderstand how the vngodly shalbe the ransome of the iust. For the intent of the wicked is to de∣stroy and roote out the iust and righteous without al remedie. But
what force soeuer they shewe against them, yea although they put them to death, yet neuerthelesse God wil deliuer them, and put the vngodly and wicked in their place: that is to say, he doeth to them, as they had thought to haue done to the iust: and so they are the ransome of the righteous. For when God punisheth the wicked be∣cause of the euil, which they had practised against the righteous, it is as though he toke some ransome of them. That which hath bene saide in the 11. chap. vers. 8. accordeth wel to this. Then seeing the vngodly and wicked are called ransome, let them knowe, that God wil neuer discharge thē, no more then an earthly Prince doeth send away his prisoners of account, till hee haue pledge, or ransome for them. Note wee moreouer that although the wicked bee the ran∣some of the iust and righteous: yet neuerthelesse they satisfie not for them: for Iesus Christe onely is the satisfaction for the sinnes of the whole world. 19 It is better to dwell in a wildernesse then with a chyding and an angrie woman. A wildernesse not only is vnprofitable, but also noysome and hurtful, as the children of Israel deemed it: as may be seene by their complaintes, and murmurings against Moses. Also it is prooued by this, that besides one cannot haue there what is needeful, it is also replenished with wilde beastes, venemous, and cruel. Notwithstan∣ding Solomon preferreth the habitation and dwelling in a desert, before a chyding and an angry woman, and so declareth that it is a very pittiful cace to be accompanied with such a woman. And here∣in hee saith nothing else in substance, but that which hee hath saide heere aboue vers. 9. although he vse other words. For strifes or de∣bates proceede of furie or indignation. Wherefore one might say, that Solomon vseth Repetition, to admonish them surelie that will mary, that they enquire diligently of the partie, which presents her¦selfe, what manners, and conuersation she is of. For when one is maried, he cannot separate himselfe againe, as one may retire him∣selfe out of another country.
20 In a wise mans house there is treasure and oyle: but a foo∣lish body will deuoure it. Although it seeme that Solomon praiseth the wiseman, because hee hath in his house precious treasure and oyle, by the which things are signified greate riches, delicacies, pleasures and voluptu∣ousnesse: yet neuerthelesse, let vs not thinke that if we haue world∣ly prosperitie, that for the same, wee are wise, nor that it is laweful to seeke to gather togither great store of worldly substance, nor to take delight in our owne pleasures and doings, after the desires of the flesh. For the most fooles and naughtipackes are seene to haue plentie of riches. For the scripture (as wee haue partly spoken of) teacheth vs, that wee ought not to set our hartes vppon the riches of this worlde, nor that wee bee giuen to delightes and pleasures, to vse our flesh to his appetite. This is not to say that it is ill done to haue much goods, and enioy the delightes and pleasures of this worlde, so that it bee in sobernesse, and temperance, and that wil∣lingly 1. Cor. 7. 29. wee make our poore neighbours partakers thereof, according to their necessitie and neede, and that wee be readie to yeelde to e∣uery one without any grudging when they neede our aide, accor∣ding as S. Paule teacheth vs. But Solomon instructeth vs, that to possesse and keepe the goods, and pleasures wel, which God giueth vs in plentie to enioy them, and vse them as wee ought, and not to loose nor scatter them abroade, it is necessarie that we be endewed with wisedome. This sense is plaine vnto vs by the Antithesis which he maketh, saying, But a foolish body wil deuoure it. When hee saith, that the foo∣lishe knowe not howe to keepe their goods, but disperse, and wast them, hee sheweth wel that it is very necessarie for vs to bee wise, if wee wil haue our dwelling places replenished with precious trea∣sures and oyle, and by consequent, that our principal treasure bee the feare of God. For it is also the beginning, or principal point of wisedome, and without the same wee cannot bee wise, nor conse∣quently capable to keepe the goods which God giueth vs, and dis∣pose them as wee ought. And this is, why Solomon saieth that the foolish man which is without feare, without reuerence of God, and
without wisedome shal deuoure the precious treasure. Although hee striue to keepe that which hee hath, and spare it asmuch as is possible, and seeke to increase it: neuerthelesse he deuoureth it, be∣cause the same is not sanctified to his vse, and commonly goeth a∣way in smoke sooner then hee thinketh it: or by that which is ta∣ken from him by warre sutes in lawe, theftes and robberies, or that hee himselfe is taken from his goods. Besides this let vs note first of al that Solomon calleth treasure and oyle, the goods that GOD giueth to the wise man: because the wise man, esteemeth it so greatly that although it bee litle, and of smal valewe, and that hee possesseth it with greate difficultie: neuerthelesse, hee contenteth himselfe with it, hee reioiceth in it, and giueth thankes to God for it, beeing warie not to wast it prodigally, but to spend it soberly, and preferreth it before al the riches and pleasures of kings, knowing Psal. 37. 16. that better are a fewe things to the iust man, then greate abun∣dance to the vngodly. For this same reason Solomon attributeth not to him, castles, pallaces or greate houses, but onelie a dwelling place, wherewith hee is content to dwel vnder couert, and lodge there the litle goods which God hath sent him: not that it is not laweful for the wise man to possesse greate riches, & haue a mightie house, and reioice in the same with al modestie. But hee is content with smal thinges, and of litle estimation according to the worlde without desiring more: for hee imagineth that the wil of God is such, which hee wil no wayes withstand. Let vs note second∣ly, that seeing fooles and wicked persons beare enuy and hate a∣gainst the wise and righteous, that they robbe them, and take of their substance, asmuch as they can, that it is not without cause that Solomon complaineth howe they deuoure the precious treasure and oyle: as may bee vnderstood, although wee haue expoun∣ded that the foole deuoureth his substance, because hee keepeth it not by good and laweful meanes, and it is not sanctified to his vse. Note wee thirdly, that the wise men are admonished to instruct their familie in all wisedome and vnderstanding, to the ende that their children bee not fooles, and that they bee not giuen to their mouth, and belly, to consume by gluttony and drunkennesse, the substance which they haue spared: but that they learne to vse it
with al sobrietie, and temperance: and content themselues there∣with, without rauishing other mens goods to deuoure them, and put them to euil. 21 Who so foloweth righteousnesse and mercy, shal find life, righteousnesse and honour. What thing soeuer we doe, we cannot merit at gods hande, nor binde him to yelde and pay vs any rewarde: and this is for diuers reasons. First hee hath treated it vs, and not we ourselues, and gi∣ueth vs al things abundantly for our vse: wherevpon ensueth that we are bounde to serue him according to his wil, and that wee doe nothing but that we ought to doe. For this cause also our Sauiour Iesus Christ admonisheth vs, When you haue done al things which are commanded you, say, yet we are vnprofitable seruants, and haue left vndone those things which we ought to haue done. Secondly, Iohn. 15. 1. we cannot do wel if we become not new creatures in Iesus Christ, as hee himselfe sheweth vs, whereby it foloweth that wee can me∣rite nothing. As also S. Paule argueth of the same reason that wee merite not saluation. Thirdly, wee are neuer so iust but wee sinne. Ephe. 2. 8. Eccle 7. 21. 1. Iohn. 1. 8. Mat. 6. 12. Rom. 7. 14. Also Iesus Christ sheweth it vs wel, when hee wil, that wee aske pardon for our trespasses. Our workes also are neuer perfect, bee they neuer so good. For this cause S. Paule braggeth not of his me∣rites but rather accuseth himselfe. Notwithstanding if wee giue our¦selues to doe wel according to the worde of God, and if we conti∣newe in the same, we shal not loose our labour, but shalbee wel re∣warded, as hee promiseth vs by his worde, and wee haue testimo∣nie thereof in the scriptures. And amongst the rest, when Solomon saith, Who so foloweth righteousnes, &c. We see heere that there is great rewarde in store for them that continewe in doing wel. It is nothing to begin, if one continewe not. And therefore Solomon is not content to say, who so foloweth righteousnes, &c. wheretoo S. Paule accordeth & inuiteth vs to this perseuerance. It is not y∣nough therefore, that for a certaine time, we giue to euery one that which is his owne, and that we be somwhat, and for a certain space pitiful, to them that haue need of another mans aide: but it behoo∣ueth vs to be at al times iust & merciful, seeing we owe continuall
obedience, and submission to his commandements, admonitions & demonstratiōs, which if we performe, we are happy & blessed, as So∣lomon pronounceth it, promising vs that we shal finde life, righte∣ousnesse, and honour. Wherein hee sheweth that wee shal want no∣thing, but first of al God wil giue vs al things needful, for the body which he comprehendeth vnder this word life. Secondly, that for∣giuing vs our trespasses, he wil assure vs of life eternal. Thirdly, that Rom. 8. 30. Colos. 3. 3. 4. hauing iustified vs, hee wil also glorifie vs. 22 A wise man scaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouer∣throweth the strength wherin they trusted. Seeing we haue neither wisedome nor foresight, nor vnderstan∣ding, but that which wee bee taught in the woorde of the Lorde so that we serue him in feare and trembling, it behoueth vs to vnder∣stand that a wiseman in this point, is he which guideth himself vp∣rightly, according as he is taught by this worde, & neither trusteth in his bodily force, nor in the fantasie of his natural sense, neither in any industry or nimblenesse which is in him according to the mā: but only leaneth vnto the Lorde, & taketh him for al his force and might, as Dauid teacheth. Now such a man shal not be void of aide Psal. 18. 2. & succour, to be deliuered from the handes of his enemies for the Lord wil be alwaies ready, when he shal cal vpon his name. As Da∣uid saith, & not only wil deliuer him, but also make him triumphe ouer his foes, as Dauid acknowledged. Which thing he himself proo∣ued, Psal. 18. 29. & many others before him. As Abraham, Iosue, Sampson, Ge∣deon, and others which haue liued in the feare of the Lord. Solomō expresseth it in one word saying, A wiseman scaleth, &c. And this is folowing the promises of God, made to them which shal walke vprightly in his lawe. So the wisedome which is the feare of the Deut. 28. 17. Lorde, is of a farre more excellencie, then al worldly force with∣out comparison. It is that which wee ought principally to retaine in this sentence, to the ende wee folowe that which the Lorde teacheth vs by his Prophet Ieremie, and not that wee enter∣prise Iere. 9. 22. 23 warre, for to occupy another mans dominions. For al∣though these holy personages aboue named, and others haue made warres, and that they haue obtained victory against their foes:
Yet neuerthelesselet vs not thinke, that by their example it is lawful for vs to inuade another mans countrie, for first they knewe that it was Gods wil they shoulde doe so. Secondly they were not led by their owne proper affections, searching their particular profite. But they pursued the glory of God, striuing to destroy his enemies, & the enemies of his Churche. Thirdly this happened them in figure, to the end wee shoulde learne to behaue ourselues valiantly against the Diuel, our flesh, and sinne, which are enemies to God. Wee are inuited to this warre in many places of the scriptures: as it hath bene alledged partlie heeretofore. Moreouer let vs learne that it is follie to trust in places wel fortified and defended according to the worlds opinion, and that wee ought so to walke in fayth, and in the feare of God, that wee may say with Dauid. Some put their trust in chariots and other some in horses: But we haue recorded the name Psa. 20. 8. 9. of the Lord our God. 23 Who so keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the same kee∣peth his soule from troubles. Itseemeth to many that to shunne afflictions, nothing else is needeful, but to haue a multitude of friends, and that they bee re∣doupted, and mightie. And to get such friends, one ought to be con∣uersant with greatmen, stil pleasing them and flattering them, lying, making false reportes, and backbyting, iesting, and telling tales of laughter. Such people thinke themselues sure ynough, and out of danger: but they are far disceiued, as common proofe sheweth. For one shal see it oftē come to passe, that those which haue such vaine, & venemous tongues, fal in great distresse, according as they are also menaced in the scriptures. These menaces are put in execution, now by iudges, another while by stryfes, seditions, and warres, and some∣times Dent. 19. 16. Psa. 5. 7. & 12. 2. & 50. 19. by other punishments. Now to the ende that we may shunne such threatnings and punishments. Solomon sheweth vs what wee haue to doe, when he saith. Who so keepeth his mouth, &c. He tea∣cheth vs to be silent & fly al vaine talke that is superfluous & hurt∣ful, & to folow that which Dauid saith, I haue bin domb, & not said a word. And to do wel this same, it behoueth vs to praye like him, Psal. 39. 2. & 141. 3. Set a watch Lord before my mouth, & keepe the dore of my lips.
If we do thus, he promiseth vs that we shal keepe our soules: That is to say, our persons from tribulation, not that we shal keepe them, but that there wil come many: but that by the grace of God, wee shal ouercome them al, as it is written. Such deliuerance shal not be of smal endurance, as Dauid sheweth vs. There is another kinde of Ps. 34. 19. 13 keeping ones mouth: of the which together with this same, it hath bene spoken of. Chap. 13. verse, 3. 24 He is called proude, arrogant, and scornful, which in his wrath worketh presumptuously. Although sometimes men of the world attribute names vnto personages suche as they deserue: yet neuerthelesse most vsually, they attribute names & titles which are nothing fitting for the per∣sons: and this is either to flatter them, or to reproche and blame them without iust cause, onely because they wil bee welcome vnto thē, vnto whō they vse these honourable titles; & because they hate them whome they reproch and blame, in giuing them vile and in∣famous names. And therefore the children of God shal haue no re∣garde to suche names and titles, knowing that their names are re∣gistred in heauen, and that the memorie of them is eternal before God. But the holie scripture calleth no man, but as is wel agreeing either to his nature, his affections, or his maners. It flattereth no man, although it giue verie honourable names and titles to the faithful, neither blameth it any bodie, but vpon iust cause. For the scripture is diuinely inspired and indited by the holy Ghost, which is teacher of al trueth, and hath lying in hate. And so, when Solomon saith, That he is called, &c: he setteth here no title, which is not fitting for him that worketh presumptuously: That is to say, to him that doeth his deedes by audacitie, temeritie, and rashnesse, and persuadeth with himselfe, that hee ought not to faile, but to mooue himself furiously against them, that wil any way withstand him. Of such men the presumption is so great, that they dare striue against God, in despiting, cursing, and renouncing him, and despi∣sing rashly al holie religion, good admonitions and corrections. Al∣so it is by good right, that Solomon calleth them, proude, arrogant, and scornful, as in truth they are, whē they are transported with so
furious a presumption. Nowe seeing such names and titles displease vs, let vs haue regarde to vse ourselues vprightly, in al modestie, feare, and humilitie, and the Lorde wil graunt vs his grace. But if wee beare the name of proude, arrogant, and scornful, hee wil re∣sist vs stoutly, and destroye vs, according to the threatenings which haue bene alledged heretofore. Wee may wel be obstinate and har∣dened in our opinion, despisers of God, and of his worde, reuenge∣ful, wrongdoers, and outragious, but this can not let God to do his worke, and vse and execute his iust vengeance against vs, for his highnesse which is to vs incomprehēsible, is aboue al worldly high∣nesse. As he hath wel shewed at the flood, vpon Sodome and Go∣morrha, on Pharao, and the people of Egypt, and vppon many o∣thers. 25 The desire of the slouthful shal kil him: for his handes haue refused to labour. Solomon bare great hate both to slouth, and the slouthful, as hee sheweth wel, when so often he threatneth the slothful with po∣uertie and need, with destruction and death. And by suche repetiti∣ons he teacheth vs to flye slouth. And againe, presently, when hee saieth, The desire, &c. Wherein also hee sheweth vs, who are the slouthful, that is to wit, curious of the goods and substance of an other man. For by what right soeuer they possesse goods, seeing they employe not themselues to labour, they vsurpe and eate the bread of them which folow the vocation whereto God hath called them, for they are the seruantes and children of the Lorde, whose the earth and the heauen is, and al therein contained, and consequent∣ly, they onely are inheritours of the worlde. And so the slouthful are couetous, theeues, and robbers, whereupon ensueth, that they are woorthie of death. Also Solomon threateneth the sluggish ther∣with, when he saith, His desire shal kil him. And when hee so saith, he threatneth him secretly of eternal death. For if God deeme not the slouthful man woorthie of this present life, it foloweth, that he wil not giue him life eternal. It is therefore euil spoken, when one saith of a sluggard, that he is a good man, except hee take good for vnprofitable: for wee ought to attribute no goodnesse to him, that God condemneth.
26 He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and spareth not. Sith hee putteth the righteous, as contrarie to the slouthful, he sheweth wel that the slouthful is wicked, and that hee deserueth wel to haue pouertie, destruction, and decaie. And when he putteth, giueth, and spareth not, against coueteth greedily: hee sheweth the insatiable auarice, and great crueltie of the slouthful. Hee sheweth that the slouthful hath no care of himselfe, and that hee hath no compassion, nor pitie of the poore. And this is for no smal while, but he perseuereth in his auarice & crueltie. For, as Solomon saieth, He coueteth greedily al the day long. And contrarie, The righte∣ous neuer ceaseth to doe good, as Solomon declareth, when hee saieth, And he spareth not. Wherein we see, that we cannot claime the title of being righteous, if we perseuer not to vse charitie, and doe the workes of mercie. But although it be saide, that the slug∣garde hath a care of himselfe, neuerthelesse the care that hee hath, is not properly care, but onely a greedinesse more then bestial. For if hee had a due care of himselfe, hee woulde studie to woorke the health of his soule, with feare and trembling. And in this maner, he woulde saue both bodie and soule, whereas nowe they go to wrack and ruine. For iudgement shalbe done without mercie, to him that hath vsed no mercie. Contrariwise, the righteous man prouideth Deu. 12. 2. 3. Mat. 13. 41. & 25. 31. Ioh. 5. 28. 29. for his soule and bodie by giuing, and perseuering to doe wel: See∣ing that, Blessed are the merciful, for they shal obtaine mercie, yea, perpetual mercie both in bodie and soule. 27 The sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil. The wicked worke in diuers maners both towards God & man: for some proceede with good intention, and think to doe God good seruice, & ought to bee praised of their neighbours for their deedes. As Saint Paule did before hee was called to the knowledge of the Gospel. As also many in the Papacie, which thinke to doe
God good seruice in murthering his seruauntes and children, as Ie∣sus Christ hath foretolde his Apostles. But what good meaning so∣euer Iohn. 16. 2. they haue, their workes are wicked and abhominable, & prin∣cipally before God. As Solomon hath saide. He saith also, anewe. The sacrifice of the wicked, is abhomination. These here are hypo∣crites Prou. 15. 8. hauing some outward shewe of holines, & religion, & within there is nothing but malice, which maketh them vse crueltie, and inhumanitie. Although they themselues thinke not so, or at least∣wise seeke to persuade themselues, that there is no harme neither in their thoughts and deliberations, nor in their enterprises & pro∣ceedinges. See here what they be that proceede with good inten∣tion, and in what reputation their woorkes are with God. Where∣vpō ensueth that they may wel trauel, afore they obtain that which they thinke they deserue: for seeing their workes are abhominable before God, it is meete that they goe to perdition and decaie. There are an other sort of wicked men which are more shamelesse. For al∣though they knowe wel, that they neither are nor wil be of any va∣lue, and that they doe wrongfully against their consciences, beeing wholly infected with wicked thoughtes, mindes and willes, yet ne∣uerthelesse, they wil haue reputation of religion and holinesse by some workes which haue faire apparance outwardly. But (as they wel deserue) both they & their workes are more abhominable then the others which proceed with good intention, and their hypocri∣sie is more wicked. As Solomon signifieth, saying. By howe muche more they bring it with an euil wil. In the number of these heere, one must put al them that leade a life quite contrarie to the lawe of God, and in the meane while, seeke to blinde the eyes of others by ceremonies: which shoulde be good, if they had vpright heartes, and that in the rest, their conuersation were vnworthie of blame. 28 The false witnesse shal perishe: but a man that heareth, shal stil speake. Although the false witnesses knowe that they lye, and that their consciences reprooue, & reprehend them, and they can soone condemne those that should beare false witnesse against them, and iudge them worthie of death, not onely temporal, but also eternal:
yet neuerthelesse they seeke to lye assuredly, without remorce of conscience, insomuche as they thinke that God neither heareth, nor seeth them: and they weene that their falshood and lying shal not come to the knowledge of any Iudge which shal haue power to pu∣nishe them. For this cause, the Scripture threateneth them often, as we haue seene heeretofore, as wel in the lawe, and Prophetes, as in this present booke. And againe, wee see this present threatening, which is conformable to them that are gone astraie. Suche mena∣ces are made, and redoubled for diuers reasons. First to terrifie, and afraie al lyers and false witnessers, and those which take the name of God in vaine: being such as sweare superfluous othes, and are blas∣phemers, cursers, and renouncers of God, and that being so often menaced, they are made more faultie. Secondly, that wee bee wel admonished to take heede of ourselues, to the ende wee become careful to folowe trueth, and to flye from lying. Thirdly, to the ende that Iustices, and Magistrates bee diligent to inquire out the trueth, and not to let slip the false witnessers vnpunished, as it is ex∣presly commanded them in the lawe, and hath bene alledged here∣tofore. But because contrarie to the false witnesse, he putteth a man that heareth: and against perishe, placeth speaking stil: wee haue to note first of al, that the lyar and false witnesser hath neither lawe nor Faith, and consequently, no religion: for, to yeeld obedience to the lawe, one ought to heare, and to submit himselfe to Fayth, he ought also to speake. And in these two pointes consisteth the Chri∣stian Deu. 4. 1. & 6. 4. Esai. 53. 1. Rom. 10. 14. Mat. 1. 15. religiō, besides the which there is no religion. We may know it by the beginning of the preaching of our Lord Iesus Christ. Then seeing trueth consisteth in the word of God, which is declared by the lawe and Gospel, it must needes be, that he which wil not heare the woorde, must be voide of trueth, and replenished with lying, and falshood, and that hee be without religion, seeing also, hee is without God, and forceth not if God, which cannot consist with∣out his trueth, be depriued of his diuinitie, and be no more God. For in as muche as in him is, hee maketh him authour of vntruth: and seeing wee vtterly abhorre the false witnesser, (yea as it were by nature) it behooueth vs to heare, and yeelde ourselues atten∣tiue to the worde of trueth, and then we shal not be of the num∣ber of false witnesses, which perishe: but wee shalbee in safetie
in the Church of our Lord God, which is kept by the veritable. Secondly, after lyers and false witnesses haue once vttered Psal. 15. 1. their lyes quite against their consciences, to dishonour God, and blame and vndoe their neighbours, finally, they shall haue their mouthes closed, and be vtterly confused, seeing themselues reiec∣ted of God, and bee in damnation and death eternal, and that the euil which they thought to doe by their lying, be falne vpon them for euer, without any remedie. And also where they see that they, whome they woulde haue destroyed, vndone, and made dombe by their falshoode, shal haue their mouthes open, and shal speake without cease, and not perishe: As Abel the righteous, although hee was slaine by Caine, yet notwithstanding, his blood cryed, and Gen. 4. 10. Hebr. 11. 4 beeing dead, yet hee spake: for God had care ouer him, as hee wil haue also ouer al them which are attentiue to his worde, taking vengeance in his yre and furie vpon those, which haue vexed them, and placing them in the celestial glorie, to haue ioye, honour, and sauegarde, for euer. See howe Solomon meaneth, that those which heare the worde of God, shal speake stil. 29 An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iust refor∣meth his owne way. Although the wicked knowe wel, that they doe nothing that is good, and that naturally without the scriptures they see that they are guiltie, and principally before God, as they giue and haue cer∣taine argument thereof, when they are afraide of the iudgements of God, because their consciences reprooue them of their misdeeds: Yet neuerthelesse as Solomon saith, They harden their faces, That is to say, they haue a fierce, and arrogant behauiour, both in wordes and gesture, to giue to vn∣derstand, that they neither feare nor doubt any thing: and the more wicked they are, the more they striue to assure themselues, and set a good face on the matter, saying in their heartes, wee haue made aliance with death, and knowe what hell is. And in this opinion, they make no account to conuert themselues to any goodnesse, bee Esai. 28. 15 it to thinke, say, or doe. Solomon sheweth that hee meaneth this by hardening the face. When hee saieth, But the iust reformeth
his owne way. For against hardening the face, hee putteth re∣formeth his waies, which is no other thing, but the feare and reue∣rence, which one hath to the woorde, to studie howe to frame his Phil. 2. 3. minde and thought, his wordes, and workes to the wil of God, for to serue him duely, and worke his soules health with feare & trem∣bling. Psa. 5. 9. & 25. 4. 5. 8. 9. & 119. 5. & 143. 10. Which thing of ourselues we doe not: for it is God which worketh in vs both the wil and the effect according as it pleaseth him. Wherefore we haue to pray with Dauid, Lord leade me in thy righteousnesse, &c. 30 There is neither wisedome nor vnderstanding, nor counsell against the Lord. We ought to be resolued of this, that God aloweth that which is not against him, loueth it, and maintaineth it, and maketh it serue to his honour, and to the edification of his, according as hee seeth expedient. But hee reprooueth the wise and sage men of the world. And their wisedom, vnderstanding and counsel, cursing them, ouer∣throwing them, and destroying them, as the scriptures witnesse. Whereby it may seeme at first viewe, that Solomon saying, There Iob. 5. 12. 13. Esa. 5. 21. & 29. 14. 15. & 44. 25. & 8. 9. 10. Psal. 33. 10. is neither wisedome, &c. saide against the scriptures. And therefore when he saith, Against the Lord: That is to say, which can let or stay the counsel of the Lord, ouerthrow his ordinances, and breake of his attemptes, For although the wise men of the world studie to resist him, yet neuerthelesse his wil must needes bee accomplished, yea at his only worde without any other adoe. Wherefore whē we haue God on our side, although we be but a litle handful, and folks Psal. 33. 8. 9. Esa. 46. 9. 10 without force, and worldly wisedome, yet wee ought not to bee a∣fraide, though al the worlde, and al the power of hel were against vs, but in al safetie to say with Dauid, I haue laide mee downe and slept, and haue risen vp againe for the Lorde susteined mee. I will not be afraide of tenne thousand of men, &c. Wee ought to con∣fesse Psal. 3. 5. that which Iob saith, Yea with him is wisdom and force, coun∣sel and vnderstanding.
31 The horse is prepared against the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie. Men make many preparations for the warres, to the end, that by the same, they may compasse their enemies, and obtaine victorie against them, or that if it happen that they be too weake, they may saue themselues. And therefore there is no preparation where∣in man more trusteth, then in the Horse (for a man beeing moun∣ted vppon a light and valiant Horse (as him seemeth) hee may pursue his enemies with more speede, and ouertake them soo∣ner then if hee were on foote: and if hee haue neede to flye, hee shal saue himselfe the better: for this cause, the Scripture making mention of warre, of assault, or of fight, speaketh rather of Horses, Deut. 17. 16. Psal. 20. 8. 9. & 33. 16. 17. & 76. 6. 7. Esai. 31. 1. then of any other Munitions, blaming and accusing them that trust therein. Wherefore, to the ende wee be not blamed, and accused of vaine confidence, let vs put al the hope of our health, victorie, and deliuerance in the Lorde: as the Scriptures teach vs. And also Solomon nowe admonisheth vs, when hee saieth, The Horse is prepared for the day of battel. Hee forbid deth not that one should defende himselfe against his enemies, neither to resist them manfully, and to kil and slaie them, if hee cannot o∣therwise discomfite them: but he wil that one haue regarde to the Lorde. And that we knowe that al our preparations, and Muniti∣ons Psal. 121. 1 & 123. 1. Psal. 124. 1. & 127. 1. & 144. 1. Psal. 145. 18 & 147. 10. Exod. 14. 24. & 15. 1. Gen. 15. 14 are but vanitie, and serue to no purpose, if God himselfe labour not, defending, deliuering and sauing vs from the violence of our foes. And if we wil feele this aide, let vs not feare men, be they ne∣uer so wel appointed, but let vs feare the Lorde, and cal vppon his name. And as he can wel saue and keepe the faithful, which put their trust in him: so can he easily destroy their foes, as the Scripture wit∣nesseth, whereof the people giue thankes. And thus folowing the promise made to Abraham: and also folowing other promises, hee hath often saued his people, and destroyed their enemies.
The xxii. Chapter. A Good name is more too bee desired then great ri∣ches: and a louing fauour more then siluer and golde. EVery one of vs is naturally enclined to desire, and choose that which see∣meth to him good & profitable. And there are some, which are so addicted to their peculiar profite to enriche themselues, that they forget al hone∣stie, and al humanitie, and care not in what credite and reputation they be, nor if they be esteemed or no, if they can compasse to make themselues tiche and mightie, for they thinke stil, that if they come once to such estate, they shal then haue neede of no body, but many shal haue neede of them, and fauour and flatter them, shewing themselues to bee at their commandement: And it is the maner of worldlinges, and carnal men to make account of the riche, and cal them honest men, and haue them in admiration, there are some that although they desire to bee in reputation, yet they thinke that nothing is to bee accounted of but of riches: And therefore they set al their whole minde and affection thereon, to the ende to bee aduanced & praised. Al such men are farre abused: for it is not them that wee Gen. 6. 4. praise, but their riches, as they shoulde soone know, if they had eies: for it is manifest, that if the riche man once become poore, hee is despised of them, yea that shewed themselues in his prosperitie to bee his greatest friendes. And therefore they are worthie to bee re∣prehended, and so Solomon doeth reprehende them saying, A good name is more to bee desired: then great riches. And hee sheweth vs that which wee ought to desire and choose aboue al thinges in this worlde, to wit, a good name, and fauour not as the Giants did in the time Noe: nor as iesters doe, which by lyes, flat∣teries,
fables, and tales, doe purchace fauour: but by discrete man∣ners, and honest conuersation, by iustice and equitie, humilitie and temperance, and by other fruites of a righteous heart and sound con¦science, which maketh vs to get credite, and be acceptable and wor∣thie of prayse both before God and our neighbours. This ought more to be desired of vs then all other things, which one can wishe for in this world, be they neuer so precious, for they are fraile and transitorie subiect to vanitie and corruption, but a good name and a louing fauour remain for euer. Which thing Solomon sheweth wel, when hee preferreth it before riches, golde, and siluer. Saint Paule also sheweth it wel, when hee willeth vs to set our minds on things of a good report and praise, and when hee promiseth that in thus doing, the God of peace wil be with vs. But although wee ought Phil. 4. 8. 9. greatly to set by a good name and louing fauour, yet neuerthe∣lesse wee ought greatly to take heede of being ambitious, to couet that others shoulde praise vs, and haue vs in estimatiō for our good deedes, but wee ought to search the glory of God, and the edifica∣tion of our neighbours, without thinking on our owne good name and reputation: for it is not for vs to exalt ourselues: wee must ta∣ry til God doe it, yea he alone which hath power to exalt and hum∣ble, whome hee pleaseth. And if wee walke in integritie and vp∣rightnesse of conscience, although wee bee a reproche to al men: yet hee wil make our innocencie to shine foorth, where he seeth good, as hee hath doone with Ioseph, Dauid, Daniel, & others. And also as it is seene, when the wicked are constrained to speake wel of them, whome they persecute vniustly. 2 The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the ma∣ker of themal. In this worlde there are diuers states, as is seene: there are poore men, rich men, weake and strong, abiects, and aduaunced. And yet neuerthelesse this diuersitie, God hath not sticked to put them altogether, and to binde them one to another, Solomon signifieth this same, when hee saith, The rich and poore meete together. But in this meeting there is despite, and enuie, for the rich disdaine, and despise the poore, and
the poore vse enuie against the riche and mightie. In which doing, they dishonour God, which hath put eche one in that estate that hath pleased him, Solomon sheweth it wel, saying, The Lorde is the maker of them all. And this is following that which Anna saith, The Lorde maketh poore and riche, where∣in wee ought to learne that euery one of vs shoulde content him∣selfe with his estate, and acknowledge that it is good, to receiue at the handes of the Lorde, with thankes giuing, al that which pleaseth him to sende, knowing that hee placeth vs, where hee thinketh most profite for vs: and though wee wil not acknowledge it, yet it ceas∣seth not to bee so. Secondly vpon this worde Meete, let riche Sam. 27. 8. men learne not to disdaine the familiar conuersation of the poore, and that it is no hurt for them to make thē partakers of the goods which God hath put into their handes: for seeing God is the ma∣ker of the riche man, it foloweth, that those riches, are committed to him, to doe according to the minde of his maker. Otherwise he shoulde not be a wise, and faithful seruant. Thirdly, Let not the riche man vaunt of his riches, seeing he hath them not of himselfe, and they are his but for a litle season. Also let not the poore man be sadde, and vexed at his pouertie: seeing that God who hath placed him in that estate, knoweth wel what is needful for euerie one, see∣ing also that pouertie is of smal endurance, and that after the same, we shal attaine to riches inestimable. 3 A wise man seeth the plague, and hydeth himselfe: But the foolish goe on stil, and are punished. We ought to hold for certentie, that God, who is not vnconstāt, disposeth, gouerneth, and guideth al the world, according as he hath foreseene and ordeined before the foundation of the worlde, and there is none that can let him, to accomplish his determinations & enterprises, & to fulfil al his whole wil & pleasure. meane while this is not to say, that wee ought not to take diligent heede to that which wee haue to doe, and eschewe, according to the wisdome and skill that God hath giuen vs, and that wee spare not the strength and diligence, that hee hath indued vs with, for hee wil not haue the giftes which he hath giuen vs to be ydle, & vnprofitable. Also as
his prouidence is no let that wee wil not: so our wil ouerthroweth not the diuine prouidence, seeing that if wee haue any wil or vnder∣standing, it proceedeth from this prouidence. Also although it beho∣ueth that that which God hath ordeined eternally, come to passe of necessitie, and that none can let it, yet neuerthelesse, God by his worde desisteth not to teach vs that which wee haue to doe, or es∣chewe, to admonishe vs, reprehende vs, threaten vs, and condemne vs, as one may see in the holy scriptures, wherefore we shal doe no iniurie to the diuine prouidence, when wee shal search diligently the scriptures, and shal carefully heare the worde, which is faithful∣ly expounded vnto vs, and that by this meanes they shal learne a good wisedome to the ende to gouerne ourselues warily that we be not surprised with dangers on the soden, but that wee may shunne the damage which may happen to vs, that as to sottes, foolishe, and yl aduised, wee make no account to keepe ourselues, and to drawe backe from the danger which presenteth it selfe to assaile vs, and in∣trappe vs. Solomon praiseth such wisedome, when he saith, A wise man seeth, &c. Here he speaketh not of carnal & world∣ly wise men: for they cannot hide themselues so wel, but they wil be surprised: but hee speaketh of them of whome it hath bene spo∣ken off heretofore. They that are suche, by the worde of the Lord, Iob. 5. 12. 13. Pro. 13. 16. & 14. 8. 15. 16. doe foresee the euil which is to come to the wicked, which set not their mindes vpon this worde. They knowe also that men practise many euils, to them which seeke to liue in holinesse, innocencie, & righteousnes. And so they see the euil, & hide themselues, trusting in the shadow of the wings of the Lord, & saying, Keepe me as the apple of thy eye, & hyde me in the shadow of thy wings. And as Psal. 17. 8. 9. & 57. 2. they demande this same, putting their trust in the goodnes, & mer∣cy of God, so they obtain it. For although by persecutions, & other aduersities they dye, & fal away according to outward apparance, yet notwithstanding they are surely hid, vnder the defence, protecti∣on, & safegard of the Lord. But they which haue not the foresight, nor make no account to guide themselues according to the worde: although for a certain season (as for the space of this life) they seeme to bee out of al danger, yet neuerthelesse experience teacheth of∣ten, that GOD spareth them not, and when the plagues and dangers of this worlde wil not touche them, yet they shall not
shunne the tormentes that are eternal: Solomon signifieth thus, saying, But the foolish goe on still, and are punished. By this woorde goe on, or passe forwarde, is shewed assurance and inconsideration or rather the ouer boldnesse and obstinacie, which the ill aduised vse, who make no account to learne by the worde to flie from the plague, but tary they neuer so long, yet they are punished, but prin∣cipally after this life, where is no redemption. The foolish therfore, whereof Solomon speaketh, be scorners and contemners of GOD and of his worde, which onely giueth vnderstanding and foresight. The foolishe are also those, which the worlde reputeth for most hardy and valiant, and those that think themselues so. In num∣ber with such men one may put Pharao, Saul, Sennacherib, Nabu∣chodonozer, Iudas, & others, which suffered themselues to be cari∣ed away by the malice of their heartes, and are hardy to do & say ill without sparing, but when sometimes fearing men more then God, they make shewe to withdraw themselues and abstaine from doing euil, to the ende to shunne temporal tormentes: But they can∣not flee so long, but at the last they wil be punished with euerlasting torments. 4 The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life. It is not enough to imploy ones selfe about something, to bee recompensed: for many meddle with matters wherein they haue no knowledge but to marre al, and so they merite sooner to bee puni∣shed, then to haue rewarde. But in doing any thing, one ought to knowe, howe and by what meanes he should proceede not to loose his labour. Many, to get goods and honour, and to make them∣selues as it were immortal, thinke that there is no way so good, as to make themselues of value by arrogancie, and pride, by boldenes, temeritie and rashnesse, without hauing regarde to the reuerence which wee owe al to God and to his worde: but after hauing ta∣kē great paines in this sort, they find at last, that not only they haue beaten the winde, and profited nothing, but also that they are uy∣nated, and come to decay. Some feele it in this life, and al the wicked
shal feele it in death eternal: for the sentence must needes bee true, that Whosoeuer exalteth himselfe shalbe brought low, and contra∣riwise hee that humbleth himselfe shalbe exalted, as it hath beene Pro. 16. 18. 19. & 18. 12 treated heretofore. The humble therefore looseth not his labour: but is wel rewarded, as Solomon declareth it plainely, when hee saith, The reward of humilitie and feare of the Lord, &c. Wherby he sheweth that the waies to aduance ones selfe, are humilitie, and feare: hee putteth not humilitie alone: for many haue been humble, that is to say, vile, abiect, out castes, and afflicted, which haue not ob∣tained this hyre: but haue beene still miserable, and finally haue pe∣rished for euer, but hee ioyneth with humilitie, The feare of the Lorde, for if we be afraide indeede to offend God, desiring to yeeld him obedience according to his worde, although to the outwarde apparance wee be the most vile and abiect, the most poore and mise∣rable of al the worlde, yet the Lorde can wel pay vs in opportunitie & when he shal see good, the hyre wherof mention is made, seeing he cannot lye, but his trueth is infallible. Nowe hee hath promised to them that feare him, that they shal lack no good thing, and hee hath promised great riches to their ofspring. Dauid praiseth the Lorde for the giftes that hee giueth to them which feare him, and promiseth them that feare him to fulfil Psa. 34. 9. 10 11. & 25. 12. 13. 14. & 31. 20. 21. & 145. 18. 19. 20. their desires. Solomon according with the foresaide scriptures, saith that the humble which feare the Lorde shal haue riches, honour, & life, they shal haue riches, for they shal haue suffisance and con∣tentment. They shal haue honour, for the Lorde shal deliuer them from al rebukes, and shal place them in honours from this time pre∣sent, if it bee needeful, as Dauid, Ioseph, Moses and others. But it shalbe principally in eternal and heauenly honours. They shal haue life, for hee wil deliuer them the handes of those which perse∣cute and oppresse them, and shal make them liue, yea in this world, as hee hath made the aforesaide: and as hee maketh presently the poore faithful flocke, which hee hath rent out of the handes of their persecutors: but the principal life shalbe in that glorious immor∣talitie.
5 Thornes and snares are in the way of the frowarde: but who so keepeth his soule, will flee farre from them. Hee compareth the frowarde to the hunter, which striueth to take and kil wilde beastes, for as the hunter hath no pitie of the beastes, neither spareth hee them, but setteth snares in bushes and thornes, wherethrough hee chaseth the beastes, so to take them and vse them at his pleasure: Euen so the frowarde hath no pitie of the innocent, and to destroy him hee hath secrete fetches, which are without al humanitie, and cruel: as Solomon signifieth by Thornes and snares: for the thornes pricke, and the snares that are pitched in the same, doe stay the pray, til the hunter come to worke his will and pleasure thereon. Now as concerning the froward which one may cōpare to hun∣bters, there are some which set snares, and hunt after both goods and odies ro rob, and murder them, as theeues, couetous men, and v∣surers doe, which are replenished with great crueltie, wherwith being led & trāsported, they pitch, the snares of violence & oppres∣sion, of processe, striffes, and debates, of swordes and weapons, of giftes to corrupt the Iudges, or other subtil wayes to doe iniurie, & outrage to the innocent: such frowarde persons are very wicked, and hurtful, and noysome to their neighbours: as experience she∣weth but too much. But thinking to aduance themselues and make great profite by this meanes, they choke themselues vp with the thornes of riches, and care and the delights and pleasures of this worlde. And by and by they fal into temptation. Yet notwith∣standing they are not most hurtful, for they spoyle but temporal goods, and kil but the bodies Also it is not of them that Solomon speaketh heere nowe, as he himselfe sheweth, when he saith, Who so keepeth his soule, &c. for to keepe ones soule is not to flee farre from them, and their ambushes, to shunne the damage that they may doe to the goods and body, bee it not that wee take the soule for this present life, and the commodities thereof. They that flee far from the ambushes of such froward persons, keepe their soules, that
is to say, they liue out of al danger, and enioy the commodities that are temporal and corporal. But Solomon hath regarde to another life and other commodities, to wit, spiritual and eternal. Wherfore let vs note that there are other frowarde persons, farre worse then the aboue named, for they set snares to destroy the soules, and sende them to hel and fire vnquenchable. These are the infidels, superstiti∣ous, idolaters, friers, and monkes, which persecute the members of Iesus Christe because of his name. The false Prophetes also, and tea∣chers of lies, and heretiques which pitch the snares of false doctrine, and wicked opinions. And because they are perillous, the scripture vseth great complaintes against them, and chiefly in the Psalmes. Psal. 10. 9 & 35. 7. 8. Rom. 16. 17. If wee wil truely keepe our soules vnto life euerlasting, it is best we bee careful to flee from their snares, as the Apostle Saint Paule tea∣cheth vs. 6 Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee shall not leaue it when hee is olde. Many thinke that it is not need eful to busie themselues about little children, to teache and instruct them: Some because they thinke that one shoulde let them play at their pleasure, and not break their braines with melancholy about knowledge and instruction. Others, because that children are light and wanton, and not yet ca∣pable to reteine that which is taught them, because they set not their mindes thereon, but rather on vanitie and folly: but when Iesus Christe receiued the children that were brought him, hee she∣weth wel, that wee ought to bee careful to instruct them: and also when hee accepted the praise of children. Saint Paule likewise she∣weth it wel, whē he praiseth Timothie in that he was instructed frō Mat. 19. 13. & 21. 16. 2. Tim. 3. 15 his infancie. It is meete therefore to instruct children in the feare of the Lord by his word, and not to suffer thē to liue loosely in las∣ciuiousnesse, to the ende that when they become olde, they may bee so accustomed to holde the way of holinesse, innocencie, iustice, and true religion, that they can neuer withdrawe themselues there∣fro againe, but haue al their delight and pleasure therein, Solomon teacheth vs to doe so when hee saith, Teache a childe, &c. when he saith, teache, or giue the first
principles of science, and instruction, he sheweth that if one haue no care to conduct, (as it were by the hande) children in the right way and knowledge and trueth, it must needes be that they wil remaine ignorant, for they can of themselues learne nothing of that which they ought to vnderstande, but rather giue themselues too vanitie and folly, yea to malice and wickednesse, as experience sheweth it. And when he saith, the childe, and not the man, he sheweth in what age one is capable to receiue instruction, and that we must not tary til the person bee come to great age, and almost past teaching, for we see that it is almost vnpossible to put any good thing into the head of such a one, but as hee hath liued in ignorance, so he wil continue therein. It is therefore very necessary to learne betimes, and not to tary til one haue an harde vnderstanding. Moreouer, when he saith, In the entrance, or in the mouth of his wayes: Let vs vnderstand, that as a little childe cannot of himselfe take his bodily foode, if it be not put in his mouth: so hee cannot guide and gouerne his soule, if that from the beginning hee be not wel entered, and that one faile not to set him right in the mouth of his way, which is called his, not because he naturally walketh therin, or that hee chooseth it of himselfe: but because it is meete that for the health of his soule, and to doe his duetie towardes God and men, he followe such a way as the Lorde hath ordeined him by his worde. If children from the beginning be so wel entred, they wil perseuer in goodnesse, as long as they liue in this worlde, as Solomon signifieth well, saying, For he shall not leaue it, when he is olde: yea if they haue wel recei∣ued the instruction, so that they haue wel printed it in their mindes and heartes: for as one cannot bee nourished by putting meate in the mouth, if hee doe not chawe it, swallowe it, and disgest it: So what paine soeuer one take with children to instruct them, yet hee shal not profite with them, if God giue them not the grace to take pleasure therein. If therefore one see many of those, with whome one hath taken paine in their youth, to bee loose and disso∣lute in their age, it is a signe that they haue not taken pleasure indeede to haue one teach them, and that they are vnthankful for that goodnes which one would haue done to them, as there are many of that sort, specially in the place where the Gospel is most preached.
wherefore if fathers and mothers desire that their children become honest, let them beginne betimes to instruct them: also let rulers and magistrates bridle youth, and ministers bee carefull to admini∣ster the worde faithfully, with suche facilitie, that it bee as milke too little ones to nourishe and increase them. 7 The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boro∣weth, shalbe seruant to the lender. The man that thinketh himselfe rich when he hath great abun∣dance of temporal goods, not onely despiseth and disdaineth the poore, but also wil make them subiect vnto him: and to doe this same, he vseth towards them oppression and violence, as one seeth Iam. 2. 6. by experience, and Saint Iames sheweth it. And this is that which Solomon signifieth, saying, The rich man, &c. Although it bee ve∣ry needeful that they to whome God hath giuen rule and signiorie bee riche to susteine the charges: yet neuerthelesse Solomon stic∣keth not to blame the rich, because of their boldnesse and arrogan∣cie, their oppression and violence which they vse towardes them which cannot defende themselues, or which are bound to them af∣ter the fleshe, because of the succour which they shewe them with their riches, in helping their necessitie: when it appertaineth onely Iam. 1. 5. to Kinges, Princes, and Gouernours of the earth to rule, we ought to vnderstand that Solomon blameth the rich men, saying, That they beare rule ouer the poore. For seeing they vsurpe that which appertaineth not to them, they exercise tyranny for the which they ought to loooke for an horrible punishment. Now as by the abundance of worldly goods, one is puffed vp, & exalted aboue the needy: so also necessitie constraineth folkes, to abase themselues, and to bee humble and meeke before them, whom they haue to do with to bee aided, and succoured, as ensueth, And he that boroweth, shalbe seruant, &c. as he hath rebuked the hau∣tinesse & tyranny of the riche, so he reprehendeth the poore world∣lings (which are afraide least the earth faile them) of pulsillanimitie and flatterie. And by good right, for although we ought to serue one
an other by charitie, yet neuerthelesse wee ought to take heede of being seruantes of men, otherwise wee cannot bee the seruantes of Christ. And therefore Saint Paule biddeth seruantes, that in o∣beying their maisters, they be also seruantes of Christ. Moreouer, 1. Cor. 7. 23. Gal. 1. 10. note wee, that when pouertie constraineth men to serue, and it is not that which wee desire, but we craue to be at libertie, that Solo∣mon warneth vs to woorke diligently, to the ende, that wee may haue to susteine ourselues with our familie, and that wee bee not forced to abase ourselues to borrowe more then God hath appoin∣ted vs by his worde. 8 Hee that soweth wickednesse, shal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger shal faile. The holie Ghost in the sacred scriptures, compareth often our workes to seede, be they good or bad, as also there is good and bad seede. Suche a comparison is made verie fitly: for like as the labou∣rer, which medleth with the earth, reapeth willingly such seede as Iob. 4. 8. 9. 1. Cor. 9. 11. & 2. Cor. 9. 6. 10. Gal. 6. 7. Ia. 3. 18. Iam. 5. 7. 8. hee hath cast into the earth, if the earth be not barren and vnfruit∣ful, and vnable to restore the like againe: euen so it happeneth to man, according as he practiseth and enterpriseth. And as the la∣bourer which hath sowne good seede, tarieth patiently, til the time of haruest come, so they which doe wel, ought patiently to attend their rewarde. And as the euil sower cannot looke for any thing but that which is of no value: so although the wicked tarie and at∣tende, yet they shal perceiue that their seed is nothing woorth. If they haue vsed wickednes, either against God, or the holie Ghost, by idolatries and blasphemie, by despising al religion, and scorning the word, or haue vexed and greeued their neighbours, to oppresse and ouerthrowe them, by backbiting and false reportes, by lawing, or suttle meanes, by iniuries, and wronges, by weapons, and other vio∣lencies. If they sowe (I say) suche wickednesse, although the pu∣nishment be slacke, according to mans opinion, yet they shal receiue Psalm. 7. 15. their reward, as Dauid sheweth it plainly by other similitudes then of the sower. Solomon to signifie such recompence vseth a similitude of the sower, saying, Hee that soweth wickednes, &c. He threate∣neth here principally the wicked, which practise against their neigh∣bours, fraude and deceite, rauine, and extortion, inhumanitie,
crueltie and tyrannie, and seeke by al meanes they can, to destroy and ouerthrowe them, in great anger and fury. He signifieth it, whē he saith, And the rod of his anger, &c. By the rod of anger hee sheweth that the wicked are much enflamed to persecute the innocent by malice, as Dauid doeth also: And as hath beene, and is seene yet by experience. And by and by he sheweth that the wicked which so we Psalm. 10. 2. wickednesse, are much hardened and obstinate in the same, when they cease not to persecute the innocent with rage, vntil such tyme as they reape the rewarde of their pursute: to wit, affliction, which maketh an end of their wickednes, and causeth the rod of their an∣ger to faile. As may bee seene (amongst others) in Pharao & Saule. Moreouer hee giueth heere consolation to them, which endure the malice of the wicked: for although according to mans iudgement it seemeth that they wil neuer cease to sow wickednes, in afflicting & persecuting the innocent, because at al times one hath seene, and yet seeth, that the wicked, which are an infinite number in respect of the good and iust, haue so done, and doe yet stil. Neuerthelesse it will come to passe that their wickednesse shal take ende. As Da∣uid prayeth. And that the good and righteous shalbe in safetie Psalm. 7. 10. and rest. 9 The good eye shalbe blessed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore. Wee couet greatly that al things bee well with vs, that wee liue in peace and quietnesse, and that al thinges which belong to vs goe wel, and that hauing prosperitie, we increase and growe vp therein, so that nothing faile vs. The carnal worldlings which are couetous, to obtaine such desires, are very careful, and greedy to get a greate heape of riches and to keepe it with al diligence: and regarde not willingly them whome they thinke to bee needie, and to haue oc∣casion to vse their aide. For they thinke verily, that their riches wil diminish, if they shoulde aide therewith the poore, and needie, and cannot see that the others doe their businesse: so enuious, and afraide they are, neuer to haue ynough.
Now that which they feare, shal happen to them, although for a season it seeme that they florish and prospet: for as with an euil eye, ful of hate, enuie, inhumanitie, and crueltie, without al pitie, and compassion they beholde the poore, disdaine them, and draw backe as much as they can from them: so God wil beholde them with the like eie, making thē most miserable, which if it be not in this world, yet at the last they shall perceiue it in hel. But as we woulde gladly that in our indigence, whatsoeuer it bee, our neighbours should be∣holde vs with a good eye, and shoulde vse liberalitie towardes vs. So it behoueth vs to beholde with a good eie our neighbors, which haue neede of our aide in helping their necessitie according to our abilitie. Thus doing wee shal haue want of nothing: but shall abounde in al wealth, as Solomon promiseth saying, The good eie, &c. Saint Paule is conformable in this pro∣mise. This is not to say that our eye is so good, or that we may giue 2. Cor. 9.  so much of our goods that by our liberalitie wee may merite bene∣diction: for wee cannot obteine it but by grace, and because the Lorde hath made vs a promise thereof, whereto wee wholy trust. Also wee are neuer so liberal, that wee giue any thing which is pro∣perly our owne, seing that the earth, and al that is conteined there∣in is the Lordes, &c. And that which wee giue, is not any thing, wherof we ought to make great account, as Solomon sheweth wel, Psal. 24. 1. when hee calleth it bread, which is the most common meate and of least price, that wee ordinarily vse. Neuerthelesse, when God which cannot bee bounde to any body, blesseth him which with a good & liberal eie beholding the needie, giueth him bread, that is to say, of his goods, which serue to susteine this life, it is most meete that hee which receiueth the good turne, bee not vnthankeful towardes the Lordes stewarde, but that hee honour him, as the organ and In∣strument, by the which God hath giuen him of his goods at his neede. But it is not meete, that hee which giueth, should desire any regratulation, for he ought to content himselfe with the blessing of Pro. 10. 22. the Lorde, the which onely maketh a man riche. Also they to whom one giueth any thing for meere pittie, if the almes be not great, yet they ought not to despise it, but to receiue it with thankes gi∣uing. Moreouer, note we, that if wee ought with a good eie to distri∣bute
our goods to the needie, that it behooueth vs not to bee an∣grie if another doe the like: to the ende wee resemble not him to whome it is saide, My freende, I doe thee no wrong, &c. Is it not Mat. 20. 13. lawful for mee to doe what I wil with mine owne goods? 10 Driue out the scornefull man, and debate shall goe out with him, yea variance and slaunder shal ceasse. It is an ordinary thing (as may bee seene) that the courtes and houses of kinges and princes are full of hate, enuie, pride, and am∣bition. There is almost none which is content with his calling, but euery one aspireth to a more higher estate. Some to honour and glory, some to riches, credite, and power, and striue to exalte themselues one aboue another. Whereof proceede debates, dissen∣tion, quarrelling, wordes of defame and slaunder, which are stirred vp, and mainteined by the scorneful who haue no reuerence of God nor of his worde, and beare no loue nor duetie to their kinges and princes nor to the prosperitie of their realmes, & by decreed malice, seeke to set al in trouble and confusion, and delight to work oppres∣sion, & violence to their neighbours, and to dishonour and diffame them, and care not for any thing but for their owne particular pro∣fite, and to come to the ende of their enterprises by the harmes of others, yea presuming to incite, and prouoke princes one against an other. And so they fil the worlde with strife, quarrels, and slaun∣der: whervpon ensueth the destructiō of many people, & the ruine likewise of kinges and princes. Wherefore in so much as kinges and princes loue to mainteine themselues, and their subiectes, and too florish and prosper, let them be careful to roote out such scorners as Solomon counselleth them, saying, Driue out the scorneful man, &c, And to doe this wel, let them determine with Dauid, I wil walke in the right way, &c. This sentence may be applied to euery one of vs, to teache vs to flie from Psal. 101. 2. the scorneful, and al contemners of God, and of his word, and not to conforme ourselues in any point with them, as also S. Paul tea∣cheth vs in diuers places. But it is principally belonging to kings and
princes, to make this horrible riddance, to the ende men may liue more surely, and out of strife, quarrelling and slaunder. 11 The king is his freende that loueth cleannesse of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes. One may maruel why Solomon speaketh so of kinges, seeing it is dayly proued, that they make their chiefe minions, familiars, and darlings commonly of whoremaisters and ribaulds, of flatterers, fooles, and backebiters, of talebearers, theeues, and rouers, of rashe and ouer hastie persons, of the ambitious and arrogant, of drun∣kardes and gluttons, of strife makers, seditious persons, and moo∣uers of al mischiefe. Al such men by their feates, deedes and words, shewe cleare enough that their heartes are foule and filthie, stinking and infected, and that they wil neuer be otherwise. And so they loue not the cleannesse of heart, but one may ceasse his meruelling, when he shal vnderstand that Solomon speaketh not of worldly & carnal Deut. 17. 15 Psal. 2. 10. kings, Superstitious, and idolaters, ignorant and vnfaithful: but hee speaketh of them which are truely instructed in the law, & doctrine of God, according as hee commandeth it, and as Dauid warneth them. Such kinges doe abhorre the wicked, and dispatch the lande of them as much as they can: and contrariwise they loue the men of a good and a sounde conscience, as Solomon signifieth by him which loueth cleannesse of hearte, the which consisteth in the true purenesse of faith, and charitie not feigned, in repentance and feare of the Lorde. Although such cleannesse be knowne onely of God, which soundeth the heartes, & proueth the reines, yet neuer∣thelesse it manifesteth it selfe, for of the abundance of the hearte the mouth speaketh. And the good man from the good treasure of Mat. 12. 34. his hearte, draweth foorth good thinges: for this cause Solomon saith, That it is for the grace of his lips, that the king is his freende that loueth cleannesse of heart, hee calleth the grace of the lippes, wordes of trueth, good and profitable, which tend to the glory and honour of God, and the edification of our neighbours. By suche grace kinges knowe what men they ought to choose for the go∣uernment of their subiectes, what teachers they ought to heare, and what kinde of men they ought most to assist and fauour.
It is very necessary that we haue al this grace in our lips: but princi∣pally the Ministers of the worde, and iudges of the earth, to execute their charge, and administration wel. Thus doing we shalbe loued, not onely of kinges and princes of the earth, which are wel instru∣cted in the worde, but also of the king and ruler of heauen and of earth. And as it is so, that al kings and superious of the earth ought to bee wel instructed in the worde of the Lorde, and to walke in his feare: one may say wel, that Solomon speaketh not heere of that which kings do, but of that which they ought to do. And so cōman∣deth almost al the kings of the earth: for there are very few that are their freendes which loue cleannesse of hearte, but rather hate them and persecute them. Insomuch that if God did not defende the pure and cleane of hearte, they shoulde bee often tempted to giue themselues to filth and infamie, to shun the hate of kinges, and too escape their persecutions. Nowe when there is none of vs, but hee desireth to bee belo∣ued of superiours, let vs vnderstande that wee are heere counselled to cleanse our heartes, to the ende wee may haue gratious and plea∣santlippes. Vnder the which wee may heere comprehende not one∣ly wordes, but also al workes and deedes which shewe an inwarde cleannesse: for to shunne prolixitie, Solomon hath named but the lippes. And also it woulde bee a thing of nothing, and worthie of condemnation, if wee vsed good woordes, and that our works were not conformable thereto. Let vs folowe therefore that which is taught vs. Washe yourselues therefore, and be cleanly, take away Esay. 1. 16. 17 Iam. 4. 8. the filthinesse of your workes from before mine eies. But what admonitiō soeuer is made vs, it lieth not in vs to obey it, neither can wee purifie our heartes ourselues, there is naught but the blood of Christ Iesus that purifieth vs, when wee drinke it by faith, and that by the holy Ghost, our consciences bee watered therewith too sanctifie vs, and make vs obedient to the worde: wherefore wee had neede to pray, Washe mee wel from mine iniquitie, & cleanse Psal. 51. 4 mee from my sinne. 12 The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the transgres∣sour.
If we desire greatly to haue grace in our lips, to be acceptable to our kings and princes of the earth, by a stronger reason wee ought stil to striue, to please the almightie which is King of Kings, & seeth not only the lips, but also al thoughts and deliberations be they ne∣uer so deepe, al enterprises and attemptes bee they neuer so hid∣den. Nowe although al the world knowe not that GOD is so cleere of sight, or that he printeth it not in his thought, yet neuer∣thelesse there is none, but he naturally vnderstandeth, that hee is a God, who ought to bee serued and pleased. As one may see, when there is no people so rude and barbarous, which hath not some reli∣gion and some ceremonies, by the obseruation of the which he ma∣keth profession of his wil to serue God. And so hee hath the zeale of God, but this is not to say that hee pleaseth God. For the zeale almost of al men is without knowledge, wheretoo onely the Lorde hath regard. As Solomon pronounceth saying, The eies of the Lorde haue regard to knowledge. This is not the knowledge of the wise and prudent of this world which is but vanitie: but this is the knowledge by the which we are assured that God is our father, & that he loueth vs, & wil saue vs, by the which also we know so his wil, that we haue no greater desire but to obay him according as he commandeth. This is the knowledge wheretoo the eies of the Lord haue regarde. This pleaseth him so, that hee de∣mandeth al thinges to bee done by the same: hee approoueth that which proceedeth from the same, and maintaineth and preserueth them which walke according to the same. Solomon vnderstandeth it so, as he sheweth by the Antithesis, saying, but he ouerthroweth, &c. When he putteth ouerthrowing against to haue regarde, hee giueth wel to vnderstand, that God accepteth, alloweth, and preser∣ueth the knowledge, whereunto his eies haue regard. Contrari∣wise that he hateth and disdaineth the woordes of the vnfaythful, who are rebels to him, seing he ouerthroweth their wordes. And when he putteth The wordes of the transgressour, a contrary to knowledge, hee giueth wel to vnderstand that this knowledge is no other thing but the worde of trueth, of iustice, and equitie, the which is so imprinted in the hart of man, that he assureth himself of the bountie of God, and demandeth nothing sooner then to obay him. Contrariwise, the wordes of the transgressour are al purposes,
counsels, determinations, and enterprises of those which despyse this knowledge, and let themselues be caried away by their carnal affections, and disordinate appetites to folow the wisedome of the worlde, as also their deceites and malices. Suche wordes or such do∣ings please not, nor cannot please God: and therfore he ouerthrow∣eth them, and bringeth them to nothing, and deceiueth the trans∣gressours Esai. 8. 9. 10. & 19. 3. & 30. 1. Iob. 21. 14. 15. Esai. 2. 3. of their intents and enterprises, as he doth threaten them. Therefore let vs not be of the number of them which say to God, de∣part from vs, for we wil not know thy waies, &c. But that we inuite one an other, saying, Come, let vs ascēd to the hil of the Lord, he wil teach vs his wayes, &c. And albeit this knowledge, & al they which keepe it, haue many enimies, which craue but their decaie, yet ne∣uerthelesse, they cannot preuaile against them, for the Lord of hosts, hath a care ouer thē, he keepeth them, & defendeth thē, as Solomon signifieth by the eyes of the Lord, which haue regard to knowledge. Also although the wicked, which are enemies to the church of God, wherin only is knowledge (as the Pope is, and al his adherents, ene∣mies of trueth) vse many wordes, and verie terrible, although they determine and consult to mainteine themselues, & seeke & practise to destroy the faithful: Yet neuerthelesse, let vs take heede not to re∣nounce the true knowledge, knowing that God hath a care ouer vs, and that he wil not suffer his enemies to obtaine their desires, but wil ouerturne al their enterprises, & destroy them. And so the prea∣ching of the pure trueth shal obtaine victorie and bee permanent, whereas contrariwise, the aduersaries shal perishe. 13 The slouthful bodie saith, there is a Lion without: I shalbe slaine in the streete. One may wonder at Solomon, that so often, & in so sundry ma∣ners, speaketh of the slouthful: but the cause wel vnderstoode, one ought not much to wonder, for the number of the slouthful is great, and what admonition soeuer is giuen them, yet they become not a whit more diligēt. Also there are many which esteeme not thēselues slouthful, because it seemeth to them, that they haue good occasion to desist from their duetie. They persuade thēselues, that they haue good wil to be employed, but there are many difficulties which will
not permit them. Solomon signifieth these difficulties by the Lion, which is without, which spareth not thē which are weake, but kil∣leth them, and this is to mocke the slouthful withal. Therfore if we wil not be mocked, let vs beware we cōceiue no feare, by the which we may desist from doing our duetie. For it is meete that we be re∣solute & assured, that if we walke according as God hath comman∣ded vs by his word, that he wil sooner send his Angels, then he wil suffer vs to fal, or to perish without remedy. The faithful endure ma∣ny Psal. 91. 11 afflictions, yea, to the losse of life by the violēce, & crueltie of Li∣ons, infidels, and idolaters, but they perish not: for their persecutors haue no power ouer the soule. Whē therfore it is needful to do our endeuour, wee tempt not God, if in folowing his ordinance we de∣spise, & feare not the temporal dangers which are offered: for to tēpt God is, when without his word, we assay extraordinarie matters, & put ourselues in euident perils. Iesus Christ sheweth vs both twoo: first, when he did not cast himself down headlong: as the deuil tēpted him to doe. Secondly, when he feared not to ascend into Ierusalem, Mat. 4. 5. & 20. 17. Act. 1. 4. knowing that he should be deliuered into the hāds of the Scribes & Pharisees, & to be put to death. The Apostles went not out of Ieru∣salem, because they were so commanded: But when they were filled with the holie Ghost, they went from Ierusalem throughout al the world, not fearing any Lions, for they are commanded so. Beholde, Act. 1. 8. Dan. 6. 16. Daniel feared to disobey God, & the Lions did him no harme at al. If therfore it be needful to expose ourselues to dāgers according to the word of the Lord: let vs not feare Lions, let vs not say, The Li∣on is without, &c. But let vs assure ourselues of the promise that God maketh to the faithful, Thou shalt go vpon the Lion & Adder, the young Lyon and the dragon shalt thou treade vnder thy feete. Psal. 91. 13. Note we moreouer that the slouthful are are not onely they which do nothing, but also they which for feare of dangers, perfourme not their duetie, although they apply themselues to other works, which seeme to be excellent. As amongest the rest, they which couer them¦selues Iohn. 3. 2. with Nicodemus deede, who came by night to Iesus Christ. Monkes and Friers persuade themselues that they labor wel in their diuine seruice, but they are not only slouthful, but also theeues, rob∣bers and murtherers, whereby they deserue wel to haue pouertie, and to be hanged and executed in hel.
14 The mouth of strange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein. Wee haue bene amply admonished to keepe ourselues from whoredome, and the dangers haue beene shewed vs, wherein they Pro. 2. 16. & 5. 3. & 7. 5. fal that are whoremongers, and whores. Neuerthelesse Solomon contenteth not himselfe: neither (seeing whoredome is so common a thing) we cannot haue too many aduertisementes, as wel to turne the heartes of them, that wil be taught, as to make the incorrectible more guiltie, and inexcusable. Therefore to shewe vs, what daun∣ger it is to consent to whoremongers, and whores, hee compareth the mouth, that is to say, the speech, pleasant talke, flatteries, and enticements of strange women, that is to say, of whores, to a deepe pit. Wherein he signifieth, that as a beast which is hunted, if hee fal into the pit which is prepared for him, can neuer get out againe, because the pit is very deepe, but must therelye and perish. Euen so they which leade their eare to consent to whooredome, goe to perdition: and principally if God by his iust anger chace or hunt them thither, as Solomon signifieth wel saying, Hee whome the Lorde is angry withal, falleth therein. Which is to say that God being angry with any one for his sinnes, maketh him to fal in∣to whoredome, to the end to punish him the more rigourously, & so he punisheth sinnes by other sinnes. As also Saint Paule sheweth well. Rom. 1. 14 Let vs learne therefore when whooredomes are rife, that the Lorde is angry, and that he is greatly offended for their misdeedes, to the ende we may be careful to keepe ourselues from committing any iniquities, for feare least the Lorde giue vs ouer to whoredome, and we deserue horrible punishment. Let vs take heede we flee from pompe and delight, brauerie and pride, ease, & ydlenes, gluttonie, & drunkennes. For such sinnes the Lord was angry against Sodome, Gen. 19. 24 Exe. 16. 49. 15. and Gomorra, and gaue them ouer to whoredome, yea to filthines and abhominable infamie quite against nature, and finally destroied them vtterly.
15 Foolishnesse is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him. Solomon hath tolde fathers and mothers, that if they loue their children wel, they should not spare the rodde. And it is not with∣out Pro. 13. 24. cause that hee hath made suche mention: for it is verie neces∣sarie for children to bee chastized, otherwise they are lost for euer: Seeing that as Solomon saieth, Foolishnesse is bounde in the heart of a childe. Which is to say, that naturally children are so corrupt, that they haue al their affec∣tions set on malice and wickednesse, on disobedience and rebellion, on dissolutions, and insolencies, on derision, and despising of God, of his worde, and of al religion. Dauid confesseth as muche of him¦selfe: wherupon foloweth ruine and perdition as hath bene seene. And because Solomon knewe wel that fathers and mothers, did not desire that their children shoulde goe to destruction, but ra∣ther that they were preserued: therefore hee teacheth them howe they shal vnbinde this follie from the heart, when hee saith, But the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him. Although the Psal. 51. 7. Pro. 1. 24. rodde wherewith one beateth children, be verie profitable, and ve∣rie necessarie to bring them in awe, and bridle them from many dis∣solute and loose deedes: yet neuerthelesse the best correction to vnlose the follie from the heart, & to driue it away from the childe, is, by the worde of the Lord, to exhort him, to shewe him the way, and to threaten him. Saint Paule sheweth it wel. Magistrates, are here aduertised of their duetie, and also we are al aduertised to mor∣tifie Ephe. 6. 4. Col. 3. 21. our fleshe, and to repent. 15 Who so doeth the poore man woong, to encrease his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie. We feare naturally pouertie, which to eschue, we striue to heape goods vpon goods. Which thing is verie hard to do, except by rob∣bing others, and principally the poore, who haue no power to de∣fende themselues, and by seeking by giftes and presentes to obtaine
the fauour of the riche. And therefore the custome and vse of them which wil waxe riche, is to worke oppression and violence to the poore, and giue to the riche. But they deceiue themselues: for as Solomon saieth, Who so doeth the poore man wrong, &c. he cer∣teinly goeth to pouertie. For that which hee rauisheth and taketh away from the poore man, can be of no great value, but in regarde that the litle which the iust man possesseth, is to him a great thing, and that hee is content with it, and it is more woorth to him then great treasures to the wicked. And although the wicked can take no great substance from the poore man: yet neuerthelesse to main∣teine and keepe himselfe in the fauour of the riche man, it behoo∣ueth him to giue great giftes, otherwise hee shal not bee welcome, and the riche man wil despise him. If therefore hee take away but a litle, and giue muche, hee must of force come to necessitie. Moreouer Solomon hath saide, Hee that doeth a poore man wrong, dishonoureth him that made him. Whereby hee deser∣ueth Pro. 14. 31 wel to haue indigence: for he not onely dishonoureth a mor∣tal man, but also him, that giueth abundantly al things to our vse. If the pouertie appeare not in this life, the wicked shal feele it at the vttermost, in death euerlasting. Then shalbe accomplished wholy: See heere, my seruauntes shal eate, but you shal haue hunger, See heere, my seruantes shal drinke, but you shal haue thirst, &c. Esai. 65. 13 Luk. 6. 24. 17 Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wise: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine. There is none, but he woulde willingly be thought the faith∣ful seruaunt of God: and to keepe themselues in that reputation, many wil be careful to obserue auntient customes, and to hold the doctrines of men, and to folowe the inuentions of the Deuil, which beare any faire shew: or wil giue themselues to liue after their good meaning, and phansie of their owne heades, and take great paine about suche trumperie, and woulde haue God to take it in good parte, yea, and to bee bounde to them: for they are so much abu∣sed,
that they persuade themselues, that there come great merites by the obseruing of suche follies and abhomination. Of the which number are the poore Papistes, and al those that are giuen to their owne senses: but to serue God wel, it behooueth vs to applye our senses, exteriour and interiour to the worde of the Lorde, and sub∣mit ourselues his schollers and disciples, as hee hath alreadie of∣ten Pro. 2. 1. & 3. 1. & 4. 1. inuited vs by Solomon. And againe nowe, when hee saith, Bowe downe thine eare, &c. Wherein he sheweth, that the ad∣ministration of the word is verie necessarie for vs, & that we ought to be subiect to the same, as also the Apostle sheweth it. For this occasion Iesus Christ himselfe gaue some Apostles, some Prophets, others Euangelistes, and others Pastours and Doctours, &c. Eph. 4. 11 Hebr. 13. 17 These are the wisemen whereof our Lorde speaketh: whose words wee ought to heare, the which are truely the words of Iesus Christ, who is maister and doctour of the wise: for hee that heareth the the ministers of the trueth, he heareth Iesus Christ, and it is he that we ought to heare according to the commandement of God his fa∣ther & we ought to heare him, to yeelde him obedience with hart, as Solomon sheweth in saying, And apply thy hart to my doctrine, for wise men are giuen vs to the end that by hearing them, we may become wise, which cannot be do one, but by beleeuing their words and putting them in practise, as Iesus Christ declareth. Note wee Mat. 17. 5 Mat. 17. 5 Mat. 7. 24 moreouer, that those men are wise, which by their words doe open vs the knowledge of God, and of Iesus Christ. These are they that we ought to heare, and not the Pope and his adherents, which are but fooles, mockers, seducers and murderers of the soules of the simple, which haue them in admiration. Note wee also when Solo∣mon demandeth the appliyng of the hearte to doctrine, that he she∣weth vs, that it is not meete that wee remaine blinde, and ignorant, nor that we be dumbe and idle: for if the heart be truely giuen too doctrine we shal see & know that, which we haue to beleeue & do, to serue God and our neighbours, and of the abundance of the hart, our mouthes wil sounde out praises, praiers, and thankes giuing: And our members wil apply themselues to the seruice of our neigh∣bours, for such also is the ende of the preaching of the worde, that being wel instructed, we bring foorth good fruites.
18 For it wil be a pleasant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes. We loue to haue ioye, pleasure, mirth and delectation: but because of the corruption of our nature we are ignorant, and bloc∣kishe, and haue not the wit to knowe whereto wee ought to giue ourselues, to obtaine the enioying of true delight, and so wee had neede to be taught. Otherwise al our pleasures and delightes are in vanitie and follie, in filth and wickednesse, and in al thinges which are to the appetite of our sensualitie. For this cause, Solomon to withdrawe vs from the lustes of the fleshe, hath willed vs to giue eare to the wordes of the wise, to the end wee might bee instructed and that knowledge might pearce to the depth of our hearts. Hee knewe that the children of God coulde not bee better reioyced, then by the worde of the Lorde: for it surmounteth al worldly pleasures, in them which truely take any smacke therein, and sucke, and swalowe it into their heartes. Also Solomon thought it a great ioy and pleasure, to apply the hearte to the wordes of the wise, and to doctrine, which is, the worde of the Lorde, seeing to yeelde a re∣son of the former inuitation, to wit, bowe downe thine eare, &c. hee saith, for it wil bee a pleasant thing, &c. Heere hee sheweth that which proceedeth necessarily of the true hearing of the wordes of the wise, and applying of the heart to knowledge, & saith, that it is a thing very pleasant, sweete, faire, and delectable. Which coulde not be, if one tooke not pleasure in the former: for one cannot con∣tinewe in a thing wherein hee taketh no delight, and if for a certain season hee reioyce therein, it is to no purpose. As is soone seene when he is easilie turned therefrom. Therefore Solomon speaketh of continuance when hee maketh mention Of keeping it in the belly, and ordering the lips: and couertly he requireth that wee re∣semble not the seede, cast in the hye way on stony grounde or a∣mongst thornes. But that we receiue the seede in good earth, which bringeth foorth frutes, which consist in the fayth and confession of the same principally. As one may gather it by S. Paul, Solomon mar∣keth fayth (which is not without repentance) saying, Rom. 10. 9. 10.
If thou keepe them in thy belly. For wee cannot assure ourselues indeede, that God loueth vs, for the loue of Iesus Christ which di∣ed for our sinnes, if wee be not sorowful because of the same, and desire not to be deliuered therefro, and take delight in that which God commaundeth vs. Beholde heere howe wee ought to keepe the wordes of the wise, and the doctrine in our bellies, that is to say, within our heartes. Hee marketh confession or profession, which is but vanitie and follie, if it bee not ioyned with the good woorkes which God commaundeth vs. Our Lorde Iesus sheweth it wel, Hee marketh (I say) this confession, saying, And if thou Mat. 7. 21. order them together in thy lippes. Hee saieth, together. For it is not meere, that wee make confession by halfes, nor that we choose out some of those workes, which God commandeth vs, and omit the rest. But wee ought to giue al our vnderstanding to that seruice which God asketh of vs, and striue with ourselues to yeelde him whole obedience. Wee see then, that hauing heard the woordes of the wise, and applyed our heartes to doctrine, wee ought to take pleasure in fayth and repentance, in confession, and the works which folowe thereof. And thus dooing, wee shal attaine to that, which the Prophetes speake of the beautie of Iesus Christ, and his king∣dome. Psal. 45. 3. Esai. 52. 7. Psal. 37. 4. 5. If wee take suche pleasure to keepe the wordes of the wise in our bellie, God also wil take pleasure to fulfil our desires. 19 That thou mayest put thy trust in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderstande to daye, euen to thee. Those which heare not, nor make no account, to giue them∣selues to that which is alreadie taught thē in the former verses, 17. & 18. walke in this worlde at haphazarde, and knowe not what shalbecome of them: as wee ourselues haue felt when wee were Papistes: and so they be blinde, and know not to whom to adresse themselues, to bee assured of their saluation, but are in continuall trembling. And chiefly when they deeme themselues neere tem∣poral death, for they knowe not whether they goe, and expect ra∣ther decaie then safetie. If wee wil not walke in suche vncertein∣tie,
let vs take good heede, not to despise the doctrine which wee haue heard in the two former verses: for it is giuen vs to make vs verie wise and skilful, and to the ende wee shoulde not be afraide of what affliction soeuer happen vs, or is seene neere and immi∣nent: but that wee bee assured that the Lorde loueth vs, and that hee hath care ouer vs, and wil defende, garde, and deliuer vs from al afflictions, and that by his meanes wee shal neuer perishe, but hee wil saue vs eternally. Solomon affirmeth it so, when he saith, That thou mayest put thy trust in the Lorde, &c. The ende therefore of the doctrine which is spoken to vs, is, that we be wa∣rie, and that the doctrine pearce euen into our heartes, not to rest there by opinion, as doeth a profane or worldly historie: But to the ende wee may learne to knowe, and assure ourselues that God loueth vs, and that hee wil neuer suffer vs to perishe, but wil saue vs for euer, giuing vs a blessed life in the glorie of heauen. Solomon propoundeth vs this Theologie, To day, that is to say, when wee haue time to heare it, and applye our heartes theretoo, which is al the time of our life, the which wee ought to imploye, to meditate the doctrine of our God, and to exercise ourselues in the same, day and night, and principally, when wee haue the bookes of the ho∣lie scriptures, and faithful and true Doctours, which busie them∣selues to make vs vnderstande the same. We ought not to be neg∣ligent and slowe, but prompt, and readie to heare and vnderstand, to the ende, to beleeue by certeine knowledge and assurance which may bee wel rooted in our heartes, and not to submit ourselues to the fayth of others: as those which delight in their ignoraunce, and say, that they beleeue that which the Church beleeueth. For God by his doctrine speaketh to euerie one of vs, and wil that eue∣rie one receiue it, to beleeue therein, and walke according to the same. Solomō sheweth it wel, when he is not content to say, I haue giuen thee to vnderstand: But hee addeth, Euen to thee. Or also, thou, receiue the woordes of the wise, and doctrine. So none can vaunt himselfe indeede to be faithful, vnlesse hee be also skilful: for God speaking of his faithful, saieth, I wil giue thee vnderstanding, and wil teache thee the way, wherein thou shalt walke. Also, al thy children shalbe instructed of the Lorde. I wil plant my lawe Psal. 32. 89
in them, and write it in their heartes, &c: And wil sprinckle vpon you cleane water, and you shalbe clensed from al your crimes, &c. Esai. 54. 13 Iere. 31. 33 34. Eze. 36. 25 and wil cause that you shal keepe my appointmentes. Nowe that, To daye, is al the time of our life, yea, al the time wherein the word of God shalbee preached in the Church, it is manifest by the same, that wee ought to heare it, beleeue it, and obey it at al times. And although the Iewes be warned, To day if yee wil heare his voyce, harden not your heartes, &c. yet the Apostle teacheth vs, that the Psal. 95. 7. 8. Hebr. 3. 12 13. 14. Psalmist hath not onely spoken of them of his time, but also of vs. And seeing that Solomon by his doctrine, striueth to persuade vs, that wee put our trust in God, and that we cannot doe so, but by Iesus Christ, which is our Propitiatorie, and our Aduocate, it fo∣loweth, that hee sendeth vs to Iesus Christ, and wil that by the doc∣trine Rom. 3. 25. & 51. & 8. 34. of trueth, we learne to beleeue in him, to the ende that wee perish not, but haue life euerlasting. 20 Haue not I written to thee, three times in counsels and learning? To the ende we should not excuse ourselues, if we vnderstand not, howe wee ought to put our trust in the Lorde: the Lorde hath giuen vs diuersitie of scripture, as the bookes of Moyses the histo∣ries, and bookes of the Prophetes, wherein wee may learne to fo∣lowe the counsel of God, and to knowe the loue which he beareth to vs: and not content with this, he hath giuen vs, moreouer, di∣uers scriptures by his Apostles, and Euangelistes, to the ende wee may see more clearly the right way of al righteousnesse and iustice, of al holinesse, and religion, and that wee may contemplate more neerely the bountie of God, and his loue towards vs in Iesus Christ his Sonne, which is our assurance, and our saluation. And nowe againe, hee hath giuen his Church many Pastours, and Ministers of his worde, the which is preached purely to many nations, in diuers languages, and giueth vs the olde and newe Testament, translated faithfully into many tongues. And so he giueth vs counsels & lear∣ning, in sundry maners, as Solomon signifieth, by three times, put∣ting (according to the manner of the scripture) a number certaine, for the vncertaine.
If therefore wee be ignorant, dul, faithlesse, and doutful, it is our great fault, seeing that God hath giuen vs so many scriptures, and so many faithful expositours, which are careful and diligent to in∣instruct vs, which cease not to open their mouthes often, and to put their handes to the penne, to make vs the more wise and skil∣ful. Suche perseuerance is wel signified to vs, when Solomon saith, Haue not I written to thee? &c. Which thing hee speaketh in the person of God, or of the wakeful Doctours: And sheweth vs that it is not enough to haue care of the Lordes flocke for a certaine sea∣son, but that wee ought to continue. Also, that the people bee not vexed, if one cease not to propounde the scripture to them: and that one striue to print the worde of the Lorde so wel in his heart, that putting his trust in God, his continual delight be, to meditate this doctrine, to speake thereof, and to confirme his life thereafter, by good workes, and holie conuersation. For in as muche as we are enclined to contrarie thinges, and when we are taught, are slouth∣ful, and negligent, and easily goe out of the right way, which wee are entred into: For this cause it is verie needful that one write vnto vs three times: which is, that hee cease not to propound vn∣to vs the holie scriptures, which are replenished with counsels, and learning. 21 To the end, to giue thee to know the assurāce of the words of trueth, to answere wordes of veritie to them that sende to thee. It is not enough, that wee haue the holie Scriptures and faith∣ful expositours: but to the ende wee may make our profite there∣by, and doe good to our neighbours, wee ought to read the scrip∣tures, and heare the Doctours, to suche ende as God hath giuen them vs. Solomon sheweth vs the ende, saying, To the ende to giue thee to knowe the assurance of the wordes of trueth, &c. Wherein he declareth to vs, that the scripture and Doctors are giuen vs to haue a sure knowledge of the trueth, whereto Saint Paule agreeth. Moreouer, it is meete, that hauing so profited in this assuraunce Ephe. 4. 11. and certeintie, we knowe howe to render a reason of our Fayth, to them which shal desire to bee instructed by vs, or which wil im∣pugne the doctrine that wee haue learned.
Solomon wil haue it so, when he saieth, To answere, &c. Where∣to Saint Peter agreeth, saying, And be ye alwayes readie to answere euerie one, that demaundeth reason of the hope which is in you, 1. Pet. 3. 15 &c. The Apostle to the Hebrewes sheweth them wel, that one ought so to profite in the worde of trueth, that hee may be able to answere, when hee sayeth. For when as concerning the time, ye ought to be teachers, yet had you neede againe, that one teach you the first principles of the beginning of the worde of God, &c. And Hebr. 5. 1 if wee ought al so to profite in the worde of trueth, the Ministers aboue the rest, ought to be careful thereof, to the ende, to instruct the people in sound doctrine, and stoppe the mouthes of the aduer∣saries of the truth. As Saint Paule admonisheth them therof, chief∣ly when hee writeth to Timothie and to Titus. But although we ought to answere euerie one, yet this is not to say, that we may be al Doctours to haue publike charge, nor that wee ought to knowe (of force) howe to expounde the Scriptures point by point. It is enough for the simple sort to knowe that Iesus Christ is their Saui∣our, and that they be so confirmed therein, that the suttleest Doctors of the world, nor al the power of hel cannot withdraw them from the hope which they haue in God by Iesus Christ our sauiour. And as wee haue not to doe, to be so suttle, so it is not meete, that wee be ouer curious to enquire after that, which appertaineth not to the honour and glorie of God, nor to our saluation, nor to the edi∣fication of our neighbours. 22 Polle not the poore, because hee is poore: and oppresse not the afflicted at the gate. Solomon folowing the lawe and the Psalmes, hath alreadie often tolde vs of the poore, accusing and blaming them which doe them wrong. But because the worlde amendeth not, for any time that commeth, but rather waxeth woorse, and iniquitie encreaseth daily, as is seene by proofe: for this cause Solomon persisteth to ad∣monish vs of our duetie towardes the poore, saying, Polle not the poore, because he is poore, &c. In commanding this, hee first warneth Magistrates and Iudges of the earth to haue pitie and com∣passion
on the poore, and to yelde them presently the right that ap∣pertaineth to them, without suffering themselues to bee corrupted by giftes or brybes, by friends or parents, to peruert the iudgement, and doe wrong to him, who through his pouertie hath no succour at al. But because experience sheweth that at al times the world is replenished with wicked Kings, Princes, Magistrates, and iudges, which fauoure them whome they please, to oppresse and hurte the poore: and that rightly one may charge them that the spoyle of the poore is in their houses: wee ought also to vnderstande that So∣lomon accuseth them of oppression and vniustice, of great malice, and crueltie, for when they bee set at the gate where anciently they Esal. 3. 13. sate to do iustice: wheras for the pouertie & affliction of the need∣ful, they ought to bee moued to pitie and compassion, they take occasion, thereby to polle and oppresse them, against the duetie of their office, and against their consciences. And this is because they set not God before their eyes, nor haue no feare nor reue∣rence of his woorde, nor force not to bee blamed: For if one speake not according to their wil and pleasure they haue power: and ther∣fore they reuenge it presently. And so one prooueth in them, the trueth of the prouerbe which saith, That if one speake wel of prin∣ces hee lyeth: and if hee speake euil, they amende him. Secondly, by this commandement hee admonisheth euery one of vs, to beware that wee doe no hurte to our poore neigh∣bours, which are afflicted for lacke of goods or worldly succour: That wee doe them noe harme by disceyte nor violence, nor vnder shadowe of iustice. As they doe which by sutes in lawe, gnawe and eate vp the poore, or by any other subtil meanes: but the worlde is like to those great Mastife Dogges, who when they see any little curre that is poore and feeble, incontinently they runne vpon him, and all to byte him and teare him. Euen so by how much more one seeth a man feeble and weake, by so much the more he is readie to pille and polle him, and to doe him all the damage he can: whereas, for his pouertie and affliction, hee shoulde studie to doe him pleasure. And because what meanes soeuer is made to forbid these theeues & robbers these couetous catchpols and vsurers to doe so, and yet they bee not moued a whit more
to mercie, but harden themselues in their disordinate desires, in their crabbednesse and crueltie. Let vs vnderstande that this sen∣tence and others like it, serue for their accusation and condemna∣tion. Wherefore if wee wil not be accused nor condemned, as pol∣lers and oppressers of the poore, and afflicted: Let vs obey this sen∣tence or commandement, forsaking al couetousnesse, vsurie and ra∣pine, and al inhumanitie and crueltie, and finally, al fraude and de∣ceite: insomuch, that beeing mooued to pitie and compassion to∣wardes our poore neighbours, wee open our bowelles vnto them, in helping them according to our abilitie, and their neede. For see∣ing al goods appertaine to God, and that they which haue them, are stewardes to the Lorde, (or at least wise, ought to be) not one∣ly wee polle and oppresse the poore and afflicted, when we take to ourselues the substance which they possesse, but also when we dis∣daine to bestowe vpon them, the goods, which God hath giuen vs. And as (if wee doe so) we are without al mercie: so we shal haue finally a condemnation without al mercie. 23 For the Lord himselfe wil deale in their cause: and take away the soule of them which doe polle them. There is none, but being asked whether one should feare God or men more, wil not answere, God: And being asked, whether one ought to choose to be in Gods fauour, or mens rather, wil not an∣swere, in Gods. But wee prooue that the heart is not like to the mouth, and that one thinketh one thing, and saieth an other: seeing the euil dealing that one vseth to the poore, and the flatteries and faire shewes that one maketh to the riche, and also that one is more readie to please God then men, and feareth more to transgresse the ordinances of men, then the commandementes of God. Many feare Leuit. 19. 13 verse. 22. more to fal into the handes of men, then into Gods hands. If men make any decree, eche one wil take heede, to attempt the contrary: and yet they make no account to transgresse Gods lawes: hee saieth, Thou shalt not doe thy neighbour wrong, neyther robbe him. And by Solomon, Polle not the poore, &c. If earthly Iudges had made suche a decree, men woulde haue beene afraide to haue broken the same, for feare of purchasing
their displeasure, and beeing punished for the same: and chiefly if they should know that Iudges had poore men in remembrance. But for al the commandementes of God, and for al his threatenings, yet they cease not to polle the poore, and to oppresse the afflicted. For although with mouth they say, that God is the defendour and pro∣tectour of the poore, yet because they see ordinarily that the poore and afflicted are polled and oppressed, and that they which molest and trouble them, are most strong and prosper, they think that God hath no regarde to the affliction of the poore, to deliuer them and saue them: neither thinke they that the Lorde wil punishe them for the same. Yea, the poore themselues are tempted, to thinke and say, that God forgetteth and forsaketh them, because they see, that they which oppresse them are in prosperitie, which seemeth euer∣lasting, and that their afflictions haue no ende, as hath beene saide heretofore. But the oppressours, and those which are oppressed, thinke both verie yl. For seeing that God is a iust Iudge which se∣eth and knoweth al thinges, hee is, and wil be the protectour of the poore, and wil punishe them that oppresse them. Solomon she∣weth the decree and the protection, when he saith, For the Lord himselfe wil deale in their cause. And afterwardes their punish∣ments, saying, And wil take away the soule of them which polle them. This is as though he should say, The poore neither finde Atturnies, nor Counsellours, nor Iudges for themselues, be∣cause they haue not wherewith to furnishe out the matter withal. Men polle them, and gnawe them euen to the bone. Insomuche that they haue not wherewithal to defende themselues, and it see∣meth that they are lost and cast away, and that they shal neuer re∣couer themselues: yet neuerthelesse they ought not to loose cou∣rage, nor to dispaire: for God, which is iust & merciful, and of more might then al the rest, wil pleade for them, and doe iustice in their cause against the rauishers and oppressours, whose goods hee wil not onely take away, but also their liues, and wil destroye them for euer. Saint Paule accordeth heretoo. For let vs not thinke other∣wise, but that Solomon speaketh namely of the poore which haue 2. Tim. 1. 6. 7 the feare of the Lord, and that for loue of the same, are afflicted of the enemies of trueth. Also God is not the protectour of the Infidels, bee they neuer so poore, and afflicted, but rather sendeth
them miserie vppon miserie, and addeth torments to torments, vn∣till such time as he hath wholy destroyed them. And therefore we may wel say, that in the 22. verse he forbiddeth the wicked to afflict the poore faythful flocke, for it is of them that he hath care, as wee ought to vnderstand by fayth and to assure ourselues thereof, be∣cause wee knowe that God is true in his promises. 24 Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious. Seeing wee are called to peace, it is meete that we seeke and follow peace, as we are all admonished to doe. Also wee naturally loue peace, if we be not senseles, enraged & inspired with the diuel, Wherefore to the end that we may follow our vocation, and that wee be not frustrate of that which we loue, let vs haue no acquain∣tance with them which are voyde of grace, gentlenes, benignitie, modestie, temperance, humble minde, and patience, and are repleni∣shed, with pride, crueltie, yre indignation, and wickednes, Solomon sheweth that we should doe so, when he sayth, Accompanie not with an angry wilfull man. &c. With them that are of that qualitie we can haue nothing but strife and debate. For eyther they are angry with vs, or else they prouoke vs to anger against them, through their too greate yre and fury, whereby they are transported to do vs iniurie and violence, because we doe not as please thē. Such is the nature of anger and fury: as Abel hath Gen. 4 prooued it, Ioseph, Moses, Dauid, and Iesus Christ, and nowe the poore faythful flocke: Or els we learne also to be angry and wrath∣ful, wherevpon ensueth our destruction, as Solomon sheweth vs when he sayth. 25 Least thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy soule. For twoo causes amongest the rest hurte is due too the yreful and furious man, and to him that learneth his wayes. The one is, Pro. 14. 17 Pro. 1. 7. 22. 15. 18. because he committeth folly, and so is incorrigible, and mocker and contemner of al correction and counsell, Whereof wisedome
complaineth, The other is, that hee maketh debates, whereby he procureth the decay of his neighbours, wherby hee deserueth wel to hurt himselfe. Neuerthelesse this is not to say that it is not law∣ful to bee angrie sometimes, prouided that it bee iustly, and tempe∣rately, as Saint Paule sheweth, otherwise anger is not lawful, for it Rom. 13. 4. Eph. 4. 26. 31 Ia. 1. 19. 20. Gal. 5. 20 is one of the workes of the fleshe. 26 Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are sureties for debts. This matter hath beene spoken of, and amongst other things it hath beene saide that Solomon seeketh not to withdrawe vs from Pro. 6. 1. 11. 15 doing pleasure and seruice to our neighbours, whom wee knowe to bee in necessitie: but hee wil not, that for the liberalitie which we vse towardes our neighbours to solace and helpe them, wee our¦selues shoulde come into pouertie and neede, he sheweth this now himselfe, wen he saith: 27 Why wilt thou put thy selfe in this danger? for if thou hast not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee. Saint Paul is agreeable heereto. Now the manner of aiding our neighbours ought to be, that as wee should be content with things present, so we should also helpe them with that which wee haue in hand, and can wel spare, and with good wil: for wee knowe not if in time to come we shalbe able to satisfie them whome we are pledge vnto, and yet neuerthelesse in giuing our worde, wee vowe to saue them harmelesse in the time to come for whome wee are suretie: which is to do God iniurie, to whom onely it belongeth to dispence of things future: and as Solomon saith, we put ourselues in danger of pouertie and to haue that thing taken from vs which is most ne∣cessary to vs, which is signified by the bed. 28 Thou shalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue set.
Seeing it is commanded, Thou shalt not remoue thy neighbors marke, which they of olde time haue set in thine inheritance: And acurse is pronounced for him which remooueth the marke of his Deut. 19. 14 & 17. 17 neighbour: It might seeme that Solomon needed not to put this sentence in writing, which conteineth nothing els but that which hath been saide by Moses, but because wee are dul and sluggishe, we haue neede to bee waked by many messengers: also we are so giuen to the earth, that wee haue neuer enough of it. And if wee bee let a lone, we wil put other mens possessions to our owne, and vsurpe them to ourselues. And if wee dare not take al for feare of blame, and reprehension, at least wise in the absence of our neighbours, wee transport and shift the land markes somewhat further which were set and appointed time out of minde. And so wee steale and rob the possessions of our neighbours, and are accursed, as we haue heard by Moses: and also as Esay pronounceth saying, Cursed bee Esay. 5. 8. you that ioyne house vpon house, and land vpon lande, til there bee no more place left: wil you dwel alone vpon the earth? If wee wil bee free from this curse, we ought to be content with our iust patri∣mony, or with that which without disordinate desire we gain with our labour, or otherwise get with equitie. And if it bee not lawfull to transgresse that which our ancestours haue ordeined lawefully, touching temporal goods, which serue our bodies for this present life, much lesse it is lawful to transgresse that which the eternal (who is aboue al men) hath ordeined by his worde, for the health of our soules without adding or diminishing any thing. For as the children of Israel through their rebellion and disobedience, their smal trust misbeliefe, did wander in the desertes fortie yeeres, and there dyed, not comming to the limits which God had appointed them in the land of Canaan: So they which transgres the lawes of God, shalbe as Cain, fugitiues & rūnagates in this world, so that they shal not come to the kingdome of heauen, where out markes are pitched, from before the foundation of the worlde. We haue not to doe, to Allegorizate this sentence, and principally as the Doctours Sorbo∣nistes doe, which say, Transgresse not the boundes of the Catholike faith, which haue been ordeined from the beginning by the doctors of the Church, and other learned men, wherein they woulde not speake amisse, but woulde giue vs good doctrine, if by the doctours
of the Church they vnderstoode Moses, the Prophetes. Iesus Christ and his Apostles, who to make vs faithful, & obedieut, haue taught vs the onely worde of God, without passing their limittes, or decli∣ning either on the right side, or on the left. But these scholasticall doctours make heere a double fault: first when they thinke that So∣lomon hath spoken Allegorically heere, for seeing in this sentence (as wee haue seene) wee finde sounde and pure dectrine, conforma∣ble to the lawe and the Prophetes, and that Solomon speaketh not darkely, nor by similitude, wee haue no neede to search for Allego∣ries heere: for that woulde bee to darken, and corrupt the naturall sense of the sentence. Secondly, they faile in this, that by the fa∣thers, they vnderstand those which haue busied themselues to teach and write since the time of the Apostles, whether they haue giuen good doctrine or not. It is enough for them, that they may say, our fathers haue doone so, or saide so, not once regarding if they haue followed rightly the worde of the Lorde or no, for they bare more reuerence to men then to God, and to mans doctrine, then to the worde of the Lorde, as may bee seene clearely by the articles of the Diuines of Paris. 29 If thou hast seene a man diligent in his businesse: hee shall stande before kinges, and not among the simple people. Albeit the courtes and houses of kinges and princes, bee ordi∣narily stuffed with the negligent, slouthful, and idle persons: and as much they can, men driue out, and expel those which are careful and diligent to apply themselues to wel doing according to Gods commaundement: yet neuerthelesse wee wil not do Solomon so much as to reiect this present sentence: for he speaketh not of that which is doone amongest carnal and worldly kinges princes and superiours, although sometimes such men either for shame, or necessitie to the ende to echewe further damage, receiue into their courtes and houses, wary & diligent felowes, which wil apply their businesse, and followe their vocation faithfully: as Pharao receiued Ioseph, Saul Dauid, Nabuchodonozer Daniel: but he speaketh part∣ly of that which one ought to doe in a wel ordered common weale:
and sheweth kinges and greatmen of the earth what assistance they ought to haue in their courtes and houses, to deale in the affaires of their realme and countrey: and partly hee sheweth what honour they are worthie of with mē, that apply their busines faithfully and carefully, partly also he speaketh of the account, which one maketh of such personages. For if men see a felow very cūning in his science or doings, they say straightwaies that hee is worthie to serue a king, & that it is pitie that he remaineth in base estate: Although therfore that nowe kinges and great men of the earth, craue not muche the assistance and seruice of honest men, which are wakeful and wary to doe their businesse: this argueth not that this present sentence shold not be receiued, as true and excellent, seeing it instructeth kinges of their duetie. Also it sheweth that wee ought not to refuse great charges, neither ought wee to spare our diligence, when the Lorde hath giuen vs the grace to bee nimble and quicke in our businesse: for it is meete that euery one imploy himselfe according to the ta∣lent which hee hath receiued of the Lorde. Thus doing, wee shall not stande onely before kings of the earth, but also before the King of kinges, who wil say to euery one that hath well ministred, It is wel doone, good and faithful seruant, thou hast beene faithful ouer fewe things, I wil make thee ruler ouer many things: Enter thou in∣to Mat. 25. 21. the ioy of thy Lorde. The xxiii. Chapter. WHen thou shalt be set downe to eate with a great Lord, in considering, consider that which shall be set before thee. IT is an ordinary thing that the tables of kings and princes of great lordes and rulers are coue∣red with diuers sortes of meates, and with di∣uersitie of wines, and plentie, to shew their magnificence, and satisfie their appetite, and those which beare them company at the table. Insomuch that their ordinary meales are ban∣kets
and feastes, and there ech one is prouoked, to eate and drinke excessiuely: and so their tables are as it were shops or schooles of gluttony and drunkennesse. There they forget God, and al sobriety and temperance, and take al their delight in stuffing their bellies, wherof proceedeth the despising of chastitie: & they giue thēselues to daunsings & vnshamefast gestures, to want on lookes, vnlawful kisses, whoredomes & adulteries. Notwithstāding this is not to say, that it is not lawful to eate and drinke in the company of great men, but it is not meete that one aduance himselfe, and stretch foorth his arme to take meate, and satifie his desire. There one ought to shew al sobrietie & temperance, contenting himselfe with a little, to shew good example to thē which are set with him, or which waite about him. It shalbe therefore lawful for vs to sitte downe at the table, and eate with great men, as Solomon signifieth somewhat, when he saith, When thou shalt be set downe, &c. Hee saith not, flie the tables of great men, and forsake their meates: but he wil that wee be so wise and wel aduised, that wee content ourselues with a little quantitie of some meate, without desiring great diuersitie, as hee sheweth, when he saith, In considering, thou shalt consider, &c. Vnderstand we ther∣fore that wee are admonished of temperance which ought to bee in great estimation with al sortes of people, & at al times: Although Solomon heere make mention but of tables of great Lordes. And this is because it is not lawful to make ones self equal with him that ruleth & hath preheminence, as commonly table fellowes to main∣taine familiaritie, wil not seeke preheminence, one aboue another, but keepe themselues equall: wee wil therefore followe tempe∣rance principally in the presence of great men, and wil so esteeme of it: that wee wil sooner worke ourselues violence, then not ouer∣come our disordinate appetite, ouer the which wee ought to be maisters. Solomon wil haue it so, when he saith, 2 And thrust the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the soule. By the knife in the throte, he sheweth wel, that man ought to
force himselfe to followe temperance, and howe to doe himselfe vi∣olence, in mortifiyng his lustes, which are signified by the throte, for hee ought not to bee so loose, as to let his sensual appetite go∣uerne him, as Solomon warneth vs saying, If thou bee Lorde o∣uer the soule. Which is as though hee saide, Certenly thou oughtest to rule thy vnruly appetite: for after the manner of the scripture, the soule is taken somtimes for the appetite, which is not wel gouerned, not onely in eating and drinking, but also in other thinges, as to doe wrong to ones neighbours. Therefore that which Psal. 27. 12. & 41. 3. Rom. 13. Ephe. 4. & 5. Col. 3 Solomon speaketh by Allegory (as wee ought to vnderstande it, for hee biddeth vs not thrust a knife into our throtes to kill ourselues) Saint Paule teacheth in many places without figure. 3 Desire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies. Hee sheweth heere howe one ought to thrust the knife into his throte, and howe to bee Lorde ouer the soule, and principally in the presence of great Lordes: who although they haue their tables wel furnished with meates, sweete, and delicate, and wee be inuited thereto: yet neuerthelesse our appetite ought not to bee there too aduance vs, and make vs familiars and fellowes with them: for if they shewe vs a good countenance at their table, this argueth not that they are suche, or wil remaine such as they seeme to bee: but there is much feignednesse in them: they shewe themselues plea∣sant and tractable, when they are replenished with crueltie: They wil shewe themselues familiar, and imagine treason in their heartes: Solomon declareth it, saying, For it is a meate of lies or disceit. Briefly, wee are admonished by these three sentences not to assure ourselues of any thing, although kinges and princes of the earth, shew vs a faire countenance: for they are variable, and change very quickly, but that wee bee content with a meane estate, liuing by our dayly trauel and labour, according to the vocation whereto we are called: there wee shal not eate the meate of lyes, if in true obedience wee followe our vocation, nor shal not bee frustrate of our at∣temptes: for when the great men of the earth doe forsake vs vtterly, yet the eternal Lorde of Lordes will sticke fast vnto vs.
And therefore wee ought to assure ourselues in him saying, The Lorde is on my side, therefore wil I not feare what man can doe a∣gainst mee. 4 Striue not to bee riche, but ceasse from thine owne aduise. The holy scripture sheweth vs that God hath created al thinges and that he giueth vs al in plenteousnesse to vse, and hath neuer left Psal. 118. 6. vs without a token of his liberalitie, sending showres and fertile sea∣sons. And likewise he hath enriched many of his seruants as Abra∣ham, Isaac, Iacob, Dauid, Solomon, and a great number of others: and hereby he hath shewed vs that riches are good cretures, & that it is lawful to haue plenteousnesse thereof and be rich: Wherfore it might seeme that it is a thing praise worthie to striue to be rich, & to refuse nothing of that which God giueth, but to reioyce in the 1. Tim. 6. 17. Act. 14. 17. same as the Lorde wil haue it, and as hee hath declared by his word, as is alledged heeretofore. But the worlde hath no regarde to that which god hath made, but seeing the rich to be at their ease, to haue power, credite, and authoritie, and eche one to flatter them, & haue them in admiration. Seeing I say: their course of life to bee such, he coueteth to bee riche, and many trauel earnestly to hoorde vp sub∣stance, & he that doth so, is esteemed wise, wary, expert & an honest man, chiefly of those that would be rich. But one ought not to bu∣sie himselfe after such matters, nor haue such a thought in his head. as Solomon declareth saying, Striue not to bee riche, &c. Hee for∣biddeth not to striue or take paine. For as wee haue seene heereto∣fore God hath appointed that man should applie himselfe in his bu∣sinesse, hee saith not, that it is to bee rich, for God which maketh nothing euil, hath enriched many of his seruants. Also he forbiddeth vs not to be wise and wary in ordering our goods, and making our profite thereof, keeping them or disposing them as wee ought to do but he forbiddeth vs to take care for the goods of this worlde. Hee wil not that our minds and bodies should waxe weary in hoording vp goods & riches: as if without the same we were miserable and of Mat. 6. 19. 20. 25. 1. Tim. 6. 8. force must perish, whereto Iesus Christ agreeth. Hee forbiddeth vs also to be wittie as the children of this world, who thinke not them¦selues wary enough, if they boyle not after riches of the worlde, as
if their life consisted in the same: And so making such commande∣ment, he wil that wee keepe ourselues from couetousnes, whereof Luke. 12. 15. also Iesus Christ admonisheth vs. And to obay Iesus Christ wel, we ought to prop ourselues vpon the prouidence of God, according as Psal. 37. 5. & 55. 23. 1. Pet. 5. 7. Eph. 2. 10. we are taught. And in referring ourselues to the prouidence of God we ought not to be ydle nor negligent. For seing that God hath cre∣ated vs in Iesus Christ to good workes, which he hath prepared to the end we might walke in the same, our regeneration and satisfac∣tion should be nothing, if we were not careful to labour and take paines. But our trauel ought to be free from al couetousnesse of worldly riches, and we ought to regarde to what end God hath or∣deined the labour, which is, that in him wee fulfil his wil, to put our trust in him, and yelde him obedience. Thus doing, our labour shal-be blessed of him which commandeth it, for hee wilgiue vs suffi∣sance, and our riches shalbe profitable to vs. Whereas if by any other meanes we trauel to get riches, they wil be vaine and of no profite, and wil vanish away, so that we shal not knowe what is become of them. Solomon signifyeth it, saying, 5 Wilt thou cast thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in bestowing, it wil bestowe wings vpon it selfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the skies. To shew the vanitie & vnprofitablenes of riches, & that we ought not trauel to gather heapes thereof, hee calleth it a thing of no∣thing, Or which is not, or which one cannot obtaine to his minde, although he bestowe great care thereon: the which hee signifieth by casting the eyes, or making them flye. And signifying this care, hee wil not that one vse it, as hee wel sheweth in asking Wilt thou cast thy eyes? As if hee saide, It behoueth thee not to cast thy lookes on worldly riches to labour after them to obtaine great abundance: for they are nothing: And though they were somewhat, yet one coulde not haue thē at his wil no more thā an Eagle which is swift of wing, and flyeth aloft. For, as it foloweth in bestowing, it wil bestowe. An Eagle so swift, is as nothing to vs, and we cannot take her, for wee cannot fly on hye in the aire: which Solomon signifieth by the skies or heauens: for by the same wee ought to vnderstande the aire,
which is high aboue vs: As sometimes they are taken in the scrip∣tures. Insomuch as a thing being high in the ayre, seemeth too touch the skies: we ought (I say) to vnderstand it so, and not the heauens which are the seate of God, and the heritage of his elected. For if it bee as harde for a riche man to enter into the kingdome of heauen, as for a cammel to creepe through a needles eye, the riches that are frayle and transitorie cannot come there. When therefore it is sayde that riches will bestowe winges vppon themselues, it is giuen vs to vnderstande, eyther that they are not profitable, and vanish sodainely out of our sight, as the Eagle doth, or as the smoke which ascendeth into the aire, and no man knoweth what becom∣meth of it: or that we are not able ynough to obtaine the riches which we desire after our owne disordinate couetousenes. And so Solomon sheweth vs that we labour in vayne, and that we bee not wel aduised when we seeke to enrich ourselues, or lifte vs into an higher estate then God hath called vs vnto. For riches ordinarily make men proude, so that for their riches, they thinke they ought to be chosen to higher estate, which bringeth to passe, that they fal ve∣ry lowe: For he that exalteth himselfe shalbe brought lowe. Note we therefore, that we ought to be content, with that which GOD sendeth, and not giuen to auarice, nor aspiring to high estates to become rich. 6 Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his de∣lectable morsels. If we set the euil eye agaynst the good eye, which hath beene spoken of heeretofore: We ought by the euil eye to vnderstand the Prou. 22. 9. niggarde, snudge, couetous, vnkinde, cruell, and enuious person, which cannot suffer to see good, but to himselfe, whereof ensueth that he hath no delight at all to succour or ayde other men with his goodes. Solomon counselleth vs, that wee should seeke no plea∣sure nor seruice at the handes of such a one, when he sayth, Eate not. &c. By meate we may vnderstande the thinges which are most necessarie for this present life, as is bread. Also the word that Solo∣mon vseth in his language, signifieth, and is most commonly enter∣preted breade, and our Lord Iesus Christ, teaching vs to demaunde our corporall necessities, sayth, that wee should pray, Giue vs this
day our dayly bread. Therefore if of him that hath an euil eye, wee ought not to craue that which wee haue most neede of. Much lesse ought we to desire him to do vs any pleasure, which may recreat & reioyce vs. Solomon signifieth it wel, saying, And couet not his de∣lectable morsels. Wee vnderstande by delectable morselles, that which is pleasant and recreatiue, because there is nothing wherein, sweete lips, Epicures, and gluttons, delight more, then in delicate meates, and sweete morsels, yea, they make their bellies their Gods, Note we moreouer, that by meate and delectable morsels, Solo∣mon declareth couertly, that although the euill eye bee a niggard, snudge and couetous, yet neuerthelesse he handleth himselfe well, he liueth at his ease, and enioyeth his pleasures. But hee beholdeth not willingly his neighbour to florish and doe wel especially at his dispence. Nabal the husbande of Abiga was such a one, and so was 1. Sam. 25. Luke. 16. the rich man. 7 For as if he had thought it in his stomake, he will saye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte shall not bee with thee. By this reason he sheweth well, that it is true, that the euil eye wil counterfaite liberalitie. He wil bid his neighbours sometimes to Bankets, and wil present himselfe to them, offring them al seruice & pleasure, and wil protest it so with his mouth, or signifie it by some outwarde signes, as if he were fully determined so to doe, and that his wil and minde were such indeede. This is it that Solomon affir∣meth saying, as if he had thought it in his stomake, which is to say as if he were wel pleased and agreed thereto. So he wil say to thee, eate and drinke: But hee is an hypocrite and a dissembler, spea∣king and making shewes and gesture, without al good meaning, as Solomon declareth saying, But his heart shal not be with thee. If a mā haue a noble heart, & can know that such is the affection of an euil eie, he wil neuer seeke to haue pleasure nor seruice at his hand, for he cannot abide that one shoulde helpe him against his wil: And so such succour shoulde be more hurtful then profitable to him: and it woulde serue him to no purpose to giue thankes, or to offer his seruice for the same, or to requite it Solomon signifieth it when hee saith,
8 Thou shalt vomit out the morsel, which thou hast eaten: and shalt loose thy pleasant wordes. He signifieth also that the euil eye is so woe that hee hath done any good deede, that he wil doe some hurt afore he can bee recom∣penced for the same. And (as we say) he wil cut his throate that hath receiued ought from him, and wil anoy him, so that no man shal haue peace nor pleasure about him. And because it is a harde thing that we shoulde not speake euil of such fellowes, and vtterly hate them, and that we should not seeke to be reuenged of them: Note we that Solomon by these three sentences couertly admonisheth vs to fly al occasions, which may moue ill speeches, debates or strife, which are not fit for the children of God, which ought to seeke & folow al the meanes of peace, concord, and charitie with al men. He admonisheth vs also to be careful to iudge and discerne, betweene the liberal that beare a good minde, and the enuyous which desire but al mischiefe, to the end we loose not our time with the enuious, thinking to recreate ourselues with them, when they shewe vs a faire countenance and seeme friendly to vs. And that we put not our¦selues in that danger to haue our throtes cut, & we and our family vndone and destroyed by such enuious snudges. Wee are therefore heere warned to flie twoo things: The first is the ruine and destru∣ction of vs, and our family: The second, the occasion of debates, strifes, hates, and vproares. 9 Whisper not in the fooles eare, for he will despise the wise∣dome of thy woordes. Although Solomō say the fooles haue despised wisdom & instru∣ction, & that they are threatned perdition, as persons lost and cast a∣way, Prou. 17. 24. yet neuertheles wisdom ceaseth not to addresse her wordes to the foolish. And so it may seeme that Solomō speaketh now against himself, when he saith, Whisper not. &c. Or at leastwise, that he one Prou. 8. 5. while approoueth one thing & another while disalloweth it, which thing we ought neither to think nor say. For the holy Ghost is not variable or chaungeable in meaning. And therfore, sith we see that Solomon knewe wel the despising that fooles made of the worde of
God which is our wisedom and instruction, and yet neuerthelesse he ceaseth not to vtter his wordes to fooles. And afterwardes he now forbiddeth speaking to them, knowe wee that the woorde of God ought to bee vttered to al manner of people, as wee haue seene heeretofore. And as our Lorde Iesus Christ sheweth it in many pa∣rables: Pro. 1. 20. & 8. 1. Mat. 28. 19. Mar. 16. 15. and commandeth it to his Apostles, and hee himselfe hath spoken in the eares of fooles and contemners of good doctrine. But when men shew their follie so far, that of set malice they reiect that which they knowe to bee good, one ought in no wise to talke of wisedome vnto them. It is that which Solomon meaneth nowe when he saith, Whisper not in the fooles eare, &c. Wheretoo that Mat. 7. Acts. 13. 45. agreeth which our Lorde Iesus Christ saith, Giue not that which is holy to dogs, and cast not your pearles before swine. &c. And Saint Paule vseth it so to the Iewes which blasphemed. One might also say that Solomon speaketh heere of particular and secret admoniti∣ons because he maketh mention of the eares. And also it is a com∣mon phrase of speeche to say, I wil tel him in his eare, for I will tell him in secret or by himselfe. Of such admonitions fooles are not worthy: but ought to bee reprehended and corrected openly, to the ende to confute them if it bee possible, and to bring others in 1. Tim. 5. 2. feare. 10 Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans. Wee may see in the holy scriptures that God hath poore or∣phans, widowes and strangers in great estimation: for not only hee commandeth vs to aide them and doe them good, and himselfe de∣fendeth them from wrong: but also threateneth those which do them iniurie, outrage, and violence. But men make no account nei∣ther Leui. 19. 91. Psal. 82. 3. 4. Esa. 1. 17. Exod. 22. 21. 22. 23. 24. Zach. 7. 9. of the commandement nor of the defence, and threatning. So∣lomon knewe it wel: and therefore after Moses to make these men more inexcusable, he vseth the same caueat to forbid them, saying, Remoue not, &c. Wherein although hee speake but of orphanes for breuities sake, yet notwithstanding hee letteth not to compre∣hende the others therein: as he hath shewed by the generalitie pre∣cedent. And in the breuitie he hath the rather named the orphanes,
because according to their age they are most weake and least skilful to defende themselues. The world of the wicked knoweth it well, and therfore it is thē whome they rob & spoile willinglyest. Chiefly those which are giuen them for tutors and defendours, are they which polle and eate them soonest, making faire items of costes, and expences, and getting account-takers which are fauourable vnto them: to the end that those costes and dispences which they bring in, may be easilie allowed, as if they were iust and reasonable. They would bee afraide & ashamed to present such accounts before ho∣nest and substantial men, and of a good conscience: and yet they haue no feare of God, who wil neuer forsake the poore fatherlesse children, but deliuer them from oppression by his power & might, which might the oppressers cannot withstand: and wil performe the office of a good gouernor, as Solomon pronounceth of him saying. 11 For the redeemer is strong: And hee wil pleade their cause against thee. This is as though he said, because Orphans are weake & quyte voide of al humane succour, thou art so hardie as to polle and op∣presse them: but although men haue no care to take their cause in hand, & withstand the outrage & violence that thou vsest to them, or that thou thinkest thy selfe the strongest, and none dare nor can resist thee: yet neuerthelesse they are not voide of succour. They haue a redeemer who not only hath good wil to deliuer them from thy hands and violence, but also power, which power he wil imploy against thee, and thou shalt not resist him. And as Orphans and fa∣therlesse children through their weakenesse and smal strength can∣not let thee to eate them, and destroy them: euen so what valiancie soeuer thou hast, yet canst thou not let but God wil bee reuenged vpon thee, and wil put thee to perdition. Hee is their father, where∣fore hee wil doe his duetie to maintaine his children. The Play of Psa. 68. 6. the strong redeemer shalbe that he wil make knowne the wicked∣nesse of the oppressours he wil condemne them, and reuenge him∣selfe vpon them, and they shal notwithstande nor haue any succour at al.
12 Apply thy hart to vnderstanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge. Esa. 10. 2. 3. Oftentimes already Solomon hath sought to make vs attentiue to the doctrine of God, the which hee calleth one while lawe, ano∣ther while instruction, and another while wisdome science, and vn∣derstanding. He doth the same againe in this present sentence. And it is because we haue great need to be oftē aduertised of that which appertaineth to the glorie, and honour of God, to our saluation & the edification of our neighbours: for of our owne nature wee are so giuen to the worlde, that wee despise that which is of God, and it seemeth to vs that it is but time lost to apply ourselues theretoo, because we be not thereby the more exalted to wordly honours, nor more enriched with substance, but the rather despised, and re∣iected, polled and oppressed. Neuerthelesse if wee wil be exalted to true and perpetual honours, and enioy the goods which wil not pe∣rish, wee ought to followe that which Solomon hath alreadie often taught vs, and that which presently he doeth teache vs. And to doe this same, we ought to apply al our vnderstanding to learne to serue God, and our neighbours, and therein to spare neither bodie nor minde: as God hath created both the body and the spirites, and wil that wee bee wholy his and our neighbours. True it is that the harte is the principal, as wee ought to vnderstande it by many witnesses of the holy scriptures wherein is saide that God behol∣deth the hartes, and that wee are admonished to feare him, and loue him with al our hart, and that true worshippers worship the father in spirite and trueth. And Solomon signifieth it heere some∣what, when in the first place he requesteth the applying of the heart. And afterwardes sheweth vs that by the right affection of the heart, the outward senses ought to bee applyed to receiue instructi∣on which hee calleth wordes of knowledge. And in this manner hee sheweth vs that we are not sufficiently instructed, if wee giue not our hearing to the woorde of the Lorde the which is our know∣ledge. And so, that the preaching of the word is very necessary for vs: insomuch that without this holy ministery wee are all ignorant.
Not that God is not sufficient, and of power to instruct vs other∣wyse, without outward meanes by reuelations and secret inspirati∣ons. But he wil haue vs to folowe the order which he hath esta∣blished in his Churche, and that by mens meanes we be taught. 13 Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye. It hath beene spoken of the chastizing and correction of chil∣dren. But because for the most parte children are very harde to go∣uerne, Prou. 13. 24. & 19. 18. & 22. 15. and almost vncorrigible, and there are many foolish fathers and worse mothers, which wil neither chastise nor suffer others to correct their children: for they striue to persuade themselues that they feare that one wil kil their children, because they are tender and delicate (in which doing they thinke themselues more wise, thē the holy Ghost: And yet they loue not their children so tenderly as they ought, and haue not that care ouer them which they shoulde haue. For perswading themselues that they preserue the bodies of their children, not willing that they should in any wise be touched, they send (as much as in them lyeth) their soules to perditiō, main∣tayning them in folly and wickednesse) for this cause, Solomon not content with the former admonitions sheweth nowe, that they ought not to be afraide, that the rod wil hurt the children when he saith, Withdraw not, &c. He is not content to say: Correct thy child: but considering how profitable it is to continewe in brydling and correcting children, he wil not that parents hauing once begunne to chastice them, shoulde leaue of incontinent, and grieue to take the paine and care about them to correct them. As many parents will giue ouer their children, after that for one or two corrections they cannot make them to amende. Either they despaire of them, or else are afraide to make them dul and blockish, or else vtterly to kil thē. Solomon wil haue fathers and gouernours of children to continew in correcting and chastising them, according as they shal see need∣ful, and therefore hee saith, Withdraw not correction, &c. And to shewe that hee meaneth not correction only of wordes, he addeth. If thou beat him with a rod, &c. He knewe that children woulde
put no beleefe in woords, nor make no account of verbal speeches & therfore he would haue one to deale with the rod, and promiseth that the bodie shall not be hurt therewith, so that death shal folow, for he sayth, Hee shoulde not dye, Wherein he instructeth parents and sheweth them that they ought not to spare the rod, but shoulde make heir children feele it sharply, to make them remember to be∣haue hemselues wel, and not to returne to their wonted folly. And sheweth them that the markes or little woundes which they shall make with the rod vpon the bodie of their children shall not bee mortall. Also parentes are admonished that in chastising their chil∣dren, they seeke not to kil them. One may say moreouer, that when Solomon sayth He should not dye, That he giueth vs somewhat to vnderstande that those parentes which are carefull too correct their children, doe saue them from the gallowes, and doe let them from being executed by iustice. Contrariwise they which make no account to chastice them, send them to the galowes, as much as they can, but Solomon sheweth vs another deliuerance, which is great∣ly to be set by when he sayth: 14 Thou shalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his soule from hell. The temporall gallowes or gibbet destroyeth but the body for a certaine time, but hel swalloweth the soule for euer: yea and the body to after resurrection, to remayne in perpetual torments, both bodie and soule. Wherefore if fathers and gouernours ought to be careful to keepe the bodies from the gallowes by chastizing and beating their children with rods: by a farre more reason, when by meanes of the rod, one may keepe them from death eternal, they ought not to be negligent to vse the rodde, and yet neuertheles no thinke that the materiall rodde which one holdeth in his hande, hath such vertue of it selfe alone, for it is an instrument that GOD maketh to preuaile as he thinketh good. The principall rod to de∣liuer children from hel, is the woorde of the Gospell, which is the power of God to saue al beleeuers. And so it is not ynough, nor yet the principall point of correction and chasticement, To beate with the rod, but with the same the principall and most necessarie,
is that fathers, and gouernors bring vp their children, in the know∣ledge and wayes of the Lorde. And therefore they that haue Ephe. 6. 4. children in charge, ought to beecareful, to shewe them good exam∣ples, in liuing soberlie in this present world, so that no filthy worde proceede out of their mouthes, but only that which is good to the Tit. 2. 12. Ephe. 4. 29. vse of edifying, &c. 15 My sonne, if thy heart be wise, my heart shal reioyce, and I also. Carnal and worldly fathers are maruellously reioiced when they see their children increase in beautie, or temporal prosperitie, when they see their bodies are in good health, and they receiue pursely profit in augmenting earthly goods, and when they haue the craft to maintaine themselues ciuilly with their neighbours to haue them stil at their commandement. And yet they are not careful a whit howe they dispose of their soules. They haue no care but of that which is seene with the eye, and reioice in no other thing. Likewise the children of such men for the most parte resemble their fathers and reioice not but in worldly matters. But the faythful and true Christians reioice principally, when their children inwardly are wel disposed by wisedome. Solomon sheweth it when he saith, My sonne, if thy heart bee wise, &c. When Solomon is not content to say simply, my heart shall reioyce, but addeth, and I also, hee admonisheth vs very wel, that the greatest ioy of parents ouer their infants ought to be, when they see them wise, but not after the worlde: for the wisedome of this worlde is but folly before God: but that they bee filled with diuine wisedome, although this world reprooue it. Therefore when man beholdeth but the face, and there is none but God which seeth the hart, one may aske how fathers & mothers may reioyce, at the wisedome of the heartes of their chil∣dren. The answere is, that if the heart be wise, it will shewe him∣selfe so, by workes and words which are of God. For the hart which is truly giuen to wisedome, suffereth not the outwarde members to bee ydle, but as much as in him lyeth, forceth them to say and doe things, which are to the glory and honour of the Lorde, and to the profite and health of his neighbours. And so it behoueth the chil∣dren
to reioyce their parentes, imploying themselues to say and doe things good and honest, iust, and righteous. Solomon signify∣eth it, saying. 16 And my reines shal leape for ioy, when thy lips speake righteous things. See heere how the wisdome of the hart, is manifested by the lips, by the which we shal vnderstand al other members, which we must turne from wickednesse and apply to wel doing, according as God teacheth vs by his word. But Solomon to shunne prolixitie, speaketh but of lips, and the rather of them, than of other members because, they are readiest to manifest the inward partes, and most fit to shew forth the praises of God, and likewise to mainteine the heart that it wander not heere and there out of wisedome, as we prooue: for when wee thinke of any thing, it is streightwaies gone out of our hearts, except we common and talke of it, and speake with our mouthes: And also when the lippes speake according as the heart is affectionate, the other members are the more ready to execute that which is vttered. And when he saith, My reines shal leap for ioy: he vseth repetition which is familiar in the scriptures. It is the same which he hath said. My heart shal reioyce and I also. For the reines are taken for that which is most profoundly hidden in man, which is the hart, as may bee vnderstoode, in that the knowledge thereof is reserued to the Lord: and when he ioineth speaking of righteous things to the wisedome of the heart, he sheweth that Iere. 17. 9. 10. wisedome resteth not in phantasies, and good intentions of men, but in true knowledge of the wil of God, the which he declareth to vs by his word, which is the perfect rule to guide vs to wil, thinke lay, and doe, that which is right and equitie which resteth onely in this, that we yeelde the honour to God which appertaineth to him, and that wee aide one another in true charitie and brotherlie loue. This thus considered, wee see whereof it is that parentes ought to reioyce principally, in regarding the conuersation of their children: The superiours in seeing their subiectes: And the ministers in considering the flocke that they haue to feede.
Therefore sith folly is bounde in the heart of the childe, it folow∣eth wel that al they which haue any gouernement of youth, ought Prou. 22. 15. very carefully to obey that which Solomon commandeth them ver. 13. 14. Otherwise they cannot haue true ioy: for folly remay∣neth: And so the lips speake not of righteous things: where at all faythful and Christian gouernours ought greatly to reioice. And therfore according to the estate that they occupy, they ought to vse correction, to driue a way folly which is bound in the harts of chil∣dren, the magistrates in one sorte, the ministers in another, and the fathers in another, for they haue not al one and the same power. The ministers force consisteth onely in the worde: Magistrates haue the sworde, and fathers the rod: and also they may vse war∣nings and admonitions by the worde. For although it appertaineth onelye to ministers, to preache the worde publikely, yet neuerthe∣lesse as magistrates and parents ought to gouerne themselues by the same, so ought they to vse it towardes them which they haue in gouernement. 17 Let not thyne hart bee enuious against sinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually. It seemeth wel to yong folkes that they are wise ynough, if they folowe the multitude, and seeke to raise themselues vp and bee of value, in aduauncing themselues, and working their owne profit: although it bee to the damage of their neighbours: and so they are sinners, that is to say, hauing their hartes infected and corrupted with malice and wickednesse, and shewing it in their conuersation with the which they are wel pleased. And vsing themselues in this sorte they florish and prosper in outwarde apparance, they haue their desires, and wishes and liue at their ease: as it is seene, and hath beene alledged by the scriptures. Contrariwise they which are wise indeede, and folowe righteousnesse, haue often miserie and ca∣lamities, whereby it commeth to passe that they are tempted too doe as the foolish and wicked doe, to haue part of their prosperity. But Solomon sheweth them, that if by the wisedome of the hearte they will speake of righteous thinges as belongeth to them, they ought not to obey such temptations, saying: Let not thy heart be
enuious agaynst sinners. Heere Solomon teacheth vs in briefe, that which Dauid treateth amply, in the. 37. Psalme, wherein wee haue to note, that to be enuious against sinners, is, in regarding their temporal prosperitie to be agreeued at our owne miserie, and not to care what wee doe so we may attayne to their ease and doe as we thinke they doe. And so vnder this worde of enuie, or zeale, or affection, wee vnderstand, that Solomon comprehendeth the prosperitie of the wicked, and signifieth that they are happie accor∣ding to the outwarde apparance, for why one seldome enuieth the poore and miserable, neither coueteth to be in their estate, but ra∣ther detesteth them, & flyeth their companie as much as is possible: For it seemeth that one shal come thither but too soone. Also by this worde Enuie or affection, Solomon sheweth that hee speaketh to them which are miserable according to the worlde: for they which are at their ease, thinke not on other mens estates to desire them, except they bee vnsatiable gluttons, which knowe nothing what they ought to doe. Note wee secondly, when hee putteth the feare of the Lorde against euuie, or zeale, that they which suffer thē¦selues Prou. 16. 6. to bee caried away by such enuie or affection, haue no feare of the Lorde: for by the same they withdrawe themselues from e∣uil. And when one desireth to prosper as the wicked doe, there is no euil whereto he giueth not himselfe to come to his desires. And when after hauing spoken heere afore of the wisedome of the heart and speach of righteous things, hee admonisheth vs to the feare of Lorde, hee sheweth that if wee doe not feare the Lorde, wee are voide and naked of all wisedome and righteousnesse, and although it bee necessary, and that otherwise it cannot bee, but the feare of the Lorde is permanent, yet neuerthelesse when Solo∣mon addeth, Continually, hee saith no superfluous thing, but ex∣poundeth to vs more clearely the true nature of the feare of the feare of the Lorde, and sheweth vs that if wee feare the Lorde tru∣ly wee shoulde continue in wisedome and righteousnesse. And al∣though according to the outwarde apparance, sinners floorishe and prosper, and that miseries assaile on al sides them which feare God, as though they shoulde perishe without redemption, and that there were no ende of their calamities: Notwithstanding those which feare the Lord haue an hope, of the which they shal not be frustrate.
18 For surely there is an ende, and thyne hope shal not bee cut off. Albeit the sense be very true, that the calamities of the iust men which feare God shal haue ende, and that without al fault: as one may confirme it when Solomon saith, And thyne hope shall not bee cut off: Yet notwithstanding it is no inconuenience to say that Solomon yeeldeth a reason why one should not enuie sinners, when he saith, For surely there is an ende, &c. The cause why one is enuy∣ous against sinners, is because at al times hee hath seene them pros∣per and yet seeth them: and it seemeth that they shal doe so stil. But there wil be an end, and that shortly, as (Psal. 37.) it is wel declared vnto vs. Wheretoo Solomon accordeth saying, For surely, &c. Which thing might wel afray sinners, and make them loose their courage, if they had any sense at all. For if there bee (as it is very true) an ende of their prosperitie, it followeth that they perishe without redemption, seing that all their endeuour is in that which is of no indurance. And so the ende shalbe taken heere, for depri∣uation of al prosperitie: as also one may vnderstande it when So∣lomon putteth the hope of the iust a contrary to the ende and saith: That it shal not be cut off. When hee attributeth hope to him which feareth God, he sheweth that those which walke in doubt & distrust are nothing worth: although they make a faire shew of ho∣linesse and iustice, as doe those which feare God by the commande∣ments of men. He sheweth also that it is the common vse of them which feare God, to haue afflictions: in that that hope is ioyned Esa. 29. 13. Rom. 5. 3. 4. & 8. 25. Iam. 1. 2. 3. to patience which proceedeth of tribulation. What afflictions then soeuer happen vs, let vs bee patient, And our hope shal not bee cut off. For dooing so, wee shal not bee of the number of the wic∣ked, which are threatened to bee cut downe as the grasse: but wee shalbe borne anewe of seede incorruptible, which shal remaine for Psal. 37. 2. 1. Pet. 1. 23. euer.
19 O thou my sonne, heare and bee wise, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way. When our wisedome and vnderstanding, consisteth not but in the worde of God, as hath often beene saide, and as it hath beene Deut. 4. 6, alledged: It is not without cause that Solomon inuiteth ech one of vs to heare, desiring that by hearing we may become wise. And that we may be the more careful to obay him, hee is not content to say, Thou whosoeuer thou art, heare: but, O thou my sonne, heare. In calling eche one of vs his sonne, hee sheweth his greate charitie towards vs. And by the same he presseth vs to giue him our hearts, inclyning ourselues to folowe, willingly his admonitions and in∣structions. Hee sheweth also with what affection, Pastours and Ministers of the Church ought to beled towardes the Lords flock: which is that they beare themselues as fathers towardes their chil∣dren so to leade them the more easily, to the obedience of the word. As S. Paule likewise doeth it in many places. He wil, that hauing heard, we become wise: for he saith, And be wyse, As hee hath admonished vs heeretofore. And afterwardes that by this wisedome wee doe our duetie as wee ought to doe. For hee saith, And guyde thy heart vprightly, &c. And so, wee vnderstande that the worde is not preached vnto vs, to liue in negligence and ydlenesse, but that by the same, hauing learned to bee wise, wee may bring foorth the fruites of wisedome, which is to guyde ourselues vprightly in this worlde, yeelding God the honour which hee asketh vs by his lawe, and dooing pleasure and seruice to our neighbours, according as hee commandeth vs by the same, See heere the way in the which wee ought vprightly to guide our heartes. Solomon speaketh expresly of the guyding of the heart: for if it be not well affectionate, al that wee goe about is manifest wickednesse: or if we doe any thing which profiteth, wee are led by hypocrisie: And that which wee doe fairely before men is but abhomination before God, who beholdeth the hearts.
20 Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuou∣rers of flesh. We desire naturally to haue wherewith to maintaine ourselues in good order in this life, and to be cloathed honestly. Such desire is not to be despised nor blamed, when it is without auarice and a∣greeth with that which Iesus Christ teacheth vs, when he saith that we should aske of God our father, that hee woulde giue vs this day our dayly bread. Wherein as wee are taught to fly auarice, and not to eate the bread of others for nothing: so also wee are taught to content ourselues with a litle nourishment and meates which are not of an hye price nor curious dressing, and apparel, which is not sumptuous. Wherfore let vs neither be gluttōs, nor deintie mouths, nor drunkards, nor couet the bankets and feastes of such persons, who are neuer at their ease, but when they are bibbing and swal∣lowing. Solomon warneth vs thereof saying, Keepe not company 1. Tim. 44. & 6. 17. with wyne bibbers, &c. He saith not, keepe not company with them which drinke wine and eate fleshe. For euery creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused when it is taken with thanksgi∣uing. And the liuing God giueth vs al things abundantly to vse. But he saith, With wyne bibbers, &c. Hee wil not that wee bee hoate nor hastie to fil ourselues with wyne and flesh, not considering where∣too al things are created. And sheweth howe it is not meete that wee shoulde fill wyne downe our throtes, as into a vessel which hath a large mouth, nor that wee deuoure meate lyke hungry wolues: but that in sobrietie and temperance wee sauour our flesh and our wyne, not so much to take our corporal delight thereof, as to acknowledge the bountie & liberalitie, which our Lord God v∣seth towards vs, to giue him thanks for the same: as we are boundē theretoo, hauing nothing but by his grace and mercie. Thus doo∣ing although in this worlde, we cannot choose, but wee must bee a∣mongst drunkardes and deuourers of flesh, yet neuerthelesse wee shal not bee with them: for wee shal not bee partakers of their vn∣fruiteful woorkes of darkenesse. As Saint Paule telleth vs. Eph. 5. 119.
Note wee besides, that there is gluttonie, not onely in eating too much, either of Beefe, Mutton, or foule, but also of fishe: for that is fleshe, although it bee not named so amongst the Papists. S. Paul is witnesse of it. Wherefore the Papists are much abused, when to abstaine from that which they cal flesh, they perswade themselues that they fast, and yet they fil themselues once a day with fishe and wine, so ful as the belly wil holde, so that they haue no appetite a∣gainst 1. Cor. 15. 3. euening▪ But it so much lacketh that they fast and are sober, that they are rather wine bibbers, & fleshly gluttons, wherby they deserue wel to haue that pouertie which Solomon threatneth to them which are gluttons and drunkardes, saying. 21 For the drunkard and the glutton shalbe poore: and the too much sleeper shalbe clothed with rags. Solomon giueth vs heere the reason, for the which he wil not haue vs to keepe company with wine bibbers, and in this reason he sheweth, that of drunkennesse and gluttony proceede pouertie, the which wee naturally doe feare. Gluttons and drunkardes merite it wel, for they are not onely spende thriftes, and wealthwasters, but also they are slouthful, as Solomon marketh it, when he addeth here the too much sleeper whereof Solomon hath blamed the slouthful, and as hee hath threatened the slouthful of pouertie, so doeth hee Pro. 6. 9. 10 11. now heere, when he attributeth rags to him that sleepeth too much and if we see not this happen before our eies, yet let vs knowe that they which continue in drunkennesse and sleeping, shal not escape Gods hand: for if they be not reputed worthie of temporal goods, they are not capable of heauenly substance. 22 Heare thy father which begot thee: and dispise not thy mother when she waxeth old. Subiection is a very harde thing, and those which are most bounden to yeeld obedience, flie from it as much as they can. There is no subiection nor obedience which is more esteemed amongest men thā that of children towards their fathers & mothers, but chil∣dren haue no care to doe their dueties, and principally when their
fathers and mothers bee olde, then the children which couet to liue at their owne pleasure, perswade themselues that their fathers and mothers are too seuere and rigorous, or striue to make them be∣leeue that they dote and are mad, and that they knowe not what they say or doe. For this cause they haue great neede to be stil tolde of their duetie, as Solomō warneth them thereof: and here againe, saying, Heare thy father, &c. Wherein hee teacheth children nothing but that which they woulde shoulde bee doone vnto them, if they had children, as one may perceiue, when there are neither fathers nor mothers so young, which wil not bee so honoured of their chil∣dren: It is meete therefore that children haue regarde to doe their duetie to their parents, as Solomon exhorteth them in this verse. Although hee attribute great authoritie to parents: first when hee saith, Heare, In this hee will that children holde their parentes for maisters & true techers, & as bearing words in the name of Christ: for it is him of whom the father saith, Heare him. Also by this word Heare, he sheweth parents in what schole they ought to studie: that is, in the heauenly fathers schoole, by the meanes of Iesus Christ: otherwise they can say nothing that their children ought to heare. This is not to say notwithstanding, that fathers & mothers ought to cōmande their children nothing which is not expressed word by worde in the scripture. It sufficeth that they commande them no∣thing, wherein they offende if they obey. Then children ought to heare and render to their parents, the honour which God comman∣deth. It is that which the Apostle Saint Paule commandeth, say∣ing, In al thinges &c. And to the Ephesians, hee expoundeth what Col. 3. 20. Ephe. 6. 1 al these thinges are, ween hee saith, According to the Lorde: for it behooueth vs to obey father and mother in al that which is not contrary too the honour and subection which wee owe vntoo God. Secondly, he attributeth authoritie, when he saith, thy father for seeing that God doeth this honour to men, which are but his organs and instruments, to communicate his titles too them: it is no reason that children shoulde disdaine them, or once enterprise to disobey them: for their disobedieuce woulde not bee against men, but against God. Also fathers are taught too bee the imitators of
that onely great father, which is the father of bodies and soules: for hee hath created al, and hath care ouer al. Euen so fathers ought to haue care both of the bodies & soules of them which God hath giuen them. Thirdly, when hee saith, which begot thee, hee at∣tributeth great authoritie to fathers, for he putteth them as it were in the place of God, to whome onely it belongeth to bring foorth children into the world, making the mothers fruiteful, as Iacob pro∣ued it. And therfore when it is said: which begot thee, let fathers & mothers, know that they are the instruments & organs of God: & let children acknowledge, that they shoulde haue beene nothing, if God had not made their fathers and mothers fertile, and that they haue al by their meanes, for the which cause it is good reason, that Gen. 30. 1. 2. they yeelde themselues subiects and obedient to them: and that fa∣thers bee careful ouer their owne workes, and let them not goe to perdition for fault of instruction, teaching, correction, and chastise∣ment. But although vnder the name of the father, wee ought al∣so to vnderstande the mother (for the commandement importeth, honor thy father and mother:) yet neuerthelesse Solomon knowing the worlde to bee so depraued and bad, that men make no account of their mothers, because they are women (as those children tell them, which haue no feare of God) he hath made expresse mention of the mother, saying, And despise not thy mother when she waxeth olde. Solo∣mon knew that in an house or family they made no account of mo∣thers, when they brought no profite to the house, which commeth to passe, when for age they can doe no handy worke: for this cause hee maketh expresse mention of their age, and wil that in the same one make as much account of mothers, as they did when they were strong and lustie, and not to reiect them as doting & old fooles: as is the vse of wicked children, which seeke but their owne profite or pleasure. Suche people loue not to see those which shew them their faultes and rebuke them: nor those which serue them too no vse, but to spende. Nowe as Solomon wil not, that principally in age, one shoulde despise his mother, euen so hee couertly admonisheth mothers to gouerne thēselues so well by the worde of God in their youth, that in their old age they be honorable before their children, insomuch that they reteine authoritie to cōmand, & their children
bee they neuer so olde, feare their displeasure. 23 Buy trueth, and sel it not, wisedome, instruction, and vn∣derstanding. Albeit this present sentence may bee applyed to al men because al men haue neede to possesse trueth: as wee are inuited dayly to the same by the preaching of the Gospel: yet notwithstanding be∣cause the former sentence was spoken to children, and also some which followe touch them (as wee may see) it is very requisite too say, that Solomon continueth his purpose, & teacheth children that which they haue to doe in hearing their fathers: for although hee speake as it were commanding, yet neuerthelesse wee may wel say that hee expresseth the desire which hee hath too haue children profite. Nowe seeing hee commandeth, or desireth that children should so wel heare their fathers, that thereby they shoulde buy trueth, wisedome, instruction, and vnderstanding, hee sheweth that pa∣rents ought to bee possessours of trueth, otherwise their children cannot buy it of them: for one cannot buy of any one thing which hee hath not: hee wil therefore that parents bee a good example to their children, walking without fraude, iniurie and violence, and speaking continually the trueth. In this wise children may buy of them, that which Solomon commandeth or desireth heere. But because children obteine commonly of their parents eche thing li∣berally, and without exchange, which is necessary for them, it may bee saide that Solomon speaketh vnproperly, when he saith, Buy. Seeing also that in al the worlde there is nothing which is sufficient to exchange for trueth, wisedome, instruction, and vnderstanding. And when hee admonisheth vs to buy, it is as if hee saide: It beho∣ueth children to be careful and diligent to learne of their parentes to bee true, wise, humble, obedient, & wel aduised: and to refraine frō al lying, fraude, deceite, and cousonage: to renounce al vanitie and folly, and to flie from al perswasions which tende to pride and dis∣obedience: and detest al folly and ignorance. Thus doing, they shal buye, that is to say, they shal obteine trueth, wisedome, instruction, and vnderstanding. Nowe as they which buye any
landes or inheritance for the most parte determine to keepe that which they buy, and will in no case depart from it for feare of want: for wee see it commeth to passe that they which sell their lands, doe not liue by the gaine of their mony, but dispende it foolishly, or haue it taken from them and lost: so Solomon wil that one keepe trueth, wisedome, instruction and vnderstanding wel, and not de∣part from it, as hee sheweth when he saith, And sell it not. And so hee wil that children perseuer in the former vertues, not giuing them ouer in any cace: for according to the custome of the world, hee which selleth, defeateth himselfe of that which he selleth, and another seaseth vpon it. Meane while let vs not thinke that Solo∣mon is against that wee shoulde make our neighbours partakers of the giftes and graces, that God hath bestowed vpon vs, either by the meanes of our parents or by others: for in communicating them we disinherite not ourselues, nor diminish them at al, but rather augment them: for the rest, there are some which take this Rom. 15. 27. 1. Cor. 9. 11. Gal. 6. 6. Mat. 10. 8. 1. Pet. 5. 2. sentence generally, and by buiyng trueth, they vnderstand that one ought to vse liberalitie towardes them which distribute spiritual thinges. And by not to sell, they vnderstande that doctours ought not to be giuen to gaine, but to teache freely. 24 The father of the righteous, in reioysing, shalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wise childe, shall haue ioy of him. It is no inconuenience to say that Solomon in this sentence, and in the next, intreateth of that which in the 15. and 16. verses he hath doone, but in an other maner of speaking. Repetition (as hath beene often saide) is familiar in the scripture, in the which the holy Ghost sheweth the great care which he hath ouer vs, as is needful it shold bee so: for wee make no great hast to awake ourselues, and stu∣die to doe our duetie by one onely warning, it vanisheth away ea∣sily out of our vnderstanding because wee are vaine and carnal, and by nature enimies to iustice and wisedome: and so wee cannot re∣ioyce ourselues in the same, but in folly and iniquitie, according Psal. 51. 7 Rom. 7. 14. Ephe. 2. 3. as we are conceaued and borne: Dauid reknowledgeth it, and S. Paul maketh great complaint thereof. Now therefore seeing by na∣ture,
none is wise and righteous: and it is very harde to come to it, when Solomon saith, The father of the righteous shalbe glad, and he that hath begotten, &c. hee meaneth not that by their first and carnal birth, children bee wise and righteous, as one may gather it by diuers sentences of his Prouerbes: but hee sheweth first of all to fathers, and mothers, that they ought greatly to loue righteous∣nesse, Pro. 12. 15. and wisedome, and in the same to haue al their delight, aswel in liuing after the same, as seeking to print them wel in the heartes and mindes of their children, for if they take no pleasure to followe righteousnesse and wisedome, and to obteine the same, and also too make their children partakers thereof by sounde doctrine, by good admonitions, corrections, & chastisements, they wil make no great account, to see them wise and righteous, nor cannot reioyce a whit in the same: much lesse wil they haue that great ioy which Solo∣mon requireth of them, as hee sheweth when hee is not content to say simply, that hee shalbe glad, but he doubleth the worde, saying, In reioysing shalbe glad. And yet againe hee repeateth it saying, Hee shall haue ioy of him. Secondly, hee sheweth children that they ought to bee care∣ful to take good heede, to the honest manners and holy conuersati∣on, to the doctrine and admonition of their fathers and mothers: and that they seeke to mortifie their vaine and foolishe concupis∣cences, their carnal and disordinate affections, so that by the good reformation of their hearts they may shewe in their liues and con∣uersation, righteousnesse and wisedome, and may studie to giue by this meanes recreation to their fathers and mothers: So that (as Solomon requireth it) their parents in reioysing may be glad. This is the duetie of children to striue to giue such ioy to their fathers & mothers. And also Saint Paule giueth them expresse admonition thereof. 25 Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and shee that bare thee, be glad. It is not meete therefore for children to say that they are too young to doe wel, and bee wise: for it is by wisedome that one
reioyceth his parentes. Contrariwise hee bringeth but sorowe and sadnesse to his parentes by folly. Pro. 10. & 15. 20. Pro. 17. 21 26 My sonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies de∣light in my wayes. Wisedome warneth vs not onely to take away al vanitie and folly from our hearts, but also renouncing ourselues to giue al our whole affections to her, for shee saith not, my freend, or my neigh∣bour, but shee saith, my sonne, shewing vs, seeing wee are her chil∣dren, that wee shoulde be wholy at her commandement. For seeing we haue our carnal fathers in reuerence, shal we not be much more subiect to the father of the spirite? Shee saieth not, Drawe neere thy heart to mee, But, Giue me thy heart. And so shee wil not that wee be to ourselues: for that which is giuen, is no more his which gi∣ueth it. Wheretoo agreeth somewhat, that which our Lorde Iesus Christ teacheth vs: If any man wil folowe mee, let him forsake him¦selfe, and folowe mee. To giue our heartes wel to wisedome, it be∣hooueth vs not to folowe our owne phantasies, and good intenti∣ons, nor that our delight be in that which wee thinke and imagine Hebr. 12. 9 of ourselues, and which wee desire by nature, but that wee take pleasure in that which wisedome teacheth vs, and that her gouern∣ment Mat. 16. 24. be our delight: as shee admonisheth vs thereof, consequent∣ly, saying, And let thyne eyes delight, &c. Wherein we haue as it were a repetition, or exposition of giuing the heart. For one can take no pleasure but there where his heart is. It is meete therefore that wee giue ourselues to our God, hauing all our delight in his woorde, to followe ioyfully the way which it teacheth vs. This dooing, our eyes shall delight in the wayes of wisedome. That is to say, that our spirites and vnderstanding, take great plea∣sure to vnderstande that which wisedome teacheth, and also to thinke on it well, to conduct willingly al our senses both exte∣riour, and interiour to the obedience of the woorde. That is it which we ought to vnderstand, when it is saide to vs, And thyne eyes, &c. For if one see the wayes of wisdome but with corporal eyes, he cannot delight therein: but it behoueth our in warde eyes to see it, and regarde it ioyfully, so that they may stir vp the outward
partes to giue themselues thereto, and that we be wholy both soule and body giuen to to the seruice of our God. Also Solomon re∣quireth first of all the hearte, and then the eies: wherein hee com∣prehendeth al the man, the conduct of whome proceedeth from the heart and the eies. Therefore as our celestial father is holy, and by good right requireth that his children bee holy. So it is meete that fathers of this worlde bee of an holy conuersation, to giue good ex∣ample to their children, to the ende to draw them to the like maner of liuing, and that in this sort they possesse the hearts of their chil∣dren, which followe their steppes not against their will, but most willingly. 27 For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a strange woman as a narowe pit. To giue our heartes to wisedome, and delight in her wayes, we haue to restraine ourselues from many sortes of wickednesses: the which are natural to vs because of our corruption and malice. Notwithstanding, Solomon inuiting vs to giue our heartes to wise∣dome, seeketh not at this present, but to restraine vs from whore∣dome and drunkennesse, whereof whoredome proceedeth, as here∣after shalbe seene. One may think that it is because the greatest part of the worlde at al times hath made no conscience, nor yet doeth not, to vse whores, and be dronke: or that of these twoo, proceede many other vices, yea almost al wickednesse. By whoredome and drunkennesse one commeth to ydolatrie, and to blaspheme God, and despyse al religion, one commeth to rebel against his parents and superiours, to kil, robbe, lye, backbyte, beare false witnesse and to ymagine and doe other wickednesse. Therfore to withdrawe vs from whoredome, he compareth the whorishe person, (whome Prou. 2. 16. & 5. 3. & 6. 24. & 7. 7. Psal. 7. 16. & 57. 7. Esa. 24. 17. Iere. 18. 10. Mat. 15. 14. also he calleth a strange woman) to a deepe ditch, out of the which one cannot recouer, when he is once falne in. And also hee compa∣reth her to a narrow pit, wherein if a man fal and his head before, hee cannot bowe himselfe, to bring his legges beneath, and lift vp his head, but must of force bee stiffled in the water, and so perishe. And so by such comparisons he sheweth vs, that those which haunt whoores destroy themselues. As hee hath shewed it.
heretofore: where hee treateth amply of the ruine and destruction of whoremaisters, and harlots. Wherfore it is no neede to stay long thereon nowe, nor to tel why the whore is called a strange woman, for it hath bene shewed. Onely note we, that the Ditch, and Pit, are often taken in the scripture, for ruine and perdition. Also Solo∣mon compareth the whoorishe person to a hunter, which lyeth in waite for the beast to bring him into his snares, and kil him, when he saieth: 28 Also shee lieth in waite as for a praye: and she encrea∣seth the transgressours amongest men. These Ambushments haue beene declared here aboue, where it is saide, That a woman hunteth for the precious life of a man: shee is not content to lye in waite for one man, but she allureth ma∣ny Pro. 6. 26. & 7. 10. to her: Not those which keepe themselues firme and constant in veritie and loyaltie, and wil in no wise breake the promise made to their lawful choyce, but those which feare not God, and make no account to lye, and deceiue their beloued. It is that, which So∣lomon meaneth, when he saieth, And encreaseth the transgressours amongest men. That is to say, that they which are of an euil fayth, are easily allured to whore∣dome, be they men or women. For that which is spoken of the whorishe woman, ought also to bee vnderstoode of the man giuen to whoredome, which suborneth and entiseth by flatteries & lyes, or other suttle, or violent meanes, many maydes, and wiues, which are not of a good Fayth and loyaltie towardes God and men. For the rest, if we wil vnderstand these two sentences of spiritual whor∣dome, which is farre more dangerous then the bodilie: or at least∣wise, take an admonition by the same, to wit, that if it behooueth vs to be careful to flye from whoredome, to giue our heartes to our father, by a farre more reason we ought to abhorre idolatrie, which is a whoredome, not onely dangerous, but also greatly displeasant and abhominable, before the eyes of our father, before his Angels, and al his elected, which knowe the trueth. Wee may take allego∣rically the harlot, and strange woman, for the gouernours & heades of the people, which haue not the true religion: for such gouernors are wel like to the deepe ditch and narowe pit: seeing they leade al
those to perdition whom they gouerne in superstition & idolatrie, yea, what zeale or good intention soeuer be in the leader, or in them which are ledde. For if the blinde leade the blinde, they fal both in∣to Mat. 13. 14. the ditch. Of suche whoremaisters and whores, the Papaltie is ful. Likewise there are in the same many hunters, which lye in waite, and laie ambushes for the people, by false doctrine, and tradi∣tions of men and the Deuil, and allure to them great multitude of those which keepe not fayth and promise with their Creator as they ought. It behooueth vs to bee verie warie to take heede of suche hunters, to the end we may be a chast virgin to Christ. To doe this same wel, we ought to holde the simplicitie of the Gospel, and to re∣fraine ourselues from al other faire apparance of holinesse and re∣ligion. 29 To whome is woe? To whom is sorowe? To whom is strife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cause? and to whom is the red∣nesse of the eyes. Because wee feare incommodities, and reioyce when al thinges come to our wishe, and yet neuerthelesse we cease not to sleepe stil in vices and dissolutions, which are most commonly cause of the in∣commodities which we feare, and are yrkesome to vs: For this cause Solomon to waken vs, and bring vs in minde to flye the dissolutiōs from the which this yrksomnesse proceedeth, vseth many in terro∣gations, saying: To whome is woe? &c. And this is as though hee asked: who are they which merite by their excesse & dissolutions, to haue so great incommodities & miseries, that they are constrai∣ned to crie out, we are woe. Who are they, which come by good right to so muche pouertie, that they cannot but haue care and vex∣ation, and that greatly? Who are they which come iustly to suche brutishnesse, that they force neither of peace nor concord, but stirre vp strife with euerie one? who are they which are constrained to grone, and weepe, and to shead many teares? who are they which seeke to bee wounded for a thing of nothing, for the which they ought not to striue, but rather leaue off, seeing it bringeth no profite but hurt, for they receiue stripes for it? who are they which merite
to haue red eyes? Heere Solomon maketh mention of many corpo∣ral and temporal incommodities and asketh to whom they are pro∣per, who are they to whome they happen commonlyest, and who well deserue them: when he maketh such a demaund, it is not for ignorance, but to awake vs from sleepe, for he giueth by and by after the answeare saying. 30 Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and seeke mixture. Heere hee noteth drunkardes, which loue to sit long about the cuppe, and to emptie it often, and are careful or rather greedie and couetous to enquire out tables where they fill out wine abundant∣ly that they may drinke excessiuely: such prodigal distribution, or ex∣cesse in drinking, is heere called mixture. Esay vseth the same word, rebuking the vntemperancie of drunkardes. Solomon therefore an∣swereth Esay. 5. 22. that the miseries and incommodities aforesayde are well due to the drunkard. And also we see them come to passe vppon them oftentimes, and they are greeuously vexed. Wherefore to the ende we may wel giue our heart to wisedome, and shunne the miseries aforesaide, wee ought to obey this woorde of wisedome, when she sayth to vs: 31 Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it sheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleasantly. He will not haue vs to resemble franke drinkers, which are not content to take and drinke wine with sobriety and temperance, and to delight therein moderately (as to this ende God hath created wine and other drinkes for man) but they giue themselues ouer wholly to drinking, and vse therein great libertie, the which they thinke to be delight, and place there affection wholly thereon: As they shewe wel, when they employ their time to consider of the coulour of the wine in the cuppe, and stande a greate while to tast and sauour it, and let it goe downe softly, and cannot bee content but when they drinke largely thereof.
Solomon sheweth vs that such fashions are not good, when hee biddeth, Regarde thou not, &c. This is not to say that the colour of the wine shoulde not be good, or that it is ill done to see if the wine bee whyte or red, if it bee cleere or troubled: nor also that one doeth ill when he tasteth his wyne, to the ende to vse it if it be good and neate, and to refuse it if it bee corrupted. But it is not meete to bee so curious as the drunkardes are, which haue no other good but drinke, as they wel shewe, when they are so much giuen theretoo. When they spende so much tyme in drinking, and drinke so excessiuely, they finde it very sweete, and thinke that nothing is better then to drinke wel. They perswade themselues, that in this manner they keepe themselues wel in this life, and to liue long there is nothing else to bee done but to bee merie: and so they thinke not on the ende, vnlesse they perswade with themselues that if they haue liued at their ease to day, they shalbe to morrow better: so that one may put them in the number of those which say. Come I wil bring wine, and wee wil fill ourselues with Esa. 56. 12. strong drinke: and to morowe shalbee as this day, and much more abundant. Heerein they are farre deceiued: for although the wine goe downe pleasantly, and that they finde it of a good taste, yet ne∣uerthelesse when they vse it not soberly it is mortal poyson: as So∣lomon pronounceth it saying. 32 In the ende thereof it will bite like a serpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice. Hee vseth heere twoo similitudes to signifie one thing. And it is to affirme the danger which is in wine, when one is giuē too much theretoo. And so he imployeth himselfe to restraine vs from drun∣kennesse, and seeketh to perswade vs that as the byting of a ser∣pent, and hurte of a Cockatrice are venemous and mortal: e∣uen so drunkardes by too much drinking poyson themselues, and kill themselues, yea more mortally then if they were so hurte with the Cockatrice: for such hurting toucheth but the body: but the olde serpent and that greate Dragon, which is the Diuell, stingeth the soules of drunkardes, alluring them by disordinate
affection, to vse wine excessiuely: and so obaying the Diuel, they are depriued of the kingdome of God, and by consequence, goe to 1. Cor. 6. 10 death euerlasting. And so let vs knowe, that Solomon according to the maner of the scripture, by corporal similitudes sheweth vs in what danger the soules of them are, which giue themselues to drun∣kennesse: Not that drinke which is a good creature of God, and ve∣rie necessarie, bringeth with it damage to the soule: but that by disordinate concupiscence, man is hurt and bitten. Afterwards whē concupiscence hath conceiued, shee bringeth forth sinne, and sinne being perfourmed, engendreth death. 33 Thine eyes shal looke vpon strange women, & thine heart shal speake leude thinges. He continueth here the matter which he began with, of drun∣kardes, and so wil doe til he come to the ende of this Chapter. And in continuing, hee sheweth that of drunkennesse, ensueth whore∣dome and other mischiefes. Whoredome is noted, when he saieth, Thine eyes shal looke vpon strange women, So that by such loking, one commeth to soile and pollute himselfe, as is seene by common experience, and we haue many examples thereof: as of the children of God, of Sichem, of Iuda, & Thamer, of the wife of Iosephes mai∣ster, and of Dauid and Bethsabee. And though the effect folow not, yet such lookes are notwithstanding vnchast, and it is whoredome. The other mischiefes that folowe dronkennesse, are marked, when he saith, And thine heart shal speake lewde thinges. He attribu∣teth pronunciation to the heart, because of the abundance of the mischieuous and wicked infection of the same, the mouth speaketh Gen. 6. 2. & 34. 1. 2. & 38. 15. & 39 7. 2. Sam. 11. 2. Mat. 5. 28. thinges infected and filthie, wicked and vniust: and the other mem∣bers are forced to doe thinges contrarie to al honestie, and religion iustice, and righteousnesse. Then seeing it is a verie dangerous thing to giue ones selfe to whoredome and other mischiefes which pro∣ceede of drunkennesse: It foloweth wel, that drunkennesse is verie perillous, as alreadie hath bene seene: and yet Solomon setteth be∣fore vs some danger, saying.
34 And thou shalt be as hee that sleepeth in the heart of the sea, and as he which sleepeth in the toppe of the Mast. To shew the great danger wherin drunkards put themselues, hee compareth them to those, which haue no regarde to the perils of the sea, nor thinke on them. And although they be in the heatt, or midst of the sea, verie farre from the shore, and likewise in the highest part of the ship, as in the toppe of the Mast, exposed to the windes, yet neuerthelesse, through the litle care that they haue, they let themselues fal a sleepe: and so the tempest rising and raging, hur∣leth them downe easily without al remedie. So they which perse∣uer, and fal a sleepe in dronkennesse, fal and perishe not in the depth of the sea, but in the gulphe of hel: for they are depriued of the kingdom of God. And in tarying til suche destruction happen them, they are tossed with many mischiefes: to the which they haue no re∣garde as they ought, and thinke not that thee doe betide them for their drunkennesse, so dul and blockish they are made by ouermuch drinke. Whereto they are so much addicted, that what euil soeuer they indure, yet they purpose no way to absteine, but rather to per∣seuer in excessiue drinking. Solomon setteth foorth suche blockish∣nesse and lewde affection, when he saith, 35 Then shalt thou say, They haue stricken me, but I was not sicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I shal awake, I wil put my selfe forth, and seeke it stil. Although we adde heere, Then shalt thou say, To declare that it is a drunkardes talke to say, They haue striken mee, &c. Yet ne∣uerthelesse, Solomon expoundeth to vs heere, rather the disposition and affection of drunkardes, then these wordes. They are so trans∣posed by the wine, that they fal asleepe so soundly and so deepely, that although one thumpe them, tosse them, and torment them with great blowrs, or though they fal from high, yet they haue no hurt
thereby, nor feele nothing. They are so giuen to drinke excessiuely, that although they perceiue well that the wine hath done them hurte, yet neuertheles as soone as they are againe awake, they goe to seeke out good drinke, and to drinke agayne. And feeling them¦selues yl at ease with the wine which they haue drunke the day be∣fore, to heale themselues they say that they must haue a heare of the same dogge which bit them. In this we may see that drunkards are lesse sensible then brute beaste, for although they sleepe, yet one can come neuer so little neere them but they perceiue him: then much more will they feele him that toucheth them any way. One may see also that they are lesse reasonable: for beastes wil neyther touch Ose. 4. 11. Esai. 5. 11 Luk. 21. 34 Rom. 13. 13 Ephe. 5. 18 1. Thes. 5. 6 meate nor drinke, which they perceiue to be hurtful for them But whoordome, wine, and must, take away their heartes. Such drunkardes are wel woorthie of curses. And so it is not without cause that we haue many admonitions, by the which we are taught to folowe sobrietie, and flye gluttonie and drunkennesse. The xxiiii. Chapter. 1 BE not thou enuious against euel men, neither desire to be with them. IT is a temptatiō which greatly pres∣seth the feeble and weake, to desire the estate and condition of the wic∣ked, when the poore faithful see thē∣selues in affliction, and to bee as it were a despising and mocking stocke of men, and as the filth and skumme of the worlde. And therfore they haue great neede to be often admo∣nished to be patient: as also the holie Ghost is verie carefull to doe it in
many places of the scripture, as hath bene alledged heretofore: and it is not yet long ago since this matter was treated of. Yet notwith∣standing Pro. 23. 17. for al this, Solomon knowing that wee haue great neede to be awaked, and restrained from suche temptation, letteth not to admonishe vs of the same, saying, Be not thou enuious, &c. Those which hee called sinners, hee nowe calleth according to the maner of his speech, men of malice, or euil men. Wherin one may see, that the sinners of whome he hath spoken, are not those which sinne by ignorance or infirmitie, or by lightnesse and vnaduisednes, but which of set purpose giue themselues to doe euil, and are so at∣tached with wickednesse, that al theire delight is therein, wee must not be enuious against suche men, nor desire to haue alliance or fe∣lowship with them: but rather flying them as a deadly pestilence, it behooueth vs to haue our heartes set on the feare of the Lorde al the day long, and by the same, to be content with our estate, be it poore, or be it riche, happie or miserable. If suche sinners and men of malice, or wicked men, haue temporal prosperitie, it is not of a good and iust getting, but rather by rauine, and outrage: because they haue payned & molested their neighbors, by wrongful wayes, as by fraudes, vsurie, theft, processe, and by other vnlawful meanes. Solomon expresseth it briefly, when he saith: 2 For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes speake molestation. Because the faithful ought to loue iustice and benignitie, (and indeede if we be true faithfulles, wee wil continually meditate iu∣stice and benignitie, whereto our wordes and our woorkes shalbee conformable, and we wil hate the contrarie, and flye from it.) For this cause Solomon yelding vs a reason, why wee should not be en∣uious against euil men, nor keepe company with them, attributeth to them an heart infected with euil thoughtes, and wicked affecti∣ons, when he saieth, That their heart imagineth rauine. And as they thinke wic∣kedly, so they execute it, as Solomon signifieth by the words of the lippes, saying,
And their lippes speake molestation. For as the wicked speake in wronging and threatning the innocent, so also they are ardent to pursue and put in practise their wicked thoughtes and determinati∣ons, and their threatnings, if they meete with no lets which keepe them from it. If hauing regarde to this reason, wee be not carefull to participate of the prosperitie of the wicked, nor make no account of their familiaritie and acquaintance, but flye from them, giuing ourselues to meditate the lawe of God, for to folowe it, and conti∣nue in the same, wee are blessed, and our prosperitie shalbe of long Psal. 1. 3. continuance, whereas that of the wicked shal passe away lightly. This is amplie expressed throughout al the 37. Psalme. When wic∣ked men imagine rauine, and molest others, they think to aduance themselues, and it seemeth them, that by this meanes they shall make a good house, and heape great riches together, which shalbe woorth much to them, whereby they shal haue their pleasures and delightes. But they are muche deceiued, as the foresaide Psalmes shewe it, and as was seene by experience at the flood, and in Sodom and Gomorra, in the land of Canaan, and in Babilon. And one seeth also (if he haue the patience to looke on it) that not only the goods of the wicked perishe, but also they themselues vade and vanishe away. Wherefore if wee wil haue goods which shal tarie by vs, and a house wel builded, firme and stable, wee ought to restraine al our senses from follie and wickednesse, and giue ourselues wholie to thinke and folow that, which God teacheth vs by his word, which is our wisedome and vnderstanding. Thus dooing, wee shal pros∣per in houses, and wealth, which shalbe of great value and plea∣sure, for as Solomon sayeth consequently, 3 The house shalbe built by wisedome, and established by prudence. 4 And by science shal the chambers bee filled, with al ri∣ches precious, and pleasant. For from the beginning God hath made al by wisedome, and
continueth to gouerne and guide, and also to establishe al thinges Pro. 3. 19. 20 & 8. 14. 28. 2. Sam. 7. 11. Psal. 127. 1 Deut. 28. 30 31. 32. by the same. This was wel giuen to vnderstande, by the Prophet Nathan to Dauid, saying, And the Lorde sheweth thee that the Lorde wil builde thee an house. Also Dauid hath wel vnderstoode it, as hath beene clearly shewed. Moyses gaue this wel to vnder∣stande to the children of Israel, when hee pronounceth the blessings of the Lorde vpon the obedient, and curses vppon the rebelles, and amongest other places, when he saieth, Thou shalt builde a house, &c. It behooueth vs therefore, to giue ourselues to wisedome by the obedience of the worde. And when wee haue goods, not to attribute them to our owne industrie and wisedome, nor to our owne desertes. For as wee can not merite that God may giue vs wisedome, so can wee not deserue that which commeth thereby. Wherevpon ensueth, that wee haue to acknowledge that al com∣meth from the liberalitie of our father, and for the same, giue him continual thankes. 5 The wise man is mightie, and the man of knowledge for∣tifieth his vertue. It seemeth that the fooles and wicked which are giuen to rauine and molestation, are mightie and strong, because that according to out∣warde apparance, they doe what they wil, and haue suche authori∣tie, that there is none which can nor dare resist them. And contra∣riwise, it seemeth that there are no kinde of people so weake, nor so miserable and abiect as the good and wise are. As they themselues are tempted, to thinke also when they regarde not but that which is present before their corporal eyes. But withdrawing ourselues from suche regarde, which is false and deceiueable, wee ought to beleeue in the spirite of al trueth, which speaketh to vs by Solomon and saieth, The wise man. &c. And so hee teacheth vs that wee ought not to constitute our power and might in thinges which are present vn∣to vs corporally, but in the wisedome and knowledge which wee learne by the worde. For also Solomon saieth not the man simplie, who of himselfe can not bee strong and fortified: But the wyse
man, and the man of knowledge. As if hee saide, It is by wisedome and knowledge, that a man is strong, and encreaseth more and more in force: not bodily force which is a verie smal thing, but force of the spirite, which consisteth in constancie and patience, which sur∣mounteth al mundane force, and escapeth the dangers wherein the strong men of the worlde perishe. This same was seene at al times in Noe, and the Giants which were of his time, in Moyses, and Pharao: In Ioseph, and his maistresse: In Daniel, and his enuyers: In Dauid and Saule, and in many others: as in the Prophetes and their enemies: the Apostles, and their persecuters: and nowe in the poore faythful, and their aduersaries, which are the great sages of the worlde: as the Pope, and his Supposts, Kings, & their flatterers, and tormenters. Wherefore wee ought to vnderstande that wee shoulde not aspire to the puisance and force of this worlde, which maketh a man proude: and so of force hee must perish, seeing hee hath God for partie against him: but being feeble and abiect according to the worlde wee ought to fortifie ourselues in humilitie of spirite, and then wee shal haue the Almightie on our side. 6 For thou shalt make warre by good aduise: and safegard is in the multitude of counsellours. It is very needful for a man to bee wise and skilful: otherwise if warre rise against him, he hath no power or force which is woorth any thing. For as wee haue seene, power is in the wise man, and force in the skilful: without wisedome a man is not wel aduised, and despiseth al good counsel that one can giue him. And so, as hee is without power and force: euen so hee knoweth not on what side to turne him to fight with his enemie and ouercome him, or put him to flight, and keepe him that he hurt him not. But if a man by the conduct of wisedome and prudence, aduyse warily and neerely that which he hath to doe, and seeke to haue the opinion of men of good counsell, if warre aryse, or hee must begin it,
he shal knowe howe to guide it, as Solomon saieth, For thou shalt make warre by good aduise. And obtaine victorie, as Solomon signifieth, saying, And sauegard, &c. Abraham was a stranger in the lande of Canaan, and had no great might, according to outwarde apparance, and yet hee made warre by good aduise a∣gainst foure Kinges. Moses, Iosua, & some of the Iudges and Kings of Iuda haue made warre, by good aduise, to wit, according to the Gen. 14. 14 commandement of the Lorde: and haue not only escaped dangers, but also obtained victorie. Wherein we ought to learne, that if by the worde of the Lorde, we print in our heartes his feare, which is the beginning, or principal pointe of wisedome: if it chaunce that we must go foorth to battel, wee shal handle it wel. And although wee perishe, or die in the pursute, yet neuerthelesse wee sticke not to obteine victory ouer our enimies: the which Solomon calleth safe∣gard: for our fooes obteine not that against vs which they pretend: seeing wee perishe not for euer as they desire, but our soules are in consolation, and our bodies rest for a season in the dust, I say namely if it chaunce that they must goe out in battell, for it woulde not be good aduise nor counsel, if by ambition or couetousnesse to raigne and enlarge our limites, or for desire of reuenge, wee make warre as doe the great men of this worlde, which haue no true knowledge of God, and make no account to learne him by his worde. In the same only one findeth good aduise, and it is made common to vs by multitude of counsellours, as Moses, Dauid, Solomō, the Prophets, Iesus Christ and his Apostles, and also the great number of faythful ministers and teachers of the truth. If we wil beleeue them, we shal-be wise, and men of knowledge, we shal haue power and force, and by good aduise shal make warre when it shalbe needful, and not o∣therwise. And yet afore we insinuate ourselues therein, wee shal-bee carefull to restraine it: and as much as is possible and lawe∣full, wee shal searche the wayes of peace. As Saint Paule admoni∣sheth vs. If superiour powers doe not gouerne and guyde them∣selues, there is no good aduise, and by consequence, no safegarde, Rom. 12. 18. but destruction: for where no knowledge is, the people falleth. And if by good aduyse and counsell wee must make temporal Prou. 11. 14.
and bodily warre, by a further reason, when we haue strong, suttle, malitious, and cruel enemies, which are hurtful to vs, and seeke to suppresse vs, to make warre against them, wee haue neede of wise∣dome and skil, of power and force fortified with good aduise and counsels. For this cause Saint Paule seeketh wel to munite vs, as appertaineth, speaking of the preaching of the Gospel, wherein Christ is communicated, saying, That he teacheth euerie man in all wisedome, to the ende, to make euerie man perfect in Iesus Christ. We are also admonished to enterprise nothing rashly, but as it were Ephe. 6. 10. Col. 1. 28. Organs or instruments of our God, wee permit that he finishe his worke. 7 Wisedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he shal not open his mouth at the gate. There is not so wicked a man in the worlde which seeketh not to persuade himselfe that hee is an honest man, and there is none so foolishe, which esteemeth not himselfe wise: and yet neuerthelesse they are al naked of wisedome, neither wil they, nor can they attain thereto: for they are carnal, and she is spiritual: they are earthly, yea hellishe, and she is heauenly, yea, aboue the heauens, and there is none that can be partaker of her, but by the worde of God, the which is despised and reiected by fooles, and they haue no vnder∣standing thereof. This highnesse is signified to vs, when Solomon saieth, Wisedome is haughtie, &c. Wherein hee approcheth to that which Dauid saieth, Thy iudgements are farre from his presence, O Psal. 10. 5. & 92. 6. 7. Deut. 30. 11. Lorde, for thy lippes are great: and thy thoughts verie deepe, &c. But it seemeth to withstande that which Moyses saieth, That com∣maundement which I commaund thee to day, is not hid from thee, neither is it farre of, &c. For Moses speaketh to the people of Israel, whom he rebuketh of corruption, frowardnesse, and follie. The an∣swere is: That Moses in the first place speaketh properlie to them which yelde themselues easie to be taught, although his worde bee addressed to al the people. This is notorious by the promise, The Lorde thy God wil circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy suc∣cessours, &c. the which appertaineth not, but to the faithful and o∣bedient: as it behooueth vs well to vnderstande for the wicked
and obstinate are vncircumcized according as the scripture calleth Iere. 9. 25. Eze. 44. 7. Act. 7. 15. them. In that then, that one hath a circumcized heart, he yeldeth himselfe obedient to the Lorde, and his doctrine is easily found, and not otherwise. Also although that in the seconde place he addresse his speeche to al the people, reproouing them as is saide, yet not∣withstanding the reprehension or blame is laide properly against the stubborne & incorrigible, amongst whom were mingled the hum∣ble and obedient: and so they were somewhat polluted, and blot∣ted with the vice of the stubborne: not that God imputed it to them. Although therefore that the worde of God, which is our true wisedome and vnderstanding, is neere to them which yeelde themselues easie to be taught, yet shee letteth not to bee haughtie to the foole. And therefore hee cannot deuise of her, nor talke of her amongest men that are honest, nor in assemblies: but babbling muche of vaine thinges and wicked, amongst his commapions, hee is dumbe amongest the wise, for he can speake nothing which they allowe of. Solomon giueth it wel to vnderstande, saying, Where∣fore he shal not open, &c. In olde time men made assemblies at the gate, and helde there the seate of iustice, and the Prophetes went thither to pronounce that which God commanded them. And when by nature we are al fooles, and are neuer made so wise, but there is left in vs many relikes of follie, wee ought not to presume to thinke that we are fit to comprehende the wisedome of God in perfecti∣on: Iere. 17. 19. but hauing it in great admiration, we haue to holde our peace, and acknowledge our imbecillitie with Saint Paul, O the deepenes of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of God! howe vnsearchable are his iudgements, and his wayes past finding out? Rom. 11. 33. &c. 8 They shal cal him an imaginer of mischiefe, which thin∣keth to doe euil. Wee wil not that men haue an euil opinion of vs, nor that they speake euil of vs: and therefore they which are malicious, and practise to molest the innocent, or they which weigh it not, mani∣fest
not themselues incontinently what they are, for feare lest they should be letted to execute their enterprises: But thinke and deter∣mine a certeine time, that they may afterwardes put their counsels in effect: and to doe this same, they vse craftes and suttleties, by the which they thinke to persuade that they are honest men, what euil soeuer they doe: but their fruites by succession of time, disco∣uer them, and by the same, they shewe themselues to be imaginers of mischiefes. And therefore they deserue wel that one cal them so, for suche is their name, as Solomon pronounceth, saying. They shal cal him an imaginer of mischiefe. When it is so, that man seeth but the face, hee can not cal him imaginer of mischiefe, which hath but a certaine light thought in his heart, and putteth it not in execution. And therefore knowe we, that Solomon speaketh here of thoughtes, which are so associate with counsels, determinati∣ons, affections, and willes, that one can not, nor will not forbid to put them in effect. Whereupon also, hee deserueth to be called an imaginer of malice, as hee manifesteth himselfe to be: although hee striue by certaine faire wordes to giue to vnderstande the con∣trarie: but God discouereth them, and sheweth their hypocrisie and malice, mawgre their heartes. For although that willingly they commit euil, yea manifestly, yet neuerthelesse they woulde, that men shoulde knowe nothing thereof. For if one cal them by their name, they craue straight, that their honour may be repaired, and that hee may make them a large amendes: or els they are rea∣die to maintaine, and defende their honour by iniuries and outra∣ges, by violence, & oppression. And so against their consciences, they reuenge themselues wrongfully against them that say the trueth. 9 The thought of a foolish person is sinne: and the moc∣ker is in abhomination with men. Wee are naturally framed in suche sorte, that wee perswade ourselues, and wil haue other men to thinke that wee are wise and good. And therefore wee please ourselues in our owne
counsels and determinations, in our affections & willes, and make great account of the thoughtes of our heartes, as if they were good and righteous. But seeing we are fooles, and despise wisedom and instruction, and doe vtterly hate knowledge, reiecting al counsel, and correction, it is vnpossible that our thoughtes should bee such as wee esteeme them to bee, but of force they must bee altogether strake naught, what good intent or meaning soeuer we haue. Solo∣mon pronounceth it thus, saying, The thought of a foolishe person, is sinne. Whereupon ensu∣eth, that of ourselues wee cannot be acceptable to God, whome sinne displeaseth, bee it neuer so hidden. And so what faire shewe soeuer wee make before men, yet are we abhominable before God: and it is verie harde, yea vnpossible, that by succession of time, in continuing in follie, our spirite become not so proude and malici∣ous, that wee cannot endure to haue any man reforme vs, but take pleasure to resist openly al discipline & correction. In this maner we shalbe also abhominable before men, as Solomon pronounceth it, saying, And the mocker is in abhomination with men. When he spea∣keth so, he sheweth principally the lesson to them which haue the sworde in hande, and telleth them that they ought to punishe the mockers and contemners of al religion, which are past correction. And afterwardes hee sheweth the common people, that they shal take heede of suche men, and flie them as an euident plague, and likewise procure to haue them rooted out, to the ende they corrupt not others. Otherwise if we spare them, we make Solomon a lyer, as muche as we can, for we haue them not in abhomination: and so we are not men, but beasts without reason, and without zeale to∣wardes God, and his religion, and without pitie and compassion to∣wardes the simple and ignorant, who may bee easily corrupted by suche mockers. 10 Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy ver∣tue is feeble.
Wee haue alwaies good courage when wee haue none to re∣sist vs, and when we are at our ease, and al thinges happen to our wishe, and we dare wel vaunt ourselues that wee are strong and va∣liant, and we dare also promise ourselues, when we are far enough off from the blowes, that there is no aduersitie so great, which can breake or abase our vertue, so that wee shal not pursue our enter∣prises manfully. But as experience sheweth it, man braggeth of that which hee cannot bee: Beholde the children of Israel in the desert of Sinai. Answere, That hauing good courage, wee wil doe all that which the Lorde hath commanded. But afterwardes, when they had not the thinges that they desired, they lost their courage, and murmured. When S. Peter saw not the army against Iesus Christ, hee seemed to bee very valiant: but seeing the sturre that they kept Exo. 19. 8. afterwardes hee lost courage, and denied his maister: Those which doe the like, shewe wel that they are diminished of vertue, as also Solomon pronounceth it, saying, Art thou negligent, &c? For they which are vertuous indeede, haue care to mainteine themselues, what tribulation soeuer they haue. To doe this wel, it is necessary that wee knowe certainly that al things come to passe, not by chance, nor by the wil of any creature, bee it heauenly, earthly, or infernal, but by the eternal pro∣uidence of God, which is immutable, bee wee certaine and assured that hee loueth vs, and therefore what tribulation soeuer happen to 1. Cor. 10. 13 vs, bee it neuer so greeuous, yet he will not forsake vs, but wil apply al his power to defende our cause: for hee is faithfull, and wil not suffer vs to bee tempted aboue that wee bee able, &c. Also to keepe wel that our vertue waxe not feeble, let vs not tarry too meditate these thinges vntil the trouble bee come vppon vs, but let vs watch at al times, foreseeing calamities, as Iesus Christe admonisheth vs Mat. 24. 42. Mar. 13. 33. Ephe. 6. 10. thereof, and arme ourselues with the harnesse of God, as S▪ Paule biddeth vs. 11 Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preserue them that are led to be slame? God hath giuen many commandements by the which he she∣weth Gen. 9. 6. Deut. 24. 14 that hee wil that the wicked be not spared, but that they bee
put to death. Then sith that the commandements of God bee such, Exod. 21. 12 Num. 35. 16 Deut. 13. 8. Rom. 13. 1. it foloweth that we ought to obay them, and that we shoulde in no case let them to bee executed. And likewise he hath ordeined supe∣riour powers to be his ministers, and shewe vengeance and yre vp∣on them which doe euil. And they which resist this, resist the ordi∣nance of God. Wherefore it might seeme at the first shewe that Solomon repugned the lawe and the ordinance of God, when hee saith, Deliuer them that are drawen to death, &c. The answere is that as God wil yeeld death to the wicked and that the magistrates punish them, yea with death if the cace require it: Euen so hee will that one haue pitie of the innocent, and that wee suffer none to doe them violence, but deliuer them from the handes of those that oppresse them and vexe them: this is first the office of them which are placed in preheminence, and holde the seate of iustice. Moses vnderstoode it wel as one may see it by the Sermon of Saint Ste∣phen, and therefore hee smote the Egyptian. Also the Lorde raised vp to the people of Israel many iudges, for to deliuer and saue thē Act. 7. 23. Exod. 2. 11. 12. Psa. 82. 2. Esay. 1. 23. from the hands of those, which molested and vexed them, as one may see by the booke of Iudges. And God sheweth Iudges wel that such is their office, when he reprehendeth them for the fauour that they beare to the wicked, and commandeth them to doe right to the miserable, and Orphan, &c. It is secondly the office of euery one of vs, in asmuch as hee can, not vsurping the authoritie of the Magistrate, or resisting him, which turneth to a scandale, and euil example. It is also to euery one of vs that God speaketh. Washe yourselues then, bee yee cleane, take away the euil of your workes, from before myne eyes, &c. Doe iustice and iudgement, and deliuer Esay. 1. 16. Iere. 22. 3. him which is oppressed, from the handes of him which wrongeth him. But it is chiefly the office of Magistrates, which are placed in the seate of God, who attributeth to himselfe this office of deliue∣ring. Also the scripture calleth him the only Sauiour, and by good right: for they which deliuer their neighbours from oppression, are Gen. 15. 13. 14. Psa. 50. 15. Esa. 49. 25. 26. but the Organs, & instrumēts of this great Sauiour, who doth this honor to his creatures, to constitute thē in his place: meanewhile (as it is said (euery one of vs ought to apply himself to aide the oppres∣sed
not going aboue, nor against the magistrate, no although he ex∣ercise tyranny, Dauid shewed it wel, when hee suffered not that they shoulde trouble Saule, which was a wicked man, and woulde not himselfe trouble him, although hee were the annointed of the Lorde. Iesus Christ also sheweth it wel to Saint Peter. Notwith∣standing 1. Sam. 24. &. 26. Math. 26. 52. this is not to say that one shoulde not resist and stande a∣gainst vniust and cruell magistrates, but then the swoorde that they shoulde vse must bee spiritual, to wit, the worde of God, which the Prophetes and Apostles vsed in admonishing, reprehending and threatening by the same those kinges and princes of the earth, which were wicked and cruel: this is the way that they shoulde vse which are not in authoritie to deliuer those which are drawne to death. 12 If thou say, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pon∣dereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderstande it? and hee that keepeth thy soule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee also recompence euery one accor∣ding to his workes? Saint Paule warneth vs that wee should not euery one regard the thinges which are our owne, but also those which are other mens, and complaineth greatly that al men seeke the thinges that are Phi. 2. 4. 21. their owne, and not those of Iesus Christe. which complaint may bee vttered almost to al kinges, princes, and magistrates of the earth which are led by ambition, and care not but to make themselues great, and make no account to minister true iustice, they force not if the innocent, the poore and feeble, bee oppressed. For although the wrong which men doe to the innocent bee wel knowne vntoo them, and that the bruite thereof bee spread al abrode, yet neuer∣thelesse as though they were blinde, and deafe, they make semblant to know nothing therof, if one come not and make great plaints to thē, and furnish thē out with money to make information of that which they knowe wel enough. And yet to fauour the wicked the more, they wil not informe themselues as they ought. They which can speak of it best, & which would tel the truth shal not be heard, nor they wil not examine them, and yet they wil bee so impudent
Lyers that they wil say, wee haue inquired diligently, but wee can∣not finde it so as they report it, they may wel make excuses before men, to appeare honest: but that wil serue them but for more con∣demnation before God, who knoweth al, and can wel at time con∣uenient render ech one his hyre. Therefore let no man make him∣selfe blind nor deafe: but let euery one according to his power de∣liuer his neighbor from the violence, and oppression which is doone to him, & let vs not seeke to finde excuses, when we haue not doone our dueties as wee ought: for it is not good that wee should striue to deceaue God with our falshood, no although it coulde bee, yet we shoulde not wil it. Solomon telleth vs that we should not make excuses when he saith, If thou say, behold, we knewe not of it. This is as though hee saide, thou shalt not say, wee haue not knowne this same. And by & by hee sheweth vs by three reasons that wee ought not to vse suche excuse, & that it wil serue vs to no purpose. And to giue these three reasons he maketh three interrogations, the first is, He that ponde∣reth the heartes, doth not hee vnderstande it? Hee speaketh heere briefly, but it is conformable to that which is treated more at length els where. It is therefore a friuolous excuse to say that they knowe not the violence & oppressiō which their neighbor endureth, when Psa. 94. 5. 11 Esay. 29. 15. Pro. 16. 2. & 21. 2. they knowe it, and are bounden to know it. If men receiue such ex∣cuse, yet God, which pearceth the heartes and trieth them, and dis∣cerneth the thoughtes and affections be they neuer so deepe, vnder∣standeth wel that such excuse is wicked. And so hee argueth by the knowledge of God, which is certaine and infallible, and whereto nothing is hid, be it neuer so secrete, wherefore it is not meete to thinke that we can deceaue him, neither ought we to wil it, though it were in our power, but wee shoulde honour it, and haue it in ad∣miration, as Dauid admonisheth vs. And wee ought to keepe our¦selues Psal. 139. 6. & 73. 11. wel from saying as the wicked doe, Howe doeth God know it? and, there is no knowledge in the Lorde. Solomon by this first reason signifieth that they which say that they haue not knowne the violence and wrong which is doone to their neighbours, speake in their heartes as these wicked doe. And so they attribute ignorance to God, and by consequence deny that hee is God. The second rea∣son is, And he that keepeth thy soule, &c. It is not a thing which we
ought to bee certaine of, that God hath care ouer his creatures, and likewise hee keepeth the wicked, otherwise they would be soone de∣stroied, for the Diuel seeketh but the destruction of men, and soone taketh and deuoureth that which God hath doone withal. And therefore the holy Scripture attributeth to the Lorde the title of keeper, and sauiour: as also it is good reason: for there is none o∣ther but hee: Then seeing it is so that God is the keeper of soules, it followeth, that there are neither thoughts nor affections in the same soules, but hee knoweth them wel: as also Solomon noteth it when he asketh saying. Knoweth hee it not? as if hee saide one ought in no wise too doubt that God which keepeth the soules, knoweth not those excu∣ses of thē which say, that they haue not knowne the afflictiō of their neighbours to bee friuolous and vaine leasings. Hee dispoileth them therefore of excuse, and also taxeth them of ingratitude towardes God. For seeing that God which keepeth their soules, recōmendeth to them the soules of their neighbours, they acknowledge not wel the grace that God hath doone them, when they are not careful to deliuer their poore neighbours, as the Lord demandeth it, and not content heerewith they lye, not onely to men, but also to God, as Solomō signifieth it by the present interrogatiō. But to the end that we be not abused thinking that Solomon speaketh heere of a perpe∣tual keeping: knowe wee that often God keepeth the wicked tem∣porally, for the health and prosperitie of his elect, as one may see by the kinges of the Persians and Medians, which were idolaters and infidels, and by their handes God hath giuen deliuerance to his Tim. 8. 1. people of Israel: And Saint Paule wil that wee pray for suche men, mean while if they remaine obstinate, euerlasting destruction is pre∣pared for them, and they are kept for the same. The thirde reason is, and wil not he also recompence? &c. In the first, and in the seconde reason, hee argueth by the diligence and care of the Lorde, and also by his knowledge and goodnesse: and nowe in this thirde reason Rom. 2. 5. hee argueth by the same thinges: for if God were ignorant and negligent, and if hee were slouthful and il willing, bee coulde not re∣compence euery one according to his workes. Neuerthelesse hee argueth principally by his iustice, for it is the office of a iudge to doe right to euery one, rewarding eche one according as hee knoweth
him to haue doone, punishing the wicked, and preseruing the good not that the good, bee they neuer so good, may merite that God may benefite them, but of his pure grace and liberalitie, and mercy, hee accepteth their workes, although they bee vnperfect, and rewar∣deth them according to his free promises, and according to his eter∣nal election. But to the wicked which are obstinate and harde harted, hee rendereth them the hyre which they haue deserued, o∣uerthrowing them in his yre and vengeance. Let them therefore that seeme not to see the oppression which is wrought too their neighbours, not looke to escape vnpunished. And if we ought to be careful to preserue the temporal life of our neighbours, by farre more reason wee ought to be diligent to deliuer them from death & damnation eternal as much as in vs lyeth, which thing wee shall doe by sound doctrine, warnings, exhortations, corrections, threat∣nings and chastisements. 13 My sonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is sweete to thy mouth. It is a thing notorious and wel knowne by experience that ho∣ny is good, and the hony combe very sweete in tast. Also the holy scripture, being willing to drawe vs to take the tast and sauour of spiritual things, as in the worde of God, (which is our true wisdom and vnderstāding) compareth them to hony, & to the hony combe, notwithstanding preferring the spiritual before the terrestrial, as is very good reason. Also now when Solomon saith, My sonne, eate hony, &c: It is not to commande vs or ad∣monish vs to eate hony sooner then other good meates: for he hath not written his sentences for the care that he had of our bodies: but his intent was to instruct our spirites and our vnderstanding. And therefore note wee that hee speaketh so, to make a comparison, the which hee addeth consequently, when he saith. 14 So shall the knowledge of wisedome bee vnto thy soule, if thou finde it? and there shalbe an end, and thine hope, shall not bee cut of.
To prooue and try the goodnesse and sweetnesse of wisedom, & to haue ioy therof, it is not ynough to haue the knowledge of it. So∣lomon sheweth it wel, when he is not contēt to say, that the know∣ledge of wisdom shalbee sweete & good to the soule as hony: but he addeth a condition saying, If thou find it, &c. To enioy there∣fore the goodnes & sweetnes of wisedom, it behoueth vs to finde her. And for to finde her: it behoueth vs to search her diligently: as Solomon warneth vs therof heeretofore. And he hath declared the Prou. 2. 1. & 3. 13. goodnes & sweetnes of her. But one may say that those which are wise after God, & after his word, are ordinarily euil handled, & en∣dure many vexations and molestations. For this cause it may seeme that there is no goodnes nor sweetnes in wisedome, but rather bit∣ternes. Answere. Solomon attributing goodnes & sweetnes to wis∣dome, exempteth not the wise from afflictions & miseries: but hee sheweth that they should not be grieued therat, but beare it out pa∣tiently, for they shalbe of no long indurance. Hee signifieth it when he saith, and there shalbe an end, &c. Nowe that hee meaneth the end of tribulations, he sheweth it wel when he addeth, And thyne hope shal not bee cut off. For hope is linked to patience, the which proceedeth of tribulation. Wee glorifie ourselues in tribulation, knowing that tribulation ingendreth patience, & patience experi∣ence, & experience hope. If we hope for that which we see not, wee looke for it by patience. Although therfore that the wise because of their wisedom, endure outwardly greate euils & bitter: yet neuer∣thelesse Rom. 5. 3. 4. & 8. 25. they sticke not to feele the goodnes and sweetnes of wise∣dom: for hoping that their tribulations shalbe of no long endurāce, and that finally by wisedom they shal obtaine great reward they re∣ioice themselues, according as Iesus Christ biddeth thē. Wherefore Mat. 5. 10. 11. 12. Iam. 1. 1. 12. being trulie instructed in the word of the Lorde, which is the true wisdom, let vs say with S. Paule, We wil not faint: but although our outwarde man bee corrupted, yet the inwarde man is renew∣ed day by day, &c. And to say so truelie, let vs take heede to 2. Cor. 4. 16. Prou. 23. 17. 18. will to flee afflictions, in following wickednesse: according as Solomon warneth vs thereof, making vs the same promise that hee nowe doeth. Note wee moreouer that it is not without cause that I haue sayde, that for to try the goodnesse and sweetenesse of wisedome, and to enioy the same, it is not
ynough to haue knowledge thereof, if we doe not finde it. For ma∣ny are lightned with the knowledge of trueth, which is the true wisdome (as are they which receiue the seede, by the hye way, or in stonie places, or amongst thornes) and yet neuerthelesse they finde not wisedome, neither yet prooue of what goodnesse or sweetnesse she is: but after such knowledge they are in worse estate then afore. Such men haue had the knowledge of wisedome, but they haue not founde her, because they haue not set their minde and affection thereon: which it behooueth them to doe that wil finde her, and haue the true ioy of her goodnesse and sweetenesse. Wherein wee may vnderstande that it is not ynough to bee illuminate with the knowledge of trueth: but that wee ought to bee regenerate and made newe creatures to walke in newnesse of life. Beholde, Iudas the traytour knewe the trueth, but he was not regenerate: and ther∣fore Mat. 12. 43. 2. Pet. 2. 20. Prou. 2. 3. he hath not founde wisedome, neither did hee enioy her good∣nesse, and sweetnesse. 15 Lay no wayte as a wicked man, against the house of the righteous: and spoyle not his resting place. As the wicked are neuer in peace, first in their consciences: Se∣condly, without, because they haue not such prosperitie as they de∣sire: euen so, asmuch as is possible for them: they put the good & iust to trouble, wast and destructiō. And to doe this same, they haue craftes and cautels, subtil wayes and fetches, outragious and vio∣lent, vngodly, and cruel. Solomon signifieth the crafts that they goe about by laying of waite, and the outrages, and violences, by spoy∣ling when he saith. Lay no waite as a wicked man, &c. Wherein wee haue to note that wee esteeme that, which is gathered togither in the house or resting place, to bee in suretie, and commonly there is that which is best and most precious. Also we ourselues drawe thither to be in couert and safetie. Wherfore knowe wee that Solomon forbidding vs to lay waite as the wicked against the house of the righteous, signifieth that the wicked spareth not the iust a whit, but doeth him
the greatest damage that he can, and the most trouble that is possible and when in this point hee woulde not haue vs too bee like vnto him, hee admonisheth vs, that (as much as wee can) wee put our neighbours, and their goods in safetie, and let them liue in rest and peace, not seeking any way to trouble them. And although hee name but the iust, yet this is not to say that it is lawful for vs to doe damage, or trouble, or molest them, which wee know to be wicked: but he forbiddeth namely the iust, because the wicked wil rather do it to the iust then to their likes: And also because by our nature we resemble God, which when they see any little curre to bee assayled, they al runne vppon him: So doe they commonly against the iust, which are the most weake and feeble before the worlde. This si∣militude is not vnproper, as it appeareth by the complaint which Psal. 22. 17. 21. Dauid maketh, and by his prayer. Now the feeblenesse of the iust is wel marked, when Solomon attributeth to them one onely little house, and not a realme wel defended, nor a strong castle: And when hee attributeth to them resting place, and not chambers wel gar∣nished with Tapestrie, and beddes of Parament. Meane while what feeblenesse soeuer bee in the iust man, Solomon wil not that wee lay wayte against him, to trouble him, and put him to destruction: as the wicked striueth to doe, to the ende hee may make himselfe great, mightie and rich by the destruction of the iust man. But the wicked abuseth himselfe farre, and wee also, if wee bee of his opini∣on, and followe his order of doinges, for it is vnpossible to ruinate, and destroy the iust, and the wicked cannot stande, but destroyeth and vndoeth himselfe by his awaites and practises. Solomō signfieth wel this same, saying, 16 For the iust man falleth seuen times, and riseth againes but the wicked fall into mischiefe. Although the wicked are hote to pursue the iust, and neuer ceasse to afflict them, to ruinate and destroy them, and that often∣times the iust bowe vnder the burden, insomuch that it seemeth that they are dispatched, and past remedie, as likewise they them∣selues Psal. 18. 5. 6. & 22. 3. 4. & 44. 10. are tempted to thinke, as one may see by the complaintes of
the holy ones in the scripture, yet neuerthelesse they bee not abased nor ouerthrowne, according to the desire of the wicked, but as, se∣uen times, that is to say, often, they fal: euen so they rise againe and recouer their falles, not by their owne proper vertue, but by the aide of God, which heareth the complaints of the holy. Contrari∣wise although the worlde fauour the wicked, and susteine them, and Psal. 3. 5. & 6, 9. 10. & 18 7. &. 22. 24. 25. & 34. 18 that they themselues mainteine themselues wel, as it seemeth too them, and that they thinke and say in their heartes, that no euil wyll euer come to them: yet neuerthelesse the euil which they worke a∣gainst the innocent, ouerthroweth and destroieth them, so that they can neuer rise againe, Solomon pronounceth it in briefe, when hee saith, But the wicked fall into mischiefe, or by mischiefe: to wit, that which they imagine, and worke. And it is that which is saide, Be∣holde, hee trauelleth to bring foorth iniquitie, and hath conceaued affliction, but wil bring foorth lying. Hee hath digged a pit, and Psa. 7. 15. & 9. 15. made it hollow, but hee is falne into the ditch which he hath made, &c. The Heathen are sunke into the pit which they haue made, &c. And so the ruine of the wicked is mortal, and without recoue∣ry, but there is remedy for the iust mans fal. Wherefore when wee are in affliction and aduersitie, and wil knowe if wee may bee deli∣uered and raised vp from the same, let vs take good heede to put our affiance in God our father, and assure ourselues, that he loueth vs, for the loue of his sonne Iesus Christe, and giue ourselues to yeelde obedience to his commandementes. Thus doing, wee are on a sure grounde that God accepteth vs for inst: and therefore hee wil not suffer vs to perish in our afflictions, but wil raise vs vp againe. Some expounde the two former sentences otherwise, to wit, as though Solomon spake to the wicked, saying, Let it suffice thee to bee wic∣ked, entangle not the iust man with thee in thy wickednesse. Put no lets before him, seeke not occasion to slaunder him, nor trouble not his rest. Prouoke not the anger of God against thee, who loueth the iust, and restoreth the decayed. Take no pleasure in the fal of the iust man, for hee falleth oftē, because he is enuironed with the infir∣mitie of the flesh, And there is not a iust man on earth, which doth good and sinneth not. But the iust sinne somtimes greeuously. And God permitteth it to the ende that being brought lowe, they may
loue him more feruently, and may become better aduised, and more gentle to their neighbours. The iust man in falling, looseth not his faith, hee acknowledgeth quickly his fault, and repenteth inconti∣nent: and al and euery time that hee falleth hee riseth againe. Hee falleth not to deth, because the Lord holdeth him vp with his hand, God suffereth him to fal, but not to lye there stil. But the wicked fal in their mischiefe. Their fal serueth them to no good: for they repent not, nor they conuert not, nor haue no remorse: They are na∣ked of confidence, and perseuer in their wickednesse. And likewise, that which is good, turneth not them to good. Now although such sense conteine good doctrine, yet the first is better for the woorde which Solomon vseth, which signifieth to fall, is hardly founde in the Scripture, for, to sinne, but stil to suffer aduersitie. 17 Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he stumbleth. It is saide, that God hath not made death, and that he taketh no Sapi. 1. 13 Ezeh. 18. 32 & 33. 11. Esay. 59. 2. Rom. 5. 10 Col. 1. 21 pleasure to see the liuing perishe, and it is conformable to that which the Prophet Ezechiel saith, I couet not the death of him that dieth, saith the Lorde, &c. I am liuing, saith the Lorde, I couet not the death of the infidel, but that hee conuert from his way, and liue. Nowe when it is so, that by our sinnes wee are enimies to God, hee declareth and sheweth himselfe very merciful, when hee seeketh not our destruction, but calleth vs to him againe, & giueth vs accesse by Iesus Christ his sonne, by whome hee hath reconciled vs to him, to giue vs life and saluation for euer. And as hee is such a one towards vs, who are his enimies by nature (for the affection of the fleshe, is enmitie against God) euen so wil hee that wee be pitiful and chari∣table towards them which are our enimies: as he declareth it vnto Ro 87. 8. vs sufficiently by the benefites which he sheweth vpon vs dayly, of the which we are not once worthie. But not content herewith be∣cause we are as it were blinde, dul, and sluggish, not caring to consi∣der his meruellous workes, ful of great benignitie and bountie, hee declareth it vnto vs by his worde. He hath also declared it vnto vs
by examples, as of Ioseph towards his brethren: of Dauid towards Saul: of Iesus Christ towardes mankinde, and very manifestly to∣wardes Exo. 23. 4. 5. Leui. 19. 17. 18. Mat. 5. 44 Rom. 12. 17. them which put him to death: and of S. Stephen towards his persecutours. And therefore it ought to bee manifest that it is not without cause that Solomon admonisheth vs saying, Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth, and let not thine heart reioyce when he stumbleth. And as it is manifest vnto vs, e∣uen so wee ought to followe it: otherwise wee are not the chil∣dren of God our heauenly father, which maketh his Sunne shine on the good, and on the euil. But some wil say, that the children of Israel sang a songue to the Lord for the destruction of Pharao, and Mat. 5. 45 Fxo. 15. 1. Ind. 5. 1. Psal. 9 18 & 3. 8▪ Esay. 1. 24. his people. And Debora, & Barac sang to the Lorde for the discōfi∣ture of their enimies. And Dauid reioyced at the fal of his enimies. And God saide, I wil solace my selfe with my aduersaries, & reuenge mee on mine enimies: and therefore that it is laweful to reioyce at the fal of the enimie. I answere, That wee may reioyce at the fall of our enimies, when it serueth to the glory of God, and that by the same fal, wee learne to feare the Lorde, and magnifie him, and exalt him. But if wee haue regarde to followe our proper iniuries, and search our particular profite, if wee mingle our affections ther∣with, which are ordinarily il gouerned: and if because we loue our¦selues, wee are the swifter to reioyce at the ruine of our enimies, our ioy is not righteous. And also it is that which Solomon forbid∣deth vs in this present. 18 Least peraduenture the Lorde see it, and it displease him, and hee turne his wrath from him. Hee putteth foorth to vs three reasons to restraine vs from the ioy and pleasure that one taketh in the fal and stumbling of his enimie. The first is, that God seeth it: whereon they thinke not, which reioyce in the euill of their enimies: neither wil they because in pleasing themselues, they proceede with an euil consci∣ence, bearing hate & rancor against their enimies, & because it see∣meth to thē that they are wel reuenged of thē, whē they see that the
euil hapen to them which they wished for. And therefore they thinke not in their thoughts that God seeth them, although it bee so, for al thinges are plaine and manifest to the eies of the Lorde, yea afore their being: as also Solomō knew wel, but he saith, Least peraduenture, &c. for they which set not God before their eies as they ought, regard not the care and prouidence, the knowledge and vnderstanding of the Lord: but attribute al to fortune and chaunce, And so hee speaketh according to the sense and apprehension of worldlings and carnal men: and in the meane whyle telleth vs that God knoweth al our thoughts, although we think it be not so. See∣ing then that wee will not haue God to see the pleasure that wee take in the fall of our enemies, let vs haue pitie and compassion on their fal, helping to raise them vp againe asmuch as wee can. The se∣cond reason is, that such ioy is wicked in the Lordes sight, that is to say, displeaseth him, for it is contrary to the lawe of charitie, the which is agreable to him aboue al things, as he sheweth it wel, whē he declareth that he wil haue mercy and not sacrifice. And also they which reioyce in the fal of their enimies are cōuinced in their owne consciences, that they are replenished with hate, in that of determi∣nate malice they take pleasure in other mens harmes: and so in spite of their heads, they condemne themselues. The third reason is, that God wil turne his wrath from him, that is to say from the enimie, in whose fal wee take pleasure. And in this manner hee which ta∣keth pleasure in the fal of his enimie, shalbe confounded, seeing God wil pacifie him, & raise him vp in his fal: for commonly the enui∣ous, which reioyce in the harmes of other men, and are greeued at their prosperitie, are confounded, when they see it happen wel to them whom they hate. For the rest: let vs know that Solomon she∣weth vs heere somewhat, that aduersities, ruines, and desolations come to men because of their sinnes: for God is not angrie with vs but because of our sinnes. And therefore if hee turne away his wrath, he pardoneth the sinnes. Note wee also, that seeing hee tur∣neth away his wrath from him, at whose harmes wee reioyce, that hee which hath such ioy, sinneth. And so the anger which is turned from his enimie falleth vpon him: wherefore let vs vnderstande that it is very daugerous to take pleasure in the fal of ones enimie.
19 Frequent not thy selfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked. Because it is a temptation very dangerous, and which greatly ouerpresseth the feeble and weake, Insomuch that it is very harde for them to keepe themselues from being brought into the same, that is, to search the familiaritie and acquaintance of the wicked be∣cause that they see them prosper with the eye according to outward apparance, and too bee vexed and greeued when they are not in so good estate as they are. For this cause, Solomon knowing the ne∣cessitie that we haue to be wel and often admonished, that we take no heede of the prosperitie of the wicked for to lust after it, and ad∣ioyne ourselues to them) is not content with these former admoni∣tions: but now agayne he admonisheth vs of the same, saying, Frequent not with &c. This is not to say, that we can exempt ourselues from the presence of the wicked: for the Darnel shalbe Pro. 1. 10. & 2. 12. & 3. 31. & 4. 14. & 23. 17 & 24. 1. 1. Cor. 5. 7. 2. Cor. 6. 14. Ephe. 5. 11. amongst the good wheat, euen to the consummation of the world: But that wee purge the olde leauen, that wee couple not ourselues with Infidels, and that we be not pertakers of the vnfruitful workes of darkenesse. Wherefore let vs reioyce when wee are often war∣ned of such thinges: seeing that otherwise wee goe vnto vtter de∣struction with the wicked. For by our nature wee are of the same affection that they are, and incline to their manners, and wil not be withdrawne thefro. Wee studie on the outwarde face tempo∣rall and transitory: wee regarde that ordinarily the wicked floorish and prosper, and it seemeth to vs that they are exempt from all dangers, al afflictions, and al aduersities, wherewith the iust are as it were ouerthrowne: insomuch that it seemeth they shal neuer re∣couer it. But the iust at the last shalbe raised vp, as they hope: for there shalbe an ende of their euils: as wee haue seene it. Contrariwise, wischiefes shal assayle the wicked of the which they shal neuer rid themselues, and shalbee ouerwhelmed there∣with, that there shal remaine no worke of their prosperitie, Solo∣mon Pro. 23. 18. & 24. 14. pronounceth it so, when hee saith.
20 For there shalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked shalbe put out. When heere before he hath said, that there shalbe an end for the iust and wise, which hope in the Lord, he meaneth not that they shal perish: but that their afflictions shal haue end, we haue to note, that when he saith, now that there shalbe no end of the euill man: hee meaneth not that the wicked shalbee permanent, and that their prosperitie shalbee of long indurance: but that there shalbee no end of the plagues which shal affaile them. Hee himselfe sheweth that wee shoulde vnderstande it so, when hee addeth, The light of the wicked shalbe put out. For by the light hee vnderstandeth the glory, the ease and prosperitie of them, as hath been saide aboue. 21 My sonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are disguised. Solomon sheweth vs heere the office of a good Pastour: for first hee calleth them, whō he teacheth, his sonnes. In that he propoun∣deth vnto them the worde of God, which is the seede of life, by the which he formeth and begetteth them to the Lorde, as much as is possible for him. Whereby Ministers ought to learne that their du∣tie is to take care ouer the flocke which is committed to them as o∣uer their children, yea to bee more careful of them: because the charge of them is more difficil, more great, & more excellent, then of carnal children, because the spirites are more excellent then the bo∣dies, and more harde to rule, guide, and gouerne. Secondly hee tea∣cheth that which God hath demanded at al times to bee honoured and serued as appertaineth to him, when he saith, feare the Lorde, &c. Now that at al times God hath demanded to be feared, it ap∣peareth first, when he woulde that Adam should obey his worde, & threatened him of death if hee did it not. Secondly, when Abel by faith offered Sacrifice, which was agreeable to the Lorde: and that Gen. 2. 17. & 44. 26. & 5. 24. & 69. in the time of Enoch sonne of Seth, men began to cal vpō the name of the Almightie, And Enoch walked according to God: and Noe was a iust and an vpright man, walking after GOD.
This coulde not bee, but that these men were taught in the feare of the Lord. Thirdly, when the Lord said that he knew that Abraham shoulde commande his children and his house after him, that they Gen. 18. 19. Deu. 4. & 6. & 10. Psal. 34. shoulde keepe the way of the Lorde, &c. Moses also sheweth it in his writings: as also doeth the Psalmist plainely and in many pla∣ces. Solomon hath greatly praised this feare, and hath inuited vs thereto: and yet presently admonisheth vs of the same. Then see∣ing wee see that the scripture speaketh so often of the feare of the Lorde, and that they recommende it to vs so carefully, knowe wee that it is the principal thing that God requireth of vs, for by the same wee are turned from al euill, and followe the good that hee commandeth vs. Knowe wee also, that wee are so obstinate and stiffnecked in our disobediences and rebellions, that it is great neede to mollifie our heartes by often admonitions of the feare of the Lord. Fourthly, because in this worlde, with religion, we haue need to liue in peace and tranquilitie to keepe ciuil order, Solomon tea∣cheth vs howe we ought to keepe it when he warneth vs too feare the king: not as the wicked criminals which feare the gibet more then the men of iustice, who are comprehended vnder the name of King, but as Saint Paule and Saint Peter teach vs. And so although Solomon ioyne the feare of the king, with the feare of the Lorde, Rom. 13. 1. Pet. 2. 13. yet neuerthelesse wee ought not to feare iudges and rulers as God, but according to God and for his sake: and wee ought to know that who so despiseth the Magistrate, hee hath no feare of the Lorde, but is disobedient and rebellious to him. Know wee also, that seeing the feare of the king is ioyned with the feare of the Lorde, that Magi∣strates are as assisters, or Liefetenants of God, that they ought to re∣present him, and haue his image so imprinted in them, that it may bee seene in their administration. And therefore when Solomon teacherh vs to feare the king, he sheweth couertly that mē of iudge∣ment ought to bee wise, vertuous, true, holy, and iust. Fiftly, because there are many which despise both God and the king, and scorne all religion and ciuil order, and that it is right dangerous to bee fami∣liarly conuersant with them, least one should bee in the way to re∣semble thē, for this cause Solomon forbiddeth vs their company and acquaintance, saying, Meddle not with them that are disguised. They which haue
not that apparel which they ought to haue, and weare that which is not conuenient for them, are disguised: and men cal them so. Now it behooueth vs al to be clothed & apparelled with the feare of the Psal. 2. & 5 Pro. 1. Lorde: as wee may vnderstande it by many places. They therfore which despise the feare of the Lorde, and of Magistrates, are by good right, called disguised. Some cal them vnconstant and mutable: and it is not without cause: for the worde that Solomon vseth, sig∣nifieth so. And also indeed, they which feare not the Lorde nor the Magistrate, are neuer firme in a good purpose, but turne to vanitie, follie, wickednesse, and dissolutions. For seeing that by the feare of the Lorde one refraineth from euil, and that it is the beginning or principal point of wisedome, it cannot be, but they which reiectit, must be vaine, foolishe, wicked, and by consequence, vnconstant and mutable. Others cal them seditious, because they reuolt from the commandement of God, and of the Magistrate, and doe the contra∣rie. Of suche men the acquaintance and familiaritie is verie dange∣rous, not onely because in folowing them, one is rebellious to the Magistrate, who beareth the sworde to punish corporally the rebels and seditious, but also hee is in danger to loose his soule: seeing that such disguised, vnconstant, and seditious, and with them, their adherents, goe to perdition sooner then they are aware of, or then they would, as Solomon sheweth it, saying, 22 For their destruction shal rise sodeinly: and who know∣eth the ruine of them both? Because we haue seene at al times, and yet doe see, that the wic∣ked contemners and scorners of God, and of al good policie, flou∣rishe and prosper, and that according to carnal sense, and humane apprehension, it seemeth that their glorie and triumphe indureth long. For this cause, if wee wil beleeue Solomon, or rather the holie Ghost (as we ought to doe) let vs renounce our sense and vanquish it, to the ende that it let vs not to knowe and vnderstande, that the wicked are not long in glorie, triumph, and prosperitie, but that straight way they come to perdition, and sooner then they or others can perceiue it, or knowe it. As Solomon signifieth, when he asketh, And who knoweth the ruine of them both? That is to say, of the
wicked, malicious, & peruerse, of whom he hath spokē here aboue, of the disguised, vnconstant, & seditious, of whō he hath also spokē: Or of the two, that is to say, of them which feare not God, and which feare not the Magistrate. Noe knewe not the ruine of the worlde by the flood to come, but that God reuealed it to him, and the worlde thought not of it: as Iesus Christ pronounceth it. Lot Mat. 24. 38. 3. Luk. 17. 28 19. Exo. 33. 5. Psal. 73. 18 19. Psal. 30. 12 13. & 47. 9 10. 11. Mat. 24. 44. 48. 1. Thes. 5. 2. 3 Psal. 9. 4. 5 2. Pet. 3. 8. Rom. 8. 18. 2. Cor. 4. 17 2. Thes. 1. 7 also looked not for the subuersion of Sodome to be so neere, nor the inhabitantes of the same. Solomon therefore speaketh truely, when he saieth, For sodeinly, &c. Hee speaketh according to the threatning of the Lorde, yee are a stifnecked people, I wil come sodein∣ly vpon thee, and destroy thee, &c. And to comprehend this wel, it behooueth vs not to regarde the space of time, wherein the wic∣ked prosper, but wee ought to consider and knowe, that al thinges be they neuer so farre off, are nowe present with the Lorde. Also it behooueth vs to beleeue, that as the sufferances of times present, are not worthie of the glorie to come (for our tribulation is of smal indurance and verie light, and bringeth foorth meruellously in vs a weight of eternal glorie) also the glorie, triumph, power, and ease of the wicked, their delightes and prosperities, are not of long in∣durance, and are nothing in respect of their ruine and perdition, which shalbe for euer. For the Lorde Iesus Christ shal appeare in heauen with the Angels of his power, and in flames of fyre: wor∣king vengeance on them, which knewe not God, &c. Who shall suffer payne, that is to wit, eternal perdition, &c. There is great difference betweene the longest space of time that men can imagine, and a perpetuitie which is incomprehensible to vs, insomuche as it hath no ende. Notwithstanding neither seeing it, nor com∣prehending it by our humane sense, and natural reason, it be∣hooueth vs to beleeue it: for God which is veritable, reuealeth it to vs by his worde. 23 Also these thinges appertaine to the wise: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements. Solomon heeretofore hath put foorth to vs many sentences so excellent, that we ought not, nor may not iudge, but that they are
proceeded from great wisdom: and as they are proceeded therefro, so they are also profitable to teache wisedome to them, which giue their mindes and willes theretoo, and take pleasure therein. Nowe although they be a great number, as wee haue seene, and that they ought wel to suffice to make vs wise, yet neuerthelesse Solomon ad∣ioyneth to them others, which are of no lesse wisedome then the former, as he declareth by a preface, saying, Also these thinges appertaine to the wise. That is, that the wise doe teache them, or that they are knowne to the wise. Hee vseth suche a Preface to awake vs, and shewe vs that wee ought not to be greeued for the great multitude of his Prouerbes, which are not superfluous, but verie profitable and necessarie: seeing that the wise approoue them, and teache them to make the simple and ignorant more wise. Nowe, that it is to awake vs, that hee vseth suche a Preface, it is manifest, when after the same, hee sayeth no newe thing, but that which Moyses taught long time afore: for it is saide, Leuit. 19. 15. Deu. 1. 16. 17 & 16. 19. It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgement. And this is agreeable to that which is saide in the lawe: seeing that GOD, which is onely good, yea al goodnesse, maketh suche an edict, it behooueth the wise to teach that it is not good to doe the contrarie: and that they which desire to bee, and shewe themselues wise, rest in the same, and beware to goe against it. Wherein we ought to learne, that it is meete for Kinges, Princes, Iudges, and gouernors of the earth to bee wise, seeing that it is to them principally that this edict is addressed, as they are the liefetenantes of God, who hath no acception of persons. As therefore God, regardeth not the state and condition of men, which is seene outwardly, whe∣ther they be male or female, strong or weake, poore or riche, skil∣ful or ignorant, simple or craftie, noble or vilaine, to doe right to euerie one, but hee iudgeth iustly: Euen so behooueth it the Superiours and Rulers of the earth to doe. Otherwise God which Esai. 1. 23. & 28. 14. Pro. 18. 5. & 19. 6. 7. hath appointed them goods on earth, wil take vengeance on them as they deserue, and as hee threatneth them thereof. Solomon therefore sayeth no newe thing, but that which Moyses hath taught, and hee himselfe heeretofore. But although we haue so many aduertisementes and threatninges of it, yet they cease not
to knowe faces: as Solomon complaineth. And as it is not meete to knowe faces, so is it not good that any man seeme to corrupt the Iudges, by gifts and brybes, by faire speech and flatteries, by honors and reuerences, by kindred and familiaritie: but that solicitating his businesse with modestie, and without greedinesse, hee attende with patience that which it shal please God to pronounce by the mouth of the Iudge. 24 Hee that sayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him shall the people curse, and the multitude abhorre him. It is a common thing in the worlde, that men flatter the wic∣ked, and haue them in admiration, that they esteeme them, and cal them honest, and that they are welcome euerie where, & haue such credite, authoritie and might, that if one blame them rightly, and for good cause, yet they shalbe constrained to vnsaie it againe, and make them some recompence for touching their honour, and holde them for honest men, if they wil not lye in prison continually, or els be banished. Whereby it seemeth wel (as it is true indeede) that they which holde vp the wickedes chinne, giue plainly to vnder∣stande, that they say to the wicked that they are iust. For in causing by their vniustice, that one repaire the honour of the wicked, they condemne the innocent, and iustifie the wicked. Then if it bee so, that men blesse the wicked, it may wel seeme, that they wil not curse those that iustifie them. And indeede, if wee regarde the outward apparance, and most common dealing, we shal finde that the wic∣ked Iudges, the false witnesses, and slanderers, are greatly praysed and honoured amongest al people and nations, and that men feare much to speake euil of them. And so according to our viewe, and humane sense, wee see not that accomplished which Solomon pro∣nounceth, saying, The people shal curse him, &c. One may see it come to passe, that they which suffer by the malice of wrongful Iudges, can not keepe themselues sometimes from murmuring against such Iudges, and that they must needes curse them. One may see also, that the holie seruantes of God, the Prophetes, cursed and pronounced mis∣chiefe
against wrongful Iudges. Yet neuerthelesse this present sen∣tence letteth not to be true: for though there be hardly founde any Deu. 27. 19. Esai. 5. 23. man, if hee be not verie impudent and bolde, which wil say to him, that he knoweth to be wicked, Thou art iust: but wil speake in his heart by the affection which hee hath to gratifie the wicked, and also by the workes which proceede of suche affection in wronging the poore and innocent, to pleasure the wicked. Also, although with worde of mouth one curse not him which iustifieth the wic∣ked, because they wil not bring themselues in hate with the migh∣tie and honourable, and be their enemie: yet neuerthelesse, there is none so ignorant, nor none so wicked, which is not conuinced in his conscience, that hee which iustifieth the wicked, is accursed, and detestable. There is also none but he wil say, that it is yl done to iustifie the wicked: and so by the iudgement of the conscience, and by a certaine natural light, The people curse, and the nations abhorre him which sayeth to the wicked, Thou art iust. Euerie one may iudge this in himselfe: for if hee thinke that one doeth him wrong to fauour his aduersarie, incontinently hee thinketh euil of his aduersaries fauourer: and if he thinketh himself strong enough, hee wil come and tel him his minde. But although most common∣ly men flatter the fauourers of the wicked, and dare not curse them as they deserue: yet by the iust vengeance of God it commeth to passe, that they pursue them as wicked and abhominable. And this is done by them, which haue had them in great reuerence, & haue liued and made good cheare at their dispence. Vproares, mutinies, dissentions, and seditions are mooued against them which fauour the wicked, deciding causes that men know manifestly to be wrong, and against the common sense of al equitie and lawe. In this ma∣ner, they shewe themselues violent, outragious, and tyrantes, and so they are insupportable. 25 But in them that rebuke him, hee shall haue pleasure: and vppon them shall come the blessing of good∣nesse.
As according to the common essence and ordinarie dealing of the worlde, we see not that men curse and haue in detestation the euil Iudges and gouernours which fauour and iustifie the wicked: euen so it is not ordinarie that one shoulde take reprehension in good parte, nor seeke to speake wel of them which argue and rebuke him, nor to doe them any good turne, but rather to hate and ab∣horre them: Lot hath prooued it: Moyses, Ioseph, and the Pro∣phetes Gen. 19. Exo. 2. 13. Gen, 37. Esai. 29. 20. 21. Amos. 5. 10. also, who make complaintes and threatninges for the same. Wee also prooue the like at this present, in some which vaunt them¦selues to be reformed according to the Gospel. For there is none that they hate more then them, which shew them the truth. Wher∣fore when Solomon saieth, But in them that rebuke him, he shal haue pleasure. Knowe wee that he speaketh not of the common vse of the worlde, but of the iudgement of the conscience, which none can flye, be he neuer so wicked and repugnant to the same. For see∣ing we iudge it weldone, to rebuke, chastise, & correct those which are of dissolute maners, we are ouercome in our owne heartes to take pleasure in them which rebuke vs, and to take it in good part, and to allowe of their zeale, and prayse their affection and studie. Nowe although the wicked iudge it so, wil they nil they: yet neuer∣thelesse they are greeued and vexed at corrections and reprehensi∣ons. And therefore they force themselues, as much as they can, to shake of the pleasure that they ought to take in those that rebuke them. And so it is principally of the good, wise, and iust, that Solo∣mon speaketh, when he saith, But in them that rebuke him, he shall haue pleasure. For as we haue seene, he that chastizeth the scor∣ner, Pro. 9. 7. 8. receiueth shame, &c. One might according to the opinion of some, say, that it is God who hath in fauour them which reprehend the wicked, as it is true indeed. For seeing hee commandeth by his worde, that one should reprooue and correct them which offend: it foloweth, that they which obey him in this, are pleasant agree∣able to him, and that hee loueth them, This exposition is verie agreeable to the promise folowing, And vppon them shal come, &c. For God rewardeth them largely, whome hee loueth and ac∣cepteth. The great largenesse is set downe, when Solomon is not content to say, Blessing shal come: But hee sayeth, Blessing of
goodnesse. Also wee can not obtaine any goodnesse, but by the liberalitie and bountie of our God. When therfore blessing is ioy∣ned with pleasure, it is verie requisite to attribute the pleasure to God, from whome onely proceedeth al blessing. Neuerthelesse, if wee regarde the former sentence of the 24. verse: where it is saide, that the people wil curse him that sayeth to the wicked, Thou arte iust: The first sense shalbe agreeable. And though al blessing come from onely the Lorde, yet it is no inconuenience to say, that of them which take pleasure in those that rebuke them, shal come, the bles∣sing of goodnesse: because they shal prayse, blesse, and thanke the rebukers, and be at their commaundement, and doe them al the good that they can possibly. One may also say, that blessing of good∣nesse shal come vppon them, which take pleasure in them that re∣buke them. And because the sense may be so diuerse, it is best to say impersonally, but in them that rebuke him, shalbe pleasure. And it is good reason, that the rebukers which argue and reprooue vs in the name of God, and by his worde, be pleasant and agree∣able to vs, and that wee wishe them al goodnesse, seeing that in admonishing and reprehending vs, they vse the scripture, to ad∣uance vs, and make vs the more perfect. Al the scripture is diuine∣ly inspired, and profitable for doctrine, for reprehension, for cor∣rection, 2. Tim. 3. 16. for instruction, which is in iustice, That the man of God may be absolute, beeing made perfect to al good workes, &c. And to deliuer vs from our sinnes, that we may be saued. They there∣fore Iam. 5. 19. 20 which rebuke, are wel woorthie to be blessed, when by their meanes wee obtaine not onely amendment of life, but also remis∣sion of sinnes, and saluation of the soule. Meanewhile it behooueth them greatly, which busie themselues to reprehende, that they be pure of spirite to rule, and maister: and that they be voide of am∣bition and heresie, as our Lorde Iesus Christ teacheth vs. Other∣wise, although that they which rebuke vs, are wel worthie of reprehension, yet neuerthelesse, wee are more culpable, and woor∣thie of more condemnation.
26 They shal kisse the lippes of him that answereth vpright wordes. They vse to kisse in diuers sortes. Some kisse their neighbors Gen. 27. 26 27. & 29. 11. 13. & 31 55. & 33. 4 & 45. 15. 2. Sam. 20. 9. Gen. 50. 1 Exo. 1 87. Luk. 7. 38 Psal. 2. 12 in signe of peace and amitie, but the signe is not alwayes ioyned with true meaning. Others kisse for delight and voluptuousnesse: as doe the carnal and wanton worldlings: And others kisse in signe of reuerence and subiection or obedience: as Ioseph cast himselfe vpon his fathers face, and wept ouer him, and kissed him: And as Moyses yssued out before his father in law, and kneeled downe and kissed him: And as the woman of euil lyfe, beeing behynde our Sauiour Christ, wept, and began to washe his feete with teares, and kissed them. To suche maner of kissing wee are inuited: Kisse the Sonne, &c. Wee are so bidden, because it is meete that wee sub∣iect ourselues to the Sonne of God, which hath al power & rule in heauen and on earth. And therefore when the Lorde hath made vs subiect to Superiour powers, and to them which are placed in preheminence, it behooueth vs to kisse them, which is, that wee ought to doe them homage, and shewe them honour and obe∣dience, as God commandeth vs. The seconde maner of kissing is filthie and infamous, amongest those to whome it belongeth not, and also, amongest those to whome it doeth belong, it is not with∣out fault, because they vse it not in suche sobrietie and tempearance as is requisite: and it is because our affections are neuer so pure and wel gouerned as they ought to be. But betweene Iesus Christ & his Church, the kisse of delight and pleasure is holie, pure, and cleane, and is most necessarie for vs, aboue al things: & therfore the church requireth but her spouse to kisse her. As for the first kinde of kissing, it hath bene at al times in vse, and good estimation, as we may see by the scriptures. Nowe it behooueth vs to see howe one shal kisse the lippes of him that answereth: That is to say, hee speaketh and saieth vpright wordes, which are of trueth, iustice, and edificati∣on. Can. 1. 2. Act. 26. 37. 1. Cor. 16. 20 2. Cor. 13. 12 It may wel appeare, that men wil not kisse them on the first ma∣maner: for they haue in hate, and persecute them which are true and iust, and which carie sounde doctrine, and vtter iust iudgement, as the heathen themselues haue knowne and confesse it: also ex∣perience
hath shewed it al times, and in the scripture there are ma∣ny complaints thereof. They wil not kisse them on the second man∣ner: for commonly they take no pleasure nor delight in honest, iust, Psal. 11. 2. & 35. 11. 12. & 37. 14. Mich. 3. 9. Esa. 30. 9. 10. 11. & righteous men. They are no better nowe then were the children of Israel of whome God complaineth, it is a people prouoking to anger: lying children, children which wil not heare the law of God, which say to the seers, doe yee not see, &c. They wil not kisse them on the thirde manner, but rather will despyse them and cast them downe, they wil make them captiues, and bring them in sub∣iection and harde seruitude, and wil imprison them. Ioseph hath prooued it, Ieremie also and Micheas. Men doe noweadaies the Gen. 37. Iere. 38. 6. 1. Kings. 22. 26. 27. Acts. 4. 23. & 5. 17. &. 12. 2. & 16. 22. lyke or farre worse to the poore faythful flocke: as also they haue done to the Apostles. Then seeing it is so that the world kisseth not the lips of him that answereth vpright wordes, it behooueth vs to see howe one shal kisse them, and whome it is that kisseth them, for the holy Ghost, which hath spoken by the mouth of Solomon, and guyded his hande to wryte, is true, and cannot lye. If wee say that it is God which wil kisse them, in that he hath peace and loue towardes them which answere vpright wordes, and that he taketh pleasure and delight in them, it shalbe true. It is wel giuen vs to vn∣derstand, when the scripture telleth vs, how God behaueth himself towardes them which are righteous. And as God, who is right and iust kisseth them which speake vpright words: Euen so they which loue vprightnesse, will liue peaceably and in loue with them which shal shew thēselues rightful in their conuersation which is compre∣hended vnder the word. But it is spokē here principally of the word, insomuch that it behoueth vs to kisse the lips of magistrates, which vtter vpright iudgements, not only according to the two first man∣ners of kissings, but also according to the thirde. For they ought to Rom. 13. 1. Pet. 2. Esa. 52. 7. Heb. 13. 17. doe homage as God commandeth them. Also it behoueth to kisse the lips of them which purely and faythfully preache the gospel, be∣cause they vtter the glad tydings of saluation: and we must not kisse them in the two first manners only, but also in the third, not hauing regarde to their persons, but to him that sent them. And so Solo∣mon pronounceth that rather which we ought to doe, then that which we doe ordinarily.
27 Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne house. God hath ordeined from the beginning that man shoulde trauel to the end to liue by his labour. But by the corruption wherein man is falne and hapned: he hath gone astray, & yet erreth from this ho∣ly ordinance, by fraude, cousonages, violences, outrages, rauines, theftes and spoiles: and by such meanes hath sought to builde him a good house. This hath bene from Noes time. The earth was corrup∣ted Gen. 6. 11. & 14. Esa. 3. 13. Iere. 5. 26. Amos. 5. 11. Mat. 2. 1. & 6. 10. Haba. 2. 9. before the Lord, & filled with extortion: And it hath continued til Abrahams time as we see it by the warre & pillage wherof men∣tion is made. And after Abraham, it hath not ceased, as wee may see by the sacred histories, and by the complaints of the Prophets: and yet they continue to doe the lyke or worse. And those which wil be reputed the most holyest (as the Pope, the prelacie, & the mun∣kery) are the greatest deceiuers, and the most wicked theeues. For vnder shadowe of deuotion they sucke the blood of the poore, simple and ignorant. After them come they which aide themselues with Iudges fauours to destroy their poore neighbors. They which proceede therein appertly by outrage, violence, & tyranny, are no∣thing worth: but they are not so culpable. Nowe to the end that we bee not ioined with such wicked men: Solomon warneth vs to doe euery one his owne businesse, to the which God hath called vs, whē he saith, Prepare thy woorke without, &c. Hee speaketh heere but of one kinde of worke, to wit rurall, and vnder that hee compre∣hendeth al other businesses which are lawful, and by the which one may gaine iustly his dayly bread. Hee speaketh but of one worke to shunne prolixitie, and principally of husbandry: for with that that God hath ordeined it first, it is the most necessarie for the body, and Gen. 2. from the same come al our other goods corporal, and temporal, and there is nothing neither in towne, nor village, nor house, the which commeth not from the fielde. And wee haue nothing without la∣bour of the earth. It is the custome of Solomon vnder one kinde to
comprehende the rest, as heeretofore. And when hee saith, Which is thyne, wee may heere learne twoo thinges. The first that wee Prou. 12. 11. ought not to leaue and abandon our businesse to do another mans. For thus dooing wee put both ourselues and our familie in danger to begge our bread: but yet I wil not forbid one to do his neighbor al the pleasure, and seruice he can: and chiefly him which is poore and feeble, and hath neede to be holpen. Thus dooing one leaueth not of his businesse. For the office and duetie of euery one is, to aide him cheerfully and without constraint which hath neede of it. The second is that wee content ourselues with that which is ours, not coueting to order our affaires at another mans costes. As doe they which shift their neighbours landemarkes, and encroche vpon his grounde. Otherwise wee are accursed. Cursed is hee which re∣moueth 2. Cor. 8. & 9 the markes of his neighbour. Moreouer Solomon in this sentence sheweth vs, that we ought not to eate our bread for nothing. Wheretoo that agreeth which S. Deut. 27. 17. Eph. 4. 28. 2. Thes. 3. 6. Paule teacheth vs: If wee obay the same, wee shal not want an house. As Solomon promiseth vs saying, And after thou shalt builde thyne house. Whereby hee signifieth, that if wee wil haue an house to be ours by iust title: it behoueth vs to apply carefully our businesse, and get our bread in taking paines, according as the state wheretoo God hath called vs, requyreth. Contrariwise, that they which make no account to labour, can neither make nor possesse an house which is theirs, but vsurpe as theeues and robbers, all that they haue, by what title soeuer they possesse it. But if we take the ende of this sentence for a forme of admonition, as the beginning is, according as some thinke, it is meete to say that Solomon tea∣cheth the father of the housholde, howe he ought to gouerne him∣selfe, to prosper in his affaires: that is to wit, that hee bee careful to imploy himselfe, first of al in things most necessarie, and that when hee hath done one thing, he doe not desist, but labour dayly, and in good order, least one thing let the other to bee done, such sense is not vnconuenient: but the first agreeth right wel with the scriptures, as may be seene: and containeth large doctrine, and of good edification.
28 Bee not a witnesse without cause against thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips? To fauour the wicked which they loue carnally, and to bee wel∣come amongst thē, also to hurte, & indamage the innocent whome they hate vniustly, and of whome they looke for no support or fa∣uour, men make no difficultie nowedayes to speake against their consciences, in lying slaundering, and laying false reproche against them. Solomon sheweth wel that it is against conscience, and of set purpose when they doe so. First when hee saieth, simply, Bee not a witnesse against they neighbour. For also it is not ill done to beare witnesse, against the iniurious and wrong workers, the dissolute and reprocheful: But it is necessarie to accuse them, and purchase their correction and punishement. As wee ought to vnderstande if wee haue any smacke of natural sense, and also the scripture sheweth vs it in many places. Solomon (I say,) saieth not simply, Bee not a witnesse against thy neighbour, &c. but hee ad∣deth, Leuit. 5. 11. Num. 35. 30 without cause. And heerein as it is said, he sheweth that the slanderers and false witnesses doe sinne against their consciences, & of malice deliberate. For there is none, bee hee neuer so wicked, Deu. 17. 6. Mat. 18. 16. 17. Iohn. 18. 23. which wil not iudge it to bee very ill done to hurt, or seeke to hurt his neighbour, when hee giueth him no occasion. Likewise if the wicked indure euil for iust occasion, and that he seeketh to perswade himselfe that hee hath giuen no occasion thereof, he wil complaine and say that men do him wrong to punish him: which is a very sure argument that slaunderers and false witnesse bearers doe sinne a∣gainst their consciences, and of set purpose: seeing they knowe well ynough, that those whome they witnesse against, haue giuen them no occasion of the wrong which they doe vnto them. Second∣ly, when hee asketh, And wilt thou deceiue with thy lips? For no man seeketh to deceiue, but hee which proceedeth of set purpose, and is reprooued by his owne conscience that hee doeth euill, and that hee would not that others shoulde do the lyke vntoo him. Also Solomon doeth pricke the con∣science of the false witnesse bearer more neerely, when hee vseth
interrogation, then if hee vsed a simple affirmation. And rebuketh him more sharply of his malice which is not little, but great and ve∣ry detestable: for men are not therewith only indamaged, but also God is greatly wronged thereby, by the malicious hypocrisie of such people, when vnder shadowe of religion, they seeke to vndoe their neighbours for to be hollow in witnesse bearing, they bragge themselues to bee honest men, as one may see, when they make no difficultie to sweare that they say true, and they knowe wel that they lye, and that they shal lye falsely. In this manner they wrong God greatly. For they take his name in vaine, in forswearing them∣selues, and they recke not if God bee the author of lyes: and as∣much as in them is possible they dispoyle God of his trueth and by consequence of his deitie, which is to adnihilate him wholy: for he cannot be God, if he bee not veritable. We see then that it is for good cause that Solomon attributeth fraude to them, seing they counterfaite honest men swearing, and promising to say the trueth, and their hart is otherwise bent: to wit, ful of treason and disloyal∣tie. And so the disceite is in the heart, as God wel seeth it: and the periured himself wel knoweth it. Neuerthelesse in the sight of men, which see but the outward shape, the disceit is in the lips, when they promise one thing, and doe another quyte contrarie. It is thus that they deceiue men. And therefore Solomon saith, And wilt thou deceiue with thy lips? Wee see then that it is a very wicked thing to backbyte and beare false witnesse. But yet the worlde ma∣keth no difficultie of it, as hath bene saide heretofore. And although the scripture admonish vs often to withholde vs from false witnesse bearing, yet neuerthelesse men amende not. This is done because they thinke not that God is witnesse and iudge thereof, and that they loue not their neighbours. 29 Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil re∣compence euery one according to his worke. Albeeit the world, deuoide of good sense, and right iudgement, say, that a man is worth nothing if he haue not blood in his nailes, and if he reuenge not himselfe on them which haue offended him, yet neuerthelesse one cannot so much abuse himself in speeche, but
his conscience wil shewe him in spyte of his head, that one ought to bee peaceable, and not to reuenge himselfe on his enemie according as he desireth. For let vs take the most wicked man in the worlde, who if he haue done iniury to any one, whome he esteemeth stron∣ger then himself, he wil be content that he which is offended, should holde his peace and dissemble the iniurie which is done to him, and not reuenge it, he will not thinke him for this, a man of no value. Likewise if he whom the wicked hath offended, goe about, & force himself to be reuenged, the wicked man wil seeke to appease him, & shew him that the offence is not so great, that he ought so to couet to be reuenged. Caine sheweth vs this somewhat: for hauing offen∣ded God by the murther which hee had committed, his wil was Gen. 4. good, that GOD who was the stronger shoulde haue left him vnpunished. And seeing that he coulde not shunne the iudgement, nor flye the vengeance of God, he complaineth saying, my puni∣ment is greater then I can wel beare. Wherein one may see that the conscience of a man teacheth him, that one ought not to be re∣uenged ouer his enemy. And when Saule who was a wicked re∣probate at diuers times iustifieth Dauid in that he had the power and opportunitie to reuenge himselfe, and yet neuertheles had spa∣red, him: he sheweth vs that a man be he neuer so disordinate hath 1. Sam. 24. & 26. witnes in his conscience, that he ought not to reuenge himselfe ouer his enemie according to his owne desire and pleasure. But although we haue such natural light, yet neuertheles we are so peruerse, that wee seeke to extinguish and quenche it. And therefore wee haue neede to be admonished else howe, that is, by the woorde of the Lorde. Also for to shewe the right way of clemencie and peace to them which shewe themselues tractable and easie to be taught and to make culpable and guiltie the proude and highminded, the furi∣ous and inraged, the Lord giueth vs many commaundements which haue beene heretofore alleadged, by the which hee sheweth vs that it is not not lawful for a man to reuenge himselfe, nor doe the like to him that hath offended him. He sheweth it vs also by many exam∣ples of holy men, which haue bene before vs: and principally of Ie∣sus Christ our Sauiour, and we may and ought to beholde the cha∣ritie of God towardes vs which were his enemies, and yet asmuch as in vs lyeth are his enemies, and prouoke him too anger by
our sinnes: for so much was he absent from reuenging himselfe on vs, that hee is come to seeke vs by his sonne Iesus Christ to recon∣cile vs to him, and make peace and aliance with vs, to the ende that wee shoulde not be lost, but saued and kept vnto life euerlasting. Then seeing wee haue so many commandementes and examples, let vs take heede that in al gentlenesse and humanitie wee followe them. Otherwise if wee bee so rigorous or rather furious and mad, that we wil not recōcile ourselues with our enemies, we shal haue for aduersarie against vs the Lorde, which wil sende vs into vtter darkenesse. Nowe because the effect of reuenge proceedeth from Mat. 18. 3 the heart, which is ill affectioned, and that the threatenings which proceed from the same, serue also to inflame it the more, for this cause Solomon seeketh not only to correct the effect, but also to re∣forme our tongues and lips, and to restraine them from al threate∣ning woordes, saying, Say not I wil doe to him as hee hath done to mee. And if it bee not laweful to say so, it followeth wel that it is not lawful to doe so. But in this manner it may seeme at first blushe that Solomon giueth vs a doctrine contrary to the lawe of God, or more straight, for it seemeth that the lawe permitteth vs to doe to our neighbours as they haue done to vs, and to recompence euery one according to his worke, according as it is written, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, foote for foote, bruse for bruse, wounde for wounde, murther for murther. But the lawe speaketh to iudges to Exod. 21. 24 Leuit. 34. 19 Deut. 19. 25 Mat. 5. 58. whome it appertaineth to doe to the wicked, as they haue done to their neighbours, and recompence them according to their works, and not to the parties to reuenge their owne iniuries. And as in the time of Iesus Christ our Lorde, there haue beene false exposi∣tors of the lawe, whome hee rebuketh: Euen so wee ought to vn∣derstande that Solomon hath done the lyke in his time, & hath spo∣ken to the parties when he saith, Say not, &c. And not to iudges, & so he saieth nothing contrary to the lawe, and is not more rigorous then Moses was. For he hath not taught that one shoulde reuenge himselfe of his enemie, but that he shoulde aide him. Exod. 23. 4. 5 30 I passed by the field of the slouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.
Solomon cannot but hee must needs speake of tentimes of the slouthful, to blame him, rebuke him, & threatē him, to the end that we should remember it, and take instruction thereby to hate & de∣test the slouthful and sluggish, and to be careful and diligent to doe euery one our owne businesse. And to begin nowe to blame the slouthful, hee maketh himselfe lyke to a man which goeth by the way, and in passing considereth howe the fieldes and vineyards are disposed and ordered, and according to the order that hee findeth, enquireth whose is this or that. He signifieth the inquirie, when he affirmeth that it is by the fielde of the slouthfull and by the vine∣yarde of the man voyde of heart that hee passed. For a traueller cannot tel whose this or that is, vnlesse hee haue made inquirie. He vseth heere a repetition or exposition: for the slouthful and a man voyde of heart is al one. For why a man is not at any time sluggish, but because he hath not courage to apply his businesse. Moreouer we are here instructed, that we ought not to be hastie to blame any one, but that to blame rightly it behoueth to haue seene or heard it by witnesse worthy credit. Otherwise we shalbe rash and ouerhasty iudges and defamers. To blame the slouthful and man void of heart he telleth the order of his fielde and vineyarde, saying. 31 And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the stone wal ther∣of was broken downe. The slouthful, and man voide of heart is very worthy to be bla∣med, when he suffereth by his negligence & lasinesse the good cre∣atures of God to goe out of kinde, and, asmuch as he can, maketh them vnfruiteful and profitlesse. For God hath giuen the earth to the sonnes of men, and hath appointed them to labour it continu∣ally, to the end that it may fructifie and be profitable to vs. The gift is marked. Gen. 1. ver. 28. 29. and Psalme 115. ver, 16. The ordi∣nance is written. Gen. 8. ver. 22. And so with negligence there is also contempt, when we apply not ourselues according to Gods ordi∣nance. There is also ingratitude, when we vse not the creatures that God hath giuen vs, with acknowledgement, & thanksgiuing, which thing the slouthful doe, when they let thornes and nettles growe in their fields and vineyardes, and giue them ouer to wilde beastes.
As Solomon signifieth it by the breaking downe of the wal. There∣fore when wee see that Solomon blameth the slouthful, For the thornes and nettles which had couered, &c. Wee haue to note, that although the earth bee cursed through mans occasion: yet ne∣uer Gen. 3. 17. thelesse man is not forbidden, to seeke to shunne this curse by toyle and diligence, but hee is commanded to trauel, and blessing is promised him, if he labour, in obaying the voice of the Lorde. It is meete also that the man which seeth the disorder in the field & vineyarde of the slouthful and man voide of hearte, that is to say, Leuit. 26. Deut. 28. 8. Psalm. 12. 8. in his goods and estate, consider and way the ruine and desolation, to the end he may take heed not to imitate the slouthful, but learne to bee better aduised, and apply himselfe to his businesse. Solomon teacheth vs by his example that wee ought to doe so, when hee tel∣leth vs what he did, saying, 32 Then I beheld, and considered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued instruction. When hee is not content to say, I behelde: but addeth, And considered it wel and looked vpon it: He sheweth that to bee well taught to take care and diligence, it behooueth to consider atten∣tiuely and neerely, the desolation, which is in the estate of the slouthful, and voide of heart, to the end we be not partakers of their slouth, lasinesse, and negligence, and that wee praise them not nor flatter them in any case, but wee reprehende them, shewing them whence the desolation commeth that is in their goods and estate: as Solomon doeth saying. 33 Yet a little sleepe, a little slumber, and a little foulding of the handes to sleepe. Hee rebuketh the slouthful, flouting them, and speaking accor∣ding to their opinion and phātasie. For although the slouthful sleepe too much, yet he hath neuer slept ynough, neither speaketh hee of any thing but to sleepe a little, when he hath no wil to awake. Solo∣mon expressing the wordes and phantasie of the slouthful, sheweth also very plainly that he sleepeth too much, and that the deed is not
according to the worde for hee is not content to say, yet a little sleepe. But he multiplyeth the woordes and saieth one thing three times, vnder diuers phrases of speech. And heerein he rebuketh the slouthful sharply of his too much sleepe: and threateneth him after∣wards with pouertie, which shal come sodainely vpon him, and hee shall notwithstand it, saying. 34 So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy necessitie as an armed man. Although he haue attributed field & vineyard to the slouthful: yet neuerthelesse because he tilleth them not as hee ought: hee tel∣leth him that he shalbee ouerpressed with sodaine inexpected po∣uertie, the which is signified by this word walking or as a traueller, or way faring man: for hee ariueth, when no man thinketh on him. But it shal not bee only sodaine, but also rude and rough, harde and very difficile to ouercome or escape, as Solomon signifieth by an armed man, or one wel appointed. The xxv. Chapter. 1 THese also are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out. GOd gaue commandements to the children of Israel to shewe them howe the king ought to gouerne Deut. 17. 16 himselfe amongest them. To the which commandements king Eze∣chias was obedient. Now amongst these commandements he saieth: When hee shal sit vppon the throne of his kingdome, then hee shall write for himselfe this lawe 2. Kin. 18. 3 Deu. 17. 18. 19 in a booke by the sacrifisers Leuites, &c. Wherefore we may vnder∣stande that the men of Ezechias whereof mention is made heere, were of the Leuitical sacrificers which were careful to instruct and teache the king Ezechias. And to doe this, they gathered him togi∣therin
a booke the sentences which were heere and there dispersed, and put them in order, according to the authors out of whome they were drawen: and amongest others they haue put the pro∣uerbs of Solomon which folowe, to the former, to make thereof a booke. Wherein we may see two things: the first, what kings ought to learne and followe of their predecessours, to wit, good doctrine after the which they may reforme their manners as they ought, in all holinesse and iustice, and not to regarde their worldly pompes, and carnall magnificencies, neither their pryde and haughtinesse, nor their vanities and follie. The second, that about them they haue skilful men, which may bee careful to searche the scripture, and that they expounde it in such good order and fashion that it may bee easie to the hearers which are ready to bee taught and pro∣fite therein. And these two things heere appertaine principally to Princes and Magistrates which beare the name of Christians, and say they are reformed to the Gospel. As wee may see, when there is expresse mention made heere that Ezechias which had such men, was King of Iuda, that is to say, of the people of God. 2 The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings ho∣nour is to search out a word. The worldly wise men desire greatly to be knowne, to the end to be in honour and worship. And to come to this, they make their workes to shyne, and as much as they can possibly, giue a faire shew to their speeche and wordes: and al to darken the glorie of GOD, which they haue in contempt and derision, & are enemies & aduer∣saries theretoo. Yet God sheweth not himselfe to the eye what hee is, as Esaie pronounceth it. Truely thou art a God which hydest thy selfe. For he exempteth not the wicked from his vengeance, and yet Esa. 45. 15. neuertheles he executeth it not presently, also he frustrateth not his chosen of their promises, although he accomplish thē not so soone as they would. But he dissembleth, letting the wicked florishe and prosper, and sending afflictions to the iust, reseruing to himselfe that which hee hath determined euerlastingly, to put it in effect at his time appointed without change of purpose. And this is for his glo∣rie that he doth so: keeping himself as it were couert and in silence. Solomon pronounceth it so when he saith,
The glorie of God, &c. And this is as though he saide. Because that God is stil and dissembleth, and it seemeth to the wicked that hee is deafe and blinde, or that there is no God as they say in their hearts. For this cause they despyse him, and as much as they can, bring him to reproche, yea to nothing if it were possible for them. But we seeing and knowing his bountie and patience, by the which hee inuiteth vs to repentance, to the end that wee perishe not, wee haue to cal vpon and glorifie him with Dauid. For the riches are great, which thou hast reserued for them which feare thee, &c. And Psal. 31. 20. albeeit God by his eternal purpose (which cannot bee but iust) is silent and dissembleth for a time, yet neuerthelesse kings and gouer∣nours of the earth which are his lieftenants, cannot, nor ought not to searche their glorie in deferring iudgement, but rather their honour is and shalbe to make diligent inquisition of things, to the end that they may readily doe iustice and iudgement, according as God hath commanded them by his woorde. Solomon wel sheweth it them, when he saith, But the kings honour, &c. Wherein hee sheweth that the kings of the earth are worthy of contempt & re∣buke, for in steede of searching out a worde, that is to say, of being careful and vigilant to doe their duetie and office, they are asleepe. And if they wake it is not to looke to that which they haue to do: so that men may rightly complaine of them. Al their watchings are Isa. 56. 10. blinde: they knowe nothing: they are al dumbe dogs, &c. He shew∣eth also that false witnesse, as much as in them lyeth, depriue kings and men that do iustice, & of honor: for they let them to search out the worde, when in steede of veritie they witnesse vntrueth. More∣ouer seeing we ought to honour our Kings, Princes, and superiours. Solomon sheweth vs that we ought to bee careful to let them vn∣derstand the trueth, and not to hyde it from them in no cace, espe∣cially when there is question of mainteining the honour of God, the peace and quietnesse of the iust and innocent. If Kings and their subiects wil wel searche out the worde, it behooueth them to bee careful to reade, heare, and meditate the doctrine of Moses, of the Prophetes and Apostles, the which is hidden to the sage and pru∣dent Mat. 11. 25. 1. Cor. 1. 18. 1. Sam. 2. 30. of this world. Thus doing they procure the honour and glorie of God, and he wil honour them as he hath promised.
3 The heauens in height, & the earth in deepenesse, & the kings heart can no man searche out. Although the heauens and the earth be thinges visible and pal∣pable: yet neuertheles the heauens are so high, and the earth so pro∣found, that if all the men which euer were, were assembled together to ayde one another to reach vp to the heauens, and digge or make a hole to goe through the earth, to knowe how high the heauens are, and howe deepe the earth is: yet they coulde haue no sure knowledge thereof. For they could not mount to the heauens, nor discend from the one side of the earth to the other. Esay willing to Esa. 40. 12. exalt and magnifie the puissance of God, attributeth to him, that there is none, but he alone, that can measure these thinges, saying, Who is he that hath measured the waters with his hand, and hath compassed the heauens with his palme? Solomon pronounceth the same now, when he saith, The heauens in height, and the earth in deepenes, and the kinges heart. &c. Not that it is his principall intent to shew, that there is none but God, which can measure the highnes of the hea∣uens and the depth of the earth: but he compareth the hearte of kinges, princes, and superiours of the earth to this highnes and deepenes, to shewe vs that it is not for vs to tempt and assay what the hearte of the king is, to make it condiscend to our will and bee gouerned by vs. And also the hearte of a true king is so vpright, that one shal hardly bow it to wickednes and iniquitie, as Solomon hath sayde elsewhere. And although there is none but God which Prou. 16. 10. & 21. 1. soundeth the heartes of men, how great or little soeuer they be: yet neuertheles Solomon speaketh heere principally of the heartes of kinges, and this for diuers reasons. First because God maketh kings otherwise then they were when they were priuate persons, as wee haue seene in Moses, which was instructed in all wisedome by the Egyptians, and in Iosua. One may see it also in the Iudges which Act. 7. 22. Deut. 34. 9. 1. Sam. 10. 16 were after Iosua. It is also written, that Saul should be changed in∣to another man. Secondly because they are the Liefetenants of God, which bow∣eth for no bodie. Also they ought not to suffer that one shoulde
searche their hearts to make them incline to another mans wil, for their inclination woulde bee farre more dangerous then a priuate persons. Thirdly, because that subiectes ought to beare such reue∣rence to their superiours, that they shoulde not once thinke, to turne the hearte of their superious to their appetite, but that they leaue it to God, praying him to dispose it as hee shal see good. Fourthly, because that when magistrates suffer not their heartes to bee searched, for to bee turned from right and equitie, but that they feare to offende the Lorde, and are afraide that God wil vse them as the instrumentes of his yre: as hee hath done with Pharao and the Kings of the Assirians and Babylonians. And as he doeth nowe with the Pope, and Kings and Princes which obay him, to persecute and murther the poore faythful. Then the subiects also shal learne to feare the Lorde, and for his sake to obay their superiors, whome they see to bee conducted by the prouidence of God, and knowe that if they haue no feare and reuerence towardes God and their magistrates, that they shal not escape the iudgemēt of him who go∣uerneth the heartes of the magistrates. 4 Take the drossefrom the siluer, and there shal proceede a vessel for the finour. This present sentence woulde bee litle account made of, if wee should say that Solomō taught the finour, how he ought to dispose and purifie the siluer to make some peece of worke thereof. And therefore note wee that the holy scripture transferreth the names of things vnsensible, to creatures which haue sense and reason. And sometimes it vseth similitudes and comparisons the better to im∣print in our heartes (which are rude) the doctrine which is very profitable and necessarie for vs. As when he saieth, thy siluer is tur∣ned into drosse, and thy wine is mingled with water. The Prophete Esa. 1. 22. calleth corrupt siluer the hypocrites. Likewise Ieremie transferreth the names of siluer and other mettalles to the people of Israell. And chiefly to the greatest which woulde bee most esteemed. And when Solomon saith, Ier. 6. 28. 29 30. Take away the drosse, &c. hee speaketh by similitude: for this
sentence with that which foloweth. 5 Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne shalbe established in righteousnesse. It is asmuch as if Solomon should say: As when the goldsmiths are careful to scumme and purifie their siluer, then they make sub∣stantial and pure worke, which cannot be founde fault withal: euen so when Kings, Princes, and Magistrates, are careful and vigilant to roote out the wicked, then they raigne peaceably ouer their sub∣iectes which feare to offende them, or doe wrong or griefe one to another, and are carefull to yeelde euery one that which ap∣pertaineth to him in al trueth and righteousnesse. The Lorde she∣wed this wel when hee purged the worlde by the flood and sub∣uerted Sodome and Gomorrha, and sunke Dathan Core and Aby∣ron. Hee gaue Moyses well to vnderstande that hee ought to roote out the wicked, when hee gaue many lawes and commandements, wherein hee expressed the punishement, which hee woulde that the wicked shoulde endure: And hath often appointed that the wicked should be rooted out to the end that others hearing & seeing their punishmentes might learne to feare and restraine themselues from the lyke wickednesse. Dauid wel vnderstoode such ordinances, and had good affection to folow them: as appeareth by the protestation which he maketh in the 101. Psalme. Heere kings are taught cleerely how they ought not to spare the fire of punishment to purifie their subiectes thereby, to the ende they may bee as cleere as siluer from the drosse. Also subiectes ought to let themselues bee ordered by their superiours, as the siluer is by the finour: & in no wise to mur∣mur against the magistrates, for the punishmentes which they make although they trouble their neerestkinne. And as siluer, after one hath taken away his drosse, is of no lesse pryce, but more saleable: e∣uen so a nation ought not to thinke themselues dishonored if one roote out of the wicked which are in the midst of them. Note wee also that although it be said, Frō before the king, & that it is meete he haue good assistāce a∣bout him: yet notwithstanding in that the care and wakefulnesse of
the king ought to stretch throughout al his realme, he ought not to restraine it before him, in his presence and sight, but stretch it out o∣uer al his dominions and charges. 6 Boast not thy selfe before the King, and stande not in the place of great men. Wee wil not abase ourselues, but by our wils, wil naturally bee aduaunced, and appeare great, to the ende that by this meanes wee may maintaine ourselues, and enioy our enterprises and attemptes. Adam woulde haue beene lyke to God. The giants got themselues Gen. 3. & 6. & 11. 1. Sam. 18. 8 2. Sam. 15. 16. & 17. great renowme. The sonnes of men, began a great building to pur∣chase fame, and make themselues mighty. Saul seeing himselfe despi∣sed, was angry, and to maintaine his greatnesse, conspired against Da∣uid. Absolon coueting after the Kingdome, wrought treason against Dauid his father. And al these heere haue thriued very ill with their ambition and pryde. And because Solomon knewe wel that we fea∣red the harmes, to the which yet neuerthelesse we went not, but ra∣ther ran headlong as furious and enraged, by our rashnesse and boldnesse, by our pry de and haughtinesse of stomacke: for this cause hee seeketh to despoile vs, and withdrawe vs from al ambition, and induce vs to humilitie, and make vs loue it when he saith, Boast not thy selfe, &c. There is none of vs but naturally hee hath a Kings heart, worldly and carnal, which seeketh to bee praised, exalted, and redoupted: and wee striue to preferre ourselues before our neigh∣bours, and couet to bee afore them in honour and glorie. Solomon thinketh not such a nature to bee good, which is so ful of pryde and loftinesse, and wil that wee preuent one another in honour, estee∣ming euery one more excellent then ourselues. He sheweth vs this wel, when teaching vs in general to humble ourselues towards our neighbours, he nameth but kings & great men. Because those are they which ought to be preferred aboue al men, & if we hūble not ourselues vnto such personages, we wil easily despyse the others. For this cause we are admonished to bee subiect to al humane order for God: be it to the King as a superiour; or to gouernours, as sent by 1. Pet. 2. 13. 14. him, &c. There are very fewe that thinke wel of this that Solomon saith here, & thinke nothing better then to exalt thēselues, & striue
to make themselues fellowes with Kinges and great men of the earth. And it seemeth that if they should recoyle, and playe the co∣wards and bashful fellows, then men would make no more account of them then of sots, and idiots. But to the ende wee resemble not such men, but like wel of this sentence, to withdrawe vs easily from al ambition, pride, and arrogancie: Solomon sheweth vs what it is that we ought to preferre & esteeme as most profitable for vs, when he saith: 7 For it is better that it be saide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes haue seene. Here at first viewe it seemeth that Solomon teacheth vs onely a modest and humble ciuilitie, but in taking this sentence so, we giue it not that excellencie that belongeth to it: wherefore we ought to vnderstand, that vnder the word of humble ciuilitie, hee striueth to print in our heartes the true spiritual humilitie, by the which wee are guided to humble behauiour, & modest countenance. Our lord Luk. 14. 7 Iesus Christ doth the like. Neuertheles our Lord Iesus Christ, nor Solomon condemne not the first places howe high soeuer they bee, but the ambitious affection: as the Euangelist sheweth it wel, when hee saieth that Iesus told the bidden guestes a similitude: to beware howe they chose the first place at the table, &c. Now to allegorisate this sentence otherwise by the Minor, it would be to no edificatiō. Let it suffice vs, that the holie Ghost inuiteth vs here to true humi∣litie, to the ende, that being lowly of heart in this world, we may be at last exalted, which thing we shal obtaine if we be of the same af∣fection that the Publican was. Luk. 18. 1 8 Goe not foorth hastily to strife, lest thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. They that are haughtie of courage, doe quickly begin strife with their neighbours. And therefore it may seeme, that to bring vs to concord, Solomon hath sought to roote out of our hearts, pride and ambition, & to plant in them true humilitie, which cōsisteth chiefly in
hauing God in great admiration and reuerence, we may feare him and obey his wil according to his woorde, and that wee lift not our¦selues vp against our neighbours, deeming ourselues more excel∣lent and worthie then they, that we be not folowers of the Phari∣see. Solomon (I say) hauing tolde vs of suche humilitie, commeth by good order to speake of concord, when he wil not that we striue saying, Goe not foorth hastily to strife, &c. Wherein hee descri∣beth vnto vs the manners of a stout and vnaduised man, and which hath too hotte a blood. They that are suche, hearing the least word that is to their displeasure, goe out into the streete straightway to scold and chide with their neighbour, or to arest him to the law and trouble him. Of such people the worlde is ful, as one may see daily. So that one may wel complaine of al nations, as Saint Paule did of 1. Cor. 6. 6. 7. the Corinthians. Brother hath processe against brother, &c. Solo∣mon describeth also the perplexitie wherein they fal which are ha∣stie to strife vnaduisedly: which is, that they whome they wishe yl too, are often Superiours, and obtaine the conquest: and so make these rashe fellowes abashed, ashamed, and confounded: so that they knowe not what they shal doe. In making suche discriptions, Solomon seeketh meanes to withdrawe vs from al mutinies, sediti∣ons, strifes, and debates: for to bee put to shame is a thing which we feare: Not that it is the principal cause that should withdrawe vs from being hastie to strife. For the principal cause is, and ought to be the feare of the Lorde, and nexte, the charitie which we owe to our neighbours. But Solomon in this case speaketh to vs as to men, which feare more their domage then God, and loue their worldly honour better then their neighbour. If wee wil wel shunne suche perplexitie and confusion, let vs folow the counsel that Iesus Christ giueth vs, Agree with thine aduersarie quickly, whilest thou art in the way with him. Mat. 5. 25. 26. 9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour, & reueale not the secret of an other man. Men are naturally so hot of blood, and so cholerick and furious▪ that if it seeme them that their neighbour hath done thē any offēce, although it bee light and secrete, incontinently they rage in pub∣like, and sounde, as it were a Trumpet, to giue to vnderstand
to others that those haue offended them greatly, and seeke not but to defame their neighbour, sowing wordes of reproch here & there against him. And because this dealing is contrarie to humanitie, which wee ought to haue in great estimation: For this cause Solo∣mon willing to moderate our choler, admonisheth vs, that if wee haue to do with our neighbor about controuersie, we shal talk ther∣of with him, & seeke to make an end of it, the secretliest that we cā, without calling witnesse to vs, and that we discouer not the imper∣fection, & falt of our neighbor, til we haue first talked of it betwene vs and him, & sought to remedie it secretly. Solomon (I say) admo∣nisheth vs this same, saying, Debate thy cause, &c. Wherto agreeth Mat. 18. 15 Luk. 17. 3. 4. the saying of our Lorde: But if thy brother haue offended thee, goe and rebuke him secretly betweene thee and him. Take yee heede. If thy brother haue offended thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, pardō him, &c: & this agreeth with the law, Thou shalt not hate thy bro∣ther in thine heart, Correct thy neighbour, & suffer not sinne vpon him. We could not so guide ourselues, if wee were not gentle, grati∣ous, and merciful. And therfore to obey Solomon, or rather Iesus Leuit. 19. 17 Christ wel, it behooueth vs to mortifie, dispoile, and cloath: as saint Paul admonisheth vs in diuers places. Mortifie therefore your mem∣bers Col. 3. 5 which are earthly, &c. 10 Lest happily, he that heareth it, put thee to shame: and that thine infamie doe not cease. Some thinke they get great honour in reuealing an other mans secret, that is to say, they creepe into reputation by defaming their neighbour, and complaine of him to an other man of some secret of∣fence, or which is none at al, as it commeth oftentimes to passe, that the accusers, and they which complaine, doe the most wrong. But it happeneth (as good reason it should) that in steed of getting honor therby, he that heareth the accusation or complaint, knoweth quick∣ly that it is without cause that the accuser complayneth. And ther∣fore he that sits in audience, blameth him, as hee wel deserueth: and the accuser getteth a marke or blotte to himselfe, which en∣dureth and can not bee defaced: and they that know him wel, take him for a lyer, talebearer, and backbiter, & wil cal  so: as Solomō
signifieth it by the shame and infamie which wil not cease, when he saieth, Lest happily, &c. Hee saieth namely, peraduenture, or happily, regarding first the opinion of the accuser: who thinketh that men wil hold his words for true, and deemeth it a great hap if his malice be discouered, and hee haue blame and infamie thereby. Regarding secondly, that it is verie harde to change custome, chief∣ly when it is wicked. Nowe the custome is such throughout al the world, that they take pleasure to heare yl speeches of their neigh∣bours, and that flatterers, lyers, & backbiters, are the best welcome. And so it is great happe if they bee rebuked and defamed. They which slandered Dauid vnto Saule, were welcome, and more estee∣med then hee. But the holie Ghost which heareth them, know∣eth wel howe to rebuke them, by the scripture, and to put them to shame, and infamie, which shal neuer be abolished. And so if back∣biters bee not discouered by men, God can wel discouer them at time conuenient. 11 A worde spoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of siluer. If any man seeke to garnishe his speeche, to please and bring profite and delight to an other man, he for whō, and at whose plea∣sure this man speaketh, wil say, that his neighbour hath a golden tongue, and that his speech pleaseth him as wel as a iewel of golde, bedecked with white siluer. If amongst worldlings, words be of such price, by farre more reason we ought greatly to esteeme of the word of God, which is purely and faithfully administred to vs, and should take great delight therin. Solomon sheweth vs it, when he saieth, A word spoken in his due place, or order, or vpon his wheeles (as So∣lomons language is) is like apples of gold, &c. I knowe that one might applye this sentence to al purposes which are spoken of, as it appertaineth of what matter soeuer they be. But when hee saieth, Blessed is hee that hath his affection set on the lawe of the Lord, and meditateth it day and night. Wee shoulde not fynde a worde so well spoken in his due place, or vpon his wheeles, as the woorde of the Lorde. And therefore with Solomon wee will compare it to Apples of Golde, with pictures of siluer:
not that the woorde diuine exceedeth not farre al the fayrest, and most precious thinges of the worlde: but the scripture applyeth it selfe to our rudenesse, to leade vs as it were by the hande, to take a taste and delight in the worde of God: the which in other thinges is compared to golde, siluer, and precious stones. If one wil take here the worde, for that which is proper to pacifie quarels betweene one neighbour and an other, without publishing them, the sense shalbe verie conuenient, and not contrarie to that which hath bene saide. For there is no worde more fit to pacifie strifes, then the worde of the Lorde, or that which is conformable thereto. 12 Hee that reprooueth the wise and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde. Earinges or pendentes of golde, were in olde time in vse with maidens and women, and also other iewels of golde, and pleased them, & (as they thought) became them wel as may be seene, when Rebecca was readie to receiue the earinges of golde that Abrahams man put before her face. And at this day, also maydens and wo∣men which are curious to be seene, take delight to weare preci∣ous Gen. 24. 2 ornamentes, and thinke themselues gaie, when they shine in golde and silkes, and when they be preciously and pompeously ap∣parelled. And they loue suche ornamentes so wel, that they are ve∣rie careful in keeping them: and if they haue power & libertie, they wil gather abundance of them. We say not this, to the praise of wo∣men and maydens, nor to allowe that which they doe in this case. For Saint Paule and Saint Peter rebuke them. But if women bee so desirous to decke themselues outwardly, it behooueth vs to bee 1. Tim. 2. 9. 1. Pet. 3. 3. verie readie to receiue inwarde ornamentes to decke and beautifie ourselues: which is, that in al obedience, wee lende our eares to them which instruct vs in the worde of the Lorde, by the which they admonishe and instruct, argue, and reprehende vs, to make vs more faire and pleasant before our God. Let vs take pleasure in such persons, and esteeme ourselues wel iewelled, when the Lorde put∣teth before our face such earinges. To do this wel, we ought to re∣nounce al follie, for they which are giuen ther too, despise al counsel,
and reiect al correction and instruction, as is saide here aboue in di∣uers places. And it behooueth vs to embrace wisedome, the which maketh vs attentiue to correction, & procureth vs to loue it. Thus doing, wee shalbe decked and adorned verie gorgiously: as Solo∣mon signifieth it, when he saieth, He that reprooueth, &c. The wise man which giueth eare to obey corrections and reprehensions, ma∣keth great account of him which reprooueth him, and thinketh him wel garnished and adorned therby. And (as hath bin seene) hee lo∣ueth him which reprooueth him, & becommeth sage thereby, and Pro. 9. 8. 9. groweth vp in doctrine. Wherefore let vs neuer think ourselues so wise, but men may finde wherin to reprooue vs: chiefly if we bee wise, we wil acknowledge that we are wel worthie of rebuke. Not that I wil say, that wise men commit crimes wittingly, but they of∣fend by infirmitie. Wherof perceiuing themselues guiltie, they suf∣fer willingly to be reprooued, and take pleasure therein, thinking it a great honour to do so. They resist not by murmuring and despight, they brag not themselues to be honest men, as do the folish & wic∣ked, who rise vp against them, which seeke to decke them with ea∣rings and spiritual iewels of sapience: whose marchandise is better then the marchandise of siluer: and her reuenue, then fine gold. Pro. 3. 14. 15 13 As the cold of snow in the time of haruest, so is a faith∣ful messenger to them that send him: for hee refre∣sheth the soule of his maistresse. A faithful messenger hath bin spoken of elswhere: notwithstan∣ding, Pro. 13. 17. Solomon letteth not to treate of it now againe, & to shew vs, what we ought to be in our charges and commissions, and what we ought to do therin, and whereto to attende. For there is none of vs but he is a messenger: not that the charges or commissions are all alike, for some haue more power then some. And to shewe vs this same, he setteth before vs those messengers or Embassadours which serue their maisters faithfully, & by this meanes giue them matter of ioy, and content them so, that they repose themselues wholy vp∣on thē. And hee compareth thē to the cold of snow, which wintereth the corne that is in the ground, and commeth in such a season that it maketh it to prosper: so that the haruest folowing is fertile and abundant.
Or also (which seemeth more conuenient) he compareth them to colde which commeth in haruest time, much like to the cold of snowe to refresh them which reape and labour in a whote regi∣on: such colde is a greate recreation, for it maketh that they which trauel, are not altered, surfeited, nor choked vp with the great heate. And it is not without cause that he maketh such a comparison, for they which doe their message faythfully, doe keepe their maisters which sende them from great griefe and from al vexation, and as∣much as they can, yeelde them matter of recreation. As wee knowe that it is a great pleasure to a Gentleman, when hee hath seruantes that execute wel the charge that is committed to them. Nowe wee are al messengers and Embassadours of our God, who hath called vs into his familie, & sendeth vs as he thinketh good, & giueth vs a charge which he wil that we execute. Not that we haue al publike charge, as kings & superiors of the earth, nor as Pastors & ministers of the Church, which are the principal messengers, as hath bene said aboue: But the Lord sendeth vs to our neighbors, giuing vs charge that we haue care one ouer another, according to the talent which he hath put into our hands. If we execute our charge faythfully, we shalbe to him as the cold of snowe in the Haruest. Not that we can doe any thing to recreate or reioice him, but he alone of his boun∣tie reioyceth, and delighteth himself, when in vprightnesse of heart we seeke to execute our charge faythfully. 14 He that boasteth of false liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine. When men see cloudes driuen by the winds, they looke that they shal haue raine, but it chaunceth sometimes that none at all falleth, and so they loose their expectation: Euen so when men see any one which is franke of his promises, they hope to obtaine the same of him. But they are very often deceiued, and prooue that the greatest promisers are cloudes & wind without raine. They are rich and li∣beral in promises, but there is no effect folowing, and so they boast themselues falsly and are of no profite. They are content to beare a fayre face, and make men gape after them, and holde them in hope of thinges. Those which are such, not onely are vaine, as cloudes which are without water, but also hurtefull, as the winde which dryeth the earth, sucking his humor without sending
him any againe, but making it yawne for thirst and drynesse. The captaine of such men is the Diuel, and of him they haue learned to boast themselues falsly. Adam wel prooued the boasting of the Di∣uel Gen. 3. 1. Kings. 22. to be false. Likewise Achab and Iosaphat haue prooued it, after that they had beleeued false Prophetes, by whose mouth the Diuel spake. The Diuel sent cloudes, and winde without raine, when hee Mat. 4. 9. Luke. 4. 6. promised our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ to giue him al the kingdomes of the world, and boasted that al the glorie thereof was his. We see then that they which brag of things which thy neither wil nor can do, are supposts of the Diuel, who is a lyer & the father of lyes. Also as the cloudes & wind without raine vanish away, & Iohn. 8. 44. come to nothing: euen so these greate boasters shal perish with the Diuel their father. For, Thou shalt destroy al them that speake lyes: and chiefly when the lye is in slaunder. As is the false doctrine of the Papistes, which teache of free wil, and merites, and other abhomi∣nable Psal. 5. 7. lyes, & promise that by this meanes men shal win paradice & obtaine life eternal. Their destruction is plainly shewed thē. Wher∣fore we ought to take great heed of al false boasting. And principally 2. Pet. 2. 3. of things which are to come which are to vs vncertaine, & of them wee shoulde make no promise, but at Gods good wil and pleasure. Also of things which are present with vs, if wee wil shewe libera∣litie, let vs doe it in secret, without ostentation or vaine shew, euen as our Lord Iesus Christ hath taught vs. Last of al let vs vnderstand, that the holy Ghost teacheth vs heere to loue one another indeede and trueth, as also we are admonished thereof in Iohn. 1. Iohn. 3. 18. 15 A Prince is pacified by the staying of anger: and a softe tongue breaketh the bones. Albeeit the anger of kings and greate men of the earth, bee meruellously to bee feared because of their highnesse and power, Pro. 16. 14. & 19. 14. & 20. 2. Pro. 16. 19. and that men hardly escape it, and with greate difficultie and danger: yet neuerthelesse if one shewe himselfe sage before them, hee may pacifie them, and in steede of beeing har∣med, finde pleasure and vtilitie. Nowe to shewe ones selfe wise, it behooueth him to put of an angry and furious hearte, which is
seditious and arrogant, hautie and rebellious, and not to bee easie, nor hastie to shew his anger nor wrath, to rise vp against his prince, or doe damage, hurt, or violence to his neighbours. If wee haue Pro. 14. 29 & 16. 32. & 19. 11. such wisdome and discretion to deferre and slack our anger, we shall finde grace at our princes handes, so that they shal refraine their great anger, and bee induced to vse beneuolence. Solomon hath shewed this aboue, and yet nowe againe hee sheweth it when he saith, A Prince is pacified, &c. Yea, though hee bee very obstinate, and hardened in his anger, yet one shall winne him by faire words, as Solomon signifieth it saying, And a soft tongue breaketh the Pro. 15. 1 bones. This is agreeable to that which is saide: A soft answere ap∣peaseth anger, &c. This hath beene proued by Dauid and Saul, and Dauid and Abigael. Meanewhile this is not to say that one ought 1. Sam. 26. & 25. to seeke by faire wordes to turne away wrath of kinges and greate men of the earth, which is and ought to bee kindeled against the wicked to doe vengeance on them: for this shoulde bee to resist the ordinance of God, but we ought to be of so peaceable, humble, and obedient a life, that we may winne the harts of our superiours: and also it is needeful for vs to turne them awaye from al tyranny Rom. 13. & crueltie, & that we keepe them frō animating themselues against other Princes their neighbours, by good admonitiōs and forewar∣ninges, so to mainteine peace, and to liue vnder them in rest and quietnesse. And if wee ought to bee so heedy, to yeelde ourselues obedient, and humble to men, by a farre more strong reason wee ought to take heede to despite, or murmure against our God which is our soueraigne Prince: for it is an horrible thing to fal into his handes. Neuerthelesse his anger is not so harde, but it may bee broken by a soft tongue, if with an affectionate hearte we yeeld him praise, prayers, and thankes giuing, with confession of our faultes & offences, acknowledging that we are wicked, and that hee alone is iust: as the auncient fathers afore vs haue doone, to turne away the wrath of the Lorde both from them, and from their neighbours. And amongst others, Daniel. Chap. 9. 16 Hast thou founde hony? Eate that is sufficient for thee: least thou be ouerful, and vomit it.
God hath giuen vs, al meate to vse indifferently with thankes giuing, which thing gluttons and drunkardes cannot doe, who are not content to take sufficient, but deuoure and swalowe suche a∣bundance thereof, and with suche excesse, that they almost burst therewith, and are constrained often to cast their gorge: and which worse is, loose both sense and vnderstanding, as is dayly proued: and so they cannot acknowledge the goods which come from God, too giue him thankes for the same, as belongeth to him, wherfore to the ende that wee be not vnthankeful for the benefites which God be∣stoweth vpon vs, let vs vse it with temperance and sobrietie, and be very circumspect that we take not too much delight in the good∣nesse and sweetnesse of the meate, to cause vs to abuse the good creature of God, in vsing the same excessiuely. Solomon vnder the name of hony as it seemeth, admonisheth vs of this same, when he saith, Hast thou found hony, &c. This sense is not impertinent, & con∣teineth good and necessary doctrine: for there is no meate so good but it hurteth vs, and wasteth & destroyeth vs, if we take too much thereof. If one fill himselfe ouer ful, he is hurt thereby: for the sto∣macke is greeued therewith, and the vnderstanding (which is worst of al) is ouer laden and dulled. And so he is in worse estate then bruite beastes, who eating and drinking their fill, yet loose not their natural sense which God hath giuen them: If men vomit, the meate and drinke is lost. And so gluttons and drunkards destroy thēselues, and worke destruction, and in this maner they waye not God as they ought to doe. For not onely they destroy the goods which hee hath created for the vse of man, but also in as much as in them lyeth they deface and abolish the image of god. But it seemeth to be more conuenient to say that Solomon speaketh by similitude, and that the second part of the same followeth, when he saith: 17 Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours house, least he bee weary of thee, and hate thee. Now the sense of the similtude is such, as if one saide, as hony hath a sweete tast, and therefore men delight to eate it, and giue it entrie into their bodies: yet neuerthelesse if one eate more thereof then is needeful, he ouerchargeth his stomacke, and is forced to vo∣mit.
Euen so, although it seemeth that thy neighbour liketh of thee, and that he taketh pleasure to haue thee familiarly conuersant with him, yet neuerthelesse take heede to bee importunate vpon him, & to trouble him at vnconuenient houres, and too often, for feare least he be weary of thee, and in steed of louing thee, fal to hate thee: and for a freend, become an enimie. As then, it behooueth that in al sobrietie and temperance we vse meate and drinke, howe good & sweete soeuer it bee: euen so what amitie and familiaritie we haue with our neighbours, and though they declare both in wordes & deedes to bee at our commandement, yet let vs take heede to be cu∣rious inquirers of their estate, and not to binde on them as farre as our appetite biddeth vs, as if that which they haue were ours to dispose at our pleasure. Such ouer boldnes engendreth hate and en∣mitie, wherof proceed strife and debate, dissention, and sedition, by the which one is often forced to cast his gorge, & leaue that which he hath taken vnaduisedly. Wherfore one may wel cal the Anabap∣tists authours of sedition, troublers of peace, and destroyers of cha∣ritie, when they would haue al goods to be common. One may al∣so cal them blasphemers, when they speake against the holie Ghost, who hath saide by Solomon, Withdrawe thy foote, &c. For if al things be cōmō, it is lawful to enter euerie where, & to vse al things at ones pleasure, and there would be no theeues: and so that would be in vaine which God hath said, Thou shalt not be a thiefe. Let vs not thinke that it is laweful to enter into our neighbours house at our pleasure, no although they haue somewhat of ours, and that we would fetch it away, or haue a pledge for the same. Know we there∣fore that we are here taught that we ought to spare our neighbour, Deut. 24. 10. 11. & not thrust ourselues forth to inquire of his dooings, nor to vse his goods at our pleasure, be he neuer so much our friend. Our du∣tie is to let him be maister within himself, & vse his goods as he list priuately, as we would do ours. By this meanes amitie shalbe main∣tained, and we shal liue in peace one with another. Hereby one may conclude that they which smel and seeke out good cheere, and tarie not til they bee bidden, but haue the face to present themselues and sit downe at anothers mans table, are not afraide to bee hated: it is ynough for them to satisfie their bellies. Of the num∣ber of which are the begging fryers, to whome the worlde
is bounden as they thinke. And therfore they are importunate too aske, and goe not away for two or three biddinges, but thinke that men doe them wrong to deny them that which they aske. 18 A man that answereth against his neighbour as a false witnesse, is like a hammer, a sworde, and a sharp arrowe. Solomon hath already often treated of the false witnesse, hee hath shewed partly the frowardnesse of the false witnesse, and Pro. 6. 19. & 12. 17. & 14. 5. 25. threatned him destruction, the which he wel deserueth, as hath bin largely declared. And because it hath bene but partly, that hee hath declared his frowardnesse, and that it is verie needeful to knowe it better, to the ende to vnderstande that they perishe not without cause, and that wee may haue them in more disdaine, now he set∣teth out their crueltie more plainly. And to do this same, he nameth the witnesse by circumlocution, calling him, A man that answe∣reth, &c. Wherein we haue first to note, that although in the scrip∣ture, to answer, is taken oftē for to speake, not being asked nor pro∣uoked by other wordes: notwithstanding one may say, that in this place Solomon hath regarded that false witnesses to make their wordes be taken, come not to speake before the Iudge, vntil they be called by oath. Secondly let vs note, that it is saide expressiuely, Against his neighbor, because the intent of the false witnesse, is to hurte his equals, either in goods or in good name, or in his body or in al the three, and hath not God in his minde: and yet neuerthe∣lesse he that answereth against his neighbour, tyeth himself to God, & riseth vp against him, to bring him to nothing if it were possible. Solomō signifieth it when he calleth him a false witnesse. For seeing he forsweareth himselfe, he maketh God the author of lyes, and de∣priueth him of his trueth (as much as in him is) without the which God cannot consist, & so there is great boldnes & temeritie in the false witnesse, whē he wrongeth not man only, but God himself also who hath al power, whome it is vnpossible to resist. Hee expresseth afterwards his crueltie, making him lyke to three instruments with the which men do many murthers: for the hammer breaketh the bones shiuering thē into peeces heere & there: The sworde cutteth
and giueth great woundes in the fleshe: The sharpe arrowe, pear∣ceth deepe, and cannot bee easily drawne out, but the iron wil re∣maine in the body. And so the false witnesse hath a tongue very soft it seemeth, and which is not other in apparance, but that, which speaketh trueth, but it is very harde, very sharpe, and very pearcing, when it murdereth and killeth the innocentes. It is not therefore without cause that the Apostle Saint Iames complaineth of the tongue. Nowe when Solomon accuseth the false witnesse of such cruelty Iam. 3. 6. 7. 8 hee sheweth that he is worthie of death: for he that sheedeth ano∣ther mans blood, his blood shalbe shed. Then seeing wee wil bee neither thought murderers, nor be murdered, let vs learne to speake Gen. 9. 6. trueth and flie from lying. 19 Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a sliding foote. They that haue broken teeth eate not as they woulde, and as necessitie requireth: but if they be an hungred, languishe, and can∣not remedie themselues according to their desire. Likewise a lame man which is weake of his feete, cannot goe lightly nor soone dis∣patch a long iourney, nor helpe another to pasle it: for his feete are not stedfast, but slide, and lets them fal whome he thinketh to helpe. This is wel knowne by experience: neuerthelesse, there is none so toothlesse, but hee thinketh to feede wel if hee haue wherewithal, and there is none which hath so great desire to goe, as the lame, and weake of foote, but often the toothles and lame, are both frustrate of their intent, and chiefly in their most neede, euen so when one trusteth the vnfaithfull: That is to say, those which haue no feare of God, nor reuerence of his word, nor haue any affection of huma∣nitie towardes their neighbours, nor make it no difficultie to lye & deceiue them, to hurt and betray them: when (I say) one hath con∣fidence in such wicked persons, they eate not when they haue need, nor goe not when they shoulde goe, that is, they are frustrate of that which they looked for of them when they fal into tribulation: for they are like a broken tooth, and a lame foote in the time of neede. If they bee such towardes their neighbours, it is no maruel
seeing they are no more profitable to themselues: forgiuing them∣selues to al despising of God, and al treason towardes their neigh∣bours: for they promise them that they shal prosper, and bee with∣out harme, and shalbehaue themselues valiantly against al assaultes. but they come to their purpose: for God breaketh their teeth, and maketh their feete slide, and stumble. If therefore the vnfaithful Iob. 4. 8. 9. 10 Psal. 38. & 58. 7. Psal. 37. 18. haue any confidence it is vaine, and if wee haue any in him, wee are abused. And so, it is the surest way to trust only in the Lorde. 20 Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde season, is like vineger powred vpon or Alumme, or Sope. Nitre, or like him that singeth songues to an heauie hearte. When it is very colde, and wee wil keepe our bodies from harme, we put on clothes enough to keepe vs warme, and lay them not away willingly, for feare of catching colde, the which we cal the enimie of nature: for without taking away the garment, the colde being great, pearceth so that one feeleth it euen in his bones, as may bee seene when eche man trembleth thereat. And when men powre vineger vpon Alum or Nitre (which is vnknowne to vs) they melt it away, for it looseth it hardnesse. Also if any one haue an hea∣uie hearte, hee hath no pleasure to take paines to comfort him, but rather is vexed and greeued thereat the more, and chiefly if his hearte bee frowarde and malitious, and hee doe bite on the bridle, as one woulde say, and is displeased, and taketh it in yll that he is not come to the ende of his wicked enterprises, but is desperat therewith. Or also when a poore conscience is as it were o∣uerwhelmed with the iudgementes of GOD, and seeth nought but death and hel about him because of his sinnes. The more one seeketh to comfort suche men, the more they are greeued and vexed, and their sorowe is augmented: for they neither wil nor can giue place in their mindes to any good woorde of consolation as is seene by proofe. Notwithstanding the intent of Solomon is not to forbid vs to comforte them which are afflicted in their
heartes, by sweete and pleasant woordes: for God hath giuen vs his worde to the ende that we shoulde vse it: for the consolation of the sad and sorwful. The Lorde comforteth the afflicted by the preaching of his worde, when hee giueth efficacie to the admoni∣tions, exhortations, and warninges, which are doone in his name. Esay. 40. 1. & 51. 11. 12. & 61. 1. Iere. 31. 10. And when the wise instruct the ignorant, and that the strong vp∣holde the weake, the riche helpe the necessitie of the poore, and those that are in prosperitie haue compassion on them that suffer aduersitie. Solomon therefore wil not keepe vs from taking care to comfort the miserable and afflicted, neither giueth hee vs to vn∣derstande, that consolation is hurful vnto them: but hee meaneth that if seeing our neighbours in distresse, wee laugh at their misery and reioyce and take pleasure at it, whereas wee ought to weepe & haue compassion on them, and put ourselues in paine to comforte them, wee resemble those which vncloth their neighbours, when it is colde wether, and which spill vineger vpon Sope and Nitre. Hee wil not therefore haue vs sing songues to an heauie hearte. That is to say, hee will not haue vs to laugh and reioyce, when wee see our ueighbours in affliction, for so doing (in as much as in vs ly∣eth) wee augment their miserie, which is a thing very wicked be∣fore GOD: as our Lorde Iesus Christ sheweth vs. Wher∣fore let vs obey the Apostle Saint Paule, who saith, Reioyce with Luke. 6. 24. Rom. 12. 15. 1. Cor. 12. 26. them that are mery, and weepe with them that are sad. So that it may be accomplished in vs which is saide, And if one member in∣dure any thing, all the other members shall suffer with it. &c. 21 If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir stie, giue him water to drinke. So muche is it vnlawful to take away the garment in a colde day, or sing songues to the heauie heart, when thy neighbour loueth thee (or at leastwise hateth thee not) is in miserie and distresse, that rather it behoueth vs to haue pitie and compassion on them which wishe vs euil not only in words & sound shewes, but also indeedes,
helping them and succouring them at their necessitie. Ioseph did so to his brethren, who had shewed him great signe of hate, and execu∣ted Gen. 7. &. 42 1. Sam. 24. & 26. great crueltie against him. Dauid kept that none shoulde doe Saul his enimie harme, where vnto Solomon agreeth very wel saying, If hee that hateth thee bee hungrie, &c. Iesus Christ com∣mandeth vs the like. Nowe as concerning the wordes of Solomon wee haue to note, that it seemeth at the first shewe, that hee is con∣tent, that one make as much account of him which is his enimie, as of a Dogge, to whome likewise wee giue bread and water: for hee speaketh but of giuing him bread and water. But one may easily exempt Solomon from such suspition, first in saying (as the trueth is) that the Scripture vnder bread and water comprehendeth al that which serueth to nourishe the body of man, yea vnder the onely worde bread. Secondly in saying that Solomon hath named that which is least esteemed, to shewe that if one refuse to giue to his e∣nimie bread and water, he wil not giue him other meates which are Gen. 3. 19. & 18. 5. & 28. 20. & 39. 6. 7 1. Kin. 13. 8. 2. Kin. 6. 22. Luk. 16. 10 exquisite, nor wine which is sweete and delicate, and to shew that if one obey not in a little thing, he wil hardly obey in a greater: accor∣ding also as our Lorde Iesus Christe saith, Hee that is vniust in a lit∣tle matter, is also vniust in a great matter, &c. And though in no o∣ther place of the Scripture are founde not bread and water, for al the nourishnent of the body of man, yet Saint Paul sheweth vs, that we ought to vnderstande this place, for al foode: for hee nameth nei∣ther bread nor water, but saith simply that one shoulde giue to eate Rom. 12. 20. and drink. Vnderstande wee therfore that Solomon teacheth vs to be merciful towards our enimies, ministring to thē according to our power, that which they haue neede of. And heerein he sheweth that wee ought not to hate any body, although wee bee hated, neither doe il though wee bee doone yl vnto, but rather render good for e∣uil in al thinges which are possible for vs. Thus doing wee shalbee the children of our heauenly father which maketh the Sunne shine Ro. 12. 14. 17. 1. Pet. 3. 9 Mat. 5. 45 on the good and on the bad, &c. 22 For thou kindlest coales vpon his head, and the Lord shal deliuer thee.
The first good that commeth of our doing wel towards our e∣nimies, is that we kindle coales, or as Saint Paul saith, Heape coales of fire vpon their heades: that is to say, we breake their hearts. In∣somuch that they are forced to encline on the one side or on the o∣ther, that is to wit, that either by our benefites their courage is sof∣tened, and they induced to loue vs: or if they bee so cruel that they relent not by our benefites, yet neuerthelesse they shal burne and bee troubled with the witnesse of their conscience, which shal feele it selfe confused and ouercome with our benefites. One may see this token in Saul, and as Saul finally ceassed to persecute Dauid, euē so our enimies wil leaue of to trouble vs, & so we shal not loose the 1. Sam. 21. & 26. good that wee haue doone them. The seconde, and which is most profitable for vs, is that the Lorde wil recompence our benefites: And to perfourme the same, not onely wil giue vs a temporal good thing for a temporal: but also wil receiue vs for his children. Our Sauiour admonisheth vs to doe wel to our enimies, to the ende we Mat. 5. 44. 45 may bee the children of our father which is in heauen, and if we bee children, wee are heires. And seeing it is an heritage, it follo∣weth that God giueth vs not that which hee oweth vs: for he can∣not Rom. 8. 17. bee our debtour: and so the retribution is gratis, and procedeth of his free liberalitie, without any merite of ours, as wee ought wel to acknowledge it: for wee ought not to bee otherwise to∣wardes our God, then wee woulde that our children shoulde bee towardes vs, and wee woulde haue them stil to acknowledge that they haue not deserued the goods which wee leaue them in posses∣sion after vs. 23 As the North winde driueth away the raine: so doeth an angrie countenance, the slaundering tongue. Whiles the North winde bloweth not, the Southwinde sen∣deth him cloudes which distil raine, euen so when a man which is in credite and authoritie, in power and superioritie, sheweth himselfe fauourable and curteous, then flatterers, tale bearers, lyars, and backbiters, feare him not, but dare easily come before him, and thinke themselues welcome, when in secrete they bring him false
reportes of their neighbours. Contrariwise, when the North winde which is drie and impetuous, bloweth, the cloudes are scattered, and yeelde no raine: euen so when a personage which is in prehemi∣nence sheweth himselfe rude and seuere, rough and rigorous, as though hee were alwayes angrie, the flatterers which desire to di∣stil raine of lyes and backbitinges, dare not approch to him, but ab∣sent themselues away: for although they seek stil to cloke their say∣ing, for to hide their falsehood, yet neuerthelesse a vertuous iudge can wel discouer it, and confound them, so that they dare not ap∣peare before him: and when he hath caught them, hee wil scatter them, as the dry Northerne wind bringeth the cloudes to nothing. Heere Solomon sheweth wel to kinges and rulers of the earth that they ought not to laugh, reioyce, and take pastimes at flatterers & backbiters, but rather to be bitterly angry against thē, & in anger to take reuenge vpon them, executing that which Dauid purposed to doe, saying, Hee that priuily slaundeth his neighbour, him wil I de∣stroy. He that hath a proude looke and high heart, I cannot suffer: Psal. 101. 5. and hee teacheth vs that to shunne the fury of our Princes, and to bee in their grace and fauour, wee ought to abstaine from lying de∣traction and falshood, for heere aboue it is saide that the iust mans lippes doe please kinges, &c. And so one may see that al is out of or∣der, when kings giue entertainement rather to flatterers and back∣biters then to men of trueth, and also men seeke to please them ra∣ther Pro. 16. 12. by lyes then by trueth. Let vs learne also euery one of vs not to fauour in any case, lyars and backbiters, but rather shewe them an angry countenance to giue them to vnderstand that wee haue them in horrour and detestation, to the end that they withdrawe them∣selues from vs, and bee mute and dumbe before vs, if so be it, they wil not speake trueth. Otherwise wee are giltie of lying and detra∣ction, seeing we take pleasure in hearing them. 24 It is better to dwell in a corner of the house top, then with a contentious woman in a wide house. Wee haue seene this sentence worde by worde. Neuerthelesse this repetition vsed of the holy scripture, is not vnprofitable, but ra∣ther Pro. 21. 9. necessary, because of our rudenesse and negligence, or rather
(as concerning this present sentence) because that commonly wo∣men are the more proude and arrogant, they are the more stout and obstinate in their wickednesse, and as it were enraged, insomuch that they wil not rest vpon reason, what warning soeuer one gi∣ueth them: & also because men are more attentiue to match them∣selues with riche women, which are come of a good house and kinred, then to inquyre of their womanhood and good manners, of their modestie and humilitie. This auarice or disordinate desire is marked by the wide house. For these causes I say Solomon setteth againe before vs this present sentence to reprooue men and women according as they deserue. And as the repetition is not superfluous, so it shal not bee vnprofitable to apply to this place present that which was saide in the 21. chap. 9. vers. 25 As are the colde waters to a person fainting for drinke: so is good newes from a farre country. When any body hath long suffered hunger, and through the long suffering of the same is waxed faint and out of hearte, if he finde any colde well of water, or fresh running riuer, hee taketh pleasure to drinke thereof, hee stencheth his thirst, hee recouereth strength, and is renewed againe. Euen so if any one haue his friend in a farre countrie and thinketh that this friend is very conuenient for him, yea necessarie, hee wil bee vexed and greeued greatly, and wil as it were pyne away when his friende hath not of long time sent him any newes. But if his friend haue a care of him, and if hee bee diligent to let him vnderstande of his newes, which bee pleasant and profitable to him: his griefe wil passe, his languor wil cease, hee is well recreated and refreshed, and hartely thanketh his friende that hath him so in remembrance. Nowe whyles wee are present in body, we are absent in the Lorde, which is the best friend that wee can haue. And so in respect of vs that walke in this earthly country by fayth and not by sight, our God is in a far country. And if so beit he sende vs not and distille downe vpon vs his fresh waters, if hee sende vs not of his good newes, wee languishe and are faynt through spirituall thirst: with the which hee hath threatened the
children of Israel. We languish I say, and waxe faint if wee haue the true knowledge of the bountie, and clemencie of our God, and Amos. 8. 11. 12. knowe howe great a gift it is to enioy his worde and serue him ac∣cording to the same, and not to haue libertie to doe it in the com∣pany of the faythful. Dauid was seased with such languor and faint∣nesse. As hee expresseth it. If wee wil bee free from the foresayde Psal. 42. 2. &. 63. 2. manace, and not lye long in languor, let vs harken to our GOD which inuyteh vs so courteously by his Prophete: All you that are thirsty, come vnto the waters, &c. And to obay him, let vs come to Esa. 55. 1. Mat. 11. 28. Iohn. 7. 37. Iohn. 4. 10. 13. 14. Iesus Christ, who also inuyteth vs, and hee wil giue vs of the water of life, which wil keepe vs from thirst for euer. And also it is hee which is sent from a farre. For hee discended from heauen, and brought good newes to the worlde. And as hee hath begunne to bring vs this good newes, so hee continueth it by his ministers, whereof wee ought to bee rauished in admiration, and make great account and bee ioyfull saying, Howe fayre are the feete of him vpon the mountaines which hath pronounced and published peace and goodnesse, which preacheth saluation, who saith to Zyon, thy God raineth, wee were very farre from our Lorde GOD by our sinnes and abhominations, and lykewise wee were his enemies: and yet he hath not letted to loue vs, and sende vs his good newes. And therefore wee ought to remember that wee which were of late Gentils in the fleshe, were at that time without Christ, stran∣gers Esa. 57. 10. & 66. 19. Eph. 2. 17. 11 in the common weale of Israel, and strangers of the alliances which contained promise, &c. But now by Iesus Christ, wee which were then a farre of, are made neere by the blood of Christ. 26 A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt spring. Men iudge by the world that they behaue themselues wel if they maintaine themselues peaceably with euery one, and that chiefly to liue in peace, one should bow downe himself before the wicked, flat∣tering them, and fauouring them, & should searche al the waies hee can to haue their grace. They thinke they doe not ill in thus doo∣ing, for they haue the Diuelish prouerbe in their heart and in their
mouthes which saith, that wee must liue by the quicke & not by the dead. And so they thinke a iust thing to make themselues compani∣ons or rather inferious to the wicked. But such iustice is no better then wickednesse it selfe. Solomon sheweth it wel saying, A righte∣ous man falling down before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, &c. Wherein hee sheweth vs that wee ought to perseuer in righteous∣nesse and integritie, to approue our iustice before God, and before his elect and faithful, Otherwise as the cleanest and purest fountaine of the world is vnprofitable, yea noisome and hurtful, if in treading in it with our feete, or otherwise we trouble it: or els if one cast in∣to the spring thereof any filth or poison to infect and corrupt it: Euē so if the iust man consent to the wicked, to bee at his commande∣ment and seruice, his righteousnes shalbe vnprofitable to him: and he wil make no conscience to giue himselfe to euil, to be a reproche and hurt to his neighbours, and to corrupt them: and so he shalbe no more righteous, but wicked and vniust, and as a corrupt spring is despised, and men let it goe to ruine: euen so the iust man which ioyneth himself to the wicked, and becommeth his peere in turning away from his righteousnesse, shal perish in his iniquitie. Nowe one ought not to finde it strange, that I say, the iust man turning away Eze. 18. 24. from his righteousnesse: for although that God be faithful, and per∣fourmeth the work which hee hath begunne in his faithful, to make them continue vnto the end, yet neuerthelesse as there is in some a temporal faith: so in some there is a temporal righteousnesse, as one may see it heere when Solomon saith, A righteous man falling Luk. 8. 13 downe before the wicked, &c. And also as one may see it in the place afore alledged out of Ezechiel. But one may say that many of the ancient holy fathers haue fallen downe before the wicked as A∣braham, the brethren of Ioseph, Iacob. And Ieremie admonisheth king Zedechias and his people to serue the king of Babylon. The Gen. 23. 7. 12 &. 47. 3. & 33. 3. Iere. 27. 12. Rom. 15. 1. Pet. 2. answere is, that it is not euil to bowe downe before the wicked for ceremonie, or to obey God, who putteth the wicked in prehemi∣nence and maketh vs subiect to them: but it is great wickednesse to encline to them, to fauour them, and consent to their iniquities. In the time of the primitiue church, the kinges and princes were infi∣dels, and yet neuerthelesse the Apostles woulde that men shoulde be subiect to them.
27 It is not good to eate much hony: so to search their owne glory, is not glory. Man from the beginning of his creation hath been constituted in glory & honor, being created of God to his image and likenes, & hauing obteined of him the rule ouer the earth, & al things therin Gen. 1. 27. 28 conteined, but man was not content with such glory, but was curi∣ous to exalt himselfe further, striuing to bee like God in disobeiyng Gen. 3. him, whereby hee fell: as hee hath wel perceined when hee hid him¦selfe amongest the trees in the garden of Eden. Ecclesiastes hath ex∣pressed this glory, and also the fall, saying: I haue thought in my Eccle. 3. 18. hearte of the estate of children of men, that God hath made them excellent, yet to see to, they are in themselues as beasts. Now as our first fathers haue not kept themselues in the glory which God hath giuen them, and therfore haue slided: euen so their posteritie hath doone after them. One may see it in Cain, who was not content with the honor of first begotten, but he would rule cruelly, & killed his brother Abel, and therefore he fel into an euerlasting curse. Pha∣rao Gen. 4. was not content to rule ouer the people of Egypt, but he would oppresse the people of Israel, and keepe them in bondage, and there∣fore he perished wickedly. One may heere put Absolom coueting, and gaping for the kingdome of his father: Dauid numbring his Exo. 14 people: Sennacherib besieging Ierusalem: and others, by whom one may see that it is not good to search ones owne glory. Nowe that which these heere, and others haue proued, Solomon pronounceth it when he saith, It is not good to eate much, &c. he saith so, because experience hath not touched our heartes as it ought, and that it is very needeful for vs to be reproued, and told of that expresly which we haue to follow or forsake. As in this present sentence we are ad∣monished not to be couetous of glory, otherwise we shalbe exposed to ignominie, as it is wel marked, saying, That it is no glory when men search their owne glory. Wherein we haue to note that wee make great account of them which are exalted in glory & honour, and esteeme them as holy: and if it be in our owne selues, we swa∣lowe it (as one would say) like sweete hony. And indeede also, it is not a thing to be reiected, that this glory when through the same we forget not ourselues, nor put not God, nor the dutie which we
beare to our neighbors in obliuion, seeing also that God which ex∣alteth them in glory which please him: and if we obteine any degree of honour, it is from him that we haue it: and as one may see it when he promiseth Abraham to make him grow into a great natiō. Gen. 12. 2. & 45. 8. 1. Chr. 29. 25 And Ioseph acknowledgeth his glory to come from God. And Solo∣mon obtained of God the glory of the kingdome, suche a one that no king before him had the like in Israel. But as God hath giuen vs the hony which is very sweete, & al other good meates for to main∣teine and keepe vs in this life: and yet if wee take too much of it, and vse it excessiuely wee receiue harme thereby: Euen so if we be couetous of honour, and search curiously our owne glory, wee fal into ignominie, as one may see it by the exāples alledged in the be∣ginning. Whosoeuer therfore exalteth himself, shalbe brought low, yea, by the hand of God, for he resisteth the proude. 28 A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles. Those people that wil keepe themselues safe from the danger of their enimies, & be in suretie, are careful to munite their townes & cities with strong and good walles al about, & if peraduenture there be any breach made, they are diligent to repaire it, to the ende that the enimie haue no entrance that way. Otherwise, if they make no account to enuiron the citie with good walles, it is open to the eni∣mie, & easily destroyed: for the enimies which craue but the ruine of the same, enter in as they wil, and pul it, and sack it at their pleasure: and so the citie is dispatched for lacke of walles, which is a miserable thing. Solomō compareth to such a citie, the man that refraineth not his appetite, and so approoueth him very miserable. And there∣fore that we may knowe how to eschewe such miserable destructi∣on, wee ought to vnderstande what it is that wee haue to doe, to refraine our owne appetite, and to be able to attaine to the same, wee haue to note that the appetite is taken diuersly in the Scrip∣ture. First for the inwarde part of man, in the which are resident vnderstanding, thoughtes, affections, willes, determinations and counsels. And because this part is corrupted by sinne, it is moo∣ued sooner to euil then to good: wherefore it hath neede to bee
restrained, otherwise it bringeth foorth the destruction of the man, Solomon hath shewed vs this. Contrariwise if the appetite be refrai∣ned, Pro. 16. 18. 19. 32. Mat. 12. 35. 36. 37. the man is preserued: as Solomon sheweth also. Secondly, it is takē for the spirit, that is, the blowing, or breathing of the mouth the which followeth the inwarde disposition: for of the abundance of the hearte, the mouth speaketh: if the breath bee good, good commeth to the man: but if it be euil, there followeth destruction. Let vs vnderstande therefore that it is very necessary for vs to re∣fraine both our inwarde and outwarde spirite or appetite: As also Saint Iames admonisheth vs to do. Iam. 1. 19. 20. The xxvi. Chapter. 1 AS the snowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Haruest are not meete: So is honour vnseemely for a foole. AS there are seasons wherein snowe and raine are profitable, as proofe sheweth it: so there are persons who are fit to bee exalted in honour, be∣cause they can wel vse the same, as doe the vertuous, fearing God, pru∣dent, sage, discrete, careful, and dili∣gent to doe their duetie in all vp∣rightnesse and integritie, without any lifting vp of their heartes, or ri∣sing vp aboue others, to despise them, molest them, or oppresse thē. Honour was very seem ely, for Abraham, Moses, Dauid, Ezechias, Iosias, Daniel, and other holy personages. Contrariwise, there are seasons wherein snowe doeth great hurt, as when it commeth is Sommer, when al the thinges of the earth haue neede of heate for to growe and to waxe ripe, the snowe that falleth, letteth them to prosper, for it cloieth the earth, & the thinges that she beareth.
Likewise the rayne which commeth in haruest, rotteth the corne & grasse which are cut downe, lying yet on the fielde. Nowe if wee feare the snowe in sommer, and the rayne in haruest, it behooueth vs greatly to feare, lest fooles be placed in honour and glorie. For as Solomon saieth, Honour is no more seemely for a foole, then snow in the sommer, and rayne in the haruest. If fooles be placed in ho∣nour, they cloye the earth: for, as much as in them lieth, they take the courage from them, which otherwise would giue themselues to wel doing. They freese the goods, for they hate them which seeke to prosper and increase, they rotte the grasse and corne: for as much as they can, they corrupt and destroy al good order, and good pol∣licie, and set and shew foorth slaunders, dissolutions, wantonnesse, wickednesse, infamie, filthinesse, villanie, and abhomination: as the wicked Kings and gouernours, and the false Prophetes haue done. And also nowe a dayes the Emperours and Kinges, the Pope & his Adherentes doe, which tende onely to destruction. Here we haue to note first of al, that Kinges, and al they which are in any prehe∣minence, or which haue any honourable gouernment, ought to be careful to refraine from al follie and wickednesse, and to giue them¦selues to prudence and sapience, and to doe their diligence, to abase and bring downe, yea, to roote out the foolish which are so vnpro∣fitable and hurtful, that if they be exalted, and once crept into cre∣dite and authoritie, they serue but as snow doeth in sommer, and Leuit. 26. Deut. 28. rayne in haruest. Secondly, as snow and rayne which commeth not in season, are the scourges of God, and his curses: euen so let vs vn∣derstand that God is angrie against vs, & that he chastizeth vs, when Esa 3. 2. & 29. 14. Osee. 13. 11. we haue fooles for rulers and gouernours: as also hee giueth it vs to vnderstande by his Prophetes. Thirdly, that the worlde asketh but her owne ruine and destruction. For as we see commonly, men seeke not to haue wise men to rule and gouerne them, but rather giue the authoritie thereof to fooles. 2 As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying e∣scape, so the curse that is causelesse, shal not come. Men set nettes, and prepare snares for birdes, who haue not deserued it: and it comes to passe often times that they loose both
their time and their labour: and the birdes haue no harme, but saue themselues and scape away by flying, and flye away, and so the bird-catchers obtaine not alwayes that which they desire, but are often frustrate of their intentes. Likewise mouthes that are ful of curses, striue to hurt the innocent without cause, who neuer offended thē, but the goodnesse of God which is verie succourable, serueth for feete and winges to them whom we curse wrongfully, and without cause. Insomuch that the curses which one casteth out against them, neuer touch them: for God turneth it away. Solomon teacheth vs this saying, As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swalowe by flying, escape, &c. Dauid had no euil through Goliah his curse, nor for the malediction of Semei. Also the children of God feele no euil for 1. Sam. 17. 43. 2. Sam. 16. 5. Mat. 5. 11. 44. the curse of the wicked: as Iesus Christ sheweth vs wel, but their curses returne rather vnto themselues, and they beare the paine thereof by the iust iudgement of God, as Goliah wel prooued it: for Dauid cut off his head with his owne weapon. Semei also proo∣ued it. And in many places God hath threatned malediction and punishment to them which curse without cause. Those therefore 1. King. 2. 42 Gen. 12. 3. & 27. 29. Exo. 21. 17. Leuit. 20. 9 Pro. 20. 20. Psal. 109. 17 2. King. 19. 6 which at randon and without iust occasion curse their neighbours, curse themselues, and hurt not them awhit whome they curse, ne∣uerthelesse they force not of it, wherefore they well deserued pu∣nishment. And thus while we are taught not to feare their curses: as the Prophete Esai admonisheth King Ezechias, and his folkes. And note wee, that it is not saide in general, that the curse shall not happen, But the vnreasonable curse, or the curse without cause: for if one curse vs iustly, it is to be feared, that wee shal feele the hurt of it, yea, by the iust vengeance of God, which wil hearken to the crye of them that curse vs. For this cause Ecclesiastes ad∣monisheth Eccle. 4. 5. 6. vs not to giue occasion to any bodie to curse vs: for the prayer (sayeth hee) of him that curseth thee, in the bitternesse of his soule, shalbe heard of him that created it. And this is in folow∣ing that which Moyses pronounceth, and as by witnesse wee see, that the curse vttered for good cause, commeth to passe, euen so, Deu. 15. 9. wee haue examples thereof. Moyses prayed against Core: Ely cursed the messengers of King Ochosias: Elisee, cursed the young Num. 16. 15.
children, and twoo Beares to are twentie and twoo of them in peeces. Saint Peter cursed Ananias and Sapphira, and they fell 2. Kin. 1. 10. & 2. 24. Act. 5. 3. 4. 9. & 13. 10 downe dead: Saint Paule cursed Elymas, and hee became blinde. 3 As the whip is for the Horse, & the bridle for the Asse: so is the rodde for the fooles backe. It is written, I wil giue thee vnderstanding, and wil teache Psal. 32. 8. 9. thee the way wherein thou shalt walke, &c. And this is to the end that wee be not fooles, and without reason: as also we are warned thereof, Be not as the Horse, or Mule which are without vnder∣standing. Otherwise, as men tame Horses, Asses, and Mules by bridles, spurres and whippes, or by other meanes, euen so the Lord hath ordeined chastisementes and punishments for to tame fooles, and roote them out if they be vncorrigible. As one may see by the Pal. 2. 9. & 89. 31. threatninges which are in the scriptures, and nowe heere when it is saide, As the whip is for the Horse, &c. Now euen as great Lordes, for to tame their Horses and other beastes, haue men to whome they giue the charge thereof: euen so our God hath his men to whome hee committeth the charge of guiding them, which haue neede to bee tamed: hee hath giuen to his Prophetes and A∣postles, to his Ministers and Pastours his worde, which is a cut∣ting sworde, more sharpe then any two edged sworde. This word hath bene committed, I say, to the Prophetes and Apostles, and to Hebr. 5. 12. Esai. 49. 2. Ier. 1. 9. 10. 2. Cor. 10. 4. Rom. 13. 1. Pet. 2. Pro. 13. 24. & 22. 15. & 23. 13. 14. Pro. 1. 26. al Ministers for the chastisement, yea, for the destruction of the re∣bellious. Hee hath giuen Kinges and Princes, Superiours and Go∣uernours, the rodde of yron, to wit, the sworde, to chastise fooles. Hee hath also ordeined that fathers and mothers shoulde cor∣rect their children. Briefly, all those, which haue any prehemi∣nence or superioritie, haue charge from God to chastise the foo∣lishe which are committed to their charge. That if the foo∣lishe remayne vncorrigible and obstinate, they shall not one∣lye feele the temporal rodde, but as one is constrayned to murther and kill the Horse which will in no wyse bee tamed,
euen so the fooles that are obstinate, shal perishe euerlastingly. And as an horse which wil not be tamed, ouerthroweth his maister, euē Eze. 3. 18. so, when one correcteth not the foolish, hee goeth to perdition as hee wel deserueth, and as it is wel giuen vs to vnderstande. And al∣though the foolishe be not corrected, yet they cease not to perishe, Saint Paule sheweth it. It is meete then that the great men which Rom. 2. 12. are in authoritie and power, and those which haue superintendance and gouernment, bee wakeful, and heedie, to vse the rodde which God hath giuen them, in chastizing, & punishing, in admonishing, and reproouing, correcting and threatning: and that inferiors and al they which knowe not howe to guide themselues, should sub∣mit themselues to that discipline which is conuenient for them. For if bruite beastes which haue neither sense nor reason, endure to be tamed, it is good reason that men who ought to haue vnderstan∣ding, be not more wilde and sauagde, to the ende that, that be not laide against them, which Moses rebuked the children of Israel with. He which ought to be righteous, is waxen fat, and hath kicked with his heele. And though that God hath his seruants to tame and cha∣stise Deu. 32. 15. Esai. 1. 2. fooles, yet neuerthelesse they profite nothing, if hee himselfe put not to his hande, as Moyses wel sheweth. For although that he admonisheth the children of Israel, Circumcise the forepart of your Deut. 10. 16 heartes, &c. Hee sheweth them notwithstanding afterwardes that his admonition is nothing, if God himselfe worke not, when hee saieth, The Lorde thy God shal circumcise thy heart, &c. Euen so Dent. 30. 6. Ier. 31. 18. 19. doeth the Prophet Ieremie. 4 Answere not a foole according to his foolishnesse, lest thou also be like to him. Men see by experience in this worlde that fooles haue power, credite, and authoritie, that they are at their ease and prosperitie, according to outwarde apparance. And for this cause men doubt them and feare them: or els haue them in admiration, and desire their alliance vnder hope that they shalbe wel aduanced, and profite by their meanes. But bee it for feare, or for hope, men fauour and flatter them, and seeke to couenant and agree with them, without displeasing them any way. And whereas they commit great wicked∣nesse,
men wil say to them it is wel done, yea, they wil incourage them to folowe their wicked enterprises: as the flatterers did Saul, against Dauid, and them which fauoured him, and gaue him ayde and succour. They did this, to be welcome to Saul who was a wic∣ked foole. And therefore those which doe so, are wicked and foo∣lishe, as them to whom they consent and accord. Solomon wil not haue vs to resemble them: as he sheweth, when he saith, Answere not a foole, &c. To answere, in this case, is not to satisfie in wordes any question or demaund: but it is to fulfil, couenant, and accorde to the wil and appetite of another. For why the scripture applieth it selfe often to our maner of speaking: for if any one wil say, that two thinges accorde and agree wel together, hee saieth, that they answere wel one to an other. Contrariwise, if any one condiscend not to our opinion, wee say, that hee answereth not our purpose: and this is because if one aske vs of any thing which wee know, and which pleaseth vs, we answere willingly: but if it displease vs, wee nodde the head, and vouchsafe not to open the mouth to answere. And wee vnderstande that Solomon would that we should disdaine fooles, and that wee should shewe no signe of consenting to their follie, otherwise we are in danger to be put in a reprobate sense, and to be abandoned to al follie. For if euil talke corrupt good maners: the conuersation and accorde which we haue with the foolishe, wil make vs fooles and wicked, according to the foolishnesse and wic∣kednesse 1. Cor. 15. 33. which wee shal see, and to the which wee consent: as with theeues, one becommeth a theefe: and with Idolaters, and Idolater. Wherefore we ought to take careful heed that we answere not Pa∣pistes and other heretikes. 5 Answere a foole according to his foolishnesse: lest hee be wise in his owne conceit. It seemeth at first viewe, that this sentence is quite contrarie to the former. Neuerthelesse it is not lawfull to thinke nor say that there is any contrarietie: for they are spoken both by one and the same spirite of trueth, which can not be contrarie. Wherefore we ought here to take answere otherwise then in the former sentence. For if one condiscended to the foole, and accorded to his follie, he
giueth him occasion to esteeme himselfe wise: which Solomon wil not haue done, no more then he wil that we be like vnto them. And therefore note wee, that the foole seeketh wholly to persuade him∣selfe that hee is wise, and can not abide one to reprooue him, nor reprehende him for his follie. For this cause, to the end that as much as in vs lyeth, we suffer not the foole to bee so abused. Solomon admonisheth vs to answere him according to his follie: that is to say, to rebuke him, and tel him sharply and seuerely, that there is nothing but follie in him, and that he is voide of al wisedome. Thus doing, he wil knowe that he is a foole, and wil seeke to amend him¦selfe, if so be it, hee be not altogether vncorrigible, and of the num∣ber of them which are sharpely rebuked and threatned. We haue therefore to answere and resist the Papists, and principally the most Pro. 1. 24. esteemed: for, because they are not resisted, but that the ignorant people fauoureth them, and hath them in admiration, they waxe so proud, and it seemeth them, that they are wise men of the world. And note wee, that Solomon speaketh principally to them which haue preheminence, or super intendance. 6 Hee that sendeth a message by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniqui∣tie. It is verie meete and necessarie, that one be wel aduised & care∣ful to take heede, whome hee putteth in trust to doe his businesse, and chiefly those which are of great importance. See Pharao King of Egypt, who hauing considered the wisedome and vnderstanding of Ioseph, made him ruler and gouernour ouer his countrey. Also Nabuchodonozer hauing seene the great vnderstanding of Daniel, honoured him, and made him gouernour. It behooueth one ther∣fore Gen. 41. 28 Dan. 2. 48. Exo. 18. 21 to be careful to regarde who those be which are fit and capable to deale in affayres, and to commit them to their charge: as Iethro telleth Moyses. Saint Paule declareth it plainly. 1. Tim. 3. & Tit. 1. and in other places. If one doe contrarie, not onely hee laboureth in vaine, but also hath hurt thereby, as Solomon sheweth it, when he saieth,
He that sendeth a message, or he which committeth his affaires, &c. If hee haue domage thereby, he wel deserueth it. For (as wee see heere) in committing any affaires to fooles, one doeth them in∣iurie: seeing it is as though hee cut off their feete, and constrayned them to goe. Nowe hee that doeth such iniurie or violence to his neighbour, meriteth wel to drinke the iniquitie, and susteine the losse: they therefore which fauour the wicked, and to aduaunce them, place them in office, doe them iniurie, and violence: for they laye vpon them a charge which they cannot wel weild, but as a man which hath his feete cut off, so that hee cannot goe, to beare any message from farre: and as suche a one doeth rather fal and hurt himselfe, than goe: euen so the wicked cannot, nor wil not doe their duetie, when they haue any commission: and therefore they goe to ruine and destruction, and they which so haue cut their legs off, remaine not vnpunished, but drinke the iniquitie. If there∣fore wee loue the profite and health of our neighbours, and our owne, let vs not put to charge or office those whom we know to be fooles, and wicked persons. 7 Lift vp the legs of a lame man: so shalbe a sentence in a fooles mouth. Lame men haue commonly one leg long, and another shorte: whereof it commeth that they cannot goe at their ease, nor as they woulde: and so their going is not pleasant. And though one seeke to helpe them in lifting vp the one of their legges or both, yet they goe neuer a whit the better. Lykewise if fooles study to pronoūce a∣ny thing of excellencie, they cannot compasse it, nor their woordes are not acceptable, but to them only which are like vnto them, and although they haue some which by flatterie seeke to giue them hart to say wel: Yet neuerthelesse their wordes are not amended. Solo∣mon maketh such a comparison, saying, Lift vp the legs, &c. The which comparison is very conueniēt for although the foole haue but one mouth, yet when hee forceth himselfe to speake wel, hee halteth. For as one legge of a lame man, or one side when hee walketh, answereth not the other and is not agreeable too it: euen so when the foole will meddle to
speake wel, his mouth is not agreeable to his heart. Hee hath a short heart as concerning excellent thinges indeede: for hee dispi∣seth & reiecteth them, and filleth himself with affections, thoughts, willes, and determinations out of order, and by hypocrisie and am∣bition, seeketh to stretch his mouth to thinges, by the which hee may bee in admiration, to the ende that men may say of him as of Herod, The voyce of a God, and not of a man. But meane while, Act. 12. 22. as they which haue a cleare sight, know wel that the lame mans go∣ing is not good: Euen so, they which haue the vnderstanding of the trueth, discerne easilie betweene that which is wel, and that which is yl saide, although one seeke neuer so to disguise himselfe. Behold the children of Israel boasted themselues to be the people of God, and made profession to serue him: but Ely filled with the spirite of god, knew wel that they were lame, what faire sacrifices soeuer they made: and therefore hee saide to them: Howe long wil you halt 1. Kin. 18. 21 on both sides? Wherefore if wee wil speake vprightly of thinges which are worthie to be heard, it behoueth vs to put of al folly, and receiue the instruction of wisedome to frame our hearts wel, to the end that a sentence may be fit for our mouthes. 8 As a precious stone closed vp in a heape of stones: so is hee which giueth glory to a foole. If wee finde it strange and without al reason that one shoulde hyde amongest a great heape of common stones, a precious stone, because it is a rare thing, and men make much account of it: for it hath other vertues then the rest, and is more delectable to the sight, and while it is thus inclosed, it is almost vnpossible to finde it, and lieth to no vse, for one hath neither profite, nor pleasure therby: E∣uen so wee ought to thinke it an vnreasonable thing to see fooles e∣steemed, and exalted to glory, for glorie is an excellent gift of God which exalteth them that seeme worthie. And those which desire it, haue not stil the inioying of it, but are often cast off, and depri∣ued of it vtterly. And in steede of glory, reape contēpt, rebuke, and
ignomie. For fooles knowe not howe to vse glorie according as it is appointed by God, but rather abuse it, when in steede of giuing themselues to grauitie, vertue, magnanimitie, prudence and wise∣dome, Pro. 25. 27 they folowe lightnesse, vice, pusillanimitie, blockishnes, va∣nitie, and follie: and so their glorie can be neither profitable nor de∣lectable, no more then a precious stone which is inclosed so farre in a heape of stones, that one cannot come by it. Wherefore they which haue power to distribute states and degrees, are here taught, that if they wil not loose the precious stone, they should take heede not to aduance fooles, malicious persons, dissolute and loose liuers, nor any suche: because it is a thing lost. For as one cannot see a precious stone shine, which is inclosed in a heape of cōmon stones, as wel for the multitude, as for the grosenesse and waight of the stones which are vpon it: euen so, the foolishe abound so much in vanities and follies, in filth and infamie, in scandales, and dissolu∣tions, in malices and wickednesse, and are so wayghed downe with the same: that they darken, and adnihilate the glorie in which they are placed: for they themselues thinke, say, and doe, things which tende to the extinguishing of it. And so they are wholy vn worthie: yea, what greatnesse or noblenesse soeuer they haue, yet they are notcapable thereof: no more then it is to hide a precious stone in a heape of stones bee it neuer so great. Saul was mightie and puisāt, & yet neuertheles he shewed himself vnworthie of the glory 1. Sam. 9. 1. 2. & 15. 11 23. & 16. 1. 1. Sam. 16. 7 12. 13. of the kingdom. Dauids brethren were greater then he, and yet they were deiected, in that they were not annointed, and Dauid the least of them al was annointed for King. Euen so, although the Pope haue power and authoritie, yet neuerthelesse, hee is not capable of the glorie which the world giueth him. 9 As a thorne standing vp in the hand of a drunkarde, so is a parable in the mouth of fooles. The man that is giuen to drinke much, and so is drunke, is so blockish, dull, and foolish, so voide of sense, reason, vnderstan∣ding
and feeling, that hee seeth not commonly, nor knoweth not what it is that he hath or holdeth in his hande, nor howe he ought to vse that which he hath betweene his fingers. He makes no more difficultie to gripe in his hande a sharpe thorne, then he doth a soft feather, & wil giue it to kisse to them whō he meeteth, as if it were a nosegaye of flowers, or sweete smelling hearbes. And in this wise hee sheweth that he careth not what harme he doe to himselfe, nor to his neighbours: but as he pricketh himselfe, so he pricketh and spoyleth them which doe him no hurt, and which likewise desire that he were in sounde estate and good disposition. And so we see that the drunkarde leadeth a miserable and wicked life: whereby it appeareth that one ought to haue drunkennesse in great horror and detestation, and flye the company of drunkardes, as a madde Lion, or any sauage beast. Nowe if wee ought to take heede, of a thorne standing vp in the hande of a drunkarde, because he cannot han∣dle it as hee ought: euen so wee ought to vnderstande, that fooles wordes are verie dangerous. As Solomon pronounceth it, say∣ing, As a thorne standing vp, &c. Wherein wee haue to note, that as the drunkarde maketh no difficultie to pricke his neighbors, and hurt them with some thorne, or other sharp instrument which he hath in his hande: euen so the foolishe are hardie and rashe to pronounce wordes, or speeches which are yrksome, grieuous, or hurtful to their neighbours. And that in diuers sortes: for some speake to their neighbours, making no shewe to hurt them, and yet secretly practise their death. As Cain dealt with his brother, when they were together on the fielde. Cain rose vp against his brother Gen. 4. 8. 2. Sam. 3. 27. & 20. 9. 10 & 11. 6. Mat. 26. 49. & 22. 15. Gen. 39. 17 Mat. 26. Luk. 23. Abel, and killed him. Ioab killed Abner in treason: the same Ioab killed also Amasa by treason. Dauid vsed such faynednesse towardes Vrias. Iudas and the Pharisies towardes Christ. Other backbite and defame in secrete, as those which in the absence of Dauid spake yl of him to Saule. Others beare false witnesse, as Iosephes maisters wife: and the Iewes against Iesus Christ. Others speake openly foule woordes and outrages against the innocent, as if they were greatly woorthie of blame, as they did to the Prophetes, to Ie∣sus Christ and his Apostles, and as they doe presently to the true
seruants of God. And (which is the most sharpe and pricking thorn of al) some beare about false doctrine, the which pricketh the soules to death. And so the mouth of Papistes is the most dangerous, and they are the wickeddest and woorst fooles of the world. One may adde those Magistrates who insteede of pronouncing equitie, make vnlawful ordinances, and giue wrong iudgement. Wee haue al∣so to note, that as the drunkarde pricketh himselfe, euen so fooles wordes are their owne destruction: as it hath bene alreadie shew∣ed, both by witnesse and examples. Forasmuch therefore, as wee wil not be reputed drunkardes, nor fooles, let vs looke that wee cast away thornes, and carie sentences which are not pricking, & that no woorde passe out of our mouth which is not sounde, pleasaunt, and amiable, to the glorie and honour of God, and to the edifica∣tion and health of vs and our hearers. And this is that which ap∣pertaineth principally to Ministers of the word, and to them which are committed to doe iustice and iudgement, and this, towardes them which yelde themselues tractable and readie to be taught. For we ought to vse thornes against them which are obstinate and vn∣corrigible: not fearing to incurre the note of drunkennesse or of fol∣lie. Some saide, that Iesus Christ had Belzebub, that he was a glut∣ton, Mat. 12. 24. & 11. 19 Act. 2. 13. a drunkard, and a friend to them that liued wickedly. And that the Apostles were drunke, but being assd that they walked vp∣rightly, they letted not to pricke where it was needeful. So ought al they to doe, which haue any administration, to guid thēselues vp∣rightly in prudence and wisedome. 10 The mightie man doeth al thinges by himselfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the trans∣gressours. When Solomon praiseth the man that is great & excellent in vertue, insomuch that he is sufficient of himselfe to doe his office and duetie, euen so he doth it, and applieth himselfe therto careful∣ly: and to expresse this same, he saieth, That he doth al things: and blameth the foole which hireth folkes to doe his businesse. It may seeme at first view, that Solomō reputeth thē fooles that haue hired
seruantes vnder them, to doe their woorke in the house, or in the towne, or in the fielde: and herein hee should blame the good an∣tient Fathers, and good Kinges which haue had a multitude of per∣sons in their wages, and himselfe also, for hee had no smal com∣pany to serue him, as the holie historie reciteth. But Solomons intent was not suche. For also it is lawful, yea necessarie that they Eccle. 5. 10 Exod. 18. which haue much to do, set many about it, to helpe and aide them. For what force, vertue, or sufficiencie soeuer they haue, they cannot perfourme al. And chiefly when a man hath store of goods, he vseth deedes of charitie when hee hyreth poore folkes to let them gaine their bread, & paieth them their wages faithfully. It behooueth al∣so, as there where are many goods, are many eaters: so there where are many things to doe, must be many workers, as Iethro sheweth it to Moses. Solomons intent therefore is to praise them, which are so growne and augmented in vertue, that feeling their ablenes they wil not be idle, but rather of free courage employ themselues to do al things which are for their calling and duetie: and so they put the talents of the Lorde to profite. And contrariwise, his meaning is to blame the foolish naughtipackes, which despise al vertue, & also are void therof: and therfore they neither can nor wil apply themselues to their worke, but rather hire folks for wages, not regarding if they be sufficient, or if they haue courage to do wel. As Solomō marketh it, when he saith, That the foole giueth wages to the transgressors. That is, to them which passe ouer or aboue that which is their due∣tie, despising it, and rather giuing themselues to doe the contrarie. And heerein is accomplished the common prouerbe, Like maister, like man. Vnderstande wee therefore, that it behooueth vs to in∣crease daily in vertue, to the end we may need no Vicar, Suffragan, nor Liefetenant, but that hauing negligence & sloath in disdaine, & despising al ease, delight, and pleasure of carnal rest, wee may giue ourselues carefully to doe our duetie, yea, when for the same, wee must endure afflictions and calamities, iniuries and wronges, reproche and ignomie. Let vs folowe Moyses who carefully and faythfully did his duetie, what difficulties soeuer came, as one may see it in the scriptures. Now although such care appertain chiefly to greatmē of the earth
(as likewise the first worde of this sentence signifieth it, the which we haue expounded mightie, and one may terme it, Maister, Lorde, Num. 12. 7 Hebr. 3. 2. 5. & 11. 24. excellent and vertuous) and that it apperteineth also to al thē which haue any gouernment or superintendance: for they ought aboue al men to acknowledge the honour wherein God hath placed them, and not to be vnthankful for the same, as Kinges and Princes of the earth, which are falne a sleepe in their owne delightes, & drunk with worldly pleasures, pleasing themselues in their owne loftines: and meanewhile make no account to doe their duetie, but hyre men for wages, yea, negligent men who most commonly ouerturne right. And although the Pope and his great Minions, Cardinalls, and Bishoppes, bee not so exalted by God, but rather by the Deuil, whome they serue and doe homage too: yet neuerthelesse, because they vaunt themselues to be Vicars of Iesus Christ, and successors of the Apostles, which were men sufficient enough to doe their of∣fice, and applied it: for this cause we wil put them in the ranke and number of fooles, which do nothing but haue their Vicars, & suf∣fragans, the which they hyre for benefices, & take no care if they be honestmē or no, for why they wil haue thē no better thā thēselues: and if they were honestmen, they would not be serued with suche, but rather would burn them. Although (I say) that greatmen aboue al others, ought to be careful to do their duetie themselues: yet ne∣uerthelesse, it is meete that al they that are called to the knowledge of the trueth, & make profession to be Christians, be careful to im∣ploy themselues faithfully to do al things which are for their estate, duetie, and office: as wee are wel taught the same in the similitude of talents. Meanewhile let vs take heede of such pride and presump∣tion, Mat. 24. & 25. 2. Cor. 3. 5 Phil. 2. 13. not to esteeme ourselues so mightie, that of ourselues we may fulfil that which is our duetie: seeing wee are not able enough to think any thing of ourselues, as of ourselues, but our ablenesse and might is from God. It is also he which woorketh in vs both the wil and the effect, according to his good pleasure. Also when Solomon saieth, That the mightie man doeth, &c. Hee wil not establishe free wil, but that wee should giue ourselues to worke, without trusting to our neighbours. For God appointeth vs not, making vs vertuous and able, to liue without doing any thing, & passing away the time pleasantly, but that we labour al our time.
11 The foole which beginneth his follie afreshe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit. By the corruption and wickednesse of our nature wee are de∣spoiled of the true knowledge of God, without the which we haue neither religion nor reuerence, nor feare of him, so that wee are depriued of al wisedome, and are fooles, without sense, reason, and vnderstanding. And there is none but of himselfe is suche a one, what worldly wisedome soeuer he haue, for al the imagination of the thoughtes of the heart of man, are onely euil at al times, and Gen. 6. 5. & 8. 21. Psal. 14. 1. 2. 3. the conceiuing of the heart of man, is wicked from his youth vp. And therefore Dauid maketh great complaintes thereof: and so of ourselues we are ignorant, blinde, wicked and naughtie, and can not bee otherwise, vntil suche time as God lighten and regenerate vs, giuing vs true intelligence of his worde, and reforming our heartes, to the ende wee may liue after the same: for this word is our vnderstanding and wisedome: and therefore we ought to re∣ceiue it, and imprint it in our heartes, to the ende it may make vs vomit al the follie of our natural corruption, and that we may bee wel purged from our filthinesse and infections, and that we vomit it in suche sorte, that wee neuer returne theretoo againe, but that we haue it in horrour and disdaine, and that wee flye it as poyson, and feare it as a mortal pestilence: otherwise our later condition woulde be farre woorse then the former, and we should giue Satan a more easie accesse then he had afore. Solomon marketh vs out Mat. 12. 43. 2. Pet. 2. 20 the corruption, and returne to the same, when he saieth, The foole which beginneth his follie afreshe. And after hee noteth the mise∣rable condition, saying, Is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vo∣mit. Wherin we haue to note first of al, that it is not without cause that hee calleth men foolishe: for from the beginning he hath for∣saken his Creator from whom commeth al wisdom. Now if for this cause he merite to be called foole, by a more reason hee is wel wor∣thie of this name, when hauing bin instructed in the word of truth, which is the true wisdom: he returneth to his follie: for in so doing he apostateth, & reuolteth from wisdom, to whom afterwardes he cannot haue recourse. For those which once haue bin lightened and
haue tasted the sweete word of God, if they fal again, it is vnpossible that they should be renued by repentance, &c. Secondly we haue to Hebr. 6. note, that although God haue eternally reprooued the folish which apostate and reuolt from wisedome, and that the first cause of their apostacie is eternal reprobation: yet neuertheles, God ought not to be so blamed in no wise for their apostacie. For it is the foole which beginneth his follie afresh: as Solomon sheweth it, &c. Third∣ly note we, that although the elect of God after being called to the knowledge of the trueth, commit follies, either through wickednes, or by ignorance or fragilitie, yet neuerthelesse they begin not their follie afresh: as we may see it here, when Solomon compareth the foole which beginneth his follie a newe, to the Dogge which eateth that which he hath vomitted: for there are none but the reprobate which are like to such dogges. For although such dogges, after recei∣uing again that which they haue vomited, do not return to it again: euen so the reprobate being gone backe from the holie commande∣ment, which they haue receiued, doe neuer returne by repentance. But the elect of God are not denied repentaunce: as the scripture doth witnesse in diuers places: and as there are therof diuers exam∣ples: and their last state is better then the first: for they obteine for∣giuenesse of their sinnes by the precious blood of Iesus Christ: but the reprobate lye stil wallowing in their filthinesse: and are like not onely vnto dogges, but also vnto swine, which after their wa∣shinges, 2. Pet. 2. 22. do returne to wallow in the myre. Therfore, when we are deliuered from the filthinesse of the world, through the knowledge of the word of God, let vs see that we accomplishe our saluation in Mat. 12. 34. 32. Hebr. 6. 4. & 10. 26. feare and trembling: for if we returne vnto our foolishnesse, sin∣ning against the holie Ghost, we can not obtaine forgiuenesse of our sinnes. 12 Seest thou a man wise in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him. We naturally do desire to be wel esteemed and accounted of a∣mongst our neighbours, & would haue men to hope wel of vs. This desire is good & cōmēdable, so that in attaining the effect therof, we behaue & gouern ourselues, in the feare of God, & reuerence of his worde, with humilitie and modestie towardes our neighbours, and
that we may truely protest with Dauid, Lorde, I am not high min∣ded: I haue no proud lookes, &c. For if we thinke to set foorth our¦selues, Psal. 131. 1 and to bee esteemed as being wise and able enough to win reputation, not needing to bee admonished nor rebuked: and that wee bee so puffed vp with our worldly and carnal wisedome, that wee can abide no admonition, nor correction, wee depriue ourselues of al good reputation, and are in the way to bee coun∣ted woorse then fooles, which are so corrupted, that they haue no minde nor desire after wisedome, nor to get reputation. And indeede, they which thinke themselues wise enough, are worse to be corrected and reformed then fooles, which are vtterly voyde of wit and reason. Solomon doeth so pronounce it, saying, Seest thou, &c. This thing hath beene prooued, as the scripture sheweth. The Scribes and Pharisies thought themselues iust and wise, and there∣by remained obstinate and hardened, and woulde not receiue Iesus 1. Cor. 1. 30 Mat. 3. 7. & 9. 9. & 12. 3. & 15. 13. & 21. 31. & 23 13. Luk. 7. 29. & 15. 1. 2. & 16 14. 15. & 19 2. Pro. 3. 5. 6. 7. Rom. 12. 16. Esai. 5. 21. Luk. 16. 15. 1. Pet. 5. . 1. Cor. 3. 18 19. Col. 3. 12. Phil. 2. 3. Christ, who of God is made vnto vs wisedome. But the Publicans and whoremongers did confesse their follies and wickednesses, and repented their sinnes, & beleeued in Iesus Christ, receiuing him for their redeemer and Sauiour: but those Scribes & Pharisies, which were wise in their owne conceite, scorned him, refused him, and persecuted him vnto death. For this cause are they sharply rebuked, threatned, and condemned, & the tolegatherers & whoremongers, are comforted, and receiue hope to be saued Therfore if we would that men should conceiue a good hope of vs, let vs folow that which Solomon doeth teache vs, saying: Trust thou in the Lorde with al thine heart, and leane not vnto thine own wisdom, &c: and S Paule saieth, Be not high minded, &c. Otherwise, though the world were dazeled with our pompe and faire shew, yet should wee be litle the better for it: for we can not deceiue God which resisteth the proud, abhorreth the high minded, and curseth the arrogant. Wee see ther∣fore, that it is verie necessarie for vs to folow the aduertisements of Saint Paule: If any amongest you seeme wise, let him become a foole in this world, that hee may be made wise. Moreouer, let vs note, that when Solomon saieth, More hope is of a foole then of him, &c. This is no more to say, that he alloweth folishnes to cause vs to continue therin: then when S. Paul saith, that where sin aboū∣ded, Rom. 5. 20. there did grace more aboūd: he alloweth not sin, neither would
he haue vs to cōtinue therein, that grace might abound: otherwise Solomon shoulde builde that which hee had destroied, and destroy that which hee had builded. Let vs vnderstande then that Solo∣mon compareth him, which praiseth himselfe, and wil not suffer too be admonished, with him that suffereth himselfe to bee caried a∣way of his vnbrideled concupiscences, and yet doeth presume no∣thing of himselfe, whome hee calleth foole: and pronounceth that wee ought rather to hope for the amendment of such a foole, then of him which thinketh himselfe to bee wise. And thus he doth close∣ly admonish vs, to forsake our foolishnes, that mē may not hope in Pro. 22. 1 vaine of vs, and that we should obteine good fame and renowme: the which is more to be desired thē great riches. And thus we may desire it, so it be done without ambitiō, & onely seeking the glory of God, and the profite of our neighbour: and not to be praised there∣fore, Mat. 6. 23. and to be made a wonderment, for to bee worshipped: as doe the hypocrites, whom Iesus Christ taxeth. 13 The slouthfull man saith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the streetes. When God doeth commande or forbiddeth vs any thing, or that hee doeth place vs in any estate, and calleth vs vnto any vo∣cation, we must imploy ourselues therin with al care and diligence, without stopping or lingering to consider the hurtes, or feare the dangers which may happen: following the good olde fathers: as Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob. Likewise God shewed vnto Moses that wee must not striue against that which God commandeth, and wil haue no man to leaue of his charge which hee hath giuen him, Ge. 12. & 31▪ Exo. 4. 11 Ier. 1. 7. 17 for feare of dangers. But they which wil neither obey God nor their superiours, but wil liue after their fantazie, and to doe little, or nothing, are readie to alledge excuses, and to lay for themselues the dangers which are to bee feared and auoided, as they thinke. Wee must not follow the example of such, except wee woulde bee Mat. 10. 28. counted amongst the number of the slouthful, and to bee blamed with them: as we see that Solomon doth rebuke them, saying, The slouthfull man saith, a Lion, &c. Wherein hee sheweth that they which wil not doe their duetie, doe forge fantastical excuses,
without knowledge that it is so indeede. For hee saith not, that the slouthful knoweth that the Lyon is in the way, but onely that the slouthful man saith it. And for to shewe howe the slouthfull man is very desirous to make excuses, hee repeateth againe his say∣ing. Amongst the number of such slouthfulmen, wee may place the Nichodemites, which doe carefully excuse themselues for that that they knowe not what shal happen and betide them, and thinke thereby to bee excused from making confession of their faith. Now that wee may not bee of the same number, let vs assure ourselues of the promise of our Lorde, Beholde I giue you power, Luke. 10. 19 to treade vpon Serpentes, and Scorpions, and ouer al the power of the enimie, and nothing shal hurt you. Nowe that they which disdaine and refuse to doe their dueties, do not know whether the dangers for the which they excuse themselues from labour, are present, or to come. Solomon doth shewe it when hee saith. 14 As the dore turneth vpon his henges, so doth the slouth∣full man vpon his bed. When the slouthful man remooueth not out of the house, no more then the doore which hangeth vpon his henges, yea doth not stirre out of his bed, turning and tossing nowe on the one side, and nowe on the other: as doeth the doore which is put to and fro, doeth not remooue from his place, but doeth turne hyther and thither vpon his henges, hee cannot certenly knowe what is doone in the streetes) but doth feare paine so much, and liketh so wel of the rest, that he forgeth in himselfe excuses, by the which he laboureth to shewe, or also to make himselfe beleeue, hee hath good cause to abstaine from labour. Notwithstanding hee is not without paine, neither hath such rest as hee woulde: otherwise hee woulde not seeke it as hee doeth, turning himselfe in his bed: for if he rested after his desire, and at his ease, hee woulde not turne so often from one side to another: but hee tosseth and turneth seeking the rest that he hath not. And so they which passe not of doing their duety and office, ceasse not to bee without paine, though they labour to a∣uoide
it: albeit they haue none without, yet doe they feele it with∣in: and though they are not troubled with those that apperteine nothing to their charge, yet are they vexed and molested with their housholde. Neuerthelesse let vs not thinke that Solomon woulde rebuke al them which turne them in their beds for to take the bet∣ter rest: for it is lawful for them which haue laboured sore in the day, to take their rest at night, that they may bee the better dispo∣sed on the morrowe after for to doe their duetie: but hee blameth those which doe eschue and flie paine and labour, and doth declare them to bee vnprofitable: as also hee doeth againe immediatly, fo∣lowing, when hee addeth. 15 The slouthfull hideth his hand in his bosome, & it gree∣ueth him to put it againe to his mouth: And heerewith hee sheweth that through his slouthfulnesse hee must needs come vnto great miserie, as hath been declared. But it seemeth that Solomon speaketh heere, somewhat by an Ironie, and after our kinde of speache. For if wee see any man which wil∣lingly abstaineth from labour, though hee bee a strong and bolde ea∣ter, and that hee spareth not his hande for to thrust it often to his mouth, yet in mocking him, and rebuking him for that hee is not quicke and nimble, but to eate and drinke, wee say vnto him, Thou labourest sore, and takest great paines to lift thy hand to thy mouth. He sweateth (wil some say) for paines hee taketh in eating. And we must not wonder though Solomon doeth scorne and floute the slouthful: for they doe wel deserue it, seeing they wil eate their bread in idlenesse, which is not lawful. 16 The sluggarde is wiser in his owne conceit, then seuen men that can render a reason. Hee sheweth wel that slouthfulnesse is a very dangerous vice, and that if a man delight therein, hee waxeth obstinate and indu∣rate: in suche wise as it seemeth there is no good, nor better, nor more goodly estate then to liue without doing of any thing, and in being idle, They are flouted which let themselues out to
hyre, setting themselues diligently on worke: neither can suche as wil not worke, indure their exhortations, admonitions, and corre∣ctions which doe reasonably, and as behoueth exhorte them to la∣bour, and to set themselues on work, for to doe their duetie, and to giue good example vnto their neighbours. Of the number of such slouthful persons, which are so wise in their owne conceite, are the Pope, Cardinals, Bishops, Priestes, and Monkes, which labour too make themselues beleeue that they lead an angelical and perfite life, in doing nothing but onely occupied about an heape of trifles, yea vngodlinesses. For though the Lorde shoulde raise them vp seuen, that is to say, diuers persons that can giue a reason, aswel in labou∣ring as in exhorting them, yet woulde they nothing esteeme it, but woulde rather despise them, yea persecute them: as wee may see by the fires thar are dayly kindeled. In the same number wee may set whooremongers, gluttous, drunkardes, and gamesters. 17 Hee that passeth by and medleth with the strife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares. As God hateth and abhorreth him that soweth strife between brethren: euen so also hee loueth and accepteth him that is carefull Pro. 6. 19 Mat. 5. 9. for to make peace betweene brethren: yea hee accounteth him for his childe: for blessed are the peacemakers, for they shalbe called the children of God. Wherevpon it may seeme (as also it is the trueth) that there is no strife but that wee shoulde labour to appease and quiet it, when wee once knowe of it, and are come where it is, and that we haue the power to reconcile the parties together which are at discord, though the persons doe nothing at al belong vnto vs, but onely that they are men, and also that the matter wherevppon the discorde riseth, doeth nothing touch vs, and that wee in medling to pacifie it, doe put ourselues in danger: for wee come not hither to seeke our own particular profite, but to serue God and our neigh∣bours. Wherfore it may seeme at the first sight that Solomon ought not to haue compared him that passeth by, and medleth with the strife that belongeth not to him, vnto one that taketh a dogge by
the eares. For if it is a good thing to be wished that brethren shoulde dwel together, yea altogether: euen so also ought wee too think him a good man which passing by, seeth a strife, and laboureth Psal. 133. to set peace: and so hee ought to bee esteemed wise and discrete: in steede where hee which taketh a dogge by the eares, is arrogant and rashe, putting himselfe in danger of the dogges teeth, if one of his eares doe slip or escape out of his handes or both of them. Euen so must wee vnderstande that Solomon doeth not rebuke him that in passing by, laboureth to accord them which are at debate, but he that without witting and learning where about they striue, with∣out knowing who hath right or wrong, doeth take part and main∣teine the quarrel of one of the parties against the other: such a pas∣senger is wel worthie of rebuke, when rashly hee putteth himselfe into danger, for one of the parties: or which in passing by raiseth a quarrel of a matter whereof hee hath nothing to doe nor to med∣dle. And thus, not to be like vnto him which taketh a dogge by the eares, let vs content ourselues to meddle with that which be∣longeth vnto our state and vocation. 18 As hee that faineth himselfe mad, casteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things: 19 So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & saith, am not I in sport? God doeth highly commend vnto vs faithfulnesse and loyaltie towardes our neighbours, when hee doeth expressely forbid vs to Leui. 19. 11▪ 12. 13. deceiue and beguile them. But so much it wanteth that we esteeme any such forbidding, that we thinke not a man to be cunning, ex∣cept hee, can make his particular profite by the hurte of another, and most what they that are the greatest deceiuers, and which doe most hurte, and bring greatest losse and dammage, do perswade men to beleeue that they doe nothing but sporte and play, and that they meane no euil. In which doing they are very dangerous: as Solomō doeth declare, when he compateth such deceiuers vnto those which seeme to bee out of their wittes and without strength and yet wil vse great violence, the which can not bee easily holpen. This violence is signified, By the casting of fyrebrandes, arrowes, &c. Now as
wee cannot easily remedie suche violence: euen so also can no man lightly and easily rise vp from them which would haue men to think that what so euer they doe against their neighbours is nothing but sport. And thus suche deceiuers are murderers: for no thanke to them, though those whom they deceiue, doe not perishe. And forasmuch as wee woulde not be counted murderers, let vs be care∣ful to keepe trueth with our neighbours, following that which Saint Paule teacheth vs: Let no man oppresse or defraude his brother, in any matter, otherwise the vengeance of the Lorde is prepared re∣dy 1. The. 4▪ 6. against vs, as against murtherers. And if wee feare the decei∣uers which in sporting bring hurt vnto our good name, to our bo∣dies, and to our temporal goods: by a more strong reason wee must greatly feare the sport of Papistes, whereby they destroy soules. I cal al their doctrine and al their ceremonies, play and sport, because that without faith they teache and doe all their diuine seruice, as they cal it: for if it were not to liue at their ease, they woulde not meddle with it. And truely there are many which in their hearts, doe mocke at their dooing: as wee may knowe it by their wordes vttered at vnawares. 20 Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a tale∣bearer strife ceasseth. When the fire hath taken any part, it is of no continuance, ex∣cept it meete with matter fit for to burne, or that there is somthing ministred vnto it, euen so, when any strife beginneth, it may bee quickly appeased, except some talebearer doe labour to mainteine it. Solomon making such comparison, doeth first of al admonish vs, that wee shouide not cast debates, strifes, the faggots of false reports and slaundering, flatterie, & false witnesse bearing into the fire: for such wood doeth not coole and quench strife, but mainteineth and kindleth it more: as wee haue seene heeretofore vnder other Pro. 18. 8. wordes. Secondly, hee doeth admonishe vs that if wee feare least the fire wil catch our earthly houses, wee must feare muche more to giue entrance of talebearers vnto vs. Thirdly, as we draw the wood back
out of the fire, that it shoulde no longer burne: euen so the office of the Magistrate is to roote out talebearers. And euery one of vs shoulde labour to quenche the fire of strife and debate, chiefly when wee beare our neighbours no good will, or that our neighbours do stirre and prouoke vs vnto anger and strife. And for to doe this, we Iam. 4. 1. must renounce our owne concupiscencs: for from them come de∣bates. 21 As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, so the contentious man is apt to kindle strife. Solomon compareth a riotous and contentious man vnto a cole & wood, the which are good creatures of God, the vse wher∣of is good and necessary, as experience teacheth. It is not to say, that such a man is any thing profitable for all that: but hee woulde giue vs to vnderstand, that as whē a man careth not for warming of him¦selfe nor for fire, hee wil drawe backe the coles and wood: euen so if wee wil bee exempted from strife and dissentions: we must for∣sake the company of the riotous & cōtentious. Such men do kindle dissentions which are of no smal continuance: as Solomon doeth marke it wel, when hee compareth them vnto coles and woode, which make the fire to burne the longer, and not vnto strawe the which is incontinently consumed, & mainteineth not the fire: and so they are very dangerous, and is very expedient to flie and auoide their conuersation. For as when we stand neere vnto the chimney or fire, we waxe warme: euen so when we vse the company of the contentious, wee are stirred vp to bee angry, and to make strifes and debates, the which cannot bee so soone quenched, no more then it is easie to quench a great flame or great fire. Let vs vnder∣stande then that Solomon doeth admonish vs to be soft, gentle, and gratious, that wee shoulde not stirre vp any man vnto strife and dis∣sention against vs: and also he doth admonish vs to seeke the com∣pany of quiet people, & to flie theirs that are cōtentious. For albeit that Solomon doeth not presently compare the contentious vnto chaffe, yet are they chaffe, which shall burne eternally in vnquench∣able fire, as al other wicked shal do.
22 The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly. The worde which wee here expounde, as flatteringes hath bene expounded as wounds, because the word hath diuers significations and not contrary: for there is no repugnancie that the talebearer shoulde flatter him whome hee wil deadly hurt: hee will speake gentle, that no man may beware of him, and till hee haue leasure to hurt at his pleasure: and that not onely hee may doe hurt vntoo his goods, of whome hee speaketh euil, but also that by his false tongue, hee may bring him vtterly vnto destruction, Solomon doth signifie it, saying, That the flattering wordes goe downe into the bowels of the belly. As touching the rest, when hee so often rebuketh the tale carrier, let vs knowe that it is because hee is enclined vnto slaunde∣ring of his neighbour: and the which also is a very abhominable thing: for hee proceedeth therein of malice against his conscience. The talebearer knoweth wel that hee would haue no man to speake so of him. They that are such, are dangerous: but some of them are much more to bee feared then other, when they labour by their tale bearing to turne away the poore weakelings from the true re∣ligion. 23 As siluer drosse ouer laide vpon a potsharde, so are bur∣ning lippes, and an euill hearte. When wee delight to see goodly thinges, if wee haue any ves∣sel of great price, for to make the same faire, wee wil couer it ouer with golde or siluer, according as wee esteeme the peece to be wor∣thie: neither wil we bestowe such cost and glittering shew vppon a thing of nothing, as is a potshearde, euen so when a man doth de∣light in the vprightnesse and goodnesse of his heart, hee wil ouerlay it, after a manner of speache, with pure, cleane, sweete, and louing woordes, hee wil make his hearte to shine by fit and conuenient talke, which shal bring no hurt nor trouble, no molestation nor hin∣derance vnto his neighbours, but rather with his talke he wil labour
to make them glad, and to bring them profit and honour. A good man out of the good treasure of his hearte bringeth good thinges. Mat. 12. 35. Contrarily, when a man delighteth in the frowardnes of his hearte, he wil not ouerlay the same with holy words for to pleasure there∣with his neighbors, to profit them, & to honor them: but with his fiery lippes of euil speaking he wil endeuour to vexe his neighbour and to hurte him so much as he can. Beholde the ouerlaying which is fit for an euill hearte: such had the Scribes and Pharisees, which Mat. 12. coulde not speake wel of Iesus Christ our Lorde. And for this cause also our Lorde rebuketh them sharply, declaring to them, that they had ouerlayed the same, with wickednesse agreeable to their harts, when hee saith to them, Generation of vipers, how can ye speake wel, seeing you yourselues are euil? Let vs therefore vnderstand that Mat. 12. 34. Solomon saying, As siluer drosse, &c. doeth admonishe vs that we shoulde be careful to keepe that our heartes bee not infected with wicked∣nesse and made vnfruiteful as is a potsharde. And for to doe this, let vs arme them with the pure worde of the Lorde, which are pure as siluer that is purified and perfectly fined: let vs learne thereby to abhorre al iniquitie and frowardnesse, that wee may not haue furi∣ous and burning lips that wil vtter hurtful thinges vnto our neigh∣bours, but rather that by our wordes we may procure their benefit and honour, without any thing hindring them. 24 Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit. When they which conceiue any hatred against their neighbors, doe thinke to haue a iust cause to hate them: if they feele thēselues strong ynough for to hurt and to bring damage, they wil not gladly dissemble it, but doe openly assault their enemie: as Saule making himselfe beleeue that Dauid was his enemie, did pursue him with∣out dissimulation. The enemies of the trueth, which thinke to doe seruice vnto God for killing of the disciples of Iesus Christ, doe boldly pronounce without dissimulation, sentence of death against them. Euen so they which are not ashamed to shewe their euil minde, doe nothing at al feare to declare themselues enemies to
them which please them not. These are not they whereof Solomon speaketh, when he saith, He that hateth, &c. But of them which shal knowe in their consciences that they doe wrongfully hate their neighbours, and yet wil not cease their hatred, the which they wil dissemble with sweete woordes, and wil secretly deuise in their heartes sodainely to take them whome they hate, and to hurte them by deceit, that they may not take heede and auoide them. The captaine of such people is Gene. 4. 8. & 37. Caine: The brethren of Ioseph are so in likewise. The traytour Iu∣das doeth wel deserue to bee set in the same order. Likewise the Scribes and Pharisees, and al those which hate the trueth, which knowe and make a faire shewe vnto them, whome they pursue, that they may finde meanes to destroy them. Nowe wee must carefully take heede that wee doe not become like vnto the first haters, who are proude: for then wee shal not onely haue men for our aduersa∣ries, but God also who resisteth the proude. And wee must also take heede from being like vnto them, of whome Solomon nowe spea∣keth: for then shoulde wee bee cruel and hypocrites sinning against our owne consciences and of set malice. Hypocrisie is noted and knowne by the fayning of the lippes: and crueltie is discerned by the dissimulation which lyeth hidde within: and the malice prepen∣sed in them both: to wit, in the dissembling of their lippes, and in the couering of the disceit. But wee may take heede of them both, so that wee suffer not ourselues to bee ouercome by the sweete wordes of such as hate vs, and that wee giue credite vnto the ad∣monition folowing. 25 Though he speake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are seuen abhominations in his heart. The wordes of the hateful may seeme sweete and amiable: but let vs not beleue them: for whiles he speaketh so gently, hee in uen∣teth abhominable things in his heart, not only one or two, but ma∣ny: as Solomon noteth by the number of seuen. Neuerthelesse wee Prou. 6. 16. may say that Solomon meaneth heere, that the hateful are giuē vnto sixe things that God hateth, yea to the seuēth, which he abhorreth. For they which hate their neighbours inuent and seeke out all wic∣ked
and abhominable wayes, yea cruel meanes by the which they may destroy them, whome they hate. Nowe if we ought to beware of such haters, as bring harme to our goods, bodyes or good name: by a stronger reason, wee must carefully flye from them which hate our saluation, which are enemies of the crosse of our Lorde Iesus Christ (without the which we haue neither saluation nor life) and so consequently are our enemies: as also Saint Paule doeth wel sig∣nifie Acts. 20. 29. Rom. 16. 17. 18 it calling them greeuous wolues which will not spare the flock, and yet notwithstāding wil speake fauourably for to draw disciples after them, but we must not beleeue them. We must beleeue them Phi. 3. 17. 18 which folowe S. Paule, as hee exhorteth vs to be followers of him. 26 Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof shall bee discouered in the congregati∣on. Solomon following that which he hath saide in the twoo for∣mer sentences, doeth shewe nowe againe what the hatefull seeke, when hee laboureth to dissemble and to hide his hatred, by the dis∣sembling of his lippes, and by the fauourablenes and sweetnes of his voice, that is to say, that he seeketh to deceiue him whom he ha∣teth, to take him, to hinder and to hurt him, before he can know it, til after he is caught and had by the backe, and cannot escape. Loe, what the hateful seeketh when he hideth his hatred. But he decei∣ueth himselfe: for nothing is so hid, but at one time or other it com∣meth Mat. 10. 26. to light. And therefore let the hateful dissemble and hide his hatred so long as he wil, saying he intendeth no euill against his neighbour or such like wordes for to disguise himselfe and to coun∣terfeit, and to deceiue his neighbour, his hatred shall not remaine couered, but his malice (as saith Solomon) shalbe discouered in the congregation. He thinketh to hide his hypocrisie, malice and cruel∣tie, from twoo or three: but God will discouer and defame him be¦fore many. Though it is not heere in this present life, yet shal it be in the congregation of his Angels, and of his elect. Let vs vnderstande that Solomon by this sentence doeth admonishe vs, that wee shoulde bee gentle, softe, and louing,
and that wee shoulde walke vprightly and in the integritie of our heart one towardes another, without dissembling. Thus doing, wee shal not bee diffamed in this worlde before the congregation of the Lorde, nor at the last day before his Angels and elect. Likewise hee doeth admonishe vs that wee shoulde not bee ouermuch pensiue, though through the hatred and malice of the wicked, our righteous∣nes or innocencie be not made manifest and reuealed: for it shal come to light the time that God hath appointed, and as sayth Saint Paul, Some mens sinnes are opened before hand, & come to iudge∣ment, other some do follow after. 1. Tim. 5. 24. 25. 27 Hee that diggeth a pitt, shall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a stone, it shal returne vnto him. The holy Scripture so vseth by similitudes, for to shewe the wic∣ked, that the wicked enterprises they take in hand, against their neighbours for to destroy them, are not only vnprofitable, but also hurtefull, and noysome. And amongest others, it setteth foorth the similitude of them which hunt the great and wilde beastes, or such Psal. 7. 16. & 9. 16. & 57. 7. Iere. 18. 20. beastes as are hurtfull: as Lyons, Beares, Wolues, and Foxes. These hunters make pitfalles, and couer them ouer with greene turues, that the beastes may not perceiue them, and that in running ouer them, they may fall and tumble vnto the bottome: and sometimes forgetting the place where they lye, and running after the beastes to make them fall in, they themselues often times tumble in headlong. Solomon doeth now vse the like similitude saying, He that diggeth a pit shall fall therein. Whereby he shew∣eth that so farre it is off, that the wicked profite by their wicked en∣terprises, that rather thereby they seeke their destruction, and finde it ere they know it. And for to expresse this same yet further, and to shewe that albeit the wicked are strong and lustie, yet they shall not auoyde the euill they thinke to doe vnto other, but it shall come to them and ouerthrowe them. He addeth another similitude, the which is takē of a man that stādeth at the foot of an hil, & with his arm casteth vp a stone, & not taking heed of the same which falleth faster & more swiftly thē it moūted & went vpward, stādeth stil not
caring for it, and is sodainely ouerthrowne of the stone. Wherein the faythful are admonished not to feare the deuises and enter∣prises of the wicked: but seing them vexed with them, let them pa∣tiently looke for the issue which it shal please God to sende: and the euil shal not destroy them, but themselues that woorke it. Pha∣rao did inuent much euil against the children of Israel: Saule against Dauid: Iudas against Iesus Christ: but the ende hath shewed the trueth of this present sentence. And though wee shoulde not see the experience thereof in this worlde, yet shal the last day shewe it, that the wicked haue sought their owne destruction, in going a∣bout to destroy others. And if they which inuent but our tempo∣ral destruction shal receiue their rewarde, worthy of their paine and labour, by a stronger reason must they, (which seeke to intrappe mens consciences, to destroy their soules, to looke for a grieuous and feareful punishement, as the Pope and his bande. 28 A false tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth causeth contention. The worlde is not satisfied to see the affliction of the miserable, after the outwarde apparance, but laboureth to adde affliction vp∣pon affliction: as the wife of Putipher Iosephs maister in Egypt was not contented that Ioseph shoulde bee a poore slaue, but for Gene. 39. Exo. 1. 33. to afflict him further, she vsed a false and lying tongue against him. Pharao also was not contented that the people of God were sub∣iect vnto him, but made wicked lawes for to oppresse them and make them more miserable. The neighbours of the children of Is∣rael, as the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, and Ismaelites, labou∣red more and more to kindle rage and fury against them. The Baby∣lonians procured lawes and proclamations to be made to afflict the poore Iewes the more, that they helde in captiuitie: and as it is saide, when we wil kil a dogge, wee wil say and lay to his charge, hee is madde. In al times this hath bene seene prooued, after the which Solomon speaketh, when he saith, A false tongue hateth the afflicted. Wherein wee haue to note that that which Solomon calleth a false tongue, he afterwards calleth a flattering mouth, because that the custome of lyers for
more better to deceiue and to hurte, is to flatter, that they may more easily execute that which they haue conceiued through ha∣tred. And to the flattering mouth hee attributeth contention, which is the frute proceeding from hatred: for hee that hateth, desireth nothing but to raise vp contentions against them whome hee ha∣teth, that hee may ouerthrowe and destroy them. Nowe forasmuch as wee woulde not bee counted neither lyers, nor flatterers, let vs take heede to folowe what soeuer tendeth and belongeth to peace, concorde and loue towardes our neighbours, and chiefly towardes such as are most miserable and full of calamitie, most despysed and weake, which haue no power to bee reuenged. Otherwise, wee shoulde despyse this present sentence, the which is not written, to the ende that wee shoulde onely knowe what the lyers and flat∣terers thinke and doe, but also that wee shoulde abhorre their affections and woorkes, and also shoulde take heede and beware of them. The xxvii. Chapter. 1 BOast not thy selfe of to morrowe: for thou knowest not what a day may bring foorth. WOrldlinges which neither haue nor wil haue any knowledge of the pro∣uidence of GOD, and can not be∣leeue that al things come to passe ac∣cording as the Lorde hath ordeined Gene. 11. 3. & 27. 41. & 37. 27. Exo. 1. 8. & 14. 3. 1. Sam. 26. 2. 2. Sam. 15. 1. Kings. 12. 2. Kings. 18. in his eternal counsel, which cannot change, but doe attribute one parte vnto fortune and chaunce: and ano∣ther parte vnto their wisedome and worldly and sensual counsel, are full of arrogancie and boasting of concupiscences and disordinate affe∣ctions, after the which they promise themselues great things in time to come: but most often they are deceiued of their minde & hope.
Solomon woulde not not haue vs to bee like vnto such worldlings, when he saith, Dan. 4. Luke. 12. 16. Iames. 4. 13. Boast not thy selfe of to morowe. For besides their arrogancy, as we may see by the scriptures, they guide themselues by chaunce, not referring & committing themselues vnto the wil of God. Chaunce is marked, when Solomon saith, For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. When he thus speaketh, he doeth not rebuke vs of ignorance, though we know not what shalbe done to morowe: for God onely hath things to come in his presence: and would that we should tarie patiently and looke for that which it shal please him to sende, and that we shoulde be certified that al thinges come to passe according to his good wil: for the which the foresaide worldlings looke not after: and therfore they are wel worthy to be rebuked of ignorance, the which is not imputed vnto the faythful, which waite vpon the prouidence of God. For albeit that particularly, they know not the things that are to come: yet neuerthelesse they knowe and are certified that nothing can come to passe, but what God wil haue, and that hee hath ordeined from eternitie. This ignorance is hum∣blenesse before God, who doth not count it for ignorance: but whē we doe so cast ourselues downe, wee are receiued and accepted for wel learned and knowing much. Notwithstanding, though wee doe not knowe, what thing the day shal bring foorth, yet hee doth not meane that we should do nothing, whereof wee might make our profite on the morowe: otherwise wee shoulde tempt God, who would haue vs to labour, that afterwardes we might eate the fruite of our labour. Hauing regard to this wil of God, if we labour faith∣fully to gather riches, without ouer greedie desire, not minding to enriche ourselues, and without desire to hurt our neighbours, wee care nothing for to morow, but do folow the meanes, by the which God wil giue vs our dayly bread. Furthetmore let vs note, that our free wil is very smal, yea of no force, when we neither ought to wil, nor can ordeine of things done to morowe. And if the worldly & temporal matters which are of no great importance & waight, are not in our power, much lesse shal we haue power ouer the heauēly and eternal. Let vs also note that Solomon doeth heere compare the day vnto a woman with childe, of whome no man can certainly say whether she shal bring foorth a sonne or a daughter: and as wee
cannot tel the same, euen so is it too much curiositie to enquyre thereof. Let vs therefore vnderstande that by this similitude Solo∣mon doeth admonish vs that we shoulde not be curious. 2 Let another man prayse thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a stranger, and not thine owne lippes. The worldlings and carnal men which care nothing of glorify∣ing God in al things, and who for al thinges doe not acknowledge him to bee the onely author of al thinges, doe greatly praise them∣selues, and are so puft vp in their hearts, that the mouth must speake, and sounde out the praises of such boasters: in such wise that some wil bragge of the nobilitie of their parentage: other some, of their wisedome and cunning: othersome, of their power, credite, and authoritie: and other some againe of their beautie and riches: and the most foolishe boasters of al, wil brag of their merites. In the number of such boasters, wee may reckon Absolon, Roboam, Na∣buchadnezar, 2. Sam. 15. 2 1. King. 12. 10 Dan. 4. z7. Luke. 12. 16. & 18. 11. the riche glutton, the proude Pharisee. The ende of such people is shameful and ful of confusion: and therefore Solo∣mon, which desireth our honour, woulde not haue vs to bragge of ourselues but if there bee any thing in vs worthy of praise, that wee shoulde holde our peace, and let others speake, saying, Let ano∣ther man praise thee, and not thyne owne mouth. And forasmuch as it is very harde for vs to forsake boasting, and that our tongue doeth ake with the great desire that wee haue to praise ourselues, Solomon therefore addeth the same forbidding againe, saying, Let it bee a stranger, and not thy lippes. And let vs note, that hee saieth not, let thy brother, or thy cousine praise thee, but a stranger. For if the brother praise the brother, or the cousin his cousin, this is as if a man shoulde praise himselfe: but if a stranger doeth praise vs, it is an argument and probation that we walke so vertuously, that they which are not acquainted with vs, are constrained to praise vs. Notwithstanding, this is not to say, that it is laweful for vs to doe any thing for to bee praised: but in al our conuersation, wee must seeke the honour and glory of God, & the edification of our neigh∣bours. Thus dooing, God without our desire, wil raise vp men which shal praise vs, according as shalbe expedient: as wee may see
by the holy histories, wherein hee hath gathered by wryting the deedes and actes worthy of prayse of our olde Fathers, that wee shoulde praise them and folow their vertues: and also hath brought to light the actes of the wicked, that wee abhorring them, might feare to doe the like. 3 A stone is heauie, and the sand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both. Wee naturally doe desire to bee exempted from offices, paine, labour, and trauaile, and to liue doing nothing, except a very little thing, for to seeme that wee woulde not bee ydle. And yet for to be at ease, and to liue delicately, wee seeke the acquaintance, and fami∣liaritie of the Lords of the earth, who for the greatest parte, are so voide of wisedome, and of modest affection, and of humble mind, that for a thing of nothing and without cause they wil become an∣gry, and wil storme against them that are about them, and wil great∣ly reuile them, and furiously oppresse them: so that it were better for them to helpe a mason or bricklayer, for to carry stones & mor∣ter, then to dwel with such fooles, with whom a man knoweth not howe to bee, except hee can abyde iniuries & wrongs, oppressions, & violences, euen to be weary of his life, when a man seeth that he cannot tel howe to auoide their furie, and that they rather looke for death, then for life. Albeit that the childrē of Israel being in Egypt, sought not to liue ydlely without doing any thing, yet it had beene more expediēt for thē to haue suffred more paine thē they did, then so to haue felt the wrath of the king which caused their sōnes to be slaine. Dauid also did not seeke to liue ydlely: but it had bene more necessarie for him in mans iudgement, to haue liued a priuate and a baselife, then to bee the sonne in lawe of Saule, who was a wic∣ked and cruel foole, and persecuted Dauid, in such wise, that hee knewe not where to hyde himselfe, but amongst the infidels. Ac∣cording to this experience Solomon saith nowe, A stone is heauy, &c. Wherein hee doeth admonish vs, not to bee delicate, but to folowe our vocation, though it be very harde. Let vs also learne,
that it is farre better to beare the yoake of Iesus Christ, which see∣meth troublesome and harde to the flesh, then to submitte a mans selfe and enclyne vnto the traditions and doctrines of men. For al∣beeit that at the first approche it seemeth that they are Angelles which teache them: yet doe they proceede with greate furie: first of all against them that wil not yeelde and obay: secondly they destroy for euer their soules which suffer themselues to be deceiued by thē. And further let vs note, that hee saieth not simply and absolutely, wrath, but the wrath of a foole: for it is profitable for vs that the wise become angry with vs, when we faile & erre, seeing they seeke not our destruction, but our profit, the which wee shal feele, if wee doe not rebel against them. And contrarily, the foole by his wrath seeketh nothing but destruction, for the which to auoide wee must take diligent heede from consenting vnto his folly: for thinking to eschue a temporal destruction, wee shal fal into an eternal damnati∣on: from the which the fooles shal not be exempted, for they waxe angry without cause, the which is equal to murther. 4 Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can stand before enuie? An angry man is cruel: as we may see by Caine, Esaw, and the brethren of Ioseph. And a man that is furious, is like vnto a flood of Gene. 4. & 27. & 37. Exo. 14. 1. Sam. 18. 2. Sam. 15. 1. Kings. 12. water that descendeth with raging: as wee may see in Pharao, Ab∣solon, and Roboam. Nowe that which is seene by experience, Solo∣mon doth pronounce, when he saith, Anger is cruel. &c. Wherein he doth aduertise that the companie of the wrathful & furious mā is very hurtful and dangerous, and for this cause that we should not desire the same, but should rather shunne and auoide it. And foras∣much as we desire not that any man should fly our company, as frō cruel and wrathful, furious and vnmerciful men, and also that wee would not haue our neighbours to be such towards vs, let vs vnder∣stand that Solomon doeth admonish vs to put from vs al bitternes, anger, wrath, and roaring, as doeth S. Paule. The angry and wrath∣ful Eph. 4. 31. 32. Col. 3. 8. are very dangerous, but the enuious are far more cruel: as Solo∣mon doeth pronounce, when he saith,
But who shal stande before enuie? For besides crueltie and ra∣ging, the which wee may correct in the angry and wrathful, the en∣uious is ambitious and arrogant, a dissembler, purposing malice, obstinate and harde of heart against his conscience, so that they are altogither without reconciliation: as wee may see in the Scribes and Pharisees against Iesus Christ our Lorde. Thus we are aduerti∣sed to take diligent heed of the enuious, and also that we ourselues fal not too it: folowing the admonition of S. Peter. 2. Pet. 2. 1. 5 Open rebuke is better then secrete loue. Loue is little woorth and serueth them to no purpose whome we thinke wee loue, or that wee woulde perswade ourselues wee loue, except that wee declare the same by good deedes towardes them, in helping their necessitie. And therefore S. Iohn doeth admo∣nish Iames. 2. 14. 1. Ioh. 3. 17. 18. vs to helpe the necessitie of our brethren. It were better for vs to be openly rebuked, then so to bee loued: as Solomon doeth pro∣nounce it, saying, Open rebuke or correction, &c. For if wee doe openly rebuke our neighbours, if they are easie to bee taught and tractable, they wil be ashamed, and wil be ware of returning to the like faute, and wil returne vnto God by true repentance: as did Dauid, after that the Prophet Nathan had rebuked him. That rebuke was much more profitable for him, then the secrete loue of Nabal: who sought to do 2. Sam. 12. 1. Sam. 25. Dauid no hurt, but yet he woulde not helpe his necessitie. As there are many such which wil perswade themselues that they loue their neighbours ynough, when they doe them no wrong nor violence, though they haue no minde at al to doe them any good. Such kinde of loue is so secrete, that it is nothing, but rather hatred: for where there is no loue, there is hatred: seeing there is no meane way be∣tweene both. Moreouer, wee are admonished rather to reprooue and correct, then to dissemble the fautes of our neighbours: and also we are admonished that we shoulde not desire to be flattered, but to be sharply corrected and rebuked.
6 The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kisses of an enemie are harde. Wee cal a tree a true and faithful sister, when it faileth not to bring foorth her frute in due season: euen so wee cal riuers true or faythful sisters, when they faint not, but doe alwayes runne abun∣dantly. After this sense Solomon doeth cal the woundes of a louer which chasteneth, when he saith, the woundes of a louer, &c. For albeit that after mens carnal reason, we take not the chastizementes and corrections in good parte, yet are they fruiteful. And thus, Solo∣mon doeth admonish vs that wee shoulde count the chastizements of the wise and iust, profitable and fruiteful: seeing they loue vs, and that they labour to make vs that wee shoulde take our profite, not onely temporal, but also spirituall and eternall. For they seeke to make vs exercised and profite in the feare of the Lorde God, whereby wee are turned from euill, to followe righteousnesse and holinesse, and consequently come to the accomplishement and perfection of this profite, which is the pos∣session of the euerlasting blessednesse. The woundes therefore of such people are very faythful, and so must we receiue them in good Psal. 141. 5. parte, with patience and with ioy, and say with Dauid, let the righ∣teous smyte mee, for that is a benefite: and let him reprooue me, and it shalbe a precious oyle, that shal not breake myne head, &c. And if wee must thus behaue ourselues towardes men which of loue that they beare vs, doe chasten vs: it is therefore good reason that wee shoulde take in woorth, when the Lorde which loueth vs Heb. 12. 5. with an incomprehensible loue, doeth correct and chasten vs: euen as the Apostle dothadmonish vs: my sonne despise not the chastize∣ment of the Lorde, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him: for the Lorde correcteth euery sonne that he loueth, &c. Nowe as wee must patiently suffer their chastening that loueth vs: euen so contrarilie, wee must fly and abhorre the flatteries of them which hate vs: as Solomon doth admonish vs, saying, and the kisses, &c. Albeit that such kisses after the outwarde apparance are pleasant, as the worde which we haue expounded harde may import: yet when they are ful of treasons and murthers, the which are things much
abhominable, then are they truly very harde: as amongst other the kisse of Iudas the traytour. 7 The person that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry soule euery bitter thing is sweete. It is lawful for vs to eate and to drinke, of such things as GOD hath created for our vse, and also it is as lawful for vs to abstaine frō them: as we may in some sort gather of S. Paule. I say in some sort: for the intent of S. Paule, was not to handle, whither it were lawe∣ful Rom. 14. 3. 6 Phi. 4. 11. 12 for vs either to eate, or to abstaine: but knowing that their vse is free and lawful for vs both to take and to leaue, we should be careful to keepe ourselues that we fal not into one of these two extremi∣ties: the one whereof is properly vitious & damnable, the other is dangerous and hurtful. The vicious extremitie is marked by Solo∣mon, when he saith, The person that is ful, treadeth vnder feete, &c. Wherein he doeth shewe vs that wee ought not to desire su∣perfluitie and excesse in eating and drinking, but that wee shoulde fly and auoide al gluttony and drunkennesse, and al intemperancie. For besides that al the person is made heauie and ill disposed, men come to despyse and marre the good creatures of God, which is a great vnthankefulnesse. Solomon doeth note the contempt & spoi∣ling, by treading vnder feete the honny combes. We may also say that Solomon meaneth that the person which hath abundance of riches, and doeth not confesse that God doeth giue them to him, for to vse soberly and temperately, careth not though the better parte be lost: as are they which neuer haue their tables furnished y∣nough to their minde and desire, at the which they entertaine a sort of ydle bellies. There are the combes of hony troden vnder feete, there is much good meatelost, that would serue wel to fil the hun∣gry soule. And thus let vs vnderstande that Solomon doeth exhorte vs vnto sobrietie and temperancie, howe riche soeuer wee bee, and woulde haue vs to confesse that they come from the goodnesse and liberalitie of the Lorde, that wee shoulde feare to make any spoyle, or to haue them in contempt. But as touching the dangerous ex∣tremitie, it standeth in the abstinence of meates and drinkes, when
any man careth not to nourishe and to sustaine himselfe, but doeth famish and hungerstarue himselfe, so that with the greate greedi∣nesse that hee hath to eate, he careth not what he taketh and eateth, but deuoureth the first meate that he meeteth and commeth to, be it good or bad, sweete or bitter. Solomon noteth this extremitie, saying, But vnto the hungry soule euery bitter thing is sweete. The which I cal dangerous, because that the person which so ruleth himselfe, runneth in danger to poyson himselfe. Neuerthelesse wee may say that Solomon meaneth that they which are poore, and stay to eate til they haue a stomake, haue no neede of sause, for to dyne withal, and that the meate which the gluttons doe abhorre, as if they were bitter, are to them sweete and pleasant. Nowe as they that are ful, despise good meate, euen so the worldly wise which are puft vp with their knowledge, doe nothing regarde and esteeme the good meate of our soules, which is the worde of God, the which to the faithful is sweeter then hony. Contrarily, as the hungry take Psal. 19. 11. them to al kinde of meates that they meete with, and are in dan∣ger to be poysoned: euen so the ignorant doe consent as soone vnto a false doctrine as vnto a good and true: and so their minds and vn∣derstandings are easily poysoned. They also which are delighted in the pleasures and voluptuousnesse of this world, and do enioy thē, do nothing esteeme heauenly things. They which challenge righte∣ousnesse by their workes, and thinke themselues riche by the righ∣teousnesse of them, are not earnest, neither do hunger that GOD should graunt them grace, or shoulde shewe his goodnes to them: but they which hunger and thirst for righteousnesse, doe finde the yoake of Iesus Christ sweete, and his burthen light, and doe manly and couragiously beare the crosse, yea death. 8 As a byrd that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his owne place. The nature of the byrd is to be careful of his nest, that hee may nourish, mainteine, bring vp, and keepe his littleones. Notwithstan∣ding yet wil he sodainely fly from his nest, & forsake his little byrds, And this shalbe sometimes for to goe seeke foode for herselfe, and for his youngones: and so this commeth of the care that hee hath
to feede them wel: sometimes forasmuch as he hath perceiued som∣thing wherewithal hee hath beene feared: and so he wandereth and flyeth farre off, for to saue his life, and forgetteth some of his little ones. Such is the nature and kinde of doing of little byrds, as wee may see it by experience. And the holy scripture maketh menti∣on of it, not to the ende that wee shoulde knowe it: but the scrip∣ture speaketh of byrdes, comparing vnconstant men vnto them, which easily are afearde, forsake their office, and forget their due∣tie. And thus by this comparison the scripture doeth rebuke the fearefulnesse, the weakenesse and inconstancie of men: as heere, when Solomon saith, As a byrde that wandereth, &c. True it is that as the byrd doeth flye farre from his nest for to seeke foode and meate, euen so, when the Sunne is vp, man must goe forth vnto his worke and to his labour, til it is night: but hee shoulde not goe farre from his place. For hee that doeth his office and duetie, wheresoeuer hee go∣eth, hee doeth not wander farre from his place, but keepeth resi∣dence there as hee ought. And also when the scripture compa∣reth man vnto the byrde that flyeth her way, most commonly it serueth for to rebuke him, as in this present sentence, or for to threaten to take his rest from him. Nowe that wee may not bee taxed of inconstancie, of fearefulnesse, or of weakenesse, let vs take heede to bee careful to holde fast our place, in walking dili∣gently and faithfully in the state wherein God hath placed vs: and let vs for any feare that can bee, made vs, saye with Dauid: In the Lorde haue I put my trust, howe then say yee vnto my soule, Psalm. 11. 1 fly away to your mountaine as a byrde? For if in holding our place wee walke in the feare of the Lorde, and doe aske in a sure trust with Dauid, keepe mee as the apple of thyne eye, &c. againe, Psalm. 17. 8 & 57. 2. Psal. 91. Haue mercie vppon mee, O GOD, haue mercie vppon mee: for my soule trusteth in thee, &c. hee wil not fayle to assist vs, and to keepe and saue vs, as hee promiseth. For hee is not like vnto the byrde which wandereth farre from his nest, and forgetteth his Dau. 33. 11. Exo. 14. 4. Mat. 23. 27. young: but hee is lyke vntoo the Egle which stirreth vp her nest, flootereth ouer her birds, stretcheth out her wings taketh thē, and beareth them on her winges. Hee is also like vnto the henne
which gathereth her chickens vnder her winges. Wherefore con∣fessing that of ourselues and of our owne nature wee are weake, vnconstant, and fearefull as little byrdes, let vs runne vnder the winges of this henne, trusting in the fatherly care of our father, and wondering at his goodnesse which hee sheweth to them which trust in him, saying, How excellent is thy mercy, O God! therefore the children of men trust vnder the shadowe of thy winges. I wil Psal. 36. 7. & 61. 4. dwel in thy Tabernacle for euer, and my trust shalbe vnder the co∣uerings of thy winges. 9 As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: so doeth the sweetnesse of a mans friend by heartie counsel. When the body is at his ease and in health, the hearte is merry and glad: as we feele it by experience. And therefore after this expe∣rience, Solomon saith, that the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart. Not that hee wil teache vs that for to possesse our delightes and sensual pleasures wee shoulde apply oyntmentes and perfumes vnto our bodies for such delightes, because they are too curiously desired, and vsed excessiuely, are not acceptable vnto God, albeit he hath created al things for the vse of man, to whome it is laweful to vse al good creatures, soberly and tēperately, with giuing of thanks. But Solomon speaketh of oyntment and perfume, by comparison, and woulde, that if we reioyced in such things, and that we founde them sweete, wee should also reioyce at the vnfained sweete coun∣sel that the neighbour giueth: for by such sweetenesse the soule of man is brought in good health: as Solomon doeth pronounce, say∣ing, So doeth the sweetenesse of a mans friende by harty coun∣sell. When wee see that our neighbour loueth vs, and that he de∣sireth nothing but to procure our wealth and our saluation, and to cause vs to attaine theretoo, he doeth teache, admonishe, exhort, reprooue, correct, rebuke and threaten, according as hee seeth to bee expedient and necessary for vs: so farre is it of that wee shoulde stomacke or despyte him, that rather conside∣ring the gentlenesse and good affection that hee beareth to vs,
wee should receiue his counsel pleasantly and acceptably, though in outwarde apparance it bee sharpe and sowre: as Dauid did the re∣prehensions of Nathan the Prophet: and the Apostle Saint Peter of the rebuke that Saint Paule gaue him. Otherwise the good and sweete fauour of Christe, which is brought vnto vs by his mi∣nisters, 2. Cor. 2. 14. 15. 16. shoulde bee sauour death vnto death, and shoulde goe vn∣to perdition. 10 Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forsake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers house in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off. We are so vnconstant of nature, that weecannot holde that which is profitable, and that which is familiar vnto vs, & as it were common by custome, but wee desire newe thinges, and therefore we labour to make alterations, the which are not alwaies profitable, but oftentimes bring great hurt, wherby we haue troubles & most heauie sorowes: in such sort that we know not on which side to turne vs, insomuch that weedare not resort vnto our owne carnall brethren: for wee haue experience that the riche brethren doe not care for their poore brethren, nor woulde gladly to see them, and al∣so Pro. 19. 7. Pro. 18. 24. doe hate them. Wherefore, when we haue proued and tried our freendes, wee ought not to change, but to holde them stil: as Solo∣mon hath alreadie admonished vs. And nowe hee doeth the like, when he saith, Forsake not thou thine owne freende, &c. And heerein, hee teacheth vs, that if wee haue good neighbours, who haue alwayes shewed signes and tokens of loue, and haue beene fauourable and helpeful vnto our house, that wee shoulde in no wise separate our¦selues and loose such neighbours: for in time of necessitie suche neighbours wil bee more ready to helpe vs, then our owne carnall brother: and oftentimes we loose both time, labour and our hope to resort vnto such brethren. Solomon doth signifie asmuch, saying, Neither enter thou into thy brothers house in the day of thy ca∣lamitie. Hee meaneth not that it is yll doone of vs to resorte vnto our brother to haue succour of him in aduersitie: but he sig∣nifieth
that most often wee gaine nothing in beseeching him. As Ioseph in mans iudgement got nothing in beseeching his brethren: they tooke no compassion or pitie on him, but sold him for a poore slaue. And so it is far better to haue good neighbors neere vnto vs, and willing to helpe vs, then brethren that care nothing for vs, and are farre from vs. Let vs therefore vnderstande, that neighbours are admonished to mainteine peace, concorde and loue amongest themselues, and to helpe one another: and brethren are rebuked for their crueltie, when they refuse and deny brotherly duetie. For albeit that they kil not their poore brethren, as Cain slue Abel: yet are they the brethren of Cain, and are murtherers, when in not helping their brethren, they declare their hatred which answereth to murder. 11 My sonne, be wise, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may answere him that reprocheth mee. Bee it that Solomon speaketh heere in the person of God, or of the ministers of the worde, or of fathers and mothers, or other su∣perintendents, let vs knowe that when hee asketh of vs that wee shoulde giue ourselues vnto wisedome, and that in so doing, wee shoulde inwardly reioyce him, hee admonisheth vs carefully to fre∣quent the woorde, and that thereby wee shoulde learne to amende our liues, forsaking al infidelitie and incredulitie, al superstition and idolatries, al malice and iniquitie, al offences, insolences and dissolu∣tions: and that wee shoulde conuert by true faith, and by true re∣pentance to trust vpon the goodnesse of our God, to loue the good that hee commandeth, and to giue ourselues to doe it. For wee cannot otherwise reioyce our good God and father, then in turning to him, and obeying with a free minde his worde: as hee hath well shewed, when he repented to haue made man, and that Noe found Gen. 6. & 19 fauour in his sight: and when hee ouerthrewe Sodome, and deli∣uered Lot: When hee raised vp Moses, and diuers Prophetes, to in∣struct the people in al wisedome and prudence, and to make them turne vnto his God: and when he saith expresly, Returne you ther∣fore, Eze. 18. 30. & 33. 11. 18 and repent you of al your transgressions, and wickednesse
shal not destroy you, &c. As sure as I liue saith the Lorde, I desire not the death of a sinner: but that hee shoulde conuert and liue. Deut 30. 8. Iere. 32. 38. Thou shalt returne and obey the voice of the Lorde, &c. And they shalbee my people, and I wil bee their God, &c. What thinke yee? If a man haue an hundred sheepe, and that hee hath lost one, doeth Mat. 18. 12. hee not leaue nientie and nine in the mountaines, & goeth to seeke the same that went astray? It is the wil also of your heanenly father, that not one of the least shal perishe. What man among you, who Luke. 15. 4 hauing an hundred sheepe, if hee hath lost one, doeth hee not leaue nientie and nine in the wildernes, & goeth his way after that which which is lost? &c. Euen so I tel you, there shalbee ioy in heauen for one sinner that repenteth, &c. Heerein, all they which haue charge, ought to learne whereat they shoulde reioyce: to wit, for the con∣uersion of them that haue gone astray, and of their perseuerance in goodnesse, that they haue learned by the worde: as S. Paul doeth Phi. 2. 14 shewe it to the Philippians. And thus, the Papistes doe not execute their charge with such ioy as they ought to doe: for they reioyce at the profite of the purse that they receiue, and not for the edifica∣tion and saluation of the people. Now albeit that the poore faithfull which are the children of God, and of wisedome, doe giue thēselues vnto wisedome, and labour to please God, and their gouernours by holy life: yet the wicked ceasse not to trouble them, to doe them in∣iury, to reuile them, and to slaunder them: as in al times the true & faithful seruantes of God haue beene subiect thereto: but they ought not care for it: for our good God and father taketh these re∣proches as done against himselfe, & knoweth wel how to resist thē, if wee perseuer in wisedome: as Solomon doeth signifie when hee addeth, that I may answere him that reprocheth mee. Answering, heere is taken for resisting, and to confounde, and to reuenge, as also in our language we vse it in this signification. Now as God thinketh him to bee prouided of answere and defence against our oppressors and slaunderers, if we apply ourselues vnto wisedome: euen so, so much as in vs lyeth, we make God to be dumbe, & make him asha∣med, when wee giue ourselues vnto vanitie, foolishnesse, and wic∣kednesse: and likewise those which haue charge ouer vs: as Saint Paule complaineth of the Galathians. Gala. 4. 20.
12 A prudent man seeth the plague, and hideth himselfe: but the foolish goe on still, and receiue hurt. Albeit that Solomon hath pronounced this present sentence Pro. 22. 3. worde for worde before, and that it hath beene largely hande∣led, yet forasmuche as Solomon hath not thought the repetition thereof superfluous, wee ought not to thinke it vnprofitable, if wee handle it heere againe. And therefore, let vs note that this present life is replenished with miseries and calamities, with hurtes & dan∣gers, and that wee are heere as it were in an high way, which is, oc∣cupied with theeues and robbers, which wait for to cut the passen∣gers thotes, and to spoyle them. And first of all, there are subtil and malicious diuels, which demand nothing els but to kil vs: and ther∣fore to auoide their clawes and griping, wee must bee very wise: as wee are admonished: and to arme vs wel, as Saint Paul doth teach 1. Pet. 5. 8. 9. Ephe. 6. 10. vs. Thus doing wee shal not be counted of the number of the sim∣ple and rude, which are indamaged, not taking heede of the diuels craftinesse, but by such meanes wee shal hyde ourselues vnder the protection of our God, who wil preserue and saue vs from hurt. Psal. 91. Secondly, there is the worlde of the wicked, who haue alwaies exercised, and doe dayly stil exercise great tyranny against the poore seruants of God, and that after diuers sortes: for some seeke riches for to become riche, and therefore doe violence to the body for to winne and to get them: and other (which are yet worse) by false do∣ctrines and traditions of men, not onely deuoure the houses of the poore simple, but also destroy both their bodies and soules, sending them to the fire of hel. Against the which we must resist, not with worldly and carnal pollicie to doe them violence: but seeing they are instruments of the Diuel, wee must fight against them with the 1. Iohn. 5. 4. 5 Luke. 21. 19. Rom. 7 Gala. 5. selfe same wisedome that wee doe against the Diuels: and as we are admonished, wee must possesse our soules with patience. Thirdly, wee haue our owne fleshe which watcheth and spieth vs, and doth vs great violence and oppression: as Saint Paule complaineth there∣of, If wee withstande not our flesh, we are but simple and foolishe which receiue hurt, as we wel deserue. For the more we obey to our fleshe, and the lustes thereof, the more are wee made the enimies Iam. 1. 13. 1. Cor. 14. 20. of GOD, by whome onely wee liue and die. Therefore if wee wil
surely hide vs from the plague, and receiue no hurt, obeying the ad∣monition of Saint Paule, for we must not thinke that Solomon would aduertise vs to be wise after the worldly sort. 13 Take his garment that is suertie for a straunger, and a pledge of him for the straunger. This present sentence is conteyned in the. 20. chapter and. 16. verse. 14 A curse shalbe imputed vnto him that prayseth his freende with a loud voyce, rising vp early in the mor¦ning. Because that the slouthfull and negligent lye snorting in their beddes, and are not diligent to rise early in the morning, when wee wil signifie any thing to be done, or that it shalbe done with great care and diligence, or hastily and without tarriance, we attribute vn∣to him early rising: for they that haue care, & wil hasten to dispatch some work, do not as the slouthful do, but hauing taken their reaso∣nable rest and sleepe, doe rise earely and betimes in the morning. And also the Scripture signifiyng some thing that is done with dili∣gence and with speede, sayth that he rose earely in the morning to doe it. And thus when Solomon sayth: A curse shalbe &c: Let vs vnderstand that he woulde not that we shoulde be readie and hastie to publish and proclaime the Gen. 49. 27 Psal. 5. 4. & 46. 6. & 143▪ 8. prayses of men, how great freendes soeuer they bee: otherwise wee should giue occasiō to other to think vs to be hypocrites, & that by faire words and flatteries, we should seek to enter into their fauour whom we would blesse with our moth, and yet curse them in our Esay. 5. 11. hearts: or els also we giue occasion to them whom we blesse openly to be greeued with our blessings, and to holde and count vs for cur∣sed, yea, if so be they be modest & hūble. For we shall see some arro∣gant and ambitious, which are greatly delighted, that men shoulde blow the trumpet, and pipe out merily with a loud voyce their prai∣ses. Now we may say that a curse shalbe imputed vnto him, that shal blesse his freend with a loud voyce: rising vp earely in the morning.
And this agreeth with that which Iesus Christ pronounceth: Woe be to you when al men praise you: for euen so did your fathers Luke. 6. 26. to the false Prophetes. Let vs learne heere not to bee curious to set foorth the praises of men: but let vs bee careful and diligent to giue glory and honour vnto our onely God, as it behoueth: and let vs take good heede in any wise to hurt the good name of our neigh∣bours by slaunderings, flatteries, leasings, and false tales. 15 A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a conten∣tious woman are a like. The woman is giuen of God vnto man for his ease, helpe, and comfort, that man being not alone, might the better mainteine and vpholde his house, and preserue the same in a good state, and that al thinges shoulde bee doone betweene them for the edification of their familie, and that it shoulde not fal into decay and destruction. Wherefore, when wee wil marry, wee must not looke vnto high estates, neither to riches, neither to nobilitie, or to an ancient stock, neither to credite, authoritie, or to the power therof: but the chiefe point standeth in enquiring after the honestie, genlenesse, humanity, wisedome, holinesse: and innocencie of the partie that wee desire to haue in marriage. For it may come to passe that wee may bee mar∣ried highly and rightly, for to raise our house, and to liue at our ease: but therewith wee may meete with a loftie and arrogant par∣tie, whome nothing may please: and there shalbe continual criyng and soule wether, wherevpon strifes and debates wil arise, and one of the parties shal withdrawe on the one side, and the other on the other: the which is cause of great ruine and destruction: as Solo∣mon Pro. 19. 13. hath wel shewed it before, and at this present doth pronounce the same againe, saying, A continuall dropping in the day of raine, &c. Albeit that hee doth not speake but of the wise, yet when the husband is contenti∣ous, the dropping is very dangerous. And as by the continual drop∣ping an house falleth to decay: euen so when either the man or the woman is giuen vnto contention, the children and housholde ser∣uants areeuil edified. The which is much worse thē if any sumptu∣ous and gorgeous house fal into decay, without being repaired. For
the children and seruants which are brought vp by an euil example, do not only perish concerning the body, but the soules also go vnto eternal destruction: yea if the children folow the euil trade of their fathers and mothers. Wee ought then to bee very careful to looke narrowly and straightly what partie wee take in marriage: for if Eze. 18. the wife be contentious and riotous, seeing it is a vice very natural vnto women to bee riotous, it is almost vnpossible to quiet it: no more then it is possible to stoppe the winde when it bloweth vehe∣mently that it shoulde goe no further: and no more it is possible to forbid any man to smel the sweete and pleasant baume or oint∣ment that is carried open in the hand. Solomon doeth signifie this same, saving, 16 He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and shee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it selfe. The more that we labour to withstande the winde, the more doe we feele it vehement and stormie: and the more that the oint∣ment is pressed in the hande, the more greater is the odour: euen so also when we labour to suppresse a riotous woman, and to make her to holde her peace, so much the more wil shee crye out, and take on the more. Neuerthelesse it is not to say, that we should not la∣bour to reduce women vnto modestie and humilitie: as S. Paule doeth in diuers places, shewing what ought to be the conuersation of the wiues: euen as hath beene alleadged heretofore. Now when Solomon speaketh thus at diuers times of women, making them like vnto the couering of a house perced through in a stormy wind, and because that for their sakes he doeth attribute crying vnto the oyntment, they shoulde be greatly ashamed, and carefull to keepe themselues silent, and to behaue themselues humbly and modestly. And forasmuch as the husbandes ought to bee the more wise, and to shewe the way vnto the wife, who is the weaker vessel, let them therefore vnderstande, that their lesson is heere gi∣uen them, that they may learne not to liue in theyr houses
like fierce & cruel Lions, but to be modest & quiet. It were expediēt to shewe heere the decay and destructions that commeth of the ri∣ots and contentions betweene the husbandes and the wiues: but Pro. 21. 9. 19 & 25. 24. it hath beene already largely handeled. 17 Iron sharpeneth yron: so doth a man sharpen the face of his freende. Wee knowe by experience that when we rubbe or whet the edge of a knife that is blunt, vpon some harde or sharpe thing, as vpon some peece of yron, or whet the same vpō an other knife, it is made to cut better then it did before: euen so also when man, which of himselfe, is not throughly awake, nor quick vnto worke, is stirred vp, and as it were pricked & spurred vp by an other, which wil not let him sleepe, then is his face sharpened: then doth he take courage, and shewe himselfe free and willing to yeelde his duetie, and to doe his office more readily then he was before, except he be vntractable, obstinate, and hardened. For then so farre it is of, that hee should be sharpened to doe wel, that rather his minde is stirred vp vnto wrath and furie, to contentions and debates, vnto murmu∣rings and seditions against him that prouoketh him: as Noe, Lot, Moses, the Prophets, Iesus Christ and his Apostles haue tried it by experience: and also nowe we haue trial thereof, in the scorners and contemners of the woorde of the Lorde, when wee labour to sharpen and quicken them vp by wholesome doctrine, by holy ad∣monitions, exhortations, and declarations, by reprehensions, cor∣rections, and threatninges. Such kind of men are like vnto swords which haue their edge so thicke and so blunt, that it wil not cut, doe what you can, albeit that you take great paines to whet and sharpen it. Now to the end that we may not be of the number of such indu∣rates, let vs be counselled to awake out of our sinnes, when dayly we are laboured to be sharpened by the word of the Lord, without any regarding whither we be strong & mighty, learned and wyse. We must therfore be folowers of Dauid, in that that hee patiently suffred Nathan to sharpen his face: and of S. Peter, which wept, when Iesus Christ sharpened his face by his countenance: and re∣sisted not: when S. Paule did also sharpen by his reprehension.
18 Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, shal eate the fruit there∣of: so hee that waiteth vpon his maister, shal come to honour. By the Fig tree, we may vnderstand al things that are brought out of the earth, and carie fruite. And so, Solomon doeth signifie, that he which is careful of keeping the blessings that his lande brin∣geth foorth, shalbe sustained and nourished with them, so that hee shal neuer want, nor neuer shalbe constrained to begge his bread, nor neuer shalbee blamed for negligence, nor for contempt of the good creatures that God hath giuen vnto him for his vse: as are the slouthful, the prodigal, and light people, which haue no considera∣tion of not wasting the substance that God giueth them, for to keepe it wel, and for to distribute the same wel vnto their houshold, and to the poore that neede and want. Solomon doeth signifie this same, when he saieth, Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, &c. Neuerthelesse, this is not onely to shewe vs of the foresaide care, but to make comparison: as he doeth shewe it, when he addeth, So he that keepeth his maister, &c. Wherein he warneth ser∣uantes not to forsake their maisters, promising vnto them, that as the Fig tree bringeth foorth his fruite for his vse, that keepeth good watche, euen so, the maister shal helpe al the necessities of his ser∣uaunt that forsaketh him not, but doeth keepe him at home with him, and is careful to serue him. And thus, as he honoureth his maister, keeping him, and not forsaking him: euen so, his maister wil honour him, not blaming, nor casting him off, but wil succour him in al his necessities. Wee haue heere then, diuers instructions. The first is, that wee should not contemne the earthly blessinges as vnprofitable, but that we should keepe a good watche, for to vse them as God hath ordeined. So doing, wee shal not be beggers, but enriched by the blessing of God, who wil giue vs the right and Mat. 6. 24. 25. profitable vse of the riches hee giueth vs into our handes. Yet not∣withstanding in keeping watche of our goods, let vs take heed that Luk. 12. 15. 22. we be not careful of to morowe, but rather let vs be careful of this, to folowe the doctrine of Iesus Christ. The seconde point, That al 1. Tit. 6. . Hebr. 13. 5.
subiectes and inferiour persons, al children and seruantes ought to helpe their Superiours, to be readie at their commandement, and diligently to doe their wil, as it hath beene to fore shewed by the scriptures. The third pointe, That al they which are in authoritie Rom. 13. 1. Ephe. 6. 1. 1. Tim. 6. 1. Tit. 2. 9. 2. Pet. 2. 13 should keepe wel that they contemne not, nor despise their subiects and inferiours, which are not disobedient, nor forsake them, but do honour them, doing their office, and paying vnto them, that which belongeth to them: as they are warned to doe in the places before alledged. The fourth, If it is not lawful for subiects and inferiours to forsake their carnal maisters: by a more strong reason must wee bee careful to keepe and hold fast our heauenly great maister: and he wil not despise vs, but giuing vnto vs abundātly al things in this world to vse, in the ende hee wil honour vs, glorifying vs in his heauenly kingdome for euer. 19 As in water, face answereth to face: so the hart of man to man. When a man looketh into a cleare spring of water, he seeth his image, euen as if he sawe himselfe in a glasse, or little difference: and so he seeth howe taul he is, by the correspondancie or represen∣tation that is shewed in the water: and as he remooueth and chan∣geth place, euen so doeth his representation: and if he stande stil, it standeth stil also: so that it might seeme to them which are not ac∣customed to see suche a thing, that the representation had moouing, life, & vnderstanding: the which is false neuerthelesse, as we know: for it is nothing but a dead shadowe, and which soone vanisheth a∣way. Euen so, when we apply our heartes and mindes to behold the natures, customes, & maners of our neighbours, we see our image, and may iudge what we are: for wee are like vnto ourselues, and are the liuely images, and the true representations one of an other, in as much as we are al the children of Adam. And so, if we see any malice in our neighbours, let vs not be pleased in ourselues, & flat∣ter vs, in praysing ourselues more then they: for we haue the roote of al euil in vs, as we shewe wel, when God doeth slacke vs the bri∣dle. It may seeme at the first sight, that Solomon doeth admonishe vs hereof, when he saieth,
As in water, &c. But there is another sense and meaning, which agreeth better according to the nature which is in the water and in the heart of man. For as one water agreeth & is like vnto another, but yet it runneth, & hath no stedfastnesse to come and stande by the other: euen so albeit that the hearts of men are one like to ano∣ther, and that they haue some likenesse togither, and some knitting and coniunction, yet is there no tenure and holde: for as one man doeth easily separate himselfe from another, and turneth away his minde, not caring for his acquaintance, alliance, or confederacy: To day, a man wil shew himself wel minded towards his neighbour, & in lesse while then turning of a hande he wil be gone, and shewe dis∣daine, or wil declare to be his enemie. And thus Solomon teacheth vs, that we must not looke to men to trust in them, no more then to the water which rometh, and is not knowne where it becōmeth: but the Lord is faythful, and changeth not, in whome we must trust: and say with an assured heart with Dauid, it is better to trust in the Lord, then to trust in men, &c. Thus dooing, though the heartes of Psa. 118. 8. 9. men doe runne away from vs as doeth water, yet shal wee not re∣moue. For they that trust in the Lord, are as mount Sion, which cā∣not Psal. 125. 1. be remoued, but standeth fast for euer. Contrarily, if forsaking our God, we put our trust in men, we shalbe frustrate and voide of our hope, and shalbe accursed. Albeit then that God hath created, & set vs in this worlde for to serue one another, yet for to haue a sure Iere. 17. 5. Psal. 129. 1. helpe we should looke to the Lord, as Dauid teacheth vs. 20 The graue and destruction can neuer be ful, so the eyes of man can neuer be satisfied. At the beginning man was created after the ymage of God, after the which he was exempted from death and destruction: into the Gene. 1. 27. 2. Pet. 2. 4. Iude. 6. which the Angels fel, to wit, those that sinned. Now the Deuil see∣ing himself thus depriued of glorie and felicitie, and to bee damned for euer, did enuie the glory & blessed estate wherin mā was placed: & therfore from the beginning he hath made his batteries, that he might throw man headlōg into the same damnatiō. Now man hath Gene. 3. not resisted the assaultes of the Deuil, but hath easily yelded vnto him: by his rebellion & disobediēce hath put out this ymage, intro∣ducing
sinne into the world, and by sinne death. And as the Deuill Rom. 5. 12. Iohn. 8. 44. 1. Peter. 5. 8. Ephe. 6. 10. Mat. 12. 43. Iohn. 8. 44. from the beginning hath beene a lyer and murtherer, euen so doeth hee not cease to pursue his worke. S. Paule doeth wel signifie the same. And thus the Deuil is neuer filled nor satisfied with the dam∣nation of mankinde: as also Iesus Christ our Lorde doeth signifie it wel. And forasmuch as by the continual enuie of the Deuill, and by the sinne of man, who hath consented to the Deuil, al humaine creatures tende to death, and goe to the graue, and that in mans iudgement and outwarde experience, the sepulcher or graue corrup∣teth and bringeth al the body which it receiueth to nothing, and neuer refuseth any, nor neuer yeeldeth any backe againe, but con∣sumeth them, without any remedie, as the worldlinges and carnall men esteeme, and as it is seene before our eyes, and by experience in al worldes: for this cause, that which is proper to the Diuel, is attri∣buted vnto the graue, and is called destruction that neuer can bee ful. For when Solomon, hauing named the graue, setteth afterwards destruction, this is by Repetition or expositiō. For it is as if he said, the graue which consumeth, and swalloweth what soeuer is giuen too it, is neuer wearie of receiuing & corrupting al that is brought vnto it. Nowe that which Solomon pronounceth in this place, is seene by experience to the eye: and therfore, Solomon tendeth not to teache vs the nature of the graue, the which is knowne: but ra∣ther he wil set before vs our miserie, and partly shewe vs the fruites of our sinnes, which are death and destruction. For if there had beene no sinne, we had had no neede of graue: and without sinne, there had bin no temporal nor eternal death: but because of sinne, Iohn. 11. 25. 26 we must dye, and be buried. Notwithstanding if we dye in the feare of the Lord, being assured that he is our resurrection & our life, the graue shal not be our destruction, but as a rest, wherein our bodies doe sleepe, looking for the blessed resurrection: and our death is a ready passage from death to life. Contrarily, to the vnfaythful the graue and temporal death are their entrance vnto eternal destructi∣on. For albeit that at the last, they shal rise againe, yet shal it not bee to liue, but to be tormented in paines euerlasting: the which is a ve∣ry sharpe & hard death, & which neuer shal haue end. Solomon thē Dan. 12. 2. Ioha. 5. 29. doth rebuke mē for their vnsatiablenes, cōparing their greedy desires vnto the graue and destruction: as he doth shewe, when he addeth,
So the eyes of man can neuer be satisfied. Wherin we haue to note, that hee speaketh of the man that is left in his natural cor∣ruption, who suffereth himselfe to be transported by his euil concu∣piscences and disordinate affections. For they that are regenerate, and made newe creatures by the holy Ghost, are satisfied, and craue nothing further, but onely that the good wil of God should be done and fulfilled. And for to conserue this satisfying wel, they fight, la∣bouring for to destroy and kil the relikes of sin, which are stil in their fleshe, the which, because of the same relikes, lusteth against the spi∣rite. And so, Solomon speaketh not of the eyes of the children of God, but of the euil affections of the children of Adam, which al∣so Gal. 5. 17. are the children of the Deuil. And as the Deuil is not filled nor satisfied to see, & to pursue the decaie and destruction of men: euen so his children haue neuer satisfied enough their affections, but doe daily growe, as we prooue it by experience in many: as in the am∣bitious, couetous, & vsurers. Solomon calleth such affections, eyes, and not without cause: for whatsoeuer is set before mans eye, hee stil desireth to see more. Euen so wee can neuer satisfie our affectiōs, and chiefly when they tende to ruine and destructions wherunto they which tende thither, are like vnto their father the Deuil, who is neuer satisfied with the destruction of men. 21 As is the fining pot for siluer, and the furnace for gold: so is euerie man according to his dignitie. Wee haue alreadie had this same sentence, sauing that in place of, So doeth the Lorde trye the heartes: we haue heere, So is e∣uerie Pro. 17. 3. man according to his dignitie. This is not to say, that man of himselfe hath any dignitie or excellencie, wherby he should deserue to be so handled: or thus, or to haue suche and suche reputation: for al men of themselues are nothing worth, they are nothing but earth and durt, filthinesse and corruption, and are filled with malice and wickednesse: and so they deserue not to be esteemed nor pray∣sed. But as the gold is more precious then the siluer not of it owne selfe, for it is a dead creature, and serueth to no vse, except because that we trimme and dresse it for to serue vnto profite, S: vnto de∣light: euen so, one man shalbe more woorthie and more excellent
then an other, because that God by his fauour esteemeth him, and dresseth him for to make him serue as he shal thinke good: as Saint Paul saith: For who separateth thee? and what hast thou, that thou 1. Cor. 4. 7. hast not receiued? &c. And daily, the more that God esteemeth and setteth by an humane creature, so much the more doth he examime and trie him the more narrowly, & exerciseth him by great assalts: as our holie auntient fathers haue alwayes tried by experience, and aboue al, Iesus Christ our Lorde, who of himselfe onely was wor∣thie to be esteemed and praysed: for he is the Lambe without spot. It is he that hath not sinned, neither was there any guile founde in his mouth. It is he onely, of whome the Father saieth, This is my wel beloued Sonne, in whome I am wel pleased. And yet, hee hath Mat. 3. bene tempted in al thinges, yea, euen to the going downe to hell. Wherefore when God sendeth vs afflictions, let vs not thinke that it is because he hath reiected vs, or doeth hate vs: but let vs know, that it is because that of his grace and mercie, he iudgeth vs woor∣thie for himselfe, doeth loue vs, and that hee receiueth vs for his housholde seruantes and children: let it be, that hee doeth afflict vs for our sinnes, be it, that he would prooue our Fayth and patience, and humilitie and obedience. For (as it hath bene handeled) God doeth prooue vs by afflictions for diuers causes. As touching the Pro. 17. 3. reprobate, forasmuch as by the afflictions which are sent them, they returne not vnto God by repentance, and that they doe not beare them patiently, but doe murmure and despight God, and are despe∣rate, they are neither like vnto gold nor siluer, but to drye wood, to chaffe, and to haye, which is easily consumed in the fire. 22 Though thou shouldest braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Pestel, yet wil not his foolish∣nesse depart from him. When we bray wheate in a Morter, we vnhuske the skinne, so that afterwards it is easie to separate the good floure from the bren: but the foole is so obstinate and hardened in his follie, that for any chasteninges, howe grieuous and sharpe soeuer they be, yet can he not be depriued of it: as in diuers places here before, Solomon hath complayned of it: and as we may shewe by examples of the scrip∣ture:
and amongest other of Pharao and of the Iewes, which God corrected by diuers and sharpe afflictions. Wherein wee haue to note, that albeit naturally we are al fooles, yet the scripture calleth the mockers and contemners of God & of al religion chiefly fooles, which wil not amend for any thing that may happē. And so, though he loose his time in correcting and chastening such kinde of people, Pro. 22. 15. yet is it not to say, that we should forbeare to chasten them whome wee count fooles: for foolishnesse is bounde in the heart of a child: but the rodde of correction shal driue it away from him. And albe∣it that for their sake, and for their profite we loose time, and winne nothing, yet it is verie necessarie to bray them, that first of al they should serue for example, and other shoulde feare to commit follie. Secondly, that troubles might cease, and that they which loue wis∣dome, and folowe it, might liue in peace. Let vs therefore vnder∣stande, that Solomon doeth not pretende to forbid that Iustices Rom. 2. 5. should not punishe fooles, but he reprooueth the foolishe of obsti∣nacie, and of hardnesse of heart: and for this cause doeth foreshew them priuily their eternal destruction: as Saint Paul saith, But thou, after thine hardnesse, and heart that can not repent, heapest vntoo thy selfe wrath, against the day of wrath, and of the declaration of the iust iudgement of God. 23 Be diligent to knowe the state of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes. Many doe thinke it a vile and a base thing, and greatly to bee contemned, that man should be contented to rule his familie, and the affayres of his house in simplicitie, which are fit and meete to helpe the necessities of his children and housholde, and should not aspire as concerning the matters of this worlde no higher. Suche a man shalbe counted faint hearted, and a man nothing woorth: and they wil say, he is a cowarde and a foole. And therefore they that would exalt themselues, set vp their feathers (as is said) and labour to flye, higher and higher: and to doe this, they folowe the Eryers, which finde no house worse then their owne. And so, these men which would be esteemed and be aloft, doe go away farre from their
familie, and seeke to dwel with Kinges, Princes, and Lordes of the earth, for to get riches, and to obtaine glorie and honour, credite and authoritie, and to make their name perpetual for euer. This de∣sire is verie disordinate: and therefore Solomon woulde not haue vs to folowe them: as he doeth shewe it vs, when he saieth, Be di∣ligent to knowe, &c. Notwithstanding, let vs not thinke that it is euil done for a man to giue vp and forsake his lowe estate, when God doth place him in higher state, and doeth exalt him. As we wil not accuse Ioseph, when from the going out of the prison, receiued Gen. 41. Exo. 3. 1. Sam. it, insteede whereas he was a poore slaue, to be the seconde in the countrie of Egypt: nor Moses, when he left the flocke with Iethro, and receiued the gouernment of the people of God: nor Dauid, when he left his fathers flocke, and folowed the court of Saul, and obtained the Crowne, &c. For we must folow the calling of God: but if we be not assured of his calling, let it suffice vs to take care of the riches which are in our possession alreadie: the which Solomon doeth signifie by the flocke and heardes. For in olde time men were verie diligent to rayse and bring vp cattel: as we may see it in Abra∣ham, Isaack, Iacob, and other children of Iacob, which were Pa∣stours, and had many great flockes. If we be not contented there∣with, and that we aspire more high after the worlde, thinking to bring vs ease for a long time, and during which time, to possesse great riches, and to enioy glorie and honour, & to be in credite and authoritie, we are deceiued: as Solomon doth shew vs, saying. 24 For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from ge∣neration, to generation. The worldlings and carnal men, by the experience that is seene in the worlde, wil speake according to this sentence: they wil say, that there is nothing here beneath that is sure and stable, and that al thinges are subiect vnto changinges, and that sodeinly they are remooued and altered, yea, that easily they vanish away. We shal see riches to vanish out of their handes which possesse them, either by fire, or by water, or by theeues and robbers, or by suttle meanes, or by lawe and sutes, or by excesse and dissolutenesse: we shal see at this day, great Lordes to flourish and prosper, to be mightie and fearful,
which quickly vanish away, either by warre, or by death, either vio∣lent or natural. As these alterations are seene with the eye, euen so do they confesse them, but it is not as they ought. For al they which haue not knowne, neither doe know the prouidence of God, doe at∣tribute such alterations vnto the violence and malice of men, or to fortune and chance, and so much as in them lieth, they depriue God of his gouernment, and doe spoile him of his Maiestie, glorie, & po∣wer. And so, it is not true, that the worldlings and carnal men speak agreeable to this sentence, but in apparance onely: for Solomon doeth not here in any wise pretende to derogate the gouernment, glorie, power, and Maiestie of God, but rather to mainteine them, when hee pronounceth that the riches and honours of the worlde are of no long continuance: and heerein hee confesseth the proui∣dence of God. Otherwise, he should not haue spoken in true wise∣dome: Pro. 8. 14. 15 16. & 10. 22 & 16. 9. 33 and also he should speake against himselfe. For here before speaking in the person of wisedome, he hath saide, I haue counsel & wisedome, I haue vnderstanding, and I haue strength, &c. And the blessing of the Lorde doeth make men riche. And the heart of man purposeth his way: but the Lorde doeth direct his steppes. The lot is cast into the lappe: but the whole disposition thereof, is of the Lorde. Daniel also did wel knowe the prouidence of God: as ap∣peareth Dan. 2. 20. 21. 22. & 4 14. in his booke. Wherefore, let vs not be careful to attaine vnto high degree: but whilest it shal please the Lorde that wee are in a lowe state, let vs not loose that which our fieldes bring foorth, but let vs with care and diligence gather them, according as God hath sent it vs, and shewed in our earthly possessions: the which Solomon doeth signifie by the mountaines, saying, 25 The heye discouereth it selfe, and the grasse appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered. He speaketh thus, after the situation of the lande that the Lord had giuen to the children of Israel, wherein there were a multitude of mountaines. And as we must be diligent to gather the goods that God giueth vs, euen so also, ought wee not to be curious of braue and costly garments, which may be of great shewe, and great price, nor a multitude of men liuing of our wages, for to doe our worke
with so great superfluous exspences, or to be about vs to reuerence vs: but according to the profite that we can lawfully spend by our reuenue, let vs be clothed, and holde seruantes to doe our worke, Solomon doeth teach the same, saying, 26 The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field. Likewise we should not be greedie of daintie and delicate di∣shes, nor to be superfluous and excessiue in eating and drinking, as wantons, gluttons, drunkardes, nor to deny foode to those which doe our worke, as vnmerciful and cruel men which sucke the blood and the substance of their hirelinges as much as they can: but let vs be sober and temperate, contenting ourselues with litle: and as we would be nourished, euen so, let vs administer necessities vnto our seruantes, maydes, and hirelings: according to that which Solomon doeth teach vs, saying, 27 And let the milke of the Goates bee sufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the suste∣nance of thy maydes. And as we must be sober, so must wee mainteine our familie, our children and houshold seruantes in sobrietie. And thus in these fiue last sentences, we are taught to flye couetousnesse, and to con∣tent ourselues with thinges present, not to be ambitious, but to continue and holde stil the state wherein God hath placed vs, wal∣king in the same with al humblenesse, to abhorre al brauenesse and gorgeous attires, walking with simple and honest garments: and to hate daintinesse, gluttonie & drunkennesse, vsing common meates with sobernesse and temperancie.
The xxviii. Chapter. 1 The wicked flye, when none pursueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon. WE do al naturally desire to haue peace and rest, to liue safely and without feare, and also to flourishe, to tri∣umphe and to prosper in this world. This desire of it selfe is not euil: but the meanes most often times are vnlawful and wicked, by the which men labour to inioy their de∣sires: and also our minde and heart is fixed and set so much therevppon, that wee suffer ourselues by them to bee transported and carried a∣way, neither doe wee care what wee doe, prouided that wee may come to enioy them. The wicked for to accomplish their desires, will not care what they doe, but wil runne hyther and thither, vp and downe, doing oppression and violence vnto the innocent, which can not bee reuenged: as Cain against Abel his brother: the sonnes of Iacob against Ioseph their brother, Pharao against the children of I-Isreal, and Iudas against Iesus Christe. But as these haue obteined nothing by their violence and oppression, euen so al wicked mē shal profite little better. And albeit that in mans iudgement & outward apparance wee tremble and quake vnder them, and that wee on the one side doe greatly feare their presence, and that they on the other side are bolde and safe, and feare no man, yet for al that in spyte of them, and let them doe what they can, their conscience doeth re∣prooue and rebuke them so liuely, that though no man doe pursue and hunt them, but that al the world (as a man mightsay) doth com∣mende and praise them, yet doe they not cease to feare and tremble within: as wee may knowe by the confessions which the wicked before alledged haue made, and by witnesses of the scriptures. And according vnto the threatenings conteyned in the lawe, Solomon saith,
The wicked flye, &c. Wherein wee haue to note, that Solomon speaketh of the flight of the wicked in the plural number, and of the Leui. 26. 36. 37. Deut. 28. 65 66. 67. Esai. 57. 20. 21. pursute in the singular: and is as much as if hee did say, Albeit that no man pursueth a wicked man, no, not one, yet do they al flye, and are al troubled and feared by their owne conscience, which fighteth against them. Contrarily, although that in mans iudgement, and outwarde appearance, the iust and innocent be poore and miserable, and that they are alwayes in danger, and bee neuer in safetie, and are not suffered to liue in rest, and that men labour to feare & trou∣ble them by great pursutes that are made against them, and that it seemeth they haue neither place nor time, where they may be safe and in peace: yet God maketh them inuincible, because hee hath purified their consciences, the which doe not condemne them, and because they desire nothing more then to obey his worde. And this is according as hee hath promised in his law. And by his Prophetes hee doeth often promise, that hee wil deliuer his poore sheepe, and Leuit. 26. 3 Deut. 28. make them dwel in safetie, that none shal make them afraid. Wher∣vnto Solomon accordeth, saying, But the righteous, &c. Wherein let vs note, that as the Lion of himselfe hath no power to defend and saue his pray, and cannot assure himselfe, and be bolde, except that God had giuen him suche a nature, and mainteined him therein: euen as wee of our owne selues are not righteous, but the same commeth of the grace and mercy of God, which changeth our nature and imputeth the righ∣teousnesse of his Sonne Iesus Christ vnto vs: euen so of ourselues wee shoulde fly as wicked, but by the free promises he assureth and maketh vs bolde, printing them in our heartes by his holy spirite. And this is the cause for the which we see the poore faithful to bee so constant in bearing the persecutions with ioy and patience. And as the Lyon, (according to the nature hee hath receiued of God) knoweth wel how to vse his strength, to assure himself, and be bolde: euen so the righteous trusting in the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ, the which is imputed vnto them, doe feare no power, whi∣ther it bee earthly or hellish, carnal or spiritual: but say with Da∣uid, The Lorde is my light and my saluation, of whome shal I bee Psal. 27. 1. 2, 3 afraide? &c. And thus it is not in their owne power that the iust doe trust, assure themselues, & are bold, but in the power & might of GOD, in his grace and mercie. For as of themselues they
are bare and voide of righteousnesse, as they knowe wel enough: euen so also they knowe wel, that they want al strength, except that the almightie doeth vpholde them, and worke in them both the wil and the deede. Notwithstanding, let vs vnderstand, that albeit none of himselfe is iust, but that of our own nature we are wicked & vn∣godly, yet doeth the holie scripture cal vs righteous, when we refer∣ring & giuing vnto the grace & mercy of God, by the meanes of the obedience that Iesus Christ hath rendred for vs, and trusting that he is our righteousnesse, our satisfaction, & redemption, we mourn and lament our sins, & striuing to bring foorth fruites worthie of repen∣tance, in loue vnfained. For the principal fruites that God requireth that we should bring forth towardes our neighbours, is, that what∣soeuer we would that men should do vnto vs, we should doe vnto them the like. And the scripture calleth those wicked, which vtterly despise these things, & scorn thē, & delight in al kind of wickednes. 2 For the transgression of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderstanding and know∣ledge, a realme likewise endureth long. If we diligently read the holie scriptures, wee shal finde that the children of Israel in smal time haue had many Gouernours, Iudges, and Kings. And if we ouerlooke the profane Chronicles, we shal see that in al nations there hath beene often mutation and changing of gouernors, Princes, & Kings. The worldlings & carnal, do not think from whence these alterations come, but doe chiefly attribute them vnto fortune: yea, when a King hath bene ouercome by his enemy, we wil say, That fortune was against him. But the holie Ghost by the scripture doeth teach vs farre otherwise: to wit, that it is God who changeth Kinges, and kingdomes, as seemeth him good: and albeit that hee doeth change them after his wil, yet is it not with∣out Dan. 2 & 4. good cause. Sometimes he doth remoue & take away Kings be∣cause they be wicked: as he tooke away Soul & others: sometimes, because the people was vnwoorthie to haue good Kings: as hee tooke Iosias the King of Israel, from the children of Israel, in the 18. yeere of his reigne, or there aboutes: for he was verie angry against Iuda, because of their iniquities. And this is the cause that Solo∣mon 2. King. 23.
setteth before vs, when hee saieth, For the transgressions of the lande, there are many, &c. And because that oftentimes we see it happen, that the people followe the maners of their King and of his gouernours, wee ought to bee verie careful & diligent to pray vnto God, that it would please him not to giue vs a King in his wrath, but that hee woulde place ouer vs suche rulers as are of a sounde and perfect conscience, and that wil walke honestly and religiously, iustly and vprightly before vs, to the end, that after their example, we might liue holily and chast∣ly vnder them, separating ourselues from al iniquitie, foolishnesse, and wickednesse. Thus doing, the Lorde wil not sodeinly change our gouernours, after he hath giuen vs good, for to punish our ini∣quities: but because that through vnderstanding and knowledge, we haue bene turned from al offences, dissolutenesse, and insolen∣cie, from al maliciousnesse, wrong dooing, and crueltie, the Lorde wil haue pitie vpon vs, and hauing giuen vnto vs by his grace, good Superiours and vpright Magistrates, he wil continue his grace to∣wardes vs, in prolonging, and making their kingdome and gouern∣ment long to endure. This is it that Solomon meaneth, when hee sayeth, And by a man of vnderstanding. &c. Albeit that Solo∣mon speaketh in the singular number, yet because of the Antithesis, we must vnderstande that he speaketh of many men, by whose wis∣dome and good counsel, Kinges and Rulers are confirmed and sta∣blished, and are not sodeinly changed. True it is, notwithstanding that whatsoeuer commeth to passe by the vnderstanding & know∣ledge of many, may also be done by the wisedome and good coun∣sel of one: as the Ecclesiast. declareth. We may also say, that a King Eccle. 9. 13. 14. 15. of vnderstanding and knowledge, may long vpholde and mainteine himselfe in his estate, and to let and stop his enemies from stealing his Empire and kingdome from him: as it happened in the dayes of Dauid, Solomon and Ezekias. But howe soeuer we take this sen∣tence, yet haue Kings, Princes, Gouernors, and Iudges of the earth, their lessons therein, by the which they are admonished to bee at∣tentiue Deut. 17. 18 19. 20. Psal. 2. 10. 11. 12. Psal. 20. & 21. and diligently to heare the lawe of God, as it is appointed them: and that they should not be ignorant, but learned in the feare of the Lord: as the holie Ghost doeth counsel them. So doing, they shal not perish in the wrath & anger of God: but he wil giue vnto
them their desires, & raise them vnto glorie & dignitie: as the faith∣ful doe craue and require the same, & as they affirme & confesse it. And as they should be thus ruled by the word of the Lord, euen so, also ought they to be diligent & careful in nourishing and maintei∣ning of their people. And for to finish this wel, they must be diligent to mainteine & defende the good & quiet, & to roote out the wic∣ked & seditious: as Dauid doth teach them, by the protestation hee maketh, & as S. Paul doth teach them. The people also haue therein Psal. 101. Rom. 13. Esai. 3. 2. 3. Osee. 13. 10. 11 their lesson, to wit, that they are admonished to liue holily & inno∣cently, & not to prouoke God to wrath by their iniquities, least God giue them a King in his wrath: as hee hath threatned before this time, the children of Israel. 3 A poore man, if he oppresse the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode. It is a verie euil thing that is daily committed in the worlde, that the mightie & rich do polle & eate the litle & poore: though God Exo. 22. 21▪ Leuit. 19. 13 Esai. 1. 23. & 3. 13. hath expresly forbidden it in his lawe, & that hee doeth often com∣plaine therof by his Prophets. But moreouer this is worse, when hee that is poore, shal extort & shew such crueltie to them which are in necessitie & pouertie, that hee will pil & eate them. Solomon doth signifie it, when hee compareth such a poore man which spoileth the substance & goods of the poore, vnto raging raine, that carieth a∣way with it the seed & trees with the fat of the earth: and after the same, is great want & scarcitie of vittailes. Such a raging raine doth not onely not profite it selfe, but also bringeth great hurt vnto the earth, & to them which haue dressed, sowne, & planted it. Euen so, such a poore man as extorteth & wringeth from an other poore mā, hath soone consumed that which he hath rauished, & cannot be en∣riched therewith: for that which hee can get, & take from a man in necessitie, is not much, but a verie smal thing, in comparison of the great desire wherwith he is caried to make a spoile vpon the needy. And not gaining ought therby, he doth great hurt & destruction to him whom he pilleth and spoileth: and afterwardes he cannot helpe him, though he would. But if he that is rich & mightie, doth take pi∣tie & compassion of the poore man that he robbed, he hath where∣with to help him. And so, as it may seeme, he is not so dāgerous nor hurtful, as is the poore that extorteth from the needie.
Wherefore, let vs vnderstand that the poore which haue neede of charitable almes, reliefe, and mercie shewed vnto them, are admoni∣shed to turne away from al rauening and extortion, and chiefly of the needie: otherwise as the worldlinges and carnal, which looke not to the hande of God, which sendeth suche seasons as him plea∣seth, doeth curse the raging rayne that bringeth famine: euen so, the poore which doe extort vpon the needie, shalbe cursed of God, who wil cast them into an horrible necessitie, wherein they shalbe perpetually tormented. 4 They that forsake the lawe, prayse the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them. There is none howe wicked soeuer he is, that doeth not desire to haue good reputation, and to be placed in the number of honest men, as if he submitted himselfe vnto the lawe of God as he ought to doe. And for to haue this reputation, they wil doe many goodly things which shal haue some sight of goodnesse, righteousnesse, and religion, the which shal dazel the eyes of the simple & ignorant: but they that haue a quick and sharp sight, & diligent eares, & wil apply themselues rightly, to know what they ought either to say or to do, for to submit themselues vnto the lawe of God, and not to decline either on the right, or on the left hande, may iudge and discerne, that suche shadowes are of no value. Solomon doth giue vs markes and tokens thereof, by the which we may so iudge, when he saieth, They that forsake the lawe, &c. When we shal know what it is to praise the wicked, we shal vnderstand who they are that forsake the lawe. And therefore wee must note, that to praise the wicked, is to commend him, to allow of him, to fauour him, to reuerence him, to helpe him, to mainteine and vphold him, to take his part, to defende and to iustifie him: as doe flatterers, lyers, slanderers and false wit∣nesses: as doe al Iudges and Magistrates, which are corrupted with couetousnesse, ambition, acception and regarding of persons, with crueltie and tyrannie: as do al Kings, Princes, and Superiours of the earth, which care not to folowe right and equitie, but wil haue their wil for euerie lawe: as also doe al they which cal themselues Prelates and men of the Church in Poperie, which are ledde with a∣uarice, and ambition, and desire to liue in pleasures & wantonnes.
All suche kinde of people do forsake the lawe: for they haue no re∣uerence vnto the worde of God, nor loue to their neighbours, and despise al good order, and al pollicie wel ruled. The present expositi∣on Rom. 2. & 3 1. Pet. 2. of praising, may be drawne out of Saint Paule, Saint Peter, and others. And also Solomon doth shew vs that we must so vnderstand it, when hee addeth, But they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them. For a∣gainst praysing, hee setteth to bee moued, or to bee angry. Wherein hee declareth that they which giue and apply themselues rightly and with a pure desire to refourme their spirite and vnderstanding, their maners and conuersation according vnto the word of God, and to keepe good order and pollicie wel ruled, that they shalbe so farre of, from praising the wicked, or shoulde fauour them any thing, that rather being inflamed and stirred vp against them, because of their wickednesse, they will rebuke, chide, and reprooue them, they wyll threaten and condemne them, and according to the power that God hath giuen them, they wil destroy and roote them out: the Exod. 32. 27 Numb. 16. which chiefly is the duetie and office of good kings, princes, and su∣periours of the earth: as Moses doeth wel shewe it them. Moreo∣uer let vs note, that as to forsake the lawe, is to despise and reiect it, and to turne al our minde from it: so also to keepe the lawe, is to e∣steeme and receiue it, and to giue our heartes altogether to bee ru∣led and gouerned thereafter: and not perfectly to fulfil it: for it is vnpossible by reason of their weakenes of the flesh, for the corrup∣tion of our nature, & for the relikes of sinne which cōtinualy dwel∣leth Rom. 7. Gala. 5. Rom. 8. in vs: as Saint Paule doeth wel shewe it: but for Iesus Christe his sake who hath fulfilled it for vs, we are deliuered from condem∣nation. Some say that they which forsake the lawe, are mooued against them that keepe the lawe. 5 Malicious men vnderstande not iudgement: but they that seeke the Lorde, vnderstand al thinges. When a man delighteth not to doe a thing, or doth not accept and take in good part that which is tolde him, hee wil say he Psal. 36. 3. vnderstandeth nothing. According to the which sense it is saide of the wicked, that hee forbeareth to vnderstand, and to doe wel. And
according thereafter, Solomon saith, Malicious men vnderstande not iudgement: for when men are giuen vnto malice and wicked∣nesse, and that they thinke to doe nothing but hurt, they vnderstand not iudgement: that is to say, they take not in good part, that they are shewed what is good and right, neither delight to apply them∣selues thereto, yet, forasmuch as for to punishe the malicious, God doth abandon and giue them vp vnto a reprobate sense, we may say that the malicious are so dul, ignorant and blinde, that they cannot knowe what is good and right: and for this cause doe turne away, and doe cleane contrary, as if they had conspired to turne al vpside downe. In the number of suche, we may chiefly place al wicked iud∣ges, Psal. 82. 5. of whom it is saide, they wil not be learned, nor vnderstande, but walke on stil in darkenesse: and al they also which falsely vsurpe the title of Pastours and Ministers, of whome it is saide, The Priestes saide not, Where is the Lorde? and they that shoulde mini∣ster the lawe, knewe mee not: the pastours also offend against mee, and the Prophetes prophesied in Baal, and went after things that did Iere. 2. 8. not profite. And finally, wee may place al contemners and scorners of God and of his worde: for they vnderstand not iudgement, but are rebellious against God, and outragious and cruel against their neighbours, without any remorse or care of amendment: the which is a certaine argument that they doe not delight in any thing that is good and right, and wil vnderstande nothing therein. This kinde of blindnesse or blockishnesse doeth proceede of contempt of God, whome they wil not vouchsafe to call vppon, nor accknowledge as they ought. Solomon doeth signifie this same, by his Antithesis or contrary, when he saith, But they that seeke the Lorde, &c. And therewith hee sheweth vs that if wee wil take delight in goodnesse and righte∣ousnesse, and willingly to heare admonition, and to bee set in the right way, wee must seeke God, in calling vpon him, praising, than∣king and confessing that hee is the authour of al goodnesse, & ther∣fore must needes wholy submit ourselues vnto his worde, which is the rule of al righteousnesse and equitie. Thus doing, wee shal vn∣derstand whatsoeuer we ought to doe, for to serue God in a sounde conscience, and our neighbours in true loue. Heerein consisteth & standeth the right vnderstanding of the iudgement that God requi∣reth
of vs: as we may vnderstand by the scripture, when Dauid ioy∣neth vnderstanding with the seruice of God. To the end therefore that we may vnderstand iudgement as we ought, and that wee Deut. 29. 9. Pro. 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. may want nothing of that which wee ought to vnderstande, but may vnderstand whatsoeuer is necessary for vs to walke rightly, let vs bee diligent to seeke the Lord, as Esay doeth admonish vs. Now as it is necessary for vs to seeke the Lord al the daies of our life, and in any wise not to turne from his presence, euen as we are admoni∣shed, Esay. 55. 6. 7 Psal. 105. 4. Seeke the Lorde and his strength, seeke his face euermore: euē so must wee increase and profite from day to day in the vnder∣standing of iudgement: seeing that wee neuer vnderstand it so al, that wee can learne no more: for al that wee knowe and vnderstand 1. Cor. 13. 9. 12. is neuer perfect in this worlde, as S. Paul dot pronounce it. Where∣fore, when Solomon saith, that wee vnderstand all, if wee seeke the Lord: let vs therfore imagine a state of perfection in this life, wher∣vnto nothing may be added: but that wee haue a right sounde, and true vnderstanding, according as the Lorde shal see to be expedient, and as it shal please him to giue the measure and portion of his gra∣ces. And when wee see that the wicked are mooued to seeke the Mat. 9. 13. Eph. 14 17. 18 19. Lorde: and also that Iesus Christe saith, I am not come to cal the righteous, but sinners to repentance: let vs knowe that the malici∣ous whereof Solomon speaketh heere, are such as are obstinate and durate in their malice, of whom Solomon speaketh. 6 Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightnesse, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich. When Solomon is not contented to haue exalted the poore that walketh in his integritie, therby the poore ought to be admonished to bee contented with their state, without murmuring, or dispiting of God, and without giuing themselues to deceipt, to euil trades, or to rauishing and the euery. And when hee suppresseth and blameth the riche which is peruersly and wickedly ledde, then let vs al re∣member the admonition of the Apostle Saint Iames, Let the bro∣ther of lowe degree, reioyce when hee is exalted: contrarily, hee that is riche, in that hee is made lowe, &c. Iam. 1. 9. 10. And also let the riche tremble at the thereatninges of Iesus
Christ, who saith, Woe be to you, yee riche men: for ye haue your consolation, &c. and of Saint Iames, Nowe goe to, yee rich men, Luk. 16. 24. 25 Iam. 5. 1. weepe, and houle, for the miseries that shal come vpon you, &c. Not to the ende that they should dispaire, but in true humilitie of heart they shoulde be turned vnto the Lord, whose blessing maketh rich, and not the labour that is taken to gather goods together with great couetousnesse: and that renouncing the same, they should vse the goods which God giueth them, with thanks giuing: as haue doone the holy Patriarkes, which had abundance of riches, the which they held, not with blame and offence. Likewise Solomon doth not sim∣ply and absolutely beate downe the riche, nor riches, which are the good creatures of God, but the riche that gouerneth himselfe euill to the slaunder and hurt of his neighbours, in gathering riches on al sides, and hauing gotten them, denieth to shewe mercy vnto the poore and needie, fearing lest his goods should decay and diminish, and the earth shoulde faile. The simple poore man is better then such a riche man: and that for diuers causes, as hath beene shewed Pro. 19. 1. already. 7 Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderstanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, shameth his fa∣ther. When fathers and mothers are godly, wise, and prudent, and doe followe the word of God, then are they careful to instruct their children, and to shew them howe they shoulde followe God, and howe they shoulde liue vnder the lawe▪ For when the parentes are wise, they greatly delight that their family shoulde bee giuen vntoo wisedome, that God may bee honoured and serued amongst them, and that the house and affaires thereof should bee in good state, and that nothing shoulde bee wasted nor consumed. The children which follow the minde of their parentes (which is this,) are wise: as Solomon doeth pronounce, saying, Hee that keepeth the lawe, &c. By the law, Solomon doth not onely vnderstande the chiefe commandements of God, which doe teach vs to serue him with true religion, but also al instructions which shewe vs howe wee shoulde gouerne our houses in al sober∣nesse,
modestie, and temperancie, that may shunne and auoide all superfluities, excesse, dissolutenesse and wantonnesse, by the which the goods of an housholde are vnprofitably spent. Solomon doeth shewe it, when he addeth, But hee that feedeth, &c. Wherein he sheweth rightly vn∣to children, that if they wil keepe the lawe wel, that is to say, the do∣ctrine that is giuen them by their godly wise parentes, & wil them∣selues also bee wise, that they ought to bee contented to liue sober∣ly in their house, without desiring the company of gluttons and drunkardes, for to spende excessiiuely with them: for if they feede gluttons, so much as lyeth in them, they shewe that their fathers & mothers neuer made any account to teach them: and so they doe dishonour vnto their parents and make them ashamed. This that is saide of fathers and sonnes, may wel bee applied vnto superiours and subiectes. 8 Hee that increaseth his riches by vsury, and interest, ga∣thereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore. Riches are the good creatures of God, and to get them and pos∣sesse them is lawful: but al wayes and meanes to come by them are not lawful, because that God doeth blame, forbid, and condemne them, for that, that in following them we do distrust the prouidence of the Lorde, and wounde the charitie of our neighbour, not hel∣ping him in his necessitie, but rather bringing him to more pouertie: Ezo. 22. 25. Leut. 25. 35. 36. 37. Deut. 23. 19 as they do which lend their money to their poore neighbors vpō v∣sury, against the commandement of God. And therefore, if wee wil righteously get goods, & possesse them lawefully, let vs beware wee oppresse not our poore neighbors with vsurie and ouer plus, in taking profit of them for the money or other goods that wee haue lent them: but let vs folowe the doctrine of Iesus Christ. Thus do∣ing, Mat. 5. 42. Luk. 6. 34. 35. Psal. 15. 5 Eze. 18. 8. 13 wee shalbe blessed, following righteousnesse: and doing contra¦rily, wee are wicked and accursed. Neuerthelesse when Solomon saith, Hee that increaseth his riches, &c. It may seeme at the first fight that he alloweth vsury, and that he praiseth and commendeth
him who by vsury and increase doeth augment his riches: seeing it is a meane and instrument by the which hee that is merciful get∣teth wherewith to giue almes vnto the poore: the which is a very Oseas. 6. 6. Mat. 12. 7. Heb. 13. 16. acceptable seruice vnto God. To this same wee may answere in two sortes: first of al, that God often vseth wicked instruments for to acomplishe a good work: as for to sende Ioseph into Egypt, that hee might bee gouernour of the countrie, and might susteine his father and his brethren in the time of famine, hee vsed his bre∣thre, Geu. 37. 27. 28. & 45. 5. who were wicked instruments, miserably selling their bro∣ther Ioseph. And when God pleased to chasten his people, hee stirred vp wicked and vngodly enimies of true religion: as Pharao, the Assyrians, and Babylonians, and other nations. When it pleased him to deliuer vs from tyranny of the Diuel by Iesus Christe, hee stirred vp against him, the Scribes, Sacrificers, and Pharisees, and Iu∣das, who desired nothing but to sheede innocent blood. And so the vsurers are wicked instrumentes, whereby God gathereth riches, for to distribute them afterwardes in almes deedes vnto the poore by merciful men. But for al this, the vsurers are neuer the more iustified, either before God, or before men that rightly vnderstande the trueth. It happeneth then by the prouidence of God that the riches euil gotten are afterwardes by other meanes imployed: and yet for al that they that haue geathered them, are neuer the better: for in gathering them they haue laboured to hurt their neighbors: and in keeping them, they haue (so much as in them laye) fa∣mished and starued the poore. The seconde, seeing that it is not lawful for to doe euil, that good may come thereof, let vs knowe that the holy Ghoste, for to allowe and commende a lawful & good woorke, doeth not respect what proceedeth thereof, though it bee good & profitable: otherwise hee should allow al the euils that are doone against his faithful seruantes. For wee knowe Rom. 8. 28. that al thinges worke together for the best vntoo them that loue GOD, euen to them that are called of his purpose: and so the most wicked should be iustified before GOD: the which we must neither thinke nor say: but for to alowe a lawefull and good worke, the holy Ghoste respecteth the wil and minde of him that hath done it: to wit, if that his minde were set wholy to
followe that which God teacheth him by his woorde, after the which all our woorkes shoulde bee ruled. Otherwise, what good∣nesse soeuer proceedeth thereof, and what fayre colour soeuer they haue, yet are they wicked and abhominable. Notwithstan∣ding let vs note, that it is not euil done to augment our riches, pro∣uided that wee doe no wrong to any man, and that we oppresse not the poore, but that wee gouerne ourselues towardes our neigh∣bours, as wee woulde that they shoulde gouerne themselues to∣wardes vs, as if we were in their place and state, and they in ours: as Iesus Christ doeth admonishe vs. And wee must take good heede Mat. 7. 12. from following the opinion of those which say, that they doe no wrong vnto their neighbours, when they woulde gladly receiue and take money at the price that they giue it to their neighbours: for Iesus Christ speaketh of a minde wel gouerned by vnfayned loue. 9 He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, e∣uen his prayer shalbe abhominable. For to serue God as we ought, it is not ynough, to heare that which hee teacheth vs, but also we must giue our heartes theretoo, Psal. 50. 14. 15 & 145. 18. 19 Mat. 7. 21. and with a right affection set ourselues to conforme our manners vnto his word, for to obey him: and in this wise we shal please him, and he wil heare our prayers. But for to bee counted rebells before God, and to haue our seruice counted abhominable, there needeth not but the turning away of our eares from hearing of the doctrine which he presenteth and offreth vnto vs: as Solomon doeth wel sig∣nifie, saying, He that turneth away his eare, &c. For he straightly comman∣deth vs to heare his worde, and hath in al times ordeined ministers thereof. And also whosoeuer despyseth to heare the doctrine, doeth fall to al disobedience and rebellion: and as hee detesteth all honestie and vertue, euen so doeth God abhorre al the seruice that such a contemner doth offer vnto him, howe faire and holy soeuer it appeare. And thus al the seruice that the Papistes doe call diuine, is nothing but filthinesse and stinking puddle. Wee must therefore bee carefull to heare the doctrine, that wee
man obtaine faith, which is the true foundation of our prayers. As except wee haue faith, beeing assured that God doeth loue vs, Rom. 10. 17. and wil giue vs whatsoeuer wee require, so farre as shalbee expe∣dient for our saluation, wee can not with a free heart and earnest minde make our prayers vnto GOD. Euen so can wee not Mat. 21. 22. Iohn. 15. 4. Iames. 1. 6. bee hearde, except wee pray in true faith. And therefore, Iesus Christ doeth admonishe vs to aske in faith, and promiseth vs that wee shal obteine. Wherefore, let vs knowe that the prayer where∣of Solomon speaketh heere, is not properly praier, but crying which proceedeth of no right affection, but onely of hypocrisie, or of feare of tormentes, or of custome, and as if a man woulde acquite a thing, in hope of gaine and profite. With such kinde of cla∣mours poperie is filled. But Solomon doeth cal it prayer, because it hath some shewe thereof, and that the wicked doe so cal it, &c. For also true prayer is neuer abhomination before God, seeing that it is the principal seruice that wee can doe vnto God: not that hee hath neede thereof, but forasmuch as calling vpon him in our ne∣cessities, wee hope to receiue al good things of him, and not of any other, confessing that he is the only authour of al good things, and that wee can haue them no where else. And also vnder the in∣uocation of the name of GOD, the scripture comprehendeth al the seruice that wee owe vnto him. Let vs note then that al∣beeit the lawe was not written vntil the time of Moyses, yet in al times there hath beene doctrine, whereunto it behooued to giue Gene. 4. 26. Ioel. 2. 32. Rom. 10. 13. eare, that such as hearde the same, might beleeue in God, and obey him. Otherwise the sacrifice of Abel coulde not haue pleased God, no more then the oblation of Caine. For without faith it is vnpossible to please GOD, Heb. 11. 6. It is not to say that faith must needes bee perfect, for to make our prayers to please God: but it suffiseth vs to folowe the steppes of Cornelius, Actes 10. Furthermore let vs note, that if their prayers which turne from the lawe were abhominable, by a more strong reason then must theirs which turne away from the Gospel, bee much more abhomi∣nable. and they that are such, must looke for wonderful great tor∣mentes. Heb. 10. 29.
13 Hee that causeth the righteous to goe astray by an euill way, shall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright shall inherite good things. By the corruption and malice of our nature we are all blinde and ignorant, and knowe not howe to gouerne ourselues, nor what way wee must holde to walke, and to saue ourselues from dangers, and chiefly from them which leade our soules to destruction. Now albeit that by our transgressions and disobedience wee had wel de∣serued to haue remained in darknesse and blindnesse, and to go vn∣to destruction, yet God hath had mercy on vs, and for to open the eies of our vnderstanding, hee hath giuen vs his worde, the which Psa. 119. 105 serueth vs as a lampe vnto our feete, and a light vnto our steppes: yea it is the way whereby wee must walke, if wee will not erre. And for to doe this wel, the Lorde doeth print the same in our heartes, by his holy spirite, according to his promise. Let vs then Iere. 31. 32. follow the guiding of the holy Ghost, and we shal not wander astray by the euil way of offences & dissolutions, of seditions, of vprores, of doctrines and inuentions of men, nor of other enormities, and shal not fal into the pit of ruine, of destruction, of damnation and e∣ternal death: but walking by the streight way, wee shal come vnto life, wherein wee shal inherite the true blessednesse which neuer shal faile. Nowe as the Lorde of his meere grace doeth giue vs suche a guide, euen so woulde he haue vs direct the blinde, the simple, & ignorant: and that so much as wee possibly can, wee shoulde keepe them from going astray into the euil way. And for to doe the same, let vs exhort them to ascende vp to the hil, following the pro∣phesie Esay. 2. 3. of Esay. Otherwise, if wee giue offence by euil doctrine, or euil conuersation vnto our neighbours, and chiefly to them which are single of heart, & desire to liue sincerely in trueth, iustice & ho∣linesse, wee prepare a pit for them, but we shal fal into it ourselues: as Solomon threateneth, saying, Hee that causeth the righteous to goe astray by an euill way, shal fal into his owne pit, &c. And in this threatening he doth wel shewe vs, that when God hath refourmed our heartes by his
worde, wee must take diligent heede with what people wee walke, and wee must needes flie a company of offendours and dissolute men, whose liues are an euil example. Otherwise, what righteous∣nesse & integritie soeuer there is in vs, yet are we in dāger to be cor∣rupted, and to forsake the good way for to stray by the euil. For al∣so without such companions wee are so weake, that without the of∣fence of other wee doe easily runne astray by an euil way. Beholde Dauid (of whome we say that hee was a righteous and perfect man, seeing that God doeth giue him witnesse, that hee had found a man according to his owne hearte) who by the regarde of his eies went 2. Sam. 11. Luke. 22. 32 Mar. 14. 17. 1. Kin. 11. fouly astray, by the euil way, in committing adulterie and murder. Saint Peter (for whom Iesus Christe had praied, that his faith might not faile) went astray by the euil way in renouncing his maister, by swearing, cursing, and forswering. And Solomon himselfe, who was so wise, was carried into the euil way, by committing whoredome with strange and Heathenishe women, and by committing of ido∣latrie. Nowe albeit that suche going astray is wicked, dangerous, and mortal vnto them which giue offences, and not contented too bee corrupted themselues, labour to corrupt others and to destroy them: albeit (I say) that the going astray of suche men is deadly: as Solomon doth marke it, when he saith, Shall fall into his owne pit: yet is it not deadly vnto the righteous and perfect, to whome God of his grace and goodnesse doeth reueale, giuing faith and repen∣tance, to the end: that in steede of the pit of ruine and destruction, they might obteine the eternal blessednesse which God hath prepa∣red for his children, for their inheritance: as Solomon doth note it, saying, And the vpright shall inherite good thinges. Wherein wee haue first of al to note, that sith that Solomon, against the pit, setteth good thinges, hee speaketh not onely of worldly thinges, which are commō both to the good and euil, and are of no conti∣nuance: but hee speaketh chiefly of the kingdome of heauen, and of euerlasting life. True it is neuerthelesse that the iust & faith∣ful doe inherite the good things of this worlde, and do obteine Psal. 33. 18. 19. & 34. 10 11. & 37. 9 them in such abundance and sufficiencie that they haue enough: and the offendours, castawayes, and dissolute doe often fal euen in this
life, into great miserie: as the Psalmes before alledged doe pro∣nounce it, and as it might bee shewed by diuers examples. In Iere∣mie there are great threatninges against the false Prophetes which Iere. 23. 1. Kin. 18. 4 caused the people to goe astray: and so were foure hundred and fif∣tie false Prophetes slaine. Secondly, that the vpright and perfect are the children of God: otherwise they coulde not inherite this good thing: for the inheritance belongeth vnto the children. Third∣ly, forasmuch as this good thing is an inheritance, therefore it can not be deserued, but is obteined by grace: as also it is by grace that God hath adopted vs for his children. 11 The rich man is wise in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderstanding, can try him. The riches of this worlde are the good creatures of God, and by them in wisdome and prudence, we may and we ought to bring foorth good fruites of loue, pitie, compassion and mercy, in helping with a free heart and readie wil, the poore and needy. And suche fruites are of sweete sauour before God, who desireth mercy, and not sacrifise. And they that are careful to bring them foorth, are very wise and prudent, in the wisedome of the Lorde, but such wisemen are very rare and thinly sowne. As we may see by the great con∣tempt and disdaine that the poore are in, by the negligence, vn∣mercifulnesse, crueltie, rauening & theuery of the rich: who are ne∣uer satisfied, and haue neuer made an end in gathering of riches, but heape vp stil without ceassing: and so doing, they thinke they worke diligently and carefully. For as saith Solomon, The rich man is wise in his owne conceit. He saith expresly, in his owne conceite: for to shew vs that albeit the rich esteeme themselues wise, & that they would be so counted of other, yet are they not such indeede, for God iudgeth thē far otherwise: as we may see it, when he rebu∣keth, threateneth and condemneth such rich men, calling thē fooles theeues, robbers, & murderers, & depriueth thē of the heauēly he∣ritage. Euen so when by the worde of the Lord, we haue learned to despise riches, & to gouerne vs wisely in being contented with that which the Lord shal giue vs, we may try the worldly rich mē & ha∣uing foūd what they are by the worde, to iudge thē fooles. Solomon
doeth declare it so, saying, But the poore that hath vnderstanding, can trie him out. Yet Solomon doeth not simply say, the wise shal try him out: but he saith, The poore that hath vnderstanding. And this commeth because that the poore being in necessitie, is more inclined and hath more occasion to enquire out the riche, and to iudge that they are not suche as they esteeme themselues to bee, when they are voide of pitie and compassion, and vse not their ri∣ches as they ought. But either they locke them too fast (as doe the couetous and vsurers, which are afearde that the earth wil faile them) or els they fat themselues onely as hogges in a stye, or els do spende them in play, in sumptuousnesse and pompes, in superfluities and excesse, in gluttonies and drunkennesse, in whoredome and o∣ther filthinesse, as prodigal persons: and yet neuerthelesse care not a whit for the crie of the poore. He also saith not simply, the poore: For if the poore beee not wise and learned, hee wil desire to bee like vnto the rich: and thus hee shal not try him out for too iudge him to bee other then wise, seeing hee is of the same affe∣ction. Furthermore, let vs knowe that Solomon giuing such wisedome of imagination vnto the riche, doeth priuily denounce their male∣diction: for it is said, Woe be vnto you that are wise in your owne Esay. 5. 21. conceite, and prudent towardes yourselues. Therefore if GOD hath giuen vs riches, let vs not delight in them, as though for them wee were more excellent then other, and as if it were lawful for vs to vse them after the lustes of our fleshe: but let vs humble our¦selues, and behaue ourselues faithfully, knowing that we haue no∣thing but what wee haue receiued, and also that wee haue recei∣ued it as disposers, for to distribute them according to the will of our maister. And therefore, let vs not esteeme and bragge neuer the more for our riches, but let vs followe the admonition of the Apostle Saint Paule, Charge them that are riche in this world, that they bee not high minded, and that they trust not in vncer∣taine 1. Tim. 6. 17 18. 19. riches, but in the liuing God, which giueth vs abundantly all thinges to enioy.
12 When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed. Wee mightily reioyce when we are at ease, and prosper, and come to the ende of our enterprise, and that wee are not gaine saide nor resisted: and for these very causes doe wee reioyce, as experi∣ence teacheth. And therefore when Solomon saith, When the righ∣teous, &c. it is as much as if hee saide, the people feele themselues exceeding happie, and doe much reioyce when the righteous doe prosper and haue such credite and authoritie, that they wil rule qui∣etly, without troubling or molesting their neighbours: then haue wee also matter of reioysing and gladnesse: as also Solomon hath declared the same heere before, when he saith, In the prosperitie of Pro. 11. 10. the righteous, the citie reioyceth. Nowe that wee must so vnderstande this first part of the pre∣sent sentence, the seconde part doeth plainly shewe it, when it is saide, But when the wicked come vp, &c. The which is as if hee saide, when the wicked doe prosper, and haue credite and authori∣tie, euery where they treade vnder feete, and doe greatly vexe their neighbours, and trouble them, greatly extorting, doing wrong and violence, robbing, spoyling, and murthering them. Beholde how the man is tried, or sifted out, in the lifting vp of the wicked. For the ioy that wee haue for the righteous, wee may bring foorth Ioseph the sonne of Iacob, Moses, Iosua, Dauid, Iosias, and Ezekias. And for the trial of the man, when the wicked are raised vp, wee bring foorth Pharao, Saule, Achab, and other wicked ones which trou∣bled the people of Israel. Moreouer, let vs note that Solomon doeth shewe vs that wee ought greatly to desire the prosperitie of the iust, and to pray that God would mainteine them, and not suffer them to bee greeued and vexed. Contrarily, hee sheweth, that wee ought to hinder and to stoppe so muche as wee possibly can, that the wicked may not come into credite and authoritie, to haue power and gouernement: for in their exaltation and lifting vp, the world is troubled and molested, and chiefly those which liue religi∣ously and godly.
13 Hee that hydeth his sinnes, shall not prosper: but hee that confesseth, and forsaketh them, shall haue mercy. Albeit that the hypocrites are wicked and malicious, and are filled with diuers filthinesse and infections, and are very abhomi∣nable before God, yet as if they were righteous and innocent, as if they were pure and cleane, they bragge not onely before men, for to bee counted of them holy and righteous, and to obteine praise and glory before them: for they do the workes which haue a good∣ly Mat. 23. 5. Esay. 58. 1. Luke. 18. 9 shewe of holinesse and religion, to bee seene of men: but also they boast euen before God, as hee complaineth of it by his Prophet Esay. And Iesus Christ doth also declare it vnto vs by the example of the Pharisee. And thus so much as they can, they hide their mis∣deedes, and seeke to be rewarded of God, as though they were wor∣thy of it, and had iustly deserued it. But they shal neuer get or ob∣teine that which they thinke and desire to doe. For, as Solomon saith, Hee that hideth his sinnes, shall not prosper. Caine (as hee thought, and as he woulde faine haue had it) did hide his sinne, say∣ing, Am I my brothers keeper? but hee prospered neuer the more, Gen. 4. 9. seeing he was a runnagate and a vagabond. When Iudas by a kisse betraied the innocent blood, he hid his trespasse: euen so also he prospered not, but did miserably hang himselfe. And so they that thinke to hyde their sinnes from God, shal not prosper, but the curse of the Lorde shal fal vponthem, and shal neuer obteine for∣giuenesse: as neuer had Cain, Saule, and Iudas: and also al their like shal neuer obteine it: for malediction lieth vpon them, which thinke to hide their counsel from the Lorde. Contrarily, if indeede Esay. 29. 15. and truely, wee feele ourselues greeuously faultie before God, if we confesse our sinnes, and that through great displeasure and sorrowe we forsake and turne from them, and aske forgiuenesse thereof of the Lorde, hee wil graunt vs mercy, as he did vnto Dauid, Daniel, Matthew, Peter, Zacheus, and to the publicane, and to the sinful wo∣man, to Mary Magdalin, out of whom Iesus Christ cast seuē Diuels:
euen so wil hee doe to al poore which wil turne vnto him with an vnfeigned hart: as Solomon doth pronoūce it, saiyng, But he that Esay. 55. 6. 7 Eze. 18. 30. 31. 32. confesseth and forsaketh them, &c. Wherevnto agree these pla∣ces of scriptures, Seeke the Lorde, whiles hee may bee founde▪ cal vpon him whiles hee is nigh. Let the vnbeleeuing man forsake his way, and the Lorde wil haue mercy vpon him. Returne you, and re∣pent you for your offences, and your sinne shal not destroy you. Wherein wee see that to obteine pardon & forgiuenesse, it is not enough to confesse ourselues sinners: as Pharao, Saul, and Iudas haue proued it, and felte it: but in confessing of our sinnes, we must leaue them: as did the holy olde fathers: and amongst others Da∣uid, Peter, Matthew and Zacheus. But some wil say that during this life sinne doeth cleaue so fast and vnseparably vnto vs, as wee may wel feele, and as the Apostle Saint Paule doeth wel shewe it, by the complaint hee maketh: and therefore they conclude that wee can∣not Rom. 7 Gala. 5. leaue nor forsake it: and so wee neuer obteine mercy: or for to obteine it, it is not required to forsake sinne, & that it is enough to confesse the same. Wherevnto I answere, Albeit that sinne doeth not forsake vs, yet doe wee leaue it, when wee abhorre and detest it, and that wee suffer it not to reigne in our mortal bodies, Rom. 6. Gala. 5. Ephe. 4. Colo. 3. Rom. 8. 1. but doe folowe what the Apostle Saint Paule doeth teach vs of the mortification of the olde man, and of our earthly members. Thus doing, we forsake sinne, and do obteine mercy. For as saith Saint Paule, There is nowe no condemnation to them that are in Iesus Christe, which walke not after the fleshe, but after the spirite. Be∣sides this, wee haue to note first of all in this woorde to Confesse, that auricular confession hath no foundation in this place. For when Solomon wrote, there was no popishe Priest, but euery man priuately confessed himselfe to GOD, and the people in com∣mon confessed their sinnes, not in numbring them one by one, as the Pope woulde haue vs to doe: the which cannot bee doone seeing also that no man can rehearse the faultes that hee doeth in an how respace. Neuerthelesse I wil not condemne the con∣fession that is made vnto men: for it is necessarie. First of al, if GOD doe aduertise mee of my sinne by men, I must confesse them vnto him, that GOD may bee gloryfied.
As Iosua doeth admonish Acham thereto. And Dauid being admo∣nished by the Prophet Nathan, confessed hee had sinned. Secondly, Iosu. 7. 19. 2. Sam. 12. 13 when wee haue offended our neighbours, for to reconcile vs vntoo them, we must confesse the sinne that we haue doone against them. Thirdly, it is very profitable that wee shoulde open vnto our bre∣thren our imperfections, to the ende that knowing our necessitie, they might bee stirred vp to pray for vs, and that by their prayers, wee may bee holpen: as wee are admonished. Fourthly, let vs Iam. 5. 16 note, that he which forsaketh his sinnes, ought to esteeme himselfe neuer the more for it, but to humble himselfe, and acknowledge that hee forsaketh not his sinnes of himselfe, but because that God hath mercy vpon him, and giueth him true repentance, and the guiding and gouernement of his holy Spirite. Thou hast chastened mee, and Iere. 31. 18. 19. I haue beene as an vntamed calfe. Conuert mee, O Lorde, and I shalbee conuerted. Euen so, Solomon doeth not promise him that hee shal not obteine as hee hath deserued, but that hee shall obteine mercy. Wherein wee ought to learne that wee doe neuer so cleane forsake our sinnes, but that wee bee alwayes stil faultie: otherwise wee shoulde haue no neede of mercy, and shoulde not neede to aske forgiuenesse of our sinnes: but that wee shoulde bee rewarded ac∣cording to our desertes. The which wee neither ought to thinke nor say, except that wee wil be vnthankeful vnto the goodnesse of our God, and renounce his mercy. 14 Blessed is the man that feareth alway: but he that har∣deneth his hearte, shall fall into euill. Wee are often admonished by the holy scripture to feare the Lorde, by admonitions, promises, and examples. Gather the people vnto me, and I wil make them to heare my words, the which they shal learne, that they may feare mee al the dayes of their life, &c. Deut. 4. 10. & 6. 13. & 10. 12. Psal. 22. 24. 25. & 33. 18. & 34. 8. 10. Thou shalt feare the Lorde thy God, and him only shalt thou serue, &c. And now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but onely that thou shouldest feare the Lord thy God, & walk in al his waies? &c. Yee that feare the Lord, praise the Lord: & feare him
al the seede of Israel, &c. But the eye of the Lord is ouer them which feare him, and looke for his goodnesse, &c. The Angel of the Lorde doeth pitch his tentes rounde about them which feare him, and to deliuer them. Yee that are his Saintes, feare him, for they that feare him shal want nothing that is good. As touching examples, we haue the holie Patriarkes and Kinges, the Prophetes and Apostles, which feared the Lord, in distrusting themselues: and also haue done wel. Nowe albeit that in this booke, Solomon hath alreadie at diuers times exhorted vs to feare the Lorde: yet forasmuch as wee neuer thinke thereupon as we ought, and that wee trust too much to ourselues, and that it is most necessarie for vs to walke in feare & trem∣bling, seruing the Lorde, as Dauid doth admonish vs: for this cause Psal. 2. 11. Pro. 14. 16 by promise he doeth exhort vs nowe againe to feare, saying, Blessed is the man that feareth alwayes, &c. Him, that he calleth now bles∣sed, he hath before called wise, saying, The wise man feareth, and departeth from euil. And indeed, he that departeth from euil, doth shewe great wisedome, wherin there is great prosperitie & felicitie. Pro. 3. 13. But he is not contented simply to say, He that feareth, but he addeth, alwayes. Wherein hee sheweth, that wee must perseuer vnto the ende, in the feare of the Lorde: otherwise wee should not woorke out our saluation, but should fal into euil, as Solomon doth declare it, saying, But he that hardeneth his heart, shal fal into euil. That which nowe he calleth, hardening of the heart, he calleth before, is carelesse, saying, But a foole rageth, and is carelesse. Therefore hee that hardeneth his heart, is a foole: whereupon it doeth wel folow, Pro. 14. 16. that he deserueth to fal into euil, as he is nowe threatned. And for∣asmuch as Solomon setteth hardening of heart, and to be carelesse, against fearing, therein he sheweth vs, that for vs righly to feare, we must humble ourselues, and distrust ourselues, and become gentle and easie to be taught, vnder the yoke of the Lorde, confessing that therein is rest, and out thereof is falling and destruction. And whilest we doe thus feare, distrusting ourselues, let vs take good heed from distrusting the helpe of God, or to dout what loue hee beareth vs. In this sort, in fearing and beeing careful and diligent to keepe vs in the obedience of our God, we shal not feare to be forsaken nor re∣iected of our God and Father: for there is no feare in loue: but 1. Ioh. 4. 18
perfect loue casteth out feare, &c. If we beleeue that God loueth vs, his loue is so perfect and accomplished, that when we haue any knowledge thereof, we rest quietly out of feare, neither are trou∣bled with any fearefulnesse. And although we be not altogether ex∣empted from feare, yet doeth it not let that wee should not enioye peace, which we obtaine by fayth, when we haue our refuge vnto God, as vnto a stil and safe harborowe or Hauen from al daunger, of tempestes and perils. Further more let vs note, that as their fe∣licitie which doe alwayes feare, doeth chiefly stande in the remissi∣on of their sinnes, and in eternal life, euen so the euil, whereinto the hardened of heart doe fal, lieth chiefly in this, that hauing hea∣ped sinne vpon sin, they neuer obteine pardon, but are cast downe headlong into eternal death. 15 As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, so is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people. It is knowne that the Lyons and the Beares are wilde and cru∣el beastes: and chiefly when they desire the pray, after they haue bene long without meate, to meete with them is verie dangerous: for if they haue once caught their praye, they teare, and deuoure it, without any remedie: for asmuch as they are mightie, and do pro∣ceede therein with so great violence, that none can deliuer the pray from their pawes or iawes. Euen so the holie scripture willing to declare the crueltie, violence, and power of men, doeth compare Psal. 7. 3. & 17. 12. & 22 22. Esai. 5. 29. 30 them vnto Lyons and Beares. And nowe Solomon compareth the wicked (vnto Lyons and Beares) which haue power & domination, and exercise their crueltie vpon their subiectes, which are so pulled downe, that they can not resist their power, nor deliuer themselues from the oppression of the wicked rulers: and euen so they are as poore sheepe betweene the pawes and teethe of Lyons and Beares. Solomon for to signifie the weakenesse & smal power of poore sub∣iectes, vseth a word in his lauguage, which commeth of a verbe that signifieth to attenuate, or to lessen and to make weake. And saieth expresly, Ouer the poore people, feebled and brought downe, the which is for to taxe the cowardize and slacknesse of the wicked, which dare doe nothing against their equals and like, but doe coun∣terfeit the valiant captaines against those that cannot be reuenged.
We may daily see that wicked rulers wil fauour the wicked, which shalbe amōgst the people, & wil oppresse the poore simple. We need not to go farre of, to seeke examples hereof. It is not long since, that we might haue said to the Citie which did boast herselfe of the re∣formation of the Gospel, that which Esai reprocheth to the Citie of Esai. 21. 22 23. Ierusalem, saying, How is the faithful Citie become an harlot? Shee was ful of equitie, and iustice lodged therein, but nowe they are be∣come murtherers. Now albeit that the wicked rulers are mightie & cruel as Lyons & hungrie Beares, yet as Dauid tooke away the pray 1. Sam. 17. 34. from the Lion and the Beare, and slue them: euen so the wicked ru∣lers cannot alwayes come vnto the ende of their enterprises, and to haue their desires: for the Lions shal suffer want, & be hungerstar∣uen. And this is by the power and might of the Lord, which rayseth the poore, & beateth down & suppresseth the high minded: as haue Psal. 34. 11 Pharao, Saul, Achab, Nabuchodonozer, & many other proued true. Wherfore though the wicked gouernours be cruel & mightie, yet ought we not to stand in feare of them: seeing that the ruler of hea∣uen & earth is on our side, against them: so that we may say, The Lord is mine helper, I wil not feare what man can do vnto me. And though we feare them not, yet must wee not leaue of from obeying them, when they do not turn vs away from the true seruice of God by their oppression & extortions. On the other side, when the ru∣lers Psal. 118. 6. Rom. 13. 1. Pet. 2. are the Lieftenants of God (who is of a pitiful & merciful na∣ture) they ought to be greatly ashamed for degenerating by crueltie from him who hath done them this honour, to communicate his name vnto thē, & insteed to be gētle as lambes, they should become like vnto Lions & Beares. And when as they should trēble for their destruction. For if God doeth giue power vnto his faithful seruantes Psal. 9. 13. Esai. 31. 4. Osee. 11. 10. & 13. 7. 8. to tread the Lion vnder feete, he can also destroy the wicked which become Lions & Beares: for he is the great & mightie Lion: as hee is called by the scripture. Moreouer let vs note, that whē the wicked rulers are compared vnto Lions & Beares, that wee be admonished for to take heed of thē: by a stronger reason then, of that Lion the 1. Pet. 5. 8. Deuil. For these same make no warre but for to get riches, & to take our bodies, but the Deuil seeketh to deuour vs. And thus on al sides, wee are open as a praye: but, for al that, wee must not feare nor bee discouraged, for as muche as we haue the Al∣mightie on our side, who in time conuenient can and wil safely
deliuer vs from al dangers and perils, and to place vs in safetie. 16 A Prince destitute of understanding, is also a great op∣pressour: but he that hateth couetousnesse, shal pro∣long his dayes. It seemeth vnto the Princes of this word, that they haue no∣thing to doe to labour to learne wisdome, either humane or diuine: and therefore they are blockishe and brutishe, and doe suffer themselues to be transported with a loose bridle, by their lustes and car∣nal affections: but God hath wel shewed them, that they ought not to be so beastly and ignorant, when for to guide his people of Isra∣el, he ordeined Moses, who was instructed in al wisedome of the E∣gyptians, and was mightie in doings and sayings: and that for his Act. 7. 22. Exo. 18. 21. Deut. 17. 18 19. 20. better instruction, and to make him more wise, hee gaue him his lawe, his statues, and ordinances. He also hath shewed them by Iethro, when he saide, And doe thou prouide amongst the people men of strength, fearing God, & true, & place them ouer the multi∣tude. Thirdly, he sheweth it, when he willed the King to write out a booke of the lawe for himselfe. Fourthly, when he hath placed so many wise Kings ouer his people: as Dauid, Solomō, Iosaphat, Iosi∣as, Psal. 2. & 82 Esai. 1. & 3. & 56. and Ezekias. Furthermore, he doth shewe it by diuers admoniti∣ons that he pronounceth against them. It is therefore a most wicked thing, that the Princes and rulers of the earth, should bee voide of wisedome and vnderstanding, and it is also verie hurtful and dange∣rous: as their subiectes doe prooue it by experience. For how great desire soeuer they haue, to get wherewith to furnishe out their easie liuing, and to mainteine themselues long in credite, authoritie, and power, and to doe al thinges after their desire, yet doe they oppresse the people by extortions. Solomon doeth pronounce it so, saying, A Prince destitute of vnderstanding, &c. When he is not con∣tented to say destitute of vnderstanding, but in the plural number, saieth, Of vnderstandings: hee sheweth that it is not enough for Princes to be wise, gentle, and prudent, after the iudgement of the flesh, but that they must be verie diligent to heare the word of God, the which is our wisedome and prudence. And that they doe com∣mit extortions, of couetousnesse of getting. Solomon doeth shewe
it when hee setteth the hatred of couetousnesse against extortions, saying, But he that hateth couetousnesse, &c. Hee sheweth also that the fruites of couetousnesse are extortions, & that they which doe them, are couetous, though they doe excessiuely wast the riches that they rauishe. He sheweth also that they which are giuen vnto extortions, are of no long continuance, when he affirmeth, that hee which hateth couetousnesse, shal prolong his dayes. The which is true. For albeit that after mans iudgement, it seemeth that the op∣pressours and rauishers doe liue long, yet forasmuche as when they thinke least, and rather then they woulde, they are taken out of this worlde, they doe not prolong their dayes. But though they which hate couetousnesse, should decease this life in the flower of their age, yet forasmuch as they despise the worlde, and aspire vnto the heauenly riches, they content themselues with suche number of dayes as it pleaseth God to giue them, and had rather to dye then to liue: and thus they prolong their dayes: for also they obteyne eternal dayes: and contrarily the couetous which worke extortions, doe perish eternally. And before their ende it often happeneth, that they which doe extortions are hated, and meete with many euil thinges which shorten their dayes, after mans iudgement. Contra∣rily, they which hating couetousnesse, doe no extortions, but vse gentlenesse and liberalitie, are loued: and therefore they are preser∣ued and saued, so much as may be. The Princes here then, are admo∣nished to giue themselues vnto wisedome and prudence, and ther∣by to flye auarice. For so farre is it of, that wee shoulde prolong our dayes by couetousnesse, that rather thereby we are destroyed. For, Pro. 15. 27. as we haue seene, the couetous of gaine, doth trouble his houshold. Hereunto we may adde, that which is treated of in 12. Chapter of Saint Luke, and 1, Tim. 6. & Iames. 5. 17 A man that doeth violence against the blood of a per∣son, shal fly vnto the graue, & they shal not stay him. Violence against the blood of a person, is done in diuers sorts. First of al, in killing of our neighbour, as Cain slue his brother A-bel: and as the infidels and Idolaters doe, persecuting and burning Gen. 4. 8. the poore innocents. Secondly, in dooing some wrong vnto our
neighbour: as did the sonnes of Iacob, selling their brother Ioseph vnto the Israelites. They wrought violēce against his blood: as they Gen. 34. 28 & 42. 21. 22. afterwardes confessed it. As Iudas betraying the innocent blood, and as doe al those which fayning to knowe the trueth, doe betraye the poore faithful. Thirdly, violence is done to the blood, by thefts, rauenings, exactions, and extortions: as did the greatmen of Ieru∣salem, and the common people of Iuda & Israel, towards the poore Esai. 1. & 59 Eze. 22. 17 Miche. 3. 9 10. 11. & 7 2. and feeble: euen as the Prophets doe reproch them for it. Fourthly, violence is done vnto the blood, when we doe not our duetie in hel∣ping the needinesse of the poore. For after wee are destitute of loue, there is nothing but hatred, which is counted murther. Nowe after which of these foresaid maners soeuer we do violēce vnto the blood, we think to make our profit, and to take our ease, and to be in credit and authoritie, and out of danger. And indeede whilest God doeth dissemble and patiently giue the looking on, the wicked beare the sway, doe flourishe and prosper in the outwarde apparance: and therefore euerie man is at their commandement, & they are main∣teined as if they were honest men: and it seemeth that they should neuer perishe, nor bee destitute of people to mainteine or supporte them, but though he tarrie, yet must they themselues (as they tend to destroy other) fal headlong into destruction, without hauing a∣ny man to giue them succour for to keepe them from it. Solomon doeth threaten them there with, when he saith, A man that doeth violence, &c. And for to shewe that they shal not auoide destruc∣tion, he maketh them like vnto them which flye and can not be kept backe, and also finde no man to pul them backe, if they meete with a pit, they fal therin. In the number of such people we may place Pha∣rao, which perished in the sea: Saul, who slue himselfe with his own sword: Absolom, who remayned hanging by the heare of his head: Iudas, who hung himselfe. These haue done violence against the blood: and also they hasted to their destruction, without that any man hath preserued them. We may here place the conspirators of this Citie, which had earnestly determined (as they thought) to haue done violence against the blood: but by the iust vengeance of God, they haue of themselues run vnto the pit, and could finde no helpe to profite them.
18 He that walketh vprightly, shalbe saued: but he that is froward in his wayes, shal once fal. The worldlings and carnal men haue in their heart and mouth this diuelishe prouerbe, Hee that becommeth a sheepe, maketh him¦selfe a praye for the Wolfe: and therfore they gouerne themselues in al vngentlenesse, violence & crueltie, for to mainteine themselues not onely against them which labour to do them wrong, and to be reuenged of them, but also to oppresse the simple, feeble, and inno∣centes. And indeede, they make them to suffer much: as experience teacheth: and also the innocents do complaine therof. And euen be∣cause of the infirmitie of their flesh, they think that God maketh no Psal. 10. 1. 2 & 17. 8. & 44. 10. 23. Psal. 37. 73 account of them, therefore they are tempted with the prosperitie of the wicked. But albeit, that the faithful feele strong afflictions, and that euen vnder the same they dye, yet do they not perish: for God doth strengthen them and susteine them, giuing them patience and constancie, and verie often breaketh the enterprises of the wicked, and deliuereth his faithful from their oppression & violence, & thus he saueth them: as the Patriarks, Moses, the people of Israel, the Pro∣phets & Apostles, & some good Kings, as Dauid & Ezekias. After the same experience Solomon pronounceth, that hee that walketh vprightly, shalbe saued. But the principal part of saluation lyeth not in that which is saide, but in the remission of our sins, & in the pos∣session of the crowne of immortalitie, the which they that walk vp∣rightly & innocently, & in the same suffer temptation. Contrarily, Iam. 1. 12. Mat. 5. 10 albeit that the wicked which liue disorderly in al wickednesse, doe flourish & prosper for a time: yet at the last, they fal sodeinly to de∣struction: as many wicked haue felt by experience: To wit, Pharao, Saul, Absolō, & Iudas. And according to the same experiēce, Solomō addeth, But he that is froward in his wayes, shal once fal. As also, they which haue conspired to destroy the Church of God haue felt. But the principal part of their fal, lieth in the hardening of thēselues in their frowardnesse, they are not only contented to do frowardly in one sort, but run vnto many wickednesses: as Solomon doth note it in his tongue, when hee saith not singularly, hee that is frowarde in his waye: but in the plurall number, Hee that is frowarde
in his wayes. And thus hardening themselues, they obtaine not re∣mission of their sinnes, but perish in them, & go vnto eternal death. 19 He that tilleth his land shalbe satisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, shalbe filled with pouertie. Solomon knew wel enough, that God had not created man to be as a stone, or some other vnmooueable thing, but to the end that he should spend the time about some good work. He knew also that man, because of his corruption & vitious nature, is much more en∣clined to cease from wel doing, then to occupie himselfe faithfully. And in this sort, rebelling against the ordinance of his Creator, hee wel deserued to bee depriued of the vse of the good creatures that God had giuen him from the beginning of his creation, and to be brought to great necessitie. And therfore, hauing compassion of his neighbours, he doth admonish them to labour, & to be occupied a∣boutsome worke: and doeth the same sometimes in threatning the idle and slouthful, & sometimes in making large promises vnto the careful and diligent: as we haue alreadie verie often seene. But be∣cause we are deafe, & wil not vouchsafe to occupie ourselues about that which we ought, Solomon is not cōtented with the former ad∣monitions & promises, but to stir vs vp the more, he setteth downe here word for word the promise that hee hath made heretofore, say∣ing, He that tilleth his land, shalbe satisfied with bread. Wherun∣to Pro. 12. 11 he addeth a threatning agreeable to the same, out of the 6. Chap∣ter, when he saith, He that foloweth the idle, shalbe filled with po∣uertie. As touching the promise, it hath bin handled alreadie, & con∣cerning the threatning, it hath bin also explicated & expounded. But besides that which hath bin said, we haue to note, that Solomō com∣pareth Pro. 12. 11. Pro. 6. 6. pouertie, vnto meat, & that very fitly: for as whē a man hath abūdantly filled his belly with meat, he is grieued & pained: euen so, whē a man hath long fasted, it greatly troubleth & vexeth him. Now sithēs we wil not be filled with such meat, which is nothing but po∣uertie, sorow, & famine, euen a bitter death, let vs take heede we fo∣low not the slouthful, but diligently to apply ourselues to doe our worke, according as we are called of God. Thus doing, we shal haue want of nothing that is necessarie for vs.
20 A faythfull man shall abound in blessings: and hee that maketh hast to be rich, shall not be innocent. The worlde is filled with falshood, vntrothe, deceites, lyes, ra∣uishinges and euill trades, as it is both heard and seene indeedes and wordes, in such wise, that it is not certainly well known whom a man may trust. For this cause also the holy scripture maketh great complaintes of such wickednesses, and condemneth all the world: and amongst other places it is sayd, The earth is filled with wronges Gene. 6. 13. Psal. 12. 2. 3 & 114. 1. 2. 3 Rom. 3. 4. Esay. 59. and extortion. And also it is said, that God is true, and euery man a lyar. And if Esay made so great complaintes for the vntroth of the people of God, must we not thinke that there where God was not preached, all was much more gone astray? And indeede, if God of his grace did not except some from the common condition of men, there should be none righteous, true nor faythfull: for we are all of one nature corrupted and defiled. And thus, so long as the cor∣ruption of the world lasteth, it is saide that Noe was a man iust and Gene. 6. 9. perfect, we must vnderstand he was so, not of himselfe, but because that he found fauour before the Lord. Likewise whatsoeuer fayth, croath, veritie and righteousnes was in Abraham and other Patri∣arkes, in Moyses and other Prophets, in Dauid and in other most holy kinges, in the Apostles and other holy seruauntes of God, the same came of the mercie he had on them, and regenerated them, and Ephes. 1. sanctified them by his holy spirite, for to separate them from the corruptions of this world. And therefore, when Solomon saieth, A faythfull man shall abound, &c. Let vs not imagine that there may bee found in all the world a man that is faythfull of himselfe: but let vs confesse that it hath pleased God of his meere mercie, e∣ternally to electe whome hee would, whome also afterwardes hee Ephe. 1. would call by his worde, that hee might bring them to righ∣teousnesse and innocencie of lyfe in Iesus Christ. And therefore, if the faythfull man doe abounde in bles∣singes, that is to say, if GOD doe endowe him with his gra∣ces and giftes, if hee giue vnto him abundaunce of wealth, if
he giue him rest and peace, if he place him in glory and in honour a∣mongst his neighbours: to be shorte, if althings come to passe as he woulde haue it, and that hee wanteth nothing: and that which is much more worth, if God giue him witnesse by his spirite that hee is of the number of his children, and inheritours of those number to whome Iesus Christ wil say, Come ye blessed children of my fa∣ther, Mat. 25. 34. possesse the kingdome which was prepared for you from the beginning of the world: yet this is not to say, that he doth deserue by his faythfulnesse. But as he is faythful by grace, euen so by grace doth he abounde in blessings: for also God should haue no neede to promise vs blessings, if we coulde deserue them. Now forasmuch as there is none of vs, but woulde gladly enioy the foresaide blessings, let vs therefore vnderstande that Solomon promising them vnto the faythful, true, vpright, and perfect man, doeth labour to bring vs to abhorre lying, falshoode, vnfaithfulnesse, deceites, and wicked trades, and doeth exhorte vs vnto faithfulnesse, trueth, integritie, and vprightnesse, for to walke honestly with our neighbours, as we ought to doe, without labouring to bee riche to their hurte and hinderance. Otherwise in steede of obtayning the former bles∣sings, and promises in the lawe, the curses shal fal vpon vs: as Solo∣mon Deut. 28. doeth wel signifie briefly, saying, And hee that maketh hast to bee riche, &c. Hee saieth not, which is riche: for albeeit that for the greatest parte, the riche are cursed and depriued of the kingdom of God, because they trust in their riches, and are not stayed vppon the prouidence of the Lorde, and because they fil themselues, and haue their comforte, and care nothing at all for the affliction of the poore, and passe not to feede the hungry soule: and also because they rise vp and waxe proude, despysing the little ones, and so much as they can, doe treade them vnder feete, and that worst is, not ca∣ring for God nor his woorde, but blaspheming his holy name, and by their violences and oppressions, cause him to be blasphemed, yee the riches are the good creatures of God, and the riche men that vse them wel, are blessed of God: as Abraham, Isaack, Iacob, Iob, and the good kings of the people of God. But hee saieth, that maketh hast, which is transported by his vnbrydeled concupiscences and affections, and burneth with couetousnes, & runneth about in such wise that he careth not what he doeth, be it good or euil, be it wrōg
or right, prouided that hee can soone bee riche. Such a man wil hold neither fayth nor trueth, and therefore hee shal not abounde in blessings: but forasmuch as hee serueth strange Gods, setting his hearte vpon riches, and turning his hearte from God, and that a∣gainstloue hee proceedeth against his neighbours by vnlawefull meanes, to enriche himselfe and to make them poore, hee shalbee accursed: as Solomon doeth signifie, saying, that he shal not be in∣nocent. And it is according to the manner of speaking of the scrip∣ture, the which threatening the wicked with malediction and pu∣nishement, saith, that they shal not bee innocent. True it is that the Exo. 20. 7. Deut. 5. Ier. 25. 29. & 40. 12. Nehe. 1. 3. Luke. 16. 1. Tim. 6. 9. 10 1. Tim. 6. 17. chiefest paine for such riches, standeth in eternal death: as the riche glutton and Iudas the traytour doe feele: but in abyding such con∣fusion, they feele greate sorrowes in this world: as Saint Paule doth shewe it. Nowe to the ende that wee may bee exempted from such sorowes, let vs flye couetousnesse: and if wee haue abundance of those worldly riches, let vs possesse them as wee possessed them not. And that wee may wel doe the same, let vs obey the lesson that Saint Paule teacheth the riche. 21 To haue respect of persons, is not good: for such a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully. Hee saith, that God is no acceptour of persons. S. Peter spea∣keth thus after Moyses and the Prophetes. And because that the su∣periours Act. 10. 34. 35 and gouernours of the earth haue the preheminence and power from God, whose lieftenants (as it were) they are, and euen Exo. 23. 3. Leui. 19. 15. Deu. 1. 16. & 17. 2. Chro. 19. 6 7. Prou. 24. 23. are called Gods, they are often admonished in the scripture not to haue respect of persons, but to bee folowers of the most highest. Solomon in folowing such doctrine hath said, it is not good to haue respect of any person in iudgement. But albeit that the superi∣ours of the earth are so often admonished of their duetie, and threatened with destruction and damnation for their disloyalty & vnfaithfulnes, notwithstanding it is seene that almost euery where the fauour & respect of persons taketh place, and iudgement is giuē in respect of persons, and that the one is borne vp to oppresse the o∣ther, that wrong is done to him that hath the right, & right to him
that hath the wrong, that the wicked is cleared, and the iust and in∣nocent blamed & condēned. For this cause Solomon is not conten∣ted with the admonition that he hath made heretofore, but to stirre vp and awaken the superiours of the earth, to rule them, or to make them vnexcusable and more guiltie, he doth admonish them againe saying, To haue respect of persons is not good, &c. For to do shame vnto their superiours, and to shew them their filthines, hee com∣pareth them vnto knaues and varlets, who for a morsell of bread, or messe of pottage, or other thing of small price, will doe, or take in hand to doe whatsoeuer a man would haue, when hee saieth, for such a man, for a peece of bread, &c. And indeede it is a thing ve∣ry dishonest and fowle, that they whome God hath placed in seate, and doeth so much honour vnto them, as to call them Gods, should fall into the order of the most vile and abiectes of the world, and should become knaues and villaines. It is not to say, that they which haue respect of faces, in iudgement are cōtented with the of∣fering of a peece of bread: we will giue so much to a dog: but by a peece of bread Solomon doeth signifie great presentes and giftes that are giuen vnto Gouernours, Iudges and Magistrates, for to cor∣rupt them, and to cause them to giue wrong iudgement: And doeth shew thē, that it is no great matter, nor of any great profit, for to take gifts, and that if they had a noble heart, right & perfect, they would in no wise take giftes, how great and excellent so euer they were, no more then a varlet, which feeleth not himselfe an hungred, woulde not gladly receiue an almes of bread, but would haue a peece of mo∣ney: and euen so a daintie curre being vsed to the greasie kitchen, will not care for a peece of bread. And thus the wicked superiours are heere compared vnto hungry dogges, which cannot bee fil∣led. Esa. 56. 10. 11 22 A man with a wicked eie hasteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that shall come vpon him. An enuious man is vexed, when he seeth that his neighbours do prosper, and he that is not stayed vpon the prouidence of God, fea∣reth that he shall not be soone enough rich. For this cause both the one and the other do poste hither and thither to get riches, so much
are they caried away with sinister and euil affection, the which So∣lomon doeth signifie by a wicked eye, saying, A man with a wicked eye, &c. It is not needful to expounde what it meaneth, to haste af∣ter riches: for it hath beene expounded heere before in the 20. vers. and also it may be vnderstoode by that which hath beene saide at the beginning: but wee must note that it seemeth to them which haste both by enuie and by distrust, that if they can gather riches, that they shal neuer want. Solomon doeth pronounce it so, saying, and knoweth not the pouertie shal come vpon him. He speaketh af∣ter the opinion of those which haste to bee riche, and yet for all that hee threateneth them with pouertie, and declareth vnto them that their actiuitie shal not exempt them from want: as wee dayly see the experience thereof: and this commeth because that God blow∣eth vpon the riches of such men, & their riches consume as smoke: and S. Paule doeth note it well, when hee attributeth vncertaintie 1. Tim. 6. 17. Psa. 34. 10. 11. vnto riches. And this is according to the scripture, which doeth at∣tribute vanitie vnto the riches of this worlde. And thus we are ad∣monished to clense our eyes, and not to set our heartes vpon world∣ly riches, that wee bee not tempted to rauish the substance of other men, but rather that by loue wee shoulde bee enclined vnto libera∣litie: and wee may assure ourselues that wee shal neuer want. More∣ouer let vs note that the worlde esteemeth such men for honest, of good wit and vnderstanding, that can quickly become riche, and doeth reuerence them, but the holy Ghost pronounceth that they are filled with enuie and falshood, the which doeth blinde them, & feede them with vaine trust: as they shal feele, chiefly when they are Luke. 16. 19. with the richeglutton. 23 Hee that rebuketh a man, shall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue. Those that are feeble and needie, or that are not contented with their state, desire to make their gaine at them that are great & riche, and seeke by al meanes for to obtaine good wil, and to get the fa∣uour of those which may raise their state. And amongest other meanes they vse to flatter, knowing that such woordes are pleasant
and acceptable in the eares of such as are delicate, boasters and proude, which seeke after nothing but the praise of men, and would be exalted as high or rather more high then God. But they which walke in the feare of God, and in al humblenesse, doe confesse, that they haue neede to bee admonished, yea corrected and rebuked, and not flattered, but rather are thankeful to them, which are seuere & sharpe. As Dauid did receiue the reprehention of Nathan with all humblenesse: as also Ezekias did patiently heare the threateninges of the Prophete Esay. They then that feare God, which are wise & 2. Sam. 11. 2. Kings. 20. humble: are not troubled when they bee rebuked, but rather ho∣nour them which rebuke them, wil gladly heare them, and followe their counselles. It commeth to passe also that euen they themselues which loue to bee flattered, thinke not wel of themselues for ha∣uing giuen eare to flatterers, and at last come to knowe that they which rebuked them, spake the trueth, and that for their profite: and therefore at length they detest the flatterers, and do loue them that are sharp and seuere. And this is it which Solomon pronounceth, when he saith, Psal. 141. 4. 5 Hee that rebuketh a man, &c. Dauid doeth well shewe vs, that they which rebuke vs, ought to be best welcome, saying, In∣clyne not my heart to euil, that I shoulde commit wicked woorkes with men that worke iniquitie: and let mee not eate of their deli∣cates, let the righteous smite mee: for that is a benefite, &c. Let vs then learne, not to resist, nor despite them, which reprooue vs, but rather let vs giue them thankes, and to loue and reuerence thē: for in rebuking vs, they seeke not our hurte, but they seeke our bene∣fite, our honour and saluation: where they which dissemble to see Eccle. 6. Pro. 15. 5. 12 31. 32. & 19. 20. 25. our faultes, care not though wee goe to destruction. Let vs learne this same of this sentence. To this purpose it is saide: It is better to heare the rebukes of the wise, then the song of fooles, &c. If wee passe not after this sorte to abase and to humble ourselues, wee shewe that wee are fooles and mockers, wherevpon foloweth de∣struction and damnation. Let vs therefore vnderstande that they which rebuke vs when wee fayle either in woordes or deedes, are organes and instrumentes by whome God wil pull vs backe from death, and bring vs to life.
24 Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and saith, it is notransgression, is the companion of a man that destroyeth. The fathers and mothers which gouerne and guide their childrē as it behoueth, are not without great care and great paine: for they desire that their children shoulde profite and prosper, and shoulde chiefly growe in wisedome and discretion: and heerein they beare a great loue vnto their children. For this cause, God not willing that children should be vnthankful towardes their parents doeth com∣mande, Exo. 20. 1▪ Honour thy father and thy mother. This honor stādeth not in words and gestures of the body only, but in reuerence and feare, in obedience, helpe, succour and seruice also: so that the children, for to giue the honor they owe vnto their fathers and mothers, ought to haue such affection towardes them, that they should loue them, commend them, and greatly to feare their displeasure, and to do all thinges in such sorte, that their parents doe suffer no losse, through their faulte: but so much as in them is, they should helpe them to ease, and be altogether at their commaundement. Solomon doeth teach vs briefly, saying, Heare thy Father, who hath begotten thee, &c. The same doeth our Lorde, and S. Paule. Wherefore, Prou. 23. 22 Mat. 15. 3. Mar. 7. 9. Ephe. 6. 1. Col. 3. 20. when in steede that the children are bounde to sustaine Father and Mother, they spoyle them of their wealth, so farre is it of, that they honour them, that they rather vse crueltie, as theeues doe against poore passengers. The theeues will say they are honest men: euen so the children, because they are the heires of their parents, will not thinke they haue offended, though they draw vnto themselues the substance and goodes of their parents: but Solomon doth de∣nie, that they doe well, but saieth that they exercise the transgression of theeues, which lye in waight for to robbe and spoyle such as passe by them, when he saieth: He that robbeth his Father and Mother &c. This sentence might well seeme straunge vnto chil∣dren, which will not obey their Fathers and Mothers, but will bee maisters ouer the goodes of their parents, and spend them at their pleasure, because they thinke themselues to be heires of them. But Solomon doeth handle them very gently, when hee compa∣reth them but vnto theeues: for truely, they are woorse,
seeing they are bounde vnto their fathers and mothers by a double bande, yea threefolde: to wit, for creation, generation and bringing vp: and very theeues wil haue respect to doe no wrong nor violence vnto them of their blood: and to holde their hande, wil goe farre from them, and bee afraide to meete with them. Children then are admonished to preserue the wealth of their fathers and mothers, & in no wise to spoyle them of it: otherwise they shalbe like theeues, and consequently deserue death. 25 He that is of a proude heart, stirreth vp strife: but hee that trusteth in the Lorde▪ shalbe fat. The worldlinges and carnall minded, which desire to prosper & to be riche, and to make their particular profite, bee it to the hurte of another, or otherwise, are led and caried with an ouerboldnesse, arrogancie & proude heart, so that where they esteeme their neigh∣bours to giue them some let, whereby they cannot attaine to their purpose, they are incontinently ready to shewe that they are not fain thearted, but that it is whole right, as it is said. And for to shew the same, they beginne to braule and contende against them which minde them no hurte, and doe dogge them, labouring to destroy them, for to come vnto their purpose and desire, that is, to be fat, and to be at their ease, to the hurt of their neighbors: as did Caine, Pharao, Saule, and other proude heartes: and as wee haue seene it, and do stil see by experience. According to the which Solomon pro∣nounceth, saying, Hee that is of a proude heart, stirreth vp strife. Heereunto a∣greeth S. Iames, from whence commeth strife and debate amongest Iames. 4. 1. you? Is it not heereof, to wit, of your lustes? &c. Nowe that the proude, whose heart is grosse, doe stirre vp strife, thinking to bee fat and to take their ease, Solomon doeth shewe it, when against the same hee addeth, but hee that trusteth in the Lorde, shalbee fat. And also therewith hee sheweth that the highminded do not come to that whereunto they pretende, and obtaine not their desires: for it is asmuch as if hee saide, yee lust, and haue not: yeenuie, and haue indignation, and cannot obtaine: yee fight and warre, and get no∣thing, because yee aske not: but the humble and patient which stirre
vp no strifes to maintaine themselues thereby in prosperitie, and to lyue in wealth, at their ease, but rather suffer to bee spoyled: such humble minded trusting in the Lorde, and depending of his proui∣dence, goodnes and liberallitie, shall abounde in wealth. For the Psal. 10. 11. & 33. 18. 19. & 34. 8. Iere. 17 7. 8. Lorde neuer fayleth them that put their trust in him: as wee see that many Saints haue prooued it true by experience: and also God who neither lieth nor cālye, hath so promised. Moreouer let vs note that the scripture vseth this worde to bee fat, after our manner of speech. For when a man is welthy, we wil say of him he is very fat, or ful. And albeit that fatnes is promised vnto thē that trust in the lord, yet let vs take good heed, from esteeming that our trust may be such that therfore we should deserue to be made fat: but let vs acknow∣ledge that it is the gift of God, proceeding of his meere & pure grace And therefore if wee bee fatte, let vs not abuse the abundance that God giueth vs in dissolutenes and wantonnes, in pompe and excesse in superstitions and ydolatries, as did the children of Israel, as wee may see by the rebukes that Moses giueth them. Let vs note also that to trust in the Lorde, is not to hope in him, and to doe nothing but to be ydle. They which so vse it shalbe made fatte. In trusting in the Lorde we must bestow our time in well dooing, and by the fattning we haue receiued, to fat also the needie and poore, and thus we shal abound. chapter. 11. 24. 25. 26 Hee that trusteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wisedome, shall bee deliue∣red. The gentle hearted doe take great matters in hande, and doe put themselues in hazarde of many dangers, and it commeth of the greate courage they haue, and that they thinke they haue witte and vnderstanding ynough, for to end their matters, and to knowe to a∣uoyde the dangers. When they doe thus, they thinke themselues to be wise and quicke witted, but the holy Ghost pronounceth con∣trarily, saying, He that trusteth in his owne heart, is a foole. Wherein we haue too note, that to trust in our heart, is too make account of our¦selues, and to be gouerned and ruled after our owne fantasie, with∣out
taking heede what ende wee shall come to, and haue, and with∣out knowing whether GOD doeth allowe our enterprise, or not, and if we put ourselues in daunger, whether hee will giue de∣liuerance, or no. Solomon doeth shew it by the Antithesis, attribu∣ting deliueraunce vnto wisdom, when he saieth, But he that wal∣kethin wisdome, shalbe deliuered. Many haue tried it by experiēce, as the Patriarkes, and other Saintes. And albeit, that in mans iudgement and outward apparaunce, the most wise doe perishe, yet doe they not cease to haue deliueraunce: for dying temporally, they are set free, and deliuered from the power and tyranny of sin, death, and the deuill, and are exempted from the torments of hell. For walking in wisdome, we renounce ourselues, and cleaue vnto the guiding of the Lord, as he teacheth vs by his word, which is our wisdome and prudence. 27 He that giueth vnto the poore, shall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, shall haue many curses. There is none that desireth want, nor that wisheth to be poore. And therefore the worldly and carnally minded, for to saue them∣selues from it, and carefully to gather together, and enclose so much wealth, as they can by any meanes possible: and they thinke, that by such meanes they shall auoyde lacke: and indeede, after mans iudgement, it is the best way that a man can take: but the holy Ghost doth teach vs an other meanes, cleane cōtrary to natural re∣son, when he saieth by Solomon, Hee that giueth to the poore. This is much against naturall reason, the which saieth, that we must gather and hold fast, for to auoyde pouertie. She looketh not to that God can and wil doe: she is blinde in the workes of the Lord, and chiefly in those that he worketh according to his free promise: the which notwithstanding are vnfallible: for it is true, He hath pro∣mised Deu. 15. 7. 8. 9 & 24. 19. Deu. 28. blessing to him that giueth vnto the poore: wherevpon it fo∣loweth well, that he shall neuer want. For blessing signifieth aboun∣daunce of riches, and contrarily, cursing signifieth want of riches, miseries, calamities and sorowes. And after this signification, Solo∣mon threatneth the churlish and cruell, the theeues & robbers, the couetous and insatiable throtes, which regard the poore nothing
pittifully, nor haue any compassion of them: he threatneth them, I say, that as they are not mercifull, and suffer the poore to endure many griefes, afflictions, and sorowes, yea and disdaine, and abhor them, and are rather ready to curse them, then to blesse them, and to trouble them, then to maintaine them: euen so shall God gree∣uously punish them, and in diuers manners: as Solomon doeth signifie rightly, when hee is not alone contented to say, that hee which hideth his eies shalbe cursed: but saieth, also, that hee shall haue many curses: that is to say, that he shall suffer many miseries. But his greatest and chiefest wealth, aboundance & fulnesse that he giueth to the poore, standeth not in aboundaunce of earthly bles∣sings, but as he is mercifull, so doeth he obtaine mercie: the which Mat. 5. 7. consisteth in this, that God doeth not impute his sinnes vnto him, but in forgiuing him, doth count him alwaies righteous, and maketh him to perseuer in righteousnes, that hee may continue in vsing li∣beralitie Psal. 112. 2. Cor. 9. Mat. 25. towardes his neighbours. And for the full measure of his felicitie, Iesus Christ counteth the almes done and giuen vnto him¦selfe, that is giuen vnto the poore, and doth promise to recompence it with the kingdom of heauen. Euen so the woorst and greatest curses, that shall fall vpon the churlish and cruell, which care not to shewe mercie to the poore, are not the sorowes that be suffered for want of earthly riches: but because that God imputeth their Deu. 15. 5. Iames. 2. 13. Mat. 15. sinnes vnto them, and condemneth them without mercie. For be∣cause they haue despised the Sonne of God in his members, there∣fore shall they bee sente into the fire, that neuer shall bee quen∣ched. 28 When the wicked ryse vp, a man hideth himselfe: but when they perish, the righteous encrease. They that haue the election and free choyce of placing rulers and gouernours, either in the Church for to preach the worde, and to administer the Sacraments: or in the common wealth for to mini∣ster iustice, in rendring right to him, to whome it appertaineth, in maintaining the good, and punishing the badde, ought diligently to take heede to commit the same to such people, as S. Paule teacheth vs, writing to Timothie and Titus, and Iethro and Moyses.
For if in such offices and authorities we raise vp wicked men, or that they themselues rise vp, vsurping the places and seates, orders and degrees consecrated for to serue God and his people, the good, Exo. 18. 21. Deut. 1. 13. righteous, holy and innocent, knowe not where to become. For so much it wanteth that they may haue audience, for to pronounce that which shalbe true, and to declare what is lawe and right, that rather they are constrained to flye and to hyde themselues, because of the great searching that is made after them. Many holy men haue tryed this true by experience: and amongst other, Moses, Dauid, Eli∣as, and other Prophetes, and the Apostles of our Lord Iesus Christ: who were persecuted from citie to citie, and were not spared, till they were cruelly and shamefully slaine. And as they haue bin vsed, so do the Papistes stil continewe the same against the folowers and such as hold the same trueth preached by the foresaide Prophetes & Apostles. And to leaue the Papists, we know that of late in fresh re∣membrance, there hath beene a company of wicked, which bragged of holding the reformation of the Gospel, which not only haue la∣boured to cause that the good, righteous, innocent and quiet should hide themselues, but also had deuised to destroy them by treason, to the end that they should haue no leysure to hyde themselues. And therefore wee ought to take very good heede, what people we raise vp to the seate of Iustice, least we make thereof a denne of theeues, robbers, spoylers, and murtherers. Solomon doeth admonishe vs heereof, saying, When the wicked rise vp, &c. Wherin we haue to note: first of al, that he speaketh of the wicked in the plural number because the worlde is fall of them: as the scriptures doe complaine thereof. And also, when the wicked rise vp, many cleaue vnto them, and shewe their wickednesse, the which before they helde couered vnder the cloake of hypocrisie, and of feare to be taken: but when they perceiue themselues to be a great company, then are they bold to followe their wicked enterprises, to oppresse and torment the good and innocent, then they thinke none can resist them, nor let them to accomplishe fully their euil wil, as it seemed wel vnto Pha∣rao, vnto Saule, and vnto Achab, to the Scribes and Pharisees, & to al the persecutors of the faythful. Secondly let vs note, that when he speaketh of the good, wise, iust, and innocent, which are not hearde so long as the wicked, and their tyranny beareth rule, and cannot
tell where to hide themselues, so that they are compelled to flye, and not to be seene: he saith not, that men hide themselues: for the number of them is so small in comparison of the wicked, that as we haue already alledged once, the scripture complayneth that there is none righteous, none that vnderstandeth, none that seeketh after God: and therefore he saieth in the singular number, a man hideth himselfe. For as it hath beene saide, the number is very small: And euen so the Preacher concludeth. Now that by the man that hi∣deth Eccle. 7. 2. himselfe, we must vnderstand the small number of the righte∣ous and innocent: Solomon sheweth by the Antithesis he maketh, saying, but when they perish, &c. This is not to say that the de∣struction and perdition of the wicked is cause of the great number of the righteous: for there is none but the grace of God which maketh vs righteous, and that for Iesus Christ his sake, whose righ∣teousnes he imputeth vnto vs: but it is that when we see the wic∣ked are reiected and punished, or otherwise we see their destruction manifest, and that the vertuous and people fearing God, are in au∣thoritie and beare rule, many feare, and abstaine from doing of euill before the world, and also wil doe the workes of the righteous, that they may bee had in good estimation, and auoyde rebuke, shame and punishment. And also the good people which did not appeare, and had no credit during the authoritie of the wicked, and seemed to haue beene cleane gone, come againe into light, are commended and honoured, as they are worthy: they florish and prosper, and liue in peace. Now albeit that we must stoppe and let so much as we can, that the wicked rise not vp, yea euery man in his place, yet it be∣longeth to none, but vnto the Magistrates to punish them, neyther is it lawfull for any man to wish or desire their destruction, but ra∣ther we must pray for their conuersion: except that we see mani∣festly they be obstinate, and past amendment, and are of the num∣ber of the reprobate.
The xxix. Chapter. 1 A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, shal sodainely be destroyed, and cannot be cured. THe doctrine of God, which consi∣steth in commandements, admoni∣tions, exhortations, declarations, corrections, reprehensions and threateninges, is compared vnto a yoake that is bound vpon the necke of oxen. Nowe as there are some oxen which cannot bee tamed, nor made to carie the yoake: euen so is Iere. 5. 5. Mat. 11. 29 the world filled with rebelles which harden their neckes, that is to say, which waxe obstinate against the lawe of God, and against his admonitions, reprehensions & threat∣nings, as wee may see by experience: and the complaintes thereof are contained in the scripture, euen against the people of God. And Deu. 9. 23. 24 as the oxen which refuse to beare the yoake, doe tende vnto death: (for when we see that we can vse them no longer, then we fat them for to kil them) euen so doe the rebelles and indurate which haue neede of the yoake of correction and reprehension, and doe with obstinacie reiect it, doe thinke wel to play the valiant captaines to defende themselues, and to despyte them which correct & reproue them. But God, against whome of set malice they bend themselues, can sodainely destroy them without helpe: as diuers rebelles doe feele it wel: and Solomon doeth pronounce it, saying, A man that hardeneth his necke, &c. And thus we are admo∣nished to bende our necke to the yoake of the Lorde, that is to say, to become gentle and tractable, easie to bee taught and humble, when in his name and by his worde we are exhorted, admonished, corrected, rebuked, and threatened: yea, if we wil bee preserued and Psal. 95. 7. Heb. 3. 7. Acts. 7. 51. exempted from destruction. We are often admonished heereof. Let vs humble ourselues therefore, and become obedient, that it may
not bee reproched vs that we are people vncorrigible: euen as Saint Steuen doeth reproche the Iewes therefore. For sithens wee haue the worde more cleerly and plainly then had the Iewes, we deserue wel to be sodainely destroyed and that without remedie, if we har∣den our neckes against the doctrine. For seeing that it is not of ig∣norance or of infirmitie onely, that wee erre and faile, but doe wil∣fully also resist the holy Ghost: and thus by our sinne wee deserue to bee brused without helpe: and also wee cannot be holpen: for sinne Mat. 12. 31. 32. Heb. 6. 4. & 10. 26. against the holy Ghost cannot bee pardoned: neither also can it bee repented of. Wherefore wee can finde no reconciliation. We haue to note further, that they which take in hande to correct and iudge others, and in the meane while despise that which they themselues doe teache, and also doe as euil, or worse then they whome they reprooue, shal not bee exempted from destruction: as Iesus Christ and Saint Iames doe wel shewe. Saint Paule also doeth attribute Mat. 7. 2. & 23. 4. Iam. 3. 1. Rom. 2. 3. hardnesse of hearte vnto them, and doeth threaten them with de∣struction. Wee might apply this present sentence to this matter, and say, A rebuking man hardharted, &c. But the first exposition is re∣ceiued of al expositours, and is the most meetest: For this cause we wil followe it. Notwithstanding wee may learne, whether we be re∣prooued, or rebuke other, that wee shoulde not harden our necke: that is to say, if wee bee rebuked, that we shoulde yelde ourselues tractable and easie to bee taught, receiuing correction with humi∣litie, feare and obedience: and if wee reprooue other, to bee our¦selues of an vnreproouable conuersation, desiring of God without fayning that hee woulde correct and chasten vs. For albeeit that men finde nothing in vs to bee reprooued, yet can wee not iustifie ourselues before God: for before him none of vs of ourselues are innocent, and hee shal finde but too much to bee rebuked in vs all. 2 When the righteous are in authoritie the people re∣ioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people sighe. There is no people or nation howe ignorant and barbarous soe∣euer
it is, which doeth not desire to floorish and to prosper, to liue at ease and in rest, to reioyce and triumph. And for to obtain such pleasures, we arme and fortifie ourselues, we gather vittalles toge∣ther abundantly, and labour to growe riche mightily: wee seeke friendship and couenantes of them, whom we esteeme most migh∣tie, or the meetest to helpe vs, and saue vs from daunger. And when we are thus armed, we thinke ourselues happy, and are pleased: And therefore we laugh, wee reioyce, we leape, we daunce, we sleepe, wee rest, and make vs good cheere, without caring for any man. The Gene. 6. Mat. 24. 38. Gen. 18. & 19 Eze. 16. 49. Luke. 17. 28. Dan. 5. 1. worlde in the time of Noe lyued after this fashion and manner: e∣uen so, did the Zodomites in the time of Lot: euen so, did the Baby∣lonians in the time of Balthasar. But the end of all these people hath well shewed that they were not happy, in that sorte that no man ought to reioyce therefore: for they miserably perished. And for this cause also Solomon doth shewe vs, wherein chiefly the prospe∣ritie of a nation consisteth, and wherein they ought to reioyce, say∣ing, VVhen the righteous are in authoritie, &c. Hee setteth the ruling or multiplying of the righteous. For the people is neuer more happy, neither ought they at any time more to reioyce, then when the iust doe rule and reigne ouer them, and is gouerned by a multi∣tude of them. It is a very commodious and profitable thing, for a nation, when it wanteth not righteous men, as we may well vnder∣stand it: first of all when God preserued, and deliuered the family of Noe frō the flood, because he was righteous: Not that he had deser∣ued Gen. 7. 1. Gene. 6. 8. & 18. 26. Gene. 41. the same by his righteousnes: for in that that he was righteous, it came of the onely grace of God. Secondly, when God promiseth vnto Abraham to saue Sodome, if there were fiftie righteous ther∣in. Thirdly, the people felt it by experience in the tyme that Ioseph gouerned in Egypt: also vnder the reignes of Dauid, Io∣sias and Ezekias they haue knowne it: and nowe where the righ∣teous doe rule, bee it eyther in the Churche, or in the ciuile pol∣licie, the people are very happy: and so they reioyce. For to reioyce, after this sorte, is to haue the possession of the thinges for the which wee ioy. Contrarily, to lament them (when Solomon addeth,
But when the wicked are in authoritie) it is to be depriued of pro∣sperity, & to be in misery & trouble, & to go vnto ruine & destruc∣tion. Otherwise, the present sentence could not be verified. For the worldly & carnally minded, do not delight that the righteous shold multiply, or haue domination, but they reioyce when the wicked, which are their like, doe growe in number, & beare the authoritie. They cannot taste the prosperitie they haue vnder the reigne of the righteous: euen as the children of Israel, when Dauid, Iosias, Ezeki∣as, & other righteous reigned. As they haue wel shewed, when they confessed not the blessings and graces that God bestowed vpon thē, when such men ruled, and when they triumphed during the reigne of the wicked, as if they had won al. They were accursed, not know∣ing that the wrath of God was kindled against thē, & his vengeance prepared for to destroy them. Let vs therefore vnderstande, that we haue good cause to be glad, when we are ruled by righteous men: for therin God doth shew vs that he loueth vs, fauoureth & main∣teineth vs. And when he giueth vs wicked rulers, we haue cause to sigh and lament, and to confesse that we haue grieuously offended: and therefore, that God reiecteth vs to destroy vs, except wee returne vnto him. Let vs also vnderstande, that the principal of the world are admonished to giue themselues vnto righteousnesse, whereby they handle the wicked rigorously and sharpely, and the good, gently and softly, that their subiectes may liue vnder them in peace, and therein to reioyce, not after the desires of the fleshe, but after God: and that they which haue to ordeine Magistrates, let them diligently and straightly looke of what conuersation they haue bene from their youth, that they bring not in suche wicked men as were Pharao, Saule, Roboam, Achab, and other wicked: vnder whome the people suffered much, as the holie histories doe witnesse. And if in the common wealth and administration of the ciuil pollicie, we ought to be thus careful to choose good men, by a stronger reason then must we haue regard vnto the Ecclesiastical mi∣nistrie, where the gouerning of soules is required, which are farre more precious then the bodie and the goods. For the wicked Pre∣lates, by the tyrannie of their traditions and inuentions, doe greatly torment mens soules, and so do make them to lament and sigh: first of al, in this worlde: secondly, in hel. But the good and faithful
Preachers of the pure truth, do cōfort the children of God, assuring them of their saluation: as they are commaunded to doe. And the people which haue suche Ministers, ought to reioyce: as they are Esai. 4. 1. & 52. 7. admonished to doe. 3 A man that loueth wisedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, wasteth the substance. Solomon hath saide before, that the wise sonne reioyceth the father: and nowe he saieth, A man that loueth. &c. Wherein hee Pro. 10. 1. sheweth, that wisedome is meete for euerie age, and also that olde age exempteth not vs from the duetie that God requireth and com∣mandeth that wee should giue vnto father and mother: the which Solomon doth not now name, yet his intent is not to exclude her: but it is only to auoide prolixitie and tediousnesse. For he laboured to giue vs quicke & short sentences, without any derogation to the commaundements of God. And this is not without cause that hee sheweth not onely vnto children, but also vnto the aged, that suche is their duetie towardes fathers and mothers: to wit, to bee giuen vnto wisedome, to loue him not onely with worde, but with deed, learning thereby to leade an honest, holie, righteous, and vpright conuersation, by the which God may be honoured, and our parents succoured: in such sort that they may reioyce, & haue cause in their children of praising God, and to giue him thankes. For, for the grea∣test part, when men are aged, they persuade themselues that they haue nothing to doe to obey their fathers and mothers, & indeed, they cast off and reiect the fatherly yoke. Some thinke their fathers and mothers liue too long: as did Absolon, who persecuted his fa∣ther 2. Sam. 15. Gen. 9. 22. 4. 8. & 26. 34 35. & 28. 8. 9 to death. Some againe doe scorne their fathers, as old dreamers and doaters: as did Cham vnto his father Noe. Other some worke wickednesse for to grieue and vexe their fathers and mothers: as did Cain, who slue his brother Abel: and as Esau, who tooke wiues for to vexe his father & mother. They that desire the libertie of the fleshe▪ and which by pride & arrogancie do reiect the fatherly yoke, count themselues valiant, and not to be fainte hearted: and doe count them doltes which perseuer and continue in the obedience
of fathers and mothers: but contrarily, the holie Ghost pronoun∣ceth that they are wise, and doe loue wisedome: and so, haue no faint heart, neither are doltes, but strong and valiant: for they can wel tame their carnal and vnbridled lustes. Solomon doeth shew it vs briefly, By louing of wisedome. For whosoeuer loueth wise∣dome, is also againe, loued of her: and shee instructeth him in al knowledge and vnderstanding, and armeth him with counsel & dis∣cretion, with power and constancie, with modestie, sobrietie and temperancie: shee decketh him with chastitie and shamfastnesse. So∣lomon doeth shewe this same, when against louing of wisedome, hee setteth to feede or to entertaine harlots: and against reioycing of the father, he setteth, wasting of the substance, saying, But he that feedeth harlots, &c. Vnder feeding of harlots, hee comprehendeth al maner of vntemperancie: as pompes & sump∣tuousnesse, gluttonies and drunkennesse, daunces and games, and other dissolutenesse, whereby wee are ledde to make excessiue ex∣spenses, and to spoyle muche substance vnprofitablie, and to the hurt of other: the which is not to reioyce him, but rather for to vexe him and to bring him sorowe. Let vs also note, that reioy∣cing of the father, is by wisedome to mainteine him, and to pre∣serue his goods, and to feede him therewith: or if he haue no sub∣stance, that the sonne should learne to bee a wise stewarde of that which hee possesseth, so that hee may helpe the necessitie of his fa∣ther. Solomon had good regarde heereunto, when he saide not, He wasteth the substance of his father: but generally and indefinite∣ly he saith, He wasteth the substance. For where the fathers and mo∣thers want, the children are bounde to bestowe their owne sub∣stance for to succour them. Diuers doe vnderstande by wasting of the substance, the loosing of the goods and waxing poore: as the prodigal sonne. And after this sense, a man doeth reioyce his father, when hee behaueth himselfe honestly in his hoshold, and Luk. 15. that he is contented to spend sparingly, and where it is lawful, ne∣cessarie and profitable. For also fathers and mothers are naturally glad, when they see that their stocke keepeth a good house, and do prosper: and moreouer the fathers and mothers help forward their children so much as they can, to make them grow & prosper: & are
more careful therof, then to teach them the feare of God, and loue towardes their neighbours: the which notwithstanding is the chie∣fest point for to lead them to loue wisedome. Furthermore let vs learne, that if the fathers and mothers wil haue true ioye of their children, they ought to be careful to nourish them, & to bring them vp in the doctrine and learning of the Lorde: as Saint Paule doeth admonishe them thereto. If the Magistrates also wil reioyce of their subiectes, let them not suffer dissolutenesse and wastful spending. Likewise if Ministers wil reioyce of the people that is committed Ephe. 6. 4. vnto them, let them not dissemble their follies. 4 A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, destroyeth it. They that haue kingdomes, rule, and Lordship, that haue cre∣dite, authoritie, and power, that haue administration, preheminence and gouernment in their countries, and ouer any people, doe much desire that their subiectes should not breake foorth and rebel, but to liue peaceablie vnder their iurisdiction, & would that their countrie shoulde flourishe and prosper vnder their obedience. But there are verie fewe Lordes that knowe howe & by what meanes to main∣teine their countrie in such estate. Some thinke that by haughtinesse and pride, by crueltie and oppression they should reigne ouer their subiectes, and hold the countrie in their obedience. Some labour to gather riches and to take of al hands to be wondered at of the peo∣ple because of their great substance, and to the end, that none should dare doe any thing against them: and they thinke that being riche, they haue enough wherewith to reuenge and to defend their coun∣trie against them that woulde inuade and assault the same: and also to tame, and order them, who by rebellions, vprores, seditions and treasons, would reuolt from their obedience & subiection. And in the meane while, they passe not though the weake bee oppressed, as fatherlesse children, widowes & strangers: they neither reuenge, nor mainteine their cause, but are giuen to flatterers, to mealemouthed men, to players, to iesters, and to suche as can make them passe their time merily, and also to them that labour too corrupt them by giftes and by presentes. And so dooing, they will in no wise
yeeld vnto them which in the name of the Lord and by his word do declare, that they ought to do iustice and iudgement. And because that in this maner they are rebels, not to men only, but to God also, who commādeth thē to iudge iustly: for this cause, in steed of main∣teining Exod. 23. 2. Leui. 19. 15. their countrey, they destroy it, For because of their wicked∣nesses, the Lord, who is Iudge of the worlde, whō no man can resist, doth take vengeance of them, spoiling and destroying their country: as in the time of Noe, the earth was corrupted before God, and fil∣led Gen. 6. 11. with extortion: and for this cause, hee destroied the worlde by the flood. In the time of Lot, Sodome thought to defende herselfe with pride, oppression, and other abhominations: but God knew wel enough howe to take vengeance. The children of Israel were defiled with like iniquities, yea, more horrible, as it is reproched vnto Gen. 18. & 19. them by the Prophetes, that they exceeded the abhominations of the Gentiles and Infidels: and amongst other places, they are sharp∣ly rebuked in the 1. Chapter of Esai, and in the 16. Chapter of Eze∣chiel, Eze. 16. and in the 5. Chapter of Ieremie. Euen so could God wel de∣stroy them, as it is seene by the holie histories. Nowe forasmuche as God is righteous, and doeth iudge the worlde, hee wil not therefore spare that people from punishment, wherein there is no iudgement, albeit he seeme to prolong the time, & dissemble the matter. Wher∣fore, let the Lordes & Rulers of the earth, which desire to mainteine their countries, yeelde themselues obedient vnto the lawe of God: let them submit themselues to the Lorde: let them doe iustice and iudgement, in rendring the right to whom it belongeth, and deliue∣ring Deut. 17. 18. Psal. 2, 10. & 82. 3. the poore & weake from the violence of their oppressours. So∣lomon in fewe wordes doeth teach them this same, saying, A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie. Hee sheweth also what people we ought to place in the gouernment of a countrie: and that they which labour by giftes and presents to win the fauour of their Superiors and Magistrates, are deceiued and beguiled: for by suche meanes they thinke to make their profite, but because they labour to hurt their neighbours, and to destroy them, their owne wrong shal light vppon their owne heades: and thus they destroy them∣selues, as they shal one day feele, come it early, come it late. Fur∣thermore, let vs note, that the Kinges, Princes, and Superiours of the earth ought to offer themselues to defende those that are
iniured and oppressed, and to deliuer them: otherwise, they doe no iudgement: and that they which suffer oppression, ought not to reuenge themselues, but to haue their refuge vnto iudgement, and without being ledde with desire of vengeance. For it is not lawful to aske the helpe of superiours for to hurt our neighbours, but to the ende that we may liue in peace, & obteine that which is ours. 5 A man that flattereth his neighbour, spreadeth a nette for his steppes. They that vse sweete and flattering words to their neighbors, and vphold them in whatsoeuer they say, labour by this meanes to be welcome vnto them, & to gaine something by them, not caring whither they doe any pleasure or seruice to them whom they flatter, or is profitable for them: yet neuerthelesse they persuade both them¦selues & them whom they flatter, that whatsoeuer they do and say, flatteringly, they doe, & speake it for their pleasure & seruice. But whē they know wel they lye, they are conuinced in their conscience that they goe about nothing els but to beguile & deceiue thē whom they flatter, euen with a most dangerous deceite, which bringeth death: as Solomon doeth signifie By the nettes that they spread for his steppes whom they flatter. For as the bird that is taken in the net, is in danger of death, euen so, they also which beleeue flatterers, fal into great perils: to wit, either into shame, reproche, and euill name, or into losse of goods or friendes, or losse of life. Our first fa∣ther Adam, beleeuing and obeying the flattering speeches of the de∣uil, fel not onely into reproche and losse of goods, but also hee lost his life: Dalila flattereth Sampson, and spreadeth the nette for him: Iudg. 16. 1. King. 12. for yeelding vnto her demaund, hee could not auoide death. Robo∣am by the flatterie of young men, lost al his kingdome, except a tribe and an halfe. Herode delighting in the flatterie of the people, which cryed, The voice of God, and not of a man: was eaten of wormes. Act. 12. 21. Euen so, we see that flatterers bring great hurt vnto them that wil∣lingly heare them. Therefore we must giue them no entrance with vs, but to reiect them, and abhorre them: and chiefly they that la∣bour to fil their bellies and their purses, doe most destroy the soules
of them which yelde vnto their wordes. Saint Paule doeth admo∣nish vs heereof in diuers places, folowing therein Iesus Christ, Mat. 7. 15. & 16. 6. Rom. 16. 17. 18 Col. 2. 8. who hath very diligently forewarned his Apostles of the same. 6 In the transgression of an euil man is his snare: but the righteous doth sing and reioyce. When the wicked doe giue themselues to thinke or to do euil, it is for to hurte their neighbours, to take them vnprouided and to destroy them, though they be innocent, and neuer thought once to Psal. 31. 5. & 35. 7. & 91. 3. & 119. 110. & 124. 7. & 141. 4. doe them hurte: as there are many complaintes therof in the scrip∣ture, the which compareth often the wicked vnto foulers, hunters & warrenners. And because, that without cause & wrongfully they ymagine the destruction of the innocent, they themselues fall into destruction. And thus whyles the wicked lay and prepare their nets, snares and pitfals for the innocent, they prepare them for them∣selues. Wherefore, when Solomon saith, In the transgression of an euil man is his snare: wee may vn∣derstande that the wicked deuise the destruction of the righteous: and therefore must wee beware of them, and pray vnto the Lorde Psa. 7. 16. 17. & 9. 16. & 35. 8. & 57. 7. that he woulde deliuer vs: and chiefly from them that labour to turne vs away from the true religion, and to depriue vs of the pure seruice of God, and consequently of eternall life: as Dauid maketh diuers requestes for the same. Wee may also vnderstand that Solo∣mon meaneth that there are snares in the transgression of an euill man, because that intending to hurte his neighbours, and to destroy them, hee prepareth snares for himselfe, and is destroyed. These two senses are both true, as wee may see it in the scriptures, and they both agree wel vnto the last parte of this sentence, the which is con∣trary vnto the first, howesoeuer wee take it. For albeeit the wicked are sharpe and earnest in persecuting of the iust, who is weake of himselfe, and can make no resistance, yet the righteous doeth not cease to assure himselfe of the grace of God and of his helpe, de∣fence and protection. Solomon noteth this assurance, by singing & reioycing, when he saith, But the righteous doth sing & reioice. Dauid in his afflictions hath trusted in GOD: as hee witnesseth
in diuers Psalmes. And as he is assured, euen so doeth he exhorte o∣thers Psal. 13. 6. & 18. 2. & 56 11. & 59. 17. Pal. 5. 12. 13. & 9. 10. & 22 23. Exod. 15. Iudg. 4. & 5. Psal. 7. 18. & 58. 11. 12. &. 59. 17. 18. to bee assured. When also the wicked doe perish, the iust for all that doe not loose their hope, but rather sing and are glad. As when Pharao and his people perished in the Sea, Moyses and the children of Israel sange a songue. And wen Sisara with his army was discomfited and vanquished, Debora and Baracke sange a songue of thankesgiuing. This trust or confidence is well set forth in diuers places. Now that we must take this reioycing and singing, it is plaine enough by that which is outwardly and temporally shewed: for after the iudgement of the world, and outward apparaunce, there are no people more sorowfull nor more miserable then the righteous. I say expressely, afore the world: for the righteous are alwaies ioyfull. 2. Cor. 6. 10. 7 The righteous knoweth the cause of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge. For as much as the poore are not able to succour their neigh∣bours, but haue great neede themselues to bee succoured, they are therefore commonly destitute of friendes, though they haue many parentes and kindred. Solomon heretofore, folowing experience, Pro. 14. 20. & 19. 7. Exod. 23. 3. Leui. 19. 15. doeth pronounce it. For this cause, though that God doeth forbid to haue respect of the poore, and to preferre them in their causes, yet would he that wee should take pittie on them, to assist them, to know their matters, to maintaine them in their good right, to de∣fend them, & to deliuer thē from wrong and violence of the vngod∣ly and wicked. But yet no man careth to folowe the will of the Esay. 1. 23. & 3. 12. 13. 14. & 10. 1. 2. Lorde therein, so that we may rightly complaine of the iniquitie that raigneth on all sides in the world, with the Prophet Esay. It is not without cause that I haue said, on all sides of the world: for seeing that the Prophets doe complaine so sore of the people of God, ought we not to vnderstand, that amongst the Idolaters, there were great opressions, and that vnrighteousnes was spread ouer all? And also nowe it is very hard to finde such as haue care to doe right vnto the poore, and that wil know their matters, to doe them right. Albeit, that this hath bin in al times, & is stil manifest enough vnto thē that wil see: yet Solomō entending to shew how much the
poore haue great neede to bee succoured, and howe they want such as shoulde fauour them, doeth marke the foresaide difficultie, when hee saith, The righteous knoweth, &c. Hee hath noted it, I say in two sortes: first of all, forasmuch as he saith, that it is the righteous which knoweth. For it is very harde to finde a iust man: as we haue shewed it heeretofore by the scripture. Secondly, when he saith not, the righteous men doe know, but saith in the singular number, the righteous man knoweth: for to shew the scarcity of such as haue care to doe right vnto the poore, and consequently the difficultie to finde them out. Furthermore, attributing knowledge vnto the righteous, hee sheweth that we haue knowledge enough, if wee bee righteous: for God doeth not leaue them in ignorance, whome hee indueth with righteousnes, and placeth in his seate, for to administer the same: but giueth them knowledge and wisedome, that they may Iob. 29. 16. doe their office. Moreouer he sheweh that the righteous are careful to examine and to enquire: otherwise they coulde not knowe the cause of the poore: seeing the wicked are wittie, and striue so much as they can to giue light and faire shewe vnto their cause, for to darken the right of the poore, that it may bee ouerthrowne. But (as hath beene saide) the righteous that desire to doe iustice with∣out acception of persons, are indued with knowledge and are care¦ful to enquire to the end that whatsouer other go about to darken, the same might bee manifest vnto them. Contrarily, the wicked iudges and Magistrates, which proceede through fauour, by accep∣tion of persons, and by couetousnesse of giftes and presentes, shoulde make no account of enquiring for to know to whom the right belongeth: they will knowe nothing thereof, they close their eies, that they may knowe nothing: and also when they vnderstande it, they vnderstande not that same to iudge iustly, but of set malice doe wrest iudgement. This is that which Solo∣mon doeth expresse vnto vs, saying, But the wicked regardeth not knowledge. And albeit, it is of set malice that the wicked iudges wil not vnderstand to doe well acccording to the duetie of their office, yet the same happeneth not
without the secrete and iust prouidence of God, which blindeth the wise of the worlde, for to punishe the sinnes of a countrie: as Esay. 3. 2. 3 & 29. 14 Esay. 1. 22. 23. & 28. 7 &. 56. 10. hee hath threatened the children of Israel therewith. And as hee hath threatened them therewith, euen so haue they had: as wee may see by the complaints that are in the scripture against the vn∣righteousnesse and oppression which reignedin Iuda and Israel 8 Scornefull men bring a citie into a snare: but wise men turne away wrath. Wee haue proued by experience in al times, and yet doe trye that the kinges and princes, the rulers and superiours of the earth rise vp, and fight one against the other, and labor to destroy houses, castles, villages & to wnes. And they do the same, being led with am∣bition and desire of reigning, to waxe riche, and to be great, orels being mooued with wrath and indignation, with hatred and desire of vengeance. And albeit that men doe such thinges of their owne will and set malice, yet doe they come to passe by the iust iudge∣ment of God, which by such vprores, dissentions and warres doeth punishe the contempt of his worde, reuenge the violences and op∣pressions, the filthinesse and vncleannesse, the offences and dissolu∣tions, the deceite & guile that the mightie of the world commit & the common people, who despise the threatenings that God maketh them by his seruants, scorning at his iudgements, as though they shoulde neuer bee attainted, albeit the examples are set before their face: as the iudgementes that hee hath exercised in the time of Noe by the flood: in the time of Lot, vpon Sodome and Gomor∣rha: in the time of Moses, vpon Pharao and his people, in the time of Dauid vpon Saule: and many times vpon the children of Israel and other wicked scorners: whome wee may reproche with male∣diction. Woe bee to them that drawe wickednesse as it were with Esay. 5. 18. 19 & 28. 14. 15 & 5. 24. & 28. 7. cordes of vanitie, &c. And to declare the punishment of suche as Esay doeth foretel them, saying, As the flame of the fire consumeth the reede, and the flame consumeth the strawe: euen so shall their
roote be like rottennesse: and their budde shal ascende as dust. By the abouesaide examples, and the foresaide reproches and threate∣ninges, we see that scornful men bring a Citie into a snare. For looke howe the destruction of birdes is, when they are taken in the net, or snare: euen so doeth a countrie runne to destruction, when the people thereof is giuen vnto the foresaide scornings: & chiefly when the Rulers and Superiours are infected therewith. For if they scorne God, when hee sendeth them his souldiours for to chasten them, they wil easily also mocke at men: and so they wil kindle them more, and hasten them to make destruction of the countrie: as it is wel prooued by the warres that are raised vp in our time. One Prince doeth scorne an other, and doe so mooue and stirre vp one another, that the one spoileth of the one side, & another of the o∣ther. Contrarily, if through the feare of the Lord, the rulers & supe∣riours of one countrey doe giue themselues vnto wisedome, and that they are careful to cause the people to walke therein, then they shal not snarle the citie, but shall appease and swage the wrath aswel of God, as of his organs and instruments, and shal deliuer the people from perdition. This is that which Solomon pronounceth saying, But wise men turne away wrath. Hereof we haue diuers ex∣amples Exo. 14. 10. & 16. 2. & 17. 2. & 32. 1. Num. 11. 1. & 14. 1. & 16. 46. Eccle. 9. 14. 2. Sam. 20, 16 first of al in Noe, who by his wisdom turned away the wrath of God from his family. Secondly, Ioseph preserued and saued E∣gypt, and the house of his father that they perished not by famine. Thirdly, Moyses did often turne away the wrath of God from the people of Israel. Fourthly it is saide that a little towne, where there were but fewe men within it, was beseeged of a greate king: and there was a poore wise man founde, who saued it by his wisedome, &c. Fifth∣ly, it is saide that a wise woman saued a citie from ouerthrowing by the souldiours of Ioab. 9 If a wise man contende with a foolish man, somtimes the foole is angry, sometimes hee laugheth, but there is no stay.
It is not without cause that God giueth wisedome to men, but it is to the ende that thereby they shoulde guide themselues so wisely, that none should iustly haue occasion to contend with them. And not onely so, but also to the ende they shoulde knowe howe to correct the foolish, and to contend against them, in reproouing them, rebuking and threatning them. They that are wise, doe their duetie, when they so behaue themselues. But they loose their time in the sight of the foolishe: for the foolishe reiect al correction, and doe scorne al instruction and discipline: as it is largely shewed here before in the first Chapter, and in other places. And besides that they despise & reiect, & scorne, they doe also furiously persecute the wise which contend with them, for to bring thē vnto amendment: yea, they persecute them without ceasing: as Solomon doeth pro∣nounce it, whē he saith, If a wise man contend with a foolish man, sometime he is angry, sometime he laugheth &c. By the anger, we vnderstand the furious persecutions: & by the laughter, we may vn∣derstand the cōtempt, reiection & mockerie, euen with persecution: as it is so taken, in Gen. 21. 9. Albeit, that the Hebrewe hath diuers Gal. 4. 29. verbes, yet are they al of one signification: to wit, to laugh and to mocke: whome Saint Paule doeth interpret to persecute. There are some that take this sentence, as if Solomon said, Be it that the wise hauing any matter to commen of with the foolishe, whither hee be angrie, or laugh, yet can hee not quiet and content the foolishe man. The wise man shal profite nothing to contende with a foole, though he speake neuer so gently with al humanitie and clemencie: as also Iesus Christ doeth reproche the Iewes thereof. Now the di∣uersitie Math. 11. 16 of opinons doth proceede hereof. For to auoyde tedious∣nes, it is not openly expressed, whether it is the wise or the foole that is angry and laugheth. But in what sense soeuer wee take this sentence, we see that the foolish is neuer the more amended, after what sort soeuer we contend with him: yet most commonly hee doeth remaine obstinate, scorning all exhortations, euen with cho∣ler, which is not soone quenched: as Solomon noteth, saying, that there is no stay, or ceasing, or rest. Yet is it not to say, that wee shoulde not continue to striue and contende against fooles, in rebuking, and threatning them: for GOD
would haue his woorde to be declared vnto all creatures, and that by the same woord we should labour to bring al men vnto faith and repentance. 10 Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iust hath care of his soule. Because that at the first sight there is none so simple but see∣meth wel to vnderstand that the murtherers doe hate the man that walketh vprightly and sincerely. For this cause it might seeme that Solomon doeth not pronounce heere any sentence of excellencie. But there is great difference betweene thinking to vnderstande, and to vnderstande indeede and in trueth. For euery man howe igno∣rant soeuer he is, doeth presume to vnderstand: but it is very hard to finde such as truely doeth vnderstand and knowe that Bloody men hate him that is vpright. For it appeareth not that a man is a murtherer, except that by deede of violence and oppression hee kill and sley his neighbour. But wee thinke not that hee doeth hate his neighbour that pursueth him in iudgement, at least wise of hatred, for the which he is to be rebuked: though vnder colour of good right he labour to destroy his neighbour. And also for too shewe that they may well hate their neighbour, in pleading against him, they wil say, that in a whole booke of Lawe, there is not one ounce of loue. And as it is saide, so it is practised by them, which neither can demaunde nor desende their right, with such modestie as is required, but suffer themselues to be carried about of their af∣fections, not resisting their passions. Now a man is a murtherer that hateth his neighbour, and that without cause is angrie with him, and who hauing the riches of this world, hath no compassion of his needie brother, is voyde of loue: of what state and degree so∣euer 1. Iohn. 3. 55. Mat. 5. 22. Mat. 5. 44. Rom. 12. 20. he be, as it is shewed vs, when it is commaunded vs to loue our neighboures and to feede them. Wherevpon it foloweth, that they which hate good men deserue rightly to be called bloodie men and murtherers. The which notwithstanding the world doeth not know, nor will vnderstande. For because that vpright men are con∣trarie to the worldlinges, which thinke themselues and woulde bee accounted wise and vpright men, therefore the worldlinges labour
to perswade themselues that vpright men are wicked: and there∣fore doe beare them hatred, the which they declare by their fruites: that is to say, by outrage, oppressions violences and cruelties that they exercise against those men which walke vprightly and sincere∣ly. And because that they labour to deceiue themselues with false and cruel perswasion, Solomon doeth cal them murtherers, and sheweth howe they are blooddy men, when he saith, that they hate the vpright man, that in no wise thinketh to do thē any iniury or wrong, nor to vse with them fraude and deceite, nor with any o∣ther person. Nowe hee iudgeth of hatred: not that hee knoweth the harts, but bicause it is seen by his euil fruits. And albeit that al hateful men are murtherers, yet is this chiefly against wicked kinges, princes, magistrates & iudges, that he pronounceth this sentence: for seeing that God, who is right and iust, and therefore taketh care to pre∣serue vpright men, doeth make and ordeine them his liefetenantes, and giueth them his place, they aboue al other ought to bee vpright and careful of the liues of vpright men. And not onely, not to do them any iniurie, but also to saue and defende them from all op∣pression, in punishing the oppressours and wrong doers. Solomon doth wel teach them this lesson, when hee saith, But the iust haue care of his soule. Forasmuche therefore as wee woulde not bee counted murtherers or bloody men, let vs take heed to put away al hatred, and to turne ourselues from doing any iniurie and oppression: and chiefly, that wee doe no hurt vn∣to them that walke vprightly and sincerely, but rather let vs bee careful ouer them, and that with a franke and free hearte wee bee ready to doe them al the pleasures that wee possibly can. And thus doing, wee shall not bee accused of murther, but shalbee counted vpright, euen before God. 11 A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wise man kee∣peth it in till afterwardes. There are some that make a great account of themselues, & doe
also desire to bee reputed of towardes other: and therefore they bragge so much as they can, and pronounce from their mouthes all thinges that they thinke may serue to winne praise, and to be in ad∣miration: and are so puffed vp with vainglory, pride and arrogan∣cie: their heartes are so infected and corrupted with malice, that if they thinke a man doeth or sayth any thing that is contrarie vnto their desire and affections, incontinent they shewe the poyson that lyeth hid in their thoughts, in outraging, iniurying, and cursing thē which either doe or say any thing that liketh them not. And when they vse themselues so, they thinke they are excellent, and haue their heartes in good estate: but the holy Ghost doth declare vnto them, that they are faynt hearted, when he calleth them fooles, saying by Solomon, A foole poureth out all his minde. Now when the foole de∣spiseth and reiecteth all counsell, all admonitions, corrections and threatninges, it followeth rightly that he not his hearte armed with good thoughtes, but filled with all malice and wickednesse. forasmuch as from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh, it followeth also that from a wicked treasure of his hearte the foole bringeth out wicked things, by the which he openeth al his thought and sheweth that it is nothing woorth. If then we wil not be fooles, nor counted such, let vs be careful to arme our heartes with whole∣some doctrine, willing to receiue admonitions, corrections, exhor∣tations, and threatnings, that are made vnto vs in the name of God and by his word, that we shoulde learne to walke in humblenes of hearte, and in no wise to brag, and not sodeinly to doe iniurie, out∣rage, and to curse our neighbours, that make no great count of vs but despising vs, labour to prouoke vs vnto wrath and anger, and to contende with them. Thus dooing we shall be wise as follow∣eth, But a wise man keepeth it tyll afterwardes. That is to saye: Albeeit that the wise, after his wisedome, beeing solde vnder sinne, is prouoked to shewe foorth his wrath and his choler, yet neuerthelesse, by the wisedome wherewith hee is indewed, hee restraineth it, and powreth not foorth his thought, but keepeth it backe til afterwardes, that is to say, till hee see that it is needefull to
declare it, or til afterwardes, signifieth, that hee committeth the matter vnto God, who can at the last wel shewe what he thinketh, of the foolish, and to bee reuenged of them. 12 Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his seruauntes are wicked. Forasmuch as the Princes of the worlde haue great burdens, & that also in great number, the which they cannot wel execute by themselues, as Iethro doeth declare to Moses, for this cause they haue neede to haue officers and Ministers vnder them, that they may beare a part of the charge and burden: as sayth Iethro. Exod. 18. 18. 21. 22 Nowe the right and true Princes, do desire to haue good mi∣nisters and good officers, and are careful to admonish them to doe iustice and iudgement: as did king Iosaphat. They that are like vn∣to 2. Chro. 19. 6. 7. him, doe not desire to haue about them a great number of Mini∣sters to serue them with a faire shewe, to bee magnified and exalted aboue their subiectes by pride and arrogancie. They desire not to bee accompanied in their houses with scoffers and iesters, talecarri∣ers, flatterers and slaunderers: but they followe what Dauid prote∣steth to doe. I wil knowe the perfect way, and wil walke in my Psal. 101. 3. house with a perfect hearte. Contrarily, wicked and vnfaithfull Princes doe gladly hearken vnto flattering tales, false reportes, and backitinges: and therefore they loue not to haue either in their townes or houses vpright and true men: but doe reiect, yea perse∣cute thē. For this cause they can haue none other but wicked mini∣sters and seruantes: as Solomon doeth very plainly pronounce, say∣ing. Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lyes, &c. We may heere alleadge, Pharao, Saul, Acab, and other. Wee may say also that there is a threatning enclosed within this sentence: to wit, That God for to punish the Princes that delight to heare lying tales, wil not suffer that they shalbee serued with good and vertuous men: but as they are wicked, euen so doth God giue them for their com∣panions wicked men, which wil bee very readie to shew them some wicked act of vnfaithfulnesse: as they also are vnfaithful vnto God,
when in steede that they shoulde continually meditate in the lawe of God, and haue al their delight therein, for to learne to followe the way of trueth, they giue themselues vnto lyes. Therefore, let the princes which desire to be wel serued, become the true & good seruants of God, who loueth trueth, the which they ought to fol∣low, for to serue him rightly, and minister iustice truely: otherwise they serue the Diuel, and iniquitie reigneth in them, by the which the feeble, poore, and innocent are oppressed. 13 The poore and the vsurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies. Solomon hath saide heeretofore, The rich and the poore meete together, the Lorde is rhe maker of them al: and nowe hee Pro. 22. 2. saith the same, sauing that in steede of the rich, hee setteth the vsu∣rer. But there is no great differnce therein: for oftentimes wee see the riche men of the worlde to be giuen vnto vsurie, spoyling, to deceit and fraude, for to attaine vnto greater riches. Wee see al∣most dayly that the vsurers become riche, or at the least labour to bee riche. The poore then that is destitute of worldly riches, and the vsurer, whose minde and affection is altogether set to make pro∣fite of, and to multiply his golde and siluer, and other goods, to the hinderance of his neighbours, and chiefly of the needie and poore: though they bee of a cleane contrary state, yet doe they meete to∣gether: that is to say, that they are mingled together, and occupie one with another. The poore man hath need that the vsurer should helpe him with his abundance: and the vsurer which is ful and riche, cannot himselfe doe all his businesse alone: wherefore hee must needes set the poore man on worke. Beholde howe the poore and the vsurer meete together. Notwithstanding it often happeneth that the poore man being pinched & greeued with his needinesse and pouertie, and distrusting to be able to obteine that which is necessary, enuieth the prosperitie of the vsurer: and the v∣surer that hath a couetous hearte, and aboundeth in riches, doeth contemne the poore, either by pride, or for feare hee shoulde want himselfe. Nowe they both proceede thus, through want that they know
not that God made them, and that as hee hath made them, so wil he also mainteine them in this life, and giueth them wit and vnder∣standing for to knowe howe to gouerne themselues in this worlde: as Solomon hath wel noted, saying, that the Lord is maker both of Pro. 22▪ 2 the poore and riche: and nowe, when he saith, The Lorde lighteneth the eies of them both. For, to lighten the eies, is to quicken and to comfort: as it is so taken in diuers places of the scripture. Behold howe God lighteneth the eies both of the poore man and of the vsurer, quickening & giuing thē know∣ledge: 1. Sam. 14. 27. 29. Esdr. 9. 8. Psa. 13. 4. but there are fewe poore, and vsurers that doe knowe the same, as we may iudge, for that that there are but a few poore men contented with their estate, and very fewe also of vsurers which doe lothe and abhorre their estate, to forsake it, and to abstaine from al extortions and exactions, from al fraude, deceite and spoy∣ling, If it were otherwise, they woulde euery where obey the ad∣monition of Saint Iames, that hee which is of a lowe and poore e∣state, woulde reioyce ween hee is exalted, contrarily, the rich would Iam. 1. 9. 10. 11. reioyce in his lowe degree and when hee is abaced, &c. As tou∣ching the rest, let vs note that when God lighteneth aswel the eies of the vsurer as of the poore, and that hee maketh the Sunne to rise both vpon the good and bad, we ought not to iudge of med accor∣ding Math. 5. 35. to the prosperitie they inioy, nor after the aduersitie they suf∣fer. For also most commonly the righteous are in miserie and cala∣mities, they are afflicted, tormented, and persecuted: and the wic∣ked prosper and floorishe, they are honoured, and praised, as hath beene already sometimes handeled. Some vnderstand by lightening of the eyes, gouerning and moderating the heartes and mindes, so that God maketh the poore man to bee contented with his state, and the vsurer not so sore to afflict the poore man as hee woulde: the which conteineth trueth. Othersome vnderstande that God hath mercy on whome hee wil, and sheweth mercy to the poore man, to the rich, to the sinner and vsurer. And this sense conteineth trueth also: but the first is the most fittest: as may be seene by the scriptures alledged. 14 The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne shalbe established for euer.
The kings & superiors of the earth are often ambitious, proude, arrogant, and high minded: They loue to be exalted, to be had in re∣uerence to be feared and doubted. And to the ende that none should dare to doe any thing against thē, they wil bragge & magnifie themselues, and as the same shal seeme to them to be necessary, they wil arme and fortifie themselues against those whom they take to be their enemies. And least their owne subiectes should rebel against them, and reuolt from them, they wil handle them most seuerely & sharply, most vngently and cruelly. In dooing the same, they think to make their name perpetuall, and it seemeth to them that their kingdome shal neuer depart from their house, so long as the worlde shal last. And for to arme themselues strongly in their fantasie, they wil hold themselues in with the great and most mightie, wil honour them and shewe them fauour, in disdaining and treading the poore vnder feete, which haue neither power nor mainteinance, and wil o∣uerthrowe their right to pleasure therewith the stronger. Now be∣cause that in so dooing they iustifie the wicked, and make wicked decrees, they are cursed, and so they cannot prosper, nor bee perma∣nent and established for euer, as they perswade themselues, but shal Esay. 5. 23. & 10. 1. 2. be sodainly destroyed, according as they are threatned. And also we haue the examples thereof in the floode of Noe, in the subuersion of Sodome, in the destruction of Pharao and his armie, and in the discomfiture of the kinges and their people, of the land of Canaan: in Saule, Achab, and Baltasar. But where the kinges without pre∣ferring the poore in their causes wil take pitie of them, yeelding thē the right that belongeth vnto thē, then shal they cause their throne long to endure, as Solomon doeth pronounce saying. The king that iudgeth. &c. But against this sentence wee may alledge that if euer there were gouernours, iudges, and kinges, which haue iudged the poore in trueth, Moses, Iosua, Sampson, Ge∣deon, Dauid, Iosias, Ezekias, and Iosaphat, haue done it, and yet they haue not stablished their throne eternally. For, as we may see, they haue not long continewed, and euen betweene the raigne of the one and the other there haue been horrible dissipations, & after them al, & yet stil the people ouer whom they reigned, is in greate desolation. Now hereunto we may answer that the establishmēt for euer ought
not to bee referred to that which is seene to the eye, but vnto the fayth and contentation that God hath giuen vnto those kings, and to that, that he beareth their iustice in perpetual memory, the which shal neuer be abolished. We may also say that the good kings do not reigne in their owne name, but doe confesse themselues to bee the lieftenants of Iesus Christ, and to bee ministers of his kingdome, the which shal endure for euer, and that at the last they shall enioy this eternitie. 15 The rod and correction giue wisedome: but a childe set at libertie, maketh his mother ashamed. Forasmuch as wisedome is of greatest excellency, and of greatest profit, not only vnto olde men, but also vnto young people, as wee haue seene by the admonitions and declarations that Solomō hath made vs heeretofore oftentimes, therefore the fathers and mothers that desire to haue their children to profit wel, must bee diligent to make them learne wisedome not worldly and carnal (which is no∣thing Pro. 13. 24. & 22. 15. & 23. 13. 14. else but vanity and foolishnes before GOD) but the heauen∣ly wisedome, that expelleth foolishnes which is bounde vnto the necke of of the childe. But forasmuch as childrē wil not giue thēselues therto, except they be constrained by corrections and roddes, therefore Solomon in di∣uers places admonisheth fathers and mothers for to beate their chil∣dren with roddes: now he affirmeth that the rodde and correction giue wisedome. And thus if we desire that our children shoulde be wise, we must be diligent to correct and chasten them. Not that by our rods and corrections we can atchiue to giue them wisedome, for it is a woorke of the holy Ghost. True it is, that the correcti∣ons and rods are instrumentes ordeined of God, and doe profite so much as it pleaseth him: and therefore, when we correct and cha∣stice our children to make them wise, we must diligently commende our woorke vnto God: For also if the roddes and corrections of themselues giue wisedome, then none of those children that are cor∣rected Prou. 10. 1. & 15. 20. & 23, 15. 16 and chastened should remaine obstinate. And forasmuch as they giue wisedome vnto children, euen so they bring ioy vnto the fathers & mothers. Therfore let the fathers & mothers for the profit
and honour of their children, and for their ioy & consolation, peace and rest, keepe and holde their children short, correcting and chaste∣ning them: for if they giue them the bridle, they shal proceede in Pro. 10. 1. & 15. 20. & 17 21. 25. folly, whereof they shalbe greeued and ashamed: as now Solomon saith. But a childe set at libertie, &c. And sith that Solomon who was so wise, standeth so long in declaring that wee must correct and chasten children, therefore let vs knowe that it is a very necessary thing: and therefore ought not to bee despised nor neglected. 16 When the wicked are increased, transgression encrea∣seth: but the righteous shall see their fall. Wickednesse hath euer raigned, as wee may see it in Cain and Lameth, but when the worlde was growne and multiplied, by the Gene. 4. disordinate and vnbrideled lustes of the sonnes of God towards the daughters of men, the wicked did multiply. At this time were the Gene. 6. 41. Giants dwelling on earth: afterwardes the sonnes of God agreed with the sonnes of men, &c. Then as the wicked and cruel multi∣plied, Gen. 6. 5. 11. 12. 13. euen so did wickednesse encrease and multiplie. The like was found true by experiēce in the Canaanites, and also in the peo∣ple of Israel, that where the wicked did growe amongest them, e∣uen there wickednes also did increase. And in these yeeres past we haue had but too much experience thereof. Nowe it is common that when the wicked see themselues a great number, they waxe bolde to doe infinite euils, and chiefly a∣gainst the poore and feeble, against the righteous and innocent, a∣gainst the good and vpright, for to destroy them if it were possible: and doe boldly promise too themselues that whatsoeuer they doe Psa. 10. 6. Esay. 28. 15. Psa. 10. 2. Psa. 14. 6. & 22. 8. Gene. 6. 8. 13 & 7. & 18. & 19. they shall feele no hurte thereof. And this is because they de∣light in their worldly prosperitie, euen to care nothing for God. And to discourage the righteous, whome they persecute and would make to dispaire, they scorne them, that beeing so feeble, they dare hope and trust that God will deliuer them. But as Noe founde fauour before GOD, who reuealed vnto him the ende of al fleshe, and shewed vnto him the destruction of the worlde:
and as God foretolde Abraham: and as the angels foretolde Lo of the destruction and ouerthrowe of Sodome, and the same also: and as God hath made many other righteous to see the destruction of the wicked, which were mightie and many in number: as to the children of Israel, Dauid, and other good kinges and iudges: euen so wil hee also shewe vs the same fauour, if wee walke truely in righteousnesse and vprightnesse: as Solomon doeth promise vs, saying, When the wicked, &c. And this agreeth with that which is written in diuers places. Thus we see that the wicked, how mightie Iob. 22. 15. Psal. 37. 34. & 52. 7. & 58. 11. Esay. 66. 24. & greate a number soeuer they be, can they not atchieue to the end of their enterprises: but must fal & perish. And contrarily, the iust that are weake, and which dayly doe perishe euen before our eies, are preserued, and beholde the vengeance that God taketh of their persecutours. And thus wee are taught not to waigh, nor to iudge things, as wee see them at the first sight, but wee must looke to the threatnings that God maketh against the vngodly, and to the promises that he maketh vnto the righteous, for they are certaine, & other thinges that we see with our eies, doe passe and vanishe a∣way to nothing. 17 Correct thy sonne, & he will giue thee rest, and will giue pleasure to thy soule. There is neither olde nor young, but desireth rest and peace, & also therewith to haue wherewith he may be delighted and made to reioyce. And as it is a thing to be desired, euen so also it is proper vnto the nature of man: and chiefly vnto the aged, which are not of such power and might that they can labour, as can they that are in their floorishing age. But commonly we knowe not the meanes whereby wee may come to obteine these desires, and when wee knowe them, yet wil we not holde them. For albeit that Solomon hath sometimes exhorted the fathers and mothers to correct and to chasten their children with roddes, and that hee hath promised them, in so doing that they shal driue out and expel foolishnes from the hearts of their children, and shal deliuer their soules from hel,
yet for the most part the fathers and mothers doe not vnderstande that they ought to chasten their children, and doe much feare to anger them, and for to reioyce and to giue them recreation, they let them runne where they list. Wherevpon it commeth, that in steede of resting vpon their children, and to haue pleasure in them, and to delight in their good gouernment, in their modestie and obedience their children doe torment them, and vexe them by their dissolu∣tions, lewdnesse and rebellion. And therefore, againe Solomon doth admonishe them, correct thy sonne, &c. And hee promiseth them that in so doing they shal haue rest and pleasure. For in correcting their children, foolishnesse which was bounde vnto their heartes is put away, and thereby wisdome is giuen them: whereupon fol∣loweth rest and pleasures. For a wise sonne reioyceth his father: Pro. 10. 1. & 15. 20. Heerein Solomon teacheth the fathers, what duetie they owe vnto their children: and to the children hee teacheth what they owe vn∣to their fathers and mothers, not onely that which is necessary, but also what is pleasant, yea euen before God. For children must not be giuen to vanitie and foolishnesse, to vncleannesse and dishonestie, for to giue recreation vnto their fathers and mothers: but they ought to followe whatsoeuer God commandeth them, and to haue their fathers and mothers in abhomination and hatred, which shoulde demaunde the contrary, or that shoulde hinder them to fo∣lowe what God commandeth. 18 Where there is no vision, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is blessed. It is written, before time in Israel when a man went to seeke an answere of God, thus hee spake, Come & let vs goe to the Seer: for he that is called nowe a Prophet, was in olde time called a Seer. And 1. Sam. 9. 9 sith that a Seer is a Prophet, we wil take the vision for a Prophesie: as the same is taken in Esay. This kinde of vision hath euer byn ne∣cessary in the worlde for the preseruation of men, and hath greatly profited the people of Israel, when they had Seers that gouerned thē, the want of thē bringeth great hurt: for hauing the Prophets, Esay. 1. 1. they were instructed in the wil of God, which shewed thē the way
to saluation and life: but being destitute of Seers, they knowe not what they should doe. They gaue themselues vnto superstitions & idolatries, vnto craftinesse and rauine, to doing wrong, extortions, and violences, and other wickednesses: and so prouoked GOD vnto wrath against them: and for this cause hee raised vp enimies to spoyle and destroy them: as wee may see in the booke of the Iudges, and in other holy histories. Likewise all other nati∣ons being destitute of Seers, or reiecting the worde of God, haue suffered horrible wasting. And stil nowe wee see that the nations which haue not the pure preaching of the Gospel, are vexed and tormented with warres, by the which a great number of people doeth perishe. Now according to these experiments: Solomon saith, Where there is novision, the people decay. Except then that wee re∣ceiue the worde with al obedience, by the which woorde, God doeth reueale himselfe vnto vs, and doeth declare his wil vnto vs, wee are cursed: for by such contempt we goe to perdition: though for a time it seeme that wee doe prosper and florishe. Let vs there∣fore receiue the vision, that is to say, the wholsome doctrine, wher∣by wee are instructed what the wil of God is: and in this sort, wee shall not decay, but shalbe happy and blessed, as Solomon doth pro∣nounce, saying, But hee that keepeth the lawe, &c. That wee may wel and truely keepe this lawe or doctrine, wee must hate and abhorre our sinnes, and with al our heartes folowe and doe the good deede that God commandeth vs, and to distrust ourselues, and to cal vnto him for our helpe: and also wee must bee assured that hee wil not fayle nor deceiue vs, though wee accomplishe not perfectly that which he commandeth vs: but of his only grace and goodnes he giueth vs faith and repentance, and he doth accept and allow them for the ful∣filling of his lawe, and doth pardon and forgiue vs our imperfecti∣ons, so that they do truely displease vs. And thus though it is saide, that he that keepeth the law is blessed, yet let vs not thinke that we can fulfil it: but forsaking our merites, let vs weepe and lament for our maliciousnesse, and imperfections, desiring of God that hee would please to guide vs in his wayes. So dooing, we shal not walke in ouer weening and arrogancie, for boldly to giue ourselues vnto al
kinde of sinnes: we shal not abide in ignorance, for to dout of the doctrine, and religion that we should holde: neither shal we be de∣stitute of consolation, for to fal into dispaire: nor wee shal not be left in the power of the Deuil, for to be troubled in our consciences by his crueltie and tyrannie, and to fal vnder his temptations, Let 2. Pet. 1. 9. Amos. 8. 11. vs therefore be attentiue, and giue diligent heed vnto the worde of the Prophetes, and suche famine as the Iewes are threatened with∣al, shal not fal vpon vs. 19 A slaue wil not be chastized with wordes: though hee vnderstand, yet he wil not answere. It is a common thing in the world, that men labour to do con∣trarie to that, that is commanded them, & is forbidden them, though they wel vnderstande it is reason to obeye. And therein wee shewe ourselues of a slauishe condition, though that in despising the for∣biddings, and resisting the commandementes, wee thinke to be ex∣empted from bondage, and to liue at libertie and in freedome. For being rebellious against that which is, and that we know to be rea∣sonable, we serue and obey our vnbrideled lusts and wicked desires. Contrarily, we are in true libertie, when with a free heart & minde, without constraint wee submit ourselues vnto that which is reaso∣nable. Whereupon it rightly foloweth, that we are not at libertie of ourselues. For neither we wil, nor can be gouerned, but after the desire of our fleshe, the which is enimitie against God. And thus, this is verified in vs, that a slaue wil not be chastized, &c. It were in vaine to preach vnto vs, to admonishe vs, to reprooue vs, and to Rom. 1. 7. threaten vs, except that God did set vs at libertie, and make vs free by his Spirite, we serue our lustes, by the which with al our power, we rebel against God, and thinking to set ourselues at libertie, wee become more the slaues of sinne. Wherefore, we must humble our¦selues, and confesse with Saint Paule, that we are bondeslaues, sold vnder sinne, and that there is a lawe in our members, fighting a∣gainst the lawe of our minde. And therfore we ought to weepe with him, saying, O wretched men that we are! who shal deliuer vs from Iohn. 8. Rom. 7. 14. 24. the body of this death? And wee must pray with Dauid, O create in mee a cleane hearte, and rene we a right spirite within mee, &c.
And in the meane while to giue our hearts vnto the word of truth, and therin to perseuer: and in this sort we shal not be seruants that Psal. 51. 12. 13. 14. wil not answere, but framing our liues vnto the worde of trueth, wee shalbe free by the grace of the Sonne of God. Beholde, howe we must learne to knowe and to chaunge our seruile state, when So∣lomon reprooueth seruantes, for that, that beeing admonished of their duetie, albeit that they rightly knowe, that it is reason they Iohn. 8. 31. should obey, and not be deaffe, yet esteeme nothing thereof. For if seruantes that are bought for monie, are to be reprehended when they yeeld not obedience to them that haue bought them, or pos∣sesse them by succession: and that for the doing of their dutie, they ought to be subiect in al things vnto their maisters, as Saint Paul Ephe. 6. 5. Col. 3. 22. 2. Tim. 6. 1. Tit. 2. 9. 1. Pet. 2. 18. 1. Pet. 1. 18. 19. 1. Cor. 6. 29. 30. & 7. 23. Luke. 12. 47. doeth admonish them: by a stronger reason then, we are rightly to be condemned, if we be not obedient vnto our God, who hath re∣deemed vs with a most precious raunsome. For this cause Saint Paul doeth admonish vs, that we should confesse such a benefite. Let vs take heede to make as though we heard not such admonitions, the which are so cleare and plaine, that we can not excuse vs not to haue heard them. Otherwise, after that God by wordes shal haue opened vnto vs his wil, hee wil punish vs for our disobedience. And albeit that Solomon speaketh here, of those that were of seruile condition, because they were gotten & bought with monie, or taken in warre: notwithstanding, we may stretch this sentence vnto hirelings, who during the time that they gaine the monie of an other, are slaues: but the greatest number of them, for al the things that are shewed them, and admonitions that are giuen them, yet do they not passe to doe their dutie. Some of them desire nothing but to passe away the time in idlenesse: other somelabour to deceiue and to steale: and so, al∣beit that they wel vnderstand and heare, yet wil they not answere. They know wel enough, that whatsoeuer is demanded of them, is reasonable: as they wel shew, when before their maisters, they wil appeare good seruantes, and in their absence, doe the worst they they can, But if they be not beaten of their maisters, as were the poore slaues, yet shal they not escape the whippe of GOD, as dailie is seene.
20 Seest thou a man hastie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him. As we haue seene heretofore in diuers places, that fooles are obstinate & past correction, and for this cause, they are rebuked and dispised, threatned and condemned, as people in whom there is loo∣ked no amendment, and of whome we vtterly dispaire. And there∣fore, when Solomon saith, That there is more hope of a foole then of him, that is hastie in his matters, or in his wordes, let vs not vn∣derstand that wee must hope for any thing of a foole: but that the hastie man in his matters is not onely a foole, but worse thā a foole: and if it bee a harde matter to bring a foole to goodnesse, it is a thing much more harde to be done with him that is hastie in his matters. And thus, albeit that Solomon setteth the hastie man against the foole: yet let vs not thinke that Solomon goeth about to blame the diligence that a man giueth to folowe his vocation: whome hee hath praysed and commended before, by rebuking of the slouth∣full. For also there is great difference betweene the diligent and hastie man: the diligent doeth carefully looke to what he hath to doe, and laboureth not to loose the time, but to spende the same in woorkes that may profite him, and bring no domage vnto his neighbours: hee is not enuious towardes his neighbours, for to hinder them from their profite, but wil rather helpe them, and bee glad of their prosperitie. A hastie man is without care: he is fer∣uently minded, hee is earnest about his matters, without conside∣ring what shalbe the ende: hee careth not though hee troubleth his neighbours: hee proceedeth ignorantly, and suffers himselfe to be caried with a loose bridle, after his vnbrideled lustes: hee casteth God at his backe, hee maketh no count of his word, and reiecteth his prouidence. This same, is gathered partly in this pre∣sent sentence, wherein Solomon more dispaireth of the hastie man, then of the foole, & partly in the nineteeneth Chapter, and 2. verse: and partly, in the one and twentieth Chapter, & fifth verse. And be∣cause the hastie man is such, he shalbe cursed of God, & shal feele his
vengeance, as hath bene handled. If we shal say hastie in his words the sense shalbe fit enough: for the tongue is a dangerous and an vnruly euil. To the ende then, that wee fal not into the number of Pro. 18. 20. Iam. 3. 3. & 1. 13. suche hastiemen, let vs obey the admonition of Saint Iames, Let e∣uerie man be readie and hastie to heare, and slowe to speake. Thus dooing, we shal not be hastie in hearing, and slowe of speaking. So doing, we shal not be giuen vnto idle talke, vaine babbling, to blas∣pheming, to vniust rebukes, to cursing, to lying, false witnesse bea∣ring, to backbiting, to flatterie and false tales, nor to dishonest talke: Ephe. 4. 29. & 5. 3. 19. Collo. 4. 6. but we shal weigh our wordes, folowing the holie admonitions of Saint Paule. 21 Hee that delicately bringeth vp his seruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his sonne. There is a common prouerbe, that saieth, Saue the theefe from the galowes, and he shal kil thee: or, Fat the villain, and he shal prick thee. And this is according to experience. For if a man doe graci∣ously intreate a villaine, hee is readie to be vnthankful, and in place to acknowledge the humanitie and the gentlenesse that is vsed and shewed towards him, he wil vse sharpnesse, & do extreeme wrong, without cause, rising vp against him, to whome he standeth bound, and wil labour to subdue him, and persuade men to beleeue that he to whome he is detter, doeth owe vnto him: and in steede that he should be his seruant, hee would reigne ouer him, yea destroy him. Nowe according to this experience, Solomon saith, He that delicately bringeth vp his seruant, &c. He nameth a seruant, by whome hee meaneth al persons that are bounde to giue honour, seruice, subiection and obedience to other. And thus, hee comprehendeth al those that are vnder the power of Kings and Ma∣gistrates, of fathers and mothers, of Lordes and Maisters. And albe∣it that such inferiors are not of a seruile or slauish condition, as were the slaues bought for monie, or taken in warre, notwithstanding, they are bounde to acknowledge those with al humblenesse, vnder whose tuition they are, to be their superiours: and to vnderstande that they ought in no wise to rise vp against thē, but the more gēt∣ly they are handled, so much the more to humble themselues: as
Saint Paul doeth closely teach them. But forasmuch as wee see most commonly to happen, that the seruantes and other of vile and lowe 1. Tit. 6. 1. condition before the worlde, doe waxe proude when they are gent∣ly intreated and suffered to haue their pleasure, Solomon by this sentence warneth al those that are in authoritie, that they shoulde not slacke the bridle vnto those that are vnder their subiection and yoke, for to let them liue after the desires of their fleshe, nor to take their pleasures after the lust thereof: but shoulde vse grauitie and moderate seueritie, and should accustome them to bestowe the time about good workes, after as they are called, and to teach them to liue soberly and temperately, yea rather austerely, then to suffer them to runne where they list, Otherwise the superiours are in dan∣ger to feele their pride and arrogancie: as Solomon doeth signifie, when he saith, that at the length the seruant will be as the sonne: yea euen as the sonne that feeleth and knoweth his hearte, and be∣cause he knoweth himselfe to bee his fathers heire, and that hee thinketh the goods doe appertaine and belong vnto him, therfore hee wil doe after his pleasure, as a Lorde and Maister, and wil mur∣mure against his father, vnlesse hee suffer him to haue the ruling of the goods of the house at his pleasure: and chiefly when the fathers are waxen old, the children, which haue bin most delicately brought vp, do curse them, calling them olde doaters, and giuing them other iniurious words, except they be permitted to doe with the goods as they wil. Now forasmuch as it is so, that by our corrupted nature we are al of a seruile condition (for we serue our wicked lustes, & vnbri∣led affections, & the law of sin, the which holdeth vs captiues) ther∣fore we haue need that our God (who is our Lord, that hath dearely bought vs with the blood of his only sonne) shoul hold vs vnder his yoke and discipline, and not to nourishe vs vp with the ease of our fleshe, making vs to enioye his riches in delicatenesse and pleasure, in abundance and excesse: but shoulde tame and chasten vs, that we rebel not against him, nor disobey him: as it is our manner and custome, to fal away when we enioye our pleasures: euen as wee may see it in the holie histories, and as experience teacheth through al the world. It is then very needful for vs to craue of our God with Ieremie, let him correct vs, not in his wrath but in iudgement, lest Ier. 10. 23. 24. & 31. 18. hee bring vs to nothing. Conuert mee O Lorde, and I shalbee
conuerted, &c. Thus dooing, wee shal truely be the sonnes of the great Lorde of heauen and earth, and fellowe heires of al thinges with Iesus Christ our Lorde, by whome our good heauenly Father of grace & mercie hath adopted vs for his children, before the foun∣dation of the worlde. 22 An angrie man stirreth vp strife: and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. As it is saide, Behold, how good and ioyful a thing it is, for bre∣thren to dwel together in vnitie: euen so there is no man (if he haue Psa. 131. 1. any sounde iudgement) but desireth to liue in peace and concorde with his neighbours: as also Saint Paule doeth admonish vs there∣of. But albeit that this is the iudgement, yet many can not, or wil Rom. 12. 18 Mat. 5. Ephe. 4 & 5. Phil. 2. Collo. 3. not folowe the fit & right meanes to obtaine this peace, the which Saint Paule doeth teache vs in diuers places, folowing the doctrine of Iesus Christ. But in steede of beeing so humble, modest, patient, soft and gentle, wee wil striue with our neighbours in rising vp a∣gainst them in wrath and anger: and yet we wil persuade men that we dare not once murmure, & whinch against thē: & therfore they wil be out of troubles, and farre from vexations. Notwithstanding, experience sheweth the cleane contrarie: for such people doe often meete with shrewde heades, that knowe howe to answere and resist them, and giue them a sharpe repulse: wherupon riseth strife. According to this experience, Solomon hath said, An angrie man stirreth vp strife or debate: and nowe he saieth againe, An angrie Pro. 15. 18 man stirreth vp strife, &c. And forasmuche as wee desire, or that wee shoulde desire peace, let vs vnderstande, that forasmuche as Solomon is so careful to aduertise vs of this experience, hee doeth thereby admonishe vs to put away wrath and anger, and also to flye the company of angriemen, which are sodeinely angred. Thus dooing, we shal liue peaceably with our neighbours, and also haue peace with our God: for hee loueth the peacemakers, calling them the children of God. And also hauing peace, and seeking Mat. 5. 9. to continue the same with our neighbours, wee wil abstaine from
many iniuries, outrages, cruelties, and oppressions, whereunto they are readily giuē, which rise vp in anger & wrath against their neigh∣bours: as Solomon doeth pronounce, saying, A furious man aboundeth in transgression. Whereupon fo∣loweth, that as hee maketh warre against his neighbours, and op∣presseth them: euen so wil God pay them again, and knoweth how to be reuenged on them in his wrath and anger, the which he shal feele eternally for euer. Therfore if we wil haue God merciful vnto vs, let vs be soft and gentle vnto our neighbours, folowing the ad∣monition: Cease from anger, and leaue of wrath: fret not they selfe Psa. 37. 8. 1. also to doe euil. 23 The pride of a man shall bring him low: but the humble in spirite shall enioy glory. A man riseth in pride diuers wayes. First of al, when hee is not contented with the state wherein God hath placed him, being high Gene. 3. & 11. or lowe, but laboureth to rise vp higher: as our father Adam, as they which builded Babel, as Absolom did in his fathers life time. Secōd∣ly, 2. Sam. 15. when a man reioiceth and braggeth of his power: as did Pharao King of Egypt, and other infidel kings, which vexed and oppressed the people of God. Thirdly, when we are pleased, and reioice in our riches, and contemne and despise the poore: as did Nabal the hus∣band 1. Sam. 25. Luke. 16. of Abigail, and the riche glutton. Fourthly, when we esteeme ourselues for the authoritie and credite wee haue with them, which are of power and estimation, as did Aman. Fifthly, when wee per∣swade Hester. 3. ourselues to bee wise and prudent by our trauaile and polli∣cie, and other of such kinde. Al those that be proude in any of these sortes continue not long in high estate, but their pride doeth bring them downe: as haue al the former aledged persons experimented, and all those that shalbe like vnto them, shal fal also, yea very so∣denly: as amongst other, the poore Papistes, which boast of their merites, by the which they promise themselues to flie vnto hea∣uen: but forasmuch as in this sorte they renounce God for their sa∣uiour, and become sauiours to themselues, they shalbee throwne downe to hel.
Wherefore, let vs take heed we folow neither them, nor those that haue bene named before, least we goe to destruction with them, and with the Deuil, who is the Prince of the proud: but let vs learne to acknowledge our God and father, & humble ourselues vnder him, confessing with our heartes, that wee haue nothing but of his onely goodnesse and liberalitie, and be contented with the state wherin it hath pleased him to set vs: and our good God of his grace and mer∣cie wil when the time is come, glorifie and magnifie vs. Solomon hath pronounced these thinges, and not contented herewith, he pro∣nounceth yet againe the like, saying, The pride of a man, &c. And this is because it is verie harde Pro. 16. 18. 19. & 18. 12 to beate into the minde of the proud, that he ought to humble and cast himselfe down: and also that the poore faithful which are con∣temned in the worlde, haue great neede of comforte: for to possesse Luke. 14. 11 &. 18. 14. the which, let vs beleeue this present sentence, the which agreeth with that which Iesus Christ our Lord saith, 24 He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne soule: hee heareth cursing and declareth it not. Albeit that wee come all from one father and one mother, and that wee bee al of one fleshe and blood, and that for this cause wee shoulde haue such fellowship in goods, as wee should not suf∣fer our neighbours to want: neuer thelesse wee ceasse not to be par∣takers of the riches of this worlde, and too appropriate and holde to ourselues that which commeth to vs: so that we iudge them to be theeues that take any thing of that which we possesse, against our willes, and doe esteeme them as abhominable, yea naturally because they bring vs hurte. But that which ought to make them more de∣testable vnto vs, is that they are disobedient vnto God, who forbid∣deth to steale. For the honour of God ought to bee more precious vnto vs then al the gaines of the world. Nowe albeit that we count the theeues for abhominable, yet as there are theeues that perswade themselues, or labour to put into their fantasie, that it is not yl done to take goods where a man can find them: euen so there are some which iudge that it is wickedly done to robbe, and also if they can,
wil cause them to be taken, and yet wil bee glad to haue part with the theeues: as it is reproched vnto them that are such. When the theeues and their partakers doe thus behaue themselues, they wel Psal. 50. 18 Esai. 1. 23. Rom. 2. 21. thinke to make their profite, and to mainteine themselues richly in this life: and they thinke also that they haue verie great care for their soules, because they labour to haue abundance of wealth to sustaine them. Because the more they loue themselues, the more they labour to gather riches: and they thinke that in this sort they do wel make their profite: but to make a temporal gaine that is not certaine (for they may be robbed themselues, as they haue robbed other: neither can they long possesse them: for they themselues are not of long continuance, and yet during their life, that which they haue stolne doth vanishe away, either by excessiue expenses, or after some other sorte that they looke not for) they destroy their soules for euer, and get shame so long as they liue, the which they can not shake off, nor purge them thereof. Solomon signifieth this same, saying, Hee that is partener with a theefe, &c. The destruc∣tion of their soules, is noted by the hating of the soule. For no man preserueth that willingly which hee hateth, but striueth to loose and to destroy it: albeit neuerthelesse, that the theeuse persuade them∣selues that their intent is not suche, when they steale, and gather the booti together, and vse the same at their pleasure: but indeed and truely, they destroy their soules: for theeues and robbers shal not inherite the kingdome of God. The shame is marked, when it is 1. Cor. 6. 10 saide, He heareth cursing When the theeues and their partakers or accessaries are takē, they are compelled to heare cried, out vpon the theeues, out vpon the wicked: & if they heare it not with their cor∣poral eares, they know wel enough, that they are condemned and euil spoken off. Now that they can not repulse the shame, nor purge themselues of it, Solomon doeth shewe it, when hee saieth, And declareth it not. Some expounde this same as if hee woulde say, that they which are parteners with theeues, dare not complaine of the rebukes that is laid to their charge: and indeed, if the theefe thinketh that any good and sufficient proofe may be brought against him, hee wil take good heed from lamenting of his case: but if hee thinke to be mainteined, or that he knoweth the probation is not
plaine enough, not only he wil complaine, but also wil aske amends for slaundering and taking away of his good name, and wil doe the worst he can against those which blame him. And albeit that in this sort, he doeth signifie some what the cursing that he hath heard, yet he doeth not declare it for to repulse, and to cleare himselfe therof. For though he laboureth to couer his shame, yet it can not bee al∣wayes hid, but at the last, it wil come to light, so that he shal not be able to deny but that he is wicked: as Saint Paul saieth, The sinnes of some men are manifest of themselues, comming before to iudge∣ment: 1. Tim. 5. 24. and other some come after. We may also say, that by not de∣claring the cursing that hee heareth, Solomon meaneth, that the theeues and their parteners are deaffe, and drinke vp the reproches and iniuries sweetly, that are made them, and take al in good parte: prouided that they stoppe them not to make their hande & get what they can. They are like vnto great mastiue curres, which whilest they are gnawing of the bones, care nothing at al for the litle whelpes that barke after them, and thinketh scorne once to remooue to bite them: but because that the worde which hath beene expoun∣ded, cursing, signifieth also swearing, some vnderstande that Solo∣mon woulde say, That though an othe bee giuen vnto the theeues partener, yet wil he not declare and reueale the trueth, but wil for∣sweare himselfe. Euen so it is a thing that is but too common; that men had rather blaspheme God, then to discouer and open the sinne of their neighbour, when it is required. But it might be said, that Solomon is rather tyed heere vnto the partener of the theefe, and his accessarie, that taketh parte of the bootie, then to the theefe that hath stolne the goods from an other. Wee answere heereun∣to, that there is good cause. For if the theefe be guiltie, then hee that hideth and partaketh with the bootie, is muche more giltie: for not onely hee is a theefe, but also so muche as in him lyeth, he iustifieth the theefe, when hee consenteth vnto his spoylings and robberies. And these are of the number of those whereof Saint Paule speaketh: who though they knewe the righteousnesse of Rom. 1. 32. God (that is to say, that they which doe suche thinges are woor∣thie of death) yet they wil not onely doe them, but also allowe o∣ther that doe the same. For if the accessaries and those which are
parteners with theeues, knewe not that the theeues were giltie, they woulde in no wise conceale nor hide them, neither woulde they also hide themselues. 25 The feare of man bringeth a snare: but he that trusteth in the Lord, shalbe exalted. The snares, in the scriptures, doe signifie trouble, vexation, sorowe, affliction, destruction, and ouerthrowe. And this, by a si∣militude borowed of beastes which are taken in the snares, in the toyle, or in pursenets, which for to deliuer themselues, doe take great paynes: but they can not escape, but must needes be taken, and perishe. Nowe as feareful beastes, seeing or smelling the hun∣ters and folowers, doe flye before them for feare of them: and it commeth to passe most often, that in flying and thinking to saue themselues, they runne and fal euen into the toyles and snares: e∣uen so, men which are easily feared, doe soone fal into euil. For their aduersaries seeing their fearefulnesse and faintheartednesse, do take thereof greater boldnesse, and promise themselues that they shal easily ouercome suche feareful men. The which the Prophet Num. 19. 9 Deut. 7. 17 & 20. 1. Esai. 7. 4. & 8. 12. & 10. 24. Iosua. 1. 9. Ier. 1. 8. 17 Eze. 2. 6. Mat. 10. 26. 28. Esai, and also Moyses and Iosua, and other seruantes of God haue wel knowne. For this cause they haue diligently admonished the people of Israel not to stande in feare for the power, greatnesse, and multitude of their enemies. Likewise when a man feareth, or is a∣fraide of any thing, he easily forsaketh the duetie of his office, and to doe according to their wil, whome he feareth, and to turne a∣way from God, yea, to be rebellious against him. And for this cause the Lorde often admonisheth his seruantes not to feare men, nor to esteeme their greatnesse. Moreouer, when we are afraide, wee doe not so wel remember to run vnto God, nor to trust in him: but ra∣ther, doe regard & looke vnto natural & carnal meanes, and so run vnto them, and most what returne void of our expectation & hope: and thus we fal and run vnto destruction: and in this sort the snare is brought & set: as we may vnderstand by the scripture, My bowels, my bowels, woe is mee, the transgressours haue offended: yea, Esai. 24. 16 17. & 42. 22. the transgressours haue greeuously offended, feare, and the pit,
and the suare are vppon thee, O inhabitant of the earth. But this people is robbed and spoiled, and shalbe al snared in dungeons, and they shalbe hid in prison houses. The destructiō of thē that through feare haue refuge vnto creatures, is verie well described in the thirtie, and one and thirtie of Esai: and against the Moabites, which trusted in their idolles, Ieremie saieth, O inhabitaunt of Moab, feare, the pit and the snare are vpon thee, saieth the Lord: and Ier. 48. 43. he that flyeth away for feare, shal fal into the pit. For whatsoeuer af∣fliction or aduersitie shal then happen vnto vs, let vs not be dismaid, but with al constancie, folowing our vocation, let vs looke for helpe from aboue. For as a poore feeble beast cannot deliuer himselfe out of the snare, when the same is taken: euen so, can wee not of our¦selues saue vs from the calamities of this worlde, from what part so∣euer they come, but the onely power of the Lorde must deliuer vs from them: as we may see by many examples of the scriptures, and as it is verie plainly expressed in the 124, Psalme. Wherefore, trusting in his goodnesse and power, and saying in our heartes, The Lorde Psal. 118. 6 Psal. 31. 1 & 50. 15 is on our side, I wil not feare what man can doe vnto me, let vs cal vpon him to helpe vs with Dauid, and he wil not fayle to graunt vs our request. For hee promiseth vs, Cal vpon mee in the day of thy trouble, and I wil deliuer thee. And as hee hath promised, so wil hee also perfourme the same faithfully: as diuers Saintes haue tried it by experience. Nowe both folowing of the promise and also experience, Solomon pronounceth, But hee that trusteth in the Lorde, shalbe exalted. Hee compareth trust in the Lorde vnto a strong and high Tower, or vnto so sleepe and so high a rocke that no man can ascende vp to the same, so that if a man can come thi∣ther, hee shalbe out of the dangers of his persecuters. And heerein, hee doeth welshewe vs, that it is in God, that wee ought to put our trust and confidence, if we wil be deliuered from feare, and set out of daunger, and be in safetie. And it is not in this place one∣ly that the scripture vseth this comparison, to teache vs, where we ought to put our trust, but also in diuers other places, it calleth God Psal. 18. 3 & 31. 4. & 71. 1. Pro. 18. 10. a strong and wel fenced Citie, a strong Tower, a Rocke, an high place, and suche like names. The name of the Lorde is a strong Tower, the righteous flyeth vnto it, and is deliuered.
And also without comparison the scripture doth openly declare vs, that if we put our trust in God, we shal not perishe, but shalbe deli∣uered from al dangers. And albeit that in trusting in the Lorde we Psal. 33. & 34. & 91. haue cause to be assured, and to be farre from feare, because we haue an Almightie Sauiour: yet distrusting ourselues, let vs worke out our saluation in feare and trembling, Phil. 2. 12. 26 Many doe seeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord. The Kinges, Princes, Rulers and Superiours of the earth, are of a great Maiestie: as wee ought to vnderstande, when God placeth them in his throne, and that hee calleth them Gods, and sonnes of the most highest. And therefore we must take good heede from ma∣king Psal. 82. 6. the rest of men his companions: for besides this, that we shuld sport and iest with God (the which is in no wise lawful, but ought chiefly to be auoided) we should be in danger to be consumed. For as a litle whelpe thinking to playe with a Lyon, would at the last an∣ger him, hee should be deuoured by him: euen so, a King or a Ruler wil not long delight to haue a person of a meane and lowe state to be his familiar, and as it were his companion. Yea also, though for a certaine time a King hath counted a man for his father, and shal so haue called him, at the last hee wil be grieued, and cause him to be taken: as we haue seene in our time the example therof. The Kings and great Lordes of this worlde, are like vnto wilde beastes, and are Pro. 16. 14. & 19. 12. & 20. 2. compared vnto Lyons, and vnto such as bring the message of death. But albeit they are such, and that there is but too much experiences thereof, yet forasmuche as they counterfaite the magnifical and li∣beral, in giuing great giftes & presents vnto their whores, bawdes, flatterers, and tale bringers, and where there is no neede: for this cause many desiring to goe forwarde and make their profite, and to waxe riche, labour to come neere vnto them, and to please them. And as wee haue seene, many doe bowe before the face of the Prince: and euerie man is friend to him that giueth. And according Pro. 19. 6. hereunto Solomon saieth nowe,
Many doe seeke the face of the Ruler, &c. Thus dooing, they thinke to belitle Kinges, and to be raised vp: but forasmuch as the Kinges heart is in the handes of the Lorde, and that he turneth it as best pleaseth him, wee must not therefore thinke to make our state better, yea, though the Kinges and Rulers did beare vs the best face and countenance in the worlde: for the Lorde turneth the heart of Pro. 21. 1. the King to whatsoeuer pleaseth him. And according thereunto hee saieth now, But euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord. And thus, hee can obteine nothing of the Ruler, whose fauour hee desireth, but what God hath giuen him. The iudgement then in this place, is taken for that, that God hath iudged and sent to eue∣rie man: as it is so taken, Deut. 18. verse 3. What fauour soeuer the great mē of the world do beare vs, let vs take heed vnto the proui∣dence of God, and let vs depende wholly vpon this same: and so dooing, he wil iudge vs, and sende vs suche & so prosperous state, as hee shal knowe to be expedient for vs. 27 A wicked man is abhomination to the iust, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked. Albeit that al men are of one flesh, and of one blood, and that more is, al are created and made like to the image and likenesse of GOD, the which wee ought to haue in great reuerence, and to holde it deare, and for this cause doe wee beare honour one vnto an other, and doe not contemne no man, howe vile and lowe soe∣uer he be before the world: yet there are some which of set malice and of a shameful obstinacie, do drowne themselues in al dissolute∣nesse & leaudnesse, are delighted to despight God, by their misdeeds and transgressions, and to oppresse their neighbours by wrong doo∣ings and cruelties, by polling and pilling, by lying, and slaundering, false swearing and false witnesse bearing: and chiefly rise vp against the weake and feeble, against the simple and innocent. And in this manner, so muche as in them lyeth, they corrupt and put out the image of God in them, and also in their neighbours whom they la∣bour to loose & destroy. And so, they shew themselues wicked and
vngodly, and vnworthie of that image: and therefore they are ab∣hominable before God: as hee hath wel shewed, when hee cursed Caine, destroyed the world by the flood, ouerthrew Sodome and Gomorrhe, and drowned Pharao, & al his armie in the red sea: and that he rooted out the inhabitants of the land of Canaan, before the face of his people: and when by the infidels he tormented the chil∣dren of Israel, and sent them into captiuitie amongst the idolaters: and that nowe they are stil in an horrible confusion. And as we see this same by examples, euen so also may wee knowe it by the testi∣monies of the scriptures: & amongst other places by the curses that God pronounced, and by the threatnings that he maketh in diuers places by his Prophetes. We haue had diuers sentences also there∣of in this booke of the Prouerbes. And as such wicked men are ab∣hominable before God the Lord: euen so are they which giue them¦selues to walke in the right wayes of the Lorde, and delight and take pleasure therein, not wel pleased with these wicked men: but as Solomon saith, A wicked man is abhomination to the iust. And this commeth chiefly, because that the wicked are enemies of God, as is shewed vs. For so farre as they are our enemies, wee must not Leuit. 26. Deut. 27. & 28. Psal. 5. 5. Psal. 139. 19 Mat. 5. 44. hate them, but loue them. Nowe albeit that vpon good cause the wicked are abhominable vnto the iust, & that the wicked ought to be conuerted and to labour to please both God & the iust, which are of a good and vpright conuersation, by the which they bende vnto edification, for to set the wicked in the way of saluation, yet the wicked are hardened and become obstinate in their malice, and doe delight therein, so that of vice they make vertue, and of vertue vice: and in steede that they shoulde loue the iust that giueth them good example, and to doe them honour, and to reuerence them, they abhorre them: as Solomon saieth, adding, And he that is vpright in his way, is abhomination vnto the wicked. Hee speaketh here according to experience. For Cain had not slaine iust Abel, if hee had not hated him and abhorred him. A∣braham, Isaack, and Iacob, were yl intreated of the inhabitantes of the lande of Canaan, because they hated them. Lot suffered the like of the inhabitantes of Sodome. Moses, Dauid, the Prophetes, Iesus Christ & his Apostles were abhorred of the wicked: & also the wicked haue thought to doe good seruice vnto God, by killing the
iust: as stil at this day, they persuade themselues in persecuting them which professe the name of Iesus Christ. But forsomuch as in so do∣ing they iustifie the wicked, and condemne the innocent, & cal euil good, they are therefore cursed, Esai. 5. 20. 23. The xxx. Chapter. The wordes of Agur the sonne of Iaketh. 1 The prophecie which the man spake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal. ACcording to the Hebrews, the fourth part of this booke beginneth at this place: and after the opinion of Aben Ezra, Agur was a man that liued in the time of Solomon, which walked in righteousnesse, experte in know∣ledge, and honourable amongst those of his age: and for this cause King So∣lomon hath inclosed his woordes of wisedome into his booke: and that Ithiel & Vcal were wise men, that were the companions or Disciples of Agur. But R. Leui the sonne of Gerson, saith, that it seemeth, or it is thought howe Solomō was named Agur, because of his words or sentences which he hath comprised in this booke: & that Agur, signifieth a gatherer together: and that he did name himselfe the sonne of Iaketh. Howsoeuer it be, the wordes which are set downe hereafter are called, a Prophecie, or charge, for their excellencie, and conteine verie graue sentences, and of great waight. 2 Surely, I am more foolish then any man, and haue not the vnderstanding of a man in me. Whosoeuer he be that speaketh, either Solomon, or an other, hee speaketh of himselfe in great humilitie, though hee was indewed
with great giftes and graces, and hath vttered excellent sentences, to the great edification of those which consider and lay them vp as they ought. Diuers saints (though they knewe that God did great∣ly esteeme them) did not yet boaste of their greatnesse and excel∣lencie for to tread downe others vnder them: but they haue shew∣wed great humilitie. Abraham might wel knowe, howe greatly Gen. 12. & 13. & 15. & 17. & 18. Gen. 18. 27. & 23. 7 Act. 7. 25 Exo. 4. 10 God esteemed him, by the promises that he had made him: and yet he pronounceth no excellent thing of himselfe, but nameth himselfe pouder and dust: and also doeth humble him before the Hethites. Moses knewe also that God woulde giue deliuerance to the people of Israel by his hand, and yet he confesseth, that he is not sufficient. Dauid knewe that God had caused him to be annointed king ouer the people of Israel, and yet he submitteth himselfe vnto Saule, who was reiected of God. Afrer that the Lorde had declared vnto Hie∣remie, that he had appointed him a Prophet, hee humbleth himselfe saying, he was a childe. Saint Paule knewe that the Lord had coun∣ted him woorthie to be his Apostle, and yet he confesseth that hee was not woorthie to be called an Apostle. And notwithstanding that these holy men haue thus humbled themselues, they haue not ceased to shewe themselues excellent in following boldely and man∣fully their vocation, and doing their office duely. Moreouer also though the personne that speaketh heere, knowing what hee was himselfe, doe greatly humble himselfe, saying: that he is more foolish then any man. Yet for to explicate what he meaneth by foolishnes he addeth, that he hath not the vnderstanding of a man: and for more ample exposition, saith consequently. 3 For I haue not learned wisedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes. And yet for all this, he hath a spirite gorgiously decked with knowledge, both humaine and diuine, and sheweth himselfe very wittie and of a settled, and discreete minde, by the sentences and woordes that shal followe heereafter. And therein he teacheth vs, that our owne mouthes shoulde not prayse vs, as Solomon hath Pro. 27. 2. admonished vs. Hee teacheth vs also, that what giftes, graces, and vertues soeuer wee haue, wee shoulde not extol ourselues aboue
our neighbours, by contenrion and vaineglory: but that through humblenesse of hearte we shoulde esteeme an other man more ex∣cellent then ourselues: as wee are admonished thereof. Phillip. 2. 3. For albeit that wee must esteeme the giftes of God that are in vs, and to make them shine by good doctrine and holy conuersation, yet must wee thinke, they are not giuen vs for to boast of them, nor to extol ourselues aboue our neighbours, but to labor to set foorth the glory of God, and the saluation of our neighbours. Wee shoulde not then presume to haue of ourselues any humane wise∣dome, or knowledge of the saintes, that is to say, of the worde of God, and knowledge thereof, the which may bee called Knowledge of the saintes for diuers causes. Frst of al, because that God giueth the knowledge of his word vnto his elect, whom he sanctifieth and separateth frō the filthines and pollutions, wherevnto the wicked and reprobate are giuen. And by this worde are they sanctified and made saints: Iesus Christ doeth wel shewe it, saying, Sanctifie them by thy trueth, &c. Se∣condly, it may bee called the knowledge of the saints: that is to say, Iohn. 17. 17. of holy things: for there is nothing that maketh vs to be giuen vnto an holy life, & pure and cleane conuersation, but only this word, by the which God declareth vnto vs his wil, which is the rule of al ho∣nes. Thirdly, it may be called, the knowledge of saints, that is to say, of heauēly things, because it bringeth vs to haue our cōuersation in heauen, by faith and hope, and at the ende to haue perfect possession thereof. Wee shal not neede, I say, to presume of ourselues, in this sort though wee bee but fooles before the worlde, which woulde haue vs to praise and boast ourselues, for God shal accept and alowe vs for wise men. For the wisedome of this worlde is foolishnesse before God, & therfore he admonisheth vs saying, Let no man de∣ceiue himselfe: if any man amongst you seeme wise, let him become 1. Cor. 3. 18 19. a foole in this worlde, that hee may bee made wise. It is not enough to say that wee are fooles, brutishe and ignorant, but wee must con∣fesse it, and feele indeede: for if wee haue nothing but the bare worde, and doe not thinke lowly of ourselues, there is nothing but feining and hypocrisie, the which is greatly detestable before God, who demandeth a sincere and vpright heart, and wherevnto the mouth agreeth. Let vs take heede then to be like those who for
to counterfeite the lowly, & repentant, wil with mouth blaspheme, but cānot suffer to heare their faults reproued, but to be reuenged, wil say, they are honest men, and are also good Christians or better then any other: and also wil labour to reuenge themselues vppon them, that take paiues to make them knowe their faultes. 4 Who hath ascended vp to heauen, and descended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fist? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath established all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his sonnes name, if thou canst tell? Agur hath saide himselfe to bee foolishe, and for to expound howe he was suche, he hath declared that hee had neither humane wisdome, nor diuine knowledge. Now for to shewe that none is capable of that whereof he con∣fesseth himselfe to bee destitute, hee maketh many questions, the which are so much as negatiues. And this is for to shew that there is none but God onely, that hath wisedome and vnderstanding, that is mightie and politike, that is wonderful and worthie of great re∣nowme and praise. The first question, (Who hath ascended vp to heauen, and de∣scended?) ought to be vnderstood negatiuely, if we vnderslād it to bee spoken of men. For albeit that some by special priuiledge haue beene translated or rauished vp into heauen, as Enoc, Elias, and Paule: yet it is true that no man euer went vp into heauen or de∣scended of himself. For if we take the heauens for this great heauen∣ly firmament, wee knowe that they are vnaccessible and cannot bee reached: as also Moses doth giue the same something to bee vnder∣stoode, Gen. 5. 24, 2. Kin. 2. 11. 2. Cor. 12. 2. Gen. 1. 1 Deut. 30. 11. 12. saying: For this commandement that I commande thee, this day, is not hid from thee, neither is it farre from thee, nor in hea∣nen, &c. And if wee take the ascending vp into heauen, for the pure knowledge of the mysteries and secretes of God, and for the light of spiritual vnderstanding, which is the true wisedome and knowledge of the saintes: as it is so taken in the 3. Chapter and the 13. verse, of Saint Iohn: No man ascendeth vp to heauen of his owne and naturall vnderstanding, which is brutishe and senselcsse.
For the natural doeth not comprehende the thinges that are of the spirite: there is none but the holy Ghost, who is the spirite of 1. Cor. 2. 14. Christe, which ascendeth vp to heauen, & descendeth from thence. It is hee that is the spirite of wisedome and vnderstanding. And by him the sonne of man Iesus Christ did ascend vp to heauen. No man knoweth the father, but the sonne, who is the Lorde. And wee Esay. 11. 2. Mat. 11. 27. may say that the holy Ghoste descendeth from heauen, when by the worde of God hee teacheth vs al trueth, and guideth vs in the same. The which hee did when Iesus Christe being descended from heauen, tooke our nature, and in the same hath taught vs the wil of God his father, and doeth teache it vs dayly by the Apostles and mi∣nisters that he hath ordeined in his Churche, which are onely the instrumentes of his spirite, who reuealeth vnto vs what wee ought to knowe of God. And when the spirite doeth thus giue vs to knowe the thinges which are of God, it is not to the ende that we 1. Cor. 2. 10. 11. 12. shoulde haue our affections fixed heere. and that wee shoulde bee as it were buried in earth, but as Christe is risen by the glory of God, so shoulde wee walke in newenesse of life, bending and setting all our desires aboue in the heauens: as S. Paul doth admonishe vs thereof. And being so ascended, let vs descende vnto our neigh∣bours without forsaking heauen. The which wee shal doe, if leading Rom. 5. 4. Collo. 3. 12 an honest, holy, and heauenly life, wee occupie ourselues in hea∣ring of holesome doctrines, admonitions, exhortations, and de∣clarations. Thus doing, wee may say with Saint Paule, that our conuer∣sation is heauen. And so albeit that our bodies, yea our whole per∣sons bee on earth, yet are we ascended vp to heauen, & there haue our dwelling by faith and hope. And finally as Iesus Christe is as∣cended aboue al heauens, for to prepare the place for vs, so shal wee rise againe by his power, by the which also wee shal ascende vp to heauen, though none bee ascended: as it is giuen vs to vnderstande by this first interrogation. The seconde, Who hath gathered the winde in his fist? Cannot bee answered affirmatiuely of any man whatsoeuer: for hee hath no power to stay the winde: there is none but God that can vse it at his pleasure: as hee hath created Amos. 4. 13. the winde, so doeth hee holde and locke it vp, as in a treasure house, that it shoulde not blowe, and afterwardes doeth sende it foorth
when hee shal thinke good. There is none then but God that gathereth the winde in his fist? that is to say, which hideth it, and Psal. 104. 4. & 125. 7 Iere. 10. 13 & 51. 15 holdeth it by his power, and then vnlooseth it so softly and smally, so great and vehement as hee pleaseth: and there is no man that hath in any wise the winde at his wil, The Apostles, which were ve∣ry familiar and friendes of Christe, coulde not make the winde to ceasse that tossed them on the Sea: but Iesus rebuked the windes and the Sea, and a great stilnesse and calmenesse followed. And therein hee declared that hee was not onely man, but the sonne of Mat. 8. 26 God also, yea euerlasting and eternal God. Nowe if a man haue not the winde in his power, which is a creature made for his vse, much lesse hath hee power ouer the spirite of God, who is the spirite that onely inspireth into man wisedome and prudence, and indueth him with graces according to the mea∣sure of the giftes of Christe, who hath the fulnesse of this spirite, for to holde the same as it pleaseth him, and also to distribute the same to whom he shal see good: & chiefly to the elect of God his father, which confesse him. And we al haue receiued of his fulnesse, grace for grace. Grace is giuen vnto vs according vnto the measure of the the gift of Christ. Nowe there are diuersitie of giftes: but there is Iohn. 1. 16 Ephe. 4. 7 1. Cor. 12. 4 but one spirite. The thirde, Who hath bounde the waters in a gar∣ment? The waters of their nature that God gaue them in their cre∣ation, couered al the earth: and for the commoditie and vse of man hee hath discouered the earth, making the waters to withdrawe themselues which he hath inclosed in their limites, that they should not passe their bounds without his leaue or commandement: as the Gen. 1. 9 Psal. 33. 7 Iere. 6. 22 Iob. 38. 8. 9 10. 11. Psal. 104. 6 7. 8. 9 Exo. 14. 21 Ios. 3. 15. 16 Eze. 36. 25 Esay. 55. 1 Iohn. 4▪ & 7 Scripture witnesseth. And thus, there is no man that can binde so great an heape of waters with his garment: but God doeth inclose and holde them in at his pleasure: as besides these witnesses of the Scripture, we may see it in the myracles that he wrought in the red Sea, & in the flood of Iordan. And if a man hath not the power to binde in the material & corporal waters, so much the lesse are we capable of the clene waters of the holy Ghost, the which satisfie thē that drinke thereof, and doth fil them with al prudence, wisedome, knowledge and vnderstanding. But as God hath promised them vn∣to vnto vs, so doeth hee exhort and cal vs to drinke them. And as he doth exhort and cal vs, euen so doth he giue them vnto vs by Iesus
Christe, when by faith wee receiue his worde, the which quickneth vnto eternal life: as he doeth assure vs thereof. The fourth, Who hath established all the endes of the earth? It may be answered, that it is neither one man, nor al men together. Mat. 6. 27 & 5. 36. They haue no power to adde one cubite vnto their height, neither to make one haire white or blacke: howe then can they establish the earth at their pleasure or wil? And also the earth is an vncompre∣hensible heauinesse and greatnesse: as the Scripture doeth witnes. But God only creating the earth hath stablished the endes thereof, Iob. 38. 4. 5. 6 and there is none that can augment or diminishe it, it is hee who by his Prophet Esay saith, Who is hee that hath measured the wa∣ters with his fist, &c. Thou hast set al the borders of the earth, thou Esay. 40. 12. Psal. 74. 18. hast made Sommer and Winter. And if wee can neither giue ordi∣nance to the earth, nor establishe her boundes in our handes, so much the lesse can wee handle the wisedome of God which filleth heauen and earth at our pleasure: but wee must acknowledge that wee are bruitishe, and to demande of God the wisedome that is meete for vs. For if hee bee owner of the earth, and the contents thereof, and who hath giuen the same to men, by a more strong rea∣son he giueth wisedome, whereby we are drawne from the earth, and raised vp to heauen. The fifth, What is his name? It is vnpossible to bee named, seeing that (as hath beene saide) the foresaide thinges are not in no mans power whatsoeuer. And thus, man can haue no fame nor praise for the thinges aforesaide. But the mightie God is he alone, that hath al those thinges in his hande: whose name wee knowe not, except hee reueale it vnto vs. For albeit there is no people so barbarous, but knoweth that there is a god, yet whēhe is not glori∣fied as God, nor thanks giuen vnto him, but that the most part of the worlde and almost euery where, they are become vaine in their thoughtes, as saith Saint Paul: by this is shewed that wee know not Rom. 1. 21. his name. To the ende then that hee may bee glorified of vs, let vs worship him alone, in calling vpon him, giuing him thankes, singing foorth his praises, and confessing him to bee authour of al goodnes, and obeiyng him according to his worde in al feare and reuerence. Hee hath declared his name, vnto vs, which is not onely won∣derful,
and worthie that wee shoulde tremble at it, knowing our in∣firmitie, but also therewith that wee shoulde bee assured because of his goodnesse, and loue that hee beareth vnto vs. For as his name is the Almightie, the euerlasting, strong, feareful, taking vengeance, and punishing the wicked and vngodly, that hee is a burning fire, & cōsuming his enimies, and that it is a very feareful matter to fal in∣to the handes of the liuing God: euen so his name, is the God, onely Sauiour, father of mercy, pitiful, patient, slowe to wrath, she∣wing mercy vnto a thousande generations, protectour and defen∣dour of the afflicted, and al them that trust in him. Beholde a very wonderful name as it is hee is heere expressed: but it is far of from being set foorth and described according to the dignitie and excel∣lencie thereof. For there is no vnderstanding that can attaine vnto the perfection of this name: and consequently there are neither mouthes nor tongues that can declare and shew foorth this name, according to the worthinesse thereof. The sixth, And what is his sonnes name, if thou canst tell? If wee knowe not the name of the father, we cannot know the name of the sonne: for the sonnes do oftentimes beare the name of their fathers, euen frō sonne, to sonne that they may boast of the Nobilitie and long continuance of their stocke and linage. Likewise, if the fa∣thers were neuer men of renowme, the children are little regarded to bee knowne. Wherefore, if wee speake heere of men, we may rightly answere, that no man knoweth the name of his sonne, that is ascended vp into heauen: for wee cannot knowe the name of that which cannot bee. And therefore, if wee wil knowe the name of his sonne that is ascended vp into heauen, wee must pul a∣way our regarde from men, and come to God, and hee wyll teache vs the name of his sonne: For none knoweth the sonne but the father. None can come vnto mee except my father drawe him. And Mat. 11. 27. Iohn. 6. 44. & 17. 1. 5. againe, praying vnto the father that hee woulde glorifie him, hee sheweth wel that it is the father that giueth the name of his sonne to bee knowne. And also the sonne, who is the euerlasting worde of the father, is one selfe God with the father. And howe shal wee come vnto the father, seeing hee dwelleth in a light that is vnac∣cessible? Iohn. 1. 1. 1. Tim. 6. 16 For this cause hath hee sent vs his sacred woorde
by his Prophets, Apostles and Ministers, yea by his own sonne, by whom he hath declared his name vnto vs, such as wee haue heard: & also therein he declareth vnto vs the name of his sonne. And first of al, he sheweth him vnto vs, to bee almightie and eternal, when Moses doeth teache vs that God made al thinges in speaking the worde. The heauens were made by the worde of the Lord, &c. Al Gen. 1 Psal. 33. 6 Iohn. 1. 3 Collo. 1. 15 16. 17. Heb. a. 1. Gene. 22. 18. Gala. 3. 8. 16. thinges were made by it, and without it was made nothing that was made, &c. By whome also hee made the worldes. Secondly, he doth shewe him vnto vs, mercifull, and a redee∣mer. And al nations shalbe blessed in thy seede, who is Christ. The Scepter shal not bee taken away from Iuda, nor a law giuer from be∣twene his feete vntil that Silo come: which signifieth the sonne, or Messias. And in Leuiticus, by the Sacrifices, which were figures of the onely sacrifice, by the which hee hath founde eternal redempti∣on, in offering vp himselfe. Thirdly hee sheweth him a Sauiour vnto vs, when hee saueth & deliuereth his people frō Egypt. For this is the angel that guided Gene. 49. 10. Heb. 9. 12. Exo. 13. 21. & 14. 15. Esay. 7. 14. & 9. 6. them, who is called the Lorde: and is called the angel of God. This name of Sauiour is wel expressed, when hee is called Emanuel. And a childe is borne vnto vs, and a sonne is giuen vnto vs, &c. It is also wel expressed in Saint Matthewe the first Chapter, and in Luke the second Chapter. Beholde an excellent and wonderful name, and the which cannot bee comprehended, nor expressed as is wor∣thie. For this cause Saint Paule exalteth him aboue al thinges that Phil. 2. 9. Iohn. 5. 23. may bee named. Wherefore, let vs confesse ourselues brutishe that wee may glorifie God our father: the which wee cannot doe, if we contemne the sonne. For albeit that hee hath so much humbled and abased himselfe, yet God hath not ceassed to giue him al autho∣ritie, al power, al gouernment, and to commit vnto him the saluati∣on of our soules, to the ende that whosoeuer beleeueth in him, should not perish, but be saued by his name. And as we may vnder∣stād in these dictions, and words, God, and Iesus, we must not com∣prehende Iohn. 3. 16. Actes. 4. 12. the name of the father and the sonne, but in the diuine and euerlasting power, in the goodnesse, righteousnesse, trueth and mercy.
5 Euery worde of God is pure: he is a shielde to those, that trust in him. We neither wil nor can vnderstande what God is towards vs: & for this cause, when he speaketh vnto vs, wee beleeue him not, nor make account of his word, no more or lesse then of tales and fables. And when he offereth himself vnto vs to helpe vs, to defende & to deliuer vs, we do no more trust him then the most miserable man in the world. And albeit that he might iustly reiect vs, cast vs of, con∣demne and destroy vs for our malice & vngratitude, yet taking pitie vpon vs, he yeldeth himself vnto vs & beareth with our rudenes, & dissembleth & wil not know our malice and ingratitude. And for to do this he speaketh vnto vs, not in his almightie and high maiestie, but by similitudes that are familiar: and amongst other, for to teach vs that when he speaketh to vs, we ought greatly to praise his word, and to hold it true and infallible, without any douting, & also that it should be our chiefest delight, he compareth his word vnto siluer that is throughly purified & clensed frō al his drosse, & whose good∣nes & purenes may easily be knowne. And now the wise man doth Psal. 12. 7. & 18. 31. & 119. 14. the like, saying, Euery word, &c. Not that we can find any thing, in this worlde howe precious soeuer it is, that is worthy to haue the word of God to be compared vnto him: for it surmounteth infinitly & beyond reason, al things which are and that may be ymagined to be excellent and precious. Also there is nothing in this worlde how precious soeuer it is, but doth participate with the earth, & needeth Psal. 119. 21 127. 162. Pro. 3. 13. to be purged and clensed frō his drosse and superfluities: before hee can be pure and cleane: but the word of God is pure and cleane of it selfe, and neither hath nor can haue any drosse: for it proceedeth not from a fornace and fyning pot, but from the mouth of GOD, which neither can, nor wil bring forth any worke, but shalbe so per∣fect as it ought to be, & wherein nothing may be amended. Wher∣fore when it is said, is pure purged, or tryed as it were in the fire, e∣uen as we purifie and try golde or siluer, it is not to say that at any time it hath beene in tangled or mixed with any filthines or super∣fluities, but only that it is vnfallible, true and faithful, and shoulde in no wise feare to beleeue our God, when he speaketh vnto vs by his scripture, by his seruants, Prophetes, Apostles, Pastours, & Doctors,
but that his worde shoulde be very precious and deere vnto vs, as the worldlings make great account of gold and siluer, of Iewels & precious stones when al those thinges are throughly purged from their superfluities and filthinesse: and so at the least let vs giue so much honour vnto our God, when it pleaseth him to speake vnto vs, and to offer vs his gifts and spiritual graces, his fauour and mer∣cy by his worde, as do the worldlings giue vnto goldsmiths whome they esteeme, to bee no deceiuer: and that we may say with an vn∣fained heart with Dauid. The lawe of the Lorde is perfect, restoring Psal. 19. 8. the soule, &c. If wee giue not thus much honour vnto the worde of GOD, albeit that of it selfe it is purified siluer, wee turne the same, so much as in vs lyeth, into brasse, yron, and lead, yea into drosse, and so to our destruction. And as the worldlings reioyce, & take great delight, when they are wel furnished with golde and sil∣uer throughly fined, and with very precious iewels: euen so ought Psal. 119. 14 our delight to bee in the worde of God, for to cleaue theretoo by faith and conuersation, so that wee may say, I haue delighted in the way of thy statutes, more then in al riches. In this sorte, as the riche which enioy their pleasures, are esteemed before the world to be happie, euen so shal wee bee happie and blessed before our God when our ioy shalbe in his word. Furthermore, when men are fur∣nished, Psal. 1. 2. with riches, they so glorifie and reioice, that they perswade themselues to be out of danger of their enimies, and do promise to themselues that none euil shal come to them. For they thinke they haue wherewith to withstand them and to defende themselues, and are strongly fortified: as Solomon hath pronounced, the riche mans Pro. 10. 15. goods are his strong citie. And if they haue such trust in their riches which are vaine and transitorie, by amore strong reason, when the euerlasting, & the liuing God doth giue himself vnto vs, both him∣selfe & al his riches by his worde which indureth for euer, we must wel vnderstand & marke what he saith vnto vs, & to be fully assnred therof, without any doute: for as it is written, He is a shielde to thē that trust in him. Whereunto the wise man agreeth in this present Psal. 18. 31. sentence. Wherin we are taught to feare nothing that may hurt vs: for we haue a good shield for to withstand al aduersarie and contra∣ry power, & to ouerthrow & confound thē. And forasmuch as God is our buckler & shield, we are admonished to shew ourselues strōg
and valiant. For as a buckler is not profitable in the hand of a feeble and weake child, of a slouthful, cowardly and faintharted souldiour: euen so except we be strong, diligent, & stoute, it is but in vaine that we shal cal God our shield. And therfore S. Paule doth admonish vs vs, Finally, my brethren be strong, in the Lord, & in the power of his Ephe. 6. 10. might, &c. Moreouer, when it is expresly said, to those that trust in him, let vs vnderstand that as the vnbeleeuing do despise God, euen so doth he despise & cast them of, and giueth them vnto Sathan. For this cause S. Peter doth admonish vs to withstand him, being strōg 1. Pet. 5. 9. in the faith: and in this sorte we shal obtaine victorie. 6 Put nothing vnto his wordes, least he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer. Moses hauing admonished the people of Israel to heare & to kepe the ordinances and statutes that he taught them to do: for to shew the people what obedience, submission and straight obseruatiō they ought vnto those ordinances: he saith, Ye shal put nothing vnto the Deut. 4. 2. word, that I command you, &c. This is that which he sheweth thē, that God for to try our obedience, wil not haue vs to runne by vn∣knowne & crooked wayes, for to runne crosse the fieldes, to deuise what we shal thinke good: but that he wil hold vs as it were boūde and tyed wholy vnto his word, and should know that the same is al our wisedome, and that we must not bee learned for to mingle any thing with the word of God: but should make this conclusion, for∣asmuch as God hath spoken vnto vs, it is not lawful therefore for mortal men to enterlace any thing therein, whatsoeuer: but should be cōtented to haue heard such a maister. But there is nothing worse kept then is this for men thinke alwaies to haue in them some rea∣son, and to be able ynough to gouerne themselues. Nowe this is a great pride, when men wil discerne betwene good and euil, yea after their owne fantasie: & contrarily God wil be esteemed alone wise for vs, and that we shoulde be as poore sheepe, hearing the voice of their shephearde, and that we shoulde forget this ablenesse that the vnbeleuing ymagine to haue: that we should know, Oh, there is nothing in vs but error & foolishnes, there is nothing but vanitie & lying in vs, vntil that God haue taught vs. And as when it is said: Ye shal put nothing thereto, this is for to shewe vs that God only is
wise, and hath authoritie to rule vs, and should learne to holde this simplicitie: to wit, that we should be only wise for to obey what he commandeth vs, that he may haue al preheminence: euen so whē he forbiddeth, to take any thing frō this word, it is not without cause. For if we wil partly and in somethings obey God, and notwithstan∣ding would exempt ourselues from what we thought good, behold such a partaking should neuer bee receiued, as there are many which wil bee content to obey that which shal not bee too grieuous and sore for them: but if there be once a thing that troubleth them, they straight wayes desire to be discharged, & do contemne the same. But whosoeuer keepeth al the law, if he breake but one point, yet is hee Iam. 2. 10. giltie of al. Heereunto agreeth the wise man: for hauing commēded the word of God vnto vs, in attributing there too purenes & fayth∣fulnes, dignitie and excellencie, saying that it is purified as golde or siluer is purified: hauing also attributed vnto God, that hee is our force, defender and protector, saying, that he is their shielde that put their trust in him: for to shew vs, that this only purenes & excellen∣lēcie, ought to suffice vs, & that we should ymagine no other truth, nor to labor to faine any other excellent thing besides this worde: and also for to shew vnto vs, that this worde is so excellent and pre∣cious, that it wil not suffer any mixture: and that thereby God cer∣tifieth vs sufficiently of the helpe, defence and protection that hee giueth vnto them which receiue this worde with assurance, he ad∣monisheth vs saying, Put nothing vnto his wordes. Hee saieth not, and take nothing from them: albeit that we must vnderstande, that as we ought to put nothing there too, so must wee not also take any thing from it: but the wise man woulde defende, and chiefly forbid that wherein wise, holy and deuout men in their owne sight doe most reioyce, and challenge merite: as Monkes and Nunnes, which bragge of their workes of supererogation, by the which they per∣swade themselues that they merite and deserue both for themselues and for other, for that, that they doe more (as they thinke) then is commanded them. But this their bragging and boasting is against their owne conscience. For if they haue seruantes or maydes which doe more then they are commaunded, they wil say, that they are seruantes for the Deuill, because they doe more then they are commanded. Wherevppon followeth, that so farre it
is of that by their workes of supererogation (as they cal them) they deserue any thing of God, that rather, they forsake and renounce him for their Lord and maister, and doe auouche the Deuil for their maister, whome they serue as may be iudged by their own mouths. Therefore if the wise man forbiddeth that which is praise worthy before men, which forget their duetie, by a more strong reason let vs vnderstande that hee closely forbiddeth that which is euil without contradiction and gaine saying. For albeit that al men by their natu∣ral corruption doe take from the words of God, in not giuing vnto him perfect obedience, in not trusting onely in him altogither, yet there is no man whose conscience doeth not condemne, that it is ill done to diminishe and take from the wordes of God. The wiseman therfore laboureth to make vs forsake our own wisedom, the which is both a foule folly, and also detestable & abhominable before God, and would not haue vs to mingle it with the worde of God, which is so pure and cleane, so faythful and true. By this foule wisedom and foolish rebellions and ouerweening, we iudge that the word of God is but a smal matter, that it is too simple & plaine, and that it is of no great shew or apparance. And therfore by this wisedome, eyther we despise & refuse the word of God, or for to helpe him, or for to giue it more goodly shew, we bring in our deuotions and fantasies, our traditions and customes, thinking in this sort to haue a more strong staye, then if we did stand to the simple and plaine worde of God, and to be better armed and fenced, then if we were contented that God only should be our buckler and shielde. In which doing we do outragiously misuse our God, who only is most good & most migh∣ty, and treade vnder feete holy things and precious pearles, to wit, his word so excellently purified. And in this manner wee make our¦selues exceeding giltie and reproueable, not before the wise world∣lings, who in this matter doe wel allowe vs, but before God, who knoweth the heartes, and searcheth the raines. And also hee wil not faile nor misse to reprooue those which are so arrogant to put to his worde: for euen when they put and adde too, they doe then take from it, not yelding him the honour, that belongeth vnto him, nei∣ther rendering the obediēce they owe vnto him. For there are none of those braggers but wil omitte many things, and sinne fowly also in diuers things. And those that we shal esteeme the most holy and
most deuout, are commonly the foulest and most stincking, so that we may place them in the number of them which are reprooued & rebuked, in the Psal. 50. ver. 16. And also the wise man placeth thē in the like order, saying, least hee reprooue thee: adding theretoo the cause, & thou be found a lyer. For it is asmuch as if he said, God on∣ly is truth, and his word is only true: wherfore thou must trust vnto it, and not presume to adde vnto his word. For albeit that for a cer∣taine time he dissemble & wincke at it, yet at the last he wil reproue thee, and conuince thee of lying and falshoode. For hee that presu∣meth to adde vnto this pure and vnfallible truth, is alyer: not only because he putteth forth trifles for to obscure and darken the truth, but also that he reproueth God of lying, and so much as in him ly∣eth doth make the trueth nothing worthe, when hee hath mingled therwith, the fantasies and inuentions of his owne head. And thus, he rightly deserueth to be reproued and rebuked, yea with sore and grieuous punishment: wherewith the lyers are threatened. Psal. 5. 7. 7 Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye. Albeit that he which speaketh heere, hath called himself brutish, confessing what he was of himself, yet we see here that he was very wise and wel learned, when he knew that it was to God, to whome he ought to direct his prayers, in confessing him to be the authour, and also giuer of al good things, and that no where else we can finde nothing that is any thing worth or obtaine it. And knowing this, he sheweth himselfe very discreete, when hee directeth himselfe vnto God, who hath promised to helpe and to succour those which shall require him in truth that he wil heare them, giuing them according vnto their requestes when time requireth it, and as shalbe expedi∣ent. The which promise is enclosed in the couenant that the Lorde made with Abraham And in performing of this promise, hee hath prouided for the generation of Abraham, for to deliuer them from Gen. 12. 33. & 13. 14. 15 & 17. 7. 8. Gen. 4. 7. 8. Exo. 2. 23. 24. & 3. 4. their bondage and afflictions: he sent Ioseph before thē into Egypt, for to feede them in the time of famine. When they groned and la∣mented vnder the tyrannie of Pharao, God remembred this coue∣nant, and prouided for them a deliuerer: And not only then, but also in al their necessities: when they cryed vnto God in sure trust, he suc∣coured
thē at their neede, as we may see in the holy histories, & by the care that he had to sent thē his seruāts the Prophets. The which Dauid doeth wel acknowledge. The wise man then looking & tru∣sting Psal. 22. 5. 6. & 34. 5. 6. 7. 8. in this couenant, doth direct his request vnto God, saying vn∣to him, Two things haue I required of thee. When he saith, I haue required, and that againe he requireth the same: he sheweth that he was neither cold nor madde, neither light nor vnpatient to looke for the helpe and assistance of God, but that his hearte was feruent and through great and inuincible constancie he perseuered in prayer & patience, looking for his good pleasure, nothing distrusting but that he should obtaine his request: as he doth wel shew, when he is not grieued nor wearied to cōtinew his prayer: the which he could not do, if he distrusted God. And therewith by this continuation hee sheweth that he beleueth and knoweth how God only is the author of al goodnes, and howe we must not seeke for that which is profi∣ble or necessary for vs elsewhere, or of any other: and also this word thee, doeth shew it. For it is asmuch as if hee saide, for to obtaine whatsoeuer I shal need, I should not runne vnto the creatures, how holy and worthy soeuer they be: but as I beleue that thou art Cre∣atour of al things, euen so I beleeue that of thy power, goodnesse, and prouidence, thou onely gouernest thy creatures, giuing vnto them, whatsoeuer thou knowest to bee expedient vnto them: and therefore, it is thou only, who hast the power and the wil to helpe, and to graunt my request, that I haue alreadie required. And as hee doeth expresse, his request tendeth to obtaine twoo thinges: also twoo things chiefly are very necessarie for vs, for this present life: to wit, an holy and pure conuersation, and riches for to sustaine the outwarde man, that wee may be strong for to do our office. It may seeme after a sorte, that Iacob making his vowe vnto God deman∣deth Gene. 28. 20. of him these twoo thinges, that is to say holy conuersation, when he saith, If the Lord God wil be with me, & keepe me in the way that I shal walk: & wil giue me bread to eate, & clothes to put on, &c. True it is, he desireth the helpe, defence and protection of God, but vnder the same wee may comprehend holy conuersation, for it followeth the helpe of God. Nowe the wise man knewe very well that these two things are necessatie for vs in this temporal and transitory life: and therefore he requireth, saying,
Deny me not them, before I dye. When after hauing sayde, I haue required, he addeth, Deny me them not. He continueth stil his request, not by distrust or doubte that he hath, howe God will not heare him, but rather for to signifie and confesse that al riches both temporal and spiritual come from God alone, and that if he shoulde deny them vnto vs, there is none that can doe vs any good, neither can obtaine any thing healthful for vs. The holy fathers did wel vn∣derstande this: as they doe declare, when they doe, as it were im∣portunatly complaine of the absence of God, & that they demande, hee woulde arise, and woulde shewe his face, and that hee woulde not hide himselfe, nor be farre from them. He sheweth also, that hee prayeth with an earnest affection, without fayning, and that he fee∣leth trulie and indeede howe he had greate neede that God shoulde assist and helpe him. For also euery man of himselfe, wanteth what∣soeuer is necessarie for him: but there are none but the faithful which feele it truly: and therefore they pray with a true affection of hearte. Forasmuch as it is necessarie for vs in this life, to walke holi∣ly, and to haue victualls and foode: and that after our decease and departure we cannot giue remedie, and amende that which we haue done amisse, and that the dead do nothing participate with the li∣uing: Therfore the wise man requireth that God would graunt vn∣to Eccle. 9. 6. him that which he requireth, before he die. Wherein wee ought to learne, that wee must not eate our bread with ydlenesse, but to spende our time in good workes, the which wee shoulde labour to obtaine by praiers and requestes: for of ourselues wee can doe no∣thing: It is God that worketh both the wil & the deede, euen of his good pleasure. And because that the dayes of man are short & that Phil. 2. 13. he vanisheth away as doeth the grasse, and that there is none that knoweth certainly either the day or the houre of his departing out of this life, we are taught that if we wil do wel before we dye, wee must not deferre nor put of from day to day, but with al care and di∣ligence to giue ourselues vnto goodnes, what age soeuer we haue: and that in working, wee shoulde not chalenge any thing vnto our free wil, or free choice, as if we had power of ourselues to gouerne vs: but we must confesse that it is the grace and mercie of God that guideth vs: as the wise man doeth shewe vs in this request, by the which he asketh twoo things, the which he now declareth, saying,
8 Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine estate. When he saith that God hath created man vnto his likenesse & ymage, we ought to vnderstande that man at the beginning of his Gene. 1. 27. creation was pure and cleane, was wise, vpright, and true: as S. Paul also doeth giue vs the same to vnderstande, hauing admonished vs, to mortifie our earthly members, &c. He woulde haue vs to put on Col. 3. 5. 10. 12 the newe man, which is renewed by the knowledge of God after the ymage of him that hath created him, &c. And for to shewe vs howe we should conserue this ymage in the knowledge of God, he doth admonish vs: Nowe therfore as the elect of God, holy and Ephe. 4. 22. beloued, put on tender mercy, kindnesse, humblenesse of minde, meekenesse, long suffring, &c. And according heereunto, hee exhor∣teth vs, to cast of, concerning the conuersation in time past, the olde man, which is corrupt through the deceiuable lustes, &c. But men by their pride & ingratitude are turned away from this knowledge, and haue contemned it, as a vaine thing: and in steade that they were made excellent of God, they are concerning themselues as beastes: and in place that God had made them vpright, they haue Eccle. 3. 18. & 7. 30. sought many inuentions, by the which they haue cast of the vp∣rightnesse and excellencie, that consisted in righteousnes, wisedom, holinesse and trueth. And beeing thus spoiled, in steede that they shoulde haue humbled themselues, and bee confounded and asha∣med, they haue thought themselues to be wise: they haue cōmended themselues as if they were saintes, righteous and true: but they are become vaine, foolish, yea madde and lyers: so that it is not without cause why the scripture maketh diuers complaints of it. And in this sort they haue throwne themselues into death, from the which they in no wise of themselues rise againe, neither also wil bee raised: for Psal. 4. 3. & 39. 6. & 62. 10. & 116. 11. it is to the same that their corrupt nature doeth wholy tende, and take his delight. Nowe because we desire not death, but do feare it, and woulde gladly shunne it, and cannot of ourselues, therefore it is necessarie for vs to aske of God, that he woulde purifie and clense vs from that which bringeth vs death: that is to say, frō our sinnes
and misdeedes: (the which the wise man comprehendeth vnder va∣nity and lying) and for the which we pray with him: Remoue farre from me, &c. Wherin first of al he sheweth vs, that if we wil truely pray vnto God, we must confesse our sinnes vnto him: as doeth the wise man, requiring that it might please God to remoue farre from him vanitie and lying. And in this maner he confesseth that hee is brutish, and that if God did not take mercy vpon him, he should be nothing but vaine, foolish, and to change the glorie of the incorrup∣tible Rom. 1. 23. God, into the similitude of the ymage of a corruptible mā. The which conteineth lying: for being ydolaters, we do falsly vsurpe the name of God, giuing the same vnto ydols. And for this cause also, the wise man hath ioined vanitie and lying together, & maketh but one thing of them both, the which is the first of the twoo thinges that hee putteth into his request. And also it is good reason that we should be careful first of al to serue God, and to yeld vnto him only, the honor and the glory which belongeth vnto him. And the same wel to beginne, we must abhorre ydolatrie: the which is heere sig∣nified by vanitie & lying. And also the Prophets do cal ydols, vani∣tie Esay. 41. 44. 29. & 44. 20 Iere. 2. 5. 11. & 10. 3. 14. 15. & 14. 22. & 51. 17. 18 Rom. 1. 24. and lying: though they vse not the like wordes: yet those which they vse, are of like signification. Nowe it is not without cause that vnder vanitie, (which with vs, is ydolatrie) we should comprehend al sinnes: for it doth beget them and bring them forth. In al ages, & amongst al nations we haue seene, and may yet stil see, that the ydo∣laters (euen those which are the deuoutest) do giue themselues vn∣to dishonestie, filthinesse & vncleannesse, vnto oppression and cru∣cltie, euen with an vnbrideled lust and desire. And the Prophets also doe make great complaintes therof, and doe reproche the ydolaters that they haue forsaken God, and that they haue their handes full of blood. If then wee wil beginne earnestly to serue God, wee must beginne first to hate ydolatrie, folowing the doctrine that Iacob gaue to his houshold, and God in the beginning of his lawe. Not∣withstanding we might say that vanitie is the corruption and wic∣kednesse Gene. 352. Exo. 20. 3. 4. wherein we are borne, and that it is rooted in vs from our conception: the which vanitie, if wee yelde vnto, and obey, bringeth foorth his fruite: to wit, lying, eyther in wordes or deedes, or false∣hoode. The which fruite man bringeth foorth to the dishonour of God, and hurte of his neighbours: to wit, when hee is become an
hypocrite and ydolater: afterwardes vaine swearing, blaspheming, periurie, manifest contemning and scorning of the trueth, and holy Religion: when he is become a false witnesse, slandering, flattering, and a taleteller, and to counterfait & to shadow things to deceiue: and also when he doth not vnto his neighbor as he would be done vnto. And thus, the wise man desireth to be purified from al the in∣ward and outward transgressions that hee shall commit against the lawe of God. And because that euil wordes corrupt good maners, 1. Cor. 15. 33 we haue neede not onely that vanitie which is in vs, and falshoode that wee commit, should be remoued far from vs, but also that wee should flye and auoide al euil and naughtie tongues, and all wicked men in their trades, and that we should aske of God to giue vs fel∣lowship of wholesome words and holy conuersation. The seconde thing, he requireth, is, giue mee not pouertie, &c. After that the wise man hath required what is necessarie for the life of the soule, he asketh such things as are necessarie for the body, the which wee may lawfully demande. For albeit that Iesus Christ doeth shewe vs by diuers argumentes and reasons that wee ought not to care for Mat. 6. 25. foode nor other corporal necessities of this life, and that hee doeth admonishe vs to seeke first of al the kingdome of God & the righ∣teousnesse thereof: yet neuerthelesse hee doeth not thereby forbid that we shoulde not aske and seeke for our corporal necessaries: o∣therwise he would not teach vs to pray vnto God our father for to giue vs our dayly bread: neither also should any man haue neede to til & plowe the earth, to plant, to sowe, to gather & lay vp in sellers & garners, the fruites that the earth hath brought forth. It is then lawful for vs to aske things at Gods hāds, that are necessarie for our bodies: as we haue seene heeretofore howe Iacob hath demanded them: but yet it must bee done without care, and without distrust: and that we should know that as the earth is the Lords, so doth the same obey him, bringing forth his fruites according as he comman∣deth it: and thus, we can haue no foode, but so much as it pleaseth God to giue vs therof, yea though we labour. For he which labou∣reth, or he that watereth, is nothing: but God that giueth the in∣crease. Wherfore we must knowe that it is not onely laweful for vs 1. Cor. 3. 7. to aske and seeke for our bodily necessities, but also it is necessarie, (in humbling ourselues and confessing that all riches come vnto
vs from the bountifulnesse and liberalitie of our heauenly father) we shoulde not be vnthankful, but that without dissimulation wee should giue him thankes therfore. Nowe that wee may rightly aske and seeke for such thinges of him, as are necessarie for vs, wee must not folow the desires of our flesh, the which is vnsatiable, but to cō∣tent ourselues with mediocrite, as the wise man doeth shewe vs, in this present text, the which conteineth three members. The first is, he requireth that God woulde not giue him pouertie. Wherein there seemeth to be an absurditie. For albeit that he confesseth (as it may seeme) that pouertie is giuen of God, yet is it there refused, where it ought to be precious, if it be a gift of God: and also to con∣sider howe God hath alwaies had the poore in great estimation, & hath exalted many of them: and also Iesus Christ saith that to them Mat. 5. 3. & 25. 40. belongeth the kingdome of heauen: likewise hee calleth them his brethren. Heereunto we answere, that as a childe saith to his father giue me no rods: euen so the wise man calleth pouertie, the gift of Gen. 3. 17. 18 Leui. 26. 14. Deut. 28. 15 Prou. 6. 9. God, and requireth that God woulde not giue him pouertie. And this is because he knoweth that pouertie is a rodde, yea a curse that God sendeth in the world for the sinnes thereof. And albeit that we must patiently beare pouertie, when God giueth it, and neuer the more to thinke that God hateth vs, no more then a good and wise father hateth his childe, when he giueth him roddes: as we are well taught it, when God by his woorde so diligently commendeth the poore, as hath beene alledged sometimes. And although that Saint Paule saith, Rom. 8. 35. That neither hunger nor nakednesse shal se∣parate vs from the loue of Christ: and that in pouertie we must nei∣ther be discouraged nor despaire: yet is it lawful to auoide the same, by the meanes that God teacheth vs by his woorde, the which are labour, and prayer. For albeit that labour is ordeined of God, yet shal it not profite any thing, except God himselfe doe blesse it, the Gene. 2. 15 & 3. 17. Ephe. 4. 28. 2. Thes. 3. 6. Psal. 50. 15. which we must obtaine by prayer: as he doth teache vs, when hee sayth, Call vpon me in the day of thy trouble, and I wil deliuer thee. Whereunto the wise man nowe agreeth, when he runneth to God, beseeching him, that he woulde not giue him pouertie. Thus pray∣ing he requireth priuily that God woulde graunt him grace that he might be able to labour, and that he woulde blesse his trauaile, the which otherwise, shoulde be vaine and of no profite. Wee see then
there is no absurditie in the request of the wise: but that it is lawe∣ful for vs to make the like request: as also Iesus Christ doeth teache Mat. 6. 11. vs, when he woulde haue vs to aske our dayly bread. The seconde is, hee asketh that God woulde not giue him riches. Wherein it might seeme at the first sight, that hee woulde rebuke riches, and reiect them, as if they were euil and hurtful: but if his intent were such, it shoulde be euil: seing that God hath created riches, and gi∣ueth them to whome he thinketh good for to make them to pros∣per: as he did to Abraham and other Patriarkes, to Dauid and other kings, to Iob and to diuers other: and also the scripture calleth ri∣ches a blessing: as hath beene already alledged diuers times. There∣fore it is not the minde of the wise man to refuse riches, as euill things: for in so doing, hee shoulde do iniurie to God: but the wise man did distrust himsef, and knewe that he was of the same nature, that were many more which had abused, and did abuse the riches of the world in diuers sortes, to the dishonour of God, to their owne hurte, and also the contempt and hurt of their neighbours. For the riche men of the world do often abuse their riches vnto ydolatrie: for the which to maintaine they wil spare nothing: as may be seene in the making of the molten Calfe, and when it is saide that the ymages of the heathen are but siluer and golde (albeeit it is Exo. 32. 3. Psal. 115. 4. 1. King. 11. 7. & 12. 28. saide for to shewe the vnprofitablenesse and the vanitie of ydolls, and the foolishnesse of ydolaters) and Solomon built an high place for Camos the abhominable ydol of the Moabites, &c. And Iero∣boam made twoo golden calues. And nowe also and at all times wee may see amongest the Papistes, howe the riche doe spate no∣thing for to mainteine their seruice, which they cal diuine. They abuse riches also vnto their owne hurte, when they distrust GOD, and put their trust in their riches. For so doing, they depriue them∣selues of the kingdome of God, as the riche haue done. Final∣ly, they abuse them, to the contempt and hurte of their neighbour. Mat. 19. 23. Luke. 12. 19. & 16. 19. Iames. 2. 6. & 5. 4. 1. Tit. 6. 9. 10 17. 18. 19. For they care not to helpe them, as the twoo foresaide: but rather do oppresse them. S. Paule hath comprehended these three abuses, from the which he woulde haue the riche (with out forsaking their riches) to turne away. Therefore when the wise man saith, Giue mee not riches, &c. Hee doeth not condemne them, but hee protesth that hee hath not set his hearte vppon them: and
prayeth vnto God, as Dauid did, Encline my heart vnto thy testimo∣nies, Psal. 119. 36 and not to couetousnesse. For except that God himselfe giue helpe, it is an ordinarie thing to be giuen vnto couetousnesse, euen from the least vnto the most. Ierem. 6. 13. The thirde is, that hee requireth that God woulde feede him with the breadmeete for his estate. Wherein hee desireth accor∣ding Mat. 6. 11. to that which Iesus Christ doeth teache vs to say, Giue vs this day our daily bread. And therewith wee must bee contented, as Saint Paule doeth teache vs. Wherein wee are taught, that euery man shoulde carefully and faithfully imploy himselfe and labour in his vocation: otherwise he shal not bee maintained with the bread meete for his estate: that is to say, of the foode that God hath pre∣pared and appointed for him: but of the bread of other men: and so, he shal exceede. For heere, the state is not taken after the maner of worldlinges, who commit greate abuses for to maintaine their state. The worde that is heere translated, state, commeth of a verbe which signifieth, to ordeine and appoint. And so, when it is saide. Maintaine mee with the bread meete for my state: it is not to say, according as I thinke to belong vnto mee, because of my highnesse and power, or of worthinesse and excellencie: but as the bread that wee eate iustly, wee cal ours, because God doeth giue it vs, and maketh it ours by his grace: euen so doe wee cal the bread that God ordeineth for vs, the bread of our state, and of the which we may iustly and lawfully eate without doing hurte to other. Now by the discourse of the former wordes, wee may see, howe the wise man hath asked of God holy and cleane conuersation, and wealth wherewithal to liue, which are twoo thinges very necessa∣rie for this present life: as hath beene handled, in the 7. verse. For if our heartes bee purified from vanitie, and our mouthes clensed from lying tales, as the wise man desireth, the rest of the actions and workes of man wil bee pure and cleane. And also that the wise man hath desired holy conuersation, he sheweth, by the reasons follow∣ing, when he saith:
9 Least I be ful, and denye thee, and say, who is the Lord? or least I be poore, and steale, and take the name of my God in vaine. According as the wise man was the sonne of Adam, hee was of the same vicious and corrupted nature, aswel as other, the which he knewe wel ynough: and therefore distrusting himselfe, he feared least he shoulde fal into the enormities which are dayly committed by the word, whereby the wrath and anger of God is prouoked, and so come to destruction. Nowe hee sawe that the riche men were al∣waies ful, and filled themselues: that is to say, that they enioyed, so much as they coulde, their worldly and carnal delightes and plea∣sures, and wallowed in filthinesse, pollutions, and abhominations, with an vnbrideled lust, in taking their delightes and pleasutes, in sleeping and resting, in gluttonie and drunkennes, in whoredome & committing other shameful actes. For the which things God made his wrath to fal vpon them, sending a flood of waters vppon all the earth: making fire and brimstone to raine from heauen vppon So∣dome: sodainely killing of the riche glutton (Luke the 12.) who boasted of his abundance: and condemning the riche into hell, of whome Luke speaketh in his 16. Chapter. When these men were at their ease, because of the abundance of wealth and riches they had, therefore they made no account of any admonitions, declarations, and threatenings: as may be knowne in that that they amended not their lines, when Noe, the Ambassador of righteousnes, condemned them by building of the Arke: and when the Zodomites dayly affli∣cted, the soule of righteous Lot: also when poore Lazarus ful of sores, lay at the rich mans gate. In this manner they denyed God by deede: & though they had not at al opened their mouthes, yet had they in great contēpt & scorning said at the least in their harts, who is the Lord? Whereunto Iob agreeth, where hee accuseth the riche which say vnto god, depart frō vs, for we wil none of the knowledge Iob. 21. 14. 15 Esa. 29. 15. 16. & 5. 19. of thy wayes: and Esay, Woe to those dreamers, which hide their counsel from the Lord: & say, who seeth vs? &c. Who saith, let him hasten his worke. For this interrogation, Who is the Lorde?
is asmuch as negation: to wit, that there is no Lorde. The which negation agreeth wel with the riche of this worlde, that are coue∣tous: Ephe. 5. 5. Col. 3. 5. for they are ydolaters. And forasmuch as they are ydolaters, they denye that there is a Lorde, if it bee not by wordes, yet it is with heart and deede, when they place their wealth and felicitie in riches which are of no continuance. And therefore we may vnder∣stande that it is not without cause that Iesus Christ doeth pro∣nounce woe, and that Saint Paule doth depriue them of the king∣dome of heauen. Therfore when man, which is left vnto himself, is Luke. 6. 24. 1. Cor. 6. 10. so vnreasonable, that for transitorie and vaine riches he wil deny the euerlasting and almightie God, and loose his kingdome, it is not without cause why the wise man requireth of God, giue mee not riches. Hee sawe also that the poore did suffer much in this worlde. For they haue nothing wherwith to sustaine themselues, neither do they finde any that wil helpe their need, as they would gladly finde some. And because they set more store by their panches and bel∣lies, then by the lawe of God, which saith, thou shalt not steale, they forget this lawe, and giue themselues vnto stealing, labou∣ring to perswade themselues it is laweful to take something where they can finde it. I say expresly, labouring, and not beleeuing. For if they beleeued that it were lawful to robbe, they woulde not hide themselues: and also when they shoulde be demanded, they would freely confesse the theeuerie and robberie: but to couer themselues they are faine to bee forsworne, taking the name of God in vaine. The which the wise man feared, should happen vnto him, as he doth declare. And albeit hee addeth not, that it is in vaine, yet it neither ought nor can be vnderstoode otherwise, then to say the truth. For commonly theeues are more ready to sweare falsly, then to speake trueth. And also, forasmuch as God willeth and commandeth that we should sweare by his name, when we haue neede, therefore the wise man woulde not feare to take the name of his God, if it were not in vaine. Besides this, let vs learne twoo things. The first is, That when the wise man feareth to bee poore, least hee shoulde steale, and to be periured: he teacheth poore men to require of God patience and a contented minde, that they may forbeare to steale: & that this is the principall, that they may beware from taking
the name of God in vaine. For as God wil not holde him innocent, that taketh his name in vaine, euen so theeues shal not inherite the 1. Cor. 6. 11 kingdome of heauen. And thus the robbers haue not onely men a∣gainst them, but also they fal into the handes of the liuing God, the which is an horrible and feareful thing. The second, that the rich are admonished to open their handes and their bowels vnto their poore brethren: as we haue diuers instructions thereof in the scrip∣ture, Heb. 10. 31. as wel in the olde as newe Testament, which haue beene some∣times alledged before: let them be careful to helpe their necessities, to the ende that they giue none occasion that the name of God bee blasphemed, neither that their neighbours should be spoyled & rob∣bed: but so much as they can, let them exercise mercy to the ende that so muche as in them lyeth they may saue both the bodies and soules of the poore. And as the riche ought to behaue them∣selues after this sorte towardes the poore, euen so ought the wise in like case to doe vnto the ignorant. 10 Accuse not a seruant vnto his maister, least he curse thee, when thou hast offended. Wee say commonly, that wee must not adde to, or encrease his affliction that is already afflicted. And although wee shoulde or ought to vnderstande rhis same naturally, yet are we so euil, that we resist that which wee knowe to be our natural duetie. Because of this malice, God for to bring vs vnto amendmēt, or if we will not be corrected, for to make vs the more giltie and vnexcusable, doeth giue vs commandements, whereby he doth shew vs that we should not afflict the afflicted, but doth forbid it vs with threatnings. But there are no commandements nor threatninges that can hinder or let many to delight to trouble the miserable: as the flatterers, slaun∣derers, Exo. 22. 21 22. 23. 24 and tale carriers who because they may bee the better wel∣come, wil labour by their false tongues, to sting and to make poore seruants and slaues to bee hated of their maisters, who are sharpe enough otherwise, yea but too cruel: and wil tel such tales without knowledge of any faulte: sauing that by a sinister iudgement they
wil count some smal and light thing for a fault, which is not worth the speaking of: or els of set malice they interprete some thing euil which is not so of it selfe, or at the least wise is tollerable: or els, if a man make a fault, it may be ignorantly. The wise man woulde not haue vs like vnto these people, as hee very plainely sheweth vs, saying, Accuse not a seruant vnto his maister. And this that he saith of the seruant (who was sometimes in a miserable state in respect of the worlde) we must obserue towards al persons which are in the power or in the subiection of an other. For albeit that we haue no such seruants, yet the doctrine ceasseth not, but to appertaine vnto vs: and in obseruing of it, we must adde nothing vnto the worde of God. For it is conteined vnder the cōmandement, Thou shalbeare no false witnesse against thy neighbour: and it teacheth vs to walke in loue, the which couereth a multitude of sinnes, as we haue seen. It is patient, it beareth the infirmities of our neighbors: so far is it of Pro. 10. 12 2. Cor. 13. 4. that it giueth affliction vpon affliction, or hath an euil tongue, for to torment him that seemeth to be at peace. Such charitie is cōman∣ded vs, not onely in the new Testament, but also in the olde: euen al∣so towards our enimies: by a more strong reason thē, towards those which nothing labour to hurt vs, we must be pitiful and merciful: Exo. 23. 4. 5. or at the least wise, that we procure thē not any trouble, by our ac∣cusations, tales, slanders, or flatterings. For if we behaue ourselues otherwise, we shalbe greatly giltie for the wrong that wee shal doe them, and shal giue them occasion to curse vs, for the fault wee shal commit against them: as the wise man doeth expresse it say∣ing, Lest he curse thee when thou hast offended, The which is done when the afflicted complaine of them which oppresse them: for in crying out vpon, and complaining of the oppressours, is as much as if Deut. 15. 9 they cursed thē. Now God heareth the crie of such afflicted, where∣of it followeth, that hee counteth that which is doone and com∣mitted against the miserable poore, for sinne: of the which number were chiefly the seruants and slaues, the which were han∣deled worse then beastes. For this cause the wise man setteth them foorth, & would haue them to be borne with al, & their imperfe∣ctions and weakenesses to be dissembled, rather then to cause them
to be euil intreated through tales and flatteries. Yet notwithstanding if the miserable (as it is their custome for the greatest number) doe commit wickednesse and vngodlinesse to the dishonour of God, to the slaunder and detriment of their neighbours, we should not then holde our peace, nor feare their cursings, but to accuse them according to the order that Iesus Christe hath appointed▪ Moreouer let vs note, that albeit the wise man doth threaten the accusers of the Mat. 18. 15 miserable for their cursing, yet doth he not allowe that we shoulde curse, though also a man were accused wrongfully. Hee knewe wel enough that Ioseph a slaue in Egypt, had not cursed his maisters Gen. 39 wife, though she had accused him falsely. Dauid being a poore fugi∣tiue, did not curse those which accused him vnto Saul, but saued Psa. 109. 3. 4 himselfe as hee might: and also prayed for them. Hee therfore doth not allowe cursinges, but he reproueth the vnpatiencie of the mise∣rable, which knowe not that it is God which raiseth vp accusers a∣gainst them, for to trie their pacience, and to bring them vnto the knowledge of their faults, that they might come vnto amendment: and knowing that they haue wel deserued to be accused, not onely before men, but also before God, they require pardō of their faults. Therefore if wee bee miserable, and that it pleaseth God, to raise vp against vs such people as doe desire nothing but to staine vs, for to make vs yet more miserable, euen to destroy vs, yet let vs not for al that vse cursings, but let vs followe that which Iesus Christ tea∣cheth vs, concerning loue towards our enimies, and also his exam∣ple Mat. 5. 44 therein. For when he was accused, he cursed not, but stoode like a sheepee not opening his mouth before his shearer. Finally, let vs note, that as the seruants are miserable, that haue euil willers, e∣uen so for the greatest number the maisters are too sharpe & hard, too seuere and rigorous, too wicked and cruel: and therefore it is not without cause that the wise man woulde not haue seruants to bee accused to their maisters. And closely heerein hee admonisheth aswel the maisters, as the seruantes to do their dueitie one towards another. The which Saint Paule doeth largely and clearely handle in the Ephesians 6. and Collos. 3. 4. and Titus 2. and Saint Peter 1. Chapter. 2.
11 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not blesse their mother. God at the beginning created man like vnto his image and like∣nesse, that hee shoulde walke in al holinesse: as the Apostle Saint Collo. 3. 10 Paule declareth. And since that, for to correct his corruption and his wickednesse, hee hath giuen him commandements: and the better to drawe him, to frame his life after them, hee made him promises: and woulde that wee shoulde order ourselues with al our affection and in true humilitie, with al softnesse and gentlenesse vnder the o∣bedience of his commandementes, and shoulde trust altogether vp∣on his promises. And to the ende that wee shoulde feare to forsake them, hee addeth threatninges against the disobedient and vnbelee∣ning, and condemneth them vnto death. But there are but fewe people that make any great account to maintein this image in them, which obey the commandements, which trust in the promises, and which feare the threatninges and condemnation of death: as wee feele the same but too much in our time: and as hath beene seene in olde time, euen as the holy histories doe declare. And with these proofes we haue also now the wiseman which maketh great com∣plaint therof in this present sentence, and in other following: in the which he accuseth not one man alone, or some familie, but a great number. For he saith not, there are some men: but he saith, There is a generation. By the which word he signifieth a very great num∣ber, and a continual stocke: and is as much as if he saide, that from father to sonne, and from sonne to sonne, the euil continueth, & that the successours doe follow the corruption and the wickednes of their predecessours, in a great number, and in a long time toge∣ther. And as touching this present sentence, we must note, it is not without cause why the wise man maketh such complaint. For nature teacheth vs that we should greatly esteeme our fathers & mothers, and should honour them in obeying them, in helping their necessi∣ties, and in being altogether at their commandement without vex∣ing or troubling them: seeing we condemne those which do the contrary. Although that young children doe not thinke nor take suche heede vnto this natural lawe, as they ought to doe:
yet is it not to say, but that it shoulde bee grauen in their heartes: as wee may see it, when they are come to age, and haue children: For without the Scripture they coulde wel enough aske their chil∣dren the duetie they owe them. And the Heathen likewise, which neuer knewe any thing of the holy scripture, coulde very wel say, That wee cannot yeelde any recompence vnto our fathers and mo∣thers. But in the time of the wise man, and long time before, God, for to helpe nature, and to waken him vp, had giuen his com∣mandements by writing: amongest the which hee commandeth, Honour thy father and thy mother, and to mooue the children to obey them, he addeth a promise, saying, that thy dayes may be long Exo. 20. 12. on the lande which the Lorde thy God giueth thee. And albeit that the promise doeth closely import and carry with it a threatning and condemnation against the disobedient: neuerthelesse, to the end that wee shoulde feare and bee more giltie and vnexcusable, if wee failed in the duetie towards our parentes, God expresseth the threa∣tening. Hee woulde haue the parentes to procure the punishmente of their rebellious children, and to bring them before the iudges. Forasmuch as there is such natural light, suche commaundements, such promises and threatenings, and such condemnation, it is not Exo. 21. 17. Deut. 21. 12 therefore with out cause that the wise man complaineth or wonde∣reth at this, that in al ages there are so many disobedient children vnto their fathers and mothers, not onely ignorantly or carelesly, contemning their cōmandements, but also of set malice resisting thē with wronges and iniuries: as the wise man doeth signifie by the curse that hee repeateth, when he is not satisfied in saying, Curseth his father, but addeth, and doeth not blesse his mother, as it is the manner of the Scripture, to rehearse one very thing vnder diuers wordes. Orels wee may say that the wise man maketh heere an ar∣gument of consequence, from the greater to the lesser: as if he saide forasmuche as there is a generation of children, so corrupted, that they forbeare not to curse their fathers and mothers, which are the heads and lordes of the house, it followeth wel that they make no account to doe any good vnto their mothers, who are inferiours to their fathers. For it is also the custome of wicked children, that though verily they seeme to feare and honour their fathers, least they shold be beaten or driuen out of the doores, or dishinherited:
yet wil they boldly shewe, that they greatly despise their mother, & labour to perswade themselues, that they need not to make any ac∣count of them, because they are women, and haue no power nor authoritie to depriue them of their portion of the goods. Wherein there is great pride and great vnthankefulnesse: for seeing God hath giuen thē this honour to be mothers, the children ought to be sub∣iect vnto them in al humblenesse and obedience. And sith they haue Iob. 4. 4. Eccle. 7. 24 suffered so much paines in bearing them in their wombes, and haue suffered so great sorowes in bringing them foorth, & haue so much care to nurse them and to bring them vp, they shoulde be ready and diligent to doe them good againe. The which the wise man doeth teach them to doe, when he complaineth, they blesse not their mo∣thers. And forasmuch as it happeneth most often that those childrē which haue beene wantonly brought vp, are the soonest ready to curse their fathers, and to greeue and trouble their mothers, the fa∣thers and mothers ought to learne that they are heere taught too nurse and bring vp their children in instruction and doctrine of the Lorde. And when also it is saide, Thou shalt not speake euil of the iudges of thy people, &c. princes are taught to be careful too keepe Exo. 22. 28. their subiectes vnder. 12 There is a generation that are pure in their owne con∣ceite, and yet are not washed from their filthy∣nesse. He complaineth of a vice that hath reigned of long time, and wrought much euil: that is, that in place that we shold be displeased with our filthinesses, wee haue praised & esteemed them, as if we were very pure and cleane, and that there were in vs nothing to be blamed. Cain had the like estimation of himselfe, when he sayde, My punishmēt is greater then I can beare. The people in the time of Noe, the messenger of righteousnes, which had no repentance, haue Gen. 4. 13 wel shewed they were cleane in their owne eies: euen so haue those of Sodome done likewise in the time of righteous Lot, which wold not receiue any exhortations: and the Iewes, which woulde not heare the preaching of the Prophets, who rebuked thē in the name Gen. 19. 7 of the Lord: as they are often reproched for it: and the Scribes and
Pharisees in the time of our Sauiour Iesus Christe, who bragged of their righteousnesse, and mocked our Lorde, and blasphemed both him and his doctrine. Now that these people haue fallen into this abhominable vice, & were greatly giltie before God, the scripture doth declare vn∣to vs: First ofal, when God regarded not the offering of Cain. Se∣condly, Gen. 4. 5. & 13. 13. when it is saide, Nowe the people of Sodome were wicked and greeuous sinners against the Lord. Thirdly, what haue I to doe with the multitude of your sacrifices? Crie out with open throate, Esay. 1. 11. 58. 1. spare not: tel my people of their transgression, &c. Fourthly yee are they, which iustifie yourselues before men, but God knoweth your Luke. 16. 15 Mat. 23. 25. hearts, &c. Because of such hypocrisie, which was vncorrigible, great plagues folowed. The worlde was destroyed by the flood: Sodome and her neighbors were ouerthrowne with fire & brimstone: The Iewes were destroyed by warres, and the remnant caried away cap∣tiue to Babilon. And after the resurrection of our Lorde they were Mat. 23. 35. & 24. 15. Luk. 18. 11 13. Iob. 14. 4. & 15. 14. 15. 16 & 25. 4. 5. 9. brought into great desolation, as he had foretolde, as wee also see it. And thus it is not without cause that the wise man complaineth thereof. In this he admonisherh vs that we should not brag of our purenes, as did the Pharises: but that we should humble ourselues, with the Publican: and that with Iob wee shoulde confesse there is none that is borne of an vncleane seede, that can bee made cleane. What is man that he should be cleane? and who is he that is borne of woman, that can bee declared righteous? And howe may a man be iustified with God? or ho we can hee be cleane, that is borne of a woman. Forasmuch then as wee can not washe ourselues from our 1. Iohn. 1. 8. 9 filthines, let vs not therfore be so glorious, as that we should thinke ourselues to be pure and cleane: for if we say we haue no sinne, we deceiue ourselues and the truth is not in vs. But if we confesse our sinnes, he is faythful and iust for to pardon our sinnes, and to clense vs from al iniquitie. Let vs then bee ashamed of our sinnes, but not to confesse them, saying with Esay, Wee are all as filthinesse, and all our righteousnesse is as a polluted clothe, &c: and with Saint Paule, Esay. 64. 6. Rom. 7. 14. Psal. 51. 3. Psalm. 51. 1. wee are carnal, solde vnder sinne. And in confessing them, let vs praye with Dauid, Haue mercy vppon mee OGOD after thy great goodnesse, and according vnto the multitude of thy mercies, do away mine offences, &c. When we shal do thus in good cōsciēce,
God wil accōplish his promise vnto vs, that he hath made vs, to wit, that hee wil powre cleane water vpon vs, and we shalbe cleane, &c. Eze. 36. 25. And albeit that of ourselues we are not cleane, (for sinne dwelleth continually in vs, & haue neede dayly to aske pard on for our sinnes and offences) yet if we truely humble ourselues, as hath byn saide, God wil accept vs for iust and cleane, hauing sprinkeled our consciences with the precious blood of his Sonne. And in this sort we shal not be cleane in our owne eies, and yet wee shalbe washed from our filthinesses, by the grace and mercy of our heauenly fa∣ther, who wil impute vnto vs the righteousnesse of his sonne: whom 1. Cor. 1. 30. hee hath appointed to bee our righteousnesse, sanctification and re∣demptiō. We must therfore with al humilitie confesse Iesus Christ to be suche, least we be presumptuous, and puffed vp with our own righteousnesse & holinesse, as Simon: but let vs prostrate ourselues at his feete, as did Marie Magdalen. Thus doing, we shal condemne ourselues, and shal not be condemned, but shal obtaine remission of Luk. 7. 37. 39 our sinnes, though they be neuer so many. Contrarily, if we thinke there be any cleannesse in ourselues, God wil blinde vs, and giue vs vp vnto a reprobate sense: as hee hath alreadie done the Iewes and Luk. 17. 10 the Papistes. In place then of iustifying ourselues, yea, though wee had done whatsoeuer God commaundeth vs: yet let vs say (as Ie∣sus Christ hath taught vs) We are but vnprofitable seruantes, &c. 13 There is a generation, whose eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp. In the former sentence he hath reproued the hypocrites, making a great complaint against them: & now he dealeth with the proude. And albeit that pride ruleth in the deepenesse of the heart, yet spa∣reth he not to iudge therof, marking it by the external and outward signes, which come from the disposition & inclination of the heart. Neither must wee maruell though hee deale with the proude, fra∣ming a complaint and accusation against them: seeing that man of himselfe is nothing: for God made him, and not hee himselfe. And although he be created according to the ymage and lykenesse of his Creatour, neuerthelesse he is made of the dust of the earth: and it is Gen. 2. 7. & 3, 19. saide, that hee is dust, and shal returne to dust againe.
And as he is nothing of himselfe, euen so also hath hee nothing of himselfe: so that we may wel say vnto the proude, Wherof com∣meth it that earth and dust is proud: and What hast thou, that thou Eccle. 10. 1 1. Cor. 4. 7. hast not receiued? and if thou hast receiued it, why doest thou boast as though thou haddest not receiued it? For the proud haue alwayes delighted in themselues, and boasted of their wisedome, power, counsel, credite, authoritie, antiquitie, nobilitie, experience, and ri∣ches, as if they had al these thinges in themselues: and haue not confessed that God holdeth al in his hand, and giueth being, to whō soeuer he pleaseth. He teacheth, strengtheneth, exalteth, maketh no∣ble, raiseth vp, and inricheth whom he wil. And as hath beene saide, the proude neither can nor wil in any wise confesse this same: and therefore it is no wonder though the wise man complaineth of thē. And as we haue saide, he noteth their pride by the outward signes, as we may see in other places, as the scripture sheweth, in threatning Psal. 18. 28. Pro. 6. 17 Esai. 2. 11 & 5. 15 Psal. 131. 1. the proude. And because there is none of sound iudgement, but fea∣reth to be hated of God, and to be beaten downe with his mightie hand, we must humble our eyes, euen by the guiding of the heart: so that we may protest with Dauid, Lorde, I am not high minded: I haue no proude lookes, &c. 14 There is a generation, whose teethe are as swoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men. He reprooueth now the crueltie of the great men of the earth, which hath continually raigned: as we may see it in Caine, and in Gen. 4. 8. 23 & 6. 4. Exo. 1. 8 1. Sam. 18 Psal. 14. 4 & 57. 5. Miche. 3. 1. Lamech, and in the mightie Giantes, which filled the earth with cruelties: in Pharao, and in his people: In Saule, who persecuted Dauid: as we may see by the complaintes that are conteined in the holie scriptures. Now I haue expresly saide, that the wise man tou∣cheth the crueltie of the great men of the earth, which are in diuers sortes: for some are great in riches, some are great in credite and authoritie, some in power, and other in multitude of friendes. The which also the wise man sheweth, when he saieth, That their teeth and their iawes do serue them as kniues and swordes, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men:
and herein he sheweth that the Prouerbe is true, which saieth, the great eate the smal. And also cōmonly we see that the great wil not quarrel with their equals, but with them that are feeble and weake, and which haue no blood (as it is said) in their nayles, to be reuen∣ged, (that is to say) which can not scratch and haue none to support them, but rather are vexed on al sides, and knowe not to whome among men they may goe to haue refuge. Wherein there is great crueltie, as the wise man hath noted, when he compareth them vn∣to wilde and cruel beastes, which haue teeth and iawes meete to de∣uour the praye: and when hee compareth them vnto theeues, and murtherers, which vse knyues and swords to kil the passengers, and suche as they beare malice to. And albeit that in exercising their cru∣eltie, they shew themselues bolde and valiant, yet are they villaines and cowardes: as the wise man marketh, when he saieth not, that it is to fight against them which are mightie, wel armed, and of a stout stomake, but for to eate vp them which are of no resistaunce; and are altogether naked and destitute of al force & power, so that they can not defende themselues, from the violences of the vnmer∣ciful and cruel. And thus, it is not without cause that the wise man complaineth thereof. And herein, he exhorteth that if we haue any greatnesse and power, that we should haue pitie and compassi∣on of the afflicted, and such as are poore. 15 The Horseleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be satisfi∣ed: yea foure, that say not, it is enough: 16 The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be satisfied with water, and the fire that saieth not, it is enough. If in these two sentences wee vnderstande nothing but that which is offered at the first sight by the letter, they shal serue vs to no instruction. And if the wise man woulde teache vs none other thing by them, then as the wordes doe sounde, he hath set downe no excellent thing in them, nor that is worthie of admiration. The which we neither ought to thinke nor to say.
And therefore, it is necessarie for vs to vnderstande that the wise man speaketh heere in parables and by comparison: and doth great∣ly touche theeues and robbers, the couetous and vsurers, the spoy∣lers and extortioners, the whoremongers and adulterers, the glut∣tons and drunkards: and al such as suffer themselues to be caried a∣way of their vnbrideled concupiscences. He calleth them first of all horseleaches: the which hath her tongue forked, as it is saide, and with these twoo forkes, which the wise man calleth two daughters, she sucketh mans blood, and wil not leaue the skinne, til she be ful, euē ready to burst. Euen so also these people are not easie to be plea∣sed, but hauing twoo daughters, that is to say, diuers wayes and meanes to hurte, and to oppresse their neighbours, and to vexe themselues, they cease not to desire more and more to folowe their lustes. The which the wise man signifieth, when hee is not conten∣ted to haue saide once, giue, but doeth repeate it, saying, Giue, giue, Wherein hee sheweth an vnsatiable couetousnesse in such people: and therewith also hee calleth, the pollings, extorti∣ons, exactions, spoylings, whoredomes, delightes, voluptuousnesse and excesse giftes: not so that whatsoeuer they obtaine is giuen them with a free and liberall minde: but forasmuch as although that they exact and constraine, or vse craft and subtiltie to get what they desire, yet doe they not spare to vse this language, giue, giue: and also that which they take, and that which they vse doeth cost them nothing but the taking. Secondly, hee compareth them vnto foure things. And for to doe this, hee vseth repetition: for not to be ful, or not satisfied, and not to say, it is ynough: is al one thing. Hee vseth also Correctiō: for hauing affirmed but of three things, after∣wardes hee affirmeth of foure. And this is for to pricke so much the more the vnsatiable desires of those which haue no care but to serue their flesh. The first is, the graue, which for the sinne of man, the more bo∣dies either great, meane, or smal that are giuen too it, yet doeth it refuse none, but doeth consume them al, and bring them al to dust, as an executioner of the sentence of God, In the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate thy bread, till thou returnest to the earth a∣gaine, Gene. 3. 19. &c. The seconde is, The baren wombe: the which though it be so
restrained, and as it were closed vp, that it can conceiue no children, yet doeth it not cease continually to desire seede: as wee may see by Rachel, the wife of Iacob. The thirde is, The earth that cannot bee Gen. 30. 1. satisfied with water, and yet is not watered with the raine from a∣boue, neither with fountaines or riuers for to be moistened: or wee shal take the earth that is not satisfied with water, for the same that is so cleft and so dry, that albeeit, it is throughly wette with water, yet it ceaseth not stil to want, and to receiue thereof somuch as commeth and falleth: as wee may see in sandy grounde. The fourth is, the fire, that consumeth whatsoeuer is cast into it, howe strong and hard soeuer it be. When the wise man compareth the carnal & sensual, the dissolute and thriftles, the vnmerciful and cruel, vnto these foresaide things, he blameth not the saide things: for they fol∣lowe nothing but the nature giuen to them of God. But as hath beene saide, he pricketh men which are corrupted and not conten∣ted to folowe the good nature wherein God hath created them at the beginning, but doe vsurpe the nature of those thinges which haue no reason, and doe so abuse them, that that which ought in no wise to be blamed in those creatures, yet is it very detestable & ab∣hominable when men folowe it: as there is none of vs, but doth so iudge of it. To make an Allegorie otherwise, it shoulde bee vnpro∣fitable: as al men of good sense may iudge it. But let vs learne to be modest, temperate and sober, being contented with that which God giueth vs, without abusing the natural kinde of the foresaide crea∣tures: otherwise they shalbee our iudges. 17 The eye that mocketh his father, and despiseth the in∣struction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it. It is a thing contrarie vnto nature (as hath beene handled heere∣tofore in the 11. ver.) that children should be rebellious and iniuri∣ous to their fathers and mothers: as also it is against the comman∣dement and threatening of God. And so it cannot bee, but that the children being of ful age, and yeeres of discretion, must needs sinne against their consciences, and of set malice, when they doe iniurie & wrong vnto their fathers and mothers: or also when with an enui∣ous
and malicious arrogancie, they mocke at them, and despise to heare their admonitiōs: it is a thing verie wicked, detestable, shame∣ful, and highly monstrous. For this cause the wise man feareth not to praye or desire that suche children might bee forsaken and giuen to be spoyled, as they doe wel deserue. The which desire he expres∣seth, saying, Let the Rauens of the riuer, &c. Wherein wee haue to note, that the Rauens and Eagles doe flye and folow aftercarion and dead bodies: and because they are often times cast into the riuers, the which doeth often cast them vp againe vpon the shoare, the Rauens and Eagles resort thither for their foode, and chiefly pecke out the eyes, as we may see it by experience: and then as they haue neede, they eate the rest of the dead bodie. And thus the wise man com∣pareth the mocking and contemning children vnto carions, which are cast out vnto the deuouring birdes, and desire to haue them ea∣ten. And herein he desireth nothing of his owne minde, but accor∣ding to the threatning that God maketh against the rebels, which care not to obey his worde. And because we see in the gesture and Deut. 28. 26 Ier. 16. 4. & 34. 20. moouing of the eyes, the mocking and despising that lyeth hid with∣in the heart, for this cause the wise man doeth not speake but of the eye: and thereby he signifieth al the malice of man, yea, wholly a malicious man, who is nothing but a carrion, woorthie to bee cast Mat. 13. 4. 19. 1. Pet. 5. 8. out, not onely vnto the byrdes of the ayre and beastes of the earth, but to the Deuil also, that is the birde that eateth that, which is sowne by the high wayes side, who is also, the roaring Lyon. Wee might also say, that this is a threatning against wicked children, vn∣thankful and contemners of so great paynes that their fathers and mothers haue taken for them: by the which hee denounceth vnto them, that not onely they shalbe preuented with sodeine death, but also that they shalbe cruelly and shamefully slaine, and cast to bee deuoured by the beastes, which they haue exceeded in crueltie: and shalbe left vnburied. And because he maketh mentiō of the instruc∣tion of the mother, therefore children are exhorted in feare and re∣uerence to receiue and obey the commandements of their mothers: though they be women, and that after the sense of the mockers and scoffers, they ought not to regarde their wordes. Moreouer, when instruction is attributed vnto the mothers, women shal not be ex∣cused
for the weakenesse of their kinde, for hauing learned nothing to teach their children. 18 There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not. 19 The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a stone, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a mayde. 20 Such is the way also of an adulterous wcman: she eateth and wipeth her mouth, and saieth, I haue not com∣mitted iniquitie. Albeit that adulterie is a verie horrible and detestable sin before Gene. 2. 24. Gene. 6. & 7. Exo. 20. 14. Leui. 20. 10. Deut. 22. 22. God: as he shewed at the first, when he ordeined mariage, and that he hath not saide, that three or foure, or more, shalbe one flesh, but, man shal forsake father and mother, and shal cleaue vnto his wife, and they two shalbe one fleshe. Secondly, when hee sent the flood vpon those which had taken the daughters of men for their wiues. Thirdly, when he saieth, Thou shalt not commit adulterie. Fourth∣ly, when he commandeth adulterers to be destroyed: yet neuerthe∣lesse, when there haue so many adulteries beene committed of long time, and that are stil daily committed, it is shewed, there is no great account made of suche filthinesse: and that as it were in de∣spight of God, they are delighted in that which hee greatly abhor∣reth. Wherein the men and women that are suche, doe shew them¦selues impudent and shamelesse. And as they haue not God before their eyes, and persuade themselues he seeth them not, euen so wil they not acknowledge their iniquitie: and thinke that they cannot be reprooued. For as they persuade themselues that they doe none iniquitie, euen so they make themselues beleeue that their trade & wayes can not be seene: and therefore dare they present themselues before the worlde without shame, as if they were honestmen, rea∣die, boldly to prooue them lyers, which would blame them, as they are woorthie thereof. The wise man in this present parable, doeth declare vnto vs this impudencie. And is as much as if he saide, Euen as men can not knowe the way of an Eagle in the ayre, &c: neither the signes and tokens of the pollutions of a man with a mayd: and
the secrete inticementes that the man vseth to make the virgin con∣sent vnto him, with whome he burneth in concupiscence, by the which allurements man is defiled, though he hath not once touched the virgin: euen the adulterers eate, that is to say, delight in their whoredomes. And then, as gluttons and drunken seruantes, when in the absence of their maisters, haue spent the time in eating and drinking, if they feele & perceiue their maisters to draw neere, doe wipe their mouthes, to seeme that they haue neither drunke nor eate: euen so the adulterers, after hauing committed whoore∣dome, doe wipe their mouthes: they counterfait and dissemble to be honest men, & they think they are not known, and that they can not be conuinced and ouercome, & their wayes to be as sealed let∣ters. And therefore as if they were pure and cleane, holie and righ∣teous, they boldly say, they haue done none euil: yea, and though Htb. 13. 4. they be taken in the deede doing, yet would they haue men to think that suche abhomination were natural thinges, and not to be re∣garded: the which is as much as if they saide, that they are not gil∣tie. But at the last they shal feele, that, that which they eate is bit∣ter. For God wil condemne whoremongers and adulterers. 21 For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not sustaine it selfe. 22 For a seruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate, 23 For the hateful woman, when shee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaistresse. It is amost certaine thing that the earth remoueth neither high∣er nor lower, neither on the right side, nor on the left side, but remai∣neth stedfast in his place, that God hath ordeined for it, except he himselfe doe remooue and shake it. Now that it remaineth sure, the scripture doth witnesse it, And therefore, when it is saide, The Iob. 9. 5. 6. Psa. 18. 8. 1. Chro. 16. 30. Psa. 93. 1. earth is mooued, we wil not take it for this earthly Element, but for th habitants therof, as it is so taken in diuers places of the scrip∣ture. And also the worde that is translated, moued, in the wise mans
tongue, doeth not signifie the remoouing of one place vnto an o∣ther, but to tremble, to be angrie, and to be stirred vp, and troubled Eccle. 1. 4. 1. Sam. 27. 0. Esai. 11. 4. 9. for feare or for wrath. And so as touching the 21. verse, the wise man meaneth, that by the worlde the inhabitantes of the earth are trou∣bled, grieued, sorowful, feareful, and angrie, for the comming of foure thinges: and that also they can not holde, but be in feare, or to be angrie, it is not for vs to teache these thinges: for the trou∣bles and vexations that happen, are but too much knowne, when the vile and abiectes are exalted, when the foolish & wicked are made riche, when riotous women are maistresses in the house, and when maydes become dames. Nowe forasmuche as we desire not to bee troubled with suche thinges, let vs knowe, that the wise man doeth admonishe vs heere, that wee should be careful to looke narrowly and straighly what persons wee ought to preferre and exalt. And as we desire not to be troubled, euen so, when wee are exalted to an higher degree, let vs not trouble any man by our pride, malice, ri∣gour and chorlishnesse: as doe they commonly which are exalted from a lowe and miserable state. In the which number the wise man doeth first of al set the seruant and slaue, saying, that when suche a person commeth to be raised vp to honour, and power, hee is so proude and high minded, so churlishe and sharpe, so vnmerciful and cruel, that none can continue with him. And whatsoeuer is said of the seruant, we must also vnderstande it of euerie vile man, and abiect person, who hath not the feare of God, and is not contented with his state, wherin God hath placed him. In the which order we may set Saul, who was of the lowest trybes and of the least familie 1. Sam. 9. 21. & 15. 17. of Beniamin. I say expresly of the seruant, who hath not the feare of God: for Ioseph indeede was a seruant in Egypt, but the people were mooued neither with feare, nor with anger, when he was ex∣alted, and ruled the countrie. Dauid was a shepheard in the house of his Father, and when he had obtained the kingdome, he wrought no trouble nor sorowe to the people. Secondly he placeth A foole when he is filled with meate, that is to say, the wicked foole, that feeleth himselfe riche and at his ease, of set purpose doeth despise his neighbours, and desireth more to hurt them, then to helpe them: as did Pharao King of Egypt: Na∣bal, the Carmelite and others. 1. Sam. 25.
Thirdly, the hateful woman, who is of so straunge and trouble∣some manners, and of so vnmerciful and cruel conuersation, that she Gen. 39. 1. King. 16. 31. & 18. Mat. 14. is feared, or rather that men are compelled to hate her, as she de∣serueth. In the which number, wee might also set the wife of Io∣sephs maister: Iezabel, Achabs wife, through whome the lande of Israel was mooued, and prouoked: Then Herodias. Fourthly, hee setteth, A handmayde, who of her selfe is miserable, when shee commeth to succeede her maistresse, when from a vile and low de∣gree shee is raised vp to honour, from riches to pouertie, from la∣bour and payne, to rest and pleasures. Most commonly such hand∣maydes keepe no modestie nor humilitie, but are so arrogant and proude, so churlishe and sharpe, that no man can abide them. To the ende therefore that we stirre not, nor mooue the earth, let vs be careful to behaue ourselues lowlie and gently, though we be ex∣alted and lifted vp. 24 There be foure smal things in the earth, yet they are wise, and ful of wisedome: 25 The Pismyres, a people not strong, yet prepare they their meate in sommer: 26 The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houses in the Rocke: 27 The Grashopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes: 28 The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces. The wise man continueth stil to teach vs by parables, setting foorth vnto vs, foure of the least and smallest beastes of the earth, to be our teachers and guides, that wee should learne instruction of them. And to the ende, that although it ought to shame vs, that we must be taught by such litle beastes, yet that we should not refuse their instruction, hee doeth attribute wisedome vnto them: and least we should despise this wisedome, he sheweth that it is not fayned by them, when he saieth,
Yet are they wise, and ful of wisedome. Whereupon foloweth that it is God, who hath created them in a wise nature, the which they haue not lost, nor yet forsaken, as man hath done, abolishing by his transgression and rebellion, the image and likenesse of God, wherein he was created: And is so spoyled of wisedome, and be∣come so ignorant, dul, and blockish, that the least beastes, must teach him his lesson, and shewe him, howe hee must gouerne himselfe. Nowe albeit we shoulde be ashamed thereof, yet should we thanke God, who by such Doctours, helpeth our rudenesse and weaknesse, and maketh that profitable vnto vs, which at the first sight, offereth it selfe before our eyes, and in our fantasie, to be vile and contemp∣tible, and as a thing of no price nor estimation. And also the wise man doeth cal them, The smal thinges of the earth. Wherein a∣gaine we should haue shame: for we should be wholly occupied to consider spiritual and heauenly thinges, for to be preserued in wise∣dome, to knowe to gouerne ourselues, and to spende the time as we ought, in woorking diligently and couragiously, without dout or feare, and should not suffer our weakenesse to make vs slouthful & negligent, or our highnesse to turne vs away from our office and duetie: and we must looke downe to the earth, and towardes lowe, smal, weake, & contemptible things for to be taught of thē. Where∣in we may know that we haue nothing to bragge ourselues of, nor to challenge any excellencie. Notwithstanding, we are so pleased with ourselues, that ey∣ther we can not, or we wil not, take heed from esteeming ourselues, if wee feele and perceiue in ourselues any strength and power, any cunning or aptnesse. On the other side, we loue so much the ease, de∣lightes and rest of our fleshe, that we make ourselues beleeue wee are weake, and should marre ourselues if wee should labour: or by distrust and feare, giue ourselues ouer to the gouernment of those whom we esteeme mightie: no man dare come neere vnto the great Lords, least they should displease them, though with them he might employ himselfe to doe what God commaundeth him. It is the custome of those which wil doe nothing, to alledge they are feeble and weake, to be excused and borne with, and that they might eate their bread in idlenesse and without dooing any thing. But the wise man wil receiue no suche excuses, as hee doeth plainly shewe,
when he bringeth foorth the Pismyre, and declareth that it is a peo∣ple, that hath no strength, & that yet they labour in sommer, which is the appointed season to gather and to lay vp victuals in store. And Pro. 6. 6. this is that which Solomon sheweth vnto the slouthful. And there∣in he sheweth that we must in the appointed time and season, ap∣plye ourselues after the power and wisedome that God hath giuen vs: and that in so doing there shalbe no season so sharpe, wherein we shal not obteine, whatsoeuer shalbe necessarie for vs. For to pro∣uoke vs the more to take paine, and not to flye backe for our weak∣nesse, & that we should labour to folowe our vocation, and to per∣seuer therein, hee setteth before vs the Conies, which are without strength, & haue no resistance, but flye and sodeinly run away at the barking of the least whelpe that is: and yet notwithstanding are so continually in scraping, that they wil atchiue to pearce euen the ve∣ry harde rocke, for to make themselues lodging and to hide them∣selues therein. The rockes (saith Dauid) are a refuge for the conies. Psa. 104. 18 Mat. 16. 18 1. Cor. 10. 4. Therefore let not our feeblenesse make vs cowardes: Let euery one of vs occupie himselfe after his capacitie and abilitie, taking the rock, which is Iesus Christe for his refuge. And in this sort we shalbee in great safetie. And to the ende, that wee shoulde not looke for the protection and sauegarde of the great lordes and mightie of the earth: or if wee be destitute of their guiding and gouernement Let vs not be discouraged, as were the Iewes. In the thirde place he 1. Sam. 8. 5 setteth before vs, the Grashoppers, saying, they haue no king, yet are they strong, and are guided valiantly, as people expert in the warres: as he expresseth, saying, they go foorth al by bandes: that is to say, they assemble and gather together a great multitude and by heapes: as those which God sent into Egypt. And also the holy scrip∣ture, for to signifie a great power, speaketh so of grashoppers. Though wee bee destitute of temporal protection, yet let vs not Exo. 10. 12. Iud. 6. 5. & 7. 12. leaue of to beare ourselues valiantly, knitting ourselues together by faith, beeing assured, that wee haue the king of kings for our protectour and gouernour, who wil not forsake vs, but will giue vs weapons to resist the infernall and hellishe powers. And therefore, what euill soeuer the worlde or the Deuill doe in∣uent against vs, let vs not bee discouraged, but let vs folowe
Saint Paules admonition, Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stande against the assaultes of the Deuil. And be∣cause Ephe. 6. 11. the greatnesse and authoritie of men, is often cause that the smal and weake dare not doe that which belongeth to their office, the wise man, fourthly setteth before vs, the Spider, that is verie weake, yet doeth shee not feare to haunt the Pallaces of Kinges, and there to spinne her webbe, crossing and trauersing, & one while ta∣king one side, and an other while an other, for to spread her web, and to make it so long as euer she can. Euen so, let no highnesse of Princes, turne vs away from dooing our duetie, and that we shoulde not largely doe whatsoeuer belongeth vnto our office. Ac∣cording to some mens iudgement, by the Pismire that laboureth willingly, and without constraint, men are rebuked for that they wil not labour but by compulsion: By the conies, they are reproued for their ouermuch boldnesse: By the Grashoppers, which flie keeping their orders, they are rebuked that though they haue kings, princes, and magistrates, yet do they not obey them, but would rule ouer o∣ther. By the Spider in kings pallaces, we haue an example of labour: and signifieth that they that rule the common wealth, ought a∣boue al thinges to be vigilant and careful. 29 There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going. 30 A Lyon which is strong among beasts, and turneth not at the sight of any, 31 A lustie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, against whome there is no rising vp. When a man walketh blamelesse in his maners and conuersation, & applyeth diligently himself to do his office, we say he goeth right: and if he doe the contrary, we say he goeth astray, and that hee wal∣keth not in the right pathe: and so wee cal the life of man, a pathe, a step, or a way. After the which manner of speaking the scripture a∣greeth, Gene. 5. 22. & 6. 9. 12. for to be the more familiar vnto vs: as it is saide, that Enock
walked with God: and Noe was perfect in his time, walking with God: and al fleshe had corrupted his way vpon earth. And because that albeit that God often doeth admonishe vs by his woorde to walke honestly, yet doe wee make no account thereof, and wil not acknowledge what our duetie is. For this cause to rebuke our negli∣gence, or rather our malice, God setteth beastes before vs, declaring vnto vs that they are of a better nature then wee be, and that they know wel how to doe their duetie: as we see in Esai the first Chap∣ter, and second verse, and in diuers places of these Prouerbes: and nowe the wise man setteth before vs three. And when such rebukes are giuen vs, they are not to confounde vs, but to make vs better aduised and more discreete, and also to be ashamed of that, that we must goe to the schoole with the beastes. The first of the three is, The Lyon, which is strong among beastes, not onely in his mem∣bers, but also of courage, and by the same his courage hee walketh fiercely in his way: and there is no beast howe strong or great so∣euer hee be, that may turne him or make him goe out of his way: and so he ordereth verie wel his steppes, and walketh comely. The wise man doeth not set before vs the crueltie of the Lyon: for if we did folowe him therein, we shoulde be like vnto the Deuil: but he 1. Pet. 5. 8. would haue vs to folow the courage, the boldnesse and nimblenesse of the Lyon, to the intent that whatsoeuer the Deuil or men can doe against vs, yet shoulde wee alwayes goe boldly forwardes, as God doeth teache vs by his word, and should in no wise be afraid. Herein it is, that we should be like the Lyon, as Solomon doth shew vs. By the seconde, that is, the Greyhounde that is lustie to runne, he doeth admonish vs, that we should not be like vnto the Snaile, Pro. 28. 1. that creepeth verie softly, but should be readie & diligent to runne our course: as wee are exhorted in other places of the scriptures, Psal. 119. 32 1. Cor 9. 24 Heb. 12. 1. 2. Tim. 4. 7. that we may truely say, I haue fought a good fight, I haue finished my course, I haue kept the fayth. And for to doe this wel, we must take heede from folowing of hungrie Dogs. For if we be gorbellies, gluttons and drunkardes, we can not be swift to runne our course, but desire to be at rest: as the Prophet Esai, in the 56. Chapter 10. 11. blameth the rulers of Israel. And therfore Iesus Christ doeth ex∣hort vs saying, Take heede to yourselues, that your heartes bee
not ouercome with surfeiting and drunkennesse, &c. Euen so must Luk. 21. 34 we take heede from folowing their enuie, but that rather we should be ioyful for the prosperitie of our neighbours, and sorie for their miserie: let vs not be like vnto Semei: nor like vnto the multitude of people which mocked at the affliction of our Lord: who are cal∣led 2. Sam. 16. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Mat. 27. 29. 40. Psal. 22. 17 Dogges. By the third, that is the Goate, which by a natural care and boldnesse that he hath, feeling himself armed with strong horns, doeth walke before the flocke, when they are ledde to pasture, wee are admonished, that for to walke rightly, we must bee an example vnto our neighbours, and to labour to goe before them by honest and holie conuersation, that they may folow vs. This belongeth vn∣to al Christians, and chiefly vnto those which haue any gouernment either spiritual or temporal: but wee must beware that we stincke not as Goates doe, least we be placed at the left hande. The fourth Mat. 25. 33. thing, whereby we are here admonished to order our manners and conuersation right, is not a beast, but a man, not vile nor abiect, but one that is in authoritie, and hath power ouer other, and is ru∣led with such wisedome, grauitie and seueritie, that hee is obeyed, without any resistance or rebellion. For although before the world we are not al Kinges, and that it is not lawful for vs to vsurpe to ourselues the Kingly authoritie, yet, forasmuche as we haue al na∣turally royal heartes (for wee woulde be content that al men were subiect vnto vs, and wee subiect to no man) it is therefore good reason that wee shoulde order our steppes as wise, seuere and graue Kinges, that we might so rule and raigne ouer our lustes, and our sinnes, that they shoulde haue no reigne nor rule in vs, as Saint Paule doth admonish vs in diuers places. And also, if wee be Christians, wee are Kinges. And in this, that wee are Kinges, it is not to reigne worldly. For our king∣dome Rom. 6. 12. Exo. 19. 6. Apo. 1. 6. Iam. 4. 1. 2. is not of this worlde, but is spiritual: the which if we wil quietly possesse, we must tame and subdue our lustes. After some we may say, that this parable sheweth, what the Prince ought to bee, to wit, lyke vntoo the Lyon, to the Greyhound and to the Goate: that hee may bee feared of the wicked, and loued and ho∣noured of the good. For the Lyon vseth no crueltie, except he be prouoked: & holdeth
in his nayles so fast as doeth the catte, and neuer displayeth and vn∣claspeth thē but only in the fight. Euen so should princes neuer ex∣ercise their wrath and displeasure, nor take weapon in hand but vp∣pon necessitie. The Greyhound doeth not persecute his guestes, but onely the wilde beastes: the Goate goeth before the flocke as a keeper: Euen so the Prince ought by good lawes to rule his flocke and to preserue it. If the princes doe thus gouerne themselues, no man wil rise vp or rebel agaynst them. For they haue GOD for their keeper, and defender against rebels and seditious subiects. 32 If thou hast beene foolish in lifting thy selfe vp, and if thou hast thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth. Of our vicious and corrupted nature, we are all senseles, and doe delight in our malicious foolishnes, and doe thinke wee are something and are readie through pride & arrogancie to exalte our¦selues aboue or against our neighbours, and which worse is, against God. And being thus senseles, we can not so much as think a good thought, but all euil. Therefore when the wise man speaketh con∣ditionally, Gen. 6. 5. & 8. 21. If thou hast. &c. We may resolue his woordes casually, in saying, forasmuch as thou hast been folish. &c. Whē he so speaketh, he teacheth vs, that although we of ourselues are nothing woorth within, yet ought we to take heede to be defiled in our conuersati∣on. And therefore let vs vnderstand, that he doeth exhort closely to labour to refourme our thoughtes, desires, purposes, counsels, affe∣ctions and lustes. For otherwise we cannot haue a quiet & modest conuersation: the which he signifieth, By laying the hande on the mouth. Mow he maketh mention of the hand, and the mouth, be∣cause by those members we shewe and exercise foolishnes, arrogan∣cie and malice which is within: with the hand we make signes of i∣niquitie, we steale, we vse shameles touching & feeling, & doe vio∣lence, in fighting, killing, & sleying. And for this cause the scripture reprocheth that they haue stretched out their hands vnto theuery & Esai. 1. that their hands are ful of blood, & also it doeth exhort vs to keepe thē innocent frō euil. From our mouthes come vain woordes, othes,
false othes, blasphemies, false witnessinges, tales, backbitinges and flatteringes: whereuppon doe folowe great inconueniences, and great offences: and are readie chiefly to misuse our mouthes, and it Iam. 1. 19. & 3. 2. is verie harde for vs to tame the same, and to cause it to keepe si∣lence, as it ought: as we prooue the same but too often, as also the scripture declareth it. Wherefore we must stande vpon our watch, folowing that which Dauid saieth, I wil take heede to my wayes, Psa. 39. 2. that I offende not with my tongue, &c. But forasmuche, as of our¦selues it is an vnpossible thing, therfore we must pray vnto God that it woulde please him to haue care to open and shut our mouthes, as Psa. 51. 17. & 141. 3. he shal see to be expedient: as the scripture teacheth vs to doe. 33 When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his nose, causeth blood to come out: so he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth strife. Albeit that Saint Paule saieth, Be angrie, but sinne not: yet is it not wel done at any time nor a man to be giuen and accustomed Ephe. 4. 26. Pro. 15. 18. & 26. 21. & 29. vnto wrath, nor to be sodeinly angrie, as Saint Paule doeth shew it, when he saieth, Let not the Sunne goe downe on your wrath. For also from thence doe proceede debates and strifes. He that forceth wrath: that is to say, which often and sodeinly is angrie, bringeth foorth strife. The wise man compareth such a man and his fruite, vnto two thinges, whereof the one is good, and the other euil: that is to wit, after the nature & kinde of butter, and sheading of blood. But the same maketh not the similitude fautie. For in a comparison it is not required that al the partes should agree and be like in eue∣rie pointe: it sufficeth that there bee some one pointe agreeable to the matter that is handled: otherwise there should bee in the Pro∣phets and Euangelists certaine comparisons verie absurd: the which we must neither thinke nor say. Therefore, albeit that it is profitable to beate and churne the mylke, to bring foorth butter, yet shoulde it be verie wickedly doone of a man, often or sodeinely to be angrie. For as of the beating and churning of the mylke, wee bring foorth butter, euen so, an angrie man stirreth vp and
prouoketh strife. And as by too muche wringing of the nose, wee wipe it not, but wring and make blood to come out, which is euil: euen so also of wrath and striefes doe oftentimes rise murders. The xxxi. Chapter. 1 THE wordes of king Lemuell: the prophesie which his mother taught him. AFter the Hebrwe and Latine exposi∣tours, Solomon is called Lemuel, 2. Sam. 7. 12. 13. that is to say, of God. For albeit that Dauid had elder sonnes then Solomon, yet was none of them or∣deined king but Solomon, according as God had foretolde Dauid by the Prophet Nathan. The which was perfourmed in Solomon. Nowe hee 1. Kin. 8. 20. 2. Sa. 12. 25. calleth the sentences following, his wordes: Because that hee hauing hearde them of his mother, had gathered them into writing. Wherein hee sheweth that albeit hee had beene the scholler of the Prophet Nathan, yet did hee not de∣spise the instruction of his mother, but had the same in great estima∣tion: as hee sheweth when hee calleth it a Prophesie, that is to say, doctrine, whereby his mother hath expounded vnto him the wil of God, as hee hath declared by his worde: as it is so taken in the 1. Cor, 14. verse. 1. And thus, this mother doeth wel shewe vnto the the great Dames and Ladies, and vnto al mothers, that they ought not to spende the time with the children, in talking of vaine things: but that they should haue the worde of God in their heartes, for to bee able to teache their children both by mouth and by example: as the Apostle Saint Paule doeth shewe them. I say expresly too bee able to teache their children. For though women bee neuer so 1. Tit. 5. 4. 1 Tit. 2. 3 1. Cor. 14. 34 1. Tim. 2. 11 wel learned, yet ought they not to take in hand to teach publikely as Ministers of the Churche. And albeit that wee finde it not writ∣tenin any other place, that the mother or Solomō hath taught him, yet ought it to bee enough for vs, that hee himselfe doth heere con∣fesse
it. And also it is to bee beleeued howe Dauid, who was a great Prophete, for to correct and amende the faulte that they had committed together during the life of Vrias her first husband, was careful diligently to instruct Bethsabe the mother of Solomon. Wee might also say that Solomon calleth his mother, the Church, in the which hee had beene taught by Nathan the Prophete, and by the Priestes. Howsoeuer it bee, when Solomon gathereth by writing that which had beene taught him, hee sheweth vs howe greatly careful and diligent wee shoulde bee to hold and lay vp that which is taught vs, for to frame thereby our manners and conuersation, that wee may teache our neighbours by good doctrine and holy conuersation. 2 What, my sonne? and what, the sonne of my wombe? and what, O sonne of my vowe? The mother of Solomon doeth wel declare how much she loued, him, when she is not satisfied with saying once, My sonne, but doth repeate it. And in the same repetition shee declareth how he is her sonne: that is to say, that she hath conceiued him in her wombe, that she did beare him with trauel and paine, that she brought him foorth with sorow, and nursed him vp. And albeit that diuers mo∣thers doe perswade themselues that their children ought to be con∣tented therewith, yet wil not she stay there, but euen as shee had nursed him corporally, euen so woulde shee also bee a spiritual mo∣ther. And also there with in remembring her wombe, shee sheweth him that he ought in no wise to despise her, nor to refuse her holy admonitions, & that she would teach him nothing, but that should bee for his profite, and that shee woulde not abuse him, to worke his destruction, seeing he is the fruite of her wombe. But moreouer for to declare vnto him her motherly affection, and howe she neuer forgetteth him, she calleth him the sonne of her vowe. Nowe wee often make vowes for to obteine that which wee greatly desire, and esteeme to be profitable, or necessary: as Iacob Gen. 28. 20. 21 doth. And thus, when she saith, What, sonne of my vowe? She de∣clareth that shee neuer ceasseth to pray for him, and to desire his health and prosperitie. And it is as much as if shee called him her
wel beloued sonne, on whom she setteth al her heart: as she did shewe the same indeede, 1. King. 17. When shee desireth Dauid for to erect and place Solomon in the kingdome, against Adonias. Moreouer, let vs note that these wordes are no flattering spea∣ches, but sweete declaratiōs, for to draw her sonne vnto obedience, and to teache him, what is his duetie, that hee shoulde not bee vn∣thankeful nor rebellious. 3 Giue not thy strength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to destroy kings. God by Moses taught kinges their lesson and what they should Deut. 17. 16 17. doe. Nowe Dauid had sworne vnto Bethsabe the mother of Solo∣mon, that her sonne shoulde reigne in his steede after him: for this cause she teacheth her sonne the same lesson: In the which GOD saith that the king shal not take vnto him many wiues. According to the which lesson she saith vnto her sonne, Giue not thy strength &c. That is to say, Giue not thy minde to followe and delight in many women, for to weaken thy selfe, both body and minde with them, and to consume thy substance in mainteining them, and to en∣tertaine them in pleasures, pompously, & voluptuously: as whoores doe dayly desire, and are as vnsatiable as graues: the which is the ouerthrowe and destruction of the rich and mightie: as the Giants, Gen. 6. & 7 Iudg. 16. and Sampson, haue prooued by expreience: and now Bethsabe doth declare vnto her sonne, when she addeth, Nor thy wayes, which is to destroy kings. For this is as much as if she said: howe great and mightie soeuer men be, yet if they be giuen vnto women, they seeke their ouerthrowe & destruction: the which also faileth not though it belong before it come: as Dauid hath tried it for a certaine time in the persecution of his sonne Absolom: as God had threatened him. And with the same destruction is Solomon threatened. And the executiō thereof was doone vpon his sonne Roboam. We might also say, that she saying, Giue not thy wayes, &c. doeth admo∣nish him that by his manners and conuersation he should not giue 2. Sam. 12. 10 1. Kin. 11. 11 & 12. 16 any euil example, the which woulde sende such kinges vnto de∣struction as shoulde followe it, or that woulde more ouerpasse him: as wee may see in Roboam. After some mens iudge∣ment, this mother doeth exhort her sonne to be well contented
with the kingdome, that God hath giuen him, and that he shoulde not striue to subdue the other kinges, for to get their countries, and further to enlarge his dominion. Al such exhortations are very fit and necessary to frame the manners of kings, & they do agree very wel vnto the lesson that is giuen them, neuerthelesse the most apte Deut. 17. sense in my iudgement is, that this mother doeth exhorte her sonne, not to apply himself, to any thing that might worke his ouer∣throw, when hee should be king: for the custome of the Hebrewes is to vse the singular for the plural, and plural for the singular. And so it shoulde bee as if shee saide, giue not thy wayes, while thou art a king to destroy thee. 4 It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes strong drinke. Wine is created in differently for al men. Al creatures of God are Psa. 104. 15 1. Tim. 4. 4 Rom. 14. 21. good, and nothing is to be refused when it is receiued with thanks giuing. Wherevpon wee may knowe that although it is good nei∣ther to eate fleshe, nor to drinke wine, yet neither the vse of wine, nor of other sweete and pleasant drinkes, ought to bee forbidden kinges and princes of the earth: seeing also that kinges are com∣monly better able to furnishe themselues with delicates then other. And therefore, let vs vnderstande that the vse of wine is not heere forbidden to kinges, but onely the ouermuch pleasure that is taken therein, and the excesse that is committed in it, though nothing els is spoken of but drinking: for the scripture in diuers places to ex∣presse Gen. 19. 31. Psal. 69. 13. Mat. 24. 8. intemperancie and drunkennesse, doth speake but of drinking. And wee also in our language, when wee woulde expresse the in∣temperancie of some men, doe say plainely and simply they drinke, or that they are drinkers. The which is much to be blamed in al per∣sons: for the scripture forbiddeth excesse to all men, and depriueth al drunkardes of the kingdome of God. But mention is made heere of kinges and princes for diuers causes. The first is, that this exhortation is directed vnto Solomon the sonne of king Dauid, & who was ordeined king after his father: whose mother did onely priuily exhort him: for being a woman, shee had not the publike
administration. The seconde is, that the kings and gouernours, a∣boue al other shoulde bee temperate and sober: for seeing it belon∣geth to them to punishe excesse, dissolutenesse, riotousnesse and of∣fences, therefore they shoulde serue for an example vnto the com∣mon people: so that they may not be checked: Awake ye drun∣kardes Esay. 1. 5. Esa. 56. 12 & 5. 11. 12. and weepe, &c. And forasmuch as they are iudges, they ought so to guide themselues: as that in iudging other, they condemne not themselues: and that it should not be reproched them & cast in their teeth, Why seest thou a mote in thy brothers eye, and conside∣rest Mat. 7. 3 not a beame in thine owne eye? The thirde is, that the kinges and great Lordes because of their great riches doe liue for the most Rom. 2. 1. part carelesly and idlely, and for to passe away their time ioyfully and merily, keepe good cheere, making feastes, drinkinges, bankettes, suppers, and reare suppers, superfluous & excessiue, and drinke and Esay. 28. 7. 8 eate almost til they bee ready to burst and to spue, as they are bla∣med for it. 5 Least hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction. The mother of Solomon doeth not set downe the former rea∣sons: but to auoide prolixitie and tediousnesse, shee toucheth the chiefest and principal: that is, that if kinges be giuen to wine, there is danger that they making no account of the lawe of God, shoulde ouerthrowe the right of the poore. Wherevpon we must first note, that which is written: When the king is placed in the throne of his kingdome, then shal he write out for himselfe a booke of this Deu. 17. 18. 19 lawe, wherein there is shewed vnto him, that hee ought not in any wise to turne away from the lawe of God, neither by contempt, nor by forgetfulnesse: much lesse by scorning or mocking. And for to a∣uoide these thinges, he ought to take heede and beware of wine: Pro. 20. 1 Osea. 4. 11. Esay. 28. 7 Esay. 1. 23. Psa. 82. 5. 6. 7 For wine is a mocker, &c. Whooredome, wine, and new wine, take away the heart. But they also haue failed by wine, and haue gone astray by drunkennesse. Secondly, let vs note that the great men of the earth despising the decree, and scorning thereof, doe giue themselues vnto corrup∣tion, as they are blamed therewith. Wherevpon God complaineth
of them, with threatening them. And this is that which the mother exhorteth her sonne to do, fearing least by wine hee shoulde change the right. And she saith expresly, of al the children of affliction: that is to say, of the miserable: for they are they whome God commen∣deth vnto vs. But it seemeth that they woulde despite God, foras∣much as it is a common thing through the world that the great doe eate the smal: as experience teacheth: and the scripture also com∣plaineth thereof. And the same is wel noted heere, when it is not simplie saide, The sonne of affliction, but al the sonnes of afflictions: as if it were said that a drunken king wil not be touched nor moued with compassion towards any poore, but wil be wicked, vnmerciful and cruel towardes al the miserable, for to shewe fauour vnto those that doe wrong. Thirdly, let vs note that she speaketh not but of the changing of the right and iudgement of the afflicted. For albeit, it is saide, thou shalt not respect a poore man in his cause, yet doeth God chiefly commende them vnto vs, because they are neuer maintained, but rather troden downe, and the riche and mightie fauoured: euen so to the ende that iudges shoulde bee aduertised of their office, and that hauing omitted and forgotten it, they might be more giltie and worthy of greater condemnation: and in steede that they haue de∣spised to deliuer the sonnes of affliction, they shalbee holden vnder affliction, from the which they may neuer be deliuered. Fourthly, let vs note, that although the kings haue diuers magistrates and iudges vnder them, yet ought they themselues to watche, for to yelde and to make other to giue right vnto whome soeuer it belongeth, and not to liue in pleasures. 6 Giue ye strong drinke vnto him, that is readie to perishe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart. Wyne was not onely created for necessitie, but also for to re∣ioyce a mans heart. According heeretoo the mother doeth admo∣nish Psa. 104. 15 her sonne and all those which haue the abilitie, to comforte the miserable and sorroweful, in giuing them eyther ale or wine to drinke, or other pleasant drinke, according to the
commoditie and vse of the countrie. Now she calleth such miserable and sorrowfull, readie to perish, or perishing: not to teach vs that which some vnmercifull and cruel men doe teach in poperie, that a man is not bound to help his neighbour, but in extreme necessity. For she calleth them not perishing or readie to perish, which are past helpe, as are they which are in extreme necessitie but those which haue sorowful heartes: as she herselfe doth expound it, when she commaundeth wine to be geuen to them which haue greefe of hearte. For except we care to helpe them, they tend vnto perdition. A sorrowfull spirite drieth the bones. Wherein wee may see shee Pro. 17. 22. hath not forbidden kinges and princes the vse of wine, but the ex∣cesse and curiousnes of drinking the finest and most excellent: for it may happen to kinges, to be readie to perish, and to haue greefe and sorow of heart. 7 That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miserie no more. She declareth to what end we ought to tende in giuing strong drink or wine vnto the miserable and greeued: to wit, to make them merrie, so that they may feele their miserie no more, to be tormen∣ted still. Wherein she sheweth that we must neither giue such sor∣rowful persons drinke too pinchingly, nor too abundantly, but meanely and indifferently. For as in drinking too little, their sorow should not be driuen away: euen so by drinking too much, they might forget the Law of God, the which might because afterwards of greatr and more greeuous sorow, that is to say, that forgetting Mat. 5. 17. Heb. 10. 26. Esay. 55. 1. 1. Cor. 10. 4. Exo. 17. 6. Mat. 11. 28. Iohn 4. 10. 14. & 6. 50. 51. 53. & 7. 37. the Law, they coulde hope for no saluation, but onely looke for an horrible condemnation and perpetuall torments. For in dispising the Law, wee despise Iesus Christ, who is not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it. Whereuppon it followeth they deserue to haue greater sorowe and greefe: as the threatning pronoun∣ceth. But wee must stoutly withstande such greefe, in drin∣king, not materiall wine, but spiritual drinke, whereto we are exhorted. And to bee partakers therof, we must come vnto Ie∣sus Christ, who is the rock of whom our fathers haue drunke. Iesus
Christ himselfe calleth vs, by declaring to vs what hee is. And dayly he couereth the table for vs, and offereth vs drinke and meate, by the preaching of his Gospel, and by the administration of his Sa∣cramentes. And thus, it chiefly belongeth vnto the ministers of the worde, to giue strong drinke vnto them, that are readie to perish, & wine to those which haue griefe of hearte. And also the scripture, Esay. 40. 1. 1. Cor. 14. 3. which the ministers must handle, serueth fit for the same. And Saint Paule in diuers places exhorteth vs to reioice in the Lord: & would also haue vs one to comforte an other. The which ought to be done in diuers sortes. 8 Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cause of al the chil∣dren of destruction. It seemeth vnto kings and gouernours of the earth, that they do their duetie wel, when hauing hearde the pleading of both parties, they iudge according as the matters haue beene alledged: and yet they see some simple & ignorant man that cannot alledge his right, nor declare his cause and matter, the which of it selfe is good, thus they wil perswade themselues, that they haue done their duetie ve∣ry wel, when they shal suffer their senses to be blinded by some bab∣ler and prater, that knoweth cunningly how to colour his pleading, to make his matter seeme good, the which is nothing worth. Such iudges and magistrates, for to iustifie themselues, and to wash their handes, wil say, The case and right is open and plaine to euery man, wee cannot iudge but according as the matters haue beene alledged and prooued. But if in this sorte the simple and ignorant bee depri∣ued of his right, the iudges are not absolued before God, who will examine, searche out and consider al pointes of the matter through∣ly. And forasmuch as they are his lieftenants, they ought therefore to folowe him: as also they are taught by his woorde. And also it is nowe shewed them, when it is said, Open thy mouth, &c. For they Psa. 10. 13. 14 Deu. 1. 13. 16 17. & 25. 1. Esay. 1. 17. cannot open their mouthes for the simple and ignorant, as they ought, without good inquisition. For although it is saide, Open thy mouth, &c. yet is it not to say that we should, whether the malice bee right or wrong, fauour the simple and weake: seeing it is said, Thou shalt not regarde a poore man in his cause. And it is not Exo. 23. 3. without cause, that they are thus admonished, seeing the worlde is
ful of people, who by their shadowes and coloures doe labour to darken the right of those that are not able to reuenge themselues, and therfore are called dumbe. This same is but too too much pro∣ued true: & againe it is signified vnto vs, when it is not said, In the cause or matter of some one sonne of variation and coulouring, but of all the sonnes of destruction: noting the great multitude of clokers and painters, & signifiyng that the simple are sore oppres∣sed of al sides, except the superiours bee very diligent too make en∣quirie, for to be able to open their mouthes to pronounce righte∣ous sentences, & to giue right vnto the simple & weake. After this sense we set the dumbe against the children of variance, or painting. But there are some which in place of variance, do say, of the trāsito∣rie worlde: and othersome of destruction and death, and other, of those which are forsaken. And in this sort there shoulde be no An∣tithesis, but it woulde behoue vs to resolue this present sentence, as if it were saide, defend him that is not able to defende himselfe, susteining their cause that goe to destruction, because no man ma∣keth account of them, but rather euery man seeketh their destructi∣on: as it is none other but the custome of the worlde. 9 Open thy mouth: iudge righteousnesse, and iudge the af∣flicted, and the poore. The scripture in steede of saying, iudge iustly, doeth say, iudge righteousnesse, or also iudge after righteousnesse. Such wordes are chiefly and most often directed vnto the rulers of the earth, because it is their office to minister righteousnesse and iustice: and most of∣ten they care nothing for it, but to liue deliciously and voluptuous∣ly they commit the same vnto such persons which for the most part are corrupted, and doe ouerthrowe the right. And thus in steede of opening their mouth to iudge righteousnes, they open their hands to take giftes and rewardes. They open their eares to heare flat∣tering tongues and praises of their freendes: they open their eyes to beholde their parentes, to looke vpon the riche and mightie, that they may fauour them against al right, and to the hurt and hinde∣rance of those which haue no maintenance, nor can reuenge them∣selues.
The which is a great wrong doone vnto God, who so care∣fully commendeth the poore vnto vs: as it hath beene diuers times shewed vs heeretofore. And therefore, the mother admonishing her sonne to open his mouth to iudge righteousnesse, or to iudge iustly, doth declare howe hee shall doe the same, when hee saith, That he should open his mouth to iudge the afflicted and the poore: that is to say, that hee shoulde defende and mainteine the cause of him that is oppressed and lacketh helpe, wanteth power and wealth: as also all iudges are exhorted there vnto. If this doctrine were wel printed in the heartes of kinges and rulers, the poore faithful ones, shoulde not bee so cruelly handeled and intreated, as they bee. Psal. 82. 3. 10 Who shall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles. Women of their nature are very light and vnconstant, and doe marre al, if a man suffer them to doe what they wil: as wee haue proued by experience in our first mother: whose daughters the wo∣men haue at al times shewed themselues to bee, in following her, yea in doing worse: as amongst other wee may place Dalila, Ieza∣bel and Herodias. And therefore it is not without cause that the wise man, as wondering and amased at the vnprofitablenesse of the malice of women, doth aske, Who shall finde a vertuous woman? a woman that hath good courage, and that doth diligently apply her¦selfe to doe her duetie in the feare of the Lorde, submitting herselfe and pleasing her husbande, and ruling her housholde, in the way of holynesse and righteousnesse, in sobernesse and temperancie, with diligence and care. An husbande that findeth such a wife, ought not to hate, reiect or despise her, except hee bee out of his wit or madde: but if the worlings do greatly delight in themselues when they haue thinges and iewels of great price, as siluer, golde, and precious stones, and if they esteeme these thinges greatly, how much more ought the husband to esteeme a vertuous, and a valiant wife. For as the wise saith heere, For her price is different from pearles: that is to say, farre more excellent. And it is good reason that the husbande (whose wife is valiant) shoulde not make ac∣count
of all the riches in the world, somuch as of his wife. And that for diuers causes. First of al, shee is created after the image and likenesse of God. Secondly, without the woman, man was not perfect. Thirdly, shee is fleshe of his fleshe, and bones of his bones. Gen. 1. 27. & 2. 18. 23. And the fourth reason, which is the chiefest, is that the woman is bought for as great a price as is the man: to wit, with the precious blood of the Lambe without spot. Whetevpon followeth the fifth, that she is heire of the heauenly kingdome: seeing that it is neither Gala. 3. 8. to male nor female: for yee are alone in Iesus Christe. Nowe as touching the the state betweene man and wife it is this, they ought to beecareful to walke in al modestie and gentle∣nesse one with an other: let the wife behaue herselfe vertuously in al subiection and obedience, that shee may compel her husbande greatly to loue her: and let the husbande for his part, be so gentle, and shewe her suche loue that hee may giue her occasion to be ver∣tuous: and let them in this sort edifie their families, by good ex∣amples, and cause them to liue holyly, 11 The hearte of her husbande trusteth in her, and he shall haue no neede of spoile. It is very meete that the worde to finde, which the wise man doth vse in the former sentence shoulde conteine in it selfe experi∣ence: for a man cannot bee contented with the wisedome of a wo∣man, neither can hee bring that he hath founde a vertuous woman, except hee hath tryed her. And also when it is sai, The hearte of her husbande, &c. The wise sheweth plaine that hee speaketh of experience, and not of a single meeting. For a discrete husbande, woulde not referre al to his wife, nor rest vpon her, nor commit the gouernment of his house vnto her, nor trust in her, vnlesse hee hath had good witnesse and experience of her. Hee sheweth al∣so that hee speaketh of a good and wise husband, and that is mo∣dest and of a setteled minde. For a wicked, foolish, hastie, or blockish man wil make no account of his wife, howe vertuous soeuer she be: and so cannot trust in her: but the good husbande and wise, hauing good testimonie of his wife, or hauing wel tried her, wil loue her, and so wel esteeme of her, that hee wil not enquire of her
gouernement, & wil not feare that he should spoile any thing, but will trust in her for all his domesticall and housholde affaires, and wil commit them al vnto her gouernement. And that for the loue he beareth vnto his wife, knowing her to be vertuous according to that which S. Paule sayth, Loue beleeueth al, hopeth al. &c, not that 1. Cor. 13. 7. he putteth his stedfast assurance of his saluation in his wife, or that he hath a certaine testimonie, that nothing shal perishe vnder her hand, when also he cannot promise that hee will saue himselfe: for Iere. 17. 5. such a trust is cursed. And when the wise addeth, and hee shal haue no neede of spoyle, hee sheweth moreouer that he speaketh of a good husband. For an euil man wil not bee satisfied with the vse of that which hee may lawefully haue, but wil by al meanes hee can, spoyle and get the goods of his neighbour, and wil neuer haue ynough in his fantasie. But the manners of the wise are without couetousnes, and is contented with present things: that is to say, with that which hee and his wife possesse, winne and get iustly, without dooing wrong, or oppressing of any other: and beeing thus content he shall haue no neede to spoyle his neighbours: for hee hath ynough, and wanteth no riches: the which are signified by the spoyles, because that the riches of a familie are made a spoyle and a pray to the ene∣mies in the tyme of warre. Besides this same, let vs note that men which take younge maydes in mariage (forasmuch as the mar∣riage according to the ordinance of God is a bande not to bee bro∣ken) are heere closely admonished to loue them, not for their cor∣poral beautie, nor for their riches, but to loue them in God: in such wise that knowing that younge maydens are not commonly wise, they shoulde bee careful and diligent to teache them, and to take paines to make them vertuous wyues, otherwise their hearts coulde not trust in them. On the other side the wiues are taught to become and yelde themselues to learne and to bee gentle, humble and obe∣dient, 1. Cor. 14. 34 1. Tim. 2. 1. 1. Pet. 3. 1. Ephe. 5. 22. 1. Cor. 11. 8. that they may winne the heartes of their husbandes, and that they giue them not occasion to iudge euil of them, nor to di∣strust them. This doctrine may also bee gathered out of the writings of S. Paule and S. Peter.
12 She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life. Hee sheweth that the good husbande shal not bee deceiued in trusting in his vertuous wife, and shal not bee frustrate of his hope, that is, that his wife wil not waste the goods of the house, but wil duely and orderly spend thē, & wil rather labour to augment & in∣crease them, then to diminish them. For as he saith, She wil doe him good: that is to say, shee taketh paines to encrease the riches of her husbande, and of her labour commeth profite to the house. And shee doeth no euill, that is to say, shee doeth him no hurt, nor wor∣keth him no trouble. And when she hath thus begunne, she ceasseth not, but continueth al the daies of her life. Wherein al wiues are ad∣monished neuer to ceasse from wel doing vnto their husbandes: o∣therwise they are rebelles, not onely against men, but also against God, who hath giuen the woman to man for his benefite, and to be an helper vnto him, not for a day or a yeere, but for euer: for God Gen. 2. 18. 24 Mat. 19. 5. 6. saith, It is not good that man shoulde liue alone: I wil make him an helper. And also hath ioyned them vnseparably together. The wiues ought therefore to continue in wel dooing vnto their hus∣bandes, and to worke them no trouble. And for to doe this wel, they must be humble and patient, modest and prudent for to winne their husbands, if they be chourlish and sharpe: and for to nourse and cherishe them, if they be gentle and gracious. And thus by wel doing they shal ouercome the euil with goodnes, and shal maintein goodnesse. 13 She seeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande. He beginneth to declare howe the wife for to shewe herselfe vertuous, yeeldeth and doth good vnto her husbande. Shee is not idle, nor negligent, shee is not curious in running from house too house, for to learne newes, nor to babble & to speake things which are not meete, and so to passe away the time vnfruitfully and vaine∣ly: but she is careful to handle & to deale with that which is meete
for the degree and estate of women, as is heere signified, when it is saide, shee seeketh wooll and flaxe: and she is not greeued to apply and occupie herselfe aboute these vile and contemptible things: but knowing that they agree with her estate, shee deighteth to woorke on them. She thinketh not herselfe dishonoured, nor also wearied though with her handes shee spinneth wool and flaxe, but her de∣lectation is to doe that which is profitable for her housholde. And also it is the duetie of wiues to take the care of the house: and the Apostle Saint Paule woulde haue them to gouerne the housholde, and to keepe the house. The which is not doone, if so bee that the wiues are delicate, and thinke highly of themselues, and that they 1. Tim. 5. 14. Tit. 2. 5. disdaine small workes, the which notwithstanding are profitable & necessary for their family, for to clothe and array them. Women ought naturally to vnderstande this same: but yet to helpe nature and to stir it vp, the holy Ghost disdaineth not to humble himself e∣uen so farre as to declare vnto them howe they ought to behaue themselues in their housholde: and that when they worke suche workes without couetousnesse, they doe that which is pleasing vn∣to God. And therfore, let them apply themselues diligently with∣out contempt, howe noble or riche soeuer they bee. They that de∣desire matter of high speculation, wil mocke this, which we ought to praise and honour, seeing it is the doctrine of the holy Ghost, for we must not count that vile which it pleaseth him to teach. And therefore let not the husbandes despise their wiues, which apply themselues in working those thinges which seeme of smal impor∣tance, when they doe that, that God teacheth them by his woorde, and by his spirite. 14 Shee is like the shippes of merchantes: shee bringeth her foode, from a farre. It is a very profitable thing to haue merchantes, that may sende ships to the Sea and to the riuers, to fetch prouision from far coun∣tries, to helpe the countrie that hath neede. And for this cause God hath made the Sea and the riuers nauigable: as it is after a sort giuen vnto vs to vnderstande, when God gaue man Lordship o∣uer Gen. 1. 28. Psa. 107. 23 the fishes in the Sea. But merchants doe greatly abuse them,
committing themselues to the dangers of the Sea & riuers by am∣bition, curiousnesse and auarice, desiring to become great, to see di∣uers countries for to feed their eies, and to learne to talk of far coun∣tries & at pleasure: and chiefly desiring to waxe rich, without care of helping the needie either of their owne countrie or of ano∣ther. It is enough for them to gaine much: as they are rebuked by Iames in his fourth Chapter, verse 13. And because they are so euil affectioned, God doeth oftentimes ouerthrowe their enterprises, & destroieth their riches, and beateth downe their pride: as he threat∣neth Esay. 23. 10. them by his worde: and as we haue seene the execution ther∣of also. And albeit that the trades which they vse, bee profitable, yet their intent is wicked. And also the wise woman doth not com∣pare the vertuous woman vnto merchants which send ships to the waters, but onely to the ships, that are loaden, and may bee ruled. Euen so the vertuous woman receiueth the charge and office which it pleaseth God to lay vpon her, and suffereth herselfe to bee gouer∣ned of God by his holy spirite: and by this gouernment, and not of herselfe, Shee bringeth her foode from farre: that is to say, she ta∣rieth not to worke, til her family bee in extreeme necessitie, but shee prouideth from a farre, and laboureth to preuent pouertie, without distrust in God. For hee woulde haue vs to labour, to sow, to reape, and to lay vp: & also he giueth fit & conuenient seasons therfore: and those which despise them, are so farre from trusting in God, that rather they tempt him, because they would liue without the meanes that hee hath ordeined. And if the wiues: which are the most wea∣kest vessels, must be such puruieours, by a more strong reason then ought the men to bee very vigilant, without caring for to morrow: as they are admonished. Mat. 6. 25. 15 And shee riseth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her housholde, and the ordinary to her maides. For too shewe that it is not by auarice, nor of desire to bee finely kept, that the vertuous wife doeth bring her foode from farre, the wise woman doeth well declare, howe vigilant and
careful she is, when she lyeth not in bedde til the day is come, but riseth, whiles it is yet night. She declareth also that she spareth not to giue whatsoeuer is necessarie and expedient vnto her housholde, not only vnto her owne children, but also to those which serue her, and doe the businesse of the house. Wherein wee haue to note, first of al, that in praysing the vertuous woman for that shee riseth be∣fore day, she admonisheth al strong persons & such as are in health, not to be giuen to loue sleepe, but to be readie to rise vp early, after hauing taken conuenient and necessarie sleepe, to make them more apte and meete to holde out and continewe al the day in their vo∣cation, and not that they shoulde waxe slouthful and negligent, as do those which sleepe too long. This admonition ought to be recei∣ued of al persons of good health, and also kept, vnlesse they wil bee blamed with the slouthful, and be in danger of pouertie as they are. And though they came not into the like dāger, yet should they loue Pro. 6. 9. to rise very early and betimes in the morning: for not onely it hath beene praised at al times, and of al people of sounde iudgement, be∣cause it is healthful for the body, and that they may haue the more time and leisure to do their businesse: but also (which is far better) the early rising is fit for to meditate the workes of God, to cal vpon him, to giue him thankes, and to sing praises vnto him: as wee may see in diuers psalmes: and also to doe pleasure and seruice vnto our neighbours. And albeit the wise woman doeth praise the rising be∣fore day, and doeth attribute and giue the same vnto the vertuous woman, yet is it not to say that she blameth al those which doe not so. For we ought not to make and appoint a lawe or one egall rule for al men, when the complexions are not alike. For one man may better for beare sleepe & to watch, then another. Notwithstanding, let them which are of an healthful and strong cōplection, take heede from perswading themselues that they shoulde spoile themselues, if they rose early in the morning: for then they shold not be vertuous women, but very slouthful. Secondly, let vs note, when the vertuous womā is praised, giuing the portion to her housholde, &c. That it is not meete for women to prepare delicates, but they must bee dili∣gent to prouide for the housholde, and to flye ydlenesse. Thirdly, when she giueth the ordinarie portion, women are taught to be∣ware that their houshold make no excesse in eating and drinking
too abundantly: and also that they doe not deny them such things as are necessary for them, but that they do faithfully distribute them to them, that the housholde fal not in to sicknesse, but being sustei∣ned, nourished, and fed with a competent portion, they may be oc∣cupied about their worke as it behooueth. And for to doe this wel, they haue neede of liberal husbands, and which wil not be too hard and straight: for suche husbands wil not suffer willingly that there shoulde bee an ordinary trade, and reasonable for the maintenance of their housholde seruants, and cannot see expenses to bee made, so sparing and niggardly are they. After the iudgement that we haue giuen vpon this sentence, there is a repetition: but there are some which by the ordinary or appointed portion, doe vnderstand the works and businesse where about the vertuous woman doth set her maidens giuing vnto euery one her charge and taske, that they should not be idle, but shoulde spende the day in labour, and should not take and eate their meate for nothing. And in this the seruants and maidens are admonished to looke wel wherevnto they are cal∣led: that is to say, that they should not eate the goods of their maisters and dames, but onely by labouring faithfully. This admo∣nition belongeth also to those which are hyred for an other. 16 She considereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes she planteth a vineyard. For to make her sentence briefe and short, she telleth not what it is that mooueth the vertuous woman to consider the field: but when God forbiddeth vs to couet, we must vnderstande, that the vertuous woman doeth not desire to buy away the goods of her neighbour, except that he himselfe doeth offer it, and set it foorth to sale. And so, forasmuche as the fielde is offered vnto her, and that shee knoweth not of what value it is, nor what she shal giue for it, shee considers it, least shee should buye, shee knewe not what, as it is saide: and also that keeping loue (whereunto we are al bound) she should not take the field of her neighbour for a morsel of bread, but that she would giue him a reasonable price for it: as she would haue done to her, if she were in steed of the seller: otherwise shee should be a theef, yea, a murtherer: as are al those which draw to thē
the goods of other men almost for nothing, respecting nothing but their particular profite. It is saide that she considering it, shee get∣teth it: not for nothing,nor yet of the substance of her neighbors: as there are diuers which suttlely drawe vnto them the monie of their neighbours to buy land withal: but the vertuous woman buy∣eth lande of the substance that she iustly possesseth, as it is wel signi∣fied, when it is saide, With the fruit of her handes, &c. Shee cal∣leth that the fruit of her handes, which she iustly possesseth by her trauel, care, and diligence, or otherwise, without the hurt of her neighbours. Nowe when the vertuous woman is thus praysed, we may vnderstande, that it is lawful to sel and to buye fieldes and vin∣yardes, but yet let it be with the fruit of our handes, and not with other mens monie: and also God in his lawe permitteth vs to buye lande. Moreouer, when shee planteth a vineyarde, that is to say, when she is careful in woorking in the field that shee hath bought, Leuit. 25. 14 and that shee maketh the same to profite, shee sheweth vnto wo∣men that they ought not to be delicious, but that they must applye themselues vnto woorke, when it is necessarie. Whereupon folow∣eth, that men which are commonly more mightie then women, ought not to spare themselues, but eate their bread in the sweate of Gen. 3. 17. 19 their face: as God hath commanded them. 17 She girdeth her loynes with strength, and strengtheneth her armes. It was the maner of our elders in old time to be clothed with long gownes, of what state soeuer they were. And we knowe that long gownes do much hinder: and for this cause, when they would trauel, and doe any thing with diligence, or fight against their ene∣mies, Exo. 12. 11 1. Kin. 18. 26 2. King. 4. 29 Iere. 1. 17. Esai. 5. 27. or runne a race, or take a voyage, they trussed and girded vp their garments about their loynes, and that so straight, that they should not fal downe. They trussed them vp (I say) when they went a voyage, when they ranne, when they walked, when they began to work, when they fought, when they did work. And for this cause, for to shew the force, diligence and care of a vertuous woman, and howe shee did not spare herselfe, the wise saieth,
She girdeth her loynes with strength, &c. The girdle buckeled straight, sheweth the diligence: and when it is saide, And streng∣thened her armes, there is shewed that shee spareth not herselfe: for to strengthen the armes, is nothing els but strongly & with great courage to laye the handes to the worke. Wherein the women are admonished not to become delicate: and because that the precious garments doe often hinder vs from working (for we feare to soyle Luk. 12. 35 1. Tim. 2. 9. 1. Pet. 3. 3 or to vse them) let them folowe the doctrine that S. Paule and S. Peter teacheth. 18 Shee feeleth that her merchandise is good: her candle is not put out by night. By her merchandise we vnderstande al the workes wherto the vertuous woman doeth applye herselfe, for to bring in riches vnto her husbande. When shee feeleth, or shee tasteth that her woorkes please her husbande, and bring profite vnto the house, shee ceaseth not to apply the same: as it is signified, when it is said. Her candle, &c. For the burning candle or Lampe, signifieth that the person is not giuen to be idle, but that she waketh about her businesse, and guideth herselfe rightly therein, foreseeing what shee hath to doe. Whereunto wee are al called: and chiefly diligently to vnderstand and carefully to occupie ourselues about that which belongeth to the seruice of God and our saluation. True it is, that the Lampe or candle which is not put out by night, signifieth in other places, con∣tinual prosperitie, ioye, comfort and glorie, which the vertuous do Mat. 25. 1. Luk. 12. 35 Psal. 18. 29 Pro. 13. 9. & 24. 20. Ier. 25. 10. inioy, what troubles soeuer doe happen to them in the worlde. And we may also vnderstande it by that, that the wicked are threatened that their Lampe or candle shalbe put out. But the first exposition doeth seeme to me the best agreeing to the line of the text. 19 She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the spindle.
He continueth in declaring howe the vertuous wife doth good vnto her husbande, in applying herselfe to spinning: the which is a woorke meete for women: the which ought not to be contemned, though it seeme not a thing of any great profite. But forasmuch as the holie Ghost admonisheth women to ap∣plye themselues thereto, therefore they ought to folowe this doc∣trine, neuerthelesse without refusing greater woorkes, when they can applye themselues theretoo. And when their mindes is not able to reache higher after the worlde, let not the husbandes chafe thereat, though there seeme to them litle gaine to come therof. And there are some husbands, which had rather they should playe then woorke. 20 Shee stretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie. Albeit that the vertuous woman is verie attentiue vnto her woorke, and that by this meanes shee laboureth to doe good vnto her husbande, yet is shee not ledde with couetousnesse, nor with desire of decking herselfe: and hath not onely care to prouide for her housholde seruantes, but also shee hath pitie and compassion of the poore and miserable: not with wordes onely, but really and indeede. Shee sheweth mercie towardes them, for she woorketh for them with her handes, helping them at neede: as it is declared in this sentence, by a repetition, the which ought to serue for our re∣membrance, that both men and women which haue the wealth of this worlde, might remember to succour the poore and needie. It serueth also to admonishe the husbandes that they bee not vexed though their wiues do giue themselues to the seruice of the poore: but that rather they should stirre them vp theretoo: and that they may be occupied therein, to giue their wiues wherewith to do it. 21 Shee feareth not the snowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.
He hath saide, He that giueth to the poore, shal not want: and nowe he sheweth the effect. For hauing commended the mercy of the vertuous woman, hee declareth that she exerciseth it without distrust, and without thinking in the harde time that either shee or her familie shalbe grieued and pinched with any neede: for as hee saieth, She feareth not, &c. By the snowe, he signifieth the sharpe and harde seasons and weather, the which are verie harde to be pas∣sed of the poore hungersteruen which are al too true, yll shod, and haue colde nourishment. After this declaration, he sheweth that be∣ing liberal towardes the poore, she hath no neede, when hee saieth, For al her familie, &c. It seemeth at the first sight, that this is the reason, for the which the vertuous woman doth not feare the snow, &c. But by the consideration of her good furniture (the which is signified, by double garments, or by the Scarlet, as some doe inter∣prete it) shee was ledde not to feare, she should be carnal, if she tru∣sted in the abundance of her riches: and so she should not bee ver∣tuous, but foolishe: as was the riche man spoken of in Luke. And she should be of the number of the worldlings, which think them¦selues Luk. 12. 16. safe, and that they shal not want, because they haue great pro∣uision. This is not the reason then, nor the consideration for the which she doeth not feare: but the wise declareth, that her liberali∣tie shal not bring her any hurt, but that she shal haue enough for al that: wherewith shee is wel armed and prouided against the most harde and sharpe seasons of weather: and being so prouided, shee needeth not to feare the stormes and tempestes. For if in pouertie and affliction we should not feare the euil, but be assured that God both doth and wil assist vs, without forsaking vs, so much the lesse haue we a reason to feare, or to distrust, whē God sheweth liberali∣tie vnto vs, giuing vs abundance, but we must reioyce in our Lord, who giueth vs al thinges abundantly for to vse, not putting our trust in these earthly creatures, but in the liuing God. Hee setteth also before vs, the care that the vertuous woman hath to prouide thinges for her seruauntes, for to keepe them, and to mainteine 1. Tim. 6. 17. them in health, least women shoulde accustome themselues to be negligent and idle. And let vs note, that it is expresly sayde, that it is against the
colde, and not to cloath her familie gorgiously, and to giue them chaunge of rayment for a brauerie: as do the proud women, which desire to goe braue, and also to shewe their children braue: and be∣cause of their brauerie, they thinke that other are not woorthie to come neere them. Yet this is not to say, but that it is lawful to haue Luk. 16. 19 Iam. 5. 1. Esai. 58. 7 Mat. 5. 42. Luk. 3. 11 Iam. 2. 15. 1. Ioh. 3. 17 18. chaunge of garmentes: so that therein we take heede from beeing like vnto the rich, spoken of in S. Luke: nor to the rich, to whome horrible threatninges are made. And for to redresse and amend this same, let vs folowe that which is taught vs: when thou seest one that is naked, cloath him, and hide not thy selfe from thine owne fleshe: and suche like admonitions. 22 She maketh herselfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment. By these present wordes wee may knowe that it is not onely lawful for vs to vse thinges that are necessarie for vs, but also delec∣table and pleasant: and chiefly, when with delectation there is pro∣fite, and that they serue to some honest and decent vse, and not to excesse, dissolutenesse, vanitie, ostentation and brauerie. For our good God doeth allowe vs that we shoulde delight modestly in cunning woorkmanships: and also it is himselfe that giueth man the know∣ledge to doe them. And thus it is lawful to haue ornaments, but we must not spende al our time therein, as diuers doe. The wise doth shewe it, when after hauing made mention of necessarie woorkes, he speaketh of delectable, preferring them vnto the necessarie. And let vs not thinke that the wise doeth prayse brauenesse, and esteeme it: but let vs knowe that he prayseth the vertuous woman, because that shee is so diligent about her woorke, that by her diligence shee prouideth for her familie, not onely necessarie thinges, but also pleasant ornaments, which are not vnprofitable.
23 Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande. When a maried wife is vertuous, and that she is knowne such an one, her husband is not despised, except he be altogether a foole and vnprofitable: but forasmuch as it belongeth vnto the man who is the head, to direct his wife, both by doctrine and by deedes, ther∣fore when it is seene that his wife proceedeth vertuously, he is pray∣sed and honoured, hee is raysed vp to dignitie and authoritie, and hath a good name among the great which are truely antient in ma∣ners and conuersation, and not onely in yeeres. The good name is noted, when it is saide, That he is knowne in the gates: by the which those are signi∣fied which haue the gouernment of the people, because that in them they gathered themselues together to commen and talke of their matters, and to pleade the lawe. The dignitie and authoritie is sig∣nified, when it is saide, He sitteth, &c. Nowe although that none ought to affect the chiefest roomes, yet euerie one should take paine to make himselfe capable, that he may duely exercise his office, whē it shal please God to make him sit amongst the elders. For by the wisedome of God doe Kinges raigne, and the Counsellours decree Pro. 8. 15. 16 iustice. After some we may say, that the wise vnderstandeth that the husbande, knowing that his wife is vertuous, doeth keepe good and continual residence in the iudgement seate, for to handle suche matters as shalbe offered, and hasteth not home, but taking care of the common matters, hee committeth to his wife al the housholde affayres: and so dooing, he getteth a good name, and is in good re∣putation. Neuerthelesse this is not to say, that we ought to thrust in ourselues to medle with the common wealth, except we be cal∣led: but let euerie man keepe beneath, til it please God to raise him vp. 24 She maketh sheetes, and selleth them, and giueth gir∣dles vnto the merchant.
He returneth to prayse her for her house wiuerie, and for her merchandise, the which she gouerneth carefully to make it to pro∣fite. And when hee saieth, She maketh, and then, selleth and gi∣ueth, He sheweth that it is of her labour shee selleth. Wherein the Merchantes and shop women haue their lesson: that is to say, that they ought to woorke and to labour to gaine their liuing, and not to be idle in their shoppes, for to marke the merchandises that passe by them, that they may buye them at a lowe price, afterwardes for to make them deare and to rayse the price, and to sel them them so deare as they can, to the hurt of the common people. The same is to flea of the skinne, to eate the fleshe, and to breake the bones. And this trade hath the verie Heathen greatly blamed, to wit, to buye that which we wil sel againe immediately much deerer. Such as fo∣lowe this trade, are Ingrossers, and are woorthie of malediction and cursing: and also it is said, The people wil curse him that withdraw∣eth the corne: but a blessing shalbe vpon the head of him that sel∣leth Pro. 11. 26. corne. And also the vertuous woman is praysed for that shee selleth, and giueth the woorkmanship of her handes to sel. 25 Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day she shal reioyce. He hath spoken of the corporal vesture and cloathing, wherwith the vertuous woman is cloathed: and nowe, for to shewe that she setteth not her affection vpon such ornamentes, as doe foolish, vaine and curious women, which desire to please the eyes of the world, he declareth that shee hath an other garment farre more excellent: that is, that with the earnest minde shee hath to doe good vnto her husbande, and to prouide for her familie, and not to be weerie nor vnprofitable, shee applyeth herselfe stoutly vnto good woorkes: wherewith she is strengthened more and more, and getteth glorie and honour. And thus her clothing, wherein she chiefly deligh∣teth, is strength and honour. And suche clothing is much more ex∣cellent, then are the gorgeous garments of the worldlinges.
For though for a certaine time the worldlinges are ioyful in their pompe, yet haue they afterwardes sorowe and mourning: as they Luke. 6. 24. Iames. 5. 1. Luke. 16. 23 Esay. 3. 15. are threatened therewith: and as we haue an example therof in the riche. And thus hath it happened vnto the daughters of Sion, ac∣cording vnto the threatening of Esay: But the cloathing of the wa∣king and watchful wife, bringeth perpetual ioye: as it is signified, when it is said, and in the latter day she shal reioice. Wee may take this latter day after three sorts. First of al for the time of olde age, wherein the worldlings do commonly lament, because they cannot laugh and reioice as they did before, and that their olde age is filled with miserie. But they which in the flower of their age haue beha∣ued themselues manly and valiantly, and haue of a free minde appli∣ed themselues to doe wel, are not grieued for old age, but beare the same patiently, and what euil soeuer they suffer, yet they cease not to bee glad and ioyful. Secondly, for the time wherein temporal death approcheth. Then are the worldlinges greatly tormented in their consciences, the which do reproue thē for their pompe, pride, vanities and follies: but those which haue bene delighted to worke righteously, do then reioice, being assured of the remission of their sinnes. Thirdly, for the day of the last resurrection, wherein those which haue bene wel and profitably occupied, shal haue great cause of ioy. For they shal possesse the kingdome of heauen, & the world∣lings shal haue cause of mourning for the tormentes that they shal suffer. Or if ye wil take this worde, in the latter day shee shall re∣ioice, Mat. 25. 34. 35. more simplie, that is to say, that the vertuous woman shall haue continual prosperitie and ioye: what time soeuer happen, the sense shalbe meete ynough. After what sorte soeuer we take it, wo∣men are admonished to be modest, and sober in decking themselues, and to apply themselues with a free hearte vnto woorke and la∣bour. 26 She openeth her mouth with wisedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue. As she behaueth herselfe vertuously in her busines and workes, euen so doeth she also in her words. The worldly women do thinke themselues very vertuous when they can open their mouthes rea∣dily
to pronounce that which commeth in their fantasie, without discerning whether the woordes they talke bee meete or no: but the vertuous woman is guided by wisedome to speake that which is conuenient. Wherein the women which desire to speake wel, are admonished to giue their heartes to learne wisedome, not to labour to please the wise of this worlde by their wordes, as do they which haue sogred mouthes, but to vtter forth wordes of edification, and such as doe not prouoke their neighbours vnto wrath or despyte: but by softe and gentle woordes woulde winne the heartes of their neighbours, after the example of the vertuous woman, which hath the lawe of grace in her tongue: that is to say, that doeth so rule and guide her tongue, that it serueth as it were for a booke, out of the which is learned al goodnesse, wherewith wee may iudge that her hearte is filled. For from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. And thus the women are taught, that for to bee vertu∣ous and to shewe themselues such, they must suppresse their na∣ture, the which is sodainely to speake foolishly, to bee spiteful, and lightly to bee angry. And for to doe this suppression, let them fol∣lowe the vertuous woman, according as the wise doeth briefly at this present teache them, and as Saint Paule doeth more largely in diuers places. And therefore they ought to giue their mindes vnto the reading of the holy scritpure, and to hearing of sermons of the woorde of GOD, which is the true wisedome of all the fayth∣ful. 27 She considereth the wayes of her housholde, and eateth not the bread of ydlenesse. The vertuous woman hath not a faint nor effeminate heart, as haue they which are contented to bee dintily nourished and kept, and yet care to knowe howe they shoulde gouerne in the house. They rest, they pastime and take their pleasure, and labour to liue in wantonnesse, and leaue al the charge vnto their husbandes: but shee considereth howe shee shoulde gouerne her children and o∣ther her housholde seruantes, which are contained vnder the word of housholde: that shee may cause them to spende the tyme in well dooing. And it is not to bee discharged in charging them: but to the
ende to shewe them the way that they shoulde holde, she herselfe laboureth diligently: as the wise doeth signifie, which saith not on∣ly, She considereth, but also that she eateth not the bread of ydle∣nesse. In the same she giueth an instruction to her housholde that they ought to labour, and to eate their bread in the sweate of their face. And also she sheweth vnto women that they ought not to eate, except they worke. 28 Her children rise vp, and call her blessed: her husbande also shal praise her. Because that the vertuous woman taketh care both of the bo∣dies and soules of her children, as it hath beene declared in the for∣mer sentences, therefore it commeth to passe that her children doe growe in age and wisedome, in counsel and discretion: as the wise doth signifie it, saying, her children rise vp. And being thus growne and increased corporally and spiritually, they haue a true knowledge of the care that their mother had of them, and howe shee hath wrought vertuously, for this cause they doe greatly esteeme her, they doe praise her and honour her, and speake of her as of her that must al waies prosper, and neuer be ouercome with euils. The which the wise doth signifie, saying, and cal her blessed. On the other side, her husband also seeing her conuersation so vertuous, and that by her meanes his children haue wel profited, cannot blame her, but beeing contented with her, speaketh of her al the good he can possi∣bly: as the wise addeth, saying, Her husband also shal praise her. If we shal take this word rise vp, more simplie, that is to say, for they come forth, and shew them∣selues to declare the praises of their vertuous mother, and to bring her in reputation in the world, there shalbe no inconuenience. But in what sense soeuer it is takē, we must vnderstand this same of aged children, wel taught, & wel manneried. For little children, which are without discretion, cānot so speake, except that we wil say that their good bringing vp, sheweth that their mother is wel worthy to bee praised, for the care that she had & stil hath to gouerne & to bring thē vp godly. And indeed, whē we see the children of a house to bee
godly brought vp, we cannot forbeare, but must praise & commend their mother. Wherein children are taught not to bee vnthankeful towards their mothers, and not to be ashamed to acknowledge and confesse openly, howe much they are bounde vnto them. The which they cannot do, except they greatly esteeme her, & greatly loue her: otherwise also their praise shoulde be but dissimulation. The hus∣bands also are heere admonished to content themselues with their wiues, when they take paines to do their office and duetie. And we to do this, let them not bee seuere and sharpe, but gentle and amia∣ble, bearing with their wiues, whē through infirmitie or ignorance they do not so wel as they wishe they shoulde doe. 29 Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou hast sur∣mounted them all. We shal see in the worlde many great housewiues, who by their care and diligence, by their greedinesse and couetousnesse, in spa∣ring and locking vp, in gathering together and drawing to them, by right or by wrong, wil become riche. But although in so doing they heape together great abundance of riches, and that they come to great wealth, yet is it nothing, or very little, in comparison that the vertuous woman doeth: as wee may see it by that which hath beene rehearsed of her, from the 10. verse hithertoo. It is most of∣ten seene to happen, that the wealth of those great housewiues, doth sodainely vanishe and come to nothing: but that which the vertu∣ous woman getteth, continueth, as wee may see by this present re∣hearsal, and amongst other places in the 25. verse, when it is said that shee shal reioice and laugh in the last day. For there are many which delighting in their prosperitie, are at the last constrained to lament their miserie, as they are threatened therewith in Esay chapter 32. 9. but the wealth righteously gotten shalbee of continuance by the blessing of the Lorde. In steede that wee haue saide, they haue got∣ten wealth: wee might say, they haue wrought valiantly, or they haue done vertuously. For there is the very selfesame worde of the 10. verse, the which hath beene translated, vertuous. And the sense shoulde not bee vnfit, but shoulde bee as if it were said, That there are many wiues which haue some kinde or parte of vertue: and in
deede they doe some things that are worthie of praise: but yet the same is nothing in comparison of that which the wife truely ver∣tuous doeth. 30 Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a wo∣man that feareth the Lorde, shee shalbee pray∣sed. The maidens and wiues of their corrupt nature are curious, & desire to see such things as profite them nothing, but rather do hurt them and bring them to dishonour: as Dina and Thamer. Likewise Gen. 34. & 38. 13. they desire to be seene, and to please the eyes of worldlings. And to do the same, they colour and paint themselues to seeme faire, and of a beautiful hewe, and pleasant countenance. And this is that which the wise calleth fauour and beautie. And such painting and coun∣tenance doeth wel like the worldlings, whose eyes are ful of adulte∣rie: they praise and commende such women as can disguise and trimme vp themselues: and in their minde and fantasie they shall seeme to bee fine and honest: but they which shal walke faithfully and plainly, shalbe counted foule and vncomely. Wherein they are deceiued, as the wise doth shewe, when hee calleth fauour deceit∣ful, and beautie vanitie: declaring that those which colour them∣selues with such fauour and beautie, are deceiued. And heerein hee saith nothing which hath not alwaies bene proued by experience, e∣uen from the beginning of the world. Adam found and sawe fauour in his wife when he yelded to take the forbidden fruite of her hand. The sonnes of God, sawe great beautie in the daughters of men. Si∣chem Gen. 3. & 6. & 34. sawe that Dina was faire. But they were aldeceiued, & found not that which they looked for: and in steede to finde happines, they fel into greate troubles, as the ende hath shewed. And in folowing the same ende it is written, many haue beene deceiued by the beau∣tie of women: for by it is loue kindled as it were a fire. Wherein we may see that the wise yelding and applying himselfe vnto our kinde Eccle. 9. 10. of speeche, vseth heere this worde fauour vnproperly. For properly to speake, fauour is the good wil that wee beare to another, with∣out his deseruing. And such women as woulde bee founde faire, do not seeke to shewe or to beare fauour, but most often do sel them∣selues
to them, that wil giue most. Notwithstanding, for al that, they wil labour to persuade their whoremongers, that they shewe them much fauour in yelding themselues ouer vnto them: though they take giftes and presentes of them: and the poore fooles (so muche are they deceiued) wil againe thanke them greatly for it: as though they had receiued some great benefite, and that they were much beholding vnto them. And in this maner they prayse and e∣steeme that which is nothing, but vanitie and deceit, yea very hurt∣ful and pernicious vnto them, which linger after such fauour and beautie. For they which colour themselues, and desire to seeme faire and of comely fauour, and they which delight therein, are both ca∣ried and led of the Deuil, who is a lyer and a deceiuer, and the fa∣ther of lying and deceit. The women therfore which labor to make thēselues to seeme faire, are not to be praised nor commended, but 1. Pet. 3. 4. they whose vertuous heart being hidden, is without corruption, & of a milde and quiet spirit. For although the voluptuous worldlings doe nothing esteeme such vertuous women, yet forasmuch as they are highly esteemed with God, wee must therefore greatly esteeme them also: as wee are heere thereof admonished, when it is saide, but a woman that feareth, &c. For when the wise man saieth, shee shalbe praised: the same is asmuch as if hee saide, that she ought to bee praised, and had in good reputation, honour and to be blessed & saued so much as possibly may be from dishonor. For it is good rea∣son that wee shoulde praise and esteeme that which our God prai∣seth and loueth. Nowe that he praiseth the vertuous woman, the wise man sheweth, when hee attributeth vnto her, the feare of the Lorde: for al they which feare him are welcome vnto him, he doeth assist them and keepe them: as hath beene handled alreadie in diuers places. Therefore if women wil obtaine true praises, they must haue then the feare of the Lorde: the which is shewed foorth by honest and holy conuersation, and when they apply themselues to that which God commandeth in his lawe. 31 Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praise her in the gates. Although that of ourselues wee doe nothing that is ought
worth, and that wee wel deserue to bee blamed, euen for the best & most perfect workes which proceede from vs, in the greatest trueth and sinceritie that we are able, (for they are neuer such as they ought to bee: and that which is good in them, commeth not from vs, but from God, who worketh in vs both the wil and the deede, accor∣ding to his good pleasure) yet, if wee wil suffer the holy Ghost to re∣generate and to sanctifie vs, that we may walke in newnesse of life, that we are at defiance with the worlde, and doe not yeelde thertoo, but doe striue to folowe the good wil of our God, hee wil cause vs to be praised, as though we ourselues were authors of the goodnes: and that which hee worketh in vs, he calleth ours. And therfore, af∣ter that the wise man hath rehearsed the good workes of the vertu∣ous woman, he wil haue her to be praised, not only priuately of her husband, and of her houshold, but also publikely. For hauing saide, Giue her of the fruite of her handes: that is to say, acknowledge her paines and labour, and blesse her: for this cause he addeth after∣wardes, or we must cause this confession to be made, when he saith, And let her owne workes praise her in the gates: that is to say, that the vertuous woman ought to bee praised and commended in the great congregations, because of her vertue that shineth in her life, and conuersation. Nowe if the vertuous woman be worthy of publike praise, by a stronger reason ought her children to acknow∣ledge the labour that she hath borne for them, and neuer to forget it: to bee wholy at her commandement, and to helpe her with all their power, according to the commandement of God, Honour thy father and thy mother, &c. Praysed bee God for euer and euer.
