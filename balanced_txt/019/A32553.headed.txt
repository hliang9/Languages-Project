A PROCLAMATION For the due observance of the Charter and Priviledges lately granted to the Governour and Company of Merchants trading to the Canaria-Islands. CHARLES R. WHereas the Merchants of this Our Kingdom trading to the Seven Islands formerly called the Fortunate Islands, and now known by the name of the Canary-Islands, and more particularly by the names of Grand Canaria, Theneriffe, Palma, Leanserot, Fuerte Ventura, Gomera, & Hierro, did heretofore carry on that Trade, to the great benefit and advantage of Our good Subjects, by Exporting great quantities of the Native Commodities, and other the Manufactures of this Our Kingdom, and in Exchange thereof Importing the Wines and other Goods there, received at such Rates that the same were usually Retailed at very easie and moderate Prices; But of late years it hath so fallen out, by reason of the irregular & disorderly Trading of Retailers and other persons no ways experi∣enced in that Trade and of their extraordinary and unseasonable resort unto the said Islands with an unusual number of Ships, That the Prices of those Wines have been exceedingly enhanced, and the Commodities and Manufactures of Our Kingdoms debased in their value, by the Inhabitants of the said Islands; and Our Subjects enforced to pay for a great part of those Wines with Pieces of Eight, to the decay of the Trade, and decrease of the Treasure of Our King∣doms. For prevention of which mischief, We were graciously pleased by Our Letters Patents, bearing date the Seven∣teenth day of March last past, to erect a Corporation, by the name of The Governour and Company of Merchants Trading to the Canary-Islands, consisting of several Merchants therein particularly named, and all other Our English Subjects who have lived in the said Islands as Merchants or Factours, and were in Trade thither at the time of the Grant of Our said Letters Patents; or have for Seven years last past traded thither, to the value of One thousand pounds a year,
or upwards, being meer Merchants, and no Retailers, nor of any other Profession, and such as at any time hereafter should be admitted as Members of the said Company, according to the tenour of Our said Letters Patents: which said Corporation We were graciously pleased likewise to endow with several necessary Priviledges and Immunities for the better enabling of them to carry on the Regulation of the said Trade, granting unto the said Company the whole, entire, and sole Trade to, at, and from the said Islands; and with general Prohibitions and Restraints of all others, not being Members of the said Corporation, to Trade or Traffick to, at, or from the said Islands for Canary Wines, or any other Goods whatsoever, or to Import from any other Port or place into any of Our Dominions any Wines, Goods, or Merchandises of the Growth, Production, or Manufacture of the said Islands, or any of them, contrary to the tenour of Our said Letters Patents. We therefore resolving to encourage and support the said Corporation, and not to suffer any violation or diminution of those Priviledges which We have granted unto them for the ends aforesaid, Do hereby publish Our Royal Will and Pleasure unto all persons, as well Subjects as Strangers, straitly charging and commanding them and every of them, That they presume not at any time hereafter to do, or attempt any thing against the Rights and Priviledges of the said Company, or in derogation of Our Charter and Letters Patents to them granted, as they will answer the contrary at their perils. And to the end that the Charter and Government of the said Fellowship may be the better put in execution, And to the intent that all Offenders against the same may be discovered and brought to Iustice, and such punishment inflicted upon them for such their offences, as by the said Char∣ter, and other the Orders and Constitutions of the said Company ought to be inflicted on such as wilfully and contemp∣tuously transgress against Our Charter and this Our Proclamation; In pursuance of the same, We do further by and with the Advice of Our Privy Council hereby Will and Command, as well the Iudges of Our High Courts of Admiralty, as the Marshal and under-Officers of the same, as also all and every Our Farmers or Commissioners of Our Customs for the time being, and the Searchers of Our Customs in all Ports of Our Dominions, and the several Officers of what kind soever belonging to, and attending the service of Our Customs; as also all Our Admirals, Vice-Admirals, Commanders, Captains, and Officers whatsoever of any of Our Royal Ships, or any of Our Castles, Blockhouses, and Forts respectively, and all other Our Officers and Ministers in their several places, to be aiding and assisting unto the said Governour and Company of Merchants trading into the Canary Islands, and all such as they shall employ, in all matters and things tending to the Supportation of the Government of the said Company, and Re∣gulation of their Trade, and for preservation of their Priviledges, Iurisdictions and Immunities by Our Royal Charter to them granted as aforesaid. Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Twenty fifth day of May 1665. in the Seventeenth year of Our Reign. God save the King.
