The Genius of True Enslish-men, Tacitus de vit. Jul. Agr.cap. 13. Biritanni delectum ac Tributa & Injuncta Imperij Munera impigrè obe∣unt, si Injuriae adsint, has aegrè tolerant; Jam domiti ut pareant nondum ut Serviant. The Britains are a sort of People that pay very freely all manner of Tributes and Taxes to the Empire Legally Imposed, but cannot endure Injuries; and had rather Perish than live as Slaves. THe Free-born English Generous and Wise, Hate Chains, but do not Government despise. Rights of the CROWN, Tributes and Taxes they, (When Lawfully demanded) freely pay: Force they abhor, and Wrongs they scorn to bear, More guided by their Judgement than their Fear, JUSTICE with them is never call'd Severe. Here Power by Tyranny was never got, LAWS may (perhaps) Enslave, but FORCE cannot. Rash Councels here have still the worst Effect, The furest way to Reign, is to Protect. KINGS are least safe in their Unbounded Will, Joyn'd with the wretched Power of doing ill; Forsaken most when they're most Absolute, LAWS guard the MAN, and only bind the Brute. To Force that Guard with the worst so to joyn, Can never be a Prudent KING'S Design, What KING would change to be a Caitiline? Break his own Laws, shake an unquestion'd Throne, Conspire with Vassals to Usurp his own. 'Tis rather some base Fav'rites Vile Pretence, To Tyrannize at the wrong'd KING'S Expence. Let France grow Proud beneath the Tyrants Lust, Whilst the Rackt People crawl and lick the Dust. The Mighty Genius of this Isle disdains Ambition, Slavery, and Golden Chains: ENGLAND to Servile Yokes did never bow, What Conqu'rors ne'r presum'd who dare do now? ROMAN nor NORMAN never could pretend To have Enslav'd, but made this Isle their Friend. London, Printed for Francis Smith at the Elephant & Castle in Cornhil.
