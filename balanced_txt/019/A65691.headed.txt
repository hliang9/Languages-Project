THE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE Republished and enlarged by the Author TO: WHITAKER M: D: Phisitian in Ordinarie to his Maje∣sties House-hould (Printed) For SAMVEL BROVN. MDCLIIII.
Gentle Reader. I Am not ignorant, that there be∣longeth to Kings from their ser∣vants both Tribute of duty, and pre∣sents of affection, elce it wil appeare a tacit denial of any grace or boun∣ty received from them; as for the for∣mer of these (I hope) I shal not live to be wanting in my most humble duty, and the good pleasure of his Majesties imployments; and for the latter (I conceave) the choice of this subject might be an oblation much referring to the excellency of his in∣dividual person. And were the forme as Courtlie as the matter, I could have had the confidence, to crave the Patronage of the Highest borne Prince of the Christian world, and a Person (without flattery) in whom
all greatest Crownes concentrate, though at present as highly beyond all Law of nature, or national exam∣ple, injured & traterously treated: which offereth the cause of this may republication, with a further enlarge∣ment of my former act, in the yeare 1638. as being sensible of a vulgar misunderstanding of my intention in the tractation of this subect, which was then, and is now, but an addition to our medicinal faculty, & more ex∣actly to declare, how, and after what manner the juce of the Grape may be conducible to humane bodyes, both for Aliment and Medicament: which if those Lords and Commons that would suffer noe persons of honour and loyalty to make with themselves the representative body of the whole Kingdome, if those (I say) had accep∣ted, it in my owne sense, could not in
such a Noaical stupefaction, have slept out their Eyes of reason and sense of honour, as to suffer their na∣kednes to be detected by the most common Robbers of the English Nation, and themselves imprisoned for the same theft. If they shal excuse themselves, and that such ebriety was not the cause, they can not ap∣peare any other then the Tred of Dunghill-Cocks, for no spirit of the Game or reasonable, could suffer or conceive, that the stoping up the fountaine of honour, could render the rivolets any other then stincking Ditches: if otherwise such stupidity were conveyed in their base Princi∣ples of nature, 'tis then a Gengrena in the masse of blood, and by noe ot∣her scope to be cured, but by extir∣pation and replanting more noble and lively Rootes in their roome; If
any person shal adjudge this sharpe Councel to be more medicall, then prudential, which terme in this age is the perfect Character of a cheating and treacherous villayne or knave, which formerly obteyned a better signification, let them know the con∣sultor is more Medical then Pruden∣tial & well knowing his faculty to be sufficiently comprehensive of all arts and sciences and Politicks, if either Aristotel or Machivel are esteemed Pollititians, and so such as have been endowed with such perfection of in∣tellect amongst the Professors of this faculty, the Almighty hath Crowned with a special title of honour as hath in many ages appeared by the stud∣dys and practise of great Kings, and hath ben the fountaine of the whole famely de Medicis, soe great at this day: nor are there any (except the sou∣les
of Cornelius Agrippa) soe vaine, as to render an undervallue of the faculty, or besmeere the Purple and Scarlet Robes of the Phisitian Cum stircore & Vrinâ; were my selfe over zealous, by its subject matter I could demonstrate it for Antiquity to pre∣cede the Forme, in that matter, which was by the Almighty after informed, and as soone as the sex was distingui∣shed it was Corpus humanum, vivens & sanabile, and instantly the subject of that part of Phisick which we call Diaetetical, as appeareth by their ne∣cessity in eating of all manner of Ali∣ment in Paradise by the order of the Creator (except the Tree of Life) and not only for antiquity, but also for its dignity of frame, about which the Almighty summoned a Councel, and left most justly from its owne excel∣lency, to challenge precedence of all
other subjects of sciences and arts (except Theologie) which is subjected principally in the forme: it is also af∣firmed by the Orator in the 2 de na∣tura Deorum, that al Creatures are dedicated to its service: and Iosephus wil create it Lord of al Terrestrialitie and the cause of al such production according to Plinie: As for any larger Encomiastick I shal referr the Rea∣der to Lactantius, and leave Corne∣lius with his vanitles, to the pruden∣tials of these times, which would have all knowledge & virtue to con∣sist in selfe confidence & such poore Romantique learning as would en∣force the antient worthyes both of art and courage to render a scornful blush to be seene amongst such but∣terflies, and to see such unnatural and preposterous motion from perfecti∣on, to imperfection, from rationali∣ty,
to meer animality or contradi∣ctoriously; much resembling the Dutchy of Spoleto in the territory of Narina (which according to Pliny) is exceeding dirty in a drought, and as dusty in wett weather, of such sort of strang earth, were these Don Quixo∣tes composed; and having nothing to encourage their errant Knight∣hood but a poore leane Rozinante, or som glistering quoine of their fore∣fathers monuments which wil not passe currant with any (but weake Capacities) for others that observe their digression from their Fathers virtues, cannot but conceave them better to have been pist out against a Wind-Mill, then otherwise produced to the shame of their Genitors. If I shall seeme to much censorious, I shal earnestly desire a just cause of retraction, which wold be a Royal
Cordial to all Princes and sweet Na∣tures, which are perpetually molested with such confident and insolent ver∣min, which wil stop the breach of any person that shal smel of honny (ex∣cept they close their Lipps & Eares) against their entrance; If I have of∣fended in my description of thos persons, it wil be as difficult for me to recant, as for them to repent of their Rebellion, which is correspondent to witchcraft, of which sinne repented, I could never meete with an example except (Manasses) therefore doe con∣clude their prudence to stand upon no other bottome, then the Diaboli∣cal attempt of greater Crimes; for al∣though they know and have seene the cclipscd beauty of heaven breake through such darknes, to the enli∣vening of all creatures againe, yet wil be, and are stil better enterteyned
with such Aegyptian darknes, though measured by a short time, as most conducible to their black designes, conceaving this bonum presens to be preferred bfore all notions of other Beatitude, or productioon of right rea∣son and noblenesse of soule, which demention, the heathen Poets have rendred a most certaine symptome of irrecoverable destruction, to which I leave them, and til then ex∣pect it; what I have writt concerning the subsequent subject is for the ac∣quaintance of more reasonable crea∣tures, as neerest to the nature of the Gods, according to Poetical expres∣sions delighted and refres hed with this Nectar. and if in this discourse I cannot mount the capacity of hig∣her and more Gygantick reason, I shal entreate their assistance, for the better information of my selfe and
the advantage of others, who cannot be better instructed at present by their humble and faithful Servant. To: Whitaker.
THE BLOOD Of the GRAPE ALthough my inten∣tion is principally to explicate the juce of the Grape, yet I can∣not but cast a Philo∣sophycal glance upon Plants them selves as they are integraly, or in their parts helpeful or hurtful, preserving the harmonie of hu∣mane nature by their homogeniali∣ty, or forcing a discord by their he∣terogeniality, such therefore as in their integrality support nature in its perpepual flux and reflux a∣mongst Plants, are called in this tongue Pothearbs as Lettice, Cab∣bidge, VVatercresses and such like, such as are the parts of Plants are Rootes as Parsnips, Radish, Car∣rootes and Turnips, there are also
some Plants which are specifi∣cally and by their universal tem∣per appropriated to particular parts of humane bodys, as Poeo∣nia, Betonica, Salvia, Verbasculum, for the head; Crocus and Melissa, for the heart; Menta for the ven∣tricule; Eupatorium for the Liver; Capperes, for the spleene; and Hir∣modactilus for the joints: There are other Plants also as pernitious to the whole body, or such parti∣cular parts, as Hyosiamus for the head; Mezereon for the liver; Eruum for the rheins and bladder; Aloes, for the Hamorhoids. There are also a third sort of Plants which are doubtful, and they are more or lesse helpful to nature, as Colo∣cynthis, Scamonium, Senna and these are adjuvants by reason of their Cathartique quality in seperating and educing corrupt humours from the incorrupt: There are
also Plants more lignous, firme and indissoluble, as Oake, Appel and Peare-trees, and of this sort some lesse firme, as the Vine, which to desect into its parts Containing and Contained, similar and dissi∣milar, were a frustrate labour, be∣cause every botomique hath pub∣lished it more cleare and elegan∣ly then can be expected from my selfe. I shal render my Concep∣tions only of that similar part of the Vine, which we cal liquid, and by Philosophers understood Iu∣ces, or Teares extracted from the Plant: This juce is the liquid part diffused in the substances of the Plants themselves, which as their Blood conserveth life in them, which bringeth me to my elect Subject, the Blood of the Grape, and as it appeareth to be blood, in it is life, 't is from the Vine, and that the Plant of life; and if the
difference between this Plant and the Tree of life in Paradise were but magis and minus 't is not so im∣probable as to be rejected by any, for they wilbe both grāted Plants of life, and they very much re∣spond in their Nature as wel as Appellation: What the fruit was that sprang from that in Paridice, is not as yet knowne, or not so perfectly understood, as that of the Vine, the Nature of which is so lively as that Galen wil affirme it to augment radical heate,Galen: de Causs: Morb: Cap: 4. which is the way to live for ever. Asclepia∣des the Phisician telleth me, that this Blood doth consent more with the nature of the Gods then any other, and that their Nature is incorrupt is without dispute: secondly he adviseth the use of it to unsound and infirme Consti∣tutions, to reduce them to a firme and incorrupt temper, and accor∣ding
to the sense of Galen to aeter∣nity in this world; which cannot by any be understood of lesse then an extreame extention of life, where it is properly or according to exact indication adhibited. hownecessary then is the Study & perpension of this subject, as a dif∣ficulty to explicate; necessary, be∣cause our lives are short, and dif∣ficult, because Art is long and Ex∣perience dangerous; Yet if by this Act I shal be an instrument to ex∣tend life, and abreviate Art, not only shew the Plant, but teach the use, it may prove worth my la∣bour and acceptation of my in∣thrauled Country, whose assurance shalbe that my best reason and Philosophie shal be the guide of my pen: neither Hippocrates, nor Galen, or any other authority far∣ther then I have digested them, and made them my owne reason
and to agree with truth. As for the abreviation of Art, preserva∣tion of Life, and restoring the in∣firme, we shal comprehend in a smal Circle, and render in a few words, the summe of al Classick writers to this purpose, as the foureteene bookes of Galen his Method of curing and six of Health preserving in these few words exprest (viz.) Diet & Me∣dicine. And by these two wayes prin∣cipally are life and Health exten∣ded and restored. Quantity, qua∣lity and the Mode of application in them observed. Quantity as it is usque ad vasa & ad vires secundum justitiam rather then the ful capa∣city of the recipient, because such quantity of aliment must be pre∣duced into act by the power of Nature, which quantity to the di∣siention of the vessels would pre∣ve
burthen some, if not totally de∣structive. Quality as it corre∣sponds with humane bodys uni∣versally, or with this, or that in∣dividual, the wel ordering of both requireth a just Consideration of the recipient subject, as it may be exactly tempered, or valetudina∣rie; This terme Quantity of reth me a discourse with Lessius which seemeth to prefer a quantity ad pondus of Diet, as most conducing to the preservation of health, and extention of Life, as if satiation were the usher of diseases and mortality, as a corruptive Cause, which I cannot conceive resona∣ble, nor can he render any Ar∣gument à testimonio but from his owne observation; which argu∣ment à partiulari my Logique can not approve, nor wil it concurre with the Reason of others more reasonable, to adhibite a strict
weight of aliment upon no occa∣sion or difference of temper or di∣stemper to be exceded or lessened, nor can it be granted by any (ex∣cept Religious) who wilfully and unreasonably Chastise their Bo∣dies to merrit some thing beyond al intellect or reasonable expressi∣on, for in a phisical sense noe ar∣tist can embrace it otherwise then Heretical, if he wil ground his opinion upon the rule of Hip∣pocrates and Gallen, scil: Contraria contrarijs curantur, that Diseases are recovered by their contraries as inanition by fasting must be reco∣vered by repletion in feeding; and this inanition may be extream or not. & in such condition no sever pondus or weight can be observed for although inanition must be replenished, yet it must be effe∣cted by repetition often of Con∣coctible aliment, in more or lesse
quantity according to the conve∣nient power of the parts reci∣pient, as for the quality of the ali∣ment according to the rule of ijs nutrimur quibus constamus must be Homogeneal for the support of uni∣versal nature as wel as the recove∣ry of each morbid individual and in this poynt the auntients have been observed exceeding strict and as they had great reason soe is the judgment of any Phisi∣tian most seene and censured by his election of aliment in quality agreable to the temper of body, for although an effect must be cu∣red by its contrary, yet the right temper must be supported by its owne simile, as heate by heate and moysture by moysture, but whither in degree more or lesse moyst or intense, is indicated by the natural constitution of that body and to be ordered by the
Phisitian, but this is a Paradox ot not understood by vulgar practi∣cers who argue falsely upon this true ground of Hyppocrates, so such as accept his Contraria contrarijs cu∣rantur to be a rule without excep∣tion in nourishing as much as cu∣ring, as if there were noe differen∣ce betweene contrary, and contra∣ry, Rebellion and Loyalty, 't is truth as remedies they must be contrary to the affect and thus Arist: will have a crooked Plant bent as much the other way to straiten it, but if a straite Plant shalbe incurvated there wil be consequently an organical affect, which wee call vitiata figura, so al∣so if contrarie remedies or quale∣ties shalbe applyed to an harmo∣nius temper, it wil be a cause effi∣cient of discord & conflict in natu¦re or in the fore said temper, ther∣fore it is apparent, that the quali∣ty
is more to be observed either in meate or Medicine then the quantity (especially of aliment) because natural choice of foode is in noe Creature of health ultra ca∣pacitatem recipientis, but if any Lessian shall dispute as strictly for temperance according to his mea∣sure, I must severally as a Phisitian tel them the Worthies of our Art preferreth excess before such tem∣perance, for they affirme Canoni∣cally that al affects or diseases of plentitude or fulnesse are more safe because more curable then disea∣ses of Emptinesse, and who doth not apprehend variety of reason in this axiome, first because univer∣sal evacuation is sooner effected then repletion; Secondly, because accidents of various formes can∣not be avoyded for they are infi∣nite, and the least affliction upon an extenuate and lessiate body, for
defect of excrementitious hu∣mours to involue them, giveth a dangerous charge to the radical principles, because both the disea∣se and medicine having nothing else to encounter must tyrannise over enfeebled nature as by its owne impotency not able to resist which Conatus naturae or endea∣vor to expel noctious causes doth over heate the spirits and effect such preternatural heate by its motion from the Center to the Circumference as doth inflame natural heate according to Chri∣stophorus a vega and not other∣wise by the ascent of putrid fuli∣ginous vapours to the Heart ac∣cording to vulgar opinion; Con∣trarily, where there is a sufficiencie of excrementitious humours to entertaine both the Disease and Remedy, there are they retained with lesse oppression and danger
to the radical spirits, and removed with lesse offence to the universal temper of the person so labouring as wil be more Phylosophically demonstrated according to this subsequent mode. Albertus, and many other Philosophers doe constitute in mixt Bodys a two fold Moysture: one which they nominate humidum continuans and from this continuating hu∣midity the Iunction of parts doth proceed, otherwise they would be al siccity, and consequently upon any motion disunited; therefore there is no natural Body void of this Humidity, though never so hard or grave, as is dayly demon∣strated by every Chymical Operator, every hower extracting oyle out of the hardest body; Therefore this Humidity is by Physitians nominated Oleaginosum humidum an oyley moisture, consisting of
ayrie and aqueous moysture. The other humidity being hu∣midum quasi nutriens is a waterish moisture in the mixt body, no∣thing advantagious to the conti∣nuation of parts, & because of its tenuity is easily resolved which cannot with such facility be effe∣cted upon the Oleaginous, because of its crassitude or thicknesse, soe that were a proportion of excre∣mentitious humours is wanting in a body by reason of a severe or thin Diet, in that body both di∣sease, and medicine must of neces∣sity be more tyrannicall over the fixed moysture, which is the liga∣ment of life; and for this cause all Phisitians will acknowledge Di∣seases of fulnesse admitt of a more safe and speedy cure then those of inanition, as diseases alsoe of a cold quality admit of a more safe remedy then hot distempers, be∣cause
in the application of hot re∣medies to the former we foment natural heat, and our cold appli∣cations to the other, we doe not only debilitate, but very often ex∣tinguish naturall heàt. But be∣cause I intend noe Controversy, I shal fix my selfe upon my pro∣per subject, and shew how every temper may be preserved void of all distempers, proceeding from the material principles of nature by the use of Wine, and also prove it to be an excellent and speci∣fical remedy, in all affects produ∣ced by the discord of the foresaid Principles, being peritely applyed according to proper indication, nor shal I be prolix in my tracta∣tion of all the parts of this dis∣course. Curiosity and expecta∣tion will proove abhortive, if a taste of this promised Iuyce be not suddainely presented, whose
nature and excellency hath and doth appeare in our former ex∣pressions, to be Encomiastick suffi∣cient, and such excellent Nectar in the opinion of Noah, that he made it is first Act of Husbandry after the Deluge to Plant a vinyard, before any other fruite or grayne, as is affirmed by sacred Testimo∣ny: The reason of that act, if I should presume to render or ex∣plicate that Text, without better quallification, I might not with∣out cause, from Theologists, have thrown upon me that snuff of Ne sutor ultra crepidam; yet can I not soe much inthrall my fancy, or suffocate such notions as may be probable though not an absolute and perfect Demonstration, as to passe by his first act after his Re∣surrection, or not to take notice of his age, which I find extended twenty yeares beyond the age of
Adam, in whom the Principles of nature according to my reason & sense should have been most pure and durable: Nor can I argue o∣therwise, but that matter soe for∣med must be subject to dayly de∣caye by perpetuall motion, there fore how Noah after soe many Centuries from Adam should in age extend twenty yeares longer can make noe impression in my reason: (the taste of this Nectar excepted) which is (I conceive) an inferior speties of that Plant of Life from which Adam was exclu∣ded, for had it been of equall or the same perfection, whereas he lived after his Plantation Three Hundred and fifty yeares (which was a good Cordiall) yet he had now been living and eternall in this world, but as a best second was proved by his own experien∣ce, and by six hundred yeares ob∣servation,
he could not but be suf∣ficiently taught how to frame reasonable arguments to satisfy both himselfe and others; and by reducing it into its principles, make a sensible discoverie of natu∣res mistery and upon such like experimental observation did he plant his Vinyard: so that by infe∣rence the excellency of this sub∣jectt doth appeare more transcen∣dent then any other Iuyce either of vegitall or Animal: Therefore it shalbe my next consideration, to explicate the nature of it, with its difference and use, both in re∣spect of aliment and Medicament and with its application to every individual, of every age, and tem∣per; therefore that we may act as much as we speake, let us looke upon the quality of Wine Philoso∣phically; and at the first view we shall discover a two fold heat in
it, as it issueth from a living body (Viz.) an animall and elemen∣tary heat, for though Wine can∣not be said to be animatum, such as giveth a soul or life; yet it may carry with it, and to its selfe the Impression of a centrall or im∣planted heat from a soule as may playnely be demonstrated in o∣ther things; as the seed of Ani∣mals or of plants, have not a soule in act according to the Doctrine of Aristotel; Yet it doth take from a soule such a generative power like unto the soule, which (Aristo∣tel saith) is nothing else, but a vital heat distinct from igneous and elementary; soe as in the ge∣neration of a living Creature the first moving is Animal, or the Plant from which the seed is∣sueth, but the seed is the instru∣ment which by a power of vitalli∣ty receaved from the Plant beget∣teth
another beeing like it selfe; since therefore there is in semine, a vitall heat distinct from elemen∣tary, why may we not affirme the same of Wine, which in like man∣ner issueth from an animate body; then wil Wine appeare to have a double heat, or one conflate or moved out of two, and that which is great and intense doth not con∣sist of an indivisible, because it is greater or lesse according to the variety of species, and diversity of situation or places; for in those Regions where the sun effects a stronger heat, there grow hotter Wines, & this heat is not external, but rather naturall and implanted in the Wine because from the heat of the place, the vital and elemen∣tary heat, which constituteth the natural heat of the Wine, doth be∣come more great and intense; nor can it be denyed, in Wine to be a
double moysture according to Gallen; who distinguisheth the sub∣stance Vinosa, from the substance Aquosa, the qualitas vinosa, being that humidity inherent which doth unite the parts, & the wate∣rish substance, is only that which is contracted from aliment: for soe long as the Grape was conjoy∣ned to the Vine, there did flow there unto a waterish humour by which it was nourished, and after 'tis separated from the Vine, doth stil retaine that waterish humour, which as then was not converted, nor assimulated into the substance of Wine; nor can it have any fur∣ther conversion, because the wine is now noe more animatum, or able to produce it into Act; and this is that humidity in Wine which is spent or wasted in boyling, the o∣ther remayneth which is innate & fixed to the substance of Wine,
and hence it is that the boyling of Wine doth render it more sweete; for by the expence of this humi∣dity the juyce returneth to its owne naturall moisture; And this (I hope) wilbe satisfaction con∣cerning the Generall nature of Wine: which familiarity with hu∣mayne nature wil appeare; the na∣ture of all Wines being either corro∣berative & nutritive or mundificative, or apperative, and these are not only testifyed by the antient and learned Phisitians; but proved out of their own existence & prime animation; which wilbe here∣after demonstrated, in our pro∣gresse; therefore we cannot but take notice of the distinction of Wines by their names and colours. Concerning their difference in names, they are sovarious, as to render them in all their appella∣tions, will rellish more of curiosi∣ty,
then utility: many of them being fantastically imposed by the wanton singularity in Mer∣chants of al Nations; but soe many as Philosophers, Phisitians and Poets have notefied, I shall briefly de∣clare and then passe to their Co∣lours. In the first place let us take notice of the General name vinum and soe denominated à vi, & vin∣cendo, from the power and strength of it, according to Varro; and I ren∣der it vinum quasi divinum, and soe the pleasant Nectar of the Gods; the antients had many sorts different in name, as Fortinum, newly ex∣prest from the Grape, Protopum, such as fell from the Vyne before the Grapes were trodden; Others which take their names from the Region in which they grow; As Chium, Lesbium, Falernum, Cacubum, Surrentinum, Caelenum, Signinum, Tarraconense, Spoletinum, Ceretanum,
Fundanum, Malvaticum; Amongst the French many others, as Vinum Remense, burdegalense, Aurelianense Belonense, Divionense, Montispedo∣nense; And these agree better, (as Table Drinkes) with sound bo∣dys, then infirme constitutions, there are more debile and dilute wines in France which agree better with febrile dispositions, then with cold Phlegmatick tempers; As Pa∣risiense, Limonicense, Forense, Alobro∣gense, with many others, and since both their names are knowne, and their natures in parte, and such tempers to which they are most concenient, let us take a taste, and principally peirce these foure ves∣sels, (Viz.) Sweet, accute, Austere, and Milde, observing their colours (Viz.) White, Sanguineus, Yellow and Black; the first three common∣ly knowne to us by their names of White, Claret and Sack; and these admitt of their differences; for as
there are several sorts of Sack and claret, soe are there alsoe of White Wines, some Sweet, some Austere, some thick, others limped and cleere, and all these pure nutritives; but inferior in degree of nourishing to such as are sweet; And although Dulcia Maxime nutriunt must be with this caution, that the Liver, Spleene and Reynes be void of ob∣struction, which because they ge∣nerally obteyn a body more crasse, they are said to obstruct; Thusha∣ving breifly & Philosophically de∣sected their bodyes and preferred their nature & specifical differen∣ce to publique view, I shal present them to a medicall consideration. The quallityes generally re∣ceived by all Phisitians, are neutri∣tive and they doe nourish super omnia alimenta, if Gallen: may have credit: because Wine is semi sanguis, or halfe blood, before it be recei∣ved
and produced into act with a lesse fire of nature, and leaves be∣hind it no excrement, as all other vegitalls and animalls doe; it doth also evacuate both sursum & deor∣sum upward and downeward; it doth corrobarate all faculties, at∣tractive, retentive, concoctive and di∣stributive; it doth correct putrefa∣ction; open obstructions; & exhi∣lerat the spirits; what more is now requisite or needfull for preserva∣tion or restoration of health and life, then this so familiar to the principles of humayne bodyes, and so undoubtedly knowne, in most Regions, and incomparable with any other vegitall, or minerall (especially) mineralls, whose natur is destructive and Heterogeneall to all animalls? who according to Philosophicall observation non patitur afflictionem which cannot be avoyded in them, because their
preparation consisteth of a just re∣giment of fire; which was so hard to be gained by Iohannis Crato, that for that uncertainty insteed of his Chimicall Tutor he chose a Gallenest; And my selfe have observed very exact Chimists, whose medicines of the same kind, and prepared with as much dilligence as possi∣ble; sometimes so gentle, as chil∣dren would not complaine; and a∣gaine soe violent, as the strongest nature could not susteyne; which much confirmed my opinion with Crato of the difficulties to ef∣fect that just Regiment of fier; and if we be curious in our scrutation we shal finde also much, if not ir∣reconcileable difference in other drugs Galenicall, both in figure and operation: especially such as are transported from other Regions, which I dare affirm are not known to us according to their natural
perfection, and though the use of them be doubtfull, yet frequent, and if we doe know them, either we cannot have them, or such is their change and alteration in transportation as doth force us to blame the antients for their high applause of them, we not finding in the applicaton of them accor∣ding to proper scope, and indica∣tion any such excellency; and if any will credit Christophorus Barri (the Iesuite) in his Relation of Cohinchina to his Holy Father the Pope, to whom he doth protest that the Rhubarbe he brought from thence with many other Drugs, were so altered in their transpor∣tation, as without a special script upon them, he could not have knowne them to be the same ei∣ther in virtue, or colour; and that learned and expert moderne (Sym∣phorianus) doth challeng most of
our Pharmacall Compositions upon the same ground and doth affirme the chiefe ingredients to be un∣knowne or found in the shops of Europian Apothecaries, for better sa∣tisfaction accept his owne words, sed quod res quasdam vel non afferis, vel non sine maculâ, vel in totum ignorari puto: ea sunt Balsamum, Cardamomum, Myrrha, Nardus Indica, Caffia, scordium, Cinnamomum, Radix Pentaphilli, Ca∣lamus Ordoratus, Xylobalsomum. This Challenge I suppo2e will be diffi∣cult to answer by the perpenders: what shall we then say to the great incertainty of the most grand Compositions in our Phar∣macopea? but that with them we do pugnare contra hostem clausis ocu∣lis. I could raise many Disputes upon other things much in use a∣mongst us, and their incertainety of their virtues; besides the non∣satisfaction of their entity accor∣ding
to vulgar opinion, and such different descriptions, as have ben divulged; as Vnicornes-horne, Be∣zoardstone, and such like: but my intention is rather to be taught, then controvert, or else to inform others; for which cause I have undertaken the tractation of this subject: the Plant and Iuyce there of being so wel knowne to al Na∣tions, and sensible without con∣troversie to all reasonable Crea∣tures, and used in all places with respect to their speciall difference, from the wombe, which nouri∣sheth and produceth them; and if I shal not more clearely manifest the foresaid Qualities to be in it, and by the Consultations of more learned, then my selfe, then shal I in no manner give so full satisfa∣ction to the expectator; There∣fore that which was last in my in∣tention, shalbe first in execution;
and though I render not an Index of Authors, yet my subsequent Arguments shal be from testimo∣ny; not doubting to cleare our opinion to the full extension of such argumentation, and after this Dialecticall forme to cleere the Point. The first then is, that Wyne nou∣risheth above all other aliment; They who have had acquaintance with Galen: know they are his words translated; and that some nourish more or lesse, according to their special quality, as Vina a∣quea per exiguum alimentum corpori praebent, quae verò crassa sunt et colore rubra, plus alimenti habent quam reli∣qua vina. Galen. Secondly, that it doth corroborate: Vinum confortat spiritum, & in spiritum convertitur, & fortificat virtutem; Avicen: Thirdly that it doth evacuate; Vina crassa dulciaque quod alvum deijciant nemi∣ni
ferà ignotum est; sicut multum quod tametsi aegrè concoquatur crassumque succum & inflationes faciat, alvum ta∣men movet: Galen. Fourthly, that it doth open obstruction: Vinum dul∣ce vehementer apperit oppilationes pul∣monis. Avicen: Lastly, that it doth exhilerate the spirits, is proved by sacred testimony, Scil: Vinum cor hominis exhilerat. Thus have I Briefly rendred a confirmation of the a foresaid qualities medically in Wine; and Iustified them by an∣tient and orthodox authoritie; Notwithstanding for further sa∣tisafaction, let us cast our eye up∣pon the qualitie of Wines as they are obviously di2coursed in grosse by most or all the prime Aun∣tients, Scil: White Wine may be ad∣hibited in all acute and hot distem∣pers ut voluit Hippocrates; sweet Wine in cold diseases; because it heateth the body more, sed calefa∣ctione
temperatâ Galen: no white Wine is sweet, and such as is pure and subtile moveth urine stren∣uously, without any impression in the head, because it doth not ma∣nifestly heat, but sensibly refrige∣rate and is ordained in febre conti∣nuâ, Galen; Wyne in Generall mo∣derately used doth purge choler by urine, exhilarate the minde, and refres heth the senses; Wyne also that is dilute may safely and profi∣tably be adhibited in an Apoze∣micall forme in fevers; as will ap∣peare in our subsequent tractation of particular, and most grand dis∣tempers; White Wine doth sensibly refrigerate and cleanse the Lungs, & one Drought doth Extinguish thirst more then one gallon of barly water; as my owne experi∣ence for many yeares, and in many hundred persons can affirme; sweet wines also may be adhibited in a∣cute
passions as pleurisies and infla∣mation of the lungs, to provoke expectoration, when the matter is di2gested according to Oribatius, Haliabbas, Constantius Monachus, Wyne also that is white, subtile, and thinne, is not turbulent to the ven∣tricle, but of easie digestion, soone penetrates the veines, provoketh urine, and leaveth no excrement, as doth all other vegitals or Ani∣mals and minorals; And as before said that it doth in all hot distem∣pers Extinguish thirst, is the ob∣servation alsoe of Isaac the Sonne of Solomon an Arabian King; Last∣ly white Wine is said to be insipide dilut, coagulate by its frigiditie in se; Yet under favour in respect of its universal parts, there can be no such Coagulation, as is affirmed by Iohannes Portugalensis once Pope of Rome; These are the universall o∣pinions of the Ancients; yet the
reason of the reader may exact a more demonstrative proofe of such contraritie in the same body of so pure a nature, as to open and close, to corroborate and debili∣tate, and that these contrarie acts should appeare at the same time, in the same subject to whome it is Applyed, as that Wine, as you have heard, should generally Evacuate Excremētitious humors of the body or particularly purge bilious Mat∣ter by Urine and yet the same spe∣cifical Wine shall corroborate the whole and everie part it worketh upon at the same time; for al∣though everie perfect body be mixed of the principles of rarety, density and graetie, yet if their shal be the addition of one other digestion they will seperate in themselves, and levitie wil not ap∣peare as levitie and gravetie in the same spheare; as wine doth af∣ter
the addition of several dige∣stions, more then is received from the plant in its mixture; and though there are occult qualities of which no other profe can be made, then such an illogicall argu∣ment as is Framed à particulari; or that it doth worke soe; yet when I contemplate the supernatural per∣fection of mixture in this plant, Exceedinge and comprehending all other Vegitals and Minerals as doth appeare by its puretie in na∣ture, which as gold will nor doth receive any, but a seeming corrup∣tion; but Exceeding gold in its familiaritie which humane com∣plection, and the Complement or Epitome of all other plants; as Man is in his forme, and mixture the short representative of the great world; And as we are sensi∣ble, and knowing these qualeties to be in Wine soe wil they appeare
with as litle contradictiō as those of inferiour Plants, Scil: Guiacum, which doth by constringing eva∣cuate, as is more manifest in the squeeszing of a spung: or Rhubarb, which doth constring by purge∣ing, others will have a catholi∣que and incorruptible spirit in wine exceeding all such mixtures; & that it moveth as a free Agent in its sphear of activitie; and for sthis reason hath Phylosophers & Poets suppo2ed it to participate wth the nature of the Gods, which must move as liberall agents; It may also in more plane phyloso∣phie appeare to move after such manner by virtue of its fluent & fixt heat, the one oleaginous continuating, binding and vni∣ting the parts together, the other fluent attenuating the humors, and loosening the belly or body universally, and thus probably to
effect such contrary actions out of its natural mixture, since there∣fore it can and doth operate in such manner, there is much rea∣son it should be thus used, no o∣ther vegital or mineral so pleasant or perfectly concocted, (except gold) nor any so familiar to hu∣mane Nature all other fruits, and juces beeing more subject to pu∣trefaction or such like alteration, and more onerous to nature in concoction, and by reason of their lesse perfect concoction, most of them breeding litle blood, or vitious blood or none at all; but wine, especially red wine, is halfe blood before it be received; and when I find the Antients, nomi∣nate it, the old mans milk, they must grant it a super — concoction to blood, as it is cited in jecore; for milke is blood dealbated, & such as have received a more perfect
concoction, then it hath in the li∣ver; And for its encomiasticke, it is the Medicine that seteth a true edge upon nature, supporteth an appetite in being, and recovereth it languishing; And where as me∣dicamentum is defined, to bee a me∣dium betweene poyson & aliment, and by consequence must leave af∣ter operation some venemous contact; this Medicine is so diffe∣rent in operation, as that it lea∣veth a lively contact, and because of its universall homogenialitie with nature, cannot be compre∣hended under the diffinition of medicamentum, though so nomina∣ted, because a true diffinition doth explicate the nature and Essence of the thing defined, yet that it is a medicine, and under such notion apprehended the practise of Avi∣cenna, Rhasis, and Averroes justify, when themselv's used twice every
month to move their body's with the same either sursum vel deorsum, or both; And if my owne obser∣vation may be acceptable then I cannot conceale such powerfull Effects as my selfe hath felt, and seen in others; Scil: consumptive and extenuate bodyes restored to a sarcocity, and from withered Bodys to fresh, plumpe, fat and fleshie; and from old and infirme to young, and strong; when as wa∣ter or small beare Drinkers were countenanced more like Apes then Men; and if I had no other reason but my own experience it were Enough to ingage my faith, con∣cerning its excellencie. My eye now is converted upon the vul∣gar, and find their pulse in a dis∣ordred Motion, their hearts being preternaturally dilated with the reporte of preservation from death, sicknesse, and payne, be∣cause
Natural death and extreem old age suffereth dissolution with out any payne, and all these to be effected with a medicine so fami∣liar, as no longer they can for∣bear the proverb, that he that is not now a physition must be dubed for a foole; But let such apprehensions be carefull of the right applica∣tion of this Medicament, least the title be inverted upon themsel∣ves, for the difference of tempers, distempers, times & clymes, with circūstance of sex, wil exercise the best Hippocratist or Phylosopher rightly to order and aply this re∣medie; for causes externall of Me∣lancholie are more frequent in Aethiopia, then any other region, the aire being cold and dry, and the time principaly in which this humer doth Moue is the Autume. Though Hippocrates will have the spring to have precedence, yet I
understand the affect the be gene∣rated in either, but propagated through the whole body in the winter; so that these circumstan∣ces neglected and the remedie contrarie to proper indication or ignorantly advised, the princi∣ples of nature must suffer abbre∣viation in stead of Extension; Em∣pericks stand here like the fiction of Tantalus, the fruit is not only in conspectu, but with in the space of their grasp, yet deprived of con∣tact, they may see this subject transcending their logick from a particular to a universal; Nor can they argue from experience who know not what they doe, in every one of these following respects, which are beyond the capacity of an Emperick, quatenus Emperick; Yet before I proceed in the fore said respects, give me leave to sa∣lute Plato, who hath tackt me with
aprohibition concerning Kings, Magistrates, soldiers, woemen and servants, to whom he absolu∣tely prohibiteth the use of wine in any Region, or at any time, as if hee would appropriate this felici∣tie only to the Commonweale of schollers; but upon farther per∣pension wee cannot but returne a candid interpretation; for doubt∣lesse hee intended principally so∣brietie, not forbidding the mode∣rate use of wine to any such person before named, otherwise he must deprive them of the refreshment of spirit, and the generation of in∣corrupt humors; which hath prin∣cipal relation to all the faculties, both naturall, vital, and animal; & if notice be taken of the Exces∣sive operation of this juce, kings wilbe verrie sensible of its adju∣vancie in their election of officers and servants of all conditions, be∣cause
it openeth the closest locks, and discovers the most good or evil intentions; all excesse wor∣king upon the subject according to its disposition or predominan∣ce of humor; And no Tyron will deny the behaviour of men to a∣gree with their various Comple∣xions, nor that the same specisick, wine doth irradiate it selfe with as much varietie, as are their indivi∣dual persons; as a candle set up in a lanthern composed of various Coloured glasse scil: white, red greene, blew, black, yellow, or any other mixt Coulor, the Irradia∣tion through every one of these of the foresaid lamp, wil corre∣spond or answer the complection of each particular glasse; And the Dutch make it a rule of politicks, by which they steere their course of al contracts by it, and will not conclude any bargaine before
they see the spirit of wine operate, for feare of some concealed snake under the hearbes; And doubt∣lesse the moderat use of wine, for the animation of the soldiers, the inlivening of the Magistrate, and recoverie of women, is profitable, Especially in hystericall sits; accor∣ding to Hippocrates.Hipp: I denatura Mulie∣rum And my transi∣sion now shall be to the tempers of humane bodyes in generall, & the wynes generally agreeing with those tempers; and then more particularly to this or that individual. Temper it selfe beeing the reason of mixture, or the har∣mony and consent of the prime qualities in Elements, and by the Exuberancie of each simple qua∣lity, these foure symple tempers are created; as hot, when the heat predominateth over the cold, and yet of siccity and moisture remai∣neth an equallity; and so of the
rest, as cold, dry and moist, besides these foure conjugate tempers, which proceed from the exube∣rancy of the two first qualities, as hot and moist, hot and dry, cold and moist, cold and dry, which are the foure compound tempers, their fixation consisting in that oleaginous humour, which wee call innatum calidum; and this innate so utile, and necessary, as a cause with out which mixt bodys cannot subsist; 't is also fomented and supported by fluent heat contra∣cted in the heart, veines and Arte∣ries, as their proper Channels consi∣sting of spirituall blood preserved in the heart, as the middle of the body, which by a lively consent doth maintaine & support innate heat, and perfect the universal temper of the body, even as the Sun inliveneth, and inlightne h the great world, so doth the heart
ejaculate a fluent heat to the vi∣visication of the microcosine, or lit∣tle world of humane bodys, re∣freshing every part, and exciting every particular function to its proper motion; so as the innate or fixt spirit doth very much res∣pond the fluent, and such resipro∣call concordance is as necessary as circulation in the sun, whose mo∣tion being stopt, or influence ex∣tinguished but one hower, would be the ruine of the whole world; and if such a cause may be admit∣ted, as some call causa sine quâ non, then this comerce between fluent and fixt heat may be so accepted, for otherwise all naturall actions are quiet and extinct: therefore these beeing the prime existence and subsistence of humane nature, and such powerfull agents in con∣formation and nutrition, their spheare of motion may be more
or lesse adapted by external mea∣nes, either homogeniall or heteroge∣neall; And for tempers or distem∣pers in generall there can be no a∣liment or medicament so conve∣nient and agreeable as wine; for the smallest wine (if pure) is a more neat & clear pabulum, to the fluent spirits, then recent egges, or milke sucked from any creature; they all onerating nature with some ex∣crement after concoction, and in concoction must be some expence both of fluent and fixt heart, which is so much an abbreviation to a naturall beeing, but is of such puretie and spirituality, as doth receive a sudden mutation, and in its alteration addeth both light & heat to the foresaid principles, as the oyl of those natural lampes. Fernelius apprehendeth much dan∣ger either in meat or medicine, which are onerous to the princi∣ples
of nature; and therefore will have all cold diseases admit of a more safe remedie, then hot dis∣tempers, because in the regular way of cureing by contraries, the application of hot remedies to cold affects doth foment & main∣taine naturall heat, contrarily in the application of cold remedies in hot distempers, to extinguish preternatural heart; the naturall heate doth suffer much and many tymes is extinct with praeternaturall or febrill heat; but in both cold and hot affects the application of wine upon pro∣per indication, is the most Excel∣lent and in ofensive remedie. And that it is such a remedy, I shal pro duce som probable Arguments to make it more apparant to vulger intellects, after this subsequent mode. If it were by the most lear∣ned Auntients in Medicine adhi∣bited,
as a safe remedy in fevers, then it acounted proper in hot distempers, for thus it hath been administered by them, as hath been demonstrated in our former discourse, and wilbe more appa∣rant in our following of the par∣ticular and most grand affects of humane bodyes; And if it hath also been derected and ordained by the same authoritie in cold di∣stempers, then it is a proper re∣medie and approved in both; And if we perpend the specifical diffe∣rences of wines, then wee shal ma∣ke it a regular remedie according to the rule of Contrariety; for Wyne that is generous moveth in all tempers from the Centure to the circumference; and other Wy∣nes in their proper nature more apperient, open obstructions, and in a Galenicall sense all oppilations are efficient causes of putrefaction
and putrefaction of fevers; so that opening being a contrary mo∣tion to obstruction, Wine is a con∣trarie remedie per se in oppilation Et per accidens in putrid fevers; Now I shal descend to particular and difficult effects controverted amongst the Most learned, and where I find them differ in this poynt, shal endeavour to recon∣cile them, for the satisfaction of greener students, and practicers less perite which after industrie wil effect; not but his underta∣king, would better become a more learned pen and Person of a more settled condition, then a person so many yeares Exiled with his deare soveraigne, and pa∣tient Master; yet I shal proceed in the first place to that affect, which wee nominate a Frency which in truth is more properly the termination of al discourse it
selfe being the privation of dis∣course, conjunct with a fever, and in this case, whither wine may be commonly adhibited, is the diffe∣rence amongst the ancient,Hippoc. lib. de af∣fect, in∣tern. some commending, others doubting; Hippocrates affirmeth, the use of wine convenient, in all perturba∣tions of the mind, Tralianus in the same condition, where the spirits are Spent, the ventricle cold, and debil, and upon the appea∣rance of some concoction, in vigi∣lancie, or defect of rest, because of its narcotique qualitie, which is most sure, & agreable to humane nature, and for this special rea∣son, Epicurus hath taken it in large proportion, not only in all pain∣full affects, but also in the article of death, in a palsie also, which af∣fect obtayneth amongst the Gre∣cians many appellations,Galen. 2. Gal. 1. Scil: Pa∣ralisia, and Gal: paraplexià, by the
major part of Phisitians, to be ap∣prehended of the same significa∣tion, and that all the tearms signi∣fie privation of sense, and motion, in a sensible moving part; Whi∣ther wine be useful in this affect, is much controverted; Halyabbas, and Avicen, in this case appeare Hydroposians, or water drinkers, and render this reasō for the non adhi∣bition of wine, in this affect, be∣cause say they, Wine is a proper ve∣hicle, of humors to the nerues, & by its sharpnes, or pungent qua∣litie, doth enervate, and by con∣sequent foment the disease; To which I answer, that no kind of wine moderately taken, and with out any mixture, can, or doth e∣nervate quatenus vinum, because it nourisheth above any thing, and therefore is the most proper cor∣rective of such sharpe humors, because it breeds, so sweet aliment
ergo no vehicle of enervation, as they would have it; nor for their water drinking, without the assi∣stance of more exact Philosophy, can I apprehend a greater enemy to the nerves, then cold, nor any congregation, both of heteroge∣nealls, homogenealls, or ligation of sence, equally powerful to the qualitie of cold, but if they intend medicate water, it wil obtain lesse censure, though not received a comparative with wine, which used with moderation, by its dul∣ced nature, doth exceed all corro∣boratives, either chymically, or ga∣lenically prepared, and ordained, e∣specially, when the affect is chro∣nicall, for some times the affect proveth acute in the beginning, and then indicateth a thinner nu∣triment, but pure water according to Arist, doth not nourish, as hath bin formerly disputed, in my tract
of waters; In Spasmo, or a convul∣sive motion when the moving fa∣cultie is depraved, wil be a quae∣stion controverted, of the same nature, concerning the use of this juyce; Celsus in this affect, doth prohibit the use of Wine, with better reason then either Avicen, or Halyabbas, because wine doth dilate, and thus contract the ner∣ves, which sensibly appeareth to all artificers,Hippoc. 5. A∣pher. 2. de morb. educated by sensible precepts, to induce convulsions, according to Hippoc, and not with∣out the consent of Avicen and Se∣rapio in this case the adhibition of dilute wine, in reconciliation of these authors, Celsus must by my selfe be understood to speake of this affect, quatenus in principio; and if my memory in so long exile both from my Country, & books (by that ever cursed Parlament of 1641. fayle me not) these are his
owne words, In principio nequaquam convenit vinum, ubi autem morbus de∣clinare incipit,Hippoc. 4. de acu∣tis. vinum convenit, quia magis dissipat, & attenuat, and after the same manner Hippoc. must be understood, where he ordaineth wine, for although wine may not be so convenient in the begin∣ning of a convulsion, yet in the progresse of the disease, must be a proper adjuvant; In opthalmia, or inflammation of the eyes Mercu∣rialis ordaineth wine in the declen∣tion, for the unquestionable drinke, without any mixture, be∣cause it doth then concoct, and determine the disease,Galen. 6. A∣phor. 31. especially generated of cold matter, & cause blood, in which case Galen affir∣meth vinum generosum, and that he hath effected this cure, by the same meanes in a pleurîsie,Hippoc. 3. de Morbis. which is a phlegmon, of the membrane succinct the Ribbs. Hippoc. ordai∣neth
the use of sweet wine, as an in crassative, and expectorative which are most properly indica∣ted from the inflammation it selfe yet the stricter sort of Phisitians are of opiniō, this book, reputationis causa, was by the Cnydians compo∣sed, & published, under his name,Hippoc. l. de acut. the doubt is raised, out of his owne booke de acutis, where he damneth the Cyndian Physitians for their ignorance, and want of regular goverment in the diaeting affected persons, yet none can ac∣cept against the use of hot quali∣ties, as adverse to the breast; In a cyncope, or passion of the heart, which although most diseases in their course, offer offence to this part, yet I could never meet with any, that by a special excellencie, or proprietie were affects of this noble part, but these two Scil: af∣fectus syncopalis, and palpitatio
cordis, and these have their prime localitie in the heart, in the first of these passions, and in all such per∣sons affected, the considiration is, how convenient, the use of wine wil appeare,Gal. l. 1. ad Glane 14 Me∣thod. 22 Avicen 11. Cap. 3. de Sinc. being for aliment, or medicament much doubted, by some Physitians, because Galen, & Avicen doe except against the use of wine as obnoxious to such per∣sons, as are afflicted from the head or labour with ingent feavors; To which I answer though this pas∣sion of the heart, may be more oppressed with such consent of parts, and complication of affects, yet extra paroxismum, or upon the least appearance of victory in nature, where refection of spent spirits is indicated, there is no∣thing so safe, and suddayne to ef∣fect it as wine,Averr. 7 Collect. 7 in this respect it is by a compulsive necessitie, to be abhibited, and Averroes is of my
sence in this case, as also the Sara∣ceus amongst whom it was a cu∣stome or law, not to tast of wine ordinarily, yet in such necessitie they were permitted wine, and in this passion, as the best remedie, so is it also in palpitatione Cordis; or in the unnatural beating of the heart least by the deficiencie of spirit, or any other preternatural Conatus, the aegrotant fall into the former passion, which is a syncope; pro∣vided in this palpitation the wine be old, and pure; Amongst the various diseases of the ventricle, I shal only rest upon the Canine appetite, or the unnatural lust af∣ter meat, because it admitteth more doubt, then any of the pre∣cedent affects, wine being gene∣rally granted by consent both Theologicall, and humane, to be most proper to excite a depraved appetite,Hyppoc: 2. aph. 21 according to its proper
acception, for some wine accor∣ding to Hyppocrates, doth extin∣guish hunger, and Galen: doth in his interpretation conceive him principally to intend this canine appetite, and the specifique wine to be most pure, and without mixture; & in my owne opinion, where this affect shal proceed from a cold, and depraved humor, vitiating the retentive faculty, the use of wine pure is an excellent remedy;Hippoc: de arte veter. and yet I meet an excep∣tion in Hyppoc: though wine be pure, yet if old (that is superan∣nuated) and lusty, such as wee call Vinum vetus generosum, by him is not in this case permitted,Galen: 7. meth. by which it is manifest that he tooke notice of the specificall difference in wines, Galen: also is of the same sence, but they must by my com∣ment be understood of excesse, which will deject the appetite, &
so prove a bonum presens, but if this excesse prove vomitorius, and so clense the ventricle of the morbid cause, then 't is a plaine curative; Concerning immoderate thirst, which is conjunct with al feavors, and of it self an immoderate, or excessive appetite of moisture, whither wine of any degree, may encrease, or extinguish this sym∣ptome, is the doubt; because sicci∣tie by the rule of contrarietie, can not be corrected but with humi∣ditie, therefore wine being gene∣rally by the most Phisitians in France adjudged hot and dry, can not be granted a remedy in this case; the reasons of their opinion, I can conceive to be no other then they render for Phlebotomie, in all affects, and at all times, ages, and sexes, and the mode of France is their sole argument, and they would have others accept it a De∣monstrative,
I am sure in neither opinion, either Grecians, Arabians, or learned Modernes will joyne Issue with them; Galen: will have the sweetest wine to be the most moyst of all other liquids, and though it doth heat; 't is calefactio∣ne temperata, which is no praeter∣naturall, or intemperate caliditie, and both Galen:Hyppoc: salut diae∣ 30. and Hippoc: testifie small dilute wine doth quench, or extinguish thirst, much more in a small quantity, then fountaine∣water in a large measur, of one time, or by often repetition, for these reasons, because dilute wine is cold & moist, ergo most proper to correct hot and dry, and extin∣guish thirst; there is also a more penetrative power in wine, then in water, and as humective, there fore doth sooner determine thirst; and my self have many yeares ob∣served in the highest feavors, one
draught of dilute wine, to effect more then many flagons of water, or such like, cold decoctions, nor can any Physitian satisfie such thirst with water, and not tumble upon this rock scil: extinction, or debilitation of naturall heat, with praeternaturalie in illeo, or the twi∣sting of the bowells, which affect sometime is a consequent of the collique, & by which they are of∣ten strangled, & a disease, not fre∣quently noted in Medicall books; Celius Aurel: saith that the Pythago∣reans in Sicile,Cal: an∣rel. l. 3. de acut. pas∣sions, were accustomed to nominate this disease Sepimen∣tum, as if there were a hedge, sepa∣rating the bowells, others call in Volentus, or rowling of the bowells over each other Scribonius, & Mar∣cellus doth name it a Phlegmon, or inflammation both of small and great guts, others call it tormen∣tum acutum & illiacam passionem, and
these appellations will be ac∣knowledged; for no sharpe payne (in my opinion) can be inflicted upon a sensible body; whither Wine in this grand inflammation, may be conducible, will prove a quarrell between Hippoc:Hop: 3. de morb: and Cae∣lius, the one ordayning the drin∣king of generose wine in this case; the other absolutely damning it in the whole course of cure; by which doth appear a grand mis∣understanding, in my last Author, concerning Hippoc: and a rash cen∣sure, because Hippoc: in that place forementioned, doth conceive this affect to proceed principally from a cold cause, and such hu∣mors are more reasonably dissol∣ved by generous wine, then any other; and mine owne reason of this remedy is grounded upon the non passage of excrements in this disease, and the necessity of nutri∣ment,
by which it will appeare, that from this remedy, can pro∣ceed no oneration of the body with excrements, because it lea∣veth none, or any that passeth thorough any Port, or passage, but the bladder; and for aliment, no other succus, so speedy and inof∣fensive. The antecedent affect being the disturbance of the re∣ceptacles of dry excrements, it wil not look like a disorderly motion to commit to every consideration such affects, as doe molest the re∣ceptacles of moist excrements, & principally the obstruction of the Rhenes, which parts were dedica∣ted by nature to no other use elce, but to separat serososhumores frō the blood, & conveigh them through the body, by those ducts, & chan∣nells according to the universall opinion of all Phisitians, since therefore this is their office, and
that this percolation is hindered often by oppilation from severall causes, producing various affects, the most common cause being the Stone, and that in the cavity of the Rhenes, though other affects are subjected in the substantiall parts thereof; The Question now is, whither the drinking sulphureous waters, or wine, doth most condu∣ce to the cure of this affect. Avicenna adjudgeth the drinking of Thermall waters, either in a smal, or great quantity, to procure great difficulty in pissing, and though the grand compression of such wa∣ters in a large proportion may force a stone, into the pot, yet not without exceeding difficulty and agitation of settled humors, from which violence, & forced motion proceedeth excoriations, ulcers and various distempers as dangerous and troublesome as the former
obstruction, therefore in this case white subtile wine that is not astringent, is better approved then such waters; therfore in the right regiment of dyet, in this distem∣per, white wine is to be preferred before incertayne mineral tinctu∣res, and if they were certainly known, and perfectly separated, yet cannot the practice be justified safe, because Natura non patitur af∣flictionem, and many rules admitt exception, so doth this except against violence to nature; mine∣ralls therefore, being in their own nature more heterogeneall to ani∣mals, then any vegetall, must (though most exactly prepared) offer violence to natur; as for the stone in the bladder, I shall joyne with Paracelsus & his nil nisi cultrum & prescribe no other remedy, but the knife. For other medicines of several formes and matter, though
Capevactius drew me over his dis∣course with many score probats, yet is forced with this parenthesis to conclude. Sed ingenuè fateor me nescire quid potest lapidem vesicae fran∣gere, Mercurialis in a flux of blood from the Rhenes adviseth, absti∣nence from Wine omnino, & in the place ordayneth calybrate water, which is a poore corroborative in a grand flux, and expence of spirit continually, nor is it incrassative, or corrective, of acrimonie, te∣nuity, and sharpnes of humors, being the principall causes of such distempers (except eruption, or perforation of the urine) there∣fore under favour, I shal as boldly and more reasonably (I suppose) ordayne the use of black, & thick wine, not only to incrassate, and dulicifie the humor in the first causes, but as a better sanative in eruption of the urine, and for the
refreshment, and refection of spirit, more reasonably to be adhi∣bited, then any calybeate vvater, though better prepared vvith the juyce of pomegranats and quin∣ces; In our subsequent discourse, vvee cannot avoyd the bladder, as one of the forenamed receptacles of liquid humors, and having be∣fore determined the only cure of the stone generated in this part, by a petrefiring quality conferring thereunto, I shall diluci'dly, with out prolixity, render my sense concerning the suppression diffi∣culty, stillicide, or voiding urine by drops, these being proper di∣seases of the bladder, though di∣versly contracted, from other vi∣cine parts, causally, but subjected in the bladder, as subjectum bene dis∣positum, to receive such confluen∣ces, the number and differences of such causalls vvill offer too much
prolixity for this short underta∣king, for an iscuria or suppression of urine, admitteth of very much dispute in medicall scholes, about the causes essentiall, and acciden∣tall, therefore I shall only passe to the proper remedies of such affect so caused.Hippoc: . Aph. 4. Hippoc: telleth me that all cold qualities are enemies to the bladder from whose testimo∣ny those remedies, which are ap∣plyed to that part, must be poten∣tially hot, and if wee consider the membranous substance, and exan∣guitie of the part, wee shall soon apprehend his reason, that all cold is highly offensive to nervie sub∣stances, nor can there appeare to my intellect any more, then one scope of cure in all the forenamed diseases, and that is diereticall, or such meat, or medicine as doth not violently provoke, but gently move urine, else one affliction is
added to the other; therefore I shal present pure wine as the most convenient, dyaretique, and with∣out dispute, if the cause be as cold, as the part. In order of place, the next Lecture must be of the disea∣ses of the penis, the word needeth no other interpretation, there are not only such affects, as labefact the bladder, but also such as vitiate the action of the penis, I shall therfore relate those affects which hinder the proper action of this part, for although it be dedicated to conveigh urine, out of the bladder, yet most properly for the propagation, of the species, which cannot be effected without ere∣ction, and ejaculation, the first may appeare without the other, and then propagation cannot suc∣ceed, which is demonstrated in this affect, which wee call Priapis∣mus, which is an extension and e∣rection
of the penis, without de∣sire of Venerie; Concerning the tractation of this disease wee can∣not but take notice of the name, as also the nature, the name I could never find in Hipp:Galen. 6. e loc. af∣ect. Cap. . nor any other ancient writers (except Ga∣len) by whom is rendred the de∣rivation of the name from Priapus who was much noted for the ma∣gnitude and extension of this vi∣rile member,Gal 14. ethod. ap. 7. 't is also nominated Satyriasis, by Galen, and AEtius, lea∣ving the reader to take notice of the difference amongst writers concerning these tearms, as to prolix (especially) when they may receive better satisfaction from Egineta, and Cal. Aurel; there∣fore the nature of this affect, shall be my principall considera∣tion which consisteth in exten∣sion, and erection of the member without power of ejaculation,
though it doth proced both from a seminal, as well as a flatuent sti∣mulation, this being the nature of the infirmity, I cannot conceive the moderat use of generous Wine, for recovery, to be improperly in∣dicated, because it abolisheth all crudities, and indigestions which are causes of flatulency, and doth generate a lively blood which doth effect powerfull matter: o∣thers there are which extract this affect from externall causes, both hot and cold, taking the ground of their opinion from brutes, which generally forbeare coition, or copulation in the winter and height of Sommer; and because universall temper of women, is more cold then of men; therefore their desires are lesse in winter, & men more in Summer apt to Ve∣nerious action; in both these cau∣ses,Arist. 4. Pre∣blem. the use of the fore named Wine
is necessarily indicated, because the excessive heat doth dissipate the Central spirits to the circum∣ference, by which the concoctive facultie is so debilitated, as can ef∣fect nothing but such crudities as are causes of flatulency, oppila∣tion and putrefaction, which ra∣dicall and fluent spirits vagrant, are retracted, to the center by Wine and the parts enabled to execute their offices; in the other case when the spirits are allmost ex∣tinct with excessive cold, the mo∣derate use of this juyce is the cor∣dial refreshment. The paynes of the joynts which are called Antriticall, will beget a great dispute, or con∣troversie, with vulgar practicers whither or not, Wine may be granted, in such doloriferous af∣fects in the joynts, confisting of the juncture of bones with ner∣ves, which nervy substance, is the
sole capacity of these paynes, as being the principall organs of ex∣act sence, and that sence of payne so extractive, as ordinarily doth move, both spirits and humors, with such violence, as doth in∣flame themselves, & by the com∣mon received opinion, Wine can∣not but more inflame; and such vulgars doe as often and erroni∣ously nominate these paynes of the bones, though the bones are no more sensible of payne then the nayles, or hayre in clipping, ac∣cording to Arist. Galen, and Avicen in many places;Arist. de part ani∣mal. 9. Gal. l. 16. d. use partium. Hippoc. l. de af∣fectis. The causes inter∣nall of these articulate paynes move upon one hinge of Hippo∣crates, which he calleth humors, and they must be congested extra locum, and in themselves are more or lesse vitious; flatulency in this affect will have no share by the consent of Mercurialis; and for
my own sence of Hippocrates in that place, it cannot expresse any other humor, then yellow choller, or atred or a mixture of both, for phlegme by its visco∣sity and crassitude, cannot pene∣trate such sensible sparts, nor can it effect any pain, nisi dolor gravis which cause being granted, I shall make very good use of Wine contra omnes gentes, for where there is any complication of phlegme, by rea∣son of its crassitude and gravitie, it abateth much the punctorious payne of the article, but doth ef∣fect more permanency of payne, because it cannot passe through the pores by so quick exsudation; whither wine in this condition may be conducible to the cure, & when, is the subsequent discourse, and a knowne controversy in this case, therefore I shall rneder the sence of the most exact writers,
and then take boldnes to present my own; Mercurialis with alothers agre, that in the beginning of this distemper from a cholerique cau∣se, no kind of wine can be granted convenient, yet in the declension of the disease they with Avicen doe permitt the use of it; how this de∣clēsion is to be apprehended (un∣der favour) is ambiguous, for I cannot understand this declina∣tion to be such, as doth fully de∣termine the affect, for then their opinions signifie nothing, quia omnia Sana Sanis, and no rationall Physitian wil forbid the moderate use of wine, after a perfect re∣covery of the distemper, let it be of what nature soever; therefore they must be understood of de∣clension in statu morbi; yet the proper wine that doth correct that hot and bilious humour, and with more celeritie, open the porositie,
of the parts affected, cannot (ex∣cept puritanically) be ojbected a∣gainst, neither in the beginning, State, nor declination of the di∣sease, arising from the foresayd bi∣lious cause; as for the complicate cause, I doubt not of the consent and samenes, of fence in approba∣tion of the moderate use of Spa∣nish wine, that is subtill and old, but in the thinner acrimonious cause, I have adhibited pure whit wine, and in a large quantitie, not only to correct that which was fi∣xed, but to evacute that which was fluent, both by urine and sweat, and by its narcotique quali∣ty, to moderate the intollerable paine of the part, but where visco∣sity carrieth to the part only a tin∣cture of choller there I shall pre∣sent Spanish wine, and it is the or∣dinance of Rhasis in the gout of the feet proceding from such cau∣se,
Hipp. alloweth Vinum dulce in a bilious predominancy, but that,Hippoc. l. de af∣fect, in∣tern. but that book is taken from an ascript of the indian Physitians, who never were excellent in the diaeteticall part of Physique, I shal now con∣clude all these disputes with a pu∣trid feavor, and then give some ac∣compt of the best moderne con∣sultations in particular cases, both hot and cold; The tractation of feavors in their differences, would be of litle consideration, because Galen wil have all acute diseases to be simply putrid feavors,Galen. 3. Cap. 8. de differ. respir. lib. 1. de different. sebr. Cap. 3. or conjunct with them, and it is a re∣ceived opinion of the ancients, that al feavors (except Epheme∣rall) are putrid,Hippoc. l. de vit. Medici∣na. and Hippocrates will have neque Calidum, neque fri∣gidum per se; to be the cause of feavors, sed aliquid amarum, & acer∣bum, but a quality of salt or bitter, or sharp predominancie; & there∣fore
his sense is, that all febrile heat, proceedeth from the predo∣minate motion of and alteration of pure humors, to impurity, Ga∣len, Plato, Athenaeus, are al of this fence, therefore it doth behoove Physitians to perpend not only the universal cause, and nature of putrefaction, but also the reason of correction, which is my scope at present, therefore with the an∣cients I apprehend putrefaction, to signifie a mutation of perfe∣ction or puritie, to imperfection and impuritie,Galen. lib. 10. Meth. 8. as when wine is changed to vinegar. Galen concei∣veth, putrefaction to be a muta∣tion of the whole putrefying sub∣stance, and effected by external & ambient heat, by which mutation Aristotle understandeth corruptiō, & by Galen I (suppose understood a mutation to corruption,) there∣fore bodies are lesse putreable in
winter, then in summer, because external ambient heat is then more minute, both in ayre, and water. What reason wee shall render of cure is the expectation of the reader, who wil as suddainly, take notice of my indication, properly extracted or deduced from the nature of putrefaction; which ac∣cording to Galen is the corrupti∣ble disposition in humors from a cause either internall or external, and accordingly, doe present for a remedie omniquaque, dilute wine, not such as is mixed with water, but such as in its own nature is more, or hath more of the a∣queous, then vinous qualitie, and yet so naturally complexioned, as will appeare a corrective, or alte∣rative, to praeternaturall siccity, and impure humidity; ergo the consequence must be a roduction
to harmony, quia Sanitas est nil nisi harmonia, as also an apt prevention of putredinous distempers, which according to the judgement of the ancients, doe proceed from oppilation, nothing being more moderately aperient then such wine, nor more tartarous; there∣fore I have made observation of such persons, accustomed to the use of wine, according to their age, and clime, or without such acception, not to have bin subject to putrid feavors, nor can any person demonstrate wine, per se, and specifically, ordained ever the mother of such mischief, though many have suffered distempers fro excesse, which is the vice of the best aliment and the worst, yet such accidents fell not from the nature, or quality of wine (though in excesse) but from the present soporisique quality, vvhich, vvith
out prevention, must succeed, and vvith cure for the best, for sleep stoppeth all evacuation (except sweat) & vvine naturally moving from the center to the circumfe∣rence, and their negligent posture, in the ambient closing the porosi∣ty of the body universally, by this povver conjunct vvith the endea∣vour of nature, to deliver it selfe, of a burthen, doth by its violent motion, in flame spirits & conse∣quently this febril distemper; pu∣trefaction in this place and case, is excepted, according to vulgar sen∣ce; nor can the subtilty of logique, being an incommodum upon this vinose remoedy,Galen. 2. de acut. Galen dot maintain the rationality of it as a remedy in putrid feavors, & therefore com∣mended the Italian mode in adhi∣biting in al feavors, Vinum Sabinum, and confesseth in the same first book Cap. 40. that himselfe was
accustomed to cure putrid fea∣vors, after the same manner, and if any wil take notice of Hîppocrates, not only in his book de acut, but in others, they shal find my bold∣nes in this practice grounded upon himselfe, whose soul I could desire above all terrestriality, not that I desir ōly to act or cloath my self with a part, or habit of a Phy∣sitian, as players doe the Persons of Kings and noble Persons, no sooner disnobled & disrobed, but rogued; I am not ignorant of the diversity of Medicall sects, not doe condemne any (but moun∣ters) but from this digression I shal transire to those strict Physi∣tians which doe condemne the use of wine, not only in this case but in al feavorish distempers, but because they render no reason, I cannot judge their sect for Me∣thodists argue with reason, and
Empericks a particulari (though not the best Logick) yet if it be possible to bring them into the sect of rationalists I shall assist thē with this exception in Galen:Galen. Meth. 11. & 12. ad Glauc. which is against the use of any wine, in these foure subsequent cases, first when the feavor is ve∣hement, secondly, when there is a conjunct payne from the head, the third is, in delirio, which is a deception of reason, and lastly, when the origo of this putrid fea∣vor is from, or doth, follow an inflammation. Under favour, the differences of wine observed, wil respond all these objections, as small dilute wine in all inflammations, and more liberally, or in a larger dosse prescribed doth abate, if not abo∣lish all vehemency, and by its so∣porifick quality doth coligate the senses, and reconcile sleep, which
is the diminution of all vehement symptomes, delyration, and shar∣pest paynes of the head, which imperite Physitians, more dan∣gerously force by opiate prepara∣tions, and I shall conclude with the same Authority I began this discouse,Galen. 11. Meth. 9. Galen. l. 1. de An∣tid. 3. and render the affirma∣tion of Galen, that this kind of wine, is most convenient in putrid causes, to provoke urine, and con∣coct crudities, or semiconcocted humors, and wil not admitt the mixture of water, more then it receiveth from the plant; and this is the determination of the que∣stion, concerning the application or use of wine in feavors; Now I shal proceed to various affects, a∣bout which the most learned Mo∣dernes have consulted; whither the use of wine in them might be conducible to cure, because some are hot, the others cold distem∣pers,
and begin with a Iew that laboured with Melancholy, his temper hot & dry, from a vitious predominancie over the blood, his body leane, colour black, in∣disposed to sleep, prompt to all action, prone to anger, of an ex∣cellent witt and discourse, but at this present Mute, and hath bin so these six dayes, his temper thus agreed upon, with his distemper, by a counsell of Doctors; they now fix upon two scopes of cure, the one moistning, the other ope∣ning obstructions, and in both, wine is concluded a proper reme∣die; There was also another great consult about a Cannon of Rome, labouring with a feavor, whither wine might be prescribed; about this point was much controversy, but concluded, and adhibited the remedie; Nor doe I read of any o∣ther Medicament in all this con∣sultation;
sutation; In the next place, I pre∣sent a young Gentlewoman la∣bouring with an Epilepsie, or fal∣ling sicknes, her temper hot, and moist, and so concluded in coun∣sell, because they found her body fat, and fleashy, in this case they determined the use of wine most convenient, for the attenuation of humors, and corroboration of all noble parts; The same was agreed upon for a young Spanyard in a burning feavor, in a great distilla∣tion, pro Episcopo Lucensi; in various distempers pro Aloysio Foscareno; in vertigine or dissines of the head, pro cive Lucensi; a∣gainst al effects of the Rhenes and bladder, pro Magnifico Contare∣no, with many others which were too prolix to produce, enough being argued to instruct the use of wine, in all tempers, to be most natural aliment, and in all distem∣pers,
as proper medicament, con∣cluded by the most learned, an∣cient, and Moderne in Medicine; Thus farre have I urged the use of pure Wine, not that I am ignorant of the excellent advantage in me∣dicall wines, the ordinance of which is left to the judgement, & direction of the present agent, my selfe passing now to every age and sex, to shew the proper use of wine for aliment in each, and the time when; my former discourse hath tended more to medicament then aliment, which is to be the subject of our following discour∣se, though not so immixed but some vigencie may intervene. Humane bodies, are not only obnoxious, daily to affects of ayre, dyet, exercize, passions of the mind &c: but also from our im∣planted, and internall heat, which by degrees, more, or lesse, doth dry
up, and demolish our origenall humidity, which in some sence ariseth out of it self, and by this perpetual motion, is so consumed, as doth effect many mutations, which are conscribed with certayn periods, and conversions of ages; for every animal newly procee∣ding, or pullulant ex semine, & san∣guine and compounded of its prime humidity, is most humide, in whom all parts organicall, as bones, cartilages, & flesh, are soft, tender, and flexible, which by pro∣gression in age, doth stiffen, dry, wither and consume, in the like mode, are the vicissitudes, and mutations of temperaments, and distempers, with their conjuncts; therefore age is but a motion measured out by time, in which the constitution of the body, by it self is perspicuously changed; Six not able differences of ages,
with their temperaments, are to be observed; the first the child age, which extendeth from the birth to the 14. or 15. year, & in temper, hot, and moist, and is more hot, then ripe, and juvenall age, by rea∣son of fixed heat, for by how much neerer it is, to its originall, by so much the more doth it participate of innate heat, contrarily, by how much it doth receed from its first principles, by so much is the in∣nate heat exhausted; And this age, one of the ancients divideth into foure orders, infancy, dentity, and media between these, and ripe age, and lastly puberty, which pre∣senteth it self aptly to be discour∣sed, as the second age in the order of nature; This age of puberty begins at the fiveteenth year, and is extended to the eighteenth, and is lesse moist, but more hot; The third age is adolescency,
which beginneth at the nine∣teenth year, and is extended to twenty five, and of a moderate temper; The fourth age is juvenil, or flourishing young age, which beginneth at the 25. year and ex∣tendeth to thirty five, and is more hot and dry in temper then the precedent age; The fift age is virill and the media between young and old age yet doth it not so partici∣pate of either, as to affect, or in∣temperate it, as it beginneth at thirty five, so it extendeth to fourty nine; The last is old age, which by the expence of naturall heat in temper is cold and dry, the moisture being excrementitious, by reason of languishing and de∣cayed heat; This last age, as the first doth admit of division into these three parts, the first is fresh old age, beginning at fifty, and extendeth to sixtie, and all this
time is serviceable to the country in execution of Offices, which may comply with their former e∣ducation, the second age is a me∣dia, or middle old age, beginning at sixty, and extending to seventy, and in this age most men are un∣serviceable for their country, or selves; the last decrepid age, be∣ginning at seventy, and is com∣monly extended to eighty; and with this age our terrestical being & life is concluded; not but some extraordinarie puritie in the prin∣cipals of some individualls, which may cause a larger extention of life; These are the common dif∣ferences of humane age, the first ingresse hot and moist, the last egresse, cold and dry, the middle temperate and proved so to be by every sence; And thus is the life of man,Iob. which springeth up like a flower and with a short duration
in one State, circled out a puncto, ad punctum, and shall render it probable by art, to extend mans life, and preserve it from the seve∣rity of some distempers, conveig∣hed in the naturall principles of their mixture, commonly recei∣ved for distempers hereditarie; & defence to be caused by the right use, and application of this juyce, from which familiarity with uni∣versall nature, life is extended beyond all expectation; which is such a defensitive in weak tem∣pers, as doth enable to resist faci∣ble assaults, conveighed in materia spermatica. The best oportunity of effecting such undertaking, is ab incunabolis, or from the breast of the mother and so proceed from temper to temper, as they admit of mutation, in their severall ages, otherwise, the universall temper may be so injured, as spoyled, by
antecedent irregularity, both of dyet, and medicine, as will cause great difficulty in future under∣takings; for though much advan∣age of time be gayned, yet the perfection of cure, or full satisfa∣ction of the creature, will not be obtayned. I could render an Em∣pyricall argument from my own affect which was then an Atrophia totius corporis, or consumption of the whole body, and left by the most perite Physitians as incura∣ble; my valitudinary temper then, being untill the age of thirty years, affrighted at the sight of one glass of wine, being a strict observer of such advice, as must be accompted more learned, then my own young studies could produce; but when I was left to my free choyce, of any thing my reason could present, or appetite require, upon those grounds of Philosophy which I
had meditated, I did cast my An∣chor at the root of this plant, and by the constant use of the juyce recovered in the space of twelve moneths perfection of cure, and have in such state of health conti∣nued twenty and two years after, and voyd of a consumptive dispo∣sition to this day, & have in many others since observed such levamen as in a latitude, may be esteemed a cure; and the right use and appli∣cation of this juyce cannot be de∣nyed, in purity to exceed all sper∣matique humors, sucked either from women, or breasts, according to ancient & more moderne pra∣ctive; This is a Nectar, and Am∣brosia for Princes and as pleasant contemplation for Phisitians, learnedly to undertake the practi∣ce of it; for as this life may be said to be the unum necessarium, be∣cause upon this point eternite
doth, or may depend, and that the lives of Kings are more conside∣rable, then other Individualls, as being the souls of their King∣dome and people, it cannot but encourage the study of all Physi∣tians, for the particular, and com∣mon safety, and preservation of this Iewel, to endeavor a right understanding of the use, and ap∣plication of the blood of the gra∣pe; and the most learned, in their highest contemplations, shall find this subject worthy of their indu∣stry, as their exceding expressions, above this my velle, wil hereafter manifest; if I should relate my many difficult, and disputable cu∣res, of my own effecting, in a mul∣titude of severalls, it might not onely seeme ostentative, but also an act of injustice, and non inte∣grity to others to publish persons with their imperfections, com∣mitted
to my cure, & secrecy; nor is testimony in this case of such absolut necessity, where the point is rationally cleared, & consented unto, by the most learned fathers, and Shoolemen in the faculty of Medicine; upon which ground I shall desire credit, and esteeme in the first place, and so returne from my digression, to my proper sub∣ject, and try whither I can make it suitable to all ages; The infant age is the first, & most difficult to reconcile, because Galen saith, ac∣cording to the colection of Frabesarius, vinum infantibus fit noci∣vum, because their temper is hot and moist, but suerely he was bet∣ter acquainted with the sence, and soul of Galen, to conceive him speaking of the specifical differen∣ce of such wine, as is indicated for nutriment in this age, for then he must challenge him of such mis∣understanding
of Phylosophy, as not to comprehend, mixed bo∣dies to be supported and nouri∣shed, by their simile, and force him ignorant of ijs nutrimus, quibus constamus, or that such mixed qualities properly applyed, are unapt, or insufficient in their own nature, to assimilate with their identitie, or samenes, as is the mixture of wine, to our materiall principles of nature; but Galen cannot be understood of the qua∣lity, but super exceeding quanti∣ty, which as too much oyle doth extinguish the Lampe, or distur∣be it by moving some other hete∣rogeneal which by the true sup∣port of wine nature had been a∣ble insensibly to have disposed o∣therwise, for had the nature of wine in it self appeared to Hippo∣crates abnoxions he would never have ordained the dieting of
children in the stone either of the rhenes or bladder ad hereditary to consist of white wine rather then milk nor was he ignorant that he∣reditary diseases were Communi∣cated to the children any other∣wise then in their spermatick principles, nor that wine in it selfe and its own nature could be disa∣greable in the support of those principles, or to foment & main∣tain their constitutions, with out any morbificall motion or altera∣tion, my self hath also much used it in affects of the same natur and in many other with exceeding approbation from sucesse, nor can I conceive wine hurtfull to any temper of it self without the mis∣application and indiscretion of the agent not knowing the speci∣ficall differences and mode or use, by these expressions (I presume) the understanding reader to have
received satisfaction for the first age & that it is absolved from the former prohibition and at liberty freely to make use of wine, now I am to present a health to the next order which wee called pubertie, this temper being more hot, and lesse moist then the former yet by such wine as doth contemper the heat, and adde to hte moisture, that wine wil and must prove pro∣perly usefull to this age, the time when & quanteties how much as well as the quanteties ought to be directed by the physitian, who must necessarely obey his indica∣tions and proper scopes, Adoles∣cency being of a middle temper & predominancy neither hot nor cold nor moist or dry, will mode∣rately and with observation of tyme, clyme, and quanteties, ad∣mitt of white, clarret and rhenish wines with out any fear, Iuven∣tus
being of a temper more hot and dry must with the former a∣spects apply it self to the forena∣med wines, and if they sensibly appear not sufficiently moistning, 't is sooner effected by the addi∣tion of fountaine water. Verile age from thirty five to four∣ty nine broatcheth a vessel of more rich clarret and passeth out with a taist of the smal∣lest sack which senectus maketh,Bolonia wine. more strong by more rith sack, muscadins and aligants, and conti∣nueth their use to the utter extent and period of life, having thus ap∣plyed it to every age and cleared my proposition, the next conside∣ration will concerne the sex, male and faemale, which though some have more out of curiosity then utillity differenced their tempers, most of their litigation beeing de lana Caprina or the various tem∣peraments
of sexes affirming wo∣men must of necessity be selled in the left side, and therefore more debill and cold then men, which if it be granted for the satisfaction of such fancy, yet my observation is with out any difference so a liene, & my opinion in the poynt, is also that temperaments are not conflate out of heat more obtuse, or vehement (though it may sig∣nifie some thing ingestation) but depend on the perfusion and con∣sent of the four elements, there∣fore having formerly more di∣stinctly discoursed of tempera∣ments, I have also included sexes, and now passe to the mode of useing this subject, all my former labour hath been a Phylosophical extraction and separation of wine, in its principles and medically taught the familiar use, both for aliment and medicament, not
doubting its general acceptation, and were it not agreeable in the same sense to such use I shal inge∣niously acknowledge my non un∣derstanding of Aristotle his ali∣mentm simile and dissimile for al∣though all aliment of het coldest quality must receive a forme of heat before it can be produced in∣to a nutritive act, yet is there no such forme or substance so tran∣cible and naturally disposed to sanguification and nutrition as the blood of the grape, and an au∣gmentation of radicall moisture or inuates heat may be granted, their can be nothing in humane conception more apt to effect it, for tis oleagenous and a just pro∣position fomenteth the flame, which aquositie doth extinguish, so as it is the true nectar, by the use where of the principles of life are augmented, naturall humors
multiplied, spirits created and re∣freshed, strength restored, care expelled, and juvency or youth∣fulnesse concerved, to conclude, it is the all to a naturall body, for a∣liment in generall is and by com∣mon consent granted to be liquid ayrie, and sold which qualities are the complement of this juyce, I have also proved it a convenient medicament in the most difficult and disputable affects of the body and if I should recomend the ex∣cesse of pure wine, or an opera∣tive dosse once every month the Arabian Physitian will justify my Ordinance, as hath appeared by their own practice and self custo∣me affirming it to recreat the ani∣mal faculties, reconcile sleep pro∣voks urine and sweat, dissolve su∣perfluities and a certaine cure in a quartain fever with many other distempers, circumstances condu∣cible
observed, which circumstan∣ces I have given notice of in the precedent discourse, and resolved to entertaine this time with sub∣stance, only take notice of custo∣me to be in a latitude or some consideration substantial, because it over ruleth or comprehendeth as a second nature both time and clyme, and there are some as neces∣sary accommodations to the right use of this aliment as condiments are to ntritive substances of an other condition, as principally the direction of, and consult with the Physitian, for let the temper or distemper be of any nature (ex∣cept gangranous, or wounds vice∣rat, by his right and proper appli∣cation they shal sensibly perceive a refreshment and prolongation of life, without which nothing is pleasant to universall nature, for what is aliment with out an appe∣tite
or land, when the owner can not trample it, or any other de∣light to an incapacity; The chimi∣cal sect urge the pleasantnesse of their extract as a grand beauty in their medicine, but heere I present a safety and pleasantnesse trans∣cending all minerall opperations, and effected by an undoubted re∣giment of fire, and to be preferred Prince of all other vegitalls; ex∣cesse in this juce may be more ea∣sily repaired, and the distemper more speedely and inoffencively reduced to harmonie, the princi∣pal difficulty wilbe in obteining pure wine with out sophistication, for which cause, I can cordially kommend, as much as desire the Scotish severity established, a∣mongst the English nation, and that the Sophisticatiors of wine, may suffer punishment above any ordinary theef, as not onely pic∣king
the purse of all nations, but with a secret venene mixture paynfully afflicting them, & often irrecoverably, no vetrickle being so proper to conveigh any malig∣nity or venemous quality to the universall spirits of any creature then wine, if I shall dispute fur∣ther, some may take me up for prolixity, and others stop me for a non visitavit, well knowing that Galen: with his commentary upon the Aphorisimes translated, urgeth that wine as venus doth debilitate innervate, and Frambesarius will according to the Frensh mode ex∣alt a messe of pottage Frensh, be∣yond a chine of English beefe and therefore addeth these insignificāt (Scil) vinum venusque nocent eodem modo & if hee or any other under∣stand or undertake Galen: in that literal sense, they must confute him beyond Iohannes Argenterius
with whom I left Ranchnius his Countriman at foyles, and leave it to those of leasure or standers by, to divulge the victory, but if in that litteral sense apprehended the objection I confesse is instar ommium whether it be taken for the use, or excesse of wine, and in the first sense it wil affront greater artists, and in the second opposite to the Arabians which hath told the Graecians and other opposits that their Countty is their dis∣grace, and those ostentators a dis∣grace to their Country, Avicen∣na, Rhasis, and Averrhoes advise it usque ad Ebrietatem, the challeng is high and whither they have measured their weapons (I know not) but if Galen be not under∣stood to speake of Ebriety, then neither the use of wine or women can either debilitate or be abno∣ctious, for both in their orderly
mode are of much utility and concernment, the one to preserve the individuall, the other the pro∣pagation of the species, the first hath been largely disputed, the last which concerneth propaga∣tion not to be effected, but by an act venerial, which Avicenna in a melancholick predominance con∣demneth, but in his 20 and 3 chap:Avicen: 1. Tract. 3. Cap 4. de juvamentis Coitus (saith) that the use of venerie doth most help the melancholist, which opinion was accepted before from Paulus Aegineta in his first book de rebus veneriis, by which it will appeare in Avicen: contradiction of him∣selfe, and to redeeme him out of such incommoduments; let us perpend some passages of Galen:Galen. 6. Epid. Coment 5. Text 25. where he affirmeth mixtion to re∣straine diseases in fieri or in their motion, and Galen: will not ad∣mit of any other interpretation of
Hipp: but that mixtion and Coi∣tion are of the same signification and amongst other affects doth digitate melancholie, affirming moderate Coition or use of vene∣rie to be a specifick remedy, (espe∣cially proceeding from vapors of combust humors) and with out question upon this consideration, the moderate use of Venus is a considerable adjuvant, but if wee understand, or accept those fit subjects of such remedy, as are af∣fected by pungent vapors from a predominancy of naturall melan∣cholie, this flatulencie beeing more cold (though provocative) in this sense the use of venerie doth prove verry adverse, and in this sense I understand Avicen: and the exception in Galen: prin∣cipally to reflect upon, both quan∣tity and quality unseasonably ap∣plied, both in respect of tyme and
temper, as when the wine is in∣specificall to the temper or quan∣tity exceeding a naturall capacity and upon an empty body ubi vacuis committere venis nil nisi lene decet, and then immoderately to exer∣cise the act of venery, after such a mode both wine and women are innervations and great consump∣tives of sixt and fluent spirits, and where Plato and Ambrosius have an exception I apprehend it only of the nimium, which is intoxica∣tion or ebriety in a voluptuous course which doth obnubulate reason and sense rendring the per∣son inferior to a meere animal & a vice reproved by all rationales not only as it is pernitious to the body, inflaming the blood, debili∣tating the nerves and afflicting the head, but as a privation of rea∣son which is the forme of man and by which he preceadeth all other
terrestriall creatures; but I am not of opinion, that those Arabian Princes, did ever use wine in such a voluptious manner themselves, or advised it to others but medi∣cally, as will appear by their monthly prescription, upon pro∣per indication, preferring wine before any other medicine, becau∣se of its operate power, so fami∣liarly respondent to nature. This objection beeing cvleared I shall move to the last extracted from sacred scripture. There are a pre∣valent sect in England and other places where they have gayned permission, that stiffely defend with inconsiderable logick, that the fatality of mans life & actions and such considerations, are but as the judgement of men which is foolishnesse with God, because (say they) no man can be in life or fortune preserved, prolonged, assi∣sted,
or restored to either, because diseases with all their Concomi∣tants are, or must be inflicted by an inexpugnable necessity deter∣mined of the Almighty and im∣mutably fixed, and the closest councel of God, have such close clipt considerations of their op∣ponents, as if with out spectacles they could not see their lowsy Crownes, or not discerne them ri∣dicalous to intellectual persons, and pernitious to all Kingdomes and just people therof, upon this pretended ground of Religion they murther, steale, betray inno∣cents, perjure themselves, rebell a∣gainst God, their King and coun∣try, supposing no eye can see the Pharisaicall pathes they walke in, nor that they keep in memory the old cheate of the grand Pharisie, who made it a damnable sinne for the publican to dresse meat
upon the Saboth, and the same Hyppocrite, upon the same day made a great feast and invitation to our (Lord and Saviour) that he might obteyne advantage of his discourse, and in a Traterous un∣dertaking (saith hee) 't is lavvfull to breake a Comman dement, for such a breatch of command and trechery at this or that time vvas, and is by the inevitable ordinance of the Almighty, and if God shall command othervvise they are Le∣viathans and vvill acknovvledge no supreame above naturam natu∣ratam and vvithout controle doe vvhat they please as doth daily ap∣pear (amongst the rest of their cheates) their blasphemous fast∣nings and prayers, vvhich is no∣thing but a plaine mocking of omnipotency, or a request to deny his ovvn commands, for if he vvil not give a contrary command to
murder, theft, adultery, perjury, or disobedience and disloyalty, their actions bid defiance, and tell, in spight of his vvill or povver they vvill doe it, as gyants of force to unthrovvn the Gods, and then they use Demetrius his faemenine vveapons to slay their uxorious husbands, and then the people must be cheated vvith the preten∣ce of Religion and the name of God, vvhich themselves must take in to their declarations (though they hate Reformation) and perswade the people upon this hyppocriticall ground, that it is but a superfluous curiosity of some fine woven bbravnes, to avoid contagion, or to seeke remedies correcting or curring affects (yet their blasphemous prayers and fasting shall never effect) or to arme themselves against their ene∣myes and for the same reason that
God foreseeth death of every mode in time shorter or longer and his irrisistable order in such motion to bee in a voidable, and yet the same omnipotent, bath de∣clared to all humane nature, that the perdition of every person is of him selfe, otherwise he can be no delinquent in his justice, if by a supreame power inevitably obli∣ged to such actions or passions: how pernitious and impious this hereticall doctrine appeareth to reason and common sense is un∣derstood, (except such intellect as apprehend nothing either of rea∣son or sense, but that which is bea∣ten in to their skulls with apole∣axe) and whosoever alloweth this error must of necessity disa∣low of that forme of prayer for our daily bread, ordred by our Sa∣viour to be an inscience in him and a peece of Rebellion against
his aeternal Father in such a resi∣stance of his established will, as also all the divine prayers for the prolongation of life, and preser∣vation from danger, ordred by his Apostles and their successors, as also the dispensation of the guift of healing to the Phisitian. If all diseases and dissolutions of every knide be so imuiovably predesti∣nated as cannot admit of any re∣medy, or to what end or purpose did the almighty omniscient, crea∣te & honour the Phisitian, to ren∣der the reason will silence Mr. Speaker and both houses of Parlia∣ment, therefore under favour of more learned interpretors of lear∣ning in these poynts, I shall doe my own indeavour rationally to expurge this pernitious and intol∣lerable error concerning divine providence, and to this purpose, some thing concerning his caele∣stial
administration of universalls, are to be taken in to considera∣tion, and repeated, by which the dignity and eximious utillity of medicine may be more clearly de∣monstrated. That therefore the vicissitudes and actions of things and humane nature, are not by chance, but by the ordination of the Almighty, ought to be a prin∣ciple embraced by all Christian people, and that God is the omni∣potent and aeternall fabricator of the whole universe out of nothing as is affirmed by divine testimony, this aedifice beeing so powerfully erected is also by the same efficacy conserved, who hath also appoin∣ted to every created thing, both a beginning & end, or termination of subsisting and moving, and doth take notice not only of prin∣cipall but also of subsequent cau∣ses of things, as if that God did
governe, moderate, dispose and order them, according to his free will, and yet all this government is void of fatall violence, and most commonly commeth to effect, mediately, and from deputed cau∣ses, which vulgarly are nominated second causes, which the divine Majesty doth imploy as the in∣struments of his will, so long as he doth so governe all things vvhich he hath created, as also him selfe may suffer them to ex∣ercise their proper motions, for the vvill of man by divine ordina∣tion is the originall of humane actions, freely electing vvhat see∣meth best for it self (especially in externalls) and the nature of mo∣tion is the cause of this or an other thing in vvhich it is per se, accor∣ding to Aristotel as in the Sun per∣petuall rotation, and in grave and beavy bodyes their inclination to
their Center, and the causes so re∣spond the effects, as if the effects be necessary the causes are also neces∣sary, & if contingents, the causes are contingents, nor doth the prae∣science which is certaine & not to be deceaved, abolish the contin∣gency of naturall events, but the future effect is disposed as it were by a divine providence necessarily or contingently, nor doth it nul the freedome of the agent, nor is the creator obliged to the necessi∣ty, but moderateth al things frely according to his free wil and plea∣sure, as did evidently appear when he caused the sun to stand stil, or move retrograde the space of one compleat day, and caused the red Sea to divide and stand like firme wales, without either flux or re∣flux or any motion that wee read of, until the Israelites had passed over them, as also in the case of
Daniel, and the three children in the fiery furnace, and Duffus Mil∣columbus King of Scots who was most barberously murthered Anno Dom: 961. after which ac∣cording to their own history there was no apperance either of the Sun or moone for the space of six months, and though divine omnipotency can dispos of causes and life with every kind of death at his own free pleasure, yet it wil not urge any person to accept, that terme of life for a fatall determi∣nation, but for a divine ordination of servient causes and their natu∣ral power of sustaining or corrup∣ting life, for since life (according to the Phylosopher) is in its selfe but a duration of heat conjunct with moysture, which duration of vitall heat and extinction of the same are naturall effects, depen∣ding upon naturall causes, which
doubtlesse, because of the various disposition of internall heat and moysture, complicated which ex∣ternall causes, not only the quali∣ty, but also the quantety of life it selfe may be varied, for it doth ob∣teyn the internal conditiō of live∣ly principles, so long as the heat & moisture are so united in animals, that one is not destroyed or per∣turbed by the other so long they subsist, but either of them sepera∣ted each from the other perish, and in whom soever innate heat is more vegetious & strong, and ra∣dical moysture more pure in sub∣stance and exceeding in quantety, recipient of a just temper which is temperamentum ad justitia, in such life is more durable and perma∣nent, and if any inquiery shalbe made into causes of long life, in the fore-fathers to the years of nine hundred and more they wil
graunt the internall purety of principles to be the causes of such extension of life, and successively abreviated by time, in which mat∣ter suffiety decay, as not possessi∣ve of the prime purety, therefore in these ages the countesse of Des∣mond, and Thomas Parre are ex∣traordinarie exemples, for ordi∣narie old age is threescore & ten, if one climicterick more it must be effected by the extraordinary power & purity of radical princi∣ples: for radicall heat is the prin∣cipall agent of generation, in the liquid substance of seed and blood in the first conception, soone after renders it more dry, and delinea∣teth the rudiments of every mem∣ber, and by a farther siccity, doth publish the exact species, and after its production into the world, it doth bring it to perfection, and by the continuat efficiency of this
heat the parts are so exiccated a∣bove a moderate proportion, as doth render them lesse (if not una∣ble) to performe their proper fun∣ctions, by which there doth fol∣low a necessity of decay, and ex∣tinction of naturall heat, and this is a naturall death (according to-Galen) which by reason of ex∣tream siccity, and non nutrition, this naturall progresse to old age without any sense of payne vani∣sheth in a regular motion, from generation to corruption and de∣cay, and is unnaturall and vio∣lent when by any other internall, or external cause is extinct, be∣fore this naturall motion to ex∣treame old age which by a skil∣full order may be prolonged a∣gainst internal causes (except a depraved wil) which destroyeth many individuals which no reason can deny in capeable of extream
duration one story I remember of a discontented gallant which drowned himself, and being much lamented by the spectators for youthful comlinesse, amongst them was one of this erronious sect which was pleased to read a lectu∣re to them of the inevitable dicree of the Almighty and not by him to be avoided nor by them lamen∣ted, Ayong man (of the contrarie education) gave hir a great blow over the face, which made hir challeng him of base Cowardice, and as great incivillity to the fe∣menine sect, who returned hir in answer, that it was the in evitable will of God it should be so, and a truth according to hir own do∣ctrine, which caused hir to stagger in hir opinion leaving this digres∣sion, I must returne to my Phy∣losophicall discourse of heat and moisture, so united as waisteth no
otherwise then by their own natu∣ral motion with out disorderly in∣juries of physick or dyet, therfore doe proceed upon the simile of Hippocrates, by which he compa∣reth the life of man to a lamp or candel, preserved in a temperate place, free from any tempest in such a place the candel wil extend to the last sparke of fire or moistu∣re, otherwise by any tempestious or violent assault, of any kind it is extinguished before it be half li∣ghted, or if its halbe moved gently in a large (though not tempesti∣ous aire) yet that motion being more immoderate will cause it to blaze out some howers before o∣therwise it would in a temperate posture, the like injuries and prae∣ternaturall assaults to humane bo∣dies, are plagues, wounds and al o∣ther distempers, some peracutes suddainly extinguishing life, o∣thers
abreviating, & the least and mildest distemper obteineth such immoderate motion of spirits as in such a digre doth expend a por∣tion of natural heat and moisture, as doth according to that digree abreviate life, the first violence compelling nature suddainly to yeeld up all power of motion, the latter effecting the same cunctan∣do, I cannot but confesse, as mat∣ter admitteth generation, so is ther a compulsive necessitie of suf∣fering corruption nor can the heart be made moister being ex∣treamely excicated by its motion to old age, yet no sober spirit, can conceive it a point of wisedome or religion in a careless, negligent, or desperat way, to render up their being in this life, before an irrisi∣stable necessitie for this is like beasts to be led, or fooles to lead ourselves to slaughter, Thus have
I done my in deavour to clear this last objection & to discharge the fatality of mans life of all future quaestion, nor the extention of it by care and counsel to extreame old age, and by no such naturall meanes as wine, and if I should proceed further to every cercum∣stance conducible to the practicall part, it would be a work of long tyme which I cannot spare, and of exact judgement, wherein I could be content to receive directions, from guides more quick sighted and learned then my selfe. That which I have now written is ac∣cording to my own reason and de∣sire, to give more satisfaction to the world concerning the use of this vinose subject, which hath been doubtful and in al ages quae∣stionable, both in respect of the life of man, whether or not it may be extended, or whether it be ex∣tensible
as also in respect of wine, whether their proper nature be so extending, as in all the former di∣course hath been my laboure to demonstrate, by arguments both a priore & a posteriore, and by such argumentatiō to in counter those fantastick sculs, that either can∣not, or will not conceive the me∣decinal art, to be established upon any other ground (except conje∣cture) and that the best conjecture is the best Physitian, not under∣standing that pathognomik sym∣tomes demonstrate the affect, as plainly as any other shadow doth either man or beast, none that hath eyes will take the shaddow of man for a horse, nor of an oxe, for a rhinosoros, or a lyon, for a bear, to such as these I doe not di∣rect this my Phylosophy, nor can I conceive where there are such infinities of faces, their should
not also be a varietie of opinions, therefore I cannot hope to satisfy every fancy nor doe I intend to be understood of the vulgar, but leav my justification to the naturall sonnes of art, and to such are these my indeavours presented, an obla∣tion after the manner of those di∣vote children, which where accu∣stomed once every year to offer a sacrifice to Iupiter, but at the ac∣customed time being by an inex∣pected inundatiō prevented, both of their altar and Sacrefice, instead of a beast, they offred a lemon which Iupiter accepted in that ne∣cessitious condition, so also those that have read my precedent Tract of waters, cannot conceive my head free from washing, nor my braynes from such inundation, as consequently may not dilute my wine and render it more weak and impure, yet if my devotion may
be acceptable to Iupiter, let it be blest to the world, and where as (like the dogg of Hercules) I have be smeered my lips with the Crimson juce of the grape, other Herculian braines, may vent it in more pure, and plentifull in sub∣stance and measure, by which eve∣ry sense shalbe refreshed, every capacity filled, and every intellect really delighted.
