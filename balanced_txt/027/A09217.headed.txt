THE PREFACE. IN Pablis town sum tyme as I heard ell, The formest day of Februare befell: Thrie Preists went vnto collatioun, Into ane priuie place of the said toun▪ Quhair that they sat richt soft and vnfutesair, Thay luifit not na rangald nor repair. And gif I sall the suith reckin and say, I traist it was vpon Sanct Bryds day. Quhair that thay sat ful easilie and soft, With monie lowd lauchter vpon loft: And wit ʒe weil thir thrie thay maid gude cheir, To them thair was na dainteis than too deir With thrie sed capns on a speit with creishe, With monie vher sindrie dyuers meis: And them to serue thay had nocht bot a boy, Fra cumpanie thay keipit them sa coy, Thay lufit nocht with lary nor with lown, Nor with trumpours to trauel throw the town: Bot with them self quhat thay wald tel or crak, Vmquhyle sadlie, vmquyle jangle and jak. Thus sat thir thrie besyde ane feln fyre, Quhil thair capons war roisic lim and lyre: Befoir thm was sone see a Roundel bricht, And with ane clene claith fynelie dicht. It was ouirset and on it bre was laid, The eldest than began the grace and said And blissit the breid with Benedicee, With Dominus Amen, sa mot I the. And be thay had drunken about a quarte, Than spak ane thus that Maister was in Arte: And to his name thair callit Iohne was he. And said senwe ar heir Preists thrie, Syne wans nocht be him that maid the Mone, Til vs wee think ane tail sould cum in tune: Than spak ane other to name hecht M. Archebald,
Now be the hiest Heuin quod he I hal. To tel ane tailm think I sould not tyre, To hald my fute  of this fellou fyre. Than spak the thrid to name hecht S. Williame To grit clargie I can not count nor clame. Nor ʒit I am not trauellt as ar ʒe, In monie sundrie Land beʒond the See. Thairfoir me think it nouther shame nor sin, Ane of ʒow twa the first ail to begin. Heir I prest than spk. maister Archebald, Ane taul it Clark suppois I be cald: Presumpteouslie I think not to presume, As I that was neuer trauellit bot to Rome. To tel ane tail bot eirar I suppone, The first tail tald mot be Maister Iohne: For he hath bene in monie vncouth Land, In Portingale and in Ciuile the grand. In fyue kinrikis of Spane al hes he bene, In foure christin and ane heathin I wene: In Rome Flanders and in Venice toun, And vther Lands sundrie vp and doun. And for that he spak first of ane tail, Thairfoir to begin he sould not fall. Than speiks Maister Iohne now be the Rude, Me to begin ane tail sen ʒe conclude: And I deny than had I sair offendit. The thing begun, the soner it is endit. The first taill tald be Maister Iohne. A King thair was sumtyme and eik a Queene As monie in the Land befoir had bene: This King gar set ane plane Parliament, And for the Lords of his kinrik sent: And for the weilfair of his Realme and gyde, The thrie Estaits concludit at that tyde▪ The King gart cal to his Palice al thrie, The Estaits ilkane in thair degrie. The Bishops first with Prelats and Abbottis,
With thair Clarks seruants and Varlottis: Into ane hall was large richt hie and hugde, Thir Prelats all richt lustelie couth ludge. Syne in ane hal ful fair farrand, He ludgit al the Lords of his Land, Syne in ane Hal was vnder that ful clene, He har bourit al his Burgessis rich and bene Sa of thir thrie Estaits al and sum, In thir thrie Hals he gart the wysest cum, And of thair mery cheir quhat mak I mair, Thay fuir als weil as onie folk micht fair. The King himself come to this Burgessis bene. And thir words to them carps I wene And says welcum Burgessis my beld and blis, Quhen ʒe fair weil I may na mirths mis. Quhen that ʒour ships halds hail and sound, In riches, gudes and weilfair I abound: Ze ar the caus of my lyfe and my cheir, Out of far Lands ʒour Marchandice cums heir. Bot ane thing is for short the cause quy, Togidder heir ʒow gart cum haue I. To ʒow I haue ane questioun to declair, Quhy Burges bairns thryues not to the thrid air. Bot casts away it that thair eldars wan, Declair me now this questioun gif ʒe can. To ʒow I gif this questioun al and sum, For to declair againe the morne I cum. Vnto his Lords than cumen is the King, Dois glaidlie al he said baith ald and ʒing, My lustie Lords my Leiges and my lyfe, I am in sturt quhen that ʒe ar in stryfe. Quhen ʒe haue peace and quhn ʒe haue plesance, Than I am glade and derflie may I dance, And heid dow not on bodie stand allane, For out members to be of micht and mane. For to vphald the bodie and the heid, And sickerlieto gar it stand in steid. Thairfoir my Lords and my Barrouns bald, To me al hail ʒe ar help and vphald.
And now I will ʒe wit with diligence, Quhairfoir that I gart cum sik confluence: And quhy ʒe Lords of my Parliament, I haue gart cum I will tel my intent. Ane questioun I haue ʒe mon declair, That in my minde is euer mair and mair: Quhairfoir and quhy and quhat is the cais, Sa worthie Lords war in myne elders dayis, Sa full of fredome worship and honour, Hardie in hart to stand in euerie stour: And now in ʒow I find the hail contrair, Thairfoir th dout and questioun ʒe declair: And it declair vnder the hiest pane, The morne this tyme quhen that I cum agane. THAN till his Clergie came this nobil King, Welum Bishops he said with my blissing: Welcum my bedmen, my blesse and al my beild, To me ʒe ar baith Helmes Speir and Scheild. For richt as Moyes stude vpon the Mont, Prayand to God of Heuin as he was wont, And richt sa y ʒour deuoit Orisoun, Myne enemies lould put to confusioun. Ze ar the gamest gat and gyde to God, Of al my Realme ʒe ar the reul and rod: It that ʒe do me think it sould be done, Quhen that ʒe shrink I haue ane sunʒe sone. Thus be ʒow ay ane eample men tais, And as ʒe say than al and sundrie sayis: It that ʒe think richt or ʒit ressoun, To that can I nor na man haue chessoun. And that ʒe think vnressoun or wrang, Wee al and sundrie sings the sam sang: Bot ane thing is I wald ʒe vnderstude, The cause into this place for to conclude. Quhairfoir and quhy I gart ʒow hidder , My Clargie and my Clarks al ad sum: To ʒow I haue na vther tail nor theame, Ecept and to ʒow Bishops a probleame. Quhilk is to me ane questioun and dout,
Out of my mynd I wald ʒe put it out▪ That is to say quhairfoir and quhy, In auld tymes and dayes of ancestry. Sa monie Bishops war and men of Kirk, Sa grit wil had ay gude warkes to wirk: And throw thair prayers maid to God of micht, The dum men spak, the Blind men gat yair sicht. The Deif men heiring, the Crukit gat tair feit, War nane in bail, bot weill thay culd them beit. To seik folks or into sairnes syne, Til al thay wald be mendis and medicyne. And quahairfoir now in ʒour tyme ʒe warie, As they did than▪ quhairfoir sa may not ʒe, Quhairfoir may not ʒe as thay did than, Declair me now this questioun gif ʒe can. To the Burgessis. VPON the morne efter seruice and meat, The King came in and sat doun in his sait: Into the Hal amang the Burges men, With him ane Clark with ink paper and pen. And bad them that thay sould foroutin mair, His questioun reid assolʒe and declair: And the Burgessis that this questioun weil knew, Hes ordaned ane wyse man and ane trew. The question to reid foroutin fail, And he stude vp, and this began his tail. The ansvveir to the first questioun. EXCELLENT hie richt michty prince & King, Zour Hienes heir wald faine wit of this thing: Quhy Burges bairnis thryuis not to the thrid air Can neuer thryue bot of al baggis is bair. And euer mair that is for to say, It that thair Eldars wan thay cast away: This questioun declair ful weill I can, Thay begin not quhair thair fathers began. Bot with ane hiely hart baith daft and derft, Thay ay begin quhair that thair fathers left: Of this mater largelie to speik mair, Quhy that thay thryue not to the thrid air.
Becaus thair fathers purelie can begin, With hap and halfpenny and a Lambs skin: And purelie ran fra town to town on feit, And than richt oft weshod werie and weit. Quhilk at the last of manie smals couth mak, bonte pedder ane gude fute pak▪ At ilkane fair this chopman ay was fund, Quhil that his pak was with fourtie pund. To beir his pak quhen that he faillit force, He bocht ful sone ane mekil stalwart hors: And at the last so worthelie vp wan, He bocht ane Cart to carie Pot and Pan: Baith Flanders Coffers with Counters and Kist He wox a grund rich man or onie wist. And syne vnto the town to sel and by, He held a chop to sel his chaffery, Than bocht he wol and wyselie couth it wey, And efter that sone saylit he the Sey: Than come he hame a verie potent man, And spousit syne a michtie wyfe richt than. He saylit ouer the Sey sa oft and oft, Quhil at the last ane semelie ship he coft. And wor sa ful of warldis welth and win, His hands he wish in ane siluer Basin. Forout gold or siluer into hurde, With thrie thowsand pund was his Copburde: Riche was his gowms with vther garments gay, For Sonday silk for ilk day grene and gray. His wyfe was cumlie cled in Scarlet reid, Scho had na dout of derth of Ail nor breid. And efter that within a twentie ʒeir, His Sone gat vp ane stalwart man and steir▪ And efter that this Burges we of reid, Deit as we mon do al indeid. And fra he was deid than come his sone, And enterit in the welth that he had wone. He steppit not his steps in the streit, To win this welth nor for it was he weit. Quhen he wald sleip he wantit not a wink,
Fra thay be al puir that ar them vnder, Thocht thay be puir, ʒour Lords is na wonder: For ritch Husbands and tennants of grit micht, Helps ay thair Lords to hald thair richt. And quhen ʒour Lords ar puir this to conclude, Thay selthair Sonnes aud aires for gold & gude. Vnto ane mokrand Carle for derest pryse, That wist neuer ʒit of honour nor gentryse. This worship and honour of linage, Away it weirs thus for thair disparage: Thair manheid and thair mense this gait thay murle For Mariage thus vnyte of ane churle. The quhilk wist neuer of gentrice na honour, Of fredome, worship, vassalage nor valour. This is the caus dreidles for without in dout, Fra al ʒour Lords how honour is al out. And thus my Lords bade me to ʒow say, How honour, fredome and worship is away. THAN spak the King ʒour conclusion is quaint And thair atour ʒe mak to vs a plaint: And in ʒour sentence thus ʒe meine to say, Leil men ar hurt and theifis gets away. And thus me think ʒe meine justice is smuird, Zour tennants and ʒour leill husbands ar puird, And quhan that thay ar , tan ar ʒe pure, The quhilk to ʒow is baith charge and cure. That ʒe for gold aith wed and wage, Ze sel ʒour Sones and aires Mariage: To cairls of kynde and bot for thair riches, In quhom is na nurture nor nobilnes. Fredome, worship, manheid nor honour, The quhilk to vs and ʒow is dishonour. In same kil thus shortlie I conclude, As ʒe that ar discendand of our blude. For the quhilk thing I will ʒe vnderstand, With Gods grace wee tak it vpon hand: To se for this as ressoun can remeid, In tyme to cum thairof thair be na pleid. With our justice thair salpas ane Doctour,
That lufis God his saul and our honour: The quhilk salbe aue Doctour in the Law, That sal the faith of veritie well knaw. And fra hence furth he sal baith heir and se▪ Baith theif puneist and leil men liue in lie. For weil I wait thair can be na war thing, Than Coueyce in Iustice or in King. Efter this tail in vs ʒe sal not taint, Nor ʒit of our Iustice to mak ane plaint: And afterward sa did this King but chessoun▪ On him micht na man plenʒie of ressoun. Syne had his Clark but onie variance. Wrte this in his Buik of rememberance. THAN to the Clergie came this nobill King, Of his questioun to heir the absoluing. And thay as men of wisdome in al wark▪ Had laid thair speich vpon ane cunning Clark. The quhilk in vaine in scule had not tane grie, In al science seuin he was ane Aper se: And in termes short and sece fair, The questioun began for to declair. That is to say quhairfoir and quhy, In auld tymes and dayes of ancestry. Sa monie Bishops war and men of Kirk, Sa grit wil hd ay gude warkes to wirk: And throw thair prayers maid to God of micht, The dum men spak, the Blind men gat yair sicht. The Deif men heiring, the Crukit gat thair feit, Was nane in bail, bot weil thay could them beit. And quhairfoir now al that cuir can warie, Me think ʒe mene quhairfoir sa may not we: And thus it is ʒour quodlibet and dout, Ze gaue to vs to reid and gif it out. The ansvver to the third question. THIS is the caus richt michtie King at short, To ʒour Hienes as we sal thus report: The Lawit folkes this Law wald neuer ceis, Bot with thair vse quhen Bishops war to cheis. Vnto the Kirk thay gadred auld and ʒing,
With meik hart fasting aud praying: And prayit God with words not in waist. To send them wit doun be the halie Gaist. Quhan them amang was onie Bishop deid, To send to them ane Bishop in his steid. And ʒit amang vs ar fund wayis thrie, To cheis ane Bishope after ane vther die: That is to say the way of the halie Gaist, Quhilk takin is of micht and vertew maist. The second is be way of Electioun, Ane Persone for to cheis of perfectioun: In that Cathederal Kirk and in that se, In place quhair that Bishope suld chosen be. And gif thair be nane abil thair that can, That office weil steir, quhat sal thay than? Bot to the thrid way to ga for thi, Quhilk is callit (via scrutiui.) That is to say in al the Realme and Land, Ane man to get for that office gainand: Bot thir thrie wayis withoutin ony pleid, Ane sould we cheis after ane vthers deid. Bot sit now the contrair wee find, Quhilk puts al our heauines behind: Now sal thair nane of thir wayis thrie, Be chosen now ane Bishope for to be. Bot than ʒour micht and Majestie wil mak, Quhat euer he be to loife or ʒit to lak: Than heyly to sit on the Rayne-bow, Thir Bishops cums in at the North window, And not in at the dur nor ʒit at the ʒet. Bot ouer Waine and Quheil in wil he get: And he cummis not in at the dur, God pleuch may neuer hald the fur. He is na Hird to keip thay sely sheip, Nocht bot ane Tod in ane Lambskin to crēip: How sould be kyth mirakil and he sa euil, Neuer bot bythe dysmel or the Deuil: For now on dayes is nouther riche nor pure, Sal get ane Kirk al throw his literature.
For science for vertew or for blude, Gets nane the Kirk, bot baith for gold and gude. Thus greit excellent ing the halie Gaist, Out of ʒour men of gude away is chaist. And war not that doutles I ʒow declair, That now as than, wald hail baith seik and sair. Sic wickednes this world is within, That Symonie is countit now na sin. And thus is the caus baith al and sum, Quhy blind men sicht, na heiring gets na dum. And thus is the caus the suich to say, Quhy halines fra kirkmen is away. Than quod the King, weil vnderstand I ʒow, And heir to God I mak ane aith and vow: And to my Crown and to my Cuntrie to. With Kirk-gude sal I neuer haue ado. I to dispone to lytil or to large, Kirk men to kirk, se thay haue al the charge: Than had this nobil King lang tyme and space, And in his tyme was mekil luk and grace. His Lords honour it him efter thair degrie, The Husbands peice had and tranquilitie. The Kirk was frie quhil he was in his lyfe, The Burges Sones began than for to thryfe. And efter lang was neuer king more wyse, And leuit and deit, and endit in Gods seruise. And than spak al that fellowship but fail, God and Sanct Martyne quyte ʒow of ʒour tail. And than spak Maister Archebald fallis me, Gude tail or euil, quhider that euer it be: Thus as I can I sal it tel but hyre, To hald my fute out of this felloun fyre. The second taill tald be M. Archebald. A King thair was sumtyme and eik a Queene, As monie in the Land befoir had bene: The king was fair in persoun fresh and fors, Ane feirie man on fute or ʒit on hors. And neuertheles feil falts him befell,
Hee luifit ouer weil ʒong counsel: Zong men he luifit to be him neist, Zong men to him thay war baith Clark & Preist. Hee luifit nane was old or ful of age, Sa did he nae of sad counsel nor sage. To sport and play quhyle vp & quhylum doun, To al lichtnes ay was he redie boun. Sa ouir the Sey, cummin thair was a Clark, Of greit science, of voyce, word and wark, And bressit him with al his besynes, Thus with this king to mak his recidens. Weil saw he with this kiag micht na man byde, Bot thay that wald al sadnes set on syde. With club and bel and partie cote with eiris, He feinʒeit him ane fule fond in his feiris. French, Dutche and Italie ʒit als, Weil could he speik and Latine feinʒe fals. Vnto the kirk he came befoir the king, With club and cote and monie bel to ring. Dieu gard sir king, I did nocht hald in hiddil, I am to ʒow als sibas seif is to ane riddil, Betwit vs twa mot be als mekil grace, As frost and snaw fra Zule is vnto Pace. Watt ʒee how the Frenche man sayis syne, Nul bon he sayis monsieur sans pyne. With that he gaue ane loud lauchter on loft, Honour and eis, sir quha may haue for nocht. Cum on thy way sir king, now for Sanct Iame, Thow with me, or I with the gang hame. Now be sant Katherine quod the king and smyld, This fule hes monie wauer and word and wyld, Cum hame with mee thow sal haue drink ynouch. Grand mercy quod the fuill agane and leuch. Now quod the king fra al dulnes and dule, Wee may vs keip, quhil that wee haue this fuil, He feinʒeit him a fuil in deid and word, The wyser man the better can he bourd. Quhil at the last this fuil was callit alway, Fuil of fuiles, and that ilk man wald say.
Thus was this fuil ay stil with the King, Quhil he had weil considderit in al thing. The conditions, vse, maner and the gyse, And coppyie weil the king on his best wyse: Sa fel it on a day this nobil king, Vnto ane Cietie raid for his sporting, This fuil persauit weil the King wald pas, Vnto ane vther Cietie as it was: He tuke his club aud ane bable in his hand, For to preuene the tyme he was gangand. Sa be the way ane woundit man faude he, And with this fuil war runners twa or thrie, Sum of the Court and sum of the kitchene, And saw ane man but Leiche or Medycene. Sa sair woundit micht nouther ga nor steir, At him this fuil can al the caus speir: He answered and said reuer and theif, Thou hes me hurt and brocht me in mischeif. With that his wounds war fillit ful of fleis, As euer in byke thair biggit onie beis: Than ane of them that had pitie can pray▪ That he mot skar thay felloun fleis away. Than spak the fuil and said lat them be now man▪ For thay ar ful the hunger wil cum than: For thir dois nocht bot sits as thou may se, For thay ar als ful as thay may be. Be thir away it is euil and na gude, The hungrie fleis wil cum and souk his blude: The ofter that thir fleis away be chaist, The new fleis wil mair of his blude waist. And draw his blude and souk him syne sa sair, Thairfoir lat them allane, skar them na wair: The sair man him beheld and im he demes, And said he was not sik a fuil as he semes. Sone after that ane lytil came the King, With monie man can gladelie sport and sing. Ane cow of birks into his hand had he, To keip than weil his face fra midge and fle. For than war monie fleand vp and doun,
Throw kynd of ʒeir and hait of that Regioun▪ Sa lukit he ane lytill by the way, He saw the woundit man quhair that he lay: And to him came he rydand and can fraine, Quat ailit him to ly and fairly graine The man answered I haue sik sturt, For baith with theif and reuer I am hurt And ʒit suppois I haue all the pyne, The falt is ʒowris sir King and nathing myne. For and with ʒow gude counsal war ay cheif Than wald ʒe stanche weill baith reuer and theif, Haue thow with the that can weil dance and ng Thow taks nocht thocht yi realme weip & wrīg With that the King the bob of birks can waue, The fleis away out of his woundis to haue: And than began the woundit man to grane, Do nocht sa sir allace I am slane. How sayis thow, thow tel me quod the King, Quhy thow sayis sa I ferly of this thing: And sa said al his men that stude about, Thow wald be haill and thay war chasit out The sair can say be him that can vs saue Your fule sir King hes mair wit than ʒe haue. And weil I ken be his phisomie, He hes mair wit nor al ʒour cumpanie. My tung is sweir my bodie hes na strenth, Frane at ʒour fule he can tel ʒow at lenth: I am but deid and I may speik na mair, Adew sir, for I haue said weil mot ʒe fair. Fra this sair man now cummin is the King, Hauand in mynd greit murmure and mouing: And in his hart greit hauines and thocht, Sa wantonly in vane al thing he wrocht. And how the Cuntrie throw him was misfarne, Throw ʒong counsel and wrocht ay as abarne. And ʒit as he was droupand thus in dule, Of all and al he fer lett of his fule. Quhat kynde of man this fuil with him sould be, And quhat this sair man be this fuil micht se.
And quhat it is the caus quhairfoir and quhy, He was wyser than all his cumpany. Quhan cummin was the king to that Citie, Full fast than for his fule frainit he. And quhan the king was set doun to his meit Vnto his fuill gart mak ane semely seit: Ane Rowndell with ane cleine claith had he, Neir quhair the king micht him baith heir and se Than quod the king a lytill wie and leuch, Sir fuill ʒe ar lordly set aneuch: Quhan ʒe ar ful quhat call thay ʒow and how, Sa hamely as ʒe ar with me now. Sir to my Name thay call me fule Fictus, Befoir ʒow as ʒe may se me sit thus: And of this Cuntrie certes am I borne, With luck and grace and Fortoun me beforne: Schir fuill tell me gif that ʒe saw this day, Ane woundit manly granand by the way. Ze sir forsuith sik ane man couth I sie, And in his wound was monie felloun flie: Now quod the king sir fuill to me ʒe say. Quhy skarrit ʒe not thay flies all away: Thocht ʒe it was ane deid of charitie, In seik mans wound for to leif ane flie, Sir trow me weill full suith it is I say, Better was stil thay fleis than skarrit away. For gif sa be the fleis away ʒe skar, Than efter them cums hungriar be far. Thairfoir war better let them be but dout, For the full fleis hals the hungrie out. The hungry flie that neuer had bene tahir, Scho souks the mans wound sa wonder sair: And quhen the fleis ar ful than byde thay stil, And stops the hungrie beis to cum thairtil. Bot sir allace me think sa do not ʒe, Ze ar sa licht and ful of vanitie, And sa weil ufis al new things to persew, That ilk sessioun ʒe get ane seruant new. Quhat wil the ane now say vnto the vther,
Now steir thy hand myne awin deir brother: Win fast be tyme and be nocht lidder, For wit thou weil Hal binks ar ay slidder. Thairfoir now quhither wrang it be or richt, Now gadder fast quhil we haue tyme and micht. Se na man now to the King erand speik, Bot gif wee get ane bud or ellis we sal it breik. And quhan thay ar full of sic wrang win, Thay get thair leif and hungryar cums in: Sa sharp ar thay and narrowlie can gadder, Thay pluck the puir as thay war powand Hadder. And taks buds fra men baith neir and far, And ay the last ar than the first far war: Iustice, Crounar sariand and justice clark, Remoues the auld and new men ay thay mark. Thus fla thay all the puir men belly flaucht, And fra the puir taks many felloun fraucht: And steirs them and wait the tyde wil gang, Syne efter that far hungrier cums than. And thusgait ay the puir folk ar at vnder, This World to sink for sin quhat is it wonder? Thairfoir now be this exampil wee may se, That ane new seruant is lyke ane hungrie fle. Than quod the King quhat say ʒe to ou fule, Suppois that he had bene ane Clath at scule. To God now quod the King I mak ane ow, Ze ar not sik ane fule as ʒe let ʒow: Thus wonderit al the King that sat about, And of this fule had frly dreid and dout. Thoche he was fule in Habite in al feiris, Ane wyser sperk thay hard neuer with thair . Thus ferlyit al thair was baith he and he, Quhat maner of ane thing micht this be. And lyke to ane was nocht into Rome, Zit than his word was ful of al wisdome. For he as fule began guckit and gond, And ay the wyser man nerar the end: And thus the ing and al his cumpany,
Vpon this fuil had wonder and ferly. Of the slaying of the man. SYNE efter this ane Gentelman percace, Had slane ane man al throw his raklesnes: And to the Court he come and tald this thing, Vnto ane man was inward with the King. And said sir lo, I am in the Kings grace, That hes ane man slane in my fault a lace. And wil ʒe gar the King to that consent, For it I sal ʒow pay and concent. This Coueteour held on this to the king, And tald him al this tail to the ending. And than the king for his lufe and instance, Bad bring the man that happened that mischance Vnto the king his tail quhen he had tald, Ful sharplie to this man he could behald, Ane semely man of mak sa semit he, To say that man he thocht ane greit pitie: And bad him passe quhair he lykit to ga, And be gude man and efter slay na ma. Sone efter that within half a ʒeir, Ane vther man he slew withouttin weir. Of the second slayne man. THAN to the Court he cummin is agane, Vnto this man befoir his gold had tane: And said sir I haue saue allace, Ane vther man throw misfortune and cace: And wald ʒe help me befoir as ʒe haue done, Ane sowme of siluer ʒe sould haue ful sone. Another sowme I sall giue to the king, Me hartlie to forgiue into this thing. Help me now for Gods awin deid, Nane vther buit at ʒow bot I get remeid. This Courteour him answered thus agane, This deid to do I am vncertane. Quhen that thow slew bot ane throw racklesnes, Of that thow micht haue gotten forgiuenes, Sa may it nocht quhen thow hes slane thus twa, Notwithstanding I wil for the ga.
The for to help I sal get sik assay, And for the do alsmekil as I may. Vnto the king than come this Courteour, And lukit weil baith to his tyme and hour. He lukit quhan the King was blyth and glad, And nocht quhen he was heauie nor sad▪ Ful lawlie sat h doun vpon his kne, Lo sir he said, ane thing of greit pitie: The man that ʒe forgaue syne halfe ane ʒeir, Another man now hes he slane but weir. Ane certane sowme of gold thus sal ʒe get, And ʒe wald all ʒour crabitnes forʒet. He wepes and he sichs now sa sair, That he sik misse will efter do na mair. In all ʒour Realme thair is na wichter man, Greit pitie is it for t tyne him than. Ze may him haue and of his gold and geir. He will stand ʒow in steid in tyme of weir, Suppois he hes slane twa better it is that ʒe, Haue twa men slane than thus for to sla thrie. Thairfoir heir I beseik ʒow in this cace, That ʒe wald tak him in ʒour gudelie grace. The King bad than bring him to his presence, And him forgaue all fault and offence. And bad him ga and do sik misse na mair, Thus tuke this man his leif and hame can fair. Syne efterward this man that wee off reid, The thrid man hes he slane ʒic in deid. Of the thride slayne man. THAN to the Court agane maid his repair, Sik grace to get agane as he did air: Sa come hee to the Courteour to tell, His fortoun and his cace how it befell. This courteour to speik wald not spair, For ʒow forsuith sir dar I speik na mair. Sa oft and oft ʒe haue done sik mischeif, I dar not speikit to king for greif, Now be my saul and sa not I do weill, Is na remeid als far as I can feill.
Or quhither that ʒe sal liue the Land allace, Or put ʒow ʒit into the Kings grace. This Courteour agane vnto the King, Now cummin is and tald hail this thing: And how the man befoir the twa had slane, The thrid man thus hes he slane agane. With that the King quhen that he hard the taill, In grit greif than wox he wan and pail. And sweith he said bring him now heir to me, Sal neyther gold nor gude let him to die. Get he my pitie than God put me out of mynde, And he wald gif me all the Golden Inde: Syne gait he bring to him the samyn man, Set dotin to Iudge to Heid or to Hang. This man that was sa cumbred of this cace, On kneis fel and askit the Kings grace The King plainly all grace can him deny, And tald to him the caus and ressoun quhy. With that vpon ane lytil bony stule, Sat Fictus that was the Kings fule. And said now and ʒe gar not Heid or Hang, This man for them that he slew it war wrang. The first man weil I grant he slew, The vther twa in faith them slew ʒow. Had tho him puneist quhan he slew the first, The vther twa had bene leuand I wist. Thairfoir allace this tail sir is ouer trew, For in gude faith the last twa men ʒe slew. Blessit ar thay that keips Iudgement and Iustice, &c. THE Psalmes sayis Dauid wa and wyse, Blist mot thay be that keips Law and Iustice. Thairfoir I wald that ʒe sould not presume, Na to haue count vpon the day of Dome. For mans body thair to giue ane ʒeild, Quhome to ʒe sould be sickar Speir and sheild▪ Of all the Realme quhom off ʒe beir the Cronn, Of lawit and leirit, riche pure, vp and doun. The quhilk and thay be slane with mans hand, Ane count thairof ʒe sall gif I warrand.
Lesse than it be throw sum grit negligence, Quhairin his mercy or in his defence: And on the day of Dome be Sance Paull, The Bishops mon ay answer for the Saull. Gif it be lost for fault of Preist or preiching, Of the richt treuth it haif na chesing. In sa far as the Saull is for thy, Far worthier is than the blait body: Many Bishops in ilk Realme wee se, And bot ane King into ane Realme to be. Thus hes the Saull mair wark and cure, Than the body that is of na valure. Be this was said the King sayis wa is mee, For I am fule of fules weill I see, I se weill I haue lytil part of scule, That thus sould be informit with ane fule. I se weil be this taill this fule can tel, That I had greitly neid of wyse counsell. To send for all my Lords I consent, I desyre this to be in Parliament. And it be trew my fule hes said me heir, I sal weil rewaird him withouttin weir: And be it fals and ful of fantasy, Ane fule he is and fule him hald sal I. And throw this fule this man-slayer did get, Vnto the Parliament perfyte respet: And efter quhan thir Lords al can cum, Vnto this Parliament baith al and sum: Be al the thrie Estaits it was found, Considderand al the mater crop and ground, This Fictus that was callit the fule, Was wyse in word thcht he was Clark inscule, The King bad al the thrie Estaits that thay, Sould sit doun al and sie a ganand way: Quhat man in hous war meit with him to dwell, Of wisdome for to gif him counsel: And for to mak be his Estaits thrie, Into this Realme concordant vnitie. And quhen that al this deid was dewlie done,
The King sweit be his Sceptour and his Croun▪ That he sould neuer gif mercie to nane, That slauchter in his Realme committit than. Aganis his will bot throw his negligence, Or ellis that it be fund in his defence. And lik ane rewl maid he into his Land, That luck and grace in it was ay growand. And than this nobill King all lichtnes left, All bot ane thing that was not fra him reft: The quhilk for ill toungs lang had bene, Ane stit strangnes betwixt him and his Queene. He beddit nocht richt oft nor lay hir by, Bot throw lichtnes did lig in Lamenry. SA happenit throw cace into the Toun, Vnto ane Burges Iuins he maid him boun, Ane lytill wie befoir the feist of Zule, In cumpanie bot fyue sum and his fule, This Burges had ane dochter to him deir, Ane bonie wenche sho was withouttin weir. The King on hir he casts his lustie Eine, And with hit faine wald in ane bed haif bene: Hee wist full weill that nane had hee, That was sa subtill as Fictus was and flee. Hee callit him and priuilie can say, Sik fantesie hes put me in effray: I am sa ful of lust and fantesy, With this Modyn on benk that sits me by▪ For gold, for gude, for wage or ʒit for wed, This nicht I wald haue hir to my bed. Than quod the fuill I vnderstand ʒow weill, I tak on hand to do it euerie deill. Sit still now sir wil ʒe let me allane, Be mee this eirand sall be vndertaue. Sone efter quhan thay war at sport and play, The fule came to this bonie pretie may, And said Madyn wist ʒe of the degrie, How plesant it is to God virginitie: Tak exampill S. Margaret and Katrine, And moe vther Sats that ar sine:
In Heuins blesse that hes sik joy and grie▪ With Croun on heid for thair Virginitie. I wait for all the gold into this toun, Of Madynheid ʒe wald not tyne the Croun. Bot ay the king wont he had besie bene, Of the mater that was thir twa betwene, And to the Virgine ʒong thus spak the king, Quhat my fule sayis I trow be na lesing: Sir quod sho his saw was suffisand, And as he sayis I sall do God willand. Be that the kings Stewart cummin is, To haue the king to his supper I wis. The king said to his fule in priuetie, Of the eirand Fictus how sal it be. Now hard ʒe not hirself consent thairto, That as I said to ʒow sho hecht to do. Bot ane thing haue I hecht sickerly, That nane sal cum about hir sir bot I: The Virgine is bot ʒong and thinks shame, And is full laith to cum in ane ill name: And quhan the kings supper was at end, Fictus the fule vnto the Queene can wend. And to hir said do my counsel Madame, To ʒow it sall be nouther sin nor shame: A Burges dochter to hir Father deir, This nicht the king thinks to haue but weir: And tald hir all the cace and maner how, Hir for to haue he gart the King weil trow. Bot that be God that with his blude vs boht, With hir to gar him sin was neuer my thocht: The King commands to his cheif Chalmerlane, Quhan euer I cum with hir I be in tane. And in his bed sal priuely in creip. Quhil that the king sal cum thair and sleip. And priuely thus be the day agane, Away with me the Madyn sal be tane. Thairfoir Madame for God be not agast, About ʒour heid ʒour cloke clenlie cast: Quhairfoir sould ʒe dout or be a dred,
Is nane bot ʒe sould bruik the Kings bed: The warst may fall suppose it wittin war, Me thocht he hang ʒow wil he neuer skar. And thus is my counsel Madame ʒe do, In faith quod sho and I consent thairto: All thus and thus befoir as ʒe haue hard, The Queene is brocht vnto the kings bed. The quhilk all nicht in vthers armes lay, Quhat man to tel of al thair sport and play: The king thocht neuer nicht to him sa short, Sa lykit he that nichts play and sport. And on the morne a lytil befoir day, The Fule come in and tuke the Quene away. And thus and thus efter nichts thrie, With his awin Queene grit gaming had & glie And weil he wend that it had bene but weir, That with him lay the Burges dochter deir. Quhome throw he had sik joy and sik plesance, Quhilk maid him ay the Fule for to auance: Sa was the King sa amorat of his Fule, Besyde himself ay sat vpon a stule. Was neuer ʒit mair joy and plesance sene, Than the king hes in bed with his awin Queene: And that was na grit ferly to befal, For sho was fair and gude and ʒong with al. And thus the Fule quhen he persauing had. How that the king sa joyful was and glade: Vnto the king he came in priuitie, And said now sir ane thing that ʒe tel me▪ Quhair foir it is the cace fane wit wald I, Quy that ʒe haue in ʒow sik fantasy: To ly with wemen and of law degrie▪ Aganis ʒour Quens wil and Majestie. Considder and weil that sho is fair and gude, With ilkane vther bewtie to conclude. Or quhy at hir ʒe haue al this dispyte, And quhy ʒe find in vthers sik delyte. Or quhat plesance ʒe had thir nichts thrie, With ʒour awin Queene in bed than mair to be.
The King answered and said now sikarly, I can not tel the ressoun caus nor quhy: Ficcus my fule with the na mair to flyte, Bot wantonly ay followes my appetyte. And quhan that my delyte is vpon vther, Thau mony folk wil cum and with me fludder. And sum wil tel il ailes of the Queene, The quhilk be hir war neuer hard nor sene. And that I do thay say al weil is done, Thus fals clutterars puts me out of tone. And thus becaus I am licht of feirs, And heirs euil tailes and lichtly lendis my eiris, And thus of hir I haue na appetyte, And of al others ay haue I grit delyte. Sir quod the fule wil ʒe not consent, Thir thrie nichts that ʒe war weil content: Ze that I grant be God that is of micht, Had neuer nane mair plesance on the nicht. God quod the King sen my fortoun had bene, Sen sho I had thir nichts thrie war Queene. Quhat wil ʒe gif me, than speiks the fule, Suppose I be na cunning Clark in scule: Within thrie dayes to mak it well sene, With Gods Law for to mak hir ʒour Queene. And thairto do sal na man say agane, And do I not my heid sal be the pane. Than quod the king thairto I hald my hand, Thow sal haue gude gold, Lordships and Land. Or cast fra the thy cote and be tho wyse, Ane Bishoprik sal be thy benefyse. Than quod the fule without feinʒeing or fabil, Hald vp ʒour hand to hald this firme and stabil: The King thairto swore oft and oft, And thair he hes his hand haldin on loft: And now quod the fule it fallis to na King, To brek his vow or ʒit his oblissing: And it that I haue hecht thus sone sal be, Scho is ʒour Queene ʒe had thir nichts thrie: That quod the king be him that deid on Rude,
Sir fule I trow ʒe may not mak that gude. Sir I pray ʒow be not euill payit nor wraith. Efter sa strait ane oblessing and aith▪ And gir that she plesit ʒow thir nichts thrie, Fra hyneforth now quhairfoir may not sa be.

Notwithstanding I am hartly content, To my awin Queene I wil hartly consent: And mair attour I sweir the be the Heuin, I sal hir neuer displeis for od nor euin. With thy that she may preif that it was sho, Thir nichts thrie with quhom I had ado: And with that word forouttin mair carping, Vnto the Queenes Chalmer come the King. And simply to hir presence can persew, And tempit hir with takens gude and trewe And sickarly he fand that it was sho, With quhome thay nichts thrie he had ado. Than joyful was he in his harts splene, Of the plesance he had with his awin Queene: Than on his kneis he askit forgiuenes, For his licht laytes and his wantones. And sho forgaue him meiklie this ful yte, That he had done throw lichtnes of delye: For weil sho saw that al was fantesy. That he vsit and richt grit foly. And thus the King and Queene into this cace, Thankit thair God for thair weilfair and grace, And syne this fule thay thankit of al, That caused sik concord amang them al. And off his coate thay irli be the croun, And on him kest ane syde clarkly goun: And quhen this syde goun on him micht be, Ane cunning Clark and wyse than semit he.
Syne efter sone ane Bishop thair was deid, Ful sone was he maid Bishop in his steid: And to the King and Quene he was full leif, And of thair inwart counsell ay maist cheif. And God sen si eamples ay wer sene, To ilk ane King that luifit nocht his Quene. God gif vs grace and space an eird to spend, Thus of my tailnow cummin is the end.

MERY TAILES. ANe cunning Painter thai was dwelling in London, quhilk had a fair ʒoung wyfe, and for things he had to do went ouer the Sea, bot be∣cause he was sumquhat elou he prayed his wyfe to be con∣ent that he micht paint ane lambe vpon hir belly, and pray¦ed hir that it micht remaine thair til he come hame againe, quhairwith sho was content. After quhilk lambe sa painted, he departed, and sone efter that ane lustie ʒoung Merchant, a Bacheler came and sted his wyfe and obtayned hir fauour, so that sho was content that he sould lye with hir, quha resort∣ed to hir, and had his pleasour often tymis And on a tyme he tuke a Pensel, and to the ambe he painted twa hornes, wening to the wyfe that he had bot re∣freshed the auld painting Bot at the last about a ʒeir after hir husband came hame againe, & the first nicht he lay with his wyfe he luked vpon his ues belly and saw the twa horne painted thair, hee said to his wyf that some other body had bene beside thair, and maid a new painting, for the picture that he painted had na hornes, & this hath hornes. To quhom his wyfe shortly answered and said: ʒea sir, remember that it is a ʒeir past and mair sen ʒe went, and thocht it war bot a lambe quhen ʒe went, now perdie, it
must neids be a sheip and haue hornes by the course of nature, and thairfoir ʒe must be con∣tent. This man heiring his wyfis resonabill answer, held him content, & asked no moir▪ ¶Of him that played, &c. IT fortunit that in a market Toun in the county of Suffolk their was a stage play, in the quhik play one called Iohne Adroynes, quhisk dwelled in another village two myles frō thnce played the deuil. And quhen the play was done, this Iohn Adroynes in the euening departit from the said market Toun, to go hame to his awin hous. And becaus he hd thair no change of clothing, he went forth in his Deuils apparell, quhilk in that way comming hame ward, he came throwe a warren of coes belanging to a gentilman of the village, quhair he himself dwelt. At quhilk tyme it fortuned ane Preist a Vicar of a Kirk there∣by with two or thrie vnthriftie fellowes, had brocht with them a hors a hey and a Ferit, to the intent thair to get co∣nyes. And quhen the ferit was in the eirth & the hey set ouer the path way quhair this Iohn Adroines sould cum, this preist and his other fellowis saw him him come in the Deuils ray∣ment considdering that they wer in the deuils seruice and steiling of conies, & supposing it had bene the deuil in deid, sor feir thay ran all away. This Iohne Adroynes in the deuils rayment becaus it was sūquhat
dark saw not the hey bot went forth in haist & stumblit thair at, and fell doun, that with the fall he had almoist brocken his neck Bot quhen he was a littill reuiued, he luked and spied it was a hey to catch conies, and luked forther and saw yat they ran away for fei of him, and saw a hors tyed to a bush laden with conyes quhilk thay had taken, and he tuke the hors and the hay and leipt vpon the hors & rode to the gentilmans place that was Lord of the Warren, to the intent to haue thanks for taking such a praye. And quhen he come thether, hee knockit at the ʒet and anon an of the gentilmans seruants ask∣ed quha wes thair, and sodenlie opened the ʒet, and as sone as he perceued him in the deuils rayment, he was sodinly abash∣ed, and barred the dore againe, and went vnto his Maister, and said and swore vnto his Maister, that the deuil was at the ʒet and would cum in. The Gentilman heiring him tell so, called another of his seruants, and bade him go to the ʒet to knowe quho was thair. This second seruant come to the ʒet, and durst not open it, bot asked with a loud voyce quho was thair. This Iohne Adroynes in the deuils apparell answered with a voyce and said, tel thy Maister I must neids speik with him or I go. The seruant heiring that answeir supposing it had bene the deuil went in againe to his maister and said thus: it is the
deuil in deid that is at the ʒet, and sayeth he must neids speik with ʒow or he go hence. The gentilman than began a lytill to abash, and called the stewart of hsi hous quhilk was the wy¦sest seruant that hee had, and bad him ga to the ʒet and bring him sui word quha was thair.
