Mary Magdalens Loue. Vppon the twenty Chapter of Iohn, from the first verse to the eighteenth. Vppon the first verse as fooweth. The Text. Now the first day of the weeke came Mary Magdalen, early when it was yet dark vnto the Sepulchre, and sawe the stone rowled away from the Tombe. DEerely beloued in our Sauiour Christ: In this first verse I find foure cheefe note to bee well marked, and kept in memo∣rie:
First the person named, who it was, and of what condition: Se∣condlie, the time, Thirdlie the place, and fourthly what was there seene and done. The person was Marie a woman, and one that had bin a great sinner, the time that she came, was the first day of the week in the morning earely, euen when it was yet darcke: the place shee went vn o, was the sepulcher, and the thin that shee saw there was the stone rolled awaye from the Tombe: now touching Marie let vs note two especiall causes of her comming, loue and sorrow, loue that she bare him, and sorrow that shee had for him. I meane to liue without him: who of manie thou∣sandes are ignorant, that the mista∣ken loue indeed, which the wan∣tons, and wretches of this worlde are to much troubled with; will keep their wits waking, watching
and continuallie woorking for the accomplishment of a moste wilfull or rather woefull desire: and if then the deuill, by the permission of God, haue such power to blind the eyes, and charme the senses of humane creatures, with that lewd humor of mistearmed loue, how much more warie, effectuall, and continuall carefull watch dooth the loue of God keep in the soules of his seruantes, longi and look∣ing, both day and nig, and think∣ing no time too earlie or long, be it neuer so long, so that at last they may come to the enioying of their souls comfort: Let vs therfore con∣sider a little what may bee spoken of Maries loue: First that shee lo∣ued we cannot doubt, for it was spoken by the mouth of Christ him∣selfe vnto Simon. Luke, Chapter 7. Verse. 45. Many sinnes are forgiuen hir, for she loued much▪ But marke
now the nature of this good loue what it wroght in her▪ three excel∣lent blessings, Constancy, Modesty, & Humility: Constancy in the hart, Modesty in the minde, and Humi∣lity in the soule: but of these wee wil speake more hereafter in their due places, & therefore touching the first words from whence I ga∣ther my first notes, marke here what is saide by the olye Euange∣list, whom  ameth: Marie Mag∣dalen, a vvn, and one that had beene a great sinner: out of vvhom vvere cast out seuen deuills, but vvhen the foule spirits vvere gone, there came to her that good spirit, that in true penitence found espe∣ciall grace with her liuing Lorde, not that she was then no longer a sinner, but being a penitent sinner, she had obteined mercie. Now you see, how Marie had beene a great sinner, and receiued
a great forgiuenes, which begat in her faith so great a Loue, as broght forth great fruits of repentance, & made of her as it were a new wo∣man, turning her from a sinfull ser∣uant to the world, to a louing ser∣uant to Christ: as in these wordes following shall appeare. Nowe earlie in the Morning the first day of the VVeeke, came Mary Magdalen, he sayeth not the Disci∣ples, but Mary Maglen: See here you blessed and welbeloued of God, both men and women: What a sweet example of care she hath left for your comfort that wil follow hir, it is saide heere, shee came the first day of the weeke: An excellent note for good hus∣bandes and huswiues to obserue, not to ouerslippe their time, till the latter end of the Weeke, and then perhaps also be either idle, or worse exercised, as I feare too ma∣nie
are in these dayes: then ano∣ther note of wisdome in the choo∣sing of her worke to seeke Christ: for beginne the Weeke with him and thy worke will thriue the bet∣ter, and continue the Weeke with him and thy wages wilbe the grea∣ter, and neuer worke but with him, and thou shalt finde thy la∣bour will bee the easier by the vn∣speakable mfort of thy reward. Manie are  earely, and downe late, as the fe about his robery, the couetous about his misery, the adulterer about his villanie, and the Traytor about his reason, but alas Mary had none of these thoughtes in her head, shee rose earely to seeke Christ, shee came earely while it was yet darke: for as Dauid the Psalmist saieth in his hundred and thirtie Psalme, and sixt verse. My soule waiteth on the Lord, more than the Morning watch
watcheth for the Morning: who then wilcome to Christ must wait for him as Dauid did; and seeke for him as Marie did. Earely in the morning and the first day in the weeke and though it be dark, yet wee must watch till it be day, and then by Gods helpe wee shall see that wee looke for: Now let vs speake a little more of Mary, shee found her self a sinnr, and there∣fore vnwoorthy to see her Saui∣our any more, but yet her sinnes were forgiuen her and she desired to sinne no more, and novv did grace so woork in her looue, that faine she would see her Lord a lit∣tle more: but alas her Lord vvas dead, to other perhaps, but not to her, and see how faith vvrought in her affection, her heart had light before her eyes, shee vvent through the dark and came to the place ere it vvas day.
The diuell watcheth in the light to lead his followers into darknes and shall not wee watch thorough darknes to seeke Christ in the light? Iudas watch all day to betraye his Master in the night, but Mary wat∣cheth all night to come to her Ma∣ster in the day: Oh sweete blessing of God where faith wrought loue and loue dutie, and all came toge∣ther to bring Mary to Christ: and except with these we followe her, wee shall neuer come to him: but Mary was a woman, and shal men follow women? why her happines came from God, and shall not wee follow her to her happines? but Mary was a sinner, and what flesh is righteous? and Mary was repen∣tant, and what more proofe of e∣lection? and Mary loued Christe, and what more ioy in a Christian? now not offending men; let mee thus farre speake in the commen∣dation
of godly women: if the first spokē off in the scripture offended God; the last spoken off, looued Christ: If Heuah vvas an accursed vvife, Mary vvas a blessed virgine: If shee vvere full of sinne; Marie vvas ful of grace: If Eue vvas temp∣ted by the diuel, Mary vvas saluted by the Angell: And if Eue bare a vvicked Son Cain, Mary brought a blessed Son Christ: novv though this vvas not that Mary that bare Christ, yet this vvas she that loued Christ, & for a vvorld of such god∣ly women as are lest examples to their posterities & sex in all Ages: I would be loath to spend time in recounting their names, which truly set downe, might make a Ca∣thalogue of worthy memorie: but I speake to all beloued men & wo∣men, thinke it no scorne to follow Marie in her early rising to seeke Christ: for to rise early is holsome
for the bodie, & to walke to Christ is comfortable to the soule, suche exercise is better than any physick, & such a trauail brings the best rest. Now Mary came early in the mor∣ning while it was yet darke: surely, sin dooth much darken our eyes, that wee cannot see the way to Christ yet repentaunce gaue Ma∣ry such a light that shee found the way to his sepulchre, and surelye wee must haue our lampes fedde with the oyl of her Lords grace, or we shall neuer finde the way to her soules comfort: when Peeter and Iames were taken vp into the heauens & saw Christ in his glory, standing betwixt Moses and Eliah he could say, Heer is good beeing Lord, but after hee was crucified, who sought him at his sepulchre? Mary: Many would perhaps bee glad to rise earely to go vp to hea∣uen to him, but who will goe tho∣rough
the darke to seeke him at his graue? Mary did, and such as Ma∣ry will: Oh blessed Mary, so may I well tearme thee, for as the Psal∣mist saith in his Psalme. Blessed are they that seeke him with their whole heart: & in that was she surely bles∣sed, for shee sought him with her whole heart, by the light of her soules loue, orels being in the dark she woulde haue hardlye hitte the way: but now, where sought she him? at his sepulchre where he was buryed: see heer the trong effects of loue, liuing or dead, shee could not forget her Lord: dead she saw him, buryed shee knewe hee was; & why did she then seek for him? loue could not forget him, & sor∣rowing to liue without him, aliue or dead she wold be glad to se him: Now stil note the force of loue in the elect. A woman in nature feareful was now valiant, the dark∣nes
vncomfortable, shee thorow the dark sought her comfort, and amongst the graues of the dead sought the comfort of her life: here was loue voide of feare, and faith void of doubt, broght a spiritful of sorrowe to seeke her light in the darke, and Mary full of griefe to seeke her Lord in his graue. Now Mary came early while it was darke, the first day of the weeke vnto the Sepulcher. Manie will rise earely to looke to their Chickens, their Geese, their Duckes, their Swine, or such other things, but al things must be looked ouer, ere Christ be thought vpon, and perhappes not then neyther: But as it is written in Luke, Chap. 10, vers. 41.42. Mar∣tha was troubled much about her worke, but Mary tooke the good parte: so manye take earely iour∣nies, but Mary here made the good walke: Now though she came to
seeke him where hee was buried, yet in hir hart she beheld him cru∣cified; for who sees not his death in the sorrow of his hart, I am per∣swaded shall neuer find him liuing in the ioy of his soule: But he was crucified for Maries and our re∣demption, and shall not wee with Mary mourne for his Passion? Yes let vs with Maries loue looke into his Mercie, and following hir sor∣row, wee shall finde hir comfort; and though not at the first as wee wish, yet at the last as she did: For if we watch the darke night of sin that wee sleepe not in sensualitie, but rise early to repentance, and walke with a true faith to the find∣ing of our soules felicitie, when we haue gone thorough the dark, and attended the day, wee shall see the stone rowled away, and somewhat lest for our comforte, when the hardnes is rowled from
our hearts, we shall enioy the bles∣sing of our soules: Which that we may the better attaine vnto, let vs watch with Mary, walke with Mary, and weepe with Mary, rise early, goe thorough the darke, and come to the Sepulcher to seeke Christ in his graue, ere wee looke for him in his glorie: and though it bee long ere wee see his Person, yet shall wee quickly be partakers of hir comforte: For shee, as you shall herear heare (Godwilling) sawe him, bu knewe him not; so shall wee bee sure of his Mercy though we see him not: Will you then come to Christ? Learne to imitate Mary in hir course: Who hath many sinnes, and findeth much remission, let his loue bee great, and his sorrowe not little, to lacke the comforte of his loue: Christ is offended, Christ must for∣giue; Christ must be loued, Christ
must be sought, and that early, for feare wee come too late, and since wee cannot behold him with our eyes of corruption, let vs holde him in the heart of our regenera∣tion; let the first day of the weeke be the first beginning of our youth lest when wee growe olde either our spirites be so dull, or our eyes so dimme, that we shall not be able to rise, or at least to walke to seeke Christ: Christ dwels a great way from the worlde, and ee that is o∣uerladen with sinne, must shake off his burthen, or hee will neuer come at heauen; and hee or shee that will not in the sorrow of their sinnes rise vp to repentance, and in Christ his Passion learne the pow∣er of Mortification, they may per∣haps heare much of him, and pray much to him, but I doubt whe∣ther they shall euer come neere him.
Learne then of Mary whom to loue, Christ: Why? for his good∣nes in forgiuenes of hir sins, & the feeling of his Mercy; then louing Christ, learne hir sorrowe to bee without him; with hir sorrowe▪ hir labour to rise early to seeke him; the place where to finde him, at his Sepulchre: I meane in the Mortification of the flesh, that you may glorifie him in the spirite; who in forgiuenes of sinnes, and redemptio of sinners; in comfor∣ting the penitent, and blessing the faithfull in the perfection of loue, deserueth all honour, to whome sweete Iesu, the blessed sonne of the euerliuing God, with our hea∣uenly father and the holy Ghost, bee all Glory, Honour and Prayse, both now and euer, Amen.
Mary Magdalens Loue. Vppon the seconde verse, which is as followeth. The Text. Then shee ran, and came to Simon Peter, and to the other Disciple whom Iesus loued, and said vnto them, they haue taken away my Lorde out of the Sepulcher, and we know not where they haue laid him. IN this Verse I take foure especiall notes: First, hir running; then to whom shee ranne; then how shee spake; and
last what shee said. In the former verse it is said, she came to the Sepulcher, nowe in this verse it is said, shee ranne from the Sepulcher. Shee came tho∣rough the darke to seeke Christ in his deade Tombe; but nowe it is day, shee beginnes to runne to his Disciples, to tell what shee had seene, hoping perhaps of them to heare somewhat of im: Se here a notable token of true Constan∣cie in her le, through the darke shee walke o seeke him at his graue; now in the light shee runs to his Disciples to enquire of him: So surely ought wee to doo, if in our owne cogitations wee finde him not as we desire, let vs runne to the Disciples to instruct our de∣sires howe to seeke him: Searche the Scriptures saith Christ, and there you shall reade of mee. So, the Scriptures wee must
search, if we hope to finde Christ, but if wee bee so ignoraunt that wee cannot reade them, let vs then runne to his Ministers, that can and will deliuer his Worde vnto vs, that by them we may be instructed to finde the best way vnto him. Then shee ranne and told Simon Peter, and the other Disciple whom Iesus loued. In this worde Then, is a notable sence to bee obserued: First shee came to the Sepulcher, and sawe the stone rowled away from the Tombe, and then shee ranne and tolde the Disciples; so wee must first looke into Christs buriall, by his buriall, I meane his whole Pas∣sion; and then if wee finde not his Resurrection, wee must runne vnto his Ministers for our instru∣ction.
Againe I note here an excellent token of Modesty in Mary to bee obserued of all Godly creatures, as well men as women; it is not saide heere, that so soone as shee came to the Sepulcher, shee went in, or looked into the Se∣pulcher, but shee sawe the stone rowled away from the Tombe, and then shee ranne and tolde the Disciples: By a litle shee gathered more, the stone was rowled away, the graue as open, and him shee saw not, and therefore either he was gone, or els finding hir vn∣worthines to come so neere as his Tombe, shee would not looke in, but shee woulde first tell his Disci∣ple: what shee had seene, to heare what they would say to her. Howe excellent a note is this of Modesty, for all Godly women & men tht are zealously giuen, to runne to Gods Ministers to en∣quire
of Christ, and to bee instru∣cted in his will, ere they diue too deepe into the secretes of his holy Scriptures. Then shee ranne, and came to Si∣mon Peter, and the other Disciple whom Iesus loued, and saide vnto them: Heere are you to note an excellent point of Modesty in Ma∣ry, to be carefully obserued thogh shee ranne from the Sepulcher, yet shee came to the Disciples: Though she ranne while she was out of sight, yet shee came when shee was in sight of the Disciples: shee ranne not hir selfe out of breath, to tell hir tale out of order; but after that shee had runne the time of hir loue, she came in good time for hir comfort; as (Godwil∣ling) you shall heare hereafter. Now it is not said, shee cryed, or sighed, or sobbed, and coulde not speake a worde, or as a body halfe
destraught, laide holde on the Dis∣ciples, to hale them to the place where shee had beene, but when shee came to them shee saide; which worde saide, encludeth a kinde of discreete deliuery of speeche: As wee commonly say in our Courtes, when a speech is well deliuered, if vpon any occa∣sion of the hearers consideration the speaker be interrupted, when the cause is thought vppon hee is bidden say on: In speaking oft we heare added vnto this word speak, either lowd or softly, distinctly or plainely; but to saying I find none of these: but I finde written the sayings of the wise. Yea, Christ himselfe, in heauen and earth, the glory of all wisedome, vseth that worde in many places, as Verelie, verelie, I say vnto you, &c. Ma∣ny places coulde I sette downe where this worde is vsed to beau∣tefie
the speeche, with the Mode∣stie in the deliuery. But I will leaue them to the Readers ley∣sure, and I woulde wish that all men and women woulde learne to imitate Mary in this manner of hir speaking, to talke as shee did of Christ and to his Ministers, to learne their instruction for their knowledge of him: Then would there not bee so many wicked men and women, Witches and Sorcerers, Gluttos, Drun∣kards, Adulterers, Thieues, Traytours, and Murtherers, besides other vayne and idle hea∣ded people, and blasphemers of GODS most holy name, so daylie and howerlie exercised as they commonly are, in most vile and filthy talke, too intollerable to be heard of any Christian, leauing to thinke either of Christ his word or his Disciples, and wilfully runne
headlong to the diuell and his fol∣lowers, and will rather laugh at Mary, and runne to the diuel, than weepe with Mary to come to Christ: But God for his mercies sake, turne their heartes, and with them giue vs all grace to goe with Mary to Christs Tombe, to runne with Mary to his Disci∣ples, and to returne with Mary to our comfort: But of that we will (by Gods grace) speak more here∣after. Nowe shee ame to the Disciples and saide, they haue taken away my Lorde, and I knowe not where they haue laid him: Note here now the cause, that led Mary to the Disci∣ples: Hir Lord she mist, & faine she would see him, but knowing not where to seeke him, shee thought it hir best way to goe to his Disci∣ples to enquire of him: To seeke in the Heauens, alas shee was too
great a sinner to looke so high for him; in the earth to seeke him were in vaine, for the stone was rowled away from the Toombe, and therefore he was surely stolne away; and in the worlde to seeke him, alas it is too base a place for so Royall a Presence, hauing before his death so vngratefully entertay∣ned him. Nowe neither in the Heauens, the Earth, nor the World; alas, where soulde shee enquire after him? Is not of any of his Disciples: And therefore to them shee ranne, and to them she said, They haue taken away my Lord and I knowe not where they haue laid him. For many causes dooth the Lorde absent himselfe from vs, that wee may consider howe wee haue lost him, and seeke howe to finde him: If we loose him by sin, we must seeke him by repentance, and wee shall finde him by faith;
but wee must seeke him as Mary did, runne to his Disciples to en∣quire of him, and so shall wee the better come to him. Nowe touching the Disciples shee came vnto; one thing I espe∣cially note in the naming of them: Simon Peeter and the Disciple whom Iesus loued. Though all the Disciples were called by the espe∣ciall grace and power of the holy Ghost, to the true seruice of GOD, in the administration of his holy worde, yet here I note them two especially named: For to which of his Disciples did hee say as hee said to Peter? when hee confessed him to bee the sonne of the liuing God? as it is written in the sixteenth Chapter of the Gos∣pell of Saint Matthew, and six∣teenth verse: Fleshe and bloode hath not reuealed this vnto thee, thou shalt be called Cephas, which
is by interpretation a stone. And vppon this Rocke will I build my Church: Not vppon Peter, but Peters confession. And againe, to which of them did he say as hee saide to Peter three times; Dost thou loue mee Peter? Feede my flocke. Dost thou loue me Peter? Feede my Lambes, &c. Who though hee answered him to both his questions, with Lorde thou knowest I loue thee; yet hee trea∣bled his question againe, asking him, Dost thou loue mee Peter? And when hee had receiued his answere, that Lorde thou know∣est all thinges, and thou knowest I loue thee: Hee gaue him this commandement, Feed my Lambs nowe, if wee bee Lambes of Christes flocke, where shall wee looke for the milke of his mercie, but out of the booke of his most holy and sacred Scriptures, & who
can interprete them vnto vs? But his learned and holy Ministers, and such as will shewe Christe their loue in instructing his flocke. Such a Disciple was Peter, and such a Lambe was Mary: God sende vs many such Lambs as Mary, to run to such Disciples as Peter, to talke of nothing but Christ. Now the other was hee whom my Text sayth Iesus loued: and Christ beng hir loue, of whome shoulde she better enquire after him, than o his beloued? See then, what is the cause that first leads vs vnto Christ? Loue: How shall we seeke him? but goe to his Ministers for our instruction; who by the true administration of his holy Worde, doo manifest them∣selues to bee the beloued of his Mercie. Learne then of Mary when to seeke Christe, the first day of the
weeke, in the beginning of our daies, then thorough the darkenes of sinne, to breake out into the day light of Grace; then where to seeke him, in his Tombe; if there you finde him not, runne to his Disciples to enquire for him; and to which of them? those that by the discharge of their dueties, are most likely to be his beloued: and thus if you will bee guided by the line of hir loue, I doo not doubt, but you shall come to hir comsort; which as hirs was, let ours bee, in the onely sight of our most blessed Sauiour, sweete Iesus Christ, the light that will leade vs through the darke, the life that will raise vs vp from death, and the loue that will giue vs life for euer: to whome in his Redeemer, in his holy spirite our comforter, and all in one, our Lorde, King, and euerliuing, al∣mighty GOD, bee ascribed
and giuen all Honour, Prayse, Dominion, and Glory, both nowe and for euer, Amen.
Mary Magdalens Loue. Vppon the foure, fiue, sixe, seauen and eighth verses, which are as followeth. The Text. Peter therefore went foorth and the other Disciple, and they came vn∣to the Sepulcher: So they ranne both, but the other Disciple did outrnne Peter, and came first to the Sepulcher. And hee stooped downe, but went not in; then came Simon Peter following him, and sawe the lin∣nen cloathes lie, and the kerchiefe that was vpon his head, &c. Then
went in also the other Disciple which came first, and saw and be∣leued. IN these verses I note foure chiefe pointes to be considered; the cause of their going forth, the cause of their running, why the other Disciple outranne Peter, & the cause why comming first to the Sepulcher, hee stooped downe, but went not in. Peter therefore went forth and the other Disciple, and came to the Sepulcher: When Mari had told them what shee had seene; it is not said, they presently beleeued; but they went forth: For though shee told a truth, yet they would see, & thē beleeue: for it is said they went forth and came to the sepulcher: It should seeme, and very likelye
that they had some remembrance of Christes wordes, spoken before vnto them touching his passion, & resurrection, the third daye, and therefore conferring their memo∣ries with her wordes, they were the readier to goe forth to try the truth of her report: Nowe Mary being a woman, and so great a sin∣ner as she had bin, it was likely she should not obtaine any great cre∣dite with the Disciples of Christe: But, Truth in whose mouth soe∣uer it be, deserues well to bee en∣tertained: and nowe the Disciples not hauing any knowledge to the contrarie, woulde not sticke at a little trauaile to try the truth of her speech: and therefore it is said they went forth: You see here she was not blamed for her reporte, nor doe wee finde as yet shee was beleeued, but only approued: so that hereby we are to learne what
to report, and alwaies to tel truth, and to trie out a truth, ere we giue credite to a report: but if the talke be of Christ and the reporte from the faithfull, and that conferring it with the Scriptures, we finde any likelyhood of truth, wee must not regard who it be, man or woman, but goe with them for their com∣fort to the triall of their cause: It should seeme now they heard it of none, but of Mary, for as it is saide of none but of Marie that came earlie to the Sepulcher, and from thence ranne to the Disciples and told them what she had seene; so it is not like that she had told anie but the Disciples, for if shee had, some or other would haue beene with the Disciples before her: or els haue beene at the Sepulcher, before shee had reained with thē; ut the Disciples not hearing of it, by any other, (as I said before) cal∣ling
to memorie, some of Christes speeches deliuered vnto them be∣fore, to trie out the truth, they went forth, and came to the Se∣pulcher: Nowe here is neyther a beleefe, nor distrust, a reprehen∣sion nor commendation, but a proofe: and of whome? a woman, and in what? of a truth, touching the resurrection, or at least as shee thought of the remoouing of Christ: But of that I meane (God-willing, to intreate more hereaf∣ter: but to my Text: Peter there∣fore went forth, and the other Dis∣ciples, and came to the Sepulcher. What an encounter argumēt may this be to all men & women to tell truth, when the Disciples of Christ vpon the report of Mary, would go forth with hir, & not return till they cam to the sepulcher: we read that Ananias & his wife wer both stroken dead for denying of their
and lying to the Disciples of Christ: yet here we see Mary for telling of a truth accompanied with the Dis∣ciples vnto the graue of Christ: learne therefore how dangerous a thing it is to lie vnto the Disciples of Christ, especially in naming of Christ, the God of all truth, and how gratious a thing it is in man or woman to come to the Disci∣ples with a truth, or to enquire of any truth touching Christ: & thus much touching the cause of the Disciples goin forth, and com∣ming to the Sepulcher: Now is it saide here, they ran both, but the other Disciple out ran Peter: a light beleefe will make many men and women to runne them selues out of breath to see a May game, a Beare-bayting, or a bauble not worth the loking after, but heere was no such report, and therefore coulde bee no such beleefe: and
therefore woulde to God the idle heades of the world would turne their mindes to better matters & leaue such toyes, as are bt snares of the diuell, & harken vnto the truth that may bring thē to Christ: and rather bee delighted to talke with the Ministers of Gods holye worde, of the passion of Christ, & to seeke him in his worde; than to runne with wicked people to see a foole in a play: but learne of Ma∣rie, what to say, whither to goe, & what to doe? Seeke Christ, bee in∣structed by his Disciples, and goe with them to his Sepulcher: First learne to be mortified, or els neuer looke to be glorified: Nowe it is said that the other Disciple whom Iesus loued out ran the other: so that the verie loue in the spirite, that he had vnto the Lord, was it that carried him to the Sepulcher to see what he had hard, or might
become of his Master: and surelie, the greater measure of loue, that God infuseth into the soule of man, by the inspiration of his holy spirit, the greater shall bee his, or her desire, and the swifter to come to him, his Sepulcher, or his holie word: the true testimonie of his eternall mercie. First it is said, they went forth, now they ranne, so we see hereby, that once entred into the way to Christ, wee will euen runne to get to him, at least if wee be lead by the ame spirit that Ma∣rie and the Disciples were: other∣wise if once in the way wee looke backe, we shall euer be vnworthy to finde the path againe to our comfort: but to the former words, So they ran both, but the other Dis∣ciple outranne Peter: Of all con∣tentions, I finde it the best, to con∣tend for the soules comfort; & of al races, the best running to Christ:
manie run after their dogges, hurr∣ting all day for a hare, and perhaps go without her at night; other run their horses for the ell, and tire them, or kill them ere night; many run for a wager, that breake their hart in the course, that they are ne∣uer able to goe againe: too manie runne from their Countries, that sield or neuer returne good Chri∣stians; but too fewe run to the Dis∣ciples of Christ, or with his Disci∣ples to his Sepulcher: but as I said before, Marie did, and such as Ma∣rie will: shee ran to them to tell of Christ, & shee came with them to heare of Christ, would to God we coud & would so run, & so talke as Mary did, that Christ might bee the delight of our talke & the end of our trauaile: Alas poore wret∣ches that we are, how vile & cor∣rupt is this nature of ours? that we are so blinde that we cannot, or so
blinded that wee will not see the way that leads vs to Christ, and if God of his mercie haue opened our eyes, so that wee see the way, yet wee are so lazily lame, as that we had rather sleepe out the day in idlenes, or loose the whole yere in wantonnes, or in all wicked & filthy beastlines, spend the whole time of our yeres, rather than tra∣uaile one mile, nay step one foot, or stay on minute, eyther to talke of Christ, or come to his Disciples: wee will runne to a playe, where perhaps we may haue our purses pickt, or to football, where wee may haue our shinnes broken, or to a fray where wee may haue our heads broken, or a worse matter: but to come to Christ our spiritu∣all Treasure, our Creator, Redee∣mer, our peace, health, and soules Chirurgen, who will runne, or is almos willing to stirre a fote? But
here it is saide his Disciples ranne, and surely who will be his Disciple must run, or els it is so far a walke, that they will hardly euer come to him: Nowe as it is thought, Peter was the elder, and not so light of the body, yet such was his loue, that it is saide, they ranne both: so that old and young must run: now marke further, what I gather in these two running together: Peter was old and faithfull, the other in his loue eyther bashfull or feare∣full: for it is said when he came to the Sepulcher, he stooped downe and sawe the linnen clothes lying, but went not in: See heere the ex∣cellent care of this Disciple: either bashfulnes, that beeing the youn∣ger, he should presume to goe in before the elder, or to auoide a vaine glorie of boldnesse without aduise, or fearing to offend to goe in without counsaile: It is said hee
stooped downe & saw the linnen clothes, but went not in: Note heere an excellent warning for yong heads that are either zealous in Religion, or learned in the holy Scriptures, to learne by this Disci∣ple how to run to Christ; let them take their elders with them, and do nothing without them or their aduise: and if they come to anye perfection, yet let them giue place to their elders, in anye thing that may bring them to Christ: for so did the beloued of God, the Dis∣ciple here spoken of: Againe here we may note an excellent agree∣ment between them, though Iohn outranne Peter, yet hee stayed for him at the sepulcher: & seemd not angry or saide any thing to him for his sow comming, nor laught at him for his stiffe runing, but that he stayed and went not in, neither doe I finde that Peter was angrie
with his outrunning of him, nor smild at his feare (as it shuld seeme) of his stay, that he durst not goe in till he came; for being led both by the power of one spirit, they gest thus farre each of others minde: Loue was of most force to bring him to the Sepulcher, but saith made Peter more valiant to goe in into the Sepulcher: yet no doubt but they both had faith, and both had loue: or els Maries report had not made them run so fast thither: For the commendation of the one, what can bee saide more of faith, then that which Christ him∣selfe said vnto Peter, vpon his con∣fession of him, to be the sonne of the liuing God, vpon that rocke he woulde build his Church: and for the other, what more proofe of his loue? vnto any creature liuing, than in the Reuelation of his Di∣uine will? as in the holy word you
may reade most sweetly expressed. Learne then I saie to run with the loue of Ioh. but venter not in with∣out the faith of Pet. Iohn perhaps might doubt manie things, that the grae might bee closed when hee were in, for his presumption, in going in without authoritie, & yet not being forbidden at least to his owne remembrance, he might be the lesse afraide what woulde fol∣lowe of his aduenture: bt while loue prickt him forward, and feare puld him backe, comes Peter to the place, and goes into the Sepul∣cher: Here is the old saying disan∣nulled, first come, first serued; no, for here you see Peter came last, but he first went in; and sawe the ker∣chiefe, and the linnen clothes lie, & the kerchiefe that was wrapped together by it selfe: then went in the other Disciple, which came first to the sepulcher: and hee saw
it, and beleeued. In these last wordes, you may see the cause, why he went not in: not that hee beleeued not at all, but that his faith was not yet of that force, that Peters was: For Peter know∣ing the Sea woulde not swallowe him, when he threwe himselfe in∣to it to come to Christ liuing; had now no fear that the earth would shut her mouth vpon him, for go∣ing in where he had beene buried: And therefore boldly he went in, and then went in also the other Disciple, who saw it and beleeued: Heere will I onely trouble you with one note more touching faith, you see howe loue brought Mary early in the morning while it was yet darke to the Sepulcher, made her runne to the Disciples to tell what she had seene, made the Disciples to runne to make tryall of the truth, and last made Iohn to
outrunne Peter, in the race to the Sepulcher, but where al this while was faith? weake in Mary by rea∣son of her sinnes, weake in Iohn by reason of his youth, but strong in Peter by reason of his comfort; so are there no doubte nowe a daies, many that are forward and zealous in Religion, that yet doo lacke that strength of faith that Pe∣ter had: for though a number per∣haps would runne with Mary to his Sepulcher, & to his Disciples to talke of him, yet who will venter to go into his graue? or will throw himselfe into the Sea? in Loue to come to him as Peter did? Now it followes they saw and beleeued; and why nowe more than before is it said they sawe and beleeued? because as yet they knewe not the Scriptures, that hee must rise a∣gaine from the dead: Lo, here is a good excuse for the weakenesse
of their faith; but what excuse can bee laide downe for vs? nay what shame is it for vs, that hauing the testimonye of their truth; seene by them, and written by them to vs, and for vs, that wee will not reade the holie Scriptures, or reading, so little beleeue them, or beleeuing, so little regarde them, that wee maye iustlie bee saide to bee without eyther faith, or loue, eyther to seeke or finde Christ, or almost to heare or thinke of him, eyther in his woorde, his Sepulcher or his mercie? but God for his mercy sake, turn our harts, and inspire our soules, with the gratious power of his glorious holy spirit, that running from the sincke of sin, we may come to the sepulcher of Christ, and that with Maries sorrow, Iohns loue, & Pe∣ters faith, we may rise earlie, in the prime of our yeares and through
the darke of sinne breake out into the day light of grace, that maie bring vs to the fight of our soules comfort in the resurrection of our blessed Sauiour, to whome nowe sitting at the right hand of God, in all absolute power, wisedome, peace, grace, and mercie, truth, bountie, loue, life, and glory, with our heauenly Father and his holie spirite one Almightie and euerli∣uing God; bee ascribed, and giuen all due honor, praise dominion, and glorie: both now, and for euer: Amen.
The Text. And the Disciples went againe to their owne home: but Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping, & as she wept, she bowed herselfe into the Sepulcher, and saw two Angels sitting one at the head & the other at the feete, where the bodie of Iesus had laine: and they said vnto her, woman, why wee∣pest thou? She saide vnto them, they haue taken away my Lord, & I know not where they haue laide him: when she had thus said, shee turned her selfe backe, and sawe Iesus standing, and knew not that it was Iesus: Iesus saith vnto hir,
woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She supposing it had bin the gardner said vnto him. If thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away, Iesus saith vnto her, Mary; she tur∣ned her selfe, and saith vnto him Rabony: which is to say Ma∣ster. DEarelie beloued in our Sauiour Christ, yee haue hearde be∣fore of the Disciples comming to the Sepulcher, with Mary, yee haue heard of Iohns outrunning of Peter, and of Pe∣ters first going in into the Sepul∣cher; yee haue I hope, noted the fruites of faith, and loue in the e∣lect children of God, in briefe to
seeke Christ, either aliue, or dead; that learning to die with him, wee may bee assured to liue with him: Now ye see what is here said, The Disciples went home againe: when they had tried the truth of her re∣port, and that their eyes were wit∣nes of more, than Mary had yet in her wordes deliuerd, (for that she had not yet presumed either to goe in, or so much, as to looke in into the Sepulcher:) they returned home without hauing further conference with her, rather wil∣ling to leaue her mourning for her loue, than to fill her head full of doubts, what might become of hir Lord: and therefore it is said, they returned to their owne home, nei∣ther commending her for her truth, nor giuing her thankes for her report shee had made, nor ad∣uising her to seeke further ater him, nor counsayling her to staye
there longer for him: but, beeing them selues ignoraunt where to seeke him, they left her to Gods pleasure, to dispose eyther of her staie there, or her departure from thence: by this I gather, that if we shall enquire of the ministers of Gods holy worde, touching anye such point, as in the holie Scrip∣tures is not laid downe, wee must not take it amisse, if we be left vnto the mercie of Gods holie spirit, for the reuelation of his holy will, ra∣ther than to ll our heades with such cogitations, as neyther the scriptures doe warrant, may per∣happes please God, nor fall out to our comfort: but yet, let vs with Mary go to the Disciples of Christ, to enquire and learne of them, what wee may for our comforte, but if we can not be resolued, then let vs run to Christ with incessant praier, that wee may aske and re∣ceiue
at the handes of his mercie, that he shall in his sacred wisdome finde to bee most to his glorie and our comfort: And thus much of the Disciples returning againe to their own home: now it followes, but Marie stood without at the se∣pulcher weeping, & as she wept, she bowed her selfe into the sepul∣cher: See here, as I haue saide be∣fore three excellent notes to bee obserued, in the loue of Mary to her Lord Christ: Constancie, Mo∣destie, and Humilie: Constancie, in that, though the Disciples retur∣ned home, shee stayed still; Mode∣stie, in that she stood, (as it is saide) without at the Sepulcher; Humi∣litie, that shee bowed her selfe to looke in; but would not presume to goe in, though the Disciples had beene there before her: how little is this first part of commendation, in Maries loue at these daies fol∣lowed;
Let them to whom God hath giuen Grace to finde it in them selues, in sorrowfull sighes consesse it to his mercie, and with teares of true repentance; amend it to his Glorie: Oh Constancie the true Testimonie of the harts loue, and the suerest token of the soules comforte, to loue Christ is a blessed gift of the holy Ghost, but to continue Constant to the end is an espeaciall fruite of Gods fauour. Oh Constant loue of Mary, that hauing once washt his feet, would now fil his Tomb with her teares: Oh rare Modestie, that in his life would but lie at his feete vnder the Table, and now was so bash∣full, as to stand without at the se∣pulcher: And, Oh most excel∣lente Humillitie, that woulde presume no further, but to looke in: See here the heauenlie loue of
this blessed woman, how much it differs from the vile nature of our worldlings loue. We daylie see before our eyes, that the wisest Prince; the moste Godlie preacher; the most louing parents; the most bountifull Ma∣ster; the most kinde kinsman; and the most faithfull friende; If they dye, howe soone are they forgot∣ten? if they bee of anye account, I meane according to the worldes estimation; that their eires maye bee the better for them, then per∣haps they will take this order, and bee at this charge for them: the Lawyer shall make his Will, the Sexton hys graue, the Preacher shall make a Sermon for him, the parish shall haue a Feaste for him, the Minister shall bee paide for buriall of him, and a few weare Blacke weedes for him, and so there is no more adoe for him:
But where are the teares of Loue all this while: alas there is no such cause, there is more gotten by his death, than by his life: rather weepe that hee liued so long, than that he died so soone: is it not too true that in manie places, it is day∣lie seene, the childe is sicke of the Mother, and wisheth his Father in his graue, ere he can learne to bee a son, or leaue to be a Childe? are not many Subiects vnkinde, that will rathe seeke the death of a Prince, than wepe for his want: are not those kin too strange in na∣ture, that are not onely continual∣ly in lawe, but seeke one anothers life for their lands? are not those seruaunts most wicked, that had rather wish for a mourning coate for a dead Master, than a cogni∣zaunce for the liuing, and will ra∣ther betray him to his death, than weepe for him when hee is gone?
And are not those friendes moste faithlesse, that will rather giue a Iudas kisse, than shedde Iosephs teares? I woulde there were no such people, but if there be, God of his goodnes giue them grace, with Mary to repent them of their wickednes, and with Mary to shed the teares of loue, that maye bee witnes of her faith: and continu∣ing in her Constancie, with feare of presumption, they maye make proofe of such Humilitie as was her commendation, and may bee their comfort. How much this vertue of Constancie is commen∣ded in diuers places of the holye Scriptures, yee may read, as in Ge∣nesis the fift Chap. and fourteentl verse. Henosh, for his long walking with God, was taken vppe in the heauens: Eliah for his constant faithfulnes was taken vpp into the heauens. Genesis, the two and
twentie Chapter and seuenteenth verse. Abraham for his constant loue was called the Father of the faithfull, and had the promise of the Almightie, that of his blessed seede shuld come the blessed Mes∣sias. Noah, Genesis, Chapter seuen, and thirteenth verse, for his Con∣stancie was saued with all his Fa∣milie, when all the worlde was drowned, that were not in the Arke: Dauid for his Constancie was left vnto vs a figure of Christ: the three Children in the fornace, for their Coancie, were preser∣ued in the fire. Ier. the eight and thirtieth Chapter and tenth verse, Ieremie, for his Constancie, was deliuered from the Dungeon; Iob. the one and fortieth Chapter, and twelfth verse, for his Constancie, was restored to his health, & made more happie than euer hee was, Paul, for his Constancie, was rapt
into the heauens, where hee sawe Christ in his glorie: Steuen the ho∣ly Martir of God, did shine like an Angell at the time of Martirdome: and Mary here for her Constancie, comes to the sight of her Sauiour: but of this I will (God willing) speake more fitly anone: Now for Modestie, tedious it were to trou∣ble you with many places of com∣mendation, laid downe in  lie Scriptures touching that  though some of them I thinke it not good to omit: Sara was com∣mended for her Modestie, in cal∣ling hir husband sir: Rebeccha for couering her face, when shee saw Isaach: Hester, for her modesty was said to haue hir face shine, whose bashfull feare so pleased the King Assuerus, that he laid his scepter on hir necke, and kissed hir, and held her in his armes till her trance was
ouer: And here you see her Mo∣destie so pleased God, that he sent his Aungels to comfort her: for you see what followes. And shee bowed her selfe downe and sawe two Angels, the one sitting at the head, and the other at the feete; O would to God that all women woulde learne this Modestie of Mary! then wod they not so oftē fall into such pption, as is manie times, a  of their confusion, & in steed of laughing with Michol to see Da∣uid daunce before the Arke of God, they uld weep with Ma∣ry at the Sepulcher of Christ: Mo∣destie would teach them to come to the Church with more deuoti∣on, and to heare the worde with more reuerence, than I feare too manie doe now a daies: how vn∣comely a thing it is in a maiden, to be giggling and laughing, and how vngratious a thing it is for a wo∣man,
to be tighing and babling, in the Temple of God, at the time of the reading, or preaching of his holie Gospell: Alas what will they bee thought on among the wise? the one but an idle gossip, and the other a foolish girle: but here you see Ma∣ry did none of these, and as I said be∣fore, such as Mary will doe none of these: Learne then of Mary to loue Christ, to bee Constant in louing Christ, and to vse Modsty in your loue to Christ: so shall you surelye please Christ, and I am fully perswa∣ded, bee most commnded of Chri∣stians: Nowe for Humilitie, what is more commended in the holy Scrip∣tures? Abells sacrifice was best accep∣ted for his Humilitie, Moses beloued for his Humility, Abrahams faith best regarded in his Humility, Dauids pa∣tience best considered in his Humili∣ty, Salomons request granted for his Humility, Nabuchadnezer restored to Babell for his Humility, Iob best
tried, beloued, and made happie in his Humility, Mary the virgin, recei∣ued the saluation of the Angell, and the abundance of Grace in her bles∣sed wombe for her Humilitie, and Christ himselfe for his Humilite to his Father, is glorified with his father: many places I omit, that shininglie set out the brightnes of this vertue, but indeed so manie are the rare and excellent properties of this most ex∣cellent vertue, as I thinke it past the capacity of man, to giue it halfe suf∣ficient commdation; yet thus much giuen aue to speake mine opinion of it: It pleaseth God aboue all thinges, it pleaseth man in manye thinges, and displeaseth the Godlye in nothing; at lest wherin it ought to be showen: It graceth the Prince to be humble towards God, it aduaun∣ceth the Subiecte in seruice to the Prince, it draweth loue from the pa∣rents, in the Childrens obedience, it maketh the wife alone with her hus∣band,
it bindeth friends in Amity, & perswadeth enemies to peace, it winneth Christ vnto his Church, and here you see, it bringeth the Angels to Mary: before shee ran to the Dis∣ciples, & talked with them of Christ, telling them what she had seen, now when they had seene what shee had reported, and were said to beleeue, yet they left her, and ent home a∣gaine: but what followed of her stay? Now the Disciples had left her, the Aungels came to her: was not here a speciall blessing of God? vnto so great a sinner, tha od regarding her sorrow, sent his Aungels for her comfort: Now let me a little touch one pointe that I haue ouerslipt, touching Maries weeping, for it is said: But Marie staid weeping at the Sepulcher: and she bowed her selfe; now in weeping I note fiue sundrye kinds of teares: of anger, of subtilty, of sorrow, of ioy, and of loue: some are saide to weepe for curst hart, I
feare too manie know the nature of those teares, but such are saide to crie, not to weepe; for teares com∣ming from the heart, doe so distill from the eyes, that they make no sound on the tongue; Nowe Marie it is saide, stood weeping not crying: now there are teares of subtilty, cal∣led crocodies teares, which are said to mourne and weepe, till they can bring their praier within the com∣passe of their calles, and then they o∣uerthrow them, sting them to death and then feede pon them: so may I say, are the tes of a harlot, who in her pouerty will seeme to weep for affection, far enough from her hart, til she hath caught a sole in her snare, and then shee will feede vpon him at her pleasure: thus did not Mary, for the body was dead as shee thought, that shee wept for, the earth had no eyes to behold her teares, nor did she see any man, that she could think to deceiue with her weeping: no, no,
her hart was too full of sorrowe for the dead, to thinke to deceiue any li∣uing: Now there are teares of sor∣rowe, as when Peter had denied Christ, it was said hee wept bitterly, for sorrowe that hee had denied the knowledge of so good & deare be∣loued a Master: So it is saide Iesus wept ouer Ierusalem, to thinke on the destruction of the Cittie that shoulde after ensue: manie are the causes of sorrowe, tha may bring teares out of the eyes of the moste wise and valiant that euer were; but the greatest cause that shoulde melt the heart of a Christian, should bee the sorrow of the soule for the deny∣ing of Christ: now there are teares of Ioy, as were those of Ioseph, when hee saw his Father and his Brethren: But so it should not seeme were Ma∣rie, who lookt for none but hir Ma∣ster that shee could not see: Nowe there are teares of Loue, and those proceed of the kinde nature of the
hart, as Christ wept when hee sawe Lazarus dead, whom he loued, and now Mary wept when she saw her Lord dead, or at least, could not see him dead, or aliue when shee liued: Mary was said to wash his feete with her teares, and wipe them with her haire when she was liuing: an excel∣lent note of true loue, she borowed no water but her owne teares, nor any Towell but her owne haires: Now looke againe on her Humility, she vsed no towell I say but her haire and went no higher than his feete: and for her Humility and Loue, see what befell her:  shee bowed her∣selfe into the Sepulcher, and sawe two Aungels sitting one at the head, and an other at the feete where the bodie of Ie∣sus had layne: Nowe marke the de∣grees of comfort, that came vnto this humble louing Mary, Shee came fst to the Sepulcher to the Dis∣ciple, from the Disciples to the Aun∣gels: and except Christ she could goe
no higher: Now a worde or two of the Aungels: and they said vnto her, woman, why weepest thou? and she saide vnto them, They haue taken a∣way my Lord, and I know not where they haue laide him: Now some per∣haps will haue a Ierk at this peece of Scripture, to pray to the Saintes ere they come to Christ: because she tal∣ked with the Aungels ere shee came to Christ himselfe; but let those ouer∣seene wittes looke a little better into the matter: First the Aungels came but to the graue, & seeing her there weeping, they asked her but a questi∣on in these word, woman? VVhy weepest thou? she saide they haue ta∣ken away my Lorde, and I knowe not where they haue laid him: Here is no praier made vnto them, though they were Aungels, but she onelie answe∣red their question, & so ended their talke; so if the Saints will come and speake to them; lt them aunswere their questions and haue no more to
doe with them: for surely God will better appeare vnto them in his mer∣cie, then aunswere them by his Saintes, if they could deliuer him a∣ny message; but let these blinded people take heede that these mista∣ken Saints proue not Diuels that by illusions lead them not from God, & his mercie, to their vtter confusion both of body and soule; but let mee come againe to my text: And shee bowed her selfe, and saw two Aungels sitting, one at the head, and an other at the feete: where the bodie of Iesus had lane, and the  vnto her woman, why weepest thou▪  shee saide they haue taken away my Lord, & I knowe not where they haue laide him: See nw how much did her comfort ex∣ceed the Disciples, they sawe but the linen clothes, and departed home againe; but she staid and was spoken to by the Aungels: but marke with∣all the care of her speech, and sub∣stance of her talke, she continues one
tale, shee hath no minde but of one matter, no thought but of her loue, nor any loue but of her Lorde: no ioy but in him, no talke but of him, nor sorrow but to bee without him: goe to whom shee would, come to her who wold, Disciples or Angels, al was one for hir speech, they could get nothing of her, but they haue ta∣ken away my Lord, and I know no where they haue laid him: See here nowe what a property, the faithfull claime in Christ, that they call him their Lord, as one would say, my Fa∣ther, my sonne, m ends, my house or my landes, so ere sayes Mary my Lord: who was more deare to her, than either Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, kin, or friend, or all the houses and landes of the world, and therefore with teares she continues her sorrow with these wordes: They haue taken away my Lord, and I know not where they haue laide him. But now see I pray you, what presentlie
follows. Immediatelie in a moment she turnes her selfe backe, and sawe Iesus, but knew not that it was Iesus: Nowe marke I say the glorious re∣warde of her Humilitie, from the Disciples to the Aungels, from the Aungels to Christ him selfe; Now it is said shee turned backe, as though shee was afraid, that shee had presu∣med too farre, eyther in looking in∣to the Sepulcher, or at lest in talking to the Aungls: Oh Lord, how few will learne! I would many woulde followe this vertue of Humilitie in Mary; not to  too farre, nor to speake till they be ken to, & then to bee afraide to speake too much: yea though it bee the best thing they can speake off, I meane their true loue to Christ: but to drawe to∣wards an end; marke what followes: Now she comes neare her comfort; shee sees her Sauiour, and knowes him not: for when he said vnto her, VVoman why weepest thou? whome
seekest thou? she supposing it had bin the gardner, said, Sir if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away: Thus in one word she aunswereth to both his questions, why she wept & what she sought: she sought her Lorde, in sorrow she could not finde him: Ie∣sus said vnto hir, Mary, shee turned her selfe and saide vnto him Rabboni: which is to say, Master. Now when Christ made him selfe knowen vnto her, see what wordes she vseth: but onely one, to expresse as much as she was able to speake, Master: For a faithfull seruan hat loueth his Ma∣ster, if after a long mie of him, hee come to the sight of him againe, can he forbeare teares of loue to shewe his dutie? and say with Mary, Master; confesse all yee that loue your Ma∣sters, for the rest God amend yee: Now was there euer so good a Ma∣ster, as for onely louing him, nay ra∣ther of his own meere loue giues vs
life euerlasting; forgiues vs all our offences, payes vs our wages in his mercies, and our debts for vs in the blood of his owne heart; when by reason of sinne, wee bee long absent from this so good a Master, if euer his Grace bring vs againe to his mer∣cie, with the teares of sorrowe shall we not weepe, to haue been so long from him, and so reioyce in his sight? that we shall bee able with Mary to say no more but Master: which one word so spoken, may make more pr  our ue, than a longer tale of our ser for he knoweth our hearts, loue r Humility, and so regardeth our loue, that though wee fee him not as Marie did, yet we shall enioy such part of her comfort, as if we but thinke vpon his mercie, wee shall say in heart Master, when the friends of our ioy will not suffer vs to say any more: but it is enough and so much enough, as I beseech God to graunt vs all Crace, so to sor∣row
for our sinnes, and to long for his comming, that seeking him as Mary did with teares, wee way see him with ioy, and say with Mary, Ma∣ster: which Master, Lord, King and God, be loued serued, honoured praised and glorified, of all his seruaunts here present, and all his faithfull whereso∣euer: Amen.

A Solemne Passion of the Soules Loue. AWake my soule out of the sleepe of sinne, And shake off slouth the subiect of thy shame, Search out the way how best thou mayst beginne, To holy worke thine humble will to frame: Then proue not weary of a little paine, When fleshes griefe will breede the spirites gaine, Confesse thy selfe vnworthy of the sence, To learne the least of the supernall will, Beseech the heauens in strength of their defence, To saue and keepe thee from infernall ill. Then fall to worke that all the world may see, The ioyfull loue betwixt thy God and thee.
Tell of his goodnes how he did create thee, And in his iustice, how he doth correct thee, And in his loue, how he will neuer hate thee, And that his mercie neuer will reect thee: And how he helpt thee when the world distrest thee, And with his graces how he sweetly blest thee. Sy I was sicke and he did send me health, I was in prison and he set me free. And I wa poore and he did send me wealth, And I wa blind, and he did mak me see: I was perplext and e did heale my paine, And beeing dead, he gaue me life gaine. When I was lame he did my imes restore, When I was deafe he made me heare his voice, When I was wounded, he did heale my sore, When I was sad he made my soule reioyce: When I had finde he would not yet forsake mee, When I was lost he did to mercie take me.
To say yet more, what he hath done for me, I needes must say his goodnes hath no end, Who, when on earth he saw no friend to me, Did make me feee I had a heauenly friend: A heauenly friend whose help doth faile me neuer, But is my comfort, and my King for euer. This is my Lord, my life, and all my loue, My liuing loue, and louing life ineed, This is the blessing f my best behoue, The sacred fruite whereon I sweetly feede: This is the oy that maes my hart to sing, Honour and glory to my heauenly king. Oh King more glorious  the world can know thee From whom the day, eu  on high doth spring, Where glorious works vnto the world doth show thee Of glrious loue the euer liuing King: The King of life, in whom the soule doth proue, The highest glory of the heauenly loue.
By whose high hands were all things made at first, By whose deepe wisedome they are gouernd still, By whom alone, are blessed or accurst, That loue his word, or disobay his will: By whose sweet breath they liue that doo attend him, And by whose wrath they dye that doo offend him. For who can byde the furye of his yre? Or halfe conceiue the comfort of his loue? Who plagues his foes with an infernall fire, And plants his seruants in the heauens aboue: Who shakes the heauens and makes the mountains bow If he but once begin to knit the browe. And where he loues, what will e leaue to doo? To make the soule acquainted ith his kindnes, And with what ioy will hee the spirite wooe? To shun the woes that grow of wordly blindnes. What paine, or griefe, or death did he refuse? To saue their liues that he did sweetly chuse.
Now for the greatnes of his glorious power, Hee is almighty and all glory his, Hee made the yeare, the month, day, night and hower, The heauens, earth, sea, and what in them there i: In him alone doth all their being stand, And liue or dye in his almighty hand. He spake the word, and by his word they were, And all was good his secret wisedome did, His will did worke his fauour without feare, And not a thought is from his knowledge hyd: He knows the hearts, and searcheth through the raines, And sees the roots euen of the smallest vaines. Hee deckt the Skyewith sunne and moone and starres, And made the seas to flow vpon the sand, Vpon whose shore his hand did set the barres, They shall not passe to ouerflowe  Land. Amid the ayre he hath dispearst the Clowdes, And onely Man within his mercy shrowds.
Within the depth, the fish their holes do keepe, And in the Rocks the Conny makes his house, Into the earth the crawling wormes do creepe, And hollow rocks are harbours for the mouse: The Lion keepes his dn, the bird hi nest, And man alone doth but in mercie rest. Yet these and all are guided by his power, An may not passe the passage he hath giuen them, The Sunne his course, the Aoone must know her houre An clouds must wander but where winds haue driuen them: Beasts know their times, fines know their tides, And man alone in onely mercie bides. To tell of woonders by his wisedome wrought, En from the greatest to the vie least, Which time declare y true experience taught, In fh, and towle, in rd, in man and beast: Mae but the power that doth in each abide, And how it wea  their highest pride.
The Lion first is fearefull of the Bee, The Elephant doth dread the little mouse, A crowing Cocke the Dragon may o see, The stowtest Eagle subiect to the lowse: The greatest Oxe a little taint worme killeth, And many a man a little Canker spilleth. Yet is the Lion feared for his forc. The Elephant a huge and mightie beast, The fiery Dragon killes without remorse, And Eagles carrie Lambs vnto their nest: The Oxe the taint worme vnder foot doth tread, And man sometimes doth kill the cankers head. But when tht power  together pride, Then see the strength of  ghti hand, By whose high help the  thinges are tride, To spoile the strength wherein the ongest stand: That they may know there is a power on hie, In whom they liue, and at his pleasure die.
To snew examples of the heauenly might, Against the pride of the inferiour power, The word of truth doth giue a glorious light, Where may be seene in minute of an hower: How greatest stayes that on their strengths were groun∣ded, With headlong falls were vtterly confounded. How Pharaoh first, the proud Egyptian King, That would not suffer Isräell to passe, What plagues and griefes did the almighty bring Vpon the house eun where his lodging was? Frogges, flyes, and lyce did freely make their way Euen to the chamber where proud Pharaoh lay. A number plagues the Lord did further threaten, His Land was stroken with a darkesome feare, His grasse and corne by Grashoppers were eaten, The plague destroyed his people euery where: And lat himselfe, amidst his army crowned, Was in a moment in the red Sea drowned.
Yet through these seas his hand did make the way, Where all his seruants went and wet no foote, Which prooues his loue was his elected stay, While rebell harts were torne vp by the root: Which true example to the world may proue, The glorious greatnes of his power and loue. Goliah boasted greatly of his strength, Yet little Dauid kild him with a stone, The Madian Hoast was strong but yet at length, By Gideons hand the Kings were ouerthrowne: By change of tongues fell Babylons high tower, And Christ his word did breake the ciuels power. Yet in it selfe what weaer is than water, Which drownd proud Pharaoh with his mighty host? A lowse or flye is of a little matter, Yet with such wormes are men tormented most: What strength a las is in a little stone? Yet so we reade Goliah ouerthrowne.
Know then from whence this wonder power groweth, But from the force of the almightie hand, Which to the world his glorious power showeth, When with the weake the strongest cannot stand: King Dauid wrote and it is truely knowne, That power belongeth vnto God alone. To proue the prowesle of the heauenly power, How many more examples may be showne: There is no yeare, no day, no night nor houre, But some such action to the world is knowne▪ That truth may well vnto his glorie speake. God is of power and all the world is weake. But since the world cannot the bookes containe, Wherein his works of wonder may be writ, To admiration let his power remaine, And say all powers are subiect vnto it: And let me of his loue and mercie write, Which is the substance of the soules delight.
This powerfull loue the glorie of all grace, When he had wrought the world vnto his will, And planted each thing in his proper place, And in the course that they continue still: Of all the works that he in wonder wrought, Made onely man the dearest of his thought. For what he made he made but man to serue, And man to seru onely sacred loue, And in his loue  so mans life preserue, As may the comf of his care approue: And so approue as  this sentence giue, His onely loue  the soule to liue. He loude  earth  giue it life, He loud  ife whe  is age gaue it, He loued the flesh that made the bone a wife, He loued the soule when he from death did saue it: He loude him euer yet he loude him most, To fetch him home when he him selfe had lost.
Come Poets yee that fill the world with fansies, Whose savning Muses shew but madding sits, Which all too soone doo fall into those ranzies, That are begotten by mistaking wits: Lay downe your liues, compare your loue with mine And say whose vertue is the true diuine. For further tryall let me giue you leaue, To add a truth vnto your ydle sto, Wherewith so oft you doo the wol deceaue, And gayne your selues but ill conced gloryes: Yet when you see where sweetes hts are showne, Looke on my loue, and blush to see  owne. With funny beautyes let your lues be bles, The sunne doth fetch his light but from my loue, You haue your wonders from the Phoenix nest, Mine honour liues but in the heauens aboue: Your Muses doo your Ladyes prayses sing, The Aungels sing in glory of my King.
The earth alas, from whence your loues receiue, Their flowers & sweets, their Pearses & pretious stones, To decke themselues, with which they doo deceiue, The blinded spirits of the simple ones: This earth from whence their outward graces spring, Is but the footstoole of my heauenly King. And if he so hath deckt the earth below, Imagine then the glory of his seate, Which may perswade where Aungels tremble so, For humane eyes the glory is too great: For where the sunne, the moone, and starres haue light, For natures eyes the beauty is too bright. And who doth liue that euer ye did loue, But that ye could theyr fayrest fayre vnfolde, And my fayre loue, let fayrest truth approue, No eye can liue in glory to behold: Your clearest beauty is with age declining, My loues bright glory is for euer shining.
If you be wise, thinke where true wisedome liueth, And then allow the honour to my loue: If yours be ki nk who the comfort giueth, And know the turky from the turtle doue: If constant yours, that truth let my loue try, Who lost his life, to saue his loue thereby. And let me see how liueth all your loue, But on desert the stay of all your ste, And in my loue a further life appe, Who loude indeede when he ha cse to hate: Your fancies oft for lacke of fauour starue, But my loue doth both mine and yours presarue. Then truely say whom chie your loues doth choose, To cast the counnce of theyr fauours on, Then who  againe they wholly doe refue, In liking thought as most to looke vpon: Then doo but looke vpon my loue his choyse, And whose hart most he maketh to reioyse.
The wealthy, mighty, wise and well at ease, Doo fit the fansies of your Ladies best: But poore, and weake, and simple soules best please My heauenly loue, to harbour in his brest: And who the world doth vtterly refuse, Those doth my loue vnto his fauour chuse. And see what power is in your louing natures, To take or giue what ye may gayne or lose, And ye shll see they are bu my loues creatures, Whose liues are at his pleasure to disposet And while your fauours all doo fade away, My sweet loues blessings neuer will decay. Could ye conceiue the smallest of the sweete, That doth discend from my soules dearest loue, Vpon the faith that falleth at his feete, That doth in prayer but his mercie proue: And you will blot out euery idle line, And yeeld your soules vnto this loue of mine,
Compare a weede vnto a holsome flower, A cloudie euening to a sunnie daie, A foggie miste vnto an Aprill shower, Nouember blaste vnto a bloome of May: And you shall easily see the difference plaine. Betwixt my sunne shine and your showers of raine, Compare meere follie to the finest wit, The coulest copper with the purest gold, The healthfull bodie with an ague fit: And set the youthfull age against the old, The Rauens foule note to Philomelaes voice. And quicklie say, which is the better choice▪ Compare foule pride to faire humilitie, A kinde discretion to a dogged nature, The clownish race, to true gentilitie, A blessed Angell to a cursed creature, Fauours to frownes, and smilings vnto scowle, And say the Phoenix makes all birds but owles.
Compare the earth vnto the heauen on hie, The spirites treasures vnto fleshly toves, The pbble stone vnto the Azurde Skie, The Woes of men vnto the Angels ioyc: The lowest weaknes vnto the highest powers, Then  the difference twixt my loue and yours. And when you see how all sweet blessings grow, But from the ground of my loues liuing grace, And doe againe the imperfection know, Wherein you doe your fond affection place: Then all your titles to this truth resigne, There is no life but in this loue of mine. And giue me leaue to praise my Princely loue, Although my wittes are short of such a worth, And let my spirite in my passions proue, What his high hand in mercie will bring forth: And write but truth that may be truely prooued, My onely loue, all onely to be loued.
Before all times, all thoughts, all things he was And er is, and will be aye the me, That doth i wonder wonders wonder passe, In truths high triumph of eternall fame: Where life, and loue, in grace and glory crowd, Doo sway the Scepter of the heauens renownd. Now what he was cannot be comprehended, Who in himselfe dth all things comprhend, And when that all things shall be wholly ended, Himselfe, his word, his will shall neuer end: Whose gratious life, all glorious loue bginning, Doth ad all grace, and endles glory winning. And o his Essence, this is all we finde, A spirite fully incomprehensible, A louing God vnto his seruants kinde, And in his humane natue sensible: In wisedomes wonder knowledge quintescence, And in that snce highest excellence.
The high Creator of all creatures liuing, The sweete Redeemer of his sruants lost, The glorious grace, all grace, and glory giuing, The ioy of ioyes, that glads the spirit most: The loue of life, and lie of loue indeede, Gainst death and hell, that stands the soule in seede. His seate is heauen, the earth his footstoole is, His chiefest dwelling with his soules elected, His ioy to loue and to be lode of his, His fauour, life, vnto his loues affected: His word is truth, which doth the spirit try, Where fruitfull faith shall liue and neuer dye. His blessing is the peace of conscience, His comfort mercies contemplation, His pretious gift, the spirits patience, His mercy, vertues meditation: His grce the oyle, that kills the spirits euill, His death the life that did subdue the diuell.
His garments are the sundrie sorts of graces, His tribute is but sinners scrfice, His worke, te planting vertues in their places, His gaine the loue of humble spirites seruic: His musicke Psalmes that angels neuer cease, To sing in glorie of the King of peace, This King of peace, this God of life and lue, Who in him selfe doth all d onely old, The highest blessings of the harts behoue, That faithfull truth hath to the spirite tld: This is the substance of my soules dliht, Vnworthie subiect of his worth to write. Yet as his mercie will ou  ne grace, With intrcesion of his ih ssiance, Against the power that would my thoughts deface, And prodly make agi the soule reiace: I will a little giue his loue a uch, Whose smallest praise is for my pen too uch.
What loue was that which made him like man best, Of all the worke that euer he created, What loue againe did in that liing rest, To loue him so he neuer can be hated: What loue was more to giue the man a wife, What loue was most to die to giue him life. The earth within with siluer gems and gold, Without with trees and herbs, and fruits and flowers, The waters deepe where fishes keeps their old, The lements with al their inward power: These hath my loue all made for man to chuse, And to his pleasure in his seruice vse. The fire was made to kill the chilling cold, The water made to slacke the burning heate, The subtile ayre a secret beath to hold, The earth too drie when moysture is too great: Ths crosse in natures yet doe meete in one, Onely to serue the vse o man alone.
ah byrd, each beast, each fowle, and euery fish, The flesh of man mut serue to cloath and feede, What eye can see, or heart of man can wish, But some way serues to stand poore men in steede: And for that cause their being first began, From mries loue, to serue the life of man. The light was mae to glad the lightsome eye, The sound to please the pure attentiue eare, The ayre to drawe a liuing breath thereby, The earth the body, an the limmes to beare: The clowd, the staires, the sunne, the moone, the Sye, Were made for man, to make him looke on high. All these were made out of the mould of loue, Was neuer lou came euer neee to this, Which dth  wonder in affection pru, Euen when we lea dsrude that lu of his: For when our soules did most offences doo him, He came himselfe in loue to cal vs to him.
To make, redeeme, preseru, defend, and cherih, His faithfull oues, and so in loue to nourish, in his loue, their liue shall nur prih, But like the Lilly liue and euer flouri: Are these not points sufficient to approue, The true perfection of a piereles lou? Yet more to say, that truely may be sayd, In humble honour of ths hauenly loue In mercies sweete to mke the soule dimayde, To see the blessing of thi God aboue: The louing spirit liuely to refresh, He let his seruants see him in the flesh. To see him so, as might not hurt their sight, For none migt see his high supernall power, But in his loue t see that glorious light, That gaines that sweete that cuts off eury sower: The second person of himselfe, his sonne, In whom are all things to his glory done.
And see the cuse why so he came vnto v, is onely loue the onely cause wee liue, And when we came, what comfort did he doe vs, To saue our liues his loue his life did giue: And so to sue vs from the fire of hell, That with his loue we might for euer dwell. What loue was this, to leaue his heauenly seate, Amog his anges, all in glorie serued, To cme to mn who di too ill intreate, The sacred loue, that hath his life prerud, From being honourde praisde and gloriide, To be disgraced, whipte, and crucifide. In loue e lst is highst heauenly pleasures, Aboue his angels in their eap of ioys, To liue on earth in sorowes ut of maures, With chaunge of nothing but the worlds annoyes: In toyle and trauail, long in loue he sught vs, And wth his death at last full dearely bught vs.
Oh wofull trauaile that he vndertooke, To bring our liues vnto his sacred loue, Which paine, nor crosse, nor death it selfe forsooke, That to our faith might his affection proue: Which lf the spirite of his loue beinde him, To hew the loue that seekes him how to finde him. In loue h came, that he might comfort doe vs In loue went from vs, to prouide our places, In loue he sent his comforter vnto vs, In loue he guides vs with his holy graces: In loue he made, bought, keepes and guides vs thus, And shall not we loue him that o loude vs. Yes my deare Lord, be thou my dearest loue, For Christ his sake, let my soule neuer leue thee, Who in thy loue thy liuing truth doth proue, That mkes me finde the world doth all deciue me: nd were there truth on earth as there is none, Yet were thy loue the ioy of life alone.
And lt these tares be witnes of my loue, Which first doo begge remission of my sinne, nd in rpentance doo but mercy moue, To ope the gates of grace and lt me in: Where humble faith but at thy feete may fall, With my soules seruice, loue and life and all. Frget O Lord my workes of wickednes, Whereby my soule with sorrow is oppressed, And with the finger of thy holine, In mercy touch my spirit so distressed: And saue my life that draweth nigh to hell, Loue me a little and I shall be wll. Loue? no sweete Lord▪ mercy I craue no more▪ My sinnes are such, I dare not speake of loue, But in thy mery to thy loue restore, My hmble faith, that may but mercy proue: And  ppue that all the world may see, The  loue betwit my God and mee.
Oh call me home, and make me heare thy call, And heare thee so, that I may runne vnto thee, And hold me fast that I may neuer fall, But that my soule may euer ruice doo thee: Shew some good token, that the world may know, My soule is blest, whom thou hast loued so. And while I liue here in this wretched vale, Of fearefull danger of inernall death, Where earthly pleasures take those soules to sale, Which haue their bargaie in the hll beneath, Let my soules loue, and lif, and labour bee, To seeke my ioy, my loue and life in thee. Make me not rich lest I forget to thinke. From whence I haue the comfort of my hart, Nor in such want, let thy poore seruant sinke, That I be driuen to craue the needy part: Giue me but meanes the needy to relieue, To feede thy flocke, and not the Wolfe to grieue.
Let me not listen to the sinners songes, ut to the Psalmes thy holy saints doe sing, Nor let me follow tyrants in their wronges, But kisse the rocke, where righteousnes doth spring: Let not mine eye affect the outward part, But let me loue the vertue of the hart. And let my life be to behold thy loue, And let my loue be but to liue in thee, And so to liue that all the world may prue, The gratius good my God hath done for mee, To call my soule out of this world of woe, In faithfull loue to serue my Sauiour so. And when they see the blot of all their blame, To loue the worlde but all in wretched toyes, And doe confes with inward blushing shame, They are but sorrowes vnto heauenlie ioyes: They may with me forsake all wordly pleasure, And make thy loue an euerlasting treasure.
For Lord by thee we are, in thee we liue, And in thy loue the liuing cannot die, And since thy death, did our liues wholy giue, For thy loues sake shall we affection lie: No my deare Lord, let life be death to me, So I may die to liue in loue with thee. A ioyfull life were such a death indeede, From earthly paine to passe to heauenly pleasure, A ioyfull line for louing hearts to reade, To leaue the flesh to take the spirits treasure: Whose glorious sence vnto the sunne doth fall, That all is nothing to that all in all. And I (alas) of many thousand soules▪ Vnworthie most of his high worth to write, Who in his mercies true record inrowles, The louing substance of the soules delight: Must mercie crie, for scare my loues presuming, Of too high sence may be my souls consuming.
And with the teares of true repentant loue, Looking vpon the wonders of that woder, That  pfection may appoue, The  ised me of the world put vnder: wit as short to pne his praise, As  nghts in light of clearest dayes. And say but this in grace and glories height, Whe vertue loue doth liue fr uer crowned, Ad all the Hoa of heauen and heauens await, Vppon the highe  the heaus rnowned: Whom Saits and Angel teblng doo adore, To him alone be all praise cemore. All honour paise and glory euer bee, Vnto my ouing euerluing King, This king of life, who o hath lued mee, To giue my soule thi gratiou power to sing: In hart and mind, in man and ngels loue, All gloious glory be to God aboue. FINIS. Nicholas Britten.
