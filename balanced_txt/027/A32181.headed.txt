V. Item, It is likewise agreed, That for the Merchan∣dises which the Subjects of the King of Great Britain shall buy in Spain, or other the Kingdoms or Domi∣nions of the King of Spain, and shall carry in their own Ships, or in Ships hired or lent unto them, no new Customs, Toll, Tenths, Subsidies, or other Rights or Duties whatsoever shall be taken or encreased, other then those which in the like case the Natives them∣selves, and all other strangers are obliged to pay; and the Subjects aforesaid buying, selling and contracting for their Merchandises, as well in respect of the Prices, as of all Duties to be paid, shall enjoy the same pri∣viledges which are allowed to the natural Subjects of

And if any Officer, or any other in his name upon any pre∣tence whatsoever, in publick or secret, directly or in∣directly, shall ask or receive of any Merchant or other
person respectively; any sum of money or other thing, by the name of Right, Due, Stipend, Allowance, or Recompence (though it be by the way of voluntary Donative) more or otherwise then aforesaid, the said Officer or his Deputy being in such manner guilty and convict before a competent Judge in the Country where the Crime is committed, shall be put in Prison for three months, and shall pay thrice the value of the thing so received; of which the half shall be for the King of the Country where the Crime is committed, and the other half for the Denunciator, for the which he may sue his Right before any competent Judge of the Country where it shall happen. VII. That it shall be lawful for the Subjects of the King of Great Britain, to bring out, and carry into Spain, and all or any Lands and Dominions of the King of Spain (where heretofore they have used Trade and Commerce) and trade there with all kind of Mer∣chandise, Cloaths, Manufactures, and things of the Kingdom of Great Britain, and the Manufactures, Goods, Fruits, and kinds of the Islands, Towns and Plantations to him appertaining, and what shall have been bought by English Factors on this side, or farther on the other side of the Cape of Buena Esperanca, without being inforced to declare to whom, or for what price they sell their said Merchandise and Pro∣visions, or being molested for the errors of the Ma∣sters of the Ships, or others, in the entry of the Goods; and at their pleasure to return again out of the Domi∣nions
of the King of Spain, with all, or any Goods, Estates and Merchandise, to any of the Territories, Islands, Dominions and Countries of the King of England, or to any other Place, paying the Rights and Tributes mentioned in the antecedent Chapters; and the rest of all their lading which is not brought to Land, they may detain, keep and carry away in their said Ship or Ships, Vessel or Vessels again, without paying any Right or Imposition whatsoever for it, as if therewith they had never been within any Bay or Port of the Catholique King. And all the Goods, Estates, Merchandise, Ships or other Vessels, with any things introduced into the Dominions or Places of the Crown of Great Britain as Prizes, and judged for such in the said Dominions and Places, shall be taken for Goods and Merchandise of Great Britain, comprehen∣ded so by the intention of this Article. VIII. That the Subjects and Vassals of the Most Serene King of Great Britain may bring and carry to all and singular the Dominions of the King of Spain, any Fruits and Commodities of the East-Indies, it appear∣ing by testimony of the Deputies of the East-Indy Company in London, that they are of, or have come from the English Conquests, Plantations or Factories, with like priviledge, and according to what is allowed to the Subjects of the United Provinces, by the Royal Cedulas of Contravando bearing date the 27. of June, and the 3. of July 1663. and published on the 30. of June, and 4. of July the same year. And for what may
concern both the Indies, and any other Parts whatso∣ever, the Crown of Spain doth grant to the King of Great Britain and his Subjects, all that is granted to the United States of the Low-Countreys and their Subjects, in their Treaty of Munster 1648. Point for Point, in as full and ample manner as if the same were herein particularly inserted, the same Rules being to be observed whereunto the Subjects of the said Uni∣ted States are obliged, and mutual Offices of Friend∣ship to be performed from one side to the other. IX. That the Subjects of the King of Great Britain, tra∣ding, buying and selling in any of the Kingdoms, Go∣vernments, Islands, Ports or Territories of the said King of Spain, shall have, use, and enjoy all the Pri∣viledges and Immunities, which the said King hath granted and confirmed to the English Merchants that reside in Andaluzia, by his Royal Cedulas or Orders, dated the 19. day of March, the 26. day of June, and the 9. day of November 1645. His Catholique Maje∣sty by these presents reconfirming the same as a part of this Treaty between the two Crowns. And to the end that it be manifest to all, It is consented, That the said Schedules (as to the whole substance thereof) be passed and transferred to the body of the present Articles, in the name and favour of all and singular the Subjects of the King of Great Britain, residing and trading in any Places whatsoever within his Catholique Majesties Dominions.
X. That the Ships, or any other Vessels that shall be∣long to the King of Great Britain or his Subjects, Navi∣gating into the King of Spain's Dominions, or any of his Ports, shall not be visited by the Judges of Counterband, or by any other Officer or Person, by his own, or by any other Authority; nor shall any Souldiers, armed men or other Officers or Persons, be put on board any of the said Ships or Vessels; nor shall the Officers of the Custom-house of the one or the other Party, search in any Vessels or Ships belong∣ing to the People of the one or the other, which shall enter into their Regions, Dominions, or respective Ports, until their said Ships or Vessels are unladen, or until they have carried on shore all the Lading and Merchandise which they declare they resolve to disem∣barque in the said Port; nor shall the Captain, Master, or any other of the Company of the said Ships be im∣prisoned, or they or their Boats detained on shore; but in the interim, Officers of the Custom-house may be put on board the said Vessels or Ships, so they ex∣ceed not the number of three for each Ship, to see that no Goods or Merchandise be landed out of the said Ships or Vessels, without paying such Duties as by these Articles either Party is obliged to pay, which said Officers are to be without any charge to the Ship or Ships, Vessel or Vessels, their Commanders, Mariners, Company, Merchants, Factors, or Proprie∣tors. And when it happens that the Master or Owner
of any Ship shall declare that the whole Lading of his said Ship is to be discharged in any Port, the Entry of the said Lading shall be made in the Custom-house, af∣ter the usual manner; and if after the Entry made, any other Goods be found in the said Ship or Ships, more then what are contained in the said Entry, eight work∣ing dayes shall be allowed them on which they may work (which shall be reckoned from the day they be∣gan to unlade) to the end, that the concealed Goods may be entred, and the Confiscation of them prevented: And in case that in the time limited, the Entry or Manifestation of them shall not have been made, then such particular Goods only, which shall be found as aforesaid, though the unlading be not finished, shall be confiscated, and not any other; nor shall other trouble be given, or punishment inflicted on the Mer∣chant or Owner of the Ship; and when the Ships or Vessels are reladen, they may have freedom to go out again. XI. That the Ship or Ships appertaining to the one or the other King, or to their respective People and Subjects, that shall enter into any Ports, Lands or Dominions of the one or the other, and shall discharge any part of their Goods and Merchandises in any Port or Haven, being consigned with the rest to other Pla∣ces, within or without the said Dominions, shall not be obliged to register or pay the Rights of any other Goods or Merchandise, then of that which they shall
unlade in the said Port or Haven, nor be constaned to give Bond for the Goods they shall carry to other Pla∣ces, nor any other security, if it be not in case of Fe∣lony, Debt, Treason, or other capital Crime. XII. Whereas the one moity of the Custom of all For∣raign Goods and Merchandise imported into England, is allowed and returned back to the Importer, if the said Goods be exported out of the said Kingdom with∣in twelve moneths after their first Landing, upon Oath made that they are the same Goods which paid Cu∣stom inwards, and that if they be not re-shipt within the said twelve months, yet they may at all times be exported without paying any Custom or Duty out∣wards: It is therefore agreed, That if any the Sub∣jects of the King of Great Britain shall hereafter Land any Goods or Merchandise, of what growth or nature soever they be, in any of the Ports of his Ca∣tholique Majesty, and having entred them, and paid the Custom which by this Treaty ought to be paid, and shall afterwards desire to transport them, or any part of them, to any other Place whatsoever, for a better Market, it shall and may be lawful for him or them so to do freely, without paying or being demanded any other Custom or Duty at all for the same, he or they making Oath, if required thereunto, that they are the same Goods for which Custom was paid at their Landing; And in case that the Subjects, People and Inhabitants of the Dominions of either part shall un∣lade, or have in any City, Town or Village respectively,
any Goods, Merchandises, Fruits or Estates, and have paid the Customs due, according to what hath been declared, and after that, not being able to put them off, shall resolve to remit them to some other City, Town or Village of the said Dominions, they may not only do it without difficulty or impediment, and without paying other Rights then what were due at their Entry, but likewise the Custom or Rights shall not be paid again in any other part of the said Domi∣nions, bringing Certificates from the Officers of the Custom-house, that they were paid before in the due form. And the chief Farmers and Commissioners of the King of Spain's Rents in all Places, or some other Officer or Officers to be appointed for that purpose, shall at all times permit and suffer the Transportation of all such Goods and Merchandises from place to place, and give sufficient certificate to the Owners thereof, or their Assignes, of their having paid their Custom at their first Landing, whereby they may be carried to, and Landed at any other Port or Place of the said Jurisdiction, free from all Duties or Impediments whatsoever, as aforesaid, saving always the Right of any third Person. XIII. That it shall be lawful for the Ships belonging to the Subjects of the one or other King, to anchor in the Roads or Bays of either, without being con∣strained to enter into Port; and in case they be neces∣sitated to enter thereinto, either by distress of weather, fear of enemies, Pirates, or any other accident, in case
the said Ships be not bound to an Enemies Port, and carrying thither Contraband Goods (whereof with∣out some clear proof, they shall not be questioned) it shall be lawful for the said Subjects, to return to Sea freely when they please, with their Ships and Goods, so as they do not break bulk, or expose any thing to sale; and that when they cast anchor, or enter the Ports aforesaid, they be not molested or visited; and it shall suffice that in this case they shew their Pass∣ports or Sea-papers, which being seen by the respe∣ctive Officers of either King, the said Ships shall re∣turn freely to Sea without any molestation. XIV. And if any Ship or Ships belonging to the Subjects and Merchants of the one or the other, entring into Bayes, or in the open Sea, shall be encountred by the Ships of the said Kings, or of Privateers their Subjects; the said Ships, to prevent all disorders, shall not come within Canon-shot, but shall send their Long-Boat or Pinnace to the Merchant-Ship, and only two or three men on board, to whom the Master or Owner shall shew his Passports and Sea-Letters, according to the form which shall be inserted at the end of this Treaty, whereby not only the Ships Lading, but the place to which she belongs, and as well the Master and Owners name, as the name of the Ship may ap∣pear; by which means the quality of the Ship, and her Master or Owner will be sufficiently known, as also the Commodities she carries, whether they be Contraband, or not; to the which Passports and Sea-Letters, in∣tire
faith and credit shall be given, so much the rather, for that as well on the part of the King of England, as of the King of Spain, some Counter signes shall be given (if it shall be found necessary) whereby their authenticalness may the better appear, and that they may not be in any wise falsified. XV. If any prohibited Merchandise or Goods shall be exported from the Kingdoms, Dominions and Terri∣tories of either of the said Kings, by the respective People or Subjects of the one or the other, in such case the prohibited Goods shall be only confiscated, and not the other Goods; neither shall the Delinquent incur any other punishment, except the said Delin∣quent shall carry out from the respective Kingdoms or Dominions of the King of Great Britain, the proper Coin, Wooll, or Fullers-earth of the said Kingdoms, or shall carry out of the respective Kingdoms or Do∣minions of the said King of Spain, any Gold or Sil∣ver, wrought or unwrought; in either of which cases, the Laws of the respective Countreys are to take place. XVI. That it shall be lawful for the People and Subjects of both Kings, to have access to the respective Ports of the one and the other, and there remain, and depart again with the same freedom, not only with their Ships, and other Vessels for Trade and Commerce,
but also with their other Ships fitted for War, armed, and disposed to resist and engage the Enemy, and ar∣riving by stress of weather to repair their Ships, or furnish themselves with Provisions; so that entring willingly, they be not so numerous, that they give just occasion of suspition, to which end they are not to ex∣ceed the number of Eight, nor continue in their Ha∣vens, nor about their Ports, longer time then they shall have just cause, for the repair of their Ships, to take in Provisions or other necessary things, much less be the occasion of interrupting the free Commerce, and coming in of other Ships, of Nations in Amity with either King; and when an unusual number of Men of War, by accident shall come unto any Port, it shall not be lawful for them to come into the said Ports or Havens, not having first obtained permission of the King unto whom the said Ports do belong, or the Go∣vernours of the said Ports, if they be not forced there∣into by stress of weather or other necessity, to avoid the danger of the Sea, and in such case they shall pre∣sently acquaint the Governour or chief Magistrate of the Place with the cause of their coming; nor shall they remain there any longer time then the said Go∣vernour or Magistrate shall think convenient, or do any act of Hostility in such Ports, that may prove of prejudice to the one or the other of the said Kings.
XVII. That neither the said King of Great Britain, nor the King of Spain, by any Mandate general, nor particu∣lar, nor for any cause whatsoever, shall Embarque or detain, hinder or take for his respective service, any Merchant, Master of a Ship, Pilot or Mariner their Ships, Merchandise, Cloaths or other Goods belong∣ing unto the one or the other, in their Ports or Waters, if it be not that either of the said Kings, or the Persons to whom the Ships belong, be first advertised thereof, and do agree thereunto; Provided that this shall not be construed to hinder or interrupt the ordinary course of Justice and Law in either Country. XVIII. That the Merchants and Subjects of the one and the other King, their Factors and Servants, as also their Ships, Masters and Mariners, may as well going as coming, upon Sea and other Waters, as in the Havens and Ports of the one and the other respectively, carry and use all kind of Arms, Defensive and Offensive, without being obliged to register them, as also upon Land to carry and use them for their defence, accor∣ding to the custom of the Place. XIX. That the Captains, Officers and Mariners of the Ships belonging to the People and Subjects of either
Party, may not commence an Action, nor hinder or bring trouble upon their own Ships, their Captains, Of∣ficers or Mariners in the respective Kingdoms, Domi∣nions, Lands, Countries or Places of the other, for their Wages or Salaries, or under any other pretence. Nor may they put themselves, or be received, by what pretext or colour soever, into the Service or Protection of the King of England, or King of Spain, or their Arms; but if any controversie happen be∣tween Merchants and Masters of Ships, or between Masters and Mariners, the composing thereof shall be left to the Consul of the Nation, but after such man∣ner, as he who shall not submit to the Arbitrement, may appeal to the ordinary Justice of the Place where he is subject. XX. And to the end that all Impediments be taken away, and that the Merchants and Adventurers of the Kingdoms of Great Britain be permitted to return to Brabant, Flanders, and other the Provinces of the Low-Countries, under the Jurisdiction of the King of Spain; Forasmuch as it hath been thought convenient, that all, and any the Laws, Edicts, and Acts by which the Importation of Cloth, or any other Woollen Ma∣nufacture, of what kind soever, dyed, or undyed, raill'd, or unmill'd, into Flanders, or the other Pro∣vinces, hath been prohibited, be revoked and disan∣null'd; and that if any Right, Tribute, Imposition, Charge or Money, hath been, with permission, or otherwise, put upon Cloaths, or any of the aforesaid Woollen Manufactures so imported (except the anci∣ent
Tribute upon every piece of Cloth, and propor∣tionably upon every other Woollen Manufacture, agreeable to the ancient Treaties and Agreements between the then Kings of England, and the Dukes of Burgundy, and Governours of the Low-Countries) the same should be altogether void, and no such Tri∣bute or Imposition from henceforth imposed, or put upon the said Clothes or Manufactures, for no cause or pretext whatsoever; And that all the English Mer∣chants, trading in any of the said Provinces, their Factors, Servants, or Commissioners, should enjoy from henceforward, all the Priviledges, Exemptions, Immunities and Benefits, which formerly have been agreed and given by the aforesaid ancient Treaties and Agreements, between the then Kings of England, and the Dukes of Burgundy, and Governours of the Low-Countries: It is therefore agreed, That Deputies shall be named by the King of Great Britain, who meeting with the Marquess of Castelrodrigo, or the Governour of those Provinces for the time being, or any other Ministers of the King of Spain, sufficiently authorised in this behalf, shall friendly Treat and Conclude here∣upon; and also such further Priviledges, Immunities, and necessary Exemptions, suitable to the present state of Affairs, shall be granted for the encouragement of the said Merchants and Adventurers, and for the se∣curity of their Trade and Commerce, as shall be agreed upon in a special Treaty, that shall be made between both the Kings, touching this Particular.
XXI. The Subjects and Inhabitants of the Kingdoms and Dominions of the Most Serene Kings of Great Bri∣tain and Spain respectively, shall with all security and liberty, Sail to, and Traffick, in all the Kingdoms, Estates, or Countries, which are or shall be in Peace, Amity, or Neutrality with the one or the other. XXII. And they shall not be disturbed or disquieted in that liberty, by the Ships or Subjects of the said Kings respectively, by reason of the hostilities which are or may be hereafter between either of the said Kings, and the aforesaid Kingdoms, Countries, and States, or any of them, which shall be in Friendship or Neutrality with the other. XXIII. And in case that within the said Ships respectively, be found by the abovesaid means, any Merchandise here under mentioned, being of Contraband, and Prohibited, they shall be taken out and confiscated, before the Admiralty, or other competent Judges; but for this reason, the Ship, and the other free and al∣lowed Commodities which shall be found therein, shall in no wise be either seized or confiscated.
XXIV. Moreover, for better prevention of the differences which might arise touching the meaning of forbidden Merchandise, and of Contraband; It is declared and agreed, That under this name shall be comprehended all Fire-Arms, as Ordnance, Muskets, Mortar-pieces, Petards, Bumbs, Granadoes, Fire-crancels, Fire-balls, Musket-rests, Bandeliers, Gunpowder, Match, Salt-peter, and Bullets; likewise under the name of forbidden Merchandise, are understood all other Arms, as Pikes, Swords, Pots, Helmets, Backs, and Breasts, Halberds, Javelins, and such like Ar∣mour; Under this name is likewise forbidden the transportation of Souldiers, Horses, their Harnasses, Cases of Pistols, Holsters, Belts, and other Furniture, formed and composed for the use of War. XXV. Likewise, to prevent all manner of dispute and con∣tention, It is agreed, That under that name of for∣bidden Merchandise, and of Contraband, shall not be comprehended Wheat, Rye, Barley, or other Grains, or Pulse, Salt, Wine, Oyle, and generally whatsoever belongs to the sustaining and nourishing of life, but they shall remain free, as likewise all other Merchan∣dises not comprehended in the preceding Article; and the transportation of them shall be free and permit∣ted, although it be to the Towns and Places of Ene∣mies,
unless such Towns and Places be besieged, block∣ed up, or surrounded. XXVI. It is also agreed, That whatsoever shall be found laden by the Subjects or Inhabitants of the Kingdoms and Dominions of either of the said Kings of England and Spain aboard the Ships of the Enemies of the other, though it be not forbidden Merchandise, shall be con∣fiscated, with all things else which shall be found within the said Ships without exception or reserve. XXVII. That the Consul which hereafter shall reside in any of the Dominions of the King of Spain, for the help and protection of the Subjects of the King of Great Britain, shall be named by the King of Great Britain, and he so named, shall have and exercise the same power and authority in the execution of his charge, as any other Consul hath formerly had in the Dominions of the said King of Spain; and in like manner the Spanish Consul residing in England, shall enjoy as much authority as the Consuls of any other Nation have hi∣therto enjoyed in that Kingdom. XXVIII. And that the Laws of Commerce that are obtained by Peace, may not remain unfruitful, as would fall out if the Subjects of the King of Great Britain,
when they go to, come from, or remain in the Domi∣nions or Lordships of the King of Spain, by reason of their Commerce or other business, should be molested for case of Conscience; therefore that the Commerce be secure, and without danger, as well upon Land as at Sea, the said King of Spain shall provide, that the Subjects of the said King of Great Britain shall not be agrieved contrary to the Laws of Commerce, and that none of them shall be molested or disturbed for their Conscience, so long as they give no publique scandal or offence; and the said King of Great Britain shall, likewise provide, for the same reasons, that the Subjects of the King of Spain shall not be molested or disturbed for their Conscience against the Laws of Commerce, so long as they give no publique scandal or offence. XXIX. That the People and Subjects respectively of one Kingdom, in the Dominions, Territories, Regions or Colonies of the other, shall not be compelled to sell their Merchandise for Brass-metal-Coin, or ex∣change them for other Coin or things, against their will; or having sold them, to receive the payment in other species, then what they bargained for, not∣withstanding any Law or other Custom contrary to this Article.

And
it shall be permitted to the People and Subjects of ei∣ther King, in the respective. Places where they shall reside, to keep their Books of Accompt, Traffick and Correspondence in what Language they please, in English, Spanish, Dutch, or any other, the which shall not be molested, or subject to any Inquisition. And whatsoever else hath been granted by either Party, concerning this particular, to any other Nation, shall be understood likewise to be granted here. XXXII.

DON PHILIP, By the Grace of God, King of Castile, Leon, Arragon, the two Sicilies, Jerusalem, Portugal, Na∣varre, Granado, Toledo, Valencia, Gali∣cia, Majorca, Sivilla, Sardinia, Cordoua, Corsega, Murica, Jaen, the Algarves, Algesira, Gibral∣tar, the Islands of the Canaries, the East and West In∣dies, Islands, and firm Land of the Ocean Sea, Arch-Duke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, Brabant, and Milan, Earl of Haspurg, Flanders, Tiroll, and Barcelona, Lord of Biscay and Molina, &c.
WHereas on the behalf of you Richard An∣thony, Consul of the English Nation, for your self, and in the Name of the Sub∣jects of the King of Great Britain, it hath been shew∣ed unto me, That by vertue of the Peace which is concluded in this and that Realm, you do reside and trade in Andaluzia, and specially in the Cities of Si∣vill, St. Lucar, Cadiz, and Malaga, desiring me to be pleased to confirm unto you the priviledges, ex∣emptions and faculties which do belong unto you as well by the Articles of the said Peace, as by the Confirmations thereof, and other Favours and Graces which my Lord and Father of glorious memory did grant unto you, and all such others which have been given you by the Crowns of my Realms of Castile and Rortugal, and to command that they may be in, and for all things observed and accomplished unto you without any limitation, and for further assurance to grant them anew unto you, with the qualities, am∣plitudes and declarations which shall be most conveni∣ent for you; and to set Penalties upon such as shall contradict, and not observe them unto you; and to the end it may be known what they are, to grant them Copies thereof, or of that which my favour shall be; And I taking the Premises into consideration; and be∣cause for the occasions which I have for my Wars, you have offered to serve me with 2500. Duckets of Sil∣ver, to be paid one Thousand ready money, and the remaining one Thousand five Hundred in the Moneth of April of this Year; whereof the Licentiate Fran∣cis Moreno, which in reversion of Don Anthony de
Campo Redondoy Rio, Knight of the Order of Santi∣ago, one of my Council and Chamber, and of the Treasury in your name, and by vertue of your power did acknowledge a Writing of Obligation in form before John Cortez de la Cruz, my Notary, I do hold it for good; And by these Presents of my own moti∣on, and certain knowledge, and Royal and absolute Power, which I in this behalf will make use of, and do use as an absolute King and Lord, not acknowledging any Superior in matters Temporal, do confirm and approve the Priviledges, Exemptions, and Faculties which do belong unto you as well by the Articles of the said Peace, as by the Confirmation thereof; and also the other favours and graces which my Lord and Father did grant unto you, and others whatsoever, which have been given by my Crowns of Castile and Portugal unto the said Subjects, in and for all things as therein, and every thing and part thereof is specified, contained, and declared, to the end they may be firm, stable, and of value, and be observed, kept and ac∣complished unto you: For my deliberate intent and will is, that all those of the said Nation shall enjoy thereof without any limitation, in such manner, that, during the time the said Englishmen shall reside in Andaluzia, neither you nor they may be charged with any Office or publick Charge, nor Council, Tutor∣ship, Curatorship, Receivers or Treasurers, although they be of Customers and Millions, or other Services which concern my Royal Treasury; and much less they may demand of you any Loans or donations, or take from you any Rights, or your Rents, Horses, or Slaves: And to do you the more favour or grace ac∣cording
to that which is agreed by the said Peace, I do will and promise that you shall and may deal and trade freely, and sell your Merchandise and Fruits, and buy those of my Realms, and carry them forth, ob∣serving that which is ordained and commanded by the Laws and Statutes which make mention thereof, and paying to my Royal Treasury the Duties or Customs which ought to be paid, prohibiting, as I do prohibit and command, not to take from you by force any Merchandises, Wheat, or Barley, although it be for the making ready or furnishing my Armies, Fleets, or Gallions, nor for Purveyors or Stewards; and the Priviledges are to be concerning the Wheat and Bar∣ley according to the Tun; and concerning the other things and Merchandises, as you shall conclude and agree: but they may not take them out of your Pos∣session until they have paid for them, unless for the same there be leave given, that they do not molest and trouble you. And forasmuch as many of you do treat to bring into the Ports of Andalusia, the City of Sivil, and other places, great quantity of New-found∣land-Fish, and other sorts of dry and salted Fish, be∣cause they are Victuals which are very necessary; and that you have been and are put to great Charges, and are much troubled, I do will and command to be kept the Ordinance of the City of Sivil, whereby it is or∣dained, that those which come in with dry or salted Fish, there shall not be any Price or Rate set upon them, but they shall be permitted to sell at such a Price as they shall think good; and it shall not be ne∣cessary to manifest them any more then unto my Offi∣cers which receive my Royal Rents: and if the Ships
wherein the said Fish is brought be great Ships, that they cannot go up the River, and that the same be put into Barques or Lighters, the Judge of the Admi∣ralty nor any other person may not put any Waiters or Keepers into the Barques or Lighters at the charge of the Owners of them. And I do also command, That if the said Fish shall appear to be rotten, and that it cannot be spent, that it be burnt, or thrown into the Sea; and that for this cause there shall not be any Cause or Action commen∣ced against the Owners thereof, or persons which shall sell it, nor they shall not be imprisoned, nor informed against: And forasmuch as the Administers of the Customs, and others of divers duties which are recei∣ved for the Fruits and Merchandises, do use when any body doth inform, to have the person Imprisoned which sheweth himself to be party, whereby happeneth to men of Trade great discredit, charges, and vexati∣ons; My Will is, and I do command, that in the said Information there shall be only proceeded against the Merchandises, and not against the persons; but they shall be permitted (as I do permit them) to make, and they shall make their defences in the said Vexation. And forasmuch also, as according to an Article of the said Peace, which maketh mention of Matters in Re∣ligion, notwithstanding that in some Suits they should declare whether they be Roman Catholiques or not, excusing themselves to give faith to others which they take as parties or as witnesses; I do also command, That concerning this matter there be not done, nor there shall not be done, any thing with those which are born in the said Realm,
but only that the said Condition be kept and accom∣plished, and that no such questions be put unto them gi∣ving unto the Oaths which they shall take in Judgement Court, and without, the same faith and credit which should be given in case they were Spaniards; and herein you shall not receive any trouble or molestation; nor there shall not be any grievance done unto you: And whereas for the justification of some causes, the Judges and Justices do pretend that the Merchants of the said Nation should exhibite Books of their con∣tractions or dealings; I do will and command, that the Books of the Merchants of the said Nation shall not be taken out of their hands for any cause whatsoever, but they shall keep and shew them in their houses, to take out the parcel which shall be appointed, and others shall not be demanded of them, nor there shall not be any other Papers taken from them, upon pe∣nalty that he which shall do here against, shall be pu∣nished according to Law. And forasmuch as the Merchants do dispatch the Merchandise from the Custom-house of the said City of Sivil of all Duties, and because there are many which do make up a sheet, which is Subscribed and Signed by all the Officers, and remaineth in the hand of the Alcayde of the Custom-house; for that by vertue thereof, the Merchandises are permitted to go forth, which are in Fardels, Packs, Trunks and Cases; and afterwards when they have taken them forth, and put them into their Houses and Warehouses, the chief Keeper of the Custom-house, and the Officers of the half per Cent. do visit the House and Goods, troubling and molesting them, demanding of them
the dispatches, it seeming unto them, that they may derain them, because they left the dispatch in the hands of the said Alcayde of the Custom-house; I do prohibit and command, that the houses of the said Merchants shall not be visited, nor the dispatches shall not nor may not be demanded of them, in regard they have them not in their hands; and this is to be understood, and is understood of houses which are within the Walls of the said City; and to the end it may be known to you, which are of the English Nati∣on, there is to be delivered unto you Copies of the said Priviledges and Exemptions which do concern you, and which were granted unto you, as well by the Ar∣ticles of Peace, as by any other manner. And for exe∣cution and accomplishment of all the Premisses, I do command those of my Council, and those of my Councils, Assemblies and Tribunals of my Court, and the Presidents and Judges of my Audiences, Alcaydes, and Officers of my House and Court, and Chanceries, and the Regent and Judge of the Court of Degrees of the City of Sivil, and chief Alcaldes of the Precincts thereof, and all the Cor∣rigidors, Assistants, and Governours, chief Justices, and Ordinaries, as well in the said Cities of Sivil, Ca∣diz, Malaga, and St. Lucar de Barameda, as of all other Cities, Towns and Places, of these my Realms and Dominions, and all other Judges and Justices whatso∣ever, of what quality or condition soever they may be, whom principally or incidentally may concern in any manner the accomplishment or performance of that which is contained in this Patent, that presently so soon as they shall be by vertue thereof required, or the Copy thereof Signed by a Notary publick, that there
be thereunto given as much faith, as unto the Origi∣nal; and that every one in the place where it shall con∣cern him do observe, and accomplish, and cause the same to be observed, accomplished, and executed, in and for all things as therein is contained, and they shall not in all nor in part put upon you any impedi∣ments, nor any other difficulties or doubts, nor do any thing against the tenor and form thereof, nor consent or give way that it be interpreted, limited or suspended in all or in part, or that to the contrary be given any Sedidas, provisions, or other dispatches; but for ob∣servation thereof, in the place which shall concern eve∣ry one, they shall give order, and ordain to deliver unto you those which shall be necessary: And for more firm∣ness and validity of the favour and grace which by this my Patent I do grant you, and that at all times this favour may be certain and sure unto you, you are to keep or have a Judge Conservator in Andalusia, espe∣cially in the said Cities of Sivil, Malaga, Cadiz, and St. Lucar de Barameda, unto whom I am to give suffi∣cient Commission for keeping and accomplishing the said Priviledges, Liberties and Exemptions, who shall constrain and compell all and whatsoever persons, of what sort or quality they may be that shall concern the said Nation, as well those which shall be Defendants accused, as those which shall be Plaintiffs, although the persons which shall accuse them, and which shall be accused by them, have private Judges, as well by con∣sent as agreement which they may have made by pre∣heminence or priviledge which they hold, to the end the said Judge Conservator may onely take know∣ledge privately of the said Courts, and not any other
Judge or Tribunall, although it be by way of excess or notorious Justice, or in any other matter or form, which Judge Conservator is now Doctor Don Francisco de Ver∣gara, Judge of my Court de les Grados, of the City of Sevill, the time that he shall assist therein, and in his ab∣sence the Licentiate Don Francisco de Modrano, Judge of the same Court, who for the suits which shall be com∣menced in the said Cities of Cadiz, Malaga, & St. Lucar, is to Subdelegate his Conservatorship, in the person which by the said Nation shall be propounded or na∣med, that he may effect the same to the conclusion, and they shall be referred unto him to be determined: and of that which he shall determine, the Appeale is to be made to my Council, and not to any other Court. And forasmuch as my will is, that every one in his time shall have primative Commission, and Jurisdicti∣on to protect and defend you concerning all the con∣tents of this my Patent, that all the same may be kept and accomplished in the form which I do offer the same unto you, I have found good to charge, as by these presents I do charge them with the protection and de∣fence hereof: & I do command them to see or peruse this my Patent, and the qualities, conditions, preheminen∣cies, and amplifications therein contained, and to cause all the same to be kept, accomplished and executed, in such form and manner, and according as therein is contained and declared, without consenting or giving way, that in all, or in part there be made unto you any doubt or difficulty, and before the said Don Francisco de Vergara, or in his absence before the said Francis de Medrano (and not before any other Judge) privately
in the first instance, are to pass, and be followed all the causes and suits, which concerning the premises, or any thing or part thereof shall be moved and caused, and the execution and punishment of those which shall not be obedient; For my will is, that the knowledge and determination of all the contents in this my Patent, is in all things privately to concern, and shall concern them; proceeding in all things against those which shall be culpable, and executing for the same the pe∣nalties which are mentioned by law, reserving as I do reserve, the appellations which shall be put in upon their acts and sentences, to my Council, and not any other Court, without that any of other my Councils, Tribunals, Courts, Chanceries, or any other Judges or Justices of my Realms or Dominions, of whatsoever qua∣lity they be, may meddle, or shall meddle therewith, or in the use or exercise of the Jurisdiction privative in the said first instance, which by this my Patent I do grant unto them, by way of excess, appellation, or any other recourse or manner; the which and every of them, I do inhibit and hold for inhibited the knowledge thereof, and do declare them for incompetent Judges thereof: for which and every thing, and part thereof, I do give them the most sufficient power, and most am∣ple Commission, which according to Law is required and necessary, with the incidences and dependencies, annexities; and after them the said English Nation of the said City of Sivil, may name in the said Commis∣sion one of the Judges of the said Audience, which the said Nation shall chuse: And I do command the Presi∣dent, and those of my Council of the Chamber, that presenting before them their nomination (the case
happening) to make void the said Commission, by promotion or vacation of the said Don Francisco de Vergara, and Don Francis de Medrano or to dispatch it, in any other manner, by Ordinary to him that shall be therein nominated, in the form according, and as by this my Patent is declared. And that it may be the better accomplished, I do from this time give them power and authority, that they may Subdelegate, and they shall Subdelegate this Commission, for the business and Suits which shall be offered in the said Cities of Cadiz, Malaga, and St. Lucar de Berameda, in the person which by you shall be propounded unto them, that they may substantiate them for a conclusion, and remit the Suits and Causes unto them to be determined, in such manner as they shall find good and convenient, for the security of that which is contained in this my Pa∣tent.
