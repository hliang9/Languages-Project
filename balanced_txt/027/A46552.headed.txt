LICENSED, April 24: 1689.
THE PREFACE TO THE READER. THE weight of this illustri∣ous Subject might have re∣quired a greater Ʋndertaker, and made me have kept at an awfull di∣stance, whilst the most celebra∣ted Pens of Europe had interwoven and enamell'd the Birth and Rising, Glories of so great a Prince, with all the Rhetorical and Heroick Accents and Expressions that are capable of giving Life and Fire to the Minds of Men, and raising their Souls to a highth capable of knowing the Centre of true Greatness; but with humble submission, not finding any forward in so invaluable an Enterprize, I, though unworthy, have presumed to
make this Essay, hoping it will not be taken ill, since this, at least, is the Ground-work, upon which the most a∣spiring Historian must build, when he consults the Golden Rolls of Fame to raise a Pyramid of lasting Honour to the Memories of the World's un∣doubted Worthies. In this Book, though small to appearance, you may find things as vast in Extent as Vir∣tue and Valour can enlarge them; and when I tell you it is the Compendium of the Birth and Actions of the Great and Renowned Prince of the House of Orange, with what more especial∣ly relates to his Redeeming us from Popery and Slavery, by his generous Expedition, Valour, and Conduct, I might be silent, since the World is sufficiently sensible of what I farther intend; yet that Posterity may not forget so great a Deliverance, it is fit that it should be Recorded till Time is swallowed up in Eternity. You have, Reader, in this Book an
Account of the illustrious Birth of a Prince, born to be the Protectour of the true Religion, and the Support (next the Almighty Arm) of Christia∣nity, coming nearest to its primitive Purity, with his Advancement to early Honours, and his memorable Actions from time to time, with the various dangers and hazards to which he has exposed himself, for the Repose of Christendom, but more especially for the securing and promoting the Pro∣testant Religion. You have likewise a Discovery of Popish Cruelties, in the wretched State and Condition of the Protestants in France, under the late Persecution, from which you may gather what we might have expected and suffered, had not this great Prince at so much Cost, hazard of his Person, and indefatigable Labour and Indu∣stry, dispell'd with the Rays of his early and glorious Success, the cloudy Tempest that was breaking over our Heads; and to be brief, you have an
Account of all that has memorably pas∣sed from his Birth to this day, and that more particularly in England, upon the ever-to-be-remembered Occa∣sion of his coming over as our Prote∣ctour and Deliverer, with the inde∣fatigable Industry he has successfully used to infatuate and defeat the De∣signs of our Enemies, and the Re∣turns he has found from a sensible and gratefull People, and especially the Wisdom of the Nation Assembled in Parliament, in Proclaiming and Crowning him, together with his Royal Consort, King and Queen of England, &c. with the manner of the performance, and what else can be re∣quired to set forth so illustrious an History, the Subject of which may some Angel sound with a golden Trumpet to the utmost Kingdoms of the Earth: which is the Wish of Your humble Servant, S. J.
An Historical Account of the Life and memorable Acti∣ons of the most Illustrious Wil∣liam Henry, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Prince of Orange, &c. WHen we undertake to Write of illustrious Persons, whose great Actions are sufficiently known to the World, and whose Ver∣tues and Candour have placed them up∣on a Pinacle of Fame, it is then that Rhe∣torical Strains, or flattering Applause, is altogether to be laid aside, as vain and useless; for true Diamonds require not the Art to set them off, like Coun∣terfeits, but relying upon their proper Lustre make their value known, and shine in a kind of careless Glory; where∣fore considering the Illustrious Subject I am here to handle, waving elaborate Circumstances, and Expressions not great∣ly
pertinent to History, or Matters of this kind; my Care and Endeavour shall be to keep to Truth and Fact, and as much as in me lies to give a satisfactory Ac∣count of the Birth and glorious Actions of a Prince, whose Fame has travell'd with the Sun. WIlliam Henry, of the Illustrious House of Nassau, our present Sovereign, descended from that re∣nowned German Family, that has been e∣ver Famous, and to which the Empire and all Christendom has been so much be∣holden, Son to William of Nassau, Prince of Orange, by the Royal Princess Mary, Daughter to Charles I. King of Eng∣land, &c. was Born on the 14th. of No∣vember, in the year of our Lord, 1650. his Father dying the preceding Month, after he had been Married about nine Years, and done Actions worthy of his high Birth, in the Four and Twentieth year of his Age, leaving this hopefull, Issue to dispell the Clouds of Sorrow that began to spread themselves over most European Courts, upon notice of a Death so unexpected, and a Loss so im∣portant. This great Prince at his Baptism had
for Godfathers the Lords States of Holland, Zealand, and the Cities of Amsterdam, Delf, and Leyden, receiving the Name of William Henry; and as he increased in years, under the Care of the indulgent Princess, and such as were appointed to attend and wait upon him, he gave early hope of what hath since been sufficiently manifested. At five years of Age he came to visit his Uncle, King Charles II who then was at Breda, preparing for England, to take Possession of the Thrones and Kingdoms, so long detained from him; where the King expressed his extraordinary satisfa∣ction to see the Prince his Nephew, and highly welcomed him; and soon after the Estates General, having a particular Au∣dience of the King, recommending the firmness and fidelity of that Republick to his Interest, &c. his Majesty in the most obliging Terms replyed, That the Interest, if no other Motives should induce him to it, of two Persons so nearly allied to him, as the Princess Royal his Sister, and the Prince of Orange his Nephew, who live in the Estate as part of it, must unavoidably endear it to him. However, there were many Reasons of State, which obliged him to make with those Provinces a most
strict Alliance: And now the King's De∣parture for England being at hand, the E∣states General named Mr. De Gent. Depu∣ty of Guelderland, Guelderwagen of Hol∣land, and Lampsins of Zeland, to wait upon the Queen of Bohemia, who was then with the King, and the Duke of York, and Gloucester, who Lodged in the Extroardinary Ambassador's House, to complement them on the Re-establish∣ment of the King, and the Revolution of the Affairs of England; and at the same time Mr. Renswonde of Utreicht, Ripperdo of Hengelo, of Overysel, together with Isbrants of Groning, were deputed to the same Office, by the Princess Royal, and the Prince of Orange. The King being treated by the E∣states General at the Hague, he sitting at the middle of the Table-head, had on the Right Hand the Queen of Bohemia, on the Left the Princess Royal, and there the Prince was present, a Seat be∣ing placed on purpose for him to distin∣guish his Character, though in his ten∣der years, from Lords of great Rank and Quality, who were present at that splendid Entertainment; and this order was observed whenever he Dined pub∣lickly with the King, which he frequent∣ly
did, as well at the Hague, as at other places; and when the King left the Hague, his Highness, accompanied with Prince William of Nassau, Governour of Friezeland, with sundry Nobles and Gentlemen, went before him towards the Ships, on which, together with his Train, he was to embark for England; and when he went on Board he was con∣ducted to the Admiral's Ship by the Queen of Bohemia, the Princess Royal, and the Prince of Orange, to whom at his Departure he returned most obli∣ging Thanks, and endearing Expressions of Affection, which ended not but with his Life. These were the remarkable Passages (as I may term them) in the Infancy of this great Prince: But it is time to go on to those of his riper years. A prevailing Faction growing up in the United Provinces, managed by Statesmen that ambitiously strove to en∣gross the Power, and enrich themselves as much as in them lay, to overshadow the Brightness of this Rising Sun, to eclipse the Family that had laid the ve∣ry Foundation of the State, and by which Providence would have it sup∣ported, though at the same time France pressed them with a prevailing Army.
Amongst those of the Faction, the De Wits were very forward, for which, and some underhand Practices against the Person of the Prince, the two Brothers, John and Cornelius, soon after felt the Rage of the People, who out them to pieces; however those that remained struggled to keep themselves in Power; and the better to doe it, disbanded their experi∣enced Forces and Officers, putting in their steads the Sons of Burgher-masters, and such others as they supposed would stickle for them against the Interest, of this Rising Prince; however it lasted not, for within a while the French taking more effectually the advantage of this oversight, swept away divers of the Frontier Towns, and entered deep, with great ravagement and devastation, into some of the Provinces, which made the People consider of a General to lead their Forces; whereupon in the begin∣ning of the year 1672. the Prince was invested with the Titles of Captain, and Admiral General of the United Provin∣ces, Honours his Ancestors had a long time meritoriously enjoyed to the extra∣ordinary contentment of the People, by having (next under God) been the chief means of reducing those Provinces from
Slavery into a State; when his Highness, Marching at the Head of a few Troups, made good his Post at Nienkop against the violent Attacks and Incroachments of the French, and so gallantly ordered Affairs, that he made them retire with loss. Upon the Ravage the French had made on the Frontiers, the people of the Province of Holland grew discontented and displeased with their Magistrates, at∣tributing the Misfortune to their neglect; so that those of Dort broke into open Mutiny, demanding to see the Mega∣zines; but being put off, or refused, sus∣pecting some Treachery, they resolved to have the Prince made Stateholder, nor would they by any means be ap∣peased, till he was sent for, and confir∣med in that Dignity, which being pas∣sed into an Act, great joy ensued amongst the People; and soon after the other Cities and Provinces consented to the like Investment, and his Highness took his Place in the Hall of Audience, with the Ceremonies the Dignity required. Upon these Proceedings, and his High∣ness's returning o the Army at Bode∣grove, the Face of things were changed, and the late drooping Provinces seemed to take new Life and Vigour; the French
were manfully resisted, and the Bishop of Munster forced from the Walls of Groning by a slender Garison, after the Loss of a great part of his Army; so that now the Prince being very power∣full in the Hearts of the people, the De Wits were sacrificed to the popular Fury, for conspiring against him & the Govern∣ment, for the Burghers and others ta∣king Arms, and breaking in upon them, where Cornelius was imprisoned by the Magistrates, and his Brother John at that time come to see him, they dragged them thence with great Cries, and after a miserable mis-usage, hung them up by the Heels in the Market-place, and cut∣ting them to pieces, sold their Joints and Flesh by piece-meal, at great Rates, which were carried away by the Buyers in a Triumph of Revenge. The De Wits falling thus from their highth of Honour, Min Heer Fagel was made Pentionary with the Prince's ap∣probation; and indeed deservedly, having been the first, when only Pentioner of Haerlem, to open peoples Eyes upon the inevitable Ruine that must have atten∣ded upon the continuance of the De Wits Ministry, and thereupon the Elector of Brandenburgh wrote a most obliging Let∣ter
to the States, to let them know he had received the News of the Prince's Advancement and Settlement in the Honours and Dignities of his Ancestors, and to assure them of his Friendship and good Will; so that the Provinces within themselves being settled, it was thought high time to oppose the Insults of the French; whereupon the Prince marched to dislodge their Out-gaurds, and came upon them so unexpectedly and with so much terrour as they lay at the Seige of Utreicht, that he beat them into their Trenches, and took several Prisoners of Note, which he commended to be kindly used, and sent to Amsterdam: And now there being a Rumour that some Attempt was designed against his Highness's Person, by some private means; so far it wrought, that from that time he has been entreated to accept of a Guard for his Person, and although the season was far advanced, he laid Seige to Woerden, a considerable Garison, held by the French, to the relief of which the Duke of Luxemburgh hasted, and was the first time obliged to retire with con∣siderable loss; but returning with a great Re-inforcement, as the Toown was about to Capitulate, after an obstinate
Fight, and many kill'd on both sides, he put a succour of 300 Men into it, and with considerable Loss retreated. This new recruit encouraging the Garison, and the Prince having lost in the Action Collonel Suylesteyme (who bore the fury of the Attack, and faught valiantly, but being over-powered, and refusing Quar∣ter, was killed,) as likewise other brave Men, and now the Weather more in∣commoding his Army than the Enemy, he thought it convenient to rise from be∣fore it, and drew off without any mo∣lestation. After these Proceedings, his Highness held a Council of War, and having gi∣ven necessary Orders, marched to Rosen∣dale, where the General Rendezvouz were appointed, and there having mu∣stered an Army to the number of 24000. he took his March towards the Country of Liege, and obliged the Count de Du∣ras to retire to Stassemburgh with the Army he then had under his Command, being desirous, if it might conveniently be, to give him Battel: but understan∣ding that the Count frequently shifted his Quarters, in a kind of a retiring man∣ner, the Prince after investing Tongeren with his own and such Spanish Forces as
had joyned with him; and by that means not being able to draw him to a Battel, he re-passed the Meuse, and after some longer attendence to that purpose, he marched to Maestreicht, and sent a Party of Horse and Foot to take in the Castle of Valcheren, which soon surrendred up∣on discretion; and there they found a considerable Megazine, especially of Forage: And after that his Highness ha∣ving invested Charleroy without success, by reason of the sharpness of the Wea∣ther, and taken Birch, an important Place, defended by three Captains, and 300. Soldiers, Demolishing the Town, he marched through Brabant, and put his Soldiers into Winter Quarters. During these Transactions, the French in considerable Parties taking the advan∣tage of the hard Frost, marched over the Ice, and made some inconsiderable spoil in the Villages, but upon the ap∣proach of his Highness they retired in disorder, with considerable loss; and had the Passes been defended as the States directed, most of them had peri∣shed in the Waters, by reason of the sudden Thaw that ensued. About this time, to make amends for the mischief the French had done Coeverden, was re∣covered
covered a Place of great importance, and from whence the Garison-Soldiers, by their frequent Inroads, had greatly endamaged the Country. And now his Highness industriously laboured to com∣pose home-bred Differences and Dis∣cords, which he effected with the same facility that attended all his undertakings, insomuch that all Animosities were laid aside, and every Man apply'd himself to promote the publick good of the Coun∣try; and then he proceeded to visit the Fortifications, and give such necessary Orders, as the Juncture of Affairs requi∣red. The Spring advancing, the French King made great preparations against Holland, invading them in Person with a powerfull Army, whilst the Prince of Conde and Duke of Luxemburgh were en∣camped at Utriecht, expecting Orders to fall into the County. They had now likewise War with the King of Great Britain, with whose powerfull Navy the French joyn'd; which made the the Prince to be very carefull in atten∣ding the motion of the French by Land, whilst the States prepared to set out their Naval Forces; nor was such a Storm as then threatened the Provinces, to be
slightly regarded; for the French King laid Siege to Maestriecht, with an Army of 42000 Horse and Foot, on the 10th. of June, it being before blocked up by the Count De l' Orge, with three thou∣sand Horse: In this place was a Garison of about eight or nine hundred Horse, and four thousand Foot, Commanded by the valiant Monsieur d' Fariaux, who de∣fended the place with much Bravery to the last extremity, killing the French a∣bout 9000 Soldiers, besides Officers, and Men of great note; and then at the Petition and earnest Intreaty of the In∣habitants, surrendered upon honourable terms, and was soon after, for his Cou∣rage and prudent Conduct, made, by his Highness, Major General of the Ar∣my: And at this Seige it was that the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth signali∣zed his Valour to the highth of Brave∣ry; by which, and the Courage of the English under his Command, the French King may be justly said to make himself Master of this Place; after which, the French Army being drawn off, and part∣ly dispersed; the Prince drew together his Forces, and laid Siege to Maerd, straitening it with 25000 Horse and Foot, which obliged the Duke of Luxemburgh
to bend his Forces that way; however the Place was taken without much diffi∣culty in four days, and Luxemburgh reti∣red. About this time the States entred in∣to a League, with the Emperour and King of Spain against France, whose Ar∣mies joyning, at least in part, the Seige of Bonne was pitch'd upon, into which the Prince of Conde had only the advan∣tage of putting 100 Horse, who passed the Centinels under pretence of being the Duke of Lorrain's Party, and 100 more attempting to doe the like through the Prince's Quarters, not only failed of suc∣cess, but were most of them killed and taken Prisoners, and 500 more, who were to support them, obliged to retreat being beholden for their safety to the swiftness of their Horses: And now the Town was closely pressed by the confe∣derate Army, and the Governour sum∣moned; and although at the first he re∣fused, yet perceiving the resolution of the Besiegers to spare none they found in Arms if the Town was taken by Storm, and the vigorous Attacks they made, at the end of seven days a Parley was beat, and the Besieged granted honourable terms; they marched out to the number
of 1500, so that with little loss of Bloud the Confederates became Masters of this City; upon which the Prince of Orange drew off to Wesseling; and commanding in the absence of Montecuculi the Imperi∣al Army, he seized on the Castles of Lech∣nich and Brevel; and now Success atten∣ding his Sword, he constrained the French, although Turene had taken the Field with a considerable Army, to quit many Pla∣ces they conceived not to be tenable, or at least ways to draw out the Garisons to recruit their Army, which was not in a condition to make head against the Con∣federates: Amongst those that they quitted was Herderwick, Woerden, U∣treicht, Bomniel, Campen, Elburg, and Hattein, and the Bishop of Munster, who was in League with France, quitted Mem∣pel and Stenwick; yet at their Departure they exacted great Summes of Mony from the Inhabitants in lieu of their not firing the Houses; yet they dismantled many of them, and left visible tokens of their Anger, for being constrained to quit those important Places which they had gained at at a vast expence of Bloud and Treasure. So far did the terrour of a young General in this Rising Glories
work upon the minds of this late insul∣ting Nation, that they who had lately carried Ruine and Devastation into the nighbouring Country, began now to shrink together in their own. These were the principal Transacti∣ons to the end of the year 1673. and in gratitude for the Services his High∣ness had done the States by his Valour and Conduct, in freeing them from the Danger of their capital Enemies, and recovering so many wealthy Towns, they confirmed to him the Dignity of Stateholder, for the Provinces of Hol∣land and West Friezeland, passing a De∣cree to hold it not only for his Life, but to settle it upon the Heirs Male of his Bo∣dy, in lawfull Marriage, for ever. Up∣on which his Highness for a time, made it his Business with indefatigable care and industry, to settle the Province of Utreicht, and other Countrys that had been distur∣bed, and put out of order by the Invasi∣on of the French, and made such Refor∣mation and good Regulation of a Govern∣ment that had been shaken and put out of frame, by the sundry & sudden Revoluti∣ons, that he settled Matters to the adm∣iration & content of all Persons that had to doe in it, so that they unanimously vo∣ted
him Governour-General, and Cap∣tain-General of the Province of Utreicht, and the honour to descend to his Heirs Male, lawfully born in Wedlock. Whilst these things were doing, Ge∣neral Rebenhaupt, being aboard with a strong Party, took Northom, and put a Garison into it, beat the Munster Forces, that in his absence were endeavouring to re-take it; and marched onward, stor∣med Nigenbuys, yet the Garison retiring to a little Castle, capable of making but a slender resistence, were spared upon their throwing down their Arms, and begging Quarter: But upon his going into Winter Quarters, and dispersing his Men, General Negal, with the Mun∣ster Forces under his Command, recove∣red the latter. However, the Bishop of Munster, perceiving the Tempest of War to gather about his Countries, and finding the French King no way able to support him, he thought it high time to treat of Peace, and accordingly clap∣ped up one with the Emperour, which more and more discouraged the French, so that the Marquess of Belefouds, who succeeded the Mareschal d' Humiers in the Netherland Acquisitions, thought of nothing more than the deserting the Towns that yet remained.
And in order to this, upon notice that the Prince was marching into Brabant with 30000 Men to joyn the Spanish For∣ces, Tiel, Arnheim, Zutphen, and others, were slighted, but not without great Summes of Money extorted from the Inhabitants, to save them from Plunder and Burning; the Bishop of Munster like∣wise relinquished Devenenter, so that all Overysel was at entire Liberty, and had those Disorders the Enemy occasioned in Government rectified and restored by his Highness's special Command, though for quitting these Towns the Marquess lost the French King's Fa∣vour, and was for bidden the Court, the better to colour the Business, which his necessity, past all peradventure, had o∣bliged him to doe; yet to repair this loss he fell into the French Conte, and took Dole, Malins, and Becanson, making him∣self, in a short time, Master of that entire Province: This made his Highness the Prince of Orange repair the sooner to the Army at Bargen Opzoon, marching from thence to Mallins, guarding the Fronteirs of Brabant, so that the French, though abroad with two powerfull Ar∣mies, durst attempt nothing farther on that side.
The Confederate Armies joyning a∣bout the end of July, The Generals a∣greed, That Count Souches should lead the Van, the Prince of Orange the Main Battel, and the Rear-Guard to be com∣manded by the Count Montery, and so they proceeded to oblige the Prince of Conde, who lay encamped with the greatest strength of the French power, to a Battel; but not being able to draw him to it, and perceiving the still fortified his Camp, the Confederate Armies drew off, in order to besiege and take in some Places of Importance, which Conde no sooner perceived, and understanding the difficult ways they were to pass, but he drew out and pursued the Rear-Guard, as knowing the Van-Guard and Main Battalia were a great way advanced, and charged the Prince of Vaudemont, who consisted most of Horse, which ob∣liged him to send to the Prince of Orange for two Battalians of Foot, who sent him three, under the Command of young Prince Maurice of Nassau, and soon after the entire Army engaged by degrees in a doubtfull and bloudy Fight, near the River Seneff, where at first the French had the advantage, by reason the Confederate Army being, as is said, di∣vided,
could not so soon unite as was convenient; however the Prince of Con∣de in conclusion was obliged to draw off, and quit the Field, with the loss of about 7000 Men, and amonst them sundry great Officers and Voluntiers of note: Nor did the Confederates lose less than 6000, and amongst them ma∣ny Noble-men, besides those that were wounded and taken Prisoners on both sides: And in this Battel, which lasted for about the space of six or seven hours, his Highness the Prince of Orange spared not to hazard his Person in the greatest danger, labouring with his Voice and Example to encourage his Men, and re∣store the Battel where he found it bro∣ken and disordered, by rallying the Troups and Battalions, causing those that shrunk or gave back to advance, and with his Sword in his hand, led them on to face the danger, omitting nothing that became a great and experi∣enced General; insomuch that General Souches, a Man of great prudence and large understanding, gives a Character of him to the States of Holland in these words. I have endeavoured (says he) to dis∣charge my Duty, in attending his Highness
the Prince of Orange, during the famous, though bloudy, Battel between the Confe∣derate Army and that of the most Christian King, the happy Issue of which has proved very much to the Glory of the Prince, who shewed, upon that occasion, the Prudence of an aged Captain, the Courage of a Caesar, and the un daunted Bravery of a Marius; all which, My Lords, is delivered by me without Flattery, which is contrary to my Nature, &c. The Fight being over, and the Con∣federates with a strong Party keeping the Field all Night, the Prince the next day marched by Mons with his whole Army, and was recruited at St. Gilain with five Dutch Regiments, and there he Quartered, whilst the Imperialists march∣ed to Queverain; when soon after Ge∣neral Rabenhaupt laid Siege to the Greves, a strong Garison possessed by the French, and as stoutly defended, insomuch that he had been undoubtedly obliged to quit that Siege, had not the Prince of Orange perfected it by the as∣sistence he gave; for the Garison con∣sisted of 4000 Foot, and 9 Troups of Horse, and in it 450 pieces of Cannon, a hundred of them mounted, besides a large store of Ammunition and Provision,
yet this strong place yielded to the un∣conquerable Fortune of the Prince; for finding the Imperialists and Spaniards not forward to hazard a second Battel with Conde, who was by this time considera∣bly re-inforced, leaving the Gross of his Army with Prince Waldeck, he came to the Siege of this place with 60 Troups of Horse, which so animated the Besie∣gers, and daunted the Besieged, that the Marquess De Chamilly, Governour of the Town, finding the great Breaches that were made in the Walls, and the mis∣chief done by the springing of the Mines, he began to conclude it could not hold out a resolute Assault, and so coming to a Parley, obtained honourable Conditi∣ons; by which means the Curb that this strong Garison had put upon the nigh∣bouring Countries was happily taken off, and the Troups for the most part were put into Winter Quarters, and lit∣tle of the Action happened till the ensuing Spring; yet in consideration of the far∣ther Services the Prince had done the States, they of Guelderland offered him as an addition to his other Honours, the Sovereignty of the Dutchy of Guelders, & the County of Zutphen; and though o∣ther Provinces intimated at the same time
that they would doe the like, yet he would in modesty accept of no other than that of Governour Hereditary of those Provinces; and being confirmed therein, his first care was to settle the Affairs that had been disordered, as pru∣dently foreseeing that nothing conduces more to the happiness of a Country, than a good Constitution of Govern∣ment. In the year 1675 the French by their great preparations demonstrating their early Intentions to take the Field, the Confederates consulted the best methods for the carrying on the War against France: But whilst that was doing the Prince fell sick of the Small-Pox, which Distemper having proved fatal to many of his near Relations, created a sadness not only throughout the Provinces, but almost every where where the news came; yet it lasted not; for in a short time, through the diligence and industry of his Physicians, great signs of Amend∣ment appeared, which ended in a per∣fect recovery of his Health; when, as soon as his strength would permit him, he hasted to the general Rendezvouz, near Rosendale, the better to attend the French King's motion, who was by this time in
the Field, and upon his March towards Brabant, having already besieged Lim∣burgh, by the Marquess of Rochfort, The Prince before his Departure ad∣justed and reconciled several Differen∣ces, and held a Conference with the Elector of Brandenburgh, who came to the Hague to pay him a Visit. Great indeed was the Spoil the French made, quite destroying the fruitfull Country of Waes, which made the Confederate Ar∣mies hasten to oppose them, and the Prince being at Rosendale, gave such ne∣cessary Orders, as according to the mea∣sures that were then taken for carrying on the Affairs, were best suitable: Af∣ter which he marched with the Army under his Command towards Mallins, upon notice the French were set down before Conde, the King in person being in the Army, who caused the Siege to be carried on with so much vigour, that before the Prince could put his De∣signs in Execution, in order to relieve it, the Town was taken by storm; yet Quar∣ter, after much slaughter on both sides, was given to such as yielded, and they were made Prisoners of War: And now his Highness having an Army of about 30000, daily expected 10 or 12000
Spaniards to join with him; which con∣junction soon happening, he took a re∣view of the Forces, and having an ac∣count that Bouchain was besieged, and that the Governour, the better to de∣fend it, had caused the lower Town to be burnt down; a Council of War was held, in which it was resolved to raise the Siege, or give the Enemy Battel; and accordingly his Highness commanded the Prince of Vaudemont, to march pri∣vately with three thousand Horse and Foot, to secure a Pass over the River Schelde, below Conde; and at the same time the Duke of Holstein marched with 1500 Horse, and two Regiments of Foot, through Mons towards Kieurain, to amuse the Enemy, and make them be∣lieve the whole Army was coming to Attack them on that side, and there∣upon all the Forces marched without beat of Drum, or sound of Trumpet, in two Lines; which made the French King, who lay with his Forces at Kieu∣rain, Soburgh, &c. to draw off, that he might cover the Siege, leaving the Mare∣schal d' Humieres, only with 4 or 5000 Men to guard the Pass; but upon the approach of the Prince, finding himself to weak, he retired without disputing it,
and so his Highness, with the Duke d Villa Hermosa, encamped near Valencien∣nes; but the French not being to be drawn out of their Retrenchments, i was not thought expedient to attemp the forcing them to a Battel; so tha after may vigorous Assaults the Gover∣nour of Bouchain capitulated and sur∣rendred the Place. The Prince of Orange perceiving thi Place lost, and that he could not forc the French to a Battel without great dis∣advantage, after some Councils held the Siege of some important Place wa resolved on, and accordingly his High∣ness laid Siege to Maestricht, having his Army encreased by the Arrival o the Osnaburgh Troups, under the Com∣mand of that Duke, and the Siege wa carried on with great Resolution, an nothing omitted that the highest Con∣duct and Valour was capable of per∣forming; yet after a bloudy and obsti∣nate Resistence of the Besieged, and th Approach of the French Army, wit a Resolution to relieve them, his High∣ness thought it convenient to raise th Siege and draw off, which he did i good order: A brief Account of which you may see in the following Letter o
Heer Dyck-Velt, sent to the States of Holland, &c. Noble and Mighty Lords, THE Attack upon the Horne-Work, was not made as was intended the 25th. of August, but the day following be∣fore Noon, though without success, and the Enemy being advanced with a very great Force to Tongres, it was unanimously con∣cluded by the Generals, that they could not be hindred from putting a succour into the Place on the side of the Wycke, and that for several difficulties that were foreseen, it would be the best and safest to draw off the Troups from that side, and to put the whole Army into Battalia, without the lines, near Le∣naken; which was accordingly done the next Morning, and we continued there till now. In the mean while all our Cannon, Ammunition, and part of the Provision, together with the sick and wounded Men, where put into the lightest Vessels, which could best pass, by reason of the extraordina∣ry lowness of the Water: Having seen all our Cannon embarked, and sent the Boats away, some Skirmishes happened, in which the Enemy was still repulsed: It was to have been wished that God would have been pleased to have blessed the extraor∣dinary
Diligence, Vigilance, and Pains, which his Highness hath with the greatest Care and Application taken, during this Siege, and so great danger to his Person, with better success for the good of the State; but seeing it hath not been his Holy Will, I pray that he will please, in other occasions, to give the Arms of the State better success. Philipsburgh being this while besieged by the Imperial Confederates, after a furious Battery, and many vigorous At∣tacks, the Governour perceiving a ge∣neral Assault was intended, capitulated and surrendred it upon very advantage∣ous Articles to Prince Herman of Baden, who commanded in chief at that Siege. The Prince of Orange having drawn off his Forces from before Maestricht, and given the Mareschal de Schomberg, who commanded the French Forces, all the opportunity imaginable to en∣gage, which he declined, thinking it sufficient that he had relieved the Town, he decamped from Lenaken, and march∣ed to St. Tron, and there he sent the Regiments that had sustained the grea∣test Loss in this Siege into Holland, to refresh and recruit, and so with the rest of the Cavalry and Infantry, took his
way towards Janche and Partuise, his Excellency the Duke De Villa Hermosa leading the Van, the Duke of Osnaburgh the main Battel, and his Highness the Rear-Guard, and although the French Army marched after him, yet they at∣tempted nothing upon his Forces, however the Troups being allarm'd drew up in Battalia to expect them. And now the Winter-season advancing, and the time of Action over, his Highness left the Army under the Command of Count Waldeck, and returned to Holland, where he was received with many De∣monstrations of joy, and proceeded to give the general Assembly of States an Account of that Summers Campaign, so much to their satisfaction, that the Pre∣sident in a most solemn manner congra∣tulated his safe Return, in his own, and in the names of all the States there assem∣bled: As likewise did the States of Hol∣land by the Pensioner Fagel, acknow∣ledging all the Kindness and Gratitude imaginable, for the Care and Pains he had taken, and the Danger he had ex∣posed his Person to for the Honour and Service of the State. In the year following, after a bloudy and doubtfull War, great were the ex∣pectations
of the People that a Peace would ensue; and the sooner to bring it to pass, his Majesty of Great Britain laboured by his Ambassadours and En∣voys in the Court of the Princes, and engaged for an Accommodation, after the expence of so much Bloud and Treasure as this vigorous War had ex∣hausted, but it went not on so prosperous∣ly as was wished by reason the French in the dead of the Winter were upon their March towards the Netherlands, which retarded the Negotiation, and by the first of March, they had invested Valenci∣ennes with between fifty and sixty thou∣sand Men, under the Command of the Duke of Luxemburgh, and the Count of Montal; nor was it long before the King came to the Army with a great number of Voluntier Gentlemen. The Garison of that City consisted at that time of no more than 2000 Italians, Spaniards and Walloon Foot, and of about one thousand Horse and Dragoons, Commanded by the Marquess of Resburg, so that before any considerable Force of the Confede∣rates could take the Field, this City was formally besieged, and the Sieg carried on with extraordinary vigour as well by throwing Granadoes into it
as battering it with Cannon, running Trenches, Mining, &c. which so far fa∣cilitated the Enterprize by continually al∣larming and wearying out the besieged, that the besiegers made themselves Ma∣sters of the Counterscarp and Horne-work with little difficulty, and turned the Guns they found there upon the Ci∣ty, which created such a Consternation, that the Governour finding the Soldi∣ers and Inhabitants no longer willing to hazard themselves against the encroach∣ing Enemy, and not expecting any timely relief, he being at the same time wounded, and obliged to keep his Bed, the Place surrendred upon discretion; yet the French King commanded the Soldiers not to pillage it, and gave the Count of Risburg his Liberty; when hightened with this success, he divided his Army, and at once besieged Cam∣bray, and St. Omers, the former of which, though well Garisoned, he took without much difficulty, viz the Town, but the Castle, whither the Soldiers re∣tired to make their last Effort, held him in play much longer. The Prince of Orange having by this time taken the Field, marched with the Army under his Command, to the Re∣lief
of St. Omers, of which the French King had no sooner notice, but he sent a∣way part of his Army to strengthen that Leagure maintained by the Duke of Or∣leance: Nor was it unseasonable, for the Prince having passed many difficult ways as also the River Pene, gave the Duke Battel, who had drawn off the greatest part of his Army to oppose him; and though by the ill Discipline and Conduct of the left Wing, the disadvantage of Ground and superiour number of the French, after a long and doubtfull Fight, wherein he extremely hazarded his Person, and received two shots upon his Armour; he found himself obliged to retire with some Loss: Yet such was the Action, that the Duke returned not to the Siege in eight days after, for fear of a second Attack, nor till he was assu∣red his Highness had passed the Cha∣nel of Gaunt: and then after a furious Battery, the Garison, who considered the encrease of his Army, and the lit∣tle hopes they had of Relief, surren∣dred upon advantageous Articles; and a∣bout this time News came, that the Cit∣tadel or Castle of Cambray, after an ob∣stinate resistence, had surrendred upon very advantageous or honourable Con∣ditions
This early success of the French King roused the Confederates, who ha∣stened their Armies from all Parts, and rendezvouzing near Alost, made a for∣midable Body, all but the Army the Duke of Lorain had brought into the Field, submitting to the Command of the Prince; which so amazed the French King, that leaving the Mareschal de Cre∣qui, and the Duke of Luxemburgh, the former to attend the motion of the Duke of Lorain, and the latter to ob∣serve the Prince, he left the Field and returned to Paris; whereupon his High∣ness marched towards Aeth, accompani∣ed with the Duke De Villa Hermosa, and the Duke of Osnaburgh, in order to dis∣lodge the French that were quartered under its Walls, or oblige them to Bat∣tel: but finding the Duke of Luxemburgh, who commanded there, advantageously encamped between two Rivers, and well fortified, showing no inclination to leave his Post, he at that time con∣tented himself with the making a flying Camp to prevent the French Parties straggling abroad, and harrasing the nighbouring Countries, and with the reft of the Army set down before Char∣leroy, an important City, strongly Gari∣soned
by the French, which obliged the Duke of Luxemburgh, for the better strengthening his Army, to draw the Sol∣diers out of divers Garisons, and by that means formed a Body of 40000 Men, with which he first endeavou∣red to cut off their Forage and Pro∣vision, coming from beyond the Sambre; and there the better to effect it, he strongly entrenched himself, as knowing the cutting off the Forage must of neces∣sity distress the Prince, which accor∣dingly succeeded, and was one of the chief occasions that induced his High∣ness to draw off the Army and march to Sombrief, and finding he could not ob∣lige the French to a Battel without great disadvantage, their chief aim being only to hinder his laying Siege to any Place of note, he drew nearer Brussels, and there having given necessary Orders, and left the Charge of the Armies to Count Waldeck, he passed from thence to the Hague, accompanied by sundry Noble-men, as well English as others, and there gave the States an Account of his Conduct, with which they were very much satisfied, and returned his High∣ness their hearty Thanks for his weary Enterprizes, &c.
The French not appearing any ways inclinable to Action, or undertaking the Siege of any important Place, his High∣ness taking leave of the States, embark∣ed for England, attended by the Earl of Ossory and divers other Lords and Gen∣tlemen, on the Yatches sent for his Ac∣commodation by His Majesty of great Britain, King Charles II. and was attended by three English Men of War, and a Squadron the States ordered to wait upon him, Commanded by Admi∣ral Evertson; there was also in his Train the Count of Nassau, and Mr. Odyck, and proceeding with a prosperous Gale, safely arrived at Harwich the 19th of October, 1677. where he was received by the Duke of Albemarle, and proceeding thence in the King's Coaches to Ipswich, he was there very favourably received by his Majesty, and a splendid Train of Nobility, as also by his Royal Highness, with all the Testimonies and Expressions of real Joy and Affection, and on the 23d. they arrived at White-Hall, where his Royal Highness's Lodgings were pre∣pared for his Reception, and soon after it was known to what intent his Highness had been invited over; nor did he on the 29th. of October fail, upon the Invi∣tation
of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London, to accompany His Majesty, His Royal Highness, and the Court, to be a spectatour of the Cities magnificent annual Triumph, and was splendidly entertained to his high satis∣faction. Now the King having chosen his Highness from amongst the Princes of Europe as the fittest Match for his illu∣strious Neece, the Princess Mary, for which intent he was invited to Court, he on the first of November declared his In∣tention in Council, with which the Lords were extremely satisfied, as well in the Merits of his Highness, as the security of the Protestant Religion, by so agree∣able a Match, and the better for the con∣servation of a Peace with the united Pro∣vinces; whereupon the Council, to testi∣fie a farther mark of the contentment they received, went in a body to Com∣plement and Congratulate the Princess, and then the Prince upon this hap∣py occasion, as did afterwards the rest of the Nobility of the Kingdom, and others, a general satisfaction being every where expressed; so that his Highness sent an Express to the States General, to acquaint them with what was intended; the Summe of which was:
That in consideration they had by their earnest Wishes to him declared how much they desired to see him Mar∣ried, after he had well weighed the Reasons that had induced him to it, in Conformity to their Desires, and the Tranquillity of their State, he conceived he could not doe better than to address himself to the Princess Mary, eldest Daughter to the Duke of York, that he had made his Request to have her in Marriage, both of the King and the Duke, who had condescended to his Pro∣posals and therefore he thought it re∣quisite to give their Lordships notice of it, expecting in return their speedy Ap∣probation, that he might the sooner ha∣sten again to their Service. Upon this notice of his Highness's In∣tentions, the States assembled to consi∣der the weighty Reasons that induced him to make so happy a choice in placing his Affections on the most illustrious Princess in Europe, and with much Joy & Gratulation approved them, testifying by a publick Edict, the satisfaction they conceived, and declaring the esteem of so great an Alliance, made a resolution to observe it to the utmost of their power, and accordingly sent their Approbation
to his Highness on the 4th. of November, old Style, on which day the happy Mar∣riage was solemnized, the Ceremonies performed by the Bishop of London, and the King gave the Princess: Nor did the News appear in publick but with the greatest Demonstrations of Joy imagina∣ble, the Bells every where rang, and Bon-fires flam'd in the streets, and an universal consent spread over the King∣dom, and Congratulatory Poems were made by the best hands upon the occasi∣on. But whilst every one was Reveling in Joy and Contentment, the Prince had his thoughts employed upon the impor∣tant Business of the State, and having re∣ceived the farther Complements and Congratulations of the Nobles and Gen∣try, he on the 29th. took his leave of the Court, together with his fair Princess, and with a Train of Noble-men and La∣dies took his way to embark for Holland, whither he was attended by several Men of War, and having a prosperous Passage landed at Ter-heyde, and from thence pas∣sed to Hounsleyrdyke, where for some time their Highnesses continued, and re∣ceived private Visits till the Magnificence that was to attend their publick Entry into the Hague was prepared; where up∣on
their Ingress the Bridge was crow∣ned with Garlands of Triumph, and un∣der them written, Ʋxori & Batavis vivat Nassovius Hector Auriaco & Patriae vivat Britanica Princeps. Here they found likewise the twelve Companies of Burghers drawn up in Arms, and the People every where ex∣pressing their satisfaction with loud and joyfull Acclamations; and upon passing the Bridge 24 Virgins met them, sing∣ing Songs prepared for the occasion, and strewing the way with fragrant Herbs on each side the Coach wherein their Highnesses were; and arriving at the Town-house, they found a Trium∣phal Arch erected, through which they passed; this Arch was beautified and a∣dorned with a Sylvian Scene, and on the top a Hieroglyphick of Amity, by the clasping of two hands, and a Motto, viz. Auriaci his Thalamis, Bataevis dos Regia pax est. Then crossing the Market-place into the High-street, they found another Arch erected, with this Motto, viz. Ingredere Auspicius Batavis Felicibus Aulam.
and in the mean time the Cannon was fired from all parts, and the Burghers gave several Volleys; at Night the whole Country was enlightened with Bon-fires, and Fire-works of sundry kinds and forms, and so with great joy and sa∣tisfaction passed the rest of the Winter, little Action happening abroad in that season; yet the French King made early preparations against the Spring, which obliged his Majesty of Great Britain, as he had before designed, to labour to compose the unhappy differences that had occasioned the expence of so much Bloud and Treasure; and in order to it he sent the Earl of Feversham to the French King, with Instructions to nego∣tiate a Peace between that King and the Confederates; the purport of his Com∣mission was to propose, That the City of Charleroy, Aeith, Courtray, Tournay, Con∣de, Oudenard, Valenciennes, and St. Gui∣lain should be restored to the Spaniards, in consideration of which, the French King should keep La Frenche Conte intire; but this not succeeding, His Majesty of Great Britain dispatched a Commissi∣on, fully impowring the Lord Hide his Ambassadour at the Hague, to make Alliance with the States General, mu∣tually
to stand by and defend each other, till they could oblige the French King to Reason; the English Parliament at the same time declaring strongly for it, and offering the King considerable Summes of Mony to carry on the pro∣jected Design against the Disturber of Christendom. The Alliance was to be carried on in order to the recovering a satisfaction by such means as should be thought most expedient and best agreeable; and indeed for a time it was vigorously maintained, the Parliament of England pressing it with a more than ordinary Ardour, and the King sent the Lord Montague his Ambassadour to France, once more to press that King to a Compliance, ma∣king at the same time new Levies of Horse and Foot: However the French King rejecting the Propositions, was not idle, but made great preparations for War; whereupon the King of Great Bri∣tain recalled his Forces that were in the French Service, who were sent home without their Arrears. But whilst the Confederates were agreeing about their Quota's or Levies, the French early in the Spring besieged Gaunt, which being taken, by reason of the insufficiency of
the Garison to maintain a place of that vast Circuit, they sate down before Ypre, which after a resolute defence surren∣dred. These Places thus lost for want of succour, made the Confederates draw out from all Parts, the Prince of Orange being the first that took the Field, and the Duke of Monmouth arrived at Bruges with about 3000 English Horse and Foot; but the French King having done as much as he thought convenient at that time, putting the greater part of his numerous Armies into Garisons to refresh them, he retired to Paris; but hearing the League against him continu∣ally strengthened by new Alliances, and a Prohibition of the growth of his King∣dom, he thought it no longer convenient to delay, but formed himself a Project of Accommodation, to this purpose, viz. That the Prince and Bishop of Stras∣burgh should be entirely restored to all his Territories, Honours, Prerogatives and Goods, and Prince William of Furstem∣burgh, his Brother be set at Liberty. That in relation to the Emperour he would stand to his Declarations, insisting upon the
Treaties of Westphalia, offering to restore Philipsburgh or Friburgh. That to the King of Spain he would re∣store Charleroy, Aeith, Courtray, Gaunt, Oudenard, and St. Guilain, together with Chastlerains and all their Dependencies, but reserve to himself Conde, Bouchain, Air, Cambray, Valenciennes, and Saint Omers, with all their Castles and De∣pendencies, with La Frenche Conte entire. That he would restore Charlemont or Dinant to the Spaniard with the Emperour and Bishop of Liege's consent. That the Confines between Spain & the Low Countrys from the Sea should be the Meuse, Newport, Courtray, Aeith, Dixmund, Mons, Oudenard, Namur, and Charleroy, and those Bounds to be assured by those Places. That moreover to the States General he would restore Maestricht, and allow the Commerce, as formerly granted. That he would restore to the Duke of Lo∣rain, according to the Pyrenean Treaty, or surrender to him, excepting Nancy, all his Territories, and in lieit of that City he would give him Toul, thereby only reserving to himself a free passage into Alsatia. And far∣ther demanded satisfaction for his Allies. The proposals were not generally li∣ked, yet after many Difficulties and Re∣fusals,
the Treaty was at length signed by the Plenipotentiaries of France and Holland, on the 11th. of August, 1678. yet the delays of the French King proved extremely prejudicial to his Af∣fairs, especially in lessening the Reputa∣tion his Arms had gained; for whilst the Treaty held with indifferency, and wa∣vered without any certainty of coming to a conclusion, the Prince of Orange ha∣ving joyned the Confederate Forces, they called a Council of War, in which it was concluded that seeing Mons, a City of the Province of Hainault, had been a long time Blocked up by the French, and that the Duke of Luxem∣burgh was on his March with the Army under his Command, to prevent any Succours being put into the City, that it was convenient to intercept him, and with this Resolution the Prince and the Confederate Army set forward about the beginning of August, and was joyned in his March by six thousand Munsterians and Brandenburghers, under the Com∣mand of General Spaen. The French upon notice of his Approach removed from Soignes, where they had lain for some time encamped, where the next day the Prince decamped with the Con∣federate
Army, and from thence march∣ed toward Rockless, advancing the left Wing as far as the Abby of St. Dennis, that Place being the Duke of Luxem∣burgh's chief Quarters, facing with his Right Wing Casteau, possessed likewise by the French; and although the Passes were extreme difficult, which rendred the French more secure, yet the Army being embatteled, his Highness comman∣ded a Party to drive the French from a Hillock they had possessed, which was performed with little difficulty; and then he caused the great Guns to play upon the Enemy that had posted them∣selves near the Cloister, adjacent to the Town; and though they strove to de∣fend it with their Cannon, yet after a considerable Battery, a Party of Dra∣goons advanced, and after a sharp dis∣pute drove them thence, and possessed the Place, when in the mean time Adju∣tant General Collyer, seconded by Ge∣neral Delwick, passed the Defiles, or nar∣row dirty Lanes, with admirable cou∣rage, contrary to the expectation of the French, and drove them, after a strenu∣ous resistence, into their own Lines; when the Prince, accompanied by the Duke of Monmouth, who fought by his
side that day, fell in with great resolu∣tion and bravery, encouraging by words and actions the Regiments that were advanced, and signallizing his Valour a∣bove Report, which so animated the Regiments of the left Wing that they followed each other till the Evening charging with great resolution; and Count Horn bending the Cannon under his Charge against the Battalions of French that were drawn up in the Val∣ley, it greatly endamaged them by battering their Ranks. The Fight being thus begun, was car∣ried on and maintained with much reso∣lution and bravery, the Prince, forcing his Passage to Casteau, which had been Attacked by the Spaniards in the right Wing, where his Regiments of Foot-Guards had the Van-Guard under the Command of Count Solms, and was seconded by the Regiments of Holstein, Roques, Sereres, and they supported by the English, who through the natural aversion they had to the French, char∣ged with such fury, that the obstinate re∣sistence the Enemy made could not su∣stain their impetuosity; for after five hours dispute the French were driven from their Post by the Regiments of
Guards, who pursued them to the River Haines, on the other side of Casteau: And in this Battel it was that the renow∣ned Earl of Ossory, who commanded the English, signalized his Valour; and in∣deed the whole stress of the Battel lay upon the Infantry, the Cavalry not be∣ing very serviceable in a Place of such narrow access, and so full of precipices. Night putting an end to the Slaughter, the Duke of Luxemburgh finding his loss great, and that he was no longer capable of making good his Post, drew off, un∣der the favour of the darkness of the Night, in much Silence and Confusion, and took a new Post nearer Mons, co∣vering his Army with a Wood on the one side, and on the other it was secured by a River, leaving behind him most of the wounded Men, with many Tents, and much Baggage and Ammunition. The Prince upon this advantage, would have pursued the French to have given them a total Defeat, and free the Town of Mons from the apprehension of Danger: But whilst he was preparing to make a second Attack, an Express was sent him, that the Treaty was signed be∣tween the States and the French King; however, they congratulated his High∣ness
upon this Success, in an extraordi∣nary manner, intreating him to be more sparing of their safety than to hazard himself in the midst of danger; and the better to demonstrate at how dear a rate they esteemed his preservation, they sent to Mr. Owerkirks (a Person who had enterposed himself between the Prince and a French Captain, that in the heat of the Fight was in a full Carier to charge him at adisadvantage) a Sword, whose Hilt was of Massy Gold, a pair of Pistols inlay'd with Gold and a pair of golden Horse-buckles. Upon the News that the Treaty was signed, a Cessation of Arms ensued, and upon the Duke of Luxemburgh's drawing off to the Country between the Muse and Sambre, the Prince marched to Es∣cousines, upon the Road to Nivelle, and there being no farther Business in relati∣on to warlike Action, he came to the Hague, where he was received by the People, with the highest demonstration of Joy and Acclamation; and this last success no doubt hastened the Con∣clusion of the Treaty between France and Spain, which was agreed on the 17th. of November following, yet it lasted not long, before the French King upon the claiming several places in the Spanish
Netherlands as Dependencies, blocked up Luxemburgh, which obliged the King of Great Britain, Guarrantee of the Peace, to interpose his Authority, as likewise did the States, by way of Me∣diation; but the French King would not hearken to the quitting the claim he had laid, unless the City of Luxem∣burgh might be put into his Possession, with all its Dependencies, three Leagues round it; which being long debated, and the time the French King gave to come to a Resolve being expired, with∣out concluding any thing of that Affair, the Mareschal d' Humieres fell into the Spanish Provinces with a numerous Ar∣my, and put them under Contribution, making great spoil, and ravage in many places; and not so contented, but upon the Prince of Chimai's (Governour of Luxemburgh) acting some Hostilities in their Territories, the Mareschal laid Siege to, and took Courtray, burning ma∣ny places of lesser note, constraining o∣thers to pay a Ransome for saving them∣selves from Fire; and in conclusion, the Mareschal d' Crequi came before Luxem∣burgh with an Army of 30000 Men, and cast a great number of Bombs into that City, which burnt and demolished about
Five hundred Houses, and so retired to put his Army into Winter Quarters; and in the mean while the Negotiation con∣tinued between the Arbritours to settle the Differences between the two Crowns; nor did they spare any Diligence to create a good understanding, by proposing E∣quivalents; but the Spaniards at that time, were so much averse, that the Me∣diatours began to give over the hopes they had conceived of accommodating Matters in dispute; nay the Spanish Am∣bassadour proceeded so far, as to press the King of Great Britain to send over For∣ces to the Assistence of his Master; but the King told him, That the urgency of his Affairs at home could not admit of sending Forces abroad, but that he was willing to doe the King of Spain all the good Offices that lay in him, &c. as also to use his utmost Endeavours for the Peace and Repose of Europe. But not satisfied with this Answer, they again applyed themselves to the States. Ge∣neral, but they being not willing to en∣ter into any new Engagement of War with France, the Ambassadours could not persuade them to make new Levies, or to send any Forces to the Assistence of His Catholick Majesty; nor could the Em∣perour
give any assistence, by reason of the storm that threatened him at that time in Hungary; so that indeed the whole State of Europe being unwilling, or not in a condition to enter into a new War, it was greatly hoped that this would ob∣lige those that stood out to a compli∣ance: And the better to perfect an Alli∣ance, a general Congress was held at the Hague, where it was thought somewhat reasonable, that the True of Twenty years which the French King had offered should be accepted, including the Allies on all parts; which coming to a Resolve, and the Articles of Treaty agreed, amongst other things, it was thought fit that the French King should restore to the King of Spain, Dixmuyden, and Cour∣tray, with their Dependencies, having liberty to demolish the Fortifications; as likewise the other Places taken by force since the 30th. of August, 1683. and that in consideration thereof, the King of Spain should Surrender to him Beau∣mont, Luxemburgh, Chimai and Bovines, with all their Dependencies; and to this purpose the Articles between the two Crowns were concluded on at Ratisbon. And now the French King being at lei∣sure, began to grow exceeding trouble∣some
to his Protestant Subjects, having, during the former Transactions, put a very sensible Affront upon his Highness the Prince of Orange; for whilst the Differences lasted between the French & the Spaniards, they extremely wasted his Patrimony in Brabant, Burgundy, and Lux∣emburgh, where the Prince of Isenguyn, supported by the French Interest and Arms, had seized upon his Possession of Warnesson, Desburgh, Vianden, St. Ʋith, Budgenback, &c. yet out of a generosity to his Country, in preferring their Peace and Tranquillity before his own interest, he forbore at that time to put in for Re∣paration; nor could the Violences the French King unjustly offered in entring upon his Principality of Orange be less resented, by which Act he seemed to have this farther design, viz. To hinder the Protestant Religion from flourishing there; for upon the Persecution he raised in all parts of his own Territories, many of the Protestants sent their Children to this Sovereign Principality to be Educa∣ted in Learning; but this greatly displea∣sing him, he sent his Orders to Monsieur Moran Super-intendent of Provence, to March a Body of 2000 Men thither, un∣der the Command of his Lieutenant-Ge∣neral
in Languedock, to command the Magistrates of the Principality of Orange to send away all the Children to their Parents, and not for the future to re∣ceive any more into their Schools or A∣cademies. To this unjust and unreaso∣nable Demand they found themselves constrained to consent, promising to give notice to the Parents of the Chil∣dren, that they might send for them home, hoping by this means they had given the King satisfaction: But what can satisfie an ambitious & spightfull Mind? for although this gave the Citizens hope they were in Peace, yet it proved not so, for soon after Orders came to throw down the Walls of the City, and the French Dragoons Quartering upon the Inhabitants, committed many Indecen∣cies and Disorders, compelling the Peo∣ple to Work in ruining their own Forti∣fications, which being undermined, were blown up. This News no sooner came to his Highness's Council, but they complained of it to the States-General, as a breach of the last Peace, urging, that Reparation might be required for such unjust Pro∣ceedings against the Subjects of his Highness, in the midst of a general
Peace: Nor were the States wanting in Writing to the King, and letting him know their Resentments for so great an Injury, contrary to the Treaty of Nime∣guen, pressing him for Reparation of the damage his Highness had, contrary to Articles, sustained in the Violence done to his Subjects: But they could get no other Answer from the French Court, but that as for the Money extorted from the Inhabitants, those that extorted it had no Order for it, and he had commanded Restitution to be made, and upon the Peoples submitting to his Pleasure, he had withdrawn his Forces, and restored the Inhabitants their Commerce accor∣ding to their Desires; but as for the rest, he alledged he had reason for what he did. This Answer, though it was nei∣ther generous, nor pleasing, was all that could be got at that time, and so the matter continues to a more favourable opportunity. The Face of Peace now appearing a∣mongst the Christian Princes, and Hun∣gary, being the greatest Scene of War, the States thought of Disbanding their supernumerary Forces, and in order thereto advised with his Highness, who assured them that there was no Person
more desirous than himself to ease the People of their Contributions and Tax∣es; but in consideration things were scarcely settled, and that the nighbou∣ring Countries had not yet Disbanded, but were in Arms, he thought it the safest way to continue them till they might be assuredly free from the fear or suspicion of any sinister event, &c. And according to this prudent and grave Counsel they were continued, it being resolved by the States-General, That the Extraordinary Forces should be kept up to a farther time. And now his Highness being more at leisure, and desirous to promote the good of his Country, betook himself to the reforming the Government of Ʋ∣treicht, in which, during the Series of so tedious a War, some Disorders and Irregularities had happened; which he redressed by prudently altering such of the Magistracy as were looked upon unfit Persons to manage the Govern∣ment, and put such into their places as he found better capable of managing so weighty a Trust; striving to promote and advance the welfare of the People at no small expence of Pains and Trea∣sure, contrary to the Methods of the French King, who was then Dragooning
his Subjects of the Protestant Religion, and using all manner of ways to ruine them by Tortures, Confiscations, and Imprisonments, and many such un∣christian-like Proceedings. And since we are come to this part, pardon the Digression, if I conceive it not amiss to expose the Methods France has of late years taken to bring over Protestants to the Church of Rome, that the Reader may the better distin∣guish between the Actions of a vertuous Prince, who makes it his utmost care and study to preserve and promote those that are under his Jurisdiction, and a Prince that labours to ruine and destroy his Sub∣jects. I shall not trouble you with the De∣claration put out against the Protestants in the year 1669. or hardships they suf∣fered before and since that year in parti∣cular, till I come to the year 1680. In this year the King issued out his Order, thereby depriving them in general of all manner of places of Trust, Offices, and Services; reducing the meaner sort thereby to great distress, and disanulling the more wealthy of what they had pur∣chased with their Money, and the price of their Bloud: And the next year 1681,
by a Decree of their Council, all Nota∣ries, Attornies, Solicitors, and Sergeants, which made profession of the Reformed Religion, were rendred uncapable of their Employments; and the next year the Lords and Gentlemen were com∣manded to discharge their Protestant Officers and Servants; and in Eighty three, all Officers of the King's House∣hold, and those of the Princes of the Bloud, were commanded to give place to the Roman Catholicks; and in a word, all manner of Persons of all Pro∣fessions, that were of the Reformed Re∣ligion, had a Prohibition by those strict Decrees under severe Penalties: And so strict were they, that the Midwives, un∣less Roman Catholicks, durst not, but by stealth, perform their Office, and by this means, some were constrained to suffer their Tongue to give their Heart the Lye. These, for the encouragement as they pretended of themselves and others, being called new Converts, were dis∣charged from the Payment of their Debts for the space of three years, and this was done the better to disappoint their Creditors of the Reformed Reli∣gion with whom they had mostly dealt: Nor content with this, by another way
they quite discharged them of such Debts as those of that Religion had contracted in common. These Proceedings served only as a Prologue to that which was afterward acted on the Unchristian-like Stage of France; for the Councils, influenced by the Priests, who aimed more at the E∣states of the Protestants than their Reli∣gion, finding these ways not so effectual as they expected; and perceiving that many of the more wealthy made over their Estates, and left the Country, exhibited a Prohibition of selling, or alienating any Estates whatsoever, the King annulling and breaking all Con∣tracts, and other Acts, relating to such Sale or Alienation, if it did not appear that after any such Act they did not stay in the Kingdom a whole year; so that being deprived of all means to trans∣port their effects, and yet not suffered to enjoy them with any quiet, many pre∣ferring a good Conscience before world∣ly Riches, proposed to leave all they had, and with it the Kingdom; but this took no effect; for hereupon they were forbidden it under severe Penalties, which drove them to so great a strait, that they knew not what offer or pro∣posal
to make, finding every thing hazardous and uncertain: But they were not long without new Proofs of Roman Severity; for though they had already fleeced them, yet not so contented, the Intendents in their Districts had orders to weigh them down, if possible, with hea∣vy Taxes, by charging them with those of the new Converts, who were dischar∣ged from paying any, in favour of their pretended Conversion, or by laying o∣thers on them, which they termed Du∣ties; so that he who was before assessed in the Roll for 40 or 50 Livres, escaped well, if he came off for 5 or 600, and those that delayed, or had not the Money, were obliged to quarter Dragoons, and suffer Imprisonment till they had made payment. And to pass over many things of the like Nature, though the Prote∣stants neglected nothing, either by way of Supplication, or endeavouring to ju∣stifie their Rights, and manifest the wrong done them before the Judges in the respective Provinces; it was but like Water thrown upon lce, the more to harden it: But the Priests fearing this manner of Submission might mollifie the King, who is not over much given to relent, they used all their Interests to
push him on to a violenter motion; so that the Papists gave out, he was resol∣ved not to suffer any Hugonots (so they called the Protestants) to live in the Kingdom; nor, like Pharoah, would he suffer them at the same time to depart. The Project by this time being grown ripe for Cruelty, they began with Bearn, where the Dragoons, committed their first Ravages, and after that, in High and Low Guinne, Xantoigne, Poictou, High Languedock Vivarets, and Dauphin, with some other places in those Coun∣tries; and after that in Lionois, Low Languedock, Gevennes, Valees, Provence, and the Countries of Geix, and then in Normandy, Bougoigne, Nivernois, Berry, and the Countries of Orleance, Tourain, Anjou, Bretaign, Champaign, Piccardy, the Isles of France, and even in Paris it self, and in all Parts where any of the Reformed Religion had Habitations, or were fled for shelter; and the first thing the Intendents were ordered to doe, was to Summon the Cities and Commonal∣ties, who were to assemble the Inhabit∣tants of the respective Places, professing the Protestant Religion, and let them know it was the King's Pleasure they should turn Roman Catholicks, or they
should be forc'd to doe it; at which the poor people greatly surprized, in an humble manner replyed, They were ready to sacrifice their Lives and Estates to the Service of the King, but their Consciences being Gods' alone, they could not in that manner dispose of them. Upon Refusal, the Dragoons who were at hand, were immediately sent for, who in a furious manner seizing the Gates and Avenues of the Cities and Villages, guarding the Passes that none might escape, they often came with their Swords in their hands, crying Kill, kill, or else be Catholicks; and where∣ever they came, like the Locust, they devoured every good thing, being Quar∣tered upon the Protestants at discretion, with a Charge not to suffer them to de∣part out of their Houses, or conceal any of their Goods, under great Penalties to the Papists that should receive or comfort them; and having eaten up their Provisions, and plundred all that was of value, which they sold to the nighbouring Catholicks, they in an inhu∣mane manner fell upon their Persons: And now prepare to hear what even the Turks may blush to own.
After many Revilings, Curses, and Ex∣ecrations, they proceeded to hang up Men and Women by the Hair, or Feet, on the Roofs of Chambers or Chimney holes, where putting Wisps of wet Hay on the Fire under them, they smoaked them till they were almost suffocated; and when they had taken them down, if they would not sign to an Abjuration they hung them up again, or tossed them to and fro into great Fires till they were in a manner roasted: Under the Arms of some they tied Ropes, and plunged them in Wells till they were half drowned, swearing to finish their Lives there, unless they would promise to change their Re∣ligion: Others they bound like Crimi∣nals, when putting to them the Questi∣on, they placed Funnels in their Mouths, and pouted Wine down their Throats, till having deprived them of their Rea∣son, they obliged them to say they would be Catholicks: Some again they stripp'd naked, and pricked with Pins and Bodkins, till they were no longer able to endure it: Others they led about by the Noses with Pincers, and wounded them with Pen knives: They beat some with Staves and dragged them, after much cruel usage, to the Churches,
where they construed their being pre∣sent, though against their Wills, for an Abjuration: Some again they kept wa∣king, by tossing them from one Soldier to another, and throwing Buckets of Water in their Faces for many Nights and Days; and the better to put them in∣to a disorder and confusion, clapped Kettles and Brass Pans upon their heads, whereon they made a continual noise with the Hilts of their Swords, till they had in a manner made the Party distract∣ed: And where they found any sick or languishing, thither they brought Drums and Trumpets into the Chambers, to di∣sturb and torment them from taking rest; nor did they in some Places for∣bear to bind the Fathers and Husbands, whilst they forced and ravished their Wives and Daughters before their faces: Of some they plucked off the Nails, of others burnt the Feet, and blew with Bellows into the Fundaments of others, till they were ready to burst; with many other Cruelties that Hell could inspire, or witty horrour invent, And if by all these Strategems they could not work upon them to abjure their Reli∣gion and the Profession of the true Faith, then had they noisome Dungeons prepa∣red
to imprison them in, where many of them languished to Death; nor did the Rage against their Persons suffice, for they demolished their Houses, cut down their Woods, spoiled their pleasant Gar∣dens and Ortyards, seized their Children, and thrust them into Monasteries, and put them to be brought up under the tu∣ition of Priests, and fold whatever was saleable; and for those they found had escaped them, they hunted in the Woods as for wild Beasts, miserably using such as fell into their hands. In these cruel Proceedings of the French Papists to their own Country∣men, there was a Decorum used; for, be∣sides the Leaders and Military Officers, at the head of these Tormenters mar∣ched the Intendents, and the Bishops, every one in his Diocese; as also a Troup of Missionary Monks and Friars, &c. as for the Intendents they gave such Or∣ders as they thought most expedient for the carrying on of the hopefull Conver∣sion, and to restrain natural Pity and Compassion, if at any time, which was but rare, it found place in the Hearts of the Dragoons, or their Commanders: The Bishops were to take the Abjurati∣ons, and to make a severe inspection,
that it should be done in all points ac∣cording to the mind and intention of the Clergy, and the Missionaries were to be assisting, in forcing the Abjuration. And when by this means they had forced ma∣ny to an outward compliance, they in∣creased the sorrow of those that perseve∣red by sending them more Guests. Nor could the City of Paris, secure such as re∣tired thither, though Persons of consi∣derable Quality; for upon notice that several had fled the storm, and were shel∣tered in that great City, leaving their Lands and Livings to the spoil and ha∣vock of the Soldiers, they were com∣manded within fifteen days to leave that Place, and retire to their Habitations by a Decree of the Council; and although they humbly besought the King to stop the Course of Cruelty that raged against them, those that attempted it had no o∣ther Answer, than to be sent Prisoners to the Bastile; and to prevent such as should attempt to flie from their Habi∣tations, the Provosts had Orders to scowre the Roads, and the Magistrates to stop and send back such as they found removing, without exception: Nor were there Informers wanting on this oc∣casion; and if the Husband had concea∣led
his Wife or Children, he was tormen∣ted till he had brought them back again: Nor were some who pretended to be new Converts, though for the most part the Off-scums and Refuse of Gaols, less active than the Renegadoes of Algier to add to the misery of the suffering Peo∣ple; nor would a bare signing the Abju∣ration serve turn, for they were com∣pelled to go to Mass receive the Com∣munion, and tell their Beads, having always Eyes over them; so that upon the least Information of neglect they were severely fined, or thrown into their former miseries: Yet it pleased the Di∣vine Providence, that notwithstanding the Sea-Ports were stopped and narrow∣ly watched, many of them got off and were kindly received in Holland and Eng∣land, and plentifully relieved, settling such as were capable of it in Business and Employments: But upon notice of these Escapes, the Forreign Vessels in the Ports were ordered to be searched and none to embark or be carried off without he or she produced a Certificate from the Bishop or Curate, to certifie him or her a Roman Catholick; and several who attempted to escape were seized and imprisoned as Traitors.
The storm, as to its fury, being a lit∣tle moderate amongst the Laity, by reason there was no great matters of Plunder to be had, they resolved at last to begin with the Ministers, who had been hitherto pretty well secured in their Persons, by the Edict of Nants, which allowed them limitary Congregations; but the Court being of opinion that so long as they remained in France their Authority would restrain the Protestants from changing their Religion, and leave them but slenderly assured of their new Converts, the greater part of which they well knew had done what they did by constraint; therefore in the first place they laboured to stifle their Writings, prohibiting all manner of Books that should any ways instruct the Lay-Prote∣stants, or were Written by their Mini∣sters: And although the French Clergy, to have it thought they were not the Promoters of the Persecution, seemed unwilling to consent to the Revocation of that Edict, yet it was soon after Re∣voked, and another made, consisting of Twelve Articles. The first repeals and suppresses all former Edicts in all their Extent, and ordains that all the Reformed Churches or Chapels that
are found in Kingdom shall be de∣molished. The Second prohibits all sorts of religious Assemblies, of what kind soever, out of the Roman Commu∣nion. The Third forbids the like Ex∣ercise to all Lords and Gentlemen of any Quality, under Penalties of corpo∣ral Punishment, and confiscation of E∣state. The Fourth banishes all the Mi∣nisters, enjoining them to depart with in fifteen days-after the publication of the Edict, under Penalty of being sent to the Galleys. The Sixth promises Recom∣pences and Advantages to the Ministers and their Widows that should change their Religion. The Seventh and Eighth for bid instructing Children in the Re∣formed Religion, and ordain, that those who shall be henceforth Born and Bapti∣zed shall be brought up in the Roman Ca∣tholick Religion; enjoining their Parents to send them to the Churches under a pe∣nalty of five hundred Livres as a fine. The Ninth allows four months time to such Persons as have departed the Kingdom to return, or upon failure, to have their Goods and Estates confiscated. The Tenth forbids all those of the Reformed Religion, together with their Wives
and Children, to depart, or to convey away their Effects, under pain of the Galleys for the Men, and confiscation of Body and Goods for the Women. The Eleventh confirms a former Declaration to punish those that Relapse. The Twelfth declares, that as to the rest of the Subjects of the Religion, they may remain in the Cities of his Kingdom, and Lands of his Obedience, there to continue their Commerce and enjoy their Estates, without trouble or mo∣lestation, upon pretence of the said Re∣ligion, on condition they have no As∣semblies under pretext of Praying or exercising any religious Worship what∣ever. The very day this Edict was publi∣shed, so hasty were these Dragoon. Con∣verters, that they began to demolish the famous Church of Chreenton, the elder Minister belonging to it being comman∣ed to leave Paris within Twenty four hours, and with all convenient speed depart the Kingdom; and thereupon he was committed to the Charge of one of the King's Foot men, with an express Order not to part with him till he was out of the Confines of France; but his Colleagues had Forty eight hours given
them to leave the City, and were per¦mitted to depart upon their Parole; and the rest had the time limited, but with so many vexations, that none but Men of great firmness of mind could have born it; for they not only denied them all their Movables and Books, but e∣ven their private Papers, under pretence that they knew not whether they were theirs, or belonged to the Consistory; but what was more cruel, they refused their Fathers or Mothers, Brothers or Sisters, or any of their near Relations to accom∣pany them, though many of them were aged and infirm, and must, unless supported by an extraordinary Provi∣dence, perish, without their succour and assistence: nor was this all, for they kept from them their Children above the Age of seven, and some, where they had a more peculiar spight against the Father, that were scarcely weaned; nor would they allow a Nurse to the sucking Children where the Mother's Milk was dried up, and she incapable of giving them sustenance of that kind; and although they had Pasports, yet were they stopped upon the Borders, in divers places, by the malice of the Pa∣pists, under pretence they must present∣ly
prove they were the same Persons mentioned, and that there was no cri∣minal Process, or Information charged against them, and justifie that they car∣ried away nothing belonging to their Congregations; and this they did upon no other pretence than to ensnare them by spinning out the limited time for their Departure; for the days being expired, though they themselves were the de∣tainers, in plain terms they told them their time was relapsed, and there was no hopes of escaping the Galleys. But now the Ports, Ways, and Fords, and all Places throughout the Kingdom, were so strictly guarded, and narrowly searched by the Officers of the Forts and Customs, Soldiers and Peasants, that most of those that endeavoured to escape, were seized, and hurried to Pri∣son, whereby the Gaols became thron∣ged and crouded; nor had they the fa∣vour of common Malefactours, but were thrust into Dungeons, and noisome places, their Friends not daring to visit or re∣lieve them, by which means a great num∣ber perished through hunger, and other inconveniencies; and although the Twelfth Article promises to secure the Laity in their Properties, Possessions,
and Callings, yet the French Papists have not forgot the Decree of Constance, wherein it is expressed, That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks, as they call the Protestants, for the same cruelty and in∣humanity continued with as great Rage and Fury, where there was any plunder to be had, or people of Note dwelling: In Picardy, Normandy, Le Berry, Cam∣paigne, Orleance, Neivernois, Belessois, and the Isles of France, nay, in Paris it self, after the Edict was published, the Procurator-General, and some other Magistrates, sent for the Heads of di∣vers Families, and declared to them, That it was the King's positive Will that they should change their Religion, and that if they would not comply they should be made to doe it; and so procee∣ded by Letters under the Princes Seal, to banish the Elders of the Consistory, and such persons as they found, or at least conceived inflexible. One thing is remarkable, viz. Mon∣sieur Saignelay, Secretary of State, ha∣ving sent for to his House, under di∣vers pretences; about 100 Merchants, and others, he caused the Doors to be shut upon them, and instead of the bu∣siness they expected, presented them
with an Abjuration, commanding them in the King's name to sign it, declaring with a stern Countenance, they should not stir out at the Door till they had done it: The purport of it was this, That they should not only abjure the Heresie of Calvin, and enter into the Catholick Church, but declare that they did it voluntarily, or without being for∣ced or compelled to it; and although they many ways excused it, yet being sharply reprimanded, and terrified by his Threats, not being fore-warned of such a danger, and doubting the ill conse∣quence that might attend it, they at last, not voluntarily, but by constraint, signed that Abjuration: Nor by the power and influence of the Clergy, did the Magi∣strates refrain to take away Children from their Parents, to bring up in their superstitious way of idolatrous Wor∣ship, frequently separating the Man and Wife, where they could gain upon the one, or the other, to Apostatize. Nor did they spare to doe this in Orange, the sovereign Principality of his Highness the Prince, where the French King, by Right, has no power, but taking away the Ministers by force, committed them to Prison; the Dragoons, as it has been already hinted, doing there mischiefs
much in likeness as in other Places, as well to the people as to the Officers of his Highness, to whom that Principality belongs. And much in this nature the Calamity of the suffering Protestants continued in the Kingdom of France, to the year 1685. Nor do they fail at this day to make good, as much as in them lies, what their Clergy threaten in their Pastoral Letters, by making it their study to invent new manner of Torments, the Magistrates being ever ready to assist them in the Execution. I might go on with this melancholy Story to the swelling of a large Volume, and add to it the Cruelty of the Savoy∣ards against the Protestants in the Coun∣tries under that Duke, whose Miseries equal, if not exceed, that I have men∣tioned; as likewise in sundry other pla∣ces, and indeed in all places where the Papists have power, but that the digres∣sion will seem too long; and therefore I only give the Reader a taste of what has been served up in full Banquets of Cru∣elty and Revenge, thereby to let those that are at this day un-informed, know what they must expect, if they come into the hands of such as account it merito∣rious to destroy Hereticks, nor think it any Crime to break the most solemn
Oaths, and make void all Protestations and Engagements, when they suppose it advantageous to their Interest, or Church's Cause: And note by the way, that all of the Reformed Religion, who have separated from the Traditions, Er∣rours, and Idolatrous Worship of Rome, pass with them for no other. These Proceedings however turned at last to the disadvantage of the Persecutors; for, though for a time it enriched them, yet the number of People that fled, or were ruined, occasioned the decay of Trade and Commerce, so that those Revenues that supplied the French King's Coffers, and enabled him to vex all Europe, by a tedious War being exhausted, notwith∣standing he had taken Luxemburgh from the Spaniards, he found himself in a low condition; for money being the very si∣news of War, and his Subjects not for∣ward to lend, as appears by the Answer of the Bankers of Paris, when he sent to them the last year for several Millions of Livres, viz That they humbly beg∣ged his Excuse, forasmuch that if they so far weakened the Bank, they could not support their Credit in answering the Bills that should be drawn upon them; He then, I say, found that when
by such unjust means he depopulated his Kingdom, he fought against himself: but to return. The Prince of Orange all this while highly disapproved his Proceedings, and if in Arms he did not oppose them, it was not for want of Will; but rather that he on his part would keep the Peace inviolable, and rather bear, till a far∣ther opportunity, the affront and injury done him, in the wrong his Subjects of the Principality of Orange had re∣ceived, than involve the States in a new War; which might have been justly excu∣sed, since the French were the Aggressors. But to come yet nearer to the purpose: Whilst his Highness was diverting and reposing himself from the Toils of War, which now ceased by the conclu∣sion and ratifying of the Treaty with France, His Majesty of Great Britain, King Charles II. after five or six days indisposition, departed this Life at his Palace Royal of White-Hall on the 6th. of February, 1684. not only to the extraordinary Grief of his Subjects, but of all Europe, their Highnesses more especially bearing a superlative part in the sorrow the loss of that good King occasioned, whose Funeral was private∣ly
solemnized on the 14th. of February towards the Evening in King Henry the Seventh's Chapell, where it was inter∣red in Vault under the East-end of the South-Isle; Service being ended, and the Officers of his Houshold having broke their Staves, the Royal Style was pro∣claimed by another of the Kings at Arms, according to the Custome: And thus set this great Monarch, who had been so usefull and dear to the Interest of Christendom, making way thereby for his Brother, who was immediately proclaimed, &c. and accordingly was Crowned at Westminster, on the twenty third of April following, with much splendour and magnificence, as is usual at the Royal Ceremonies of the Corona∣tion of the Kings of Great Britain, &c. and had the Condolement and Congra∣tulation, the one for the Death of King Charles, and the other for His Majesty's Accession to the Throne, not only from the States-General, but from most of the European Princes. And now the States of Holland being in frequent Consults about the Affairs of that Republick, be∣tween the Adjournments his Highness the Prince of Orange diverted himself in visiting the Towns and Fortifications,
and settling Military Affairs; and the better to remove the Melancholy the Death of the King his Uncle had occasi∣oned, recreated himself at his Country Palace; when in the mean while the Duke of Monmouth, and Earl of Argile, going from Holland with an inconsidera∣ble number of Men, the former to in∣vade England, and the latter Scotland, their Expeditions proved altogether successless for being severally routed, and taken by the King's Forces, they suffered Death, together with divers others of their Adherents and Abettors. In July, 1687. his Highness returning from Hounstyrdyke to the Hague, he there gave Audience to several foreign Mini∣sters, and then parted thence to visit the Garisons of Maestricht, Boisleduck, and others belonging to the States, and in his Return was met by Her Royal High∣ness at Loo, he having in his Progress gi∣ven necessary Orders for the well gover∣ning and strengthening of those Places: In December the Marquess d' Albe∣ville, Envoy extraordinary from his Ma∣jesty of Great Britain, had Audience of his Highness the Prince of Orange, and the States of Holland, but they adjour∣ning to the 7th. of January, great pre∣parations
of Fire-works were made in the mean while to entertain Her Royal Highness the Princess of Orange, on New-years-day, representing a Battel, with four lines, ranged with several Bat∣teries, lively expressing the manner of an Engagement. Now the foreign Priests coming again into remembrance, and being looked upon as Enemies to the Common-wealth, notwithstanding the intercession that had been made on their behalf, the Court of Justice at the Hague drew up a Decree, comman∣ding them to retire out of the Country, and never to return again, promising a Reward of 100 Ducatoons to any that should make discovery, and settling a penalty of 600 Florins upon those that should harbour and conceal any of them, for the first time; 1200 for the second; and corporal punishment for the third Offence; whereupon a great many of them fled into England, where indeed there was but too many before: And now the Spring coming on, the Prince and Princess of Orange went to their Palace at Loo. The King of England, for private Reasons of State, being about this time desirous to call home the English Regi∣ments
in the Service of the States-Ge∣neral, the Marquess d' Albeville made it known immediately to their Lordships, but they not willing to part with those Forces, he proceeded to put in his Me∣morials, representing not only his Resent∣ment of that Refusal, but the danger of Officers and Soldiers might incurr; but the States having before-hand dis∣banded them, and listed them under their own Command, as many as would enter themselves, (which was the grea∣test Part of them, as well Officers as Soldiers,) this business came to nothing; and although his Majesty had ordered the Masters and Captains of Ships and Vessels, to give such as would return free Passage, with promise of Advance∣ment, yet not many came over. In May the Elector of Saxony was splendidly entertained by his Highness the Prince of Orange, at Hounslaerdyke, and the next day his Highness accompa∣nied him to Scheveling, where they went on Board a small Vessel that carried them to a Squadron of 17 Men of War, arrived from Schonevelt, under the Com∣mand of Vice-Admiral Allemond, who sent upon their Approach two light Fri∣gats, and a Shallop, to meet them,
and were saluted with the Cannon of all the Ships; when having Dined on board the Vice-Admiral, they returned to Scheveling, and from thence his Ele∣ctoral Highness of Saxony went to visit Delf, Rotterdam, Dort, Maestricht, Leige Aix, and Cologne, and so returned home by the way of Francfort; when in the mean while the Heer Van Diest acquain∣ted the Prince of Orange, and the States, with the Death of the Elector of Bran∣denburgh, a person most firm to the Protestant Interest, and whose Death was regretted by the Protestant Prin∣ces and States, so that both the Prince and the States of Holland immediately nominated a fit person to go and make their Complement of Condolence to the present Elector. The next month the Marquess d' Albeville, acquainted the Prince and Princess of Orange, as also the States, with the News of the Queen of England's being delivered of a Son, at their Royal Palace of St. James's, on Sunday the 10th. of June; and soon af∣ter the News, by sundry Expresses, was likewise made known to the King's Mi∣nisters in all the Courts of Christendom, who, at a vast Expence and Magnifi∣cence, proclaimed it, and the Conduits in London were commanded to run with
Wine, and a Thanksgiving day was likewise held for the Queens safe Deli∣very; Congratulations were made, upon this occasion, by all the Foreign Ministers, and the Infant soon after or∣dered to be prayed for in the publick Prayers of the Church. Some Addresses were likewise presented upon that occa∣sion, and the Romanists flattered them∣selves with a lasting Tranquillity; and so sure they thought they were of gaining the point, that the Lord Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, the Lord Bishops of Ely, Peterborough, St. Asaph, Chichester, Bath and Wells, and Bristol (who had been committed by an Order of Council to the Tower, for humbly beseeching his Majesty by Petition to remit his Com∣mands of enjoyning his Declaration for Liberty of Conscience to be read in the Churches, in time of Divine Service) were brought to their Tryalls at the King's-Bench Court Westminster, where, notwithstanding all that was alledged against them, and the pressing Argu∣ments of a Popish Judge, then upon the Bench, their Candour and Innocence so fairly and plainly appeared, that instead of their Adversaries proving that Petiti∣on a Libel, it was evidently demonstrated that they had done nothing but their
The Papists, to leave no stone unturned that they might secure themselves for the future as well as the present▪ used many Arts and Insinuations to sound the Inten∣tions and thoughts of their Highnesses, the Prince and Princess of Orange, where∣upon Mr. James Stewart took upon him, & that not without the King's knowledge and approbation, as appears by the Let∣ter writ to Minn Heer Fagel, Pentio∣nary of Holland, and West-Friezeland, upon the King's publishing his Declara∣tion for Liberty of Conscience, and in∣tention to take away the Test and Penal Laws, which occasioned his Answer, in substance this, though little to the sa∣tisfaction of the Roman Catholicks, viz. That their Highnesses have often declared, as they did more particularly to the Marquess Albeville, his Majesties Envoy extraordi∣nary to the States, That it is their Opinion, that no Christian ought to be persecuted for his Conscience, or be ill used because he differs from the publick and established Re∣ligion, and therefore they could be content, that even the Papists in England, Scotland, and Ireland, might be suffered to continue in their Religion with as much Liberty as is allowed them by the States of the Ʋnited Provinces, and as for the Protestant Dis∣senters,
their Highnesses did not only con∣sent, but heartily approved of their having an entire Liberty, for the full Exercise of their Religion, without any trouble or hin∣drance, &c. That their Highnesses were ready, in case his Majesty of England should desire it, to declare their willingness to concurr in the set∣tling and confirming this Liberty as far as it lay in them, and were ready, if desired, to concurr in the Repealing the Laws, provi∣ded always that those Laws remain still in their full vigor, by which the Roman Chatho∣licks are shut out of both Houses of Parlia∣ment, out of all Employments, Ecclesiastical, Civil, and Military, as likewise all those other Laws, which confirm the Protestant Religion, and which secure it against all the Attempts of the Roman Catholicks. But that their Highnesses could not agree to the Repealing of the Test, or those Penal Laws that tend to the security of the Prote∣stant Religion, since the Roman Catholicks receive no more prejudice from these than the being excluded from Parliaments, or from publick Employments, and that by them the Protestant Religion is covered from all the Designs of the Roman Catholicks against it, or against the publick safety; and neither the Tests, nor those other Laws, can be said to
carry in them any Severity against the Ro∣man Catholicks, upon Account of their Con∣sciences; they being only Provisions quali∣fying Men to be Members of Parliament, or to be capable of bearing Offices, by which they must declare before God and Men, that they are for the Protestant Religion; so that all this amounts to no more than a securing the Protestant Religion, from any prejudice that it may receive from Roman Catholicks. That their Highnesses have thought, and do still think, that more than this ought not to be asked or expected from them, since by this means the Roman Catholick: and their Posterity would be for ever secured from all troubles, in their Persons or Estates, or in the Exercise of their Religion; and that the Roman Catholicks ought to be satisfied with this, and not to disquiet the Kingdom because they cannot be admitted to sit in Par∣liament, or to be in Employment, or because those Laws in which the security of the Pro∣testant Religion does chiefly consist are not repealed, by which they may be put in a con∣dition to over-turn it. That their Highnesses also believed, that Dissenters would be for ever satisfied when they should be for ever covered from all dan∣ger of being disturbed, or punished for the free Exercise of their Religion, upon any sort of pretence what soever.
These things we find in the Letter of that great Minister of State, as the just Sentiments of their Highnesses, which did not at all please the Court; and percei∣ving the Wind averse in that quarter, Mr. Stewart in his other Letter tells the Pensioner a while after, That the Court was quite beyond it, and had taken other measures, &c. About this time an account being given by the persons who had it in charge, and for that intent made it their Business to visit the most considerable places in England and Wales, how the people stood affected, in relation to the taking off the Penal Laws and Tests, if they should be chosen Members of Parli∣ament or were qualified for chusing. The King being at Windsor the 24th. of Au∣gust, he declared in Council, That pur∣suant to his Declaration he resolved to call a Parliament, to meet the 27th. of November following, and ordered the Lord Chancellor to issue out Writs on that behalf the 18th. of September, af∣ter the sitting of that Council; and ac∣cordingly Writs were prepared, but were stopped and recalled, upon certain notice that his Highness the Prince of Orange
was preparing for England, more of which I shall have occasion to mention hereafter. About the beginning of September, the Prince went to meet the Elector of Bran∣denburgh, going from Loo on the 5th. for Minden, as also to meet some other Princes and Noble-men of Germany; which so allarm'd the French King, that the Count d' Avanx, the French Am∣bassadour presented a Memorial to the Sates-General by the Order of his ma∣ster, who mistaking the measures the Prince intended at that time to take, complained therein, That the King his Master being informed of the motions and Coferences that were made and held towards the Frontiers of Cologne, against the Cardinal of Fustemburgh, and that Chapter, he was resolved to maintain the Cardinal and the Privileges against all those that should go about to trouble them, &c. No sooner did his Highness return from that Confe∣rence to Loo, but Orders were taken to draw the Forces together, in order to the Encampment upon the Mooker Hyde, and the Forces of the other Princes had Orders to be upon their march, as those of Brandenburgh, Hesse Cassel, &c. and
on the 16th. of September the States as∣sembled at the Hague, where his High∣ness the Prince of Orange was present, continuing in debating several matters of great weight and consequence, but as to the particulars we are wanting; however it was generally suspected that the King had Intelligence that the great prepara∣tons of Naval and Land Forces were intended for England; when contrary to expectation, His Majesty, in his Declara∣tion bearing Date the 20th. of Septem∣ber, relating to the Regulating Electi∣ons, has this Clause, viz We are willing the Roman Catholicks shall remain incapable to be Members of the House of Commons, &c. and on the 26th. an Order was publish∣ed to restore the Deputy-Lieutenants, and such Gentlemen as had been put out of their Offices, and Commissions; and the next publick account we had, was the King's Proclamation, bearing Date the 25th. of September, giving a large Account of his Highness's Intentions to pass the Seas, and land in England, and the Marquess d' Albeville presented a Memorial to the Deputies of the States-General upon that Subject, yet the pre∣parations went on, and whilst the Mar∣quess expected an Answer to his Memo∣rial,
the Troups embarked, and her Highness, and the Mareschal de Scomberg came to the Hague: And so far wrought the News of these preparations, that Magdalen College in Oxford was orde∣red to be restored and settled; settled; London was likewise restored her antient Char∣ter; other Corporations were restored to their Charters and Magistrates, and the Church of England had immediately the right hand of Fellowship, which made ma∣ny wonder to see things so suddenly changed; the suffering Bishops were re∣ceived into favour, and had leave to make their proposals for the good settle∣ment and constitution of the Govern∣ment, and the Popish Party that was so lately Paramount, began to droop; so wonderfully wrought the terrour of his Highness's Approach. On the 15th. of October, the Infant who had before been privately Christen∣ed, was publickly named, amidst the Ceremonies and Rites of Baptism, in the Chapel at St. James's, by the Name James Francis▪Edward, the Pope being God▪father by his Nuncio, and the Queen Dowager God mother, the King and Queen, with many others, as∣sisting. And now great preparations
were made to take the Field, and Sut∣lers encouraged to attend the Army, with more Freedom and Advantage than formerly; for News came on the 23d. of October, that the Troups were all on Ship-board; and that his High∣ness the Prince of Orange would embark so soon as the Ships in the Texel had joi∣ned those that lay in the Maese, and that the States upon the Arrest the French had made of the Dutch Ships in their Ports, had published a Placart, prohibiting the Importation of French Commodities, till they were released; and various reports, going abroad, the King put out a Pro∣clamation, prohibiting the spreading of Rumours and False News. On Friday the 26th. Old-style, the Fleet having the Equipage on Board, consisting of Fifty two men of War, and a very numerous attendence of Victual∣lars, and Vessels for the Transportation of the Land Forces, Sailed between three and four of the Clock in the Afternoon, from the Flats near the Bril, with the Wind at South West and by South; the Prince embarked on a Vessel of be∣tween Twenty eight and Thirty Guns; there likewise embarked the Count de Solmes, the Count de Stirum, the Sieur
Benting, the Sieur Overkirk, the Mare∣schal de Schomberg, his Son Count Charles, with several others, as well English No∣ men as Strangers; and the next day they came in sight of Scheveling, when the Wind came more Westward, but the Weather not being favourable, some ships and small Vessels, on which the Horse were on board, suffered damage, and the Fleet by that means delayed; yet gain setting Sail on the 3d. of Novem∣r, between ten and eleven of the Clock  the morning, about half Seas over;  Fleet came within sight of Dover, d were passing by , till about five in he Afternoon; at what time they were  past that place, without any inter∣ption from the English Fleet, who lay ithin sight of them; and Stearing a Chanel course westward, the Wind at st North-east, a very fresh Gale.  the 5th. of November, about 300 il came into Torbay, in the County of Devon; and several of them directly to rixam Key, and landed there Soldiers  secure the landing of the rest, if any Opposition should be made; so that five or six hundred presently got on Land, nd put themselves in a posture of De∣ence, whilst the rest were fending on
shoar, some by Boats, and some by the help of the Tide: And so far were the Country people from being in a conster∣nation, that on such occasions frequent∣ly falls out, that they on the contrary not only congratulated his Highness's Arrival, but brought plenty of Provisi∣ons and Necessaries for the Soldiers, and such as came on shoar; there being only three small Vessels missing of the whole Fleet; whereof two, a Pink, and a Fish∣ing-boat, were taken by the Woolwich, below Hole Haven; there being on board some Horse: The other was a Fly-boat, taken by the Swallow Frigat, having on board four Companies of Foot, of Col∣lonel Babington's Regiment, comman∣manded by Major Collambine: However the men were kindly used, especially the Soldiers; and these had not been ta∣ken, but by their separation from the Fleet. As to the number of Horse and Foot, as also the Fleet, take the follow∣ing List, as it was said to be Printed in Holland. HORSE. THe Life Guard. Regiment of Guards Commanded by the Sieur Benting. Waldeck's Regiment. Nassau. Mompelian. Ginckel. Count Vanderlip. The Prince's Dragoons.

So by this it appears, that his High∣ness had effectually 14352. persons un∣der his command, not accounting those that came over Voluntiers; and these, past peradventure, rather increased than diminished, during the Fleet, which by this Account consisted of 635. great and small Ships and Vessels, lying in the Roads, for some time after this List was published. But to return again to Torbay. His Highness having in good order landed the greatest part of the Horse and Foot, and given Directions for the speedy landing the rest, and the Cannon to be un-shipped, for the more conve∣niency at Topsham, he marched towards the City of Exeter, with the general Approbation, Shouts, and Applause of the People, who flocked from all parts to welcome him; and divers Gentlemen of those parts came to wait upon him, and tender their service upon his ap∣proach, the Bishop retired, and the Gates were closed, by Order of the Mayor, but without baracadoing or fa∣stening, so that being soon opened, an advanc'd party enter'd, and was joyfully received by the Inhabitants, a great ma∣ny of them having before their coming,
listed themselves for the service of the Prince; and into this City his Highness entred with great Splendour the Friday after his landing, and took up his Resi∣dence in the Bishop's Palace; giving a strict command to all the Officers and and Soldiers, that they should behave themselves orderly and civilly, to all manner of persons, duly and diligently observing to defray their Quarters, and offering no manner of Injury nor Vio∣lence, under severe Penalties, and such Regiments as that City could not quar∣ter, were appointed other Stations. In this City, in a full Auditory, his Highness's first Declaration was read; shewing the Reasons of his coming over, and inducing him to appear in Arms in the Kingdom of England; for the preserving the Protestant Religion, and for the restoring the Laws and Li∣berties of England, Scotland, and Ire∣land; setting forth, How they had been manifestly Violated by Evil Counsellours, and Ministers of State, to the great Op∣pression of the people, and endangering the Subversion of the Religion, and Establi∣shed Government of these Kingdoms, and to bring them under Popery and Slavery: With many other cogent and pressing
Reasons, set forth at large in that De∣claration; and especially a clause where∣in his Highness expresses his doubts, as likewise those of the Nation, concer∣ning the true Birth of the Infant; and this part it was, that caused the King to call the extraordinary Council, that met in the Council Chamber, a White-Hall, on the 22d. of October, where, before a considerable number of Peers, Ministers of State, Officers of the Houshold, the Judges, the King's Council, the Lord Mayor, and Court of Aldermen of the City, &c. where the Depositions of 41 Persons as to their knowledge in that matter, con∣sisting of both Sexes were given in; and on the 27th. of October they were enrol∣led in the Court of Chancery, together with those of the Earl of Huntington, and Earl of Peterborough, who were not present when the Depositions were taken in the Council Chamber, but given in the Chancery Court: All which Proceedings are printed at large, and not greatly to our purpose; but to them I therefore refer the more inquisitive Reader. The Prince continuing still in the City of Exeter, gave necessary Orders for the Settlement of the Revenue of
those Parts, arising by Excise, and other Duties, where the King's Officers were at that time remiss in their Attendence, some of them being Roman Catholicks, and fled, he appointed the Lord Wilt∣shire, Mr. Herbert, and Mr. Row, Com∣missioners, for the more prudent Ma∣nagement, and sent out Parties to pur∣chase Horses for their Service; His Highness recreating himself at times, by taking a view of the Country, but his Army almost hourly increasing, he commanded detached Parties to ad∣vance, and possess themselves of conve∣nient Posts; and in the mean time we had News that the Lord Delamere came to Manchester with a strong Party, and there declared for His Highness the Prince of Orange, and made a Speech to his Tenents, and others, desiring them to meet him the next day at Bodon Downs, the intended Place of Rendez∣vouz; where accordingly he found a great appearance, who willingly sub∣mitted themselves to be disposed under his Command: But the Lord Lovelace being on his way to join with the Prince, with a Party of Horse, was surprized in his Inn at Cirencester by the Militia; and (after a stout resistence, in which
the Major that commanded, together with his Son, and some others, were kil∣led,) his Lordship was taken Prisoner, and afterward carried to Gloucester, but was there rescued by a Party of the Prince's Horse. The King upon notice that his High∣ness the Prince of Orange had left Exe∣ter, and was advancing with his own and the additional Forces that were come in, caused the Train of Artillery to be drawn out of the Tower, being before prepared on Carriages fit to March; and passing towards Salisbury, he prepared his Equipage to be at the Head of his Army, which was ordered to draw together about Salisbury, and accordingly setting out from White-Hall with no great Attendence, he arrived there the 19th. of November, about Four in the Evening, and was met by the Duke of Berwick, the Earl of Feversbam, and other Commanders, on Horse-back, a Mile from the Gates of the City, where he was atten∣ded by the Mayor and Aldermen, in their Formalities, to the Bishop's Palace, ap∣pointed for his Lodgings; and there perceiving an almost general falling off of the Nobility and Gentry, as well as the Forces under his Pay, and that di∣vers
Lords were up in the North, he issued out a Proclamation, bearing Date the 20th. of November, offering a Par∣don to all his Subjects that had taken up Arms under the Prince, if they retur∣ned in Twenty Days, and rendered themselves to the Officers Military and Civil, &c. Whilst these things happened, a Par∣ty of the Prince's Men being abroad, and advancing beyond their Strengths, were pursued and charged by Coll. Sarsfield, with 70 Horse, and 30 Dragoons and Granadiers; and overtaking them at Wincanton, they posted themselves be∣hind the Hedges; upon which the Dra∣goons and Granadiers were obliged to dismount, and march up to the Hedges, so that they began to Fire very briskly on both sides, and several were killed and wounded; but Collonel Sarsfield getting into the Field with his Horse, and Charging them in the Rear, they were most of them killed and taken Prisoners. Amongst the Slain was one Cambell, a Lieutenant, who commanded them; and on the King's Party four were killed, and Cornet Web mortally wounded.
This slender Success was clouded, up∣on Notice that the Earl of Bath had Seized upon Plymouth, and made the Earl of Huntington, the Governour thereof, Prisoner; the whole Garison declaring for His Highness, upon rea∣ding his Declarations; the Fleet like∣wise began to grow cold, and many of the Commanders began to declare for the Prince; so that the King not thin∣king it convenient to hazard a Battel with an Army he could no ways ensure to his Interest, upon the near Approa∣ches of the Prince's Forces, (with whom were now a great part of the Nobility) he hastily left Salisbury, draw∣ing off those Forces he had there, and remanding the Train of Artillery re∣turned to White-Hall, where he arrived on the 26th. of November, in the Eve∣ning, and appointed Collonel Beville Skelton Lieutenant of the Tower, in in the Place of Sir Edward Hales; and according to what had been desired by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in their Petition, gave Order to the Lord Chancellour, for Issuing out Writs for the Summoning a Parliament to sit the 15th. day of the ensuing January, and Commissioners were nominated to
treat with the Prince: A Proclamation was likewise publish'd to give timely notice to those that were Electors, or would stand for Candidates: The Bi∣shop of Exeter was likewise nominated Lord Arch-Bishop of the long vacant See of York, and did Homage to the King the day after the Ceremonies of his Translation from the See of Exeter to the Archiepiscopal See of York; which were performed at Lambeth, by his Grace the Lord Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, assisted by the Bishops of St. Asaph, Ely, Rochester, and Peter∣borough. Whilst these things were doing, News came that the Lords in the North had seized upon York, and made the Gover∣nour Prisoner, declaring for the Prince of Orange, and disarming all Papists of note, their Number and Power daily increasing; so that the Lord Mollenax, who was up with a party for the King in those Parts, found himself in no con∣dition to make any head; but soon af∣ter was deserted by most of his Fol∣lowers; and the strong Garison of Hull was secured to the Interest of His Highness, by the Deputy Governour, and by the Assistence of the Soldiers of
his Party, the Towns-men , and some Sea-men that were in the Port; the securing it, according to the Relation, being on this manner. On the 3d. of December, about 9 of the Clock, the Guards being set, and the Tat-too over , the Deputy-Gover∣nour, as it was his place, was preparing to go the Rounds, but the Lord Lang∣dale, the Governour, told him he had ap∣pointed the Lord Montgomery, and Major Fountain, to supply that Duty for the Night; whereupon some Words passing, the Deputy Governour made his Party, and drawing up the Soldiers in Battalia, siezed the Guards, and made the Lord Langdale, the Lord Montgomery, and others, Prisoners; and at break of day a Party was sent over the Bridge, to seize the Castle, and Block-Houses, with the new Citadel; so that the Inhabitants and Sea-men concurring with the Soldiers, that strong Place was entirely secured, and the Mass-House demolished with great joy, and ringing of Bells, and the Prince's Colours were placed upon the high Church; the Papists that had come thither for shelter were turned out, and the Governour dismissed, and guarded a
part of the way to his House, to pre∣vent the danger that threatened him from the Mobile, who began to be very insolent. Divers other places declared likewise for the Prince; and the Duke of Beaufort, who had Com∣manded the County Militia, percei∣ving he could not in that kind advantage the King's Affairs, which were now grown desperate, betook himself to his Retirement; so that the Militia found themselves disbanded. The Noblemen who were sent to treat with his Highness the Prince of Orange, about accommodating the af∣fairs of the Kingdom, not being able to effect in all points what the King desired, the Infant, which had been sent to Portsmouth, either as supposed the securest place, or to pass the Seas, was sent for back in great haste; and the Priests began to shift for themselves, Father Petre was missing, with divers others, who it is supposed, perceiving the desperateness of their condition, made an early escape; and several Councils were held, most of them pri∣vately in the King's Closet, to advise what was to he done in the Juncture of affairs; when on the 9th. of Decem∣ber,
in the Evening, News came that greatly allarm'd the Court, and put it for the most part in a hurry and con∣sternation, viz. That the Prince's Forces had made their way through Reading, and gained the Pass of Twyford-bridge, without any considerable resistence: And thus we find the account of this Acti∣on. About 1500 Horse, and 3 Troups of Irish Dragoons being quartered, or posted in the Town of Reading, were put into a Consternation upon the Re∣port, that a strong advanced Party of the Prince's Army were on their march to beat up their Quarters; so that af∣ter some Consultation of the Officers, it was concluded they should draw off to Twyford-Bridge, and there make good their Post, which accordingly they did; but the Scouts that were sent abroad to discover, coming in, and giving them an account that the Roads were clear, the Commander in chief commanded that Claverhouse Regiment of Scotch Horse, and the Irish Dragoons, should march back, and repossess the Town of Reading, which they did on the Eighth of December at Night, with Orders to be in readiness, and upon their Guards
to prevent surprize; so that most of them kept on Horse-back, some in the Market-place, and others at the Posts assigned them; but there being yet no news of the advanc'd Party, they were commanded by their Officers to alight, and refresh themselves and their Hor∣ses; when at ten of the Clock in the Morning, the Trumpet sounded to Horse, the Prince's Forces being at the Town's end, almost before they were discovered, whereupon a sharp dis∣pute ensued, with brisk Firing on both Parties; the Irish Dragoons bearing the brunt of the Encounter, though the Scotch Horse in small detatched Bodies made some Firings; but they were over∣powered, driven out of the Town, and obliged to retreat to Twyford-Bridge; and in conclusion, many of the King's Party Deserted, and the rest were constrained to quit the Pass, and make the best of their Retreat. In this Skirmish we cannot learn that above Thirty were killed, and several woun∣ded. But now the King having no con∣siderable Forces, especially none capa∣ble of making Head against a prevai∣ling Army; the Queen, who had been at Wind for the day before, to fetch the
Infant, taking her solemn leave of the King, crossed the Thames on the Tenth of December, about Three in the Mor∣ning, where her Coaches waited for her; and so with the Child, and a slen∣der Attendence, made for Dover, or some Port near it, and there took Shipping for France, where she soon after landed, and had a place of Residence appoin∣ted her by the French King. The Queen having left White-Hall, as also a great many of the Courtiers, the King the same Evening called an extraordinary Council; and sent for the Lord Mayor of London, and the Sheriffs; who waiting upon His Majesty, were, amongst other things, charged to have a Care of the City, and keep it in Peace and Quietness, as much as in them lay, and then were dismissed: However, the Council held a long De∣bate, and a meeting was appointed the, the next Morning; but, contrary to the Expectation of almost the whole King∣dom, the King, about Three a Clock in the Night, took Barge at the Privy Stairs, with a small Equipage; and went down the River on his Departure, without giving notice to any of the Offi∣cers of his Houshold, who were then in
The King's Departure, was no soo∣ner spread abroad, but the Lords Spiri∣tual and Temporal that were about Town assembled; and finding White-Hall full of Consternation, after some Debates, they gave order for the dis∣missing Popish Officers and Soldiers; and giving Directions for the keeping of that Palace from Pillage or Spoil, which in that Confusion might have happen∣ed, they adjourned immediately to the Guild Hall of the City of London, where, by their Order, the Lord Mayor had summoned the Court of Aldermen, and thither they sent for Collonel Bevil Skel∣ton, Lieutenant of the Tower; and or∣dered him, to resign up that important Citadel to the Lord Lucas, in trust of the City, till other Measures could be taken; and proceeded to approve and sign the following Declaration, viz. We doubt not, but the World believes, that in this great and dangerous Conjun∣cture We are Heartily and Zealously con∣cerned for the Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties and Properties of the Subject; and we did reasonably hope, that the King having Issued out his Proclamation and Writs for a Free
Parliament, We might have rested secure under the Expectation of that Meeting; but His Majesty having withdrawn him∣self, and as we apprehend, in order to his Departure out of the Kingdom, by the pernicious Counsels of Person, ill-affected to our Nation, and Religion, We cannot, without being wanting to our Duty, be si∣lent under the Calamities wherein the Popish Counsels, which so long prevailed, have miserably involved us: We do there∣fore unanimously resolve to apply our selves to his Highness the Prince of Orange, who with so great Kindness to these King∣doms, so Vast Expence and so much ha∣zard to his own Person, hath undertaken (by endeavouring to procure a Free Parlia∣ment) to rescue us, with as little Effusion of Christian Blood as possible, from immi∣nent Dangers of Popery and Slavery. And, we do hereby declare, That we will with our utmost Endeavours assist his High∣ness in the obtaining such a Parliament, with all speed, wherein our Laws, our Li∣berties, and our Prosperities may be secu∣red; the Church of England in particular, with a due. Liberty to Protestant Dissen∣ters; and in general; the Protestant Re∣ligion and Interest, over the whole World may be supported and encouraged; to the
Glory of God, the Happiness of the Esta∣blished Government, in these Kingdoms, and the advantage of all Princes, and State, in Christendom, that may be herein concerned. In the mean time we will endeavour to preserve, as much as in us lies, the Peace and Security of these great and populous Ci∣ties of London and Westminster, and the parts adjacent, by taking Care to dis∣arm all Papists, and secure all Jesuits, and Romish Priests, who are in or about the same; and if there be any thing more to be performed by us; for the promoting His Highness's Generous Intentions for the publick Good, we shall he ready to doe it as Occasion shall require. This was signed by the two Arch-Bishops, five Bishops, and Twenty two Noblemen; and it was there concluded, that the Earl of Pembroke, the Lord Vis∣count Weymouth, the Lord Bishop of Ely, and the Lord Culpepper, should forthwith attend his Highness the Prince of Orange, with the said Declaration; and at the same time acquaint him with what was farther done at that Meeting.
The Lords having left the Guild Hall, the Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen, and the Common Council assembled, and amongst other Matters it was agreed by Vote, that an Humble Ad∣dress should in their Names, and on the behalf of the City, be presented to His Highness the Prince of Orange, In haec verba. May it please your Highness, WE taking into Consideration Your Highness's fervent Zeal for the Protestant Religion, manifested to the World in your many and hazardous Enterprises; which it hath pleased Almighty God to bless you with miraculous success, we render our deepest thanks to the Divine Majesty for the same, and beg leave to present our humble thanks to your Highness particularly, for your appearing in Arms in this Kingdom; to carry on, and perfect your glorious De∣sign, to rescue England, Scotland, and Ireland, from Popery and Slavery; and in a Free Parliament to establish the Reli∣gion, the Laws, and Liberties of these Kingdoms upon a sure and lasting Foun∣dation.
We have hitherto lookt for some Remedy for those Oppressions and imminent Dangers we, together with our Protestant Fellow Sub∣jects, labour under, from His Majesties Concessions and Concurrences with your Highness's just and pious purposes, expressed in your Gracious Declaration; But herein finding our selves finally dis∣appointed by His Majesties with-drawing himself, we presume to make your High∣ness our Refuge, and do in the Name of the Capital City, implore your Highness's Protection; and most humbly beseech your Highness to vouchsafe to repair to this City, where your Highness will be received with universal Joy and Satisfaction. This Address being highly approved by all present, Four Aldermen, and Eight Commoners were appointed to wait upon his Highness, and present him with the said Address; and accor∣dingly it was presented, and very fa∣vourably received. And the Lieutenancy of the City of London, being the same day assembled, drew up an Address to be presented to his Highness, on the behalf of themselves, the Militia, &c. which being to the same Effect with the former, we think it need∣less to insert.
This Address was delivered by four of the Members of the Lieutenancy, and very kindly received by his Highness. By this time the Earl of Feversham, then commanding the King's Forces, having received His Majesties Letter, by which he understood he had with∣drawn himself; and wherein he re∣ceived such Orders as the King thought necessary to leave, he sent to acquaint his His Highness the Prince of Orange with what had happened in the following Letter SIR, HAving received this Morning a Letter from His Majesty, with the unfor∣tunate News of his Resolution to go out of England, and that he is actually gone, I thought my self obliged, being at the Head of his Army, having received his Ma∣jesties Orders to make no opposition against any Body, to let your Highness know (with the Advice of the Officers here) so soon as it was possible, to hinder the Misfortune of Effusion of Bloud: I have ordered already, to that purpose, all the Troups that are un∣der my Command, which shall be the last Order they shall receive from me, &c.
This Order caused the Troups to fall off and disband, as well because they knew themselves without a Head, as not knowing how to come by their Pay, if they continued in the Service; and indeed many of the Foot Soldiers were driven to great extremity; being by this Disbanding destitute of Moneys, Lodging, and other neccessaries, and had for a while nothing to subsist, but the Charity of the People: And although the Irish Battalion seemed for a time ob∣stinate to continue in Arms, yet the Commands they received from His Highness the Prince of Orange, and the necessity that they felt, constrained them to submit. This Dispersing of the Solders, made his Highness publish a Decla∣ration, requiring all Commanders in chief, by Beat of Drum, or otherwise, to call together the several Officers and Soldiers, belonging to their respective Regiments, Troups, and Companies, in such places as they should find most convenient for their Rendezvouz; and there to keep them in good Order and Discipline. And likewise directing and requiring all such Officers, and Soldiers, forthwith to repair to such places as shall
be appointed for that purpose by the respective Collonels, or Commanders in chief. Whilst these things passed in the Ar∣my, the multitude got together in di∣vers places, spoiling and demolishing the Popish Mass-Houses, and Chapels; much defacing the Dwelling Houses of several Eminent Papists, who were fled for fear of being secured; and though the Magistrates laboured to quiet the Tu∣mults and Disorders of this kind, yet they found their Authority too feeble, till the Mobile had spent their rage in London, &c. They pull'd down the Con∣vent of Monks in St. John's, which had been two Years Building at a vast Ex∣pence, and Burnt the greatest part of the Timber and Materials in Smithfield; having before siezed some of the Goods, as they were removing them, and burnt them in Holborn: They likewise defaced and demolished the Chapels in Lime-strect and Lincolns-Inn Fields, with that of the Spanish Ambassadour's at Wild-house, where violently breaking into his Excel∣lency's Lodgings, they got great store of Plunder, in Plate, Money, and ri Goods, &c. And in like manner they served the Lodgings of the Resident of
Florence, in St. James's Hay-Market; and offered divers Affronts and Abuses to other Houses, gathering in such Num∣bers from all parts, that it is almost in∣credible; insomuch, that neither the Watches, nor Trained-Bands, thought it safe to oppose the Torrent; but the next day it was pretty, well allayed and then search was made in divers places for such as were fled from Justice; and amongst others, to the no small wonder of the People, the Lord Chancellour Jeffries was taken, at a blind House in Hope and Anchor Alley in Wapping, disguised like a Sailer, and endeavou∣ring to make his escape in a Vessel that lay by the Key for Hamborough; and being brought before the Lord Mayor, who by reason of an Indisposition that then siezed him, not being capable of examining the Matter, he was con∣tented to go the Tower to preserve him∣self from the rage of the Rabble, that loudly threatened him with Destruction; and being guarded thither with a De∣tachment of the Trained-Bands was received by the Lieutenant of the Tower; to whom, upon Notice, the Lords at White-Hall sent a Warrant of Commit∣ment, to keep the Body of George Lord
Jefferies, Baron of Wem, in safe Cu∣stody, &c. On the 4th. of December, His High∣ness the Prince of Orange came to Windsor about Three in the Afternoon, and was received with most profound respect and submission by the Mayor and Aldermen in their Formalities, the Steward of that Corporation Con∣gratulating his Arrival in a most Ele∣gant Speech; and afterwards he went to the Prince of Denmark's Lodgings, prepared for his Reception: And whilst His Highness was preparing for London, News came that the King attempting to pass the Seas at Feversham in disguise, was stay'd by some of the Towns-men who were fearching for such as were endeavouring the like, who being ig∣norant that it was his Majesty, carried him in a rude manner to a house in the Town; taking from him some Jewels, considerable quantity of Gold, and his Crucifix of a great Value: Not did those rude People desist from their Incivilities, till a Gentleman coming to see the Prisoners they had taken, and knowing the King, fell on his Knees to pay him duty; whereat the multi∣tude being strangely surprized, a great
part of them retired, and others begged his Majesties Pardon, offering to restore what they had taken from him; but he would not receive his Gold again, but gave it them in Generosity, as a free Gift. The Lords at White-Hall hearing of his Majesty's being at Feversham, sent to wait upon him, and pray him to re∣turn to his Palace Royal; to which he seemed not at first inclinable; though being pressed to a Return, he at last con∣sented. But His Highness the Prince of Orange having fully determined to come to London with all speed, he thought it in many respects improper for the King and himself to be there at one and the same time in the present State of Affairs; upon notice his Ma∣jesty was returning, he sent Monsieur Zulestein to meet him on the way, and intreat him to return to Rochester; but Monsieur Zulestein missing him by ta∣king another Road than that by which he came, the King arrived at White-hall the 16th. of December in the Evening, attended by divers Noblemen, and a Guard of Horse; and from thence he sent the Lord Feversham to invite his Highness to come to St. James's, and
take that Palace as his Place of Resi∣dence, with what number of Troups he thought convenient. The Prince deliberating upon this, with the Lords at Windsor, the day be∣fore he had appointed to be in Town; and having communicated to them the Message, and left them to debate the matter; it was agreed that it was in no kind advisable, for the Prince to accept the Invitation; and there being on the other side a necessity the Prince should be in Town, the next day the Lords thought the shortness of time could ad∣mit no better Expedient, than that the King might be desired to remove to some Place within a reasonable distance from London; upon which Ham, a House belonging to the Dutchess of Lander-dale, was concluded on; and in order to this, a Paper was drawn, and Signed by the Prince, viz. WE desire you the Lord Marquess of Hallifax, the Earl of Shrewsbu∣ry, and the Lord Delamere, to tell the King that it is thought convenient, for the greater safety of his Person, that he do re∣move move to Ham, where he shall be attended by Guards, who will be ready to preserve
him from any disturbance. Given at Windsor the 17th. of December, 1688. This Paper being Signed by the Prince, the three Lords mentioned therein, were appointed to carry it; and it was resolved before the delivery, that his Highness's Guards should be possessed of all the Posts at White-Hall, to prevent the possibility of a disturbance from Guards belonging to several Masters; which, besides other ill consequence, might peradventure have involved even the King's own person in the danger that might have happened from any dispute; it was by computation supposed, that the Prince's Guards might have reached them by Eight at Night; but it so fell out, by reason of the dirtiness of the ways, &c. that it was past ten, before they were come, and in drawing the King's Guards from White-Hall, so much time was spent, that before the Lords could proceed in their Message, it was past twelve; in which, that they might, preserve all possible Decency and Respect, and not suddenly break in upon the King, with a Message of this kind; they sent to
the Lord Middleton, his principal Secre∣tary of State, the following Letter. My Lord, THere is a Message to be delivered to His Majesty from the Prince, which is of so great Importance, that we, who are charged with it, desire we may be im∣mediately admitted; and therefore desire to know where we may find your Lordship, that you may introduce, My Lord, your Lordships most Humble Servants, &c. This Letter was signed by three Lords, and the Lord Middleton sent back word by the Messenger, he would be ready at the Stairs of the Guard-Chamber, to carry the Lords to the King, where accordingly they found his Lordship, and he brought them to the King, whom they found in Bed; and after having made an Apology for coming at a time that might disturb him, the Prince's Message, before men∣tioned, was delivered to him, which af∣ter he had read, he said he would com∣ply with it; the Lords, as they were di∣rected, humbly desired, that if it might
be done with conveniency to His Maje∣sty, that he would be pleased to remove so early, as to be at Ham by Noon, to prevent by that means, his meeting the Prince, in his way to London: To this the King readily agreed, and afterwards asked if he might not appoint what Ser∣vants should attend him, to which the Lords replied, it was left to His Majesty to give Order in that as he pleased. And after the Lords had taken their leave, and were gone as far as the Privy Cham∣ber, the King sent for them again, and told them that he had forgot to ac∣quaint them with his Resolution before the Message came, to send the Lord Godolphin the next Morning to the Prince, to propose his going back to Rochester, he finding, by the Message, Monsieur Zulestein was charged with, that the Prince had no mind he should be at London; and therefore he now desired that he might rather return to Rochester: the Lords replied, that they would im∣mediately send an account to the Prince; of what His Majesty desired, and did not doubt of such an Answer as would be to his satisfaction; and accordingly they immediately dispatched back again a Messenger, who finding the Prince at
Sion, gave him an account of all that had passed, and before Eight of the Clock in the morning, had a Letter from the Sieur Benting, by the Prince's Order, agreeing to the King's Proposal of going to Rochester; and accordingly the Guards and Barges being made rea∣dy to attend him, his Coach and Sump∣ters appointed likewise to follow him, he reached Gravesend on the 18th. in the Evening, and passed over Land in his Coach, attended by several o∣thers, where His Majesty was pleased to chuse the House of Sir Richard Head, for the place of his Residence at that time. One thing there was remarkable be∣tween the King's first with-drawing himself and his return, which conside∣ring people are apt to conclude might be designed for a general Notice for the Papists to have risen in Arms, and fell upon the Protestants in their Hou∣ses, had not his Highness's Prudent Conduct broken their Measures, and rendred their Purpose insignificant, and that was a general Allarm, given in the dead of the Night, at almost one and the same time, in the most con∣siderable Cities and Towns in England,
upon pretence the Irish were killing, burning, and destroying all before them, which appeared to be carried on industriously, by persons set on purpose to spread that false Allarm, or it could not other ways have been done in so many distant places at once, which put people into a great Hurry and Consternation, till day ap∣peared, and convinced them of the Fallacy; so that whatever was intended, God prevented its taking effect. And now the satisfaction of the longing Peo∣ple drew near, for on the day the King left White-Hall, His Highness the Prince of Orange, with a very splendid Equi∣page, entered the Town, about three in the Afternoon, and came to he Pa∣lace of St. James's, where he received the Complements of all the Nobility, and other persons of the chiefest Qua∣lity in Town; and at Night the Streets were enlightened with Bonfires, the Bells every where ringing, and all places filled with a large demonstration of un∣feigned Joy, so that the Face of things were visibly changed; insomuch, that even the Rabble, that a little before ould know no Order, were now calm, nd in a thorow quiet.
Upon the Arrival of His Highness, the Common Council of the City of Lon∣don assembled, and unanimously a∣greed and ordered, That all the Alder∣men of that City, and their Deputies, with two Common Council Men for each Ward, should wait upon, and congratulate His Highness, upon his happy Arrival at such a time and place as his Highness should ap∣point; and that the two Sheriffs, and Mr. Common Serjeant should wait upon him to know his pleasure when he would be at∣tended by that Committee; and according∣ly the next day they attended His High∣ness at St. James's; and on the 20th. the Lord Mayor being indisposed, the Alder∣men and their respective Deputies, with some of the Common Council-men of each Ward, waited on the Prince to congratulate him on his happy Arrival; which was performed by Sir George Tre∣by, in a Florid Speech. The High Sheriff, Nobility, and Gen∣try of the County of Cambridge, about this time drew up and signed an Ad∣dress to his Highness; wherein they not only beg his Protection, and implore his aid to restore these Kingdoms from Po∣pery and Slavery; but also assure his Highness, that they will contribute their
utmost endeavours in perfecting so Glorious a Work, and return his High∣ness their unfeigned thanks for the Pro∣gress he has made already, with great Cost, Labour, and Hazard, both by Sea and Land, &c. which was presented to his Highness, and received with parti∣cular marks of his Favour. And now the King's Forces that were disbanded, not having any certain Stations, or places of gathering, Quarters were appointed the respective Troups and Regiments, whither the Officers and Soldiers, were commanded forth-with to repair; and seeing many had embezzled their Arms, and Order was put forth, signed by his Highness, commanding those that had them in custody, to re-deliver them to the Soldiers, the Officers of the Ordi∣nance, or common Stores of the Tower, &c. Whilst these things happened, the King, after several days continuance at Ro∣chester, withdrew himself, with a slender Train, about twelve of the Clock in the Night, on the 22d. of December; making a back way with great secrecy and cau∣tion to the Sea-Port; where he em∣barked, and was afterward known to be landed in France, and favourably re∣ceived
by the French King; having left a Paper behind him, given out to con∣tain his Reasons, for withdrawing him∣self. And Portsmouth that held out with some Obstinacy, under the Duke of Barwick, and Sir Edward Scot Deputy Governour, submitted and received a Garison sent thither by the Prince's Order. On the Twenty Fifth of December, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, assem∣bled at the House of Lords at Westminster, humbly proposed and requested of his Highness, To take upon him the Admini∣stration of publick Affairs, both Civil and Military, and the Disposal of the Publick Revenue, for the Preservation of the Prote∣stant Religion, Rights, Laws, Liberties and Properties, and of the Peace of the Na∣tion; and that he would take into his par∣ticular Care the present Condition of Ire∣land, and endeavour by the most speedy and effectual means to prevent the danger threatening that Kingdom; all which they requested his Highness to undertake, and exercise, till the meeting of the intended Convention, 22d. of January, &c. At the same time this great and ho∣nourable Assembly made their request
to his Highness, desiring him that he would cause his Letters to be Written, subscribed by himself, to be sent to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal being Protestants, and for Election to the se∣veral Counties, Universities, Cities, Bo∣roughs, and Cinque Ports of England, Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, for Electing Persons fitly quali∣fied; so that being duly chosen for Knights of the Shire, and Burgesses, they might meet, and sit at Westminster, the Twenty Second of January ensu∣ing. And these were signed by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal then assem∣bled. On the 26th divers of the Members of Parliament in the Reign of the late King Charles II. and the Aldermen and Common Council of the City of London, pursuant to his Highness the Prince of Orange's Desire, met at St. James's to whom his Highness made a gracious Speech, in the following words. YOƲ Gentlemen that have been Mem∣bers of the late Parliaments, I have desired you to meet me here to advise the best manner how to pursue the Ends of my Declaration, in calling a free Parliament,
for the preservation of the Protestant Reli∣gion, the restoring of the Rights and Liber∣ties of the Kingdom, and settling the same, that they may not be in danger of being a∣gain subverted. And you the Aldermen, and Members, the Common Council of the City of London, I desire the same of you; and in regard your numbers are like to be great, you may, if you think fit, divided your selves, and sit in several places. Upon which, they immediately agreed to go to the Commons House at West∣minster, where being sate, they chose Henry Powle Esq their Chair-man, and upon Debate they resolved upon Heads for an Address to be made to his High∣ness, and appointed Persons to draw up and prepare the same; and in the After∣noon it was done accordingly, read, and approv'd; and his Highness having ap∣pointed to receive it the next day, he was attended by them, and the Address read by Mr. Powle, much to the same ef∣fect, as what had been before proposed by the Lord, viz. Returning his Highness their hearty and unfeigned Thanks, and expressing their ex∣traordinary acknowledgement of the care he
had taken of the Religion, Laws, and Liber∣ty of the Kingdom, &c. intreating him to take upon him the Administration of Go∣vernment, and use to that end the publick Revenues; to take speedy Care of the Stats of Ireland, and issue out his Circular Let∣ters for the calling a Convention to sit at Westminster, on the 22d. of January, &c. Whereupon his Highness was pleased to declare to this effect, That (being a mat∣ter of weight) he would consider of it, and give them an answer the next day. On the 28th. of December in the Mor∣ning the Lords attended his Highness at St. James's, who gave them this answer: My Lords, I Have considered of your Advice, and as far as I am able I will endeavour to se∣cure the Peace of the Nation untill the mee∣ting of the Convention in January next; for the Election whereof I will forthwith issue out Letters, according to your Desire; I will also take care to apply the publick Re∣venues to the most proper uses that the pre∣sent Affairs do require; and likewise en∣deavour to put Ireland into such a Conditi∣on that the Protestant Religion, and the English Interest may be maintained in that
Kingdom: And I farther assure you; that as I came hither for the preservation of the Protestant Religion, and the Laws and Li∣berties of these Kingdoms, so I shall always be ready to expose my self in any hazard for the defence of the same. The Lords having made their Thank∣full acknowledgment for this Speech so suitable to their Desires, the Gentlemen who had served as Members of Parlia∣ment during the Reign of King Charles II. together with the Aldermen and Common-Council of the City of London, waited upon him in the Afternoon, to whom his Highness was pleased to give the same answer. Nor was there only a Pleasure con∣ceived in England, for His Highness's Success, and prosperous Proceedings; but on the first of January, (New-Style) all the Persons of Quality that were at the Hague appeared at Court, to com∣plement her Royal Highness the Princess of Orange, and in the Evening their E∣lectoral Highnesses of Brandenburgh ar∣rived there, and were conducted to the old Palace, which was prepared for them, whither her Royal Highness went to visit the Electoress, and splendid En∣tertainments
were made upon the occa∣sion. On the 30th. of December His High∣ness was pleased to issue out his Declara∣tion for authorizing Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and other Officers and Ministers, to Act in their respective Pla∣ces, that were in Office the first of De∣cember, Papists excepted, with a Charge to be carefull and diligent in their Pla∣ces and Trusts, for preserving the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom, and relie∣ving the Poor, &c. And now the Country People and o∣thers scouting abroad, had gleaned a great number of Persons, whose de∣sire of Safety had caused their with∣drawing, amongst whom was the Earls of Salisbury and Peterborough, Lord Chan∣cellour, Sir Edward Hales, Sir Thomas Jenner, Charles Hales, Dr. Obadiah Wal∣ker, Richard Graham, Philip Burton, and many others, as also nine Jesuites, viz. John Leybourn, Charles Poulton, Ralph Clayton, Joseph Gifford, Robert Jenison, William Locker, Francis Calamy, and Tho∣mas Kingsley, with many more, who are in safe Custody; and his Highness having issued out his Circular Letters for chusing Members to be present at the Conven∣tion
the Elections were carried on in most Places, as it were, with one con∣sent, without any appearance of those Strivings and Heats that have too often attended former Elections; and that there might no disturbance or hinderance happen upon the occasion of the Soldiers quartering in Cities and Boroughs, they were ordered to draw off, except Gari∣sons, to other Quarters, till the Electi∣ons were over; which was punctually observed, with an exact and ready Obe∣dience; and soon after his Highness put forth a Declaration for the better quar∣tering of the Forces. This Declaration, though the people seemed no where unwilling to quarter the Soldiers, according to their ability, highly satisfied them in the Prince's Ju∣stice, and good Intentions; so that the Association for the preservation of his Person has been promoted, in the Sign∣ing, through all the Countries of Eng∣land, with much freeness and alacrity; a Copy of which, as it was drawn up, and signed at St. James's, by the Lords and Gentlemen, take in the following Words.
WE whose Names are hereunto sub∣scribed, who have jointed with the Prince of Orange, for the defence of the Protestant Religion, and for maintaining the antient Government, and the Laws and Liberties of England, Scotland, and Ire∣land, do engage to Almighty God, to his Highness the Prince of Orange, and to one another, to stick firm to this Cause, and to one another in defence of it, and never to depart from it till our Religion, our Laws and Liberties are so far secured to us in a Free Parliament, that we shall be no more in danger of falling under Popery and Sla∣very: And whereas we are engaged in this common Cause under the Protection of the Prince of Orange, by which means his per∣son may be exposed to dangers, and to the desperate and cursed Attempts of the Papists and other bloudy Men; we do therefore so∣lemnly engage both to God, and to one ano∣ther, That if any such Attempts are made upon him, we will pursue not only those that make them, but all their Adherents, and all that we find in Arms against us, with the ut∣most severities of a just Revenge, to their Ruine and final Destruction: And that the Execution of any such Attempts (which God of his Mercy forbid) shall not divert us from prosecuting this Cause which we do now undertake, but that it shall engage us to sar∣ry
it on with all the vigour that so barbarous a Practice shall deserve. His Highness having, as is before men∣tioned, been pleased to take upon him the Administration of the Civil and Mi∣litary Power, and by reason of the sud∣den change and alteration of Affairs the the publick Revenues had been put out of Order, as to the method of Collecting, and placing and dis-placing the Colle∣ctors, he issued out a Declaration, com∣manding all Collectors, Receivers, and Officers, not being Papists, authorized and employed by the proper Commissi∣oners of the Customs, Excise, Hearth-money, or any other Branch of the Re∣venue, to proceed in the Managing, Receiving and Levying the said Re∣venue, as formerly; and that all Magi∣strates and Officers should be assisting to them in their respective Stations, the better to enable them to make their due Collections and Receipts. And more∣over, his Highness taking into his cha∣ritable Consideration the necessitous Condition of the poor people, as well Handicrafts as others, destitute of em∣ployment, out of a sense of their wants, caused a considerable Summe of Mo∣ney to be distributed amongst those of
the Out-Parishes of the Cities of London and Westminster. But now the Papists, notwithstanding a former Declaration, commanding them, not being House∣keepers,, Merchants, or Servants to the Queen Dowager, &c. to depart the Cities of London and Westminster, conti∣nuing in contempt of that Declaration, and appearing in great numbers, his Highness was pleased by another Decla∣ration, dated the 14th. of January, to command them within three days to de∣part the said Cities, and ten miles com∣pass, or otherwise to be taken, procee∣ded against, and expect the utmost seve∣rity that the Law for their Offences can inflict upon them; commanding all Magistrates to make diligent search, and apprehend and imprison such as should be found in Contempt of the said Decla∣rations, &c. The Fame of his Highness's Success being sufficiently known in the United Provinces, three Deputies were sent to congratulate his Success, who landing at the Tower were received with the Discharge of the Cannon, and other sig∣nal Respects, as became their Chara∣cter; from whence they passed to the Lodgings appointed for them, in the
Coaches sent to wait upon them, with a splendid Equipage. His Highness had no sooner signified to the City of London that the publick Treasure was in a manner exhausted, and not sufficient to defray the necessary Expences of the Nation, but a Commit∣tee was ordered to attend him to know the Summe that might supply that de∣fect, and 100000 l. being named and proffered to be secured, and re-paid, with Interest, in six Months, a great many e∣minent and generous Citizens immedi∣ately came to the Guild-Hall of London, and offered their Subscriptions, which were there accordingly taken, almost to admiration; for in a short time, about 300000 l. was subscribed, and directions being given for the Receivers to attend, it was brought in with such Expedition, that they were forced to encrease their number. These being the most weighty Affairs transacted in England, let us a while look into those of Scotland, our Sister Kingdom, where we find that upon his Highness's Arrival in these Parts, the terrour wrought so effectually with the Popish Ministers of State, and others, that found themselves launched beyond
the Laws of that Kingdom, and Consti∣tution of Government, that they thought of nothing more than shifting for them∣selves, some of which had the luck to escape, and others were seized; the mul∣titude was up in divers places, demoli∣shing the Mass-Houses, and not only contented with that, but committed sun∣dry Disorders, and in the Encounters and Scuffles that were thereby occasio∣ned, even in the City of Edinburgh, se∣veral were killed and wounded, which made the Noble-men and Gentlemen at∣tend him, to lay before his Highness the willingness of the people of Scotland, to submit to his Protection, &c. and upon notice of their Intentions, his Highness the Prince of Orange, having cau∣sed to advertise such of the Scotch Lords and Gentlemen, as were in Town, to at∣tend in a Room at St. James's, on the 7th. of January, about three in the Af∣ternoon, his Highness met them. there, and made to them the following Speech. My Lords and Gentlemen, THE only Reason that enduced me to undergo so great an Ʋndertaking was, that I saw the Laws and Liberties of these Kingdoms overturned, and the Protestant
Religion in imminent Danger, and seeing you are so many Noble-men and Gentlemen, I have called you together, that I may have your Advice what is to be done for the secu∣ring the Protestant Religion, and restoring your Laws and Liberties, according to my Declaration. As soon as his Highness had retired, the Lords and Gentlemen went to the Council-Chamber at White-Hall, and there having chosen the Duke of Hamil∣ton their President, debated what Advice was sit to be given his Highness in that juncture, but came to no Conclusion, farther than to give the Clerks that at∣tended Instructions to draw up in Writing what they then thought most ex∣pedient. On Tuesday the 8th. of January the Honourable Assembly met again, and the Writing was presented; upon which they debated the most expedient way for Convening the general meeting of the Estates of Scotland, and at last agreed in their Opinion, ordering the Writing to be fair drawn over with the Amend∣ments. On Wednesday, the 9th. of January, they met at Three of the Clock, and the
Address was prepared, giving his High∣ness Thanks for his Pious and Generous Undertaking, for preserving the Prote∣stant Religion, and restoring the Laws and Liberties of these Kingdoms; desi∣ring him to take upon him the Admini∣stration of the Affairs, Civil and Milita∣tary, and dispose of the publick Reve∣nues, and Fortresses of the Kingdom of Scotland, untill the general Meeting of the States of the Nation, which they humbly prayed his Highness to call, to be holden at Edinburgh, the 14th. of March next, and to issue out his Letters for the calling them, being Protestants. These being the Heads and Substance of this Address, it was subscribed by 30 Lords, and about 80 Gentlemen, and was presented to his Highness in their presence, by the Duke of Hamilton at St. James's, who thanked them for the Trust they reposed in him, and desired a time to consider upon so wheighty an Affair: When the next day his Highness again met the Scotch Lords and Gentle∣men at St. James's, and made them the following Speech.
My Lords and Gentlemen, IN pursuance of your Advice, I will, un∣till the Meeting of the Estates in March next, give such Orders concerning the Af∣fairs of Scotland, as are necessary for the Calling the said Meeting, for the preser∣vation of the Peace, the applying of the publick Revenue to the most pressing uses, and putting the Fortresses into the Hands of Persons in whom the Nation can have a just Confidence; and I do farther assure you, that you will always find me ready to concurr with you in every thing, that may be found necessa∣ry for the securing the Protestant Religion, and restoring the Laws and Liberties of the Nation. By this time the Earl of Crauford, the Earl of Louthian, and others, being come to Town, the former of these Earls desi∣red his Highness that they might sub∣scribe the Address, which was accor∣dingly granted, his Highness leaving signal marks of a high satisfaction in the Countenances of the noble Assem∣bly, which demonstrated how much they were pleased with his Answer; nor no sooner did the News arrive at Edin∣burgh,
but it was received with the ringing of Bells, loud Shouts, and Ac∣clamations of Joy, and in the same man∣ner swiftly overspread that Kingdom. The English Soldiers many of them having been imposed upon by ill affected Persons to doubt their Pay, &c. his Highness was pleased to put forth a pub∣lick Assurance, that he had taken care for the satisfying and making good to every Officer, and Soldier, their full Pay and Arrears, due to them untill the first day of January, 1688. and for the making constant and punctual payment of Subsistence Money, and clearing of the Army in the usual method, without any the least diminution of their former Pay, ordering all Officers to repair to their respective Commands, and Soldiers to their Quarters and Rendezvouz, un∣der such penalties as a refusal may incur; and that nothing might be wanting on his part, His Highness in another Paper gave the like notice and assurance to the Sea-men belonging to the English Fleet, under the Command of the Lord Dart∣mouth. And now the Royal African Company intreated his Highness to doe them the Honour of taking upon him to be their Governour for the ensuing year,
and made him a Present of 1000 l. in their Stock, worth 2000 l. which he ve∣ry favourably accepted. Now the great Convention, on which the Eyes of all Europe are fixed, draw∣ing near, the Members who were cho∣sen and returned came to Town, the Houses were prepared for the Reception of the august Assembly, and on the 21th. of January the High-Sheriff, with all the considerable Gentlemen of Estate in the County of Cambridge, having unani∣mously entered into an Association, whereby they solemnly engage them∣selves to stand by His Highness the Prince of Orange, with their Lives and Fortunes, in his glorious Design of Re∣deeming these Kingdoms from Popery and Slavery, Mr. Cotton of Madingly was to wait upon His Highness, and presen∣ted it in the Name of the County, to which His Highness was pleased to re∣turn a very gracious Answer. On the 22th. of January, according to the grand Appointment, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, assembled at Westminster, the Lord Mar∣quess of Halifax officiated the Place of Speaker, in the House of Lords, and the Commons chose Henry Powle Esq to
be their Speaker, who accordingly took his place: After which a Letter from his Hghness the Prince of Orange was read in both Houses on the Occasion of their Meeting, viz. My Lords, I Have endeavoured to the utmost of my power to perform what was desired from me, in order to the publick Peace, and safe∣ty, and I do not know that any thing hath been omitted which might tend to the preser∣vation of them, since the Administration of Affairs was put into my hands; it now lieth upon you to lay the Foundation of a firm se∣curity for your Religion, your Laws, and Liberties. I do not doubt but that by such a full and free Representative of the Nation as is now met, the Ends of my Declaration will be at∣tained; and since it hath pleased God hither∣to to bless my good Intentions with so great success, I trust in him that he will complete his own Work, by sending a Spirit of Peace and Ʋnion to influence your Counsels, that no interruption may be given to a happy and lasting settlement.
The dangerous condition of the Protestant Interest in Ireland, requiring a large and speedy succour, and the present state of things abroad, oblige me to tell you, That next to the danger of unseasonable Division amongst your selves, nothing can be so fatal as too great delay in your Consultations; the States, by whom I have been enabled to rescue this Nation, may suddenly feel the in Effects of it, both by being too long deprived of the Ser∣vice of their Troups, which are now here, and of your early assistence against a power∣full Enemy, who hath declar'd War against them; and as England is by Treaty alrea∣dy engaged to help them, upon any such Exi∣gencies, so I am confident that their chear∣full Concurrence to preserve this Kingdom with so much hazard to themselves, will meet with all the Returns of Friendship and Assistence which may be expected from you, as Protestants and English men, when ever their Condition shall require it. This Letter being read, and unani∣mously approved and applauded, with the highest satisfaction, the Lords and Commons resolved upon an Address, to be presented to his Highness, of Thanks for what he had done, and humbly to desire him to continue the Administration
of publick Affairs, till farther applicati∣on should be made by them to his High∣ness, Which Address being presented to his Highness on Wednesday the 22th. of January, he was pleased to return them this Answer, viz. Die Mercurii 23. Januarii, 1688/9. My Lords and Gentlemen, I Am glad that what I have done hath pleased you, and since you desire me to continue the Administration of Affairs, I am willing to accept it; I must recommend to you the consideration of Affairs abroad, which maketh it fit for you to expedite your Business, not only for making a Settlement at home upon a good Foundation, but for the safety of all Europe. After this an Order was passed on the same day, That no Papist, or reputed Pa∣pist, should presume to come into the Lobby, Painted Chamber, Court of Requests, or Westminster-Hall, during the sitting of the Convention. Then the Speaker of the honourable House of Commons put the House in
mind of the present Affairs of the King∣dom, recommending the speedy care of providing for its safety to the respe∣ctive Representatives, declaring The danger it was lately in, and putting them in mind of the desperate State of Ireland; He farther minded them of the growth of France, and concluded in recommending these things to their prudent Care and Con∣duct, &c. After these and other weighty consi∣derations, an Order was made by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Com∣mons, for a publick Thanksgiving, for our great and miraculous deliverance from the imminent Danger that so lately hung over our Heads. Thursday the 31st. of January instant, being appointed for the City of London, and Ten Miles distance, and Thursday the 14th. day of February following for the rest of the Kingdom. Thus all things concurring towards a happy Settlement, and Uniting of Protestants, &c. in England and Scotland, let us look a little into the Affairs of Ire∣land, which as yet has not the like pros∣pect, as being very much inhabited by Native Irish Papists, devoted Enemies to the Protestant Religion. The Earl of
Tyrconnel, whom the King had made his Lieutenant, or Deputy of that King∣dom, taking the advantage of the hurry and disorder the Affairs of England had put the People into, magnified their Fears, and used his endeavours to gain them to a Revolt, but finding the Pro∣testants in no wise forward to joyn or take part with him, he instantly sent his Let∣ters through all the Provinces and Countries, to cause the Gentry and Pea∣sants to take up Arms on the behalf of the King, and the defence of their Reli∣gion, declaring, if the King himself should in that juncture desire it, he would not deliver up his Sword; so that lea∣ving no endeavours to strengthen him∣self untried, he in a short time drew to∣gether a formidable Army, and secured divers Places of strength, fortifying the Houses and Castles of several Noble∣men; whereupon, it was thought fit to send to him, and know his Intentions; but no farther satisfaction, at that time, could be gained, than that he was resol∣ved to stand for the King's Interest, and expect his Commands, &c. and accor∣dingly upon notice that he, upon his a se∣cond time withdrawing himself, was in France, the Report went currant, that
he sent thither to know his Pleasure; in the mean while, though he offered no o∣pen Hostilities to the Protestants, yet in many Places he oppressed them by Quar∣tering his Soldiers at discretion in their Houses, seizing their Arms, and taking Hostages. His Highness the Prince of Orange having taken upon him, at the request of the Lords and Commons, the farther Administration of Government in Civil and Military Affairs, proceeded to the most effectual meanes for the better set∣ling the Army, and taking care for their Payment; and the better to assure them, and encourage men of worth and true Valour, the sale of Offices, or Military Employments are laid aside. And now the Wisdom of the Nation having thought it, as we head, necessary to have the presence of her Royal High∣ness the Princess of Orange in England, upon this great juncture of Affairs, there∣upon a Convoy of Men of War, as well English as Dutch, was ordered to wait upon her till her Equipage could be got in a readiness and the Wind served to bring over her Highness, &c. During the Joy of the People, in ex∣pectation or the Arrival of her Royal
Highness, and the preparations for her Reception, we had News from France that the King and Queen of England were frequently visited by the French Nobility, and entertained with the ac∣customed Grandeur; and that the French King gave out that he would have ex∣traordinary Forces in the Field, early in the Spring, to oppose the gathering Armies of the Confederate Princes, and States of Holland, promising to himself those advantages which only Time can make out, or determine: In opposition to which, and to disable him in the lessen∣ing his Revenues, an Address was agreed on by the honourable Convention, As∣sembled at Westminster, upon the great emergency of Affairs, to desire and in∣treat his Highness the Prince of Orange to issue out his Proclamation for the prohibiting the Importation of French Commodities, and the going out of any Ships hence for France, farther recom∣mending the State of Ireland, as its pre∣sent Condition requires, to his Care. On Wednesday the 30th. of January, being the anniversary Solemnity for the Mur∣ther of King Charles I. Dr. Sharp, Dean of Norwich, Preached before the House at St. Margarets Westminster; and
on Thursday the 31th. of January, the day appointed for Thanksgiving, in the City of London, and Ten miles round it, for the success of his Highness the Prince of Orange, in the miraculous De∣liverance he brought this Kingdom, &c. Dr. Gilbert Burnet, now Bishop of Sa∣lisbury, according to the desire of the House, Preached before them in the same Church, there being a numerous Assembly, who at the close of that Ser∣mon expressed an extraordinary satisfa∣ction, the whole course of it being ma∣naged with much Learning and Pru∣dence, in every respect suitable to the oc∣casion of the day, and the Prayers ap∣pointed were read in the other Churches, with the same acceptation. And because the sixth of February was at hand, to prevent the Thanksgiving formerly appointed to be held on that day, an Order of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, bearing date the second of the same Month, was made publick in these words: Ordered by the Lords Spiritual and Tem∣poral, assembled at Westminster, that the Day of Thanksgiving on the 6th. of Fe∣bruary Instant, on which Day the late
King James II. came to the Throne, shall not be observed in this Kingdom. Things being in this forwardness, a great many Citizens of London and West∣minster appeared in the Court of Re∣quests with two Petitions, one to the Lords, and another to the Commons, both to this Effect, viz. That they most humbly desired that his most Illustrious Highness the Prince of Orange might be speedily setled in the Throne, by whose Cou∣rage, Conduct, and Reputation, the Nation and the Protestant Religion might be de∣fended from Enemies abroad and at home. That Ireland might be rescued from its de∣plorable Condition, and finally the King∣doms setled on a lasting foundation in Peace and Liberty. These being received, and many weighty Considerations urging it, her Royal Highness's Coming over was ha∣stened, and being on her Departure for England, the States General, the States of Holland, the Council of State, the Courts of Justice, and all other Colle∣ges, either in Body, or by their Depu∣ties, made their Complements to her on the Occasion; and the like was done by foreign Ministers, and all other Per∣sons
of Quality; and at her Leaving the Hague, the Magistrates entreated that the Burghers might attend her in Arms; but She excused it; however the States of Holland appointed three of their Bo∣dy to wait upon her Royal Highness to the place of her Embarquing; sending Orders to the Sieur d' Allemonde, and the Ships under his Command, to joyn Admiral Herbert, who from England at∣tended her with a Squadron of Men of war, and sundry Yatches, for the bet∣ter conveniency of Transportation; and having a prosperous Gale, on the 12th. of February, in the afternoon She safely arrived at White-Hall, having been sa∣luted by the Guns of the Forts, Ships in the road and those of the Tower, where the Royal Banner was displayed, and by that Example the Ships likewise had put out their Flags and Streamers. Great was the Joy upon the safe Landing of her Royal Highness, as ap∣peared by the repeated Acclamations of the People, and other publick Demon∣strations; and that Night She received the Complements of the chief Persons of Quality. And now the Two Houses thought it no longer necessary to delay Proclaiming the Prince and Princess King and Queen of England, so that ha∣ving
at large declared the Reasons for the Abdication of James II. laying down therein the Illegalities in former Proceedings and Miscarriages in Go∣vernment, &c. they came to a Re∣solve, That William and Mary, Prince and Princess of Orange, should be De∣clared King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland, with all the Domi∣nions thereunto belonging, to hold the Crown, and Royal Dignity of the said Kingdoms & Dominions to them, during their Lives and the Life of the Survivor of them; and that the sole and full Ex∣ercise of the Regal Power be only in, and executed by the Prince in the Name of Himself and the Princess, during their joynt Lives; and after their De∣ceases, the Crown and Royal Dignities of the Kingdoms and Dominions, to be to the Heirs of the Body of the Prin∣cess; and for default of such Issue, to the Princess Ann of Denmark, and the Heirs of her Body; and for default of such Issue, to the Heirs of the Body of the Prince of Orange. And praying the Prince and Princess to accept this, accordingly the follow∣ing Oaths were appointed to be taken by such Persons of whom the Oaths of
Allegiance and Supremacy might be re∣quired by Law; and farther, that the former Oaths of Allegiance and Supre∣macy be Abrogated: After which the Oaths were Enacted, viz. I A. B. do sincerely Promise and Swear, That I will be faithfull, and bear true Allegiance to their Majesties, King Willi∣am and Queen Mary. So help me God. I A. B. do Swear, That I do from my Heart Abhor, Detest, and Abjure, as Impious and Heretical, this damnable Do∣ctrine, and Position, that Princes, Excom∣municated or deprived by the Pope, or any Authority of the See of Rome, may be De∣posed or Murthered by their Subjects, or any other whatsoever. And I do declare, That no Foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate, hath or ought to have any Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Pre∣eminence, or Authority, Ecclesiastical, or Spiritual, within this Realm. So help me God. These and others, too many to be here inserted, being the Proceedings in order to the Proclaiming, on the 13th. of
February, the Two Houses went to ac∣quaint the Prince and Princess of O∣range, in the Banqueting-House, with what they had done; and having recei∣ved Their Consent thereto, the Lords and Commons, about Eleven of the Clock, went down to White-Hall Gate, where the Officers at Arms, Serjeants at Arms, Trumpets, and other Persons, concerned in the Solemnity, being as∣sembled, by order of the Duke of Nor∣folk, Earl Marshal of England, St. Tho∣mas St. George, Knight, Garter Princi∣pal King at Arms, having received a Proclamation, and the Officers at Arms being Ordered by the House of Lords forthwith to Proclaim it, York Herauld, after the Trumpets had thrice Sounded, Proclaimed it at White-Hall Gate, Gar∣ter Reading it to him by Periods in the Presence of the Lords and Commons, and a great Concourse of People, &c. and at the end of the Proclamation the Palace, and all the adjacent Places, resounded with the Eccho of a general Joy, and loud Satisfaction; and from thence in Excellent Order they proceeded to Tem∣ple-Bar where (as the Ceremony is in this Case, according to Custome) find∣ing the Gates shut, two of the Officers
at Arms, attended by a Serjeant at Arms, and two Trumpets, knocked, and there∣upon the Sheriffs of London and Middle∣sex being informed of the Occasion of their Coming, Ordered them to be o∣pened, and the whole Proceeding ente∣red (except the Bailiff of Westminster, and his Men, who returned, as being obliged not to pass the Bounds of their Liberty,) and here the Lord Mayor, Recorder, and Aldermen, received them in their Formalities, and a second Pro∣clamation was made between the two Temple-Gates, in the same manner and order; and the Lord Mayor, Sheriffs, Aldermen, &c. falling into the Proce∣ding, they passed to Wood-street-end in Cheapside and there made a third Pro∣clamation, and a fourth before the Royal Exchange in Cornhill, every time conclu∣ding with Shouts and Acclamations of the People, who filled the Streets, Bal∣conies, and Windows, in great multi∣tudes, and to prevent any Disorder, such an Excess of Joy might occasion, four Regiments of the City Militia were in Arms to line the Way, for the better conveniency of Passage. The Pomp of the Solemnity being o∣ver, and night coming on, the Bells and
Bonfires made a second Proclamation of the Peoples Satisfaction, and the news, by the Thundering of the Can∣non, was in a short time carried, by ta∣king the fire of the Guns from one Ship to another, beyond the Island it self; nor were their curious Fire-works and Devices wanting on this Occasion; and the Solemnity was more especially con∣cluded with Magnificent Entertainments at Court; and soon after their Maje∣sties, with the like Demonstration of Joy, were Proclaimed in all the Cities and Principal Burghs, Towns of Eng∣land, and Dominion of Wales. On the 15th. of February His Majesty returned both Houses a very Gracious Answer to their Declaration, wherein he expressed Himself highly satisfied with what they had done, and was plea∣sed to promised them the utmost of his Care and Protection, for the preserva∣tion of their Religion, Laws, and Li∣berties: and that He would be willing to concurr with them in any thing that should be for the Good of the Kingdom, and to doe all that in him lay to ad∣vance the Glory and Welfare of the Na∣tion. About this time a Complaint was
made, that divers disorderly Persons, notwithstanding a former Declaration, strictly enjoyning the contrary, conti∣nued to destroy the Deer, Timber, and Underwoods, in divers Chases and For∣rests. Farther Notice was published, Commanding all Mayors, Sheriffs, Justi∣ces of the Peace, and others, whom it might concern, to seize, or cause Per∣sons found offending therein to be sei∣zed and proceeded against, according to Law, without expectation of Pardon, if found guilty. And farther considering that divers had attempted to escape to Tyrconnel in Ireland, to aid him in op∣pressing the Protestants of that King∣dom, Orders were taken for stopping the Ports of Chester, Beaumaris, and Holy-head, and other Ports, and Creeks, on the Irish Sea, and not to susser any Per∣son or Persons whatsoever to go for Ireland, unless those by whom a Pass was produced from his Majesty, or one of his Principal Secretaries of State. The Recorder, Sheriffs, and Common Serjeant of London having been to wait on their Majesties, by Order of the Lord Mayor and Common Council, to beg leave from them to attend their Majesties to Congratulate their happy
Accession to the Throne, the Lord May∣or, Aldermen, and Commons, went in a Body, and had the favour of Waiting upon their Majesties in the Banqueting-House, and were Graciously received, being admitted to Kiss their Majesties Hands. And now we received continu∣al Relations of the Joy that was concei∣ved throughout the whole Shires of England, &c. Upon the several Proclai∣mings of King William and Queen Mary, Expressed by Ringing of Bells, making of Bonfires, and drinking their Healths. On the 18th. of February in the mor∣ning the King went from White-Hall, in his Barge of State to the Parliament-Stairs, where he was received by seve∣ral of the great Officers, and others, the Yeomen of the Guards, and Gentlemen Pentioners, making a Lane from the Water-side to the Door going up into the Prince's Lodgings; the Proceedings being in this manner: First went the Officers at Arms, then the Noble-men, bearing white Staves, and after them Serjeants at Arms, the Garter King at Arms between two Gentlemen-Ushers, immediately before the Sword of State, which was born by the Duke of Somerset, having on the Left hand the Duke of
Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England, with his Marshal's Staff, next went the Mar∣quess of Winchester, bearing the Cup of State, then the King, followed by an Officer of the Guards, and other Persons of Quality, the Gentlemen Pentioners closing the Rear; and his Majesty being come into the Prince's Lodging, was in∣vested with his Sur-coat and Mantle of Crimson Velvet, bordered with Gold-Lace, and furred with Ermins, as also with the Collar of the Order of the Gar∣ter; and as soon as the Crown was pla∣ced upon His Head, the Officers at Arms, and the Serjeants at Arms ente∣red the House of Lords, and the Noble∣men, who preceded his Majesty, having placed themselves on each side of the Throne, and his Majesty, whose Train was born up by Noble-mens Eldest Sons, being-seated on the Throne, the Gen∣tleman Usher of the Black Rod was commanded to summon up the Com∣mons, who being accordingly introdu∣ced into the House of Peers, and their Speaker conducted to the Bar, with the usual Formalities, and the Lords being in their Robes, His Majesty made a most Gracious speech, in which he was plea∣sed to let them know how sensible he
was of their Kindness, and how much he valued the confidence they had re∣posed in him; Assuring them that he would never do any thing that might lessen their good Opinion of him, put∣ting them in mind of the Allies abroad, and the hazard they may run, especially Holland, unless some speedy Care were ta∣ken: That a good Settlement was ne∣cessary at Home; particularly recom∣mending to them the dangerous State of Ireland, and the Methods to their spe∣dy consideration. On the 2d. of February the Lord Bi∣shop on London, with the Clergy of the City, to the number of an 100 waited on their Majesties with an humble Ten∣der of their Fidelity and Duty, and being Graciously received, were admitted to kiss their Majesties Hands, the King at the same time being pleased to give them a full Assurance of of his great Affection to the Church of England, and of all the Protection and Encouragement to them, for which he gave them his Royal Word; concluding with Assuring them, that they should ever find it so, and they might depend upon it, the Houses resolved into a free Parliament. His Majesty went on the 23d. of February by Water to the House
of Lords, attended with the usual Solem∣nity, and being in his Royal Robes, with the Crown on his Head, seated on the Throne, and the Commons being sent for, His Majesty gave the Royal Assent to an Act, for removing and pre∣venting all Questions and Disputes about the Assembling and Sitting of the present Par∣liament. And having disrobed himself, he was attended to the Water-side with the like Ceremony as before, and in the afternoon their Majesties went to Hamp∣ton-Court. On the 28th. of February two Pro∣clamations were issued forth by the King and Queen, the one at the Request of the Honourable House of Commons to apprehend Robert Brent, Gentleman, late of the Inner-Temple, charged with High Treason, who procuring himself to be Bailed had left them, and fled from Justice, with the Reward of 200 l. to any person that should discover or appre∣hend him, and those that should conceal, or further his Escape, to be proceeded against with the utmost severity accord∣ing to Law. The other for the bringing in and re∣storing of Arms that had been Embezled, or Lost, during the Disorders and Dis∣bandings
amongst the Soldiers, that had been in pay under the late King James; and upon advice that the Earl of Tyrconnel laboured to draw the Irish more and more to his Party, and con∣firm those that were already in Arms with him, by laying before them the Danger already incurr'd, their Maje∣sties, to leave them that should obstinate∣ly persist, without excuse, issued forth a Proclamation, offering amongst other things Pardon and Indemnity for all things, by those of the Earl's Party, if they laid down their Arms, and retired themselves to their respective Habitati∣ons, and Places of Abode, and there pea∣ceably behaved themselves as good Sub∣jects ought to doe; as likewise that they should upon this (ondition enjoy in full freedom their Estates according to Law, and those of the Roman Church, upon such Consideration to have all the Favour, for the private Exercise of their Religion that the Law allows, with a promise speedily to call a Parliament in that Kingdom; but on the Contrary declaring them Rebels, and Tray∣tors. &c. and their Lands and Possessi∣ons forfeited, and to be disposed and di∣stributed to those that should be Aiding,
and Assisting in reducing the Kingdom to its due Obedience. This Proclamation 'tis thought, whe∣ther hindred by Tyrconnel's violence from coming to the knowledge of the Vulgar, or creating a fear in his follow∣ers, made him fly to his Last refuge of more strictly disarming the Protestants, as well those in Cities that fell into his hands, as Gentlemen who were retired to their Houses, where his Soldiers committed sundry Outrages of an high Nature, Robbing and Pillaging with∣out remorse or pity, though under a co∣lour excused himself, by giving dire∣ctions to the Magistrates to see that no wrong should be done; however when Complaints were made, he urged necessity compell'd his Men to doe what they did; yet the Protestants, especially in the North, stood to their Arms, and repelled force by force, getting some supplies of Ammunition out of Scotland, keeping the Town of Sligo, and other places of strength, with a Longing ex∣pectation of the Arrival of the Forces and necessary Provisions from England, to be thereby enable to carry on the War, and recover what has been taken from them by the Irish Papists.
And now the duty of Hearth mony being looked upon by the Commons, as a grievance to the Subjects, and repre∣sented as such to his Majesty, the King was pleased to send a message that he left it to their considerations, either to regulate it, or to take it away, which was received with great satisfaction, and forthwith the thanks of the House were ordered to be returned his Majesty for his gracious Message; and on the 1st. of March in the Afternoon, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses in Par∣liament assembled, Waited upon his Majesty in the Banqueting-house and and there presented an Address of thanks, wherein they expressed the Joy and Sa∣tisfaction they conceived at so unpresi∣dented an offer, humbly craving leave to present their Assurance, that they-would make such gratefull and affectio∣nate returns, as were suitable to his Majesties most Gracious Intentions, and be so carefull of the Support of the Crown that the World should see, to the discouraging his Enemies, that his Majesty reigns in the Hearts of his Peo∣ple, &c. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons Assembled in Parliament,
made likewise and Address to his Maje∣sty, expressing therein how highly they were sensible of their great and Signal deliverance, &c. And that being fully convinced of the restless Spirits, and continued Endeavours of his Majesties and the Nations Enemies, for the Extir∣pation of the Protestant Religion, and the Subversion of the Laws and Liber∣ties, they unanimously declared, that they would Stand by, and Assist his Ma∣jesty with their Lives and Fortunes, in Supporting his Allies abroad, in redu∣cing Ireland, and in defence of the Protestant Religion of the King∣dom. To this his Majesty was pleased to return them a very Gracious Answer, expressing therein the valuable Esteem he had for Parliaments, and especially for this, expressing his Satisfaction of the Confidence and Trust they had re∣posed in him, and that it should be his Care never to give any Parliament cause of distrust; and withall recommending to them the care of the Allies abroad, and minding them of the greate Ex∣pence the States of Holland had been at in the Expedition and Zeal they had to promote it, and to second his Majesties
Endeavours even with a neglect of their own Safety, not doubting but their Gene∣rosity would not only enable him to make good his treaty with those States, and repay what they actually layd out, and of which an account should be given, but support them to their utmost Ability against the power of their Enemies, con∣sidering both Interests were upon one and the same Bottom. As to safety, his Majesty was likewise pleased to mind them of Ireland, and to let them know, that in his opinion 20000 men would be required to render the reducing it short and easie, as likewise setting out a Fleet which in conjunction with that of Holland, might be so entirely Master of the Seas that nothing might be sent from France to Ireland, or elsewhere, that might give a disturbance to us or our Allies; farther recommending to their consideration the settlement of the Revenues, that they might be col∣lected without dispute; promising that whatever should be given in order to publick ends, should be strictly apply∣ed to them, with many other Gracious expressions; concluding that as they so freely offered to hazard all that is dear to them, so he would as freely expose
his Life for the Support of the Prote∣stant Religion, and the Honour and Safety of the Nation. And now the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled as a grateful Acknowledgment to the Lords and Commons for their excellent Conducti∣on in Affairs, and especially their resolu∣tion to assist and stand by his Majesty in supporting his Allies abroad, in re∣ducing Ireland, in defence of the Prote∣stant Religion, and Laws of the King∣dom, drew up two humble Addresses of Thanks, one to the Lords, and the other to the Commons, which were presented and very kindly received; the first of these was presented by the Recorder, and the last by the Sheriffs of the Ho∣nourable City, who were dismissed with expressions of high Esteem, &c. For the said City an Address of Thanks was like∣wise presented to his Majesty by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council, upon his most condescending and unparallell'd Goodness in the Mes∣sage he was pleased to send to the two Houses, in relation to the Duty of Hearth-mony, promising as bound in duty and great obligations, to be ready
to serve and assist his Majesty as far as they were able in the support of his Crown and Dignity, and for the maintaining the Protestant Religion and Laws of the Land, and the speedy relief of the distressed Protestants in Ireland, &c. About this time we had News that the grea∣test part of the Regiment of Foot, late com∣manded by the Lord Dumbarton, and some Com∣panies of Fuziliers, made a Mutiny near Ipswych, and seized on the Money sent down to pay them, with four Field-pieces, and refusing to obey the King's Orders, marched away, doing great da∣mage, and bringing a greater terrour upon the Country people, proclaiming King James, &c. whereupon both houses Addressed his Majesty that he would be pleased to take such effectual Course, as in his Princely Wisdom should be thought fit for the suppressing and bringing them to Justice; and that in the mean time he would issue out his Royal Proclamation, decla∣ring them and their Adherents to be Rebels and Traitors, requiring all good Subjects to appre∣hend subdue and prosecute them, &c. To which His Majesty was pleased to answer, That he thanked both Houses for their Address, and that he had sent a Force of Horse and Dragoons sufficient to suppress them, and that he would issue out a Proclamation, as was desired. On the 16th of March His Majesty went by water to the House of Lords, attended with the usual Solemnity, and being in his Royal Robes, seated on the Throne, and the Commons sent for up, His Majesty gave the Royal Assent to an Act impowering him to apprehend such Per∣sons as he should find just cause to suspect are
conspiring against the Government, and to an Act for annulling and making void the Attain∣der of William Russel Esquire, commonly called Lord Russel, and then in a gracious Speech, a∣mongst other things, recommended to them the settling the Oaths, to be taken by all persons to be admitted to places of Trust; so that Papists might be excluded, and room left for all Prote∣stants that are willing to serve, the better to strengthen us against the common Adversaries; and the same day a Proclamation was signed by His Majesty, declaring those mutinous Officers and Soldiers, together with their Adherents, Rebels and Traitors, &c. commanding all good Subjects to apprehend, subdue and prosecute them as such. To shew this was no general defection of the Soldiers, but rather these few drawn into so great a folly and over-sight by sinister means, the same day an Address was humbly presented to His Majesty, signed by the Officers superi∣our and subordinate, with the unanimous Sub∣scriptions of the private Soldiers of the Regi∣ment of Foot under the conduct of the Right Honourable the Lord Mordant, expressing there∣in their unfeigned Loyalty, willing Obedience, and ready Zeal to serve his Majesty in all places and on all occasions. Nor was it long e'er those in Rebellion were brought under; for on the 19th of March the Regiments of Horse com∣manded by Sir John Lanier, and Collonel Lang∣ston, having joined the Dutch Troups of Horse and Dragoons, under the command of Lieute∣nant General Ginkell, and being informed that the Rebels were marching towards Seaford, they
advanced in good Order, the Dragoons, making the left Wing; the Rebels no sooner perceived the Troups, but they drew up in Batalia, plan∣ting their four Field-pieces to the best advan∣tage, having on one side a great Hedge, and on the other considerable Waters, which obli∣ged the Dragoons to swim; but perceiving the Resolution of the King's Troups to reduce them to their Obedience, they beat a Parly, and lay∣ing down their Arms, surrendred upon discre∣tion; so that there were taken the four Field∣pieces, and twenty Officers, and five hundred Soldiers were made Prisoners, and sent up to London, under a Guard of Horse, and there se∣cured in divers Prisons, whilst another party of Horse continued to search after such as had dis∣persed, some of which were afterward taken, and secured in divers Prisons. Sir John Chapman, Lord Mayor of the City of London, dying on the of March, the worthy Thomas Pilkington Esq since being Knighted, e∣lected Lord Mayor of that City for the remai∣ning part of this Year, was on the 22d presen∣ted to the Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal, and afterwards sworn at the Hustings, ac∣cording to Custome, and at five in the After∣noon was sworn without the Tower Gate by the Right Honourable the Lord Lucas, chief Go∣vernour of the Tower, in pursuance of their Majesties Writ to him directed, and of the an∣tient usage at such a time as the Exchequer Court is not holden at Westminster. Having before made mention of the intended Convention in Scotland, and now the time ap∣pointed for its sitting being come, it will not
seem foreign to this History to insert some re∣markable passages and Transactions relating to it and the Affairs of that Kingdom. On the 14th of March, in obedience to the King of England's Letter, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons assembled at Edinburgh in one House, as the Custome is, and chose Duke Hamilton their President, and consi∣dering the Duke of Gourdon, a Roman Catho∣lick, held the Castle, whose Cannon commanded the City, they made an Act, by which they empowered the Earls of Lothain and Tweddale to repair immediately to the Castle of Edinburgh, and to require him and others of his persuasion there, in the Name of the Estates of this King∣dom, to remove out of that Castle in twenty four hours after notice given, and to leave the Charge thereof to the next commanding Offi∣cer, being a Protestant, and that he, and those that were with him, upon such a compliance, should have assurance from the Estates, to be se∣cured and indempnified as to any thing they had acted in that or any other Station, contrary to Law, as being Papists. This done, they nominated a Committee of Election consisting of 15 persons, five of each Estate, and after some debate, whether the Lords Spiritual were a distinct Estate, or only a part of the same Estate with the Lords Tem∣poral, which was laid aside by the House, incli∣ning to the Negative, and rejecting the Prote∣stations against the sitting of the Earl of Argile before his Father's Attainder was taken off. A Motion was made, that in consideration the Ci∣ty was full of People, and many of them armed,
to prevent disorders, it was not inconvenient to command all persons, who were not Inhabitants, nor immediately belonging to the Members of this Convention, to depart the place, but it was the Opinion of the House, that the Castle, in the command of whose Cannon the City was, ought to be first surrendered, and for their bet∣ter assurance, a Committee was ordered to take care that no violation of the Peace were made. And the next day the Duke of Gourdon having sent a Paper by way of Excuse, for holding the Castle contrary to the mind of the Estates, it was read, and advantageous Terms offered him, and those with him, in consideration of a speedy Surrender; but soon after he discovered his De∣sign was only to trifle, that he might gain time, which obliged them to send for such a compe∣tent number of armed Men, as was capable to block it up, and prevent the Excursions of the Besieged; so that small bickerings frequently happened, though without any considerable da∣mage. In the mean while two Letters came to the Convention, one from King William, and the other from the late King, of which only the first was approved, and the Convention procee∣ded to take measures much like those of England, declaring the Throne vacant, &c. and made pre∣paration in order to fill it, suffering Men and Arms from England to enter that Kingdom, and it was in fine concluded, that King William and Queen Mary should be crowned King and Queen of the Kingdom of Scotland, and the Crown of∣fered them with an Instrument of Government to settle and regulate particulars.
Whilst these things passed in Scotland, with others of the like purport, a Proclamation by the King and Queen was issued out give to notice to the Peers, and such as had any Claim, or Right of Tenure, that the Royal Solemnity of their Co∣ronation was to be celebrated April 11th 1689. and on the 21st of March his Majesty going to the House of Lords, attended in the usual solem∣nity, and being in his Royal Robes, seated on the Throne, and the Commons being sent for up, gave his Royal Assent to an Act for gran∣ting a present Aid to their Majesties; and on the 31st of March the Right Reverend Dr Gil∣bert Burnet, being before Bishop elect of Salisbu∣ry, was consecrated according to the form pre∣scribed in the Book of Common Prayer, in the Chapel of the Palace at Fulham, by the Lord Bi∣shops of London, Winchester, Landaff, St Asaph, and Carlisle, by virtue of a Commission granted to them by his Grace the Archbishop of Canter∣bury. On Apr. 3. his Majesty went by water to the House of Lords, attended with the usual solem∣nity, and in the usual manner gave the Royal Assent to an Act for exhibiting a Bill in the pre∣sent Parliament for naturalizing the most Noble Prince George of Denmark; also to an Act for Re∣viving of Actions and Process lately depending in the Courts of Westminster, and discontinued by not holding of Hilary Term, and for supplying other Defects relating to Proceedings at Law; likewise to an Act for punishing Officers or Sol∣diers who shall mutinie or desert their Majesties Service; and in the Afternoon a Chapter being held of the most noble Order of the Garter, Duke
Frederick Mareschal de Schomberg, General of his Majesties Forces, and Master General of the Ordnance; and the Right Honourable William Earl of Devonshire Lord Steward of his Maje∣sties Houshold, were elected Knight-Compani∣ons of the Order, and invested with the Garter and George, having been first Knighted by the Sovereign with the usual Ceremony; and Dr. Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, was sworn and admitted Chancellour of that Order. On the 5th. of April his Grace the Duke of Ormond was installed in St. George's Chapel Knight-Com∣panion of the Noble Order, by the Duke of Grafton, and the Earl of Rochester, two Knight-Companions, who were thereunto Commissio∣ned by the Sovereign, with the usual Ceremo∣nies; which done, his Grace entertained the Commissioners, together with divers Persons of Quality, and the Officers of the Order, at a no∣ble Dinner, at the middle whereof Garter King at Arms, accompanied with the Officers at Arms, proclaimed his Grace's Style. About this time His Majesty caused notice to be given to all Protestant Officers that had been disbanded in Ireland, or lately quitted their Commands, they who were not yet employed in his Service to bring in their Names and Cer∣tificates of their former Commands, in order to their entering into Service, and Pay, &c. and to prevent false and seditious Rumours, as to the lessening the Pay of such Soldiers as should be sent over to the Low-Countries, His Maje∣sty was pleased to issue forth his Proclamation to assure them of full English Pay, and upon the English Establishment, as full to all Intents
as any other Regiments of his own Subjects of the same Quality, remaining in the Kingdom of England. The Parliament assembled at Westminster, ha∣ving duly weighed and considered the high con∣sequence, as to the security of our Religion, Laws, &c. in the Efficacy of a Coronation, an Act being drawn up, it passed the Royal Assent the 9th of April, in the 1st Year of their Ma∣jesties Reigns, entituled, An Act for establishing the Coronation Oath. The Oath in manner and form to be tendred. The Archbishop or Bishop shall say. Will you solemnly promised and swear to go∣vern the People of this Kingdom of England, and the Dominions thereto belonging, according to the Statutes in Parliament agreed on, and the Laws and Customs of the same? The King and Queen shall say, I solemnly promise so to doe. Archbishop or Bishop. Will you to your power cause Law and Ju∣stice in Mercy to be executed in all your Judg∣ments? King and Queen. I will. Archbishop or Bishop. Will you to the utmost of your Power main∣tain the Law of God, the true Profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant Reformed Religion established by Law? And will you preserve un∣to the Bishops and Clergy of this Realm, and to the Churches committed to their Charge, all
such Rights and Privileges as by Law do or shall appertain to any of them? King and Queen. All this I promise to doe. After this the King and Queen laying his and her hand upon the holy Gospel, shall say, King and Queen. These things which I have here before pro∣mised, I will perform and keep, So help me God. Then the King and Queen shall kiss the book. And this Oath by the same Act is to be admi∣nistred to all the Kings and Queens that shall succeed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm at their respective Coronations, by one of the Archbishops or Bishops, and to be done in pub∣lick. Thus every thing being in a readiness, and the expected day arrived, their Majesties be∣ing come from White-Hall to Westminster, the Heralds began to put the Proceedings in order, the Peers in the Lords House, and the Peeresses in the painted Chamber; so that about eleven in the morning their Majesties and the whole Proceeding were conducted into Westminster-Hall, where at the upper end a Throne being erected, their Majesties took their Seats under their Cloath of State on the inside the Table, which done, the Master of the Jewel-house presented to the Lord High Constable the Sword of State, also the Sword Curtana, and the two pointed Swords in their order, who in the like order de∣livered them to the Lord Great Chamberlain, and he having drawn them out of the Scaboards,
laid them on the Table before their Majesties, as likewise the Spurs. After which the Dean and Prebendaries of Westminster bring the Crowns and other Regalia, presented them severally, and then they were delivered to those Lords whose Office or Trust it was to bear them. Then the Proceeding began from Westminster Hall to the Abbey, where being entered, and each seated or placed in order, the Lord Bishop of London be∣gan with the Recognition, which ending with a general Shout and universal Acclamation of Joy, their Majesties offered, and the Lords who car∣ried the Regalia offered them at the Altar seve∣rally to be there disposed; after which the Li∣tany was sung by the Bishops of St. Asaph and Bangor; which ended, the Communion Service began, the Epistle taken out of the 1 Pet. 2. ver. 13, 17. was read by the Bishop of Carlisle, and the Gospel out of Mat. 22. 16, 22. was read by the Bishop of St. Asaph, after which fol∣lowed the Nicene Creed, and by this time the Bishop of Salisbury being in the Pulpit, after re∣peating the Lords Prayers took his Text 2 Sam. 23.3, 4. viz. The Lord God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, he that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God; and he shall be as the Light of the morning when the Sun riseth, even a morning without Clouds, as the tender Grass springing out of the Earth, by clear shining after rain. The Sermon, which lasted half an hour, be∣ing ended, their Majesties took the new establi∣shed Oath before mentioned, and after Veni Cre∣ator, was sung, and the Holy Oil consecrated, their Majesties were conducted to their Royal Chairs, placed on the Theatre, where the Ho∣nourable
Members of the House of Commons, who with their Speaker were seated in the north Cross, might have a full prospect, and there be∣ing disrobed of their Crimson Mantles, their Majesties were solemnly annointed, and presen∣ted with the Spurs and Sword, which being of∣fered up, and redeemed by the Earl of Portland, their Majesties were invested with the Imperial Robes and Orbs, after that with the Rings and Sceptres, and about four of the Clock the Crowns were placed on their heads by the Lord Bishop of London, assisted by the Lord Bishop of Rochester, upon which the Drums beat, the Trumpets sounded, the great Guns were fired, yet were drowned in a manner by the loud shouts and joyfull Acclamations of the People; and the Peers and Peeresses putting on their Coronets, the holy Bible was presented to their Majesties; and after the Benediction they vouch∣safed to kiss the Bishops, and then Te Deum was sung, and they ascended the Throne; the Arch∣bishop and Bishops doing jointly Homage, and kissed their Majesties left Cheeks, and after them the Temporal Peers did the like, whilest the Me∣dals were cast about by the Treasurer of the Houshold, inscribed on one side, Ne totus absu∣matur, and on the other Gulielmus & Maria Rex & Regina. After this began the Communion, their Majesties making their second Offering, and having received the Holy Sacrament they went in State into St. Edward's Chapel, where being divested of the Imperial Palls, &c. and robed in Purple Velvet, returned to Westminster-Hall with their Crowns of State on their Heads, the Peers and Peeresses wearing their Coronots
where a very splendid Entertainment was fur∣nished at sundry Tables, and between the first and second course Charles Dymcke Esq their Ma∣jesties Champion, came on Horseback complete∣ly armed, between the Lord High Constable and Earl Marshal, both on Horseback, and made his Chalenge, which was pronounced by York Herald in these words, viz. If an Person of what degree soever, high or low, shall deny or gainsay our Sovereign Lord and Lady, King William and Queen Mary, King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, to be rightfull King and Queen of this Realm of England, or that they ought not to enjoy the Impe∣rial Crown of the same, Here is their Champion who saith he lyeth, and is a false Traitor, being ready in Person to combate with him, and in this Quarrel will adventure his Life against him on what day soever be shall be appointed. After which their Majesties Styles were pro∣claimed in Latin, French, and English, and about eight in the evening they returned to White-Hall. This caused great Rejoicing in Holland as well as England, the States ordering it to be exprest by Bells, Bonfires, and Fireworks, &c. The Con∣vention in Scotland declared their Majesties King and Queen in the following manner, viz. After the Vote had passed, the Estates, assist∣ed by the Ld. Provost, Magistrates, and Council of Edinburgh, attended by Lyon, King at Arms, Heralds, Pursuvants and Trumpets, went to the Cross on foot, proclaimed their Majesties' King and Queen of Scotland, and deputed some of the Estates to offer the Crown with an Instrument of Government for settling that Kingdom,
