THE COPY OF A PAPER Found on the Speakers Chair, JANƲARY 16. 1689. ENTITULED, An Act of INDEMPNITY and Free PARDON FOR JAMES STEWARD Late King of England. WHereas the late King James the Second, without any Evil Counsellours, Wicked Judges, or Ministers, through Folly or Wickedness, hath been misled into Arbitrary Designs against the Government and himself, thereby becoming obnoxious to the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom; and the said King having broke the Original Contract between King and People, for which he Abdicated the Government, and the Throne thereby became Vacant. And, Whereas it is incident to Kings and Princes, being got on the Throne, to thirst after Arbitrary Power by the help of Flatterers, to their own Ruin and Destruction: And for that, though strict Enquiry hath been made after his Accomplices, yet none of them can be found out; and it appearing plain, that the said late King did all on his own Head, for the destroying of Charters, and
murdering his Subjects contrary to Law; Therefore, forasmuch as doubts may arise about the matters aforesaid, and to the End, that the wonted Clemency of the English Nation may be perpetually had in Ve∣neration, as well Abroad as at Home: Be it Enacted, by the King and Queen's Majesty, by and with the Consent and Advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, and by the Authority of the same; That the said late King James be Pardoned, Indemnified, and Saved harmless from all Pains, Penalties and Forfeitures whatsoever, for, and by reason of any Misdeeds, or Omissions by him made heretofore, contrary to the Laws of the Land whatsoever, until the 25th of December last past: And be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, that it may be lawful to and for their present Majesties, not only to Retain, and Keep in their most secret Councils, Places of Trust, and Offices, whatsoever, any of the late King James's Servants, Counsellours, or Officers what∣soever; but also, the said King James, (if their Majesties shall think fit) for the more secure Setling and Confirming Their Majesties King William and Queen Mary, in the Government of these Kingdoms, against Popery and Arbitrary Power, to entertain the said late King James, in any Place of Trust, or Profit whatsoever, Provided, the said King James, and all his Friends and Relations, which shall be Employed by Their Present Majesties, shall take the new Oaths, mentioned in an Act of this Present Parliament. Sir, Since the Generosity of the Nation is such, as to forgive such small Offences as Parliament Pensioners to Sell the Nation, to Introduce Popery and Arbitrary Power, to Destroy the Protestant Religion, Sur∣render Charters, to Root out Corporations, and thereby the Antient Constitution of these Kingdoms; Evil and Wicked Counsellours did all that in them lay, to Assist the late King, to make this Nation as France, and to forgive the very Actors in Murders by a pretence of Law, and to make King James the only scape-Goat run into the Wilder∣ness, Incurring the Sins of the whole Nation. It seems to me reason∣able, and I doubt not, it will be so to you, that an Act of Indemp∣nity may pass in this House, this Sessions, for the late King James; and therefore, as an honest man guided by Trust and Justice, I have sent you ready drawn a Bill of Indempnity for him, as well as for the rest, and do hope it will, by the good favour of this House, pass into a Law; in order to which, I hope you will lend your helping Hand, and Communicate the same to the House; and if you find any bawl at it, as some may do, get but a Ballotting Box, and I will war∣rant you, the major part of this House will be for passing this good Bill. Your Humble Servant,
