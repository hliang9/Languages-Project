To the Right Honorable the House of Peers, assembled in Parliament. The humble Petition of the County of Southampton. Most humbly sheweth, THat, according to Gods Word, whereof one tittle shall not fail, A Kingdom, or House divi∣ded, cannot stand: dissention and discord subvert and ruine the most potent Monarchs, and flourishing Estates in the world; but Peace and Religion are the works of absolute per∣fection, which being united, make a State unconquerable. To finish this work, is wor∣thy your Honours most serious employment, which we conceive cannot be effected, whilst the popish Lords, who are manifest enemies to both, are admitted to vote amongst you, and therefore their consent cannot be expected. They are Papists, who have raised Rebellion in Ireland, and desire nothing more than the utter destruction of all that professe the Protestant Religion; and have most mer∣cilesly imbrued their hands in the blood of very many of them: and we are confident, That the Priests and Papists in this Kingdom are confederate with them, and would do the like execution here; and had prevailed in their frequent attempts, if God in his mercy had not prevented their devillish plots to our preservation. Wherefore we earnestly pray (their malice being so apparently known) that the Popish Lords Votes may be taken away, and all Papists confined; for while they are at liberty, they will be ever contriving new mischiefs, to bring us to confusion. We further beseech you, That you will be pleased to joyn with the House of Commons, in advising and petitioning His sa∣cred Majesty to reside neer his Parliament, And that care be speedily taken that the Prince may be neer London, and have Education answerable to his high Birth and State; That Ireland may be relieved, The Seas guarded with a strong Fleet, Our Castles and Forts prepared for defence against forraign or domestick enemies; The Priviledges of Parliament maintained, which are the chiefest and most reall Inheritance, purchased and left to us by the great care and prowesse of our Ancestors; which we, with the like zeal and affection, intend to preserve to our posteri∣ty, most inviolable from all enforcements. And as we do acknowledge with all thankfulnesse your indefatigable labours, in composing the distracted estate of this Kingdom, of which we have lately had very good experience, especially in your Lordships Noble concurrence with the Honorable House of Commons in taking away the Votes of Bishops, and setling many other things of great concernment, So we shall faithfully, according to our Duty and Protestation, with our lives and Fortunes, defend his Royall Majesty, and your Honours, agreeing with the House of Commons, from all dangers, with our utmost power. To the Honourable, the House of Commons now assembled in Parliament. The humble Petition of the high-Sheriffe, Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen of the grand-Inquest, Ministers, Freeholders and inhabitants of the Countie of Southampton, at the generall Assises. Humbly sheweth, THat your Petitioners doe with all humble thankfulnesse and admiration, acknowledge the unwearied endeavours of this Honourable House, for the re-establishment of truth and peace amongst us, notwithstanding the malignant opposition of the popish and Prela∣ticall party, and are truely and thorowly sensible of the blessings we enjoy in the suppression of Arbitrary Government, Setling Tri∣enniall Parliaments, Disvoting Bishops, with many other great things expressed in your Remonstrance, which it hath pleased the Lord to ef∣fect for us, by your Noble means, whereof we rejoyce. That neverthelesse when we consider the great and manifold dangers that yet threaten this Kingdom, by invasion from forraigne parts, and by our own divisions at home, caused by the Votes of Popish Lords in the House of Peers, The continuall practises of their adherents in the Countrey, And nakednesse for defence; The corruptions yet remaining in the Church, The deplorable condition of our dear brethren in Ire∣land: particularly, when we reflect upon our own County, consisting of neer 250 Parishes, whereof we fear there is not a ifth part furnish∣ed with conscionable, constant Preaching Ministers: Unto which Spirituall calamity, we may adde the hazard we run in our Lives and Estates, through the decayes in our Castles and Forts, Our want of Ammunition, Weaknesse of our Trained Bands, Multitudes of Papists, not only re∣siding there, but resorting hither from other places, the ruine of Trades, and particularly of Cloathing, for which the people of these parts have formerly derived their greatest subsistence.
