Removed from the Golden Ball in St. Christopher's Church-Yard, to the Golden Ball in Princes-street, near Stocks Market. Where you may have A Certain Safe and Private Cure for any Venereal Por or Clay, by a Physician, not us'd to make himself Publick, nor had he now, only to oppose the Ignorant, and prevent the Ruine of such as labour under this Disaster. I shall not use many Invitations, rather leave you to make Experience then speak as you find: In a word, Let your Condition be never so bad, distrust not, although you have been under the hands of several Doctors, and by the use of their Medicines, grown rather worse then better, and tho' Fluxed several times to no purpose; nay, if you have Lan∣guished under it several Years, and are Pored to that de∣gree, that you are broke out in an hundred Places, I pro∣mise faithfully (under God) to make a Perfect Cure in a reasonable time, or desire Nothing for my Pains. But for those who have been lately Sporting, and by Chance have got a Clap or Running of the Reins, I promise to cure them in a Few Days, without loss of Time, or hindrance of any Business Advice or Proper Medicines in any Distemper. Note, The Golden Ball in Princes-street, is the Corner House, (where there is a Back-Door) turning down to Lothbury.
