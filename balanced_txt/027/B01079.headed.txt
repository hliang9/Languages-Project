A briefe Instruction, collected for the exercise of youth, and simple sort of people. Demaund. HOw wast yu created? Aunswer. By the hande of God. Gene. 1. 26. Demaund. herof wast thou created? Aunswer. Of the dust of the grounde. Gene. 2. 7. Demaund. What doest thou learne therby? Aunswer. That I should not waxe proude Eccl. 10. 7. Iere. 9. 23. Iere. 22. 29 of the Image of God: but that all vaine glory shoulde be cut away in mee. &c. For so much as I shall re∣turne Gene. 3. 19. to the earth againe. Demaund. What is God? Aunswer.
He is almightye, creator of all things, incomprehensible, inuisible, eternall, preseruer and gouernour of heauen and earth. &c. Demaund. Shewe wytnesse of the vnitie of God? Aunswer. Heare Israell, thy Lorde God is Deut. 6. one Lorde: and againe. I am the Lorde, first and the last, besyde mee Esa. 44. 1. Cor. 8. Ephe. 4. there is no God. Demaund. Howe many persons of the God∣head be there? Aunswer. There is only one godly substāce, but it is attributed vnto three per∣sons, that is to saye, the Father, the Gene. 1. 26. Iohn. 1. 1. cap. 10. 30. Sonne, and the holy Ghost, which be of one substaunce, lyke vnmeasu∣rable, and like euerlasting. Demaund. Howe prouest thou that there be
three persons? Aunswer. Christe commaunded all people Mark. 16. Math. 3. Iohn. 14. et. 15. 1. Iohn. 5. to bee Baptised in the name of the Father, and of the sonne, and of the holy ghost. Demaund. What is the Father? Aunswer. He is the fyrst person of the god∣head, Ephe. 4. 6. euerlasting, vnmeasurable, vnbegotten, and hauing his being of no man. Demaund. Who is the Sonne? Aunswer. He is the seconde person in god∣head, Gene. 1. Iohn. 1. Iohn. 17. 5. cap. 6. 62. Coll. 1. 15. . 15. vs. begotten of his father, before the worlde. Demaund. What is the holy Ghost? Aunswer. He is the thyrde person in god∣head, Math. 3. 16 Ioh. 14. 26. cap. 16. 7. lyke euerlasting, and lyke in
substaunce, vnto the Father, and the Sonne, proceeding from them both. Demaund. Why dyd God create thee? Anuswer. To serue him. Esai. 44. 21 Demaund. What seruice requireth he of thee? Aunswer. To serue him in spirite, & trueth. Iohn. 4. 23 Demaund. In howe many partes, maye the seruice of God be deuided? Aunswer. Into sowre partes. Demaund. Which be they? Aunswer. Obedience to the worde of God, Iohn. 8. 47 Esai. 1. 19. Deut. 6. 1. Re. 15. 22 to heare it, and to keepe it. The seconde part, is prayer, by the which we worshippe God, and Psa. 50. 15. Mat. 6. et. 7 Luk. 18. Psa. 141. 2. Psa. 148. 13 Psa. 51. 15. Rom. 12. 1. Hebr. 13. 1. Pete. 2. 5. Psa. 116. 11 et. 12. vs. call vpon him for all things.
The thirde, is the Sacrifyce of praise, from a faithfull hart, for the Lord requyreth nothing of vs, for all his benefytes bestowed vppon vs: but to be thankful, calling vpon his name, and obey his worde. The fowrth parte, of the seruice Psal. 2. 11. Leuit. 26. 2. Eccle. 4. 17 Iere. 7. 9. Dau. 9. 10. Exo. 17. 11 Hebr. 5. 7. of God, is the humble submission of the spyrite, with saythfull reue∣rence, and feare: for there is neither true obedience, true inuocation, nor yet true Sacrifice of prayse, where the submission of the spirite is wanting. Demaund. What are the Lawes of God? Aunswer. GOD spake all these words, and Exod. 20. 1. sayde, I am the Lorde thy God, which haue brought thee out of the Land of Egipt, out out of the house of bondage. 1 Thou shalt haue none other Gods but mee.
Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image, nor the lyke∣nesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, nor in the water vnder the earth, thou shalt not bow downe to them, nor worship them. For I the Lord thy God am a gelious God, and visit the sinnes of the Fathers vpon the chyldren, vnto the thyrde & fourth generation of them that hate mee: And shew mercie vnto thousands, in them that loue mee and keepe my commaundements. 3 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lorde thy God in vaine: For the Lord wyll not holde him guilt∣lesse, that taketh his name in vaine. 4 Remember thou keepe holy the Sabboth day: Sixe dayes shalt thou labour, and doo all that thou hast to doo. But the seuenth day, is the Sabboth of the Lord thy God: In it thou shalt doo no manner of
worke, thou and thy sonne, and thy Daughter, thy man seruaunt, and thy mayde seruaunt, thy Cattell, and the Straunger that is within thy gates. For in sixe dayes the Lorde made heauen and earth: the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seuenth daye: wherfore the Lorde blessed the seuenth daye, and hallowed it. 5 Honour thy Father, and Mo∣ther, that thy dayes maye be long in the Lande, which the Lorde thy God geueth thee. 6 Thou shalt do no murther. 7 Thou shalt not committe adul∣trie. 8 Thou shalt not steale. 9 Thou shalt not beare false wit∣nesse against thy neyghbour. 10 Thou shalte not desyre thy neyghbours house, thou shalt not couet thy neyghbours wyfe, nor  seruaunt, nor his mayde, nor
his oxe, nor his asse, nor any thing that is thy neyghbours. Demaund. Arte thou bounde to obserue these preceptes, in thought, worde and deede. Aunswer. Ezec. 18. 10. Luke. 2. 10. Leuit. 18. 5. Math. 5. 28 Yea, and if I breake but one of them, in thought, worde or deede, once onely in all my lyfe: I shall be guilty of eternall death. Demaund. Doest thou keepe them? Aunswer. Rom. 1. 3 cap. 7. No, nor no man verely. Demaund. Then thou grauntest thy selfe, all men worthy of Gods displeasure, and eternall dampnation? Aunswer. Rom. 1. 18 cap. 2. 8. Deut. 27. 1. Cor. 6. 9. Mat. 25. 41 Yea, verely, I feele Gods wrath, and dampnation, to be my reward. Demaund. Howe shalte thou escape Gods
wrath, and this dampnation? Aunswer. Onely by Iesus Christe. Demaund. Howe shall he saue thee? Aunswer. Because he being Iohn. 10. 30. cap. 14. 28. God, and mā, hath Ea. 53. Math. 8. 17 suffered all the punishment due for my sinnes, and Ro. 10. 40 hath fulfyl∣led the lawe. Demaund. Arte thou so freelye redeemed by Christe, that thou needest do Sa∣crifysing Priest, or ony other me∣rite, or meanes, to helpe thee to saluation? Aunswer. Yea, verelie, for Ro. 4. 25. cap. 7. 24. cap. 5. 1. cap. 8. 2. Christe was de∣lyuered for my synne, and rose a∣gaine for my iustificacion: and hath Ro. 3. 24 1. Pet. 2. 24 1. Ioh. 1. 7. freely payde my raunsome to his Father. Demaund. Shall all men be saued by Christe?
Aunswer. No, Ioh. 8. 24 31. et. c. vs. cap. 15. 5. Rom. 6. 5. Hed. 3. 14. none but such as beleeue effectuallie in him, and lyue theraf∣ter. Demaund. Who beleeueth thus in him? Aunswer. They . Ioh. 2. 12. cap. 3. 2. onely that assure then selues, that all his sufferinges was for them, and so trauell 1. Ioh. 3. 3. mortify∣cation of the flesh. Demaund. Who worketh in thee, this beleefe, and this mortifycation? Aunswer. The holy ghost doth work it me, by Ioh. 1. 3 I. 1. 18. cap. c. 6. Rom. 10. 17 Psal. 19. 7. 1 Tim. 4. 16 hearing the worde preached. Demaund. Maye euery one that beleeueth ef∣fectually, and trauell to mortifie A raunce of saluati∣on. the fleshe, by the helpe of the spy∣rite: assure them selues of saluati∣on. Aunswer.
Yea, verelie, for Saint Paule sayth, Rom. 8. 1. 2. et. 14. v, Ro. 5. 1. etc. 1. Iohn. 3. 2. 1. Cor. 13. 5 Iohn. 5. 24 et. 26. vs. cap. 11. 25. cap. 8. 26. there is no dampnation, to them that are in Christe Iesus: Which walke not after the fleshe, but after the spirite. Demaund. Maye euerie man that trauell, not mortifycation of the fleshe, but ly∣ueth in fylthy sinne: assure him selfe of saluation? Aunswer. No not so. For he is the Phi. 3. 18 Reue. 3. 9. 1. Cor. 6. Math. 25. enimie of Christe: and doth Heb. . 6. crucifie the sonne of God. &c. Demaund. That we maye the better vnder∣stande, that thou art the chylde of God, thorowe fayth in Iesus Christe: declare the effect of thy beleefe? Aunswer. I beleeue in God the father al∣mightie, maker of heauen & earth. And in Iesus Christe, his onely
Sonne our Lord: which was con∣ceyued by the holy ghoste, borne of the virgin Marie. He suffered vn∣der Pontius Pilate, was crucify∣ed, dead and buried, hee descended into hell, and the thirde day he rose againe from death. He ascended into Heauen, and sytteth on the ryght hande of God the Father al∣mightie. From thence shall he come to iudge bothe the quicke and the dead. I beleeue in the holy Ghost. The holy Catholike Church. The Communion of Saints. The for∣geuenesse of sinnes. The resurrec∣tion of the body. And the lyfe euer∣lasting. So be it. Demaund. Is thy fayth perfect assone as thou beleeuest? Aunswer. Not so: but increaseth by Rom. 10. 17. cap. 1. 16. Ephe. 4. 7. hea¦ring the word of God: vsing Lu. 21. 36. prai∣ers, and 1. Cor. 11. 26. Sacraments.
Demaund. Thou sayest, prayers is a helpe to increase thy fayth? Aunswer. Yea, for it Mat. 7. 11 assures me that I shal haue all thinges that I aske for, in Christes name, agreeing to his wyll. Demaund. What thinges mayst thou pray for, agrreeing to the wyll of God? Aunswer. For Ioh. 16. 24. Iac. 5. 16. ioye, and for the increase of loue, betweene all degrees: Iac. 1. 5. 3. Reg. 3. for heauenly wisedome: for the Luk. 11. 13 holye ghoste. To be delyuered from euyll in the tyme of Math. 26 temptation. For to obtayne Luk. 21. 36. vs. mercie of our heauenlye Father. Demaund. Is God content, and pleased with euerie mans prayer? Aunswer. No: for if we praye to him, not a∣greeing
to his wyll, hee wyll o heare vs. Demaund. What thinges are not agreeing to his wyll, that we maye not praye for? Aunswer. To praye to them that bee dead for any thing: as to the virgin Ma∣rie, or any other, for any thing, is not agreeing to his wyll. For wee haue but onely 1. Ioh. 2. 1 1. Tim. 2. 5 Iohn. 14. 6. Mat. 11. 28 one mediatour, to praye for vs, and that is Christ. Demaund. Doth them that bee deafe, heare when they be prayed vnto? Aunswer. No, for the Prophet Esay sayeth vnto the Lorde: thou 1. Esa. 6;. 6 art our Fa∣ther, for Abraham knoweth vs not, neyther is Israell acquainted with vs. Demaund. Maye wee praye for them that
be dead? Aunswer. No, for it is not agreeing to ye wil of God. For 1. Ioh. 5. 14. 2. Re. 12. 22. Eccle. 17. 18 Luke. 16. 26 Saint Iohn sayth, there is a sinne vnto death, I saye not, that thou shouldest praye for it. Demaund. What sayest thou of them that liue in fylthie sinnes, are their prayers heard? Aunswer. No, for 1. Reg. 25 22. Pro. 28. 9. Iohn. 4. 7. disobedience, and wic∣ked Esa. 59. 1 Psa. 66. 16. Iere. 7. 9. sinnes, is the cause that God wyll not heare our prayers. Demaund. What is prayer? Aunswer. It is a peticion made vnto God, for thinges that we haue neede of, with the affection of the harte. Demaund. Howe many kynde of prayers be there?
Aunswer. Psa. 50. 15. Two: Inuocation, and prayer. Demaund. What is Inuocation? Aunswer. It is, wherby God is called vpon in any thing. Demaund. Howe many thinges be requyred in prayer? Aunswer. Fowre. The commaundement of God. The promise: Fayth, and the thinges desired. Demaund. What is the fyrst? Aunswer. The commaundement of GOD which Psal. 50. Mat. 6. et. 7 Luke. 18. commaundeth vs to pray, and call vpon him: and as it is sinne to sweare, so it is 1. Reg. 12 23. synne not to praye. Demaund. What is the seconde?
Aunswer. The promise of God, which cer∣tifyeth vs yt our prayers are heard in Christes name. For Christe sayth, Iohn. 16. 23. Math. 7. Luke. 11. 13 Psa. 50. 15. Acts. 12. 5. whatsoeuer ye shal aske the Father in my name, he wyll geue it you. Demaund. What is the thirde? Aunswer. Faith, for we must beleeue that our sinnes are forgeuen vs, when we pray with pensiue harts. Mark. 1. 24. Iac. 1. 5. Math. 8. 2. For Christe sayth, what thing so euer when ye praye, beleeue that ye re∣ceyue them, and ye shal haue them. Demaund. What is the fowrth? Aunswer. The thing that is asked? Demaund. What things must we aske? Aunswer. For heauenly wisedome from b. Iac. 1. Luk. 11. 3. Reg. 3.
aboue, and we shall haue it. Math. 26 Psal. 50. 15. In the tyme of trouble, seeke for helpe from aboue, and it shall be de∣lyuered. Math. 11. 28. If any man be werie of the bur∣den of sinne, let him aske for mercie, and he shall haue it. Doth any man lacke Iohn. 16. 23. Ezech. 18. loue, from a pure hart toward God, and man, let him praye for it, and God wyll geue it him. Or whatsoeuer we haue neede of, as we are taught in the Lordes prayer. Demaund. What is the Lordes prayer? Aunswer. It is a briefe forme of praying, which Christ taught his disciples, and all faithfull men: saying. When ye praye, say thus. OVr father which art in heauen, Math. 6. Halowed be thy name. Thy kingdome come. Thy wyll be done in earth as it is in heauen. Geue vs
this day our dayly bread. And for∣geue vs our trespasses, as we for∣geue thē that trespasse against vs. And leade vs not into temptation. But delyuer vs from euyll. For thine is the kingdome, the power & glorie, nowe and for euer. Amen. Demaund. How many Sacraments be there? Aunswer. Two, the Lordes Supper, and Baptisme. Demaund. What is a Sacrame▪ Aunswer. It is a holy signe instituted of God, to confyrme my fayth, and to seale in my harte, the promises of Gods mercie towardes mee, for the for∣geuenesse of my sinnes, and saluati∣on in Christe. Demaund. W are Sacramentes in gene∣▪
Aunswer. They are visible signes, whiche sygnifie vnto vs, both grace and coniunction with Christe, and seale vnto vs the promises of saluation, Gen. 17. 4 et. 10. vs. for God delyuered vnto vs sacra∣mentes, as seales of his promises, and when we haue receyued them, Gal. 3. 27 they beare wytnesse that we be∣long vnto Christe. Demaund. Who gaue the sacraments? Aunswer. The author and geuer of the sa∣cramentes, is God the Gen. 27. 10. Father, Mar. 16. Math. 26. and his sonne Iesus Christe our Lorde. Demaund. Are there seuen sacramentes, as the Bishop of Rome affyrmeth? Aunswer. No, but two, as we haue sayde before: for the other sacramentes, can be no sacraments, because they
want the manifest woordes of pro∣mise, which shoulde by a visyble sygne be sealed, and because there is no commaundement geuen of God, wherby we are bounde to ob∣serue them as sacraments. Demaund. What do you come to receyue? Aunswer. The holy sacrament of the body, and blood of Christe. Demaund. Why doest thou come to receyue it? Aunswer. Because God hath commaunded mee, Lu. 22. 19 1. Cor. 11. saying: doo this in remem∣brance of mee. Demaund. Of howe many partes, consisteth a sacrament? Aunswer.
Of two partes. The outwarde Element, being a visible signe: and the inuisible grace. Demaund. What is the outwarde signe? Aunswer. Math. 26 Bread and Wine, which the Lorde hath commaunded to be re∣ceyued. Demaund. What is the heauenly part? Aunswer. It is the body and blood of Christ which was broken for mee, and Math. 27 Iohn. 19. 34. shedde for mee, which is eaten and dronken of the faythfull, spiritual∣lie. Demaund. Is the Breade and Wine, chaun∣ged into the bodye and blood of Christe? Aunswer. No, for then the nature of the Sacrament were destroyed. For
God ordayned it to be receyued in the Math. 29 Luke. 22. Augu. To eate Christ, is to be re∣freshed, and to drink him is to lyue. remembraunce of his death. The breade sacramentally, is the Lordes body, and so lykewise the cuppe. The cuppe naturallie, is a cuppe of wine, but sacramentally, it is the cuppe of the Lordes blood & newe Testament. Christe called it his blood, not that his blood shoulde be really in it, but that it should be the Sacra∣ment of his blood, Demaund. Was this Supper ordayned of Christe, to be offered as a Sacri∣fice to God the Father for remis∣sion of sinnes? Aunswer. No truly, for when Christe dyed vpon the Crosse, he Heb. 7. 27 cap. 9. 21. et. c. cap. 10. 10. 14. 18. et. 26. vs. once fullye made, that onely euerlasting sacri∣fice, for our saluation for euer. The bread was delyuered to the
Disciples: as the sacrament of the Lordes body, but the verie body it selfe, shoulde be geuen vpon the crosse, not to the Disciples, but to God the father for the Disciples. Demaund. What is the Lordes Supper? Aunswer. It is the sacrament of my redem∣tion, by the death of Christ. Demaund. What thinkest thou of the Lordes Supper? Aunswer. I beleeue that as my bodye is nourished with breade, and wyne, there broken, and powred for thee, that euen so my soule is nourished spiritually by Christes body, bro∣ken, and his bloodshed; for the re∣mission of my synnes. Demaund.
Wherfore it is our duetie to 1. Cor. 10 16. Math. 26. geue thankes at the Lords supper. And the Lorde gaue thankes therat. Thirdlie, it putteth vs in remē∣braunce, that as the bread which we eate, is made of many graines, one loafe, and the grapes being many, pressed together, is made one wine: so we being many, are Rom. 11. 4. et. c. 1. Cor. 1. 17 cap 12. 27. one bodye, whereof Christe is the heade. Seeing then that, we are all one body, we ought to helpe one ano∣ther, and to Rom. 1. 2 In. 3. 17. b. 1. Cor. 3 . 2. et. c. loue one another. Demaund. What is our duetie to doo, that we maye come to the Lordes supper rightlie? Aunswer. To examine our selues, whether wee be true members of Christe, depending our 2. Cor. 13. 5. Hebr. 11. 4. faith wholie vpon him, as our Act. 4. 12 Math. 1. 2▪ only sauiour. Secondly, to examine our selues,
whether wee bee in loue one with another, Mat. 5. 23 cap. 18. and forgeue one ano∣ther. Thirdlie, we must examine our selues, what sinnes we haue com∣mitted, and repent, that wee maye with a cleare Sap. 17. Eccle. 18. Psa. 26. 6. conscience, come to the Lordes Table. Demaund. What is Baptisme? Aunswer. Baptisme, is the Sacrament of our Tit. 3. 5. regeneration: cleansing ad∣mission, sanctifycation, incorpora∣tion, admission, wherby they which do Act. 2. 38 repent, and professe the fayth, and Religion of Christe, are incor∣porated, & Gal. 3. 27 consigned vp to Christ and his Church. Demaund. Who dyd institute Baptisme? Aunswer. Mat. 28. Mark. 16. Our sauiour Christe.
Demaund. What doth baptisme signifie? Aunswer. It declareth the 1. Pet. 1. 19. Iohn. 3. 5. Act. 2. 38. washing away of my sinnes by Christes blood, and my new byrth. Demaund. Can none assure them selues of sal∣uation, vnlesse they be Baptised? Aunswer. I saye not so, Gods grace is not tyed to externe Elementes, we be∣leeue his Gen. 17. c Rom. 4. 11 promise, and therefore doubte not, but the chyldren of the faythfull are saued, although they passe awaye in their mothers wombe, for they are holye by ver∣tue of the Ge. 17. 30 couenaunt. And are Ier. 1. 5. 1. Cor. 7. 14 sanctifyed in their mothers wombe. For example Gene. 25 23. Rom. 9. 9. et. 11. vs. Isaac, which was borne the chylde of God, by vertue of the promise. Whereby it followeth that the promise is the fountayne of saluation, and not
the sacrament. Another example, the L. 2. 24 theefe that dyed with Christe asked for mercie, and was saued: where was he baptised. Demaund. Is it in our wyll to be baptised, or not to be baptised? Aunswer. We are Math. 28 Mark. 16. Iohn. 3. 5. commaunded of Christe to be baptised, and therfore he that maye be baptised, and wyll not, hee breaketh the commaundement of God, and is Ge. 17. 14 Reu. 22. 19 cursed. Demaund. Maye one fall from grace, after he is baptised? Aunswer. Yea verelie, for whoremongers, swearers, and other wicked liuers do fall from the Gal. 5. 4. Tir. 1. 16. grace, and as long as they remayne in sinne, they are Ep. 2. 12. without God, and Ioh. 15. 6 cutte of from the vine Christ, and can not be 1. Cor. 6. 9 Hebr. 10. 26 Math. 25. sa∣ued, although they be baptised, vn∣lesse
they Luk. 13. 4. repent. 1. Pet. 3. 21. Saint Peter sayth, Baptisme taketh not awaye the fylth of the flesh: But in that a good conscience consenting to God, by the resurrec∣tiō of Iesus Christ. 1. Cor. 7. 9 Rom. 2. 25. Gal. 6, 15. And S. Paule sayth: circumcision is nothing, and vncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the cōmaundements of God. So then, Baptisme is no cause of our saluation. For example Act. 8. 27. Simon Magus, which was bap∣tised, and yet remayned the chylde of the deuyll. Demaund. What deest thou promise, when thou art Baptised? Aunswer. I promise to forsake the deuyll, the worlde, and the flesh, and to bee Christes seruaunt all the dayes of my lyfe. Demaund. Dyddest thou neuer breake thys
promise? Aunswer. Yea, for if I sweare, lye, steale, or doo any other thing, contracie to the wyll of God: I breake my pro∣mise made vnto God. Demaund. Whose seruaunt art thou, when thou hast broken thy promise: the seruaunt of God? Aunswer. No, verelie, for Christe sayth, Ioh. 8. 34. Rom. 6. 23. Math. 6. 24 he that committeth synne, is the ser∣uaunt of sinne. Demaund. What is the rewarde of this ser∣uaunt, for breaking his promise made in Baptisme? Aunswer. Rom. 6. 23 cap. 8. 6. Dampnation, for Saint Pa sayth, the reward of sinne, is death▪ Demaund. What is done of thee nowe, seeing thou hast forsaken thy promise,
, to lyue styll in that state of dampnation? Aunswer. No, but to remember my pro∣mise, and returne vnto God for the remission of my sinnes, and for his holy spirite, to leade mee into newnesse of lyfe. Demaund. Doest thou thinke that God wyll receyue thee, if thou repent, seeing thou hast broken thy promise in Baptisme, and lyued in fylthie sinne many yeares, seruing 1. Ioh. 3. 8 et. 10. vs. the deuyll. &c. Aunswer. Yea, trulie, for Christe sayth, Luk. 5. 32 I came to call the synners to repen∣taunce: I am a synner, and if I re∣pent, and forsake sinne, I beleeue, I am become his Luk. 15. 21. et. c. seruaunt againe, and all my sinnes forgeuen me, ac∣rding to his Math. 11 28. promise. Demaund.
What difference is  ¦crament, and a sacrifi▪ Aunswer. A Sacrament is a signe, or  of the promise of God, that he ge∣ueth vnto vs a certaine thing. So was circumcision, a certaine token whereby he woulde c receyue the Ge. 17. 10 circumcised. Baptisme is a token whereby God worketh with vs, and b receyue vs vnto grace. Gal. 3. 27 Sacrificium, is a worke of ours, which we geue vnto God. Wherby we c honour him. Psal. 50. Demaund. Howe many kindes of Sacrifices be there? Aunswer. Two, the one is called Propitia∣torium, that is, which obtayneth mercie, and appeaseth the wrath of God.
The other is called, Eucharisti∣cum, that is to saye, a thankesge∣uing. Demaund. What is Sacrificium Propitiato∣rium. Aunswer. It is a worke, Esa. Math. 8. deseruing remis∣sion of sinnes, & deliueraunce from euerlasting punishment: and there is onelie Hebr. 9. et. 10. one Sacrifice, which de∣serueth remission of sinnes: that is to saye, the death and passion of Christe.
