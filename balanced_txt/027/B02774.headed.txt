Draught of an ACT concerning the Mint. OUR Soveraign Lord Considering, That by the Act of Parliament 1686, Intituled Act anent an humble Offer to His Majesty for an Imposition upon certain Commodities for defraying the Expence of a free Coinage, and other Matters relating to the Mint: The for∣said Expence of a free Coinage, and several Matters relating to the Mint were indeed settled, but neither so perfectly nor so fully as experience hath since discovered; But that there is still need and place for a farder Regulation. Doth therefore with Advice and Consent of the Estates of Parliament, Statute and Ordain, that notwithstanding it be Recommended by the said Act to the Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, to try by some of their Number every Journal of Coyne by itself dictinctly, and that twice every year. viz. In the moneth of July and December yearly: yet seeing the forsaid distinct tryal of every Journal hath been found both a Tedious and Superfluous Labour, and is not practised any where else; It shal be Leisome for the saids Lords of His Majesties Privy Council to make the said Tryal by such of their Number as they shal think fit, not of every Journal of Coyne by itself distinctly; but by taking and mak∣ing Tryal of any one or more single Journals as they shal think fit: And then to cause Melt down in one Masse or Lignat the rest of the Journals to be at that time Tried, and to take an Essay of the Mass so Melted down as said is which shal stand for the whole, but Prejudice always to the saids Lords of Council, to make distinct Tryals of the haill forsaid Journals as they shal see cause: As also still Recommending to them the exact Tryal of all matters relating to the Coynage at the for said two times above specified in manner mentioned in the said Act. And farder, for the better ascertaining of the Fineness of the Coyne, His Ma∣jesty with Advice and Consent for said, doth hereby Ordain, that not only the Principal or Counter-warden be present at the taking off all Essays: but that there be a Plate of Silver of the true Standard fineness made by the, Essay∣Master at the sight of such as the Lords of Privy Council shal think fit to Appoint, which Plate duely made and Marked, one half thereof shal be put in the hands of the Clerk of Exchequer for a Proof of the general Essay, and the other half in the hands of the Principal or Counter-warden: that all the Pott and Pix Essays may be thereby Made and Examined.
