A PETITION OF The Major, Aldermen, and Common-Councell of the Citie of LONDON, To His Majestie. Together with His Majesties gra∣cious ANSWER thereunto. LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of JOHN BILL. MDCXLI.
TO THE KINGS MOST Excellent MAJESTIE. The humble Petition of the Maior, Alder∣men, and Common-Councell, of the Citie of LONDON. MAy it please Your most Excellent Ma∣jestie; The often ex∣pressions of Your most gracious accept∣ance of the manifestation of the Petitioners duty and loyalty, and the frequent Declarations of Your Majesties great care of the good and welfare of this City, and of
the true Protestant Religion, and of protecting and preserving the Persons and Priviledges of Your great Councell assembled in the high Court of Parliament: Each encouraged the Petitioners to re∣present the great Dangers, Fears, and Distractions wherein the Ci∣tie now is, by reason of the pre∣vailing progresse of the bloody Rebels in Ireland, fomented, and acted by the Papists and their ad∣herents, and want of Aid to sup∣presse them, and the severall inti∣mations they have had both For∣raign and at Home, of the driving on of their Designes, tending to the utter ruine of the Protestant Religion, and of the Lives and Liberties of Your Majesties loy∣all
Subjects, the putting out of Persons of Honour and trust from being Constable and Lieutenant of the Tower, especially in these times, and the preparations there lately made, the fortifying of VVhitehall with men and Muni∣tion in an unusuall manner: Some of which men with provoking language and violence, abused divers Citizens passing by, and the drawing divers swords, and therewith wounding sundry other Citizens in VVestminster-Hall, that were unarmed: the late en∣deavours used to the Innes of Court, the calling in divers C∣noniers, and other assistance into the Tower, the late discovery of divers fire-works in the hands of a
Papist, and the misunderstanding betwixt Your Majestie and Par∣liament, by reason of misinforma∣tion, as they humbly conceive. Besides all which, the Petitioners fears are exceedingly encreased by your Majesties late going into the House of Commons attended with a great multitude of armed men besides Your ordinary Guard, for the apprehending of divers members of that House, to the en∣dangering of Your Sacred Person, and of the Persons and Priviledges of that Honourable Assembly. The effects of all which Fears tend, not only to the overthrow of the whole Trade of this City and Kingdom, which the Petiti∣oners already feel in a deep mea∣sure;
but also threatens the utter ruine of the Protestant Religion, and the lives and Liberties of all Your Loyall Subjects. The Petitioners therefore most Humbly pray Your Sacred Maje∣stie, That by the advice of Your great Councell in Parliament, the Protestants in Ireland may be spee∣dily relieved, The Tower put into the hands of Persons of trust: That by removeall of doubtfull and unknown Persons from about VVhite-Hall and VVestminster, a known and approved Guard may be appointed for the safetie of Your Majestie and Parliament, and that the Lord Mandevill and the five Members of the House of Commons, lately accu∣sed,
may not be restrained of liber∣tie, or proceeded against, other∣wise then according to the privi∣ledges of Parliament. And the Petitioners (as in all duty bound) shall pray for Your Majesties most long and happy Reign, &c.
HIS MAJESTIES ANSWER To the Petition of the Maior, Aldermen, and Common Councell of the Citie of LONDON. HIS Majestie ha∣ving fully conside∣red the matter of this Petition, Is graciously pleased to declare, that being unalterably resolved to make good all His expressions and declarations of
His care of this City; Of the true Protestant Religion, and of the Priviledges of Parliament; His Majestie takes in good part, the intimation given by the Petitioners of the fears and distractions where∣in the City now seems to be. And though Hee conceives Hee did on Wednesday at the Guild-Hall sa∣tisfie most of those particulars, is pleased to adde this further An∣swer. 1 That for the sad businesse of Ireland, His Majestie cannot pos∣sibly expresse a greater sence then He hath done, there being nothing left on His Majesties part unoffer∣ed or undone. And He hoped by the speedy advice and assistance of His Parliament, that great and necessary
VVork would be put in a just for∣wardnesse, to which his Majestie will contribute all His power: And how zealous Hee is and hath been therein, will appear in a Declarati∣on speedily to be set forth by His Majestie. 2 For the Tower: His Ma∣jestie wonders, that having removed a Servant of good Trust and Reputa∣tion, from that Charge, onely to satis∣fie the fears of the Citie, and put in another of unquestionable Reputati∣on, and known abilitie, the Peti∣tioners should still entertain those fears; and whatever preparation of Strength is there made, is with as great an Eye of safety and advantage to the Citie, as to his Majesties own Person, and shall
be equally imployed to both. 3 For the fortifying of White-Hall with Men and Munition in an unusuall way: His Majestie doubts not, but the Petitioners have obser∣ved the strange provocation He hath received to entertain that Guard: That by the disorderly, and tumul∣tuous conflux of people at VVestmin∣ster and VVhite-Hall, his Majesties great Councell was not onely disquiet∣ed, but his own Royall Person in danger, most seditious language be∣ing uttered even under His own windows, whilest the examination and punishing such Tumults by the course of Law were interrupted and stopped. And if any Citizens were wounded or ill intreated, his Maje∣stie is confidently assured, that it
hapned by their own evill and cor∣rupt demeanours. 4 His Majestie knowes no other endeavours to the Innes of Court, then a gracious Intimation, That He received the tender of their loyall and dutifull Affections with very good Approbation and Acceptance, and an incouragement given them to continue the same upon all occasions. Neither doth His Majestie know, what discovery hath been lately made of fire-works in the hands of any Papist. 5 For His going to the House of Commons (when His attendants were no otherwise armed then as Gen∣tlemen with swords) His Majestie is verily perswaded, That if the Pe∣titioners knew the clear grounds upon
which those persons stand accused of high Treason, and what will be pro∣ved against them (which in due time they shall be acquainted with) and considered the gentle way His Maje∣stie took for their apprehension (which He preferd before any course of violence, though that way had been very justifiable; for His Majestie is very well assured that it is notoriously known, That no priviledge of Par∣liament can extend to Treason, Fe∣lonie, or breach of the Peace) the Petitioners would beleeve his Maje∣sties going thither was an Act of grace and favour to that House, and the most peaceable way of having that necessary service for the appre∣hension of those persons performed; specially, if such Orders have been
made (which his Majestie is not wil∣ling to beleeve) for the resistance of all lawfull Authority, as are discour∣sed of. 6 And for the proceedings against those Persons mentioned in the Pe∣tition; his Majestie ever intended the same should be with all justice and favour according to the Laws and Statutes of the Realme; to the which all innocent men would cheerfully submit. And this extraordinary way of sa∣tisfying a Petition of so unusuall a nature, his Majesty is confidently per∣swaded, will be thought the greatest instance can be given of his Maje∣sties clear intention to his Subjects, and of the singular estimation He
hath of the good affections of this Ci∣tie, which He beleeves in gratitude will never be wanting to His just Commands and service. FINIS
