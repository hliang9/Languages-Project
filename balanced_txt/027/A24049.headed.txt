TO THE READER. HAving met with this little Book, I thought it not unfit to publish it in our Tongue, were it for no other Rea∣son than that no Body may be ignorant how great an Esteem our Glorious Monarch's matchless Virtues have gained him in the remotest Parts of Europe. The Reader is desired to take notice, That being composed in Italian, the New, Ro∣man, Style is made use of: And if there be any Events misda∣ted, it is expected so small an Error may, in a Stranger, be pardonable; especially in one whose other celebrated Works have made large amends to the letter'd part of the World. In short, if the Reader is deceived in his Expectation (which were hard) we hope the Exhorbitancy of the Price will not much impair his Pocket, nor that of the Volume be too great an Exercise for his Patience.
