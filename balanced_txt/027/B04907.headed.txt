The Parliament Dissolv'd at OXFORD, March 28. 1681. From Devonshire. UNder 500 KINGS Three Kingdoms grone: GO F. Dissolve them, CHARLES is in the Throne, And by the Grace of God will Reign alone. What would the Commons have? the Royal Line Heaven does dispose of; Tis not Theirs, nor Mine, But His by whom KINGS Rule, and are Divine. I Represent the KING of KINGS who gave, The Crown, the Sword, the Scepter; What I have; I am God's Servant, not the Peoples Slave. Their Frantick Votes, and Mad Resolves I hate: I know a better way to Heal a STATE, Than to Sin Rashly, and Repent too late. Bid them be gone F. They are Damn'd Uncivil, To oblidge Me to follow them to th'Divil, To Save Three Kingdoms I will not do evil. The Presbyterian's Sick of too much Freedom, Are ripe for Bethle'm; it's high time to bleed'em; The Second CHARLES does neither Fear nor Need'em. I'le have the VVorld know that I can Dissipate Those Impolitick Mushrooms of our STATE; Tis easier to Dissolve then to Create. They shan't Cramp Justice with their Feigned Flaws; For since I Govern only by the LAWS; Why They should be Exempt, I see no Cause. To the LAWS They must Submit; 'tis in vain E're to Attempt to shake off those again: For where CHARLES Commands, There must Justice Reign. When the Peoples Father does Espouse the LAW, All those who Subjects from their Duty draw, Do Viper-like, through Parents Bosom gnaw. When They Attend Me next, F. Bid Them bring Calmer Thoughts: Bid Them Propose Legal Things: Such as may both become Themselves, and KINGS. This will the Joyes of our Little World Compleat, And all Attempts of Foreign Foes Defeat: Making the People Happy, MONARCH Great. Edinburgh, Re-printed in the year 1681. FINIS.
