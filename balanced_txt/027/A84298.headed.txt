EXPEDIENTS FOR Publique Peace. Shewing the Necessity of a NATIONAL ƲNION And the way to it in this time of Danger. — En, que discordia Cives Perduxit miseros.— Printed, In the Year, 1660.
EXPEDIENTS FOR Publique Peace. THough the Providence of God hath won∣derfully begun our conduct towards Settlement, not through a Red-sea of bloud, (which both our sins deserved, and our late condition threatned) but a Crystal stream of calme waters; and though his goodness hath, beyond our hopes, appeared in confounding even confusion it self, in dissipating the proudest Faction that ever was, since the fall of Angels, and building of Babel. And (to speak their own language) in bearing witness against them, not by the Event of Battel (the Appeal of Turks and
Pirates) but by a mighty influence upon our spirits, first opening our eyes, in some measure, to see the things that belong to our Peace, and then moving our hearts to pursue, as mediums thereunto, whole∣some and sound Principles; yet our restless ene∣mies are no whit discouraged, but rather their ma∣lice increases, in measure, as their hopes diminish. Had they Charity, Modesty, Prudence, or common sense, which (one would think) the universal tri∣umphs exprest, upon the accompt of very doubtful hopes, and general suffrage of such, as speak with∣out interest or design, might prompt unto them, it would either daunt their Presumption, or, at least, oblige them, seriously to consider, Whether any thing in this transitory world, collateral to our eter∣nall, and by experience, not necessary to our present happiness, is worth the purchasing with so much hazard to themselves, and ruine to others; but it seems, that having passed the Rubicon of honesty and discretion, they resolve either to perish them∣selves, or sack Rome. And now, perceiving, they can do no good their own way, they will do what mischief they are able, being thereto incited, by the two common enemies, (viz.) the Devil and the Jesuite, They see it is too vain for them to contend for the major Vote in Parliament, since they can scarce prevail in any, even the least Corporation; For the sober and moderate Party, excluding both extremes, (whether Fanatique Common-wealths-men, or Royal Hectors) doth now carry with it the sense of the people. Wherefore like Good Pilots, (if
free booters may deserve that stile) they have lear∣ned to tack about to the wind, to refine their gross pretences, and appear no more in their own diabo∣licall shape, but disguised habit of true Parliamen∣teers as if they had never prevaricated from their principles in the first Warre. They find, (no question) their own weaknesse, in not having any colour of reason, or shadow of Authority, No, not so much, as the Rump of a Pa∣liament, to countenance their Usurpations, The le∣gall and solemn dissolution of that, which could only give them a basis (though a very false and as they made, it rotten one,) having disappointed all their projects by turning the stream into the channel of free, and triennial elections; so as, now, they must begin the World anew. And are forced like broken Citizens in Cheapside, to set up an Alehouse, or Chandlers shop in the suburbs to seek out some new probability of shifting, and subsisting. The escape of Lambert wil not now avail them, He is in il condition to head a Faction that dares not see a Constable on English ground; The case is fairly altered, Law and possession, the City, Country and bet∣ter part of the Army now stand right, Scotland and Ireland are good seconds, our Government being in the hands of a Vigilant Counsell, our Forces both by Land and Sea under the Command of an invin∣cible Captain, The Nation concerned not only for its Liberty but its being; We are therefore I trust reasonably safe, from their batteries and assaults, but let us not think our selves secure from their un∣dermining. A Rogue by profession ought alwaies
to be suspected, For, if he cannot command your Purse, he will do the best he can to pick it. The moderate Presbyterian, and sober Royall Principle do manifestly divide almost the whole Nation between them: This hath the greater part of the Nobility and Gentry, that the Principal Cor∣porations: The sincere uniting, and incorporating of these two Parties, I look upon as a matter of such importance, that alone, it seeures and dissi∣pates all our fears, and renders us invincible not only to the Phanaticks, but probably (with Gods blessing) to any Invader. On the other side, their mutual discord (nay though it were but Jealousie) will be a brack, (and perhaps the only brack) in our Foundation: This indeed, may once more dash us in pieces; however, it will certainly dispose us to all those Dangers and Vicissitudes, which com∣monly attend those Governments, where the Facti∣ons are mighty, and equally poysed; the billows swelling so high, that scarce any Pilot can steer the Vessel to its Port, or come safely to an Anchor: In fine, this is like to give courage and opportunity to the Phanaticks; who, though I am confident, they can never settle themselves, may nevertheless long disquiet, and greatly torment us. Of this our Enemies (a subtle Generation) cannot but be highly sensible, it being so obvious to every capacity; And therefore their whole bu∣sinesse now is, as we Proverbially speak, to drive that nail that will goe: Herein consists the sum of all our fears, and their hopes; hitherto all their Jesuited Councels tend: And they presume they
shall neither want excellent Tools to work with, nor fitting matter to work upon: the Fuel, they suppose is not like Greenwood, which will not kin∣dle to any purpose, without long and industrious blowing the Coals; but rather like Charcoal, which being already half burned, is obnoxious almost to every spark: The memory of things past revived, and aggravated, the censure of things present, and evil presage of future, is the work they have to do. Their Instruments are the Extravagants on both sides, and none more then Cavaliers, whom they cunningly Cajole, by telling them, how much they preferre Episcopacy before Presbytery; how much they esteem them a Nobler Enemy, and had rather (if one they must choose) receive Lawes from them; that stately Elms are better then stinking Elders; that Charles Stuart (as they call him) is a goodly Cedar in respect of our late Shrubs: With many other the like Insinuations, tending only to heighten the pretences of that Party, (naturally apt to be too vain) and so to fatten them for the slaughter: To the Rigid Presbyterians, they speak in a different strain, (for the Saints, I must tell you, have learned of their great Master, to appear in divers shapes, like a fair Lady to Gallants, and a Capuchin to Bigotts,) I shall not here repeat their Malicious surmises and suggestions: Their late Venemous Newes from Bruxelles, The Alarm to the Army, Plain English, and other Pamphlets of the same tincture, will soon teach you their Lan∣guage, if you be not too honest to learn it.
The great Concernments, and indefatigable En∣deavours of this (now, God be thanked) Common Enemy, to sow the seeds of Discord amongst Bre∣thren, and thereby make way for our Ruine and their own Ends, (otherwise impossible to be com∣passed) should certainly convince us, that we ought, at least wise not our selves, to serve and further their Designs, but rather to trace the Serpent in his crooked motions, to countermine him in his under-ground workings; and at once wisely and generously resolve (however we may differ in Trifles and Circumstances, (which vari∣ance, doubtless, amongst men of Charity and Temper must needs either be easily reconciled, or innocently continued,) yet) alwayes to unite closely in the Main, that our strife prove but an Emulation, which of us for the future shall be the better Eng∣lish-men, (viz.) more modest in our Pretences, moderate in our Assertions, peaceable in our Con∣sultations, charitable in our Censures, & fervent only in reall Duties. To the furtherance of which bles∣sed Union, or, (as it may well be styled) benigne Constellation, there are many motives, (I think) as considerable, as the End propounded, (viz.) our Peace and Happinesse can render them. The example of your Adversaries summons you to doe that for prudence and self-preservation, which they do for Malice and Faction: They who have scarce any Doctrines wherein they agree, otherwise then as Foxes tayls, to burn our Corn, little Sobriety or Temper, but what their crafty Nature, shrewd Maxims, and Wordly experience
gives them, no means of Reconciliation, in case of disagreement, every one being his own Autho∣rity, his own Church, (as the name of Indepen∣dency it self imports,) They who could never com∣ply with any Establishment, but the very name of∣fends them; and when both the Peoples necessities, and their own, called aloud for somewhat of Settle∣ment, chose rather to rot and perish, then to have their Ulcers any way dressed; yet now all these consent, or rather combine, (and that very unani∣mously) against our Peace. Sir Henry Vane, and Sir Arthur Hazlerigge, Lambert and Scott, Rump, and Committee of safety, all on the suddain united in their hopes and endeavours, to ruine their Coun∣trey: Nay, most observable it is, that in the midst of their greatest Dissentions, (and Chaos it self (I think) had not greater) they were so tender of destroying, or but branding each other, (know∣ing, it seems, their Disease to be such, that Bleeding or Scarrifying would prove mortall to them) as if they had only played a Match at Foot-ball or Cud∣gells for the Dominion. Our Government was frequently altered without a broken Pate, or bloudy Nose: And those who should have been con∣demned as Notorious Usurpers, and Traytors, sca∣ped either under the notion of dissenting Brethren, or with the soft censure of Backsliders; so sensible they were of the necessity to connive at each others guilt: What a happinesse and security were it to the Nation, if Persons, in their Fundamentals sound and Orthodox, in their Professions I hope, sincere, could arrive but at half so much Candour
and Prudence, or that the men of this world were not much wiser in their generation, then Children of light. Matter of common principle directs and per∣swades you, as sober Assertors of the same Law, and Religion, to stand and fall together. It is the observation of your enemies (and a very true one) that you differ only gradu, not rê, you both subscribe, That the Majesty of Princes is inviolable, their Rights Divine, their Persons Sacred; The necessi∣ty of outward Mission, Decency, and Uniformity (if it may be) in Gods service: The Rights of the Ministery to their Tithes, by known Law and Sta∣tute, grounded upon ancient Piety and great Mora∣lity, are on both sides equally confest and main∣tained. These are the substance, me-thinks your Contentions about meer Rights and Circumstances should neither be great, nor long, especially, being so destructive to mutual happiness; me-thinks, mat∣ters might be compounded, by friendly Conference or Reference, both sides receding and meeting each other in the way to Peace, for such is the Rule of fair arbitrations; Me-thinks you should reflect, how little either of you hath advanced towards his desired ends, by long and ruinous Discord; you should see, and foresee, how little ground hath or will probably be gained, by pertinacy or animosity; You should examine, Whether it be not better now to secure your Consciences, Lives, and Laws, by a seasonable compliance with each other in matters not Essential, then seven, perhaps twenty years hence, after much innocent bloud vainly spilt, your
Estares diminished, your Countrey wasted, perhaps be subdued, and forced to buckle in all your Pre∣tensions, but at best, to purchase a most Un-christi∣an triumph, and a dear repentance even in Victory. You Cavaliers should remember, That could you oppress or destroy the Presbyterians (which you must never hope to effect) you would but weaken your own hands, pluck down your best fences, and even by your Conquest expose your selves, at least your Posterity, to meer Arbitrary Power, and Mar∣tial Law; a condition, which few of you, I trust, would impose, none of you, I am sure, would em∣brace. You Presbyterians should consider, That could you extirpate the Royall party (which is yet more impossible) you would let in the Phanaticks as a Torrent, to whom you lie very open and ob∣noxious, (viz.) to be beaten with all your own weapons, and confuted with the same Arguments (both in Civils and Spirituals) which your selves invented against the Royallists. Common Exigence, & Charity to your Countrey conjures you, to redress, if possible, her Grievances, ease her Burthens and Oppressions, redeem her Captivity, regulate her Confusions in Church and State, restore her lost Trade, and in some measure, relieve an incredible number of deserving Gentle∣men, and Noble Famelies, now perishing, of ho∣nest Citizens, now dayly breaking; of hopefull Scholars, now desparing of a bare livelihood. This cannot possibly be effected by the continuance of our Distractions, since Reason, and Experience in abundance may teach us, That Civil discord
is most destructive to Piety, Virtue, Learning, and Commerce; But, could we once more settle upon our true English bottome, we should then be young and lusty as the Eagle, our rust would soon look bright, our age renew, our bloud spring, our spirits revive; And as if there were a return of our Golden age, every one might, once more, sit securely under his own Vine; There might then again be Peace within our Wals, and Plenty in our Palaces; No leading into Captivity; No complaining in our streets; The blessed condition of that City which is at unity in it self, of that People, which hath the Lord for their God. Common Interest invites you Magistrates to be very strict and industrious; Subjects, in their seve∣rall Capacities, active to promote, however dis∣creetly passive, and cordially willing to embrace such wholesome Lawes, as are likeliest to establish Justice, and secure Property. To delight in broyles, is proper only for such, as either may hope to gain, but cannot fear to loose; or such as have enriched themselves by Fraud, or Rapine, and being now possest of Naboths Vineyard, imagine (perhaps not without cause) that our unsettlement is their best Protection: But you, whom I suppose in effect, to divide the legall Interest of your Countrey, the Lands justly descending, or fairly purchased, the Goods duely gotten, betwixt you, are certainly obliged to avoid Faction, as you would do Plunder or Sequestration; to endeavour a sober accommo∣dation of differences (if any should happen) as the title Paramount, by which you must hold your Estates.
Common danger, and necessity at once threa∣tens, and admonishes you to joyne your Counsels and Forces for mutuall preservation, as good ma∣riners and honest passengers effectually do, when the Vessel wherein they are altogether embarqued, is either distrest with a Storm, or assaulted by Pi∣rates. I have no design to aggravate your just fears and reall dangers, which doubtlesse are many and great, and to most of you (I presume) visible, onely let me beg of you to use your talent of Reason; to consult with the pillow of your Experience, to recol∣lect your fragments of History: which will all shew you your Condition, as in a faithfull Mirrour. And may I hope convince you; That God hath now set plenty and famine, Liberty and Thraldome, Life and Death before you, those the guerdons of your Moderation, and Obedience, these the inevitable Consequences of froward and peremptory dissenti∣on: That as on your right hand, you have a Land of promise, the throne of David, the pomp and great∣nesse of Solomon, Or, (to go no further for instance, then our own stage,) the blessings which from the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth, to the late unhappy Warre, this Nation, (unthankfuly I fear) enjoyed. whilst all her Neighbours envied, so on your left stands a vast Wildernesse, The defection of Je∣roboam, The Usurpations of Samaria, the sediti∣ons of the Gracchi, the Conspiracie of Catiline, the Proscriptions of Scilla, the Oligarchy of Athens, and perhaps at last, Monarchy with a vengeance, in the person of Caligula, or Nero; Rump and Bare∣bones, Levellers and Saints rampant, Jack straw,
and Watt Tylar, Knipperdoling and John of Ley∣den are at your elbowes, make your election at your perill. The difficulty, or rather (I hope) impossibillity for any single party (as a Party) to gain, much more to hold the power of dictating to the Nation, should dispose you to the study of Universall inte∣rests, (our present Elyxir) to an enquiry for such Expedients and temperaments in Policy as in them∣selves, are only safe, or durable, and surely after long hostility most seasonable. The baits of faction are now God be thanked all grown stale, The net is now vainly spread in the sight of the Bird; Rooks and Daws have both learned to smell Gunpowder at a reasonable distance, The Foxe of sanctyfied imposture hath been hunted out of all his retreats. And the fury of usurpation pursued, as it were from bogge to bogge; The fiend hath appeared in all his guises and hath not a Vizour left which we are not acquainted with. Neither is there (one would think) fuell for a new flame, either in our Spirirs or Purses; Those being with long sicknesse, and much weariness composed and framed I trust to Sobriety and Caution, These so exhausted, that we are scarce able to pay our present Taxes; We have, (God knows) little plate left to carry to Guild-Hall, we cannot spare another fifth and twentieth part, Vast loans, or Benevolencies, And fifty Subsidyes at once; Publique Faith will furnish a Faction but with slender summs, its credit being much dispara∣ged, by what is past and more suspected for the future, so as there is little danger unless meer wan∣tonness
should again make us to swagger, or our Monies burning (as we speak proverbially) in our pockets, for want of other vent, send us to buy saddles, Buff-Coats, and gaudy Feathers, &c. who, I take it, have, by this time, discovered, that there is more use of bread, then Ammunition, of cloa∣thing, then harnesse. Fears and jealousies must be re∣al ones, if they much alarm us; It must appear to be indeed Gods own cause, before we shall again stir to propagate, or perhaps defend it, The Oath of a Tribune or word of a Vicar wil not be taken in mat∣ters of the highest Concernment, either spirituall or civill, If the Preacher summon us to our Tents we shall be apt to enquire Quo warranto; How he came by his Trumpet, whether he found his Doct∣rine in his text, or coyned it in his fancy; Whe∣ther Scripture and Antiquity: Or some very ino∣dern Father, (I will not say, Pamphleteere) furni∣shed him with his Arguments and proofs; Let it, I pray be added, that even our Confusion may in this particnlar turn to our Advantage: For being di∣stracted as we are with such a Variety of Judg∣ments and Interests which can never agree, but in the Negative, and will certainly all joine against any engrosser of Dominion, that party which shall so usurp, will stand as a Butt, to empty the Quiver, A meer Ishmaell defying, and defyed by all men. The easiness of obtaining quiet, should encourage you to seek a little for that Jewel, which (me-thinks) you cannot choose bnt find, it lies so plainly in your view, God I know theauthor of al peace, is chiefly to
be consulted and invoked by Prayer, that he would open our eys, encline our hearts, and blesse ourende∣vours, but then we must come with sincere minds and not as St. Augustine most ingeniously confesses of himself that he prayed indeed devoutly against his Lusts, but withall, secretly wished that God would not hear him; The truth is, our peace is not farre off, if we do not thrust it from us, it is nigh at hand, nay it is within us Self deniall, Integrity with∣out a worldly Byasse, the Christian duties of forgi∣ving, and bearing with, each others infirmity, Wari∣nesse in affirming, Charity in judging, Modesty in de∣manding, Meeknesse in receding, these are our sure and certain guides in the way to Settlement; Eve∣ry faction would have Peace its own way, All pro∣fesse to welcome it. But few that I hear, will meet it; For whatsoever they find to be most profita∣ble or honourable or secure for themselves, that they are apt to propound, as effectuall, and Funda∣mentall to our Peace; Not to instance too parti∣cularly, sure I am, that the being of the Church, and well being of the Nation doth not consist in all those appurtenances, which some would obtrude, as necessary; Many of them, perhaps, are very commendable and expedient, if they may be procu∣red without evident hazard of incurring mischiefs, farre more considerable for the present, then their convenience; For gold may be dear bought, And that Vniformity will cost too much, which is pur∣chased with losse or danger of Vnity: When a sure foundation is first layd, It will then be time to build magnificently, and to contrive not only for
meer use, but Ornament and Accommodation. Till then all sides should learn to content themselves, with that which may, or rather, must be, and not vainly expect that which never can be or at least cannot now; Wherein much experience and some descretion would advise them, not to hunt too ea∣gerly, or quest too loud upon every scent, since yielding may prevail where stubbornesse never shal: Were this Principle and Spirit infused into our Pa∣triots, it were already a fair and hopefull progresse in their great work, for the differences which for the most part appear to be more in the skirts then hody of our Religion or Government, would most of them be soon accorded, and the rest vanish of themselves; Or if any should yet remain, the Au∣thority of a Parliament duely constituted, is a Ju∣dicature in this Nation, without exception or appeal worthy to command, if not our Active, yet at least our Passive Obedience; A Guardian, in whose cu∣stody, I am sure our Liberties, and I hope, our Con∣sciences are very safe. The zeal of your Religion should provoke you to bestir your selves, in a time of great need, and quit∣ting your punctilo's, to intend the main; You all alike professe to be sincere Protestants, and some of you Zealots to a kind of transportation, so as to scorne Peace, where you think truth is, unless both consist, concerned more especially, tender you have alwaies been in your bowels, large in your bounty, se∣dulous in your Correspondence, forward in your Assi∣stance towards the Evangelicall Churches in foraign parts, when oppressed, or but threatned with any per∣secution;
Upon this account, our late Princes have, at the requests of their Parliaments and people free∣ly and frequently engaged themselves both in Wars, and Treaties, sometimes espousing their Quarrell, sometimes compromising it for them, especially the French Protestants, on whose behalf our Kings have long stood both as Champions of their Liberty, and sureties for their good behaviour; And indeed without our interposing, they must needs have been long since swallowed up by their mighty Foes; Their adversary, besides the inequality of Forces, having this great advantage, that he was their un∣doubted Soveraign; You cannot but hear what Monstrous Counsells are now hatching at Rome, what ominous beginnings there are in France, all grounded upon this presumption, That England hath other fish to fry; And that the work may be dispatched before we are at leasure to look abroad; Our Phanaticks, they, I think, are, a gagge in our mouthes, a Remora, to our Carreere, (I wish we find no other Obstructions,) were we once setled, Rome would soon desist, and France perhaps be made re∣pent; But whilst our divisions continue, we must not hope to maintain our outworks, nor I fear, de∣fend our Walls, against enemies so powerfull, and lately so united by their General peace which, in all probability, may soon ferment into a Catholique League. Lastly, Your common duty, above all, obliges you, (And that, not for Wrath, but Conscience, sake) if you must contend, That it be not for Dominion, but Loyalty, not with strife, but honest emalation
You of the Cavalier Party (who pretend to a kind of Primogeniture) shew now, that you are true, not only to the Person and Authority, but to the Interest of your Master, for which you are ready (if need be) to sacrifice your own: That you are Royallists not for Faction, but pure Allegiance, and could be content to follow those Ensignes, with∣out such considerations, as sway only with Merce∣naries: That your bleeding Countrey hath some in∣terest in you, as well as your banished Prince, and that your Loyalty hath not devoured your Charity; Confute, in Gods name, their Calumnies, who dayly represent you, as Persons, whom nothing can please, but meer Tyranny, to have a Grand-Seignour for your Prince, you his Janissaries; The Nation, at his mercy, and your feet; Men so contracted in your principles, and fettered with Jure Divino's, that no Jus humanum may be admitted, or once mentioned. You Presbyterians, who (by the voice of the people, in most Counties declining you) may perceive, That virtue is gone out of you; and that you suffer not a little in your Repu∣tation, upon former accounts; If your own Con∣sciences shall (as perhaps they may) second here∣in the votes of your Countrey-men; Now that it is in your power not only to make amends, but me∣rit, Pay all your arrears of Virtue and Loyalty, to∣gether with those vows of Truth, Justice, and Mo∣desty which I am confident you have often made in your late Extremities; Wipe of all those staines at once, that for the present may seem to blemish those virtues, which in many of you are very Emi∣nent,
and would shine bright, if these Cloudes were once dispelled; Your aftergame is very good. The Law is now in your hands, and to you must be ac∣knowledged the chief honour of relieving your Country in its great distresse, when alas, a Royallist could not hold up his hand, except it were at the Barre; Proceed, therefore generously and undaun∣tedly in the performance of your own Duties, and maintenance of our Liberties, Be still good Subjects, and good Citizens, Christians, and Englishmen, let your stoutnesse marry your Allegiance, and your Interest be subordinate to them both; Above all, let your moderation appear to all men, and be con∣fident, that in so doing, your Countrey will bail you, and the Nation will be concerned not only in Gra∣titude but real Sympathy, that not any of those dan∣gers which the Phanaticks suggest, shall befall you, nor a hair of your head perish. THE END.
