least had ere experienced it by Sea or Land, so restless was this renowned Heroe now famed throughout the world for brave Archievements, that he continually exclaimed, against inglorious ease, and like young Casar, smiled at clashing Arms, and took de∣light to hear the Warlike Trumpets sound: these were his insant Practises, but when to manly stature grown, each moment scamed an Age, till he found an opportunity to try his Force, and curb his proud insulting Fe, which then began to brave at on British Seas, and by usurpation to hinder and ingross our Traffick abroad in Forrain parts I mean the haughty Dutch, who had not long beiore for the like insolencies felt our scourge, yet bold in their presumption▪ proceeded on to brave the English Arms and put affronts on the Commander of the Seas, for which they could expect no Iess then War; which by the Royal Power was thought sit to be denounced, in which our sar renowned Heroe, was no ways wanting to put forward his He∣roick order, but in the well riged Fleet, which ploughed in Tryumph the Surface of the Auzi or deep, whilse the North-Winds, were out of Breath, in filling the wide swelling fails and streamers like Comeres reflected the Sun-Beams back into the Clouds) he set out his Royal Highness, then being Admiral, long they had not sailed ere Fortune was so favourable as with a forewind to bring them in sight of the Enemy, which much rejoyced the Noble Earl as well hoping now he should Face Battel in its dreadfullest shape, and try the temper of his Warlike Soul, still thru∣sting ofter Glory, noe fearing what the danger was, so for his King and Country under∣taken imitating in that his Noble Ancestors, who long have been sustainers of the British Monarchy, and for their eminent Loyalty, deserved to be remembred to after A∣ges, &c. The Wind being favourable at South-West, the English tacked about, and Couragi∣ously bore down upon the Enemy; the Earl being in a Circle or half point of the Spua∣dron, in a first rate Vessel: after the signal was given to ingage, in the height of En∣glesh Gallantry, and to his immortal Fame, he turned destruction on the shrinking Foe, and with Terrestrial Thunder loud charged through and through their broaken Fleet; whilst nothing but Ruins, Death and flaming Bulks surrounded him, against which he let Volleys that sent them smoaking into the Murmering deep, which bubled up the long confused Noise: nor was he slack to succour and relieve all parts, that were any ways destressed, hazarding himself to all the Advantages the Enemy could wish, to whom at last he proved so Terrible, that being known they dreaded him like Death, and from his Engine Belching sire, and Iron Globes on either hand with-drew, not daring for to stand the fatal stroak, for the meanest Sailor Animated by his Lordships Example laughed at Death, and then contemned his utmost Rage; being more feirce and daring in the month of slaughter, not declining till the Dutch infinitely worsted, broken on all sides, Burnt and disordered hoisted up their Sails, and fled all that were able to make Sail, but such as were disabled in the Fight they left behind. Not dareing longer to defend them they thus beaten and routed: the Heroick Earl as the true Insignia of true Nobleness, Modestly, excused the well deserved Praises that were heaped upon him: the which mildness begot more Applause, nor was same her self neglectful to Trumpet forth Vallorous Exploites, and into the utmost Corner of this British Isle and farther: so prospered his Youthful undertakings that Fortune durst not frown upon his blooming greatness, but was obleiged to comply. He having thus experienced War, grew still more eager for his Princes and Countryes sake to prosecute the same: And like to Caesar looking on great Alexanders Statue, Cry∣ed I have done nothing yet thats worthy of my Birth: so mild was the great Warriour dread in Arms, and and free from that Vain-Glory that success does raise: In the Igno∣ble Breast, that he hated slatery not suffring his Praises to be repeated in his presence, the which denoted him to be Worthy of so Renowned and Vertuous a Father, to which his Filial Obedience and Love had made him Dear.
Not long after in a second Engagement, as disdaining sloth, he resolving for to try the utmost Force of War, or so to quell the daring Foe, that they should presume no more to Lord it on the Briny Seas, he slood much like a Bulwork, and himself esist∣ed Derutters Force, and with Fire and Smoak that darkeneed the  of day, drove his whole Squadron back; whilst himself upon the Deck  glitter∣ing Sword, whilst Shot like Hail sung round his Head, and  each hand barrocaded up his way. There by him such wonders were  ad∣mired his noble Resolutich, so that it was greatly thought  day to us through his brave resistance and couragious Animating the  on to force Enemies out-strrched line, and with Vollies leand, and  make them scatter over the wide Oceae, glad to escape under the sheltring Coverture of sable night, but notwithour great hazard and loss, fifteen of their Ships being fired sunk and taken, and about five thousand of their ablest Seamen slain and made Prisoners, so For∣tune and Victory conspired to raise the noble Warriour to the pitch of greathess and Renown, that wherelere he fought they still were emelous for his preservation, and srove to confer their favours upon him, wreathing his Warlike Brow with Lawrel or triumphant Bays. After the heat of these Wars were passified, by the submissions of the Conquered Fos; and Peace was mutually concluded his Honour. Returning from on Bard his hearing Castle in which he had taken so much Delight, for some time resi∣ded at Court with a universal applause; but could not content himself with the glit∣tering Pleasures and Delights that are still attendants there; his Soul was Still intent on Arms, and desire of military Discipline; no Musick sounded more pleasant in his Ear than to hear Heroick Actions told; for like thy Carthagenian Prince, he was in all parts formed for brave Designs, and from his Infancy promised all the noble Virtues that adorn mankind to make him most accomplished: But to the purpose. long had not he rested before another War broke out more cruel than the former our Navy joyning with the power of France against the yet testy Dutch; which both by land and Sea he be∣haved himself with the like bravery of Spirit and Gallantry as in the former to the purchasing immortal Fame, but here behold a sudden alteration changed the Face of grand Affairs, for the persidious French breaking Articles of League Offensive and de∣fensive, they had made with us upon the second submission of the Dutch, his Majesty in pitty to their distress, the French having besieged as it were in most of their Provin∣ces and taken several of their chief Towns, granted many English, Scotch, and Irish Forces to bear Arms there under his own Commission, whereupon many of our Nobi∣lity was pleased to favour them with thoir Heroick Conducts against that Sword which before like a Disease did Rage, of which his Lordship being one, who commanded a Re∣giment of well Disciplin'd Souldiers, with whom he so bravely behaved himself in all his Conducts as gained him an esteem most honourable, so curteous and benign kind, that he won each heart, the darling Delight of his Friends, and terror of his Foes, who dreaded him even to death, as knowing where his Arms ingaged, he stood not dal∣lying, but like a Whirlwind roaled Destruction round him, crying press on to Victo∣ry. So gallantly did he behave himself in the succor and Relief of several destressed Towns and Cities that the French Armies then were firing, And when great Luxem∣burgh besieged the famous Town of Mons the pride of all the Netherlands, the Dutch and Spanish Armies under the Command of his Highness the Prince of Orange, not da∣ring to venture the attempt of its Relief till animated by his Lordship and several others of the noble English Commanders, who Charging the main Battalions of the French routed them on every side, mowing as it were with a Whirlwind swiftness so that they made way no longer daring to resist, his Lordship at the head of his Regiment undanted standing, received the first Charge of the enemies Right Wing, and with such Cou∣rage repelled their Force, that the Horse were disordered, and immediately gave ground he pursuing them till they sinding no place to retire, broke into the Ranks of the Wal∣loons, and so put them into Confusion, nor did he desist, though the Shot slew thick on every side, and dreadful Mars raged throughout the Field, and the slain on every hand beshrewed the place, whilst Victory turning her blood-shot eyes upon the dreadful Battel, great and perillous, and clapped her joyful Wings, whilst the pursuing English
through the bloody Field drove the Fugitives, sole Victory re∣maining on their side Uere the Heroick Ossory won such praise, as will immortalize his Fame, till time shall be no more. War here ceasing and mild Peace ensuing, his Lordship lest those For∣reign Climes, and laying down his dreadful Arms so fear'd and so renowned in Europe, he returned to honour this thrice happy Isle; where, and with his Father of ever worthy remembrance, now Lord Lieutenant of the Kingdom of Ireland, there not be∣ing any business of Wa to employ his Honour in, till of late, the barbarous Moors invading that Famous Garrison of Tangiers, which advances the English Ensigns into the main Land of Af∣frick, and in spite of those innumerable Foes has desended so long our Honours, and Commanding far into the Ocean, and on Land curbed their insolencies, till of late having increased in Force and Pollicies, they had made great advances on the Forts and Outworks, but having the preparations, that were made from England, and the terror of great Ossories renowned Name, he being to Command the Warlike Forces, the Alcade, Captain General of the Moors Horse and Foot sent to offer Peace, but his Lordship having all things on Board in Order to his Voyage, on an unhappy day fell sick of a Feavour, and after eight or nine days Languishing died, which was on the 30th of July last, to the great Grief of all true loyal English Men, who cannot but be sensible of the fall of such a Pillar, whose Arm has wrought such wonders for his Country, and his Heroick Vertues promi∣sing greater, had not Death bereaved us of him in the prime of all his Blooming Glories. FINIS.
