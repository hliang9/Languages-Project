To the FAVOURABLE READER. TO write of modern men, is a troublesome businesse; all men commit errours, few having committed them, will hear thereof; one must or flatter them, or say nothing; to Com∣ment upon their actions, is to endeavour to teach more by a mans own example, than by that of others; more to him that writes then to him that reades; more to be silent then to be active: Flatterers have yet moreover so exalted their good deeds, that the naked truth redounds to the blame of the Relator; for the truth of that which is heard, comes short of that which is believed; and some there are who arrive at that height, as they leave no place for flattery, fancying themselves grea∣ter then flattery can make them. In the beginning of Government, every small authority seems great; in the continuance thereof, however great it be, it seems little; whence it proceeds, that in time, that Ma∣gistrate is not endured, which was too greedily (at first) created, or desired. Liberty and Principality are incompatible, they meet not to∣gether, or if they do, they last not; every own seeks his own perfe∣ction, which depending upon the destruction of another, they seek it there; to live quietly, it behoves either to be totally free, or totally tyed to servitude: To conquer Princes, and not know how to make the victory beneficiall; to win the people, and not know how to keep them in subjection; is a losse of men and time: Providence is necessary, and 'tis laborious. To captivate mens mindes with rewards is impossible; servitude cannot be rewarded with any other recompence, then being set at liberty: To tye them by an Oath is no way safe; they are not subjects, whose power is onely subject to will; Liberty is naturall, ser∣vitude violent; what is violent needs somewhat, which from without may withstand it, if its beginning be not occasioned from some internall
cause. This alteration of Government is performed with very great la∣bour and difficulty to the undertakers thereof, and with, the either great patience, or murmurings of the people, who are passive therein. But I dare divine, and can assure poor England, that the glorious omnipotency of Heaven seems very favourable unto her, and gives great hopes (after some few distractions abroad composed) that all her tax∣es shall be withdrawn, and (for the future) be no further burthened with oppressions, or payments; during which continuation, we are not masters of our own fortunes, and so live not at home: And therefore seeing that the purchasers of our Liberty, have many difficulties to at∣tend their motion, I heartily implore all true Englishment, as one man, to unite their hearts, their prayers, their forces, and purses, unanimously for defence of this Commonwealth and Authority now esta∣blished; and by conforming thereunto, we shall quell hoth the insult∣ing French, the proud Spaniard, and all other Enemies to Eng∣lands peace and tranquility, throughout the world; and by degrees, we shall attain to a most excellent and accomplished Government. But before we shall absolutely enjoy this happinesse, we must undergo some troubles, meet with many stumbling-blocks, and endure many a cruell storm, yet let this be our comfort, God will deliver his people out of the hands of their enemies, and settle peace in the habitati∣ons of those that put their trust in him. Reader, I am doubtfull I have detain'd thee too long (in Epistolizing) from what I promised thee in my Title page; for which I desire thy pardon, intreating thee to accept of the weak and imperfect labours of Thy friend, M. A.
MERLINƲS ANGLICƲS, OR, AN ENGLISH MERLIN: Prophetically fore-telling, The most eminent things that shall happen, in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, this present Year, 1650. May's Astrologicall Predictions. THis Moneth produces matters of great concernment; the actions will be emi∣nent in the Kingdom of Ireland, and un∣to the perpetuall honour of the English Nation: Great fortune at tends the English Heroes (notwithstanding the treacherous designes of their Enemies, and others) and some desperate as∣saults are attempted, wherein God makes it appear by some sequell victory or action, that he loves the faithfull Patriots of England, by giving conquest and triumph to their Armies in Ireland: A totall subdu∣ing of the barbarous Irish appears visible towards the close of this Moneth; but great sicknesse and unna∣turall
diseases seems too brief within our Camp, oc∣casioned by some treacherous neglect from England. Self ends appear visible within our English territo∣ries, intemperate disputes, and civill broyls are much feared, and the spirits of divers Monarchicall creatures, are exceedingly enraged and enflamed, throughout the West and Northern Counties; but a Southern cordiall will speedily be administred, to a∣bate the heat and fury thereof: Great rumours this Moneth of a Forraign invasion, but providence, and vigilancy, retards the landing of the States enemy. Here arrives news, as if the wavering Scot were en∣tering league or friendship, but whether with us to deceive us, or with our enemies to annoy us, time will manifest; it's believed to the contrary: For if an agreement be not concluded, between their King and the Grandees; (with good provision and security for the Commonalty) the whole land is divided, and their distractions will exceedingly encrease; a Thistle be∣longing to the Royall branch (as they say) aspires high in the North of that Kingdom, but the English Rose once appearing, strikes a suddain blast to her piercing and prickling blossomes. Junes Astrologicall Predictions. GReat are the consultations and disputes of the Commonalty of England this Moneth, who fixing their eyes Northward, discern the Scot to be highly elevated, by reason of his great confidence, or uncer∣tain assurance, of aid and assistance from Denmark,
France, and other places, to annoy us; yea, and the state of all Europe is guided likewise with most strange and improvident advisers; and a sullen murmuring people within our own Territories, seems to swell with inveterate conceptions, acting and contriving desolation and ruine to the supream Authority of the Nation; and many poysoned darts will also flye from the quiver of invective spirits, wounding and pier∣cing the honour of some worthy Patriots, who for∣merly seemed as Oracles to the people, free from cor∣ruption either in Office or bribery: [Oh a lusty purge for these diabolicall creatures, who under the spetious pre∣tences of restauration of liberty, do endeavour the involving of us into endlesse misery.] But if the Commonalty be∣gin now to be angry, their blowes will fall exceeding heavie, and wo be unto those who shall move them to wrath, by dis-franchising them of their late pur∣chased liberty, and endeavour their involving once again in new commotions and troubles; great ruine attends the Dane, and all other who are interessed in his designe, against the Inhabitants of this Common∣wealth: Distractions grow great in severall parts of the Nation, through want of the Engine and smew of Warre, but by the great vigilancy of our prudent Rulers, their wants are supplied, and their discon∣tents most happily allayed and pacified. Rich men look to your purses, a purge is now preparing, but [indeed] it will be a very favourable and pleasant one. The close of this Moneth produceth great hap∣pinesse to the laborious husbandman, his heavy taxes being much abated, and their weighty burthens in a great measure removed. Ireland cries out this Moneth for moneys and provision, and many there are who
endeavour the retarding thereof, and withdraw their helping hand from the propagating of so great a work; but let them all be anathematized (who shall appear instrumentall therein) to future generations and posterities: Great commotions and distractions (throughout all parts of the world) attends the close of this Moneth; But a wofull rising seems to threaten the Turk, even from Constantinople the allarm shall be given, which will eccho through most of his confines and territories, insomuch, that the industrious Ve∣netian, appears full of action, and will free themselves from slavery in the Island of Candy, firing and taking most of the Turkish Gallies, which lye as Pirates and Robbers, to massacre and enslave the Christians. July's Astrologicall Predictions. THis Moneth produceth great action, both by Sea and Land; especially upon the Coast of Britain, Scotland, Sweden, and Holland; the English Mariners seems both stout and resolute, triumphantly sailing with their slags of defiance, and scorning to strike sail to the proudest enemy that flotes upon the Ocean: Some desperate engagements happen between them, and the French rovers, little quarter given, but revenge repaid, for their former abuses to the poor English Merchants. Sir George Askue (the Summers darling) and the undanted Generals, Blake, Dean, and Popham, in few days will cleer the English Channell, and not so much as a French Rover, or Irish Pyrate, will dare appear on our Coast; so that free trade and commerce will not
in the least be hindered or retarded; which makes the Merchant, and the rest of the Manufacture-Adventu∣rers to smile, returning thanks, and presenting gratui∣ties for this great priviledge. Some action in the Nor∣thern Climate, both by Sea and Land; for assuredly the Scot hath a great desire to be troublesom, and once again to bee stript and whipt, and sent to forraign plantations: The seasonable temperature of the wea∣ther this Moneth, invites the English Army in Ireland to great action, a great blow threatens their enemy, but not without some losse; for by reason of some perfideous spirits, he takes great advantage, and seems very resolute and sturdy; many conspirators hold jugling consultations, and greatly 'tis to be feared, there will be some conspiracies in England; yea, among some, whom the people have entrusted, and prefer'd to great Office and dignity; but like faithfull Patriots, others of the Trustees, and Keepers of our Liberties, carry on the work designed by the omnipotent Jehovah, for perpetuity, his glory, and our comforts. Augusts Astrologicall Predictions. MAny various reports are eccho'd up and down, in severall parts of our Nation [this Moneth] as if the entrance of an Army amongst us were to be feared, and that an in-road will be made by Jockey, together with the Danes, French, and other forraign∣ers: Do not attempt our harm, you of the Scottish Faith, for sharp effects from the conjunction of Mars, doth presage and threaten a dismall wo, not only
within the English territories, or your confines, but also all over Europe, [where ye shall reside.] Some great ones amongst us endeavour to foment new dif∣ferences, and to corrupt the souldiery, but notwith∣standing their severall temptations, little will be ef∣fected; and as to the government of the English af∣fairs now on foot, it seems not at a losse, but in a good posture or condition, though infinite and mani∣fold treacherous plots are consulted of, to destroy the frame of Government now extant, its authority and Majesty, and the Rulers of us thereby; yea, the whole Nation it self (if possible;) the influence whereof, produceth sad effects to the conspirators; and if mercy be not shewed in the midst of Justice, its feared the bright Axe will be died of a skarlet hue: The Presbyterian seems angry, and much displeased with the present authority, and many invective spee∣ches will proceed from those, who formerly shined like glorious Lights amongst us, having performed wonderfull actions for the service of this Common∣wealth; but notwithstanding this their change, and perverting of their purer judgements, I heartily wish, that the State of England, may look upon their for∣mer merits, and say, as Solomon, upon the failings of Abiathar; Because you, from the very beginnings of our troubles, have suffered with us, fought for us, and now onely unfortunately have erred, and receded from your former obedience, be you forgi∣ven of God, we remit this your casuall trespasse.
Septembers Astrologicall Predictions. SOme pestilent broyls, or unparalell'd results, give cause of fear to our Governours, but a few dayes patience promises a comfortable composure: Lift up your heads, you English Cedars, and faithfull Commoners be not sad; the unchangeable decrees of Eternall providence, have well provided for your ease; although some discord and contention, may for a time seem to discontent us, by reason of some asto∣nishment arising from the Citizens of London, and great disputes happening between party and party; but the sufferings of this Nation are almost quite o∣ver, and I could wish the like in Ireland; but it seems there is much to be done, some money and mens lives to be spent; but I hope all those who are lovers of Religion, liberty and freedome, will most willingly lend their helping hand, for their relief and assistance. Alas! poor England cannot expect safety without a full conquest of Ireland, which I positively affirm, we shall subdue this year, the severall positions of hea∣ven promising us no lesse then victory, and the Irish downfall: But the sooner wee send men, monies, clothes, and necessaries, the more will be our glo∣ry, and our brethrens comfort: I wish a generation of our own at home, fail not herein.
Octobers Astrologicall Predictions. I Reland is sensible of the actions of this Moneth, in one kinde or other, but probably in the worser sense; the souldiery seems very weary, by reason of some unseasonable weather, and the searcity of bread and provisions; but its in vain [O Ireland] to resist that over-ruling providence, which by the mercy of God attends the English consultations: Divers of the Irish Nobility, begin to desert any further engage∣ment with England, and many of them flye into other Countries for relief and succour: The sick Scot is still lurking to take advantage; but him we need not fear, though assisted with the Dane, who is preparing for our annnoyance this Summer: The Swede we shall not finde our friend, nor doth the German Emperour and the Princes of Germany, favour this Government: The French have already, do still, and will hereafter abuse us for a while; but the edge of their fury will within few Moneths bee taken off, and great will bee their commotions, the commonalty endeavouring to cast off Monarchy; and an invitation is upon a near arri∣vall to England, for the purchasing of liberty. The close of this Moneth produceth good effects from the Clergy, and those Divines who for many precedent Moneths walked very averse in judgment, begin now to hold a mutuall correspondency in Doctrine, and a good understanding and concurrence, is with great joy, alacrity, and amity, assented to.
November's Astrologicall Predictions. SOme of our English Trustees begin now to soar high, having by their great Offices enriched their estates, and filled their purses; which causeth the Com∣munalty to swell with anger, and their spirits to boil with indignation, and seriously to commune one with another, and questioning each others judgments, why they made no better a choise; but they are pacified for a while, having fair hopes of bettering their con∣dition in the future. Let us hope well after all our sufferings, there is some probability either of curing, or lopping off such diseased branches of the Common∣wealth, as have glutted themselves with the peoples ruine and impoverishment. About this time there a∣riseth great changes in France, and without doubt ei∣ther a new molding of men, or just examination of some Parliamentary matters. We shall have rumours of Wars, and hear of preparations of Armies in seve∣rall parts of Europe; but the English Statists shall pre∣pare the greatest Fleet for Sea, and the best Army for Land, that ever was seen in these parts; for the Eng∣lish will bee reputed so despicable a people, in most parts of Europe, that the State will be forced to stand upon their guard, both by Sea and land, and they will so discreetly manage their affairs, that the greatest and wisest Polititians, with all their might and power, shall not be able to annoy us, or set footing within our Territories.
December's Astrologicall Predictions. THe year is now ending, but the great murmurings of the people not yet brought to a period, but time by degrees may better inform their judgements: A sad government which people neither fear nor ap∣prove of, but as necessitated: Great are the complaints of the people to the Parliament, against publike Of∣ficers, who have sought their own interests, and ser∣ved their own turns with the publike treasure. Were a full liberty granted, which [perhaps] may be, the Commonwealth knows who to question, and where to finde monies. Something near or about this time, a capitall punishment is threatned: No admonition or judgment will serve some of those who have quick∣ned and excited our differences; it's possible the just hand of God may finde out some of them miraculous∣ly, and suffer the execution of justice to be inflicted on them; at which time, the Communalty will smile, and not cease from petitioning that justice may flow in its proper current, and not be perverted either with bribery or partiality. January's Astrologicall Predictions. 1651. GAllant things are in agitation this Moneth, the beginning of which produceth large disputes: Our Representatives proceed with great alacrity for the easing of the Communalty of their Assessements, and heavie burthens, and tenderly now consider, how they may be taken off, and much lessened or abated: Little action this Moneth, words being more predo∣minant then blowes; yet a few discontented spirits,
seem to begin the year with mutinous paradoxes, and would attempt against our State and Government, which will continue, if they derogate not from their true and lawfull principles. February's Astrologicall Predictions. A Melodious harmony sounds pleasantly in the ears of Englands Libertines this Moneth; whose painfull endeavours are now studious, how to pre∣sent their gratifications of love, unto such as have supported them and the Kingdomes cause, with ha∣zarding their lives, fortunes, and estates: The Lon∣doners and divers others, do now unfeignedly make a recantation of their former disobedience; who having tasted of the sweet fruits, which our Representatives have with so great hazard and pains reaped, begin now to rellish the vertue of their proceedings, and and resolve to walk obediently in all just and lawfull ways, which they are required or commanded to; And although there is a portent of division amongst some few great ones, yet the God of peace can convert some absurd mistakes into a better temper then open hostility or publike defiance. March's Astrologicall Predictions. BY the Conjunction of severall Planets, this Mo∣neth produceth good effects, and our long desi∣red Peace, seems now firmly established: Severall
Agents and Embassadours from forraign Potentates arrive here near these times, desiring unity between their Masters and our Representatives; The Gover∣nours of forraign Plantations, desire to live under the protection of our English State: The French seems a little troublesom, notwithstanding his ill successe the last year, and the Danes would be with us, but dare not. Some new commotions in Scotland, by discon∣tented spirits, for advance of Monarchy, but all in vain. The Presbyters in England, receive a generall change, and endeavour nothing more, then the preser∣vation of their peace and liberty, and frustrating the malign designes of the adverse party. April's Astrologicall Predictions. OUr English spirits soar high; the souldiery are resolute and undanted, and in so good a posture, that no enemy can annoy us: The Hollander is very active, making great preparations for Sea; what their designe is, time will suddainly discover; they are a subtle self-ended people, and it behoves England be∣ing so near a neighbour diligently to attend their mo∣tion: The Scots begin to desist from playing fast and loose any longer, and (in some measure) to con∣ceive aright of our present Government and Authori∣ty, who in its purity, is like to continue many Gene∣rations: And I am confident, all true Englishmen, and lovers of their Countries freedom, will generally unite, and endeavour (for the future) the preser∣vation and safety of this Commonwealth wherein they live. FINIS.
