A FOOLE Answered according to his FOLLY. OR, JUDAS in joyning to the Chiefe Priests, to betray the Lamb, hath hang'd himselfe; plainly seen in an answer to GEORGE EMMOT of Durham, and his Northerne blast. Wherein is clearly discovered, a designe of the envious gene∣ration of Romish Priests, and unclean people, to render the truth odious, under the name of Popery. Who the better to bring their end about, have layed open their own shame: but are proved the Papists themselves, and their foundation and forme of worship to be from the Pope, contrary to the forme of godlinesse, and the Saints practice, a the Scripture shall witnesse. So the whore to defile others hath laid open her own skirts; A sufficient warning to all that love their souls, to see to their foundation, and standing; and fly her filthy aluring language and practice, and prove their foundation by the life of the Saints, before they build thereon. Into the pit she hath digged is shee fallen, and the truth cleared; This is the Lords doing, who for the name of his glory hath prepared a defence; Therefore in the Lord will we make mention of thy name for ever.

A Foole answered according to his Folly. OR, Judas in joyning to the Chief Priests, to betray the Lamb hath hang'd himselfe: plainly seen in an answer to GEORGE EMMOT of Dur∣ham, and his Northern blast. TO thee George Emmot, and the rest of thy confedracy, who calls thy selfe a Gntileman, for a Jew thou art not, nor of that seed, as plainly thou hast shewed thy selfe in thy writing, who hath manifested thy selfe a Heathen before all men, and they confusion; for in thy E∣pistle thou sayest, it was the case of thy speciall friend, which he promiscuously declared and imparted to thee in private, which thou hast endeavoured methodically to put in order, and here in confedracy is seene, and then ownes it with thy name subscribed, as thy own case; and sayes thou wast a brother amongst us, but thy brotherhood wee deny, and all thy filthy practice; who as thou confesseth art fallen from the Gospel love through a self end, thwar∣ting and overthwarting the Gospel precepts, beleeving no∣thing though never so true, but what thy owne private spirit, though never so false, did move thee to; following dreams and fancies, and the proud and lofty thoughts, (all which thou confessest) whereby thou art led from one
forme to another, but faithfull in none, being led by the Devill or blinde zeal, as thou confessest; and he who hath led thee in all thy rambling and gaddings, hath now brought his end about in thee; that is, to cast all thy dir∣ty stuffe thou hast, gathered upon the truth, which he and thou dost ver most envy: oh that ever envy to the truth should so blinde the Serpent, as to lay open his filthinesse before all men, as thou st in thy Paper; so that were it not that he hath ever some so blinde as to cry up the filthi∣est worke that he can bring out: Thy Book needs no∣thing to make it more ordious, to all that have the least love to God and his truth, then that practice and langu∣age thou doest manifest in it; wherein thou shewest a light vaine spirit, unsavory to any who have but the least of the wisdome of God, and his fear, which leads to sobriety, tost in thy vaine minde thou knowest not where, who art but yet at the best an Atheist, a lyar, slanderer, and false accuser (as thou art found in thy Paper) following such a worship as Christ and all his, bears witnesse against, and pleading for it, as is plaine in thy Paper, and all that have the spirit of judgement may easily see thee; the end of thy gadding, who hast now taken up thy rest with that genera∣tion of Preists who are called of men Master, bear rule by their means, &c. which did ever crucifie Christ, and im∣prison him, as at this day it is seene, as ever it was; and thou that art in the midst of this mind, and starke blinde there, which would set up thy selfe as a way-mark to o∣thers, calling them giddy people, but never knew nothing thy selfe to guide thee, but a giddy deluded braine, or mens words, as appears by thy owne confession; but its no won∣der, to see him that sailes by the weather cock to arrive at adventure: And this I say of thee, and all such guides as thou art, and all thats so blinde as to follow thee, so that thou art so farre from getting disciples to thee in this mad way thou art in, as that thou hast sufficiently warned every one that loves his soule to waite on the Lord, and in his light for a better guide.
In thy confused minde thou runs over many of thy worships thou wast in at Rome, not worth the mentioning after thee; which thou left (as thou sayest) because thou couldst not understand their language. Then thou sayest thou camest to the reformation into a Cathedrall, and with the Organs thou was well pleased, and to such foo∣lish musick and worship thou sayest thou joyned thy heart and voyce and understanding, and of all thy gadding ways it seems this thou likest best, as suting most to thy light vaine minde, for here thou sayest thou stayed, till fear of an alteration possest thee; then thou turned too like the Preists as well without as with a surplise, where thou plainly shewes what principle led thee all along, who ever kept thee ready to change as times, and thy fears moved, and these and other superstitious things thou sets down as a thing past, and with a vaine minde makes a scoffe of thy folly, but blinde beast cannot see thy selfe got no fur∣ther yet, then those filthy Popish traditions of men, which with corrupt mindes they hold up for their own ends, which thou art still pleading for, calling the Papists hou∣ses Churches, and the Popish Bishop made Preists, that still in that generation beget one another, calling them Christs ministers when not one thing they performe in those Po∣pish house, is so much as in the forme of the Saints wor∣ship, and yet in thy filthy minde would wrest Pauls words, who never worshipped in those places, but called out of them, and said, God dwelt not in them; and when at any time he went into them, it was not to worship in them, as thou would wrest it, but to dispute against them, and such a worship as now is performed in them; yet art thou not ashamed to bring his words to prove them; and him who was not a minister of man, nor made by man, nor the will of man, him thou brings to prove the practice of the hirelings, begetting one another in their own wills, all for gaine, but if any preach freely him they persecute, such practice Pauls words will not warrant: and because no Scripture there is, that will prove their practice herein,
thou art forc't to bottom their foundation with a lye, which thou thy selfe makes, saying, that ere Paul was sent any message to preach, he was ordained of the Church, and this is thy proofe, saying, try Acts 13. 3. where Paul was seperated to goe to the Gentiles, and this thou sayest was done ere he had any message to preach, but if thou read Galations 1. or Acts 9. 27. there thou mayest see thy selfe proved a lyar, and perverter of the Scriptures, and yet with thy whores forehead art not afraid to say, it is what the spirit of God hath given thee to speak; and this is thy spirituall converted Quaker, who art turn'd an impu∣dent lyar, even of the Spirit of God himselfe, and thus the Devill hath not lost his labour on thee, in leading thee thus long; but now he hath begotten thee to himselfe wholly, and thou art become his bold fac'd childe, so that when he begets a lye in thee thou art not ashamed to bring it forth into the world, even against the truth it selfe, by which thou art judged from the beginning, and the testi∣mony of plaine Scripture is against thee, which all that read may witnesse: yet art thou so hardned in thy wicked∣nesse, as thou art not ashamed to put thy folly in Print, to be seen of all the world, so that thou mayest but have the least hope to preserve thy fathers kingdome, by casting thy filthinesse upon the truth, for this ever is the way of Satan to act wickednesse, but never own it further then to make truth odious, which is the onely thing that troubles his kingdome: and in thy Paper thou hast clearly acted his part, laying open so many of his filthy movings, and actings in thee, onely to cast them upon us, all which we deny, and thy end thou shalt not accomplish; for did but all the Nation know our practice, as well as they are rea∣dy to beleeve lies against us, there had been no need to have writ any thing for clearing the truth, which as it spreads shall clear it selfe; and thou begins to shew thy filthy wayes, to cast them upon us, shewing that thou wast Popishly affected; and joyned to that filthy Idoll, then to the Bishops and Priests which are the Popes children, all
which we deny, and all their forms of worship as being distant from the foundation of truth, upon which we stand; and though thy selfe be amongst them still, yet thou layes open their skirts, if so be thou might but cast some of their shame upon us, when its well known that the Papists, thou and the Priests, are all joyned together against us, for the truths sake; though in some cerimo∣nies your own carnall ends breeds quarels amongst your selves, and neither their reproach nor thine, can lye upon us, for the day is come, and they must bear the shame that is found in the shamefull worke: the Devill can hide himselfe no longer, with reproching others and thats the cause of his rage. Then thou sayest thou left the railes, and went to hear one who had brought them from the Table to the Pul∣pit. I say, amongst these railers thou art it, railing against the truth, and pleading for them, though this thou speaks to cast upon us. Then thou tells of thy brotherhood among the Inde∣pendents. Truly they had lost their savour that tooke thee for a brother, but thy running wit (it seems) led thee to think, that all that suffered thee to hear them ow∣ned thee for a brother. Then thou sayest thou met one of thy old acquaintance, who told thee of a spirituall teaching, and wisht thee to look within, and brought thee Scripture for it, but this (it seems) thou hadst no minde to follow. Then thou sayest thou met with George Fox, who told thee that thou wast wading in a whirlepoole who helped thee out, and then confirmed thou hadst Christ in thee; and shee came after that brought the bottle, and with once tasting thou was perfect. To which I say, if thou wast not, and yet art wading in a whirpoole, let any wise man judge that reads thy Booke, and sees thy frantick ways thou walkes in, but that ever thou knew Christ, or his spirit in thee to guide thee: I know George Fox would never confirme to thee, for who knowes Christ in them is
led out of all those reprobate wayes thou walkes in: But this thou speakest here of George Fox, and the woman car∣rying the bottle, and that known lye of his deceiving people with ribbons, which a vaine fellow was not asha∣med to put into a Diurnall, to feed vaine light mindes, who are out of the fear of God, and so given over to beleive lyes: I say all these and much more such like dirty stuffe is from one roote of the old lying Serpent, who hath now many plants like himselfe, and his reward you shall all witnesse when you have filled up your measure, and these things cannot lye on the truth, but most fall on your own heads, yea while you think to make the truth odious herein; you make but your selves a scorne to fools, for all the world that knows us, yea them of your own brood shall note you for lyars, and laugh at your folly, and as truth spreads you shall be further known so to be, your woe is comming on a pace, your damnation slumbers not. Thou sayes thou was light, but not in the light, and in thy lightnesse, which was not in the light, thou sayes thou made thy selfe ready, for that which without Gods speciall providence thou wast running too, thou rent off thy new apparell, put on an old cast shute, a small corde about thy hat, threw away thy Bible, slighted thy calling, would not be carefull for thy family, like an Infidell or worse, and in this garbe (thou sayes) thou thought thy selfe not worldly but spirituall, and thus thou art forc't to confesse that thou was led by thy thoughts, though thy venome is to have cast it uppon George Fox, who thou confesseth was thy friend and told thee truth, and thus be∣ing not in the light (as thou art made to confesse) with thy vaine thoughts thou judges, that putting a cord about thy hat, and so forth, made thee spiritual; and yet blinde sot would cast these things upon the light, which in thy thoughts thou acted without the light, for hadst thou minded the light and spirituall teaching it to have fol∣lowed, thou wouldst first have seene the inside reformed
and that obedience which stands not in thy vaine thoughts and light minde, running from one carnall thing to ano∣ther, but in obedience to that spirit that leads to modera∣tion. For the buisnesse of Rotclifts wife whom thou calls a Prophetesse, and the things she held out; I say she was led with a light spirit like thine, (and having lost her guide) thereby was led out into carnall signes and lying won∣ders; but the great thing that thou and she was most troubled at was, that those who stood in the counsell of God should interrupt your passage, and discover your spi∣rit of delusion, and these thy mischivious minde would slnder to have the devill in them, because they discovered the Devil in thee, that he could proceed no further in de∣ceiving; And thou tells of false Prophets, but is there any falser Prophets then these that leads into such lying wonders, and carnall imitations, who in thy vaine thoughts, not in the light (as thou sayes) imagins that putting a small cord about thy hat, and tearing thy cloaths off thy back, will conforme thee to Christ, when a vaine light, lying spirit posesses thee: and thou goes on in this vaine minde trying the Papists and others, and sayes if thou hadst a teacher not inferiour to Paul, yet thou wouldst try him by the Gospel: Thou blinde beast that art out of the light, what Gospel hast thou, or what canst thou try, can thy dark thoughts judge either with the Scripture or without it, thy judgement is manifest of what kinde it is all along in thy Paper, thou sayest out of scorne, thou flyes from the Congregation or Church on the Lords day because they are sinners; and here thou hast tryed thy selfe to be a scorner, and what thou dost is out of scorne by thy own confession, and all scorners are out of the Church, and a Synagogue of Satan: Thou sayes Christ accompanied with prodigalls and harlots, and then sayes try John 15. 2. and there thou art tryed to be a ly∣ar, and a fruitlesse branch cut off; and though Christ taught prodigalls and harlots, yet he was not a compani∣on with them; neither can thy harlots minde, who art
out of the light know him or his company: The Devil further pleads for lengthing his kingdome sayes, the godly and the wicked ought not to be seperated, till he send rea∣pers, who shall devide the one from the other; I say, the reapers are seene, the seperation is making, and such cur∣sed teares as thou are bundling together for the fire, and your torment is drawing on apace: An Objection thou makest to prove your popish houses Churches, the place is nothing but a heap of stones, the Saints is the Church; thy answer is, as Divines doe teach that the word hath a twofold sence, sometimes for the place which is literall, sometimes for the body, whereof Christ is the head, and thou sayes the place is more holy then one of your owne houses, thatcht over with hypocrisie: I answer, this De∣vinity litterall signification and two fold sence and holi∣nesse thou brought with thee from Rome, from whence thy Divines that doe so teach have their foundation; and for thy litterall sence, it is thy own lye, there is no such letter in Scripture, neither in law nor Gospel that calls those places Churches, but Idols Temples and a place for unclean birds, and thou and thy Divines, appeare to have your houses thatcht over with hypocrisie, and steeple height iniquity (as thou sayest) who are not ashamed to teach such doctrine, and lay your lyes upon the letter, and to make thy folly more further manifest, thou sayes are not the Saints the Temple of the holy Ghost? I say yes, and your Idols Temples Synagogues of Satan: Thou sayes the teachers of the word are a stumbling block, or stone of offence in your way, at which you throw your fire balls; I say so too, as appears by your many filthy lying slanders cast upon the truth; but this thou speaks to reproach us, for because we deny thy Di∣vines and Teachers of lyes, who are out of the word and enemies to it, and found in such a way of worship, as Christ and the Saints have ever borne witnesse against, which we by the same spirit beare witnesse against, even their whole worship in their Romish houses performed,
every particular to be out of the forme of godlinesse, much more out of the power; and it is not calling them∣selves ministers, nor thy bringing Scripture that speaks of a ministry that will hide them, for not one Scripture there is (without the Devill do wrest it) that will owne them, their practice, or manner of worship, as they performe it in their high places. And now seeing that their wicked∣nesse is manifest throughout the Nation, and thou canst not hide it, Serpent like thou makes a crooked way, and turns to lay open some of their beastlinesse, which thou wouldst confine to some of them, that so thou might the better hide the rest; and thou sayes, were it not the mira∣culous work of Christ, many of them would rather eradi∣cate then build the fabrick, like whale fishes devouring their fellows, proudly lording over them; others thou hast known meerly sottish, who by favour obtaine great benefits, though the parishners pay excise for their soules, some (thou sayest) are coveteous, lascivious, proud, and envious, yet these thou sayest thou would excuse (where thy nature is seene) and the better to cover thee and them, thou sayes love covers a multitude of sins; I say, thou art curst and thy love, who would cover such a Priest∣hood, for that love that covers the sins layes it open and leads out of it, but that love the doggs and swine knows not, thou nor these filthy beasts thou art covering, other thou sayes are so poore their words are not of force, and other filthy practices thou reckons up, which thy love would cover, and the better to hide them thou sayes the people are in part the cause of it, thou sayes in Jeremiahs dayes the Lord veiwed and both Priest and people wa prophane; but now they that preach Christ doe they not preach truth? the Preists before mentioned taught lyes, suborned evill doers, held out visions of their own heart? I answer, where Jeremiahs spirit is, the same prophanesse is seene now, which Jeremiah laid open, but thou pro∣phane one would hide it, do not they teach lyes who teach others that they live not in themselves, that the light of
Christ wherewith he hath enlightned every one that com∣eth into the world, is naturall and not sufficient, and ma∣ny such lyes they teach, and doe not they suborne evill doers, who stirre up the people to beat and imprison the innocent, yea shed their their blood with their own hands, which is worse then the false prophets in Jeremiahs time, and what visions have these to hold out, but what they imagin, who have no visions nor revelations from God, but say God hath spoken his last; and are not these pro∣phane, and thou a prophane lyar would hide them, and calls them the messengers of the Lord, who deny to have any message from him, and yet thy shamelesse lips sayes these are they whom the Lord is pleased to speak to his people by, whose lips shall preserve knowledg. Then thou turns againe and sayes, because they have prophaned the the holy Covenant, therefore they are become contemp∣table among the people, and thou sayes try Mal. 2. and there thy ministers and messengers are tryed (by thine own confession) to be prophaners of the holy Covenant, and what knowledge their lips have preserved, is manifest in such serpents as thee, who hath got subtilty to cover such a Priesthood, as thou confesses has prophaned the ho∣ly Covenant, and this is thy soule saving advice to the giddy people of England, which hither thou would have converted, and here thou art tryed by thy works, and thy conversion; further, thou goes on to plead for great li∣vings for these messengers, which the Apostles had not, but went teaching from place to place, but (sayes thou) the case is different, and the condition between the Apo∣stles then and the Ministers now; I answer, so it ever was, between the Ministers of Christ and the Ministers of Anti∣christ, the case the condition and the end, which with the servants of Christ is the same for ever, who follows the Lamb, and not the times nor selfe ends in their Ministry: And in scorne an objection thou makes, the Ministers teach for hire, and therefore are but hirelings, and in thy vaine minde thou answers it when thou hast done, saying
if I and thou would but performe the same to them, as their followers did to the Apostles, this bramble bush would be converted into a lilly: I answer, when they come out of their great livings, to do the Apostles work then let him beare his sin, who refuses to give the Apostles wages, till then I say the same of him, who under pre∣tence of the Ministers of Christ, leads the lusts of the mini∣sters of Antichrist, thou tells of some of them, who before they will loose their benefits, they will agree to the pro∣testation, subscribe the Scotch Covenant, go to the mass schoole and learn to say masse, and these thou sayes was the false Prophets Peter spoke of, which makes merchan∣dize of soules; I answer, so they was and so they are but with thy blinde eye thou canst not see it, yet hast thou gone so far in laying open the deceipt of some, as thou hast proved them all guilty, and so they must passe till thou instance one, who hath not conformed to the times, or those filthinesse thou hast mentioned, and thus thou hast excused them till they be all left without excuse, and now look back and see thy Divines their practice, their fruits, and thy own blindnesse, and there in the mud I leave thee and them, and neither Deut: nor any other Scripture thou canst bring, proves means or mainteinance for such a Ministry, nor did ever Paul ordaine these or any such, but from the Pope they have ordained one another, without that Paul-like vision thou tells on, and their hands being poluted, on whom they lay them are defiled, and taking up a forme without the power is the petty treason thou speaks on, for who walks in the way before mentioned, hath not the spirit, therefore cannot give it to others, though with the Magissions of Aegypt they may make Serpents. To slander us further thou sayes, the Magistrates to you are no Magistrates, neither will you call any man father, nor use any reverence to persons of dignity, you would have a party which at length would prove a disparety; I answer, these things thou takes to your selfe, and so let
them lye upon you, not as our practice but as yours; for Magistrates we own, and the power of God, who beare the sword of God, which is a terrour to the evill doers, and is to be laid upon the offenders, ordayned of God for that purpose, and to this ordinance for conscience sake we are subject, fathers of children we owne, and the au∣thority God hath placed in them is to be obayed for con∣science sake, but respect of persons we deny, and that faith which stands in respect of persons, and so we are taught by him, who is the God of order and not of confusion, who never set up a Magistracy to stop his own worke nor rule over the consciences of his people, which he has pre∣served to himselfe; Thou tells of Magistrates to be nur∣sing fathers: I say, those that know him who hath set them there are so, and the thing they are to nurse, is justice righteousnesse and a pure conscience, bearing witnesse a∣gainst all sin, but what is nursed when snares are laid for them that reprove sin in the gate, and for that alone are they beat and imprisoned whipt and there blood shed, when fighters drunkers and swearers, and such like, are set free here, that is nursed, which God hath cursed, which the sword of the Lord is a terrour to, and dreadfull will be the accompt of such Magistrates, when that which they have nurst riseth to judgement. Thou sayes the word ye terme a dead letter, and tells of Christ mauling the Devill with an old Text, and many such things in thy vaine thoughts thou imagin and talkes of; To which I say, thou that calls the word a dead let∣ter knows not the word but art blinde, and we deny thee herein with the light, with which we know the living word and the dead letter, as the children of light have e∣ver done, and thy conjured word of a declarative word we deny, with the living word of which the letter de∣clares, and that which Christ resisted the Devil with thou knowest not, who saith it was an old Text, for thou hast read many Texts, and yet the Devil lives unmauld in thee, who art a lyar and blasphemer, out of the light (as
thou sayes,) and here thou art tryed to be one of those, who hath the letter without the life, the forme without the power, and so art he whom (thou sayes) the Apostle prophesied of, should be in the last dayes, 2 Tim. 3. 5. Thou sayes people who are not of the same opinion with you, you look squintly on with a scornful reproach; I say, so it seems by thy Paper, which thou hast filled with scorne and reproach, to cast upon us, who denyes all your popish opinions, and here thou hast declared thy scorn∣ful nature, by which thou hast been led & now lives in, and God scornes thee who art a scorner, and this sentence of condemnation, I passe upon thee, which God hath passed upon all the generation of scorners; Thou tells of seeing role of predestination; I say thy blinde eye thats out of the light of Christ, is far from seeing predestination or election, thou art so blinded by the Prince of darknesse, thou cannot see thy selfe to be a reprobate, who makes a scoffe at Christ being within thee, and this is not contra∣ry to the words of the Bible thou tells on, but with the Scripture thou art tryed, and found so to be. Thou tells of people wearing apparell beyond their calling, which thou sayes is not the pride the Spirit speaks of, for that Serpent lyes in the heart; I answer, doth not the spirit call to moderation in apparell, and spoke forth Scripture to that purpose, 1 Tim. 2. 9, 10. which who∣soever exceeds goes beyond their calling, which here thou art pleading for, and thus the Serpent (thou tells on) is found in thy own heart pleading for his owne kingdome of pride and filthinesse, yet to hide him with thou wouldst cast a mist, by telling of Solomons robes, but thou that art of Ishmaels brood, knows Hamans robes better then Solo∣mons, and this pride and respect of persons thou art plea∣ding for, which Solomon never did, and when thou hast pleaded against what the Scripture calls to, then thou wishes that all may be performed according to the Bible, and here thou wouldst cover thy selfe with a vaine wish, who hast been teaching contrary to Scripture, but when
all comes to be performed according to the Scripture, then woe to thee and that for which thou art plea∣ding. Thou tells further how near you run to the abscondi∣ties if not absurdities of the Papists; I answer, thou need not conjure up such words, to declare your nearnesse to the Papists, for in plainesse of speech we who are come out from among you, do declare you to be one with them against the Lambs of Christ, and your worship all arising from one roote, and leading to one end, onely your devi∣sion arises about carnal things, as steeplehouses and tythes and so forth, who should have them, the Papists say they are theirs by antiquity, as being the first founders, but you say they are yours by reformation, but the Saints of God had never ought to do amongst you, except it be to de∣clare against you; And thou sayes you are posting on the same roade with the Papists, without a guide to Tyburne, and such vaine words thy airy spirit vomits forth: To which I answer, without a guide you are who are out of the light, and your posting is to make Papists and Athiests (as thou sayes) which are all made out of the light, nei∣ther can you make any but such as your selves, such as you sow, such you must reap, and so your posting is to distruction, and take others with you though you escape Tyburne. Then thou tells of seeking the Radix of your prepo∣sterous wayes, in thy mad seeking thou findes windmills and whirling about and gusts of winde, which thou utters out in thy vaine minde, and sayes, thou couldst never be resolved; I say thou art guided by thy imaginations, proud and lofty thoughts, windmils and gusts of winde whirling about, being dislocated from thy center as thou sayes, and out of the light, what place is there left in thee to be resolved or setled in the truth, so long as that figin minde leads thee, but art like the horse or mule, which cannot be guided without bit or hook: great plagues remaines for such, and though thou confesses thou couldst
never be resolved in our way, yet with thy inference (as thou sayes) thou judgest, and with thy ignorant inference thou findes the first Radix as thou calls it, of those distem∣pers to be ignorance, and so with thy ignorance thou goes about to discover ignorance in us, and cannot see so much ignorance in thy selfe as to stop thy mouth, yet with this ignorance thou confesses thou read the Scriptures, framing Expositions with thy owne private spirit, and with thy own thoughts judgest of them; I answer, with what spirit else couldst thou read them, who art out of the light of Christ, and therefore must needs read them and judge them with thy darke thoughts, and here thou layes open thy owne condition, in subtilty to cast it upon us, who by the light of Christ and his spirit, have those darke thoughts and private spirit judged in us, by which thou art guided, and read the Scriptures still, wresting them to maintaine pride respect of persons, the hirelings worship &c. all which things the Spirit that gave forth the Scrip∣ture, by which we are guided did ever beare witnes against, and this ignorance thou calls thy first Radix, and yet in this thy ignorance, thou blinde sot would be a judge and teacher of others. Thy second Radix is thy selfish principle or finister end; which (thou sayes) thy experience holds out, upon which thou sayes thou gave thy vote for taking away the Idol of Tythes, onely in hope to gaine thine own part, which thou usest to pay, and this thou wouldest cast upon us, and bids us try our wayes: I answer, here thy deceit∣full heart is tryed, and that spirit by which thou art gui∣ded: thy zeal for Christ and the true God, who though thou sees Tythes to be an Idol (with that which is thy condemnation) yet thou art not incited to beare witnesse against that Idol, but from a selfish principle, and here the Beaff and the false Prophet is found in thee, and in this beastly minde, the Devil leads thee to judge others like thy selfe. Thy third Radix thou sayes is pride, and this thou
sayes thou hast by experience, for thou thought thy selfe no wit inferiour to the greatest, because the Text saith, God is no respecter of persons, and now thou sayes, thou thought thou was grown wise, because thou couldst give the language Thou, and keep on thy hat, when thou con∣fesses the ground why thou kept on thy hat was least any should espie more haire then wit: I answer, such is the wisdome of God, and his worke now to leave such as thee to lay open your owne shame before all men, who would set your selves to oppose the truth, as thou dost manifest throughout thy Paper, that filthy spirit by which thou art guided, and shews out thy venome, but cannot come to thy purpose, which if thy filthinesse should be laid open by another it might not be so easily beleived, especially by such as know not the depth of Satan, by whose principle thou plainly appears to have been carri∣ed on all along different from us, as light and darknesse, for we that follow Christ seeing God to be no respecter of persons, are therefore lead out of our selves out of the nature where pride lodges, which God respects not, into that which God respects as they who knew God and Christ ever was, and all may see thy principles which leads thee when the humility of God lead thee to pride, and here thou art seperated from us and thy end and the use of Scripture which thou makes we deny. As for the language Thou, we owne it, as all the Saints in Scrip∣ture ever did, and the keeping on the hat, in obedience to a meek spirit, not from thy cursed corrupt proud princi∣ple: For thy other vaine light words they are not worth mentioning after thee. Thy fourth Radix thou sayes is wilfulnesse, and this (as thou sayest) thou art taught by thy owne experience, for thou would hear no reproofe against thy way: I an∣swer, thou art in the same condition still, though thy blinde eye cannot see it, and in thy owne way thou art, lying and slandering shewing forth thy owne folly and wickednesse, wherein thou hast traded all along: And
that beastly nature wherein thou livest and by which thou art led, hath and ever had the Adders are, not willing to receive reproofe, but in thy imaginations art framing strange wayes, out of the knowledge of God and of his power; by which power we are made a willing people to receive his reproofe, having seen the day of his love, and of his light, and therefore all the beasts of the field, Serpents and night birds, who are not willing to owne his light and power, are gathered against us in their own power, that the Lord may get himselfe a name upon you, who are not willing to be instructed by him. Many more vaine words thou usest, telling how thou wast carried contrary to all commentaries, telling of sounding brasse and tinkling Cymballs, things thou knowes nothing of but by hearsay, thou never came so far yet as a tinkling Cymball, but art brazened out of the form, and therefore thy brasse sounds shamefully; thou sayes thy affections was averse to the voyce of a Minister, and that was the reason Christ left off his miracles among the natives, here thou speaks thou knows not what, Christ never owned such a Ministry as thou pleads for, neither could they ever owne his miracles as now they nor thou cannot practice, who denyes him and his light, and it had been more profitable for thee, to have seen the cause why Christ has left thee, glorying in thy shame, casting up thy dirt and mud to defile others, but thou art blinde of that eye, thou sayes thou hast forgot that learning taught thee to read the Bible, and so to hear of God; I say it had been better for thee never to have read the Scriptures, then thus to abuse and wrest them for the Devills service and to thy owne destruction, so had it been better for thee never to have heard of God, then thus to talke on him in thy light minde, and live out of his feare as thou dost, and so cause his name to be blasphemed by such beastly wayes as thou lives in, as in thy Paper is declared, and the day is co∣ming on apace, when it shall be manifold more easie for them that never heard of God nor Scripture then for
thee, for thou art he whom God hath seene to slight the truth, therefore he hath taken away his candle and fire of love, and thou art he thats grown blinde and envi∣ous, framing out thy owne shame to cast upon others out of envie, and here thou art tryed and thy ways. Now thou follows with an exhortation, (turn againe to the Lord) but this voyce thou sayes thou wouldst not hear till a strange kinde of inward susarration from whence thou knowes not seased upon thy soule: I an∣swer, that voyce that should turne thee to the Lord thou still refuses and never heard it nor turned to him, but by that voyce thou knowes not from whence thou art still guided, and here be witnesse against thy selfe, that thou art guided thou knowest not by what, nor from whence thy guide comes, and all that read thy book may see thou art going thou knowes not whither, and yet busie body would be a guide to others. Then thou sayes, thou was invited by thy singular good friend Cynothiticon to di∣scourse a little with a Minister; to which I say, thou be∣ing come to be guided thou knewest not by what, was in the fittest condition to be led with the blinde, to go to such as thou calls Ministers, for such silly women they lead, who have lost their guide laden with divers lusts, where thou hast been wading; for to none but such can they wrest the Scriptures, and lead them so blinde till they make them beleeve, that the words of Paul (who wan∣dered up and down and had no certaine dwelling place, suffered hunger and nakednesse coveted no mans Silver or Gold but wrought with his hands least he should be chargeable to any) will prove it lawfull for them to have a great house to live in, two or three hundred a year to maintaine them in pride and idlenesse, and for this they may se people and take it by force, also that the words Christ, who commands all his not to be called Masters, &c. may in these dayes be so altered as to binde people to call them Masters, and many such things can they doe, when they meet with such as thee, who art led thou
knows not by what nor from whence it comes, and of such in these dayes they make up their beleevers, and their calling you Saints takes so with such vaine spi∣rits as thee, who are out of the election, and there∣fore made to be deceived, that you cry them up for Ministers of Christ, and are offended with all that will not. Thou sayes he told thee of a house, ye know by the spirit, made without hands eternall in the heavens: I say, that house is not known to the hireling that seek his house here, nor to thy spirit of susuration which came thou knewst not from whence, nor to no such pro∣phane Esaus is that birth-right known, who beare rule over their brethren by earthly things, whose heart is in the old creation knows nothing of the new, though he and thou may talke of it, to satisfie your vaine mindes, as many other things thou sayes he told thee, and framed morralls to convince thee of thine errour and confirme thee in the truth, but hadst thou not been blinde and out of the light of Christ, thou mightest have known that it is the Spirit of Christ that convinces of errours, and not morralls formed by Antichrist nor his Ministers for their owne ends which thou sayes he led thee too, holding forth that all should communicate to them that teach, but he that spoke this had it not for framing morralls, but for sowing spiritualls, but from this (sayest thou) he drew a conclusion concerning the necessity of teaching for eternity; to which I say, I knew before thou toldst me that their necessity of teaching lay here, and still is drawn from that conclusion, that earthly things may be communicated to them, for were it not for that, they might teach that would for them or any other necessity that lyes upon them; I never yet knew that necessity laid upon any of them to call them to a people where there is nothing to be gotten, neither will they suffer others to go to such if they can hinder it, least thereby their tra∣ding be spoiled, and these are the Ministers made by the
will of man, and this is their necessity which they would conclude for eternity, but from what Scripture did he prove that their teaching should endure to eternity? It eems thou either forgot it, or he could finde none that he could wrest to that end, seeing thou canst remember and hast set downe so much of your other jangling, but that's left out: but their teaching which they would have to endure to eternity (by him who is from eternity) is coming to an end, and therefore the wolves rage the childe to devoure. Thou sayes he divinely held out, the 23 of Jeremiah, that the word was a hammer with which he knocks at mans heart, but Jeremiah who had that hammer bears wit∣nesse against that horrible hing that he and thou lives in, which is for the fire and these are the false Prophets thou tells on, which Jeremiah bears witnesse against with their false hammars and false dreams which erre and cause peo∣ple to erre from Jeremiahs practice, and the word that he preached; many other things in thy vaine minde thou rambles over, talking of miniralls mysteries of godlinesse revealed and studious indeavours to that end, spinning out words into severall threads, winding them upon wheels, and much chaffe flies abroad with thy airy spirit, telling of something that's lost, but cannot see thy self to be lost. Thou sayest (turne againe to the Lord) it points out the butt or marke at which all the arrows of thy inventi∣ons thoughts words and actions should be shot: I an∣swer, the arrows of thy inventions and vaine thoughts wicked words and filthy actions, flies abroad through∣out the Nation in this filthy Book, and against the Lamb and his truth hast thou shot them, woe unto thee who hast no other but to shoot thy inventions at, for thee is the sword of the almighty furbished, and with his arrows shalt thou be scattered, and thy generation and brother∣hood thou tells of, with all your inventions, and the way thou hast chosen, shall fall upon thy owne head, and the
judgements of God shall overtake thee, which thou sayes thou hast laid before thee, and now thy airery spirit hath lifted thee up to be a teacher, and thou sayest, if thou wilt turne by praying, God will turne to thee by promising and performing, and here thou layes thy prayers as a foundation, whereon Gods promises and performances must be built, but thy foundation is seen and curst by him who to the foundation is come, before prayer was, which is the foundation of all prayer which God excepts, and thy prayers which are before, before thou be turned to this foundation and on it, are the prayers of the wicked an abomination to the Lord; thou sayes thy counsell is, to have a favourable respect to a painefull Minister, who waites for the soule; I say, if we have respect to such as waite for the soules, then we must deny the Idoll shep∣heards, who waits for their gaine from their Quarters, and takes it by force where the soule lyes in death, and where it is quickned not by them; thou sayes Ahab would call for Prophets, but they you all know was adolatrous, but Jehosophat enquires for one of the Lords Prophets; I answer, the lyar speaks in thee, thou dost not know the multitude of Israels Prophets to be false, but art amongst them, pleading for them with the same falsehood they are in, neither dost thou know that one true Prophet, which never Prophesies good of them nor thee, neither canst thou beleeve him, but hast sent out thy railing letter against him, & art that Rabsheka thou tels of. Thou sayes that Hezekiah having received that rayling letter takes not upon himselfe, but sends for the Prophet to pray, and here the lyar speaks in thee againe, for Hezekiah spread the letter before the Lord and prayed, neither sent he for the Prophet, but to the Prophet to pray, though thou sayes he admits of none but who was for that office to speak in publick, as though Hezekiah had excluded some from praying in that case, doubleing the lye two or three sold to make thy cords strong to up∣hold the hireling, which is all the refuge they have to hold
them by, now that the light is come, but their refuge of lyes is sweeping away, and the Land is cleansing, and this is thy converted Quaker which is thus stuffed with lyes, and this is thy truth thou art established in, and thy advice to the giddy people of England. And towards thy conclusion thou exhorts to take Christs counsel, Mat. 6. 6. Enter into thy private Cham∣ber where then (as thou sayest) they shall plainly see within the closet of their hearts, the City of God the new Jerusalem, the spiritual Solomon, the attendance, the gates, the keepers of those gates with the keyes thereof, and many such things which thou hast seen in the letter, which thy vaine minde babbles on, but knows nothing of them in thy life, who exhorts others to finde them in their hearts, but thou thy selfe returned into the Idolls Temple to seeke them; thou sayest to others let the word of God be a light to their pathes, but confesses thy selfe to be out of the light, and so all that know the light, and read thy practice, lyes, and light language exprest in thy book, shall so judge of thee, thou child of darknesse; and least thou should prolux (as thou sayest) in this pud∣dle of confusion, thou ends thy heap of folly, and shuts up thy desires with the Prophets words, Isa. 30. 20. Ho∣ping though the Lord give thee the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not your teachers be re∣moved into a corner, &c. And as many as walke accor∣ding to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy upon the Israel of God: To which I answer, what has any theefe hireling or dreedy doggs (who by their oppression cause others to eat the bread of adversity, and drink the water of affliction) to do with these words which Isaiah spoke who bare witnesse against all such, who thou they be a∣mongst Israel, yet they are not of Israels feed nor walke according to their rule, which is Christ the Lamb, but follows Cain and Balaam, and upon none such is mercy or peace. Thou begins and ends with thy ruines which as they
stand are sufficient to shew forth thy folly guided by a light spirit, who art erred from the truth; and now look back to thy wayes, wherein thou hast walked, and where∣in thou art found blaspheming and lying upon the spi∣rit of the Lord, saying, that what thou hast writ in thy book was what the spirit of God gave thee to speak, but art found in a foolish vaine lying light language, as far from the language of the spirit, as darknesse from light; slandering the people of God and his way, which is too pure for such prophane Esaus as thou to walk in, whose shamefull steps thou hast declared in thy book, and that lying condition thou art now in, and yet would set thy selfe up as a teacher to others, when as indeed all that hear of thee may fear the Lord, and take heed to his light, which thou sayes thou art out of, that so they may be kept in his feare, to avoyd thy wayes: Oh shame that ever thou shouldst be thus brazened in thy filthinesse to put such things as these into Print, and to vomit out thine owne filthinesse out of envy to the truth wherein thou couldest never walk, which all may stand as a curse upon thy head and a warning to generations to come, and that shame which thou had thought to have cast upon us, is fallen on thy selfe; Blessed be our God who is con∣founding the Devil, saving his people, and raining the snares of the wicked upon their own head.
(NOW) A WORD To You MAGISTRATES, Who should rule for God in this Nation, which you shall witness at the dreadfull day of account, to be love to your soules. THat you all waite on the Lord, and in his light, the spirit of judgement to re∣ceive from God who hath set you in your places, that with it you may come to discerne and judge of the things that differ, now in this day, when God is getting himselfe a name in the earth, that so you may be one with the Lord in his worke, and not against it, that
you may answer the end of your calling, and so come to give your account with joy, and receive your reward with such Magistrates of which you read in the Scripture, who never used their power against God nor his work. That you all take heed how you beleive reports, from selfe ended men guided by corrupt principles against the truth, who would render it odious to establish their deceit wherein they live, & so you be found fighters against God, you having seen what he hath don to those who withstood him before you, and they are taken away, and you are esta∣blished; (oh that you saw the hand by which it is done) now this God requires at your hands, that you stop not his work, nor hinder his spirituall kingdome, thereby thinking to establish your owne, for which you see he hath overthrown kingdomes, neither think to stop the truth, by putting the bodyes of such where it is risen, in∣to holes and prisons, for hereby you shall but (Pharaoh like) see it faster to grow, and increase your owne plagues, which all that loves God would have his crea∣tures to escape. But if any of you do so much owne justice as that with an honest heart you say, you would not have a hand in opposing the truth if you knew it, but what you doe is to stop errours, and you here many loud cries against this way, and its every where evill spoken on, and some say we are sent from Rome, that we are Jesuits, Franciscan Friers, and the like; To such Magistrates I say, you have us in the Nation, and our accusers, and we have done no∣thing in corners, let us be called before you and our ac∣cusers, and if so we be proved let us suffer, but if not why should this reproach lye upon the truth to be a stumblng block to you; but if it be said, though we be free borne, and have been freinds to the truth and to the Common∣wealth, yet now we are turned seducers and teach errors, &c. To that I say you have the Scriptures, which shewes the Saints lives, wherein they taught and walked, where∣in errors was judged; This I say without boasting, for
clearing the truth let us and our accusers, come to face be∣fore you, and he that cannot owne the Scriptures and the Saints practice therein declared, as they stand without wresting thereby to be tryed, their life and their doctrine, there with all let him be condemned, and let the life of Christ and all that followed him, recorded in Scripture, be witnesse against such, that they are erred from the do∣ctrine of Christ, and the practice of the Saints, and there∣fore are Antichrists, and their sayings shall not cover them, so may you come to see the truth cleared and that time not evill spent. But for those of you, who are so set in your purposes against us, as that you will not give liberty to innocensie to clear it selfe before you (and so keep you clear of in∣nocent blood) and that because of hats and bowing and such things as Godly Magestrates never required, nor they that follow the Lamb cannot performe, but depart out of the faith and defile their consciences; and which things are not against justice, righteousnesse, mercy, the welbe∣ing of the Nation; I say to such a Magistrate, the day is coming on apace, that thou shalt see and confesse to the everlasting words of Christ, That it had been better for thee that a milstone had been hanged about thy neck and thou cast into the Sea, then to have been one of the num∣ber that is risen to oppose the kingdome of Christ, and to offend his little ones, though all thou canst doe his work shall not hinder; he that can receive it let him. FINIS.
