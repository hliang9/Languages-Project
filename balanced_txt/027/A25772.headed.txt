THE Dean of Chesters SPEECH TO His MAJESTY. August the 27th. 1687. ALLOW Us Great SIR, to express our Loyal Joy, in be∣holding here the Face of Your Sacred MAJESTY. Our Eyes are now Blest, while VVe see amongst us that Mighty and Wonderful KING, who equals in Clemency His late Royal Brother, in the sincerity of His Religious purpose; His Father the Glorious Martyr; in other Princely Virtues, both His Grand∣fathers, the Great HENRY of France, in Courage and Conduct of Wars: And King JAMES the I. of England, in Wisdom, and Defence of this National Church: And what more recommends this Generous Patronage, He preserves that ALTAR from being overthrown, at which He does not VVorship.
'Twere to be wished True, that all who enjoy this Protection, had return'd suita∣bly their Thankful ADDRESSES: However it be, VVe humbly hope, that Your MAJESTY, like God, (whom in Governing-power, You Represent upon Earth; and in Pardoning-mercy, You do imitate,) will be kind to the unthankful, and according to Your accustom'd Good∣ness, will spare the Place for the smaller visible number of good Men therein. So great Grace certainly heals their Infi∣delity and Revolt, especially, when they are thus invited to believe, and adhere to a Prince, of whom we have had the Experi∣ence, that He will no sooner recede from His Promise, than He would fly from an Enemy in the Field. As for what concerns Us of this Royal Foundation, with all Humility, I under∣take for my self, and several of my Bre∣thren, that VVe will continue to advance amongst Your Subjects the strict Principles of a mannerly, peaceful, and active Loy∣alty, making earnest Prayers to Almighty God, that He would in this VVorld grant Your MAJESTY length of Days, and hereafter Eternal Life and Glory. LONDON, Printed for M. T. 1687.
