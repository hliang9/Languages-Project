A CHOICE NARRATIVE OF Count Gondamor's TRANSACTONS DURING HIS EMBASSY IN ENGLAND. By that Renowned Antiquary, Sir Robert Cotton, Knight and Baronet. Exposed to publick Light, for the Benefit of the whole NATION. By a Person of Honour. LONDON, Printed for John Garfield, at the Printing Press for Pictures, near the Royal Exchange in Cornhil, over against Popes-Head Alley, 1659.
To the Right Worshipful, Sir VVilliam Pastons, Knight, and Baronet. SIR, THe general Voice is, That You are a great Lover of Rarities, whence it is that I Dedicate this to You, and I hope You will make my Apologie Your self, with that of Seneca, Non malè meruit, sed benè judicavit: The Age is full of voluminous Books that are able to make the Reader nauseate, were he not recreated by diver∣sion; This I present You with, is but small, yet were it wyer▪drawn to its full length, it would make a huge Volume: For it includes the Actions of King James, Earl Gondamor, Bishop Bancroft, Sir Walter Rawleigh, and some other Famous Men, of whom
several Histories might be compiled: I may compare it to Gold, that in a small quantity is of more worth than a great deal of base Coin, for it comprehends much Matter in a few Words. And for the far∣ther Commendation, it bears in the Frontispiece the Name of that ever Famous Antiquary, Sir Robert Cotton, who was never wont to treasure up any thing but what was Rare; nor can I certainly say, whether it were Pen'd by Himself or not. I insist the more upon Him, because it was my chance to be one whom he vouchsafed to take by the Hand a little be∣fore his Death, I being sent to him by my Lord Pri∣vie Seal, to acquaint him that by my Lords Media∣tion, the King was Reconciled to him: but his An∣swer was, That his Heart was broken, and that it was now too late: Whereby it appears that Princes are sometimes abused, and mis-informed, to the Ruine of the best Men. Sir Walter Rawleighs unfortu∣nate end proves the same, who was circumvented by the cunning Practises of Earl Gondamor, whereby to the unspeakable detriment of Posterity, he was prevented from setting forth the Second Part to compleate the Worlds History, which he had made ready for the Press. Gondamor is yet fresh in Memory of many Men, who knew him when he lay Leiger here from the King of Spain; and I never
heard or read of any Embassadour that acted his part with more dexterity for his Masters glory and ad∣vantage than he did, for however he had to deal with a very wise Prince (as he sayes) yet like another Mercury he could soon with his facetious words and gestures pipe King James a sleep, and did sometimes take hold of the Helm himself, and was very near to have run the Ship a ground, or to have split her upon the Rocks, the influence of his ill Aspect, and Eclipsing the Sun-beams is hardly over unto this present Age. Don Caro Columbus who was sent hither, was thought by many judicious Men, to be the more Prudent, and that Gondamor was but a Buffon compared with him: yet when he departed, he was fain to leave this Motto behind him, Rever∣tar, emplying, That he had not accomplished what he came about: but Gondamor put a Period to what he had Designed; and perhaps it had been bet∣ter for our Nation if that Politick Spaniard had never trd upon English ground. I should be in∣jurious to Your Patience if I should detain You longer in the Suburbs: Therefore I hasten to subscribe my self, Your Worships very humble Servant, John Rowland.
A CHOICE NARRATIVE OF Count Gondamor's TRANSACTIONS During his Embassy in ENGLAND. HIs Catholick Majesty had given Com∣mandement, that presently upon the return of Signior Gondamor, his Leiger Embassadour from England, (1618.) a special Meeting of all the principal States of Spain, (who were of his Council) together with the Presidents of the Council of Castile, of Ara∣gon, of Italy, of Portugal, of the Indies, of the Trea∣sure, of War, and especially of the holy Inquisition, should be held at Mouson in Aragon, the Duke of Ler∣ma
being appointed President, who should make de∣claration of his Masters pleasure, take account of the Embassadours service, and consult touching the State and Religion respectively, to give satisfaction to his Holiness Nuncio, who was desired to make one in this Assembly, concerning certain Overtures of Peace and Amity with the English, and other Catholick Projects which might engender suspition and jealousie betwixt the Pope and his Majesty, if the mistery were not unfolded and the ground of these Counsels disco∣vered afore-hand. This made all men expect the Embassadors return, with a kind of longing that they might behold the issue of this meeting, and see what good for the Catholick cause the Embassadours employment had effected in England, answerable to the general opinion conceaved of his wisdome, and what further project would be set on foot to become matter for publick discourse; At length he arrived and had present notice given him from his Majesty, that before he came to the Court he should give up his account to this Assembly, which Command he gladly received as an earnest of his acceptable service, and gave thanks that for his ho∣nor he might publish himself in so judicious a presence; he came first on the day appointed to the Council Chamber, (except the Secretaries) not long after all the Council of State and their Presidents met, there wanted only the Duke of Lerma, and the Popes Nuncio, who were the head and feet of all the Assembly. These two stayed long away for divers respects, the Nuncio, that he might express the greatness of his Master, and lose the Sea of Rome, no respect by his over-sight, but that the Benches might be full to ob∣serve
him at his approach. The Duke of Lerma to express the authority and dignity of his own person, and to shew how a servant put in place of his Master, exacts more duty of his fellow servants then the Master himself; these two stayed till all the rest were weary of waiting, but at length the Nuncio supposing all the Council set, lanched forth and came to road in the Council chamber, where after mutual discharge of duty from the Company, and blessing upon it from him, he sate down in sollemn silence grieving at his over-sight, when he saw the Duke of Lerma absent, with whom he strove as a Competitor for pompe and glory. The Duke had sent before, and understood of the Nuncio's being there, and stayed something the longer that his boldness might be observed, wherein he had his desire, for the Nuncio having a while patiently dri∣ven away the time with several complements, to seve∣ral persons, had now almost run his Court-ship out of breath, but that the Duke of Villa Hermosa, President of the Council of Aragon, fed his humour by the dis∣charge of his own discontentment, upon occasion of the Duke of Lerma his absence, and beckned Signior Gondo∣mor to him, using this speech in the heaing of the Nuncio, after a sporting manner; how unhappy are the people where you have been, first for their souls, being Hereticks, then for their estates, where the name of a Favourite is so familiar; how happy is our state where the Keyes of life and death are so easily come by, (pointing at the Nuncio) hanging at every Religious girdle, and where the doors of Justice and Mercy, stand equally open to all men without respect of persons; The Embassadour knew his Ironical stroak to be in∣tended only as a by-blow at the Nuncio, but fully at
the Duke of Lerma, (whose greatness begun now to wax heavy toward declension) and therefore he return∣eth this answer. Your Excellency knoweth, the estate is happy where wise Favourites govern Kings, if the Kings themselves be foolish, or where wise Kings are, who having Favou∣rites, either foolish, or the wiser sort, will not yet be go∣verned by them. The State of England (howsoever you hear of it in Spain or Rome) is too happy in the last kind, they need not care what the Favourite be, though for the most part he prevent all kind of suspition in that kind, being chosen rather as a Schollar to be taught▪ and trained up, then as a Tutor to teach: Of this they are sure no Prince exceeds theirs in personal abilities; so that nothing could be added to him in my wish, but this one, that he were our vassal and a Catholick. With that the noise without gave notice of the Duke of Ler∣ma's entrance, at whose first approach the whole house arose, though some later then other, as envy had hung Plummets on them to keep them down; the Nuncio only sate unmoved, the Duke cherished the observance of the rest with a familiar kind of carriage, too high for curtesie as not neglecting their demeanors, but expect∣ing it, and after a filial obeysance to the Pope his Nuncio, sate down as President under the cloth of Estate, but somewhat lower, then after a space given for admirati∣on, preparation, and attention, he began to speak in this manner. The King my Master (holding it more honor to do, then to discourse, to take from you the expectation of Oratory, used rather in Pulpits and Schools then in Councils,) hath appointed me President in this holy, wise, learned, and noble assembly, a man naturally of a
slow speech, and not desirous to quicken it, by Art or Industry; as holding action only proper to a Spani∣ard as I am by birth, to a Souldier as I am by professi∣on, to a King, as I am by representation; take this therefore briefly, for declaration both of the cause of this meeting, and my Master his further pleasure. There hath been in all times since the worlds foun∣dation, one chief Commander or Monarch upon the earth, this needs no further proof then a back looking into our own memories and Histories of the world; neither now is there any question (except with Infidels and Hereticks,) of their own chief Commander in Spirituals, in the unity of whose person, the members of the visible Church are included. But there is some doubt of the chief Commander in Temporals, who as the Moon to the Sun might govern by night, as this by day, and by the Sword of Justice, compel to come in, or cut off, such as infringe the authority of the Keys: This hath been so well understood long since by the infallible Chair, as that thereby upon the declension of the Roman Empire, and the increase of Romes Spiri∣tual splendor, (who thought it unnatural that their Sun should be sublunary) our Nation was by the Bi∣shop of Rome, selected before other People, to conquer & rule the Nations with a rod of Iron. And our King to that end adorned with the Title of Catholick King, as a name above all names under the Sun (which is) under Gods Vicar General himself, the Catholick Bi∣shop of souls; to instance this point by comparison; look first upon the grand Signior, the great Turk, who hath a large Title but not universal, for besides that he is an Infidel, his command is confined within his own Territories, and he stiled not Emperour of the World,
but of the Turk and their Vassals only. Amongst Christians, the Defender of the Faith, was a glorious Stile, whilst the King, to whom it was given by his Holiness, continued worthy of it, but he stood not in the Truth, neither yet those that succeed him, & beside it was no great thing to be called, what every Christi∣an ought to be, Defender of the Faith, no more then to be stiled with France, the most Christian King, wherein he hath the greatest part of his Title common with most Christians; the Emperour of Rome, Russia, Germany, extend not their limits further than their stiles which are local, only my Master the most Catholick King, is for dominion of bodies, as the universal Bishop for dominion of souls, over that part of the World which we call America (except where the English in∣truders usurp) and the greatest part of Europe, with some part of Asia, and Africa, by actual possession, and over all the rest by real and indubitable right, yet ac∣knowledgeth this right to be derived from the free and Fatherly donation of his Holiness, who as the Sun to the Moon lends lustre by reflection to this King∣dome, to this King, to this King of Kings my Master, what therefore he hath howsoever gotten, he may keep and hold, what he can get from any other King, or Commander, by any Stratagem of War, or pretence of Peace, he may take, for it is theirs only by usurpa∣tion, except they held of him from whom all civil pow∣er is derived, as ecclesiastical, from his Holiness; what the Ignorant call Treason, if it be on his behalf is truth, and what they call Truth, if it be against him is Trea∣son; and thus all our Peace or War, our Treatises, Mar∣riages, and whatsoever intendment else of ours, aims at this principal end, to get the whole possession of the
World, and to reduce all to unity under one temporal Head, that our King may truly be what he is stiled, the Catholick & Universal King; as Faith is therefore uni∣versal, & the Church is universal, yet so as it is under one Head the Pope, whose seat is and must necessarily be at Rome, where Saint Peter sate; So must all men be Subject to our and their Catholick King, whose parti∣cular seat is here in Spaine, his universal every where. This point of State, or rather of Faith, we see the Ca∣tholick Roman Religion hath taught every where, and almost made natural; so that by a Key of Gold, by intelligence, or by way of confession, my Master is able to unlock the secrets of every Prince, and to withdraw their subjects allegiance, as if they knew themselves ra∣ther my Master his subjects in truth, then theirs, whom their birth hath taught to miscal Soveraign; we see this in France, & in England especially, where at once they learn both to obey the Church of Rome, as their Mo∣ther, to acknowledg the catholick King as their Father, & to hate their own King as an Heretick and an Usur∣per; so we see Religion, and the State are coupled together; laugh and weep, flourish, and fade, and par∣ticipate of eithers fortune growing upon one stock of Pollicy: I speak this the more boldly here in this presence, because I speak here before none but Natives, persons who are partakers both in themselves & issues, of these Triumphs of antient Rome, and therefore such as besides their oaths it concerns to be secret; Nei∣ther need we restrain this freedome of speech from the Nuncio his presence, because besides that, he is a Spani∣ard by birth, he is a Jessuit by profession and order, devised by the providence of Gods Vicar, to accom∣plish this Monarchy the better, all of them being ap∣proriate
thereunto▪ and as publick Agents, and privy Counsellors to this end, whereas the wisdome of this state is to be beheld with admiration, that in temporal Wars, it imployes, or at least trusts none but Natives; so in Castile, Portugal, or Aragon: so in Spirituals, it imployes none but the Jesuites, and so imployes them that they be generally reputed▪ how remote soever they be from us, how much soever obliged to others, yet still to be ours, and to be of the Spanish Faction, though they be Polonians, English, French, and residing in these Countries and Courts; the penitents there∣fore, and all with whom they deal and converse in their spiritual traffick, must needs be so too, & so our Catho∣lick King must needs have an invisible Kingdome and an unknown number of subjects in all Dominions, who will shew themselves and their Faiths, by their works of disobedience, whensoever we shall have occa∣sion to use that Jesuitical vertue of theirs; this there∣fore being the principal end of all our Councils, according to those holy directions of our late pious King Phillip, the second, to his son now surviving, to advance the Catholick Roman Religion, and the Ca∣tholick Spanish Dominion together, we are now met by his Majesties Command, to take an account of you (Signior Gondomor) who have been Embassadour for England, to see what good you have effected there, to∣wards the advancement of this work, and what further project shall be thought fit to be set on foot to this end, and this is briefly the occasion of our meeting. Then the Embassdour who attended bare-headed all the time, with a low obeysance began thus; this most laudable custome of our Kings, in bringing all Officers to such an account, where a review and notice
is taken of good and bad service upon the determina∣tion of their Imployments, resembles those Roman Triumphs, appointed for the Souldiers, and as in them it provoked to courage, so in us it stirs up to diligence; our Master converseth by his Agents with all the World, yet with none of more regard then the English, where matter of much diversity is often presented through the several humors of the State, and those of our Religion and Faction, that no instruction can be sufficient for such negotiations, but much must be left in trust to the discretion, Judgment, and diligence of the Incumbent: I speak not this for my own glory, I having been restrained, and therefore deserved mean∣ly, but to forewarn on the behalf of others, that there may be more scope allowed them to deal in, as occasi∣on shall require. Briefly this rule delivered by his Ex∣cellency, was the Card and compass, by which I scaled to make profit of all humors, and by all means to ad∣vance the State of the Romish Religion, and the Spanish Faction together, upon all advantage either of oath or the breach of them, for this an old observation but a true, that for our piety to Rome, his Holiness did not only give, but also bless us in the Conquest of the new World; and thus in our pious perseverance, we hope still to be Conquerors of the old. And to this end whereas his Excellency, in his excellent discourse, seems to extend our outward Forces, & private Aims, only against Hereticks, and restrain them in true amity with those of the Romish Religion: This I affirm sure, because there can be no security, but such Princes as are now Romish Catholicks, may turn Hereticks hereafter, my aims have ever been to make profit of all, and to make my Master, Master of all, who is a faith∣ful
and constant son of his Mother Rome: And to this end I beheld the endeavours of our Kings of happy memory, how they have archeived Kingdomes and Conquests by this policy, rather then by open Hosti∣lity, and that without difference, as well from their Allies and Kinsfolks, men of the same Religion and profession, such as were those of Naples, France, and Navarr, though I do not mention Portugal now uni∣ted to us, and Savoy that hardly stept from us, as of an adverse and Heretical Faith; Neither is this rule left off, as the present Kingdome of France, the State of Venice, the low Countries, Boemia, now all labour∣ing for life under our plots, apparently manifest this way; therefore I bend my Engines in England, as your honours shall particularly hear; Neither should I need to repeat a Catalogue of all the service I have there done, because this State hath been acquainted with many of them heretofore by the intercourse so wrought, that the State should be rather rob'd and weakned (which is our aim) then strengthened, as the English vainly hope; Besides in a small time, they should work so far into the body of the State, by buy∣ing Offices, and the like, whether by Sea or Land, of Justice Civil or Ecclesiastical, in Church or State, all being for Mony exposed to sale, that with the help of the Jesuites, they would undermine them with meer wit, without gunpowder, and leave the King but a few Subjects, whose Faiths he might relie upon, whilst they were of a Faith adverse to his, for what Catholick body that is sound at the heart, can abide a Corrupt and Heretical head. With that the Duke of Medina dell Rio secco, Pre∣sident of their Council of War, and one of the Coun∣cil
of State, rose up and said, his Predecessors had felt the Force and Wit of the English in Eighty eight; and he had cause to doubt, that the Catholicks them∣selves that were English, and not fully Jesuited, upon any Forraign Invasion, would rather take part with their own King, though an Heretick; than with his Catholick Majesty, a Stranger. The Embassadour desired him to be of another mind; since first, for the persons, generally their bo∣dies by long disuse of Arms were disabled, and their Minds effeminated by Peace and Luxury, far from that they were in 88, when they were daily flesh'd in our Bloud, and made hearty by customary Con∣quests: And for the affections of those whom they call Recusants, (quoth he) I know the bitterness of their inveterate Malice, and have seen so far into their Natures, as I dare say they will be for Spain aainst all the World: yea (quoth he) I assure your Ho∣nours I could not imagine so basely, of their King and State as I have heard them speak, nay their rage hath so perverted their Judgements, that what I my self have seen and heard proceed from their King beyond admiration even to astonishment, they have sleighted, misreported, scorned and perverted to his disgrace, and my rejoycing, magnifying in the mean time our Defects for Graces. Here the Duke Pastrana, President of the Council of Italy, steps up and said, He had lately read a Book of one Cambdens, called his Annals, where writing of a treaty of Marriage long since, betwixt the English Elizabeth, and the French Duke of Anjowe; he there observes, that the Marriage was not seriously intend∣ed on either side, but politickly pretended by both
States counterchangably, that each might effect their own ends: There (quoth he) the English had the better, and I have some cause to doubt, since they can Dissemble as well as we, that they may have their aims under▪hand as we have, and intend the Match as little as we do: And this (quoth he) I beleive the rather, because their King as he is wise to consult and consider, so he is a constant Master of his Word, and hath Written and given strong Reasons against Mat∣ches made with Persons of contrary Religion; which Reasons no other man can Answer, and therefore doubtlesse he will not go from, nor counsel his Son to forsake these Rules, laid down so deliberately. Your Excellency mistakes (quoth the Embassa∣dor) the advantage was then on the side of the Eng∣lish, because the French sought the Match; now it must be on ours, because the English seek it, who will grant any thing rather than break off; and besides have no patience to temporize or dissemble in this or any other Design, as the French have long since well observed; for their Necessities will give them neither time, nor rest, nor hope elsewhere to be supplied: As for their King I cannot search into his Heart, I must beleive others that presume to know his Mind, hear his Words, and read his Writings, and these relate what I have delivered: But for the rest of the People, as the number of those that are truly Religious are e∣ver the least, and for the most part of least account, so it is there; where if an equal opposition be made be∣twixt their truly Religious and ours, the remainder which will be the greater number, will stand indiffer∣ent, and fall to the stronger side where there is most hope of gain and glory, for those two are the gods of
the magnitude and multitude; now these see apparent∣ly no certain supplies of their Wants, but from us. Yes (quoth the Duke) for even now you said, the general State loathing the Match, would redeem the fear thereof with half their Estates; it is therefore but Calling a Parliament, and the business were soon effected. A Parliament! (sayes the Embassadour) Nay, therein lies one of the chiefest Services I have done, in working such a dislike between the King and the Lower House, by the endeavours of that honourable Earl, and admirable Engine, a sure Servant to us, and the Catholick Cause whilst he lived, as that the King will never endure Parliament again, but rather suffer absolute Want, than receive conditional Relief from his Subjects; besides, the Matter was so cunningly carried the last Parliament, that as in the Powder-Plot the fact effected should have been imputed to the Puri∣tans, the gteatest Zealots of that Calvinian Sect; so the Propositions which dam'd up the Proceedings of this Parliament, howsoever they were invented by Romish Catholicks, and by them intended to disturbe that Session, and yet were propounded in favour of the Puritans, as if they had been hammered in their Forge, which very Name and Shadow the King hates, being a sufficient Aspersion to disgrace any Person to say he is such, and a sufficient bar to stay any suit, and utterly to cross it, to say it smells of, or enclines to that Par∣ty: Moreover, there are so many about him who blow this Coal, fireing their own Stakes; if a Parlia∣ment should enquire into their Actions, that they use all their Art and Industry to withstand such a Council,
perswading the King he may Rule by his absolute Pre∣rogative without a Parliament, and thus furnish him∣self by Marriage with us, and other Domestick Pro∣jects without Subsidies, when Levying of Subsidies and Taxes have been the only use Princes have made of such Assemblies: And whereas some free Minds amongst them resembling our Nobility, who preserve the Priviledge of Subjects against Soveraign Invasi∣on, call for the Course of the Common Law, (a Law proper to their Nation) these other Time-severs cry the Laws down, and up the Prerogative; whereby they prey upon the Subjects by Suits and Exactions, milk the State and keep it bare, procure themselves much Suspition amongst the better and more judici∣ous sort▪ and Hae amongst the oppressed Commons; and yet if there should be a Parliament, such a course is taken, as they shall never Chuse their Shire Knights and Burgesses freely, who make the greater half of the Body thereof; for these being to be Elected by most Voices of the Free-holders in these Countries where such Elections are to be made, are carried which way the great Persons, who have Lands in these Countries, please; who by their Letters com∣mand their Tennants, Followers, and Friends, to No∣minate such as adhere to them▪ and for the most part are of our Faction, and respect their own Benefit or Grace, rather than their Countries good; yea, the Country-people themselves, will every one stand by the great Man, their Lord, or Neighbour, or Master, without regard of his Honesty, Wisdom, or Religi∣on, that which they aim at (as I am assured by faith∣ful Intelligence, is to please their Landlord) and so to renew their Lease; in which regard they will
betray their Country and Religion too, and Elect any man, that may most profit their particular: There∣fore it is unlikely there should ever be a Parliament, and impossible the Kings Debts should be paid, his Wants sufficiently repaired, and Himself left full-handed by such a course; and indeed, as it is generally thought, by any course but by a Marriage with us; For which cause, whatsoever Project we list to at∣tempt, enter safely at the Door, whilst their Policy lies asleep, and will not see the Danger: I have made tryal of these Particulars, and find few Exceptions in this general Rule. Thereby I and their own Wants together, have kept them from Furnishing their Navie, which being the Wall of their Island, and once the strongest in Chri∣stendom, lies now at Road, unarm'd, and fit for Ruine; If ever we doubted their Strength by Sea, now we need not; there are but few Ships or Men able to look abroad, or live in a Storm, much lesse in a Sea Fight; this I effected by bearing them in hand, the Furnishing of their Navie bred suspition in my Master, and so would avert him from the Match, the Hope of which, rather than they would lose, they would lose almost their Hope of Heaven. Secondly, All their Voyages to the East Indies, I permit rather with a colourable Resistance than a seri∣ous, because I see them not helpful but hurtful to the State in general, carrying out Gold and Treasure, bringing home Spice, Silks, Feathers, and the like Toyes, and insensibly wasting the Common Stock of Coin and Bullion, while it fills the Custom-house, and some private Purses, who thereby are enabled to keep this discommodity on foot by Bribes, especially so
many great Persons (even States-men) being adven∣turers and sharers in the Gain; besides this, wasteth their Marriners, not One of Ten returning, which I am glad to hear, for they are the Men we stand in fear of. Thirdly, Their West Indian Voyages, I withstand them in earnest, because they begin to Inhabite there, and Fortifie themselves, and may in time perhaps raise another England, to withstand our new Spain in America; as this old England opposeth our present State, and clouds the glorious extents thereof in Eu∣rope: Besides, there they trade for commodities with∣out waste of their Treasure, and often return Gold for Knives, Glasses, and the like trifles, and that with∣out such loss of their Marriners, as in other places; therefore I crossed whatsoever Intendments were pro∣jected for Virginia, or the Bermudoes, because I see they may be hereafter really helpful unto them, as now they serve for Drains to unload their populous State, which else would over-flow its own Banks, by continuance of Peace, and turn Head upon it self, or make a Body fit for any Rebellion. And so far I prevailed herein, as I caused most of the Recusants, who were sharers, to with-draw their Ventures and discourage the Work; so that besides private Persons unable to effect much, nothing was done by the publick Purse: And we know by experi∣ence, that such Voyages and Plantations are not ef∣fected without great Means to sustain great Difficul∣ties, and with an unwearied Resolution and Power to meet all Hazards and Disasters with strong Helps and continual Supplies, or else the Undertaking prove idle.
Fourthly, By this means likewise, I kept the volun∣tary Forces from Venice, till it was almost too late to set out, and had a hope that work of secrecy, should have broken forth to action, before those could have arived to succour them. Fifthly, I put hard for the cautionary Towns, which our late King Philip, of happy memory so aimed at, accounting them the Keyes of the Low Countries, that they might be delivered to his Catholick Maje∣sty, as to the proper owner; and had perhaps prevail∣ed, but that profest Enemy to our State and Church who dyed shortly after, gave Council to restore them to the Rebellious States, as one that knew popular Common-wealths to be better Neighbours, surer Friends, and less dangerous enemies, than Monarchs; and so by this practice rescued them from my hands, and furnished the Exchequer from thence for that time; neither was I much grieved at this, because the de∣pendancy they had before of the English, seemed now to be cut off, and the interest the English had in them and their cause, to be taken away, which must be fully and finally effected, before we can hope either to Conquer them, or England, who holding together are too strong for the World at Sea; and therefore must be disunited before they can be overcome. This point of State is acknowledged by our most experi∣enced Pentioner, and sure Friend, Mounsier Barnevel, whose succeeding plots for this end, shall bear witness for the depth of his Judgement. Sixtly, But the last service I did for the State, was not the least, when I underwrought that admirable En∣gine, Rawleigh, and so was the cause, his voyage threat∣ning much danger and damage to us was overthrown,
and himself returning in disgrace, I pursued almost to death; Neither (I hope) need I say almost, if all things hit right, and all strings hold; But the deter∣mination of my commission would not permit me longer to stay to follow him to execution, which I de∣sired the rather, that by concession I might have wrung from the inconsiderate English, an acknowledgment of my Masters right in those places, punishing him for attempting there, though they might prescribe for the first foot; And this I did to stop their mouths hereaf∣ter, and because I would quench the heat and valour of that Nation, that none should dare hereafter to un∣dertake the like, or be so hardy as to look out at Sea, or breath upon our coasts; and lastly, because I would bring to an ignominious death, that old Pirate, who is one of the last now living, bread under that deceased English Virago, and by her flesht in our blood and ru∣in: To do this I had many Agents, first, divers Cour∣tiers who were hungry and gaped wide for Spanish Gold; Secondly, some that bare him at the heart for inveterate quarrels; Thirdly, some forraigners, who having in vain sought the Elixer hitherto, hope to find it in his head; Fourthly, all men of the Romish Faith, who are of the Spanish Faction, and would have been my Blood-hounds to hunt him or any such to death willingly, as persons hating the prosperity of their Country, and the valour, worlh, and wit of their own Nation; in respect of us and our Catholick cause; Lastly, I left behind me such an instrument composed artificially, of a secular understanding, and a Religious profession, as he is every way adopted to scrue himself into the Closet of the heart, and to work upon feminine Levity, who in that Country, have mas∣culine
Spirits, to command and pursue their Plots un∣to death. This therefore I account as done, and re∣joyce in it, knowing it will be very profitable to us, grateful to our Faction there, and what though it be cross to the People, or the Clergy, we that only nego∣tiate for our gain, & treat about this marriage for their own ends, can conclude or break off when we see our time, without respect of such, as can neither profit us, nor hurt us; for I have certain knowledg, that the Com∣mons generally are so effeminate and cowardly, that they at their Musters, which are seldome and slight, only for the benefit of their Muster Masters of a 1000 Souldiers, scarce a hundred dares discharge a Musket, and of that hundred, scarce one can use it like a Soul∣dier; And for their Arms they are so ill provided, that one Corslet serveth many men, when such as shew their Armour one day in one place, lend them to their friends in other places to shew, when they have use; And this if it be spied, is only punished by a mulct in the purse, which is the Officers aim, who for his ad∣vantage, winks at the rest, and is glad to find and che∣rish by Connivance profitable faults, that increase his Revenues; Thus stands the state of that poor mise∣rable Country, which had never more people and few∣er men; So that if my Master should resolve upon an invasion, the time never fits as at this present, securi∣ty of this marriage, and the disuse of Armes having cast them into a dead sleep, a strong and wakning Faction being ever amongst them ready to asist us, and they being unprovided of Ships, or Arms, or hearts to fight, an universal discontentment following all men: This I have from their Muster Masters, and Captains, who are many of them of our Religion, or
of none, and so ours ready to be bought and sold, and desirous to be my Masters servants in Fee. Thus much for the State particularly, wherein I have bent my self to weaken them and strengthen us, and in all these have advanced the Catholick cause, but especially in procuring favours for all such as fa∣vour that side, & crossing the other by all means; And this I practice my selfe, and give out to be generally practised by others, that whatsoever success I find, I still boast of the victory, which I do to dishearten the Hereticks, and to make them suspitious one of another, especially of their Princes best States-men, and to keep our own in courage, who by this means increase, other∣wise would be in danger to decay. Now for Religion, and such designs as fetch their pretence from thence, I beheld the policy of that late Bishop of theirs, Bancroft, who stirred up and main∣tained a dangerous Schisme, betwixt our secular Priests and Jesuits, by which he discovered much weakness to the dishonour of our Clergy, and prejudice of our cause; This taught me as it did Barnevelt in the Low Countries, to work secretly and insensibly betwixt their Conformists, and Non-conformists, and to cast an eye as far as the Orcades, knowing that business might be stirred up there that might hinder proceedings in England, as the French ever used Scotland to call home the Forces of England, and so to prevent their Conquests, the effect you have partly seen in the Earl of Argile, who sometimes was Captain for the King and Church, against the great Marq. Huntley, and now fights under our banner at Bruxels, leaving the Cros∣ses of St. George, and St. Andrew, for the Cross of St. James: Neither do our hopes end here, but we day∣ly
expect more Revolters, or at least such a disunion as will never admit solid reconcilement, but will send some to us, & some to Amsterdam, for the King (a wise and vigilant Prince) labouring for a perfect union be∣twixt both the Kingdomes which he sees cannot be effected; where the least Ceremony in Religion is continued diverse, sharp & bitter brambles from thence arising, whilst some striving for honour more then for truth, prefers their own way and will before the ge∣neral peace of the Church, and the edification of souls, he I say seeks to work both Churches to uniformity, and to this end made a Journey into Scotland, but with no such success as he expected, for divers of ours at∣tended the train, who stirred up humors and factions, and cast in scruples and doubts to hinder and cross the proceedings, yea those that seem most adverse to us, & averse to our opinions by their disobedience and ex∣ample, help forward our plots, and these are incourag∣ed by a factious and heady multitude, by a faint and Irresolute Clergy, many false Brethren being amongst their Bishops, and the prodigal Nobility, who main∣tain these stirs in the Church, & that thereby they may safely keep their Church livings in their hands, which they have most Sacrilegiously seized upon in the time of the first Deformation, and which they fear would be recovered by the Clergy, if they could be brought to a brotherly peace and agreement, for they have seen the King very bountiful in this kind, having lately in∣creased their pentions, and setled the Clergy a Com∣petent Maintenance, and besides out of his own Means which in that Kingdome is none of the greatest, ha∣ving brought in and restored whole Bishopricks to the Church, which were before in Lay-mens hands, a
great part of the Nobilities estate consisting of spiri∣tual Lands, which makes them cherish the Puritanical Faction, who will be content to be trencher fed with Scraps and Crums, and contributions, and arbitrary benevolence, from their Lords, and Lairds, and Ladies and their adherents and followers. But (quoth the Inquisitor General) how if this act of the Kings, wherein he is most earnest and con∣stant, should so far thrive, as it should effect a perfect union in the Church and Common-wealth, I tell you it would in my conceit, be a great blow to us, if by a General meeting, a general peace should be concluded, and all their Forces bent against Rome, and we see their politick King aims at this. True (quoth Gondamor) but he takes his mark amiss howsoever he understands the People and their incli∣nation better then any man, and better knowes how to temper their passions and affections, for besides that he is hindered, there in Scotland underhand, by some for the reasons above recited, and by the other great ones of ours, who are in great place and authority a∣mongst them, he is likewise deluded in this point, even by his own Clergy at home in England, who pretend to be most forward in the cause, for they considering if a general uniformity were wrought, what an Inunda∣tion would follow, whilst all or most of theirs would flock thither for preferment, (as men pressing towards the Sun for light and heat) and so their own should be unprovided; these therefore I say, howsoever they bear the King fairly in hand, are under hand against it, and stand stiff for all Ceremonies, to be obtruded with a kind of absolute necessity upon them, when the other will not be almost drawn to receive any, when
if an abatement were made, doubtless they might be drawn to meet in the midd'st; but there is no hope of this with them, where neither party deals seriously, but only for the present to satisfie the King, and so there no fear on either side, that affections and opini∣ons, so divers, will ever be reconciled and made one, Their Bishop of St. Andrews stands almost alone in the Cause, and pulls upon himself the labour, the loss and envy, of all with little proficiency, whilst the ad∣verse Faction have as sure friends, & good intelligence about the King, as he hath; and the same Post, per∣haps, that brings a packet from the King to him, brings another from their abettors to them, acquainting them with the whole proceedings and Councils, and prepar∣ing them aforehand for opposition, this I know for truth, and this I rejoyce in as conducing much to the Catholick good. But (quoth the Nuncio) are there none of the He∣retical Preachers busie about this Match, me thinks their fingers should itch to be Writing, and their tongues burn to be Prating about this Business, espe∣cially the Puritanical sort, howsoever the most tem∣perate, and indifferent, carry themselves. The truth is my Lord, (quoth the Embassadour) that privately what they can, and publickly what they dare, both in England and Scotland, all for the most part, except such as be of our Faith, oppose this Match to the uttermost, by Prayers, Counsels, Speeches, & Wishes; but if any be found longer tongued than his Fellows, we have still Means to charm their sauciness, and to silence them, to expel them the Court, to dis∣grace them, and cross their Preferments, with the im∣putation of pragmatick Puritanism: For instance, I
will Relate this one particular; A Doctor of theirs, and Chapline in Ordinary to the King, gave many Reasons, in a Letter, against this Marriage; and Pro∣pounded a Way how to supply the Kings Wants o∣therwise: which I understanding, so wrought under∣hand, that the Doctor was committed, and hardly es∣caped the Danger of this presumptious Admonition; though the State knew his Intent was honest, and his Reasons good: Wherein we on the other-side (both here, and with the arch-Duke) have had Books penn'd, and Pictures printed directly against their King and State, for which their Embassadors have sought satis∣faction of us in vain, not being able to stay the Prince, or so much as to touch the Hem of the Authors Gar∣ment. But we have an evasion which Hereticks miss, our Clergy being freed from the Temporal Sword, and so not included in our Treaties and Conditions of Peace, but at liberty to give any Heretical Prince the Mate when they list, whereas they are lyable to ac∣compt and hazard, and are muzled for barking, when ours may both Bark, and Bite too: The Council-Table, and the Star-Chamber, do so terrifie them as they dare not Riot, but run at the stirrop in excellent command, and come in at the least Rebuke; they call their Preaching in many places standing up, but they crowch and dare not, stand not up, nor Quest, behave themselves like Setters, silent, and creeping upon their Bellies, lick the dust which our Priests shake off from their beautiful feet. Now (quoth the Duke of Lerma) satisfie me a∣bout our own Clergy how they fare; for there were here Petitions made to the King, in the Name of the Distressed, Afflicted, Persecuted, and Imprisoned Priests,
that his Majesty would intercede for them, to free them from the intollerable burdens they groan under, and to procure their Liberties; and Letters were di∣rected from us to this end, That you should Negotiate this Demand with all speed, and diligence. Most Excellent Prince, (replyed Gondamor) I did your Command, with a kind of Command my self, not thinking it fit to make it a Suit in your Name, and my Masters; I obtained them liberty to walk up and down, to face, and out-face their Accusers, Judges, Magistrates, and Bishops, and to exercise their Fun∣ctions, almost as freely, altogether as safely as at Rome: Here the Nuncio objected, That he did not well in procuring their liberty, since they might do more good in Prison, than abroad; because in Prison, they seemed to be under Persecution▪ and so were pitied of others, and pity of the person prepares the affection further; besides, then they were careful of their own Lives to give no offence, but abroad they might be scandalous in their Lives, as they use to be in Rome, and Spain, and other Catholick Countries; and so the Opinion of their Holiness▪ which upholds their Credit, and Cause, against the Married Clergy, would soon de∣cay. But the Embassadour Replyed, He considered thes inconveniences, and besides a superiour Command, he saw the profit of their liberty, more than of their re∣straint; for now they might freely confer, and were ever practising, and would doubtless produce some work of Wonder▪ and besides, the reason of their Authority, and Means to change places▪ did apply themselves to many persons, whereas in Prison they could only deal with such as came to be taught, were
their own before; And this (quoth he) I added as a Secret, that as before they were maintained by private Contributions from Devout Catholicks, even to ex∣cess; so much more now shall they be able to gather great Sums to weaken the State, and furnishing them for some high attempt, by the example of Cardinal Wolsey, barrelling up Gold for Rome; and this they may easily do, since all Catholicks rob the Heretical Priests, and with-hold Tythes from them by fraud or force, to give to these of their own, to whom it is pro∣perly due: And if this be spied, its an easie matter to lay all upon the Hollander; and say, He carries the Coin out of the Land (who is forward enough in∣deed in these practises) and so ours shall not only be excused, but a flaw made betwixt them to weaken their Amities, and beget suspition betwixt them, of each o∣thers Love. But amongst all these Priests, (quoth the Inquisitor) did you remember that old Reverend Father, Bauld∣win, who had a finger in that admirable attempt made on our behalf against the Parliament House; such as he, deserving so highly, and ventering their Livs so resolutely for the Catholick Cause, must not be neg∣lected, but extraordinarily Regarded, thereby to en∣courage others to the like Holy Undertakings. Holy Father, (quoth Gondamor) My principal care was of him, whose Life and Liberty, when I had with much difficulty, obtained of the King, I so∣lemnly went in person, atended with all my Train, and divers other well-willers, to fetch him out of the Tower, where he was in durance: as soon as I came in his sight, I behaved my self after so lowly and humble a manner, that our Adversaries stood amazed
to see the Reverence we give to our Ghostly Fathers; and this I did to confound them and their contemptu∣ous Clergy, and to beget an extraordinary Opinion of Holiness in the person, and Piety in us; and also to provoke the English Catholicks to the like devout O∣bedience, that thereby at any time these Jesuites whose authority was somewhat weakned since the Schism betwixt them and the Seculars, and the succeeding Powder-plot, may work them to our ends, as Ma∣sters their servants, Tutors their Schollars, Fathers their Children, Kings their Subjests, and that they may do this the more boldly and securely, I have som∣what dash'd the authority of their high Commissio∣ners; upon which, whereas there are divers Purse∣vants, men of the worst kind, and condition, resem∣bling our Flies, and Familiars, attending upon the Holy Inquisition; whose office and employment is to disturb the Catholicks, search their Houses for Priests holy Vestments, Books, Beads, Crucifixes, and the like Religious appurtenances; I have caused the Execution of their Offices to be slackened, so that an open way may be given to our Spiritual Instru∣ments, for the free Exercise of their Faculties; and yet when these Pursevants were in greatest authority, a small Bribe, in the Country, would blind their eyes, or a little greater at the Court, or in the Exchequer frustrate and cross all their actions, so that their ma∣lice went off like Squibs, making a great Crack to fright Children, and new born Babes, but hurt no old men of Catholick spirits; and this is the effect of all other their Courses of proceedings in this kind, in all their judicial Courts, whither known Catholicks (Convicted, as they term them) are often summoned
and cited, threatned and bound over, but the danger is past so soon as the Officer hath his Fee paid to him, then the Execution goeth no further; nay, upon my Conscience, they are glad when there are Offendors in that kind, because they are bountiful, and the Offi∣cers do their best to succour them, that they may en∣crease, and so their benefit and gain come in free∣ly. And if they should be sent to prison, even that place for the most part is made a Sanctuary to them, as the old Romans were wont to shut up such by way of re∣straint, whom they meant to preserve from the peoples fury; so they live safe in prison till we have time to work their liberty, and assure their lives, and in the mean time, their place of restraint is as a study unto them, where they have opportunity to confer together as in a Colledg, and to arm themselves in unity against their single adversaries abroad, (but quoth the Inqui∣sitor General) how do they for Books when they have occasion either to write or dispute▪ My Lord replyes, Gondamor, all the Libraries be∣longing to the Romish Catholicks, through the land, are at their Command, from whence they have all such Collections as they can require, gathered to their hands, as well from thence, as from all the Libraries of both Universities, and even the Books themselves if that be requisite. Besides I have made it a principal part of my em∣ployment, to buy all the Manuscripts and other anci∣ent and rare Authors, out of the hands of the Here∣ticks; So that there is no great Schollar dies in the Land, but my Agents are dealing with his Books; In so much as even their learned, Isaac Causabons Li∣brary
was in Election without question to be ours, had not their Vigilant King (who foresees all dangers, and hath his eyes busy in every place) prevented my plots▪ for after the death of that great Schollar, I sent to request a view and Catalogue of his Books, with their price, intending not to be out-bid by any man, if mony would fetch them, because (Besides the damage that that side should have received by their loss, persecuting the same story against Cardinal Baronius) we might have made good advantage of his Notes, Collections, Castigations, Censures, and Criticismes for our own party, and framed and put out other under his name at our pleasure; But that was fore-seen by their Pro∣metheus, who sent that torturer of ours, the Bishop of Winchester, to search and sort the Papers, and to seal up the study, giving a large and Princely Allowance for them▪ to the Relict of Causabon, together with a boun∣tiful pention, and provision for her and hers, but this plot failing at that time, hath not ever done, nor had the University of Oxford so Triumphed in their many Manuscripts given by that famous Knight Sir Tho∣mas Bodly, if either I had been then imployed, or this course of mine then thought upon; For I would la∣bour what I might this way or any other way, to dis∣arm them, & either to translate their est Authors hi∣ther, or at least to leave none in the hands of any, but Roman Catholicks, who are assuredly ours; and to this end, an especial eye should be had upon the Libraries of one Sir Robert Cotton an Ingrosser of Antiquities, that whensoever it comes to be broken up either before his death or after, the most choice and singular Pieces might be gleaned or gathered up; Neither let any mn think that descending thus low to petty particu∣lars
is unworthy an Embassadour, or of small avail for the ends we aim at, since we see every mountain consists of several sands, and there is not more profi∣table conversing for States-men, then amongst Schol∣lars and their Books, especially where the King for whom we watch is the King of Schollars, and loves to live almost altogether in their Element. Besides, if by any means we can continue difference in their Church, or make them wider, or beget distaste betwixt their Clergy and common Lawyers, who are men of greatest power in their Land, the benefit will be ours, the consequence great, opening a way for us to come in between, for personal quarrels produce re∣al questions. As he was further prosecuting this Discourse, one of the Secretaries, who waited in the Chamber with∣out desired entrance, and being admitted, delivered Letters which he had newly received of a Post, direct∣ed to the President, and the rest of the Council, from his Catholick Master; the Contents whereof were to this effect. Right trusty and wel-beloved Cousins and Counsel∣lors, we Greet you well; Whereas we had a hope by our Agents in England, and Germany,to effect the great Work of the Western Empire, and like on the other side to surprize Venice, and so incircling Europe at one instant, and infolding it into our arms, make the easier Road upon the Turk in Asia▪ and at length reduce all the World to our Catholick Command: And whereas to these holy ends, we had secret and sure Plots and Pro∣jects on foot in all these places, and good intelligence in all Courts; Know we that, we have received late and sad
News of the apprehension of our most trusty and able Pen∣tioner, Barnevelt, and of the discovery of other our in∣tendments; so that our hopes are for the present adjourn∣ed, till some other more convenient and auspicuous time; We therefore will you presently▪ upon sight hereof, to break off your Consultation, and repair straight to our Presence, there to take further directions, and proceed as necessity of the time, and cause, shall require. With that his Excellency and the whole House, struck with amazement, crossed their fore-heads, rose up in sad silence, and brake off this Treaty abruptly, and without tarriance took Horse and Posted to the Court, from whence expect newes the next fair wind. In the mean time, let not those be secure whom it concerns to be rouzed up, knowing that this aspiring Nebuchadnezzar, will not lose the glory of his Greatness, who continueth still to magnifie himself in this great Babel, until it be spoken, Thy Kingdome is departed from thee, Dan. 4. FINIS.
