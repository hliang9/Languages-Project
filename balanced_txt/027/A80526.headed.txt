COPPY OF THE ADDRES: Of a Great Number of the Members of the Parliament of SCOTLAND, Presented to the KING by my Lord ROSS, and the other Commissioners with him at Ken∣singtoun, 11th of June, 1700. May it please Your MAJESTY, WE Your Majesties most Loyal and Dutiful Subjects, the Subscribing Noblemen, Lords, Barrons, and Burgesses, of this Your Ancient Kingdom of SCOTLAND; Members of the same Parliament which happily settled Your Majesty's Government over Us, And has ever since given Continued Proofs of Zeal and Affection, to Your Majesty's Service in the several Sessions thereof; Do humbly Represent to Your Majesty, that having according to Your Majesty's Royal Appointment, met together in Parliament, with full Resolution to have Proceeded in the like Good Intensions, for the Honour and Interest of Your Majesty, and People. It is to Our Unspeakable Grief and Disappointment, that not only there has been no Return given to the Unanimous Address of the last Session of Parliament, Expressing the whole Nations Concern in the INDIAN and AFRICAN Company; But also, after a Motion made in this Session of Parliament, for a Resolve, That Our Colony of CALEDONIA in DARIEN, is a Legal and Rightfull Settlement in the Terms of the Act of Parliament 1695, And that the Parliament would mantain and support the same. The Members beginning to Reason thereupon, were Interrupted by an Adjournment, which We Humbly Conceive is not Agreeable to the 40 Act of the 11th. Parliament of King JA, the 6 Where it is Promitted, That nothing shal be done or Commanded, which might directly or Indirectly Pre∣judge the Liberty of free Voting, And Reasoning of the Estates of Parlia∣ment, or any of them in all time coming. And there after by a Subsequent Adjournment, from the Thirtieth Day of May instant, to the Twentieth Day of June nixt, the Par∣liament was not Permited to come to any Resolution, in the pressing Concerns of the Nation; which we cannot think consistent with that Article of Our Claim of Right: Whereby it is Declared, That for the Redress of all Grievances, and for the amending, Strengthing, & preserving of the Laws; Parliaments ought to be Frequently called & allowed to Sit, & the Freedom of Speech & debate secured to the Members We do therefore in all Humility and Earnestness, intreat that Your Majesty will be Graciously Pleased, to allow Your Parliament to Meet at the Day to which it is now Adjourned; And to sit as long as may be Necessary for Redressing the Grievances of the Nation, Asserting it's just Rights and Priviledges, as well at Home as Abroad, in its Colony of CALEDONIA, and for Enacting such Laws as may be for the Advancement and Security of Religion; the Honour of Your Majesty, and the true interest of this Nation. We are, May it Please Your Majesty, Your Majesties most Dutiful, most Loyal, and most Obedient Subjects and Servants. EDINBURGH Re-Printed by John Reid, 1700.
