¶TO THE HIGH and excellent Princesse, E∣lizabeth, eldest daughter to our Soueraigne Lord King IAMES. MOST gratious Princesse; vouch∣safe (I beseech you) the remem∣brance of that du∣ty, which we owe vnto God for all his benefits; namely, to take vp the cup of saluation and call vp∣on the name of the Lord. This is the subiect of this smal Treatise. Which I am the rather embolde∣ned to present vnto your grace, because, as the Lord hath renu∣ed his mercies continually vpon your princely person, especially
shewed himselfe merueilous in that your admirable deliuerance from these bloodie hunters: so it pleased your highnes to accept very fauourably the remem∣brance thereof, and to patronage my first labors (to that end) with the prime of your Graces prote∣ction: which as it hath the rather bound me to consecrate my selfe and al my studies to your Graces deuotion; so doe I in all humble maner tender vnto your Excel∣lency, a pledge hereof in these short meditations; which as they may bee your daily practise of thankefulnes to God for all his mercies toward you: so will they also proue verie profitable di∣rections for the information of your tender yeeres in the waies of God: that so beeing daily crowned with new blessing, you
may at length be fitted for that crowne of glory, which the Lord Iesus hath purchased for you. To whose blessed protection I doe most heartily commend your Highnes: and so most humbly take my leaue. Your Graces most affe∣ctionate in all duety, Tho. Cooper.
TO THE RGIHT Honorable the Lord Ha∣rington, and his ver∣tuous Ladie. RIGHT Hono∣rable, the prince∣lie charge that the Lord hath hono∣red your elder yeares with∣all, that your age may bee a crowne of glorie, beeing found in the way of righte∣ousnesse, as it hath laid vp∣on your Honours, a greater care for the discharge there∣of: so hath it prouoked also those (who as in priuate they wish your well-fares, so e∣specially, they desire your
happie sucesse in that pub∣licke Charge, as being in all heartie loyalty obliged ther∣to: These, I say, haue bin stir∣red vp to deuise all holy and profitable meanes whereby your Charge may be more Honorable, and your care more comfortable. Among whom, seeing it hath pleased your Honours formerlie to accept of me, & daily to bind me therto by renued fauours I haue therefore endeuored to testifie the heartie conti∣nuance of my dutie towards your Honours in this Briefe of holy rules, and instructi∣ons, which I haue been bold to dedicate to the hopefull, and happie dayes of your Gracious Charge: not therein presuming to teach your
Honour what you should doe: but rather proposing the same as a Glasse, wherein you may view, what you haue done well; and so both to encourage your Honours in a happie proceeding, and to giue you sound comfort in the good successe thereof: which as I shall not cease to pray daily vnto the Almigh∣tie for; so I doe most hum∣blie beseech your Honours thus to conceiue of my ende∣uours, & to continue, as you doe, the true paterns of ver∣tuous nobility, & the Hono∣rable patrons of religion & learning. And so I most har∣tilie commend your Honors to the grace of God. Your Honours to command in all loue and dutie, Tho. Cooper.
❧ To the Christian Reader, grace and peace. THE manieGreen∣ham. Perkin. Rogers. Downam. and Arthur Dent, &c. ex∣cellent treatises & larger discourses cōcerning the po∣wer of godlines, which it hath pleased the Lord of glorie to furnish his Church withall in these last daies; as they haue made good the faithfulnes of our God vnto vs of this Church of England, so if they shall not be a witnesse against vs, do they necessarily require the right vse thereof, that we be transformed in∣to the same image from glory to glorie. And therefore howsoeuer it may seeme both needelesse and preiudiciall after so manie graue, and experimentall rules concerning sanctification, to adde any more in this kind: yet seeing it hath plea∣sed God to direct me to a further
labour herein, waigh with mee I pray thee in equitie these reasons hereof: First I doe hereby professe my thankefulnes vnto God for those excellent labours of his Saints that now rest from their labours and their fruits follow them. Secondly, I would haue thee know that I am not ashamed of this foolishnes of preaching and practick Diuinity, which is such a mysterie to the world, and stumbling blocke vnto the wisedome thereof. Thirdly, Howsoeuer I do professe that I am not able to attaine such perfection, as I haue herein con∣ceined, yet I would haue thee know further, that I would rather haue a rule to condemne sinne in the flesh, and so confound the old man, that thereby the new man may follow hard after the marke, then not to giue testimony to that ligh which hath shined so gratiously vn∣to me, then to conceale my iudge∣ment, though it may condemne th practise. Fourthly, May it please thee to con∣sider
with me: Can a man walke in the sunne, and not be warme, and where twolie together, will there not be heat? and can the light be hidden, nay, ought it to be hidden? 5 Can wee doe lesse in these dayes then conuince a prophane world? 6 Can wee doe better then strengthen that which is readie to die? 7 Shall not Gods remembran∣cers renue their strength, when the diuels instruments do so rage with all licentiousnes? 8 Doe we not iustifie the good by seeking out their wayes? 9 Should we not discourage the wicked by making a good professi∣on? 10 Owe we not this duety to our mother? 11 Shall not this redound to the glory of God? Let this content thee: and pro∣uoke thee to make vse of these labours, and the Lord giue thee vn∣derstanding in all things: that thou maiest trie the Spirits, and heereby
thine owne, whether thou art in the faith or no, and so for euer maiest follow the true Shepheard. To whose blessed prote∣ction I do most hartily commend thee.

¶THE CHRISTI∣ans daily Sacrifice. CHAP. I. FIRST,Of man and his▪ God made al things for his glory, but especially Man, Pro. 16. 3. 1. Co. 10. 31. in whom is discouered 1. The greatnes of his iustice. 2. The riches of his mercy. Rom. 9. 22. Secondly, Man glorifieth God in a fourefold estate of his, 1. Creation. 2. Fall. 3. Redemption. 4. Glorification. Thirdly, The Lord from euerlasting so decreed concerning mankinde, that the greater part thereof should be condemned, and but a remnant
saued. And to this end created he man.Creation. Rom. 9. 28. Mat. 7. 13. Fourthly, Man was created after the image of God in a most perfect estate of holines: wherein he glorified God in absolute conformity to him, yet subiect vnto change: which also made for Gods glory. Gen. 1. 27. Fiftly,Fall. The Lord ordained the Fall of man, and therefore his estate was mutable, that so his fall might be from himselfe: that God might make a way for the manifestation of the glory of his mercy & iustice, in the execution of his decree, con∣cerning the saluation of the elect, & condemnation of the reprobate; by such meanes as from all eternity the Lord had sealed thereunto; and thereupon man fell. Gen. . 6. Sixtly, Man hauing receiued an estate for himselfe, and his posteri∣ty, by his fall vtterly depriued him∣selfe and all his issue of Gods fauor, and the fruit thereof, the right and possession of heauen and earth: and plunged himselfe and all his poste∣rity into a most wofull bondage of sinne and Satan. Ge. 2. 17. Ro. 6. 12.
Seuenthly,Redempti∣on. The fall of man made a way to the worke of Redemption which was performed by Iesus Christ. Eightly, Christ Iesus was first, decreed from all eternity: secondly, promised immediately after the fall of Adam: thirdly, exhibited in the fulnes of time, to performe a full re∣demption for vs. Gal. 4. 4. Gen. 3. Ninthly, Our redemption by Christ, is either performed or applied. Tenthly, Christ Iesus performed our redemption:How it was per∣formed. first, by obedience. And that 1. To God his Father in com∣ming to redeeme vs. 2. In taking our nature vpon him. 3. To the Law in fulfilling it perfectly, which we had broken. 4. In vndergoing the punish∣ment when hee had fulfilled the Law. And by these his sufferings our redemption was secondly wrought out. These sufferings of Christ: were First, either in his whole lie such
miseries as sinne had drawne vpon vs, that so he might sanctifie them vnto vs, as hunger, cold, &c. Heb. 2. 18. Heb. 4. 15. Secondly, Or at his death, such paines as we had deserued, and here he suffered, First, in his body as 1. preparati∣ons to death. 1. Buffetings by the Souldiers. Mat. 27. & 28. 2. Whipping, and scourging. 3. Crowning with Thornes. 4. Carying of his Crosse. 5. Nayling to the Crosse. Ioh. 19. Secondly, death it selfe: here con∣sider, 1 The ignominious manner, vp∣on the cursed tree. Gal. 3. 2 The cruelty vsed vpon his dead bodie, as being pierced to the heart by that mercilesse Souldier. Ioh. 19 34. 3 His ignominious buriall, and de∣taining for three daies in the graue. These were his sufferings in bodie. Secondly, he also suffered for vs in his soule, and that 1. In his whole life. 1 Griefe for the sin of the world,
and especially of his owne country∣men who refused him. Ioh. 1. 2 The mockings of the wicked and treachery of his owne was no small anguish vnto him. Especially at his death, as First, that he was betrayed by Iu∣das his owne disciple. Luk. 22. 48. 2 His agony in the garden where he sweat water and blood, in great a∣bundance. Luke 22. 3 His trouble in soule. Ioh. 12. 7. 4 The withdrawing of the assi∣stance of the Deitie for the present. Phil. 2. 8. 5 The curse of God vpon him for mans sinne, Gal. 3. 10. 6 The power of Satan preuailing for a time. 7 The horror of being ouer∣whelmed with the heauie wrath of God. Heb. 5. 7. 8 His detaining vnder the sor∣rows of death. Acts. 2. 24. All these, Christ Iesus our redee∣mer suffered in his humane nature, but they were accompanied with the merit and efficacy of the diuine nature, the dignitie whereof ena∣bled
them hereunto, & made them meritorious for our saluation. Now because it was not possible that the Sonne of God should be holden of the sorrowes of death; for then had he not beene iustified and acquitted from our sinnes: ther∣fore by the power of his God-head he raised vp himsefe, and so accom∣plished yet further the worke of our redemption. Rom. 4. 25. Act. 2. 24. And so Christ Iesus our redee∣mer obtained a glorious conquest by his resurrection from the dead: and that First, Ouer the Law in abolish∣ing the dominion and rigour thereof. Secondly, Ouer Satan and Hll, chaining vp Satan & destroying for euer the powers of hel. 1. Co. 15. 57. Thirdly, Ouer sinne, and that 1 in taking away the sting and guiltines thereof. 2 Abating the rage and fury of the same. Rom. 7 24. 25. 3 Healing in some measure the corrupt fountaine of the same. 4 Wealng the force and daily ea∣ting out the verie corruption there∣of.
Rom. 6. 12. 3. Fourthly, death is also conquered and subdued; and that, 1 By taking away the sting therof. 2 By destroying the dominion of the same. Rom. 5. 14. 3 Sanctifying it to the Godly, to whom it is the gate to euerlasting life. 1. Thes. 4. 4 Raysing vp our flesh from the graue. 1. Cor. 15. And thus by this glorious con∣quest of our Captaine Iesus Christ, is recouered vnto vs, Heb. 12. 2. First,The Bene∣nefit of our redemp∣tion. The fauour of God our Fa∣ther, whose children we are now become in Iesus Christ. 2. Cor. 5. 18. 1. Iohn 3. 1. Colos. 1. 20. Secondly, The fruits of this fa∣uour, which are 1 Faith in the sonne of GOD, wherby being iustified before God we haue, 2 Peace of conscience with God and man. 1. Rom. 5. 1. Rom. 7. 4. 3 Ioy vnspeakeable in the holy Ghost. 1. Pet. 1. 8. 4 We become fruitfull in all good workes, and so thereby become meete
partakers. Colos. 1. 12. 5 Of saluation. The earnest whereof wee haue in this life: first by the inward testi∣mony of the spirit. . Cor. 1. Ephes. 4. Secondly, By our outward simi∣litude and conformity to our head Christ Iesus, being changed into the same Image from glory to glory as by the spirit of the Lord. 2. Cor. 3. 18. And we shall fully enioy it in the life to come, where shall be 1 Ceasing of all sinne and sorrow. Reuel. 7. 17. 2 Perfect righteousnesse and holi∣nesse. Ephes. 5. 27. 3 Fulnes of ioy. Psal. 16. 4 Immediate fruition and coniuncti∣on with God. 1. Cor. 13. 12. 5 Eternity of happines, and bliffe for euermore. . Pet. 1 4. All these hath the Sonne of God pur∣chased for vs. The meanes whereby all these are made ours,The appli∣cation of this bene∣fit by Faith. is Faith. This Faith is wrought in vs by the preaching of the word. Rom. 10. 17. And that first of the Law. First, Discouering our miserie, vn∣to
vs in particular, both 1 From what a blessed estate wee are fallen, Roman. 3. Roman. 7. as also Into what a woful and desperate condition we are now plunged, not onely by reason of our sinne: Being able to doe nothing but displease God. Gen. 6. 5. And that in regard 1 Of the transgression of Adam, which lies vpon vs. Rom. 5. 2 The fruite of this transgressi∣on, euen a generall infection and corruption of all the powers and faculties of soule and body. 1 Of the vnderstanding, filled with blindnes, & darknes & not sa∣uoring the things of God. Eph. 4 17 2 The Conscience wounded, sea∣red, defiled, neuer soundly peace∣able. Timot 4. 1. Corinth. 1. 2: Esay 57. 1. 3 The memory fit to retaine e∣uill, and to forget good. Heb. 10 22. 4 The will captiuated to euill, and yet running headlong thereto, but to doe good altogether auerse. Rom. 8. 5, 6.
5. And so the affections ledde violently after the sway thereof, as also 6 The conuersation most loth∣some to God and man. 1. Tim. 1. 15. 7 The thoughts impotent and vnsatiable to euil, and infinite there∣in. 8 His best actions, greatest abomi∣nations. Pr. 28 9. Io. 9 3 Ps 50 16. A second part of mans misery, is the fruit of his inne, Namely; that First, He is most odious to God & most iustly accursed of him, Col. 1. 21. and this curse is manifest, First, Vpon his body by those feare∣full and inumerable plagues, di∣seass, iudgements of famine, &c. which he vpon men and consume thē in this life. Du. 28 15. Ge 3. 17. Secondly, By that horrible abuse of Gods blessings, which are bestowed on him: making the creature to grone vnder this bondage of cor∣ruption, and so to increase the score against the life to come. Rom. 8. 19. Secondly, Vpon his soule, and that st in this life:
1 In being giuen vp to a reprobate sense. Rom. 1. 23. 2 Depriued of the knowledge of God, but so farre as shall make him without excuse. Psalme 49. 15. 3 To be past feeling through the hardnes of his heart. Ephes. 4. 19. 4 Thence to fall into wofull and irrecouerable despaire, Gen. 4. and to discouer the same by madnes, blas∣phemies, &c. Secondly, In the life to come, by first: 1 Vtter separation from the presence of God, and happinesse for euer. 2. Thes. 1. 21. 2 Perpetuall communion with Sa∣tan and the infernall spirits: and so of all torments, Especially First, Desperate sorrow for an ir∣recouerable losse. Secondly, Insufferable waight of the wrath of God. Thirdly, Sensible torment, yet not to be expressed. Fourthly, The worme of conscience accusing, & gnawing continually. Fiftly, Bitter enuie at the happines of the elect.
Sixtly, Restles content, in this feare∣full condition. Thus the Law discouers to man his miser, and therefore, First, It is to be preached to sin∣ners. 2. Tim. 4. 2. Secondly, Men are to be acquain∣ted with the particulars of it. Thirdly, And to yeeld to the po∣wer thereof, that so it may leade them to Christ, who is properly re∣uealed vnto vs in the preaching of the Gospel, which doeth especially beget & perfect the worke of Faith, and that 1 By making vs to beleeue our misery, through a particular applica∣tion thereof vnto our selues. Rom. 7. 9. Rom. 15. 4. Matth. 9. 12. 2 By working anguish and sorrow inspirit for the same. Act. 2. 37. Ie∣rem. 21. 1. Iudg. 2. 3, 10. 3 Aduising what to do, Luk. 15. 17. Ierem. 8. , 7. and considering deep∣ly what we haue done. Reu. 7. 24. 4 Submitting to Gods will, to bee guided hereafter according to the same. Luk. 17. 9. Eze. 36. 2. Act. 9. 6. 5 Heereupon the Lord further
reueales himselfe vnto the sinner in working a secret desire of forgiuenes, from the consideration of the kind∣nes and readines of God to pardon, yea though it be but a droppe of mer∣cie. Luke 15. 17, 18. Mat. 12. 20. Mat. 11▪ 28. Mat. 5. 4. Matth. 9. 12. Luke 7. 38. Ion. 3. Hest. 4. Pro. 28. 9. Iob 33. 33. 6 This desire workes a resolution to go to this gracious God, though yet he feele not pardon for his sins. Luke 15. 7 Comming to God, sinne is con∣fessed in most conscionable, and in particular manner. Psal. 19. 12. 8 Pardon is most instantly and boldly begged for the same. Mat. 15. Rom. 10. 14. 9 Rsolution to renounce all, to buy this precious pearle: which is a kind of assurance of the purchase of this pardon, Mat. 13. vpon the due valu∣ation of the price of it, and so he pro∣miseth a full forsaking of the wold, Mat. 19. 29. Heb. 11 25▪ and vtter re∣nouncing of sinne, Hose. 14. 9. &c. for euer. Luke 19. 9. 1. Samu. 7. 3, 4. Pro. 28. Phil. 1. 7, 8,
10 Hereupon followeth an ap∣plication of Christ and his promises by the seale of the spirit. Rom. 8. 16. 2. Cor. 1. 22. And hence proceed: 1 Contentation spirituall, & peace with God and our owne consci∣ences. 2 Following the true Shepheard. Iohn 10. 3 Ioy in the Spirit, and sweetnes extraordinary. Rom. 5. 2. 4 Admiration heauenly, at this wonderfull worke. 2. Cor. 1. 12. 5 Tendernes of conscience in all our actions. Heb. 13. 18. 6 Boldnes to approch the throne of Grace. Rom. 8. Heb. 10. 7 A minde estranged from the world and loue thereof. Gal 5. 8 Holy conference, and asking the way to Sion. 9 Heauenly conuersation. Phi. 3. 20. 10 Readines and patience to and vnder the Crosse Rom. 5. 11 Desire to be dissolued, and to be with Christ. Phili. 1. 23. Thus is Faith wrought in vs, thus may we discerne the worke thereof. And this Faith is thus effectuall,
when it bringeth forth the fruite of an holy life, whereby we are made partakers of the diuine nature, & so made meet to that happines, where∣into no vncleane thing shall enter. Iā. 2. 2. Pet. 1. 3. Col. 1. 11. Reu. 21. 27. Hence we may learne: 1 That there is no holinesse in na∣ture, and therefore no happines from thence. Rom. 3. 9. 2 Our righteousnes is of faith, lay∣ing hold on Iesus Christ. Phil. 3. 9. 3 Being redeemed by Christ, we must be zealous of good workes, which God hath ordained vs to walke in. Ephes. 2. 10. 4 That we may not erre in wel∣doing, nor be weary therof, we must haue a Guide to direct vs therein. Iohn 11. 9. CHAP. II. This Guide is onely the perfect word of God. 1 BEcause it is the briefe of Gods reuealed wil.The word the guide of this di∣rection. Ps 40. 7. 2 It reacheth not only to the out∣ward, but inward man also, and is a discerner of the secret thoughts and
raines. Heb. 4. 12. 3 It is that will of God, which the Lord would haue to this end communicated vnto all. Colos. 1. 6. Iohn 5. 35. 4 It is sufficient and absolutely per∣fect to accomplish whatsoeuer con∣cernes our entrance or perfection to eternall life. 2. Tim. 3. 16. 5 It is a sure and euerlasting word, able to accomplish that which it promiseth or threatneth, and giuing grace to performe that in some mea∣sure which it enioyneth. Ephe. 6. 17. 1. Pet. 1. 2. Pet. 1. 19. Psal. 19. 7. Psal. 119. 93. 6 It is most plaine and easie to be apprehēded, as being a light shining in a dark place. 2. Pe. 1. Pr. 8. 2. 2. Cor. 4. 4. Hence it followeth 1 That whatsoeuer is not war∣ranted by the word, is sinne. Apoc. 22. 18. Deut. 4. 2. Pro. 30. 6. 2 That the Law of nature writ∣ten in our hearts, is no sufficient rule of life. 1. Cor. 2. 14. Matth. 16. 17. Rom. 2. 12. 3 Much lesse the Lawes of nations
are perfect rules to liue by. Deu. 4. 6. 4 No wil-worship is accepted of God. Mat. 15. 9. Col. 2. 2 3. Deu. 12. 8. 5 Neither a good intention makes a good action, 2. Sam. 6. 6. 6 Nor an erroneous conscience ex∣cuseth an euill fact, or maketh that which is doubtful good. Rom. 14. 23 7 No not ignorant deuotion a∣uiales in Gods worship. Rom. 10. 2. Acts 13. 5, 51. 8 Much lesse the lawlesse lusts of our hearts, which tend to the de∣struction of life. Ephes. 1. 22. 9 Neither is the multitude a iusti∣fiable warrāt of our actions. Ex. 23. 10 No not the examples of any, further then they square with the word. 1. Cor. 11. 1. 11 Neither the word it selfe in the letter, but in the spirituall meaning thereof. Matt. 5. 12 And the meaning of the word to befetcht not from any other but the Word, comparing spirituall things with spirituall things. 1. Cor. 2. 13. 13 Yea, the true meaning must be applied by faith before our actiōs can be warranted thereby. Rom. 14.
So doth the word containe a perfect di∣rection of our life. CHAP. III. THis direction is a daily and con∣stant endeuour to serue God.What this direction is, namely to serue God day∣ly and constant∣ly. And that 1 Because the Lord requires such a daily and constant course. Philip. 3. 15. Gen. 17. 1. Iob. 1. 5. 2 The Lord giues grace and ap∣points meanes for the performance thereof, as the continuall inhabita∣tion of his spirit, and the fruit there∣of the holy seede that remaines in vs. 1. Ioh 3 8. 3 The Saints of God haue practised such a course. Psa. 1. 4 To this end were we redeemed, that we should serue God in holines and righteousnes all the daies of our life. Luk. 1. 5 God doth daily bestow blessings vpon vs, therefore we must daily serue him. Lam. 3. 23. Psal. 103. 2. 6 Christ Iesus maketh continuall intercession for vs: that we should daily, yea hourely and continually
performe acceptable seruice vnto God. 7 Satan is neuer weary of tempting vs: therefore we should haue our loines girt, and be alwaies vpon our watch to resist him. 1. Pet. 5 8. 8 We haue not a daies warrant, no not an houres certainty of life, there∣fore we are at no time to be vnpre∣pared, because we know not the houre when our master commeth. Math 24. 9 We are pilgrimes and trauellers in this world, and therefore we must trauaile each day homeward to our country Hebr. 11. 12. 10 By our calling we are watch∣men, souldiers, &c. and therefore we must daily bee excercised in this spirituall warre fare. 2. Timo thie 2. 6. Hence it followeth, 1 That to fancie any such ser∣uice out of the word, which is not daily and constant is sinne. Ho∣sea. 6. 4. 2 To thinke that the seruice of the Sabbath is all that God requireth, is also sinne. Esai 1. 13.
3 It is in vaine to serue God a randome and not in an holy an constant order. 4 To put off the seruice of Go to the end of our life is most pre∣sumptuous. Psal. 95. 7. 5 To thinke I haue any liberty o time to serue sinne is Atheistica 1. Pet. 4. 2. Ephe. 5. 16. 6 That it is not wil-worship performe this seruice, seeing it warranted by the word. 7 That it is no nouelty to seru God after this manner. 8 Neither is it precisenes to our selues hereunto, seeing it is re∣uealed and therefore belongs vnt vs. Deuter. 29. 29. Ephe. 5 15. Therefore that we may serue God accor∣ding to his word we must performed and continuall obedience to him. Colos. 1. 10. CHAP. IIII.What this daily course is, namely a constant purpose to serue God. ANd this is, first a purpose of th hart, to serue God, as God: wholy and continually. Heb. 13. 18. 2 This purpose is setled and ro∣ted
in the heart, and bringeth forth some constant fruite of obedience euery day. Col 1. 23. Col. 7. 23. 3 It is also sincere, and generall, hauing respect vnto all Gods com∣mandements, in all things desirous to please him daily, & to be fruitfull in euery good worke. Psal. 119. 6. Colos. 1. 10. Fourthly, it respects the ends, which are two: 1 Gods glory, not any worldly or vaine respects. 1. Cor. 10. 31. 2 The eternal saluation of my soule, not any transitorie or outward bles∣sing. Phil. 3. 8. 1. Pet. 1. 9. 5 It enioynes these so farre as God shall inwardly enable, and out∣ward meanes permit, rather to put vs in mind what we should be, then what we can be in this life. 1. Cor. 8. 12. Hence it followeth, First,Sect. 1. This course to be known though impossi∣ble to be keept. that though this course were impossible, yet were it necessarie to be knowne, and indeauored of vs. 1 That it might be a daily rule of our life. 2 That it might continually humble vs vnder the mightie hand
of God. 3 That it might daily driue vs to Christ. 4 That it might weane vs from th world, and fit vs to eternall happi∣nesse. Hence it followeth Secondly,Sect. 2. It is not impossible That it is not impossib in some good measure, to keepe suc a course and trade of holines: 1 Because it presumes not abso∣lute perfection; which indeede we folly for any to dreame of in th life, but is only a following hard the marke, and furtherance to perfe∣ction. Phil. 3. 13. 2 It is no harder a taske, the what the Saints of God doe desi to attaine, Psal. 90. 12. haue volunta∣rily vndertaken, and in most comforta∣ble measure performed. Gen. 5. 22. 3 It may stand well with our or∣dinarie callings. 1. Tim. 4. 8. 4 Neither doeth it exclude our lawfull comforts. 2. Tim. 4. 8. Hence it followeth: Thirdly,Sect. 3. It is neces∣sarie. That it is no more th needes must to take this course: 1 Because hereby we shew our
selues obedient to Gods commande∣ment. Gen. 17. 1. Secondly, We doe also approue the soundnes of our obedience: as 1 That it is hearty, not hypocri∣ticall. 2 Not by halfes, but generall. 3 Not temporary, but continuall. 4 Not indifferent, but conscio∣nable. 5 Not enforced, but free & cheere∣full. Deut. 28 47. 6 Not vncertaine, but constant. 7 Not carnall, but spirituall. Thirdly, Heereby wee encrease in righteousnes and holines: as being First, Confirmed in well doing, and that 1 By the knowledge of our hea∣ly thrift. 1. Thes. 4. 10. Mat. 25. 16. 2 Thankfulnesse vnto God for it. 3 Commending the successe to God. 4 Crauing his further supplie. Secondly, Recouered also we shall be out of euill: 1 By seeing our escapes. Ieremie 3. 13.
2 Iudging them. 1 Cor. 11. 32. 3 Denying our selues. Mat. 16. 4 Casting our selues vpon Christ Matth. 11. Fourthly, Hereby also our outward callings are furthered, as 1 Being sanctified by this spiritu∣all exercise. 1. Tim. 4. 5. 2 Moderated, lest we be drunken with them. Deut. 17. 18. 3 Ordered to the right end, lest they misleade vs. 1. Cor. 10. 31. 4 Seasoned, lest we be weary of them. 5 Blessed, in seeing a happy re∣turne by them. Psal. 128. Hence it followeth: Fourthly, that this duety is most conuenient for all sorts. Both for all persons, aswell 1. babes in Christ, as 2. strong men. And for all estates, as well in pro∣sperity as in aduersity. First, For babes in Christ: that 1 They may beginne well. 2 They may goe forward with∣out griefe, vncertainty, wearisomnes. 3 That they may obtaine a more glorious crowne.
Secondly, For strong men and that 1 To keepe them constant from backsliding. Colos. 2. 7. 2 To make them more able to winne and hold others. Rom. 14. 1. 3 To acquaint them with the deepenes of Satan. Apoc. 2. 24. 4 To prepare them to greater glory. Dan. 12. 3. 5 To humble them in the sense of their extraordinary graces. 2. Cor. 12. Thirdly, it is fit for men in prospe∣rity: and that 1 To preuent security. Esai. 5. 12. 2 To humble them in regard of those temporall things. Luc. 12. 48. 3 To teach them how to vse them to Gods glorie, their owne and their neighbours good. 1. Tim. 6. 17. 4 That they may part with them willingly. Pil. 4. 12. 5 That all may be counted as dung in respect of heauen. Phi∣lip. 3. 8. Fourthly, this practice also will be very necessary in the time of affliction: And that
1 To prepare vs thereunto. Pro, 28. 14. Iob 3. 25. 2 To qualifie the sharpenes of it. 3 To be conquerors in our trou∣bles and ouer them. Rom. 8. 4 To be deliuered finally from them. Psal. 34. And therefore though doe what wee can,Sect. 4. And pro∣fitabe. some corruptions shall still re∣maine, yet this labour is not vnprofi∣table: 1 Because God accepts herein the purpose of our hearts. 2. Cor∣rinth. 8 12. 2 The Lord will haue some in∣firmities still left in vs to humble withall. . Cor. 12. 3 Our hatred of sinne shall bee perfited hereby, though it remain in vs. 4 The strength of sinne shal also much be abated in vs. 5 Our edge to eternall happines shall be still sharpened, and ou de∣sire enflamed to fit vs thereto. Rom. 7. Neither is this labour vncomforta∣ble,Sect 5. And plea∣sant. For,
1 We encrease hereby an assu∣rance of our saluation.The bene∣fite of constant godlines, and there∣in the Priuiledge of Chri∣stians. 2. Peter 1. 9. 10. 2 Wee grow more setled, and resolued in godlinesse, and get the masterie of inconstancie. Ephes. 3. 18. 19. 3 We performe holy duties more easily. Ps. 119. 32. Ioh. 4. 34. Mat. 11. 24. 4 We haue more neere & sweete fellowship with our blessed God, and his holy spirit 1. Tim 4 10. Mat. 10. 30. Ps. 1. 3. Rom. 8. 31. Ps. 2. 12. 5 We preuent many noysome lusts which otherwise would fasten on vs. Psalme 119. 10. 11. Iohn 15. 15. Exod. 19. 5. Pro. 19. 23. 6 We are freed from many tem∣porall iudgements which vnstaied soules are subiect to. Psalme 91. 11. Psal. 32. 10. 11. 7 Our score shall be the lesse, and our reckoning more easie at the day of iudgement. 8 Hereby wee shall haue our conuersation in heauen. Philip. 3. 21. 9 Our heart and the inordinate lusts thereof shall be keept at a bay.
10 We shall be armed against all temptations, and secured in the midst of them. Ephes. 6. 13. 11 We shall be weaned from the loue of this wretched world. 12 Yea led forward constantly to obtaine the end of our faith, which is the saluation of our soules. Ephes. 6. 2. Tim. 4. 13 We shall approue our selues not to be of the world by our con∣trary fashion to it. Rom. 12. 14 We shall recouer our first Image, in being holy as God is holy. 1. Pet. 1. 15 And readie to meete our Sa∣uiour whensoeuer hee shall come. Ephes. 6. Math. 24 25. &c. 16 We shall see our daily weak∣nesse and inability to serue God, and so acknowledge vnfainedly our vnworthines of the least mercies, and so happily preuent spirituall pride. 17 We gaine hereby a certaine knowledge of our estate in grace, and by the light hereof we know whither we walke. 1. Iohn 3. 1. 18 Wee shall be raised vp from
our fals into sinne. 1. Ioh. 2. 2. 19 Wee shall vse prosperity a∣right. Iob 3. 1. 24. Ier. 8. 4. 6. 20 And ouercome all troubles. Rom. 8. 36. 21 Yea we shall be fitter to win others. Gal. 6. 1. 22 And so grow forward to perfection. Col. 1. 9. Ioh. 7. 52. 23 And happily be continued to the end. CHAP. V. IT being now apparent that there is a daily sacrifice of obedience to be per∣formed vnto God:What are the parti∣culars of this daily sacrifice. And that it is nei∣ther impossible nor vnprofitable, but very necessary, fit and behoosefull vn∣to vs; let vs consider further these two points: 1 What duties we are necessa∣rily bound in conscience to per∣forme daily. 2 How we are to entertaine the seuerall occasions of the day as v∣sually they fall out, in this holy and constant manner.
CHAP. VI. That which we are necessarily bound to doe daily, is FIrst to bee humbled before the Lord in the sense of our owne1 To be hum∣bled be∣fore the Lord in the sense of our sinnes. or others sinnes by true and vnfai∣ned repentance. And that because, 1 The best seruice we shall doe must be sanctified by repentance. 2 Hereby we giue glorie vnto God, and offer a daily sacrifice ac∣ceptable vnto him. Psal. 51. 18. 3 Hereby wee deny our selues and daily take vp our crosse. Math. 16. 4 We approue our right and e∣state in Christ Iesus in that we con∣fesse our selues to be sinners and such as haue daily neede of his mer∣cie, and so daily fit our selues vnto the same. Math. 11 28. 5 Wee iustifie the truth of our religion against all the imaginarie perection of Popery, and securitie, of Libertines and Atheists whom∣soeuer,
and so do daily giue an ac∣count of our faith. 1. Pet. 3. 15. Now this dutie is conscionably performed,Sect. 1. Practice of repen∣tance. First, By taking a strict view and account of them by the glasse of the law. Psal. 19. 11. Secondly, by mourning before the Lord in the sense of them, not so much for feare of the punish∣ment, as that we haue offended so good a God. Luke 15. 21. Thirdly, by acknowledging our sinnes vnto the Lord. Prou 28. 13. and that, 1 From the fountaine, originall sinne. Psal. 51. 5. 2 From the streames; both our thoughts so fare as we may, our idle words, and prophane actions. Psal. 19. 12. 13. And here both, 1 What good we haue omitted. 2 What uil we haue cōmitted. 3 How we haue sinned of igno∣rance. Psal. 73 22. 4 How of knowledge we haue transgresed, &c. Especially and more particularly we must acknowledge, 1 The sinnes we haue bin sub∣iect
to. Psalme 51. 14. 2 Those which for the presen we grone vnder. 3 Those which we feare most. Psal. 19. 13. 4 The sinnes of our fathers. Ne∣hem. 9. 5 The sinnes of the Land and State among whom we liue. Dani∣el 9. 6 Yea, such as in particular wee knowe not, we are notwithstan∣ding to yeeld vp to bee searched by the Lord; and by his mercie either to be brought to our remem∣brance, or to be gratiously passed ouer. Psal. 19. 12. Fourthly, Sinne being thus ac∣knowledged, wee must further proceede to a detestation thereof, Iob 42. and of our selues for the same. Fiftly, Then we must feele them a burthen which wee are not able to beare. Act. 2. 37. Psal., 8. 4. Lastly, Wee must flie vnto Iesus Christ, by faith to be eased of this bur∣then. Matth. 11 28. Helpes hereunto, are
1 The due contemplation of the Maiesty of God,Sect. 2. Helps to this pra∣ctise. whom we haue so highly offended. Psalme 51. 4. 2 The vilenes and abiectnes of man, that durst commit such wic∣kednes against God. 3 The danger that he hath in∣curred hereby, euen all the plagues that are written in Gods booke, Deut 29. 27. 4 The riches of Gods mercie, in prouiding so excellent a remedie against sinne, as the pretious blood of his onely and deerely beloued Sonne, when nothing in the world was auaileable thereunto. 1. Peter 1. 5 The excellencie of our estate in Iesus Christ, with the manifold priuiledges and benefits thereof. 1. Iohn 3 1. 6 Our vnthankfulnes against the blood of the Couenant, in not wal∣king worthy of the same. Ephes. 4. 1. 7 The danger heereof, to haue made the same, so much as lieth in vs, of none effect. Heb. 10. 8 That we haue grieued Gods holy Spirit Ephe. 4 30.
9 And dulled, if not quenched the graces of God in vs. 1. Thessa∣lo.Sect. 3. Markes of repen∣tance. 5. 19. Markes of true repentance, are 1 Refusing carnal comforts more then ordinarily. Ionah 3. 6. Esai. 64. 6. 3 Desire to bee more vile. 1. Tim. 1. 13. 15. 3 Mourning and complaining of hardnes of heart. Esai. 63. 17. 4 Sorrow for the sins of others. Dan. 9. Ezec. 9. Psal. 119. 136. 5 Trembling at the word, and yet louing the sharpest blowes thereof. Psal. 119. 120. 6 Submiting our selues to Gods chastisements. Psal. 39. 9. Mich. 7. 9. 7 Labouring the conuersion of others. Psal. 51. 17. 8 Shame of humane society. Ezech. 16. 61. 9 Feare of the wrath of God. Psal. 119. 120. 10 Strong cries for mercie. Ioel. 2. 17. 11 Feare of the occasions and hatred of all apparance of euill. 1. Thessa. 5. 22. 1. Tim. 5. 14. Iude. 23.
12 Pouerty of spirit in regard of sinne all our life long. Math. 5. 3. 2. Ephes. 3. 12.Sect. 4. Effects of repen∣tance. The effects and benefits hereof, are 1 We shall cut off custome in sinne, and preuent security in the same. Math. 26. 41. 2 Our feare of God shall be en∣creased, and so the rage of sinne a∣bated Psal. 119. 133. 3 Selfe loue shall bee weakned and happily subdued. 4 The sandie foundation of na∣tuere shall be discouered, and wise∣ly abandoned. om. 3. 9. 20. 5 An holy despaire of our selues procurd. 6 Our hunger after Christ Ie∣sus more sharpned and encrea∣sed. 7 The heart exceedingly eased of a most grieuous burthen. Psalme 32. 4. 5. 8 Yea the very bodie much quieted and maintained in health. Psal. 32. 5.
CHAP. VII. THE soule being thus humbled,Of the rai∣sing vp of a sinner by a true and liuely faith must be raysed vp againe by a true and liuely faith: and this is the second duety daily to be performed: and that 1 Because our former humiliati∣on without this raising vp, wil either driue vs to despaire, or else make our life most vncomfortable vnto vs. Gal. 2. 20. Phil. 3. 2 Because nothing will prosper in the day without this comfort, neither our desires for what wee want, nor our vse of that we haue. 3 By this we truely liue the life of grace, and so haue our conuersa∣tion here in heauen. 4 Hereby also we die daily, and so are fitted vnto glory. Col. 1. 11. 5 That so whatsoeuer beide vs, this may be sufficient for vs. 2. Cor. 12. Now wee are raised vp by faith to the certaine assurance of the forgiue∣nes of our sinnes,Sect. 1 How faith is reuiued in vs. after this manner: First, by reuiuing and encreasing of our knowledge, that Iesus Christ
is the alone propitiatiō for our sins. This is performed, 1 By a serious meditation on the promise of the Messiah. Iohn 3. 16. 2 By exercising our selues more conscionably in the reading, and hearing of the word taught. Iohn 5. 39. Secondly, Faith is quickned by reuiuing our apprehension of the promise; and this is done, 1 By earnest prayer vnto God for the renuing of his Spirit in vs. Psal. 51. 12. 2 By an hearty acknowledge∣ment, that wee haue iustly grieued the Spirit of God, and so are deser∣uedly depriued of the feeling ther∣of. Psalme 51▪ 4. Lamentation 3. 22, 37. 3 Meditating of our former com∣fort and assurance heerein. Psalme 77. And this reuiuing hath many degrees. First,Sect. 2. The de∣grees of this work. A liuely sense what need I haue of Christ, and that without him I must certainely perish. Rom. 7. 24, 25.
Secondly, Hope of pardon, wher∣by though wee yet feele not our sinnes certainely pardoned, yet wee beleeue that they are pardonable; not in respect of themselues, as if they were lesse heynous, but in re∣spect of God, whose mercies are a∣boue them. Esay 1. 18. Thirdly, An hungring and thir∣sting after grace offered in Iesus Christ. Ioh. 6. 35, 7, 37. Reu 21. 6. And this is discerned, 1 By our prizing and preferring it aboue all other comforts. Philip. 3. 2 By our fainting and languish∣ing after it Psal. 42. 3 By our strong cries and ende∣uours for the same. Psalme 51. 12, 13. &c. Fourthly, Wee approch to the thone of grace, and flying from the terrour of the law, we take hold on Christ, and find fauor in God. Heb. 4. 16. Heb. 10. 19. And this is performed: 1 By an humble confession of thy sinne in particular, whereupon followeth a full remission of them.
Psalme 32. 5. 2 Crauing pardon of some spe∣ciall sins, with vnspeakeable sighs & perseuerance. Lu. 15. 21. Act. 8. 21. Fiftly, Hereupon followeth a par∣ticular perswasion imprinted in the heart by the holy Ghost, wherby e∣uery faithfull man doth particular∣ly applie vnto himselfe those promi∣ses which are made in the Gospell. Mat. 9. 2. Mat. 15. 28. Psal. 143. 12. This perswasion is discerned by these markes:Sect. 3. The markes of particular assurance. 1 It goes before experience, Mat. 15. 23. & so our faith is supernatural & contrary to all reason. Heb. 11. 1. 2 It holds beyond experience. Iob 13. 15. Heb. 11. 1. and is aboue all feeling. 3 And neuer leaues vs till wee haue obtained the end thereof, which is the saluation of our soules. Pet. 1. 9. This perswasion hath these degrees:Sect. 4. The de∣grees ther∣of. First it takes hold weakely,Weakenes of Faith. not without doubting, and yet soundly and truely, so that it is accepted of God. Luke 17. 5. Mat. 8.
And it is discerned, 1 By an earnest desire and en∣deauour to obtaine Gods fauour.How knowne. Math. 5. 6. 2 By a continuall complaining of our vnbeleefe, and mourning for it. Marc. 9. 24. 3 By an earnest striuing against it, in vsing all good helps, as prayer, the word, conference, &c. Math. 8. 25. Luke 17. 5. This weakenes proceedes, 1 From want of knowledge in the mystery of saluation.How cau∣sed. Rom. 14. 2. Math. 16. 16. Ioh. 6 6. 2 For want of application to our selues of the particular promise. 2. Tim. 1. 12. 3 For want of obseruation and entertainment of such comforts as haue beene offered vnto vs. Math. 16. 8. 9. 2. Tim. 4. 17. And it is caused by, 1 Withdrawing the light of Gods countenance. Psal 30. 6. 2 Some grosse sinne committed. Psal. 51. 3 Meanes neglected, as the word, prayer, &c. Iohn. 20. 24.
4 Some spirituall pride in the heart. 2▪ Cor. 12. 5 Want of constancie and set∣lednes in religion. Galat. 1. 6. 2. Thes. 2. 2. Secondly,Sect. 5. Strength of faith. Faith takes hold strong∣ly and fully perswades the heart, that God loueth me, that Christ is mine, and all things with him. Rom. 4. 22. Rom. 8. 38. And it is discerned. 1 By cheerefulnes in troubles:How knowne. and so in all occasions. Rom. 5. 3. 2 Boldnes in the cause of God. Act. 5. 3 Wisedome in our Christian callings. Ephes 3. 4 Crucifying our selues to the world, and the world to vs. Gal∣lath. 5. 5 Preparation to suffer. Act. 21. 6 Desire & longing after death. 1. Phil. 22. And it is obtained, 1 By constancy in our callings.How ob∣tained. 2 Combatting with many trou∣bles, especially those of our owne vnbeleeuing hearts. Luc. 22. 32. 3 Comforting others and rai∣sing
vp afflicted consciences. 1. Phil. 2 Cor. 1. 4. 4 By long experience of Gods fauor and loue in many deliueran∣ces. Psal. 23. 5. 5 By ripenes & dexterity in the meanes: as power in prayer, the word, &c. Ephes. 6. 18. 6 Daily examining and trying our selues. Psal. 4. 34. 7 Renouncing the especiall sinne which hangeth so fast vpon vs He. 12. 1. 8 Renuing daily our couenant with God, & charging it afresh vp∣on our harts to constancie. CHAP. VIII. AND this is the third duety daily we must performe,The pre∣paring and furnishing the heart to the ser∣uice of God. namely; to re∣nue our vowes, and stire vp our hearts to the seruice of God. 1 Because the hart is that which God principally delights in. Prou. 23. 26. 2 The heart is the fountaine of euery action, if it bee clensed, the actions will be sutable. Luke 8.
3 The infirmity of the action shall not be imputed, if the heart be ordered aright. 2. Corinthians 8. 12. 4 As the bodie sleepes, so the heart sleepes too, and therefore the one must be awaked as the other. Esay 29. 10. Now the heart may be cast into a sleepe. 1. Thess. 5. 6.Sect. 1. The heart asleepe, & by what meanes. 1 By ignorance of it selfe. Ephes. 5. 14. 2 By selfeloue, and ouerweening of it owne perfections. 3 By neglecting the meanes. 4 By corrupt meanes in steade of the pure fountaines. 5 By the ceasing of Gods Spirit to worke. 6 By some grosse sinne commit∣ted. 2. Sam. 11. 7 By security in prosperitie and sinne. 8 By presumption of Gods mer∣cies or it owne merits. Matthew 26. 33. 9 By stupiditie and senseles∣nesse. 10 By spirituall blindenesse and
hardnes of heart. The preparing of the heart hath these degrees: First, It must be awakened and roused vp,Sect. 2. The heart to be a∣wakened, and how. and that 1 By meditating. 1 What it was by nature. Ierem. 17. 9. Matth. 15. 19. 2 What it is now by grace. Ro. 6. 2. Ephes 4. 23. 3 How vnsearchable and endles agulfe it is. 1▪ Cor. 4 4. 2 By yeelding it vp to God, and ex∣posing it naked before him, and that 1 Both confessing its corruption, and deceitfulnes. 2 And also submitting it whol∣ly to his gouernment. 3 Reforming the occasions whereby it was laid asleepe, as 1 Ignorance, by the glasse of the word. Iam. 1. 25. 2 Selfe-loue, by viewing our selues in the glasse of the consci∣ence examined by the Law. Rom. 7. 8, 9. 3 vsing the meanes consciona∣bly. 4 Especially not closing with
corrupt meanes. 5 Renue the Spirit by vnfained repentance. Psal. 51. 10. 6 Forsake not onely grosse sins, but euen all, yea all apparance of sinne. 1. Thes. 5. 22. 7 Be we alwaies watchfull ouer our selues. Luk. 22. 8 Auoyde we presumption by meditation of Gods iustice. Iude 5. 6, 7. 9 Remedie wee stupidity by quicknes in apprehension, and for∣wardnes to iudge our selues. 1. Cor. 11. 31. 10 Breake we our hard hearts with the hammer of Gods word. Iere. 23. 29. 1. Cor. 9. 27. The heart being awakened, must be throughly sifted and exa∣mined,Sect. 3. The heart awakned, must be examined: And how. and that First,1. By a true rule. By a true rule. 1 Not by it selfe, but by the law of God. Heb. 4. 12. 2 Neither by the world, but by the conscience informed by the word. Ierem 6. 14. 3 Not by opinion, but by the e∣uidence of the Spirit. Roman. 8. 16.
Rom. 14. 5. Pro. 14. 12. 4 Neither by the lawes of men, but by the rule of faith. Matth. 15. 9. Acts 4. 19. 5 Neither by the letter of Gods Law, but by the spirituall meaning thereof. Mat. 5. 6 Not by the outward conditi∣on, but by the inward experience. Eccles 9. 1. Pro. 14. 13. 7 Neither by outward actions, but by inward purposes. Ierem. 17. 10. Io 2. 13. 8 Not by the examples of the most, but of the best. Luk. 18. 1. Cor. 11▪ 1. Secondly,2 By an holy man∣ner. Wee must examine the heart after a true and holy manner. Not once or seldome, but daily. Psal 119. Not slightly but seriously, euen from the bottome. Psal. 119. 12. Not on the one side, but on both, as well what euill we haue done as what good. Neither in generall, but in parti∣cular, concerning the chiefe good or euill. Psal. 51. And that not partially but con∣scionably
and indifferently, both concerning it weakenes and also it strength. Psal. 42. Thirdly, we must herein ayme at a right end:3 To a right end▪ 1 Not vaine glory, but the praise of God. 2 Neither for selfe-loue, but to denie our selues. 3 Not for loue of the world, but to the renouncing thereof. 4 Neither for feare of death, but to be prepared to it. 5 Not to remit of our sincerity, but to increase in holines. Psal. 119. 6 Not to preferre our selues be∣fore others, that are behind vs, but to be humbled in regard of those that haue out-stript vs. 7 Not to bee approued of the world, but to the conuincing or conuerting thereof. 8 Not to make vs distrust God, but to increase our cōfidēce in him. 9 And so to hunger more con∣stantly after him. The heart beeing thus tried and examined,Sect. 4. The heart examined, must be establi∣shed in the worship of God. must bee established and confirmed in the seruice of God.
Psal. 51. 12. Pro. 4. And that by these meanes: First,And how. by resigning it vp to the guidance of the almighty. Psal. 119. Secondly, by renuing our vows and binding vs to the performance of them. and that 1 By publicke protestation. 2 By solemne and conscionable oaths. 2. Chron. 15. 3 By the curse of the law. Ne∣hem. 10. 31. 4 Calling others to witnes, as the Church of God. Thirdly, wee must continually feare our selues, and haue a holy iealousie of our best actions. Pro∣uerb. 28. 14. And that in regard, 1 Of the vnsearchablenes of our hearts. Ier. 17. 9. 2 Of the priuie corruptions that doe assault vs. Psal. 19. 3 In respect of the infirmities that doe accompany our best acti∣ons. Iob 4. 18. 4 As also especially in regard of the presence of our gracious God beholding and approuing all our
actions. Psalme 33. 13. And this feare is discerned, 1 By an earnest striuing against our coruptions. 2 By a desire to approue our selues to the Church of God. 3 By tendernes of conscience in all our actions. 4 By lowlines in our carriage, e∣uen towards our inferiors. Fourthly, There must be a con∣stant watching ouer the outward man, auoyding both the occasions of euill, and the least appearance ther∣of. Psal. 39. 1. Iob 31. 1. Fiftly, We must moderate our selues in our Christian liberty, Gal. 5. 13▪ and that by these rules: 1 Of our callings, that wee ex∣ceede not them. 1. Corin 7. 20. 2 Of the times, that wee bring forth fruite in due season. Psalme 1. 3. 3 Of the place, that in outward things we conforme therto. 1. Cor. 9. 20. 4 Of the persons, that we giue no iust offence. 1. Cor. 10. 33. Here our guides must be:
Loue, which seekes not our own. 1. Cor. 13. Wisedome, to become all vnto all. 1. Cor. 9. And our ends, 1 Expediencie, that we may be fitting. 1. Cor. 10. 2 Vnder that which may bee seemely. Col. 2. 3 Edification, that which may benefit our selues and others. 1. Cor. 10. 4 And principally the glorie of Almightie God. 1. Cor. 10. 31. Sixtly, We must entertaine and cherish the motions of the Spirit of God. 1. Thess. 5. 19. 2. Tim. 1. 6. This is performed: 1 By a wise discerning of them. 1. Tim. 4. 14. 2 By an high esteeme of them. 3 By reioycing in them, as if we had found the greatest treasures. Mat. 13. 44. 4 By putting them speedilie in execution. Psal. 45. 1. 5 By offring vp an extraordina∣ry sacrifice of praise for them, a∣basing our selues in regard of such
excellent graces, and acknowledg∣ing the free mercy of God in so gra∣cious a fellowship. Psalme 116. 7, 12. Seuenthly, If the Spirit of God shall lie asleepe in vs Psal 119. This we shall discerne: 1 By great terrours in the con∣science. 2 A kind of loathing of holy du∣ties. 3 Great coldnes and deadnes in the vse of them. 4 Little sensible comfort when we haue performed them. Psal. 77. 2, 3. 5 Much discontentment in the mind, and blindnes in the same. Psa. 6. 3. 6 Aptnes to rush into the sinnes we haue heretofore conquered. 7 Vnwillingnes to die, &c. Here then we must at no hand blesse our soules in this estate, but First, rouse vp the Spirit, and labour to be quickned, and that by vsing the holy meanes: as 1 The Ministerie of the word.Powerfull. Psal. 6. 6.
2 Priuate and strong crying vn∣to God. Psal. 51. 3 Crauing the effectuall prayers of the saints. Iames 5. 15. 4 Vsing more conscionably their fellowships, and opening our state vnto them. 5 Racking our harts by a serious and impartiall examination, and committing our most speciall ten∣tations to record. 6 Promising more faithfulnes for the time to come. Psal. 80. 18. 7 And binding our selues more constantly to the conuersion of o∣thers. Psal. 116. 18. Psal. 32. 8. 9. Ps. 34. 3. 8. 11. 8 Exercising a daily course of repentance. 9 Not neglecting also to humble our selues in this behalfe in some priuate fast vnto God. Psal. 35. in our closets or families. Eightly, make we some experi∣ment vpon some chiefe lust of the heart to get the mastery ouer it for by an experimentall conquest ouer one, we shall learne in time to con∣quere all the rest.
And this must be done: 1 By obseruing the deepenes of Satan in his variety of baits, to draw vs into the snare. 2 Considering the deceitfulnes of the heart, how gladly it would close with Satan. 3 Remembring our former trip∣ping by the like tentation. 4 Thereupon confesse wee in humble prayer vnto God that wee haue deserued to be ouertaken with it. 5 Detest we our selues that sinne hath got such ground of vs. Iob 42. 6 Hereupon vow wee reuenge against our treacherous flesh. 2. Cor. 7. 11. 7 And practise wee the same by the former rules of humiliation, and such as hereafter shall bee laid downe. 8 And so being wise to feare our selues in regard of the said tentation we shall happilie get the conquest of it. Prou 14. 9 Wee must daily recount how wee haue profited in godlinesse.
Psal. 119. 10 we must prepare our selues continually to afflictiōs. Luk. 9. s 23. 11 Wee must bee plentifull in good workes. 2. Pet. 1. 9. 12 In all our actiōs, specially ex∣traordinary we must not trust to that soundnes of heart which hath beene, but trie them by that which is, that so from the sense of the purenes of the fountaine the streames may flow more certaine∣ly and purely. Luke 6. 43. Mat. 13. 13 Though the heart may ap∣peare to be sound, yet the goodnesse of the action must not so much de∣pend vpon the soundnes of the heart appearing, as vpon the free mercies of God accepting the same. 14 We must prouide a complet armour for the heart, being prepa∣red to preserue it. Ephes. 6. 13. CHAP. IX. And this is the fourth duty of necesssity to be performed daily by vs:Of the spirituall armor, and ar∣ming of the heart. Name∣ly to arme our hearts against all tenta∣tions. And that, 1 Because such an armour is commended vnto vs in the word.
Ephes. 6. 2 Our enemies are mighty prin∣ces and armed wickednesses. E∣phes. 6. 16. 3 The heart without it lies open to all tentations. 4 By it we shall be able to cast downe all strong holds. 2. Cor. 10. 4 which stand in our way to happi∣nes. 1. Tim. 6. 11. 5 And so shall lay hold on eter∣nall life, and finish our course with ioy. 2. Tim. 4. 6. Here consider these three points: 1 What this armor is. 2 How it is to be put on. 3 How to be kept on. This armo hath many peeces.Sect. 1. The parts of the spi∣rituall ar∣mor and, 1. of the gir∣dle of truth It parts are: First, the Girdle of truth and sin∣cerity. Ephes. 6. 14. & this consisteth of these parts: The first is a rectified iudgment proceeding from an illightned and sanctified vnderstanding, wrought by a liue faith through the word of God. Ephes. 4. 13. And it hath these properties:Sect. 2. 1 A re∣ctified iudgemēt. 1 It is sound in what it knowes. Coloss. 1. 6. 9.
2 It retaineth safely what it knowes. Psal. 119. 11. 3 It is wise to distinguish be∣tweene things that differ, Philip. 1. and so to trie the Spirits. 1. Iohn 4. 1. 4 It discernes all things. 1. Cor. 2. 15. 5 It comprehends the height, and bredth, and depth, and length. Ephes. 3. 6 It knows no man after the flesh. 2. Cor. 5. 16. 7 It knowes but in part, and so is subiect to errour. 1. Cor. 13. 8 It is not obstinate in errour, but willing to be reformed in what it hath beene misinformed. 2. Tim. 2. 16. 9 It is apt and desirous to re∣ceiue further illumination. Colos. 1. 10 2. Tim. 3. 7. 10 And daily increaseth in this sauing knowledge.How put on. Heb. 5. 12. Helpes to put on this armour, are 1 A discerning of our owne in∣ward blindnes. Psal. 119. 28. 2 A daily meditation in the word and workes of God. Psal. 1.
3 A faithful recording, and com∣paring of things past with things present; and so collecting for the time to come. Luk. 2. 51. And this part of the Girdle serueth: 1 To condemne the blindnes of nature.The bene∣fit thereof. 1. Corint. 2. 14. Matthew 16. 17. 2 To discerne between the light of nature and grace, the illightning and sanctifying Spirit. Col. 1. 9 E∣phes. 5. 8. 3 To direct all our actions: for as we know, so we doe. Rom. 14. 5, 23. 4 To make triall of them: for if they haue not the light, it is because there is no truth in them. Ioh. 3. 21. 5 To informe and instruct o∣thers. Psal. 34. The second part of this Girdle is,Sect. 3. The san∣ctified cōscience, and how discerned▪ a sanctified conscience: and it is discerned 1 By this; that it excuseth for al sinnes, as our persons are accepted in Christ. 1. Cor. 4. 4. 2 It checkes for the least sinne, before actuall repentance bee per∣formed. 1. Iohn 5. 17.
3 It approues our vpright wal∣king in the whole course of our life. Acts 23. 1. Psal. 26. 1. 4 It procures vs peace with God. Rom. 5. 1. and with men so far as it is possible & expedient. Ro. 12. 18. 5 It breedes contentment in the life & al occasions. Phil. 4. 12. 6 It procures cheerfulnes in the countenance, and readines in al our busines. Pro. 28. 1. 7 It makes vs couragious in the truth, and willing by all meanes to defend the same. Acts 4. 13. Acts 6. 15. Acts 18. 26. 8 It maks vs victorious in trou∣bles, and 9 Ready to yeeld vp our liues in∣to the hands of God.How put on. Act. 21. 23. And it is put on and preserued, 1 By making conscience of all things commanded. Psal. 119. 6. 2 By keeping it tender and sen∣sible of the least euill. Heb. 13. 18. 3 To this end view we it daily in the glasse of the word, that so the iudgment may be kept cleer to pre∣uent security. 4 Examine we, and censure the
daily errors thereof by calling it be∣fore the Lord, to auoyde spirituall blindnes. 5 Auoyd wee aboue all things, doubtfulnes, and distraction in our actions. Rom. 14. 5. 6 Especially keepe we our selues frō wilful fighting against the light therof, in committing grosse & pre∣sumptuous sinnes. Psal. 19. 12. 7 Haue we alwaies more regard of it in the sight of God, then of our credite with mē. 1. Cor. 4. 4. Ro. 2. 29 8 File we into the bosom ther∣of when outward things crosse vs. Acts 23. 1. 9 Rest we not so vpon the iusti∣fication thereof, but that we referre it to the mercie of God. 1. Cor. 4. 4. The benefit of this part of the Girdle is: 1 It procures & maintaines true inward ioy.The bene∣fit thereof. 2. Cor. 1. 12. 2 Hereby we haue alwaies bold∣nes before God. 1. Ioh. 3. 20. to ob∣tain good things at his hāds. He 10. 3 And are enabled and furnished against all the reproches and euils of men. Pro. 18.
4 By this we are alwaies cer∣taine of the things we doe, and the acceptance of them in the sight of God. Psal. 51. 6. Hereby we are comforted in the greatest buffetings of Satan, and our cowardly & vnbeleeuing hearts. 1. Iohn 3. 21. 6 And led along in most cheer∣full manner throughout all difficul∣ties to the receiuing of the reward. Heb. 11. 26. 7 We encrease in sanctificati∣on and holinesse. 1. Timothie 1. 18. 19. 8 We put to confusion the pride and practises of our enemies. 1. Sam. 26. 21. 9 We receiue hereby a pledge of eternall life, and haue our con∣uersation in heauen. Rom. 8. 16. Phi. 3. 20. A third part of this sincerity consists in the wil,Sect. 4. The sin∣cerity of the will. It markes. which discouers it selfe: 1 By cheerefulnes in weldoing, not by compulsion, but of a willing minde. 1. Cor. 9. 1. Pet. 5. 2 Resisting sinne and the occa∣sions
thereof. Psal. 119. 104. 3 Yeelding to sinne with griefe. Rom. 7. 15. 4 Rising by repentance out of the same. Pro. 28. 14. The state and measure hereof is:It measure 1 That it is not free to good or euill, but freed to doe good. Philip. 2. 13. 2 Yet so freed as that it is in bondage to sinne. Romanes 7. 18. 3 Yet so in bondage, as that it striues against that slauery, and gets daily ground thereof. Rom. 7. 25. Ephes. 2. 3. The benefit hereof is: 1 To enable vs to doe good.The bene∣fit thereof. Rom. 7. 18. 2 To comfort vs in our outward faylings. 2. Corinth. 8. 12. Rom 7. 19. 3 To discerne of our state in sanctification. Ephes. 2 3. 1. Corin. 12. 2. 4 To keepe our iudgements sin∣cere and vpright. 1. Tim 6 5. 5 To kindle and order our af∣fections in the seruice of God.
And this is a fourth part of this Gir∣dle,Sect. 5. The well ordering of the affe∣ctions, and how di∣scerned. euen the well ordering of our affe∣ctions. 1. Thess. 5. 23. Rom. 7. 24. Aud this is discerned: 1 By a right mouing of them to their proper obiects. Romanes 7. 22, 25. 2 By their contentment in the same. 3 In that we can more ioy or grieue for spirituall causes then for carnall. Psal. 4. Psal. 119. 4 That they tend to the crucifi∣ing of the flesh, and building for∣ward of the new man. Colossi. 3. 1. 5 That indeed by them we are wholly emptied in our selues in re∣spect of God. 2. Cor. 5. 16. Ge. 5. 22. Rom. 12. 1. Helpes hereunto are: 1 Knowledge of the right ob∣iect. Mark. 3. 5. 2. Cor. 7. 2 Weaning and abating them from the false. 1. Iohn. 2. 15. 3 Triall of our selues in the pra∣ctise of some one of our affections. Deut. 6. 5. 4 Conscience to vse them all in
their seuerall times and measure. Eccles. 3. 1. Rom. 12. 16. The benefit hereof, is, 1 We shal attaine hereby a gra∣cious conquest ouer our most vn∣ruly thoughts.The be∣nefit thereof. Ephes. 4 25. 2 Wee shall find much sweete peace & contentment in our Chri∣stian callings. 3 We shall be more readie prest to good actions. 2. Cor. 7. 4 And saued from many noy∣som tentations, which otherwise would assault vs. 2. Ephes. 4. 26. Iohn. 19. 12. 5 We shall haue gracious fellow∣ship with God. Col 3. 1. 6 And be better enabled to the conuersion of our brethren. Iohn 21. 15. A fift part of this Girdle is the sincerity of the tongue: As being the sterne of the shippe and the certaine Image of the mind.Sect. 6. The sin∣cerity of the tong. Wherein it is seene. Iam. 3. 5. And it is discerned: 1 In holy speech. Eccles. 3. 7. 2 In wise & seasonable silence. Concerning fit and warrantable Speech, we are to obserue:
1 Preparation to speech. 2 The matter of it. 3 The manner thereof. 4 The end of the same. We shall be prepared to Speech,Sect. 7. Of Speech. and, 1 Of the prepara∣tion to it. 1 By prayer to God to guide our tongue and that, because First, the Lord is the ruler of it. Prou. 16. 1. Secondly, By an holy considera∣tion of these things, 1 That wee are to speake in his presence. Psal. 33. 15. 2 That there is no liberty for i∣dle talke. Mat. 12. 36. 3 That all speech must tend to edification. Ephes. 4 29. 4 What the matter is, we mean to speake of. 5 That, what is once out cannot be recalled. 6 That we must giue an account for euery idle word. And thus we shall be prepared to Speake. Now The matter of our speech concernes either Persons,Sect. 8. The mat∣ter of speech. or Things. The per∣sons. 1 Almighty God & his workes.
2 Our neighbour, & what con∣cernes him. 3 Our persons and occasions: In our speech concerning our blessed God,Sect. 9. How to speake of God. we are to obserue these rules: 1 That wee take not the names of Gods Maiestie in our mouthes, but vpon most serious and waigh∣tie occasions. Exod. 20. 2 That in the occasion we find our hearts liuely affected with a true knowledge of holy reuerence of God, before whom we speake, and before wee vse his great and feareful name, lest otherwise though the cause be waightie, yet wee take it in vaine. 3 That we finde our selues cō∣forted, and established in our faith by taking of this great, and glorious name, as being hereby drawne ne∣rer vnto God, and setled more constantly in our loue of his Ma∣iestie. To this end vse not the name of God without some addition of his attributes, as the Liuing Lord, the Glorious God, My God, &c. Ephes. 1. 3.
4 Take we heede that the name of God become not ordinarie, and for custome. 5 Publish we the works of God not onely for the present, but to posterity Exod. 4. 26. Concerning our neighbor,Sect. 4. How to speake of our neighbor. our speech may be either good, or euill. If we are to speake good of our neigh∣bour, then we must doe it: 1 Cherefully, and vpon euery fit occasion. Luke 5. 29. 2 Wisely, rather in his absence then in his presence. 3 Indifferently, as well if he bee our foe as friend. 4 Constantly, maintaining the same testimony without any cor∣ruption or gaine-saying. 5 Truely, that wee giue him no more nor lesse then his due. 6 Charitably, if the matter bee doubtfull, rather with the better. 1. Cor. 13. 7. 7 Preserue wee his good name by answering for him in a case of slan∣der. 1. Sam 20. 32. 8 If he be fallen, raise wee him vp with the spirit of meeknes. Gal. 6. 1.
Here are to be auoyded these extreames: First,Sect. 15. What here to be auoyded. those that are in the defect: as 1 Deprauing of the actions of our brethren from the intent. Iob 1. 9. 11. as if we knew their hearts. 2 Extenuating of them in the measure. 3 Mistaking them in the quality, which is the common practise of the world to call good euill, and e∣uill good. Esay. 5. 19. 4 Outfacing and bearing men downe in ther sincerity, and if were possible to driue them from the same. Iob 4. 8. 11. &c. 5 Misiudging of it by the out∣ward euent. Iob 27. 6 Cōuincing thereof by false wit∣nesse and periurie. 1. Reg. 20. &c. 7 Disgracing spirituall gifts for want of natures complement. 1. Sam. 1. 14. Secondly, We must here take heede of the other extreame in the excesse: As 1 Commending them to their faces. 2 Ascribing that vnto them which is not theirs. Act. 12.
3 Yelding more vnto them in∣deede then is theirs. 4 Daubing vp their sinnes with vntempered morter. Eze. 13. as pre∣sumpton of Gods mercy or such like. 5 Crying peace, peace, and put∣ting farre off the euill day. Ier. 6. 6 Approuing them for the gifts of nature, though they be not sanctified. Pro 31. 30. 7 Flattering them as if what they had came by their owne in∣dustry. 8 Saying as they say, be it true or false. Mich. 2. 11. And thus is our speech to be ordered when we will speake good of our neighbour. If wee haue occasion to speake the contrary of him, let vs consider these bounds: First, wee must not speake what we certainly know not, but haue by reports, surmises, &c. We may speake that to himselfe which wee must not speake of him to another. Matt. 18. 15. Secondly, wee must not speake
all what we know: vnlesse we haue an especial calling hereunto: And that is, 1 When the Magistrate requires it. 2 When his case by admonish∣ment needs it. 3 When danger to others there∣by is preuented, as in case of mur∣ther, treason, &c. 2. King. 6. 8. Gen. 37. 2. Est: 2. Hence it followeth: First, That auricular confession is abominable, which bindeth to the concealement of such wickednes. Secondly, That it is sinne to dis∣couer where we are bound to con∣ceale. As in cases hereafter laid downe. Thirdly, We must not speake that of our neighbour which we know and is necessary to be knowne to all persons, as neither, To the weake, lest they stumble at it; nor to the wicked, lest they in∣sult in the infirmities of others. Gen. 8. 2. Sam. 1. Fourthly, Some may speak that euill of their brethren which it is not lawful for
others. As the Magistrate or Mini∣ster in reproouing of sinne may a∣base the persons with names sor∣ting with their sinnes. Galla. 4. 1. Matth. 3. which priuate men may nor doe. 5 If it be thought fit to mention the euill which we know by any man, here first it must bee done onely in a ge∣nerall manner, the person and all circumstances which will descrie the parson concealed. 1. Cor. 6. 11. 2. Sam. 12. 1. 6 The partie also in some cases may bee discouered, but yet with a double respect: First, if his sinne be of infirmitie, here wee may in some sort conceale the sinne. As 1 That it might bee mistaken in regard of the person. Actes 3. 17. 2 That the fact may bee mis∣reported and falsely conceiued &c. If we see the partie ashamed, and cast downe for his sinne, here wee are bound much more to couer it, And that 1 From God by harty praier, that it
may be forgiuen. Actes 7. Matth. 27. Secondly, From our selues, And that 1 By not taking notice of it wil∣lingly. 2 Not beleeuing it. 3 Interpreting it to the best. 4 Forgiuing it, if it be apparent. 3 We must also hide the sinne from the sinner. And that First, If we see him vnfit to be re∣proued. 1. Sam. 25. Secondly, If we see him suffici∣ently checked already by his con∣science, then we must also hide his sinne from him. And that 1 By opposing his contrary in∣tent. Act. 3. 17. Rom. 10. 2. 2 Comforting him, with his for∣mer course of holines. 3 From the occasion, that it was in his heat, or prouoked thereto in his defence. 4 From the qualitie, that it was in ignorance, not wilfulnes, infirmi∣tie, not presumption. 5 From Gods mercie, which is aboue all his sinne. Rom. 5. 20.
6 Age, that it was done in his youth. Psal. 25. 7. 7 The time of life, that yet there is hope to recouer. Psal. 95. 2. Tim. 2. 25. and that it was but the first in that kind. 8 From the examples of the Saints, the best of whom haue had their slips. Iam. 3. 2 Psal. 19. 9 From his person, opposing o∣ther good parts to counteruaile that euill. 1. Kin. 15. 5. Thus may we hide the sinne from the sinner, and thus also may we hide his sinne from the world. If the sinne be grieuous and cannot be excused, yet heere we must moderate our speech: 1 And prepare mercie for the party. 2 Acknowledge wee it might haue beene our case, if God should haue left vs, and so may be. Galat. 6. 1. 3 Intimating his sorrow and de∣testation of the fact, as the truth shal be. 2. Cor. 2. 6, 7. 4 Recounting circumstances that
induced thereunto, though not to excuse altogether, yet to diminish the same, or at least to make known the deceitfulnes of sinne. 5 Labour his outward release from the hope of the time to come. 6 Howsoeuer; commend his case to the Church in prayer, & al∣so in thy priuate vnto God. If the fact be such as must needes bee punished, yet here we are: 1 To lay it soundly to the con∣science of the offender, to bring him to repentance, that so the sinne may be killed in him. 1. Cor. 5. 5. 2 To raise him vp with the sweet comforts of the Gospel, that so though his body smart for it, yet his soule may be saued. 1. Iohn 1. 9. 1. Cor. 5. Thus are we to speake concer∣ning our neighbour:Sect. 13. How to speake of our selues, and Now concerning our selues, there are these rules: 1 Wee must neither praise nor dispraise our selues, but leaue it to another. Pro. 27. 2. 2 In some cases we may & must stand vpon our own approbatiō.1 In praise As
1 When we make profession of our faith. 1. Pet. 3. 2 In Thankefulnes we acknow∣ledge Gods graces in vs. 1. Cor. 14. 18. 3 Wee must defend our inno∣cency. 2. Cor. 11. 12. and 4 Iustifie also our calling against the slanders of our aduersaries to the stopping of their mouthes. 5 Hereby we may comfort our selues in troubles. Psal. 35. 13. 12. 6 And propose our selues ex∣amples vnto others. 1. Cor. 11. 1. 14. Here these caueats are to be obserued: 1 That this be done sincerely as well acknowledging our infir∣mities as the graces of God in vs. 2 That in doing hereof we ra∣ther, if it may be, take occasion to speake in another mans persons. 2. Cor. 12. 1. 2. 3 That wee boast not of that which is not in vs. 4 Wee must not speake of the good we haue, as if it were from our selues. 1. Cor. 15. 10. 5 Our speech must rather tend
to the defect then to the excesse. 6 We must doe it soberly and sparingly, rather shewing that wee are compelled thereunto then of our owne accord. 2. Cor. 11. 7 We must here especially re∣gard how we are made manifest to the cōscience of the saints. 2. Cor. 4. 8 And lastly wee must herein especially ayme at Gods glorie. 1. Cor. 10. 31. Thus may we speake good of our selues. 3 We are also bound to speake euill of our selues, in these cases, 1 We must confesse our sinne vnto man, in that hereby we may cleare others and giue glorie to God.2 In dis∣praise. Ios. 7. 2 Hereby also we ease our owne soules. Psal. 32. 45. Iam. 5. 3 We magnifie the mercies of God in recounting how vnworthie we are. 1. Tim. 1. 4 We stay vp others that haue bene ouertaken with the same ten∣tations, &c. 2. Cor. 1. 4. But here obserue these cautions: 1 We are not boūd to accuse our
selues to the betraying of our inno∣cency, or the truth of God, or his children. 2 we may not open our infirmi∣ties to the disgrace of our calling, or offence of others. 3 we must take heede of hypo∣crisie, as if by acknowledging our vilenes, we would be counted con∣uerts, as Ecebolius did. 4 That we labour to hide what we haue laid open, by casting our burthen vpon Iesus Christ. Thus may wee speake of the euill that is in vs. And thus much concerning the persons of whom we must speake. Concerning things to be spoken, obserue, 1 That we cannot speake of all,Sect. 14. Of things to be spo∣ken of. because we know but in part, and therefore it is vanity to presume thus. 1. Cor. 13. 2 That we may not speake of all we know: Because, 1 Some things are knowne to vs which are neither fit to be done nor spoken, as the vaine thoughts of our owne hearts. 2. Cor. 12.
2 Some things are lawfull to be done, which it is not lawfull to speake of, as the secrets & necessitie of nature. Iudges. 3. 24. 3 Some things are lawfull, but not fit to be spoken: such as either ex∣ceede the capacities of those to whom we speake, or are not sutable to them. 2. Cor. 12. Hebrew. 5. 11. 1. Cor. 14. 3 We must speake what we know, but with these conditions: 1 That wee keepe our selues within the compasse of our callings. 2 That we speake from the ho∣ly purpose of the heart. 3 That wee labour herein the glory of God. 1. Cor. 10. 31. 4 And also the good of our neigh∣bour. Ephes. 4. 29. 5 Yea our owne increase both in knowledge & holines. 1. Cor. 14. 26. 40. 6 Obseruing the fitnes of time, place, persons, &c. Thus may we speake of such things as do occure. And thus farre concerning the matter of our speech. Touching the manner thereof.
First, Our speech in generall must bee gracious,Sect. 15 The man∣ner of speech, & 1 It must be grati∣ous. which is, when the graces of God imprinted in the heart, are truely pictured in the tongue. Col. 4. 6. Hence it followeth: 1 That all rotten and vngratious speech is disclaimed. 2 No vice must be spoken of, but with dislike. Reuel. 2. 3 No gracious speech, but from a gracious heart. Secondly, Speech is then grati∣ous, when it is seasoned with wise∣dome. Act. 2. 4. And this is when our speech is applied: 1 Fitly to times, places, persons, circumstances. Pro. 19. 11. Pro. 10. 31. Esay 50. 5. 2 When it profits most to the good of mens soules. 3 When it turnes not to the hurt of the speaker. 2. Tim. 2. 16. 4 When it proceeds from a wise & vnderstanding hart. Eccle. 12. 11. Hence is disclaymed, 1 All foolish talke, wanting rea∣son and conscience. Ephes. 5. 2 All carnall counsell of world∣lings,
whatsoeuer shew of wisdome it hath in it. 1. Sam. 17. 3 All vnseasonable and vndi∣screete communication. 4 All mysticall, or curious con∣ference, &c. 1. Tim. 6. 20. A second holy property of speech is: 1 Truth and fidelitie.Sect. 16. 2 Our speech must be true. Ephes. 4. 25. And it is discerned; 1 When wee know what wee speake vpon a sure ground. 2 We speake as the thing is, the whole truth, and no more. 3 And as himselfe thinketh plain∣ly therof, not out of others conceits. 4 And also to the mind and pur∣pose of him that asketh. 5 And that to haue the trueth boulted out, not obscured. 6 When wee stand to that wee haue spoken or promised, which that we may doe, Here consider diuers euiden∣ces and bonds of truth, As First,Sect. 17 Of the bonds of truth. 1 Euiden∣ces. A simple assertion, which is either, 1 A simple affirmation, Yea, Yea. Matth. 5.
2 Or a bare negation, Nay, Nay, Here obserue, 1 That in a doubtfull case wee must adde vnto our affirmations (these qualifications: (As I thinke, As I take it,) because wordes thus spoken, if they proue true, they shew the modesty of the speaker: If false, yet they saue his credite, as shewing that there is not a purpose to de∣ceiue, but onely that we were de∣ceiued. 2 Another euidence of Truth is, an Asseueration, whereby we doe vehemently denie or affirm a thing, as In very truth, Without al doubt, &c. Here note, 1 That this is not to be vsed but in waightie and vrgent occasions. 2 When there is a gaine saying of what we affirme. Christ saith, Amen, Amen. 3 When we are to conuince in∣credulous and obstinate persons. Rom. 9. 1. And thus farre of the E∣uidences of Truth. A first bond of truth is a promise.Sect. 18. Of Pro∣mise. Here obserue: 1 What promises we must make.
2 How they are to be kept, & how they bind. The promises we are to make to men, must be such as, 1 Be conditionable, asking God leaue. Iam. 4. 15. 2 Be of such things as are in our abilitie to performe. 3 Such as may benefite the par∣ty to whom we make promise. 4 And also may stand with con∣science and credite to performe. And thus they bind with these bonds: 1 They bind according to the will & pleasure of him to whom it is made. Psal. 15. though it be to our owne hinderance. 2 Yet so, if by necessarie casualty we are disinabled to performance, the partie to whom the promise is made, in conscience is to giue some relaxation. Mat. 18. 3 To this end we are bound to craue reliefe, and vse holy wis∣dome, and submission thereto.2 Bonds. Sect. 19 Pro, 6. 1, 2. A second bond of truth, is an Oath.An Oath. Here obserue,
1 The lawfulnes thereof,1 The lawfulnes. 1 Because God hath comman∣ded it. Esay 45. 23. 2 It is a speciall part of his wor∣ship. Esay 19. 18. 3 The Saints haue practised it holily. Gen. 31. 53. 4 It hath procured much good and beene accepted of God. 1. Chr. 15. 2 Consider we the matter of an oath,2 The matter. 1 It must not only be true, but so knowne to vs. Ier. 4. 2. 2 It must bee honest that wee sweare to. 3 It must be a truth of great im∣portance. 3 Obserue we the manner of an oath,3 The manner. as 1 It must bee made in the onely name of God. 1 By inuocation of his name, to witnes the truth of what we swear. 2 And to blesse vs therein. 2 By imprecation against our selues, whereby we bind our selues if we deceiue, to the vengeance of God. 3 It must be done, not rashly, but with great aduisement.
4 And also with great reuerence & feeling, not without praier vnto God to guide the heart. Eccl. 9. 2. Fourthly, The true & lawful swea∣rer is indeede 1 The regenerate man,4 He that may swear whoh hath right in this seruice, and knowes how to vse it aright. Ro. 2. & none other. 2 And he must also haue a parti∣cular calling to this seruice. 3 Here learne, that though the partie in regard of his generall cal∣ling might not sweare, yet his oath being made, is lawfull, if he haue a ciuill calling thereto, and may bee taken howsoeuer the swearer herein be not iustified. 5 The right vse & end of an oath is:5 The end. 1 To end controuersies between man and man, and free those that are wrongfully accused. 2 To cleere our innocency be∣fore men. Heb. 6. 16. 3 To prouide for the infirmities of men. 1. Sam. 12. 5. Gen. 31. 53. 4 To witnes a truth vnto men. 5 Binde our selues more con∣stantly to the seruice of God. Nehe. 10. 1. Chron. 15. 23.
Sixtly,6 Before whom we must sweare. Consider we the parties be∣fore whom we may sweare, which are; 1 The Magistrate, who may law∣fully exact an oath. 2 To a priuate man we may al∣so sweare to bind contracts. 3 The Master may require an oath of the seruant. Genesis 24. and so the Father of the sonne, the husband of the wife, &c. one friend of another. Seuenth,7 When Obserue we the time of an oath, which is: 1 In a case of necessity, when wit∣nes faile, or words wil not be taken. Hence it followeth: 1 That we need not swear when the partie to whom wee sweare is not willing to accept it. 2 And neither also, if the mat∣ter may bee cleered by any other awfull meanes. Eightly, Learne we how an oath binds.8 How an oath binds 1 If it be imposed by him that may lawfully giue it. 2 If it be made of things law∣full.
3 If it tend to our own & neigh∣bours good. 4 When Gods glory also is pre∣pared thereby. 9 Wisely consider we the abuses of an oath,9 The abuses of an oath. which are: 1 Swearing by Images, trifles, Saints, nullities, &c. Zep. 1. 5. 2 Swearing ordinarily in com∣mon speech, or vpon heate in ga∣ming, &c. Ier. 5. 7. Mat. 5. 3 Rash swearing, when we know not the cause, or haue no calling thereto, or aduise not wisely in the action. 4 Muthering of oathes, when wee say gods for God, fect for faith, swounds, for wounds, &c. where hoping to escape the imputa∣tion of swearing, we are more guil∣tie thereof. 5 Outragious and blasphemous swearing the badge of ruffians, and rake-hels. 6 Cursed swearing, with feare∣full imprecations against our selues and others. 7 Wicked swearing, when we binde our selues by oathes to mis∣chiefe.
Acts 2. 3. 8 False swearing, when wee sweare to that ignorantly which proues false. 9 Periurie, when wee knew a thing to be false, and yet wil sweare to it of set purpose to doe mis∣chiefe. Zach. 5. 4. 10 Swearing for hire to any pur∣poses. Acts 6. 11 When we sweare to impossi∣bilities, as when the Priest is sworn by the Bishop to the vow of conti∣nencie. Generally here is condemned: First, Al kind of lying,Sect. 20. Of Lying. vpon what pretence soeuer. Now a lie is then made, 1 When we speake falsly. 2 And are willing so to doe. 2. Rings 5. 3 Purpose to deceiue thereby, Acts 5. Hence it followeth, that all 1 False speaking of ignorance is no lie. Secondly, Here is condemned all smoothing and dissembling of a mat∣ter,Sect. 21. Of flatte∣rie. (either) with purpose to de∣ceiue.
1 By extenuating of it. 2 By exercising the fact. 3 By vsing pretexts and shifts to auoyde it. 4 By mentall reseruation and such like Iesuiticall and Atheisticall trickes. Thirdly,Sect. 22. Concea∣ling of truth. Also all concealing of truth, when we are bound to speake, is heere forbidden. 4 All ambiguous and doubtfull speeches. 5 To speake vntruthes, though not with purpose to deceiue. 6 All promise-breaking when the promise is lawfulfully made. And thus farre concerning the second grace of speech, which is Truth: A third grace of holy speech is Reuerence.Sect. 23. The third grace of, speech. Reuerēce, and that 1 In re∣spect of God. And this is in re∣gard, either of, First God, of whose name and titles we must so speake that wee both, 1 Shew reuerence our selues, and 2 Mooue reuerence in others. Deut. 28. 58.
And this we shall doe: 1 If we know God aright. 2 And feare him as our father: Malach. 1. 3 Behold him in his iudgements vpon the wicked. Psal. 119. 120. 4 Thinke often and meditate vpon him.2 Of man. Secondly, we must vse reuerence in speech in regard of man, & that either generally as he beares Gods image. So we must, 1 Giue holy names vnto our chil∣dren:Sect. 24. To giue holy names to to our children. But here with sobriety, not the names of God, as Iesuits, &c. but such as, 1 May shew our thankefulnes to God. Gen. 41. 2 May shew our true humiliati∣on vnder his corrections. Ruth. 1. 3 May put vs in mind of his pro∣mises. Israel. Gen. 32. 4 May remember vs of our own frailty and wretchednes. Adam, Gen. 32. 5 May intimate our time, estate and condition in this life. Ester. 2. 5. 6 May encourage vs to the hope of the life to come.
7 May minister comfort in our troubles, and such like. 2 We must not name professors by the names of prophane men. 3 We may change names vp∣on iust occasion. 2 We are to vse reuerence in more particular manner vnto man,Sect. 25. Reuerence to our su∣perior. as he is our superior either in calling or gifts. 1. Cor. 12. 13. prouided, 1 That we giue him not the ti∣tles of God as Iehoua &c. 2 Giue him the titles of his of∣fice though he be euil. Acts. 26. 25. 3 And yet here so carie our selues as that we may humble him in the performance thereof. Therefore here is forbidden: 1 All manner of blasphemy;Here for∣bidden, 1 Basphe∣mie. which is either, First by detracting ought from God. 2 Or ascribing to him that which beseemeth him not. 3 Vsing his great and fearefull names in our fumes and rage. 4 Inuocating him also in slight and customary matters. 5 Vsing the names of God to socery,2 Abuse of scrip∣ture. witch-craft.
All abuse of Scripture: And this is either, 1 When we haue no calling to vse it. 1. Cor. 14. 34. 2 We speak of the things of God in a prophane and carnall manner▪ 1. Cor. 2. 3 When wee make iests there∣of. 4 When we keepe backe any of Gods counsell and clip the word of God. Math. 4. Act. 20. 5 When we vse it to sorcery. 6 And when we reason and ca∣uill about the truth thereof. 3 All abuse of our selues or others:2 Abuse of our selues. Either, 1 By reuilings and barbarous speeches. 2 Cursing and banning. Col. 3. 8. 3 Scoffing and scorning each o∣ther. Psal. 1. 2. Kings 2. especially for our profession and religion. 4 Not vsing titles of honour. &c. 5 Currish & dogged speech &c. And thus farre of the third grace of speech, which is reuerence.
A fourth grace of speech is sobriety, modesty,Sect. 26. A fourth grace of speech So∣briety, & Modestie. And wherein. or meekenes. And this is eene. 1 In praysing others, and that rather behind their backes then be∣fore their faces. 2 In praysing and dispraysing our selues, as before. 3 In speaking of things secret which may moue blushing fairely. Gen. 4. 1. 1. 1. Sam. 24. 4. 4 Conferring with inferiours ten∣derly and humbly. 5 Saluting kindly and reuerent∣ly. And that, 1 By name. Rom. 16. 2 By profession. Rom. 16. 3.Sect. 27. Of salu∣tations. 3 Calling or office. 4 By way of blessing. Rō. 16. 24. 5 Praying for the blessing of God vpon them. Here obserue: 1 That it is lawfull for children to inuocate the blessing of their pa∣rents. Gen. 27. Gen. 48. 2 That wee may salute gene∣rally though the person bee euill, so farre as wee may conuerse with him, giuing the titles of
his profession, calling, &c. Gen. 34. Acts. 26. 3 That we auoyd such blessing and charitable speeches (as we ac∣count them) when the cause is not necessary, as in neesing. &c. 4 Whereas it is common with the Popish and Ignorant to inuo∣cate the name of God ouer their cattle so often as they speake there∣of,Popish blessing to be mode∣rated. this is to be moderated and refray∣ned. And that, 1 Because the ground thereof was sorcery. 2 They vse it more often for their cattel then themselues. 3 It maintaines that Popish customary abusing of such holy names. 4 It shewes our infidelity, for if we were perswaded that God hath receiued vs into grace, then surely also all ours; and therefore what neede such often inuocations? This meekenes of speech is seene in soft answering.Sect. 28. Of soft answering. Prouerbes 15. 25. And that, Secondly, not a foole accor∣ding to his foolishnes. Prouerbs
26. 3. Thirdly, in a iust defence of our selues. 1. Samuel 1. 15. Anna. Fourthly, commending our cause to God. Psal. 26. This grace of speech is especi∣ally seene in reproouing of sinne.Sect. 28. Of re∣proofe of sinne. Here obserue these rules: 1 We must trie all other gentle meanes before we reprooue. 2 We must performe it general∣ly, that so the party may willingly acknowledge the particular. 2. Sam. 12. 3 We must doe it in a parable. 4 By way of exhortation insi∣nuating an oblique reproofe 1. Tim. 5. 1. 5 Wrapping vp the reproofe in some sweete protestations of loue and griefe. Galat. 5. 9. 4 Yeelding vnto them their due, that so they may acknowledge their wants. Acts. 25. 6 Ioyning our selues with them, and in our owne person reproouing their sinne. 1. Cor. 4. 6. 7 By preuention; as Though Is∣rael play the harlot, yet let not Iu∣dah
sinne. Hos. 4. 15. 8 Wishing that such things bee not found among them. 2. Cor. 12. 20. 9 Speaking to them as conside∣ring our selues. Gal. 6. 1. That wee are in danger of the same tentati∣ons. 10 Framing the reproofe out of the word, that the party may see himselfe rather reprooued of God then of vs. And thus farre of the fourth grace of speech, which is meekenes and modestie. A fifth grace of speech is cheerefulnes and ioy,Sect. 30. A fift grace of Speech is cheereful∣nes and ioy. It condi∣tions. when wee vse delightfull speech for recreation. Eccles. 3. 4. Here is to be obserued: 1 That it must be seasoned with Gods feare. Eccles. 2. 2. 2 It must bee with compassion for those that are in affliction. Am. 6. 6. 3 It must be sparing and mode∣rate. 2. Tim. 3. 4 It must not be mixt with sin. Hebr. 11. 25. 5 It must tend to edification. 1. Cor. 10.
6 It must be sutable to the time. 7 It must also bee fitted to the place, which is either the boord or bed. For the boord obserue: 1 The intent,How fit∣ted to the boord. the which is to hin∣der other idle and prophane talke. 2 To season the company with better. 3 To preuent gluttony. 4 A desire to catch spiritually. 5 To sanctifie the creatures. 2 Consider the matter of table talke. Which, 1 Especially must be of religion. Luk. 11. 35. 2 That which is incident here∣unto, As, First of sobriety & such examples. 2 Gods speciall prouidence and bounty in making a dead creature meanes to preserue life. Ioel 2. 26. Haggai. 1. 6. 3 Contentation in our estate. 1. Tim. 6. 4 Death, how that we shall be wormes meat. 5 Of the heauenly food. Ioh. 4. 6 Misery of the poore.
7 Change of things and states. Iob 1. 8 The punishment of sinne, the case of Diues, &c. Luke 16. For the bed;How to the bed. let these be the rules of holy mirth. 1 We must confer of the graue. Acts 7. 2 Of the occasions passed in the day. Cant. 3. 1. 3 Of the resurrection. 4 Of worldly occasions, so far as to humble vs. 5 In our comforts of our sweete fellowship with Christ. 6 Generally, not to prouoke but to mortifie the flesh. Galathian. 5. 13. Here is to be auoyded generally, 1 All offence to the weake.Here to be auoyded: 2 All occasion to the wicked: As in First, Iesting,Iesting, with it bounds. which is a quipping of some to delight others, wherein a man had rather lose his friend then his iest. This is vtterly vnlawfull, vnlesse. 1 The matter be indifferent.
2 The measure modest. 3 The season conuenient. 4 Offence remoued. 5 Our selues, & others benefited 6 We thereby, when other re∣proofes wil not preuaile, in an holie manner doe deride and scorne sin∣ners. 1. Reg. 19. Eccles. 11. Secondly, laughter,2 Laugh∣ter. which though in it selfe it bee not simplie vnlaw∣full, yet it is moderatelie to be vsed, and seldome; but sorrow more of∣ten, & more plentifully. Eccl. 7. 4. 5. The sixth grace of speech is care of our neighbours good name.Sect. 31. A sixt grace of speech, Care of our neigh∣bours good name. Pro. 22. This is performed as before, and farther, 1 By being not suspicious in vn∣likely or vncertaine occasions. Ier. 40. 2 By priuate reprouing him. 3 Publiquely answering for him if he be slandered.1 How perfor∣med. 2 What auoyded. Here is to be auoyded: 1 Secret whispering abroad of what we suspect or know behind his backe. Psal. 50. 20. 2 Adding to, or changing the
thing said or done. Mat. 26. 60, 61. 3 Open traducing and reuiling to his face. 2. Sam. 16. 4 Telling that was neuer done. Ierem. 37. 13. 5 Colouring their reports with pretences of griefe or necessity, or publick profit, inioyning secrecy by the party to whom he tels it, &c. 6 Rash censuring before euident knowledge. Therefore here we are, 1 To interrupt such talke.Sect. 32. The last grace of speech: slownes and brief∣nes. 2 To giue no heede to it. 3 Not to beleeue it. 4 To reproue it. The seuenth and last grace of speech, is slownes and briefenesse. Slownes is seene either in First, Prouoking; or Secondly, Answering. Herein obserue: 1 That it is better to be pro∣uoked to speech then prouoke, espe∣cially if we be inferiour. 2 Not to take a tale out of ones mouth, but to heare it tho∣rowly. 3 To consider whither it be to
be answered or no. 4 To ponder on it before wee answere, what answere is to bee made thereto. 5 To answere to the points, o∣mitting partiall respects. 6 To cut off idle interruptions and vaine cauils. Here is to be auoyded: 1 Pride to heare a mans selfe speake. 2 The fruit thereof, namely: First, Obscurity. Secondly, Affectation. 2 We must auoyd tempting speeches whereby wee may fift and vnder∣mine others. 4 As also that spirit of contradicti∣on, whereby thwarting others and contradicting euery man, heresie, and Atheisme is bredde and maintai∣ned. 5 We must also refraine bitter∣nes and captious taking vp of our bro∣ther, a fault incident to briefenes of speech. 6 As also wee must beware of sottishnes, and inconsequence of speech, while happily we thinke to
shew our skill in breuitie. Hitherto appertaine: 1 Restrayning of our passion, by interrupting our selues, if by course of speech we grow into an heate. 2 Correcting our selues by si∣lence wherein we haue missaid. 3 Contracting our matter into the briefest forme of words. 4 Disposing it methodically to the best capacity of the hearer. Generall rules to be obserued herein. 1 That what is here spoken of speech is to bee vnderstood also of writing, in which all these graces are to be practised, and vices to bee auoyded. 2 That in all kind of speech, as well Latine as English, &c. exem∣plarie, as wherin though the phrases of other tongues may leade vs to prophanenes, yet we must auoyde them, &c. Hitherto of speech.Sect. 33. Of silence and the right vse thereof. Now because we cannot speake well vnlesse we know also how to hold our peace, wee are therefore in the second place to consider of silene. Here obseru:
1 That the ruleof silence must be Gods word. 2 Matter of silence, concernes God, our neighbour, our silnes. 3 Persons, before whom.Things to be con∣cealed. And first, wherein silence is to be vsed. 4 The end, which is Gods glorie, ours and others good. Things concerning God, are: 1 His secrets which we knowe not, and therefore are to admire them in silence. Deut. 29. 29. 2 His strange and extraordina∣ry works, which we may not speake boldly of, but rather in silence won∣der at. Iob 36. 37. Leuit. 10. 3. 3 We are to conceale the mer∣cies of God from obstinate sinners. Matth. 7. 6. 4 We are to conceale his iudge∣ments from humbled sinners. Esay 40. 1. 5 We are to be silent at his cor∣rections. Psal. 39. hereby shewing our submission to his will. 6 We are to yeeld to the known truth, & in silence to glorifie God. Act. 11. 18.2 Con∣cerning Touchig our neighbour, obserue
2 That we may conceale some truth from him, not being deman∣ded, yea being questioned we may conceale either the whole or part: Prouided that it, 1 Hinder Gods glorie. 2 Or my neighbours good. Truth in the whole is to be concealed: 1 When the speaking of the least word is hurtfull: as for example, the father & son lieth sicke at once, the son dieth first, the father asketh whether the son be dead or no, if it be said; No, an vntruth is told; if yea the fathers life is endangered:3 What to be con∣cealed. Aug lib. ad conser. there∣fore silence is best. 2. Sam. 12. 2 When the reuealing thereof endangers the life of the innocent; and therefore I am not to reueale my brethren in affliction, nor to be compelled thereto by oath: Prouided first, that the authori∣tie requiring this be vnlawfull. 2 The thing I conceale not in it selfe euill; but so mistaken. 3 That in the cōcealing of it I pre∣fer not a priuate before a publicke good. Truth in part is to concealed, when I speake a part of the truth
but not the whole. 1. Sam. 16. 1. 23. Ier. 38. 24. Exod. 5. Act. 23. 6. Q. When I am demaunded may I answere in part? Yea so 1. I purpose not to deceiue. 2 Cōtēt the mind of the answerer. Secondly, I am to conceale the infirmities of my neighbour, vnlesse (as before) we be called of God to speake. Prou. 17. 14. Pro. 19. 11. 3 All vnseemely matters, 4 Such as concerne vs not, 5 And such as are aboue our reach, are to be buried in silence. 3 Ministers must conceale the in∣firmities of their people. 4 Magistrates secrets of state left the enemy know of them. Concerning my selfe, I am, 1 To conceale mine owne se∣crets. Iud. 14. or else, if neede be, tell those that are faithfull. 2 That which thou wouldst haue no man know tell no man.

Last part of the Girdle Confor∣mtiy of outward actions. which is performed: 1 When they proceed from a true ground. 2 And are performed by true meanes and a holy manner. 3 When they aime at a right end. The ground of all good actions is faith in Iesus Christ. Rom. 14. Heb. 11. 6. 1 Assuring vs that our persons are accepted of God,The ground of them, Faith. & so our actions. Heb. 11. 4. 2 Enabling vs to performe the worke acceptably vnto God in knowledge, wisdome, season Psa. 1. 3 Comforting vs that the imper∣fection of the action shal not be laid to our charge. 2. Cor. 8. 12. 4 Applying vnto vs the righte∣ousnesse of Iesus Christ to couer the
same. Psal. 32. 5 Strengthing vs to go forward in well doing, and so to attaine per∣fection, & so the iust liueth by faith. Heb. 10. 38. In the manner of weldoing obserue these notes: 1 That we principally performe the actions of the first table,2 The manner how. and then of the second. Act. 4. 19. 2 That our obedience to the se∣cond table bee included and deri∣ued from our obedience to the first. Math. 22. 39. Ephes. 6. 1. 3 That in regard of the truth & necessity of wel-doing we haue e∣quall respect vnto all Gods com∣mandements. Psal. 119. 9. 4 That we at all times and to al times endeuour the performance there of Gal. 6. Ephes. 6. 5 That in the action we labor not so much the outward conformity thereof, as the inward soundnes & approbation of the heart. Mat. 6. 7. 6 That we doe good by good meanes; that is, such as are war∣ranted by the word. &c. 7 That we find in our selues a
will alwaies to doe more then wee can doe. Psal. 119. 5. 8 That wee see the shortnes of our wel-doing and being humbled therewith, not rest in the present estate, forget that which is behind, and hasten to that which is before Phil. 3. 12. 13. 9 That when we haue done all we can, we acknowledge our selues to be vnprofitable seruāts. Luk. 17. 10. 10 That hereupon we seeke not saluatiō by our works, but by Gods meer mercie in Iesus Christ Phil. 3. 11 That we be that we seem to be. 12 That we make conscience of the least as well as of the greatest. 13 That we prouide things ho∣nest before men, as well as in the sight of God. The end of our actions is, 1 That whatsoeuer we doe it be done to Gods glorie.3 The end what, Gods glory. 1. Cor. 10. 31. and this is performed: 1 In sanctifying and auspicating them by praier & inuocation of the name of God. 1. Tim. 4. 2 In returning the strength of them to the worship of God, in cau∣sing our light to shine before men. Mat. 5. 20. Prou. 5. 10.
3 In all things, and in euery issue of them, both giuing thanks to God the father through Iesus Christ. 4 Being abased before the Lord in regard of our vnworthines to do him any seruice, as also of the vnwor∣thines of the seruice we do perform. 5 Acknowledging that nothing is due vnto vs but shame and con∣fusion of our faces. Dan. 9. 6 desiring to be found in Christ, not hauing our owne righteousnes which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of Christ Phil. 3. 9. Secondly, we must do al things to edification both of our selues and others.2 Edifica∣tion how accom∣plished. Here obserue: 1 That the lesse benefit must giue place to the greater. 2 That in all things next to Gods glorie, our cheefe ayme must be the saluation of the soule. 1. Cor. 16. 3 That more regard be had of those which are within, then which are without, Gal. 6. 10. 1.

5 That our conuersation be an∣swerable to our profession. Ephes. 4. 1. 6 That we haue as well strong meate for men, as milke for babes; not sticking alwaies in the infancy of our profession, but growing vp in Iesus Christ. Heb. 6. 1. Hebr. 13. 7 That we abound in weldoing, & make sure our election by good wokes. 2. Pet. 1. 8, 9. 8 That we as well cast out the hypocrite and stumbling-blocke, as hold on the sound Christian. Iere∣mie 1. 9 We must bring forth fruit in due season, obseruing the comelines of time, place, persons, &c. Psalme 1. 3. This Girdle is put on, 1 By continually setting of our hearts before God,How ap∣plied. for the search∣ing thereof. 2 Trying all our thoughts, words, and actions, by the word. 3 By continuall watching ouer our waies. 4 By earnest prayer to God. And it is ketton,
1 By not strayning the consci∣ence in the least euill. Heb. 13. 18. 2 By cleauing to the testimonie thereof, and reioycing especially therin. 2. Cor. 1. 12. 3 By obeying the checks of con∣science. 4 Conuincing the hollownesse and hypocrisie of the world. 5 Labouring and approuing sin∣ceity in others. 7 Daily fearing our selues, and renuing our couenant with God. 8 Renouncing daily our selues, and flying to Christ. The vse of this Girdle is: 1 Wee are readie prest to doe Gods will.Benefit of this part of the Girdle Reu. 1. 3 We are cleered from hypocri∣sie, which is the moth of weldo∣ing. Mat. 6. Mat. 23. 4 We auoyd vncertainety and dulnes in good things. 5 We are preserued from cor∣ruption in iudgement, and apostasie in life. 6 All other gifts of God are a∣dorned and approued thereby. 7 Wee are enabled to hold out
to the end, & so obtaine the crown. 8 The other parts of the spiritu∣all armor are compact in them∣selues, and fastened to vs by it: The next whereof is the brest-plate of righteousnes, or innocency. And this is, 1 An Inclination and resolution of the heart to all good. This is necessary: 1 To iustifie and beautifie our profession,Sect. 35. The brest plate of righteous∣nes. and make sure our electi∣on. 2 That we may be freed from many inward pangs and outward troubles. 3 That the mouthes of the wic∣ked may be stopped. 4 That the weake may be con∣firmed. 5 That those which are without may be gathered. 6 That our perfection may be accomplished and we glorified. 7 That God may be all in all. And this is discerned: 1 By hauing righteousnes in most pretious account.The markes thereof. Iob 1. 2 Esteeming it for it selfe, not for
the reward thereof Iob 2. 10. 3 Prosecuting the same with all zeale and courage. 4 Resting therein with delight and contentation. 5 Cleauing thereto, though it cost vs the setting on. Hebr. 10. 34. 6 Auoyding the contrarie, though it may be neuer so behouefull vnto vs. 7 So farre as our knowledge in∣formes vs practising the same. 8 Desiring beyond our know∣ledge perfection therein. 9 Louing others especially for it. Heb. 10. 34. 10 Laboring to make others par∣takers thereof. 11 Not being remoued from the same by any cunning or slanders whatsoeuer. This is obtained and put on: 1 By an vtter renouncing of na∣ture and all good therein.3 How it is put on. 2 Laying hold on Christ by a liuely faith, and so wee bring forth the fruit of righteousnesse in him. And we put it on as our brest-plate: First, by an holy and setled pur∣pose
of heart to serue God. Act. 11. 2 By plaine and sound dealing in all things. 3 By renuing our decaies by daily repentance, and couenanting with God. 4 By informing our hearts daily out of the word. 5 Preparing our selues daily to tentations. And it is kept on: 1 By walking alwaies in the pre∣sence of God.4 How Kept on. Enoch, Abraham. 2 Auoyding the great offences Psal. 19. 3 By abstaining from the occa∣sions and appearance of euill. 1.

And to this end serues the third part of this Armour.
This is that our feete be shod with the preparation of the Gospell,Feet shod with the preparati∣on of the gospell That is: In the assurance of our acceptati∣on into the fauour of God, through Iesus Christ, we are armed and pre∣pared: First, to Deny our selues. Secondly, to take vp the crosse of Christ and to follow him. Luke 9. 23. And this must be done. 1 That troubles find vs not vn∣prepared.The vse of this part Iob 3. 25. 2 That the feare of them may not dismay vs. 3 That we be not ouerwhelmed with the waight of them. 2. Cor. 4. 8. 9. 4 That our minds may be quie∣ted in the midst of them. Rom. 5. 2. 5 That wee may be more then conquerours in them.

Hebr. 12. 2. 2 Giuing all diligence to the word preached. 3 Preferring the fauour of God in Christ aboue all things. Psalme 4. 6. 4 Not depending vpon things seene, but contemplating things in uisible. Heb. 11. 1. 5 Hauing our eye fixed on the re∣compence of the reward, and com∣paring the momentary trouble with the surpassing waight of glory Hebr. 11. And heere the shield of faith is of speciall vse,Sect. 37. A fourth part of the Armour, the shield of faith. which is the fourth part of this Armour: And it is a full and strong per∣swasiō of the loue of God in Chri Iesus, Rom. 8. 38. whereby. 1 We beate backe all the fier darts of the deuill, as carnall confi∣dence, presumption, security, in delity, distrust, credulitie, &c. 2 Prize all things at their tr

NOW being thus armed, we are pre∣pared to encounter such occasions as occurre in the day, which are general∣ly and necessary:Of the pursuit of God, and the auoy∣ding of e∣uill. 1 To auoyde euill. Esay 1. 16, 17. 2 To prosecute that which is good. Concerning the auoyding of euill: First, we must labour to haue our iudgement rectified. Concerning 1 The euill it selfe. 2 Our owne estate in respect of it. 3 God, who hates it and yet or∣ders it. That which wee are to be informed concerning euil, is; that there is euil,Sect. 1. Difference of euill. 1 By nature, & such is whatsoeuer is
against or besides the law of God, and this is properly called sinne. 2. Accident, so a good thing may be made euill. Psal. 69. 22. Malach. 2. 2. 3 Opinion, so afflictions are coun∣ted euils; yea, the truth and power of good in the censure of the world, vsually is counted euill. Esay 5. 20. The vse hereof is: 3 That we may discerne things that differ, not stumbling vpon euil in stead of good, nor auoyding good in stead of euill, not fearing afflicti∣ons when they come for good, not distrusting our goodnesse, though it be accounted euill. Phil. 1. 10. 2 We must vnderstand the true author of euill, which is not God, but our selues, that so wee may blame none but our selues. Iames 1. 13.Sect. 2 What the euill of it is. 3 That euil is not onely a meere priuation of good, but a quality in∣herēt & defiling the soule. 1. Ioh. 3. 4 4 That it is not only committed in act, but in thought, though con∣sent come not thereto. Exo. 20. 5 That it is as well committed
in omitting what we should doe, as in doing what we should not. 6 That sinne is seen in the least that is forbidden, as well as in the greatest. 1. Iohn 3. 4. That the least sinne breaketh the law of God, and maketh vs guiltie of the whole. Iames 2. 12. Ephes. 5. 11, 12. Rom. 6. 21. 8 That sinne is filthie and loth∣some euen in the greatest pleasure and act thereof. 9 That the end thereof is bitter, and the inward parts most abomi∣nable. And this knowledge serueth, 1 To conclude all vnder sinne. Rom. 3. 9.Sect. 3. The vse of this know∣ledge. 2. To lay the fault iustly where it is. 3 To preuent diminishing and encreasing of sinne. 4 To auoyd the custome and punishment thereof. Concerning our owne estate in respect of sinne, we are to learne: 1 That if we neuer committed sin, yet we are not free from it, as
being guilty of the sin of another, & deriuing it from the loynes of our parents▪ Rom. 5. 14. Psal. 51. 5. Ephe. 2. 3. 2 That hereby our nature is wholly tainted with corruption, and vncleanenesse.

Gods or∣dering sin. we are thus to conceiue of sinne. 1 That he hateth al euil as a righ∣teous God. Psa. 5. and no vncleane thing shall dwel with him. Reuela. 21. 2 That he permitteth and orde∣reth euill in speciall wisedome to his glory. Act. 5. 3 That he knoweth and search∣eth the most inmost closet of sinne. Ierem. 17. 10. 4 That he is able to punish & to take vengeance of the same. Isaiah 40. 5 That he punisheth sinne with sinne, and yet most righteously. 2. Thess. 2. 11. 6 That though hee haue laide the chastisement of our peace vp∣on his Sonne: yet hee will correct vs as his children for sinne. Esay 53. Psalme 88. 89.
And this knowledge serueth, 1 To iustifie the perfect holines of God.And the vse. Psal. 18. 30. Psal. 145. 17. 2 To magnifie his wisedome in disposing of euill. Rom. 11. 33. 3 To giue him his prerogatiue, that he is , the searcher of the heart.

Phil. 2. 12. Secondly, Our iudgment being thus rectified,Sect. 5. How sinne to be a∣uoyded. we must proceed to the practise of auoyding euill. And this is seene either in 1 Preuenting sinne, or 2 Recouering out of it by vnfained repentance.And first how pre∣uented. 1. generally. Sinnes is preuented either: 1 Generally or 2 Particularly.

And this sinne generally may be pre∣uented: particularly thus, when we are assaulted by any tentation. 1 To mourn at the priuy motions of sin, & at no hand to set light by it.2 How in particular we may resist sin. 2 To know that I beare a traytor in my bosom, & therfore here at no hād cōsult with flesh, nor giue way to the temptation. Iames 1. 14. 3 To choake it by strong cries and groanes to God. Mat. 6. 13. 4 To put it off by exercising the mind with contrary meditations
and affecting the contrarie vertue. Psal. 1. 5 Examine thy heart why it is thus, and thou shalt find some cause of this tentation. Psal. 4. 6 The cause found either, 1 Want of sound repentance for some former sinne, 2 Security, 3 Some greater euill like to fol∣low, whereof this tentation is a messenger, or such like negligence, dispose thy selfe accordinglie. 5 Intend thy calling more care∣fully and conscionably.

Iam. 4. 7. Matth 4. If Satan preuaile,Sect. 6. 3 How to recouer our sinn. and thou art foyled, then thou must rise againe by repentance. To this end consider: 1 Thy estate in grace, which must be renued by repentance. Psal. 51. 2 Gods mercies, which are a∣boue all thy sinnes. Psal. 103. 8. Exo. 34. 16. 3 Thy former experience how thou hast recouered. Psal. 77. 5. And so practse thy raysing vp in this manner: First, view thine iniquitie in the glasse of the law, to bruse thine hart, and there thou shalt find what an euill and bitter thing sin is. Ier. 2. 19. Secondly,1 By vie∣wing sinne and that, first in the law. hereupon applie that knowledge vnto thine owne soule by the power of conscience assisted by the blessed spirit of bondage: and
proceede to iudge thy salfe, con∣cluding that thou art guiltie of e∣ternall death. And hence will fol∣low compunction, and wounding of the heatt: 3 The heart being thus woun∣ded that thou maist bee kept from despaire,2 In the Gospel. view thy selfe secondly, in the glasse of the Gospell, that the bruised reede may not be broken, by considering what a bitter and yet precious ransome was paid for thy sinne. Mat. 20. 28. 4 Hereupon make application vnto thine heart by the worke of conscience renued by the spirit of adoption, and raise vp thy selfe with this assurance, that though thou art a sinner, yet Christ is thine, and thou hast pardon of thy sinne, and shalt haue life eternall in him. Mat. 11. 28. Mat. 5. 3. 4. Lu. 15. 2. Cor. 7 This application worketh two con∣trarie effects: 1 Thou shalt reioyce that thy sins are forgiuē thee in Christ Iesus. 2 Thou shalt be sorrowfull that thou hast displeased so good and gracious a father.
And this sorrow is expressed:2 By iudg∣ing. First, by Iudging thy sin before God in the court of thy conscience. And this Iudgement contayneth: 1 By examining thy sinne, and taking a more particular notice thereof. 2 Confessing it, Psalm. 32. 5. and that 1 With greefe and detestation. 2 Particularly, not generally, not onely so farre as thou knowest, confessing herein thy knowledge to be short, and yeelding vp thy vn∣scearchable heart vnto God. Lord clense me from my secret sinnes. Psalm. 19. 3 Against thy selfe not excu∣sing or diminishing: not laying the fault vpon God, the creatures, &c. but blaming especially that corrupt fountaine of thy heart herein. Psal. 32. 5. Psal. 51. 4 Vnto God, not vnto Angels or men, &c. who onely is able and ready to forgiue. Psal. 103. Thirdly, Thou must condemne sinne, and this is done: 1 By acknowledging what is
due vnto thee for it, namely shame and confusion of face for euer. Ezra 9. 6. 2 Professing thine owne vilenes, and vnworthinesse of the least of Gods mercies. Iob 39. 16. 3 Iustifying God in what hee might doe, and submitting thy selfe vnder his mightie hand. Ely. 2. Sam. 2. Dauid, 2. Sam. 15. 4 Execute vengeance vpon thy selfe for thy sinne, 2. Cor. 7. in as this ma∣ner: First, lie downe in thy confusion and couer thy face with shame. Ier. 3. Luk. 18. 2 Abhorre and detest thy selfe in sackcloth and ashes. Iob 42. 6. 3 Haue indignation and zeale a∣gainst thy selfe for offending so good a God: 2. Cor. 7. Peter wept bitter∣ly. Psal. 73. 22. so foolish, &c. 4 Groane vnder the burthen of thy flesh, and desire to be rid of it Rom. 7. 21. 5 Possesse a broken heart for thy sinne all thy life long. Psal. 51. 17. 6 Refraine thy selfe from law∣full comforts. Ioel. 2.
7 Impose all meanes of mortifi∣ing thy rebellious flesh, as feare of thy selfe, lest thou fall againe. Pro. 28. 14. 8 Mingle thy drinke with thy teares, and in thy greatest security, let the remembrance of thy sinne, awake and rouse thee vp. Psal. 51. 9 Desire euer after more care∣fully to please God. 2. Cor. 7. 10 To this end preserue a record of thy sinne and retaine some mo∣nument thereof with thee. 11 Consider often what punish∣ments thou hast felt for sinne. 12 And let the day of thy death and appearing before the iudgment seate of Christ be alwaies in thy mind, make thou sure account of it, & daily make readie for it. 2. Pet. 3. 13 Cease not crying out against thy corruptions and complaining vnto God of thy rebellions, that he may strengthen thee against them. Psal. 119. 49. 14 Bind thy selfe by the oath, and by the curse to forsake all sin, & to continue constant in the seruice of thy God. Ezra, 10. 3. 2. Chro. 15.
15 Reprooue sinne boldlie in others, and plucke them out of the fire: Iude 23. though thou beest scorcht for thy labour. 16 Suffer affliction as a good souldier of Iesus Christ, and prepare thy soule vnto tentations. 2. Tim. 2. Thus shalt thou cut off sin, and hap∣pily preserue thy selfe in a constant course of godlines. For thy better instruction herein. 1 Cal to mind what before is de∣liuered in the sixth part of the girdle of truth concerning holy actions, which may helpe thee both in the true knowledge of God to informe thy iudgment, as also in the right & holy practise of good things, which must be part of thy daily sacrifice. CHAP. XI. BEing thus instructed in generall auoyd euill and doe good, the next duetie that thou must performe,Thankes∣giuing. is thankefulnes vnto God. 1. Thes. 5. 18. And this duty is necessary: because 1 We doe approoue our right in Gods blessings. 1. Tim. 4.Sect. 1. It vse. 2 We make them profitable and durable. Mat. 14. 19, 20.
3 We encrease them, and make them pledges of heauen. 4 We do ease our selues of much begging, and so approch to the life of glory. 5 We acknowledge God to be the giuer, and blesser of them. 6 We do answer the end, why God bestowed them on vs. Deu. 8. 7 And do by this duty performe a most principall part of worship & glory to our God. Psal. 50. 23. 8 Security and hardnes of heart is hereby preuented. 9 Our faith in God is confirmed and encreased. 10 Spirituall pride and hypocri∣sie is ouer-mastered. 11 The certainty of our salua∣uation hereby pledged & cōfirmed. 12 Our account made readie, & so we prepared to meet the Lord. And it is to be performed daily: 1 Because we daily receiue good at the hands of God. Lam. 3. 23. 2 And by this meanes shal preuent many euils which daily do assault vs And this duty is performed on this manner:
First,Sect. 2. How to be practi∣sed. The hart must be prepared: 1 With sound notice of the bles∣sing, conceiuing more excellently of God then wee possible can see him by his blessings. 2 True humility for the same, by serious meditation, both of the Ma∣iesty, power and goodnes of God and also of it owne vnworthines. 3 As also it must be purged by setled purpose of not offending s bountifull a God. 4 And an holy perswasion, that we haue receiued the benefit in the fauour of God. 5 And a holy desire to set forth the glory of God. 2 The mouth must speake of the mercies of God: And that, 1 Reuerently and holily, no lightly or loosely. 2 Particularly, as neere as wee may recounting the same. Genes. 32. 10. 3 Publikely, euen in the great congregations vnto the Church GOD, yea to the generations to come. Ps. 66. & 102. 4 Priuately betweene God and
our owne soules to auoyd hypocri∣sie. Matt. 6. 5 Wisely and orderly for spiri∣tuall blessings, and then for tempo∣rall. Ephe. 1. 3. 6 Faithfully, aswel for blessings promised and to come, as for those we haue receiued. 2. Chro. 6. 7 Constantly, aswel when God takes, as when he giues. Iob 1. 21. 8 Humbly, acknowledging our selues to bee vnworthy of the least of them. Iacob, Gene. 32. 9 Speedily, if it bee possible to preuent the Lord. Gene. 24. 10 Continually, euen all our life long. 11 Charitably prouoking others to the like duty. 12 Acknowledging Gods gra∣ces in others, and without enuie or detraction aduancing the same. 13 Yea, wishing that all may be partakers of the same graces with vs. Num. 11. 14 Impartially, aswell for the least as for the greatest. 3 We must praise God in our life, & actions. Here obserue these principall
actions of thankefulnesse. Psalme 1. 1 To renue our obedience, encrease our seruice of God. Psal 116. 2 Continual mortification of old man. Psal. 106. 3. Ezr. 10. 3 Casting out the speciall beloued sinne. Mat. 5. 29. 4 Making much of the mean whereby Gods blessings are sanct¦fied, & so continued vnto vs, nam¦ly, the Preaching of the gospell, & Rom. 10. 15. 5 Labouring hartilie the co¦uersion of others. Psal. 51 6 Releeuing and forgiuing, praying one for another. Eph. 8. 7 Beleeuing Gods promises, waiting patiently the full acco∣plishment of them. Psalme 40. Heb. 11. 8 Erecting monuments and trophes of Gods benefits to posteri Gen. 22. 15. &c. 9 Writing & registring the n∣ble acts of the Lord. Psal. 102. 10 Imposing fit names vnto children, in remembrance of God
mercies. Gen. 41. 11 Paying our vowes vnto God and men. Psal. 65. 1. Ion. 2. 9. 12 Being content with whatsoe∣uer God bestoweth vpon vs. Thus are we to performe thankefulnes vnto God. Which that wee may performe more happily: First, Let vs beware of these euils which are maine enemies to this duety: As,Sect. 3. What e∣uils to be auoided. 1 To imagine, that we deserue any thing Luc. 17. 10. 2 That wee haue any thing meerely by our owne labour and industry. Psal. 127. 3 That wee harpe more vpon our troubles, then Gods fauours and benefits. 4 That we be alwaies begging, but neuer recounting what we haue receiued. 5 That we consider what others haue, rather then what wee haue need of. 6 That we be not secure in the blessings of God, but rather feare our estate most when we haue most
fauours. Iob 1. 7 That we tie God vnto these outward things. 8 That we dote and rest vpon these, and not rather forget them in regard of the things of the life to come. Phil. 3. 9 That we conceiue basely and meanely of Gods mercies, and doe not see & worship God in the least of them.Sect. 4. Helpes to thankeful∣nes. Secondly, Let vs vse these helpes thankefulnes. As 1 Rest we vpon God as the giuer of all good blessings. 2 Vse we all holy meanes for the obtaining of them. 3 Leaue we the successe to Go: depending on his prouidence. 4 Thinke we not what God can giue, but what is fit for vs to re∣ceiue. 5 Consider wee how small a tribute the Lord requires for all his blessings. 6 What a prerogatiue we attain by thankesgiuing, that God is the receiuer, and we giuers vnto God, and how much better it is to giue
then to receiue. 7 Let the creatures prouoke vs hereto, left otherwise they con∣demne vs. Heb. 6. 8 Let our commodity perswade vs, either if we will haue, or vse, or hold Gods fauours comfortably. 9 And lastly consider we the ac∣count to bee made in the life to come, which is made vp by thanke∣fulnes vnto God in this life. Ioh. 3. And thus far concerning thankefulnes The chiefe vse and benefit there∣of,Sect. 5. The be∣nefit ther∣of. is to keep vs in a constant course of obedience vnto God, in the en∣ioying of his blessings. And this is of the Next duety daily to bee performed of vs: CHAP. XII. NAmely to labour constancy and perseuerance vnto the end.Of con∣stancy and perseue∣rance. And that because: First, Hereby wee approue the soundnes of our calling and gifts,Sect. 1. It is most necessary. which otherwise if wee faile were but temporarie, giuen rather for o∣thers then for our owne good.
2 We obtaine the promise and the crowne that is set before vs. He. 11. which otherwise by falling away we shall lose. Reuel. 3. 6. 3 Wee approue the truth of God, and giue him the glorie of his faithfulnes. 1. Thes. 5. 24. 4 Wee ouercome satan and all our enemies. Ephes. 6. 13. Helpes hereunto are: First, The establishing of our faith, that the children of God shall continue to the end: and that be∣cause, 1 Our God is faithfull and al∣mightie, and his gifts are without repentance who hath promised it. Rom. 11. 2 Iesus Christ makes conti∣nuall intercession for vs. Luke 22 33. 3 The holy Ghost shall abide with vs to the end of the world. Iohn 16. to preserue vs. Iohn 14. 4 We are the beloued of God: and therefore. 1 Whom hee loues once hee
will loue to the end. Iohn. 13. 2 Whatsoeuer wee aske in his name, the father will giue vs, if it bee agreeable to his will. 1. Iohn 5. 14. 3 All things shall turne vnto our good. Rom. 8. 29. 4 Wee are maried to him for euer in holines and righteousnes: Ose. 2. 5 Gods couenaunt with vs, is euerlasting. Ieremie 30. Eze∣chiel 11. Psalme. 89. & Ose. 2. 6 Wee are vnited vnto Christ our head, Collossians, 2. and giuen to him of the Father, and there∣fore none shall take vs out of his hands Iohn 10. Iohn 17. 17. 7 Wee haue the word and sa∣craments, which shall continue with vs to the worlds end, to vp∣hold vs in our righteousnes. Mat. 28. 8 Wee haue strengthning grace to continue vs in wel-doing. Ephe. 3. 16. 9 Our slips, and fallings, are meanes to perseuerance. Here Consider.
1 That the child of God being rege∣nerated, may, and doth fall: and that because: 1 God leaues him often to him∣selfe.Sect. 3. Remouing the hinde∣rances, here of the falls of Gods children, Ose. 5. Psal. 30. and that, 1 To let him see his own strength to be humbled thereby. Hose. 14. 4. 2 To driue from that hold, to rely onely vpon God. Cantic. 3. 4. Luc. 22. 32. 3 To make him more compas∣sionate and helpfull to others in their infirmities. 2 Satan is continually sifting of him. Luk. 22. 3 He caries about him a traytor readie to betray him hourely. 1. Pet. 2. 11. 4 His falles may well stand with his estate in grace, yea doe much make for the triall and encrease thereof. 1. Pet. 1. 7. As in his fall, 1 He discernes his imperfection, and so is prouoked to take stronger hold. Canti. 3. 4. 2 In his recouerie he feeles the vndoubted grace of God. Psal. 32. 3 In both he hath experience
of the combats betweene the flesh and the spirit, al which are vndoub∣ted signes of regeneration. Luk. 11. 21. 4 He is made more acquainted with the deceitfulnes of sinne, and so more skilfull to preuent the same. Heb. 3. 13. 5 He is shamed by his fall, and driuen from the hold of the world, and such like baits of sinne. Hose. 14. 4. 6 he is prouoked more egerly to follow after the mark, by how much he hath beene cast behind. 2. Cor. 11. 7 He becomes more fearfull of himselfe, and will not be so ventu∣rous vpon the occasions of sinne. Mat. 26. 75. Consider therefore, 2 How farre a regenerate man may fall: First, In his faith, by doubting of Gods fauour and the assurance of his saluation. Psal. 22. Psal. 51. Psal. 77. Hence proceedes 1 Proud and foolish reasonings
against God. Ier. 12. 1. 2 Vaine and vncharitable spee∣ches and wishes against our selues, Iob. 3. 3 Distasting of the meanes and furtherances to saluation. 4 The graces of God may bee lessened in them. Psal. 51. 5 They may be couered. 6 Losse of some graces of God all his life long. 2 Erring through ignorance in some maine point of saluation, so the Apostles, Acts 1. 6. 3 He may dwel in his ignorance for a time, and maintaine the same, Gal. 2. Peter. Secondly, in his life. and that, 1 By falling into some grosse sinnes. 2. Sam. 11. 2. Sam. 24. 2 To lie a sleepe in them till he be roused vp. 3 To fall into them againe after repentance, and so may sinne pre∣sumptuously. Mat. 26. Hence will follow: 1 That the light of Gods coun∣tenance shal be taken away. Ps. 51. 2 The horrors of hel shal assault
and buffet him, and so hee may despaire. Psal. 77. 11. 3 Some grieuous outward af∣flictions shall follow him to the graue. Dauid. 4 His life shall be a burthen and irksome to him. Iacob. and he shall be impatient vnder the crosse. Iob 3. 7. 5 Hee shall cause the name of God to be blasphemed by the wic∣ked. 2. Sam. 12. 6 His first loue shall be cooled, and zeale in godlines abated. Apo. 2. 4. 7 The weake shall be offended at him. 8 Gods Spirit shall be grieued. Ephes 4. 9 He shall feele a weakenesse in him in regard of such sinnes as haue got strong hold often ouer him. Psal. 6. Ier. 13. 23. Thus farre may a regenerate man all,And the difference betweene them and the wick∣ed. and yet remane in the state of grace, and differ from a reprobate, or hypocrite, As thus: 1 The reprobates tēporary faith is the chiefe cause of his falling and prophanes in life; but the elects
errour in life is the occasion of the decay of his faith. 2 The hypocrite is vsually sense∣les in his fall, and so continues 1 Tim 4. 2 but the regenerate at lēgth hath the true sightofit. 2. Sam. 24. 10 3 The hypocrite if he fret an greeue, it is for feare of punishment or losse of the temporall blessing not for the losse of Gods fauour &c. Psal. 51. Gen. 27. But 4 They both fall into the sam sinnes againe, but yet the hypocr after sinnes committed with mor strength and securitie, the regene∣rate with more resistance, feare griefe, and in great weakenes. Ps. 19 5 They both are impatient, an speake foolishly against God, bu the hypocrite speake as he thin∣keth and wisheth in the aduisednes and purpose of his heart: the rege∣nerate speakes in folly, rashnes, not as he thinketh or wisheth, but as his corruption ouerruling him doth mislead and comming to him∣selfe, condemne himselfe for it & cleares the Lord. Ps. 73. Iob 42 6 They both decay and los
their first loue, but yet the hypo∣crite counts this to bee his wise∣dome, and the true measure of ho∣lines, esteeming his former zeale to be rashnes, &c. whereas the rege∣nerate acknowledgeth it was better before then now, and mourning vnder his estate labours the recouery and in some measure obtaines it. 2. Sam. 12. Mat. 26. 7 They both may refuse the meanes also, but yet the hypocrite in pride and obstinacie, falles at length, from loose meanes to none, and so to a despising and persecu∣ting the same: the elect though hee leaue in his heart, yet hee returnes with shame, and cleaues more con∣scionable to the meanes and is pro∣fited thereby. 8 They both may be losers by their fall, and not recouer all their life long: but with these differences. 1 The reprobate loses all gra∣ces and becomes a very beast. Psal. 49. without knowledge, ciuility, &c. The regenerate recouers neces∣sarie graces, as faith in some mea∣sure of vse and feeling: but that full
perswasion ioy in the spirit, &c. he happily recouers not againe all his life long. 2 The reprobates losse is with∣out feeling, causing him to set vp his rest more securely in this life, and so prepares him to sudden de∣struction: that of the elect humbles him in all things, causes him to worke out his saluation with feare and trembling, to goe downe with sorrow to his graue, and to be wea∣rie of the world, and to desire to be with Christ. Phil. 2. 12. This may we discorne betweene the fall of Gods children and the wicked. And this serueth. 1 To trie vs in our decaies, and to comfort vs in the same. Pro. 24. 16. 2 To iustifie Gods faithfulnes who neuer forsakes his children. 1. Cor. 10. 13. 3 To stop the mouthes of the wicked, who reioyce at our falles▪ Mich. 7. 8. 4 To assure vs of constancie & perseuerance to the end. 2. Tim. 4▪ 18.

Thus must our prayers be made vnto the Lord▪ and by them we shall be, First, Much strengthened in the grace of perseuerance. Luke 22. 32. as also. 2 Kept in the vigor and power of our Christian life. Ephes. 6.2 The benefit of prayer. 3 Experienced in our sweet fel∣lowshippe with God. Romanes 8. 15. 4 Our spirituall armour alwaies fitted and exercised. Ephes. 6. 5 Our daily wants supplied or recompensed. Iames 1. 5. 2. Corint. 12. 6 Tentations conquered; and happily diminished Mat. 4. 7 All our occasions well seaso∣ned & turned to our good 1. Timo. 4. 8 Our whole life sanctified, and we prepared comfortably to a bet∣ter. Phil. 1. 19. CHAP. XV.Of peace with God, and lying downe therewith AND thus beeing prepared, wee are ready for sweete Peace with
God either to lay our selues downe ther∣with in peace to our sweete repose, or to yeeld vp our liues with ioy vnto the hands of our redeemer. Psal. 4. 8. Acts 7. 59. 1. Cor. 1. 7. And this is the last duety daily to be performed of vs: and this peace is principally to be laboured to vs; Because, 1 We must respect not so much what we haue done,1 It neces∣sity. but how the Lord hath accepted it. Rom. 5. 1. 2 Heereby wee shall with cou∣rage go forward, and be comforte in the imperfection of our actio 2. Cor. 8. 3 We shal obtaine & maintain that vnspeakeable ioy of the hol Ghost in our hearts, Phil. 4. 4. & a∣uoyd the contrary sadnes and di∣straction which proceedes from want of this peace. 4 We shall refresh the graces of God in cōmending them thus with our selues to the peace of God.2 How obtained. Now this duety is performed and blessing obtained: 1 By performing the daily duties in their former order and with con∣stancy.
2 If by some vrgent occasion or tentation we haue bin interrupted, yet to returne to thē, & to redouble what we haue omitted the next day 3 And this to be done not super∣ficially with wearisomnes or of cu∣stome, but determiately & for con∣science sake. 4 Examine thy selfe, how thou couldest one houre well be without one of the former graces, as without the comfort of the remission of thy sinnes, &c. 5 Iudge and earnestly bewaile thy selfe, if thou hast either omitted or sleightly performed any of these. 6 Be sure so to performe these, as that thou doest not neglect thy cal∣ling. 2. Thess. 3. 12. 7 If thou hast performed them in some poore measure, yet rest not in it, but labour more earnestly with God for a further grace. Phil. 3. 13. 8 And yet be thankful vnto God for these small grapes and fruits, ac∣knowledging that it is his great mercie, that thou canst doe any thing, and giuing him all the glorie thereof. 1. Corinthians. 15. 10. And
thus shalt thou bee sure to obtaine this peace of God. And hauing obtained it, thou must lie downe therewith, and carie it with thee to thy bed. 1 Because thou knowest not whether thy bed shall be thy graue. 1. Pet. 1. 24. 2 Thy sleepe heereby shall bee much sweeter, and dreames more comfortable. Psal. 4. 8. 3 Thou shalt auoyd nocturnall pollutions and vncleannesses. 4 Thy reines shall teach thee in the night season, and the darkenesse shall be as the noone day. Psa. 16. 7. And this is performed: 1 By resigning vp our selues into the hands of God.3 How performed 2 Ascribing vnto him the glorie of all the good we haue performed. Psal. 115. 1. Esay 26. 12. 3 Acknowledging our selues to bee vnprofitable seruants, if God should enter into iudgement with vs. Luke 17. 10. 4 Crauing earnest pardon of our imperfections in Isus Christ, and laying our selues asleepe in his bo∣some.
1. Iohn 1. 9. 5 Comforting our selues (if sense of faith be not present) yet with for∣mer experience and inward habit thereof. Psal. 22. 10. 6 Yeelding vp our selues in a willingnes to death, in full expecta∣tion of the life to come. Phil. 1. 20, 23. And thus guiding our selues by these former rules, we shal lie down in peace, and so shall we comforta∣bly performe the daily sacrifice. And thus far concerning such ne∣cessarie dueties, as we are bound in some measure daily to performe. CHAP. XVI. FOR our better encouragement and furtherance heerein;How to profit in this dire∣ction. obserue these rules: 1 That being conuinced in con∣science with the necessity of these dueties, wee purpose and solemnly vow vnto the Lord the attempting and prosecuting thereof. Psal. 119. 106. Psal. 119. 7. 2 That God principally respects
the purpose of the heart, and if there be a willing mind, accepts accor∣ding to what we haue, and requires not what we haue not. 2. Cor. 8. 12. 3 That we giue not eare to the flesh pleading noueltie, impossibi∣lity, &c. Gal. 1. 16. 4 That we trie the Lord, who is wonderfull in blessing the vnfained endeuours of his children. Hag. 2. Malachi. 3. 10. 5 Then let vs make triall at first in one of these, and grow readie therein, so shall we with more wil∣lingnes and skilfullnes proceed in the rest. Iames 2. 10. Iames 3. 2. 6 Let vs not faile to meete the Lord with vnsayned thankfulnes, when we see him comming effectu∣ally in the weak performance ther∣of. Psal. 81. 7 And so condemne and pro∣uoke thy selfe, as before, and thou shalt see (by Gods mercie) a good crease. Yea, thou shalt not onely be able to performe these duties with comfort, but also thou shalt be a∣ble to entertaine each seuerall
occasions of the day, to Gods glo∣rie, thy exceeding profit, and bene∣fit of others. CHAP. XVII. AND this is the second part of this daily sacrifice:Of right imploying the occasi∣ons of the day. Namely to con∣secrate our daily occasions, as a reasonable sacrifice vnto God. Here obserue. First, That though the occasions of the day are diuers, and so not more necessary, and easily to be di∣rected, yet some principall there are which doe vsually occur. The well ordering whereof will easily in∣forme vs, in the holy entertayning of the rest: CHAP. XVIII. And these Principall are: FIrst, To arise with God,Of rising with God and awak∣ing in his peace. and as wee layed our selues downe in peace,1 The ne∣cessity thereof. so to awake with the com∣fort thereof. Psal. 23. 6. Lam. 3. 23. The reason whereof is: Because: 1 Wee maintaine hereby con∣constancie
in wel-doing. 2 Wee renue that soundnesse wherewith we laie downe. 3 We preuent that no roote of bitternes breake out at the first. 4 We prouide for our more setled courses all the day after, and so begin a new to liue the daily life of grace. 5 Wee make our hearts mery in the Lord. 6 Wee are made principally more apt to prayer, which is the next occasion to bee entertayned of vs. This is performed: 1 By meditating, of the true life of God,2 How perfor∣med. and day of the rresurection. 1. Cor. 1. 2 By magnifying our sweete repose, and resting in the bo∣some of Gods protection. Psalme 3. 5. 3 Taking occasion by the light that appeareth, to consider of the armour of light; or by the out∣ward darkenesse that compasseth, to blesse God for the inward light
and to mourne for the igno∣rance and blindnes that is yet in vs, yea to resolue the casting a∣way of the workes of darkenesse. &c. Rom. 13. 12. 4 Praysing the mercie and pa∣tience of the Lord, that yet wee liue to prayse him, and are spared to make our election more sure▪ and thereto especially meditating on the constancie of Gods loue toward vs. Iohn 13. 1. Psalme 19. 2. Psal. 102. 27. Ieremie Lament. 3. 23. And this is furthered if wee per∣ceiue dulnes. 1 By striuing euen in the night when wee awake,3 How furthered. to sigh for sinne, and hunger after mercy. Psal. 16. 7. Cant. 31. 2 By opening our hearts (if oc∣casion serue) to our chambersel∣low, if such fellowshippe be enioy∣ed, and so shaming of our selues Iacob 5. 3 By auoyding ouermuch sleep, ea scanting and stinting our selues thereof, and rowsing vppe our
selues from drousines by checking our hearts and complayning of them to our blessed God. Proue. 24. 32. 33. 4 Taking occasion by our dreams or nocturall infirmities, to magnifie Gods mercie, that it is not so as we dreamed; or to checke our infide∣lity, in relying superstiously vpon dreames; or to condemne our secu∣rity, and prophanenes in neglecting them vtterly. And if we haue beene assaulted, with terrors and corrup∣tions, yet either they haue not pre∣uayled, or shall not be imputed vn∣to vs. 5 Calling to mind some place of the word for our better stirring vp, as Rom. 13. 11. 12. 13. 14. Ephes. 5. 14. 1. Thes. 5. 4. 5. &c. And prouo∣king our selues by the examples of the saints, who haue risen early to prayse the Lord. Psal. 5. 34. &c. And so rising with the Lord, we shall he fitted to entertaine the next speciall occasion of the day: Which is Prayer.
CHAP. XIX. THE necessity and right vse thereof you haue before;Of Family and pri∣uate prai∣er. Onely here obserue these points for direction herein: As First, That howsoeuer this duety of praier in familes be neglected,Sect. 1. It necessi∣ty. and not esteemed necessary, yet the not vse thereof at all, argueth irre∣ligion, and contempt of God. Psal. 14. 4. Secondly,Sect. 2. Often to be perfor∣med, and by whom. That not once, but oftentimes in the day wee must performe the same. Daniel 6. 10. Thirdly, And that not onely in priuate in our closets, &c. but pub∣liquely with our families. Genes. 18. 19. Iob 1. 5. Fourthly, That the Master of the familie is fittest to be the mouth of God▪ for his people, as beeing therein their Priest and Prophet. Reuel. 1. 6. Fiftly, That to this end, set times are to be appointed and kept con∣stantly, vnlesse by sickenes or other
more inuincible occasions wee be interrupted. Sixtly,Sect. 3. The man∣ner how. That we keepe our selues in an holy temper, and peace of minde by a constant course in all occurrents, and so prepare our selues to prayer. 1 Fixing our hearts on God, and meditating of his power and Maiestie, to worke reuerence in vs. 2 Looking vnto Iesus the author and finisher of our faith, to breede affiance. Heb. 12. 2. 3 Considering and examning our wants, to breede humilitie and pati∣ence. Psal. 39. Psal. 4. 6. 4 Excluding worldly ares which may hinder deuction. Luke 8 Mat. 6. 5 Not fretting at the prospertity of the wicked. Psal. 37. 1. 6 In patience, bearing the wrongs of enemies, and leauing reuenge to God. Rom. 12. 7 Doing al things as in Gods pre∣sence. 8 Auoyding euill for conscience sake.
9 Meditating still on the day of iudgement, lest we be vnfitted or in∣terrupted in prayer. 2. Pet. 3. 2. Cor. 5. 11. 7 Consider wee the manifold blessings wee haue eceiued from God to prouoke vs to thankesgiuing, without which our prayers are ineffectuall. Ephes. 6. &c. 8 Here it is requisite that wee also quicken our hearts by reading, and meditating twice, or oftner in the day on some part of the Scrip∣tures, either First, Taking the Scripture in order before vs. Nehemiah 8. Acts 13. Or els 2 Vpon extraordinarie occa∣sions, making choice of fit Scrip∣tures. 9 Bewaile wee seriously our neglect of closet prayer, and con∣demne wee our selues for our lip∣labour and customarie deuotions, our wearisomnesse in wel-doing, our contentment with little fee∣lings. 10 Renue wee our vowes for
more often & conscionable perfor∣mance hereof. 11 Rest we especially vpon the continuall intercession of our bles∣sed Aduocate, Iesus Christ, who continually maketh intercession for vs, and is now both praying for vs, and readie to present our prayers to the throne of grace, and to couer all the infirmities and failings of them. 12 Stirre wee vp the blessed Spirit (as before) which may helpe vs with sighes and groanes vnpeakeable. Rom. 8. 13 And be wee well aduised of the particular thing we desire, that it may be fit for God to giue vs, and vs to aske for our present occasion. Matth. 6. Iames 4. 2. Being thus prepared, we must powre out our prayers (as before.) Auoyding here especially: 1 Constraint, and ceremoniousnesse. 2 Customarinesse, praying rather for the times sake,Sect. 4. What to be auoy∣ded therin then for Gods glorie. Psal. 119. 108. 3 Conceit of the wel-doing here∣of
in regard of the thing done. 4 Pride and ostentation in the opinion of our wel-doing. Matthew 6. 5 Lip-labour and idle repetition of words. 6 Confusion and disorder, pray∣ing for earthly things before hea∣enly. Mat. 6. 33. 7 Carnalnesse, when wee praie more for earth than heauen. 8 Hypocrisie, doing it to bee seene of men. Mat. 6. 9 Vncharitablenes, praying for re∣enge, &c. of priuate wrongs. Eccle. 0. 20. Iam. 4. 7. 10 Wearisomnes and dulnesse. Gal. 6. Exod. 15. 11 Hastinesse and rashnesse, as we would faine haue done. 12 Presumption, begging such ings as are not seasonable. Luke 54. or beseeme vs not. 13 Impietie, praying for indul∣ence in sinne; or indenting with God, and limiting him to our will, helpe vs at such a time, or in such manner. Act. 1. Dan. 4. 14 Infidelitie, when wee pray
without the assurance of the accep∣tance of our persons, which is the case of all popish deuotion. Iac. 1. 6. Obseruing well: 1 That as well for the least bles∣sing,Sect. 5. Directi∣ons for prayer. as for the greatest wee sue to God in prayer, and so bee thanke∣full vnto him, left otherwise we de∣nie God the giuer, and so hinder our receiuing. 2 That wee measure not the prayer by the outward successe, because an euill prayer may bee heard in anger, Osee 13. and a good deferred in mercie: Yea a good prayer, though in much weake∣nesse, may be granted in loue, Mat∣thew 6. to keepe vs from despaire; and yet a more strong and fer∣uent prayer may be denied in grea∣ter loue, both to humble vs that wee put not confidence in the meanes, and to encourage vs to constancie therein, assuring our selues that the ssue of our prayers shall be gratious. 3 That in the greatest feeling of Gods mercie, we pray against tentations. Matth. 16.
4 That we especially commend vnto God the afflicted state of the Church, and desire our welfare in the prosperitie thereof. Psalme 122. 6. Psal. 126. 5 That we redouble our sighes and prayers, not suffering any re∣pulse. Psal. 119. 164. Matt. 15. Gen. 32. Gen. 18, &c. Ephes. 6. 6 That wee highly efteeme of the thing wee pray for. Matth. 5. 6. 7 That we finde as much com∣fort in abiding long at prayer, as at hearing the word. 8 That we be as readie to praise God for his mercies receiued, as to sue for the obtaining of them. Psal. 116. Luke 17. 12, 18. 9 That we rebuke our selues in our prayers, and relie onely vpon Christ. The benefit hereof is manifold:Sect. 6. The bene∣fit thereof, 1 We renue our right in the day. 1. Tim. 4. 4. 2 Wee arme our selues against tentations. Ephes. 6. 14. 15. 3 We are readie for any good that shall be offered vs, as consola∣tion of the sick, conference. &c.
4 We are prest to do al things in the sight of of God. 5 And so very much fitted and furthered to set vpon our callings. CHAP. XX. ANd this is the next maine occurren that falls out in the day,Callings, and follo∣wing thereof. euen to fol∣low our Callings. And here obserue. First, that to walke in a set calling for the common good, is the ordi∣nance of God imposed on euery Christian.Sect. 1. That it is Gods or∣dinance to walke in a calling 2. Thes. 3. 12. Gen. 3. 19 Ephes. 4. 28. And that: 1 To communicate Gods pro∣uidence in the gouernment of the world. 2 To maintaine a comely order in the administration thereof. 3 To imploy such varietie of gifts as God bestoweth on men aright. 4 To maintaine humane socie∣ties in the bond of peace. 5 To auoyde idlenes, and curi∣osity.
6 To preuent errors and distra∣ction in religion. 7 To fit vs to the ends of Gods prouidence. 8 That God may be glorified in ordering such infinite varietie of callings, both for the common, and each priuate good, and that espe∣cially for the life to come. And this serueth: 1 To teach vs to trie our cal∣lings by this, that they haue their warrant from the word of God, and that we be fitted thereto, and so to reiect the contrarie. 2 To sanctifie our callings by bounding them in the Lord. Ephes. 6. 1. because they are preserued by the same meanes by which they were ordained. Secondly learne we: That howsoeuer callings be the ordinance of God,Sect. 2. Callings to be ex∣pected by ordinary meanes. yet in these daies we are to expect them, 1 By the ministerie of men and 2 Our owne industrie fitting vs thereto. 3 Submitting our selues herein to the rule of the word.
And that because: 1 Extraordinary callings belon∣ged to the infancy of the Church and times of extremity, &c. 2 We haue a sure word better then any such extraordinary reue∣lation. Heb. 1. 2. Pet. 1. 3 The prouidence of God is sub∣ordinate to meanes. 5 God hath ordained this labor to humble vs, and withall to comfort vs in the right and vse of his bles∣sings. Eccles. 1. And this serueth: 1 To reproue presumption vpon extraordinary callings in these daies, and corruption in the obtai∣ning of them. 2 To teach vs for outward cal∣lings to depend vpon the meanes which God hath sanctified thereto, Namely; 1 The authority of the magistrate 2 Our fitnes to the calling. 3 And it fitnes for vs. 3 To condemne those that vn∣der pretence of Religion reiect hu∣mane callings. 4 And also to reproue such who
wander vp and downe, betaking themselues to no calling. 5 To conuince also those that thinke callings are onely appointed to get blessings, whereas indeede they both serue to get, and also to vse aright those that are cast vpon vs; wherein gentlemen are much faultie. Thirdly, Obserue we: That though it be the ordinance of God to haue a calling,Sect. 3. The right vse of our calling, specially to be stood vpon. yet it is not the hauing of a calling, but the right vse thereof, whereby we glo∣risie God, and further our selues to happines. 1. Cor 9. 1. Cor. 7. And this serueth: 1 For the condemnation of those that whē they are in a calling make no conscience thereof, esteeming it rather a reward of former seruice, then a place of further seruice. 2 For our instruction, that wee measure the worth of our calling by the right vse thereof, and onely in the same expect the blessings. Now that we may vse our callings aright, we must obserue these rules:
First,Sect. 4. How to vse our callings aright. our iudgements must bee further informed concerning our callings, and that by these directi∣ons. 1 That each one by profession, hath a general calling to be a Chri∣stian, which excludes not, but or∣ders the ciuill calling. 1. Cor. 2. 20. 2 That the calling which God hath placed vs in, is fittest for vs. Phil. 4. And this serueth: 1 Much for the maintenance of order, and the auoyding of confusi∣on in church and common-wealth. 2 To preuent idlenes and distra∣ction in our callings. 3 To secure vs of good successe therein. Thirdly, Learne we, That all our actions bee war∣ranted by our callings, as kept with∣in the compasse thereof. And that because: 1 Else they are not done in saith, and so cannot please God. He. 11. 2. 3 They doe exclude themselues out of the protection of the al∣mightie. Psal. 91.
And this serueth: 1 To condemne al busie bodies and presumptuous vsurpers of other mens callings, vpon what pretence soeuer. 2. Sam. 6. Ioh. 21. 21. 1. Pet. 4. 2 To discerne of the integritie of our actions; because euen a good action not warranted by a calling, is sinne. 3 To instruct vs, that though we see no likelhood of doing good, yet we must not draw backe so farre as our calling requireth. Ier. 1. 20. 19. Ezech. 2. 5. Esay. 6. &c. 4 To aduise vs how we may not buse Gods prouidence, and so ex∣pose our selues to his iustice. 5 To comfort vs in the ill suc∣cesse of our endeauours, when wee haue done what becommeth vs for the redresse thereof, that our la∣bour shall not bee in vaine. 1. Cor. 15. Esay. 49. 3. Fourthly learne we; That together with the follow∣ing of our earthly callings, we must ioyne the generall calling of Chri∣stianitie: because, 1 In seruing of man wee must
serue God. 2 And in prouiding for this life, we must also store vp for heauen. Luke 15▪ and 3 These things will not prosper vnles the better plough go to. Ag. 1. And this serueth: 1 To condemne those that pro∣phane their callings by neglecting the more necessarie. 2 To trie our estate in grace. 3 To comfort vs in our base cal∣lings, because God may as well be serued in these as in the greatest, and 4 To humble men in euery cal∣ling, the mightie, who thinke their calling either must not stoope to re∣ligion, or hath no leisure there to: the poore, who thinke their want to be a priuiledge from following their spirituall callings. Fiftly, Obserue we, That whatsoeuer shall be suffici∣ent for the right vse of our callings, shall be reuealed vnto vs from the word, & thēce to be warrāted. Ac. 9. And that because: 1 God is as well the ordainer of the meanes, as of the end.
2 And in his loue he will haue vs certaine what to doe. 3 And heereby presumption and distraction are happily pre∣uented. And this serueth: 1 To trie the fitnes and blessing of our callings. 2 To humble vs in regad of our ignorance and presumption. 3 To comfort vs if through want or ignorance we may faile in some point, be cause all is not reuea∣led at once, and to assure vs of good successe therein. Psal. 73. 4 To prouoke vs to seeke after knowledge as after treasures. Pro∣uerbs 2. 5 To teach vs not to presume vpon good meanings and intenti∣ons in our actions. 1. Sam. 13. 6 To condemne all rash and li∣centious actions whatsoeuer. Sixtly, We must be resolued: That our callings are imposed, not to merite by them, but to bee humbled and exercised in them, in thankefulnes vnto God, for his loue vnto vs in Iesus Christ.
And that because, 1 Christ Iesus hath sufficiently deserued for vs, and so we shall de∣rogate from his sufficiency. 2 God doth not require it at our hands. Esay 1. 3 We are neuer able to performe it, but euen when we haue done all we can, wee are vnprofitable ser∣uants. Luke 17. 10. And this, 1 Condemneth all Popish and voluntarie seruice. 2 It encourageth vs in our cal∣lings, seeing God requireth but what we can, nay, what he giues. 3 It comforteth vs in our im∣perfections, and taketh away that flauish feare of hirelings and mer∣cenaries. 4 It assureth vs of our saluation. Seuenthly, Learne we, That though we faile in the best, yet notwithstanding we must not faile to doe our best in our callings. And that, 1 By this faithfulnes, wee may witnes that our callings are sancti∣fied vnto vs, in our obedience to
God in them. 2 That they may be meanes of our enioying of heauen. 1. Tim. 6. 19. 3 That we may be also possessers of greater glorie in the heauens. Mat. 25. 26. &c. And this serueth: 1 To condemne al time-seruing, and customary in our callings. Eph. 6. 5, 6. 2 Wee are prouoked to striue with the best for the best gaine, & in these things to seek after heauen. And this is done: By walking in our callings by faith and not by feare, that so both our persons and actions may bee approued. And this is knowne: 1 Being warranted frō the word, in what we do, or intend. 2. Pet. 1. 2 Our consciences conuinced from the word to the same: and also 3 Witnessing with vs in what we doe. And that, 1 With cheerefulnes, not making hast to be rich, but casting our care vpon God, and committing the suc∣cesse
to him. 1. Pet. 5. Eccle. 9. 9. 2 With diligence, redeeming the time, and entertaining the meanes of Gods prouidence, and not being wilfully guilty of the neglect there∣of. Ephe. 3. 16. 17. 3 In wisedome, doing the most ne∣cessary duety and submitting alwaies these earthly callings to the furthe∣rance of the heauenly, and expres∣sing our spiritual calling, euen in the vse of this, & so auoyding negligēce that we be not intangled with co∣uetousnes. 4 In loue & meeknes, making o∣thers partakers of the benefit of our labours. 5 In patience, not tying God so much to the outward blessing of our labors, as contēting our selues with the testimony of our good consci∣ence therein. Heb. 13. 18. 6 With conscience, doing that which may be most profitable to Church & Cōmon-weale: wherby are condemned all vaine, and new fangled inuentions, as rather main∣taining sin, then breeding any good to the Common-wealth. Zeph. 1. Esay 3. 19. 20.
7 In holines, sanctifying thē dai∣ly by the word & praier. 1. Tim. 4. 5. 8 With constancy, loboring against ambition, enuy, & impatiency, and assuring our selues that our meanest endeuours shalbe accepted in Iesus Christ. 9 To the glory of God, ayming at it in all things, and preferring it a∣boue all 1. Cor. 10. 31. Admiting here these considerations:Sect. 5. How to leaue cal∣lings. 1 That we are not bound to our callings any longer then meanes & maintenance is supplied, but that in this respect we may leaue or change our callings; yea, for the publick good also the caling may be chāged 2 That we may intermit our cal∣ings.Sect. 6. How to intermit them. And that, 1 For Religions sake, as to heare the word, &c. vnlesse some bond of couenāt, or necessary present occa∣sion come betweene. 2 We may also intermit our cal∣lings to serue the publicke good, or to minister to the present and vrgent ne∣cessity of our neighbour, our present case allowing it. 3 Recreation also requires a va∣cancie from our callings. So that
1 Our recreation bee in things lawfull. 2 That it be moderate. 3 And that vpō the daies of labor. 4 That it further not onely the particular, but the generall calling. Fourthly, Necessitie also may im∣pose a surceasing of our calling. As when: 1 By sicknes we are detayned, or some such inuincible casualtie. Thirdly, we must resigne vp our callings. And that: 1 When God cals by death. 2 When other meanes war∣ranted by the conscience, guided by the word do, require and: that, 3 With testimonie of a good conscience. 1. Sam. 12. 3. 4 By giuing vp our account for them vnto the great iudge. Heb. 13. Thus are wee to performe our callings. The benefite whereof is exceeding great.Sect. 7. Benefit of callings. For: 1 Hereby wee shall be sure to be fed. Psal. 37. 2 We shall be better fitted to our generall callings.
3 We shall lay vp a good foun∣dation for heauen. 1. Tim. 6. 19. 4 We shal exercise herein many spirituall graces. 1. Cor. 7. as pati∣ence, faithfulnes, &c. 5 Hereby we shal perceiue Gods power, and holines, euen in these base and meane things, and bee prouoked to seeke him in greater blessings. Mat. 6. 6 We shall be humbled, and so prouoked to hunger after our dis∣solution. And thus farre concerning our behauiour in our callings. CHAP. XXII. THe next maine incident to the day,Of the right vse of the creatures. is the vse of the creatures. And these are of two sorts. 1 Such as serue for the necessary preseruation of life, as food, apparell. 2 Such as serue especially for the better being of the soule, as company. Concerning food and sustenance, ob∣serue these rules. 1 That euery creature is good, and that there is no more holines in the one, thē in the other. 1. Tim. 4. 5. , though each Christian
hath a right to all the creatures, yet is he to be restrayned in the vse of them. And that by these limits: 1 The bond of Religion, which enioynes some times an intire absti∣nence from the creature, that so we might be better fitted to spirituall duties. 1. Tim. 5. 23. 1. Pe. 5. 8. Ion. 3. 2 The bond of Christian policie may restraine vs the vse of some creatures on some daies, for the be∣nefit of the Common-wealth, to which we ought to obey for consci∣ence sake. Rom. 13. 5. 3 The bond of nature restraines vs that we may not eat but for necessi∣tie. Eccles. 10. 16. Mat. 12. 1. 4 The bond of conscience and equi∣ty also enioynes vs, that we may not lawfully eate, vnlesse we haue labo∣red for it. 2. Thess. 3. 12. 5 The bond of our callings binds vs so to eate, as our Chrstian calling may be furthered and out Ciuil cal∣lings will maintaine. 1. Tim. 5. 8. 6 The bond of Charity wills vs not to eat our morsels alone, but to prouide and reserue somewhat for
the poore. Iob 29. 31. Psalme 16. Neh. 8. 7 The bond of Sobriety restraines s from faring deliciously euery day, & from far-fetcht dainties, but to vse our liberty as if we vsed it not, auoiding vnnecessary prouocations of gluttony. Esay 5. 9. 10. Luk. 16. 1. Cor. 7. 23. 8 The bond of contentment, which wisheth the seruant not to enuie at the more liberall fare of his Master, but each to bee content with the portion that is fit for him. 1. Tim. 6. 6, 8. Thirdly, we are to renue our right in the creature by daily sanctifying them vnto vs by the word & praier. 1. Tim. 5. 1. Sam. 9. 13. And that: 1 By acknowledging our selues vnworthy of them. Gen. 32. 10. 2 Giuing God the glory of them with thanksgiuing. Mat. 26. 3 Seasoning them with holy and religious thoughts, and cheerefull yet profitable conference. Iudg. 14. Luke 14. 4 Offering the strength of them
vnto God in our callings.Sect. 2. The bene∣fit thereof. 1. Kings 19. 8. The benefit hereof is: 1 We shall auoyd superstition, and that damnable doctrine of diuels. 1. Tim. 4. 2. 2 We shall be better enabled to spirituall duties. Matt. 26. 30. 3 we shall vse our Christian li∣bertie aright. Rom. 14. 4 Wee shall further nature to grace. 5 We shall eate of our owne, and so be blessed. Psal. 128. 1. 6 We shal prouide safely for the time of famine, and eate to liue. Psa. 33. 19. Psal. 37. 7 We shall make vs friends of this Mammon of iniquitie, and ease our selues wel of an heauy burthen. Euke 16. 8 We shall be readie to die, and prepared to the meate that shall en∣dure for euer. Iohn 6. 27. And thus much concerning our food.Of com∣pany, and The like may we conceiue con∣cerning our ap∣parell.
CHAP. XXII. AS touching company,Of com∣pany and we are to ob∣serue these points: First, The kindes of company, which are, Good or Bad. Here learne, First, To discerne good and euill company. As thus: First, Those are to be esteemed good,Sect. 1. How to discerne good and bad com∣pany. which 1 Are of the same profession with vs. Ephes. 5. 11. Psalme 15. 4. 2 Who labour to holinesse and sincerity of life. Ephes. 5. 3 Who suffer with vs for the same profession. 4 Who loue the Saints, and long of the appearance of Christ Iesus 1. Cor. 1. 2. Thess. 3. 14. Secondly, Those are to be accounted euill: 1 Who speake euil of the power of profession Iud. 2. Pet. 2. 2 That refuse to participate in the meanes of holines. 3 That disgrace profession with a prophane life. Ephe. 5. 6.
4 That hate to be reproued, and continue obstinate in their sinne. Iohn, 2. Epist. 5 That betray and persecute the saints of God. Mat. 10. Secondly,Sect. 2. What company to be cho∣sen, and how to be refused. learne Principally to make choice of good companie. Psal. 15. Thirdly, obserue we, That wee are not to refuse the worst companie vpon these condi∣tions: 1 If thy calling require and al∣low thee, for their good, especially being sought vnto. Matthew 3. 5. Luk. 14. 1. 2 If vpon occasion thou fall vp∣on them, or they into thy compa∣nie. 1. Reg. 18. Act. 17. 17. 3 If they be in any extremitie thou art to seeke to them. Luke 10. 33. 4 So thou doe not returne to them,Sect. 3. How to behaue our selues in good company. but reclaime them to thee. Ier. 15. 19. Fourthly, learne how to behaue thy selfe in companie. Concerning good company there are these rules:
1 Christian Salutation and greeting each other in the Lord. Ruth. 2. 2 To be large hearted, and offer the most pretious pearls vnto them. Math. 13. 3 To vse among them more cherefulnesse and familiaritie. 4 To exhort one another to con∣stancie. Heb. 3. 14. 5 To reproue each other for knowne or suspected infirmities. Leuit. 19. 17. Gal. 2. 11. 13. 6 Taking occasion by some pre∣sent blessing or iudgement, to pro∣uoke to repentance, or thankeful∣nesse. Gen. 33. 11. Gen. 49. 9. 15. 7 Ioyning together in prayer, at lest once before breaking vp. Ephe∣sians 6. 8 Aduising each other for out∣ward occasions, but sparinglie. Phil. Epist. 2. Tim. 4. 13. 23. 9 Commending each other to their priuate remembrances. Ephes. 6. 19. Act. 20. 32. 10 In their conference to keepe an holie order, that the grauest, and most experienced may both begin
and moderate, without interruption or preiudice of any ones gifts. 1. Cor. 14. Iob. 32. 4. The end and vse of good com∣pany is: 1 To draw vnderstanding out of them by conference.Sect. 4. The bene∣fit of good company. Luke 24. Ioh. 4. 2 To receiue comfort in our in∣ward and outward troubles. Ruth 2. 13. 3 To be merry and cheerefull in the Lord. Psal. 32. 11. 4 To maintaine loue and Chri∣stian vnity. Psal. 133. 1. 5 To nourish our hope and vni∣on in the fellowshippe whcih is a∣boue. Col. 1. 5. Now good company is either:Sect. 5. Difference of good company. Set & appointed; or occasionall. Set company is to either spiritual or ciuill ends. That which is to spirituall ends is either, 1 Publique. 2 Priuate. The set publique meetings of the Saints are of two sorts: 1 Principall and necessary.
2 Accessory and occasionall.Sect. 6. Of Sab∣bath so∣ciety. The Principall meetings are such which doe immediatly concerne and are so imployed in the worship of God. And these are: First, The weekely meetings on the Sabbath. And herein obserue these rules:And it rules. First, That we prepare each o∣ther thereto, by 1 Counsell, and 2 Encouragement. 3 Examining our wants, and 4 Labouring to bee found in Christ. Eccles. 4. Phil. 3. 5 With prayer for the ministery of the word. Col. 4. 6 Instructing our families. 2. Thesse. 3. and 7 Condemning our former abuse of the Sabbath. 8 Renuing our vowes for more conscionable obedience for the time to come; and lastly, medita∣ting on the eternall Sabbath. Secondly, That we come toge∣ther to the assemblies, & not stragle but that we may be partakers of the
whole worship of GOD. Actes 13. 44. Thirdly, that wee vse all holy and reuerend gesture to further at∣tention to the holy things, as to stand vp, to look vpon the preacher, &c. Luk. 4. 20. Num. 23. 18. 4 That wee faile not priuat∣elie to stire vp one another (as we perceiue dulnes) to watchfulnes & heed-taking, by iogging, &c. 5 That we ioine with the congre∣gation in such parts of Gods wor∣ship as then are presently performing 1. Cor. 14. Act. 20. 36. 6 That wee continue out the performance thereof, wayting for the blessing, vnlesse more vrgent occasion call away. Mathew 24. 20. 7 That we confere with our fa∣milies and neighbours some few to∣gether, of such lessons as we haue publiquely heard, desiring to be sa∣tisfied by our minister of doubtfull points. Act. 17. 8 That we count this our onely recreation for this day to build vp the soule in knowledge and holi∣nesse.
Esay. 58. 13. Hitherto serue the priuate exercises. As 1 Sanctifying our selues daily in the familie, by prayer and instructi∣on of our people. Genesis 18. 19. Act. 10. 2 Examination of our selues, & people concerning the publique mi∣nisterie and triall of our profiting thereby. 3 Our soliloquies and secret con∣ferences with God; and these are either set, or sudden, vpon the ex∣traordinarie occasion. The vse hereef is: 1 That without these we must not looke for any benefite in the publique. 2 By these we shall be enabled thereto, and assured of a blessing therein. A Second publique meeting for Gods worship,Sect. 7. Publicke thankesgi∣uings and their rules. are the solemnities of thankesgiuing for extraordinarie blessings receiued. Exod. 15. Hest. 9. Est. 8. &c. And these are to be performed: 1 By the lawfull authoritie of
the Christian Magistrate. 2 They are to bee kept as Sab∣boths, with, 1 Like preparation. 2 Cessation from worke. 3 Contribution to the poore, & 4 Spirituall exercise of the word and prayer. 1. Cor. 16. 2. Hest. 9. 5 Onely here may be a more li∣berall vse of Gods creatures, in re∣gard of inuitation of the poore, and enlarging of Christian liberty vp∣on the occasion. 1. Samu. 9. 23, 24. Gen. 21. 8. 6 These are so be kept, that wee be fitted and prepared thereby, to other the like dueties of thankesgi∣uing vpon priuate occasions, not that the performance hereof should make amends, and cut off these. Luke 16. Esth. 1. 7 That herein we auoyd: 1 Customarines. 2. Pet. 2. 13. 2 Opinion of merit. 3 Superstition. Iud 12. and 4 Wil-worship Col. 2. 16, 21. A third publique spirituall mee∣ting,Sect. 8. Publique fasts. is that holy exercise of Fasting and Prayer. Luke 5. 33. Acts. 1.
And here obserue: 1 The Author,1 The Au∣thor. which must bee the Christian Magistrate. Ionah 3. 7. 2 The occasion,2 Occasi∣on. which is mani∣fold, As 1 The ouerflowing of sinne, threatning some grieuous iudgmēt. 2 Some iudgement threatned, either by the word, or by some visi∣ble signe. 2. Chron. 20. Ion. 3. Ioel 2. Est. 4. 3 Some chastisement that is vp∣on the land. 4 When any special good is to be done for Church or common-weale. Exod. 19. Act. 13. 3. 5 When we feare the remoueall of some great blessings, as the word, &c. 6 When we see the like occasi∣ons in our neighbours, we are also for their cause to be humbled. Psal. 35. Thirdly, Consider we the manner how the duety of fasting is to bee performed. And that,3 Manner of perfor∣mance. 1 For the Solemnity of it must
bee kept as a Sabbath. Esay. 58. Zach. 7. 2 Here must be an abstinence, for the time from all meates, and all lawfull comforts, as thereby ac∣knowledging our selues vnworthie of life, vnles we shal hereby be vn∣fitted to prayer. Ioel 2. 13. 14. 3 We must also come before the Lord as beggers, in our meanest attire, as a signe of our humilitie: Ioh. 3. Est. 4. 4 Here must be a more solemne and particular confession of sinne, both in generall and particular, with more strong cries and grones to obtaine pardon for the same, as also a more publique profession of our faith, and apprehension of Gods fauour in Iesus Christ. Dan. 9. 6. 7. & Iol. 2. Fourthly,4 Time. consider we the time of a fast, which is at the least a day, sometimes two or three, as the oc∣casion is more vrgent. Hester 4. Ion. 3. Fiftly learne we the true vse and end of fasting.5. Ends. Which is: 1 Not to place religion in the
bodily abstinence, but to vse it as a meanes to further religion. Ioel 2. 13. Matt. 6. 2 Gods heauy wrath hath here∣by beene appeased, and iudgements kept out, and remoued, yea turned into blessings, Iudges 20. Ionas 3. And thus farre of the publique vse of spirituall socieie.Sect. 9. Of priuate spirituall societie. The priuate followeth, which is seene: 1 In the priuate exercise of reli∣gion in our families, as Prayer, Chatechising, reading of the word, Me∣ditation. 1 In priuate fasts and thankes∣giuings for familie and personall occasions. Wherein obserue: 1 That they are to be performed by the authoritie of the master of the familie. 2 That they are to be kept as Sabbaths. 3 That what is allowable in the publick may here be faultie, namely
shew and ostentation of that open∣ly which we doe in priuate. Matth. 6. Thirdly, Spiritual society is seene in holy conferences, and that First, Betweene the Minister and his flocke. Here obserue: 1 To auoyd curious and high speculations.1 How to be perfor∣med be∣tweene Minister and peo∣ple. 2 To reason of such things as concerne each others state. 3 And that not so much for de∣sire of knowledge as for conscience sake. 4 And that with al readines, and lowlines of mind. 5 And to resolue our selues and others. 6 That God may be glorified. Secondly,2 How betweene inferiours and supe∣riours. These conferences are betweene inferiour and supe∣riour. Here obserue, 1 That the elder haue the former place of speech. 2 That hee despise not the ad∣uice and opinion of the inferiour. Iob 31.
3 That each be submitted to o∣ther in the Lord, the stronger sub∣mitting himselfe to the capacity of the weake; and the weaker yeelding to the reason of the stronger. Thirdly,3 How betwene equals. This conference may fall out betweene equals. Here learne, 1 That some priority for order sake is to be vsed, and that to be gi∣uen in respect of the best gifts. 2 Contention must be auoyded by wise bearing with each other. 3 And also order kept in atten∣ding each others speech. And 4 Wisdom to preuent idle talke, and labour the resolution of each necessary doubt. In all these Conferences generally obserue these rules: 1 That we conferre of our own principally,4 Rules generall for all. & not of others estates. 2 That wee auoyd as much as may be worldlines, &c. 3 That we conferre of spirituall things seasonably, and within com∣passe. 4 That though it be lawfull to speake of things indifferent, yet wee
make choice to speake of what di∣rectly concernes holines. 5 That wee meddle not with State, or secret Domesticall occa∣sions. 6 That we intend Gods glorie and each others profit. 7 That we be swift to heare and slow to speake. Iam. 5. The triall of holy conference is this:5 Triall of right vse. 1 That if our desire of profiting others grow cold through carnall ioy, then we are to suspect that ioy. Ioh. 4. Act. 20. 2 That either both depart bet∣ter hereby, or else wee at the Ieast haue the testimony of a good con∣science herein, and giue not ouer the hope of good successe. 3 That we so part from com∣pany, that wee be fit to be alone. Mat. 14. 23. And thus farre of the spirituall vse of society concerning princi∣pally the worship of God.Sect. 10. Of Acces∣sory mee∣tings for Religion. The Accessorie meetings concer∣ning Religion follow: Such as tend to the furtherance
thereof. And that, 1 In the establishing of the truth. 2 Conuincing of error. And these are either, More generall:As Coun∣cels. 1 Such as are the general Coun∣cels and Synods, appointed and ga∣thered by the Christian Magistate, for the maintenance of true Re∣ligion, and the rooting out of he∣resies. Here obserue these rules: 1 That the Christian Magistrate is the chiefe moderator. 2 The word of God must bee the rule and iudge. 3 The end must be to maintaine the vnity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Ephe. 4. Secondly,Synods, &c. Some are lesse gene∣rall, as the national and prouinciall Synods of particular Churches, to be ordered in the same manner as before. Hitherto appertaine; 1 The schooles of the Prophets,And their apperte∣nances. as being the nurseries of Religion, & seminaries of the Church & com∣mon-weale.
Ie. 1. 1. Amo. 7. 14. Act. 6. 9. 2. Reg. 2. 15. 2 Religious feasts tending to nourish the fellowship of the Saints. Iud. 3 Contributions & collections for the poore. Thus farre of the Spirituall vse of society. The ciuill followeth,Sect. 11. Of ciuill society. and it is manifold. 1 State assembles to determine for the good of the body politick. 2 Corporations and Brother-hoods of Cities and Townes concerning the right vse of Trades and Myste∣ries. Thirdly, Contracts or bargaines, which must be with these conditi∣ons: 1 That wee vse no deceit either in word or deede, to entrappe or o∣uer-rate. 2 That our agreements be plaine without cunning, and voluntarie without catching. 3 That promise be kept vnlesse with consent on either side. 4 Mercie must be shewed, if we
haue our brother at an aduantage. Fourthly, Ciuill societie may fall out in Sutes and Controuer∣sies. Here obserue, 1 That these hinder not our spi∣rituall society in the worshippe of God.And rules for the same. 2 Neither impeach other ordi∣narie kindnesses, which ought to passe betweene neighbours. 3 But rather wee should suffer wrong then fal to these sutes. 1. Cor. 6. 4 And seeke wee after al meanes of priuate agreement. 5 That wee delay not sutes to wearie out our brother. 6 Much lesse by bribery seeke to ouerthrow a good cause. 7 But to ouercome euill with good, seeking peace and ensuing it. A fourth vse of society is for re∣creation. Here obserue: 1 That we be as carefull to vse our recreation a right, as to haue libertie in it.
2 That we make choice of a fit time, when wee haue neede, by reason of wearisomnesse in our cal∣lings. 3 Looke we vp still to God for continency in the vse of our liberty. 4 Our kinds of recreation must be honest & of good report. Ph. 4. 8. 5 We must vse great moderation of our affection therein. 6 We must be content to leaue off when by hope of gaine or com∣pany we see the abuse creeping on. 1. Thes. 5. 22. 7 Our company must be sutable, such as we may order; nay, such as may moderate vs. 8 Wee must not be ouer-tired with our pleasures, but made more fit both for our earthly and spiritual callings. A fift vse of society, is in loue feasts, vsuall for publique mee∣tings, and not vnfit among neigh∣bours to maintaine peace & amity. But here we must keepe these bounds: 1 That these feasts be not fre∣quented on the Sabbath day. Neh. 13. 15. 16.
2 In them not the priuate but the publick good must be intended. 3 Religion must be the square and moderator of them all, And 4 The end must be Gods glory. 1. Cor. 10. 31. And thus farre concerning set assemblies. There followeth occasionall: Such as are by accident.Sect. 12. Of occa∣sionall meetings. Here obserue: 1 That our principall desire and scope be to sort with the better. Ps. 16. 3. 2 That we make not choice wil∣linglie of euill company. Prouer. 22. 23, 24. 3 That if by occasion, as at meate,Sect. 13. How to sort with the wic∣ked. at set meetings, or by fellow∣ship in office, &c. we are linked with them, or be bound in conscience to visit them, or meete with them in our iournies, &c. Here we must auoyd; Hardning them in their sinne, by light familiarity, vaine applau∣ding, or winking at them, but rather we are to reproue, if not by word, yet by behauiour. Luke 14. 7.
2 We must not deiect them by our disdaineful or imperious beha∣uiour. 2. The. 3. 15. 1. Tim. 2. 25, 29. 3 Neither enrage them by vnsea∣sonable and ouer bitter reproofes, vnlesse Gods glorie presently lie in the ballance. Matth. 7. 6. But that we may benefit them, we are: 1 To conuerse grauely, and yet humbly with them. Nehemiah 2▪ 1. 2. 2 To waite some good occasi∣on from their speech, & so to worke vpon it. Acts 26. 3 To call to minde some present blessing or iudgement, that so wee may put by idle talke. Amos 6. 6. Esay 5. 12. 4 Commend we what is likely spoken of them, yet with an holie drawing them on to better by graue exhortations. 2. Tim. 2. 24, 25. 5 In all our speech let it appeare that loue is the ground, & the soules good the principall end. Matthew 5. 44. 6 Contrary we them not in their weakenesse alwaies, but expound it
to the best, vnles wee see apparent contempt and desperate scorning▪ Iud 22. 23. Rom. 14. 1. 7 If we cannot benefit by con∣ference, then let vs take heed we do not communicate with them in e∣uill, but rather breake off wisely as Sampson did, by some ridle or such like, and as neere as may be, leaue we thē with peace, thatso afterward there may be hope to winne them. 2. Thess. 3. 15. Rom. 12. 18. The vse of euill company is: 1 That we make the more of the better sort,Vse of e∣uill company. and labour to make the bad better. Ier. 15. 19. 2 That wee long after hea∣uen, where wee shall finde none but good company. Philippians 1. Heb. 12. 3 That we grow more priuate and learne to be a part with our God. Gen. 5 22. CHAP. XXIII. AND this is the next occasion of the day,Of solita∣rines. wisely to be intertained of vs. Namely, to order wisely our solitari∣nes,
and that because, First, Now we are naked, and lie open to tentations. Secondly, And may with best aduantage and lest hinderance pur∣sue the best things, and so are capa∣ble of the greatest good, or subiect to the greatest euill. Here therefore obserue these rules: 1 That though we be from the company of men,Sect. 1. How to behaue our selues therein. yet we haue the presence and fellowship of the Al∣mightie, and the ministery of his holy Angels, and therfore that now especially we reioyce in this fellow∣ship. Psal. 16. Psal. 139. 2 Yet so as that we neglect not our callings, but be sure that we be kept from idlenes. 2. Thess. 3. 3 That wee especially call to mind those ill neighbours which we shall neuer be rid of so long as wee liue, namely, our sinnes, and in our greatest freedome of solitatines for∣get not our bondage vnder this tyr∣ranny. Heb. 12. 1. 4 That we take heed of idle and curious speculations, feeding therby our melancholy or vaine thoughts.
5 That we be carefull to order and represse the infinite wandrings of the mind, which at such times is most busie and exorbitant. Gen. 6. 5. Dan. 4. 2. 6 Especially that we be wise to discerne satans deepenes, who now wil vsually most eagerly assault vs, either taking aduantage of our secu∣rity, because we are freed from out∣ward occasions, or working vpō pri∣uatenes & want of succour. Mat. 4. 7 That especially we meditate on heauenly things, comforting our selues with the holy protection of Angels, who attend vs, and reioy∣cing in the hope of that blessed fel∣lowship which expects vs in hea∣uen. Gen. 5. Gen. 24. 63. 8 At no hand giue we place to Satan, seeking now to scare or distract vs, but resist we strongly by faithful praier. 1. Pe. 5. 8. 9. 2. Ch. 3. 1 9 Presume not of such solitarines either which hath no warrant, as that of Monks, &c. or when thou art bound to society, for heerein thou excludest thy selfe the prote∣ction of the Lord. Eccles. 4. 9, 10.
Thus behauing our selues alone, 1 We shall neuer want the com∣fort of sweet communion. Mat. 28. Apoca. 3. 20. Iohn 14. 23. 2 Readie shall we bee for such troubles when we may be driuen to be alone. Apoca. 1. 9. 10. 3 Fitter also for the fellowship and communion of the saints. 1. Tim. 3. 4. 5. 4 Strenghtned against satan, who now wil principally assault vs. Mat. 4. Eccles. 4. 10. 5 And profitable redeemers of the time, and purchasers of eternity. Ephes. 5. 16. Prouided: 1 That we vexe not our selues with iting or enuying others busi∣nesse and states,Sect. 3. Cautions to be ob∣serued. lest hereby we be made vnfit for our owne. 1. Tim 5. 13. 2 That we ouerwhelme not our selues with ouermuch thinking of worldly things, especially of the times to come, or things which may happen, lest the heart bee drowned with the loue of the creature or appalled with feare of after-clapps.
Mat. 6. 34. Luke 21. 34. 3 In meditation of heauenly things, looke we that our custome heerein cause not a vilifying or loathing of such heauenly myste∣ries. Mat. 6. 7. Mat. 15. 9. 4 Take we heed of an ouerwee∣ning conceit of our selues, if thou findest a greater furniture of Gods graces. Iohn 5. 35. 5 Especially bee carefull that while thou meditatest of forsaking sin, thou beest not entangled with some spice thereof, either presuming further then thy present strength, or by cōceit of what thou doest, or by the deceitfulnes of Satan abusing thee with a contrarie colour of sin, while thoulabourest to preuent him in another. 6 And then in labouring to re∣ist sin, see thou beest well armed & know thy strength too: yet fearefull of thy selfe, and so humbly cast vp∣on God, that so thou mayest resist in the euil day. Ephes. 6. Prouer. 28. 14. Psal. 16. 8. And thus much concer∣ning solitarines.
CHAP. XXIIII. THE next imployment of the day how to behaue thy selfe in enioying of good things,Of pro∣sperity, and the right vse thereof. and in the right vse of prosperity: and the knowledge hereof is needefull. First,Sect. 1. Necessary to be knowne. Because the best haue been tripped in this estate, as Salomon, Io∣nas, &c. For first heereby religious exer∣cises haue beene coldly performed and intermitted. Mat. 22. 5. 2 Liberty hath beene giuen to loosenesse, and inward gifts growne cold. Hab. 1. 16. Amos 6. 5. 3 Euils that were banished,Danger of prosperity in the best. haue beene recalled againe, as gaming, &c. 1. Cor. 10. 7. 4 They weaken our trust and confidence in God. Hab. 1. 16. 5 Withdraw our loue and kind∣nes towards inferiours, with whom heretofore we haue been inward. 6 Breede policy, and so decei euen in many professors. Genes. 20. 11. And 7 Cause couetousnes and loue of this life. Psal. 62. 10. Luc. 12. 19.

Mat. 26. 9 Giue occasion to the world to thinke we are hers, and so causing her to presūe of vs, makes hir here∣by, being deceiued, when it comes to the proofe, our more heauie ene∣mie. Gen. 31. 10 Hereupon also it comes to passe that the burthen lies heauier vpon the afflicted, euen because of our prosperity, beeing not caried wisely, and tenderly. Amos 6. 5. E∣say. 5. 11 Yea, it is the occasion that causes vs many times to censure those that are afflicted, and to chal∣lenge their sincerity because of their afflictions. Iob 8. Iob 4. &c. 12 And not onely so, but it causeth iealousie among profes∣sors, and so distrust of each other, when all beare not the same bur∣then. Romanes 15. 1. Romanes 12. 13. 16. 2 This estate is very slippery, and therefore wee had neede to get
sure footing that we may stand vp∣right therein. Psal. 73. 3 It is most vncertain & chang∣able and therefore it stands vs vpon to make vs friends thereof while we haue it. Luk. 16. 4 The feare of the losse hereof doth much distract which the right vse therof will much abate and qua∣lifie. Psal. 112. 7. It being therefore apparant that the best may and do abuse prosperity obserue now how we may vse it a right: First, then let vs consider the ends, why the Lorde bestowes these outward blessings in this life vpon his children, which are these 1 To trie whither we wil prefer him before them, and can loue him better then them. Iob. 1. 2 To make vs his stewards in an holy dispensation of them. Mat. 25. 3 To be pledges vnto vs, and fur∣therances of spirituall blessings. Gen. 17. 1. 4 That wee may humbled to giue him the glorie of thē. Ro. 11. 36. And therefore,
1 We must not set our hearts vpon them but keepe them intirely to God. Psal. 62. 2 We must not be puffed vp with them. Psal. 75. 3 Wee must not tie, nor mea∣sure God onely by them. Psalme 30. 6. 4 Wee must bee willing for his sake to part with them either for the good of others or to auoyd our owne hurt. Mat. 10. 37. 5 And all this not as if they were ours, but Gods to dispose wholy to his glory, and the good of his church & children. Matt. 19. 29 13. Colos. 3. 23. Rom. 12. Secondly, because the ouer high conceite of these things is no small occasion to bewitch our hearts with them, therfore let vs labour to rectifie our iudgements concerning prosperity that so our ouerweening opinion thereof may be abated, and our affections rectified therein. To this end. First,Sect. 3. Conside∣rations to this pur∣pose. consider we that though they are Gods blessings, yet they are giuen for the most part to euil men & become
snares & pits vnto them. Ps. 69. and therfore, if there were no other pre∣heminence, euen the wicked in these excell vs. 1. Tim. 6. 2 Acknowledg we that the best haue bin tainted and much defaced by them, & behold we in their ex∣ample what may befal vs, as Solomon and Dauid. 3 That they neither haue bin, nor shall be any certaine inheritance to the best, but haue changed their master according to the good plea∣sure of the giuer. 4 That we deserue not the least of thē, & with al our industry with∣out Gods blessing cannot compasse them, and when we haue them they are but lent vs. 5 That in the iudgement of the best they are but vanity, and breed vexation of spirit; Nay, that indeed they are nothing, yea lesse then no∣thing. Eccles. 1. 2. 1. Cor. 7. 3 Wee must bee carefull in the right dispensation of them. And that in this manner: First, We must principally honor God with our substance. Prouer. 3. And this is done,
1 By acknowledging we haue al of his free mercy. Gen. 32. 2 Willingly consessing from what a low estate the Lord hath raised vs. Gen. 32. 3 By thankefulnes vnto him for the least as well as for the greatest. 1. Tim. 6. 8. Ephes. 5. 20. 4 By faithfulnes in a lower state, that so the Lord may increase vs. Matt. 25. and this is performed: 1 By following our calling, as cō∣tentedly & hūbling our selues therin being increased, as when we began with nothing. De. 8. 11. Phi. 4. 11, 12 2 We must now much more be open handed, and that especially to the houshold of faith. 2. Cor. 9. Gal. 6. 10. 3 We must not thinke it enough to comfort the body, but wee must also minister to the soule, which few rich men make cōscience of, neither indeed are able to performe. Ge. 18 2 We must honour our selues in God with thē, by eating the labours of our hands. Psa. 128. and that not only for necessity but for ornament also. But yet with these conditions:
1 That we exceede not our cal∣lings. 2 That wee remember Ioseph in trouble. Amos 6. 5. 3 That we be alwaies fitted to spirituall duties. Luke 21. 34. 4 And readie to be abased as we haue abounded. Phil. 4. 11. The triall of the right vse of our prosperity is: 1 That our heauenly thirst goes forward with our earthly,Sect. 4. To know when we haue vsed prosperity aright. and ex∣ceeds it. 1. Tim. 6. Mat. 6. 33. 2 That these outward things weane vs from the loue of the world 1. Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31. 3 That we are prepared to suffer afflictions. Luke 9. 23. 4 That though wee giue these things their due, yet wee account them al as dung in respect of Christ. Phil. 3. 8. 5 That we make them our ser∣uants to our Christian callings. Luke 16. 19. Helpes hereunto are: 1 To consider,Sect. 5. Helpes hereto. we are but stran∣gers and pilgrims in this life, and therefore had neede to goe lightlie
on our iourney. 1. Pet. 2. 11. 2 We are but tenants at will. 1. Tim. 6. 17. 4 Stewards for other. Luke 16. 4 Must giue vp a large account at the day of Christ Iesus. Luke 12. 48 CHAP. XXV. AND this is the next occasion daily occurring euen to vse aduersity a right.Of aduer∣sity and the right vse therof. A direction very needfull. 1 Because the deerest children of God haue failed herein.Sect. 1. How ne∣cessary. Psalme 73. 2 Wee profit in nothing more then in an holy vse of afflictions. Psal. 119. 71. 3 God sheweth himselfe in no occasion so marueilous as in this. Psal. 107. 4 Satan hopes in nothing to trip vs as herein. Iob 1. 5 The world hath no more effe∣ctuall meanes to condemne the ge∣neration of the iust, then by their troubles. Iob 8. Acts 28. 4.
That we may therefore vse aduersity aright: First, Learne we to informe our iudge∣ments concerning the same,Sect. 2. How to be vsed well. as 1 Concerning the causes: 1 That they come not by chance but are appointed of God and sea∣led vpon vs. Iob 33. 15. Amos. 3. 2 That they are imposed in loue and of very faithfulnesse. Psal. 119. 3 That there is some cause of them in vs, though presently not knowne to vs. And these causes may be, 1 Either chastisement for some sinne past, or present. 2. Sam. 21. 1. 2 Preuention of some sinne wherein wee are like to fall: as se∣curitie, pride, &c. 2. Cor. 12. 3 Triall and exercise of some graces of God in vs. 1. Pet. 1. 7. 4 Conuincing the world of stan∣derous imputations, as that we serue God for these things. Iob 1. &c. 5 To draw vs neerer to God, and cause vs to haue experience of his power and goodnes. Ioh. 11. 6 Recouery of some graces which by prosperity haue beene decayed

Cor. 11. 30. 31. 8 To weane vs from the loue of this life, and cause vs to long and sigh for our deliuerance. Apoca. 6. 10. Apoca. 22. 20. Secondly, That wee may vse af∣flictions rightly, we must bee alwaies prepared to them. 1. Pet. 4. 12. and that 1 By submiting our wils simply in al things to the prouidence of our gracious father. Mat. 26. 39. 2 By considering that wee were predestinated and ordained vnto them. Rom. 8. 22. 3 Wee must in the purpose of our hearts make choice of this or∣dinance. Mat. 7. and be readie to vndergoe it. Heb. 11. 25. 4 That this is the narrow way and strait gate that leads to hea∣uen. Act. 14. 5 That all the saints of God haue traced this way before vs. Heb. 12. 1 6 That this yoake is easie and the burthen passing light, as hauing the sting thereof taken
a way by Iesus Christ and yet that he beares the burthen now with vs. Esay. 53. and indeed wholy takes it vpon him. Mat. 10. 7 That these trobles are enemies to the flesh, and therefore the ra∣ther to be vndergone to subdue so treacherous an enemy. 2. Cor. 12. 8 By Imposing voluntarie trou∣bles vpon our selues that so we may better digest such as God, shall necessarie inflict vpon vs. 1. Cor. 9. 27. And these are, 9 Let vs enter into the house of mourning, and obserue the chastise∣ments of the Lord vpon others, la∣boring to stirre vp our bowels to∣wards them, and to weepe with them that weepe. Rom. 12. 10 At no hand presume we of our strenght before the time, but feare wee our selues, and cast wee our selues wholy on God. Mat. 16. 33. 11 Discerne we wisely our fitnes for trobles & auoyd we al vnneces∣sary and vnseasonable afflictions. Ioh. 18. 8. Mat. 10. 23. 2. Cor. 11. 33. 12 Iudge we wisely of the trou∣bles of others and take heed we ad
affliction to their affliction. Ps. 41. 13 Meditate we often of the for∣mer ends and benefits of troubles which are manifold. Psal. 119. 67. 14 Vse we an holy moderation in the time of our prosperity in our diet, apparell liberty. &c. 1. Pet. 5. 8. 15 Mainetaine wee especially tenderns of conscience & soundnes of heart by daily examination, and iudging our selues, so shall we be fit for any affliction. Cor. 1. 12. 16 If our estate seem to diminish outwardly let vs be contented with it, & so shal we by degrees be prepa∣red to further emptying 2. Cor. 4. 16. 17 Consider wee that we haue our captaine Iesus Christ to be our cōpanion in all troubles. 1. Pet. 4. 13 18 And that we haue the strength of the holy Ghost to lead vs throw them. Phil. 4. 13. 19 And be we assured of the protection of Angels to defend vs in the same. Psal. 34. 20 And let vs be thinking, of the shortnes of life, & so of troubles, and preparing to death & so no afflictiōs shal be vnwelcome to vs. Phil. 1. 20.
21 Forget we not to meditate of∣tē on the ioyes of heauē, that so whē afflictiōs cōe we may be encoura∣ged the rather to vndergoe them in respect of the inestimable reward which is set before vs. 2. Co. 4. 16. 17. And thus shall we be happily prepared to afflictions & so make a comfortable vse of them when they are vpon vs. To this end consider further: 1 Not what God hath laid vpon vs,Sect. 3. Helpes hereto. but what we haue deserued. Rō. 6. 23. Dā. 9. 7. Ps. 119. 75. Ps. 103. 9. 10. 2 How long God heretofore hath spared vs, & in how many corrup∣tions he hath in great patiēce waited vpō vs, though now he meet with vs. 3 That we are not swallowed vp of the crosse, which is an euiden note of Gods hand put vnder, and that the Lord laies no more vpon vs then we are able to endure. Psalm. 37. 1. Cor. 10. 13. 4 View wee the impatience of Gods children vnder the crosse, to preuent, or remedie the like in vs. Iob. 3. Ionah 4. 5 Meditate we on Gods promises, and so quiet our hearts. Ps. 46. 56. 6 Call we to mind former deliue∣rances
& so we shal strengthen our faith for the present & to cōe. Ps. 77. 7 Take we heede of iudging our case singular, as if neuer any were so much afflicted as we are. Lam. 1. 12 8 Be we diligent in following our callings to auoyd distraction, & preuent worse afflictions. 9 Pray we for our enemies & the rods of our correction. Mat. 5: 44▪ 10 Be we earnest with God rather to sanctifie then to remooue the crosse. Phil. 1. 19. 11 And yet presse the remouall, as may stand with his glorie, our owne and the good of the Church. 12 Yet with wisdome & patience, neither tying the Lord to the time, nor manner, nor measure of the de∣liuerance, but for the temporal cha∣stisement, yelding absolutely vnto God. 2. Sam. 15. 13 Be we thankful vnto God for thē & reioyce we vnder the crosse. 14. If we bee buffeted vnder the crosse with impatiency, or such like tētations: let it cōfort vs, that feeling these corruptions, and acknowled∣ging, yea striuing against them, it is a certaine token of a future victory.
15 Consider we the euils that are prepared for sinners, that so we may the better endure light afflictions 2. Thess. 1. 16 Forget we not to compare the present profit in troubles with the sensible losse, that sin is hereby lessened, and the matter of sinne weakened. 2. Cor. 4. 17 Liue we especially by faith and not by sense, beleeuing the things we see not, and hoping the things that are desperate. 2. Corint. 1. Heb. 11. 18 That Gods power is more seene in the issues out of trouble, then in keeping vs out of them alto∣gether, and therefore this serueth to the magnifiing of Gods power. Ps. 98. 1. 19 Heereby Satan also is most confounded, that whereby he la∣bours most to ouerthrow the Church, and Gods children, they are by the same confirmed and pro∣fited Phil. 1. 12. 20 Promise we to further others in the waies of God. Psal. 51. 21 Vow we the praises of God
in the great congregations. Psal. 35. &c. 22 Moue we the Lord from the insolency of our enemies. Psa. 119. 126. Psal. 41. 23 As also by testifying our zeale to his glory, that it may not be blas∣phemed of the wicked. 24 Labor we especially to com∣fort our hearts with the testimony of our innocency, & that good cause for which we suffer. 1. Sam. 24. 12. 25 Yet acknowledge we before God that we are not cleare, and so abhorre we ourselues in sackcloth and ashes. Iob 11. 26 If we suffer as euill doers, yet remember wee that the crosse is not so much sent as a punishment for sinne, as a remedie against it. Psa. 119. 77. 27. Moue we the Lord from the sense of our owne weakenes. Iob 6. and vtter inability as of our selues. Psal. 6. 28 Protest we our faith in God. Iob 13. 15. and patience in waiting vpon him. Psal. 123. 2.

THus behauing our selues in troubles we shall vndoubtedly find a good is∣sue in them:Of Family exercises. heereunto will further much such spirituall exercises as are incedent to the day. And these are: First, to humble our selues often in the day before God in priuate prayer. Daniel 6. 10. Secondly, to exercise with our fa∣milie prayer, catechizing, reading of the word, & singing of spiritual himnes. Genes. 18. Col. 3. 2. Tim. 3. And this must daily be performed▪ because, 1 We are most ignorant and for∣getfull. 2. Pet. 1. 13. 15. 2 New tentations doe daily as∣sault, vs which by these meanes ar to be resisted.

ANd this is the last duety daily to bee performed of vs, Euen to take an ac∣count of our daily actions. And that: 1 Because hereby we approoue and much confirme the same. 2 Wee purge our hearts of all dregges and remainders of sinne.Why to be perfor∣med. 3 We haue experience of the ex∣cellēcie & certainty of a christiā life 4 We make our account readie against the day of the Lord Iesus.
5 We procure stability and constancy for the time to come. 6 We yoake and diminish our daily tentations. 7 We keepe sinne from sleeping, with vs. 8 By repentance remouing it, our sleepe becomes more sweete and comfortable. 9 Our labours afterward proue¦lesse irksome. 10 We walke with God and ex∣presse the true pilgrimes life. Now that we may the rather performe this duetie. Consider we, 1 That the very heathen in some sort by the light of Nature practis∣ed it. 2 That if trouble here be, it is to the flesh, to which wee are not debtors. Rom. 8. 12. 3 That it is no more then God commands and christianity re∣quites at our hands. 4 That when we haue done all we can, wee are but vnprofitable seruants, and therefore we had need striue to the vtmost.
And for our better direction herein, learne we, First, that the fittest time for per∣formance hereof is after prayer. Secondly, For the manner here∣of beginne we, 1 From the cogitations of the first awaking from sleepe. 2 So proceed we to consider of our morning actions, how we haue confered with our God in priuate, how sanctified our families. 3 Examine such occasions as haue befell vs in our callings. 4 What vse wee haue made of company, what of our being alone: how wee haue receiued and vsed Gods creatures, and haue bin knit vnto God by them. 5 How we haue beene buffited by Satan, the world, &c. 6 What comfort we haue found in the word & spirituall exercises. 7 If thou shalt find the testimony of a good conscience and peace, so reioyce and praise thy God. If thou findest thy failings, so be hum∣bled and cast thy selfe vpon Iesus Christ, in Prayer.
2 Recounting vnto God, as neere as thou mayest thy particular slips, and so acknowledging thy selfe an vnprofitable seruant, seeke thy peace in the merits of thy Sauiour, and so lie downe in his bosome, and so thou shalt find rest for thy soule. Thus farre of the daily Sacrifice. The Lord enable vs to the oblation ther∣of, for his Sonne Christ Iesus his sake, our most full and sufficient sae∣crifice. A∣men. FINIS.
