THE Trappand Cuckold-maker. OR, Yea-and-Nay well fitted. A Baker went with full intent, a Beauty to adore; Thus Yea and Nay, did run astray, But he'll do so no more. Tune is, O Mother Roger, &c. This may be Printed, R. P. THere was of late a Cuckold-maker, if you will believe the truth; Yea and nay, he was a Quaker, yet he us'd the tricks of youth. On a day it chanced so. He would to his Neighbour go, When her Husband want within, This discourse he did begin, Saying, if thou wilt me obey, I'le tender thee by yea and nay. Love let me have my Hearts desire, wherefore shouldst thou say me nay; Beauty sets my Heart on fire, little Lambs thou knowst will play: Since I have my love reveal'd, Prithee dearest do but yield, I will be a constant friend, When I cannot come I'le send, Thee many presents, day by day, And love thee too by yea and nay. The Woman then with modest blushes, in a passion she revil'd; But the Quaker often Hushes, her, to be mor kind and mild: Thus he whisprs n her Ear, Tush, said he, thou needst not fear, Any manner of disgrace, We may freely here embrace: Then prithee make no more delay, I love thee well by yea and nay. Thus he endeavour'd to delude her, but she answer'd him, and said, Never was a Man more ruder, yet I will not be betray'd To your humours, no not I, Therefore make no more reply, Then he catch'd her in his arms, Saying, those alluring charms, My heart and senses does betray, I love thee well by yea and nay. She found he would not be contented, no denyal would he take, Therefore she a Trick invented, and to him she thus did speak; If I do commit this Crime, It must be some other time, Come to me too morrow night, Thou shalt have thy Hearts delight; I will be sure, he then did say To come, my dear, by yea and nay He thought she had the truth related, seeing she had told him when; Therefore home he went and waited, thinking every hour ten, To her Husband she did tell, E'ry thing that had befell; Now when she had this declar'd, For his coming they prepar'd. As you shall hear: then listen pray, They were too hard for yea and nay. Now when the hour was expir'd, to her Chamber then he came, To enjoy what he desir'd, of this fair and comely Dame, When he was come in the room, Presently he did presume To embrace the Beauty fair, Thinking no one had been there, Her Husband rushing in straightway, Alas! this daunted yea and nay. The good man vow'd he would not take it she had left him in the lurch, Yea and nay was almost naked, when with two stout rods of Birch. He did lash both Leggs and Hips, Round the room he ips and skips, With his sad and mournful Cryes, Tears they trickle from his Eyes. O pardon me good Sir, I pray, I'le come no more by yea and nay. O why shouldst thou thy Heart so harden: let some pitty now be found, Giving me thy gracious pardon, here I'le give thee thirty pound; Tho I once have done amiss, Do not tell the World of this: If I pardon you therefore, See you tempt my Wife no more. The ready money he did pay, He would not trust poor yea and nay. FINIS. Printed for I. Deacon, at the Angel in Guilt-spur-Street.
