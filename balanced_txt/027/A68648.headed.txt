AN ADVICE. TOVCHING The Currancie in payment of our English Gold. AS ALSO, A Table of the seuerall Worths of all Pieces vncurrant through want of weight, at his Majesties Exchanges at London. Calculated according to the Number of Graines wanting. Most Necessarie for all. That the true Value of the vncur∣rant Coyne may bee knowne. LONDON. Printed by B. A. and T. F. for Ben. Fisher, and are to bee sold at his Shop at the signe of the Talbot without Aldersgate.
To the Reader. THere hauing beene much doubt made (occasioning much difficultie, de∣lay, and differences in payments of Money) whether the vn-euen pieces of Gold, viz.
XXII. Shillings pieces, &c. were Currant with such Allowances of Graines, as heretofore, before the last Procla∣mation. To cleere such scruples; and declare the seuerall worths of all vncurrant Coyne ex∣ceeding the Remedies. To the end. All may know, what such light∣ned Pieces will truely make: whereby they may bee much eased.
I haue Calculated the prises of the same, and what it will make at his Maiesties Exchanges; for the ease and direction of All men, that haue oc∣casion to deliuer or receiue the same.
THE ADVICE. WHEREAS, By his late Majesties Proclamati∣on made for suppressing of light Gold, amongst other things and reasons therof (therin more large∣ly expressed) it is Contay∣ned in these words. viz.
AND therefore, Wee doe hereby straightly Charge and forbid, vpon pain of Contempt & incurring our High displeasure; That no person or persons, from and after Midsomer next comming, in any Countie of our Realme, doe presume to take, receiue, or deliuer in payment, any Piece of our Gold Coyne (and formerly by vs aduanced) at the rates aforesaid, beeing clipped, washed, or any other way vnlawfully diminished, or lacking of his just weight ther∣of, otherwise, then according
to the Rates hereafter seueral∣ly expressed. And with the Allowance formerly set down in our former Proclamation. That is to say: 1. In euery Piece Currant for Thirtie-three-shillings, the Remedie shall not exceed, Foure Graines and a halfe. 2. Twentie-two-shilling Pieces, shall not exceed, Three Graines. 3. Sixteene-shillings Six-pence Pie∣ces, shall not exceed, Two Graines and a halfe.
4. Eleuen-shillings Pieces, shall not exceed, Two Graines and a halfe. 5. Fiue-shilling Six-pence Pie∣ces, shall not exceed, T Graines. 6. Two shillings Nine-pence Pie∣ces, shall not exceed, Halfe a Graine. All which Remedies shall bee allowed in euery Piece ac∣cordingly, and no deduction or abatement to bee made for the same, but to passe as if it were of full weight and just
value. But if any such piece of Coyne lacking of his weight aboue the said Reme∣dies, shall from and after Mid∣sommer next comming, bee of∣fered in payment by any per∣son or persons within this our Realme; Our will and plea∣sure then is, That for so ma∣ny Graines more or lesse as the Piece shall bee lighter then the Remedies so as aforesaid al∣lowed. Euery person or per∣sons, that so offereth the same in payment, shall also, at the same time pay and allow; af∣ter the rate of Two-pence the Graine to him that receiueth
it, for euery Graine wanting aboue the Remedies respe∣ctiuely: AND euery Per∣son or persons, vnto whom the same is offered to bee pay∣ed, with these allowances, shall accept the same in payment, as if the same were full and just weight, any thing Contay∣ned in our former Proclama∣tion to the contrary notwith∣standing. PROVIDED alwayes, That if any such Piece of Gold so offered in payment, after the time aforesaid, shall want a∣boue the number of so many more Graines then are allowed
for the Remedies respectiuely▪ (As if the Piece of Twentie and two shillings, shall want more then three Graines aboue the Remedie allowed, or the piece of Eleuen-shillings, more then two Graines aboue the Reme∣die. And so of all the rest re∣spectiuely.) Then our will and pleasure is, that in all payments betwixt partie and partie, the same shall not onely be refu∣sed without all redemption, but that euery person or persons, to whom such tender of pay∣ments bee made, shall brand the same, by striking a hole in euery of the said Pieces so of∣fered
in payment as likewise of any other Peice as shall bee found Sowdered or vnlawful∣ly Imbased: Rendring those Peices so stricken thorough then presently after to the owners, according as was or∣dered by a Proclamation made by our deare Sister and late Queene ELIZABETH, in the Nine and twentieth yeere of her Raigne vpon like occasion. Giuen, &c.
By this Proclamation it is cleere; That euery Piece not wanting in weight aboue the Remedies declared in the said Proclamation, viz. Euery Piece of— Shil. Pence. Graines. XXXIII. s. Not wanting aboue- 9. Grai. XXII. s. 6 Grai. XVI. s. vj. d. 5. Grai. XI. s. 4. Grai. V. s. vj. d. 4. Grai. II. s. ix. d. 1. Grai. Is Currant, and then was and ought to bee accepted in
payment with abatement of Two-pence a Graine, for euery graine exceeding the Remedie allowed. Now there is no alteration made concerning these Pie∣ces, by the last Proclamati∣on, but they doe & remaine in the same state and de∣gree, (Money payable vpon the same allowance or deducti∣on of Graines,) as they were before the same. The words of which last Pro∣clamation for so much as concerns the Currancie of Coyne being, as followeth:
ITEM, to the end to a∣voyd and put to our Coyne all Gold money currant within this our Realme, being clipped, washed, or by any o∣ther meanes vnlawfully di∣minished, or lacking of the iust weight thereof, other∣wise then according to the rates hereafter seuerally expres∣sed, And with the allow∣ance of the Remedies set downe in diuers former Pro∣clamations of Queene ELI∣ZABETH, and of our late Father of blessed memorie. That is to say:
1. In euery Piece Currant for Thirtie Shillings, the Reme∣die and abatement, shall not exceed, Foure Graines and a halfe. 2. The Twentie shilling Pieces, shall not exceede, Three Graines. 3. The Fifteene-shillings Piece, shall not exceed, Two graines and a halfe. 4. The Tenne-shillings Piece, shall not exceede, Two Graines.
5. The Fiue-shillings piece, shall not exceed, One Graine. 6. The Two-shillings Six-pence piece, the Remedie and a∣batement shall not exceed, Halfe a Graine. All which Remedies shall be allowed in euery Piece ac∣cordingly, the same wanting no more, being to passe as if it were of full weight and just value. But if any such piece of Coyne shall lacke of the true weight thereof, aboue the Remedies before expressed. Then wee doe straightly Charge and
Command, That no person or persons whatsoeuer, shall acept or offer them in pay∣ment, vpon any allowance or defatuation for want of weight whatsoeuer, but that the same be and stand denied downe, and vncurrant. And that it shall be lawfull for any person or persons whatsoe∣uer, when offer of payment of any the said pieces lightned as aforesaid shall be made to brand the same by striking a hole in euery of them said pieces so offered in payment, rendring the pieces so bran∣ded, then presently after to
the owners thereof againe. Which said Lightned or Bran∣ded Pieces, Our pleasure is, shall bee brought or Carried to our Exchanges or Mint, there againe to bee molten and con∣uerted into Coyne.
This last Proclamation, ex∣presly and by plaine termes, Extends vnto, and Com∣prehends only such Pieces, which at the time of the said Proclamation were Currant, for, and at the rates expressed in the same, viz. At XXX. shillings, XX. shillings, XV. shillings, X. shillings, V▪ shillings, and II. shillings, vj. pence. And therefore, for as much as all vn-euen Pieces of Iaco∣bus, halfe Quarters, and Eights, were at the time of the said last Proclamation Currant for other values,
viz. For XXXIII. shil∣lings, XXII. shillings. XVI. shillings vj. pence, XI. shillings, V. shillings vj. pence, and II. shillings ix. pence. It is most cleere, That the same Pieces are not at all comprehended, or altered by the said last Proclamation; but doe and are now currant and payable vpon the same al∣lowances and deductions for want of weight, as they were before the pub∣lishing of the same. And the rather, For that there were then pieces Currant
for the values mentioned in the last Proclamation whereof the same did dis∣pose, leauing the others to bee in such degree and state as they were: As also for that, The prin∣cipall intention might bee to preserue vpright his Ma∣jesties, euen Coynes (whereof great Quantities haue bin Coyned) being yet in good state; without much regard being had to the other, forasmuch as no more of the said vneuen Coynes are purposed to bee Coyned.
AND therefore, the Ten∣der of such Pieces, vp∣on allowance and de∣duction for want of weight agreeable to the former Pro∣clamation, is good and not confronted by the latter? But ought to bee accepted of vpon all payments of bonds, bills of Exchange, and con∣tracts, and duties, whatso∣euer and wheresoeuer; The partie refusing such pay∣ments not onely endamaging himselfe by the delay: but incurring the paine of the for∣mer Proclamation, by refu∣sall
of such monyes, as his Maiestie makes Currant by his Proclamation. And this agreeth with the generall Opinion of Lawyers, And the most vsuall practise of all men.
