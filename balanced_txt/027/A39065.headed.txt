AN EXPEDIENT OR A sure & easy way of Reducing all Dissenters whatsoever to an exact & sincere Obedience both to our Ecclesiastical & Civil Government. AMong all the great nations that have been, no man I believe can show me the example of England, which being not only still intire under the Rule of its lawful Governour, but also a great deal stronger in it self, by the happy con∣junction of Scotland (its former dangerous enemy] should nevertheless since the Reformation be de facto much weaker, and consequently less considerable to our Neighbours. All English men, of what persuasion or interest soever, unanimously conclude that our differences in Religion are the cause; & therefore as some of every Opinion have proposed their Expedients for the cure of this misfortune, so I hope I may take the same Liberty, & throw in my mite also, being induc'd thereunto by the affection I bear my Coun∣trey, which I suppose moved the rest, that have already written: and though I am born a Member of the Church of England, whose Liturgy & Rites are so worthy of admiration, yet I shall do what I can (as far as 'tis lawful) to bridle in my Zeal, least seeming too partial, I should rather harden than mollifie our dissenting Brethren; who happen (which is the misery of it) to be too numerous & considerable in this poor distracted Nation. We all know that the whole Kingdom as to Divine Worship is divi∣ded (besides its subdivisions) into these four great Parties, viz. Church of England men, Presbyterians, Independants & Papists; the three last of which we call Nonconformists, as contrary to the present Religion esta∣blish'd. Our Church of England is more numerous than any, & has persons in it of all ranks & conditions; but it seems not so full of Zeal as the others, because it abounds with men that are too much in love with hu∣mane Interest, or have no Religion at all; for these ever flock to that Church which is in power; whether true or false. Presbyterians have generally on their side the Corporations, & all formal men, which they are pleas'd to call the sober part of the Nation.
but as they are rich, so they lye more open to be harass'd, whensoever the black day of tribulation happen's. The Independants of Phanatiques consist only in Artizans, & the mean∣est of the Land, & yet are in two things very considerable; as first, let the Government do what it will with them they cannot be much poorer, so that in three months they will recover, & be as they were; In the next place, Their caf & trades are of great concernment to us. Of Papists there are seven parts of ten Gentlemen; & people of great quality, & therefore they fancy that their Religion is probably the truest, because it has been profess'd here all along by so many men of parts & fashion; & boast that it is only through Ignorance, or want of attention that the whole Nation is not as blind as themselves. As for Persecution they are not much terrified at it, having (as they believe) manfully endur'd it so many years; besides by long practice they know not only all the wayes imaginable to evade the penalties of the Lawes, but also by their birth have Relations in all offices, & employments, that alwayes did, & still do help them when they are in danger to be whipt by us. This then in three words being the interest and state of each party, we may the easier find out a Remedy for our disorders, which have ruin'd, or at best strangely shatter'd one of the most flourishing Kingdomes in the world. Ever since the happy Restauration of his Majesty, there has been still a great cry in all quarters for Liberty of Conscience, to which I have been greatly inclind, not only out of compassion to well meaning deluded souls, but out of conviction also that it would totally root out all Sects, & erronious Opinions from among us: & seeing we have found by ex∣perience that severity has neither destroy'd Popery, which is so ridiculous to every body but its Professours: nor yet prevented a troublesome broo'd of our own, I say considering this, we ought to try what mild∣nesse will effect, since all wise men alter those projects which they find deficient: at least we may make tryal of it for a while, as our matchlesse Parliaments do, that enact often Laws to continue but for so long, to be the better able to see whether they may reap the proposed advantage by them; Nor can this tryal be any wayes prejudicial to us, if it en∣danger neither the souls of men, nor cause a disturbance in the Civil Government. 'Tis impossible, (according to the profession of all our most learned Protestants) to hazard our Salvation by Opinions whilst we agree in that maine Fundamental, to wit, The satisfaction of our Saviour Jesus Christ; for
otherwise we must shipwrack our selves, whether we will or no, on the unavoidable rocks of Popery; because if there should yet be any thing more, which we are necessarily to believe, an infallible interpreter, and Magisterial Iudge to guide the ignorant & unlearned would consequent∣ly follow; Magisterial I say, because a poor simple man must implicitely believe, as not being ever able to comprehend or understand some truths; & infallible, least men might be still doubting whether yet they are in the right or no. No marvel then that Mr. Chillingworth (the miracle of his age) sticks close to this, thinking it very strange a man should be damn'd for noti∣ons which he cannot comprehend; & therefore lays down Repentance from dead work, and a belief in the coming & merits of Christ, as the only Fundamental amongst Christians, & as a thing adequate to every ordina∣ry capacity. The Papists who would fain come near our truths, are also nibbling here though they handle it another way; for they will have it too, That all men are damn'd through their own wilfulness in resisting evident things, & say, Though Christ as a Prophet sent from God may be easily concei∣ved by humane Reason, yet an infallible Church to govern his flock is easier comprehended and easier demonstrated to a Christian, than his being sent can be proved to an Ifidel, & so forsooth this infallible Church by its definitions, and explications makes the hardest mysteries as easie as the plainest. I here set down this pretty Doctrine dress'd after the Roman fashion, to show, that if a Protestant should not ground damnation on our wil∣fulness in rejecting things within the reach of our capacity, the very Papists themselves will rise up in judgement against him at the last day, to his utter confusion and shame. This moderation the eminent Doctor Taylor himself highly esteem'd, & this he so stoutly maintain'd in his book of Liberty of Prophecying, that to this day it remains unanswer'd. Many enemies I know he created to himself by his reconciling zeal, & though by their cry he passes at present for a better practical than controversial Divine, yet he has (as all men acknowledge made it evidently appear inconsistent with Protestant charity to damn any of our poor Dissenters for their tenets. For first, can any godly Protestant thinke a Presbiterian a limme of Sa∣tan for refusing to conform to habits & ceremonies, which every body confesses were neither comanded by Christ, nor his Apostles: or shall he be reprobated for railing against stage playes though the drift of the best of them is to abuse the Brethren? Nor can the disowning of Episcopacy be damnable, unless we submit our selves to Tradition, and Ecclesiastical authority, for the Scripture has many seeming arguments for
that opinion. Predestination, & the manner of Christs descent into Hell are points disputable among all Christians, & God forbid we should think that every error in judgement will deprive us of all happinesse hereafter. The Independants or Phanatiques, owe their being to the foregoing Sect, & if they wildly fancy a barn as good as a Church, or a Graduate, not so learned as a Cobler; with other odd extravigancies (the half of which no one man can recount) let us not be more rigorous than the Pope, who only lookt upon them that came to Rome to convert him as mad; & I think neither S. Peter, nor his pretended Successors have lockt Bedlams out of Heaven. Nor shall I damn Papists for matters of Faith, whilst they believe the Trinity, & can patch up their other Doctrines, so as not really to intend thereby the dishonour of our great Lord & Master. For (as I said before) God forbid every errour in judgment should be a sin to death. They fancy many promises in Scripture, That the Church shall never erre. That it is to be visible in prosperity & adversity as a Iudge in all disputes that arise, & laugh at Protestants for affirming that the Scriptures are easie seeing all Sects among us quote Scripture for what they hold, & yet one is often quite opposite to the tenets of the other in things of the highest nature. They preach up merits (they say) to encourage men to work; but tell us expresly (when we urge to them the foulness of the tenet) That neither their own actions, nor the actions of any Saint can be in them∣selves sufficient to bring them to heaven, did not God promise to accept them as meritorious, and sufficient by the superaboundant merits of Christ. They honour Saints (they say) only because they were faithfull ser∣vants of Christ, and believe, That these holy Spirits, must needs know our wants by their rejoycing in heaven at our conversion, & That their prayers for us are much more powerful with God, than those of our friends here below, which we all often implore: yet they oblige none (as they pretend) to pray to Saints except they will. They think because some sins (viz. those against the Holy Ghost) shall not be forgiven in this world nor in the world to come, that other sins may some times be forgiven in the world to come. And therefore pray for the dead (that have built upon hay stubble & other imperfect things) whom S. Paul to the Corinthians declares (they say) shall be saved so as by fire. & they more firmly also believe this Purgatory because, the Maccabees (that fought for the maintenance of God's law) pray'd for their slain Brethren;
which they often urge is recorded by an unquenchable Historian, if not by a Divine Writer: As to their Idolatry in the Sacrament, they say, That by believing Christ really there 't is him they worship, & not a piece of bread. That the thing is no lesse possible according to humane reason than the Trinity: That the words, THIS IS MY BODY are as plain, as THERE ARE THREE THAT BEAR RECORD IN HEAVEN; & That it is much for their advantage, that all sects of Christians in the world grant the Real Presence, except a few Calvinists as they call them. By that text of Scripture, Confesse your sins one to another. They think their Confession enjoyn'd; and that Christs commission to his Disciples to bind & to loose authorizes their Priests Absolutions and Interdictions. And before many of their books of Pilgrimages, Reliques, Pictures, & the like (to show their worship is relative) they print this piece of Saint Jerom's Epistle against Vigilantius. We honour the Reliques of Martyrs, to render adoration to him for the love of whom they were Martyrs, we honour the servants, that what we do for their service may be refer'd to their Master, who says, He that receives you receives me. I should never have done, were I to set down all their opinions, & Jesuiticall glosses, but this I may say for them, that they have much lesse to answer, since they really think themselves in the right, & are so united in their Fundamentalls, whilst the poor Protestants (to the great shame & weakening of the common cause) quarrell irreconcileably about nicetyes, & then divide & subdivide without end. Far be it therefore from us to damne these Papists though ignorant, especially seeing, we must do the like then to the Lutherns, who are not only Protestants but the first Reformers also: for their Churches are cram'd with Crucifixes, & Pictures; and which is more, they as really be∣lieve Christ in the Sacrament, as the Pope himself; the main point in which he & his brood commit Idolatry, as the Church of England and the other best reform'd Churches hold. Let not therefore our passion shut up heaven against any to whom our Savour has open'd it; & since Protestants themselves do so disagree (as sometimes each man in a family is of a different Church) let us be the more charitable in our censures, according to the healing advice of many a painful Divine; and thus may the Papists be baffled with their own di∣stinction, viz; That they differ in school points only, & not in fundamentalls. But here I desire not to be misunderstood, for I hold many other Doc∣trines extremely advantageous to poor souls, and heartily wish all men of my opinion, but nothing but time and new methods can unite us without the utter ruine of the Nation.
Having thus like a good Protestant prov'd, That Indulgence to dissenters though (they should encrease by it, as some vainly fancy) cannot hinder their salvation, because all that do well may be saved; I will now come to the civil Government, & show you that it will be so far from causing disturbances, or endangering the true Religion that in ten years there shall not be a dissenter left to piss against the wall; & this I hope (if practicable) must satisfy even those, that limite God's mercy, especially since they know how firmly sects are already rooted here, & could never be extir∣pated by the severity of our Laws. I have often laugh'd to hear persons of each Sect among us pretend that their Religion teaches nothing but obedience to Magistrates, whilst all others foment Rebellion. Now for my part I would absolutely trust no Religion in the world with the full power of deposing Princes, no more than I would have an Infidel trust his wife in bed with me because I am a Christian. 'Tis most certain that the true religion of Christ, comands as well and exact obedience to our Rulers, as that we should not commit adultery; but yet whilst men are men, many of the Professors of this truth (what by the force of a partial appetite, & self interreste'd distin∣ctions) when they have oppertunity, often transgress those two pre∣cepts, though as positively command as can be: & therefore some doubt whether all the Primitive Christians would have been so patient under Nero, Domitian, Diocletian, &c. had they had power enough to contend: Nor will I more passe my word that the Grand Segnior should continue Emperour & Mahometan, were the sword wholly in the hands of his Christian subjects, than that all the members of the Church of England would have submitted to our present Monarch, had he yeilded to the Papists, who were as buisy (they say) as Bees to convert him. All men whatsoever affect to have their Ptince of their Religion, because they fancy it most for the glory of God, but nothing heightens this zeal so much as persecution; for whensoever there is difficulty of obtaining our will, the desire of enjoyment encreases; as we see even in women that often risque life, fortune, honour, & all to enjoy a Gallant, when as if they afterwards marry (& then there will be no need of comming in by the window) 'tis a thousand to one but they presently loath each others conversation, & bed. Besides this natural pronenesse to pursue what is hindred us (for passions often bear sway even in our spiritual actions) self preservation also or the hopes to be quiet puts the brains of dissenters upon propagating their Religion; nor is it a small argument to many of the truth of a new Doctrine, to see men suffer for it. This we have experimentally seen here at home in every party that
now contends with the Church; for what could be more irresistable than Presbytery in the beginning of the late war; & how many men, women, & children, would have willingly ventur'd their lives for the Cause whilst kept under? & yet within three years or thereabouts after it's establish∣ment, 'twas kick'd down even by those who had before set it up with such zeal & hazard. Phanaticisme (as well mankind inlightned with the last spark of reason will acknowledge) has no greater enemy than it self, nor ever did, nor ever can stand, because it wants all principles of settlement; & therefore 'tis we that blow the party into some appearance of unity, in hoping by disturbance to hasten their ruine. As for Popery, let us consider it in Queen Elizabeths time, & we shall find in our Protestant Historians that for the first ten years of her reign no man as a Papist suffered either in his life, or Estate, & yet from a hand∣ful the Reform'd became much more than half the Kingdom: but after that the Government began to enact sanguinary & penal Laws we find that Allen, Philopater, & the rest of their active Writers insisted upon no argument more (to prove the truth of their Religion) than that Protestants of all sorts became daily Papists, but not one in 7. years left them, except some scandalous fellow which was a greater advantage than losse to them. Let us look in the next place on their Jesuiticall Seminaries at Douay & Saint Omers, & you shall find them (as knowing men have assur'd me) much emptier now they can carry popish Children over with little danger, than in the former dayes, when it was done by great bribes, & they often indited for fugitives also. Again if we reflect upon our late Rebellion, it was called by many (as I well remember) the popes harvest, & Halcyon dayes; & yet we know they lost besides others of note, two Marquesses at a clap (I mean the heirs apparent of Winchester, & Worcester) the like of which cannot be paralleld in the greatest severities of the Queen, nor in the violent storme that universally fell after the Powder Treason. Lastly, concerning Proclamations & the like, what man ever found the least good by them? If there be any thing got, the Priests are the gainers: for (every body say's) not one stir's out of England, & 'tis likely also by being in a seeming kind of danger, that they are the more caress'd by their Penitents. Nay if all things were well examin'd, we shall find that the Protestants themselves do ever pitty them in distress, & that there are never more conversions than in the height of these pudders, which 'tis no
wonder if they enter into their Anualls as Persecutions. If punishment then serves only to encrease the number of Sectaries, why should we be so much their friends, and do them courtesies to be rayl'd at for our pains? Courtesies I say, because their Domine or Godly Pastor would otherwise starve, whereas now there's nothing thought too good for him; and the flock then would have also leisure to consider their extravigance, which now the pleasure of being harass'd hinders. No Cavaliers will wonder at my joyning the word pleasure to harassing, since I dare say there are not any of those great and loyal subjects, though they now possesse places suitable to their merits, but had formerly more satisfaction in one poor play by stealth at Haynes's, in one meeting at Doctor Gunning's in danger, or in contriving any half Moon-plot over a pint of sack, than ever they enjoyed (as to their own particular) since the absolute esta∣blishment of his Majesty. This is the nature of fraile man, and if the best and wisest of men cool a little by enjoyment, what must they do that have no other guide but passion. I wish then that our Sectaries had churches allowed them, & all the priviledges of their brith right as they call it; nor am I yet their Advocate, but the Nation's, as hoping to preserve it's Inhabitants & destroy their foolish blind Zeal, which has been so fatal to us. Their Churches or Congregations I would have under penalty pub∣lique & register'd, which hath nothing of particularity in it, seeing all the Churches in the Kingdom are so. By this means his Majesty would know their persons, manners, & Doctrine, which now by their meeting in holes, he is wholly unacquainted with; & if any man then spake in the least against the Government, he should be made an Example with all the severity that could be thought of. I have heard say that in Holland (where no Religion is unwel∣come if any Minister in his sermon, or other spiritual function, meddles with state affairs, the Magistrates send him next day a pair of shoos to carry him forthwith out of the Province; & present∣ly he provides for his march, otherwise he is sure to be hang'd unlamented; nor do they ever touch more than the offender, which proceed's not so much from justice or Compassion, as Prudence; it being certain no penalty can so surely tye up an Incendiary's tongue as (when he suffers) not to be pittied by his Party. For to punish the whole Body (as the English custome is) for the
faults of some members, makes them all desperate, racking many times their brain to defend an action (the then common cause which otherwise they would have disown'd, without difficulty; and besides it is a kind of real martyrdom when a man actually suffers either in his life or estate, for a crime which perchance strictly and truly he bminates. No wonder then, that our Papists not only reckon themselves Martyrs, but are cryd up & esteemd for such by so many Forrain Princes; which must needs draw a scandal upon the Nation, & so do the Protestant Reli∣gion a prejudice both at home and abroad, if these encrease, and gain re∣pue also by their sufferings. I cannot therefore but be highly dissatisfied with our common Justice, which entails Rebellion on a Sect, and insulting too much over the we kness of mankind, necessarily (as it were) inclines from Father to son unprincipled men to all villany and treason. Let us therefore call to mind the Scotch Presbyterian Rebellion in 66 last, and see what a ruine it would have been to England, had his Majesty instead of his own great predence and merciful temper followed their councel who thought it fit to pursue our presbyterians at home, as com∣plotters with those actually in arms, This would have driven all into the utmost despair, especially those that loved the King and Kingdom best; for then they would have deem'd it impossible to satisfie, & consequently thought ill designs the best of their play, nor would they have lookt upon themselves or children otherwise than slaves, since no slavery is equal to that, of being always suspected by the Government. Many that are now faithful, would then have been not only incensed, but perchance have turnd their bibles over and over to find again arguments to main∣tain Rebellion; for what will not men fancy God sayes when tis abso∣lutely necessary for their ends. Were every man that now heartily rejoyces at a Thiefs execution at Tyburn, to suffer with the malefactor, we should not only see theft defen∣ded by its present condemners, but reckond for a virtue also. Some would cry up the life of man for an inestimable jewel, and to be preferred be∣fore all worldy trash Others would term propriety, a tyrannick, & unjust u∣surpation, with the like metaphysical fancies, nay the tricks of a Rascal would be then called the effect of a dextrous wit, & the setting upon two or three unarmed Gasiers, the height of all valour and courage. Theres nothing can ever destroy us in England but disagreement, nor shall the Government ever fail of being thought the common enemy by all Nonconformists, whilst the folly or Knavery of some few is imputed to the whole gang in general. If this way of proceeding were lay'd aside (which now strongly ce∣ments them) their Congregations would quickly be well satisfied with
the condemnation of a guilty Member, as we ordinarily are at what passes at the old Bayly, or at any of our other Sessions. It may be some might strive to mince the matter of fact (as daily friends do in all faults committed) but none would then defend a crime to be no crime, which is the thing I solely insist upon, for from thence arise all our disputes & factions. 'Tis an error to think there can be a great Body of men inconsistent with Government, since to be lawless is as opposite to the nature of man∣kind in general, as death it self. Every sober man therefore (let his Re∣ligion be what it will) find's out some distinction or other to prevent confusion, & to conform to Laws that tend to Government. The Pres∣byterians are too discreet & rich to be anarchica & whosoever has, & loves riches, will be always fond of Laws that preserve his right to them The Phanatiques are generally harmless & well meaning; & though a Quaker will not set out his Tithes, he will bid the Minister or Tithing man take them: nay if he find loss by their carving, he will at length do it himself with this or the like salvo, that 'Tis the old man & not the new that payes the Hireling that Judaical abomination: nor do these poor peo∣ple refuse (it seems) to engage to live peaceably, as their friend Mr. Pen tells us in his Great Case. Now for the Papists, the greatest & most absolute Princes of the World are not only of their profession, but our own King∣dom also was extremely considerable under their Goverment, & our ex∣cellent Laws and prudent old customes were of their framing; as they well know, & also vaunt in their late Apology & Reply. Besides though the Papists of England are still so great Assertors of the Popes power in Spirituals, that I really believe by what I have read & seen that there would more die for him here, then in any two Countreys in the world, yet we know that in the very depth of Popery no body struck more bold & home at all temporal encroachments of the Romish See, than the English, for they not only made strict prohibitions against the coming in of Legates without leave against publication of bulls, and the like; but also enacted those nipping Laws of Mortmain, so that no body could voluntarily & of his own head give one foot of Land to the Church, Nor at this day do I find, (for truly I have made particular enquiry about it) any French man more willing than our present Papists to tye up the Popes hands from medling with the civil Government of the Kingdom. If therefor all or any of these Dissenters be now heaving at the Govern∣ment, 'tis because they are distinguish'd from the rest of the Nation, & made as uncapable of many things as strangers & aliens; nor do's animo∣sity or a rebellious spirit always proceed from the Religion men profess but from the frailty of nature which makes them often partial, & take the dictates of their appetite for truth & reason. Now were no English Chris∣tian (as long as obedient to the lawful power) inconvenienc'd for his Con∣science,
'tis impossible but Sectaries would be as heartily sollicitous for the good of the Nation, as any man else whatsoever. This most evidently appears by the Welsh, who (whilst we suspected & used them with rigor) were ever unquiet, & our most deadly enemies, but after we had recieved them as friends, & made them partakers of all the priviledges of the Kingdom, they not only for got our strange usage of their Princes the loss of their Lands, & the Egyptian slavery they were under but so united themselves with us, that our losses are now theirs, & theirs ours; nor have they since ever stirr'd or made ill use of our favours; but (on the contrary by them, both they and we are become one people, & one nation without the least rancour, or grudge; nay so fond have they been of our Monarchy (which once they hated bove all things) that four parts of five of them were faithful to his late Majesty, whilst such a number of English were up against him. If then gentleness & interest could reconcile long feuds, & make men from mortal foes become the greatest friends why may not we expect by the like method the like success in these our present distractions? Ther's one argument (as 'tis thought) of great weight against this liberty of Conscience, viz. That all dissenters when they were in power would tolerate no Religion but their own, (as the Papists in time past, & the Protestant Sectaries in the late rebellion) & therefore in Iustice they ought now to be served in the same manner. The matter of fact is granted & taken out of their ser∣mons I know, yet nevertheless if persecuting Christians for conscience be in it self against charity, we must not retaliate, & render like for like. but on the other side, if the lawful Magistrate may punish tender consciences when he thinks it for the honor of God, & quiet of the Government, this may perchance a little touch the Presbyterians & Phanaetiques (who were our Ru∣lers by indirect means but then we can never blame any longer the Pa∣pists for what they did, because their Goverment (as to its Jurisdiction) was as lawful as ours, & their plea consequently unanswerable, viz, That they really fancy'd their Religion true, & the Protestant heretical; That they thought it would for ever distract & disquiet the nation to permit new Doctrine; & in short, That they proceeded according to Magna Charta, & other Laws enacted by the legal Authority of the Kingdom. No man can therefore better defend the Marian days, & all Popish severity; than by advising the punishment of Non-conformists, & practising it as we do: But if we would have the Church of Englands great beauty appear, & be the true spouse without spot or wrinkle, we must necessarily refrain from doing those things, which they whom we blame are deem'd guilty of. It is pleasant to ee now a days how Presbyterians, Independants & Pa∣pists, (though really no great friends) begin to claw one another; & who
can blame them for it, or would not think them otherwise fools, since they all lye under the same lash? I remember when Dr. Hewet was to be executed, our Church of England & City Divines joyn'd together (though they hated one another suffici∣ently) to petition Cromwel for him; at which some persons of quality wondring one night at Dr. Duns, Sr. Henry Blunt answerd, that he thought there was nothing extraordinary in that action; for (said he) I have near my house a Common where my pigs, & my neighbours feed, & there I dayly see that they eagerly fight & bite one another at the trough, But if a dog happens to fall upon any one, the rest will presently take the part of the oppress'd with all the zeal and fury imaginable. 'Tis certain both Greek & Trojan will unite when they find it their in∣terest to do it, & what greater interest can any man have; than the good of his Country, if he be capable of participating of all the advantages that accrue. I do not therefore infer that presently a Quaker must be made Master of the Ceremonies, or Revels, but that if he can dance, & put of his hat with as good a grace as another, he should not loose the hopes of these places by reason of his Religion; for though thousands will never emerge but be beggars and Tinkers, should all our Colliers be fraught'd with Gold, yet these very contemptible men would think the Govern∣ment uneasie, and perchance wish its ruine; were they by Act of Parliament never to rise to any higher pith. Were we all of one opinion, no man should be more willing to keep out Sects than my self; for then twould be both feasible and lawful; but since things are come to this height, 'tis now impossible to do it by sverity, for all violent courses wil only exasperate more than half our subj. & cause many to catch at all seditious opportuniies that shall at any time occur. But some men (like Iustice Overce) must be punishing, for otherwise they fancy all Discipline lost; & therefore of such I would fain know, since all Dissners cannot in Prudence be brought to the ring, which of them would they bate had they power? To fall foul o the Presbyterians would be madness, for who would not deem that action so, which must needs provoke a rch, a prudent, & a nu∣mrous Paty to be eternal enemies to the Government, & yet no Protest∣ant can call their errors in Faith, damnable. They once err'd we know, but this may be a means to make their children also faulty; & truly I doubt not but the miseries they at last suffer'd in the late Rebellion, for wealthy mn must smart in such disorders) will cause them to be for the future faithful English men, unless new exasperations pervert both their resolution & reason. Twere pity also, methinks to be always punishing Phanatiques, who ra∣ther want a good Phisitian, & Cephaliques, than the authority of a Constable.
I am sure (as I said before) it makes them more obstinate, as fancying themselves like the primitivs Christians, whilst the Hollanders grow rich by our losses, ffording them that quiet which they find not at home, & thereby become masters of those manufactures which formerly we alone could brag of. Or shall we then vent our fuy against Papists, & make our selves still ridi∣culous to our neighbouring Princes, who receiving odd accounts from their Agents, think us a weak people & easy to be distracted by vain fears & jealousies? Nor can it certainly be for the good or honour of the Na∣tion, to persecute those, who have shewed so much loyalty, that no race of men could ever parallel them unless the true Members of the Church of England; & that which makes me yet more their friend, is that at present (though we have often provokt them) they keep no private caballing with either France, Spain, Pope, Devil, or any thing that is all (for had they done it we should have smelt it out long ago) but on the contrary, they have ever the King in their mouths, as if the Rump were now on foot, and express as much grief at our publiquem fortunes as any other Subj ct in the Nation. I defie all their Priests & Fryers to alter my principles in Religion, yet I do acknowledge their Church to be a Church as our learned Prelates & Di∣vines have taught me; nor can I but decrie those that will damn our great Grand-fathers, & consequently all before them; for I am sure every body then were Papists with a vengeance, unlesse sometimes two or three foo∣lish Lollards started up, who were far liker the Disciples of Fox & Naylor, than Members of the true Protestant Religion. Away then with persecuting Christians purely for Conscience, which is the only hadvest for Knave, & of this here at home we have two most wo∣ful examples; For neither had the Head of our long Rebellion been so power∣fully assisted at first, could their zealous abettors have been assured of their Religion, Nor was it ever possible for Cromwel to have raisd himself to that pitch he was in, but by laying hold on the tender Consciences of men, who despairing of favour from a lawfuler Government, became at last bands to his ambition, & then shar'd with him in that rich & plentyful booty, Away I say, with this persecution, the chief cause also of so must Atheisme amongstus; for men who want courage to suffer, by sinning often against their Consciences, become hardned in time, & in stead of ever really appro∣ving the Religion impos'd think every thing at last a meer cheat, & so from harmless people erronius it may be at first in points of small con∣cernment) grow fixt by degree in all infidelity & prophanenesse; nor has any one thing been more destruct ve to our G vernment than so many Oaths, for most that were truly ill men never scrupled the taking of them when as Dissentrs that stood on Principles have always refus'd them & oftenti∣mes
smartly suffer'd for it. Thus the best fall only within reach of the laws whilst the most factious & dangerous (against whom those very laws were intended) escape their deserved punishment. I profess to the whole world I have no inclination to the Religion of our Sectaries, but their persons; who being so numerous can never be misus'd without an unspeakable inconvenience to us all, & though I have been a Cavalier (I thank God) ever since the name came up (& to this day dote upon any thing that truly was of the party) yet I have laid aside all ani∣mosity against our old enemies, because I am sure it is for the interest now of that Prince whose Rights we all heretofore so eagerly asserted. As Rebels against the State must be pardon'd whensoever they are many, even so we must do with Dissenters in Religion, for though the executing of three or four Traytors may be Iustice, yet to hang up many millions, would be termed cruelty let the fact be what it will. Let there be a general Toleration, for unless it be general we shall never be at rest, but furnish knaves still (as I said before) with advantages to cousin poor people, & provoke them (being once deluded) to kick against their lawful Magistrate. Let Presbyterians whine their fill, & tell us of Soulsaving-sending home-comforts; let Phanatiques sigh till they be in earnest; & let Papists tire them∣selves with their Pater nosters & Ave Maries, & then I am sure they will all of them soon find the honour & welfare of their Country to be their only interest. Nor is there danger that the bare hopes of recovering the publick Lands they once bought in the late civil War, will make the Body of Pha∣natiques fond of alterations; since they very well know, let what changes soever happen (which God in his mercy defend us always from) the new Adventures will get the prey to themselves, for that must be proportioned to each Actor, according to what be then do's, & not to what he or his fa∣ther formerly did: but though by rebellion they can have no assurance of reenjoying their old silly purchases, or any temporal gain more than other new partizans, yet all of them are sure that Liberty f Conscience will be granted them from the first, what faction soever takes up arms against the King, which must needs make even quiet Sectaries greedy to hear of insurrections & broile. How easily therefore will Toleration hinder this na∣tural tendency, & how necessary are the means of preventing such an ill? for wo be to that country to so great a part of whose Inhabitants, sedi∣tion & disorders are a certain advantage. 'Twere needless to mention the many places where Toleration even at present is granted, as well in Popish as Protestant Countryes, which shows all discourses against its unpracticableness chimerical, & the idle whimsies of men's brains; nay, we that know that in Holland, & in many provinces of Germany (besides several plantations, in the East & West Indies, & a thousand
other places) Dissenters are not only good Subjects & make the publick interest of the Country their own, but also after their playing the fool a while, they become tyr'd at last by being let alone, & then commonly conform themselves to the Religion of the Government under which they happen then to be. Nor is this all for Toleration will convert several Sects from those abominable opinion▪ as to Obedience which now they are thought tainted with; because whilst they secretly meet in by places what may not their Pastors infuse into them, & what will they not easily swallow; being discontented & troubled? On the other side, if their Churches be publique & allowed by Authority, we may all then not only truly know what is taught by them but also their Congregations (being enjoyned to give up in writing the sum of their tenets) will without peradventure soon con∣form to the due obedience mentioned; for 'tis certain to all mankind that things positively against the Law of Nature (as Murther, Theft, Adultery, Liberty to kill Kings when we please, & the like) will never be permitted by any Power in the world, & therefore the Knaves, or Ringleaders of our Sectaries (whose ambition & design is to draw people after them) dare not insist upon such Doctrines, as know∣ing it canot be so much as coniv'd at by his Majesty; & instead of being thought martyrs they are sure also to be deserted by their own followers, who will soon discover the cheat, when they find the King really Indulgent & good natur'd & shockt at nothing, but at that which is destructive & hurtful in it self: for as I said before, There's no Body of men truly anarchicall. This will cause them then at least to explicate the worst, & most seditious Doc∣trines so, that Rebellion must be own'd unlawful, & the persons of Kings esteemed Sacred; by which great numbers will be undeluded, & made faithful, seeing that publickly condemned by their own Assembly which now a best lyes undetermi∣ned & therefore may be asserted by the Preacher when he pleases. Moreover this enjoyning each Congregation to give in a Confession of their Faith, will certainly reduce all Sectaries to their wits; for thus they will be accustomed to stand to some principles or other, wheras now they have nothing positive, & consequent∣ly can hardly be confuted, the only aim of their political & cunning teachers. If it be then true protestant charity not to damn Christians for opinions whilst they agree in the main, If moreover Sects are already so fixt, that they cannot be rooted out by force without destroying the Nation, and if severity blinds them that would otherwise see the truth, and makes them persevere in their errors, entailing also a hatred against the Government on most of the Poste∣rity (which at present weakens and may for the future again undo us) where is the fruit of tormenting men for their consciences, unless it be to furnish our Sectaries (especially papists) with an unanswerable argument for any action committed whilst the power was in their hands. But if liberty were granted if guilty men only suffer'd & not their parties, & if dissenters were capable of favour & trust, all people would joyn in the mainte∣nance of the Goverment, Delinquents might be punish'd to the satisfaction of
the rest also the designes of all dangerous Miscreants would be wholly frustra∣ted; & in that consists the only possibility of new troubles. Nor can Dissenters by Liberty of Conscience have any pretence in the least to Bishopricks, Danries, or our other present Ecclesiastical preferments, more than to any mans private lands; be∣cause they never contributed to them, & therefore the King (had be no other title) must dispose of them, being ever heir where there is none; & to how many men of parts & learning, our famous Monarchs have still from time to time since the Reformation bestowed them, no English man can I am sure be ignorant. What Sectaries give of their own for the maintenance of their Pastors, in Gods name let them have it, & as for the claim of Papists to the Premisses we need not fear it, though our Ancestors of that perswasion were the Benefactors; for they that got the Pope in Q Maries time for the quiet of the Kingdom to conform the Act of Parliament that sold Abby lands (which makes our title to them un∣questionable upon all accounts whatsoever) will without doubt in consideration of Indulgence do again the like, should any man be so scrupulous as to desire their release to that little which is still left the Church. No benefit can there be to invent new Sects, or to continue them, because Liberty to do as they please will quite cool (as I said the zeal of men delighted with novelties, nor shall the persons of many now amongst us be admired, who under pretence of suffering for God, devour Widdows & Orphans, & by de∣grees become the ruine both of Church & State. How great & strong therefore must the Church of England grow by this Indul∣gence, when 'twil be no advantage for Deceivers (that now daily rage) to rob her of her children, & what shall hinder the sheep that went astray to return when they find neither pleasure nor profit in their folly? Nor shall we then (to the pre∣sent wonder of mankind be always consulting about Religion, as our very Gramer has it; nor wi l our Parliaments be longer troubled with the insolencies of Papists & Phanatiques, which has been the common artifice to divert sober motions, when they ran counter to the private interest of a few. Having thus stated each party's principles & case as ful as I could (& really believing Toleration will so settle us in our spiritual & temporal concerns, that in a trice neither of them will have any considerable enemies left) now defie our Dissenters themselves to prevent their own ruine, though I have discover'd every thing, & show'd them the very trap and pitfall. All that theit Leaders can (I am sure) do, is (as some have already done) to hinder underhand that Indulgence which they seem so earnestly to desire; for they are sensible enough (as I mention'd) that they will hereby not only loose the pre∣sent benefit they make of their followers (who in peace will soon be weary of them) but also that a l heir rebellious designs must be frustrated, as being never able to perswade them to fight the battai s of the Lord or in plain E glish to re∣bell, that already enjoy what they hope for by the danger: & besides al these true reasons, Pitty it self cast's something into the Ballanci; for if the righteous man be merciful to his beast, much more ought we so to be poor well meaning Christians.
