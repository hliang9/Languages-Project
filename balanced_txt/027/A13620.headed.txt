NICOLAI VDALLI CARMEN ENDECA syllabum ad libel∣lum suum. SI certum est tibi pertinax libelle, In multas hominum manus venire, Doctorum{que} libet subire nasum, Sannas, verbera, iurgium cachinnos: Per me fit tibi liberum vagari, I quocun{que} voles tuo periclo, Securus poteras domi latere, Et mecum poteras manere tutus▪ Nunc es publicus, haud meus libellus, Nec possum tibi iam patrocinari, Nec suffragia, gratiam{que} vulgi, Aut vitam, genium{que} polliceri.

NICOLAVS VDALLVS SVAVISSIMO DIS∣cipulorum suorum gregi, salutem plurimam dicit. QVANQVAM INI∣tio quidem, vt ingenuè fatear non mea voluntate ad hane docendi prouinciam capes∣sendā inductus, sed pertina∣cissimis eisdem{que} importu∣nissimis amicorum quorun∣dam solicitationibus efflagitationibusq́ue com∣pulsus, partim, nescio quo meo fato protrusus vi∣deri poteram: nunc tamen, postquam egregia quorundam vestrûm indoles, luculentam sanè mi∣nime{que} dubitatam spem ostendit, fore aliquando, vt ad insignem aliquam eruditionem euadatis, ātum abest, vt me instituti, coeptiquè poeniteat vt nihil profectò, hodiè prius habeam, aut antiquius. Quapropter quam sorte, nactus sum spartam, or∣nare (prout Graecorum prouerbium admonet) mihi proposui, plane{que} constitutum habeo supe∣ris bene iuuantibus, in hanc gnauiter curam in∣cumbere, insigniter{que} in eo elaborare, vt vos ex immanissimis barbariei faucibus quamprimùm eripiam, atque ex tenebrosa abstrusaqùe inscitiae caligine vindicem, ad politioris literaturae puri∣tatem, lucem, claritudinem. Nec dici meherculè
potest, quanto desiderio flagrem, quanta{que} quùm omnium qui literis sunt dediti, tùm vestris dun∣taxat honest is & rectis studijs proficiendi cupidi∣tate ardeam. Iam inde enim ab co tempore, quo n meam vos scholam & disciplinam recepi, pa∣rentis erga vos animum induisse me fateor, sem∣perq́ue existimasse, in corundem me locum suc∣cedere, a quibus traditi mihiad instituendú estis-Quod cum ita sit, vt est, quam mihi rem gratam & iucundam, quàm porrò laetabilem & gloriosam putatis fore, si vos aliquando ad eas in disciplina vires accrescere & peruenire videro, vt exupe∣ratis euictisq́ue isti grammaticarum praeceptio∣num, & rudimentorum difficultatibus, ac velut salebris, ad iucundissimam, eandem{que} multo vber∣rimi fructus latinorum autoxum lectionem, stu∣dium transferre valeatis. Ad hanc autem maturi∣tatem cum animaduerterem, non alia demùm ra∣tione perueniri posse, nisi quis in promptu iam antè, & ad manum habeat bonam atque adeò di∣uitem latini sermonis supellectilem, sedulò equi∣dem mihi faciundum putaui, ne vobis deesset, vn de ea potissimè facultas parari possit, & latini ser∣monis copia, puritas, niror, elegantia, nullo aut certè quam minimo negotio perdisci. Scripsi ita∣que vobis suauissimi tyrunculi, quasdam latinè lo▪ quendi formulas, ad cotidiani sermonis vsum & copiam sanè quàm accommodatissimas. Eas verò ex Publij Terentij potissimùm comoedijs dele∣gimua, quod is scriptor ad inform and am, instruen∣dam{que} linguam puerilem maximè omnium ido∣neus,
citraqúe, controuersiam facilè princeps vi∣deatur: vtpote per quem, ipsum Tullium Cice∣ronem, summum alioqui latinitatis magistrum▪ ad tantum eloquentiae fastigium profecisse con∣stet, id quod quum ipsemet de se fatetur alicubi, imò potiòs gloriatur, tum scripta cius vbique cla∣mitant. Porrò Latin a ipse Angelicè interpretatus sum, quò vos quoque latina vernaculè, aut è contrario latinè vernacula abs{que} molestia vel negotio, & cū aliqua ratione ac gratia, nec interim ineptis pror∣sus atque absurdis (quod plerique faciunt) sed ap∣positis & accommodatis verbis reddere addisca∣tis. Neque verò putetis velim, nullum esse operae∣precium, si quis latina aptè in maternum ver∣ere sermonem calleat. Nam si Cicero quaedam ox Graecis tam poetis, quam oratoribus ac philo∣sophis, latinè interpretādo quae in suos referret li∣bros, operaepreciū existimare se fecisse nonnusquā gloriatur: si Terentius plus sibi laudis statuit, maio∣ré{que} gloriam posuit in vertendis Graecorū antiquis fabulis, quam inueniendis suis nouis: si idē Teren∣tius rem nihilo minus ingeniosā arbitratus est, ex bonis Graecis bona latina facere, quā si ipse de suo noua excogitasset scriberet{que}, & posteris legenda traderet: si deni{que} ingenij argumentū & nō postre∣mae laudis op' existimatur, bona vernacula sic ver∣bis latinis mutare, vt interim seruetur vtrius{que} lin∣guae idiotissimus & gratia: quî minus id quoque  diuerso maximae laudi dari par sit & vel summi ar∣tificis
opus haberi conueniat, ex bonis latinis ▪ licet, reddere bona vernacula? Verum, vt redeam quo coepi tendere, nec lusto diutius in his haeream, imò consilij vobis facti{que} mei rationem compen∣dio expediam: addidi, cubi opus id esse videba∣tur, quaedā velut scholia, quibus tum sensus poet explicetur, tum verba ipsapaulò declarentur a∣pertiùs. Si qua insignis aut elegans incidit meta∣phora, indicaui, Si qua figura occurrit, admonu. Si qua fabula interuenit, non sum grauatus ltius∣culè reperitam narrare, Si quid quod adlatinita∣tem egregiè faceret, sese obtulit, non commisi vt praeteriretur silentio. Si quid ad rationem gram∣maticam pertinere visum est, non piguit enucle∣are, Si quid prouerbij interspersum est, expos. Si quod vocabulum obscurius iudicatum est, illu∣straui. Si qua formula à communi vulgariqùe, & vsitata latinè loquendi ratione paulo alienior ap∣paruit, rationem reddidi, citatis, vbi res posceret, atque adhibitis, ex optimis quibusque & proba∣tissimis authoribus exmplis ac testimonijs. De∣niquè vt finem tandem faciam, quicquid vsquam obiectum est, quod purile ingenium iudiciù mue retardare in legendo posse videretur▪ quantumuis id humile foret aut leue, sedulò adnotaui, vestris scilicet studijs quàm optimè consultum cupiens, omnibus{que} omnium vestrûm commodis nusquam non libentissimè deseruiens. Proindè haee quidem quae commemoraui, omnia pingui, quod dicitur, crassa{que} ac rudi Minerua tradidi, & vereor, ne quo rundam opinione, iudicio, sententia{que} nimis etiam

Sed nimis mihi in hòc duntaxat negotio, placuit illud, quod dici solet indoctis modò apertius, presertim, cum scirem quàm maxi∣mè opus esset, nil nisi velut premansum vobis in os inseri. Porro ipsum opusculum FLORES TE∣RENTII libuit in scribere, quoniam hae formu∣lae quas vobis iam nuncupamus ex eius poetae lepi∣dissimis iuxta atque elegantissimis comoedijs, quasi horto quodam fragrantissimo, & ad miralum va∣rio, amaenoquè topiario ordine omnes selectae sūt & excerptae. His igitur laborum nostrorum quasi primitijs fruimini tanquam arrabone ac pignore tū nostri erga vos summi amoris ùm officij, ac fidei. Quod si prodesse haec conducerequé vestris stu∣dijs intellexeimus: alia fauente Christo dabimus propediē altiora at{que} maiora.

Ipse licet venias Musis comitatus Homere, Si nihil atuleris▪ ibis Homere foras. Foris, to vsed with verbes be tokening beyng, or, resting in a place, abroade, or from home: as my father is forth.

Denotat enim actum corporis. Ex Val. cap. 23, lib. 1. elegan∣tiarum, Accerso, is, iui, ire, of the fourth coniu∣gation is to cal. Albeit, Accersio as (Valla sayth in the place aboue cyted) ys oftentimes vsed for Accerso.

For this coniunction

Donatus in com∣mentarijs. Falsum est quod regitur id quod fac∣tum est. Vanum, quod fieri non potest. Fictum quod non est factum, & fieri potuit, Vel: Fal∣sum est fictum mendacium simile veritati: Va∣num, nec possible, nec verisimile. Fictum to ine vero, sed verisimile. Falsum loqui menda∣ci est. Vanum stuli▪ fictum calidi. Falsum lo∣qui culpae est. Fictum▪ virtutis Vanum veco∣d. Falsis decipimr. Fictis delectamur. Van contemnimus▪ And Contineo for taceo, Meta∣phora est à vasis liquorem continentibus,  metaphore, or translation taken of vessels th can hold liquor and not leake, nor runne out▪ 25 Plenus rimarum sum, hàc atque illàc perfluo▪ I am ful of chappes, or hooles, and runne out or, leake at this place, and that place, or eue where. Tracta metaphora à vasis fractis, rim∣sis, miniméque liquoris continentibus. Perfluo∣ris, luxi, Perfluere, perfluxum, is to runne out  euery part, or, on euery syde. Vt Lagena ma materiata, vel malè compacta perfluit, Lage∣na, is an earthen caken, or pitcherd, more v∣sed for wyne then for water, which if it bee no iust made or els crased, it wil leake and run out in euery place. Caue illi quicquam committas quod acitum▪
velis, nam vndiqúe perfluit. Beware that you trust not him, with any thing that you would haue kept secrete, for he runneth out in euery part, as a broken pitcherd. So in this place, hàc, atque illàc perfluo, id est, in modum non fidelis lagenae, quae mihi com∣mittuntur▪ effūdo. And transfluo is of the same signification, that perfluo is Valla. lib. 5. eleg. cap. 31 26 Taceri si vis, vera dicito. If thou wilt haue it kept secret, tel truth. 27 Ea habitabat Rhodi, She dwelleth at Rhodes. 30 Arbitror, certum non scimus, So I thinke, but the truth, or, certaynty we know not. 31 Matris nomen & patris dicebat, He tolde the name of his father and mother, or, he told the names of his parentes. 33 Per aetatem non potuerat, Hee could not, hee was so young, or, because he was very young, an elegant manner of speakinge, obserued and noted apud Hadrianum Cardinalem de ser. lat.

Where note the vse of th tenses of verbes. It is to be sayde in the Lat authors of old time, here, esset, and not fuisse and yet manye, etiam qui sibi videntur esse all quid posteriore loquendi modò nunquàm no vtuntur. 38 Sororem plerique esse credebant meam.

space. Donatus in his commentares vppon the second Scene of the second Act of the same co∣medye readeth interea loci as it were one word Dia to hyphen, id est, per subunionem▪ Sub∣unio is a marke that the Greekes vse whē two sundrye dictions or vocables are to bee ioyned into one, and so readeth Donate here, Interea loci. Vt pronuncietur acuta antepenultima: Duae, inquiens, partes orationis cum coniunctae vnam fecerint, mutant accentum. Interea loci ergo, id est, interea, in the meane whyle in the meane tyme or space. 7 Post illa. i. ab eo tempore Since that time. Li∣nacre in his sixt booke, which is intituled De figuris constructionum of the figures of con∣struction, vnderstandeth tempora, and likewise in posteà, and sayth that in these and such other maner of speakinges, as Ex quo, ex eo, ex illo, postea, post illa, &c is Eclipsis of this noune tē∣pus, as in these examples. Virg. Ex quo Titides. Idē. Ex illo fluere ac retrò sublapsa reserri. Sue∣ton in the lyfe of Domitianus. Neque cessauit ex eo tempore, and likewyse in such as this. Ver. Ante expectatum positis stat in agmine castris, for ante expectatum tempus. But as the same Linacre in an other place noteth, Post illa, is an Aduerbe of tyme, or vsed aduerbiallye, and is made on worde of twayne. by Subunton, like as Interea loci next afore. Mea consilia tibi credo omnia. I commit all my secrets vnto you, or, I trust you with all

Suffer him to haue the prehe∣minence with mee, or, in my house for a few dayes, or, for these two or three dayes. 72 Nihil respondes? Make you me none answere at all? or, will you not speake to me?

A Metaphore taken of foulinge, or, takynge of Foule. For Auceps properlye is a fouler, and Aucupium is foulinge, and by a Metaphore, it is vsed for all maner of waies, to get any thing by wyles, traynes, or, craft, and it is deryued
of the verbe Aucupor, aris, to goe a fouling▪ and to take byrdes, and by translation, Aucupari laudem, is to goe aboute to get prayse and com∣mendation, Aucupari quaestum, to goe about to get money. 16 Ego hanc primus inueni viam, I was the first that found out this way, or I found out this way first. 17 Est genus hominum, qui esse primos se omniū erum volunt, There is one sort of men, which would haue prtheminence aboue all others, or which dsyre to bee highest of al, and to be had most in honor, or would be the ringleaders, or that would rule all the roste. 18 Hsee ego non paro me vt rediant, Among such men I do not so facion, ordre, or vse my selfe to make them to laugh at me. 19 His vltò arrideo, To such (whatsoeuer they say▪ or d) I shew a mery smiling cotenaunc, for the nones, or of myne owne selfe. 19 Eorum ingenia admiror▪ I make a great mar∣uaylyng at theyr high wittes. 20 Quicquid dicu laudo, What soeuer they say▪ I prayse, commend, or allow it. 20 Id usum i negant, laudo id quoque, that if they denye the fe fame agayne, that also I commend and hold withall. 22 Is quaestus nunc est mul vberrimus, By so doing, as the world goeth now, a man may get a maruaylous good liuing▪ for, that is now a dayes,  mayuaylous ready way to get money, Or, now a dayes that is the very cheefe and

I byte, or wringe, or, vexe the fellow, or, I nettle him now▪ For vro vris vssi vstum, is to burne, or to parche, and it is as wel of cold as of heat Lucanus, Vrebant montana niues. All the hilles, and that that groweth vpō thē were parched with snow or cold. Virg. Aut Boreae penetrabile frigus adurat, or, when the sharp, nypping, or, pearsing cold of the North wynde pearceth &c. Vrere hominem▪ By tran∣slation, is to vexe a man, and to make him sory at the hart, and as wee also by translation say in English, to byte, to nyp, to wrynge, to netle, to make woe. And the passiue Vror, is sem blably vsed for Cruciari, to be vexed, to be woe or, to be sory at the hart. Plaut in Bachid. Quā magis id repeto, tam magis vror, The more I remember, or consider it, the more I am sory & vexed, or greued withal. Idem in Persa. Vritur cor mihi, My hart burneth. Idem in Menech. Viden tuilli occulos vrier? vt viridis exoritur color ex temporibus? Dost thou not see his
eyes burne as redde as fyre? and how that his ēples waxe or begin to be as greene as grasse? Virgil vsed vro, in the same signification for ar∣deo, as though it were a verbe Neuter passiue▪ Vrit atrox Iuno. The cruell and fierce goddesse Iuno, was sore grieued, or burned in yre. i. ex∣arsit or exanduit. 44 Quàm hoc munu gratum▪ Thaidi ar bitrare esse? How welcome shal this gift be vnto Thais trowest thou? Or how wel wil Thais like this gift. or, present, thinkest thou? 45 Omnium retum vicissitudo est, The world chaungeth euery day, It is a prouerbe, by which is signifyed, that in this worlde is no thing stable, permanent, nor durable, but like as the sea doth continually flow and ebbe▪ so do all the thinges in the world dayly chaunge now vp, now downe, now mery now sad, now friende, now foe, now accepted and anone out of fauour, now familiar and anone cleane dis∣acquainted, to day who but he? and to morrow shut cleane out of doores. &c. Eras. in Chiliad. 46 Sex ego te totos menses quietū red dā, ne sur∣sùm deorsùm cursites, I will see thee at rest for running vp and downe for one whole sixe moneth, or I wil ease, or release thee of run∣ning vp and downe, for the space of one whole halfe yeare full. 47 Ne vsque ad lucem vigiles, Watch not vp til the morning. 48 Ecquid te beo? Do not I thee a blessed turne?
49 Detineo te fortasse, tu profecturus alio fueras, I keepe you, or let you of your way, I weene you were going to some other place, or some ise whether. 50 Paulum da mihi operae, Helpe me a litle, or let me haue your helpe a litle. 50 Fac vt admittar ad illam, Helpe that I may come to her, and speake with her, or get mee to come to her speech. 51 Nunc ribi patent fores.

Standest thou here yet Parmeno? 55 Nùm tu hic relictus custos, nequis fortè inter∣nuncius cursitet. Art thou set here to watche & to see, that no messenger may perchaunce runne or come betweene. 57 Facile dictum, Merely spoken. 58 Video herilem filium minorem huc aduenire I see my maysters yonger sonne comming he∣ther. 60 Non temerè est, It is not for naught. 60 Properans venit, Hee commeth in hast. 60 Nescio quid circumspectat, He looketh about whatsoeuer the matter is.
In the third Scene of the second Acte. 2 E conspectu amisi meo. I haue lost it out of my sight, or, I haue lost the sight of it, or it is gone out of my sight. 3 Vbi quaeram? Wher may, or should I seeke him? 3 Vbi inuestigem? Where may or should I fynd which way she went? Vestigare, est per vestigia quaerere seu indagare. To seeke by the steps and print of the foote, and by the trace. Plaut. in tru∣culento. Hac vna opera circumit per familias, puerum vestigat. She goeth al vnder one to euery mans house, and traceth the boye. And by translation it is to make diligēt serch for any thinge. Cic. lib. 3. de oratore. Ipsa tractatio & quaestio quotidiè ex se gignit aliquid, quod cum desidiosa delectatione vestiges. The very han∣dling, or▪ exercise, and the matter it selfe doth e∣uery daye of it selfe, bringe forth some thinge, which a man maye, or would seeke out with quiet delectation and pleasure. Inuestigare est per vestigia inuenire. To find out by the foote, by the steps, or by the trace, and treade of the feete, as they that hunt and trace the wylde beastes and follow them by the foote, and by the trace find them out, and (by a Metaphore therof takē) it is to find out any thing by dili∣gent serching Plautus in Mercat. Non conce∣dam, neque quiescā vsque, noctu neque diu, pri∣ùs, profectò, quam aut amicā aut mortem inue∣stigauero. I wil not geue ouer, nor reste in any
anye place, neyther by night, nor by day, at the least wise before, or, vntil I shal haue found ei∣ther my loue, or else death. Terent. in Heau. Nihil est▪ tam difficile, quin quaerēdo inuestiga∣ripossit. There is nothing so hard, but that by diligēt serching & seeking it may be found out. Cice. in oratione pro Q. Ligario Sed quoniam diligentia amici inuestigatum est, quod latebat confitendum est, vt opinor, but seeinge that by the good diligence of a friēd, that thing is now found out▪ which was hidden and vnknowen, it should be confessed as I thinke, or suppose. 3 Quem perconter? Of whom might I aske? 3 Quam insistam viam? What way may I take, or, go? 4 Vna haec spes est, There is no hope but this. 4 Vbi vbi, est diu celari nō potest, Whersoeuer hee be, he cannot be hidden longe. 5 O faciem pulchram, O fayre and goodly face. 6 Taedet horum quotidianarum for matum, I am wearye of these, that amonge vs are called and taken for fayre women, or I haue done with those fayre women, that we haue dayly here a∣mong vs. 7 O infortunarum senem, O infortunate, or, vn∣happy old man. 8 Ludum iocumqúe dices fuisse illum alterū prae∣vt huius rabies quae dabit, Thou, wouldest saye that the other was but a play and sporte in cō∣parison of those thinges, or, of such pranks, as this felow will play in his rage.
Donatus doth order it thus, Prae vt, scilicet illa sunt, quae huius rabies dabit. i. faciet patra∣bit, monstrabit ostendet Prae sometymes is ve∣ry elegantly vsed, importing a certayne respect and comparison to an other thing. Terence in his comedye a litle afore, Ibi ego illum con∣tempsi prae me, Then did I nothing regarde him in comparisō of my selfe. And in this sig∣nification, Prae is oftētimes (specially in Plau∣tus and Terence) found compound with quam and vt, as Hadrian hath noted examples. Prae alone hauing an Ablatiue case after him Plau∣tus in Mostellaria. Video te nihil pendere om∣nes homines prae Philolache, I see that you set by no man in comparison of Philolache. Idem in Mil. Prae illius forma quasi sperans tuam, as who sayth, you set not by your owne beauty in comparison of hers, or as we should say, you thinke not your selfe fayre in compari∣son of her. Ci Seruio Sulpitio, non tu quidem vacuus molestijs sed prae nobis beatus. In deede you are not voyde of some troubles or without some care, but yet in comparion of me, euen in heauē. Prae quam Plaut. id Aulul. Sed hoc etiā charū est prae quā vbi sumptus petūt, But this is euen a goodly, or tolye thing in comperison of whan they require cost, charges, or, expence of money. Idem in Amphitrio. Paruares est, voluptatū in vita, praequam quod molestum est There is small pleasure in this life in compa∣rison of the troubles and cares that be in the
same. Praevt Plaut Mil. Nihil herclè hoc quide est, praevt alia dicam, Nay thys is no∣thing in comparison of other thynges, that I will tell, or shewe you. Idem in Ampho. Pa∣rùm etiàm praevt futurum est praedicas. Thou sayest, or speakest euen very litle, or in maner nothing in comparison of that that shalbee in deede. Idem in Menech. Modestior nunc quidē est de verbis praevt dudùm fuit. He is now so∣ber in his woordes in comparison of that hee was right nowe, or a litle whyle agone. 9 Vt illum Dij Deaeq́ué senium perdant. God & all the saincts in heauen, geue that old Churle a mischiefe: or a vengeaunce light on that olde Churle, I pray God & all the sainctes in hea∣uen. Vt heere, & in such other like maner spea∣kinges, is taken for Vtinam, execrādo vel op∣tando, in cursing or banning. or wishing. Plaut. in Persa. Vt istum Dij Deae{que} perdāt, God and all the sainctes geue this knaue a mischiefe, or sende him a shamefull death. Idem in Mostel∣laria, Vt Dij Deae{que} omnes me pessimis exem∣plis interficiāt nisi ego illam interfecero sitifa∣me{que} atque gelu, I pray God & al the sayncts, sende me the most shameful death that may be, to the example of al others, if I doe not surely kill her vp with thirst and hunger and colde. See more examples in Hadrian, De ser. lati. Further note that in this woord Senium, is Emphasis, which is a figure eyther whan some thing that is hidden and not spoken, is meant, or els whē it is spokē, for a more expresse plain
and vehement setting out, and expressing of al thing which may be many wayes, but the prin¦cipal and most elegant way is, when a Sub∣stantiue is set for an Adiectiue, that is to saye whan any quality is put for the personne that hath the qualitie, as Scelus, vngraciousnesse, pro Scelesto, for one that is vngracious: and so here Senium, agednesse, or olde age, pro Sene, for him that is old. For as Donatus saith Se∣nex is referred to the age of yeares. Seniū for the contumelious and despiteful, and cōtemp∣tuos wordes. And therefore I English, Illū Seniū y• old churle. Where note yt albeit Seniū, is the neuter gender, yet it hath ioyned wyth him an Adiectiue of the Masculine gēder, and the Relatiue that cōmeth after, is also put in the Masculine gendre, for as Donatus witnes∣seth, the gendre both of the Adiectiue, and alo of the Relatiue, is referred to the thing that is vnderstande, that is to saye, Senem, or hominē senem. So Terēe in the Prologue of thys se∣cond Comedie, Eas se non negat personas trā∣stulisse in Eunuchum suam ex Graeca. He saith not nay, or he doth not denie, but that he tooke the same partes that are in the Greeke Come∣die, from thence into this his Comedy intitu∣led Eunuchus: Eunuchū is the Masculine gen∣dre, and yet because there is ment by it Comoe∣diam, therefore the Adiectiue Suam is put in y• Feminine gendre. Idem in Andria. Vbi illic▪ i. ille scelus est, qui me perdidit.? Where is y• vngratious knaue, that hath casie me away?
Idem in Adel. Festiuum caput, qui omnia sibi posthabenda putârit esse prae meo commodo, the gentlest companyon, or the most honest, or, the best felow aliue, which coulde fynde in his hart to let all other thinges alone, or, to set all other thinges apart in respecte of my commo∣dity and pleasure, or, for my commoditye and pleasure. By Caput is vnderstood Aeschy∣nus, and therefore the Relatiue qui, hauing res∣pect and relation to the person that is meant, and not to the Substantiue▪ that is expressed▪ is put in the Masculine Gender, and not in the Neuter gendre, by the figure of construction called Synthesis 9 Meremoratus est, Hee caused mee to tarrye, or▪ stayed me; or hindred mee of my way, i est, de∣tinuime. 10 Qui illum non flocci fecerim. That I set not so much as a straw, or a rush by him. Floccus is any le ragge of a locke of wolle, the which is vnprofitable, and the which wil serue for no∣thing, and is pulled from the fleece, and cast a∣way, or some lyke thing of no value, price, or, estimation, wherof the Latine men, when they wil signify, or shew, that they set nothinge by a man, or any other thing, vse to say prouerbially Flocci non facio or els Flocci facio indifferēly. For which wee Englishmen in a like prouerbe say▪ I set not the least straw or rush vnder my foote by it: or, I set not the least hayre on my head by tralbett for this latter, both y• Grekes and Latine men, haue a peculier prouerb takē
of the same thinge. Pli. non facio, I set not  hayre by it. 11 Quid tu es tristis? Why are you sad? 11 Quid tu es alacis▪ Why are you mery? 12 Vnde is i nde venis? From whence commest thou? 12 Nescio herculè, nec vnde eam, nec quorlùm cam. In good sooth I can not tell neyther frō whence I come, nor whither I go. 13 Piorsus oblitus sum mei, I haue qu and cleane forgotten my selfe. 14 Quî quae so? How so I bescech you? 14 Nunc te ostendas qui vir scies. Now shew thy selfe what a man thou art. 15 Scis te mihi saepè pollicitum esse, Thou knowest thou hast often promised me, or made me promise. 16 Vlatem faciam,  cognoscas mam, I shall do, or I shal fynd the meanes, that thou shalt know end see what seruice I can doe. 18 Fac nunc promissa appareant▪ Now let your promisses appeare, and beseene, or see that your promisses may now appeare. 22 Est paulo habitior, He is somwhat fat, round or  good lyking. 24 Noua figura ois, color veus, corpus solidum & succi plenum▪ Such fauour of race and vi∣sagē, as you haue not much seene, true▪ & natiue colour, and not of paynting, her body oūd, lu∣sty, and nothing decayed, but ful of good bloud and holesome hums, 26 Mihi vel vi, vel clam vel precario fac tradas,
Se that thou get it me, or into my handes ey∣ther perforce and by strength of handes, or els by priuy conueyance▪ and stealth, or, els o lone for a litle whyle, and then to be restored home agayne. For Precarium, carij, is that thinge which is by prayer, instaunce & petition gra∣ted to any body to vse, to occupy, or, to enioy, so long as it shal please & cōtent the party, that doth so lend, or graunt it▪ and no longer. So Alexander. Apud Qu Cur. sayth. Mori praestat quam paecario impetatr esse. Better it is to dye then to bee a captayne, or  king at the pleasure of other men and no lōger. Ibidem. Precarium spernebat imperium. He set nothing by that powre, dominiō, or, rule which should continue so long as pleaseth thē that gaue or graunted it, and no longer. And vnder this meaning did Seneca say, ho∣minem esse precarij spiritus. That the lyfe of man doth continue at the pleasure of Nature, Fae, or destenye, . Parcarum, which take it a∣way when they wil. and not when it pleaeth vs. Of this the noune Precario in the voyce and termination of the Daiue case, is vsed Auerbally in the same signification Pau Iu∣riscons. Precariò habere videtur, qui possessi∣onē corporis vel iuris adeptus est, hac solùm∣modo causa {quod} adhibuit prece & impetrauit, {quod} sibi possidere aut vti liceat, veluti si me preca¦rio rogaueris, vt per fundum meum ire vel age∣re liceat, vel vt in tectum meum stillicidium, vel ignum in parieem immissum habeas.
A man to haue a thing precario, sayth Paulu seemeth to be when any body hath obtayned  goē the possessiō of any body, or, bodely thing or of any right and title of any thing only, for because he made request and instaunce for the same, and thereby hath obtayned, that it may be lawful for him to possesse, or to vse, and oc∣cupy it. As if you should make request and in∣staunce vnto me, and desyre me that you might for a whyle as long as it should please mee, to haue a way, or, to goe through my ground, or, to do any thing therein, or, es that you might haue a little gutter, or synke, to come by my house, or els to haue a after, ag, or, a beae, set within, or, vpon th walle of my house. Plin. de iris illustribus: Seuus ullius quasi precariò egnare caepit, sed tecte in perum ad∣ministrauit. Seruus Tullius began at the st to aygne in the citty of Rome as who should say Precario, that is, at the will and pleasure of the people, and as long as they would permitte and suffer him, and no lōger: but yet afterward he ordred and ded the same Empyre we ∣nough▪ Plinin epst. Quibus ex causis precario studeo, studeo tamen. For wich causes I study onely when please them, or, as long as they wil suffer me, and yet some study I haue▪ Cicer in the Oration▪ pro Aulo Cecinna, Ne id quidem satis est, nisi docet ita se possedisse vt nec vi nec clàm, nec precariò possederit▪ But yet that is not sufficiēt or, ynough neither except he planly shew and declare, that he had it so in hy pos∣session,
that he hld it neither by force & strēgth, nor priuly and vnknowinge to the owner, or ellse that he had it lent him for a season, to bee restored home againe when it should be requi∣red. For that be the thrce wayes, vnlawfully to keepe away any thinge of an other mans. And precatiò, in his signification may be vsed aduerbay, in many dyuers and sundry ma∣ner speakinges. For precariò concedere, is to lende or graunt a thing till you shall requre it agane. Precariò petere vel rogare, is to de∣syre to haue a thing, as long as may please the owner, and then make surrender and redeliue∣ry of the same, when it shalbe required. 26 Mea nihil refert, dum potiar modo. I care not so that I may haue, obtayne, or get it. 28 Virgo cuia est? What mayde is it? or what is shee? 29 Qua ratione amisisti How, or, by what chaūce or meane diddst thou leee it? 30 Equidem adueniens mecū stomachabar, mo∣do, as I was coming hither right now I was angry with my selfe, or in a great ume. 30 Neque quenquam esse hominem arbitror, cui mags bonae faelicitates omnes aduersae sient, And▪ I thinke there is no man aliue, that hath all good fortune and chaunces more agaynste hym, than I haue. These two woordes homo quisquam, be oft times elegantly thus ioyned together, notwithstanding that quisquā alone by it selfe, signifieth, as much as homo quisquā Liu. ab vrbe condit. Victoria cui nec deus, nec
homo quisquam inuidear, A victory, at which neither any of the goddes, nor yet any mā, hath or should, or may haue enuy, or grudge. 33 Quid hoc est sceleris?

But now at this tyme when it was my least desire, or least in my mynd, & will, and when it was nothing needful, or least expedient. 41 Nonne hoc monstri simile est? Is not this lyke a verye monster? or, is not this a verye straunge thinge? Monstruū. i. is deriued of mō∣stro, as, aui, are, to shew, whereof Monstrum is any thinge, that in signifying another thinge, doth shew it, Cicero de natura deorum: Mon∣stra, praedictiones, & praesentiónes rerū fuurarū: quid aliud declarant, nisi hominibus ea, quae fu∣tura sunt portendi, & praedici ex quo illa osten∣ta monstra, portenta, prodigia dicūtur? These straunge tokens, or. shewinge, prophecyinges and foreknowingees, and foreperceiuinges of thinges to follow and come: what other thing doe they declare, but suche thinges as shall in
ede follow after, to be afore signified, betoke∣ned, & shewed vnto men, and by reason thereof such, or the same thinges be called in Lne o∣stēta, mōstra, portēta, or prodigia, And therfore Virgil vsed Monstum, for and in eed of the noune verbal, monstratio. Mōstra deum refero, I make relation vnto you of such thinges as the gods haue shewed vnto mee. But because that such thinges, for the most part are noted by straunge sightes and chaunces (which not onely in our englishe tounge, but also in all o∣ther tongues or the most par are called mon∣sters after the latine word, Therfore Monstrū is most commonly vsed and taken for all suche thinges as are contrarye or agaynst the com∣mon ordre and course of nature, eyther in de∣faut & lacking, or els in excedinge, as to haue two thummes vppon one hande, or to be borne the heeles standing in the place of the toes, or to be borne without a nose, with others lyke. 41 Continuò ad me accurrit, He commeth run∣ning vnto me by and by. 45 Sin quid ego te volebam?

I spake but in sporte. Here note, that iocari & iocus bee properly in wordes, Ludere and Lu∣dus in deedes. Albeit, they bee in Authours confounded, that is to say, the one vsed for the other, as Valla proueth and sheweth by exam∣ples. Lib. 4. cap. 16. 85 Quid ego egi miser? What haue I done mi∣serable felow, or wretch that I am? 88 Istaec in me cudetur faba, The fault of this shall bee layde to mee, or thys myschiefe shall light on my necke. A prouerbe whereof reade in Chil. Eras. 89 Flagitium facimus, Wee goe aboute an hey∣nous offence, or, wee shoulde herein doe a de∣testable acte, or, it is a sinfull thynge that wee
goe about to doe. Facere flagitium, is to cōmit to perpetrate, or to doe an heynous offence, or a great trespasse. Plau. in penulo: Hae fores fe∣cerūt magnū flagitium modò. Ad. Quid flagitij est?

Defugere authoritatē, is to auoyde, and as who should say, to be afearde to follow and to doe that thinge y• any person hath authority to commaund, or els may do by authority. Cic. pro P. Sylla. Tu remp. reprehendis, qua do∣mesticos hostes, ne ab ipsis ipsa necaretur, neca uit. Ita{que} attende iam Torquate, quam ego de∣fugiā authoritatem consulatus mei. Thou re∣prouest the cōmō wealth, for that it hath put to death familier enemies & rebellious, that were within the city, least that by them, it selfe might haue ben oppressed and brought to vtter cōfu∣sion and desolation. Therefore ô Torquate, see now and mark well, how greatly I am afeard to stand by that, that I did, by, or, in the auco∣rity of myne office of consulship: as who should say, I woulde thee to weete, I am not fearde to stand by it, and that I do not now repent, or goe from that, that I did when I was consult in sleing Catiline and putting him to death. &c. as by the place in Tullie, the iudgement of a diligent reader may well see. 97. Dij vertant bene. God turne it to good, or bryng it to a good ende. ¶ In the thyrde Scene. 2 Non tàm ipso quidem dono laetus est {quam} abs te datum esse. He is not so glad of that gift or pre∣sent it selfe, as that it was geuē by you. 3 Id vero seriòr triumphat, Of that hee is mer∣ry or glad in deede, or, for that hee triumpheth
or glorieth earnestly, or inearnest. 4 Huc prouiso, vt vbi tempus siet, eum deducam. I come forth hither to se, that when tyme is, I may bring him thether, or awayte on him. 5 Est istuc datū mihi, grata, vt sint quae facio om∣nia. It is a gift geuen me, that all thinges that I do, euery man lyketh wel. 10 Qui habet salem, qui in e. est. i. sapientiam & leporem. Who so hath the wisedome, and plea∣saunt facion that you haue. Donatus expoun∣deth Salem. i. sapientiam wisedome. Where he noteth, that Sal, neutraliter condimentū sig∣nificat, masculinum pro sapientia accipitur Al∣beit Sal, when it is latine for Salt, is both the masc. and also the neut. gend. in both numbers Cato in re rust. Ex sale. Qui apud Carthaginiē∣ses fit. Of the salt that is made in the parties about the cittye of Carthage. Sal in Iug. neque salē, neque alia gulae irritamenta, Neyther salt nor any other thinges to prouoke the apptyte. Columel. Carnem salibus aspersam. Flesh, or meate poudred with sat. Paul. iuriscon. cotem. ferro subigendā, necessaria, quoque hostibus ve∣nundari, vt ferrum, & frumentum, & sales non sine capitis periculo licet. It is not lawful vn∣der the payne of death to sel to our enemyes, ey∣ther a whetstone to make any knyfe sharpe, or any other necessaryes, as yron or kniues, and wheat, and salt. &c. Sal. by translation is taken pro vrbanitate, lepôre, venustate, ioco, good & pleasaunt facion, and merye conceytes both in woordes and other wyse, as here in this place
of Terence, and Catul. Nulla in tam magno est corpore mica salis, There is not one crum or droppe of good fashion in al that great royls bodye. For Catullus ther speaketh of a certaine mayden that was called Quintia, whom many esteemed and called fayre, beautifull goodlye. In deede (sayth Catullus) I graunt that she is whyte of skinne, tall of personage, sclender of making, and bolt vpright, but that she is For∣mosa, that is, fayre, or beautifull, that I de∣nye, for there is no manner pleasantnes, nor good fashion in her. The verses of Catullus be these. Quintia formosa est multis, mihi candida, lōga, Recta est haec ego sic singula confiteor. Totum illud formosa nego, nam nulla vetustas Nulla in tam magno est corpore mica salis. Salis . venustatis lepôis Pleasauntnesse, grace & proper feature, or good fashion in her gesture behauiour, or, pleasaunt wordes. which may delyte them that see hir, heare hir, or bee in her company. Pla in Ca. Necpote quicquā cōme∣morari{que} plùs salis, plus{que} lepôris habeat hodie Necpote. s. est. i. non potest quicquam &c. It is not possible to reherse, or to shew anye thinge, that hath more grace, amiablenes, or pleasaunt fashion at this houre, where que is taken for id est plus salis, plusque lepôris for plus salis i. plus leporis, as I haue noted in other places afore. And hereof Sal, in the singular number and sales, in the plural, be taken for merye conceipts or delectable and pleasaunt communication, y•
may make, or cause, the hearers to laugh, & yet is somewhat sharp poynaunt & byting withall as witnesseth Quin. li. 6. And Pli. li. 31. cap. 7. of the naturall history, where he saith thus: Ergo Herculè vita humanior sine sale nequit degere, adeo{que} necessarium alimētū est, vt transierit in∣tellectus ad voluptates animi quo{que} Nā ita sales appellantur, omnis{que} vitae lepos, & summa hila∣ritas, laborum{que} requies nō alio magis vocabu∣lo constat. Than truely the life of man, being in any reasonable good condicion or state, can not continue without the vse of salt, which is so necessary and profitable an helpe & sustenaūce or sustentation to and for the lyfe of man, that the minde, intelligence, & vnderstanding, hath taken and made from the same a metaphore or trāslation vnto the pleasures and delectations of the mynde. For the sayde pleasures and de∣lectaciōs of ye minde, are called in latine Sales, and all maner pleasure of our life, & the high∣est myrth and pastime, that we haue (which cō∣sisteth in witty, mery, and pleasaunt communi∣cation or other ioyes) & also all qiet rest and case after the peinful labors, are by none other latin warde in the worlde better or more gene∣rally, or more vsully, or more expresly signified then by this word Sales, of which be metapho∣rically deriued many prety Adagies or Pro∣uerbes, as Sal, vitae amicitia, Frendship is the sake of mans lyfe, that is to say the only sauce that taketh away the werishnes thereof, & ma∣keth it pleasaūt or delectable: with other pro∣uerbes
mo, of the which reade Eras. Chil. & spe∣cially for this place of Tereuce, the prouerbe, Salsitudo non inest illi. 13 Sicubi eum sacietas hominum coeperari, If he were at any tyme weary of the company of men. 14 Negotij eum siquandò odium coeperat. i. taedi∣um, If at any time he were weary of his bust∣nes or great labours. 15 Requiescere vbi volebat. When hee was dis∣posed to be at quiet, or to rest after his labours 17 Me conuiuā solū abducebat sibi. Hee tooke me away with him, or hee woulde take away me, & no man els to be his guest, and to dyne or sup with him. 18 Sic homo est. Such is his fashion, or this is the fashion of the man. 20 Inuidere omnes mihi, ac mordere clanculū, for inuidebant & mordebant, Euery man had enuy or grudge at mee, and spake very ill by mee behynde my backe. 24 Vbi molestus mihi magis est. Whan he began to be some what busy wyth or whan he disqui∣eted or vexed mee, or woulde not lette mee bee in rest. 25 Eò ne es ferox, quia habes imperium in beluas? eône for idiòne. &c. Art thou therefore hasty on men because thou arte a mayster of bruite beastes? 26 Pulchrè me hercle dictum & sapienter, Well spoken by my soothe, and wisely.
29 Quid illud, quo pacto Rhodium etigerim i conuiuio, nun quid tibi dixi? What that? ho I toke vp or anted a felow of Rhodes as w sate at the table, did I neuer tel it thee? 31 Nunquam, sed narra obsecro, Nauer, but  it I besech you. 32 Plús millies iam audiui, I haue heard it al∣ready a thousand tymes and aboue. 32 Vnà in conuiuio erat hic, quem dico Rhodi∣us adolescentulus. Thys younge fellowe o Rhodes that I spake of, and I, sate together at the table. 34 Caepit me irridere. He began to mocke mee. 35 Quid ais, inquam, homo impudens? What sayest thou shamelesse, or thou sauy fellowe, quod I? 38 Tuum ne obsecro ho dictum erat? I pray you heartely, what, was that your saying? 39 Audierā saepè & fertur inprimis. I had heard it many tymes, and it is a sayinge as common as any is. 40 Dolet dictum imprudenti adolescenti▪ Thys woorde or saying, greeued the foolishe younge man. 41 Risu omnes qui aderant emori. All that were in compaigny, were almost dead with laughte Emori. i. emoriebātur, per antipôsin. For Do∣natus in many places noteth, that the infini∣tiue moode in such speakinges is more vehe∣ment and of more strength, and efficacy, then is the indicatiue. 42 Metuebant omnes iàm me. Than were they
all afearde of mee. Id vt ne fiat haec res sola est remedio. That that thing may not bee, or come too passe, this thing onely is a remedy and helpe. Phaedriam intromittamus comessatū. Let vs haue in Phedria to make good cheare with vs. Comessor, aris, ssatus, ssari. depon. is properly that wee say in englishe, to banquet after sup∣per, or to make rire suppers. Suetoni, in Do∣mitiano Conuiuabatur frequentèr & largè, sed penè raptim, certè non vltra soli occasum, nec vt posteà comessaretur. Hee tooke repastes and feasted both often and also eate much at once, and yet in mane neuer but by snatches, and of truth neuer longer then tyll the sunne went downe, nor neuer to banquet, nor to haue any rre supper after. Plau. in rudēte. Verum si vo∣letis plausum fabulae huic clarum dare, comes∣satū omnes veni tote ad me ad annos sexdecim. But and if you will clappe your hands to ge∣ther, that it sound loude in approuinge and al∣lowinge this Comedy, that wee haue played, come euery one of you home, & banket, or make good cheere for these sixtene yeres. Liui. li. x. De bell. Mace. reporteth that Demetriu after y• he had made a certayne supper to his compaig¦nions, sayde vnto them, Quin comessatum ad fratrem imus? Why go we not to my brothers to banket: And of comessari cōeth a noune ver∣bal comessario, deriued (as Festus Pam. wit∣nesseth) a vicis, quos graeci  dicunt, yt is of litle stretes. For in such, men dwelled before
that towns were builded, and there one woul bydde n other to drynking, or banquetting  good neighberhod, for of y• greeke noune  is deryued a verbe  to banket, and   is deriued comessor, in latine, prim longa, and with one , of comessor cōmeth ¦messario for bankeng, or making good che after sūpper. Sue in Vitel Epulas trifariam▪  per interdum quadriariā dispeiebat in ie eula, prādia, coenas & comessationes, he deuid his meales ino three euermore, and somtim into fowre, that is o weete, breakfastes dine suppers, and riere suppers, or banqueties, o coations after supper. 52 Pamphilā cantatum prouocemus, Let vs p Pamphila to singe. For as I thinke eren vseth here prouocare for euocare to cal forth a Prodir i. exire to goe forth, & that is hi mo propre stnification, & specially in this place o Terence, for he said afore, Intromittamus Phe∣driā, let vs haue in Phedria, & now contrary to y• Prouocemus Pamphilā, let cal forth Pāphil So Plau. in Pseu. Herus si domi est tuu qu nō prouocas? If thy maister be at home, y dost thou not cal him forth? Prouoco hath other sig∣nifications, but they pertayne not to this place. 54 Par pari referto. Do lyke for lyke 55 Quando illud quod tu das amat, te am, quā∣do pro quoniam. Seyng that he setteth store by that you geue vnto him, he loueth your selfe well.
56 Metuit semper, quem ipse nunc capit fructum ne quando iratus u alio conferas, He wil al∣wayes feare, least that fruit and profite, which him selfe taketh and hath now, you being angry with him, vppon displeasure wil bestow an o∣ther way. 60 Mihi istuc non in mentem venerat, I remem∣bred not so much. In the second Seene. 2 O Thais mea o meum suauium, quid agitur? O my deere Thais, O myne owne sweeting, how is it with you? 3 Ecquid nos amas?

By your leaue. 15 Perpulchra, credo dona haud nostris similia. Very goodlye giftes I am sure, but not lyke,
nor to bee compared vnto mine. 16 Res indicabit, The thing shal shewe it selfe. 16 Heùs, iubee istos for às exire ociús, Hoh sirs, bydde those felowes there come forth quickly. 17 Procede tu hùc. Come thou forth heere, and stande by mee. 18 Est ex Aethyopia vs{que} hic. This felowe is come as farre as from Ethiopia. 19 Vbi tu es? accede hùc. Where arte thou come hither. 21 Ita me dij ament, honestus est. As God help mee it is a goodly felow: or as we vse commō∣ly to speake, as I shalbe saued: or, as I trust to be saued, it is a goodly fellowe. 23 Tacent, satis laudant. They say nothing, and in that they prayse it sufficiently. For holding a mans peare and saying nothing, specially in a mans aduersary is a certayne kind of prasing or graunting, whereof there goeth a prouerb in latine. Qui tacet, consentire videtur. He y• hol∣deth his peace, and saith nothing, semeth to cō∣sent or to thinke as the other party sayde, and to be of the same mynde. 23 Fac periculum in literis. Proue him in lear∣ning. There is vnderstande, de eo. 24 Fac periculū in palestra, Proue him in wras∣linge. 24 Fac periculum in musicis. Proue him in sing∣inge and playinge on instrumentes. 27 Non sibi soli postulat te viuere. Hee dooth not desyre you to bestowe all your lyfe on him alone.
28 Non postulat sua causa excludi caeteros, Hee desireth not to haue al other shut out of doores for his sake. 29 Neque pugnas narat, neque cicatrices suas o∣stentat. Hee craeth not of the battels that hee hath be in, nor maketh no bost in shewing the scarres of the woundes that he hath had. 31 Vbi molestum non erit, When it shalbe no disease vnto you. 31 Vbi tu voles, When it shalbe your wil. 32 Vbi it tibi tempus, When you shal haue tyme or leysure. 32 Sat habet si tum recipitur, Hee is contented if he may come into your house, or he desyreth no more, but at such times to be receiued into your house or company. 33 Apparet seruum hunc esse domini pauperis. This fellow seemeth to be seruaunt vnto some poore man, or to hane some poore man to his mayster. 34 Nemo possit hunc perpeti. No man were able long to abyde or suffer this felow. 34 Sat scio, I knw very wel, 36 Te esse puto infra omnes infimos homines, I repute thee to bee the most villayne of all vil∣laynes. 37 Qui huic assentari animum induxeris, That couldest finde in thy harte to flatter such a fel∣low as this is Valla. lib. 5. Eleg. cap. 66. shew∣eth the difference betweene these three verbes, assentor; adûlor and blandior. Assentari, is to flatter any body, affyrming his sayinges, and
vpholding his yea and his nay, or praising him to much, or els many tymes otherwyse then the truth is, to the ende to get some profite and ad∣uauntage thereby, & it is properly in wordes. And therefore this kinde of flattery, called As∣sentation, is not in any brute beast, but onely in man. Plaut. Extempló, quasi res cum ea esset mihi, coepi assétari, mulier quicquid dixerat, idē ego dicebam. Anone, as though I had had to doe with her, I began to sooth her, and to hold her vp with yea and nay, and whatsoeuer shee sayde, I sayd the same. Idem. Assentandum est quicquid hic mēietur. whatsoeuer lye this fo∣lowe shall make, wee must sooth or vpholde it, and say as he doth Terence himselfe in y• secōd Scene of the second Acte of this same Como∣dye, doth best of all declare the nature of this verbe Assentor, aris: where Gnato sayeth thus: Hos confector, hisce ego non paro me vt ride∣ant, sed his vltiò arrideo, & eorum ingenia ad∣miror simul: quicquid dicunt, laudo, id rur∣sum si negant, laudo, id quoque. Negat quis, nego, ait, aio. Postremò imperaui egomet mihi omnia assentari, is quastus nunc est mul∣to vberrimus, such menne doe I follow at the tayle, or at the hard Heeles, or the Elbow (for that is consectari) and among such persous I doe not so fashiō my selfe, that they may laugh at mee, but contrartwyse, whatsoeuer they sey or doe, I shewe them a mery countenaunce of myne owne selfe, and also make a great mar∣ueyling at their high wils, Whatsoeuer they
say, I commend it, and if they denye the same agayne, that also I commend, if a man say nay, I say nay also: if he say yea. I say yea to. And for a conclusion to be short, I mayster, & rule mine owne selfe, to vphold his yea and his nay, & to sooth him and to say as he sayth in all manner thinges, for that is the next way now a dayes to get money ynough. Adûlari is to flatter an other man in hūblinge himselfe, and beyng seruiseable about him, and to labour by such fashions to winne and get his fauour, whether it be by voyce, & wordes, or els by gesture of the body, or by any other way, or meane, whatsoeuer it bee. Nonius Marcel. sayth thus: Adulatio est proprié canum blandi∣mentum quod ad homines consuetudine tran∣slatum est, Adulation properly signifyeth the fauning and raping of Degs vpon their mai∣sters, from which property by translation it is applyed onely to men by vse of speakinge, and not by the proper signification of the word. Where note, that Adûlor is a verbe deponent and gouerneth a Datiue case. Valer Max Dio∣genes Syracusis, cum olera ei lauanti Auistippus dixisset. Si Dionysio adulari velles, ista non esses: Im inquit, si tu ista esse velles, Dio∣nysio non adûlaris, Diogenes in the Citty of Sarragous (when that Aristippus had sayd vn∣to hym, as he was washinge herbes for a Sa∣lette these wordes. If thou wouldest seeke fa∣uoure of Dyonisius the tyraunt, and flatter hym, thou shouldest not eate such meate as
that) he aunswereth and sayd agayne: Nay it thou wouldest eate such meate as this, thou shouldest not neede to flatter Dyonysius. Yet Cornelius Tacitus ioyned the same verbe de∣ponent with an accusatine saying, Tigillinum aut quem alium adulatus est. He flattered Tigil linus or sum other man. There is also read Adulo, as, aui, are, an actiue, or transtyue go∣uerning an Accusatiue case. Ci. li. 2. Tus. quest. where hee transateth certayne verses out of a Tragedie of the Greke Poete Aeschilus, spea∣king in the person of Prometheus of the Egle that ed on his liuer: Tum iecore opimo fara & satiata affatim, clangorem fundit vastum, & sublime aduolens, pinnata cauda nostum adû∣lat sanguinem Then she beyng stuffed and satis∣fied, euen at full with as much as shee woulde eate of my fatte liuer, gaue an horrible shrike & taking her flight high vp into the ayre, with her forked & stiffe fethred taile houered playing and dalying at my blood. Albeyt the dictiona∣ryes take adulat there, for lambit or bibit, as who shoulde say in Englishe, shee sweeted her lippes, licking and sucking vp my bloud. And Cic. lib. 1. off. vseth the passiue of the same, Ca∣uendum est, ne assentatoribus patefaciamus au∣res neue adulari nos sinamus. We must beware that we open not our eares to flatterers, nor suffer our selues to be won, or ouercōmed with fauninge, or humble behauioure of others to¦wardes vs. For there Cicero doth manifestlye put a difference betweene assentatiō and adula∣tion
The Poet Lucrecius, vsed Audûlo, as, aui, as a verbe neuter absolutely, that is to say, not ioyning any case with him in that verse: Longe alio pacto gannitu vocis adûlant. And Linacre in the place of Val. Max. aboue cited readeth thus. Diogenes Saracusis, cum olera ei lauaoti Aristippus dixisset. Si Dionysic adulari velles, ista non esses: Imò inquit, si tu Dionysium non adulares, illa non esses: But I find not the lat∣ter in any examplary yt I haue hetherto seene, but the commentaries reade, Si Dionysio non adulares, that it be a verbe neutre, gouerning a Datiue, where Oliuerus noteth yt many verbes be neuters in o, and deponents in or, and of the same signification, as populo and populor, im∣pertio impertior, adûlo and adûlor. &c. Bandiri belongeth properly to touching and hādling, and by vnproper vsing, it is by a Me∣taphore trāslated and referred to other partes of the body, yea and many tymes to the mynde. Exemplorum plena sunt omnia. 39 Iàm ne imus? Shall wee goe nowe? 39 Hos priùs introducam, & quae volo simul im∣perabo, I will first haue in these folkes, and geue in commaundement such thinges as I would haue done. 40 Posteà continuò exeo, That done I wil come foorth by and by. For in such maner of spea∣kinges as this, and Iámne imus? afore, and Ego hinc abeo, next folowing, with others like where as the property of our Englishe tongue is to speake by the signe of the future tense, shal
or will, the phrase of the Latine tongue, is to speake by the present tense. 41 Ego hinc abeo, I will be gone hence. 43 Quid tibi ego multa dicam? What should I make many woordes with thee? 43 Domini similis est. Such mayster such man. Some grammarians haue noted, that Similis gouerning a Datiue case, betokeneth lyke in fauor, shape, eacture of body, or in Apparell, and Similis with a Genitiue after him, lyke of conditions, behauiour or qualities of y• minds only, but that is no difference: for we reade in Cicero. Vt similia sunt, & oua ouorum & apes apum. Plau in Menech. Nec aqua aquae, nec lae lacti (crede mihi) vsquàm similius, quam hic tui est tuq́ue huius. &c. 44 Quid rides? Whereat laughest thou? 46 Praecurre, vt sint domi parata omnia, Runne afore, that all thinges may be ready at home. 47 Diligenter fac cures. See thon bestyrre thee bustly. 48 Si Chremes hue forté venerit, ores vt maneat, It peraduenture Chremes shall come hyther, desyre him to tary. 49 Si id non commodum est, ores vt redeat, It hee may not conueniently so doe, pray hym to come agayne. 50 Si id non poterit, ad me adducito, It he may not doe that neyther, bring him to mee. 53 Domi adsitis facire, See that you keepe home or see that you keepe you within the house. 54 Vos me sequimini, Come you after mee.
In the third Scene. 1 Quantò magis, magisqúe cogito, The more and more that I cast in my mynd, or be thinke me. 2 Dabit mihi magnum malum, He wil doe mee a great shrewd turne. 4 Cum primū iussit me ad se accersi, Whē he first commaunded me to be sent for vnto him. 5 Quid tibi cum illas. Est negotij vel rei, per E∣clipsin, What hast thou to do with her? 5 Ne nôram quidem, In fayth I could not haue tolde. 6 Vbi veni, causam, vt tibi manerem repperit, When I was once come, hee found an excuse or occasion to make, me tary there. 7 Ait rem seriam velle agere mecum, Hee sayde he would commune with me of a sed & weightye matter. 8 Iam tum erat suspitio, dolo malo haec fieri om∣nia, Euen very than I mistrusted already, that all togeather shoulde bee done by fraude and collusion Dolus (sayth Donat) à dolendo, be∣cause it maketh men sory, when they are beguy∣led vel a dolendo, that is hurting or dimini∣shing, for  in Greeke, is Laesio in latine hurting in English, and therof it is taken for all maner guyle, and decept, or trumpery. Do∣li vocabulo (saith Nonnius Mar.) nunc tantūm in malis vtimur, antiqui autem etiam in bo∣nis rebus vebantur, vndè adhuc dicimus sine dolo malo, nimirum quia solebant dici & bo∣nus., and for his authoritye and example hee
citeth this place of Terence, so that dolus is al manner of deceipt, and dolus malus is that, that we vse to say in cglish, craft and coliusion. Reade De dolo malo, in the thirde booke of Cic. De offic. where amonge other thinges hee sayth thus. Nondum enim Aquilius collega & familiaris meus partulerat de dolo malo formu∣las. In quibus ipsis eum: ex eo quaereretur quid esset dolus malus, respondebat, cum esset aliud simulatum, aliud actum. For my fellow in office and familiar frende Aquilius had not made and established the foure of the wryttes yet of Dolo malo, In which writtes when it was demaunded of hym, what was Dolus ma∣lus, hee made, aunswere, and sayd that Dolus malus was when one thing was pretended and outwardly shewed, and an other thinge done & executed in deede. 8 Ipse accumbere mecum. i. accumbebat. Hee sate herde by me at the table 9 Mihi sese dare for dabar, He gaue attendaunce on me, to doe what I would haue him to doe. 9 Sermonem quaerere i. quaerebat He went about to finde communication. Sermonem. i. sermonis mareiam & causas. 11 Quam pridem pater mihi & mater mortui es∣sent. s. rogabat, He asked me how long agone my father and my mother dyed. 14 Sperat se id a me auellere, He hopeth to put it away from mee. 17 Haec cur quaeriet? Why should he require such thinges?
0 Ea si viuit annos nata est sedecim, non maior, It shee be alyue, shee is sixtene yeares old, and no elder. 1 Thais, ego quàm sum maiuscula est, Thais ys somewhat elder then I am. 22 Misit orare vt venirem serio, Hee sent one to pray me to come for a sad and weighty matter. 23 Aut dieat quod vult, aut molestus ne fiet. Ey∣ther let him tel me what he would haue, or else, let him not trouble, or disquet me. 24 Non hercle veniam tertio, In fayth I will not come the third tyme 24 Hic quis est? Who is there▪ Ego sum Chremes. It is I Chremes. 25 O capitulum lepidissimum, O litle petite feare gospol Albeit it is the figure Synecdoche that is to say, part of the whole, set for the whose ca∣pitulum for hominem 27 Rus eo, I goe into the countrey. 28 Apud no hic mane dum redeat ipsa, Carye here with vs vntil she come her selfe. 29 Nihil minus, no poynt so. 30 Si istuc ita certum est tibi, If you be viterly de¦termined and appoynted on that. 31 Illuc transi, vbi illa est, Goe thether where she is. In the fourth Scene. 1 Heri aliquot adolescentuli coimus, Yester daye three or foure young men of vs met togeather. 2 Chaeream ei rei praefecimus, We made Cheres the chefe captayne and doer in that matter. Here Terence spake of a promise that was
made for to meete together, and to make good cheere, so that in this place & meaning, it might cōuentently be englished, we made Cherea ou steward and mayster of the feast. 3 Locus, tempus constitutum est, The place and tyme was appoynted. 4 Praeterijt tempus, The tyme or houre is past. 4 Quo in loco dictum est, paati nihil est, In the place that was named is nothing ordayned. 5 Neque scio quid dicam, aut quid coniectem. And I cannot tell what I may say or what I may coniect, or thinke. 6 Mihi hoc negotij caeteri dedêre, illum, vt quae∣ram, The rest of the company haue put mee to this laboure, or hath assygned me this office to goe seeke him. 7 Visam si domi est, I will goe see if hee be at home. 7 Quisnam hinc à Thaide exit? Who commeth foorth from Thais house here? Quisnam for quis: It is called Parelcon, that is, when a let∣ter, or syllable is added, which maketh, or hel∣peth nothing to the sense. 8 Is est? an non est? Is it he, or is it not? 8 Quid hoc hominis? i. qui hic homo est? What maner of felow is this, or what maner a felow haue we here? 8 Qui hic ornatus est? what maner apparayle cal you this? 9 Nequeo satis mirari, neque conijcere, I can not leaue maruayling, nor perfectly contect. 10 Libet sciseitari, I haue a phantaste to enquire
or, I haue a great desire to aske. Sciscitor, a▪ tis. &c. is to ase, to the ende for to knowe a thing, as the voyce it selfe sheweth, for it is de∣iued of seio. Pcōtari, properly to aske, to the ende to reproue a man, & to take him in a tri. Inteogare, is also to aske, to thende to know: Albeit, it is indifferently vsed for Perontor, to appose a man (as wee say.) In the fifth Scene. Nùm quis hic est? Is there any body heere? Nemo homo est. Ther is no man. Heere note that Homo is elegantly somtimes ioyned with nemo, notwithstanding that nemo is the same, that nullus homo, reade examples in Hadr de Serm: lat. ámoe erópere hoc mihi licet gaudium? May I now out with this my ioy and gladnesse? Proh Iupiter. O Lorde. None est, interfici cùm perpeti me possum, ne hoc gaudium contaminet vita aegritudine ali∣qua. Now at this present tyme so it is, that I coulde be content to dy, that life might not here after distegne this gladnes that I am in, by any misfortune, displeasure or sorrowe. 9 Ab eo gratiam hanc inibo, I wyll get or haue that thanke of him. 10 Quid est quod fic gestis? What is the matter that you leape and skippe so? that you fet such gambauldes? Gestire (sayth Donat) is to no∣tifie, what the minde thinketh or desreh by the mouing and gesture of the body. And it is ma∣nifest, sayth hee, that it is by translation taken
of the property of bruite beastes, and referr to man. And it may be referred as well to sor∣row as to gladnes, or to anye other affectione appetite or passion of the mynde. 10 Quid sibi hic vestitus quaerit? What meaneth this apparayle? 11 Quid est quod laetus sis? What is the matter why thou shouldest be so glad? 11 Quid me aspectas? Why stādest thou gasing vpon me? or, why starest thou vpon me? 12 O festus dies, O a highe and mery day. 12 Amice salue, Good fellowe God saue you, or, O louing friende, God rest you mery. 13 Nemo est, quem ego magis nunc cuperem vi∣dere, quam te, There is no man lyuing, whom I would more gladly see nowe at this present tyme then thee. 14 Narra istuc quaeso, quid siet, I pray thee tell what the matter is: siet, for sit, per Epenthesin. Epenthesis is whē a letter or syllable is added into the middes of a woorde. 14 Imò, ego to obsecro, vt audias, Nay mary, I pray you that you will heare it. 15 Nostin 'hanc, quam amat frater? Doe you not know her heere, yt my brother is in loue withal. 18 Elegans spector formarum, Very well skilled or seene in fayre women, or, a deinty fellowe in chosing of fayre women. For so doth Donatus expounde it. 20 Quid multa verba? sloquar, What should I make many woordes? 20 Forte fortuna domi erat, As happe was he
was at home, Haec fors sayth Nonius Marc,  fors ab hac forte, is properly a chaunce that so∣daynly & casuallye falleth or hapneth at a time and Fortuna is the goddes her selfe that is the Fortune that euery persō hath geuen vnto him that such or such thinges shall happen to hym, or go from him. Actius in astianactè: Itera in quibus partibus, namque audire volo, si est quē exopto, & quo captus modo, fortuna ne an fortē reperitur, Tel and reherse agayn in what par∣tyes, for I would fayne heare whether it be he that I desyre to see, or not, and how he was gotten, and whether he was found by Fortune, or els, by chaunce and casualty. Idem in An∣dro. Multi, quibus natura praua magis quàm fors aut fortuna obfuit, Many vnto whom the frowardnes of theyr naughty nature hath done more harme thē hath eyther chaūce or Fortune. Lucil. in Saty.. Cui parilem fortuna locum, fa∣tum{que} tulit fors. Vnto whom his fortune gaue like place & degree, or state of liuing, & chaunce gaue desteny of death semblablye & aunswera∣ble to the same. Ibid. Aut forte omninò, aut for∣tuua vincere bello eyther by blynd chaunce, or else by fortune to get the victory in battayle, Many times fors fortuna and forte fortuna, are ioyned together by suboon, as saith Donat in the third Scene of the thirde Act of Hecyra: and then it betokenneth bone aduenture, or so∣dayne good chaunce & good Fortune. Terent. in Phor. O Fortuna, O Fortuna, quantis com∣moditatibus Antipho hunc oneâsis dem?
Oh Fortune, oh most good Fortune, with h many commodityes, & good chaunces hast th replenished this day to Antypho? Vbi Don Fortuna dicta est incerta res, fors fortuna euen tus fortunae bonus, Fortune is called  thing vncertaine Fors fortuna is a good chaunce,  end of that thing that was vncertayne. And a∣gayne in the same place Fortuna and fors For∣tuna be two contrary thinges, for fors fortuna is the goddesse whom they serue, and hauyng no occupation, whereby to get their liuinge whose temple was on the farside of Tiberis,  that Fortuna is vncertayne, and fors fortuna is in good chaunce. And therof Forte fortuna sometyme as a noune, and sometyme as an ad∣uerbe, is that that wee say in English, in a good houre: or as good hap was, 22 Submonuit me Parmeno, Parmeno put m in mynd by a bye worde. 23 Tacitus, citiùs audies, Holding your peace you shal heare it the sooner. 24 Vt vestem acum eo mutem, That I shoulde chaunge garmentes with him. 25 Quid ex ea re capies commodi? What bene∣fite shalt thou get by that thing? 27 Nùm parua causa aut parua ratio est, Is that a small cause, or a s consideration? 30 Mihi, ne absedam, imperat▪ He charged me not to goe away. 32 Ego ad caenam hinc eo, I goe encefoorth to supper. 35 In conclaui sedet, He sitteth in the parlour.
36 Iouem Danae misisse aiunt quondam in gre∣mium imbrem aureum. They say that Iupiter did on a time let fall into the lappe of Danae a shoure of droppes of Golde. 39 Impendiò magis animus gaudebat mihi. My heart was marueylous ioyfull and glad, styll more and more. Impendiò, aduerbium intendé∣di, is as much as impensè, valdè, apptimè, great or very much: and it is commonly ioy∣ned with the comparatiue degree. Aul. Gel. li. 1. cap. 2. Erat ibidèm nobiscum simul adoles∣cens, philosphiae sectator: disciplinae, vt ipse di∣cebat, stoicae, sed loquacior impendiò, & prōp∣tior. There was in the same place together in company with vs a young man, student in phi∣losophy, and (as he sayd him selfe) of the secte of the Stoikes, but very talkatiue, too too ful of woordes, and marueilous ready thereto. And therefore it is read elegātly ioyned with magis. Cic. Atti. At ille impenpiò magis odit senatū. But hee to to much hateth the Senatours, or the nobles of the city. And also with Minùs. Plau in Aulu. Atque ille minùs, minusq́ue im∣pendiò curare, minusq́ue me impertie hono∣ribus. But he set by me sll lesse and lesse, by a grat way, and did mee lesse honour, & shewed me lesse couteste, when it is put without ma∣gis, it is indifferently ioyned with the postie degree, or els with the comparatiue, as Impē∣diò verbosus, Very full of woordes, or Impē∣diò verbosior. 43 Homuncio hoc non facerem? Shoulde I a
fellow of no reputation, not do that? 43 Ego illud feci, ac lubens, I did that same and that with all my hart. 44 Dùm haec mecum reputo, Whyle I cast,  recounted these thinges in my hand, Puam instantia, reputamus praeterita. Donat. 44 Accersitur lauatum virgo, The mayden was called to go and wash her. 46 Sto expectā si quid mihi imperēt I stode  loked whether they would bid me do any thing. 47 Cape flabellum, & ventulum facito, Take  flabell, and make a litle wynde. Flabellum, a di∣minutiue of flabrum as labellum of labrum. 51 Foras simul omnes prorunt se, They rushed out of the dores altogether in a cluster▪ Abe lauatum. They went to wash them. 52 Perstrepuunt, ita vt fit domini vbi absunt. They made a rubbinge in euerye corner, that all the house was to litle for them, as commonlye it chaunceth, when the mayster or dame is out of the way. 53 Interea somnus virginem opprimit, In the meane whyle sleepe tooke the mayden, or, the mayden fel a sleepe. 55 Pessulum ostio obdo, I sparred or bolted the doore. Pessulus, li. i. paruus pes a diminutiue of the nouue pes, and it is a bolt, or such like in∣strumente, with which the doores bee shut fast on the insyde. Apuleius. Subdita claui pessules reduco, I put the key into the hoale, and pulled backe the bolt, Plau. in Aul. Occlude fores am∣bobus
pessulis, iam ego hic adero Shutte fas the dore with both the boltes, I wil bee here a∣gayne by and by. 56 An ego occasionem mihi ostētatam tam bre∣uem, tam optatam, tam insperatam amitterem? Should I haue let go such oportunity & occa∣sion beyng offered me so short of tyme and res∣pite, so greatly desyred, so sodayne and nothing looked for? 59 Sane hercle vt dicis, In good sooth as you say. 59 Interim de symbolis quid actum est. In the meane season, what is done with our banket money. Symbolum. li. of the neuter gender, is the money that diuers persons lay togeather, as in a common purse make good cheere with∣all, and such banques are called collations, a collatu, that is of laying togeather euerye one his portion. 60 Perlongè est sed tantò ocyùs properemus. It is very farre hence, but let vs make so much the more speede. 63 Domo exulo, I am banished from our house as who should say, I dare not goe thither, nor come there, 63 Metuo fratrē ne intus sit. I feare my brother least he be within. 64 Metuo patrem ne rure redierit, I feare my father least hee be come out of the countrye a∣gayne. Where note that the Accusatiue fratrem & patrem, bee set for the Nominatiues, by the figure Antiptosis.
65 Eamus ad me, ibi proximum vbi mntes. s. ve∣stem Goe we home to my house, there is the niest place where you may chaunge you. 67 Consilium volo capere vna tecum, I wil take counsayle with you, and see what is best to bee done. Out of the fourth Acte in the first Scene. 2 Timeo, ne quam ille hodie turbam faciat. I feare least that fellow will make some busines & trouble to day. 6 Id faciebat retinendi illius causa, He did it for to keepe that other man there. 7 Ad eam rem tempus non erat, There was no tyme for that. 10 Heús puer Pamphilam accerse, Hoe, thou lad goe call Pamphila. 11 Minimè gentium, No, in no wyse in the world Minimè gentium (sayth Festus) dicebât vete∣res pro eo quod est, omnium gentium iudicio minimè faciendum, the Laten men of old tyme did vse and take these woordes Minime gentiū as who should say thus, a thing as al the peo∣ple in the worlde woulde iudge in no manner wyse to bee done. So that Minime gentium (as testifyeth Valla in anno contra Rau) is ta∣ken for Minime and gentium is a voyce either emphaticos, or els as an expleiue added festi∣uitatis gratia, to these Aduerbes that follow, Minimè, Ter. in Ade. Ge. Quapropter quoquo pacto caelato opus est. Sosta, Ah minimè gti∣um non faciā. Get. Wherefore in any wise it is
expediēt, that it be kept secret. Sostrat. Tushe nay in no wise, I will not so do. Quo, Plaut, in Rud. Nòn hercle quò hinc nunc gentium au∣fugiam, scio. By my truth I wot not whither in the worlde to goe now from hence. Quando, Plau in Amp. Amph. Quis te misit furcifer? Sos qui me rogat? Amphit. Quādo gentium Amph Who sent the knaue, Sos. Who sayth who? Amph. Whan? Longe. Cic. Atti. li. 6. Non quò me aliud iuuare posses, quippe res est in mani∣bus tu autem abes lōge gentium. Not that you coulde doe me any helpe. For the matter is all ready in hande, & you are distant a greate way from mee. And also with these aduerbs. Nusquàm, vnde∣cun{que}, vbinam, vbîuis, vbîque, vbî with al other their compoūds, as sicubi &c. where note that with these last rehersed, is read ioyned not only gentium, but also terrarum and locorum, and with vbi is also ioyned smetimes the voyce of the genitiue singuler, loci. per subunionem, Plau, in Cap. Prope modùm vbi loci tuae fortu∣nae sunt facilè intelligis, thou perceiuest verye well in maner, in what case or state thou and al that euer thou hast, do stād. Idem in mer. Nam si isthuc ius est, saenecta aetate scortari senes, vbi loci res summa nostra publica? For if this bee leefull that old folke in their olde age may vse the company of Harlots, then where is our great high commune weale become? And in all these ye cōpoūds signify no more thā ye simples. 12 Vbi primùm poterit se illinc subducet, sat
scio As sone as he may possibly he wil priuely steale away from thence, I know very wel. In the second Scene. 1 Dum rus eo, As I was going into the coun∣trey. 2 Vbi quid in animo est molestiae, Whan there is any griefe in the hart, or, when there is anye griefe the hart, or when there is any grudge in the stomacke. 3 Caepi mecum inter vias, aliam rem ex alia cogi∣tare. By the way as I went I began to cast in my mynd, and to remember one thinge after an other. 4 Dum haec reputo, praeterij imprudens villam. Whyle I recounted these thinges in my mynde I was gone past my house in the countrey. Villa properlye is a ferme house, or, a manour house, or any other house made and set without the City to dwel in, and to haue husbandry oc∣cupied, deriued as Varro Li▪ 1▪ de re rust. Cap. 2. sayth a vehendo of carying: for that the husbād∣man carieth in thither such fruits as come out of the ground: and semblably caryeth them out agayne, when they must bee solde. In Villa, most commonly are twoo partes, the one that the Farmer, or hynd, or whatsoeuer person els, (occupying the husbandrye, belonging vnto the same) dwelleth in, and there maketh, or, kee∣peth all manner instrumentes appertayning to husbandrye, as corne, cartes, yokes for exē &c. and that was called by the latine men of olde tyme Villa rustica. The other part is that which the Lorde, or, owner reserueth and kepeth for
himselfe to dwel in for his pleasure, and that was called Villa vrbana, because it was in all poyntes as goodly, and as well appoynted, as becommeth a house standing within the citty to bee (and was more pleasauntlye builded, and more goodly decked and better furnished with all implementes of housholde, and kept more nete and cleane, then for a house of the country. Varro. li. de re rust. Fructuosior certè fundus est propter aedificia si potius ad antiquorum dili∣gentiam, quam ad horum luxuriam dirigas ae∣dificationē. Illi enim ad fructū rationem facie∣bant, hi ad libidines indomitas. Itaque illorum villae rusticae erant maiores, quam vrbanae, quae nunc sunt pleraeque. Of a verye certayntye a mans ground is the more fruitfull and profi∣table for the housing that is builded vppon it, yf a man order and fashion the buildinge and framing and setting vp of it after the diligent fashion of men of old tyme, rather then after the prodigall excessiue and ouer sumptuous fa∣shion of men that are now a dayes. For the men of olde tyme made their buildinges in the coū∣try, as was most conuenient for the fruites of the ground to bee receiued thereinto, and now a dayes they build for pleasure, that is neuer ruled by any reason, nor neuer satisfied, therfore their Villae rusticae were bigger and larger thē manye Villae vrbanae that are now a dayes. 5 Longè iam abieram, I was already gone beyond it a great way. 5 Cum sensi, redeo rursum, when I perceyued
it. I came back agayne. 7 Vbi vei ad diuerticulum, constiti, when I came to the place where the way turneth in, I stoode still. 8 Occepi mecum cogitare, I began to thinke in my mynd. 8 Biduum hic manendum est. I must abyde here by the space of two dayes. 9 Quid tum posten? What then? 10 Si non tangendi copia est, eho ne videndi qui∣dem erit? If I may not haue leaue to touch it, what shall I not bee suffred to looke vppon it neyther? 10 Si illud non licet, saltem hoc licebit, If I may not do that, yet at least way this may I doe. 14 Timida subitò egreditur Pythias, Pythias be∣yng in feare commeth forth hastely. In the third scene. 1 Vbi ego illum scelerosum, atque impium inue∣niam? Where may I fynd that vngratious & wicked fellow? 4 Ludificatus est virginem. He beguyled the may∣den. Vestem omnem miserè discidit, He al to cut her cote, that pitty it was to see. 5 Ipsam capillo conscidit, Hee tore her by the hayre. 7 Vt ego vnguibus illi in oculos inuolē, Oh how I would flye on him with my nayles, & scratch out his eyes. 8 Nescio quid absente nobis turbatum est domi.
There hath bene some busines, or trouble, or there hath bene some shrewde turne done at home (whatsoeuer it is) whyle I haue bene a∣way forth. Here is (sayth Donat,) eyther Absēte sette for a Preposition, gouerning an ablatiue case, as when it is sayd, coram nobis, coram a∣micis, &c. or else, which I more allow, and thinke better sayde) the figure Archaismos, that is an imitation of speakinge of the olde tyme. For the antiquitye vsed absente nobis for absente me, or rbsentibus nobis. Plaut. in Amph. Si in actione hanc absente nobis inue∣nit puer. If the boy founde and tooke her with the manner in the deede doynge, whyle I was away, And lykewyse praeesente nobis for prae∣sentibus nobis. Plaut. in Amph. Nec nobis praesente aliquis nisi seruus Aphricanus adest, Neyther any man but the seruaunt that came out of Aphrique was here whyle I was pre∣sent. Ibidem. Nec nobis praesente quisquam aliquis ausi sunt And whyle I was present they durst not, not any one of them all. Pom. Qui apud forum paesente testibus mihi vendidit. Which solde it vnto mee openly in the streete before witnesse. Idem. Sine ergo isthue, praesente amicis inter scoenam, let this alone now, wee will speake more of it in the supper tyme when our frendes be present. Varro in Marcellum ex Donato. Id praesen∣te legatis omnibus exercitu pronunciabat, Hee spake that onely in the host, all the ambassa∣doures beyng there present,
8 Quid festinas, aut quem quaeris? Why hyest thou so fast, or whom seckest thou for? 9 Abi hinc quo dignus es cum donis tuis tam le∣pidis. I speede or il lucke take you for me with your giftes being so goodly and proper. 10 Quid ist huc est rei? What is the matter? 11 Quas turbas dedit? What trouble, or what aray, hath hee made? 12 Virginem vitiauit, he hath defloured a maidē. 13 Temulentus es? Thou art drunken. 13 Vtinàm sic sint, qui mihi malè volunt, would God myne euill willers were in that case. 14 Quidnam istuc monstri fuit? What a mon∣ster was that, what monstrum is, it is shewed afore. 15 Ego illum nescio qui fuerit. I know him not what hee was. 16 Hoc quod fecit res ipsa indicat, thys that hee hath done, the thing it selfe doth playnly shew. 18 Ille-bonus vir nusquam apparet, That honest man cannot bee seene. 19 Suspicor aliquid domo abeuntem abstulisse I mistrust that he stol & tooke away some what, when he went out of the house. 19 Nequeo mirari satis, quò ille abire ignauus possit longiùs, nisi si domum fortè ad nos redi∣erit, I cannot meruayle enough whyther that luske could go farre, except if peraduenture he be gone home agayne to our house. 21 Vise amâbo nùm ibi sit, go see as euer I shall loue you, or, as euer I shall do you good turne whether he be there. Amâbo, is after some an
aduerbe of exhorting, or after some other an in teriection of flattering and louinge, and it is the same that we say in englishe, as euer I shal doe you good turne, or pleasure, or as euer I shall loue you. Plaut. Noli amâbo Amphitrio irasci Sosiae causa mea, as euer I shal loue you Amphitrio, bee not angry with Sosta, for my sake. And it is indifferently referred to one sin∣guler, or els to many. Idem in Truc. Propera∣te, mensam afferte amâbo. He at once & bring the table I pray you. Oratours vse in the same signification, also amâbo te, & amamè. Ci. Cas∣sio. Et amâbo te, cum dabis post hàc aliquid do∣mū literarum, mei memineris. And as euer I shall loue you, whan you shall from henceforth send any letter home, remember me. Id. Attic. Amâbo te incūbe in eam rem, & ad me scribe. As euer I shall owe you my harty loue, sticke well to that matter, and write vnto me. Eidem Amamè, non libenter lidi, sed modò succenset, modò gratias agit? As euer you may trust or loue mee, I sawe it not gladly, but some∣whyle hee is angry, and somewhyle hee geueth thankes. See more examples in Hadrian, de. ser. lati. Linacre saith that Amâbo and a∣mabò te, is Enallage, that is a verbe, (sayth he) or a whole sense for an aduerbe. For Enallage is when one part of spech is put for an other. And amâbo hath not the second sillable short▪ as Calepine and Thesaurus lin. la. and others would haue it▪ setting acutum accētum in pri∣ma, but lōg as Cat. Amâbo mea dulcis Ipsiphil
la Martial: li. 8. Di verum mihi Marce dic amâ¦bo, Sidonius ad Faeli. Dic quod peto Magne, dic amâbo. That no man be deceyued in accenting that worde. 22 Tam infandum facinus ne audiui quidem, So 2 abhominable a deede I haue neuer hard of, 23 Pol ego amatores audieram esse mulierum eo maximos, In deede I had herd say that they were the greatest louers of women that be. 25 Illum aliquò conclusissem. I would haue shut him vp fast in some corner. In the fourth Scene. 1 Exi foràs sceleste. Come forth thou naughty packe. 1 At etiam restitas? What, dost thou stop, and draw backe stl. 2 Prodi fugitiue. Come forth thou runnaway. 3 Illuc vide os vt sibi distorsit carnifex, iscelestus? See yond how the slouen knaue maketh awrye mouth? 4 Quid huc reditio est? Wherrfore art thou come hether agayne? 5 Si paululum cessassem, domi non offendissem. If I had taryed a litle longer, I shoulde not haue found him at home. 6 Iam ornabat fugā, He was euen about to runne away. 7 Habesné hominem amâbo? Haue you gotten the field I pray you? 10 Hunc oculis suis nostrum nunquam quisquam vidit. Not one of vs euer set hys eye on this fellow.
An tu hunc credidisti esse obsecro? Did you thinke that it had bene this man, I pray you? Ne comparandus hic quidem ad illum est. Nay this fellow is not to be compared with him, or, this fellow is not to be likened to him. Ille erat honesta facie & liberali. He had a goodly and a wel fauoured face, or he was both fayre and wel fauoured. For that signifyeth li∣beralis sometyme ioyned with facies, as here, or with forma. Terenr in Andr. Et quia erat forma praeter caeteras honesta ac liberali, accedo ad pe∣dissequas, rogo quae sit, And because she was more goodly, and more fayre, and beautiful, thē any of the other, I came vnto the maidens, that wayted on her, and required what shec was. 5 Ita visus est dudum. So he seemed erewhile. 6 Varia veste exornatus fuit, he was trimmed in in gay apparel. Varia, id est, multiformi, versi∣eolori. 7 Nunc tibi videtur foedus, Now you thinke him foule and it fauoured, Foedum is that that is foule, ill fauoured, and loathsome to looke on. 8 Tace obsecro, Hold thy peace I pray thee. 8 Quasi vero paulùm intersiet for intersit, per e∣penthesin, As who sayth, there was but small difference betwene them, 9 Ad nos deductus hodie est adolescentulus quē tu vero videre velles, there was brought home to our house to day, such a younge man, as a man would be glad to seee, or such a younge
man, as a man would be the better in his ha to looke on. 21 Hic est vetus, vietus, veternosus, senex, colore mustelino, This is an old rusty theefe, rotten, and weake, vnlusty, and all to riueled, and as tawny coloured as a wesell. Vetus is old Plau. in Amphi. Veterem & anti∣quam rem, nouam ad vos proferam I wil shew you an old antique thing, burnished and made new agayne, or I wil shew you a newe thinge made of an olde. And sometyme (as witnes∣seth Donatus in this place of Terence) Vetus is referred to rebuking and reprouing. Terentius in prologo Andriae, Qui maleuoli veteris poetae maledictis respond eat. How hee may make answeare to the raylinge of that olde rusty Poet his aduersarie. Idem in prologo Heautont. Tum {quam} maleuolus vetus poeta di∣ctat repentè ad studium hunc se applicasse mu∣sicum. i. musarum, hoc est bonarum literarum. And further, whereas the enuyous old naughy poet allegeth that this man sodaynly applyed himselfe to the study of good letters. Idé in pro∣logo Phormi. Postquā poeta vetus, poetam non potest retrahere a studio &c. now y• the nauhty rotten Poet cannot withdraw this Poete Te∣rence from study Vietus Donate expoundeth mollis, flaccidusque, & flexibils corpore, Weake and lanke and mmer of body. Vietus sayth Fest. Pom. dicitur languidus, si∣ne vi, & naturalibus priuatus viribus. Weake faynt, or wearish, droupinge without ane
strength, or lacking natural strength. Cice. de senect. Sed tamen necesse fuit esse aliquod ex∣tremu, & tanquam in arborum baccis, terrae∣que frugibus maturirate tempestiua, quasi vietū & eaduum, {quam} ferendum est molliter sapienti. But yet it could not be chosen, but their should be some terme and end, and like as in the ber∣ryes of trees, and in the corne growing on the grounde, at what tyme they be through rype) as who should say, fayntnes, weaknes, and fay∣ling in strength, and to be ready to fal and to de∣cay in strength, and being mortall which a wise man ought to take paciently. So the vieatum is weake, limmer, faint, & without any strength and therof commeth vimina and vimenta ofters that is the limber twigges of willow, that the unneylers, or, Cowpers occupy about theyr houpes, with which they bynd theyr tubbes, or barelles. And vier is to bynd tubbes, or bar∣rels, or other vessels with such twigges. And victor is the coper that doth make and bynde them. Veternosus properly is hee that hath the diseasè which is called in Latine veternus in greeke  of Auicen,  and Phisitions subetum or subetium, that is a disease ingen∣dring in the body continuall desyre of sleepinge by reason of to much denes, and ease, other∣wyse called sluggardye, slouthfulnes. Which disease because it is most cōmonly in aged per∣sons, therefore veternosus is match taken and vsed for him that is diseased with sleepnes
or as they say) drousines, so that he hath no  to bestirre him, but rather to sit stil as  with continual slumberyng and sleeepe. for Veternus is taken for vnmeasurable,  ouermuch sleepe. Pli. li. 8. natur. histor. speaking of beares, Pri∣mis diebus bis septenis iam graui somno  premuntur, vt ne vulneribus quidem  queant, tune mirum in modū veterno pinques∣cunt. The first fourteene dayes, Beares  oppressed with so heauy sleepe, hat they cannot be wakened and made to aryse though a man wound them right fore, and thē they waxe wō∣derfull fatte in that longe and continuall sleepe Cato taketh Veternosum, for one hauing the hydropsie, wher he sayth: Veternosus quàm plu∣rimū bibit, tam maximè siit, He that hath  hydropsie, the more he drinketh the more thirs he is Senex (in this place of Terence) is taken for rugosus withered and tueled. 22 Quae haec est fabula  What a tale, or sayinge haue we here? 23 Eo me redigis, vt quid egerim egomet nesciā. Thou bringest mee to that poynte that I can∣not tell myne owne selfe, what I haue done. 25 Venistin' hodie ad nos? Camest thou to our house to day? 26 At illic alterivenit annos natus sedecim. But that other came, being of the age of sixtene yeares. 27 Agedúm hoc mihi expedi. Come of, tell mee
this at ones: 28 Istam quam habes vnde habes vestem? This garment that thou hast on thee, where gottest thou it? or how camest thou by it? 30 Quam dudum? How long agone, or how litle whyle agone? 31 Quicum? with whom? 31 Noras ne eum prius? Diddest thou know him before? 33 Vnde igitur fratrem meū esse sciebas? Wher∣by then knowest thou, that hee was my bro∣ther? 34 Is dedit hanc vestem mihi, Hee gaue me this coate. 35 Vnà ambo abierunt foras, They went forth of doores both together. 36 Iam satis credis me nihil méritum? do you now beleue wel that I made no lye. 37 Certum est virginem vitiatam esse. Certayne it is and out of paraduenture, that the mayden is defloured or, hath lost her virginity, or  wee say in an english prouerbe, shee hath caught a a clap. 38 Credis huic quod dicat? Dost thou beleue such a one as this is, what he sayth? 38 Quid isti credam? What shoulde I beleeue this peeuish fellow? For iste most tymes beto∣keneth and importeth a certayne contempte. 38 Res ipsa indicat, The matter it selfe sheweth playnly.
39 Concede isthuc paululum, Go a litle that way, come a litle neere hither to me. For isthuc here is taken for huc. 40 Dic dum hoc rursum, Tel me this yet once  agayne. 42 Iupiter magne, o seelestum atque audacē ho∣minem, Good Lord, oh what a naughty, or vn∣gratious bold fellow is that? 43 Vae mihi, etiam nunc non credis indignis no esse irrisus modis? Alas, dost thou not yet be∣leeue, that we haue bene deluded and scorned shamefully and in vngodly mannet? 44 Mirum ni tu credis quod iste dicat, It is mer∣uayle, but you do beleeue that this peeuish fe∣low sayth. 45 Pessum ne hodie te exculpere verum. Shall not I be able to get out the truth of thee, ere I goe? Exculpere properlye is to graue out, or to carue, as a man carueth an image, and per me∣taphoram, it is taken sometymes pro extorque∣re, to extort, or to get out by vyolence, or punish∣mēt the truth, if any thing that a man desyreth to know. Plaut. Quot illi blanditias, quid pro∣misi boni, quot admoui fabricas & quot fallaci∣as in quaestione vix exculpsi vt diceret? With what fayre words did I hādle him, what faire & goodly promises did I make vnto him, how many wylie imaginations, and how many sub∣tiltyes, wherwith to be guyle him did I set and lay vnto him in examininge him, and yet I coulde vneath get out of him? to tell it for any
thing I could do vnto hym. Fabrica properlye is a forge, or frame of a carpenter or workman, of Fabricor, aris, to frame, and per metapho∣ram, to inuent, or to ymagine, and thereof Fa∣bricas here is taken for fallacias, and those two woordes signifie one thing, and the coniunctiō copulatiue & comming betwene them is taken for id est. 46 Non potest sine malo fateri, video, He cannot be made to confesse it without punishmente I see well. 47 Sequere me hac, come after me this waye here. 47 Modò ait, modò negat. Somewhyle he sayth yea, and somewhyle nay. 48 I intrò go thy wayes in 49 Honestè quo modo hinc abeam nescio. I can not tel how to get, or how to depart hence with myne honesty. 50 Tu me hic nebulo ludificabere? Shalt thou mocke mee here thou mocke? or, thou villayne shalt thou scorne and make a laughinge stocke of me here. 51 Parmenonis tàm scioesse hanc techuā, quam me viuere, I do as wel know that this is the crafty ymagination of Parmeno, as I knowe that I am alyue. Techne is a greeke word and pro∣perlye signifyeth anye craft, and by translation it is taken for craftye and subtil ymaginati∣ons Plautus. in Cap. Ego arumnatus, dear∣tuatus sum miser, scelesti hominis technis, qui me vt lubitum, est, ductauit dolis, I vnfortu∣nate
body am brought to misery and in manner pulled in peeces through the craftines & sub∣tiltie of this naughty felow which hath led me with his trappes and guiles euen as him li∣sted, Deartuare properly is to cut, or to hew in peeces one part or member from an other, as traytors be deartuati, when they bee quartered, 52 Inueniam hodie parem vbi referam gratiam. I wil ere I sleepe tynd some thing, whereinto requite him. 53 Quin nunc faciendum censes? What thinke you best to be done now? 54 Vtrum taceam an praedicem, Whether should I keepe it secret, or vtter it? 54 Tu pol si sapis, quod, scis nescis, Verely, if you be wyse, that that you knowe, you wil not know. 56 Hac re & re omni turba euolues, & illi gratum feceris, By this thing doyng, thou shalt both tidde, wynd, and quit thy selfe out of al trouble, and also do him greate pleasure. 57 Id modò dic abisse Dorum for abijsse per syn∣copen, Say thou nothing but this, Dorus is gone his way. 58 Cúm inde abeo, iam tum inceperat turba in∣ter eos. When I came my wayes from thence, they had alreadye begun to bee at strife and to make busines, and to quarell togeather. 59 Aufer aurum hoc, Haue away this gold. 59 Ego scibo ex hoc quid sciet, I will knowe of this man here, what the matter is.
¶ In the fift Scene. 1 Data verba mihi sunt, I am deceiued. 1 Vicit vinum quod bibi, The wine that I haue drunken, hath ouercommed me, as who should say, I feele my selfe drunken. 2 Dum accubabam, videbar mihi pulchrè sobrius Al the while that I sate at the table me thought I was very sober, and in very good temper. Pulchrè. i. valdè, oppidò, nimis, admodum. 3 Postquàm surrexi. ne{que} pes, nequè mēs satis su∣um officium facit. Now that I am vp, neither my feete, nor my wit serueth me very well. 4 Vah quantò nunc fomosior videre mihi quam dudum? Oh how much fayrer seeme you to me now, then you did whyle ere? 6 Verbum herclè hoc verum est, Certes this is a true sayinge. 7 An abijt iam? Is he gone already? 8 Lites sunt inter eos maximae, There is very great striefe and debate betwene them, Or they be at great woordes together, For that signi∣fieth properly lites, striuing in wordes. 9 Abiens mihi innuit, Whan he went away he becked on mee. 10 Nonnè id sat erat? Was not that enough? 10 Nesciebam id dicere illam, I knewe not that she meant that by her saying, or by her wordes that shee spake 11 Intellexi minùs, I vnderstoode it not. 11 Me extrusit foràs, Hee thruste mee out of the doores.
12 Miror vbi ego huic anteuerterim. I maruaill in what place I got before this man, that I sawe him not. In the sixt Scene. 1 Credo illum iam affuturum esse, I think vere∣ly that he will be here anone, 2 Si illam digito attigerit vno, oculi illico effo∣dientur▪ If he touche her with one finger, hys eyes shalbe pulled out of his head immediatly. Vno digito, a prouerbe read in Chil. Erasmi. 3 Ego illius ferre possum ineptias, & magnifica verba, verba, dum sint, I can very well beare and suffer his foolishenes and his royall high woordes, so longe as they bee nothinge but woordes. 4 Verùm enim si ad rem conferantur, vapulabit, But in fayth, if they turne to dedes, hee shall aby, or he shall smarte. Conferantur. 1. trans∣ferantur, conuertantur. s. verba And it is a pro∣per and elegant maner of speaking, sayth Do∣nat: as if a man should say in latin, He began to do as he sayde, he may say it properly in la∣tin thus. Verba ad rem contulit. i. id quod ver∣bis dixetat, te facere aggressus est. 5 Iamdudùm adsum. I am here and haue bene a good whyle. Dudùm & iamdudùm betoken and bee spoken of shorter time, as of one, or two, or three, or fower houres. Nupèr, pridèm, & iampridèm, of somewhat longer tyme, as of sixe monethes or yeres, or more or lesse, as the matter is. But dudùm and iamdudùm, pri∣dèm and iampridèm, haue this difference that
dudùm nupèr, and pridèm, doe signifie the ate of the verbe to be ended and past, and therfore they be most commōly and most elegantly ioy∣ned wyth verbes of pretertenses, as, ee went away a good whyle since, Dudùm abijt. Hee wrote vnto mee long agone of that matter. Ea de re pridèm ad me scripsit. He was in the city of late dayes, Fuit nupèr in vrbe. Iamdudùm and iampridèm, signifie the acte of a verbe, re∣mayninge and continuinge still, and therefore most vsually they bee ioyned with verbes of the present tense thus. The maister is in the schole, and hath bene a prety while, Iamdudùm praeceptor est in schola. Hee is a very greate frend of myne, and hath bene many a day. Iam∣pridèm est mihi amicissimus. Yet both these are much and ofte times reade ioyned wyth verbes of pretertences, and contrarywise, that others with verbes of the present ence, as she∣weth Laur. Vall lib. 2 eleg. cap. 34. 5 O mi Chreme, te ipsum expectaam▪ O sweete Chremes, I looked for you, and no man els. 6 Scin' tu turbam hanc propter te esse factam? Dost thou knowe or consider, that all this bu∣sines or trouble hath bene for thee? 6 Scin' ad te attinere hanc omnem rem? Doest thou remember, that all this matter pertey∣neth to thee, or toucheth thee, or lyeth thee vp∣pon? 7 Dum tibi sororem studeo reddere, & restituere, Whyle I goe about and labour to render, and
to restore to you your sister. 8 Haec atque huiusmodi multa passus sum, I haue suffred these thinges, and many other like or haue had this, or much other lyke trouble. 9 Est domi apud me, Hee is at home at my house. 11 Hoc tibi dono do, I geue this vnto you free∣ly. Dono dare, to geue freely. For dyuers verbs be construed and elegantly ioyned with a dou∣ble Dartue, of which one is set in manner ad∣uerbially, and much like an aduerbe, and yet is none. As thou hopest to haue laude and prayse for the same thinge, whiche thou layest vnto me as a fault, Speras id tibi laudi fore, quod mihi vitio vertis. Take thou no care, nor thought for the matter. Ne sit tibi curae. He hath layed his coate to pledge to mee De∣dit mihi vestem pignoti. He hath put put mo∣ney in my handes in the way of vsurye. Dedit mihi pecuniam foenori. Hee hath lente mee a groate. Dedit mihi mutuo dtachmam. Hee hath lente mee a gowne, Dedit mihi vestem commodato. And so here in Terence, Hanc tibi dono do▪ For hanc I put hoc, because it is more in vse, and more conuenient to bee spoken, For which cause. I chaunge almost euerye where in this booke the feminine gender, into the masculine, or neuter, as the place best ad∣mitteth. Caue neprius quam hoc a me accipias a∣mittas, Beware that you leese it not before you
receiue or haue it of mee. Cistellam domo effer cū monumentis. Bryng forth the litle coffer with the tokens. 18 Nùm formidolosus obsecro es? Arte thou feareful or false hearted, or doth thy heart faile thee man I pray thee? for (as Denate sayth) formidolosus is the same that terribilis, me∣tuendus, to be feared, and also timidus, feareful or false hearted. 19 Egon' formidolosus? Nemo est omnium qui metuat minùs. I false hearted? there is no man aliue that feareth lesse. 20 Quem tu me hominem, existimas? i. qualem. what maner of felow thinkest thou that I am. 21 Cogitato quicum res tibi est. Remember with whom thou hast to doe. Quicum. i. cum quo: For some prepositions are sometime contrary to ye nature of prepositions set after their case: as mecum, tecum, secum, nobiscum, vobiscum, and not cum me, te, se, nobis, vobis. The mat∣ter, whereof we communed yesterday, came no∣thing to passe, as I would haue it, Res qua de sumus hei collouti, minimè mihi cessit ex sententia. So ore tenus, Italiam versus, ad o∣riētem vs{que} quapropter. &c. And whereas quis hath the ablatiue both quo and qui, wee may indifferently say cum qui, and quicū, in all gen∣ders. Cic. Ser. Sulpit. lib. 4. epis. fami. Nemo est omnium, quicum potiùs mihi, quam tecum cō∣municandum putem. There is no man alyue, with whom I thinke I ought rather to com∣mune of myne affayres then with you.
And also plurally we say indifferētly cum quis bus and quibuscum, quicum, or cumqui. 21 Peregrinus est, minùs potens quam tu, minus notus, amicorum hic habens minus. Hee is a straunger here, and lesse may do then you, he is lesse acquaynted, and hath fewer frendes in these partes. 23 Quod cauere possis stultum est admittere. It is a foolishnes to suffer that ill to be done that a man may avoid. Admittere. i. fieri sinere sayth Donat, and cauere here I take for propellere & declinare. 24 Malo ego nos prospicere, quam hunc vlcisci accepta iniuria. I haue liefer, or I had rather that we prouyde for the matter afore, then to be reuenged on him after that wee haue had a shrewd turne. Prospicere here is taken for pro∣uidere, to foresee, and so to prouyde a remedy a∣gaynst ill that might els chaunce. Cic. de sen. Multi cum remissi ac liberi sunt, futura prospi∣ciunt. Many when they be at quet, and at li∣berty, they foresee thinges, that shal follow, or come after. Idem ser. Sulp. Tanquam ex aliqua specula prospexitempestatem futuram, I foresawe the tempest that shoulde follow as though I had bene in some high place to see euery way round. For that signifyeth properly specula, whether it be a hyll, or a towre, or a rocke, or a stone, or a tree, or els what: beyng of such heyght, that one may see farre euery way round about.
25 Tu abi atque ostium obsera intùs. Goe thou & locke the dore on the insyde. 25 Ego hinc transcurro ad forum, I wil runne, or make a start from hence into the streete.

Hee whom I goe about to make mine aduocate, or man of lawe, or defender of my cause, or my spokesmā, himselfe hath nede of one to defend hym Patronus is he that defen∣deth another man beyng in trouble or peril. In the senenth Scene. 1 Hāin ego contumeliam tam insignem in me accipiam. Should I suffer such a notable, or shameful despyte to be done vnto mee? hic haee insignis, & hoc insigne, is that this is very no∣table, whether it be in good, or in yll, as we say insignis virtute, and insignis flagitijs.
2 Moi me satius est. I were better be deade. 4 Malè mulctabo ipsum. I will punishe hym sharply. Mulctabo. i. puniam here, for mulctare properly is for to punishe by the purse. Imperatoris virtutem noueram & vim militū. I knew the manlinesse, or valpauntnesse of the Capytayne, and the strength or power of hys souldiours. Noueram sine sanguine hoc fieri non posse, I knewe well that this could neuer bee done, or ended without bloudshed. 10 Solus Sannio seruat domum. No man but Sannio keepeth the house. 11 Omnibus signum dabo. I will geue vnto all the compainy a token of knowledge when they shall begin. 12 Illuc est sapere, That is one poyncte of wise∣dome. 12 Vt hosce instruxit, ipse sibi cauit loco. After that hee had set the others in array, hee proui∣ded for him selfe to stand in a fure place, out of all perill and daunger. 13 Idem hoc Pyrrhus factitauit. The very selfe same thing vsed Pyrthus to doe. 13 Viden'tu, quam hic. rem agit? Dost thou see, where aboute this fellowe goeth? 14 Nim irum consilium illud rectum est, de occlu dendis aedibus. Certes that is right good coū∣sayle, that I gaue you, to shutte in your doores agaynst him. 15 Hic nebulo magnus est, This is a great lub∣berly knaue.

What a great matter it is to haue perfect wisedome? quanti est. i. quam magna res est. 21 Nunquam accedo, quin abs te abeam doctior. i prudentior, I neuer come vnto you, but that I part from you wiser then I came. 22 Primùm hoc mihi responde, First anuswere me to this. 26 Quid cum illo agas?

Thou con∣ueyghedst thy selfe away, or, thou stolest away priuely out of my company, aud wentest with him Subduxti for Subduxisti, per Syocopē. And clam here is an aduerbe. For boyses of prepo∣sitions when they gouerne no case, are chaun∣ged alwayes into aduerbes. Libuit s. mihi. It was my pleasure. 27 Pamphilam hùc redde, nisi vi mauis ripi, Restore mee hether Pamphila with good
will, except thou wilt haue her taken away fr the perforce and by strength of hande. 29 Quid tu tibi vis? What wouldest thou haue▪ or what meanest thou? 30 Nescis, cui maledicas nunc viro You wot not on what maner of man you rayle now, or thou knowest not vnto what maner a man thou ge∣uest or speakest euill wordes now. 30 Nòn tu hinc abis? wilt thou not get thee hence? 31 Si quicquam hodiè hic turbae coeperis, faciam vt huius loci diei{que} mei{que} sōper memineris. It thou begynne to make any trouble, or any adoe heere at this time. I will geue thee a cause to thinke on this place, and this day, and also on me, as long as thou shalt lyue. 33 Miseret me tui, qui hunc tantum hominem fa∣cias inimicum tibi.

I wyll breake thy head, except thou get thee hence. 34 Ain' vero canis? sayest thou so, in deede, thou currshe Knaue? Canis (sayth Donate) is a woorde that men vse to obtect vnto such as be impudent and shamelesse followes, or to any o∣thers in despite and for a greate contuinely or check, as now in this time, the Turkes call vs Christian men, dogges, and one enemy in tyme of warre, calleth any souldiour on the contrary parte, dogge, in despite. And it is taken of the Greekes for those, whom the Latin men call
impudentes, shamelesse fellowes, the Greekes call properly kynopasi: Canino aspectu homi∣nes. Men looking lyke Dogges. 35 Quis tu homo es? What man arte thou, or, who arte thou? 37 Edico tibi, ne vim facias vllam in illum. I charge thee, that thou ay no violent hands on me 39 Tu me prohibeas, meum ne tangam? Shalt thou let mee to lay hande on that, that is mine owne? 40 Hic furti se alligat. He chargeth himself of fe∣lony or trespasse. Alligat se furti (sayth Dona∣tus). . reum le efficit fraudis, Alligat. i. astrin∣git. laqueat, & obnoxium facit. Entangeth and bringeth him selfe in daunger of impeche∣ment. And furtum is not only theft or robbe∣ry, but also all maner felony, or other iniury, fraude, deceipt, guile, or any trespas, whatsoe∣uer it be, that is in latyne, Omne maleficium generaliter. 41 Satis hoc tibi est.

Dost thou yet still speake ambiguously and doubt∣fully vnto me thou naughty packe? 3 Non tu isthuc mihi dicturus apertè es quicquid est? Wilt thou not tell mee playnely, whatso∣euer it is? 5 Quid factum est? What hath bene done? 6 Quid tibi ego dicā? What should I tell thee? 7 Quis fuit igitur? Who was it than? 9 Quid ais venefica? What sayest thou poyson∣full queane? 9 Certò comperi. I haue certayn knowledge of, Or, I am assured it is true. 11 Occidi, si quidem tu isthaec vera praedicas, I am vndone at least wise if that bee true that thou sayest. 13 Num id lachrumat virgo? Doth the mayden weepe for that? or therefore? 13 Quid ais sacrilega? What sayst thou naugh∣tie
he? 14 Istuccine interminata sum hinc abiens tibi? Did not I charge thee vppon a greate payne, when I went hence, that this shoulde not bee done? 15 Quid facerem? What should I haue done? a proper and elegant loction, or manner of spe∣king, and much in vse among authors wherof who listeth may reade more examples in Ha∣drian▪ de ser. lat. 15 Ita vt iussisti soli credita est. Shee was lefte with him alone according to your commaun∣dement. 16 Ouem lupo commisisti, Thou migtest aswell haue commited and left a sheepe with a wolfe to keepe. Ouem Lupo cōmittere, is a prouerbe vsed, whensoeuer we will signifye any thinge committed vnto him for whose cause, and for feare of whom, it had rather bene expediente & requisite to haue had an other keeper. 16 Dispudet sic mihi data esse verba. I am yll a∣shamed, that I shoulde bee in such wyse beguy∣led. 17 Quid hominis illic est? What fellowe is that? 19 Habemus hominem ipsum. We haue espyed or found very him that did the deede, 21 Quid illi faciemus▪ What shal wee doe vnto hym. The pure Latine authors do vse elegant∣ly this manner speakinge by the Datiue case, as wel by facio, as also by fio passiuely thus,
Quid illi faciemus? quid illi fiet? For that which some foolish felowes (sayth hee) speake thus, Quid de illo faciemus? Quid de illo fiet. Cic. in Academ quest. Quid enim faceret huic con∣clusioni. What shoulde he do to such a conclu∣sion as this is &c. Id in Rullum. Quaero siqui volunt vendere non fuerint quid pecunia fie I demaund this question, if there shall be none that wil fell it, what shal be done with the money? And Cato de tust. vseth the same manner speaking without interrogation. Si anté non deportauerit dominus, vino quod volet faciet. If the owner do not cary it downe before, he shal do with the Wyne what he wil. This notwithstandinge I haue noted diuers places in Terence where he vseth to speake by the same verbes ioyned with the ablatiue case without a preposition, as much as with the atie. Terent▪ in Heaut. act. 1 sc. 2. Quia enim incertum est etiam quid se faciat, For because that in deede he is yet vncertayne, or in doubte what to do with him selfe. Inibi. act. 2. sc. 3. Cedò quid hic faciet suasamica? Why tell mee what shall Clitipho here do with his owne lo∣uer? Idem in Andr. act. 3 scen. 5. Pamph▪ Nec quidem quid me faciam scio Da. nec equi∣dem me Pamph. And in good oth▪ I cannot tell what I may do with my selfe. Da. Nor I with my selfe. And agayne also in the same places, Quid me fiet? what shal become of me I omitie, that manye of the examples, that Hadrian cyteth and alledgeth, may bee taken as
wel in the Ablatiue as in the Datiue, that no child feare nor doubt to speake by both cases. Albeit Plaut. in Casina (at least wyse if the booke be not corrupt, but haue the true letter, as all examplaryes do consent and agree spea∣keth in the same sence by the accusatiue. Quid agis tu marite? mi vir, vnde ornatu hoc aduenis? quid fecisti Scipionem? aut quid habuisti palli∣um? What do you husbande my good sweete husband, from whence come you thus arayed? What haue you done with your staffe or what cloake haue you had? Quid fecisti Scipionem for de Scipione? or (more elegantly to speake) Scipioni in the Dattue, or Scipione in the Ab∣latiue. Scipio, nis, is latine for a saffe? And thereof the Famye of the Noble Scipions in Rome, had their firste Name. For that one Cornelius id leade about hys Father being blynde & stoode him in steede both of his Eyes and also of a staffe, for which thinge men looke vp, and vsed to call him Scipio, and so all hys Family after him were semblably named Sci∣piones, of the cognomination of the sayde Cor∣nelius. 32 Vide amàbo, si non, cum aspicias, o impu∣dens videtur. See I pray you, if when a Body looketh on him hee seeme not to haue an impu∣dent looke, or a shameles face. 3 Quae eius confidentia est? How bolde hee is or how great impudency, or lacke of shame is in him? Confido, confidis, confisus sum, confi∣dere, Confisum, cōfisu, to haue sure hope, trust
and confidence, as now wee say also in english, and it is referred as well to the present time as to the tyme past, and also to the tyme to come as witnesseth Donate and Valla. And confido dis, is vsed in bonam partem, and yet confidens and confidentia, comming of the same verbe, is obserued by custome and vse of speakinge, to be almost euer taken and vsed in malo, and verye seldome in the good part. And fidutia is in ma∣ner euermore taken in the better part, as may appeare in Valerius maximus, in the 3, booke, wher he maketh an intitulation, De fiducia sui. In the second scene. 1 Vter{que} pater & mater, quasi dedita opera domi erant, vt nullo modo introire possem, quin vide∣rent me. Both my father and my mother were at home, as if it had bene appoynted for the nones, so that I might by no means get in but that thy must needes haue seene mee. 4 Dum ante ostium sto. Whyle I was standing before the dore. 4 Notus mihi quidē obuiam venit, One of mine acquayntaunce came and met me. 5 Ego me in pedes quantum queo, conijio, I tooke me to my feete, as fast as I might run. 7 Miserrimus fui fugitādo, ne quis me cognosce∣ret, I was very yll troubled, encombred, and vexed, or as we say in Englishe prouerbially, in a whole pecke of troubles, in running out
of the way that no man might know me. And it is (as Donatus noteth) a very elegant manner of speaking, to say miser fugitando as miser a∣mando. Albeit he doth interprete miserrimus here Iassus, fatigatus, & lanquidus, werye, yred, and faynt, and cognosceret is taken for agnos∣ceret, quam belle verò ipse viderit. 10 Quid faciam? qvid mea autē? quid faciet mihi? What shal I do, tush what recke I what will he do vnto me. 11 Bone vir Dore, Salue, Honest man Dore, God you saue. 12 Satin' id tibi placet? Dost thou lyke it very well? 13 Credin' te impune abiturum? Dost thou think to escape vnpunished? 13 Vnam hanc noxiam mitte si aliam vnquam vl∣lam abmiser, occidito, Pardon mee this one offence or trespasse, and if I shal euer do so any more, slea me▪ noxiam sayth Do. pro noxa, tryssil∣labum pro dyssilabo. Albeit Valla denieth this word noxia, to be latine, saying (as I take hym) that it is nowher found contrary to other Grā∣marians. And in dede Calepinus readeth here noxā and not noxiam, albeit noxia is in diuers places in Plaut. Erasm▪ and others. 15 Nunc meam saeuitiam veritus es? Didst thou feare that I woulde bee so sharpe, or cruell on thee. 16 Hunc metui ne me criminaretur tibi, I was afearde of this man least that bee woulde
accuse me vnto you. Criminari aliquem is to accuse any man, & to lay any thing to his charge in open court, and crimen is not onely the offēce and trespas it selfe, but also the crimination, or accusation for the same. Valla li. 4. eleg. ca, 58. 20 Vix me contineo, quin inuolem in capillum, I can vnneath retrayn my selfe from flying vp∣pon him, to pull him by the hayre. 21 Etiam vltrò derisum aduenit, Besydes all the other thinges, hee commeth for the nones to laugh vs to scorne? 22 Abi hinc insane, Get the hence mad fellow. 22 Quid ità vero abeam? Why should I get mee hence I pray you▪ 23 Credin'isti quicquam furifero? Do you geue any credence to this gallowclapper? 25 Missa haec faciamus, Let vs passe all this. 25 Non te dignum Chaerea fecisti, Chere you haue done otherwyse then becommed you. 26 Si ego dignus hac contumelia sum maximè, at tu indignus qui faceres tamen, Although I bee neuer so wel worthy to be thus spitefully serued yet you were no meete man to do it. 28 Quid nunc consilij capiam nescio, I can not tell what counsel, or way now to take. 29 Conturbasti mihi rationes omnes, Thou hast troubled all my reckeninges and accomptes, or hast troubled and disappoynted al that euer I reckened vppon. Conturbare rationes, is the same that wee say in english to bring one out of his reckening, that is to say, to bringe him out of his purpose, and to disapoynt it.
33 Dehine spero aeternam inter nos gratiam fore. From henceforth I trust there shal be perfect attonement and loue betweene vs for euer, or that wee shalbe friends and louers for euer. 34 Ex huiusmodi re quapiam. Of or by some sem∣blable thinge as this. 35 Saepè ex malo principio magna familiaritas conflata est. i. contracta, comparata, conciliata. Oft times of a lewde beginning hath growen great familiarity and friendship. 36 Quid si hoc aliquis voluit deus? what if this were the will of God, or, of some good sayncts, or what if it was Gods wyll, that this should so bee? Equidem in eam partem accipio, & volo. Tru∣ly that way doe I take it, and woulde ryghte gladly that it might so bee. 38 Vnum hoc scito. Knowe and bee sure of this one thinge. 38 Scito contumeliae non me fecisse caussa, sed amoris. You shall weee or vnderstand, that I did it not for any despite or villany towardes you, but for loue. 40 Ignosco tibi. I forgeue or pardon thee. 41 Non adeò inhumano ingenio sum. I am not of so vngentle a nature or fashion. 44 Tibi ab isto hera cauendum intelligo. I well perceiue dame, that you had neede beware of this fellow. 45 Nihil tibi quid quam credo. I trust or beleue thee neare a whit. 46 Ego me tuae commendo, & committo fidei.
I commit and put me wholly in your honesty, goodnesse, or grace. 47 Ego te oro, in hac re mihi adiutrix sis. I be∣seech you to be my helper in this matter. Adiutrix is a Noune verball of the feminine gendre, and therefore referred to the feminine Sexe, and Adiutor, to the Masculine, and re∣ferred to the man. 48 Te mihi patronum cupio. I woulde fayne haue you to defend, and to helpe mee. 49 Emoriar, si non hanc vxorem du. I pray God I dye, if I doe not mary her. 50 Volet▪ certò scio. He will be glad I knowe very well. 52 Iam frater hic aderit virginis. The brother of the mayde will be heere by and by. 56 Domi operiamur potiùs quam hic ante ostiū. Let vs tary for him within the house rather then heere before the doore. 58 Hunc tu in aedeis cogitas recipere posthac? Doe you nde to let this fellowe euer come within your house agayne after this? 59 Crede hoc meae fidei. Beleeue this on my warrantise, as who shoulde say, trust mee in this, for I speake, meaning good sayth with∣out simulation, or dissimulation, that yee may trust vnto, and as yee shalbe sure to fynde on warrantise, for so it is taken heere. 60 Dabit hie aliquam pugnam denuò This fel∣low will cause some debate or fray agayne. 61 Parùm perspexisse eius videre audaciam: You seeme not to haue well marked nor considered
the boldnesse of him. 64 Ne{que} seruandum tibi quidquam dare ausim, ne{que} te seruare. I dare neyther commit any thing to thee to keepe, nor yet to take ye charge to see well to thee. For erua here is put for diligentèr obseruare. 66 Obsecro, abeamus intrò. I pray you let vs goe in. 67 Nolo me in via cū hac veste videat. I would not that hee should see mee in the streate wyth this garment. 69 I prae, sequar. Go before, and I will come af∣ter. Or, I will follow. 70 u isthic mane vt Chremem introducas. Tary you there, to bryng Chremes into the house. In the thirde Scene. 1 Quid venire in mentem nunc possit mihi, qui referam illi gratiam? What might I now de∣uise where with to requite him? qui pro quo. 3 Moue te ociùs. Bestyrre the apace. 4 Moeo. I styrre. 4 Video, sed nihil promoues. I see thee mooue and styrre, but thou makest no way, or no haste. Video. ▪ te mouere fed &c. 7 Benè arras. Yee say well. 7 Illi faueo virgini. I fauour, or loue that maide well, or▪ I beare good mynde and fauour to that mayden. 8 Iamdudū hera vos expectat domi My dame lo∣keth for you at home,  hath dn a good while. 9 Parmenonem incedere vidio, vide vt ociosus
sit. I see Parmeno come etting like a lord, but see how ide hee is, as one out of all care and thought vt. i. quomodo, vel qualiter▪ Incedo, di inessi, dere, incessum, incessu, is ambulare to walke, that is to goe. But properly incedere differeth from Ambulare. For incedere proper∣ly to goe wyth a stately pace, as who shoulde say, to shew a great grauity or maiesty in going as Prynces doe when they shew themselues in their estate, Senec. Tenero acmolli passu sus∣pendimus gradum nec ambulamus sed incedi∣mus We straight and prolong our going, with a nyce, or tender and soft, delicate, or gingerly pace, and doe not go as others doe, but ett, or go like great estates. Of Incedo cometh a ver∣bal incessus, u, ui, which is vsed for any maner goinge, but most properly it is the pace that great princes & noble men vse, when they shew their Estate or maiesty. Vi. Et vera incessu pauit dea. And she shewed hir selfe by hir pace to bee a goddesse. V. li. 5. c. 79. Ociosus. i. secu∣rus taketh no thought nor care for nothing. 10 Si dijs placet, In ye name of God, or on Gods halfe. It is a proue the neuer vsed in latine spe∣king, but ironicè, and in indignation. Read ex∣amples in Hadrian de sermo lat. There is an other prouerbe. Si deus voluerit, if it shall please God, vsed in serious matters of any thinge to come, the ende of which dependeth or hangeth in the fauour of God. And it is taken out of the epistle of saynct Iames, and recited in chil. Eras.
11 Spero me habere, qui hunc meo excruciē mo∣do. I thinke I haue found a way to vexe him, and to anger euery vayne in his heart, euen as I wil my selfe. Habere. i. inuenisse, or scire, meo modo. i. vt volo. 13 Hunc perterrebo sacrilegum. I wil make this wicked fellow throughly afeard. Sacrilegum. i. impium, nefarium, scelerosum. Albeit, sacrile∣gus, properly is he y• stealeth halowed thinges▪ and sacrilegium stealing of halowed thinges. Valla. li. 6. eleg. cap. 40. In the fourth Scene. 1 Reuiso quidnā hic rerum gerat, I com againe to see what hee is doing heere. 2 Astu rem tractauit. He hath handled y• matter wisely. Astu i. astute, and is heere amaduerbe, but sometime it is the ablatiue of the Noune astu us, ui. For it foloweth in the same como∣dy An in astu venit Dij vestram fidem, O good lord, it standeth al∣wayes in the place of an interiection of mer∣uayling, and not of calling on, admiantis non inocantis. 6 Confeci sine molestia, sie sumptu, sie dispen∣dio. I haue brought it to an end without any troubles or busines, without any charge or ex∣penses, and without any losse or damage. Id mihi puto palmarium. i. palma dignum, For that thinge I thynke my selfe worthy to bee crowned. Palma, mae in latine is a tre, that was wont to bee geuen to such as had wonne any
vitory. For because that is alwayes greene, and (as Piutarchus sayth) of that property, and Na∣ture, that there can no weight nor burthen op∣presse it, but that it will arise vnder it, & stande vp as it should doe. Reade Chili. Eras. in the prouerbe Palmam ferre. Mihi is here daiuu festiuitatis. i. iucunditatis gratia adiunctus, of which Reade in libello▪ de octo partium con∣structione. 11 Cum cognôrit, perpetuò oderit. After that he knoweth it, he will hate it euer as long as hee lyueth. 12 Foeminis, dum foris sunt, nihil videtur mun∣dius, nec magis compositum quidquam nec magis elegans, when Women are abrode out of their owne houses, nothing in the Worlde seemeth to bee more cleane than they be▪ nor nothinge more demure▪ nor more proper or feate. 14 Cum coenant, liguriunt When they eate, they feede▪ nicely or detily, and not but of the best. For ligurire, is formed (as sayth Denate) of the Grecke word  which is in english sweete. Ligurite sometimes is auidè & hellu∣ose, that is greedely and auningly or glutto∣nously to deuoure very much. 15 Harum videre ingluuiem, sordes, inopam, quàm inhonestae solae sint domi, atque uiae cibi, quo pacto ex iure hesterno panem atrum orē, nôsse omnia haec salus est adolescentulis.
But to see the rauening or munching, the slut∣tishenesse, and the penury of them, and howe vncleauely and greedy on their meate they bee when they are alone by themselues at home in their owne houses, and howe they will slare and sosse vp browne Breade with gruell of the leauing of ye other dayes before, al these things to knowe is the preseruation of Youth, to be∣ware of them. Hesternus, na, num, is not al∣wayes takē for the day before this day, but is much vsed for pridianus, na, num, that is for ye day afore any other day. Cic. Videre videor a∣lios intrantes, alios exeuntes, quosdam ex vino vacillantes▪ quosdam hesterna è potatione oci∣tantes. Mee thinketh I see some goinge in, some going forth, some reeling by reason of to much drinking of wyne, and some yeaning and gaping of the reuell that they kept the day be∣fore. And semblably cras & castinus is abused and spoken of the day after any other day. Virg. in Georg. Si vero ad solem rapidum, lunasque sequentes Ordine respicies, nunquam re crastina fallet Hora, nec insidijs noctis capiere serenae. 19 Ego e pro istis dictis & factis vlciscar, vt ne impunè in nos illuseris. I will reuenge or re∣quite thee for those thy sayings & doinges, that thou shalt not laughe vs to scorne, and escape free thy selfe. In the fifth Scene. 1 Proh facinus foedum. Oh, a shamefull and ab∣hominable deede.
1 O infoelitem adolescentulum. O vnfortunate young man. 2 O seelestum Parmenonem. O vngratious fellow Parmeno. Quae futura esse exempla dicunt in eum indig∣na? Howe sore and howe greuously say they that he shalbe punished, to the ensample of all others? Exempla aedere, or, exempla facere in aliquem, is to punishe any body openly to the example of others. And exempla edi, or, exem∣pla fieri in aliquem, is to bee punished openly, to the example of others: as if one be set vpō the pillory▪ or if a chylde for stealing or for any other heynous enormity be scourged naked   schoole, to the terrour of his fellowes, edū∣tur, or, iunt in eum exempla. So heere in Te∣rence anone after these words, Quae futura es∣se exempla dicunt in eum indigna, Parmen saith vnto Phias, In quem exempla fient? Who is that, that shall be punished to the en∣sample of all others? 4 O Iupiter, quae illic turba est? O Iupiter what great trouble, or what adoe is there? 7 Perdidisti istum adolescentulum. Thou hes vtterly vndone, & cast away this yong man. 8 Studes dare verba nobis, Thou goest about o thou art earnestly bent; or thou art euen set t deceiue vs. 10 Sci eum hinc ciuem esse, Thou knowest th he is of this city here. 10 Scisfratrem eius adprimè nobilem. s. esse. Thou knowest that his Brother is a
greate gentleman. 2 Ille vbi resciuit factum. He when he knew what was done. 3 Colligauit eum, miseris modis, Hec bound him fast hand & foote, that pitty it was to see 4 Atque equidē orante▪ vt ne id faceret, Thaide. Yea, and that when Thais desyred and prayed him that he would not so do. 5 Nunc minatur facturum se id, quod ego nun{que} vidi fieri, neque velim. s. videre fiei. Now hee meaneth & threatneth to do such a thinge vnto him as I neuer sawe done to this daye, nor would not see by my good will. 6 Qua audacia tantum facinus audet? How da∣reth he be so bold to do such a pertious act. Ne hoc nesciatis, That you may not say, that you knew not so much asore, or that you say not that you were ignorant of this 0 Dico vobis nostrum, esse illum herilm filium. I tel you he is our masters sonne. 1 Ne quam in illum Thais vim fieri sinat, Let not Thais suffer any vyolent hands to be aid on him. 2 Cur non egomet intrò eo? Why goe not I in my selfe? 2 Vide quid agas, ne illi prosis & tu pereas, Be∣ware what thou doest, and that thou do not him pleasure and cast away thyne owne selfe. 3 Putant quicquid est, ex te esse ortum. They thinke all that euer hath bene done, to come first of thee.
24 Quid igitur faciam miser? quidue incipiam? What shall I then do vnfortunate man, or what shal first begyn? 25 Video rure redeuntem senem, I haue espy∣ed the olde man comminge out of the country. 26 Dicam huic an non? Shal I tel him the mat∣ter or not? 26 Dicam herele etsi mihi magnum malum scio paratum, In fayth I will tell him, and yet I know that I shal surelye haue a greate harme, or shrewd turne thereby. 27 Necesse est huic dicere vt subueniat, It is ne∣cessary to shew this man of the matter, to the end that hee may do some helpe in it. 28 Tu istinarrato remomnem ordine, Shew you all the matter to this man in order. In the Sixt Scene. 1 Ex meo propīquo, rure hoc capīo cōmodi, ne{que} agri ne{que} vrbis odium me vnquam percipit vbi satias coepit fieri, commuto locum. Of my grounde that I haue without the citty this commodity & pleasure I haue, that I am neuer through weary, neyther of beyng in the countrey, nor of the citty. For when I begin to be wery of the one, or of the other, I chaunge places Odium. i. fastidium, vel tedium. 5 Satias. i. satietas, hoc est taedium ac fastidium. Quem praestolare hic ante ostium? whom dost thou tary for here before the dore? 6 Saluum te aduenire gaudeo, I am glad that you are come home in good health.
7 Perij lingua haeret metu. Alas that euer I was borne, my toung is tyed, nor cannot speake for scare. 8 Quid est quod trepidas? What is the matter that thou art so feared▪ 9 Here primum te arbitrari id quod res est, ve∣lim. Master first and formost I woulde haue you thinke as the matter in deede is. 10 Quicquid huius factum est, culpa nō factum est mea. What soeuer hath bene done here, it was not done by my fault. 11 Rectè sanè interrogasti. You did well to aske. 11 Oportuit rem praenarrasse me, I ought to haue shewed you the matter first. 14 Quanti emi? How bought he it, or how much payed he for it? 14 Viginti minis, He bought it for twenty poūds. 15 Here ne me spectes, Mayster looke not on me, or syr, eye me not so. 17 Aliud ex alio malum, One mischiefe is in an others necke. 18 Me impulsore haec non facit, Hee doth not such thinges as these by my instigation, coun∣sayle, or setting on. Impulsore. i. authore con∣sultore. 19 Omitte de te dicere, speake no more of thy selfe. 20 Istuc quicquid est primum expedi first tell me this matter quickly what soeue it is. 24 Audaciam meretricum specta. Se the boldnes of hariots and strumpets.
24 Nunquid est aliud mali damniúe quod non dexeris? Is there any other mischiese or mis∣fortune besydes this, that thou hast not yet told nor spoken of. 27 Non dubium est quin magnum mihi ex hac re sit malum. There is no doubt, but that I shal haue some displeasure by this thing. In the seuenth Scene. 1 Nunquam aedepòl quid quam iam di {quam} magi vellem euenire, mihi euenit. In good sooth there neuer happened vnto mee a greate whyl any thing, that I would more gladlye shoulde happen 2 Intrò ad nos venit, He came into our house. 3 Mihi ridiculo fuit, I laughed wel at him. 3 Quid timeret sciebam, I knew what he feared 4 Id prodeo, vt conueniam Parmenonē, I come forth of dores to speake with Parino. Id hoc est, propter id, it is Eclipsis praepositio∣nis. 5 Vbi obsecro est? Where is he I pray you? 5 Men quaerit haec? Doth this woman seeke me 6 Quid est inepta? quid tibi vis? quid rides: What is the matter foolishe giglot? What meanest thou? where at laughest thou? 7 Defessus iam sum te ridendo. I am euen wea∣ry with laughing at thee. 8 Nunquam aedepòl stultitiorem hominem vidi, nec videbo, By my truth I neuer sawe a more foolish felow, nor neuer shall. 9 Non possum satis narrare quos ludos praebue∣ris intùs. I cannot wel expresse, what sport and
laughing, wee haue had at thee within. 11 Illicone credere ea, quae dixi, oportuit te? Must thou needes haue beleeued that, that I sayd by and by euen at the first? 12 An paenitebat flagitij? Didst thou take remorse or repentance of thy great offence? flagitium is properly celus lagris dignum an heynous of∣fence, worthy to haue sharp correction and pu∣nishment. Valla lib. 4 eleg. cap. 57. 14 Quid illi credis animi tum fuisse; vbi vestem vidit illam esse eum indutum pater? where was his heart trowest thou, when his father sawe him in that apparell? wee may say induor ves∣ie or vestem, for induo is one of the verbs that gouerne a double accusatiue after them, and of all such verbes their passiues require the later accusatiue of both, As, I teach the Gammer. Ego doceo te grammaticam. By the passiue, thou art taught Grammer. Tu doceris gram∣maticam. 17 Itáne lepidū tibi visum est nos irridere? Did∣dest thou thinke it such a prety sporte to mocke vs? 18 Si quidem ist huc impunè habueris, If thou escape quite for this same. 18 Reddam hercle. s. vices, I will pay thee a∣gayne, or, I will serue thee as well, or, I will requite thee, or, I wyll bee euen with thee in farth. 21 Vter{que} in te exempla aedent, Both they will punishe thee, to the example of all other, Or, that all others shall take example by thee.
22 Nullus sum, I am vndone as who shoulde say, I were as good bee dead, and out of thys worlde. 22 Hic pro illo munere tibi honos est habitus, This honesty, & this promotion haue you got∣ten by that benefit or pleasure doing. Egomet meo indicio miser, quasi sorex hodie perij, I am cast away and betrayed this day by myne owne wordes, lyke as the rattes by their loude squeaking betray them selues, shewing where they bee. Suo ipsius indicio perijt sorex, The ratte betrayed her selfe with her owne noyse, & so was it taken, as a prouerbiall speaking of any, that are betrayed by their owne wordes. And as Donate thinketh, the vse of the meta∣phore was taken of this, that the property of the rattes is to make a louder squeaking then doe the Myce. See Chil. Eras. In the eyght Scene. 1 Qua spe, aut quo consilio hùc imus? In hope of what, or in what intent come we hyther? 1 Quid coeptas Thraso? what intēd you, or what begin you to doe Thraso? 2 Thaidi me dedam, et faciā quod iubeat, I will yelde my selfe vnto Thats, & will doe what she shall commaund mee. 3 Qui minùs, quàm Hercules seruiuit Ompha∣le? Why not, as well as Hercules did seruice vnto Omphale? Omphale, was a mayden & Queene of the country of Lidia, whom Her∣cules
did loue, and to winne her fauour did at her commaundement sley a great Serpent a∣bout the floude of Sagarie, and then after ser∣ued ye same Omphale, as her woman seruaūt, and as if hee had bene her bond mayden: In so much as shee compelled him to picke wolle, and to spinne and carde, whereas her selfe v∣sed to shoote, and to beare a Mace in her hand, to weare vpon her, the hea of a Lyon (as if she had bene a dalieunt knyght and refused to goe in apparell, meete and conuenient for her sexe. 3 Exemplum placet, I lyke that Example or comparison well. 4 Vtinam tibi cōmitigari videam sandalio caput, Woulde God I might see thy pate tamed and made sober with a slipper: alluding to the fable of Omphale aforegoinge by whom Hercules was after semblable sorte abused. 5 Quid hoe est mali? What misfortune is heere be tallen? 6 H ego nunquam videram, This man had I neuer seene before. 6 Quidnam properans prosilit? Wherefore commeth hee forth so fast, skippinge and lea∣pinge. In the nynth Scene. 1 Ecquis me viuit hodie fortunatior? Is there any man lyuinge thys daye more fortunate or more happy than I am? This particle ec. hath a very great grace in asking a Question,
when it is compound with Quis, que, quod vel quid. Cic. Atti. Ecquis vnquàm tam ex amplo statu, tam in bona caussa, tantis faculatbus in∣genij, consilij, gratiae, tantis presidijs bonorum omnium, condicit? Was there euer any man suppressed or vndone, beinge of so high degree hauing so good and rightful a cause, hauing so high a gift and indument of witte, polliy, and grace, to haue the fauour of men, and hauing so great assistance and ayde of a good and honest men? And sometime it is vsed infinitely with semblable and no lesse grace or elegancy. Cic. Atti. Quod quaeris, ecqua spes pacification is si quantum ex Pompeij multo & accurato sermo ne perspexi, ne voluntas quidē est, as touching that you desire to knowe, whether there be any hope of attonement and peace to bee made be∣twene Caesar & Pompeius, as farre as I haue well perceiued, by much and very curious or precise communication with Pompeius, there is no such mynde, ne will neyther. 2 Nemo herclè quisquam, In fayth no man in the worlde. Of nemo elegantly ioyned wt quis∣quam, it is noted in Hadriane, de serm. latt. 2 In me planè dij. potestatem suam omnem ∣stendêre. In me the Gods haue plainly shew∣ed all their whole power, and howe much they are able to doe. 4 O mearum voluptatum omnium inuentor, in∣ceptor, perfector. O thou that hast bene the de∣uiser and finder out, the beginner, and also the
finisher of all my pleasures. 5 Scis in quibus sim gaudijs? Doest thou knowe in what great ioyes I am? 6 Scis Pamphilam meam inuentam ciuem? Dost thou know that my best beloued Pamphila is founde to be free borne of this City? 6 Scis Pamphilam meam sponsam mihi. Doest thou knowe, that my beloued Pāphila is pro∣mised and made sure to me, to mary with mee? 7 Audin' tu illum? Doest thou heare him? 8 Meo fratri gaudeo amorem esse omnem in trā∣quillo. I am right glad & ioyous that my bro∣thers loue is quiet, and out of trouble. 9 In clientelam & fidem nobis dedit se He is be∣come our client, and hath put him selfe wholly in our handes. 11 Hoc aliud est, quod gaudeamus. This is an other thing, of which we may be glad, quod, id est, propter quod, eclipsis praepositionis. 11 Miles pellitur foras. The souldiour is cleane expulsed, or put out of doores, or banished the house. 12 Frater vbi vbi est, fac. quàm primùm haec au∣diat. Helpe that my Brother may heare of all this at once, wheresoeuer hee be Vbi vbi. i. vbi∣cunquè. For all voyces that are relatiues may sometimes bee interrogatiues, as when they aske a question, and sometimes they be neither relatiues nor interrogatiues, but are put and taken infinitely, and then if they bee doubled, that is to say, compounded wyth themselues
they stgnifle as much as if they were compo∣ded with this particle, cun{que} as, quisquis. i. qui∣cunque, qualisqualis. i. qualiscunque, quoquo. i. quocun què, quantusquantus. i. quantuscunquè, vbivbi. i. vbicunque, & so of all others, Quàm∣primum. i. valde citò, primo quoque tempore, as soone as may bee. For quam, in compari∣son signifieth valdè, & therefore is ioyned wyth the superlatiue degree. And note, that there is a great difference betwene quàmprimum, and cumprimum for cumprimùm, vtprimùm, vbi primum, simul primum, simulac & simulatquè, are of one significatiō, in english, as soone as: & quamprimum, by & by, as in example. As soone as my brother shalbe come agayne, doe mee to weete, or aduertise mee by & by, eyther by word of mouth, or els by letters. Cum primum, or, vt primum. &c. Frater reuer∣sus erit, vel nūcio, vel per literas facito me cer∣tiorem. 13 Nūquid dubitas, quin ego perpetuò perierim? Doest thou any thing doubt, or doest thou not thinke verely, that I am vtterly vndone for euer? 14 Sine dubio opinor. Without doubt I sup∣pose so. 14 Quid commemorem primum? What should I speake of first. 14 Quem laudem maximè? Whom may I most commend or prayse?
15 Dedit mihi consilium, vt facerem, Hee gaue counsell to doe it. 18 O Iupiter, serua obsecro haec nobis bona, Oh Iupiter keepe and continue vs in thys good fortune, felicity; or prosperity, I beseech thee. 20 Incredibilia modò narrauit, He told wonders while ere, or thinges incredible, or things that no man may almost beleeue. 20 Vbi est frater? Where is my brother? 20 Praestò adest. Hee is euen heere already. 21 Satis credo. I beleeue well, or I think well. 21 Nihil est Thaide dignius quod ametur. There is nothing more worthy to be beloued than is Thais. 22 Nostrae est omni fautor familiae. He fauoureth or loueth all our house well. 23 Quanto minus spei est, tan to magis amo, The lesse hope there is, the more am I in loue. 24 Perfice hoc precibus, precio, vt haeream in parte alqua apud Thadē, Bring this to passe with prayer, or with money, that I may bee an hanger on in one parte or other, with Thas. 26 Difficile est, It is hard. 26 Si quid collibuit, noui te. If thou be well dis∣posed to a thinge, I knowe thee well enoghe what thou canst doe. 26 Hoc si effeceris, quoduis donum, & praemi∣um â me optato, id optatum feres, If thou mayst bryng this to passe, wyshe or desyre of mee, what so euer gifte or rewarde thou wilt,
and thou shalt haue thy desyre. Donum est, quod gratis datur, praemium quod pro meritis confertur. 28 Postulo, vt mihi tua domus, te presente, te ab∣sente pateat semper. I require that your house may be open for me at all tymes, whether thou be in the way, or out of the way. 30 Do fidem ita futurum. I promise thee fayth∣fully, that it shall so bee. 30 Quem hic ego audio? Who is that, that I heare speake heere? 31 Tu fortassè, quae facta hic sunt, nescis. Thou doest not knowe peraduenture what thinges haue bene done, or haue happened heere. 32 Cur in his te conspicor regionibus? Why doe I see thee in these partes, or in these quarters? 33 Edico tibi. I tell thee openly. Edico, edicis, e∣dixi, edicere, edictū, is properly to proclaime, & perteineth only to princes, officers, and rulers, and thereof hoc edictum edicti, edicto, is the commaundement geuen or proclaimed by any prince, ruler, or officer. But heere edico, is takē for clarè dico, & clarè proloquor To speake or pronounce out aloude wythout any feare or dissimulation. For e. and ex. in composition haue much that signification, as eruo, is to get or to myne a thinge out of the earth, or any o∣ther place, where it is hard to come by. Egero is to cast out, efferro, is to bring out, expello, is to thrust out, Eloquor is to speake out aloude, and so edico heere is to speake out aloude. And in the same signification did Terence vse edi∣co
afore in the fifth Scene of this fifth acte, in this sme comody, in the person of Parmeno, saying thus vnto Pythias. Dico, edico vobis, nostrum esse illum herilem filium. I tell you, yea, and I tell you plainly and boldly, that hee is my masters sonne. As who shoulde say, I am not afearde to tell it you, but woulde that you should well knowe it, and warne you that you doe him no harme. 34 Si in platea hac te offen dero post vnquàm, ni∣hil est quod dicas mihi, alium quaerebam, ite hac habui, peristi. If it shalbe my chaunce to finde thee in this streate at any time after this day, it shall nothing auayle thee to say vnto me, I sought for another man, or my iourney laye this way, for thou arte but a dead man. 35 Eià haud sic decet. What softe, that is not see∣ming, or, it should not be for your honesty so to doe. Eia is an aduerbe of correcting. 35 Non cognosco vestrum tam superbum .s. in∣genium vel genus, vel animum, vel morem, vel institutum. I am not acquaynted wyth thys proude and disdaynefull fashion of you, or, I can no skill of this your &c. Albeit Donate taketh these wordes. Vestrum tam superbum to be put absolutely, that is substantiuely, as Vestrum tam superbum .i. vestram tantam su∣perbiam. Donate bringeth in for his autho∣rity, a like maner of speaking out of Andria in the sixt Scene of the fourth act. Pòl. Crito an∣tiquū obtines. Of which it is there sufficiently noted.
37 Priùs audite paucis, quod cum dixero, si pla∣cuerit facitote. First heare in 2. or 3. words, and when I shall haue sayd, if it shall like you, doe it. 38 Tu concede paululum isthuc Thraso. Thraso goe you and stande a litle further that way. 39 Ego vos credere hoc mihi vehementer velim, I would y• you in any wise beleeue me in thys. 41 Si vobis prodest, vos non facere inscitia est. If it bee for your profite, it is a foolishnes for you, not to doe it. 47 Magis oportunus, nec magis ex vsu tuo ne∣mo est. There is no man more meete for it, nor no man more to your commodity. Oportunus .i. Idoneus, meete for the purpose. Heere note that three negations do no more to the Sense, nor haue no more signification nor strength, then two, as Nunquam mihi nec obfuisti, nec profuisti. Thou neuer diddest mee neyther harme ne good. Cic. in tusc. quaesti. Nescierunt nec vbi, nec qualia essent, They knew not ney∣ther where nor what thinges they were. Ibid. Nihil nec disputare, nec scribere praetermisi. I omitted nothing, neither to dispute and rea∣son nor to wryte. Note also that two or three negations doe sometimes deny with more ve∣hemency. Pl. li. 18. cap. 4. Oculorum vitia fieri negant, nec lippire eos qui cum pedes lauant, aqua inde ter oculos tangant. It is a sayinge that they shall neuer haue Diseases in their eyes, nor shall not bee bleare eyed, which when they washe their feete, touche their eyes thryse
with the same water. Examples bee innume∣rable, and Budaeus hath noted the same largely and copiously in his Annotations vppon the Pandects of the Ciuill lawe. 48 Et habet quod det, & dat nemo largiùs. Hee both hath ynough to geeue and doth geeue, no man more liberally. 49 Fatuus est, insulsus, tardus. Hee is a naturall foole without any wysedome or good fashion, nor hath any quicknesse or lustinesse or ac∣ty or spirite in him. Fatuus (sayth Donate) inepta loquens, speaking foolish woordes For fatuus (sayth he) is sayd and deryued a fando, of speaking. And thereof fauni, that is to say the rusticall Gods of the woodes, whych are called in greeke , were called in lan fatui. i. (as Serutus vpon Uirgil, & Donate in this place expoūdeth it) multum fantes, hoc est multum loquentes, a fando & vaticinando. So that after Donate, farui bee they, that are foolishe in their woordes and sayings. Insulsi, are foolish in the heart, minde, and intelligence, and after him they erre and bee deceyued, that think that fatuus is animo & corde, & insulsus, in verbis & dictis. But Lau. Val. li. 4. eleg. c. 13. sayth in this wise. He is called in latin stultus. y• lacketh the experiēce of things, & knowledge of the worlde, & hath no foresight in thinges to come, so y• many beīg no vnwise mē otherwyse, yet may at sōtime haply do stultè, y• is foolishly▪ or more properly to say vnaduisedly. Fatuus is he y• is a very foole, & hath no wisdome at all, &
it is by translation taken of the sauerynges of meates, for when meates bee all wearyshe and vnsauery, they be called in latine fatui cibi. And semblably, a man that hath no wisedome is called in latine fataus. Martial. lib. 12. Vt sapiant fatuae fabrorum prandia betae▪ O quàm saepe Pete vina piper{que} coquus? Oh, howe oft will the Cooke aske and require wyne & peper for to make the wearish Beetes (that smythes, and carpenters dyne withal) to bee somewhat sauery? And this seemeth to be a better reason for this vocable fatuus, then the other, which certayne writers doe approue and allowe, that is to say, that they are called in latine fatui, whych being taken wyth a cer∣tayne urys or madnesse (such as Fatua the wife of king Faunus was much taken with∣all) doe prophecy thinges to come, like as shee the sayd Fatua did. Stolidus, is be that is fo∣lishe, and draweth much nighe vnto the nature and perceyuing, or vnderstanding of sheepe or other foolish bruite beastes. Hactenus Valla. Insulsus, is hee that hath no wysedome, nor witte, nor no grace, nor good fashion, neyther in words, nor gesture, nor otherwise in his be∣hauiour. What sal and sales signifie, it is largely shewed & declared in the thirde Scene of the seconde acte of this same comody. Of sal cometh salsitudo, or salsedo: of salsitudo, or salsedo, is formed salsus, a, um, a thing that is salte, and by translation, wittye, sharpe, plea∣saunt, and also byting in woordes and other∣wyse.
Contrary vnto Salsus is insalsus, a, um, wythout any wittinesse, or pleasant fashion, & consequently very foolishe and such as no man may haue any pleasure in. 49 Stertit noctesquè & dies. Hee lyeth routing & suorting all day and all night. 50 Facilè pellas vbi velis. You may easely thrust him out of doores when you list. 51 Hoc ego vel primum puto. This doe I thinke euen prineipall and chiefe of all. Vel. i. etiam. 52 Accipit hominem nemo meliùs prorsus, ne∣què prolixùs. Hee entertayneth a man, no man in the Worlde better, nor more sumptuously, Meliùs, id est, latiùs. More daintily. For it is referred to the prouision and deintynesse of cates. And Prolixiùs. i. largiùs copiosiùs, more aboundauntly and plenteously, for it is referred to the abundaunce & plenty of all such thinges as are prouyded. 54 Vos oro, vt me in gregem vestrum recipiatis. I desyre and pray you to receiue me into your flocke, as who shoulde say, that I may be ad∣mitted into your company, as one of you. See Chil. Eras. in the Prouerbe. De grege illo est. 55 Satis diù hoc iam saxum voluo, I haue la∣boured about this long enough nowe, if that be good. It is a prouerbial speaking, alluding vnto the fable of Sisyphus, whych (as the Poets fayne) was sonne vnto Eolus, and a great thiefe in Ihmo, he vsed when any strā∣gers arryued there, to slea them wyth stones,
and to tumble them down into the water from the toppes of ye rockes, at last he was slayne by one Theseus, and when hee came to Hell, this punishmēt was geuen vnto him, that he should beare vp a great stone vnto the top of an hyll, and as often as it rolled downe, to fetch it vp againe, but he could neuer cause it to lye, but y• it rolled downe to the hylles foote agayne im∣mediatly, after that he had brought it to ye top, and so his labour is infinite, and of this fable, such as haue great, & the same endlesse paynes wythout any fruit or profite, are prouerbially sayd in latine. Saxum voluere, to tumble, or to rolle the stone. Read Eras. in Chil. 59 Isti te ignorabant. These men did not know thee. 59 Postquam eis mores ostendi tuos, & collauda∣ui secundum facta, & virtutes tuas, impetraui. As soone as I had informed them of your cō∣dicions, and had praysed you, accordinge to your actes and vertues, or good qualities, I obtayned. 61 Gratiam habeo maximam. I thank you with all my heart. Habere gratiam, is properly in the heart, when we beare well in minde and re∣member such benefites as wee haue had or re∣ceiued, and haue good mynde and wyll to doe semblable benefites agayne, in recompence of them. reade Lau. Val. li. 5. eleg. cap. 41. 62 Núnquam fui vsquam quin me omnes ama∣rent plurimùm. I was neuer yet in any place, but that euery body loued mee very well.
63 Dixin ego vobis in hoc esse atticam eloquen∣tiam? Did not I tell you, that you should finde in this man the most pure and high eloquence that is? Attica, cae, or Atte, tes, is a region or countrey in Grecia, situate and lying betwene Achaia, and Macedonia, in which countrey or region stoode the City of Athens, where was spoken the most pure and cleane, and most elo∣quent Greeke, lyke as in London is spoken the best and most pure and true Englyshe, and in Paris the best French. &c. And by reason thereof Attica eloquentia, is vsed for the most pure, true & polite eloquence, & that eloquence, which the best & most cunning oratours vsed: whych best and chiefe Oratoures for the same cause were called in latin Attici, as who should say, most Eloquent, as comminge most nygh vnto the pure eloquence of the Attiques. Al∣beit, heere in this place it is spoken ironicè, much lyke as if Gnato shoulde haue sayde by Thraso, in English: did not I tell you, that this gentilman rolleth in his Rhethorique, as Apes doe in tayles? For he sayd a litle afore, that Thraso was fatuus, insulsus, & tar∣dus. 64 Nihil praetermissum. s. est, There hath no∣thing bene omitted or let passe. 64 Ite hàc omnes vos. Goe you all thys way heere. Finis Eunuchi.
EX HEAVTONTIMO∣RVMENO. ¶ In the Prologue. 1 NECVI sit vestrum mirum. Maruayle none of you. 2 Id primum dicam, deinde, quod veni eloquar. I will first tell that, and afterwarde I will shewe and declare the cause of my hyther cōming: quod, id est, prop∣ter quod, or cuius causa, cuius gratia. 3 Ni partem maximam existimarem scire vestrū, id dicerem. I would tell it if I thought that the most part of you knewe it not well enough already. 10 Nunc quamobrem has partes didicerim, pau∣cis dabo. Nowe wyll I shewe you in two or three wordes, for what cause I haue learned to play this parte. 16 Rumores distulerunt maleuoli. I willers, or maligners haue spread abroad naughty tales. Differo, differs, distuli, dilatum, hath many sig∣nifications, to differre, to prolonge, or to delay. Luca: Nocuit differre paratis, it hath done harme vnto many folkes, after that they haue bene ready to make longer delay. Sometime to endure as Plin. in epist. did put differre fi∣tim, to endure thyrste, as who shoulde say, to forbeare to drynke, though one were thirsy,
sometymes differre is to trouble a man, & with some sodayne feare to bring him to his wittes ende, that he know not what first, or best to do. Plaut. in Pseu. iam ego te differam dictis meis impudice. I will rattle, or shake thee vp ere I goe, that thou shalt not wot what to do. shame∣les fellow that thou art. Idem in Cistel. Miser exanimor, feror, differor, distrahor, diri∣pior, it a nullam mentem animi habeo. I mise∣rable body am almost dead. I go lyke a man, I wot not whither, I am in such griefe, that me thinketh I am pulled in peces, I am haled in sonder, and am torne in peeces, I haue so lost all the reason and wit that was in my head So Terence afore in Andria, Orationem spe∣rat inuenisse se, qua differat te, pro in tu face vt apud te sies Hee hopeth that he hath now foūd a tale agaynst thee, wherwith to bring thee at thy wittes end, therfore see thou that thy wits be thyne owne. And in this significatiō differor is much vsed amōg the Latine authors, as dif∣feror amore vel cupiditate, I am in extreme paynes for loue and desyre Differor doloibus, I am in such extreame paynes, that I thinke my selfe to be torne in peeces, and may no lon∣ger endure for payne. Differor laetitia▪ I am rauished with ioyful∣nesse. Somtymes differo is to sow or o spread abroade in diuers places, as, differre alicui fa∣mam▪ is to spread abroade a mans name in di∣uers places. And Differre rumorem de aliquo is to sowe or bring vp and to sprede abroad in
diuers places a bruite, or a noyse, or tale of, or by any bodye, as in this place of Terence, some tymes differre is to bee vnlyke, or to bee diffe∣ringe from an other thing. Rumor, ois, or Fama mae, is a fame, a bruite, or a noyse▪ brought vp of any new thing, the author, or brīger vp ther∣of being vnknowen, & whether the same bruit or fame be good or yll. What rumor and fama sig∣nify, and of the vse of thē, see in Laur. Valla. lib. 4. eleg. cap. 10. 18 Factum hic esse id non negat, & se deinde fa∣cturum autumat. He here sayth not the contrary, but that it was so done, and hee thinketh to doe the same agayne hereafter, 20 Habet bonorum exemplum, quo exemplo si∣bi licere facere, quod illi fecerint putat, Hee hath to lay for him the example of good and honest persones, by whych example hee thin∣keth and reckneth, that he may laufully doe the same, that they haue done before him, Exem∣plum is the thing that we followe or eschewe, and examplar is the thing in which Exemplum is contayned as here in this place of Terence, Exemplum is in bonis, and ipsi boni bee Exam∣plar, or, exemplaria. And semblably the eloquēce of Cicero is Exemplum for vs to followe, and Cicero him selfe is Exemplar, in which Exem∣plum of eloquence is contayned and semblably of all other thinges, as Lau. Vel. hath copiously and cunningly annoted. li, 6. eleg. cap. 33. 26 Omnes vos oratos volo, I woulde desyre
you all. 30 Ne ille pro se dictum existimet. Thinke hee not that to be spoken in his fauour. 31 Fecit seruo currenti in via, He did it vnto the serunt as he ran by the streete. 32 Cur insano seruiat? Why should he do seruice vnto a mad man. 34 Finem maledictis facit, He leaueth rayling. 35 Ad este aequo animo. Stand stil quetly and pa∣ciently. 35 Datem potestatem mihi. Geue mee licence 40 Clamore ummo, & labore maximo, With very high, or onde crying out, or hallowinge,  with very great labour. 41 Causam hanc iustam esse animam inducite Perswade your selues, and thinke in your myndes, that this cause or matter is good, iust, and rightfull. 42 Vt aliqua pars laboris minuatur mihi, that som part of my labour may be cut of, or that I may haue some what the lesse labour and payne. 44 Ad me cuitur. Euery body commeth running to me. 46 Experimini in vtamque partem ingeni quid possit meum▪ Assay and proue ye what my witte is able to do in, or for both partes. 48 Nunquam auarè pretium statuti arte meae. I neuer set too hygh a pryce on my craftes: or I was neuer couetous settyng price on my craft. 49 Eum esse quaestum in animum induxi maxi∣mum quam maximè inseruire vestris commo∣dis, I haue alwayes bene content to thinke and
to recken my most winning gaynes, and profit to bee, to do al diligent seruice that I can or your profite. 51 Exemplum statuie in me, vt adolescentuli vo∣bis placere studeant. Shew an example vppon me, that other young men may be desyrons and may labour to be in fauour with you, or to get your fauour. Out of the first acte in the first scene. 1 Inter nos nuper admodùm notitia est. It is a ve∣ry litle while agone, sith we haue bene acquain∣ted togeather. 2 Agrum in proximo hic mercatus es, you haue bough a plotte of grounde, here neare besyde mee. 3 Nec rei amplius quidquā fuit. s. inter nos. And there hath bene none other thing at all betwene vs. 4 Vel virtus tua me vicinitas, quod ego in pro∣pinqua parte amicitiae puto, facit, vt te audactèr moneam, & familiariter, Both your vertue, goodnesse, or honesty, & also that wee are neigh∣boures, and dwel nigh togeather (which thing I reckon as one of the chiefe partes and great∣test causes of entire amitye and friendshippe) causeth me to speak vnto you, and shew you my minde boldly and familiarly lyke a friend. Monere, or admonere is to tell a man of hys fault with a certayne correction, rebukinge, or chyding. 7 Mihi videre praeter ae tatem tuam facere & ptae∣terquàm
res te adhortatur tua: Me thinketh you you do otherwyse than is cōuenient for your age and otherwyse than is requisite for a mā of your substance. 10 Annos sexaginta natus est, aut plus eo, vt con∣ijcio. You are three score yeares old, or aboue as I suppose of amplius elegantly and indifferently ioyned with the nominatiue, accusatiue, or abla∣tiue, see in Hadrian de serm. latino. 11 Agrum in his regionibus meliorem neque prae∣tii maioris, nemo habet, No mā in al these parts hath a better plot of ground, nor better lande or more worth. 15 Nunquam tam manè egredior, neque tam ves∣peri domum reuertor, quin te in fundo cōspicer fodere, aut arare, aut aliquid facere, I neuer goe orth so early in the morning, nor come home a∣gayne so late in the euening, but that I see thee abroade in thy ground, either digging, or plow∣ing, or else some other woorke doyng. 18 Nullum remittis tempus, neque te respicis, you are no tyme vnoccupyed, nor passe any thing on your selfe, or set any store by your selfe. 19 Haec non voluptati tibi esse satis certò scio, That these things are no pleasure vnto you I am wel assured. 20 At enim dices? But peraduenture you wil say vnto me. Enim here is no coniunction causall, but an expletyue, 20 Me quantum hic operis fiat poenitet, Me th∣keth all the worke that is done here to little. Me poenitet, i. mihi parum videtur. For poeni∣tere
is to be sorry, to repent, or to forthink, and because they that are sory thet their matters or busines goeth not well forward, thinke al that is done to lille. Therefore poenitere is some∣times elegantly taken for parum videri, to seme litle. Verg, in bucol. egl. li. 2. Nee te poeniteat calamo triuiss labellum, and thinke it not a smal thing to haue learned to play on the pipe or the recorder Cicero in praefatione libri pri∣mi officiorum Quamobrem disces tu quidē à principe huius aetatis Philosophorum: & disces quamdiu voles: tam diù autē velle debebis, quo∣àd te quantum proficias non poenitebit Wher∣fore thou shalt learne and be scholer vnto Cra tippus the best and chiefe of all Philosophers that are at this day, as longe as thou shalt be willing thy self, and so long thou oughtest to be willing as thou shalt not thinke thy selfe to doe litle good, & to leese thy time, but to profit. So Terence before in Eunucho act. 5 scen. 7. An poenitebat flagiti, te authore, quod fecisset ado lescens, ni miserum insupèr etiam patri indica∣res? Diddest thou not think that great offence, whych the younge man hadde doone by thy coūsayle, and setting on to be enough, but that thou must moreouer also be the first y• shoulde betray and appeache the poore soule vnto hys father? 21 Quod in opere faciundo operae consumis tuae si sumas in seruis exercendis, plùs agas. If you woulde bestow that labour in exercising your seruaunes, and settynge them to worke, and se∣ing
them occupied, which you spēd in working or labouring your owne body, you should doe more good, or you should haue more good done or you shoulde haue more profite by it, or you would more preuayle. 23 Tantum ne est ab re tua otij tibi aliena, vt cu∣res, eaque quae nihil ad te attinēt? Hast thou so much leysure and voyd tyme from thyne owne businesse that thou mayst meddle in other mēs matters, in such things as appertayne nothīg vnto thee, nor nothing touch nor cōcerne thee? 25 Homo sum humani à me nihil alienum puto, I am a man as other men be, and thinke eue∣ry thing that appertayneth to any man, to ap∣partayne also to mee, or to concerne, or touch mee too. 28 Tibi opus vt est facto, face pro fac, Do thou as is expedient for thee to doe. 29 An cuiquā est vsus homini se vt cruciet? Is it expedient for any man to punishe hys owne bo∣dy, and to put himselfe to o much payne, and torment. 32 Ne lachruma, weepe not, Ne. when it is an aduerbe of forbydding, may bee indifferentlye ioyned with a verbe of the subiunctiue mode, or else of the imparatiue. But, non, may neuer be ioyned with the imparatiue and with all o∣ther modes it may, as Linacre hath noted. 32 Istuc quicquid est, fac vt sciam, Let me know the matter what so euer it be. 33 Ne retice, Hyde it not, or keepe it not in, Do∣natus hath noted that reticere, is to kepe in.
and not to vtter such thinges as wee are sorye and take thought for Obticere, is to keepe in such thinges as we are ashamed of. Terentius in Eunucho. Virgo conscissa veste lachrumans, ob∣ticet▪ The mayden hauing her gowne all to cut weepeth, and wil speake neuer a word, Tacere is to kepe secrete, things of counsayle, as afore in Eunucho. Potin' est hic tacere? Can this fellow conceale any secrets? or keepe any counsayle? 33 Ne verere, be not afrayde. 34 Te aut consolando, aut consilio, vt re iuuero, I will surelye helpe you, eyther by geuing you woordes of comfortr, or else with geuinge you some good counsaile, or els in very deede. 35 Hac quidem causa qua dixi tibi. I fayth e∣uen for the same cause that I haue told you. 36 Istos rastros intereà depone, ne labora. Lay dòwne thy rake in the meane season, and labour or worke not. 37 Quam rem agis? What do you? or what en∣tende your or what goe you about? 38 Sine me vacuum tempus ne quoddem mihi la∣boris, let me alone that I may not suffer my selfe to let any tyme passe voyde of labour. It be sayde vacuum laboris for vacuum labore, or vacuum a labore. Non aequum facis, You do not well or honestly as you should do. 40 Sic meritus est meum, So haue I deserued, or such is my desert.
41 Filiū vnum adolescētulum habeo, I haue but one sonne in the world and he is a young stryp∣ling. 43 Nunc habeam necnè, incertum est. s. mihi. I am in doubt whether I haue one now or not. 43 Quid ita isthuc? s. dicis? or incertum tibi est? Why sayest thou that. 44 Est e Cotintho hic aduena anus paupercula. There is heere a poore old woman a straunger that came out of Corinth hether. 45 Eius filiam illa amare coepit perditè. Her daughter he began to loue so vnthriftelye, that he had almost cast awaye, and vndone himselfe. 46 Propè iam, vt pro vxore haberet. So that hee vsed her in maner as his wyl, that is openlye without beyng ashamed. 46 Haec clam me omnia. s. fecit. All this he didde vnknowen to me. 47 Vbi rem resciui. After that I had knowledge of the matter. Rescio, rescis, resciui, rescitum, and a verbe frequentatiue of the same. Rescis∣co, resciscis. resciui, resciscere, rescitum, After Aulus gellius, is to haue some priuye know∣ledge (and we say) an inkling of any thing done priuelye, or otherwise dissembled and kept from our knowledge. But Valla checketh and re∣proueth the sayde Aulus Gellius, for that say∣ing, and sheweth that Rescisco is a playn verbe and is properly to haue knowledge of a thinge after that it is done, of which thinge thou were vnknowing whē it was done, specially if it ap∣pertain
to thee or to any other of thine. 50 Tibi ne haec licere speras facere, me viuo? do thou thinke that thou shalt bee suffered to do such things as this, whyle I am aliue? 53 Erras si id credis & me ignoras Clinia. Clinis thou art deceyued, if thou so thinke & knowest me not. 54 Ego te meum esse dici tātisper volo, dū quod te dignum est facies. I wil thou be cauled mine so longe as thou shalt doe as becommeth thee and no longer. For that is the vse of tantisper ioyned with dum taken for quàm diu, as she∣weth Val. lib . eleg. cap. 48. 55 Si quod te  um est, non facis, ego quod me in te it facog num inuenero, If thou do not as becommeth thee to do, I shal finde the meanes to do by thee, as shal become me. 57 Nulla adeo re isthuc fir nisi ex nimio otio Sure this commeth of none other thing but of to much ease and ydlenes. Adeo. i. certe. profe∣ctò 58 Ego istuc aetatis non amori operam dabam. I when I was of ye age that thou art did not be∣stow nor set my mind on wanton loue: the la∣tine authors vse with greate grace and much elegancy. Id temporis, per id tempus, id aetatis, hoc aetatis, isthuc etatis, quid aetatis, absolutely wherof reade in Hadrian de serm. lat. 59 In Asiam hinc abi propter pauperiem, I was ayne to goeout of these partes into the country of Asia for pouerty.
61 Adolescentulus saepe eadē & grauiter audiēdo victus est, the yong man wt oft & sore hearing one thinge was euen done, or was greatly dismaid. 63 Putauit me aetate plus scire. He thought that I knew more, by reason that I was older, or hee thought that I could better skill in things, or was better seene in experiēce of the world, be∣cause that I had mo yeares. 64 Putauit me beueuolentia plùs prouidere quē se ipsum sibi. He thought y• I would prouide for him, or foresee what was most expediēt for hys profite▪ better than he could for him selfe, for the entire and hearty loue that I bare him. 65 In Asiam ad regem militatū abijt. He is gone hence into the country of Asia vnto y• king there to be a souldiour, and to goe on warfare. 66 Clam me profectus, menses tres abest, he wēt away and tooke his iourney vnknowing to me, and hath bene away now a whole quarter of a yeare. In woordes betokening space of time, the vse of the accusatiue signifieth continuance of time without intermission, or ceasing, secundū Seruium. Albeit we may vse also the ablatiue. 67 Ambo accusands, estis. ye are both to blame. 67 Illud incoeptum animi est pudentis signum▪ That beginning is a signe or token of a shame∣ast heart, or of an honest heart. 67 Vbi comperi ex ijs, qui ei fuere conscij. Whā I knew of it by them that were priuy to it, and of his counsayle. 70 Domum reuertor moestus. Home I come a∣gayne all sadde.
70 Domum reuertor animo ferè perturbato, at{que} incet to prae aegritudine, I come Home agan in manner out of my mind, or distraught and vn∣certayne what to do for thought. Cie. in tuse. quest: sheweth that aegritudo, properly is in the mynd, and aegrotacio in the bodye, and that ani∣mus est aeger corpus aegrotum. Aheyt, those wordes are much cōfounded, that is to say, the one vsed for the other, as wel in the sayd Ciceto and in Quintilian, Terence, and others. 72 Accurrunt serui, soccos detrahunt, My ser∣uauntes came running to me, and pulled of my pinsons▪ or stertuppes. Soccus, Socci, Socco, was a kynd of shooes, and it is fourmed of so∣tus, socci, a bagge, and had the name thereof, because that whē it was fastned vpon the foote, it bagged and lay ful of pleates. And they were vsed in wearing both of men and women, but most among the nobles and rich falkes, 73 Video alios festinare, lectos sternere, caenam ap∣parare, I see some others make hast to lay the table, and to make rea for supper. Lectus le∣cti is a bed, Festus pompeius deryueth lectom ab alliciendo, that whē the body is weary it de∣syreth rest, and some deryue lectū of the greeke word lectron, albeit lectus (vt inquit Varro) di∣ctus est, quod lectis herbis & frondibus stramē∣ta facerent. Lectus is so called (sayth Varro) be∣cause that in old time they vsed to gather grasse and leaues, or boughes, and so to strawe them on the ground, and then to lye downe on them.
And because they ved much to cate in the same place (for then they had not found out the vse of meate tables) therfore lectus was also taken for mensa, and is much vsed in that signification in Plaut. Terence, and all Poets, and other wry∣ters, that be of any antiquity. Horat. Saepe tri∣bus lectis, videas coenare quaternos. A man shal te oft three tables at once, and at euery table 4 persons at supper, or eating meate. 74 Pro se quisque sedulò faciebat, quò illam mihi lenirent miseriam. They were euery body for his part, as busye as they coulde be, to case me of the care that I was in. Vbi video haec caepi cogitare, when I sawe all this, I began to cast and thinke in my mynd. Tot mea solius soliciti sunt causa, vt me vnum expleant? Are so many persons diseaed and troubled for my cause and sake onely to satiffye the pleasure of me alone? Of mea solius causa, with others like reade Lauren. Val. li. 2. eleg. cap. 1. about the middle wher he doth copious∣lye, and cunningly treate therof. Vnum, 1. so∣lum. Sumptus domi tantos ego solus faciā? Should I alone or beyng but one man spende so much money, or be at so great charges in my house? Gnatum vnicum pariter vti his decuit aut etiā amplius. It was meee that my onely Sonne should haue had as much part of these thinges as I, or rather more. Illa aetas magis ad haec vtanda idonea est,
That age is more meet to occupy those thinge When there commeth in any latin clause a ge∣round of a transitiue▪ that gouerneth an accu∣satiue case after him, the gerunde may very ele∣gantly bee chaunged into a noune participell of the voyce of the future in dus, and made to agree with the substantiue in gendre, number  lyke case as the gerūd was before it was chaū∣ged. An example of the ablatiue case. Cic. in. praefa. li. i. offic. Orationem latinam efficies pro∣fecto legendis nostris pleniorem. For legendo nostra. Thy latine tongue thou shalt vndoutee. ly make more ful and more copious by reading my workes and such bokes as I haue writtê, An exāple of the occusatiue. Idem li. i off. Me∣minerimus autèm & aduersus infimos iusticiā▪ esse seruandam, for seruandum esse iusticiam, And we must remember to keepe Iustice, that is, to deale tustly and truly also with the poorest and lowest persons that be. An example of the genetiue case. Ibid. Vt nèc medici, nec impera∣tores nèc oratores, quamuis artis praecepta per∣ceperint, quic{quam} magna laude dignū siue vsu ex∣ercitatione, consequi possunt officij couseruan∣di: praecepta traduntur illa quidem, vt faciamus ipsi for praecepta conferuandi officium. As ne∣ther phisitions nor Captatnes in warre, nor pratours, though they haue substanciall well learned all the rules of their faculty, yet may not possibly attayne to doe any thynge worthy great prayse and commendetiō, without much exercise and practising▪ righte so here bee wryt∣ten
and geuen vnto vs preseptes of oure office and duety, how to behaue our selues in our ly∣uing towardes al persons, but that is to y• en∣tent, that wee must put them in vre, and prac∣tise the same our selues, I sayde a verbe tran∣sityue that gouerneth an accusaitue case, For such mutation or chaunge may not bee done in any verbes gouerning any other case, & not an accusatiue. For wee may not say Placendi prae∣ceptoris studium, but Praeceptori nor in Maledi cendo re, but tibi, nor in abstinendis voluptati∣bus, but in abstineudo à voluptatibus, except when abstineo is taken and made a transitie, nor ad abundanda bona, but ad abundandum bonis. Therefore when we say ad haec vtenda, Children shal note that the Latine men of olde tyme vsed these verbes, vtor, fungor, fuor, po∣tior, and sometymes careo gouerning an accu∣satiue case after them, examples be euery wher umerable, apud Plaut. Tetentium, Ciceronē iue consultos, & alios. 81 Eum ego eieci hinc miserum iniusticia mea, I haue expulsed and driuen him from hense pore soule, by myne vnreasonable fashion, or dealing which sayth in an other place of this same seene thus Propter meas iniurias. 82 Malo quidem me dignum qnouis deputem, si id faciam. I might wel thinke my selfe worthy of any misaduenture in the worlde, if I should do such a thing. 83 Vsquè dùm ille vitam illam intollit pro colit▪ agit, degit. As long as hee liueth such a lyfe
as that is, or as long as he liueth after that sor or rate. 86 Illi de me supplicium dabo I wil suffer him to punish mee, I wil suffer puni, ment for his sake. Dare poenas, dare supplicium: Luere poe∣nas, luere supplicium, pendere paenas & pende∣re supplicium is to suffer punishment, or to bee punished. And they be construed with a o∣minatiue of the party that suffereth the punish∣ment, and with a datiue case of the person that doth punishe. 88 Nil relinquo in aedibus, nec vas, nec vestimen∣tum I let nothing in the house, neyther vessell, or garment. 89 Corrasi omnia, I haue scraped vp, and solde altogether. Corrasi. i. compilai, vendidi. Do∣nate. 92 Inscripsi aedes mercede, I gaue vp my house and wrote vpō the dores, that the house was to let, or to be sold. So Plau. in Tinummo Quia rure dum sum ego vnos sex dies, me absente at∣que insciente, inconfultu meo, aedes venalet hasce inscripsit literis. Because that whyle I haue bene in the countrey, but one poore sixe dayes, he hath written vppon the dore that this my house was to sell, I beyng frō home absent or out of the waye, and knowing nothing ther∣of, and without any coūsayle esking of me. Meo inconsultu. i. minimè me consulens. 94 Agrum hunc mercatus sum. I haue bought this plot of ground. The difference betweene
ager, fundus, villa, & praedium, Reade in Valla. li. 6. eleg. cap. 41. 94 Hic me exerceo, Heere am I occupied, or heere doe I exercise my selfe. 97 Non fas est vlla me voluptate frui, I may not take any maner pleasure. 99 Ingenio te esse in liberos leni puto, I recken you to be of a gentle nature and tender on your children. 100 Puto illum obsequentē si quis rectè aut com∣modè tractet, I recken him tractable, or easie enough to be ruled, if a man did hādle him wel, or after a good sorte. 102 Nequè tu illū satis noueras, nec te ille, Nei∣ther thou knewest him very well, nor he thee: or neyther thou were very well acquainted with his fashion, nor hee with thine. 103 Nunquam ostendisti, quanti illum penderes, You neuer shewed howe much yee set by him. 104 Nec ille tibi est credere ausus, And he durst not trust thee, nor he durst not make the priuy to thinges. 106 Ita res est, So goeth the matter, or, so it is. 107 Illum saluum ad futurum efle confido pro∣pediem, I trust verely that he wil right shortly be heere in good health. 109 Vtinā dij ita faxint, God grunt it may so be, 109 Si commodum est, hodiè apud me sis volo, If you may conueniently, I would desire you to make mery at my house to day. 111 Siccine est sententia? Thinke you so? or, is that your mynde and opinion in deede.
114 Quaeso tandèm aliquantulum tibi parce, I pray you fauour or spare your selfe some what et trast after so great labour. 115 Benè vale. Fare yee wel, or God be with you. 115 Lachtymas excussit mihi, He hath caused me to weepe. 116 Miseret me eius I haue pity on him. 117 Monere oportet me hune, ad coenam vt veni∣at, I must put him in remēbraunce to come to supper. 118 bo vt visam, si domi est, I will goe to see, it he be at home It is shewed afore that, Viso, fa∣cesso, capesso, lacesso, with other like verbs in so, bee not desideratiues, as Priscian woulde haue them, and that they signifie and betoken the mouing and act of the body and not the af∣fecte nor destre of the mynde: yet sometymes they bee vsed for theyr primitiues, as heere vi∣sam, is put for his primitiue Videam. And so it is to be takē, as often as it is ioyned with any of these words, Venio, eo, is, iui, gratia, causa, studium, or any other like voyce. 119 Nihil opus fuit monitore, iamdudùm domi praestò apud me aiunt, Hee had no neede of any man to put him in remembraūce. For they say that bee is at home at my house all ready, and hath vene a good whyle. 120 Egomet conuiuas moror, I my selfe cause my guests to tary. Moror te (as estifeth Do∣natus and also Valla) in oratours is most ta∣ken for retineo te, or in mora teneo, I cause thee to tary Quiliau. Quid me adhuc pater
detines? quid moraris abeuntem? Father where fore doe yee holde and keepe mee backe still  Why doe yee cause mee to tary that would bee gone? 121 Quid crepuerunt fores? Why creeketh the doore, or, what creaking maketh the doore? 122 A me quisoā egeditur? Who cōmeth foorth of my house? For the preposttiō, a, toyned with the ablatiue of persons, betookeneth from the same persōs house, as, A iudice venio, I come from the Iudges house, and so apud, as Apud nos est, Hee is at our house, but this is most vsed in Poets. 122 Huc concessero, I will stand asde heere Cō∣cedo, dis concessi, concessum, Sometime sig∣nifieth to go, or to depart out of one place into an other, or to stand aside, where to be secrete. In the second Scene. 1 Nihil adhuc est, quod vereare, There is no thing yet why thou shouldest be afearde. 2 Illum simul cum nuncio tibi hic affuturum ho∣diè scio, I know well that he wil be heere with you anone together with the messenger y• went for him. Simul cum nuncio, as who should say, as soone and with as great expedicion, as the messenger that was sent for him. 3 Solicitudinem istam falsam, quae te excruciat, omittas, Let goe that false care and thought that vexeth and freiteth thy heart. 4 Quicum loquitur filius? With whom talketh my sonne? 5 Oportunè aduenis, You come very well.
6 Hunc Menedemum nostin' nostrum vicinum. Doe yee knowe Men edemus heere beinge our neighbour? 9 Mihi magna cum eo iam inde vsque à pueritia semper fuit familiaritas; I haue bene very fa∣miliarly acquainted with him euermore, euen from my childhoode. 10 Voluptatem magnam nuntias, Thou shewest tidinges that be very pleasaunt. 11 Quàm vellem Menedemum inuitauum, vt no∣biscum esset hodiè. How glad would I be that Menedemus had ben desired to bee in cōpainy with vs, or at my house to day. 13 Caue faxis, non est opus pater, Beware doe it not, it is not so expedient father. We may say. Caue faxis, or caue ne faxis, Caue cad as, or caue ne cadas: Fac scribas, or, Fac vt scribas. Cura fiat, or, Cura vt fiat, And it is Eclipsis con∣iunctionis. 14 Incertum est etiam, quid se faciat, He can not yet tell what to doe wyth him selfe. Of such maner speakings as this, Quid se faciat, with others like, it is noted afore, Inceitū est. s. illi. 14 Modò venit, He came but nowe. 15 Time omnia, He feareth all thinges. 15 Misere amat, Hee is very deepe in loue, or, hee loueth desperately. 16 Propter eam haec turba, atque abitio euenit. For her sake hath chaunced all this businesse, or brabling, and going out of the countrey. 17 Seruolum ad eum in vrbē misit, He hath sent a seruaunt into the city vnto him. Seruolum
pro seruulum, per antithesin, Which is when one letter is put for an other. 8 Quem minùs miserū esse, credere est? Whom should a man thinke to bee in a better case, or lesse desperate? 19 Quid reliqui est, quin habeat, quae quidèm in homine dicuntur bona, parentes patria, ami∣cos, genus, cognatos, diuitias? What fayleth or wanteth, but that hee hath al thinges at least∣wise that in man are called and reckened good thinges, that is to say, Father and mother, hys countrey, friends, and honest stocke and degree of birth that he cometh of kinsfolkes, & richesse. 21 Haec perinde sunt, vt illius animus qui ea pos∣sidet, All these things be such, as is the minde of him that hath them in possession. Of the ele∣gāt ioyning of perinde, with ac, atquè, vt quàm quasi, acsi, atquè, si. &c. Reade Hadr. de ser. lati. 22 Qui vti scit, ei bona sunt: illi qui nō vtitur recte mala, To him that knoweth howe to vse them they be good, and to him that can not vse them as they should doe, they be ill. 23 Ille fuit senex importunus semper, That olde foole was euermore vnreasonable. 23 Nihil magis vereor, quàm ne quid in illū ira∣tus plùs satis faxit, I feare nothing so much as this, least that he being moued, & bearing him displeasure, will do some thing vnto him worse than he should doe. 25 Reprimā me. i. tacebo I will hold my peace. 25 In metu esse illi est vtile, It is expedient for him to bee kept in awe.
26 Quid tu tecum? i. loqueris? What sayst thou to thy selfe there? 26 Vtvt erat, mansum tamen oportuir, Howe so euer it was, yet hee ought to haue taried at home and not to haue gone away. The voyce of the particle of the preter Tense is much ta∣ken and vsed per enallegè partium, siue per  for the infinitiue mode of the ac∣tiue voyce. Secundum Donatum, or, of the pas∣stue voyce. Secūdum Priscianum. Salust. Prius▪ quàm incipias consulto, & vbi consulueris, ma∣turè opus est facto, before that a man begin a∣ny thing, hee must first take good aduisement & deliberation and whan hee hath so consulted & taken aduisement, he ought to do it with al ce∣lerity, speede, and expedition where Priscian interpreteth consulto and facto i consuli & fie∣ri. Terent in Hecira. In arcem transcurso opus est. It were expedient to runne and to make a step to the castell. Transcurso▪ Donate expoū∣deth pro transcurrere But in such speakinges as these, Volo datum, factum oportuit, mansum oportuit. &c. Is to be vnderstood (sayth Lina∣cre) the infinitiue mode, esse: So that it be the preter tense of the infinitiue mode passiue. For by them is vnderstanded not onely the action, or, doing of a thing, but also the perfection and ende of a thing, already brought to pas and to a finall ende or effect. &c. 27 Fortasse aliquanto iniquior fuit, Perchase hee was somwhat hard, strait, or vnreasonable. 28 Quem ferret si parentem non ferret suum?
Whom should hee haue suffered or forborne, if he should not haue forborne his owne father. 29 Hunceine erat aequum ex illius more, an illum ex huius viuere? Was it meete that this man should liue, as the other would heue him, or els the other to liue, as pleased this man? 30 Quod illum in simulat durū, id non est? Where as he accuseth him, or layth to his charge, that he is hard or straite, that is not so. In simulare, is properly to lay to ones charge a crime that is not true, but a forged matter. 30 Parentum iniuriae vniusmodi sunt fermè. The strattnesse or hardnesse of Fathers towardes their children, is of one sorte, or after one rate, for the must parte. 33 Ea sunt ad virtutem omnia, All thinges bee to the furtheraūce of vertue, as if he had said, to bring their children to goodnesse. 34 Vbi animus semel se cupiditate deuixit mala, necesse est consilia consequi consimilia, When the minde hath once entāgled & captiued it selfe with an il desire or naughty appetite, it cannot bee chosen, but that semblable counsels & pur∣poses must needes ensue forthwith. 35 Hoc scitum est periculum ex alijs sacere, tibi quod ex vsu siet, It is a noble and goodly sen∣tence or saying, euery man to proue by others, what may bee most expedient, and profitable for himselfe, Scitum. s. dictum. i. praeclarum & doctrina plenum, quae confert ad vitam cum de coro inque officio degēdam: Periculū pro pe∣riealū, per syncopē, Siet pro sit, per epēthesin.
37 Ibo hinc intrò, vt videā nobis quid caenae siet. I will goe hence in, that I may see what sup∣per we haue towarde. 38 Vide, ne quò hinc abeas longiùs. See that thou goe not farre out of the way. Out of the second acte, in the first Scene. 1 Quàm iniqui sunt patres in omnes adolescen∣tes iudices, How vnegall iudges bee fathers against all youngmen. 2 Aequum esse consent, nos iam à pueris illico na∣sci senes, They thinke it reason, that wee euen of litle babes, should by and by become sage old men. 4 Ex sua libidine nos moderantur quae nùnc est, non quae olim fuit, They rule measure and or∣der by their own wilful appetite that they haue nowe, & not that they had many yeares agone, that is, when themselues were younge men as we be now. Libido, libidinis, is sometime takē in bonā partem, as Donate noteth. Sal. in Cat. Eagis{que} in decoris armis & militatibus equis, quam in scortis & conuiuijs libidinem habe∣bant. And they had pleasure and appetyte in goodly harnesse and greate horses for warre, more than in harlots, and in feasting, banket∣ting, or reuelling. 5 Mihi si vnquam filius erit, nae ille facili me vte∣tur patre, If euer I shall haue a sonne in faith he shall haue a very gentill father of mee. 6 Et cognoscendi, & ignoscendi dabitur peccati locus, He shall haue no time to know his fault,
and to haue it pardoned or forgeuen. Ignosco is sometimes a verbe actiue and trāsitiue, and gouerneth an accusatiue, and a dariue, as, For∣geue me this one fault, Ignoscas mihi hoc vnū dilictum. Of such verbes it is noted afore Lo∣cus. i▪ tempus, spacium, sufficient time & space. 7 Mihi per alium often dit suam sententiam, Hee declareth me his owne minde and opinion vn∣der the name and colour of an other person. 8 Adbibit plus paulò, He hath drunken a litle to much, or as we vse to say (in iesting) hee hath taken a pot of maius. 8 Sua narrat facinora▪ Hee telleth of the prankes that he hath played in his dayes. 9 Periculum facito, Proue. 10 Nae ille haùd scit, quam mihi nunc surdo nar∣ret fabulam, In fayth, ful litle woteth hee how deafe I am, or howe ill I can heare nowe in this side, on which he maketh al this clattering vnto me▪ Surdo narrare fabulam, to tell a tale to a deafe body, is a prouerbe to be sayde of them that labour in vayne. And it is the same that we vse to speake prouerbially. When we heare a thing that liketh vs not, saying thus. I can not heare on that side: which may be sayd pro∣perly in latine, Surdo narras fabulam, or Surdo canis. Virg. Non canimus surdis, respondent omnia siluae. 11 Magis nunc me amicae dicta stimulāt, da mihi, atque affer nihil. Now at this time, the sayings of my best beloue goe nere to my stomk, geue me this, and bring me that, &c.
12 Quid respōdeam nihil habeo, I haue nothing in the world, what to make aunswere. Quid pro quod, as quid magnum, for aliquod magnum, or aliquid magni, & albeit it appeare contrary to the nature of quid taken and vsed most commonly for substātiue, and gouerning a genitiue case after him, yet it is an elegant maner of speakinge, and much vsed in probate authors, as well ioyned with Adecties put substantiuely, as also with substantiues, and a greeing with the same in case, gender, and num¦ber, as if it were an adiectiue. Cato de libe∣ris educandis. Si quid his datum sit esculentum. If any thing be geuen them to eate, or that is mans meate. Ci. li. 2. epi. fam. Graué est homini pudenti petere aliquid magnum ab eo, de quo se bene meritum putet, ne id quod petat, exi∣gere magis, quàm rogare, & in mercedis potiùs quàm benefieij loco numerare videatur, It is great payne or griefe to a man that hath any shame in hym, to desire any great thing of him, vnto whom he thinketh himselfe to haue done pleasure afore, least that hee maye seeme that thing, which he desireth rather to exact and to require as due, than to desire, & rather to reckē or accompt the same in place of a due rewarde or wages afore deserued, then in place of a be∣nefite. And so in other examples innumerable which for breuity I omit. 12 Nequè me quisquam est miserior, Nor there is any man liuing more miserable, or in worse case then I am.
13 Suarum rerum satagit He hath enough to doe of his owne, or he hath a busie piece of woorke of his owne to doe. Sat ago, saragis, sategi, sata∣ctum. Is to haue businesse or matters enough to doe. And it is sometimes construed with a genitiue, as here, and somtimes it is put abso∣lutely without any case ioyned with it. And sometimes it signifieth diligentem esse, seu fe∣stinare. To be diligent, or to make busie speede and haste. 15 Mea amica est potens, procax, magnifica, sūp∣tuosa, nobilis. My best beloue or paramour is a woman of good hability, euer crauing, lady∣like, a chargeable, or costly piece, and a gentle∣woman, Procax procacis. i. petax, euer asking & crauing, fourmed of proco, procas, which is po¦scere, to desire, and thereof woers are called in latine proci, as who should say, poscentes vxo∣rem atque ambientes. Destring and demaun∣ding, or asking the wyfe that they woe. 16 Mihi religio est dicere. I dare not say it, or I haue a conscience to speake it. Religio. i. me∣tus. Feare and as (we say) scrupulosity of con∣science, per metaphoram, for religio, properly is the true seruing and worshipping of God, & of holy thinges. Ex Cicero. 17 Hoc ego mali non pridem inueni, nequè etié dum scit pater, It is not longe that I haue perceiued this displeasure or incommodity, nor my father doth not yet knowe it. Inueni. i. in∣tellexi, sensi.
In the second Scene▪ 1 Si mihi secundae res essent. If I were wealthy or in prosperity, or if my fortune were good. 2 Vereor ne me absente mulier corrupta sit, I feare least that the woman hath bene peruerted or made naught, while I haue bene away. 3 Concurrunt multae opiniones, quae mihi anim exaugeant. There come many opinions toge∣ther, that cause my mynde much the more to thinke. Exaugere, is to encrease a thing, and to make it much more than it was, & thereof Ex∣augera animum, is to encrease the opinion of y• minde, and to cause the mynde much the more to bowe, and to encline to that opinion that it was in afore. Per metaphoram. 4 Sub imperio cuius est? Under whose rule or ordering is hee? 5 Illi nihil praeter praecium dulee est, He thinketh nothing sweete but money, or there is nothing sweete vnto him, or in his opinion, but money. 5 Hei misero mihi. Alas that euer I was borne. The interiections, heu, & prôh, gonerne a no∣minatiue case, as heu pietas, heu priscas fides, prôh Iupiter and an accufatiue, as heu me mi∣serum. Prôh deûm at{que} hominum fidem, Hei gouerneth euermore a datiue. 6 Etiam caues, ne videat fortè te à patre aliquis exiens? Wilt thou beware yet againe least per∣chaunce some body coming foorth from thy fa∣ther espy thee? 7 Nescio quid mihi animus praesagit mali, I can not tell how my minde gretueth me, that all is
not well, or that I shall haue some ill chaunce, or I can not tell howe my heart grudgeth a∣gainst some ill to come. Praesagio, sagis praesa∣giui, is to perceiue a thing that is towarde, be∣fore it come, of prae, quod est ante, before, & sa∣gire, hoc est acutè sentire. To be quicke of per∣ceiuing, and smelling, and thereof dogges are called Sagaces, quicke of smelling or senting. 8 Pergin' isthuc prius dijudicare, quàm scis quid veri fiet? Doest thou yet still iudge the matter, before thou knowest what the truth is. 9 Si nihil mali esset, iam hic adesset. If all had bene well, he would haue bene heere ere nowe. 10 Non cogitas hinc longiùs abesse? Doest thou not consider, that is a great way hence. 10 Nosti mores mulierum, dum moliuntur, dum comuntur, annus est, Thou knowest the guise of women, whyle they set forward▪ & while they attyre, pike, and trim themselues, it is a whole yeare. Molior, moliris▪ molitus sum. Is to force a body, and streyne him selfe to doe any thing. Como, mis, compsi, comptum; est ornare. To make gay, or to attyre, or to decke the bush: for in the trimming of the haire consisteth a great part of the beauty of man or women. 12 Respira, Take a good heart. 12 Eccum Dromonem cum Syro vna adsunt tibi Loe yond Dromo & Syrus, they are both heere together. Tibi est datiuus festiuitatis graria ad∣iunctus. Laur. Valla hath obserued, that ecce & en signifle one thing, and be construed indiffe∣rently with a nominatiue case, or with an accu
satiue. Albeit he protesteth, that hee hath not read (at least wyse in any oratour) yea & fewe times in any Poete▪ eccè gouerning an accusa∣tiue Eccum, eccam, eccos, eccas, ellum, ellum, ellos, ellas, the same Ualla expoundeth not by pronounes, contrary to Priscian and others, saying, Eccum▪ i. ecce eum, or ecce hunc, nor el∣lum. i. ecce. illum, nor eccam. i. ecce eam, eccos. i. ecce. eos. ellam. . ecce illam, ellos. i. ecce illos▪ but by aduerbes thus, eccum. i. ecce hie▪ s. eū, &c. ellum. i. ecce illic eum. &c. And eccam. i. ec∣ce hic. s. eam. &c eccos. i. ecce hic. s. eos. &c. ellā i. ecce illic. s. eam &c. ellos. i. ecc illic. s. eos. &c. And therefore they bee ioyned wt an accusatiue of the thing that we will demonstrate a sewe. Terent in Eun. Eccum Parmenonem, eccum me. i. ecce hic Parmenonem, ecce hic me. And here Eccum Dromonem i▪ ecce hic Dromoné, &c. So ellum, Parmenonem i. ecce illic Par∣menonem, vel potiùs ecce illic Parmeno secū∣dum Vallam. In the thyrd Scene. 1 Ain' tu? Sayest thou so in deede? 1 Sic est. It is euen so. 2 Intereà dum sermones cedimus, illi sunt relicti While we haue kept and prolonged communi∣cation, they be lest a great way behinde. Cedi∣mus sermones i. miscemus, ex Nonio. 4 Minimè mirum, adeo impediti snt, ancillatum gregem ducunt secum. It is no meruayle that they haue bene so long in comming they bee so restered, for they bring a whole flocke of may▪
den seruauntes with them. Minimè mirum▪ . est illos tàm tardè aduenisse. 5 Men' rogas? Doest thou aske of mee? 6 Non oportuit relictos, portant quid rerum, It was not well done to leaue thē behind, for they beare some thing of charge about them. 6 Portant aurum, vestem, & vesperascit, & nō no∣uerunt viam, They haue about them both gold, and apparell, and darke night cometh fast on, and they know not the way. 8 Factum à nobis stulte est, It was foolishly, or vnwysely done of vs. 8 Abidum illis obuiam propere, Goe and meete them apace, Abidum pro abi, parelon est, as quisnam pro quis. 9 Vae misero mihi, quanta de spe decidi? Woe is mee vnfortunate Body that I am, out of how great hope am I fallen or brought? 10 Quae res te solicit at? what thig troubleth your minde? Solicitare heere betokereth inquietate, curā inijcere, to disquiet & to make pensife. So in Andr. Cur ego meā senectutē huius solicito amētia? why do I disquiet & vexe mine oldage for his foly? Plau. in Aulu. Quia isthuc facinus quod tuum solicitat animum, id ego feci & fa∣teor. For this deede that troubleth and vexeth thy minde I did my self, & I confesse it. Som∣time Solicitare, to shewe as wel hope as feare. Plin. li. i. epist. Nulla spe, nullo timore▪ solicitos nullius rumoribus inquiêtor. I am not mo∣ued neyther with any hope, nor with any feare, nor I am not disquieted wyth the rumours
or new tales of any mā. Terēt. in Andria, Mis. O∣rare iussit, si se ames, hera, iam vt ad se venias. Vi∣dere ait te cupere, Pamp. Vah perij, hoc malum integrascit. Siccine me atque illam opera tua nūc miseros solicitarier? Mis. My dame bid mee pray you (if ye loue her) to come to her by and by, for shee sayth that shee would very fayne see you. Pamph. Alas woe is mee, this mischiefe is euery day renewed woorse and woorse: is it well done, that bothe I and shee vnhappy Bodyes bee thus brought in hope and feare euery day, by the mea∣nes of thee? Sometime it is to prouoke, or to lye instantly vppon, and to entice one to any thynge. Curtius li. 2. Verum enimuéro cùm modò milite meos litteris ad proditioné, modò amicos ad per∣niciem pecunia soliciet ad internecionem mihi persequendus est. But yet for as much as hee doth egge and entice somewhyle my Souldiours by Letters to betraye mee, and somewhyle my friendes with money and rewardes to slea mee. I must needes pursue him to the death. And So∣licito, is to bee written with one single , excepte in Poetes, which double the same, l, Per epen∣thesin, metri causa. For it is formed à solo, For what other thing is Solicitare then Solo citare, id est Loco mouere? To moue or styrre a thynge out of the grounde that it stoode on. and out of his place. For that Solum doth signifie Locum, who doubteth, since that the etymology of the La∣tine worde Exules, dicantur patriae suae solo pul∣fi? And thereof Solicitare is to turne vp ye groūd in Tiing or Ploughing.
Tibul. Et teneram ferro sollicitauit humum. And because that solum is sayd also of the sea: Therfore soliciere is some tyme taken for na∣uigare. Claud. Et rudibus remis solicitauit aquas. For solum is euery thing that beareth vp and stay∣eth any thing as yt water is solum to the ships, and to the fishes. Virg. Subtrahitur{que} solum. Et Ouid. Omne solum forti patria est, & pisci∣bus aequor. Et volucri vacuo quicquid in orbe paet In which verse uid calleth the ayre so∣lum to the byrdes and the skye is solum, to the starres. Quid. Astra tenent sceleste solum. &c. 10 Rogitas quid siet? Dost thou aske what it is, or what is the matter? 12 Nunc demùm intelligo? I perceiue it now at last, and so I did not afore. Demùm & deni{que} idem significant quod tandam. i. post longam moram: After long tarying as in example. When thou hast wel and perfectlye learned all thinges, then at last and not before thou mayst teach others. Cum omnia perdidiceris, tum de∣mùm, or denique, or tandem, docere alios potes, Secondarilye demùm is taken for omnino vel solum, speciallye when it is ioyned with these pronounes, hic, ille, iste, is, or with these verbes ità, or sic, so that demúm containeth and impor∣teth a certayne excepō of an other thing, thus Ea demùm est gloriosa laudatio, quae a laudatis vitis proficiscitur, That prayse and none els is to a man honour and good name which cometh
and riseth of honest men and prayse worthy. Ità demùm me abs te amari sentiā si huic homini mea causa cōmodauetis, I wil by this meanes and none other, perceyue and thinke, that you loue me hartely wel, yf you do pleasure vnto this man for my sake. Tum demùm te amicum putabo, quum bene∣uolentiam erga me tuam re expertus fuero I wil then and neuer afore thinke thee my frend, when I haue in deede had a profe of thy good wil and harty loue towardes mee &c.? 13 Dij boni quid turbae est? Good Lord what a rable, or trayne, or company is there of them: and sometyme it may be englished thus. Good Lorde what array, or trouble or busines, or a do is there? 13 Acdes nostrae eos vix capient scio. Out house wil scarsely hold them all, I know well▪ or our house wil vneth be able to receyue them all, I am very sure. 14 Quid comedent▪ quid ebibent.? i. quantū. How much wil they eate and drinke? or what meate and drinke wil they spend? 14 Eccos quos volebam. Loe here them that I would haue. How eccos is to be expounded it is shewed a litle afore. 15 O Iupiter vbinàm est fides? O Iupiter wher is honesty, or sure, and faythful keping of pro∣mises becom? ▪ For fides (as saith Cicero lib. , offi.) est dictorum conuentorumque constantia & veritas, ex quo credamas, quia fiat quod dic∣tū est appellatā Fidem. Fides is the substātiall
keeping, and the true and sure agreing of a mans sayinges and couenauntes, and the per∣formance of the same. And therfore let vs be∣leue and thinke verily this to be the very true etimologie, that is to say, the very true reasō, diffinton and interpretatiō of the word fides quia fiat quod dictum est, that such thinges be done indeede that are promised in woord, and when the deedes are aunswerable and agre∣ing vnto the wordes, & sayinges or promises. 16 Tu interea loci collocuple âstire, Thou hast enriched thy selfe in the meane seasō, or thou hast gotten great goodes in the meane tyme. 17 Me in his deseruisti malis. Thou hast forsakē me in this aduersity or distresse. 18 Proptet quam in summa infama sum, & meo patri minus obsequens. For whose cause I am in very great insamy, obicque or scaunder, & m not ruled by my father as I should bee, or do not follow my fathers mynde as I oughte to doe, or lesse obedient to my father theu I should bee. 22 Nemo est miserior me. There is no man more miserable or in worse case then I. 22 Hic de verbis nostris errat, quae hic sumus o∣cuti, This man is deceyued by reason of our words that we haue spoken heere, 23 Aliter amorem tuum atque est accipis, You take your loue otherwyse then it is, we say e∣legantly alitèr, atque alter, ac or alitèr quàm, and aliter nisi, when a negation goeth afore. Se examples in Hadrian.
24 Animus erga te idem est, ac fuit. My minde towardes you, is the same that it hath bene. 25 Quantum exipsa re coniecturam facimus. As farre as we could coniect by, or of the thinge it selfe. 26 Nihil rerum omnium est, quod malim quam me hoc falso suspicarier. There is nothinge in the world that I would bee more glad of, than that I did suspect, surmise, & mistrust thinges falsely and vntrulye. 28 Anus, quae est dicta mater esse ei ante hac, non fuit, The olde woman that hetherto hath bene called his mother, was not his mother. 30 Ea obijt mortem. Shee is dead. 30 Hoc ipse in itinere alteri dum natrat, fortè au∣diui, This did I heare by chaunce as himselfe told it to an other body by the way. 32 Mane, hoc quod coepi primum enarrem, post isthuc veniam. Abyde a whyle let me first of all tell forth this that I haue begone, and then I wil come to thee afterwarde. 34 Vbi ventum ad aedeis est Dromo pultat fores, When we came to the house, Dromo knocked at the dore. Pulto pultas is the same that Pulso pulsas, to knocke, to heate, or to rap, & it is for∣med of the Supine pnltum, which supine the old wryters did vse but now it is out of vse. 35 Aus quaedam prodit. Forth commeth a cer∣tayne old woman. 35 Haec vbi aperuit ostium, continuo hic se conie∣cit in tro ego consequor, As soone as she had o∣pened the dore, he there whippe me in by and
by, and I after, hard at the tayle of him. 37 Foribus obdit pessulum, He bolted the dore. 38 Hinc sciri potuit, aut nusquam alibi quo studio vitam suam te absente exegerit. By this way, or else by no way at all it might be knowē how buystly, or in what occupation hee hath passed and led hys lyfe while you haue bene absent from home. Studio. i. labore opere. Exigere aeta∣tem or tempus and agere aetatem, Is to passe and to spend out the yeares or tyme▪ exigere is foras abigere to driue out of dores. Plaut. Exe∣git omnes foras. Hee droue euerye body out of dores. 40 De improuiso est interuentum mulieri. Wee came vppon the Woman sodaynly or vnware. 41 Ea res dedit existimandi copiā quotidianae vitae cousuetudinem, By that thing wee might east∣ly iudge the daily conuersation of his liuing▪ 42 Quotidianae vitae consuetudo cuiusque ingeni∣uium, vt sit, declarat maxumé, The dayly con∣uersation of liuing, doth very easily and best of all thinges, shew what the disposition of euery body is. Maximè. i. facillime, optimè, and there is the figure antithesis, that is, when one letter is put for an other. As Scribundis prologis, for scribendis, animum aduortite. For aduertite, so here maxume for maximè. 44 Terentem telam studiosè ipsam offendimus. Wee found her at the loome weauing full bu∣silye.

Of which verbes reade Laurentius Valla. lib. 5 Eleg. cap▪ 2 44 Offendimus eam medioctiter vestitam, veste lugubri, We found her meanly or coursely ap∣parelled in a mourning gowne▪ 50 Obsecro ne me in laetitiam frustra conijcias I pray thee do not cast me into great gladnes in vayne. 54 Si haec sunt vera, it a vti credo, quis te est fortu∣natior? If these things be true as I think ve∣rely they bee, what man is more fortunate, or who hath better fortune then thou? 57 Magnum hoc signum est eum esse extra noxā, This is a great signe that hee is nothing cul∣pable or faulty. Noxa secundum festum.

quod extra culpam esse, hoc est noxa, aut culpa vacare not to be in fault, but to be guilties or blameles. Noxa is samtimes takē for dānū hurt or harme, Ouid. lib. 15. Meth. Speaking of the waters of a certayn lake in the coūtrey of Ar∣cadia, which was called Lacus phineus. Nocte nocent potae sine noxa luce bibuntur.

For Spurin a beyng a Soothsayer, had warned Caesar before to beware of the Ides of March, for he should be slaine as that day, and so he was. 59 Disciplina est, eisdē munerarier ancillas primū ad dominas qui affectant viā, This is a schole or this is the fashiō, maner order, or trayn that must be vsed, that is what soeuer person desi∣reth to haue his way made vnto the mistresses must first reward or bride the mayden seruant with semblable thinges as he would geue vn∣to the dames themselues.
Disciplina plinae, is that any disciple or scholler taketh of his mayster, as any fashion or sort of liuing, or of doyng anye manners, or other doc∣trine. And therof it is called a Schole, as in example. Christ did forbid that we should put a way vyolence by vyolence, and byd vs to do good for yll, but now we haue learned another Schole. Christus vim vi repellere prohibuit & bona pro malis reddere praecepit at nūc alia est disciplina, So Disciplina militaris is the fa∣shion that youg souldiers are afore exercised in, and trayned, after to bee made perfect good men of ware, Disciplina gladiatoria, is the preceptes and way of trayning men in the wea∣pons and the Scholes that maysters of fence keepe. Disciplina scholastica is the doctrine that scholers be trayned in by their Maysters, and therof amonge the Philosophers, the diuers sectes are called disciplinae, as disciplina Stoi∣torum is the sect of y• Stockes, Discipla Peri∣pateticorum is the secte of the Peripatetiques and so of others, which had euery of them a sū∣dry fashion, or trayne from an other. So Disciplina meretricia, is the Schole and doctrine that the lyght Huswyues and strum∣pets haue amonges them, and teach it to theyr disciples. Nam ea quoque si dijs placet, artis iam nomen obiuuit.

O that shameles boldnesse that is in the fellow. 73 Non sit sine periculo facinus magnū & memo∣rabile. A great act and worthy memory, is ne∣uer done without peril. Hic & haec memorabi∣lis, & hoc memorabile, a thing worthy to bee had in memory. Plaut. in cap. At erit mihi hoc factum mortuo memorabile. But this act shal bee had in memory, when I am dead and rot∣ten. Col. in prae.

See I pray you, thou gost about to get vnto thy selfe a prayse, glory, or honour by the hasarde aud daunger of my lyfe thou
naughty fellow. Is quaesitum, id est, quaeris. Hoc vide, is a māner of Latine speaking much vsed in Terēce, and Plaut. signifying the same that we say in english in indignation or anger. See I pray you, as afore in Eunucho. Illud vide▪ os vt sibi distorsit carnifex. Se I pray you how the villayne maketh a wrye mouth. Idem in A∣delph. Illuc vide, vt in ipso atticulo oppressit.

If thou be ouerseene in any thing be it neuer so litle, I am vtterly vndone, or I may geue my lyfe for an halfe penny, Of Paululùm quid, or paululùm aliquid propaulùlū aliquod, with other like it is largely shewed. 76 Si sinas dicam, If you woulde let me alone, I would tell you. 77 Quas, malum. ambages mihi narrare occipit What the deuil goinge aboute the bush begin∣neth he to vse in telling his tale? Malū is some∣tyme an interiection, or after Donat▪ an Ad∣uerbe of anger and indignatiō, and is sweetly brought in (sayth Donate.) Cic. lib. 2, off. Preclarè in epistola quadā Alex∣andrum filium Philippus accusat quod largitio∣ne beneuolētiam Macidonum confectur. Quae te malū inquit ratio ipsam spē induxit, vt eos ti bisideles putares fore, quos pecunia corrupisses?
Phillippus kinge of the Macedonians did very nobly rebuke and blame his sonne Alexander, in a certayne Epistle that hee wrote vnto him, where he sayde thus, what (the Deuil) occasiō or cōsideratiō hath brought thee into this hope that thou shouldest thinke that they would be, and cōtinue faythful vnto thee whom thou hast corrupt with money? 78 Ad rem redi, Returne to the purpose or pith of the matter. 79 Euimuerò reticere nequeo, Truly I can not but speake. 79 Multis modis iniuris Clitipho est, neque ferri potis est, Clitipho is vnreasonable many waies, nor any man may suffer, or abyde his vnreaso∣nable fashion. 80 Audiendum hercle est, tace. In faith you must needes here, or you may not choose but heare, hold your peace. 81 Vix potiri tuum esse in potiūdo periclum non vis▪ you would fayne haue your desire & plea∣sure, but you wil abyde none aduenture in la∣bouring for to obtayne it. We say potior, po∣teris, vel potiris, potitus um, And in latine speaking it gouerneth the Genitiue plurall of this noune res, when it is set alone, and notioy∣ned with an adiectiue, and then it signifyeth to beare a rule, and to haue in our dominion. or to gouerne the Empire, as Augusto rerum potito totus quieuit orbis. When Augustus had or ruled the Empyre, al the world was at rest and peace. And in that signification, that is to saye.
betokening to surmount, or to haue in our do∣minion, and vnder our subiectiō, Potior is read and ioyned also with ctrtayne other Genitiues besydes rerum▪ plaut. in cap. Nam postquàm meus rex est potitus hostiū. After that the king my mayster had surmounted his ennemies, and gotten the ouerhand of them. Idem in Epidico, Atque hostium est potita, And shee hath sub∣dued or conquered her ennemies. Salust. Cui fatum foret vrbis potiri, Whose destenye it was to winne, or to obtayne the Cittye, and to bee Lord of it. But of all other casuall wordes, yea, and also of the sayd noune res be∣yng ioyned with any other adiectiue, then such as may appertayn to the significatiō aboue no∣ted, Potior gouerneth an ablatiue case, and then it is to obtayne or get any thinge by labouring, as Potitus sum victoria, I haue gotten the vic∣torye &c. Potior is also reade, gouerning an ac∣culatiue as in olde tyme it was vsed. Plaut. in Asinar. Fortiter malum qui patitur, idem post potitur bonum. He that suffereth and manfully endureth the sowre, shall afterwarde haue the sweete, or, he that doth stoutely abyde the payne for any thing, shal afterward haue the pleasure of the same. Terent in Adel, Ille alter sine labo∣re patria potitur cōmoda, That my other bro∣ther Mitto without any his payne and labour, hath all pleasures, and commodities belon∣ginge to a father or that a father shoulde haue, Ibidem. Miseriam omnem ego capio hic po∣titur gaudia. I abyde all the care sorrow, and
misery, and he hath all the ioy and pleasure. Cic. in Phi. Itaque si receptis illis possumus esse liberi, vincamus odium, pacemque potiamur. Therfore if we may be free, and out of all sub¦iection whan we haue receaued those thinges then let vs ouercome hatred or enmitye, an let vs haue peace. Potior is fourmed of potis & therfore (sayth Valla) they be both very lik in signification, For we say in latine. Sum compos mentis, compos animi, compos rationis, compos sanitatis, when I haue th thinges here rehersed, Also wee say in latin Sum compos voti, compos victoriae, compos optati. When I haue by my labour and indu¦stry gotten or obtayned the said thinges. Imp in significatiō is cleane contrary vnto compos 82 Haud stulto sapis, You are no small foole. 84 Aut haec cum illis sunt habenda, aut illa cu his amittenda. Either thou must be  to haue these thinges together with the other or els to leaue and let goe the other thinges t¦gether with these. 85 Harum duarum conditionum nunc vtrum m uis vide, Now see whether of these condition thou wouldest rather or leauer haue. 86 Cōsilium quod coepi rectum esse & utum  I knowe that the counsayle, or deuyse that haue begone to take, is good, and nothing dan∣gerous. 88 Quod illi es pollicitus eadem haec inuenia via, That that thou hast promised vnto hym
will find out and get by this selfe same waye or meane. 89 Quod vt efficerem, orando surdas iam aures reddieris mihi, Which thinge that I woulde bringe to passe for thee thou haddest alreadye long afore made myne eares dull & deafe, with much desyryng and prayng. 90 Quid aliud tibi vis? what would you els haue? or what would you more haue, 90 Experiūdo scies, By assaying, or prouing thou shalt know, experiundo pro experiendo per a∣ithesin. 91 Age, age, cedo istuc tuum consilium, quid id est, Go to, come one tel vs that thy deuise, what is it? 94 Longum est si tibi narrem, quamobrèm id fa∣ciam. It would be a lōg tale to tel if I should shew you wherfore I should do it. 96 Nihil satis firmi video, quamobrem accipere hunc mihi expediat metū, I see no substantiall cause to trust to, why I should take such a feare or why it should be expedient for me to be thus afeard. Quamobrem is elegantly vsed in such manner speakinges as this. And in the same plate might also haue bene set with like eleg∣cy of latine speaking, cùr, quare, quapropter, or qua causa accordinge to the vse and manner of speakinge of Tullie and others the latine men of olde tyme where as now most men vse com∣monly to say, nihil propter quod and nulla cau∣sa propter quam▪ &c. read examples apud Ha∣drianum.
97 Mane, habeo aliud si ishue metuis, quod  coniteamini sine periclo esse, Abyde I  ymagined, or found out an other thynge if  be afearde of this, which you both wil clearly graunt to be voyd of all peril, or to be without al daunger. Periclo pro periculo per syncop 98 Huius modi obsecro aliquid reperi. Fynd  or imagine some such thing, I pray thee ha¦ly, for Gods sake. 99 Ibo obuiàm illis, dicā vt reuertantur domum, I will goe meete them, and bid them return home agayne. 100 Ademptum tibi iam faxo amnem metum. I wil find the meanes to ryd thee ou of all fear by and by. 100 In aurem vtramuis otiosè dormias, Neue breake any sleepe for the matter hardly. Dorm∣re in vtramuis aurem, in vtrumuis oculum I a prouerbe signifying to be quiet, and nothing troubled in the mind, For such as be in sorrow care or payne, can not sleepe soundly, for the of∣ten recordation of their euils. See Erasm▪ i Chiliad. 101 Quid ago nunc? What is it best for me to do now. 101 Dic modò verum, Tell mee truth, or say truth now, modò properly signifyeth a tyme ve∣ry litle past. But sometymes it signifyeth tyme present or instāt. Sed rarò inqui donaus in He cyra▪ Plau. in Sticho. Deos salutabo modò▪ po∣steà ad e continuo transeo. I will now say my deuotions to the Gods, and than I wil come o∣uer to

Modò dolores metu occipiunt primulùm, O good sweete nourse, the paynes of trauayling of my daughter doe now first begin a litle, and heere immediately following. 103 Datur modò, fruare dùm licet, nàm nescias, eius sit potestas posthac, an nūquam tibi, Now thou mayst haue it, vse it while thou mayst, for thou canst not tell, whether it shall euer hereaf∣ter come any more to thy hāds again or neuer. 106 Verum herclè isthuc est, In deede truth it is that you say. 107 Adsum, dic quid est, Heere I am, el me what is the matter. 108 Iam ho quo{que} negabis tibi placere, Thou wilt say anone, yt thou likest not this neither. 108 Me, & meam famam permitto tibi, I cōmit both me and my name, fame or honesty, whol∣ly vnto you, or, I put my selfe & my good name and fame wholy in your handes. 110 Ne quid accusandus sis? vide. See that thou bee not blame worthy. Accusandus, is heere a noūe. For participles be foure maner of waies chaunged into the natur of nounes. First whē they be compoūded with such wordes as their verbes be not: as innocens, indoctus, insipiens, for wee doe not say innoceo, indoceo, nor insi∣pio. Secondarily, when they gouerne after thē and other case, than ye verbe that they come of: as, aeris abundans, amans vini, fugitans litium, pecuniae cupiens. For whē they be participles
they gouerne the cases of their verbes. Third∣ly, whan they forme of them all the degrees of comparison: as amans, amātior, amantissimus, doctus, doctior, doctissimus. Fourthly, whā they betoken no time, as amandus. i. amari dignu, Worthy to be loued, accusandus. i. accusai dig∣nus. Worthy to be shent or blamed. 111 Ridiculum est isthuc me admonere, quasi ist∣hic minor mei res agatur, quàm tua, It is a mad thing that thou wilt warne or tell mee of this, as though the matter did not appertaine to me, as much as to thee, or did not touch me as nighly as thee. Read the prouerbe. Tues agitur, in Chiliadibus. Eras. 113 Hic si quid nobis fortè aduersi euenerit, tibi erunt paata verba, huic homini verbera, If a∣ny thing shal happely chaunce vnto vs in this matter other wyse▪ then well, thou shalt percase here of it, but it is I, that shalt abie for it, or if we shall haue any ill chaunce in this matter, thou shalt nothing but bee chydden for it, and haue woordes, but it is this body of mine that shall abde or haue the strokes. 115 Neutiquàm res hac neglectui est mihi. I do not passe light on this matter, or I do not en∣tende to be negligēt, or to sleepe in this matter. 117 In eum iam res redijt locum, vt facere sit ne∣cesse. The matter is now come to that pote that I may not chose but do it. 118 Merito t amo, My loue is well bestowed on you. 119 Perdocta est probè, Shee can her lessō well
enough, or shee is taught her lesson in the bests wise I warrant you. 120 Hoc dmiror, qui tàm facilè potueris per∣suadere illi, This I marueile greatly at, howe thou couldest so soone perswade, or bryng him in minde. 122 In tempore ad eum veni, quod rerum om∣nium est primum, I came vnto him in season, which thing is the chiefe and principall of all thinges. Reade the prouerbe, Nosce tempus, in Chiliad Erasm. 124 Arte tractabat virum, id est, hominem, He handled the felow craftely or subly 126 Vt esset apud te ob hoc quàm gratissimus, That he might bee in very good fauour wyth thee for the same. 127 Sed hens tu, vide sis ne quid imprudens tuus, But sirrha, see that you play no wylde touch ere you be ware, or forgetting your selfe. Vide sis, the particle sis, is as much as si vis, & is put for it oft times, as sodes for si audes, or sultis for si vultis. And it is much vsed for an aduerbe of exhorting, or els other whyles for a voice ex∣pletiue, so that it is parelcon. And it is also vox enclitica, that is to say, it causeth the word afore going, to be accured. Plau. in Amph. Iam sequere sis, herum qui ludificas dictis deliranti∣bus. Come after me at ones, thou whych moc∣kest me, being thy maister with thy fash say∣inges. It is vsed sometime also in oratours. Cic. pr sexto Roscio. Age nūc refer anim ū is ad verioatē. Wel goe to now, returne thy minde
to the very plaine truth of the matter. Impru∣dens. i. incogitans, vnware, vnaduised, for fault of remembraunce and cōstderation. Ruas. i. im∣modestè agas, gerasue quasi temerarius. 128 Patrem nouisti. ad has res quam sit perspi∣cax, Thou knowest thy father howe quicke of sight he is in such thinges, and how sone he cā espy them. 129 Ego te noui, quàm esse soleas impotens, I knowe thee howe wilde and without stay thou art wont to be, and vnable to rule thy self. Im∣potens is he that cannot maister, rule, refrain, staye, or measure the affections, passions, or desires of the minde, but passeth reason, & kee∣peth no measure or meane. whether it be in an∣ger, ioy, sorrowe, pleasure, or els what. Ter. in An. Adeò impotenti esse animo, vt praeter ciuiū morem atquè legem & sui voluntatem patris, tamen hanc habere studeat cum summo pro∣bro? Should he be so arre out of reason, bee∣yond himselfe, or so outragious, that he should labour and goe about to haue her to his wife, against the vsage & custome of all honest men in the city, and against the lawe, and contrary to the minde or will of his owne father? 130 Inuersa verba, euersas ceruices uas gemitus screatus, russeis, risus, abstine, Thy stumbling or tripping in thy wordea, speaking one thing for an other, thy streiching or putting forth of thy necke thy sighing, spitting, coughing, and laughing, or giging or will spering, forbeare thm. Inuerto, tis, verti, inuersum, is to turne ye
contrary syde outwarde, as of a furre, or of a cay▪ or any other thinge, and thereof inuertere verba▪ est praepostere aliquid efferre. To pro∣nounce woordes and to bring them out, so that we speake one thing for an other▪ as they vse to doe whose tongues cōmonly speake that thing, vpon which their minde runneth most. 132 Laudabis me, Thou shalt con me good thāke. 133 Quam cito nos consecutae sunt muliecs. Howe soone the women haue ouertaken vs. 135 Nihilo magis, Nere a deale the rather. 137 Abeas si sapis, Get thee hēce if thou wise be. 138 O hominem faelicem, O happy man that e∣uer he was borne. In the fourth Scene. 1 Edepol te laudo, & fortunatū iudico, cum stu∣duisti▪ isti formae mores vt consimiles forent. Truely I commende thee, and thinke thee for∣tunate or happy, that thou hast so endeuoured thy selfe, that thy Conditions and behauioure might be according, or aunswerable vnto thy beauty. 3 Minimè miror, si te sibi quis{que} expetit. I mer∣uayle nothinge at all, that euery man desireth greatly to haue you. 4 Mibi, quale ingenium haberes, in dicio fuit ora¦tio, Your cōmunication well notified vnto me, of what disposition you were. 5 Cum mecum in animo vitam tuam considero, When I consider thy manner of ining in my mynde. 7 Et vos esse istiusmodi, & nos non esse, haud mi∣rabile
est, That you bee such as you are, an wee not, it is no meruayle at all. 11 Nobis prospectum est We be prouided for. 11 Deserti viuimus, we liue as folkes al forsakē. 14 Hoc beneficio vtrique ab vtrisque verò deuin∣cimini, vt nunquàm vlla amori vestro incidere possit calamitas, By ye good help of this thinge you be in such wise bound eyther to other, that no mishap may at any time chaūce in your loue or frendship, as who should say, that there can no misfortune befall, able to breake and to vn∣doe the loue that is betwene you. Lau. Val. Ve∣ry well she weth, that Cicero or Quintilian, ne∣uer vsed to say neuter neutri, nor properly v∣terque vtrique, but vter{que} alteri, as Ci. in prae∣fatione officiorū. Eodemque modo de Aristo∣tele & Isocrate iudico, quorū vter{que} suo studio delectatus, contempsit alterum. And the selfe same wise I iudge of Aristotle and socrates, of whom eyther delighting and taking singu∣ler pleasure and felicity in his own study (that is to for Aristotle in Philosophile, & Isocra∣tes in Rhetorick) dispised the other. Quintil. Cum vterque alteri obijciat, palàm est vtrun∣que feeisse. Since that either of them layeth it to others charge, it is manifest and open, that both the one and the other of them did it. Yet neuerthelesse Terence in Phormione sayeth, Quia vterque vtrique est cordi. Because that both lyke eyther other very well. And also in the tenth Booke of the Commentaries of the
Iestes of Caesar (which booke it is doubled, whether Hercius, or Oppius, did wryte) Inte∣rim dissensione orta inter Achillē & Arsionen, cum vterque vtrique insidiaretur, & summam imperij ipse obtinere veilet. &c. In the meane season dissention, strife, and debate, arising be∣tweene Achilles and Arsione, when eyther of them layde wayte to destroy other, and desired to get & haue the chiefe rule of the whole Em∣pyre him selfe▪ &c. 16 Nescio alios, me scio sem per fecisse sedulò, vt ex illius commodo meum compararem com∣modum, I knowe not other men, but my selfe I know, that I haue right diligētly endeuou∣red & applied my selfe to get & to esteme my cō∣modity by his cōmodity, or in such wise that it might alwayes stande together with his com∣modity. 19 Omnes mihi labores fuere, quos coepi, leues, Al the labours yt I toke, me thought but light. 22 Vt patrem tuum vidi esse habitum diù, etiàm duras dabit. As farre as I haue seene thy fa∣ther, or, as I haue scene thy Father disposed this long whyle, hee wyll yet deale hardly, or roughly with thee. Duras. s. partes afore in Eu¦nu▪ Duras fratris partes praedicas. My brother is in hard case by thy sayinge. Duras alicui partes dare, Is to handle a body hardly, and it is a proper maner of latine speaking of lyke sense, as we halfe prouerbially say in English, to geue one the worse ende of the staffe. 23 Quisnam hic est, qui intuetur nos? What fel∣low
is this same heere, that beholdeth vs, or looketh on vs? 24 Amab, quid tibi est? I pray you, what ay∣leth you? Est i. accidit. 24 Quid stupes? Why art thou astonyed? 25 Video ne Cliniam, an non? Haue I espied or doe I see Clinia or not? 25 Quem vider? Whom seest thou? or whom hast thou espyed? 26 Salue anime mi, vt vales? God saue you mine owne sweete heart, how fare you? 27 Saluum te venisse gaudeo, I am right glad & ioyous that you bee come home safe & in good heath. 27 Teneò ne te maximè animo exoptate meo. Oh whom my heart doth most desire, haue I, or doe I holde you in mine armes? (as who shoulde say) I am sure that I touch you, and that you bee heere? 29 Ite intrò nàm vos iamdudùm expectat senex, Goe yee in, for the olde man looketh for you, or tarieth for you, & hath done a good whyle. Of dudùm, pridem, nupèr, iamdudùm, and iampri∣dèm, and the vse of them in latin speaking, it is shewed afore.

Si hoc celetur patri in metu sum. If this be kept, or hidden to my father, I am in feare.

Verg. li. 12. Aeneid, Haud quanquàm dictis vio∣lentia Turni flectitur, exuperat magis, aegrescijt∣{que} medendo. The indignation or fiercenes of Turnus might in no wise be bowed, mitigated, asswaged, or pacified with any the woordes or counsaile of Latinus, but arose, swelled, and stil

But if in the processe of time, y• the disease begin to be rawer & rawer, &c. Sor∣desco is to waxe more and more filthy. Conce∣nesco to waxe older, and not to begin to be old, and so of Macesco acesco, nigresco, albesco, ta∣besco, With other verbes in sco, yet heere it is to be noted, that many in sco, haue the significa∣tion of their primatiues, and be vsed for them: as conticesco for cōticeo, adhaeresco for adhae∣reo, delitesco for deliteo, concupisco for concu∣pio, obdormisco for obdormio.

Omnes. s. nos, wher note one of the figures of grāmatical instruction, that is called in Latine euocatio, which is as oftentymes as the thyrd persō is immediatly reduced vnto the fyrst per∣son, or els to the second, as Ego pauper laboro, cum tu diues ludas, I beynge poore do labour, whereas thou beynge riche doest play, Where note that in euocation be foure thinges requy∣red. Fyrst, Persona euocans, which is euermore the fyrst or the second person, secondarily per∣sona euocato which is alwaies the third pesō, thirdly that the sayd third person bee ioyned vnto the first person or second as aforesayd, immediatly that is to say, no māner comunctiō comming betweene. And fourthly that the verbe be of the first person or of the second, ac∣cording euermore Cum persona euocante, as in the example aboue alledged, euidently it ap∣pereth. And euocation is of two sortes, eyther explicita, as when both persona euocans & also persona euocata, be expressely set out, or els im∣plicita that is where persona euocans is vnder stood, aud not expressed, Virgil. Coram quem metitis, adsum Troius Aeneas, I Aeneas of Troy, whom ye seeke, am heere in presence. Oui. Penelope cōiux sē{per} Vlisses ero, Penelope
will euer during my life, be the wife of Vlisses onely. In which both examples ego being per∣sona eucans, is not expressed but vnderstāded. Though Priscian thinke this oration of Ap∣polonius scribo, to be in congrue. Note further that in euocation, persona euocans, & persona euocata. Albeit, they bee euermore of one case, yet some∣times they bee of diuers numbers, as whan persona euocata lacketh the singuler member: as Ego tu deliciae isthuc veniā. I thy golpolle, or▪ I thy delight and pleasure will come hither where thou art: or els when persona euocata, is a noune collectiue, that is to say, whē it sig∣nifieth plurality, or a multitude in the singu∣ler number. Plin. in praefo. nat. histo, Magna pars studiorum amoenitates quaerimus. A great parte of vs seeke delectable and pleasaunt stu∣dies. Also when persona euocata is a noune distributiue, Ouid. In magnis laesi rebus vter. que sumus. Wee both offended, il serued or vio∣lated in no small thinges▪ Terent in Adelphis. Curemus aequam Vter{que} partem, Let vs care egally either for his owne part: where Nos v∣terque sumus, and nos vterque curemus be euo∣cation. 75 Quodcunque inciderit in mentem, volet, Whatsoeuer shall fall in hys mynde, or in his brayne, he will desire needes to haue it. 75 Neque id putauit prauumne an rectum sit  petet Nor hee will not regard this, whether it be ill or els good and honest y• hee shall desire.

Hee will threaten by and by, that he wil go his way from thee and forsake thee. 81 Videre verum, atquè, ità, vti, res est dicere. Thou seemest to say trouth, and euen so as the matter is in deede. 82 Somnum hercle hac nocte oculis nō vidi me∣is, dum id quaero, tibi qui filium restituerem. In faith I slept not one winke this night stu∣dying and deuising howe I might get▪ brynge home and restore thy sonne to thee againe. Qui id est, quomodò. Ioan. Calphurnius noteth here a proper difference betwene redditur & restitui¦tur, saying: Redditur quis cupientibus, vt domi∣no, seruus, restituitur cupiens, vt patriae ciuis? et redditur & restituitur cupiens cupientibus, vt patri filius. And in these woordes. Oculis non vidi, is a figure of speaking called pleonas∣mus, whych is when an oration hath any su∣perfluitie of words more than needeth, as Ver. Vocemque his auribus hausi, I heard a voice
with these eares. Id & sic ore locutus est. And thus she spake with her mouth. For we do not heare but with our eares, nor speake but with our mouthes, nor see but with our eyes. 84 Cedo dexteram, Geue me thy hande. 84 Te oro vt id facias, I pray thee hartelye do it, 85 Paratus sum, I am ready. 85 Scin'quid nnnc te facere volo?

Let them not perceyue that wee bee agreed betweene our selues.
92 Paululum negotij mihi obstat, I haue a little businesse that letteth me. 93 Simus & Crito vicim nostri ambiguunt de fini∣bus. Simus and Crito our neighbours, are at a little variaunce or controuersye about their landes. De finibus. id est, de Limittibus of the boundes or markes wher the grounds do part and bee deuyded the one mans lande from the others. 94 Me coepere arbitrum, They haue made mee vmpier and iudge betweene them, coepere. i. fa∣cere. elegere arbiter (sayth Donatus) dabatur ijs qui de finibus regendis ambigerent.

I will goe and shew them that I cannot attend on them this day. 96 Continuò hic adero, I wil be here agayne by and by. 95 Ita quaeso, So I pray you hartely. 96 Dij vostram fidem.

In the matter of our owne we be letted, that is to say, blynded, that wee can∣not see or iudge by reasō either of to much ioy∣fulnesse, or els of sorrow, woefulnes, and dis∣quiet of the mind.

In the second Scene. 1 Hac illac circum cursa, Runne about this way and that way. 1 Inueniendum est argentem, I must find out, or get a summe of money. 2 Intendend a in senem fallacia▪ s▪ est. I must find some wyle to deceaue the old man▪ It is a metaphore taken oft he stretching of the
senewes, or of stringes in a bow or lute, or o∣ther instrument. For Intēdo, dis intēdi, intentū is to stretch, or to rech, as a man doth stretch the string of a bow, or of a Lute. And therfore by translation it is sayd in latine intendere vo∣cem, to strayne the voyce, that is, to speake as loude as a man may reach, & intentio vocis, is to strayne the voyce. Intendere animum aut in∣genium, or intendere neruos animi vel ingenij▪ is to strain the mynd or wit, that is to geue ve∣ry exact aduertisement of the raynd, or of the wit, and to proue the same to the vttermost. So intendēda in senē fallacia, is as much as if hee should haue sayd in English▪ I must strayne a sinew or stretch a vayn, to beguile the oldman. Of Intendo read in Laur. val. lib. 6. eleg cap. 4. 3 Nū me fefellit hosce id struere? was I de∣ceiued when I sayd that these felowes wente about such a thing▪ Here is also a metaphore takē of builders. For struo, struis struxi, structū, is to build or to make a frame: and thereof by translation struere ignem, is to make a fyer, struere fallaciam, to imagine a wile. Struere mi∣lite apud Titum Liuium, to set souldiours in array, for iustruere &c. 4 Est ille tardiusculus, He is somewhat slow. 5 Hule nostro tradidia est prouintia the matter is committed vnto this fellowe of myne, or to my man here to do. The Romaynes of old tyme called in latine prouinciam anye out region of farre countrey that they had subdued vnto their
dominion, empire, and iurisdiction, and helde y• same their iurisdiction by a liuetenant, sent thi∣ther to gouerne and rule it. And because that those persons which were admitted and sente by the Romaynes thither as officers, and wt commission, and with great charge, therfore the very office it selfe of ruling in any prouīce was also called in Latine prouincia, and therof by a Metaphore all the burden, labour or businesse of doing in any manner office, or thinge to bee done is called in Latine speaking prouincia, as heere. And also in Phormione. O Geta pro uinciam durā, O Geta thou hast taken in hand, or take vppon thee a great, or harde matter to do. &c. 6 perij, Numnam haec audiuit? Alas that euer I was borne hath he heard al this? 7 Quid tu isthi, s▪ agis? What makest thou there? or what dost thou there? Note heere the diffe∣rence betweene these three pronounes, hic, iste, and ille with their aduerbes deryued of thē, hic haec, hoc, hîc, hînc, hanc, hanc, horsùm, With all other deriuatiues and compounds of the same, as hiccine. &c. in Latine speaking be preferred vnto the first person that is to saye▪ vnto the speaker, iste, ista. istud, istic, istinc, istuc, isto, is∣torsum istac, &c. Bee referred vnto the seconde person, that is to the party that the speaker speaketh vnto. Ille, la, lud, illic, illinc, illâc, illûc, illorsùm illo, Be referred vnto thee thyrd personne, that ys neyther vnto the speaker,
nor vnto him that hee speaketh vnto, but to the thyrd from them both, as I wryting from Lō∣don to my frend beyng in Oxeforde, that wee might meete for to ryde togeather vnto Yorke, may write thus vnto him. Iampridē istuc pro∣fectus essem, nisi me hic occupationes me deti∣nerent. Tu igitur mature istinc te mouere at∣que huc primo quoque tempore aduolare quo possimus vuà illò, quo decreuimus proficisci, I had a great whyle since commen thither (that is to Oxford where thou art) but that certayne busyness that I haue, kepe and withhold mee, heere in London. Therefore hye thou, and spe∣dely bestir thee to come away from thence, that is from Oxeford aforesayd, and in all hast pos∣sible to come hyther to London, to the end that we may both together take our iourney thither as wee appoynted, that is to Yorke. 7 Equidem te demiror tam mane, s. surrexisse, aut foris in publico conspici qui heri tantum bibe∣ris, I maruaile greatly that thou art vp, or that thou commest abroade so earlye to day, which drankest so much or so deeply yesterday. 9 Visa est, quod dici solet, aquilae senectus, Mee thought I saw an olde Aegle (as the prouerbe sayth) A quilae senectus, the old age of an Aegle is a Latine prouerbe vsed to bee spoken of olde men, or others that liue more by drinke then by meat, Plin. li. 10. na. hist. cap. 3. of the nature of Egles sheweth that Egles dye, or perish ney∣ther for age, nor by reason of any sickenesse,

The mode or manner of promising, that a thing shall bee, Pomponiua calleth it Futurum exactum, whych the Greekes expounde by the participle of y• preter perfite tense, ioyned with the future tense of the verbe substanue, eso∣ma:. And the Latyne men in verbes deponen∣tes, as Ero locurus. And Linacre in his first booke De emendata structura, or, De octo par∣tibus.

the verbe three tenses, that ys to weete, the pre∣sent tense, the pretertense, and the future tense▪ And euery of these he put to bee of two sortes, that is to weete, the one vnperfite and the other perfite. The present tense vnperfite▪ as Scribo, I wryte, or I am in wryting, so that the action of wryting is not yet accomplished nor finished The present tense perfite, as Scripfi, I haue writtē, or I haue done wryting, so that the said action of wryting is finished and done. And in lyke wyse the preter tense vnperfite, as Scribe∣bam, I dyd wryte, or I was in writing, the ac∣tion or doyng therof not yet past. The preter∣tense perfice, as Scripseram, I had writtē, or I had done, or ended wrytinge. Also the Future tense vnperfite, as Scribam, I will, or shall wryte the action of wryting not yet begunne. The future tense perfite, as Scripsero, I shall haue written, or I shall haue done wryting the action of wrytyng already begunne and entred, but yet not ended. 23 Vin▪ tu homini stulto mihi auscultare?

Hold in, keepe downe, or tame thou those hands of thyne from henceforth. Comprimitio is y• im∣peratiue mode, and the present tense. For Lina∣cre in the first booke. De emenstruct. Uerye wel poureth that the imperatiue mode hath no future tense. First for that the Greekes hath no future tense in this mode. secōdarily, for the voyces of the Imparatiue mode endinge in to, tote, and tor, may be ioyned with aduerbes of
the future time. Thirdly, for that the same vos∣ces in to, tote, tor, bene founded ioyned with o∣ther voices of the same imperatiue mode, which all Grammarians confesse and say to be of the present tyme, as Propertius.

In the third Scene. 1 Nulla mihi res posthac potest iam interuenire tanta, quae mihi aegritudinem afferat, It is not possible for any thing to come in my waye now from henceforth so greate that may greeue my hart, or cause me to be sad. 2 Tanta laetitia oborta est. s. mihi. So greate ioy and gladnes is chaunced, or come vnto me 3 Dedo patri me nūc, vt frugalior sim quam vult▪ I yeeld my selfe now vnto my father, or I put my selfe now in my fathers handes to be more honest man, and of better rule then hee woulde haue me to be. Frugalior is the comparatiue, & Frugalissimus, the superlatiue of Frugi, and not frugalis, which is no pure, good nor, vsual la word as may be taken of Quintilian. li. i. instit orat. But in the styde or place of Frugalis, the Latine authors vse Frugi, of all genders, and vndeclyned, and Frugi properly signifyeth him that is temperate & measurable in his diete, or manner of liuing of his body and sometimes in
apparayle and other semblable thinges, as in playne cōtrary signification luxuriosus, is vsed apud Senecam, who saith Luxurioso frugalitas poena est. Vnto a riotous person sober liuinge or good rule is a great paine. And apud quinti. who hath a declaration de duobu filiis, frugi, luxurioso{que} of two sonnes the one sober and of good rule in liuing, and the other riotious and of ill rule. Frugalitas in greeke is called sophro∣sini, and frugi homines be called in greeke chri∣simoi that is vtiles, sobrij, & necessarij. Profita∣ble, sobre, and necessary. Cicero. li. 3. Tus. quaest. Of the significatiō of these two words frugali∣tas, and frugi saith thus: Sed quià nèc qui prop¦ter metum presidiū relinque, quod est ignauiae, nec qui propter auaritiam clàm depositum non reddit, quod est iniustitiae: nec qui propter te∣meritatem male rē gessit, quod est stultitiae fru¦gi appellari solet, eas tres virtutes, fortitudinem iustitiam, & prudentiam, frugalitas cōplexa est ergo frugi hominem bonum, et virtute praeditū intelligimus, Cuius cōtrarium est nequè, cuius significatio vna est, quòd sit libidinis intempe∣rans, altera, quod ad nihil bonus sit, sed planè malus. But for because that neither hee, which for feare forsaketh his garrison, which to do is a poynt of dastardnesse or cowardnesse, nor hee that for auarice or courtous desire and loue of goods, mony or any other thinge, being riue∣lye and without any witnesse present, put and layde in his custody to keepe, doth not restore, but withhold, when it is required and asked a∣gayne,
which is vntrue and vnrighteous dea∣ling, neyther hee that for temerity or willfull rashenesse and lacke of discretion, hath had e∣uill luck and misaduēture or misfortune in his matters or affayres (specially in battaile) which is a token and the property of foolishnesse, be∣cause that no such person is commonly or vsu∣ally called in latin frugi. Therefore this latin worde frugalitas, in signification conteyneth & betokeneth as much as all these three vertues: that is to weete, hardynesse, righteousnesse, or true and vpright dealing, and also prudence or much knowledge & experience of thinges. So it followeth, that when wee say in latin Frugi homo wee vnderstand thereby a good and ho∣nest man, and endued with manhoode and ver∣tue. And the contrary of the same latin woorde frugi, is nequā, the which woorde nequam hath two significations, in the one signification it i a mā that is leacherouse, and of misseliuing of his body. In the other signification Nequam is he that is good for nothinge, but euen a ve∣ry naughty vnthrift. Columelli eiusdem agi∣litatis, homo frugi, melius quàm nequam faci∣et. If there be two mē of semblable and equal agility or wildynesse and bee sturting of them∣selues, an honest fellow shal doe any thing that hee is set vnto, better then shall an vnthrifty fellow or a naughty packe. 4 Nihil me fefellit.

Of quid me fiat, wyth other like maner of speakings, it is shewed afore. 40 Tantum sat habes? Art thou cōtented or satis∣fyed with that alone?
40 Quid tum quaeso? What then I pray you? 40 Si hoc pater resciuerit, If my father shal haue knowledge of this. 41 Quid si redeo ad illos? What & if I goe back agayne to them? 41 Quid si coelum ruat?

Eras. 41 Metuo quid agam, I feare what I may doe. 42 Metuis? quasi non ea potestas sit tua, quo veli in tempore vt te exoluas, Doest thou feare as though it lay not in thine owne power to deli∣uer thy selfe whan thou art disposed. 43 Rem facias palam, Vtter breakeopen, or dis∣close the matter, or out with it. In the fourth Scene. 1 Me promissa hùc induxerunt. Fayre wordes haue perswaded mee to this: or, fayre promy∣ses brought mee in minde to come hether. For the latine woorde may bee taken in both those sences. 2 Quòd si is nùnc me deceperit, sepè obsecra me vt veniàm, frustrà veniet; That if he shall now beguile me, many a time hereafter, though be pray mee neuer so fayre to come thyther he shall come in bayne. 4 Cùm me venturum dixero, & constituero, cùm is certò renunciarit, When I shall haue sayd that will come, and shall haue appointed whē and when hee shall haue brought sure woord agayne. 5 Cum spe pendebit animi, ac non, veniam, H

Pompa, pae, is any maner of glorious, or solemne ostentatiō or shew, and that as well in prosperity or in a triumph, as also in aduer∣sity, as in funerals. Laur.

In the fifth Scene. Menedemi vicem miseret me, I haue pity on the ill chaūce of Menedemus. We say in ye sin∣guler number vicem, and vice, and no more: in the plural number it hath al cases. Some grā. marians deriue and forme vices of the word vi, which in olde time was much taken and yet is Pro pugnis, for fighting: as when wee sayde in latin. Vim mihi intulit, He layd violent hands on mee, and fought with mee, Vim sibi intulit, He kilde himselfe. In the same signification is vices vsed in Plautus, where he sayth: Vices e∣ius memorat, & cicatrices denudat. Hee telleth of the battailes that he hath foughten, and dis∣couereth or sheweth open the scarres or printe of the woundes that he had. Sometimes vices is taken Pro paenis, & incommodis, for punish∣ment and mischaunces, displeasures, or aduer∣sity Hora. li. i. carm. Vices{que} superbae te maneāt ipsum. Somtimes Pro periculo, for daunger & ieopardy. Ver. Nec tela, nec vllas vitauisse vi∣ces
Danaū. Sometimes Pro loco, for the plate or steede Horat. Var vice cotis, acutum redde∣re quae ferrum valet excors ipsa secandi I will bee in steede of a Whetstone, whych hath po∣wer to make kniues sharp, and yet it selfe hath no such property, that it can cut, Laur. valla in annotac. contra. Ra. Toucheth the difference be¦tweene Dolere alicuius casum, and Dolere vi∣cem. 2 Miseret me, tantum deuenisse ad eum mali, It pittieth mee, y• so great a misfortune hath chaū∣ced vnto him. 3 Ita magno desiderio fuit ei filius. He hath lōged so greatly for his soone. Desidero, ras, raui▪ is to long for, and thereof commeth desiderium. 4 Hosce aliquot dies non sentiet. For these few dayes hee shall not feele it. 6 Verum vbi videbit tātos sibi sumptus domi co∣tidianos fieri, nec fieri modū, optabi. rursùm, vt abeat ab se filius, But when he shal perceiue that hee shall be dayly at so great charges, and therein like to be no measure nor ende, hee will wishe that his sone were gone from him againe Antonius Nebr. In that his booke, whych hee intituled Lexicon iuris ciuilis, sheweth and pro∣ueth that Cotidie and cotidianus shoulde bee written with c. and not with q. Ab in appositiō is read, not onely set afore wordes beginning with vowels, but also with wordes beginning with almost al cōsonants: apud Platum. Te∣rentium, Liuium, and others playnely appea∣reth.
8 Sirum optimè eccum. Loe here is Syrus mer∣uaylous well, or as well as can bee. 9 Cesso hunc adoriri? Am I slacke or am I not quicke to se on him? Adoriri is to come vpon a man sodenly, as though a wayte were layde afore. 10 Te mihi iam dudùm exoptabā dari. I desired to haue thee meete wt mee a good while agone: or I woulde very fayne haue had thee meete wt me a good while since, of ye vse of Iamdudùm it is shewed a fore. 11 Videre egisse iàm nescio quid cum illo. Mee thinketh thou hast bene in hād with him about something, what soeuer it is. 12 Dictum ac factum reddidi. I dispatched it with a worde, or in the turning of an hand (as who should say) I did no rather mooue the matter nor speake of it, but it was done by and by, Al∣beit. Eras. in chil. Interpreteth and expoundeth this prouerbe to signifie all maner diligence & labour necessary to the doing or bringinge to passe of any thing. For he sayth that dictum ac factum is a prouerbiall speaking, by which is signified, that wee haue not omitted or let passe any thing belonging to the furtherance or per∣fourmaunce of any matter or busines. And his example he bringeth in this place of Terence which in y• scene may be englished thus: I haue done asmuch as is possible, or as may be dōe in y• matter. Donatus saith, Dictū ac factū to be a prouerbial speakīg, betoknīg celeriti & speed in
doing or dispatching of a thing. Terent. in An. act. 2. sc. Haec sola est mulier, Dictum a factum, inuenerit aliquis causam, quamobrem eijciat oppid, This Glicery is alone woman. Some will not fayle, hut at once with ye turning of an hand, to finde some quarel or other to driue hi out of the towne. And in the first scene of the fift act, in the same comody. Dictum factum hùc abit Clitipho, and by and by commeth thyther Clitipho. 13 Bona ne fide? s. fecisti. Didest thou it fayth∣fully▪ substantially, trustely, or earnestly? 13 Non possum pati, quin caput tibi demulcean I cannot forbeare, but I must needes stroke thy heade. The selfe same thing may besayd al∣so by facere thus. Non possum facere quin ca∣put tibi demulceam, And without eyther of both thus. Non possum quin caput▪ demulceā. Faciam boni tibi aliquid pro ista ac lubens. I will do thee some good turne for this that thou hast done, and that with all my heart. 16 Si scias quam scitè in mentem venerit. If thou knewest howe properly it came in my mynde. 17 Vah, gloriare euenisse exsentētia? Auaūt, dost glory, crake, or make thine auaunt▪ that it hath chaunced as thou▪ wouldest? 18 Nòn herclè verò▪ Verum dico. Nay in faith I say truth. Herclè verò bee aduerbes of confir∣ming and auouching. 23 Ausculta quod super est fallaciae. Here that is behinde more of his sutilty or falshoode.
24 Sese ipse dicet tuam vidisse filiam, eius sibi cō∣placitam formam postquam aspexerit, Himselfe will shewe you, that he hath seene your daugh∣ter, & that her beauty or fauour liked him well, when he saw her. 26 Dicet sè filiam tuam cupere vxorem. Hee will shewe you, y• he would fayne haue your daugh∣ter to his Wyfe. 28 Equidèm prorsùs nihil intelligo. In fayth I vnderstande or percetue nothing at all. 28 Vah tardus es, Tush thou art  dull fellowe to vnderstand or perceiue nothing. 29 Argentum dabitur ei ad nuptias aurum, atquè vestem quî comparet, He shal haue money ge∣uen him to his mariage, wherwith to bye cloth of gold and other apparell. Aurum heere is ta∣ken for cloth of golde, and so it is taken in dy∣uers places of Titus Liuius, and namely in∣the concions of Cato and Lucius Valerius. Lib. 31. ab vrbe cōdita. And Ioachimus Perio∣nius noteth the same. 33 Nòn ego perpetuò, dicebam, vt illi dares, sed vt mulares. s. e daturum, I sayd not that thou shouldest geeue it vnto him for euer, but that thou shouldest fayne, shew a countenaunce, or make as though thou wouldest geue it him. 34 Nòn mea est simulatio. I can no skill of such faynug or I can not make nor shewe no such countenaunces. 35 Ita tu isthaec tua misceto, ne me admisceas. Bringe in or meddle of thyne owne matters in such wyse that thou brynge not mee in a∣monges
it. 36 Egon'cui daturus non sim, vt ei despondeams, filiam▪ Shoulde I be troth or make sure my daughter vnto him, whom I wil not let or suf∣fer to haue her? There is Eclipsis of oportet, decet or conuenit. 37 Scite poterat fieri. It might so haue bene done properly. 38 Ego hoc, quia dudùm tu tantoperè iusseras, eò coepi. I began that for because that thou hds biddē me so greatly or so instantly ere while. 39 Equidem isthuc aequi boniquè facio. Truly I am nothing discontēted therewith. Aequi boni∣què facere, aequi boni què consulere, aequi con∣sulere, & boni consulere. Be elegant maner of latin speakinges, betokening the same that we say in english, to take wel in worth and in good gre. Examples be euery where innumerable. 40 Maximè volo te dare operam vt fiat, verum a∣lia via. I will in any wise that thou doe the la∣bor and diligence, that it may bee done, but yet after an other way. 42 Illud quod tibi dixi de argento, quod iste de∣bet Bacchidi, That, that I speake to you of the Money whych thys man oweth to Bac∣chis. 44 Argentū reddendum est illi. He must haue his money againe, or, his money must be payed vn∣to him agayne. 44 Ne{que} tu scilicet e nunc cōfugies, quid mea; s. refert. And in fayth thou shalt not nowe haue
any refuge to that saying (which some mē vse) what haue I to doe therewith, or, what pertey∣neth the matter to mee? 45 Nùm mihi datū est argentum? Was the mo∣ney deliuered vnto mee? 46 Num ille oppignerate filiam meam me inuito potuit? Might he lay my daughter in pledge, or to gage whether I would or not? 47 Verum illud dicunt. That is a true saying of men. Verum is a noune heere in this place. 48 Ius summum saepe summa iniuria est, The ri∣gour or the extremity of the lawe, or of a mans right, is oftētimes the greatest iniury & wrong that may bee. 49 Hàud faciam. I will not doe it. 49 Alijs si licet, tibi non licet.

He is u here now himselfe, goe thy wayes, and brynge forth the money. In the sixte Scene. 1 Nulla est tam facillis res, quin difficilis sit quā inuitus facias, Ther is nothing so easy or light to bee done, but that it is hard if a man doe  by compulsion, or agaynst his will. 2 Vel haec deambulatio quam non laboriosa, m ad languorem dedit. Euen the same litle wal∣king being nothing paynefull, or being a thing of no labour, yet hath made mee all weary an faynt. Vel, in this place, is not a coniunction distunctiue, but taken for Etiam per enallage partium. Ter. in Eu. Vel rex mihi semper age∣bat gratias. Euen the Kinge him selfe did euer geue me thankes. 4 Nec quicquàm magis nūc metuo, quam ne de∣nuò miser aliquo extrudat hinc.

This mine helper and coun∣sayler, and leader, or pointer of the way is a∣boue me or better then I in this poinet, Praemonstrator, toris, is hee that goeth before a man to guide him, and to shew him the way, and as who should say to leade him by the hād. In me quiduis harum rerum cōuenit, quae sunt dicta in stultum, caudex, stipes, asinus▪ plūbeus, All those thinges may well be sayde vnto mee, that be commonly sayde againste a foole as to be called a blocke or a stumpe, a stocke, an asse, an heauy heade, as who should say, I may wel be called a blocke, a stocke, an asse, a duhead, with all other such names, as be geuen to foo∣lish and dull fellowes, in despite or in derision. Caudex, is the foote & lowest part of the stocke of a treenext vnto the rootes: Sripes, stipiris, is a logge, that is set fast in the grounde. Plū∣bum, bi, is Latine for lead: whereof plumbus. bea, beum, a thing made of the mettell of lead, and by translation a man, or any other thing of the propertie and condition of leade, that is to wytte, heauy, blunt, and dull, whereof is taken a latine prouerb.: Plumbeo iugulare gladio, to cut ones throte with a fworde of leade, that is to say, to goe about and to labour to ouercome and conuince a man with a vayne light, & slen∣der reason or argument. The prourbe Cicero▪ doth vse.
5 In illum nil potest. s. dici. Nothing can bee say against him. 5 Exuperat eius stultitia haec omnia, The folish∣nes of him passeth all this. Desine deos gratulando obtundere. Leaue o forbeare to dull the Gods with gieuing thāke to them for thy good chaunce or fortune. Gra∣tulor, laris, hath two significations, the one i to make ioy and to say or to testifie in wordes that thou art glad of the good fortune or hap∣py chaunce, either of any other man, or els o thyne own selfe. And in this signification Gra∣tulor will haue after him a dtiue case of th party, for whose cause such ioying or testifica∣tion of gladnes is made, whether it be thy sel or els any other body, as Gratulor tibi, quo tam gratiosus sis apud principem. I am gla that you bee in such hygh fauoure wyth your prince. Gratulor mihi, cui hoc saeculo tam lite∣rato nasci contigerit, I am glad on mine own behalfe, that it was my chaunce to bee borne  this tyme, whē letters so wel flourished. Wher note, that Gratulor besides the sayde datiu case, may haue after hym also, of the thing tha you alledge, wherefore you saye that you be glad, an accusatiue without a preposition, or a accusatiue with the preposition ob, or els a ablatiue with the preposition de: as, I am gla that you haue that office: Gratulor tibi istum magistratum, or Gratulor tibi ob istum magi∣stratum, or els Gratulor tibi de isto magistratu▪ So Gratulor tibi nouum istum honorem, o
ob nouum istum honorem, or de nouo isto ho∣nore. I am glad on your behalfe, of this your new promotion: Albeit that Poetes somety∣mes leaue out the datiue case, especially when it is a pronounce: uid. in epist Gratulor Oc∣chalianitulis accedere nostris, where the da∣tiue is vnderstanded, whych may be tibi, mihi, or nobis, ego me nunc deniquè natum Gratu∣lor: Where is vnderstāded mihi. Sometimes also in Oratours, the datiue is not expressed, but omitted and vnderstanded. Quin. in pasc∣cadauer. Gratulemur iam, quod nulla ciuitas fame laboret: Where is vnderstanded nobis. And by reason of such omission of the datiue case, some Grammarians haue thought Gra∣tulari idem esse quod gaudere. To ioye to re∣ioyse or to be glad, alledging for theyr authori∣tie, the examples abou written: but Lau. Val∣li. 5. ele. cap. 42. doth not allow them, well consi∣dering, that gratulatiō may be, where not onely no ioy or gladnes is, but also entter and har∣ty sorrowe, as a man may saye or testifie, that he is glad of the promotion of an other man, (which is in latine Gratulari alicui nouā dig∣nitatem) and yet in his hearte be ryght sory for the same. Gratulor, is lso taken sometime for gratias agere, to geue thankes, but that is in maner neuer, but the Goddes immortall. So that in this significatiō it is the same that sup∣plicare, to pray and to doe our deuotions to the Goddes. Tit. Li. Triumphantes in capitoliū ascendent. Ioui optimo Maxime, caeteris{que} dij
gratulatum. Such persones as triumphed in olde tyme in that city of Rome, vsed to ascende or goe vp into the Capitoll castle or tower of that citie, to gieue deuoute thankes, vnto the moste good▪ and most mighty Iupiter, and vn∣to the other Gods. So that Gratulari deo & superi, is to geue deuoute thankes vnto God, and to his saynctes, for any benefite, felicitye, or happy chaunce receiued. And so is gratulando, taken here in this place of Terence, and there is vnderstanded eis nempè dijs. 7 Desine obtundere, nisi illos ex tuo ingenio iu∣dicas, vt nihil credas intelligere, nisi idem dictū est centies. Leaue dulling them, excepte thou esteeme and iudge theim of thyne owne pro∣pertie, that is, that thou thynkest them to per∣ceiue or vnderstande nothinge, but if the same haue bene spoken▪ repeted, or rehearsed an hun∣dred tymes. 13 Quid risisti? Wherefore diddest thou laughe? 13 Serui venêre in mentem Syri calliditates, I remembred, or I thought vpon the subtill or wily deuises of my seruant Syrus. 14 Itané? Yea in deede? 14 Vultus quoquè hominum singit seelus. The vngratious harlot can fashion or transpose al∣so the countenaunces and lookes of men. Sce∣lus for scelestus per emphasin, aut potiùs auxe∣in, as I shewed afore. I. Riuius in his casti∣gations vpon Terent noteth these woordes in this place, and expoundeth the same in such wise, yt he taketh the sense & meaning of them to
be this, Vultus quo{que} hominū fingit scelus, the vngrations fellow can also transpose or fashiō the coūtenances of men (that is) can make or cause men to looke & to haue such coūtenances as him listeth, meaning by Syrus, that he had in such wise taught & enstructed Clinia, that he could fashion his looke & countenaunce at hys pleasure, & counterfeite any fashion of counte∣nance that he would himself. And in this sence. it best agreeth with the woords next folowing, which bene these. Gratus quod se adsimulat lae∣tum, id dicis? That my sonne maketh a counte∣nance as he were glad, speake you of that? And fingere vultum, in the self same sense vseth Cae∣sar. si. 1. bel. Gal. where he saith thus. Hi nequè vultum fingere, ne{que} interdum lachrymas tene∣re poterant. These men could nether fayne or make a good countenance, nor yet sometymes hold or forbeare weping (as who should saye) they could not hide nor dissēble their feare, but that ther appeared in their faces & countenāces euident notes & tokens, that in their mindes & hearts they wersore troubled & vexed & afeard of punishment. And of the same cōmeth a pro∣uerbial speaking. Fortunam sibi quis{que} fingit, Euery mā maketh (as who should say) as cau∣ser of his owne fortune, bee it good or bad, as who should say, they that be good or vertuous or learned, or haue any honest craft or occupa∣tion, shall haue good fortune, and shalbe sustey∣ned thereby and lyue well, and contrariwyse, they y• be idle fellowes, nor haue any learnynge,
nor occupation, but bee flagitious and full of mischyefe, shall not liue well, but in misery, whereof they may alwayes thanke them selues as causers of their owne fortune. 16 Idem isthuc mihi venit in mentē. I remēbred or thought vpon, euen that selfe same thing. 17 Magis, si magis nôris, putes ita rem esse, Thou wouldest much more thinke it to bee so, if thou diddest better know the matter. 17 Ain'tu, Sayest thou so? 17 Hoc priùs scire expeto, This I desire to know first. 23 Mira narras, thou tellest a marueilous tale. Mira, the accusatiue plurall, neuter gender, put substantiuely. 28 Quid est, quod ampliùs simuletur? What is there that is fayned more then this? 29 Est mihi retrò vltimis in aedibus cōclaue quod∣dam I haue a certaine parlour behind or in the back side in the furmost part of all my house. 30 Lectus vestimentis stratus est, There be clo∣thes layd vpon the bed. 31 Quid postquàm hoc est factum? What, when was that done? what was next? 32 Hùe abijt Clitipho, Bacchis consecuta est il∣licò, Thither goeth Clitipho, and after goeth Bacchis at the hard heeles of him. Confequi is to follow, as we vse to say in english cheeke by cheeke, or at the hard heeles. &c. 33 Vbi abiêre intrô, operuere ostium, As soone as they were gotten in, they closed or shutte to the doore.
34 Clinia haec fieri videbat? Did Clinia see all this done? 34 Quid ni? mecum vnà simul? What els, euen to∣geather with me? Quid ni s viderit vna simul. It is the figure Pleonasmus, of which is she∣wed afore. 39 Decem dierū vix mihi est familia, My house∣holde may scarsely endure or holde ten daies lō∣ger (as who should saye) I shall not be able to continue housholdyng or keepinge of an house ten dayes longer. 37 Ille operam amico dat suo, Hee attendeth vp∣pon hys friend. 38 An dubium .i. tibi? Hast thou any doubt of that. 39 Quenquam animo tam comi esse aut leni pu∣tas? Thinkest thou any man to be of so familiar or so gentle an hart? Hic haec comis & hoc come is hee that is gentle and familiar & nothing sta∣telyke, or hygh mynded or straunge. Hic haec le∣nis & hoc lene, is he that is not rough or sharp nor sone moued to anger: but is gentle & sone contented or pleased, and is full of sufferance. 41 Quo verba facilius dentur mihi, That I may the soner be deceiued. 42 Meritò mihi nuuc ego succenseo, I am angry with my selfe now, not without a cause. 43 Quot res dedere, vbi possim praesentiscee, nsi essem lapis, How many thinges haue they done, wherby I might haue perceiued it if I had not bene a very stone. 45 An ne illud multum ferent, Shal they escape with it vnpunished?
46 Non tu te cohibes? Wilt thou not refray or kepe thy selfe in? 46 Non tu te respicis? Dost thou nothing rega thy selfe? 47 Non ego tibi exempli satis sum. Am not I e∣ample good enough for thee? 47 Praeiacundia non sum apud me, I am out my witte for anger. 48 Tene isthuc loqui? s. decet, conuenit, vel opo∣et, Such a word to come out of thy mouth, b∣comes it thee to speake this? 49 Non id flagitium est te alijs consilium dar foris sapere tibi non posse auxiliarier? Is  this a very naughty thing, that thou canst g counsayle vnto others, and to be wyse in oth mens matters, and not to bee able to helpe,  ease thyne own selfe? 52 Fac te esse patrem sentiat, So do that he ma perceiue and feele thee to be his father. 52 Fac vt audeat tibi credere omnia, So do th he may commit and shew vnto thee all thinge Credere alicui in this signification is to com∣mitte vnto any man all secrets, and to keepe n hyde nothing from him. 54 Fac nequàm aliam quaerat copiam, So do th he may not seeke for any other helpe. 54 Fac e e deserat, So do that hee may not fo sake thee. 55 Imò abeat potiùs multo quouis gentium  hic per flagitium ad innopiam redigat patrem. Nay mary let him go from hence to the world end, much rather then hee should here thron
hys mischiefe and vngracious fashion of liuing vndo hys father, and bring him to pouertye, & need, or beggery: of this woord Gentium, how it is added vnto diuers aduerbes. it is largely declared afore. 57 Si illi pergam suppeditare sumptus, mihi illaec vere ad rastros res rediet. If I shoulde geue hym as much money as he would spende, that would surely bring me to the take & the pade▪ as who should say, it would vndo me and make me a very begger in decde, and it is elegantlye sayd in latine. Res mihi ad rastros redit, I must be fayne to take a rake and a spade in my hand (as who should saye) to digge & to delue for my liuing. Suppeditare illi sumptibus. May other wyse bee sayd in Latine Suppeditare illi sumptus: and this latter is more vsed. 59 Quot incommoditates in hac re accipies nisi caues? How many incommodityes or displea∣sures shalt thou haue in this thing except thou beware or take heede? albeit Iho Riuius in hys castigations readeth, Quot incommoda tib in hac re capies. &c. 60 Difficilem ostendis te esse, ignosces tùm post. Thou shewest thy selfe hard, sore, or heauye to∣wardes him yet thou wilt forgeeue or pardon hym at last. Post, i. poste à and it is here an Ad∣uerbe and not a preposition for it gouerneth no case, whereof also it is annoted afore. 61 Nes is quam doleam, Thou knowest not how sory I am. 6 Quid obticuisti? Why dost not thou speake?
Of the propre signification of Obticio: it  shewed afore. 65 Ita dico, So I say, 65 Ne quid vereare, Be not affrayde or feare, nothing 66 Nil dos nos moue, We care nothing for any money to her maryage. 67 Duo Talenta pro te nostra▪ego esse decreuisa∣tis. I haue determined or iudged that one hun∣dreth poundes is enoughe for one of my sub∣staunce. 68 Ita▪ dictu opus est, si me vi saluum esse & em, & filium, Thou must needes so say, if thou wilt haue my lyfe saued, and my goodes and my son. Here is the figure of constructiō called Zeugma which is when a verbe or an adiectiue is redu∣ced and referred into diuers nominatiue cs or substantiues, that is to weete, vnto the no∣minatiue or substanstiue that is next vnto it ex∣pressely and vnto a the other by vnderstanding or reetinge: Ego & tu viuis, I and thou liue where viuis is reduced and refrred vnto two nominatiue case, that is to weete ego, and u▪ And with the next that is , It accordeth in nomber and person expressely, and with the fur∣ther that is ego, by vnderstandyng, Ego. s. viuo & tu viuis, So caeli mouendi, sunt & terra. Where mouendi and sunt▪ according with the next, that is coeli expresselye that is to saye, the verbe in nomber and personne, and the adec∣tiue in case, gender, and nomber. And with the further terra, they oth accordinge not, but by
vnderstanding thus, Coeli mouendi sunt, & ter ra. s. mouenda est. So ir. Hic illius arma, hic currus fuit, where the sence and oration is thus to be made perfit. Hic illius arma▪ s▪ fùerūt. Hic currus fuit. &c. Againe, Ego. s. vxor mea est doc∣ta. The perfit speaking is this, Ego sum doc tus & vxor mea est docta, or els, Ego sum doc∣tus, & vxor. s. est docta. Yet this notwithstāding if there be any comparison, the verbe or the ad∣iectiue may accorde with the further. As in ex∣ample we say not. Ego melius {quam} t scribis, but Ego melius {quam} to scribo, I write better thē thou Likewise if there be any stmilitude, the veth or adiectiue shal accord with the further nomina∣tiue or substantiue: as Ego sicùs tu sentio, and not Ego sicùt tu sentis, I thinke as thou dost, or I am of the minde that thou art, And in the Psalme Ego icù foenū arui, and not ego sicùt foenum aruit, also by the coniunction nisi, thus Talem filiū nulla nisi tu pareret, and not pare∣res, but by vnderstanding. And here note, that zeugma, may bee three maner wayes. First in person, as Ego & tu viuis: Secondarily in gen∣der, as Rex & regina est irata: Thirdly in nū∣ber, as Ci, Nihil te hic munitissimus habendi senaus locus, nihil borum ora, vultus{que} moue∣runt? Hath this most strong place, that the par∣liament is kept in, and the faces or countenaū∣ces or lookes of these men, being present & be∣holding thee, moued thee nothing at all? Note further, that there be three kyndes of zeugma, One called in greeke prorozeugma, y• is, when
the verbe or the adiectiue is set in the beginig as Dormio ego & tu. An other is called Meso▪ zeugma, which is when the verbe or the adiec∣tiue is set in the middest: as Ego dormio & tu. The thirde is called Hipozeugma▪ and that is where the verbe is put in th'end: as Ego &  dormis. But whē a verbe or adiectiue is redu∣ced vnto diuers nominatiue cases or substan∣tiues and agreeth with them boh, the Gram∣marians call it Zeugma locutionis of speaking non constructionis, and not of construction.  in the example of Cicero afore, Nihil horum o▪ra vultus{que} mouerūt, againe Ioannes est erudi∣tus & Petrus. zeugma requireth four thinges: First dyuers substantiues, as Rex & regina Secondarily a coniunction as, &. Thirdly  verbe or an adiectiue, as irata est. Fourthly y• the same verbe or adiectiue doe agree expresly with the next nominatiue or substātiue, as Rex & regina est irata. where note that the coniunc∣tion may be eyther a contunctiue, a disunc or es an expletiue, it may be also an aduerbe i steede of a cōunction as Cubas vbi ego, Thou lyest where I doe. Coenas quandò nos, Thou suppest whā we do. Haec ferè de zeugmae. Ge rardus Lystrius. Id mirari te simulato, & illum ogato simul {quam}obrē id faciā. Make as though thou didest meruaile thereat, & together there withall demaund of him, wherefore I doe it. 71 Ego verò, quam obrem id facias nescio, And i deede to, I knowe not wherefore thou do it.
Ego id facio, vt eius animum qui nunc luxuria & lasciuia diffluit, retūdam, I do it that I may cleane dash his hart or mind▪ which now run∣neth at rouers in riot and wantōnes. Diffluere properly is to runke abroade in diuers places as water doth, and by translation it is to bee iotous and wild, running▪ at large, nothing re∣garding himselfe Semblably retundere pro∣perly is to make dul, or blūt as in a knife, whē the point or edge of it is turned. And the same by translation is to abate, to bryng downe, and (as we vse much to say now) to dash, to blāke and to appaule▪ Luxuria, iae, and luxus, xus. xui is taken for riot, and not for lechery. Libido. dinis, is latine for lecherie, and lasciuia pertay∣neth to the same. For lascius properly is hee that is lecherous both in liuīg & also in words Ex Lau. Val. 73 Redigam eum, vt quò se vortat, nesciat, I wil bringe him to that pointe, that he shall not wot whether to turne him. A chylde may marneyle why Terence saith not nesciet, rather thē nes∣ciat, seeing that our maner of speaking in En∣glishe so soundeth, as though it should bee the future tence of the indicatiue mode. But it is to be noted, that this particle vt, is neuer ioined with verbes of the indicatiue moode. For Vt nesciet in this maner speaking, is the same that barbarous. rue, & vncarned persōs say thus quod nesciet. But ye latine phrase is otherwise. Therefore in this manner speaking wt others like it is necessary to put the present tence of y•
subiunctiue mode in stead of the future of th indicatiue mode. And this is also noted in the litle Booke, De corrupti sermonis emenda∣tione. And this example of Terence is ther brought in▪ Quo  vertat▪ id est▪ Quò e verte∣re debeat, I is th potentiall mode. 74 Mitte me, Let mee go, or let me alone. 74 Sine me, in hac e gerere mihi morem. Suffe mee in this thing to follow myne owne appe∣tit, or to haue myne owne mynde and pleasure 75 Ità ne vi? Wilt thou so? Or, is that th wynde? 76 Vxorem accersat, Let hym sende for hy wife. 76 Dictis confutabitur, He shalbe conuinced o blanked with woordes or reasons. Confuto∣ts, is to auoyde a man in such wyfe, that he can nothinge more alledge nor saye for hym∣selfe. 77 Eum si viuo, adeo exornatum dabo, adeo d∣pexū, vt dùm viuat, meminerit sempèr mei. I I liue, I will so beray him, & so decke or t him yt as long as he lyueth he shall euer remē∣ber mee, or think on mee. Depexus, xa, xū, com∣meth of depecto, which is diligentèr pecto, t kemb diliētly▪ uid l. 3. fast. Interea liber d pexos crinibus in dos Vicit▪ & Eôo diues ad o be venit▪ Per metaphoram, vel potius ironia It is takē and vsed in the ill part. So that d∣pexus▪ which is properly wel kembed, and h∣uing a bush well decked▪ is taken for the cōtr∣ry
that is ill arayde and ill handled. 79 Sibi me pro ridiculo, ac delectamen to putat, He reputeth me as his laughing stocke, and as one to make him sporte and pastime, 80 Nō and cret haec facere viduae mulieri, quae in me fecit, He durst not haue done vnto a widow or alone woman, that he hath done against me. Vidua, du, Is a lone woman and a Wydow, whose husband is deceased: and because wo∣men (especially such as haue no husbād to help and defend them from iniuries and wronges) for the most parte be nothing set by, but had in contempt, and reputed as abiects and vile per∣sons, which no man careth for, nor feareth to delude and mocke, therefore he vseth heere that comparison and example. In the second Scene. 2 Omnem de me eiecit animum, Hee hath cast his minde away from mee. 3 Quodnam ob facinus? For what act, deede, or trespasse? 3 Quid ego tantum sceleris admisi miser? What so great and haynous trespasse haue I perpe∣trate or done vnhappy body that I am? 4 Vulgò id faciunt, They do it cōmonly (as who should say) euery body vseth to doe this thing that I haue done. 4 Scio tibi esse hoc grauiùs multò, ac duiùs, I knowe that this thinge is to thee much more grieuous and hard. 5 Ego haud minùs aegrè, patior, I take the mat∣ter euen as grieuously.
5 Nescio, nee rationem capio. I know it not, nor I perceyue nor vnderstand not the reason of it. 6 Tibi bene ex anîmo volo, I woulde thee well with all my hart. 7 Hic patrem astare aiebas? Stoode my father here sayest thou. 7 Quid me incusas? Why blamest thou mee? or why layest thou fault or blame in me. 8 Quicquid ego huius feci tibi prospexi, & stul∣titiae tuae, Whatsoeuer I haue done in this mat∣ter, I did it to helpe thee and thy folishnes pros∣picere, is to looke or to see vnto, and to prouyde or shift for. 9 Te vidi animo esse omisso▪ I saw or marked thee to be of a reichlesse mynd, Omisso i. negligē∣ti. So in Adelphus. At enim metuas ne ab re sint omissiores paulò▪ Mary but percase thou wil: feare and cast perilles, that they should bee negligent about their owne profite, and aboute geuinge moneye to sustayne them or to lyue by, 9 Vidi te suauia in presentia quae essent prima ha¦bere, neqùe consulere in longitudinem, I saw or marked thee to set most by those thinges, which be sweete pleasaunt and delectable for the while, and not to prouide for any space or long tyme to come. 11 Caepi rationem, vt neqùe egeres, neqùe haec posses perdere. I began to take such a way y• nei∣ther thou mightest be brought to pouerty, neede▪ or penury, nor yet mightest leese this that tho
hast▪ 13 Eis commisi & credidi, I haue committed & put al the matter to them. 14 Ibi tuae stultitiae semper erit praesidiū. There shalbe alwayes a refuge and place f succour for thy foolishnes. 17 Disperij, scelestus quātas turbas conseiui insci∣ens? I am vndone vngratious fellow that I am, how great troublous busines haue I pro∣cured vnwitting? 18 Emori cupio. I would faine die, or I would I were out of the world, or I would gladly bee out of my lyfe. 18 Priùs quaeso, disce quid sit viuere, vbi scies, si displicebit vita, tū ist hoc vtitor, I pray the first learn, what it is to liue in deede, and after that thou shalt knowe it, than if good lyfe shal misse like thee, vse this fashion that thou doest now. Viuere, is here taken for secundum virtutē vi∣uere▪ To liue after yt rule of vertue. And Vita here is taken for actus & mores, as who should say the lyfe actiue, morall, and vertuous. So in Phormio. Quē ego in vita vidi optimū Whom I haue seene maruailous good honest, & ver∣tuous of lyuing. 20 Quae ista est prauitas, quaeuè amōtia? what naughty fashyon is thys, or what madnesse. 21 Quod peccaui ego, id obest huic. That that I haue offended hurteth hym here. 22 Ne te admisce, medle not thou in the matter. Ne an aduerbe of forbidding may be ioyned wt
verbes of the imparatiue mode, or of the sub∣iunctiue mode indifferently. Non in the same signification is ioyned with verbes of the sub∣iunctiue mode onely, and not of the imparatiue mode. 22 Nemo te accusat, No man accuseth, blameth, or appeacheth thee, or no man complayneth on thee. 22 Nec tu aram tibi nequè precatorem patâris Neither take sainctuary for the matter, ne yet prouide, get or make any spokesmā, perticioner or intercessor for thee. Pararis for paraueris per syncopen, and it is the future tence of the sub∣iunctiue mode set for the imparatiue mode. 23 Nihil succēcotibi, I am nothing angry with thee. 25 Rogasse vellem, vnde mihi peterem cibum, I would I had asked of him where I should re∣quire my meate and drinke. 26 Nos abalienauit. Hee hath geeuen vs ouer, or hee hath cast vs of, or hee hath forbidden vs his house. 29 Irride in re tanta neque, me quicquàm consi∣lio adiuuas? Dost thou mock or iest in so great a matter, nor helpest mee nothinge at all wyth thy counsayle? 33 Ego dicam quod mihi in mentem, tu dijudica I will say that is in my mynde, and then iudge thou. In mentem, s. venit. or els in mentem. s. est for in mente est per antipôsin. Albeit, in the margine of Basts inprinting it is noted, a founde read in some examplaries, not in men
te est. 35 Inuenta est causa, qua te expellerēt, there was a quarell founde, whereby they might driue or thrust thee out. 37 Est verisimile. It is like so. 37 An tu ob hoc peccatum esse illum iratum, pu∣tas? Doest thou suppose or thynke, that hee is angry for this offence? 38 Non arbitror, I thinke not. 38 Nùnc aliud specta, Nowe marke an other thing, or yet more ouer consider an other thing. For I thinke nùnc heere to bee taken for I am which very oft & many times is taken for Prae∣terea insupèr, ad haec, Furthermore besides all this. c. 38 Matres omnes filius in peccato adiutrices solēt esse, All mothers vse or bene wont to help their sonnes, when they haue done any fault. 39 Matres filijs auxilio in paterna iniuria solent esse, Mothers are wont to help their children when their Fathers doe them wronge or bee vnreasonable. 40 Id nòn fit. That is not done. 41 Suspicionem istam ex illis quaere. Demaund of them and enquyre the cause of this suspici∣on. 41 Rem profer palam. Vtter the matter plaine∣ly. 42 Si non est verum, ad misericordiam ambos ad∣duces citò, If it bee not true, thou shalt anone mooue and bringe them both to pity and com∣passion.
43 Recte suades. Thou geeuest mee good coun∣sayle. 43 Sat rectè hoc mihi in mētem venit, this came very well vnto my mynde or remembraunce. 49 Eum precatorem mihi paro. Hym will I get to be spokesman, peticioner, or intercessour for mee. 49 Seni nostro fidei nihil habeo. I trust our olde man neuer a deale, or I haue no trust or affy∣aunce at all in the olde man my maister. The third Scene. 1 Profectò, nisi caues tu homo, aliquid conficies mali, vndoutedly, except thou beeware thou fe∣lowe, thou shalt worke or brynge vp some mis∣chiefe. 2 Miror quomodò tàm ineptum quidquam potu erit tibi venire in mentem, I meruayle howe any so foolyshe a thynge coulde come into thy mynde. 3 Pergin' mulier esse? Wylt thou be a woman still? as who shoulde say, Wylt thou neuer leaue thy womans conditions? 4 Vllam ne ego rem vnquam volui, quin tu in ea re mihi aduersator fueris? Was I euer minded or willinge to haue done any thynge but that thou hast ressted & bene against mee therein? Terence in the Texte, speaking in that person of Chremes vnto Sostrata, being a woman, sayth, Aduersatix. 5 Si rogitem iàm, quid est quod peccē aut quā∣obrèm hoc faciam, nescias. If I would nowe
aske of thee, what it is wherein I doe amisse or wherefore I do this same, thou couldest not tell. 6 In qua re nunc am confidentèr restas stulre? In what thing dost thou now withstande mee, or striue and struge agaynst mee so boldly or ma∣lapetly foolish fellow? 9 Iniquis es, qui me tacere de re tanta postules. Thou art vniust, or vnreasonable, that dost re∣quire, or that wouldest haue mee to hold my peace, and saye nothinge, in to greate a mat∣ter. 9 Nihilo minùs ego hoc faciam tamen. Yet neuer the lesse I will do this same. 10 Non vides quantum mali ex ea re excites, dost thou not see how much mischiefe thou raysest thereby. 11 Subditum se suspicatur, Hee mistrusteth hym selfe that he was some chaungeling, Subditum ▪▪ subditiū vel suppositum. Subpositus, ta, tum, a chaungeling, or a child that was chaunged in the cradle, and lated there for the very true child Iuuenalis. Transeo suppositos. I passe ouer & speake nothing of chaungelinges, or such as were chaunged in their cradles, as wee saye in english. Of the same signification is Subtitius, and here in this place subditus, 12 Istuc in imicis siet, Such chaunce come to our ennemyes. 13 Ego confitear meum non esse filium qui sit me∣us? Shoulde I confesse or say, that hee is not my sonne, which in deede is myne?
14 Quid metuis, What fearest thou? or whereof arte thou afearde? 17 Conuinces facilè ex te natum, nam tui fimilis est probe, Thou shalt sont or easly proue him to bee of thine owne body borne, for hee is ve∣ry like vnto thee of condicions. Diuers gram∣marians haue noted, that fimilis whā it gouer∣neth a datiue case, betokeneth lyke in fauour,  when it gouerneth a genitiue, it betokeneth like of maners and conditions. Which obseruati∣on heere in this and other places, for the more part is true, but yet not euery where. 18 Illi nihil vitij est relictum, quin id itidem sit ti∣bi, He hath no fault or vice left, but that thou hast euen the same also. 19 Talem nulla nisi tu pararet filium, No womā alyue coulde haue brought forth such a sonne, but thou. Here is the figure zeugma, of whych it is diligently noted a litle afore, & this same clause of Terence there recited. The fourth Scene. 1 Si vn{que}vllum fuit tempus, cùm ego voluptati ti∣bi fuerim, obsecro eius vt memineris, If euer there was any time, that you had any delighte or pleasure in me, I besech you for Gods sake call it to mynde and remembraunce. 3 Inopis te miserescat mei. Haue thou pity and compassion vpon me, being a poore fellow and without any maner of help. For that signifieth properly inops. 4 Peto parentes meos, vt commonstres mihi, I desire you that you will shewe vnto me my pa∣rentes,
or my Father and Mother. 5 Ne isthuc animum inducas tuum neuer thinke that 6 Hoccine quaesisti obsecro? Hast thou asked such a question of mee I pray thee? 8 Caue posthàc si me amas, vnquam isthuc ver∣bum ex te audiam. Beware if thou loue mee, that I neuer here that worde of thy mouthe a∣gayne. 9 Caue mores posthàc in te esse istos sentiā Be∣ware that I neuer see or perceiue to be in thee gaine from henceforth such maners or behaui∣our, as thou hast vsed. 10 Si scire vis, ego dicam. If thou be willing or desirous to know, I will tell thee. 11 Nostrum te esse credito. Thinke thy selfe to be our owne sonē. So it is takē here in this place of Terence, but it may be englished in another sense, thus: Thinke thy selfe to bee our owne (as who should say) our friend & in our good fauour. 12 Non sunt haec parentis dicta, These bee not meete wordes of a Father to his Sonne. 12 Non si ex capite sis meo natus, itidem vt aiūt, Mineruam esse ex Ioue▪ ea causa magis patiet flagitijs tuis me infamem fieri. Although thou were borne out of my very head, euē so as they say y• Minerua was borne out of the head and braine of Iupiter, yet I will not any thing the rather for that cause suffer my self to bee in in∣famy and obloque of men, or to incurre & runne in slaunder of men, by reason of thy abhomina∣ble
vices or naughty fashions Flagitijs is abla∣tiuae causae▪ Miuerua is the Goddesse of artes, sciences, and warres, and it is metaphorically taken sometymes for nature, for wit, or for any art or science. Which thinges because they bee hygh giftes, and onely geuen by God, the poets fayne that Minerua was the daughter of Iupi∣ter, and deliuered, or borne out of his owne head or brayne. Whereof Lucianus the Greeke poet hath a very prety dialogue, in dialogis deo rum superum. 15 Dij istaec prohibeant, The Gods forbid or de∣fend those thinges. 15 Ego quod potero enitar sedulò, I will doe my∣uy laboure as much as I shalbe able to doe, 16 Quaeris id quod habes parentes, quod abest non quaeris patri quo modo obsequare, & vt ser∣ues, quod labore inuenerir, Thou seekest that, that thou hast, that is to say, parentes, or fa∣ther and mother, but that, that thou hast not, but lackest, thou seekest not▪ that is to say, how thou mayst please thy father, & how thou mayst keepe that he hath gotten with his labour, In∣uenerit. i. parauerit. 19 Pudet dicere hoc praesente, I am ashamed to speake it in the presence of this man. 19 At te illud nullo modo facere puduit. But thou were neuer a whit at al ashamed to do that. 20 Eheu, quàm ego nunc totus displiceo mihi, A∣las how angry I am with my selfe, or how sory I am, Displiceo mihi in latine speaking is some
times vsed in a much like sēce, as we vse to say in English, I am alfe nought, as thus, I was wery of trauayling, or, after my iourney, and was halfe nought & more. De via fessus erā, mi∣hi{que} totus displicebam. 21 Quā pudet. s. me▪ How greatly ashamed I am. The fifth Scene. 1 Enimuerò nimis grauiter cruciat adolescentu∣lum, nimis{que} inhumanè, Truely he vexeth the poore younge man to sore, and to vnkindely or vngently. 2 Exeo vt pacem conciliem. s. inter eos, I come forth to make peace or attonemēt betwene thē. 3 Cur non accersi iubes filiam. s. meā? Why doest thou not bid or commaund my daughter to bee sent for? 4 Mi vir te obsecro ne facias Sweete husband I pray you for Gods sake doe not so. 5 Pater obsecro mihi ignoscas, Father, I besech you for Gods sake, forgeue or pardon mee. 5 Da veniam. s. mihi, Forgeue or pardon mee. 6 Sine te exorē▪ Let mee intreat you. Exorate est orando impetrare, To obtane with praying. 6 Scien non faciam, I will not doe it wittingly. 7 Id nos non sinemus, I will not suffer it. No for ego, is much vsed modestiae causa, but vos for u, may not bee vsed, ne honoris quidèm gratia. 7 Si me viuum vis pater, ignoscc. s. mihi, Father if you loue my lyfe, forgeue or pardon mee. 8 Ne tā offirma te. Bee not so stiffe, or be not so
curst hearted, for that is offirmare animum, all bett, it is vsed sometimes in the good part. 10 Ea lege hoc faciam, I will doe the thing vp∣on this condition. 11 Omnia faciam, impera, I will doe all things that you shall thinke good, commaunde me, Omnia faciam. s. quae tu censes equum esse vt faciam, for that went next afore. 11 Ad me recipio, I vndertake it. 14 Haec dum incipias grauitia sunt, dum{que} igno∣res, vbi cognoris, facilia. Al these thynges bee hard, till a man hath begunne or is entred in them, and as long as he knoweth them not, but after that hee is ones acquainted with them they be light. 17 Rufam ne illam virginem, caesiam, sparso ore, aduneo naso, ducam? Shall I marry that red headed, grayeyed, platerfaced, and haukenosed wench, Caesius, a, ū, and glaucus, ca, cū, Is blew or gray, as the sky, is when it hath litle specks of gray Cloudes in a fayre day, as it were a plumket colour. Of the names of colours read Aul. Ge. l. 2. noct. attic. Ca. 26. Sparso ore. . lar∣go, lato amplo, Large, broade, & (as wee vse to say in scorne, or derision) platerfaced.
