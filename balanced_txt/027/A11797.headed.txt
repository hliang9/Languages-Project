THE SPANIARDS PERPETVALL DESIGNES TO AN VNIVERSALL MONARCHIE. Translated according to the French. Printed 1624.
A PROGRESSE OF THE Conquests of the King of SPAINE, and House of Austria in Germany, Swit∣zerland, the Grisons Countrie, Italy, and the Frontiers of France, since the death of Henry the Great. THE Spaniards continually pursuing the advancement of their universall Monarchy, (the first foundation whereof were laid by Charles the fift, since which time that de∣signe hath been still eagerly prosecuted,) haue bin so happy in their endeavours in these last 10 or 12 yeares in diuers parts of Europe: and particularly neere to the borders of France, that there remaines very little for them to conquer; to encompasse it on all sides, and so by little and little to make themselves Majestrates and Arbiters of Christen∣dome. And to begin with the last and freshest of their Conquests; Besides the Palatine Electoriall dignity, which they haue put into the hands of one of their confidents: they haue conquered by Armes all the Palatinate, both on this side and beyond the Rhine; and within, or neere it, many Citties and strong places, whereof divers are Imperiall free Townes, as namely Wormbs, Spire, Landaw, Haguenau, Wissem∣bourg, Fridberg, Gailhassen, Wetzlar, and others: together with a good part of the Countrey of Han∣nau, and of the Countrey of Wetteraw, wherein are
many Counts and Lords neighbours, and Allies to the Prince Elector Palatine: whose Brother and Cosens haue beene no more spared then the rest, though not comprehended in the Imperiall Ban, their Lords and Lordships being seized on, toge∣ther with the Iointures of the innocent widdow Princesses. This notable conquest, to take it from Mentz and Haggenaw on the one side, and the coun∣tries of Trier and Lorraine one the other, and from Francfort almost close to Strasbourg, containes in length more then 50 French leagues, and in breadth Fortie. And they still continue to make some pro∣gresse about the Palatinate, vnder colour of passages or other pretents: and proceede in their secret practises vpon diuers other Imperiall Townes, espe∣cially that of Strasbourg, (a great and strong place, and of the ancient patrimony of our first Kings:) and likewise vpon the Towne of Besanson, to esta∣blish a Parliament there, or transferre thither that of Dole. As in the time of Phillip the second, the Admirall of Arragon presumed to aske the Vicariat of that Towne for the King his Master, but it was denied him by the Emperour Rodolph the second. And of late the Ministers of Spaine haue offered money for certaine places in the Bishopricke of Liege, for no other end but that we euen now speak of. But that which is most monstrous, is the quar∣rell they make with the Elector of Brandenbourg, see∣king an occasion to make him likewise loose his Electorat, although that Prince hath all this time remained neutriall, and kept intelligence with the Elector of Saxony, who at one time or other will
scape no better then the rest, though he hath assisted the Emperours with his Armes and Counsells, to the preiudice of his neere kindred, whom he dayly sees to be turned naked to the world. All men know that not long before this, the Spa∣niards had made themselues Masters of all that Countrie which lies betweene the Riuers of the Mosell and the Rhine, from the Townes of Liege and Cullen, to Numeguen in Guelderland: and especially of the free and Imperiall Townes of Aix-la-Chap∣pell and Wezell: notwithstanding the intercession of the King and Queene Mother then Regent, both by frequent Letters and Ambassadours sent expres∣ly for that businesse. And they haue since taken by composition the Townes and Fortresses of Iuliers, and hold entirely the Dutches of Iuliers and Berg, together with all the Townes and places of the Grand Conte de la Marke, and the County of Rauens∣berg, with two thirds of the Duchie of Cleues, on this side and beyond the Rhine, and the most part of it vnder the Duke of Newbourgs name. But the Spaniards hauing their garrisons there, the good Prince can neither inioy the places nor the reuinue, but in very small proportion. And notwithstanding all his endeauours and dilligence vsed at Bruxells, for freeing himselfe from those garrisons, yet cannot he hitherto obtaine or preuaile with them in any thing, though he be a Catholike, their friend, and Allie. This conquest is not much lesse worth to the Spaniards, then that of the lower Palatinate, as∣well for the approach which foote by foote they make towards Holland: as for the extent of these
Countries, which one with another, from the towne of Aix-la-Chapell to Lipstat, the last place of the County De la Marke, and from thence to the Town of Cleues, amounts vnto aboue fourescore French leagues in length, and about 50 in breadth. And this without accounting the Fort of Pappe-mutz, sittuate in an Isle of the Rhine on this side Cullen, lately conquered by the Spaniards, and by them Christened with the name of Isabella. And in a word, either by association, or by the conuenience of the Electors of Mentz and Cologue: or by their proper conquests, they may call themselues Masters of the great Riuer of Rhine, from the Towne of Stratsbourg, yea euen from Brisacke and Basle, to Rees and Emericke, Townes in the Land of Cleue, not farre distant from the mouth of that River. Furthermore, who knowes not the designes of the Spaniards vpon the Countrie of the Grisons, and how the Archduke Leopold on the one side, and the Gouernour of Millaine on the other, haue possest themselues of the greatest part of those Countries, hauing put garrisons into Coyre, Mayenfeld, Preti∣gau, and all other places of the one and other Enga∣dine, euen close to the Canton of Zurich: where the Arch-duke intends to erect a Fort in a certaine place called Steig, thereby to bridle the Switzers, and keepe an entrance into the Countrey. And towards Millaine they haue seized vpon the Counties of Chiavenna and Pregaglia, and the long and fertile valley of the Val-telina, (the two ends whereof ioyne Millaine and Tirol) which is the subiect of the pre∣sent difference betweene the King of Spaine on the
on side, and the Crowne of France, the States of Venice, Sauoy, and generally all Italy, the Switzers and Grisons on the other side. They haue also seized on the Counties of Bromio and Valmesolcina, a faire and large valley neere Bellin∣zons, towards the Frontiers of Italy: and now of late upon the County of Muscco, under the title of of the Count of Triuulce his pretence: the foresaid Conquests making altogether, to reckon from Mayenfield to Bormio, and from thence to the Fort Fuentes at the least, 40 French leagues in length, and more the 30 in breadth, as it may euidently ap∣peare by Cluverius his Map of Rhaetia. And al∣though the present Pope, being now depositary of the most parts of these Forts and places, labours with the King of Spaine for restoring all things vnto there former estate, according to the French Kings desire, yet cannot he attaine vnto it. And for Italy, it is true that the late King of Spaine in the yeare 1611, had made himselfe Master of the Towne of Sasello, and placed a garrison there: but vpon the complaint and request of the Repub∣lique of Genoa, restored it to the former State. Neuerthelesse in Monaco, and the Towne and Castle of Correggio, the Spaniards keepe a strong Garrison. They haue also newly erected the Fort of Sandonal, vpon the Frontier of Piedmont, towards Vercel. And concerning the Sates of Milan, Final, Plumbin, and other Fiefs which the King of Spaine holds of the Empire, he hath vpon the instance of his Ambassador resident at Vienna, receiued
solemne investiture thereof by the Emperour 1621; And besides, the States of Venice and Savoy are threatned by him, aswell for the misunderstanding and differences past, as for this new dispute and quarrell touching the Valteline, wherein the greatest part of the Potentares of Italie, and the Pope him∣selfe are also interessed. And to make his way by little and little amongst the leagues of the Switzers and Grizons, (peoples formerly so obliged and affectionate to the Crowne of France, as they did in a maner reiect all other Alliances) the Spaniard hath by money, promises and practises, divided them into Factions, thereby to weaken that body which subsists not but by their vnion, and to be able to bring them against France it selfe, and other neighbouring States. The Spaniards haue done asmuch vnder divers pretents in the Countrie of Valey, and Bishoprirke of Sion, having likewise possessed themselues of the passages of Switzerland, thereby to haue the wayes free and cleere for their Armies to passe from Italie to Flan∣ders: which before they were constrained to beg from the Duke of Savoy, or the leagues of Switzer∣land. To returne to Germany, it is very considerable that the conquests made by the Duke of Bauaria, aswell in the upper Palatinate which he hath gottē entire∣ly into his possession, as in the lower Palatinate, tend all of them to the advantage of the House of Austria, this Prince being neere Allie, and obliged to that House, by the translation of the Electorate vpon his person, and other benefits lately received from
the Emperour. So that to fauour that Duke, in hope either to bring him into suspition with the Emperour, or to draw profit from him against the haire, considering how strictly they are all linked together in interest, and affection the one to the other: and in giuing such a Councell, there must be want of integrity, or pure ignorance of the pre∣sent State of the affaires of Germany. The like must be said of the Children of the Marquis Edward For∣tunate, to whom the Marquisat of Baden hath beene lately adiudged by the Emperour, against and in prejudice of their Cosen the Marquis of Douelach, who is now turned out of it, which is an extent of land somewhat considerably betweene the Townes of Strasbourg and Basle, on the one side, and the Palatinate and Dutchie of Wirtemberg on the other. They haue likewise since a few Moneths possest themselues of a good part of the Langrauiat of Hes∣sen, vnder colour of a sentence giuen by the Empe∣rour, in fauour of the Langraue Louis of Darmstat, against his Cosen the Langraue Maurice of Kassell, (an ancient Allie and confident of the Crowne of France) upon their difference touching the Towne of Marspourg, and the countrey about it. And so by little and little they proceede, getting footing in the Prouinces of Germany, and oppressing the libertie of the Princes and Citties of the Empire: thereby to make it hereditary in their House; as they doe the Kingdomes of Hungarie and Bohemia, (which those peoples haue euermore maintained to be meerely Electiue.) together with the Provin∣ces of Moravia, Silesia, and Lusatia, incorporated to
the Kingdome of Bohemia, and newly reconquered by Armes and other meanes, to the great increasing of the House of Austria, and exceeding great aduan∣tage of their designes. We will not speake here of the Townes and For∣tresses of Arache, Mamora, and others in the King∣dome of Fez, surprised or conquered by the Spa∣niard since a few yeares, because they are far distant, and of lesse consideration to France. But touching the Fort of Grauelines, which they still aduance, and will by snatches bring it to perfection: we must blame our selues if we suffer it. But it would be a farre worse matter, if the Spaniard should conclude the Treaty of Marriage with England, for the rea∣sons which euery man may vnderstand; for if the onely Negotiation touching that Alliance, hath giuen the Spaniards time and meanes to subdue the best and greatest part of all Germany: and to push their designes so forward; what other thing can be expected from the accomplishment of the marriage, but that in the end we must receiue Law from the Conquerour, and so loose the prerogatiue of this glorious title, anciently wonne by our Kings, of Protectors of the liberty of Germany, and which is more, of Arbiters of Christendome: besides the fruit which we see lost before our eyes: of so many Millions employed since 100, or 120 yeares, to en∣tertaine our Allies the Switzers and Grizons, and other our friends and confederates; And of the expence made at the siege of Iuliers, to put it into the possession of the lawfull heires of the House of Cleue, whom the Spaniards laboured to dispossesse,
and to take it themselues: as they haue now done 10 yeares afterwards. For which notwithstanding, our ill-affected-Frenchmen haue professed publike ioy, although this place was formerly deliuered to the late Mareschall de la Chastre, generall of the Kings Army, being for the most part Catholicke. It must be also taken into consideration, that the Spaniards who for 70 yeares hath by diuers writings continuall blamed our Treaties: which the Turke doth now himselfe seeke that Alliance with much instance. The last from Constantinople beare, that one Antonio Barili, a Dominican Frier, who had bin there secretly twice before, was againe returned thither, with two others in his company: and that he hath been zealously seconded and assisted in pur∣sute of this peace, by the Emperours Ministers that were then at the Port: and now lately by one Curtz, who for this end hath carried thither a good summe of money; of all which the Grand Vizier himselfe, gaue aduertisement to some Ambassadors resident at the Port, and opposite to the Spanish Party, iudg∣ing his designe of the Emperor and King of Spaine to be for no other end, then by this Peace By a Peace with the Grand Signiour of the King of Spaine, would yearely saue the charge of 20 m. men kept in Garrison, vpon the Coastes of Naples, Sicilie, Sardinia, and those Islands, and of 60 Gallies, in which are of Souldiers and Slaues well nigh 20 m. more: All which great forces, the King of Spaine is forced with a vast expence, continually to maintaine for his owne safety and defence against the Turke. And it is considerable that this proposition of Peace, is made in a time when the necessities of the Turkish affaires, in regard of the present Rebellions and disordres in their Empire, threatning ruine, or at least some notable alteration, might make the offer acceptable. And that for the said respects, it could not for the present be either dangerous, or vnsafe for the King of Spaine; but would be of infinite aduantage to the progresse of his affaires in these parts, if so great forces as are now onely maintained for a meere defence, without attempting any thing, should be drawne forth into an actiue employment. to haue the better meanes and leasure to go through with
their businesse and conquests in Europe: and by de∣grees make themselues strong enough to vndertake the Turke, and then carrie their Armes into the Le∣uant. And to this end it is their writers publish, that it is necessary there should be but one vniuersall and absolute Monarch in Christendome, and that it should be the King of Spaine, who is the mightest, and who by their report hath the best mirited of the Apostolicke Sea, and of all Christendome. For their pretences, either vpon France in gene∣rall, drawing a discent of the Princes of the house of Austria, in a direct line from Male to Male, from Meroue, Childeric, and other Kings of France of the first race called Merouingiens: thereby inferring that the Kingdome belongs to them. Or vpon the Prouinces of Burgundy and Brittany in particular; These falsehoods haue beene lately solidly refuted by one of our most excellent and learned Antiqua∣ries. And touching their pretences vnto other Kingdomes, and particularly to England, the care and refutation thereof is to be left to those who haue most interest therein. The euidence of these pretences which haue been seconded by reall vnder takings and attemps, appeares sufficiently in Hereras History of Phillip the second of Spaine, in Cabrera, and in Camille Borrell, his Booke touching the pre∣rogatiue and dignity of the Catholicke King. Our France being therefore enuironed on all sides with the Teritories and Dominions of the Spaniard, and House of Austria, either of their an∣cient domaine, or new conquests, (which hath bin made in so short a time, as it seemes a thing prodi∣ous)
this State hauing thereby lost all its outworkes and bulwarkes: that is, the best and most powerfull friends and Allies: it seemes to be more then high time to awake out of this deepe and fatall Lethargie, whereinto our France is fallen by the disastrous death of our great Henry, and seriously to looke to our conuersation, by taking it into due considera∣tion, that if the Spaniard should now picke a quar∣rell with vs, and assaile vs againe: as in the time of the league, when Phillip the second would haue had this Crowne put vpon his Daughters head, in pre∣iudice of our Salique Law: the passages by Land would on all sides be shut vp against vs, so as we could not be relieued either with men or money from Germany, Switzerland, or Italie: as was our late King in his great necessities. And on the con∣trary, all the Princes and people subiect to the Spa∣niard, and those whom he hath lately subdued vnto him, who were formerly our friends, and fauoured vs: will be constrained and bound to assist and and serue against vs, and many of them to their great griefe. Yet is it not meant that recourse should presently be had vnto Armes, and the publique peace bro∣ken. as if so great a King in so powerfull a kingdome as this is, had no other meanes to protect the afflic∣ted. The late King in the like case, without ap∣plying those violent remedies, hath by his wisedome sufficiently shewed the way; as when by a serious interposition of his credit and authority, he accom∣modated the difference betweene the Pope and the Venetians: or when by his liberallity he succoured
those who besought his helpe: or when by mena∣ces, he gaue cause of apprehension to those that would oppresse his friends and Allies. And these are the meanes that ought to be vsed in the first place, before the way of open force be taken; all warres how iust so euer, being both ruinous and hazardous. True it is that the peace of this State, the vnion and concord of the people in a due obedience to our King, and the conduct of a wise Councell, that knowes how to resume the wise Councells and Maximes of Henry the great: and the former state of a good intelligence, with the most sincere friends and ancient confederats of this Crowne, are the first and principall remedies of this euill: yea, the su∣preame way for restoring this puissant and once flourishing Kingdome, to its ancient splendor, strength, and authoritie. FINIS.
