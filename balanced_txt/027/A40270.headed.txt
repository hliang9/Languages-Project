THE SUMM OF SUCH PARTICULARS AS ARE Charged against George Fox in the Mittimus by which he stands Committed; Together with George Fox his answer to the said Particulars. We Thomas Cummings and Thomas Green being sent by George Fox (now Prisoner in the Common Goal at Lancaster) to the Goaler to desire a Coppy of his Mittimus, that he might know wherefore he was committed; the Goaler answered that be could not give a Coppy of it, for another had been Fined for the like, but he gave us liberty to read it over, wherein was char∣ged against him (to the best of our remembrance) to this effect, That he was a Person suspected to be a Disturber of the Peace of this Nation, a Common Enemy to his Majesty our Lord the King, a chief upholder of the Quakers Sect, and that he, together with others of his Phanatique Opi∣on, have of late endeavoured to raise Insurrections in this part of the Country, to the imbruing the Nation in Blood, with command to the Goaler to keep him in safe cu∣stody, till he should be released by Order from the King and Parliament. I Am a Prisoner at Lancaster by Justice Porter; a Coppy of the Mittimus I cannot get, but such like expressions are found in it, which are untruths. First, That I am suspected to be a disturber of the Nations Peace, unto the King an E∣nemie,
and that I and others of my company should raise Insur∣rections to imbrew the Nation in Blood. All which is false, and I do deny every word in it to be Truth, for through the Nation have I been tryed of these things formerly. In the dayes of Oliver I was taken up as raising Arms against him, which was false, and I was taken up to London, and kept Pri∣soner till I was brought before him, and when things were cleared, and I denied drawing a Carnal Weapon against him, or any man upon the Earth, for my Weapons are Spiri∣tual, that takes away the occasion of War, and which leads into Peace. And after that Major Seily in Cornwall who sent me to Prison, when I was brought before the Judge, said, that I took him aside, and told him I could raise four thou∣sand men in one hour, which was false and a lye (and was then proved so to him) for such words I never spake to him; I never was found in any Plots, nor ever took any Engagement; nor never took any Oath, nor never learned War Postures, and so these things which come from Major Porter, who is lately appointed to be a Justice, who hath wanted Power formerly to Exercise his Cruelty against us, which is but the Wickednesse of the Old Enemie; for the peace of this Nation I am not a disturber of, but seeks the peace of it, and of all men, and stands for all Nations and mens peace upon the earth; And wish that all Nations and Men knew my Innocency in these things. And whereas Major Porter saith, I am a Common Enemy to the King, that is false, for my love is to him and all men (though Enemies to God, and to themselves and to me) and I can say it is of the Lord that he is come in to bring down many unrighteously set up, of which I had a sight before he came. Its much that he should say I am an Enemy to the King, for which I have no Reason, he having done nothing against me; yet I have been Imprisoned and Persecuted this eleven or twelve years, by them that have been against the Kings Father, which was the Party that Porter was made a Major by, and bore Arms for, and not them that were for the King; I was never a Common Enemy to the King, nor to any mans Person upon the Earth, but I am in the Love that fulfills the Law, and thinks no evil, but Loves Enemies, and would have the
King saved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth, and brought into the Fear of the Lord, and to receive his Wisdom from above, by which all things were Made and Created, that with that Wisdom he may Order all things to the Glory of God by whom it was Created. I ow nothing to the King but Love, nor to any man, and Love doth not kill but fufill the Law. And Major Porter further saith, That he together with others of his Phanatique Opinion, hath of late endeavoured to raise Insur∣rections in this part of the Countrey, to the imbrewing this Nation in Blood. This is false, to these things I am as a Child, and knows nothing of them, and never learned the postures of War, and my VVeapons are Spiritual, and not Carnal, and with Carnal VVeapons I do not fight; and my Kingdom is not of this World saith Christ, and those that follows Christ in the Spirit, the Captain of their Salvation denies the Carnal Weapons, who denies drawing any Carnal VVeapon against the King or the Parliament, or any man upon the Earth, yet we have these Lies and Slanders laid upon us who are come to the end of the Law, who loves Enemies and wrestles not with Flesh and Blood, and am in that which saves mens lives, and I witnesse against all Murtherous plots, and all such as would imbrew the Nation in Blood, which be not in Peace, and I am innocent of all these things and knows them not, and it is not in my Heart to have any mans Life destroyed upon the Earth. And Major Porter told me, he imprisoned me to prevent a danger, because times were troublesome, and we had meetings by hundreds. I told him we had kept our Meetings in most parts of the Nation to wait upon the Lord, but neither he nor any man in the Nation had any occasion to suspect me of any Tumultuous Meetings, or to raise any Tumult in the Na∣tion, who am a peaceable man, and desires the peace and good of all, and had not gone from the place where I was apprehended, passing two Miles in a Moneth since I came in∣to the Countrey. And Major Porter proffered the Oath of Allegiance to me to take, and I told him I never took Oath in my life of one side or the other, against or for my self, but did abide in
Christs Doctrine, who saith, Swear not at all, and did suf∣fer in that; And all people that have but the least sober∣nesse in them may see this to be but Malice and Envy of Major Porter in imprisoning and persecuting of me, and laying such things to my charge (up and down the Coun∣try) which I am innocent of as a child, and so I am ordered to be kept prisoner till I be delivered by order from the King or Parliament. These things are to be delivered to you to be laid before you to consider of before you act any thing, that you may in the wisdom of the Lord consider the intent and end of mens spirits, least you act the thing that will bring the hand of the Lord against you, and upon you as many have done before you that have been in Authority, whom God hath o∣verthrown, whom we trust unto, and fear, and cry unto day and night, who hath heard us, and doth hear us, and will hear us, and avenge our cause, for much innocent blood hath been shed, and many hath been persecuted to death, by such as have been in Authority before you, who turned against the just, whom the Lord hath vomitted out; Therefore consider with your selves, for now you have the day. From the Innocent, a Sufferer in Bonds, and close prisoner in Lancaster Castle, called George Fox. THE END.
