From the Commissioners of Scotland, 24 February, 1640. AS our Declarations and Remonstrances before our comming into England, were necessary for manifesting the Truth against the Lyes, and Calumnies of our Enemies, so did Wee conceive, that afterward they should not be needfull. Our deportments, and carriage in this great cause, which are no other in secret, then they are openly, being reall demonstra∣tions of the constant integrity of our Intentions, and proceedings, in all our ways. Malice, notwithstanding, is so impudent, and indefatigable, that although She hath printed on Her face the black characters of many grosse lyes, which are visible to all, and cannot be washed of, and although by the force of Truth, the Daughter of Time, Shee hath received many wounds and dashes, which shall never be cured, yet dare She open her mouth again, and wearieth not to keepe Her owne straine, but in a contrary course: for now beginneth She to suggest, that after We have in a good part obtained our own ends: We have lessened our care of our Neighbours, And that our love towards them is become luke-warm, that We are become remisse in our zeal against Prelacie, the cause of all our broyls, and in the pursuit of these two firebrands, which had wasted all, if God in his mer∣cy had not prevented so great a mischiefe. We marvell not at Malice, nor do We desire to be reconciled to her, for that were to lose our selves, and the Cause of God, And therefore We think it not strange that shee is the same, which shee hath beene, and must be to the end: But that by her suggestions, and practices, tending, by raising of jealousies and suspitions, to divide the two Kingdomes, the two Houses of Parliament, and either House in it selfe, shee should so far prevaile with any, who have not laid aside both wisdome and charity, as that the smallest jealousie or suspition of us should enter in their heart (for them to live and lodge, we will not permit.) This is it which hath caused this Paper. What just cause of indignation We had against these two Incendiaries is known by our Accusations, which (as Wee understand) are now published to the World, and by these also, beside our detestation expressed in all our Words, Writs, and Actions; Our judgment and intentions concerning Episcopacy both in Scotland and England, are in some measure expressed. Wee confesse it were levity, to be found building that which Wee have beene pulling downe, or to plant that which Wee have been plucking up. It were impiety to spare much more to plead for guilty Agag, and cursed Ba∣bell, which God in his justice hath destinate to destruction: And it were folly for us, and a denying of our owne ex∣perience, to imagine that both they, and the Kingdomes can have peace; but all these three imputations might be justly tripled upon us, if now after We have seen their works, and bitter fruits in England, Wee should not remember the Ma∣xime never to be forgotten, The safety of the People is the soveraigne Law, and that Mercy to the bad is cruelty against the good. And therefore, We desire that your Lordships would be pleased to represent so much from us to the Parliament, and with all, that for the present, according to the Commission given to us, Wee doe long to see Iustice done upon the Lievtenant of Ireland, earnestly craving according to the famous and laudable custome of that grave and honorable Coun∣sell, He may beare the punishment, which the atrocity of his Crimes doe deserve, Which should be much for his Maje∣sties honour, and for the peace of all his Majesties good Subjects, who will be out of hope of the redresse of their grie∣vances, if the wicked, who have caused all their woes, be either justified, or spared. Better that One perish then Vnity.
