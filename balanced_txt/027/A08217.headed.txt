For the Perfect is than / by the Per∣fectons / a liuing Fountaine / wherout the Waters of Life do flowe / and geeue euenso their Refreash∣ing {reversed ;}to the Releeuing of the thirstie Soules after the Righteousnes; out of the Testimonies of the holie Spirit of Loue.

Ther is demaunded / How the Children of Loue or of God do behaue themselues / and what-maner of Disposition and Nature then are of. And thervnto is answered by HN / this Resolution heere-following. AS touching this Matier / ther is much found witnessed in the holieLeuit. 1. Deut. 6. Mark. 12. Luk. 10. Rom. 13. Scrip∣ture / and it is also cleerlie testified / in the seruiceable Woorde4. Spe. 2. of the holie Spirit of Loue / that the true Children of God / haue a good

For the true holie Spirit of Loue {reversed ;}wherwith∣all they are sealed; leadeth them into allIohn. 13. 14. 16. 1. Iohn. 3. Trueth of the vpright Life: and manifesteth euenso in them / the vpright Wooes of Loue. And they2. Cor. 4. b. beare thesame cosilie Treasure in earthen Vessels / to the Lande and Honour of the almightie God: and are euenso of-one-minde with the three godlie Witnes∣ses / that beare-witnes in Heauen. 3.

Trueth / which is the Woord of God the Father / and IESVS CHRIST himself. And the third Witnes / is the holie Spirit of Loue or of God / and of the Trueth of Iesu Christ, which is the euerlasting Life / and the Inheritaunce of all spirituall and heauenlie Goods. 4. And thatsame euerlasting Life / together with the spirituall and heauenlie Goods / and euerlasting
Ioye / becometh reuealed and brought vnto Them that are borne out of God / in the heauenlie Beeing: and therthrough / they haue their fellowship with God / the Father / with his Sonne / the Lorde Iesus Christ, and with the Holie-gost of Loue / wherout they witnes and declare / the greatAct. 2.

For they witnes That / which they haue seene in the Godhead / and1. Iohn. 1. heard in the Heauen. And That is the holie Spirit which witnesseth with them: for the perfect Godhead / liueth and dwelleth in them. 6. For-that-cause also / the Children of Loue or of God / are the true1. Cor. 3. b. 2.

Temple of the liuing God / wherin God with his Christ and holie Spirit / dwelleth: and wherthrough they expresse their good Nature and Beeing / among all Men / euen as ther is saide. And in such-sort / the liuing God is their God / and They hisApo. 21. a. elected People: in whose Temple / ther is no Idoll / but alone the liuing God of Israel: nether is-ther also any Idolatry-seruice ministred theare. but alone the Ministrati∣on of Iesu Christ / with the spirituall heauenlie Goods of his holie Spirit of Loue. The Thirde Chapiter. A distinct Declaration / how that Hee which beleeueth in Christ / hath the euerlasting life.
THer is noman that beleeueth right∣lie in Christ, but Such with whom Christ is remayning or present / or which assem∣ble them to Him and his Doctrine / in his Name / and so becom his Disciples. (Therfore is all the Faith / that Men {reversed ;}without the Assembling vnto Iesus Christ and his Doctrine; assume or take-on of Christ {reversed ;}whether it be then out of the I∣magination of the Knowledge· out of the Good∣thinking of the Heart· or out of the Text or Letter; no Faith in Iesu Christ / that extendeth to the In∣heritaunce of Christ / in the eternall Life.) Ne∣ther-yet is-ther also anyman / that preacheth or teacheth the Woord or the Doctrine of Christ, but Such as haue first ben obedient Disciples of the Woord and of the Doctrine of Iesu Christ. and euenso {reversed ;}vnder the Obedience of the Loue of Christ; areMath. 13. g. taught to the Kingdom of Heauen: and in whom ChristGal. 4. c. hath then likewise his Shape. 2. For that cause / they all which haue not right∣lie beleeued in Iesu Christ / haue missed the eternall Life / as also the liuing Waters / wherof the Scrip∣ture maketh-mention / touching the Beleeuers in Christ, like-as ther standeth writen: WhosoIohn. 7. c. be∣leeueth in Mee (saith CHRIST) as the Scrip∣ture saith / from his Bodie shall flowe Riuers of liuing Water. Which liuing Waters / serue to the PurgingEzec. 36. c. of y• Heart or inward Minde / the which the vnilluminated Scripture-learned and vnsent Preachers / haue neuer out of the Letter {reversed ;}albeit that they testified thesame / and administred it / ac∣cording
to their Goodthinking; obtayned or could attaine vnto. For inasmuch as they turned them not about to theMath. 18. childish Simplicitie / so hath also the4.

But the Woord of the vpright Doctrine of Iesu Christ / that seruiceablie is administred {reversed ;}speak∣ablie or in Letters; out of the Loue / and out of the Light of Life / is trulie the vpright and safe-making Water or Doctrine / to the Purging of the belee∣uing and obedient Heartes of thesame Woord: For Christ the Sauiour / is present in thesame Seruice. 4. For-that-cause thesame seruiceable Woord {reversed ;}which is administred speakablie or in Letters / out of the Loue and out of y• true Light and euerlasting Life; is also2. Cor. 5. d.

IF wee now {reversed ;}with whole Heart; beleeue thus in Christ, and becomRom. 6. implanted into Him / so feele wee then also most-trulie / that Christ ؛the Woorde of Life{punctel}1. Pet. 2. d. beareth in vs our Sinnes / and suffereth for our Sinnes cause: wher∣through wee also are inclyned for to suffer with Him / and {reversed ;}to theRom. 6. a. Col. 2. b.

In such-sort verelie / wee knowe or vnder∣stand in the Beleef and Obedience of the Woord / how that the Woord or Christ /Iohn. 1. c. beareth our Sinnes / together with all our Frailtie and Ig∣noraunce: and how that likewise for that cause / the Elders in thesame Woord / take-vpp in Grace or Mercie / all the Sinnes / Weaknes / and Igno∣raunce of the Beleeuers of the Woord / and couer thesame with their Loue / vnder the Obedience of the same Woorde and his Doctrine. For in such-sort do the Elders and Ministers of the Woord {reversed ;}in their Seruice prepare and kindle the trespasIer. 33. .

And the Accomplishing of thesame Offer∣ing
/ is the Puriying of our Heartes / from all sin∣full Beeing. And thatsame is the true Gods-seruice in the Spirit / wherin wee1.

But the Lorde said vnto him: Not so / thy Ser∣uant shall not be thyne Heyre. but the Sonne which shall be borne out of thee: That is / out of the Faith of Abraham. 12. But so-long as the Heyre is yeatal. 4. a. younge / or first new borne by the Beleeuers of the Woord / and that also the Beleeuers are yeat younge or small in the heauenlie Vnderstanding / by Him: and euenso {reversed ;}as goodwilling Seruantes to the O∣bedience of their Lorde; haue a Lust {reversed ;}according to the Requiring of the seruiceable Woord; to doo the Will of the Lorde / So is-ther not any diffe∣rence made / betwixt the Heyre and the Seruant: but they stand both-alike vnder the Seruices of the gratious Woorde of y• Lorde {reversed ;}as vnder Tutours; till vnto theGal. 4. . appointed Time of the Father. In such like-sort is it also with all them / which beleeue the gratious Woord in his Seruice of Loue / and haue a Lust {reversed ;}according to the Requiring of the ser∣uiceable Woord; to doo the Lord-his Will.

Loue dealeth in such-sort with them: and euenso deale also the Elders in their Seruice / with the Communialtie of the Famelie of the Loue of Iesu Christ. For if the Elders in the Seruice of the Loue of Iesu Christ / chaunce to perceaue by anyone of the Communialtie / that hee enterprised any-thing / wherby hee mought be in daunger of his Destruction / or which mought happelie cause him to be estraunged from the Way to the good Life / so are they then very sorrowfull for such-aone / and seeke or vse {reversed ;}through the Testimonies of the holie Spirit of Loue; all-maner of Meanes / wher∣with they mought so preuent and infourme him / that hee may be preserued from his Destruction: and they admonish him so louelie and discreetlie as they are able / or so much as is necessarie for him ther-vnto.

WHen-as the Man is assaulied with any Temptation (be it then with anything whatsoeuer it be) / so groweth hee therthrough to perceaue / how firme / vnmoueable / or stedfast hee standeth comprehended in the Requiring of the gracious Woord: and in what Beeing (whether it be mutable or immu∣table) hee liueth and walketh. 2. If hee then {reversed ;}in his Assaulting; haue a right consideration on the gracious Woorde of the holie Spirit of Loue / and on the Seruice of his Requi∣ring / so shall hee then likewise rightlie perceaue and vnderstand / to what-maner of good Beeing that the gracious Woord requireth him / and with his Seruice / biddeth him for to com (whervnto hee is alsoGen. 1. c.

And hauing now seene-into thesame / so shall hee then likewise verelie {reversed ;}in Prayer vnto his God; suffer-out ye Assaulting goodwillinglie / and geeue God thankes for his

For euenso in the Temptation / the Man can well finde-out / on what Place hee standeth: and also perceaue / how farre-wyde hee yeat is from the God of Life· and from his louelie Beeing / which ought to haue his Dominion in him. and not / that wicked vngodlie Beeing / which hath raigned ouer him. 4. And when now the Man {reversed ;}in his Tempta∣tion; perceaueth and seeth-into thissame / so shall hee thenIam. 5. b. shew-fourth Pacience against the Assaul∣ting which so meeteth him / till that hee {reversed ;}in the O∣bedience of the Woorde; haue plucked-on a Stron∣ger / which subdueth the vngodlie Beeing of the E∣nemies of God / and vtterlie rooteth them out: For such a Grace receaue they all which heare and beleeue the gracious Woord of the holie Spirit of Loue / in his Seruice and Requiring / and are obedient to thesame. 5. Therfore ought wee not to afflict ourselues with ouer-much heauynes / when-as the Iniqui∣tie is stirred vpp in vs / in the tyme of our Tempta∣tion. but consider therthrough / how whollie that wee {reversed ;}in the Estraunging from our God; haue ben incorporated into the vngodlie Beeing: and so then to thanke God / for that Hee {reversed ;}through the seruice∣able Woord of his Loue; riddeth or leadeth vs

And therfore ought wee alwayes {reversed ;}vn∣der the Obedience of the Woord; toEsa. 59. c.

Heere-on may the goodwilling Man to the Righteousnes / take a good courraige / and trust and hope stedfastlie theron. For when-as the Man once plucketh-on his Sauiour / which is stronger then the Iniquitie that hath raigned ouer him or held him in subiection / then shall theMath. 1. c. Luk. 11. c. Col. 2. b.

Therfore shall our Hope {reversed ;}in all our Assaulting; rest alwayes grounded theron / till that Hee be¦com / which isAbac. 2. a. Heb. 10. d. for to com / according to the Pro∣mises. 8. And although now that wee {reversed ;}in our Assaul∣ting;

Seruant of the Sinne / ought not to seeke nor-yet take-on any Freedom vnto him / in y• Sinne: for thesame should then be altogether false. 11. For although that the Man seeke often∣times / to be vnbound or made-free from This or That / yet seeketh hee not thesame oftentimes / for☜
to be than a Seruant or Minister of the Lorde / nor-yet for the Lord-his Righteousnes cause: but for to liue at-peace / after his-owne Will· and ac∣cording to the Mindes of his Fleash.

When-as wee now see-into all this / accor∣ding to the Trueth / so ought wee onlie to seeke after the vprightIohn. . c.

And when wee then {reversed ;}at any time; perceaue / that wee are not {reversed ;}according to the Requiring of the Lord-his Woord; rightlie made-free / but rest yeat bound or owned / on our Mindes or Opinions / So shall wee not then seeke any other thing ther-against / but to becom Seruantes or Ministers of the Lorde / for to serue the Lorde / and to be altoge∣ther obedient / to the Requiring of his gracious Woorde and Seruice of Loue. 13.

A Man which hath humbled and geeuen-ouer himself obedientlie / vnder the Woorde of the Testimonies of the holie Spirit of Loue / shall likewise {reversed ;}euen as a true Disciple of the Woord; applye himself with all Dilligence / to the Requiring of the Woord / and with a full Hatred / hate the Iniquitie: in such-sort / that hee shall haue a Lust / with all his Heart / to the good Beeing of the vpright Righ∣teousnes· and vtterlie detest or abhorre the Ini∣quitie and her Ministers / when hee is assaulted by them. 2. And although now the Iniquitie {reversed ;}or her Mi∣nisters; would accuse thesame goodwilling Man / with anything that God nor his Woord requi∣reth / for to burden or snare his Conscience therin: Or although the wicked Beeing {reversed ;}for to make him vnbeleeuing to the Fourth-going of the good Life / and to declyne therfrom / or to wauer in his Con∣science; said inwardlie or outwardlie vnto him: Yea / what takest thou vpon thee / for to attayne to the Righteousnes / the which thou art in no-wise able to doo / and wherof also thou hast no Sight nor Vnderstanding: for thou art doubtles becom altogether one Bodie and Minde / with the Ini∣quitie. For-that-cause also / thou belongest alto∣gether to the Iniquitie: and thesame hath whollie the Dominion ouer thee / to thy Condemnation.
3. Howbeit / although such-thinges chaunce vn∣to the Man / by the Instinction or Perswasion of the Iniquitie / in his Inwardnes / yet shall not the Man therfore / geeue any credit to the Iniquitie or to the wicked Consciences (seeing that hee is not of-one-minde with the Iniquitie) / nether-yet let himself1. Ioh. . c. be iudged of his euell Conscience: but hee shall geeue somuch the greater credit and regard to the great Grace1. Pet. 1. c. and Mercie of God / which God hath brought vnto him / through his graci∣ous Woord and Seruice of Loue; for therthrough shall the Perswasion of the Iniquitie / vanish-away by him / and perrish or com-to-nought. 4. For if the Iniquitie {reversed ;}when-as wee consented vnto her; hath obtayned the Victorie in vs / How much-more then shall God with his Grace {reversed ;}which doubtles is muchMath. 12. c. Luk. 11. c. stronger then the Iniquitie; pre∣uaile or take the Victorie in vs {reversed ;}in far-more aboun∣dant Power; against the Iniquitie {reversed ;}seeing that wee now hate the Iniquitie / and geeue our consent vn∣to the Good; / and through ye Seruice of the Loue / purgeHeb. 9. d. our Consciences from the Iniquitie; and euenso prepare and make vs meete / for to inherit his Kingdom and euerlasting Life. 5. When the Man now findeth himself in such a Battaile / so shall hee then holde himself fast / in theEphe. 6. . Beleef and Hope of his Saluation / and hum∣ble himself alwayes obedientlie / vnder the gracious Woord of the Lord and the Requiring of his Seruice of Loue: and also keepe a stedfast Hope on theIohn. 14. 16. 2. Pet. 1. d. Promises of the Woord. For theRom. . a. Hope will
not suffer him to com to reproch· but bring the Pa∣cience vnto him / in his Assaulting / to a Releassing of him from his Temptation. 6. The Man now standing euen-thus in his Abascing / shall pray continuallie vnto God / and speake {reversed ;}against the Iniquitie and her Perswasions; in his Heart: No / thou Iniquitie / ther belongeth nothing-at-all vnto thee: No / not the smallest Heare of my Head: For thou art ofApo. 17. b. Nothing / and to-nothing shalt thou goe againe / in the Con∣demnation. 7. With such a Beleef in the Pacience / shall wee keepe ourselues against the Assaultinges and Per∣swasions of the Iniquitie / and speake with our Minde & Thoughtes boldlie ther-against / & saye▪ 8. O thou Iniquitie / I belong not vnto thee / that thou shouldest holde mee as thine Owne: for thou hast not created mee. But the God of the Liuing and of all Righteous / isGen. 1. my Creatour▪ and to him do I belong. But in that thou hast gotten the Dominion ouer mee / therto hastGen. 3. b. thou begyled mee with thy Falshod / and hast euenso destroyed mee / and made mee subiect vnto thee. But now {reversed ;}through Gods Grace and his Seruice of Loue; my Hope resteth on thesame God / my Cre∣atour / that Hee will {reversed ;}against thee; take againe the Dominion ouer mee. 9. Wherfore should I {reversed ;}O thou Iniquitie; think / according to thy Perswasion / that anye-thing should appertaine vnto thee / or that thou shouldest haue any Power for to condemne Mee / through
thy Infidelitie / wheras thou art risenvpp {reversed ;}out of the Condemnation; euen of Nothing / and hast euensoRom. 7. . taken captiue myne Heart {reversed ;}with that which is Nothing; in thy Bandes? Therfore will I altogether submitt mee / vnder God my Creatour / Hee will help mee vp againe / and {reversed ;}through his Woord and Seruice of Loue; releasse mee from thy Bandes / and bring thee againe to-nothing / in the Condemnation / like-as thou mast before tyme. 10. BEholde / In such-sort shall the Man applye himself {reversed ;}against the Iniquitie and her Counsaile and Perswasions; to the good Beeing of God: and haue and vpright Difference / betweene that which is Nothing {reversed ;}or proceedeth out of Nothing; and the good Beeing / that pro∣ceedeth out of the Fulnes of God / and is admini∣stred vnto him. For / so much as the Man appro∣priateth or owneth himself to that which is No∣thing or vayne / so much falleth hee away from the good Beeing. And so much as heeG. 3. falleth-away from the good Beeing / or estraungeth himself ther∣from / so much Iudgment of the Condemnation plucketh hee ouer himself: And so much as hee loueth his Goodthinking / and that which is No∣thing or vayne / so much loueth hee the Darknes. And That is the MansIohn. . . Condemnation / when hee loueth the Darknes / more then the Light. It is very▪ true.
The XI. Chapiter. A cleere Demonstration / that the Seruice of the Lawe after the Letter / and the Seruice of Christ after the Fleash / haue both one  Ministration to the Death of y• Sinne: and that then the new Birth in Iesu Christ after the Spi∣rit / springeth therout. IF anye Ministers of the holye Woorde should saye: Wee publish the Lawe / and minister and teach thesame / to a Mortifying of the Sinne / and to a Death and Burying of thesame / seeing that the∣same Seruice / is the right Priestes-office of the Lawe. Or-els if they should saye: Wee publish Christ after the Fleash / vnto the Beleeuers of Christ / to an Entraunce {reversed ;}with Christ; intoRom. 6. the lyke Death of his Crosse (to-wit / into the Obe∣dience of the Beleef of Christ) and to mortifie and burie the Sinne / So is-it both right / and well saide / if the Lawe of the Lorde and his Christ haue a Shape in thesame Minister: and it is both one-maner of Seruice / vnto the Beleeuers of ye Woord to a Righteousnes of Life. 2. For / to administer Christ after the Fleash / is a Seruice / which also {reversed ;}life-as the Seruice of the Lawe; reacheth toRom. . b. the Death of the Sinne: and so then fourth / to the Making-aliue of y• Inward-man of God / in Iesus Christ after the Spirit. 3. Therfore saith Peter thus: Christ hath suf∣fered for vs / and1. Pet. 2. c. left vs such an Example / to thend that wee should followe his Foote-steppes. 4. Christ himself saith also: Whosoeuer will be my Disciple / let himMath. 10. 16 Mark. . Luk. . 14. forsake himself / and take∣vpp his Crosse on him / and followe after mee. And
That is the right Imitacion of Christ, that wee should followe-after him {reversed ;}in the Doctrine of his Requiring; obedientlie / euen vnto hisRom. 6. Death and Burying / and vnto his Resurrection from the Death. And This is the Inheriting of the eter∣nall Life / in the heauenlie Beeing / wherin Christ after the Spirit / liueth and triumpheth {reversed ;}with his Father and all his Sainctes; perpetuallie. 5. Therfore / to thende that hys Disciples / mought inherit the eternall Life with Him / they must first followe-after Him {reversed ;}in the Fore-going of his Doctrine and Requiring; obedientlie / till into his lyke Death / and then euenso out of thesame Death / obtaine the new Birth in Iesu Christ after the Spirit / and inherit the eternall Life. 6. For-that-cause / men ought to consider right∣lie / on both these Sayinges / of the Lawe and of Christ after the Fleash: For in themselues they haue both / one Minde or Sence: and leade both to one Entraunce of the Mortifying and Depriuati∣on of all vngodlie Beeing. For all that which go∣eth-before out of God / before the new Birth in Iesu Christ after the Spirit / and hath his Ministrati∣on to the true Righteousnes / doth point or direct the Man to the Death and Laying-away of the Sinne in the Fleash. And That is it wherof Paule speaketh / saying: The Letter2. Cor. 3. . slayeth [namelie / the Ministration of the Lawe after the Letter / or the Ministration of Christ after the Fleash.] And That is nothing-els / but that the Letter / accord∣ing to the Requiring of the Lawe / and according
to the Requiring of Christ / pointeth and leadeth vsRom. 6. to the Death of the Sinne / and withdraweth euenso our Mindes and Thoughtes / from all that which is vngodlie· and vayne and consumeable on the Earth / for that wee mought euenso attaine to the euerlasting Vnconsumeablenes / in the eternall Life / wherin all Vnderstandinges of pure Heartes do liue and dwell. 7. BEholde / in such-sort and to such a Ful∣filling of the Lawe and the Propheates / is the Seruice of the holie Woorde / in the Letter / with the Letter / and through the Letter: For the Ministration of those-same soundeth euenso / and requireth thesame. For when-as wee perceaue any∣thing in vs / that tendeth to the Lust of the Sinne / ther-against doth the seruiceable Woord teach vs / to mortifie and burie thatsame: for-as-much as the same is his Requiring. 8. And when-as wee then do humble ourselues obedientlie / vnder the Lawe or vnder the seruiceable Woord / for to accomplish thesame in his Requi∣ring: and to becom euenso {reversed ;}with the Lawe / or with Christ after the Fleash / and with his Faith to Iustification;Rom. 6. implanted into Christ with lyke Death· baptised in his Death· and washed with his Bloud / So cometh-ther then vnto vs / the Spi∣rit of the Lawe / or theRom. . b. Making-aliue in Iesu Christ after the Spirit. It is very-true.
The XII. Chapiter. A cleere Demonstration / that the Man hath not any-Good of himself: but receaueth it all of the Lorde and his Grace. O Yee goodwilling Heartes to the Seruice of the Loue / suffer-pacientlie and beare-withRom. 15. a. Gal. 6. a. 1. Tess. 5. b. each-other in your Weat∣nes: and infourme each-other with the Coadiuuation or Hand-reaching of the seruiceable Woord of the holie Spirit of Loue. And if any-man chaunce to fall / so help-vpp then each-other againe: and hee that bydeth standing / let him laude the Lord / for his Strength. For y• Strength {reversed ;}or the Power; so much as thesame remayneth with vs / to the Good / is onlie the Lordes / out of his Grace. and not out of our-selues. 2. For-that-cause / think or haue alwayes before your Eyes / in your Fourth-going to y• good Bee∣ing of God / that yee haue receaued all your Lust / Loue / and Stabilitie or Faithfulnes {reversed ;}which yee shewe to the Lorde and his Woord; of the Lorde and his Grace. 3. For what haue yee {reversed ;}I pray you; to serue the Lorde with all / but that yee haue1. Par. 19. c. 1. Cor. 4. b. Iam. 1. a. receaued it of the Lorde: or the Lorde must first bring thesame vnto you / by his Grace and Mightynes: both all that wherwith yee serue your-selues & another also? 4. Therfore ought the Man alwayes to holde himself {reversed ;}in the Obedience of the seruiceable Woord; humble or lowlie of Heart / and also to feare the Lorde continuallie: and euenso {reversed ;}in the Feare of the Lorde; alwayes to thinke: O Lorde! How should I out of myself / haue perceaued or knowen my
Sinnes / Except that they had ben made-knowen vnto mee / through thy seruiceable Woord / and that it were graunted mee to perceaue them by thy Grace: and that thou euenso {reversed ;}through thy Power or Mightynes; releasedst mee therfrom? For if I {reversed ;}O Lorde; haue any Loue to thee and thy Woord / so haue I then receaued thesame / of thy Grace [namel / in theRom. 10. c. Hearing & Crediting of the Mi∣nistration of thy Woord.] For in Mee {reversed ;}through my Consenting to the Sinne; ther is nothing-els but all InclinationGen. 6. a. Rom. 7. b. to the Destruction. And if I {reversed ;}O Lorde; remaine standing {reversed ;}in any Righteous∣nes; by thy Woord / so cometh thesame to mee from thy Grace / and from the Power that thou hast geeuen or brought vnto mee. 5. For-that-cause trulie / wee must needes al∣wayes confesse / that wee cannot bring any Good vnto God / nor-yet serue him with anything / but with That which wee haue receaued of Him and his Grace. 6. Thissame acknowledged likewise the kinglie Propheat Dauid and the holy Salomon, when-as they presented or offered-vpp their Sstes or Oblation / before the Lorde / and saide:. P. . c. O Lorde / All thinges com of thee / and that which wee haue receaued at thyne Handes / that haue wee brought againe vnto thee. 7. Euen-thus after thesame maner / must the Man also acknowledg / that all what-euer hee gee∣ueth-ouer to the Lorde or bringeth vnto Him / and serueth him with-all / is the Lord-his Good: and
that hee bringeth againe vnto ye Lorde / that which hee hath receaued of Him. 8. But if now the man thinke otherwise / or that hee account thesame / to be his-owne Woorke / so misseth hee the Right / and looketh vpon his owne Dooing {reversed ;}wherthrough hee seeketh Praise or Ho∣nour; and not vpon the Lordes Grace / for to laude and thanke therin the Lorde / for his Guift. 9. But a lowlie Man / which acknowledgeth that all that which is good / and don by Hym as good or wel-don / is the Lord-his Good and Wel∣dooing / as the Guift of the Lorde1. Cor. 4. b. which hee hath receaued: and euenso thanketh the Lorde / for that which is Hys / and {reversed ;}according to the Requiring of the seruiceable Woord of the Lorde; bringeth-againe vnto the Lorde / that which is Hys / Hee knoweth then himself a-right / howAp. 3. d. poore that hee is / as also of himself / the Most-feeble or Infirmest: and that the Lorde onlie / is all in All. And acknow∣ledgeth euenso {reversed ;}in the Beleef; to haue receaued all Good and2. Cor. 4. b. Strength / at the Lordes Handes. 10. And euenso in such a Confessing {reversed ;}that wee are altogether poore and infirme of our-selues; will God be gracious vnto vs / and {reversed ;}with his Guiftes; bring his Power vnto vs. And when wee then / cō∣fesse it all to be the Lordes {reversed ;}to-wit / that wee haue receaued all that is good / of the Lord; / so shall wee then also haue alwayes {reversed ;}vnder the Obedience of the Seruice of Loue; compassion towardes another / which staggereth or falleth / or that is not yeat so al∣together perfect: and euensoRom. 15. d. Gal. 6. . beare-with and suffer
one-another / and help-vpp each-other from the Fall. 11. When wee now in such-sort / shew-fourth the Loue one towardes another / so shall then also eue∣ryone be moued to thinke in himself: Oh {reversed ;}alas; If ther were no Grace nor Loue shewed on mee· ne∣ther any Helpe chaunced vnto mee / by the Lord and his Ministers of the Woorde / so should I then doubtles myself / haue still remayned the greatest Sinner / and the Most-weake / among the Chil∣dren of Men. 12. If wee now doo euen-thus / and deale or be∣haue ourselues so {reversed ;}in all Grace and Loue; towardes each-other / so geeue wee then the Honour onlie vn∣to God / and not vnto our-selues: And the Euell shall likewise euenso be washed-away· and all Of∣fencifenes cleene rooted-out / from among vs: and ther shall be nothing that can1. Pet. . b. hinder vs / for to haue our conuersation in all Loue and vpright Righteousnes / one with an-other. The XIII. Chapiter. A groundlie Instruction / how wee should be faithfull / to the Lorde and his gracious Woord: also geeue-ouer ourselues whollie therto: and {reversed ;}with faithfull Heartes; cleane vnto thesame. A Man which loueth the vpright Righteousnes / cannot applye himself vp∣rightlie thervnto / before that hee haue whol∣lie geeuen-ouer himself / to the gracious Woord and his Seruice of Loue / for to be obedi∣ent vnto the Woord; and is euenso admitte her∣to
/ by his Elder in the holie Vnderstanding and Minister of the gracious Woorde / for to becom taught therin. 2. And although now all this com thus to∣passe / or when-as thesame hath in such-sort his En∣traunce / so is not the Man then receaued or ad∣mitted vnder the gracious Woord of the Lorde / that hee should liue / besides the Doctrine of the Woord / vnto himself or his Goodthinking. but that hee should2. Cor. 5. b. shewe all Obedience and Faithful∣nes / to the Woord / and to the Seruice of his Doc∣trine or Requiring. 3. For when-as the Man is receaued by the gracious Woord / in his Seruice of Loue / for to stand obedient: and that hee hath consented ther∣vnto / so hath hee then geeuen-ouer himself and his Fidelitie / to the gracious Woord and to the Ser∣uice of his Requiring / for to doo {reversed ;}through thesame Woorde and his Seruice; the Will of the Lorde. 4. For euenso in the Coniunction of the Man to the gracious Woord of the Lorde / and to his Seruice of Loue / the Man entreth into the Testa∣ment of the Promises of God the Father: and so voweth or promiseth himself / before God and his Holyons / that hee will cleaue onlie to the Woord and his Requiring· shewe faithfull Obedience / out of his whole Heart and Minde· and not sepe∣rate himself therfrom for-euer: nether-yet also to turne his Heart and Minde {reversed ;}at any tyme; to any∣thing that the Woorde itself is not or requireth / or that is not one with the Woord. but to loue the∣same
with all his Heart: like as a faithfull Espow∣sed-wife promiseth her Husband / not to loue nor addict herself to any other / nor-yet to depart from him / for any maner of cause. 5. Verelie / euen so whollie and altogether ought wee also to cleaue vnto the Woord and to the Ser∣uice of his Requiring: in such-sort / that y• Woord and his Requiring / should be y• Deerlyest-beloued in our Heartes. For at that time {reversed ;}when wee haue turned our Loue so whollie to the Woord and his Requiring; ther can no Assaulting indamaige or hinder vs: Yea / although ther came an hundred thowsand. For wee are so fast-knitt and established with the Loue of our Heart / on the Woord and his Requiring / that they all / are not able to pluck vs from the Woord / nor to make vs consent to any Euell or Vanitie. For the Lord {punctel}the strong God{punctel} is than our Helper / andMath. 6. b. Luk. 11. a. Releasser from all Euell. 6. For in like-maner / as a faithfull Espowsed-wife loueth her Husband so intirelie / that all her Heart / Minde / and Delight / is whollie swallow∣ed-vpp in him and to him / and that hee is euenso the Deerlyest-beloued in her Heart: Yea / so beloued / that although a thowsand diuers Intisers would go-about to pluck her Loue to them / yet should it be all in vaine. For such-a-one {reversed ;}through the Loue which shee hath sett to her Espowsed-husband; bideth still faithfull to her Husband / Euen so fast and stable shall wee also holde vs / on the gracious Woord / and on the Requiring of his Seruice of
Loue: in such-sort / that thesame should be ye Deer∣lyest-beloued / in our Heartes / to thend that wee euenso {reversed ;}through the Loue; mought bide altogether faithfull vnto thesame· and indeuour vs alwayes obedientlie / according to the Requiring of his Seruice of Loue: and that thesame mought be all our Lust and Will. 7. But / if in the meane time {reversed ;}er-euer wee be so altogether swallowedvpp in the Loue of y• Woord; ther chaunce anyIob. 5. b. Iam. 1. a. Temptation / by our Paramours {reversed ;}which wee in times-past haue loued; to com vnto vs or assault vs / So shall wee then turne-away our Loue altogether from them / and turne thesame whollie and in all / to the Woorde of Grace: and exercise ourselues fourth-and-fourth / in his Ser∣uice of Loue: and euenso crye and pray vnto God for Helpe / to ourMath. 6. b. Luk. 11. a. Releassing from their Temp∣tation / and from the Euell / whervnto they would seduce vs: and so with the Grace and Helpe of the Lorde / to take good-heede / that wee incline not to their Desires / for to commit sinne with them. 8. But if they take or lay-holde on vs with Force and Violence / and that then {reversed ;}although wee crye; ther cometh not any Power nor Helpe vnto vs / for to withstand them in their Force and Vio∣lence▪ and that they euenso rauish vs against our Will / so are wee giltles of the Transgressing: For wee haue cryed / for to be releassed from the Ti∣rannie of the Euell / and ther is no Helpe com vnto vs. Of which giltles Transgressing / the Lawe likewise witnesseth / where it saith: A Woman
which is violentlie-taken in the Feelde {reversed ;}wher-as ther is not any Helpe; and so rauished (and al∣though shee haueDeut. 22. d. cryed alowde / yet gotten no Helpe) shee shall be giltles of the Transgressing. But if shee be in the Howse with any-bodie / and so holdeth her peace / then is shee giltie in the Trans∣gressing of Matrimonie. 9. In like-maner also with vs: When wee are assaulted with any Temptation / against ye Woord and his Requiring / wher-as ther is well Helpe to be had or co-by / in the Seruice of the Woord / or by the Ministers of thesame / if wee made-ma∣nifest our case: but wee keepe-scilence therof / and fall to y• Errour of Adulterie / So do wee then commit synne / and are giltie of the Transgressing. For if wee crye not to God nor by his Ministers for Helpe / but keeping-scilence / do synne / and then also not confesse the Sinne: but {reversed ;}as much as wee may; hide or couer thesame / So are wee verelie Consen∣ters to the Iniquitie / and Adulterers against the Lorde and his holie Woorde. 10. But if wee desire not to addict vs to the Lustes nor Temptation to the Iniquitie / nor to doo after her will / so shall wee then alwayes {reversed ;}in all our Assaulting; thinke in our Heartes / and al∣so confesse still by the Assaulters / that wee haue no power {reversed ;}contrary to the Requiring of the Woord; ouer our owne Bodie / as to geeue-ouer thesame to the Transgressing: but that it belongeth onlie vnto the Lorde / to his Seruice. Wherof also Paule witnesseth an Example vnto vs / wher hee
sayth / that a Woman / hath not1. Cor. 7. a. 1. Pet. 3. a. Power of her owne Bodie. but the Man / with whom shee is entred into Matrimonie. 11. Euenso should wee also haue this alwayes before our Eyes / and acknowledg / that our Bodie / is not Our Bodie {reversed ;}for to doo therwith our owne Will and Lustes; but the Lordes / for to vse the∣same / to an1. Cor. 6. b. Instrument of his seruice / and to all Vprightnes and Equitie: and that wee also haue promised and yealded-vpp thesame {reversed ;}to Righteous∣nes; vnto the Lorde: and haue not any Power to vse thesame to any-thing els. as likewise all what∣euer is gouerned vnder our Handes. 12. Therfore shall the Man alwayes continew in Prayer / and so in hisEphe. 6. c. Col. 4. a. Prayer / watch conti∣nuallie against all the Assaulting of the Sinne: and not esteeme thesame Assaulting ouer-light / al∣though hee somtimes {reversed ;}with little Greef or Trouble; hath ben released therfrom. 13. For a Man which hath ben assaulted by any Wickednes or Vanitie / and is easelie com-thorowe thesame Assaulting / thinketh then som∣times so-much the lightmindeder: I am passed-thorowe the Assaulting or Temptation thus ease∣lie: Let it hardelie com-on againe / I knowe wel-enough how to resist and -from thesame. But {reversed ;}oh alas; When the Man now begineth in such-sort to trust so-much on himself / & that hee meaneth euenso / out of his Prudence or owne Power / to perseuer or bide-stedfast theragainst / so doth the Sinne then vanquish him / easeliest-of-all.
14. For when-as the Sinne or the Iniquitie / doth {reversed ;}in such a self-conceited Purpose of his; assault him / and that hee perswadeth himself / that it can not indamaige him / so shall hee then verelie finde himself oftentimes in the Assaulting / to be to vn∣mightie / for to bide-stedfast therin / and euenso want the Grace and Helpe of the Lorde. 15. Therfore shall the Man alwayes feare the Lorde / and continew still inEphe. 6. c. Col. 4. a. 1. Tess. 5. c. Prayer. If it then be well with him / as that the Sinne {reversed ;}with her As∣saulting; doth not ouercom hym / so shall hee geeue God thankes for his Grace / and euenso thinke and confesse in his Heart: 16. O God / the Power of my Stedfastnes {reversed ;}so much as thesame remayneth with mee; cometh onlie2. Cor. 4. b. from Thee and from thy Grace / and not / from my-self. Therfore {reversed ;}O God / full of Grace; If that the Assaulting chaunce for to meete with mee againe / so extend thou then alwayes {reversed ;}I beseech thee; ouer Mee poore feeble Man / thy Grace and Mercie: and be thou thyself alwayes {reversed ;}I beseech thee; my Power and Strength / wherby that I may in the euell Daye of my Temptation {reversed ;}as a iust2. Tim. 2. . Souldier; resist the Iniquitie· and euenso keepe the Fielde or the Victorie with Thee and thy Woord / to the Implting of mee in thy Righ∣teousnes. 17. BEholde / euen-thus ought the Man alwayes to continew in Prayer / to the Lorde / and alwayes to shewfourth Pacience / and to keepe a sharpe watch / against all his Enemies of
the vpright Life / andEphe. 6. b. 1. Pet. 5. b. against all the Perswasions of the Iniquitie wherwith-all hee is assaulted. 18. Therfore {reversed ;}my Beloued; take this Mater well to heart: For I declare thissame vnto you / in most-groundlie wise / for that yee should not faile to vnderstand it aright / and1. Iohn. 2. . not commit any sinne. And if it chaunce that anyman {reversed ;}through Weaknes; do sinne / yet let him not couer his Sinnes: but let him confesse them before his Elder in the holie Vnderstanding / andMath. 3. a. Act. 3. c. repent him / so shall then the Lorde be gracious vnto him / and forgeeue him his Sinnes. For whosoeuer beareth-sorrowe for his Transgressing / and soPro. 28. b. Eccli. 4. 17. confesseth his Sinnes / and leaueth them / shall obtaine Mercie / also be holpen-vpp out of y• Fall of Sinne· and purged from his Sinnes. But whosoeuer couereth his Sinnes or Transgression / and liueth therin / and keepeth them to himself / is a Deceauer / and hath no good in his minde. It is very-true. The XIIII. Chapiter. Of the vpright Patience / vnder the holie Woorde and his Seruice of Loue. THe Man which turneth himself to the gracious Woord and his Seruice of Loue / or geeueth-ouer himself for to be obedient / and that is admitted by the El∣ders and Ministers of thesame Woord and Ser∣uice / for to stand obedient / shall not enterprise or take-on anye-thing / besides the Woord and his
Seruice / nor besides the Obedience of his Re∣quiring: but all what seemeth good vnto him be∣sides y•same / or that chaunceth to meete / m-vnto / or assault him for to take-on thesame / thatsame shall hee sett in the Pacience. Yea / if it were so that any Ioy came vnto the Man / so shall hee neuer∣thelesse sett thesame in theEccli. 2. . Pacience / and beare thesame also himself / in maner-of-suffering: and so take good-heede / that hee adde not his owne Ioy therto. 2. For ther cometh often-times / a certen Ioy vnto the Man / which-proceedeth not out of the vp∣right Beeing of God / nether-yet bideth thesame as a stedfast Beeing / with the Man: and for-that-cause it is not the euerlasting Ioy / which the gra∣cious Woord requireth or promiseth. And therfore shall the Man alwayes place or sett his Ioy / in the Pacience. If then the Beeing of his Ioy / be out of Gods Beeing / so shall thesame Ioye / well remayne stedfast in the Pacience. But if it be not / so shall it then sodenly vanish-away. 3. In like-maner also shall the Man / when any Sorrowe or Distresse cometh vnto him / not adde any Sorrowe therto: although notwith∣standing it chaunceth so often-times: and should not be / if that the Man applyed himself rightlie to the Requiring of the gracious Woorde. For when-as the Man hath or receaueth somtimes and Ioye / which hee conceaueth to be a permanent Ioy of God (wherin hee delighteth and reioyceth him verymuch) and thinketh also in his Heart:
O God / it is presentlie so well and good with mee: I stand now so free and loose from all Captiuitie or Ownednes / and my Heart is now so well at-peace: and if hee now passe-on-fourth so light-heartedlie therwith / and setteth not thesame in the Pacience / So shall then verelie thesame Ioye / Freedom / and Appeasement / faile or perrish againe by him. 4. And when hee then becometh quitt againe of thesame / together with all the sweete Tast and Zeale which hee hath had therin / or when-as the∣same vanisheth by him / so is that then oftentimes a great Greef vnto him. And when hee then find∣eth himself againe in such Heauynes / so doth hee then offende also therin / like-as in the Ioy: and setteth not his Sorrowe / in the Pacience: but hee addeth more Sorrowe / of his owne Sorrowe / therto: and getteth euenso somtimes / an1. Reg. 16. . 18. c. 19. b. vnquiet Spirit / which vexeth him: wherthrough hee then also thinketh {reversed ;}other-whyles; with himself: 5. Oh / I had such a Ioye and Quickning! Oh / that I had kept thesame! Oh / it must be myne owne Fault / in that I am quit therof: or / I must haue neglected thesame! And more such like / think∣eth the Man then. With the which hee oftentimes accuseth and vexeth himself / the which the Woord requireth not. And thinketh al-to-little on the vp∣right Righteousnes / which is required by the Woorde / wherout the vpright Ioye proceedeth. 6. THerfore / let vs sett Al-thingesHeb. 1. . in the Pacience / be it then Ioye or Sorrowe / or els-what that cleaueth on vs: and euenso endure

Obedience of the Woord; com vnto vs / and remayne with vs euerlastinglie. 7. For although it were so that any consume∣able Ioye / should fayle or fal-away from vs / yet let vs not be sorrowfull for thesame. but stay vs alwayes obedientlie / on the Woord and his Re∣quiring / and euenso receaue or take-vp it all in the Pacience. Yea / although wee should be assaulted with any Sinnes or vnquiet Spirites / yet let vs alwayesIam. 5. b. perseuer firme in the Pacience / and con∣sent at no time / to the Desires of the Sinne: and chuse euenso to dye rather on the Pacience / with Christ, then to sinne with any Ioye or worldlie Sorrowe / or to liue in the Sinne. 8. Beholde / euen-thus (as is saide) shall wee let ourselues be fastened {reversed ;}with the Obedience of the gracious Woord; on the Pacience of Christ, till that wee are {reversed ;}in the DeathRom. 6. of the Pacience of Iesu Christ; passed-thorowe our Death of the Pa∣cience· and so iustified from the Sinne. 9.

But if now wee desire to applye ourselues vprightlie / to the Woord of the Lorde / and to his Seruice of Loue / so shall wee not then deale in such-sort: but wee shall first {reversed ;}in the Seruice of the Woord; shewe faithfull Obedience: Not {reversed ;}verelie; after our owne Counsell and Will / nor yetDeut. 12. b. 29. c. as wee

HOwbeit / if the Sinne oppresse or tor∣ment vs: or if wee feele in our Inward-parted / any harde Buffettes / or great Sorrowe / yet shall wee not then seeke out of ourselues / to doo thus or so / for to becom released {reversed ;}without the Re∣quiring of the Woorde / or Counsell of the Elders; from thesame (like as the Man in his taken-on Zeale / oftentimes doth:) but wee shall sett it all / in the Pacience / and com-thorowe thesame / accor∣ding to the Counsell of the Elders. For / how-much
the-more y• Man seeketh with his owne Counsell / to doo thus or so / or to be released heerthrough or therthrough / so-much the-faster becometh hee bound on his vaine Beeing and Purpose. 16. For when-as the Man bindeth himself on his owne Purpose / so bindeth hee himself so-much the-stronger on the Imagination of his Knowledg: and laboureth euenso therwith / for to becom free.

And therfore is the Imagination of his Knowledg / a great Hinderaunce or Lett vnto him / for to com to the vpright Beeing. 19. For ther shall noman attaine to the vpright Beeing / but through the Obedience of the Woord / in the Beleef of Iesu Christ: and so to. 5. b. shew-fourth Pacience therin.

Secondlie / their Good-thinking or their Pleasure in the Fleash or in the carthlie Thinges / should also estraunge them from the pure Bewtie of the heauenlie Beeing / and so bring them into grea∣ter Errour of Destruction / then that wherin they walked before. 12. Thirdlie / their Errour should {reversed ;}through their Pleasure in thesame; incorporate them againe much faster and stronger {reversed ;}to pernitious Members of the Deuell; into the Deuell and his vngodlie Beeing / then they to-fore were incorporated into him. 13.

and to a plucking of the Destruction ouer them∣selues / and also ouer other moe. 15. Thissame is verely the Destruction / of the which all the Disciples of the Woorde and of the Doctrine of his Seruice· and all Bretheren and Sisters in the Familie of the Loue of Iesu Christ / shall warne one-an-other: And for that cause {reversed ;}for to bide kept from thesame Destruction; let eueryone applye himself so-much the dilligenter to the Doc∣trine and Requiring of the Woord / and so-much the heartelyer exhort one-an-other to bide stedfast in the Doctrine and Requiring of the Woord / euen to the Ende.
