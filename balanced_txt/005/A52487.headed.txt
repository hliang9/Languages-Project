THE Seaman's Companion, BEING A Plain Guide to the Understanding OF ARITHMETICK, GEOMETRY, TRIGONOMETRY, NAVIGATION, and ASTRONOMY. Applied Chiefly to NAVIGATION: AND Furnished with a Table of Meridional Parts, to every third Minute: With excellent and easie ways of keeping a Reckoning at Sea, never in Print before. ALSO, A Catalogue of the Longitude and Latitude of the principal Places in the World: With other useful things. The Third Edition corrected and amended. By MATTHEW NORWOOD, Mariner. LONDON, ed by Anne Godbid, and John Playford, for William Fisher, at the Postern-Gate near Tower-Hill; Robert Boulter, at the Turks-Head, and Ralph Smith, at the Bible in Cornhill; Thomas Passinger, at the Three Bibles on London-Bridge; and Richard Northcot, next St. Peter's-Alley in Cornhill, and at the Anchor and Mariner, on Fishstreet-Hill.
TO THE READER. THE famous and ever to be admired Art of Navigation, having been so learnedly handled and written of, not only in all other Languages, but also in our Mother-Tongue, by so many learned and able men, both of former and of our present Age, that it may seem impossible to write any thing more thereof that hath not already been done by others; yet in my experience which I have seen, being at Sea in several Vessels, where divers young Mariners have been: I have heard this general Complaint among them, that though the things that are chiefly useful for them in their Art may be found in several Books here
and there dispersed; yet they could wish that there were such a Book contrived, that might be soley useful for them entire by it self, which then would be more convenient for them, and might be purchased at a more reasonable rate than otherwise they could be, by buying of so many sorts of Books, which they must be constrained to do, if ever they intend to be able Proficients in that most noble Profession of Navigation, at which they chiefly aimed. This Complaint of theirs, was one chief Motive which induced me to collect and com∣pose the subsequent Treatise, which I have en∣deavoured to handle in such a methodical man∣ner, as it ought to be read and practised by the young Seaman. For First, There is a Treatise of ARITHMETICK, containing all the Rules thereof, which are ne∣cessary for the Seaman to know and practise, all or most of the Questions thereof being made applicable in one kind or other to Nautical Affairs. Secondly, There is a Treatise of GEOMETRY, containing the first Grounds and Principles thereof, with the making and dividing of the
Mariners Scale and Compass, with the pro∣jecting of the Sphere in Plano, and the resol∣ving of many Questions in Astronomy, which are useful in Navigation thereby. Thirdly, you have a Treatise of the practick part of NAVIGATION, wherein is shewed, after a new experienced way used by the Author, how to keep a Reckoning at Sea: the making and use of the Plain Sea-Chart: the Doctrine of plain Triangles made applicable to such Questions in Navigation as concern Course, Distance, Rumb, Difference of Longitude, and Departure: likewise, a Table of Meridional parts to every third Minute, and the application and use there∣of exemplified in Questions of Sailing by Mer∣cator's Chart: with Tables of Longitude and Latitude of Places, of right Ascension, and Sea∣sons of certain Fixed Stars, with Rules to keep a Reckoning, and to find the Latitude by the Meridian Altitude of the Sun or Stars. Fourthly, There is a short Treatise of ASTRONOMY, wherein you have the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles applied to Questions in Astronomy and Navigation. This is the brief Sum and Substance of the following Treatise, which I commend to the
Practice of all young Sea-men, desiring their kind acceptance of these my first Labours, which if I shall find to be kindly entertained by them, it will encourage me to lanch farther into the more nice and critical part of this most no∣ble Science. In the mean time I commend this to them, wishing good success in all their honest and laudable undertakings, and in the interim bid them Farewel. MATTHEW NORWOOD.

OF ARITHMETICK. THE TABLE. 7000000000000 Millions of millions. 800000000000 Hundred thousand millions. 90000000000 Ten thousand millions. 6000000000 Thousand millions. 500000000 Hundred millions. 30000000 Ten millions. 2000000 Millions. 800000 Hundred thousands. 40000 Ten thousands. 5000 Thousands. 700 Hundreds. 10 Tens. 1 Ʋnits. The Use of the Table to number. THis Table signifies thus much, That if there be one Figure alone, it is but so many units as there is in its name, as 7 is seven ones or units. If there be two Figures, the first Figure towards the left hand is as many tens as there is units in its name, and the other Figure is units: As if it were 10, that is ten units: if it were 23, the first Figure is two tens, that is twenty units: and the next Figure is 3, that is three units. The next place is hundreds, and con∣sists of three Figures, as 700 is seven hundred: 723 is seven
hundred twenty three. And thus you may count any Number by observing the place of any Figure, and in their places gi∣ving them their names as you count: As suppose I have a Num∣ber, namely 7864319, if you tell from 9 backwards to 7, you will find 7 in the place of millions, then begin and say seven millions: then if you count again, you will find 8 in the place of hundred thousands, 6 in the place of ten thousands, and 4 in the place of thousands, then to give them their proper Number, you will read thus: Seven millions for 7, eight hundred thou∣sand for 8, sixty thousand for 6, four thousand for 4, that is, Seven millions eight hundred sixty four thousand; then for 3 three hundred, for 1 ten, and for 9 nine units, that is then altogether 7 millions 8 hundred 64 thousand 3 hundred and ninteen, which is the quantity of units that is in the given Number 7864319. And thus much for Numeration. Addition. ADdition teacheth how to bring several Sums into one total, and is done as in the Example, thus: Suppose there be se∣veral Persons indebted to me, and they owe as followeth: Example. A oweth 7272 B oweth 2732 C oweth 3399 D oweth 3999 Total is, or debt 17402 I demand what the debt is? Add the numbers together thus, begin at the right hand, and for every ten carry one to the next row, adding them up in their seve¦ral rows, til you come to the last row on the left hand, and as many tens as is in that after it is added up, so many set down by it in the next place on the left hand. Example. In the first row towards the right hand, say 9 and 9 is 18, and 2 is twenty, and 2 is twenty two, which should be expressed thus 22: but because the next place is the place of tens, you set down 2 units, and carry the other two (which is two tens) and add them to the next row of tens, by saying 2 that I carried and 9 is eleven, and 9 is twenty, and so forwards, still doing so till you come to the last row, and as many tens as there is in that, so ma∣ny
set down to the left hand: as here it came but to 17, that is but one ten besides the 7: if they come to even tens (as here one row came to thirty) set down 0, and carry the tens to the next place, except it be in the last ro to the left hand, and then set down 0, and your number of tens to the left hand of it. The Characters used in Arithmetick. For pounds l. For shillings s. For pence d. For farthings q. For degrees deg. For minutes ′ For seconds ″ For hours ho. Minutes of time ′ For hundreds C. For quarters qu. For ounces oun. Addition of Degrees and Minutes. NOte that sixty Minutes is one Degree, three Miles is one League, sixty Seconds is one Mile or Minute, sixty Mi∣nutes of time is one Hour in time: fifteen Minutes of a Degree is one Minute in time, twelve Hours is an artificial Day, twenty four Hours is a natural Day, fifteen Degrees is an Hour in time, four Minutes of time is one Degree, three hundred and sixty Degrees is the Circumference of a Circle, one hundred and eighty Degrees is half a Circle, or a Semicircle; ninety De∣grees is a Quadrant, or a quarter of a Circle, and eleven De∣grees fifteen Minutes is one point of the Compass, two and thir∣ty times eleven Degrees fifteen Minutes is the Circumference of a Circle; so that there is two and thirty points of the Com∣pass in every Circle: one point of the Compass is three quarters of an Hour in time, or 45 Minutes. Admit I had kept an account of a Ships Difference of Longi∣tude in Degrees and Minutes, that had been out eight days, and had made Difference of Longitude each day, as followeth: The first day 2 deg. 20′ The second day 2 deg. 45 The third day 1 deg. 30 The fourth day 1 deg. 11 The fifth day 2 deg. 39′ The sixth day 1 deg. 29 The seventh day 2 deg. 19 The eighth day 2 deg. 10 I desire to know (if it be all one way) what number of degrees and minutes it is in one sum.
Begin as you did in Addition, and say 9 and 9 is 18, and 9 is 27, and 1 is 28, and 5 is 33, set down 3 and carry 3: then say 3 that I carried and 1 is 4, and 1 is 5, and 2 is 7, and 3 is 0, and 1 is a 11, and 3 is 14, and 4 is 18, and 2 is 20: cast out all the sixes from 20, and there remains 2, set it down, and as many sixes as you cast away, so many units carry to the place of Degrees (which was three sixes) and say 3 that I carried and 2 is 5 and so forwards in that as in any other Sum in Addition: it being thus added, I find that it comes to 16 d. 23 m. the whole. 2 deg. 20′ 2 deg. 45 1 deg. 30 1 deg. 11 2 deg. 39 1 deg. 29 2 deg. 19 2 deg. 10 16 deg. 23 Now you may ask a reason why I cast away the sixes, the reason is because 6 tens make a degree: now with the three tens that I carried, and the tens that where in the row added up last, there were 20 tens, that must be 3 degrees and 2 tens over: the 3 degrees I carry to the place of degrees, and the two tens I set down in the place of tens: and thus in any other Sum. Addition of Hours and Minutes. ADmit I have these several numbers of hours and minutes to cast up in one sum, namely, then because 60 minutes is one hour, I do just as I did before: be sure in the place of minutes set never above 60, for if you do, it is more than a degree. ho. min. 41 07 22 11 12 29 18 32 15 15 109 34 The same is to be done in Addition of Money, only remem∣bring in the place of pence to go no farther than 12, because twelve pence make a shilling, as you do here to 60, because 60′ makes a degree, and in shillings no farther than twenty, because twenty shillings make a pound. And thus in any thing else (pro∣vided that you know how many of the one makes one of the other) but for such things they are not so necessary to the thing we purpose to handle, and therefore I refer you to Mr. Hodder's Book, it being of small price, and much matter, and likewise very plain.
Subtraction. SUbtraction is the taking a lesser number from a greater, and to see what remains: As suppose a man was bound from Cales to Dover, which is 21 miles: now if he have sailed 11 miles of the way, I demand what he hath yet to sail? Take 11 from 21, and the remainder is 10, so I conclude he hath 10 miles still to sail before he come to Dover: but in greater numbers they are ordinarily set so that you are forced to borrow, so that they are something harder. Suppose the distance between two places be 1799 miles. Now I have sailed of these miles 1227 I demand what number of miles I have still to sail. Still to sail 0572 Set the greatest number uppermost, and the least under it, and draw a line between them, and a line under them both, and say, 7 from 9 and the remainder is 2, set down 2: then 2 from 9, there remains 7 set it down: then 2 from 7, and the remainder is 5: whatsoever number is underneath so much is still to sail, as here 572 miles. But now I'll give you an Example wherein the figures in the lesser Sum, are some of them bigger than in the greater, from which they must be taken: now in such a case borrow ten, and add to the upper figure. Example. A oweth to B 7822 pound of Tobacco, now he hath paid 4998 l. of it: I demand what is still due. Whole Debt 7822 l Received 4998 Still due 2824 Set down your sums as in the former di∣rections, and say 8 from 2 I cannot, but 8 from 12, and the remainder is 4: set it down, 1 that I borrowed and 9 is 10, from 2 I cannot, but 10, from 12, and the remainder is 2, set down 2 and carry 1, then 9 and 1 that I carried is 10, from 8 I cannot, but 10 from 18, and the remainder is 8 set down 8 and carry 1: then 1 that I carried and 4 is 5: 5 from 7 and the remainder is 2, set it down, and thus you may do any sum of one denomination.
Subtraction of Degrees and Minutes. THis being of several Denominations, observe as before in Addition (of degrees and minutes) how many of the one makes one of the other: and if the under figures be bigger than the uppermost (in the place of minutes) borrow from 60 the de∣nominator of a degree, and subtract from it, and that remainder add to the upper figure, and set it down: but in the place of de∣grees, if the under number be bigger, do as you did before. I have made in my Reckoning — Difference of Latitude North 32 deg. 48′ Difference of Latitude South 29 deg. 59   02 deg. 49 I demand what way I have differ'd my Lat. most, and how much? I have differed my Latitude and it is Northerly, because my Northing is more than my Southing. Say 9 from 8 I cannot, but 9 from 18 there remains 9, set it down; 5 and 1 that I borrowed is 6, 6 from 4 I cannot, but 6 from 6, and the remainder is 0, that 0 and 4 is 4: set it down, then 1 that I borrowed and 9 is 10, from 2 I cannot, but 10 from 12, and there remains 2, set it down: 1 that I carried and 2 is 3, 3 from 3 and there remains 0, so that 32 deg. 48 min. is 02 deg. 49 more than 29 deg. 59 The same may be done in Subtraction of pounds, shillings, and pence, observing but how many of the one goes to make one of the other: be sure in setting down a sum, you do not set more minutes in the place of minutes than 60, or pence in the place of pence than 12, or so for any thing else set no more than go∣eth to make one in the next denomination. Subtraction of Time. LEt the greatest number of time be 272 hor. 22 min. Let the lesser number of time be 199 hor. 49 min. The Remainder of time is 072 hor. 33 min. You may try this over: it is done as the former, and needs no demonstration (as I said hefore) if you observe in any case how many of one makes one of the other, it is but borrowing from that number, as we have done here. The TABLE.
2 times 2 is 4 2 times 3 is 6 2 times 4 is 8 2 times 5 is 10 2 times 6 is 12 2 times 7 is 14 2 times 8 is 16 2 times 9 is 18 3 times 3 is 9 3 times 4 is 12 3 times 5 is 15 3 times 6 is 18 3 times 7 is 21 3 times 8 is 24 3 times 9 is 27 4 times 4 is 16 4 times 5 is 20 4 times 6 is 24 4 times 7 is 28 4 times 8 is 32 4 times 9 is 36 5 times 5 is 25 5 times 6 is 30 5 times 7 is 35 5 times 8 is 40 5 times 9 is 45 6 times 6 is 36 6 times 7 is 42 6 times 8 is 48 6 times 9 is 54 7 times 7 is 49 7 times 8 is 56 7 times 9 is 63 8 times 8 is 64 8 times 9 is 72 9 times 9 is 81 This Table is so familiar to any one, that I need to say but little concerning it; when you read it, read thus; 2 times 2 is 4, 2 times 3 is 6, and so along to 2 times 9 which is 18, then go to the next, and say 3 times 3 is 9, then 3 times 4 is 12, and so forwards. Now I wish the Learner to have these Tables perfect by heart, before he proceed further. Multiplication. IT doth Addition many times, for when you have many Addi∣tions it makes one work of it, and also of two given Numbers it increaseth the greater as often as there is units in the lesser, or the lesser as often as there is units in the greater. Now in multiplying there are three things considerable. First, The Multiplicand, or Number that you would multiply. Secondly, The Multiplier, or Number you multiply by. Thirdly, The Product or Sum produced. Quest. 1. I demand how many Feet there are in 320 Yards, every Yard being three Feet? If you set down 320 yards one under the other three times, and add them, you will have the sum of 320 yards in feet: but that is a tedious way, for then you must set down your 320
yards an hundred times one under the other, if there were one hundred times so much (of any thing) in it: but now Multipli∣cation doth it at once; because there is 3 foot in a yard, there∣fere there must be three times 320 foot in 320 yards. Multiplicand 320 Multiplier 3 Product 960 Example. I set down 320 and 3 under the first figure on the right hand, and say 3 times 0 is 0, set down 0, then 3 times 2 is 6, set down 6: then 3 times 3 is 9, set down 9, so the Product is 960 feet, which answers your demand. Note, that when your Multiplication cometh to more than 9, as many tens as are in it, so many you carry to the next place, (as you did in Addition) and set down the rest, as you shall in this Example following. Quest. 2 I demand how many Minutes is in 360 Degrees? Note that 60 minutes is one degree: it is less work always to make your greatest Number your Multiplicand, and then it stands as in the Margin: then say 0 no∣thing is 0, set down 0; then 0 six is 0, set it down; then 0 three is 0, set it down: then go to 6, and say 6 times 0 is 0, set it down, one figure to the left hand under the former; then say 6 times 6 is 36, set down 6 and carry 3; then say 6 times 3 is 18, and 3 that I carried is 21, set down 1 and car∣ry 2; now because there is no more figures, set down the two (as I have shewed in Addition) and thus 360 degrees is 21600 minutes, if both the Products be added together. Then to prove your work, add up your Multiplicand, and cast away the nines from it, and set the remainder down over the Cross; then cast away the nines of the Multi∣plier if it comes to 9, but if not, set it down under the Cross; then multiplie 6 by 0, and it makes 0, set down that on the right side of the Cross; then cast up your Product, and cast away the nines from it, and if it comes to the same that the Multi∣plicand and Multiplier did, (the nines being cast away) then the sum is done right, and stands as you see in the Margin. I shall here following
shew two Examples, and let down two more for your practice: if you do not understand what is said, examine these Examples which are wrought, and they will satisfie you. Quest. 3. How many units is 612345 times 62453125 units? Quest. 4. How much is 123456 times 45321672? Let these be the two Questions which here following are wrought one after the other. The Product of the first Question 38242858828125 The Product of the second Question 55952640636024 Quest. 5. How many units is in 3438239 times 5289231423? Answ. 18185641758584097. Quest. 6. How many units is in 289764532172 times 343217812? Answ. 199452348727277447664.
Division. DIvision is that by which one may know (at one operation) any part of a whole Number, provided that the part be not under an unit: by part I mean thus, the third of a number, or the fourth of a number, or the twentieth part of a number, or the like. In Division there are four things considerable: First, the Dividend; Secondly, the Divisor; Thirdly, the Quotient; And fourthly, the Remainder after the Division. The Dividend is the number which you desire to have divided, or to have a part known. The Divisor is that which you divide it by, or the name of the part which you would have known. The Quotient is the number of units that is contained in the part required. And the Remainder of the Division is that part under an unit, which is wanting to the true portion which is left in the Quotient. Your Sum when you set it, stands thus: 3478 ( 224 Quest. 1. A man promised to do a Piece of work for me in a Quarter of a Year: Now if there be 365 Days in a Year, I desire to know how many Days is in this Quarter? The fourth part of 365 days must needs be the number of days which this man will be doing the Piece of Work, there∣fore divide 365 days by 4, and the Quotient shall be the whole days, and the remainder of the Division shall be the parts of a day above the whole days. 91 days, and  one fourth of a day is a quarter of a year, or the quantity of time he will be doing this Work. We express a Fraction thus: one fourth ¼, two fifths ⅖, or so for any Fraction. But you will ask how this is done? 365 ( 4 Which is thus: First, set down your Divi∣dend 365; then to the left hand set down
the Divisor under your Dividend. but you will ask why I did not set it under the 3? And the reason is, because 4 is more than 3, so that I could have had nothing from 3 till I had remo∣ved it where it is: if 3 had been a number that I could have took my Divisor from, I would have set the 4 under the 3. Your Sum being set, say how many times 4 can you have in 36? Nine times. Set down 9 in the Quotient, and multiply 4 by 9, saying 9 times 4 is 36, from 36 and the remainder is 0: cancel 4 and 36 as you go (by a dash with your pen) and your work stands thus: Then set your 4 under the 5, and say how many times 4 can you have from 5? Once. Set down 1 in the Quotient, and multiply it by 4, saying, once 4 is 4, from 5, and the remainder is 1: set 1 over the 5, cancelling your 4 and 5 by a dash with your pen (as you speak:) now because there is no more figures, your sum is done, and stands thus:  The 1 which remains is ¼ of a unit (because the Di∣vidend is units) for whatsoever the Dividend is, the Quotient and the Remainder shall be a part of it: it hath its Denomination or Name from the Divisor 4. Quest. 2. A man had an Estate of 78998 l. now he oweth to 23 several men 27821 l. apiece. I demand what each man shall have of the Estate, so that none of them may be wronged? You will conclude because they were owed alike, they should have alike of that which was left, therefore divide the Estate by 23, and the Quotient with the Remainder will be each mans due. Each will have 3434 l. 16/23 of a pound for his Debt. This is Division of two figures when the Divisor is two figures, and it is something harder than the other Example: The work∣ing
of it is thus, first set your Sum in order thus: 78998 ( 23 Then I say, how many times 2 can you have from 7? Three times: 3 times 2 is 6, from 7 and there remains 1 (set 3 in the Quotient) and say again 3 times 3 is 9, from 18, and there remains 9, then your Sum stands thus: You might have said 3 times 3 is 9, from 8 I cannot, but 9 from 18, and the Remain∣der is 9, and 1 (for your borrowed one ten) from 1, and there remains 0, which is most easie for memory. Then set your Divisor on place further towards the right hand in this form: How many times 2 can you have from 9? Four times: then 4 times 2 is 8, from 9, and there remains 1, and 4 times 3 is 12, from 19 and the Remainder is 7: and 1 (for the ten) from 1, and the Remainder is 0; and then your Sum stands thus: Then remove your Divisor to the next place, and see how many times 2 you can have out of 7, which is 3 times: 3 times 2 is 6, from 7 and the remainder is 1: and 3 times 3 is 9, from 9 and the remainder is 0; and your Sum stands thus: Then remove your Divisor to the next place, and see how many times 2 you can have from 10? which is 5 times: now 5 times 2 is 10, from 10 and there remains 0, and 5 times 3 is 15, from 8 I cannot (you see 8 is all that is left, so that you have no∣thing to horrow from) therefore you could not take 5 times 23 from 108, try for 4 times, 4 times 2 is 8, from 10, and the remainder is 2, and 4 times 3 is 12, from 28 I can, you see you may take 4: set 4 in the Quotient, and say 4 times 2 is 8, from 0 I cannot, but 8 from 10, and the remainder is 2, and 1 that I borrowed from 1, and the remainder is 0, (cancel as you speak) then 4 times 3 is 12: now 12 from 28, and the remain∣der
is 16; but it is better to use your self to this method, namely, to take your units from the place of units, and your tens from the place of tens, as here 2 is in the place of units, and 8 above, therefore say 2 from 8, and there remains 6, and 1 (for the ten) from 2 and the remainder is 1: Now if this had fallen out so that the upper number had been 21, and the other 12, you know that 12 will be taken out of 21, but 2 would not be taken out of 1; now in such a case borrow one 10, and say as in Subtraction, 2 from 1 I cannot, but 2 from 11 and the remainder is 9, one 10 that I borrowed and 1 is 2, from 2 and there remains 0, and thus it is done at once: The reason why it is done this way is, because the Sum you are to take from may be big, so that a man cannot tell readily what the remainder will be without Subtraction; for this differs nothing from Subtraction, as it is shewed before, but only that you carry one number in your head, whereas there both the numbers are before you. The hardest Sum in Division hath but these Difficulties in them: First, Be sure take no more to set in the Quotient, than your Divisor multiplied by it) will come under the Number you are to take it from, or equal to it. Secondly, Be sure you take the one as many times as you can from the other. Thirdly, Be careful in takeing one number from another, to use this way of Subtraction. This Sum is done, and stands thus:  And it signifies that the 23. part of 78998 is 3434 units and 16/23 of a unit.
Here following is a Sum of four figures done, and the way to prove any Sum. 34771262 ( 2345 This Sum is set down in its several Operations. From what hath been said already, I suppose you may be able to examine it; the like is to be understood of any Sum else in Division, there∣fore I shall say no more, only shew how to prove them when they are thus wrought.
The best way to prove Division is by Multiplication, for if you multiply your Quotient by the Divifor, and add in the Remainder, that product will be equal to the Dividend, if the Sum be right, and it stands to reason it should be so, for if the Quotient with the remainder be in this Sum the 2345th. part of the Dividend, then 'tis evident that 2345 times that Quo∣tient must be the same that the Dividend is (with the remainder which is added in.) Example. Quotient 14827 Divisor 2345   74135   59308 Remainder 7   44481 4   26654 9     1 Divid. 34771262 Here you see the Example of it, and the Product the same that the Dividend of the Sum divided was, and this I say is the best way for young Practitioners to prove Division, be∣cause this makes them perfect in Mul∣tiplication. There is a shorter way to prove any Sum in Division, and that is this: Cast up your Quotient, and cast away all the nines from it, (as you do in Multiplication) and what remains set down upon one side of a Cross thus: Then cast away your nines from your Divisor in like manner, and there remains 5, set it down on the other side against 4 thus: Multiply them one by the other, and they pro∣duce 20, cast away all the nines from 20, and the remainder is 2, keep this 2 in mind, and cast up the remainder of the Division, and cast all the nines from it: which if it be done in this Sum, afterwards there will remain 3, which add to the 2 that was in your mind, and it makes 5, which set down thus: Then cast away all the nines from your Divi∣dend, and the remainder will answer to the last number you set down in the Cross, if the Sum be right, which here it is
Reduction. REduction sheweth how to bring gross or great Denomina∣tions into small, or small into great. Quest. 1. Suppose a Man had been at Sea twenty five Years, and for every Minute of that time he was to have on Farthing, I demand how many farthings is due to him? Here I see how many minutes is in that quantity of time, and so many minutes so many farthings there is due, which is, 13140000 farthings. Now to find this, I first multiply the years by the days con∣tained in one year, which is 365, and that produceth 9125 days, the number of days in that number of years: this mul∣tiplied by 24 gives for its Product 219000 the number of hours in the whole time, because 24 hours is a day. That Product multiplied by 60, is the number of minutes in the whole time (because every hour is 60 minutes) which is the last Product, or the thing required, which I set down as the Answer to my Question thus, Facit 13140000 farthings. Quest. 2. Pray tell me what these farthings come to in Pounds, Shillings, and Pence, 1740120 Farthings.
Four farthings make a penny, therefore I divide the whole Sum of Farthings by 4, and the Quotient is ½ of the number of farthings, or the farthings reduced into pence, 435030 d. of which Sum I take the 1/12 by dividing it by 12, which is the next Quotient (the number of shillings that is the farthings) which is 36252 s. 6 d. Twenty shillings make a pound, therefore I take the twentieth part of this last Product, by dividing it by 20, and that Quotient shall be pounds, and the remainder of the Division shillings: 1812 l. 12 s. The Answer of your desire I will set down thus: 1812 l. — 12 s. —6 d. Quest. 3. Some say that in a Mile there is 1760 Paces, three Feet being one Pace, twelve Inches one Foot, three Barley-corns being one Inch: I pray tell me how many Barley-corns will reach three Mi. Because there is 3 miles, 3 times 1760 is the number of paces contained in 3 miles: then because 3 foot is 1 pace, multiply 5280 by 3, and it produceth the number of feet that is in 3 miles; then because 12 inches is a foot, multiply your feet by 12, and it pro∣duceth 190080, the number of inches contained in 3 miles: and because 3 Barley-Corns make an inch, multiply your inches by 3, and it gives you the number of barly-corns that are in 3 miles, and the same is to be understood for any other number of miles. Suppose I would know how many Miles is in the same number of Barley-corns, namely, 570240 Barley-corns. As before you multiplied to bring Miles into Barley-corns, so now divide to bring things of small Denomination into great, only begin at the lowest, where before you ended, for the de∣mand of this is the beginning of the other.
Example. Here the Quotient of the first Division is Inches, because three Barly-corns make an Inch, namely, 190080 Inches. The Quotient of the second Division is the number of Feet contained in those Inches, (and therefore the Inches were di∣vided by 12) namely, 15840 Feet. The Quotient of the third Division is Paces, and therefore it was divided by 3, the number is 5280 Paces. The Quotient of the last Division is the number of Miles con∣tained in either 570240 Barly-corns, or 190080 Inches, or 15840 Feet, or 5280 Paces, which is 3 Miles, the thing required: And after the same manner you may reduce minutes into degrees, or seconds into minutes and degrees, or degrees into hours, pounds into shillings, shillings into pence, and pence into far∣things, or the contrary, by knowing how many of the one makes one of the other. The Proof of Reduction. The Proof of Reduction is the same thing which we did last, I framed it so for brevities sake. When you would prove any Sum that is brought into a small Denomination (by Multiplica∣tion,) divide it backwards, beginning with the Product of your last Multiplication, and compare them in each as you do it, and if the Sum be right they will agree. When you would prove any Sum that is brought into a great∣er Denomination (by Division) then as before you divided, so now multiply; for I have shewed that Multiplication and Divi∣sion is the Proof one of the other. Quest. 4. I will reduce 28 degrees 20′ 40″ into seconds. First Multiply your degrees by 60, and it brings them into minutes, add your odd 20 minutes to that Product, and it makes
the number of minutes in that given number of degrees and minutes: multiply that by 60, and it produceth the number of seconds contained in that given number of degrees and minutes: to that Product add your odd 40 seconds, and it gives the number of seconds contained in the degrees, mi∣nutes, and seconds, as here in this Example: and the reason is, because 60 minutes is a degree, and 60 seconds is a minute: The same is to be understood of the reducing of any number of several Denominations into one. 82 Degrees, 60 4920 Minutes, 20 added. 4940′ in all. 60 296400 Seconds. 40 added. 296440 in all. Facit 296440 seconds in 28 degrees, 20 mi∣nutes, 40 seconds. Thus much for what Mariners have need to know in Reduction. Note, That the Remainder of any Division either in Redu∣ction, the rule of Three, or in any Division, is some part of a Unit, namely thus: If the Quotient be shillings, the remainder is some part of a shilling: If the Quotient be pounds, the remain∣der is some part of a pound. The remainder is the Numerator, and the Divisor is the Denominator of the Fraction; so that if the Quotient were pounds, and the remainder 12, the Di∣visor is 20, and the Fraction is the 12/20 of a pound, which is 12 shillings; the like for any thing else. The Golden Rule, or Rule of Three. THis Rule well understood, is the Sum of the rest that fol∣low it; for they are all (but as it were this Rule) it is cal∣led The Golden Rule, because it is the Foundation of the rest: It is called The Rule of Three, because three numbers are given to find a fourth. Now there is the Rule of Three direct, and the Back Rule of Three: the Rule of Three direct, is for such questions as are so stated, that the third number and second multiplied together, and that Product divided by the first gives the fourth. The Back Rule of Three is so stated, that the first number
and the second are multiplied together, and that Product divi∣ded by the third, finds the fourth. And this is all the distinction that I can make between the forward and backward Rule of Three, which is all the Rule of Three: I will not make therefore two distinct Rules of them, (but one) therefore pray observe this difference: In all Questions in the Rule of Three there is three things given to find a fourth, which number will have alike proportion to the third, as the second hath to the first. In stating your Question, be sure let it be so that you may set your sum in order with the first and third number, speaking both of one thing: I mean if the first be Ells let the third be Ells; if the first be Degrees, let the third be degrees, or some∣thing that Degrees can be reduced to. If your Sum be set with the numbers in several Denominations, before you bring your Sum in order, you must reduce your num∣bers into the least Denomination: As suppose your Sum was this, If 5 pound 10 ounces of Tobacco, cost 10 shillings 9 pence, what shall 510 pounds cost? Reduce your 5 pounds 10 ounces into ounces, and your 510 pounds into ounces: likewise your shillings into pence, taking in the odd pence and odd ounces, as I have shewed how to do it in page 16 and 17. Your Sum being reduced (as I have shewed) into the least Denominations, set it in order thus: If 90 Ounces cost 129 pence, what costs 81600 ounces? Your Sum being in order, consider whether your third num∣ber require more or less: if it require more, multiply the second number by the greatest of the two extreams, and divide that Product by the lesser, it produceth the fourth number in the same Denomination that the middle number was. If your third number require less, multiply the middle num∣ber by the least of the two extremes, and divide that product by the greatest, and it gives your fourth number in the same denomi∣nation that your second number was; then if you desire to reduce it into greater Denomination, do it as I have shewed already. For your better understanding of this Rule of Three, I have here following done an Example of it in right Lines, and have found it upon this Question.
Quest. 1. If 10 pounds of Chocolato cost 15 shillings the first penny, what shall 28 pounds cost? Arithmetically. If 10 l. cost 16 s. what will 28 l. cost? Facit 42 s. or 2 l. 2 s. Here is no need of bringing things into lower Denominations, because the numbers are in one Denomination already. Geometrically. Draw two lines that may touch one the other at pleasure, as the lines A S and A E touch one an other in A, then upon the line A E, set 10 l. fixing one foot of your Compasses in A, (I take the 10 from a scale of equal parts) from the same scale I take 15 s. and fix one foot depiction of geometrical figure of my Compasses in A, and set it off upon the line A S, and draw a line from 15 to 10, then burelakorkupon the line A E, I set 28 (from A) and from 28 I draw a line paral∣lel to the line 10 15, then it is evident that if A 10 gives A 15, A 28 will give A 42, because 42 28 is drawn parallel to 15 10, and the same holds in proportion: I marked it 42, because it is 42 from A. A line parallel to another, is when two lines go so evenly one by anoiher, that they be in all places equally distant.
Quest. 2. If 27 men rigg a Ship in 8 days, how many days shall 20 men be doing it? Here you see the last number required is more than the middle most, for 20 men must be longer about the work than 27 men, therefore I multiplied the middle number by the first, because it is bigger than the third. If in 10 days 16/20 of a day 20 men rigg a Ship, how many shall do it in 8 days? Here the number of days must both be brought into 20 of days (that is such parts as 20 makes 1) which is done by multi∣plying the days by 20, now the reason is because the first num∣ber is of several Denominations, and must be brought into the lowest; which is the Denomination here mentioned. This is the other Sum set backwards as it were, and you see it produceth the same number that was given to do it in 8 days before, which assures you that your other work is right, and this is the way the Rule of Three is proved.
Quest. 3. If in four hours the Sun goeth 60 degrees, how far shall he go in 24 hours? If 4 hours give 60 degrees, what shall 24 hours give? Facit 360 degrees. I need not prove this Sum, or any other, but leave it to your own practice to set it backwards and do it. If 22 deg. 30 min. of the Horizon be two points of the Ma∣riners Compass, how many points is 360 deg. 360 deg. is the Circumference of the Horizon or of any Cir∣cle, and the Mariners have 32 points, that they have names to in the Compass, and no more; then from hence it is evident that 11 deg. 15 min. is one point, 22 deg. 30 min. is two. 33 d. 45 m. three, and so forth. I might be large in handling Arithmetick, but it is a thing that hath been very well handled by Mr. Record, and lately by Mr. Hodder, whose Works are cheap and very admirable: I should have said nothing of this Subject, if I had not found the want that Sea-men have of it, by daily experience in them which I have taught: and seeing I have persisted thus far; I will but shew how every Rule that followeth is worked from this Rule of Three. The Backward Rule you see is it. The Rule of Practice is the Rule of Three abbreviated. The Rule of Proportion, sometimes called the Rule of five Numbers, or by some the double Rule from its double working, is nothing but the Rule of Three
The Rule of Interest is the Rule of Three, as also Interest upon Interest. The Rule of Fellowship is the Rule of Three, I'll do Examples of no more, but all Rules depend upon it: I'll begin with the Rule of five numbers. Quest. 4. If 100 l. in 12 Months gains 6 l. what shall 900 l. gain in 24 Months? If 12 Months gain 6 l. what shall 24 Months gain? I work the proportion before-mentioned, and I find that 100 l. will gain 12 l. in 24 Months. Then I say if 100 l. gains 12 l. what shall 900 l. gain in the same time? If you work it you will find it will gain 108 l. and this is the Rule of Three, for first you see what 100 l. will gain in the time that is set to 900 l. (provided it get 6 l. in 12 Months) and then you see what 900 l. will gain in the same time, (provided that 100 l. gains such a proportion as you find it to do.) The Rule of Interest, and Interest upon Interest. THis is the Rule of Three, for it runs thus: Quest. 1. I let 478 l. for two years, what shall the Ʋse of it come to, after the rate of 6 l. a year, for the lent of 100 l. which is the common Ʋse of it in a year. I'll set my Question in order thus: If 100 l. gives 6 l. what shall the principal 478 give? Facit 28 l. Here we have found what the Principle hath gained for a twelve-month, next consider what proportion 12 Months is to the time your money was lent, which was 24 Months: now if
it had been three times as long a time as 12 Months, you must have made it 3 times as much as you find it for 12 Months, but being but twice as much, you must make the Use to to be twice 28 68/100 which is 57 l. 36/100 of a pound; the same is to be understood of any number else; but in stead of seeing what proportion the time limited for the lent bears with 12 Months, you may work it as you do the Rule of five Numbers, by saying (after you have abbreviated your Fraction.) If 12 Months give 28 l. 68/100, what shall 24 Months gain? But I say the other way is best, after your other manner; If it had been one fourth of the time, it would have been ¼ of the use; if one fifth of the time, ⅕ of the use. For it stands to reason, that if 100 l. or any other quantity gains 6 l. in twelve Months. it gains four times as much in four times the time, or five times as much in five times twelve Months, and so forth. I might say something of Interest upon Interest, but that differs but little from this: At the years end, add in your simple Interest to your Principal, and make it one entire Sum till the next year, then add that Interest to the Principal the year before, and receive the Interest of it: this is all it differs from the former. The Rule of Fellowship. THis Rule is the Rule of Three, done several times in one Sum or Question: for here are several Stocks, and several men that own them; now if the principal, or all their Stocks gain so much, how much shall each man gain according to the Stock he put in? I'll say, if the whole Stock gained so much, what shall the first mans Stock gain? and so for the rest. Quest. 1. Six men make a Stock, the first puts in 30 l. the second 40. l. the third 52 l. the fourth 58 l. the fifth
60 l. and the sixth 78 l. If the whole Stock together gains 200 l. what shall each man have, so that there may be no wrong? First, find the whole Stock by adding every mans Stock together, which is 318 l. Then say, If the whole Stock 318 l. gains 200 l. what shall the first mans Stock gain?   l. First 30 Second 40 Third 52 Fourth 58 Fifth 60 Sixth 78   318 For the Second. If the whole Stock 318 l. gains 200 l. what shall 40 l. gain, which is the second Stock? The like is to be understood of the rest: I forbear to work them, as being out of my intentions: I leave their operation to your genius who never learned them. Quest. 2. There where five men made a Stock, the first put in 200 l. the second 59 l. the third 180 l. the fourth 78 l. the fifth 240 l. they lost at the return of the Ship 120 l. I demand each mans Loss proportionable to his Venture? First find the whole Stock, by adding every mans Ven∣ture together: this done, say for the first mans Loss, if the whole Stock lost 120 l. what shall the first mans Stock 200 l. lose? For the second, If the whole Stock lose 120 l. what shall the second man lose which put in 59 l? And so for the rest: The way to prove one of these Questions is less trouble than the Rule of Three, for after you have done, add all your Facits together, and it will make the same that was lost in the whole Stock, or gain∣ed in the whole Stock, (if the Question be for Gain) and this stands, to good reason; for every mans Loss or Gain must together be equal to the whole, or else they do not
contribute to the Loss, or enjoy the Gain that they have lost or gained. There is more intricacy in this Rule than I have here cited, but the Foundation-work lies on the Rule of Three, and the intricacy that I speak of, will be understood with some con∣sideration: I had thoughts to have shewed it, but it is shewed as well as can be (I think) by Mr. Record and Mr. Hodder: be∣sides it would take up much paper, and I should digress from my intentions to Navigation. What I have shewed since I treated of the Rule of Three, is only a shew how all Rules depend upon this Golden Rule. Blame me not for being so large in Arithmetick; but both that, and all faults else, season with the Salt of a charitable Construction, remembring that Navigation is imperfect with∣out it, I end.
GEOMETRY. THat which I shall handle in Geometry, will be only that part of it which is used in Navigation: He that will treat of it at large, had best to put it in a Treatise by it self, and he that will learn to be a good Geo∣metrician, let him apply himself to Euclid's Works. There is no Art but hath a dependency on it, and Navigation depends much on it, which enforceth me to treat upon some principles of it. Geometrical Definitions. A Point or Prick is this. (.) and is void of length, breadth or thickness. A Line is length without bredth or thickness, and is properly called the nearest distance (if a streight line) between two pla∣ces: but if not streight but circular, it is termed an Arch. An Angle is when two lines are so drawn that they will meet, not in one streight line, but one to cross the depiction of geometrical figure other: now the place where they cross or intersect, is called the Angular Point, as in this figure A is the Angular Point. All Angles that are bounded by streight lines, are called right lined Angles, as the Angle A. A Triangle is when three lines meet, ma∣king three angular points; now there be two sorts, right lined, and spherical: spherical being all the sides Arches of great Circles. There be three sorts of Angles, namely, obtuse, acute, and right angles. A right angled Triangle, is when a line is drawn from another line, so exactly upright, that it leans neither one way nor other,
as you see the line A B and depiction of geometrical figure B C doth: also the Arch which is bounded between them two sides, will be a quarter of a Circle, as n A is: the line C A being drawn makes it a right an∣gled right lined Triangle, whereas before it was but a right Angle. An acute angled Triangle, is when the sides lean so one to the other, as that none of the three depiction of geometrical figure Angles will contain an Arch of 90 degrees, which is a quarter of a Circle, but will be all less, as you see in the acute angled Triangle V S A. An obtuse angled Triangle is when the lines are so drawn, that one of the Angles is bounded by above a Quadrant, or the ¼ of a Circle, as is depiction of geometrical figure the Angle at K, see 8 u is above ¼ of a Circle: whatsoever part of a Circle any Angle bounds, that Arch is the measure or con∣tents in degrees or points of that Angle, as the Arch u 8 is the measure of the Angle at K, the Center of the Arch is K. When in writing we would express an Angle in letters, we set the middle letter for the Angle that is meant, as here O R K is the obtuse Angle at K. The Complement of an Angle or Arch, is what it wants of 90 degrees or a Quadrant: or sometimes (if need require) what it wants of a Semicircle, which is twice 90 or 180 degrees. A Circle is a plain figure, swept out by a pair of Compasses
from the Center, which is the place where one foot of the Compasses stands fixed, whilest the other describes it; some call it a limb or perimeter: that depiction of geometrical figure point of the Compasses which stands fixed, is at O the Center, the other foot describes it at the extent you set them, as here the Circle ABCD: a part of a Circle is termed a Segment. If divers Circles be descri∣bed having all one Center, they be called Concentricks, but if they have divers Cen∣ters, they be called Excen∣tricks. The Circumference of any Circle consists of 360 degrees, every degree being 60 minutes. The Diameter of a Circle is a line drawn from one side of the Circle to the other through the Center, As A C. The Semidiameter of a Circle is half the Diameter, or the di∣stance from the Circumference to the Center. PROP. I. To raise a Perpendicular from the middle of a Line given THe line given is A B, divide it depiction of geometrical figure into two equal parts at F, then open your Compasses to any con∣venient distance (above half the length of the given line) and fix one foot in B, and with the other de∣scribe the Arch C (with the same distance) fix one foot of your Com∣passes in A, and cross the other Arch by the Arch D (mind where they intersect) and from that place (which is ⊙) draw a line to the middle of your given line A B, namely to F, then is F ⊙ a true perpendicular from the mid∣dle of the line A B, for it is so directly from it, that it leans no way.
PROP. II. To divide a Line into two equal Parts by a Perpen∣dicular. THe given line is A B, fix depiction of geometrical figure one foot of your Compas∣ses in A, and setting them at any convenient distance, above half the given line, describe the Arches D and f, carry your Compasses to B (with the same distance) and describe the Ar∣ches C and e, so as they may cross the other Arches as they do in ⊙, mind it, and by those intersections lay your scale, and draw the line ⊙ ⊙, which will cut the given line in the middest, and be a perpendicular to it, which was required. PROP. III. To raise a Perpendicular to the end of a Line given HEre your given line is depiction of geometrical figure A B, fix one foot of your Compasses in that end of your given Line, which you would raise your Per∣pendicular from, which is B, and extend your Compasses to any convenient distance, (as in the example, from B to R) and describe the Arch R c D, (continue the same distance in your Compasses) and fix one foot in R, extend
the other upwards to c, then making c the Center, describe the Arch 1, 2, 3, and beginning at R, set off that distance three times upon that Arch, as 1, 2, 3; from the place where your Compasses fall the third time, (which is 3) draw a line to the place where you began your work, which is B, and it is a Per∣pendicular to your given line. Another way. After you have described the Arch R c D, (with the same di∣stance which described it) extend your Compasses from R to c: from c (with the same distance) describe the Arch u: which is part of the Arch R 1 2 3: then extend the same distance again which falls at D, and cross the Arch before described as N, and from the place of their intersection, draw your line to the end of your given line, and it shall be a Perpendicular: you see it is the same the other was. PROP. IV. To let fall a Perpendicular from a Point to a given Line. LEt the given line be D A, depiction of geometrical figure the point from whence the Perpendicular is to be let fall, be at C. From the point C, draw a white line to the given line (by guess) as C A, divide it into two equal parts, which is done at B, then continuing ½ the line C A, which is A B or C B in your Compasses, and your Com∣passes fixed one foot at B, describe the Arch C D, and where it cuts the given line, there will your Perpendicular fall from the given point, for C D is Perpendicular to the given line D A.
PROP. V. To draw a Line parallel to a Line given. LEt the given line be A S: It is required to draw a line so, that the two lines may run (at both ends) one by the other and never meet, which is parallel one to the other. Open your Compasses to that extent as you would have the two lines asun∣der, and go towards one end of the given line as at S, and depiction of geometrical figure describe the Arch u, and with the same distance come towards the other end as at A, and describe another Arch which is N, and by the top of these two Arches draw the line R O, which is parallel to A S. PROP. VI. To draw a Line parallel to a given Line, from any Point assigned. LEt the given line be S L, the point assigned be A, take the distance from S to A, and carry it towards the other end of the given line as at L, describe the Arch n, then take the distance from L to S, and fixing one foot of your Compasses in depiction of geometrical figure
the given point A, cross the Arch n with the arch o, and by the place of their intersection, and the point assigned draw a line, which shall be parallel to S L. PROP. VII. To make a Square of a Line given. LEt the Line given be A, equal to which draw the side of the Square B E, and from one end of it raise a Perpendicular, and by it set off the length of A, as here from E the Perpendi∣cular was raised, and the length depiction of geometrical figure of A set upon it, which is the side of the Square E D, con∣tinue the same distance in your Compasses, and go to D, and describe the Arch 8: carry the same distance to B, and cross the Arch 8 with f, and from the intersection of those two Arches, draw the sides C D and C B, which makes the Square BEDC, & this is a true square. PROP. VIII. To make a Square, whose Length and Bredth is given. THese sorts of Squares are called Geometrical Squares, when but two sides are equal: namely, the two longest sides, or the two shortest sides: The Angles are all equal, namely right Angles. Suppose the Length of the Square be A, the bredth B, I de∣sire to make it: first draw a line equal to A (for the length of it) as S V, then from any end of that Line raise a Perpendicular (as here from V) and set off the line B for the bredth of it (upon it) which falls in the Perpendicular line at L, then take the length of A, and describe the Arch n, (fixing your Compasses one foot in L) then take B the bredth, and cross that Arch by
another, fixing your depiction of geometrical figure Compasses (one foot) in S, and draw L K, and K S from the place of their intersection, as you did in the other: Thus the two opposite sides in this Square are equal, and the Angles in both all equal, for they are right Angles. PROP. IX. To make a Diamond Figure of a Line, and an Angle given. A Diamond Figure is a Figure of four equal sides, but the Angles are two of them acute, and two of them obtuse, the acute Angles are equal, depiction of geometrical figure and the obtuse Angles are equal one to another. Let A B be the given line, C B the measure of the given Angle, (A being the angular point) first take the line AB, and draw a line of its length, for one side of the figure (namely 8 0) then take the Semidiameter of the Arch C B which is C A, and fixing one foot of your Compasses in 8, describe the Arch S 0, and take depiction of geometrical figure
the Arch B C, and set it off from O to S, then draw the line S 8 equal to 8 O, this done, keep the length of O 8 in your Compasses, and from S and O describe the Arches n and t, and draw the sides O R and S R, as you did in the other figures, and thus S R is equal to 8 O or R O is equal to 8 S, and the opposite Angles also equal. I forbear to shew the reasons of their being equal, because it hath been handled by others, and indeed it is so plain, that with a little consideration you may know it. PROP. X. To make a Rhomboiades of two given sides, and an Angle included. A Rhomboiades is a figure whose opposite sides, and opposite Angles are equal (as a Geometrical Square is) but in this they differ: a Rhomboiades hath never a right Angle, but two obtuse, and two acute, whereas the other hath all right Angles; it differs from the Diamond figure also; for in one the sides are all equal, and in this but two equal sides: I need not shew the working of it, because it differs not from a Diamond figure only in taking the two sides apart, to describe the Arches at L; depiction of geometrical figure I suppose you may conceive how it is made, by seeing this which is here made: the given sides and Angle is s O N, I have not set down the Arch to measure the Angle at O. I suppose from what hath been said, you will conceive how that is.
PROP. XI. To find the Center of a Circle. ADmit the given Circle be depiction of geometrical figure S A u C and I would find the Center of it. Draw a line from side to side of the Circle at a venture, as A C, and divide that line into two equal parts by a Perpen∣dicular (as was shewed before) that Perpendicular line draw through the Circle from side to side, as is u S, and it shall be the Diameter of the Circle, the half of which is the Semi∣diameter or very Center ⊙. It is possible to find the Center of a Triangle after the same manner: Suppose the Triangle, whose Center you would find were A C n, divide any side into two equal parts by a Perpendicular, and it will go through the Center of the Triangle, as the side A C is divided into two equal parts by the Perpendicular B S; then, I say, B S goeth through the Center of this Triangle; but to find whereabouts in this Perpendicular the Center of the Triangle is, I know by no other means, but by removing your Compasses in this line, from place to place till you find it, which is here found to be at u. But this is but a botchingly way, and with a little more labour you may find it at once, therefore mind this Geo∣metrical Example.
PROP. XII. To find the Center of a Circle, of a Triangle, or any three Pricks that be not in a streight Line. THe given Triangle is A B C, divide the longest side A C into two equal parts by the Perpendicular n m, then divide either of the other two sides into two equal parts by a Perpendicular (here the side B C is divided) and where these two Perpendiculars intersect one another, there is the Center of your Triangle, namely ⊙, if it had been a Circle you might have made three pricks depiction of geometrical figure for the three Angles, and ima∣gined the distance between those pricks to be the sides of the Tri∣angle, and proceeded as you did here, and the Center of those three pricks, must have been the Center of the Circle, because they were all in the Circumference, or Sweep it self. Here might be several Questi∣ons deduced from this Demon∣stration, but I'll content my self with one, and leave others that might be framed to your con∣sideration. Quest. I have a Piece of Ground that hath three conveni∣ences in it, which be these; the first is a Garden, now the Gate of this Garden is distant from a Gate that leads into an Orchard 300 Yards, that Gate is distant from the head of a curious River 350 Yards: Now if the head of this River be distant from the Garden-Gate 500 Yards, I demand where I may build me a House that may stand of a like distance from these Places, and how far it shall be from them? I consider that these places cannot be in a streight line, because then the House will not be of an equal distance from those Conveniences, and therefore if lines be drawn from one place from another, it will make a Triangle.
The Operation. depiction of geometrical figure Make a prick with your Compasses for your first station, which is G, then from a Scale of equal parts, take off the distance between the Garden-gate, and the Orchard-gate 300, (counting every equal part 100) and fixing one foot of your Compasses in G, set them upwards to O, which is the distance between the Garden and the Orchard, then take the distance between the Orchard-gate O and the River, which is 350 yards (or three equal parts and an half) and fix one foot of your Compasses at the Orchard-gate O, and with the other describe the Arch n t (which Arch will sweep the head of the River) lastly take the distance between the first place and the third, (which is the distance between the Garden and the River) 500 yards or 5 equal parts, and fix one foot in G the Garden-gate, and cross the Arch n t by the Arch u s, and draw the sides O K 350 yards, and G K 500 yards to the place of their intersection. Now because this House is to be built of an equal distance from every of these places, therefore the Center of these three Conveniences (which are represented by the three pricks
O K and G) must be the place where the House must be built, which is at L, and the reason is, because the distance between the Center and any part of the Circumference is alike: I have shewed already how to find the Center. PROP. XIII. To divide the Circumference of a Circle into 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 equal parts. THe Circle to be divided is A B C D; first draw a line parallel (if you will) to the bottom of your Book as A C, through the Center ⊙, which divides it into two Semicircles, divide that line into two equal parts by a Perpendicular (which Perpendicular will fall through the Center) it is B D, then depiction of geometrical figure is the Circle divided into four equal parts, divide them four equal parts (each) into two equal parts, and the Circle is divi∣ded into eight equal parts; divide them eight parts into two, and the Circle is divided into sixteen equal parts, and them six∣teen (each) into two equal parts, and the Circle is divided into thirty two equal parts, which is the thing desired. This is sufficient in Geometry for our use in Navigation.
The Projection of the Mariners Compass. depiction of mariner's compass Describe your Circles one within another, as you see here (makeing one center for them all when you have so done, divide it into 32 equall parts, as I have before shewed, and draw every
other point to the inner Circle, the rest to the fourth Circle) thus the Compass is made. If you have a desire to divide it into half points, divide the whole ones into two equal parts round about, and draw them to the third Circle; if into quarters, divide your halfs into two equal parts, and draw them to the second Circle: draw none but the North and South, East and West, Northeast and Southwest, Northwest and Southeast points through the center. For drawing the points, it is but observing to make the North point a whole point, and the other seven great points will fall by course (if you observe to make a great point of every other from the North point.) It is common for a Circle without all this to be divided into 360 deg. and then you may see how 11 deg. 15′ is a point of the Compass. But I have proved that in Arithmetick, which saves me a labour here to do it. The Projection of the Plain Scale. depiction of compass and plain scale
Describe a Semicircle upon the line A C (if you are minded to have your Scale large, let your Circle be large, for the Scale will be according to the Circle) and divide it into two equal parts by the Perpendicular B 0: the one of these Quadrants divide into 8 points of the Compass, the other Quadrant, namely B A, divide into degrees, which is done by dividing it into 9 equal parts, and every one of them parts into 10 equal parts, which is 90 degrees for the Points of the Compass, they are shewed sufficiently before. Suppose your Scale were gaged fit for your turn, namely, a place to set the line of Chords, a place to set the line of Sines, and a place to set the Points of the Compasses: (there are Lines of Longitude, and Tangent lines, but we shall meddle with neither of them at this time, be∣cause without them these will be sufficient with a Scale of equal parts.) For the Line of Chords. THe Chord of an Arch is that quantity of a Circle that is between the two ends of a line that is drawn from one part of the Circumference to the other, as the line A 1 is the Chord of 75 degrees (for every pricked Division is a fifth) and so a streight line drawn from A to 10, is the length of the Chord of 10, a line drawn from A, to 20 degrees is the Chord of 20 degrees, and so of the rest. Now your Circle being thus divi∣ded, take of every degree, as I have, and apply it to your Scale. For the Points of the Compass. THey are taken off after the manner of a Chord: first C 1 for one Point, then C 2 for two points, and so of the rest; but you must be sure to take your Line of Chords and Points of the Compass from one and the same Arch (namely, the utter∣most) else they are not proportionable (which they must be) take off every quarter in the manner as you took the degrees of Chords.
For the Lines of Sines. A Sine of an Arch is always half the Chord of twice that Arch, as my Father sheweth in his Description of a Sine, (p. 2. of his Trigonometry, Book 1.) It is the nearest Distance between the place you have a desire to measure, and a line from the other place that goeth through the Center of the same Arch (which is a Perpendicular let fall to it) namely 460 is the mea∣sure of 60 degrees (the Arch A 60). For your better under∣standing, observe this following Example for both a Chord and a Sine. depiction of geometrical figure Admit I would take the Sine of the Arch s I in this Scheme, from either s or I, I'll draw a Line to the Center of the Arch ⊙, which is s ⊙ drawn from s from the other end of the Arch I, I let fall a Perpendicular upon that line which is I u; then is the length of I u the Sine of the Arch I s: but for brevities sake we use to fix our Compasses one foot in I, and extend the other just to sweep the line that goeth through the Center s ⊙, which is the length of the Per∣pendicular I u. If I were to take the Chord of the same Arch, the line s I is it, and these two lines are fit to apply to a Scale of Sines or Chords (to find that Arch) provided that the Semidiameter of the Arch be the same that the Scale was made by: and this is evident then, that if two lines be extended to the Semidiameter of the Arch the Scale is made by (which we call the Radius) then the measure of the Arch that is cut between them two lines, is the Chord of the Angle contained hetween them lines, as s I is the Chord of the Angle I ⊙ s.
Or if one of then be extended to the Radius (as is ⊙ I) and the other so far that the perpendicular is let fall upon it (as ⊙ u) that perpendicular is the Sine of the Arch included between these sides. The Sine of an Arch is half the Chord of twice that Arch, as I u is the Sine of the Arch I s, and is half I B, the Chord of the Arch I s B, which is twice I s. The Projection of the Sphere in Plain Lat. 50 deg. depiction of geometrical figure
There be many that do not attain to the Doctrine of Spheri∣cal Triangles, and are loth (indeed or cannot) spend time to study them: I have thought good to shew the way to measure any thing that is useful for Seamen by the plain Scale (before made:) and though this cannot be so exact as to come to a minute of a degree, yet it is exact enough for our use at Sea: For in taking an Azimuth, or Amplitude, or such like, half a degree of the Compass will not make your Course the worse (after you have allowed for Variation) it being not full the 22t•. part of a point, which is no sensible error in steering: or for finding the length of the day (for ordinary uses) it will breed but little error, 30 minutes being but 2 minutes of time; but for other things that require exactness to a minute or less, of a degree, this way is of no considerabie use; the way by the Tables being exact, and so better. (I shall do both) The reason I handle this here, is in order to Navigation, that you may understand the Circles of the Sphere. This by way of Advertisement. BEfore I shew how to project the Sphere, it will be necessary to understand the Circles of the Sphere. A Sphere is a Scheme or Figure which represents the Heavens, and therefore is round exactly, though upon a Plain it doth not seem so; from whence it is evident, that the lines here drawn in it cannot be streight lines, but Circles: Now there are two sorts of Circles, namely, the Greater Circles, and the Lesser; the Greater Circles are such as go round the very Body of the Globe, and so cut through two opposite points, dividing it into two Hemispheres, and are six in number, which are these: 1. The Axis of the World. (From South to North Pole.) 2. The Horizon. 3. The Aequinoctial. 4. The Ecliptick. 5. The East and West Azimuth. 6. The Meridian. The smaller Circles of the Sphere, are all such Circles as do not divide the Sphere of Heaven into two Hemispheres, and so are less than those that do; and they be four, namely, The two Tropicks, and the two Polar Circles, which to distinguish
the Southermost from the Northermost, we call the Souther∣most Tropick, Capricorn; the Northermost, The Tropick of Cancer; the Southermost Polar Circle, The Antartick; and the Northermost, The Artick Circle. All Circles that cut through the two Poles of the World, are called Meridians; and are also Great Circles, because they di∣vide the Sphere into two Hemispheres, cutting in two opposite points: it is certain, if a Circle goeth through two opposite points, it is as great a Circle as that globous Body can bear, and must divide that Body into two Hemispheres, as doth the Meridian A B C D. The Poles are two opposite places in the Heavens, and are the ends (as it where) of that Line called the Axletree, which the Heavens may be imagined to turn upon: here that Line is called the Axis of the World. The Aequinoctial is a Great Circle of the Sphere, which lieth between the Pole so equally, that its distance from either Pole is 90 degrees (the half of the distance between the Poles) and because it is so equal between them, there begins Latitude; so that whatsoever Latitude you are in, so many degrees and mi∣nutes the Aequinoctial is below that part of the Heavens which is right over your head, and is called the Zenith; or from being right under you, which is called the Nadir. All Meridians cut this Aequinoctial at right Angles. The East and West Azimuth is a Great Circle of the Sphere that cuts through two opposite points of the Heavens, namely, the Zenith and Nadir: it also cuts the Horizon at right Angles in the points of East and West; and therefore is called the East and West Azimuth: all Azimuths are great Circles and cut the Horizon at right Angles. The Horizon is a Great Circle of the Sphere, and divides that part of the Heavens which we do not see, from that part which we do see: or it is the furthest part of the Heavens which we can see for the Body of the Sea; it is only to be seen at Sea, or upon the shore where there is no land between you and it, and so you have divers Horizons according to your motion, for as you raise one part of the World, you lay the other.
The Zodiack is a great Circle, it is the bounds of the twelve Signs: now in the middle of it is the Ecliptick Line, in which Line the Center of the Sun goeth, and passeth every day its mo∣tion of Declination, till it comes to its utmost bounds, which is to the Tropicks: it cuts the Aequinoctial in two opposite points, and makes from these points an Angle of 23 deg. 30 min. which is the Angle S R t, so the Sun is never out of it. The twelve Signs divide this Ecliptick into twelve equal parts, and to every Sign theee is a Name, and a Character for that Name, and a Month to that Sign; which for your better knowledge I have here following inserted. The Names and Characters of the twelve Signs, with the Months they belong to. March Aries ♈ These be the Northern Signs April Taurus ♉ May Gemini ♊ June Cancer ♋ July Leo ♌ August Virgo ♍ September Libra ♎ These be the Southern Signs October Scorpio ♏ November Sagittarius ♐ December Capricornus ♑ January Aquarius ♒ February Pisces ♓ Six of these be Northern Signs, and are in the North part of the Zodiack; and six of them are Southern Signs, because they be in the South part of the Zodiack. The twelve Signs are twelve Constellations, the Months answering to them are agree∣able. Thus much for the great Circles of the Sphere. The smaller Circles are the Polar Circles and the Tropicks. The Polar Circles are distant 23 deg. 30 min. from the Poles, and between them and the Poles is counted the Frozen Zones.
The Tropicks are the bounds of the Suns Declination, and they go parallel to the Aequinoctial (and 23 deg. 30 min. from it) the Tropick of Cancer being 23 deg. 30 min. to the North∣wards, the Tropick of Capricorn being as far to the South∣wards, which is the Suns furthest distance from the Aequator at any time. How to Project a Sphere. THis Sphere or Scheme is projected on this wise: First, take an Arch of 60 deg. from your Scale of Chords, and describe the Meridian M A E R. Now the reason you take just 60 deg. is because that number of degrees taken from the Scale is the Semidiameter of the Circle the Scale was made by: so then whatsoever you take from that Circle, and apply to the Scale, it will be the quantity of it in degrees and minutes; or from the Scale if you take any distance, and apply it to the Circle, it will be the same quantity upon the Circle, that it was upon the Scale. The Meridian being thus described, draw the line A R through the Center, which represents the Horizon: Cross that at right Angles, and draw the line E M, which is the East and West Azimuth. Then because the Sphere is made for the Latitude of 50 deg. take 50 deg. from your Scale of Chords, and fix one foot in the Horizon at A, and set the other foot upwards to B, (make a prick or mark) which is to signifie that the North Pole is ele∣vated or raised above the Horizon so many degrees as the La∣titude is. Keep the same distance in your Compasses, and go to E with one foot, and let fall the other upon the Meridian on the left hand, which will be at G, and will represent that point of the Aeqinoctial that cuts the Meridian of that place which is the nearest point of the Aequinoctial to that Zenith, and is as much below the Zenith, as the Pole is above the Horizon.
Latitude 50 deg. 00 min. Declination. Northerly 13 deg. 15 min. depiction of geometrical figure Keep the same distance, and carry your Compasses to the Ho∣rizon at R, and let fall the other point to K in the Meridian, which is the South Pole; for as much as the North Pole is ele∣vated above the North part of the Horizon (at A) so much is the South Pole depressed below the South part of the Horizon at K.
Continue the same distance between your Compasses, and fix one foot in the Nadir at M, and set the other foot upon the Meridian upwards to O, which is the other point of the Aequi∣noctials intersection in the Meridian opposite to the former; and it stands to good reason, that as much as the Aequinoctial is below the Zenith, so much it ought to be above the Nadir: These marks being set off, draw the Axis of the World B K, and the Aequinoctial G O. And because (as I said before) the outmost bounds of the Suns Declination is 23 deg. 30 min. (either to the Northwards or Southwards of the Aequinoctial, which bounds are expressed by the Tropicks) take 23 deg. 30 min. from your Scale of Chords, and fix your Compasses at O in the Aequinoctial, and set it off on both sides to P and N, carry the same distance to G, and set it off in like manner from G to F and H, then draw F P and H N, which are the Tropicks: also draw the Ecliptick from F to N, which will fall through the Center. Always set the same distance from both Poles on both sides upon the Meridian, and draw D C the Artick, and I L the Antartick Circles. And thus you may project a Sphere by a Plain Scale: The like for any other. Before I proceed to the Questions, it will be necessary to give you the meaning of things that will be spoke to. The Meaning of the Terms used in the following Work. THe Latitude of any place is the Distance between the Zenith of that place, and the Aequinoctial in degrees and minutes. The Elevation of the Pole is always equal to it, and is the Poles height above the Horizon in degrees and minutes. Altitude signifies the Height of a thing: If it be meant of a Star, or of the Sun (not being upon the Meridian) it is meant the Distance between the Sun or Star and the Ho∣rizon.
Meridian Altitude is the Suns height above the Horizon, when he is upon the Meridian of that place, which is at 12 of the Clock; or at any other time when a Star is upon the Meridian either North or South. The Suns true Amplitude of rising or setting signifies the number of degrees and minutes that the Sun riseth from the East, or sets from the West points of the Compass in the Horizon, as it is found in the Sphere. The Suns true Azimuth of rising or setting signifies the di∣stance (in degrees and minutes) of the Suns rising or setting (in the Horizon) from the North or South points in the Compass, as it is found in the Sphere. There is the true Amplitude of the Suns rising and set∣ting, and the Magnetical Amplitude; the Magnetical Am∣plitude is the degree of the Compass that he is observed to rise or set upon, and is Called Magnetical Amplitude from the Load-stone: The Magnetical Azimuth is Called so for the same reason, and is the Suns rising from the South or North. Longitude is the Easting or Westing between two places in degrees and minutes, if in sailing. Departure from the Meridian is the Easting or Westing between two places in miles or leagues. Latitude, as I have said, is the Distance of the Aequi∣noctial from the Zenith of that place in degrees and minutes, or the Elevation of the Pole; but Difference of Latitude is the Northing or Southing that a Ship makes in any Di∣stance run, or between two places, either in degrees, leagues, or miles. Declination (if it be meant by the Sun, or any Star that is near the Aequinoctial) is the nearest distance between the Sun or Star and the Aequinoctial. Stars that are nearer the Poles, their Declination are their nearest Distance to the Poles. The Suns place in the Ecliptick is his nearest Distance from the place where the Suns Parallel of Declination cuts the Ecliptick to the next Aequinoctial point, which is ♈ or ♎.
There be seven Planets which I have here inserted, with their Characters under their Names. Saturn Jupiter Mars Sol Venus Mercury Luna. ♄ ♃ ♂ ☉ ♀ ☿ ☽ I have noted already in pag. 3 of this Book, the quantity of degrees that make an hour in time, of minutes that make an hour, the quantity of degrees and minutes that are in a point of the Compass and the like: if you want to know, look there. I'll now proceed to the Work of the Sphere in Plano, and I will handle no more than is necessary for our use in Navi∣gation. I had thoughts to have made a Table of the hard Terms of Art used (which our vulgar Capacities do not ordinarily com∣prehend) with their meaning, but then I considered what my own Method would be; and so I would not trouble my self with that at the Beginning of my Book: There are no intricate Terms used, but the meaning of them is commonly shewed in the Beginning of the Book.
Latitude and Declination given, to find the things following in the several Questions. Latitude 50 deg. 00 min. Northerly. Declination 13 deg. 15 min. Northerly. depiction of geometrical figure Rule. All distances of the Sphere that you desire to know, must be extended to the Arch of a great Circle, for by great Cir∣cles is the Sphere measured.
QUESTION I. To find the Meridian Altitude of the Sun. IN this or any other Sphere, M G E is that part of the Hea∣vens that is visible, the other half invisible to us; for it is parted from our sight by the Earth and Sea, and the furthest part of it, which seems to mix as it were with the Heavens, we call the Horizon, which is the great Circle M E (for it is a great Circle, though here we are forced to represent it by a streight Line) M is the South point of the Horizon: Now the Suns Meridian Altitude is his distance between that point and the place he cuts the Meridian that day, which is M I; fix your Compasses in M, and extend the other foot to I, and apply it to your Scale of Chords, and as many degrees as you find it there, so many degrees is the Sun high when he is upon the Meridian that day, which is the thing required. Note that at O the Sun riseth, at P it is 6 of the Clock, and P I is equal to ♈ K (when it is extended to a great Circle) and both the Sine of 90 deg. which is extended to a Chord, must be the Chord of as many degrees, which is 6 hours in time. The time between 6 a Clock and 12, which proves that M I is the Meridian Altitude of the Sun: and this measuring any Distance from the Meridian is called The first Way of Measuring. QUESTION II. To find the Suns Amplitude of Rising and Setting. FIx one foot of your Compasses in the place of the Suns Rising, which is O, and extend the other foot to the Center of the Sphere (which is termed the East point of the Horizon) and this Distance apply to your Line of Sines (if you have any) but if you have no line of Sines, extend it to the Chord of the same Arch, thus: Fix your Compasses with that distance, one foot in the Meridian, so that the other may just sweep a line that goeth through the Center of the Sphere,
then, say I, the Arch between that foot of your Compasses that stands in the Circle, and the place where this line you sweep cuts the Circle, is the Chord of the thing required, and will be the same number of degrees upon the line of Chords, as O R would be upon the line of Sines: and after this manner is the Chord of any distance (taken from a line that goeth through the Center of the Sphere) found: and this is called The second Way of Measuring. I find that the Sun riseth 20 deg. 53 min. to the Northwards of the East (for she hath North Declination, and the Latitude is Northerly) or sets so much to the Northwards of the West. depiction of geometrical figure
QUESTION III. To find the Suns Azimuth at six of the Clock. THe Suns Azimuth at 6 of the Clock, is the nearest distance between the Sun at 6 of the Clock, and the East and West Azimuth, which is P z: Now if you mind it, P z is taken off from a Circle, which is not so great as the Horizon, and yet is parallel to it, as the line n w is parallel to the line M E; and as many degrees as the Sun is from the nearest part of the East and West Azimuth in the little Circle, so many he is from it (if an Azimuth where drawn) in the great Circle, for P z is as many degrees in the little Circle, as n ♈ is in the great one: Now because your Scale is made by the great Circle, therefore ex∣tend the distance taken from the lesser Circle to the measure of the greater, which is done thus: Take half the length of the pricked line which is z w, and fixing one foot of your Compasses in the Center of the Sphere, describe an Arch from some line that goeth through the Center of the Sphere, as the Arch M l n, then set the distance z P as a Sine upon that Arch (for it is a Sine upon that Arch as well as o ♈ was a Sine upon the Meridian) I find the Sine of it is the Sine of the Arch l M, lay your Scale from the Center of the Sphere by l, and draw the line l q then shall q M be the same quantity of degrees upon the great Circle, as l M is upon the little one: therefore take M q and apply it to the Scale of Chords, and it answers your desire. And thus is the Suns Azi∣muth at 6 of the Clock, P z found to be 8 deg. 36 min. to the Northwards of the East, and this is called The third way of Mea∣suring, to measure any distance from a line that doth not go through the Center (which must represent a small Circle) And thus you may find the Suns Azimuth at any time of the day.
QUESTION IV. To find the Suns height at six of the Clock. THe Sun is at P at 6 of the Clock: fix one foot of your Com∣passes in P, and extend the other to sweep the Horizon, which is the same as though you let fall the Perpendicular P n, set it off by The second way of Measuring, as was shewed in Quest. 2. and apply it to your line of Chords; and the reason is, be∣cause P n represents a part of a great Circle, and so is to be un∣derstood to be of the nature of those lines that go through the Center of the Sphere, for all Azimuths pass through the Zenith and Nadir, which are two opposite points. I find the Sun is 10 deg. 7 min high at 6 of the Clock. depiction of geometrical figure
QUESTION V. To find the Suns height being due East or West. VVHere the Suns parallel of Declination cuts the East and West Azimuth, is the place the Sun is in, when he is due East in the morning, for you see he is then over the point of East in the Horizon, which is ♈ (or the Center) there∣fore take the distance between that place and the Center (which is S ♈) and apply it to the line of Sines; but if you have no line of Sines, extend it to a Chord after the manner of the second Question, which I call the The second way of Measuring, for it is the distance of a line which goeth through the Center. I find the Suns height being due East or West, is 17 deg. 25 m. Note, that the same height that the Sun is being over the East point, so high he is being over the West point in the afternoon. QUESTION VI. To find the Difference of Ascension. THe Difference of Ascension, is the portion of time that is between the Suns Rising and six of the Clock: If the days be longer than the nights, the Sun riseth before 6; but if shorter, after 6; but whether it be before or after 6 that he riseth, so many hours and minutes as it is from 6, so much is the half day or night longer or shorter than 6 hours, from whence it is evi∣dent, that if the Sun riseth due East, he riseth at 6 of the Clock, and so there is no Difference of Ascension, for he is then in the Aequinoctial, which cuts the Horizon in the two opposite points of East and West. In this Question the Difference of Ascension is O P, and is a distance upon a line that goeth not through the Center, there∣fore take half the length of the parallel I D, and proceed as you did in the third Question, and after you have found it in degrees and minutes, convert it into hours and minutes of time, and set it down. I find it to be here 16 deg. 18 min. which is 1 hour 5′ 3/15.
By the Difference of Ascension thus found, you may find the length of the day or night, the hour of Suns Rising, or the hour of uns Setting. QUESTION VII. For the time of the Suns Rising or Setting in this Example. I Consider as much as the Sun riseth before 6, so much he sets after 6: here he riseth before 6 of the Clock 1 hour 5′, sub∣tract that from 6 hours, and you have the hour of the Suns Ri∣sing 4 h. 55′: add it to 6 hours, and you have the time the Sun sets 7 h. 5′. double that, and it is the length of the whole day, which is here 14 deg. 10 min. Subtract the length of the depiction of geometrical figure
day from 24 hours, and it leaves the length of the night 9 h. 50′. I omitted the Fractions. But if the Sun riseth after 6 of the Clock, and you have a de∣sire to find these things (as he doth when he is South Declina∣tion) add the Difference of Ascension to 6 hours, and it gives the time of the Suns Rising; subtract it from 6, and it gives the time of Suns Setting; and that doubled is the length of the whole day. Again, that subtracted from 24 hours, is the length of the night. QUESTION VIII. To find the hour of the Suns being due East or West. THe Sun is due East (in this Example or any other) when he goeth by the East point of the Horizon; or West, when he goeth by the West point. In this Example, the Suns parallel of Declination cuts the East and West Azimuth in S, which is later in the morning than 6 of the Clock, by the distance S P: therefore see what S P is by The third way of Measuring, and convert it into time, and add it to 6 hours, it shall give the hour of the Suns being due East. I find it in this Example to be 6 h. 46′. Subtract this from 12 hours, and it gives the time of the Suns being due West that day: for as many hours and minutes as the Sun is due East before 12 of the Clock, so many hours and mi∣nutes must it be due West after 12: According to this Exam∣ple the Sun is due West at 5 of the Clock 14 min. If the Sun hath South Declination, he passeth the point of East before he riseth, and is set as long before he comes to the point of West, (provided the Latitude be Northerly, as this is) but if the Latitude and Declination be both one way, the Sun is always up before he cometh to the point of East: and the work is as I have shewed.
QUESTION IX. To find the time of Day breaking, and Twilight ending. IT is an antient Observation and concluded Opinion, That the Sun makes some shew of Day when he is 17 degrees under the Horizon; therefore take 17 deg. from your Scale of Chords and set it from both ends of the Horizon downwards, and draw the line T r, then fix your Compasses in r (the place where the Suns parallel of Declination intersects that line) and extend them to 6 of the Clock; set it off by The third way of Measuring, and convert it into time: Subtract that from 6 of the Clock, and it gives the time of Day breaking. I find in this Example Day breaks at 3 of the Clock 6 min. 8/15. Add it to 6 hours, and it gives the time of Twilight ending 8 of the Clock 3 53 14/13. It may happen so sometimes, that it may be past 6 of the Clock before the Day breaks, in such a case you must add (in the mor∣ning) for break of Day, and subtract for Night from 6 hours, which is the contrary: These things your own Reason will give you, after you are used to it, which makes me forbear to give any more reasons of it. QUESTION X. To find the Continuance of Twilight. THe Continuance of Twilight is the time between the Day breaking and Sun rising, which is r o; take it off by the Third way of Measuring, and convert it into time. I find it to be 1 hour 48 min.
QUESTION XI. To find the Length of the longest Day in that Latitude. VVHen the Sun is nearest the Zenith (in any Latitude) that day must be the longest: now in places near the Aequi∣noctial, as between the Tropicks, there is but little difference all the year long; but in places nearer the Poles, there is more. The Sun is nearest the Zenith in this Latitude, when he is in the Tropick of Cancer, so that then must be the longest Day. Imagine the Tripick of Cancer to be the parallel of the Suns Declination (as indeed it is that day) take the distance between Y and R, which is between Suns Rising and 6 of the Clock that day, and set it off by the Third way of Measuring, the number of degrees and minutes convert into time, and add it to 6 hours, which makes the length of the Forenoon, and that doubled is the length of the whole day (as in Quest. 7.) which is equal to the longest Night in that Latitude. I find it here to be 16 hours 10 minutes. Subtract the length of this longest day from 24 h. 00 min. And it leaves the length of the shortest night 7 h. 50 min. Equal to which is the length of the shortest day 7 h. 50 min. But you may measure the length of the shortest day, and sub∣tract that from 24 hours, and it will be the length of the longest night, which is equal to the longest day. Now the shortest day is when the Sun is in the Tropick of Capricorn, for then it is latest before he riseth: Now to mea∣sure it, take the distance from 6 of the Clock, which is T, and the Suns Rising which is U, and set it off by the Third way of Measuring, convert the degrees into time, and subtract that time from 6 hours, it leaves the length of the Forenoon, which doubled is the length of the shortest day; (as in Quest. 7.) I have spoke to that purpose. I need say no more, that 7th. Question is light sufficient. I might do an Example of what is before done, in a South Latitude, but Reason gives, that the same which the South Pole
or Southern parts of the Heavens are deprest in a Northern La∣titude, the same will the Northern parts of the Heavens be de∣prest in a Latitude as far Southerly, so that there will be no difference in the work at all: And indeed my desire to be brief, makes me omit things that I think may be understood without treating of them. I'll only touch upon an Example in a Sphere which hath South Declination. Latitude Northerly 50 deg. 00 min. Declination 13 deg. 15 min. Southerly. THe Meridian Altitude of the Sun is his greatest height for that day H f, measured as before. The Suns Amplitude of Rising and Setting is V ♈, it is measured as before: But where∣as before it was to the Northwards of the East, now its to the depiction of geometrical figure
Southwards; forasmuch as A is the North part of the Horizon, ♈ the East point of the Horizon (A ♈ being 8 points or 90 deg.) and so H is the South point: Now you see V is between the East ♈, and the South H. Also, if you subtract this Amplitude V ♈ from ♈ H 90 deg. the remainder is the Suns Azimuth from the South V H, or if you add V ♈ to ♈ A (90 deg.) it is V A the Suns Azimuth of rising from the North; forasmuch as V A is as much above 90 deg. as V H wants of it: The same is to be understood in any Sphere, that the Amplitude and Azimuth of the Sun are Complements one of an other, to 90 deg. in that Quarter. When the Suns Declination is Southerly (in any Northern Latitude) the days are not so long as the nights, so that the Sun cannot be up at 6 of the Clock, which is at R; therefore the Suns Azimuth at 6 of the Clock is of no use. Neither is he up, when he passeth the East point of the Horizon, which is at P, so that you cannot take his height; but you may measure how far he is under the Horizon at either of those times, or you may find his true Azimuth at 6, which is of no value to us that are Seamen, because we cannot have a Magnetical Azimuth; they are measured as before. The Difference of Ascension is here after 6 of the Clock, as much as it was before 6, in the last Example: And the rea∣son is, because the Latitude is the same, and the Declination of the Sun is just as far Southerly, as before it was Northerly, so that the Sun will now be just as long before he riseth after 6, as before he rose sooner: it is V R, take it off by the third way of Measuring, as you did before, and set it down; I find it to be 1 hour 5 min. 3/15, it serves for the same uses that it did in the other Example. For the length of the day, subtract the Difference of As∣cension V R, from 6 hours, which is R f, and the remainder is f V, the length of the Forenoon, which doubled is the length of the whole day; that subtracted from 24 hours is the length of the night. For the hour of the Suns being due East, it is P R, which is from the place where the Sun cuts the East and West Azimuth
to 6 of the Clock, and set it off by the third way of Measuring, convert your degrees and minutes into time, and subtract that time from 6 hours, and it gives the due time of the Morning that the Sun cuts the East point of the Compass; the reason why you subtract is, because the Sun is due East so long before 6 of the Clock. Subtract the hour of the Suns being due East from 12 hours, and it will give the true time of the Suns being due West. For the time of day breaking, draw the line 17 ⊙, parallel to the Horizon, and 17 deg. under it, as was shewed before, and mea∣sure from P to R, that is, from the place where the Suns Paral∣lel of Declination cuts that Circle of 17 deg. (under the Hori∣zon) to 6 of the Clock, convert it into time, and subtract it from 6 of the Clock, and it leaves the time of Day breaking, namely, the time in the morning that the Sun is in P; you subtract, because the day breaks so long before 6 of the Clock: If it where so that the Sun were in the Tropick of Capricorn, you must take the Distance S q. You see the Sun is past the hour of 6 before it is break of day; now in this case you must add, whereas before you subtracted. For the continuance of Twilight, it is measured as before, from the place, where the Parallel of the Suns Declination cuts the Circle of 17 deg. to the place where it cuts the Horizon; convert it into time, and set it down. In this Example it is P V. What I have not mentioned here, I have given sufficient in∣structions about in the other Example before this. Latitude 51 deg. 30 min. Northerly, Declination 11 deg. 10 min. Northerly, I demand the Suns place and right Ascension. BEfore we can find the Suns place in the Ecliptick, you are to consider that the Ecliptick is divided into 12 equal parts, by the 12 Signs; six of these Signs divide that half of the Eclip∣tick, which is to the Northwards of the Aequinoctial, and are called Northern Signs; and the other 6 divide the half that is to the Southwaads of the Aequinoctial, and are called Southern Signs, as I have set them down in this Book before, with their Names and Months to their Characters, and have set the
Northern Signs by themselves, and the Southern Signs by them∣selves. It is plain then that these Signs must be of an equal Distance one from the other round about; and because 12 times 30 is 360, the Signs must stand 30 deg. asunder, and that will just do it: Now in this plain Body, half the Ecliptick is represent∣ed by a streight line that goes through the Center of the Sphere. The line of Signs is taken off, so that 90 deg. is but ♈ ♋; there∣fore depiction of geometrical figure by a line of Sines you may take first 30 deg. and six one foot of your Compasses in ♈ (the Center) and with the other describe ♉ ♓, and their opposite Signs ♏ ♍; then take 60 degrees for ♊ ♒, and their opposite: Then take 90 deg. which
reach to the Circumference ♋ ♑, which is (from the Center) thus set off by a line of Sines; but if you have none but a line of Chords, you must take the Chord of 30 from your Scale first, and lessen it to a Sine thus, Fix one foot of your Com∣passes in the Meridian where the other foot (with that Distance) may sweep a line that goeth through the Center, as R t; keep your Foot in R, and extend your Compasses to U, and so you have R U the Chord of the Sine R t, apply it to your line of Chords, and you have your desire. This plain Superficies can shew but one part of the Globous Body, but you must know it is round, which makes the Ecliptick to be divided; on both sides from ♈ to ♋ is 90 deg. from ♋ to ♎ is 90 deg. from ♎ to ♑ is 90 deg. and from ♑ to ♈ is 90 deg. every one of these quarters containing 3 Signs. The Ecliptick being thus divided into Signs; we may find the Suns place, and right Ascension. THe Suns place in the Ecliptick is the nearest Distance between the next Aequinoctial point, and the Sun in the Ecliptick, (by Aequinoctial points is meant ♈ and ♎, the two points of intersection that the Aequinoctial and the Ecliptick make) Now, in this case, the Sun must be nearest the Equinoctial point at ♈, because the Month is belonging to a Sign nearer ♈ than ♎. Therefore, fix your Compasses in the point of ♈, and extend the other foot to the Sun in the Ecliptick, which is I, and apply it to the line of Sines; or if you have no line of Sines, convert it to a Chord (by the second way of Measuring) and as many degrees as it is, so far is the Sun distant from the nearest Aequi∣noctial point; if it exceed 30 deg. the Sun must be in that de∣gree of ♉ that is above 30 deg. if it exceed 60 deg. the Sun must be in that degree of ♊ above 60; but here I find it in less than 30, namely, 29 deg. 3 min. therefore I conclude the Sun is in 20 deg. 3 min. of ♈. But suppose it were time of year that the Sun were return∣ing from the Tropick towards the Aequinoctial, and were the same Declination, then would the Suns place be the same from
entring into ♎, that it now is in ♈, namely, in 57 min. of ♍, which wants 29 deg. 3 min. of entring into ♎. Thus much for the Suns place. The Suns right Ascension is measured from the place where the Suns parallel of Declination cuts the Ecliptick to 6 of the Clock, which is I 6; set it off by the third way of Measuring to extend it to a Great Circle: for the Sine of I 6 is equal to the Sine of S ♈; when you have measured it, convert it into time, and set it down; I find it to be 1 hour 44 min. The Meridian Altitude of the Sun being given, and the Latitude, to find the Suns Decli∣nation, as also all the other things before found. Latitude 51 deg. Northerly, Meridian Altitude 52 deg. 30 min. I demand the Suns Declination, or any other thing that I found before. FOR the doing of this, project your Sphere (as before was shewed) that done, I consider the Meridian Alti∣tude of the Sun is given to be 52 deg. 30 min. I will take 52 deg. 30 min. from the Scale of Chords, and fix one foot of my Compasses in the South point of the Horizon at A, and extend the other foot upwards upon the Meridian, which falls at B; then I conclude the Sun is upon the Meridian, in the point B: Take the Distance between B and the Aequinoctial, which is B C, and apply it to the Scale of Chords, and so much as it is, so much is the Declination of the Sun; and you see it is Northerly, for the Sun is to the Northwards of the Aequinoctial. If you have a desire to find any thing else in this Sphere, draw the Parallel of the Suns Declination (thus found) and work with it as before in other Examples; also draw the Ecliptick and Tropick.
depiction of geometrical figure Many other things might be done, but for Brevities sake I omit them, judging this to be as much as we have occasion for in Navigation, which is the thing I aim at. If I have committed a fault in being too tedious in these things, pardon me, and remember it was my Beginnings; riper years (which may bring more ability, it is probable) will bring forth some∣thing more new and admirable. Be charitable. Terms of Art used in Navigation. LAtitude (as I have cited before) is the Distance between the Aequinoctial and the Zenith; what is meant by Lon∣gitude and Difference of Latitude, I have shewed before; also the difference between Longitude and Departure from the Meri∣dian, in this Book before.
Now in every Distance that is sailed upon any Course that makes an Angle from the Meridian, either of North or South, or the Parallels of East and West, that is to say, any Distance that is sailed upon a point that is between those Courses; we have these things considerable, namely, The Distance run, (which must be the longest side) the Difference of Latitude, and Difference of Longitude, or Departure from the Meridian, and the Course; the Course is the Point of the Compass or Rumb you steer on. A Dead Reckoning is when a man cannot observe, but is for∣ced to judge of the Course and Distance, to find the Differ∣ence of Latitude and Departure. A Reckoning is an Account of the Difference of Latitude and Departure from the Meridian, that is made in the time a Ship hath been out. Read Tan. for Tangent, Sine com. for Sine Complement, Tan. com. for Tangent Complement, comp arith. for Complement Arithmetical.
PROPOSITIONS of SAILING BY THE PLAIN SCALE. Difference of Latitude and Course given, to find the Distance run, and the Departure from the Meridian. QUESTION I. Admit I set from the Lizard, lying in the Latitude of 50 deg. and sail S W b W, till I alter my Latitude 1 degree or 60 miles: I demand my Distance run, and Departure from the Meridian. IN this Question we have the Course 5 points from the Me∣ridian towards the West, which is 5 times 11 deg. 15 min. or 56 deg. 15 min. for 5 times 15 min. is 75 min. or 1 deg. 15 min. and 5 times 11 deg. is 55 deg. to which add the 1 deg. and 15 min. and the whole is 56 deg. 15 min. To protract this Question or any other of this nature, I wish you to observe the end of your Book, that lies from you to be the North part of your Book, then that to the right hand will be the East part, that to the left hand the West, and that right to you the South part: The Reason why I wish you to observe this Method, is, that so in any Travis you may set every Angle the right way, which must be observed then, and is good to be always used.
First draw the South line B D, let B be the Lizard, then set off from B 60 miles upon the South line (taking it from a Scale of equal parts) which is your Southing B D. Forasmuch then as B D is the Difference of Latitude that I have made since I set from B, D must stand in the parallel that I am in; and be∣cause I have sailed to the Westwards of the Meridian D B, I depiction of geometrical figure will raise a Perpendicular which is a West line from D, and draw it at length, which is D A. This done, take an Arch of 60 deg. from your Scale of Chords, and (making the place you set from, the Center) describe the Arch D O, and upon it set off 56 deg. 15 min. which is D O 5 points; then by B and O draw the sine B O, till it intersect the line A D, which it doth in A: Now Forasmuch as D A is parallel in the Latitude the Ship was in after her sailing, and D B A an Angle of the Course from the Meridian, B A must intersect the West line in the place where the Ship is; then the Distance run is B A, and the Departure from the Meridian is D A, which take off severally, and apply to the Scale of equal parts, and set down what they come to: Here I find them as followeth:
The Distance runs is B A 108 miles. The Departure from the Meridian is 090 miles. But besides this Geometrical way of resolving Triangles, there is an exacter way by the Tables of Sines, Tangents, and Logarithms, which is done thus, A General Rule. Note that in all right lined Triangles the Sine of every Angle is proportional to its opposite side, or every side is proportional to the Sine of its opposite Angle. The greatest side will have the greatest Angle opposite to it, the last side will have the least Angle opposite to it: As here in this Question, A B is the longest side, and opposite to it is the right Angle B D A, which is the greatest Angle, A D is the next, and hath A B D to it, D B is the least side, and hath D A B for its opposite Angle, which is the least Angle. Now as the Sine of A is to B D, so is the Sine of D to A B, or the Sine of B to A D, and the contrary. To find the Distance run. As Sine com. B 56 deg. 15 min. comp. arith. 0,25526 To B D 60 min.   1,77815 So is Radius or Sine D 90 deg.     To A B 108 miles   2,03341 If Radius be not in the first place, you must take the Comple∣ment arithmetical of the first number, as here I have done; but if Radius be in the first place, take no Complement arith∣metical at all: The Complement arithmetical of a number is what every single figure wants of 9, take them in their due places, as here the Sine in the Tables answering to A 33 deg. 45 min. (which is the Sine Complement of B 56 deg. 15 min.) is 9,74473, whereas I have set it down 0,25526, now if you compare them, the number that I have taken is what the figures in the other want of 9, as 9 wants 0, and 7 wants 2, and 4
wants 5, and so forward; after the Complement arithmetical of the first number is taken, take the others as they be in the Tables, and add them together, casting away Radius always, and look for what comes out, either in the Sines, Tangents, or Logarithms, according as the order requires into which the pro∣portion runs. You see here I took no notice of Radius, which is a casting of him away: in like manner if the things added up come to above Radius, always cast Radius away, and set down what is above Radius; as here the last came out to be 11, and I cast away the 10, and set down 1. For the Departure from the Meridian. As Sine comp. B 56 deg. 15 min. comp. arith. 0,25526 Is to B D 60 miles   1,77815 So is Sine B 56 deg. 15 mim.   9,91984 To A D almost 90 miles   1,95325 But I have been often asked by them that I have learned, why I contradict the Rule, which saith, that the Sine of every Angle is proportional to its opposite side or the contrary. Now here you say, as Sine compl. B to B D, either you are false, or else the Sine comp. of B is the Sine of A, for A is the Angle oppo∣site to B D, whose Sine the Rule orders you to take. I answer that A is the Complement of B, for this is certain, that the three Angles of any right lined Triangle consists of a Semicircle or 180 deg. and neither more nor less: Now if it be so, B A D and D B A must together be but 90 deg. because B D A is 90 deg. it self; then if B is 56 deg. 15 min. the Sine comp. of it must be the Sine of 33 deg. 45 min. which is the Sine of A, opposite to B D. But you will ask how you should know that the three Angles of a right lined Triangle is but 180 deg. Pray mind this De∣monstration. In the right angled Triangle A B C, the Angle that is con∣tained between the Perpendicular and the Base (which is A B and B C) is always a right Angle, or 90 deg. 0 min. or 8 points
of the Compass, which is B: depiction of geometrical figure Now I say, that the other two A and C are just 90 deg. toge∣ther, which makes all three twice 90 deg. For your better satisfaction measuring the Angles thus: Set your Compass at any convenient distance, and from every angular point as a Cen∣ter, describe an Arch, as I O, U n, and s D; now I D is an Arch of 90 deg. 0. min. because it is included between two sides that are perpendicular one to the other; then U n and s O together are equal to I D; measure them, and set them upon the Arch I D, and they will be equal to it. From hence then it is evident, that s O and U n, or the two Angles beside the right Angle of any right angled Triangle, are Complements one of the other to 90 deg. or that the three Angles of any right lined Triangle are 180 deg. or two right Angles or a Semicircle. Course and Difference of Longitude in miles given, to find the Difference of Latitude and Distance. QUESTION II. Admit I set from the Lizard, lying in the Latitude of 50 deg. and sail S W b W, till I depart from my Meridian 90 miles: I demand my Difference of Latitude and Distance run. LEt A represent the place your Ship is in, after she hath sailed; from whence draw the East line A D, then take 90 miles from your Scale of equal parts, and set off upon that line from A, which falls at D. From D raise a Perpendicular or North line which is D B: Now, forasmuch as it is said, that the Ship sailed S W b W,
which is 5 points from the South towards the West backwards, that is N E b E, 5 points from the North towards the East, or 3 points from the East towards the North. I will take an Arch of 60 deg. from my Scale of Chords, and from A as a Center I'll describe the Arch O N, and from N I'll set 3 points upon that Arch which reacheth to O, and by A and O, I will draw depiction of geometrical figure the line A B till it cut the North and South line in B; then is B D the Difference of Latitude, and A B the Distance run, which measure and set down. The Difference of Latitude is 60 miles. The Distance run is 108 miles. By the Tables. For the Distance run. As Sine comp. A 33 deg. 45 min. comp. arith. 0,08015 To A D 90 miles 1,95424 So is Rodius   To A B almost 108 miles 2,03439
For the Difference of Latitude. As Radius to the Distance run 108 A B 2,03342 So is Sine comp. the Course 56 deg. 15 min. B 9,74473 To the Difference of Latitude D B 60 miles 1,77815 Here to find the Distance run, I made use of the things that were given me, but for brevities sake that I might shew the taking of a Complement arithmetical, I used Radius with the Distance before found, to find the Difference of Latitude. But if you would not do so, then the things given will do as well, and the Proportion holds thus. As Sine comp. A (which is Sine B) is to A D so is Sine A to B D. Course and Distance run given, to find the Difference of Latitude and Departure from the Meridian. QUESTION III. Admit I set from the Latitude of 50 deg. 0 min. and sail N E b N 108 miles: I demand the Difference of Latitude and Departure from the Meridian. LEt A D be a Meridian line, A the Latitude of the Lizard, D A B the Angle of the Course, set off by the Arch of 60 deg. N O s (N O being 3 points) A B a line drawn from the Latitude of the Lizard A by O, and the Distance that the Ship hath sailed set upon it, and no more, namely, 108 miles; then I conclude that the Ship is at B, from B let fall the Perpendicular B D, which cuts the Meridian in D, and leaves D A for the Difference of Latitude, and is it self the Departure from the Meridian; measure them as you have been shewed before, and apply them. Difference of Latitude D A 90 miles. Departure D B 60 miles.
depiction of geometrical figure By Proportion. I have two things given besides the right Angle, namely, the side A B 108 miles, and the Angle B A D 33 deg. 45 min. there∣fore to find the Difference of Latitude A D. As Radius   To the Distance run 108 miles B A 2,03342 So is Sine comp. A 33 deg. 45 min. 9,91984 To A D the Difference of Latitude 90 miles 1,95326
For the Departure from the Meridian. As Radius   To the Distance run 108 miles B A 2,03342 So is Sine A 33 deg. 45 min. 9,74473 To D B the Departure from the Meridian 60 miles 1,77815 In your putting things in proportion, follow these directions; always put the required thing in the last place, and the things you know, make use of, and put in proportion to find the things you know not. If it be a Side you are to find, begin with an Angle; if it be an Angle, begin with a Side Here it was a Side that was to be found (in both these Propor∣tions) you see I began with an Angle, that I knew which was Radius; but you may ask why I did not begin with the given Angle at A or B as well, I answer, because neither of the things opposite to them were given, so that I could not proceed, if I had. Distance run and Difference of Latitude given, to find the Course and Departure from the Meridian. QUESTION IV. Admit I set from the Latitude of the Lizard 50 deg. 0 min. and sail upon some point between the North and the West 108 miles, till I alter my Latitude 1 deg. 30 min. or 90 miles: I demand the Departure from the Meridian and Course. FIrst draw the North and South line A D at length: Let A be the place in the Latitude of 50 deg. take the Difference of Latitude 90 miles from the Scale of equal parts, and set it off North from A, which falls at D: Now because D is as far to
the Northwards of A, as the Difference of Latitude which you made from A is, therefore if you draw the West line D B at length, it must cut through the place where the Ship is: I look upon the Question again, and I find that the Distance run since the Ship set out is 108 miles; take 108 miles from the Scale of equal parts; and because the Ship set from A, depiction of geometrical figure fix one foot in A, and where the other foot intersects, or cuts the parallel that the Ship is in D B, there the Ship must be; and thus if her Difference of Latitude be A D 90, and her Di∣stance run A B 108 miles, B D must be the Westing, and n O
the measure of the Course from the Meridian of Northwesterly, or the Angle D A B. Take the Difference of Longitude D B, and apply it to your Scale as before. Take O N the measure of the Angle of the Course, and apply it to the Scale of Chords (if you are minded to see her Course from the Meridian in degrees and minutes) to the points of the Compass, if you desire to know it in points. Note that A is the Center of the Arch O n 60 deg. It is plain, that if an Arch of 60 deg. described, and any number of points or degrees that is set upon it, be an Angle of those points set down (as it hath been in every Example before) then whatsoever you take from an Arch of 60 deg. is fit to apply to the Scale. I find the Course to be North 33 deg. 45 min. Westerly, or N W b N. I find the Departure from the Meridian to be 60 mil. By the Tables. Here I have given the Distance run A B, and the right Angle opposite to it, and the Difference of Latitude A D, whereby I may find the Angle opposite to it B, or the Complement of it, which is A, the Angle of the Course. For the Course. As the Distance run A B 108 miles comp. arith. 7,966576 Is to Radius     So is the Difference of Latitude A D 90 miles 1,954242 To the Course or Rumb Sine comp. B 33 d. 33 m. 9,920818 For the Departure. As Radius   To the Distance run A B 108 miles 2,0334237 So is Sine the Course A 33 deg. 33 min. 9,9424616 To D B the Diff of Longi. here found to be 60 miles 1,7758853
You may ask the reason why the Course is not 33 deg. 45 min. as it was first given to be: I answer, because of the part of an unite, that the Difference of Latitude was set down more than it should be; for if you observe, I said it was almost 90 miles, when I found it before: Now the error is not worth minding in Sailing, for the Difference that the Fraction causeth is but 12. min. of a degree of a point of the Compass, which is no more than the 56th. part of a point. If you mind, I have worked the Course thus found, and it doth not alter the Difference of Longitude or Departure (which should be 60 miles, if I had worked to the least Fraction) for the Logarithm here is nearest to the Logarithm of 60 in the Tables: Indeed I worked on purpose thus, because those that I have taught, when they could not find it come out right as the other was, could not tell where the fault lay; now this will direct them to know that some part of a unite missing in the find∣ing of the Sides, may make some minutes Difference in the Course: But now, here in the following Examples we will work to a Fraction, namely, to the 10th. or 100th. part of a unite, (in the sides) to shew how it is done; though in Sailing if you work to half an unite, it is near enough, or for any ordinary uses (and that the Tables give) and most commonly to less. Departure from the Meridian and Distance run given, to find the Course and Difference of Latitude. QUESTION V. Admit the Departure from the Meridian were the same that the Difference of Latitude was in the first Question 60 miles, the Distance run also 108 miles: I demand the Course and Difference of Latitude, let the Latitude you set from be 50 deg. HEre the Course from the Meridian will be the Complement of the Course there, and the Difference of Latitude will be the Difference of Longitude, or Departure from the Meridian there.
But instead of taking the Logarithm answering to the number here, take the Logarithm answering to ten times the number, and so you shall always have your sides come out to the tenth part of a unite; I say it will come out in tenths, for you must divide by 10, to bring it into miles after it is done. Now instead of multiplying your given sides by 10, do but set a Cipher more to the number and it is done, as now for 60 set down 600, which is ten times 60; for 108 set down 1080, which is ten times 108; and thus for any number that will be comprehended in the Radius of the Tables. Proportion for the Course As Distance run given B A 1080 tenths comp. arith. 6,9665762 Is to Radius,   So is the Departure from the Meridian 600 tenths D B 2,7781512 To the Sine of the Course A 33 deg. 45 min. 9,7447274 For the Difference of Latitude. As Radius   To the Distance run 1080 tenths B A 3,0334327 So is the Sine comp. of A 33 deg. 45 m. 9,9198464 To the Diff. of Latitude in tenths D A 898 tenths 2,9533708 Divide these tens by 10, and it gives the miles con∣tained  in the side D A the Difference of Latitude, which is 89 miles 8 tenths of a mile, whereas before it was 90 miles, whis is 2 tenths of a mile more: Now when you have the sides thus found in tenths or Centisms; work for the Angles, and you will find them to come out roundly alike: But if you desire more exactness, work then in Centisms, pro∣vided, that the numbers in Centisms do not out-run the Tables. A Centism is the hundredth part of an unite, or of any thing; and if I would put the number 60 into Centisms, I will set two Ciphers behind it, and it is the same as before; I multi∣plied
60 by 100, for it is 6000, the like is to be understood of any other number. I would work to the nearest Fraction for the Angles here, but I conceive it to be no way beneficial, and therefore I'll refer it to the work of the Sphere, where it is of uch more use; this finds the Angles to a minute, which is near enough. It is like that some will be so curious, that this way of finding things to the tenth or hundredth part of unit will not suffice them, but they would have the real number answering to the Logarithm to the 1000th. part of a unite; because I find it of no real consideration or use in Navigation, I omit that here, and desire such to look in Book 1. Page 11. of my Fathers Tri∣gonometry, and there it is plainly shewed. By the Plain Scale. This Question differs nothing from the other in its operation, only as you work in the other from a North and South line, here you work from an East and West line; The work is this. First, draw an East and West line, and from the west end of it, set off your Departure from the Meridian, which is from D to B 60 miles; from D raise the Perpendicular D A (which is a North and South line) and draw it at length; then take the Distance run 108 miles, and fix one foot of your Compasses in B, with the other cut the Meridian line D A, which it doth in A. Draw the side A B: then is B the place your Ship is at after her Sailing, A is the place of her setting out, A D is the Dif∣ference of Latitude and N O s is an Arch of 60 deg. from the Angle D A B (as a Center) the measure of N O is the Course, and is performed as before in the last Example; and also of the Difference of Latitude as in other Examples. The Difference of Latitude is D B 90 miles. The Course is North 33 deg. 45 min. Easterly, D A B or N O. The Plain Scale of equal parts will not resolve to the least Fra∣ction as the Tables will now to a tenth part of a mile, I confess a good Diagonal Scale will produce things to a small Fraction. If you would know what Latitude you are in, divide 90 by 60, and the Quotient will be degrees, namely, 1 deg. the Re∣mainder
minutes, namely 30 min. Now because your Latitude was Northerly, and you have gone to the Northwards, you have increased it 1 deg. 30 min. so that you must add the Dif∣ference of Latitude to 50 deg. and it makes 51 deg. 30 min. if you have gone to the Southwards, you must have subtracted. depiction of geometrical figure
Difference of Latitude and Departure from the Meridian given, to find the Course and Distance run QUESTION VI. Admit the Departure from the Meridian of the Lizard that I make be 89 miles 8 tenths of a mile, and I am in the Latitude of 51 deg. 0 min. I demand how the Lizard bears off me, and what distance I am from it, provided that I sail between the North and the West. FIrst, draw a North and South line, and upon it set off the Difference of Latitude, which is D B 60 miles; then from the Northermost part of your Difference of Latitude, which is D, raise a Perpendicular, East and West line, and set off your Departure from the Meridian upon it, from D, which falls at A: Then from A draw A B, for the Distance run; and because B is the place you set from, let it be the Cen∣ter depiction of geometrical figure
of the Arch of 60 deg. s O D, on which the measure of the Course is O D, which must be measured, as you have been shewed, and also the Distance run A B. The Course I find to be N W b W. The Distance run 108 miles. By Proposition. The Rule that we have used for resolving all the Questions hitherto laid down was this. That the Sine of every Angle is proportional to its opposite Side, or every Side is proportional to the Sine of its opposite Angle: and this served where you had opposite things given, but here you have two sides, and an Angle between them given, so that you have nothing opposite to any of them, therefore that general Rule is of no value here in this case; this is a general Rule for this case, That, As the Sum of the two given Sides is to their Dif∣ference; So is the Tangent of the half Sum opposite Angles, To the Tangent of the Difference of either of them: That is, as the Sum of D B and D A together, is to their Difference, So is the Tangent of the half of A and B, to the Tangent of their Difference. Which Angle added to the half Sum makes the greatest, or subtracted from the half Sum it makes the least Angle. But this Rule though it be rare and true, yet in right angled Triangles we have a briefer way, which we will use, and leave this till we come to Oblique Triangles, as a place fitter for it: I only named it here, because I would give notice that my Father in saying all, he means  for he saith (Axiom 3. Book 1.) All plain Triangles, &c. The reason why this Rule is not so good here, is this, if you subtract the Right Angle which is here always known from 180 deg. the Remainder is 90 deg. the Sum of the unknown Angles together, the half of which is 45 deg. now 45 deg. is the Radius of a Tangent, which is in∣different whether you take it or no, for it must be cast away in your work: and therefore if you only take the Logarithm an∣swering to the Sum of the two Sides comp. arith. and the Loga∣rithm of the Difference of them and add them together, they will produce this Angle of the Difference, which added to 45 deg.
is the greater or subtracted is the lesser; but which is better, you may do it with less trouble this way. Say for the Course, As the Difference of Latitude 60 miles comp. arith. Is to Radius So is the Departure from the Meridian A D 89 8 tenths To the Tangent of the Course A B. Or, As the Departure is to Radius; So is the Difference of Latitude to Tangent Complement of the Course, Tangent A. We will work it in tenths. As Diff. of Latitude 600 tenths B D comp. arith. 7,2218487 Is to Radius   So is the Departure 898 tenths A D 2,9532763 To the Tang. of the Course, Tan. B 56 d. 15 m. 10,1751250 Now the Angle comes out to a minute of a degree. And thus you have your desire at once; but this will be thus in none but right angled Triangles (whereas I said before the Radius of a Tangent 45 deg.) is always half the Sum of the required Angles. Note, that you always begin with the Side that is not opposite to the Angle you would have, and then you will put the Side that is opposite to the Angle in Proportion, with the Tangent of it; and thus for any other right angled Triangle of this nature: Difference of Latitude given alone, Difference of Longitude and Distance run in one intire Sum, I demand the Course and Sides several. QUESTION VII. Admit I set from the Latitude of 50 deg. and sail upon some Point between the South and the West, till I come into the Latitude of 49 deg. 0 min. (by Observation.) Now those that keep account of things, tell me, that the Distance that the Ship hath run, and the Departure from the Meridian, is together 197 8/10 miles: I demand them several and the Course. IN this case (because it would take up more room than my Book would hold) I'll make every 10 upon my Scale of
equal parts 20, then every one of the small divisions will be 2. For the protracting of it Geometrically, first draw the North and South line B R at length, and upon it set off your Diffe∣rence of Latitude, which is D B, make B the place of your Ships setting out, because it is the Northermost Latitude, and your Difference of Latitude is Southerly, raise a Perpendicular (or depiction of geometrical figure East and West line) from D, and it must cut through the place where the Ship is; because she is in that Parallel or Latitude: upon this East and West line, from D set the Distance run, and Departure together, which is 197 miles 8/10, and it reacheth to E: by E and B draw the line E B, and divide it into two equal parts by a Perpendicular (you see it is a Perpendicular by the Arches h I and f g) draw it from P, till it cuts the Parallel E D, which it doth in A; from A then draw a line to the place you proposed to your self the Ship set from, which is B; now the length of that line, namely, A B, shall be the Distance run, and A D the Departure from the Meridian. Demonstration. B E is divided into two equal parts in P, then E P and P B must be equal, P A is a Perpendicular to E P and B P, then
must A B and A E be equal, because the Perpendicular P A serves for them both, and their Bases, or the sides E P and P B are equal, as was said before. It is evident then, that B A and A D are equal to E D, for if E A added to A D makes E D, A B which is equal to A E, ad∣ded to A D must be the same: and thus A B is the Distance run, and A D the Difference of Longitude or Departure from the Meridian, measure them as before; also from B as a Center, describe the Arch of 60 deg. S N, and extend the Sides A B and B R to it, and measure the Angle of the Course A B D (as be∣fore) whose measure is N s, And thus much for the Geometri∣cal way of working and demonstrating. The Distance run A B is 108 miles: The Departure from the Meridian A D is 90 miles: The Course is S W b W. By the Tables. I consider that the side D B (the Difference of Latitude) and D E the Distance run and Difference of Longitude together are given in the Question at first; whereby we may by the last Example, find the Angle at E, in the right angled Triangle B D E: Thus For the Angle at E and so for the Course. As D E Dist. run, and Depar. 197 8/10 which is 1978 tenths comp. arith. 6,7037736 Is to Radius     So is the Difference of Latitude D B 600 tenths 2,7781512 To Tangent E 16 deg. 53 min.   9,4819248 The Complement of which to 90 deg. is E B D 73 deg. 7 min. Now because the Angle P E A and P B A is equal, subtract the Angle E B A from E B D, and the Remainder is A B D the Course Example. E B A 16 deg. 53 min. equal to A E P, subtracted from E B D 73 deg. 7 min. the Remainder is A B D 56 d. 15 m. the Course. The reason that I take 3 from 7, and set down 5 is, because if you look to the absolute minute, and part of a minute of the
Arch that answers to this artificial Tangent 9,4819248, it will fall to such a Fraction, or to be the 15 part of a minute less than 3, as will bring it out; but it is needless to be so exact in cases or Questions of this nature. I will not shew how to work that, till I come to a work that requires such exactness; here you see if you take it without al∣lowing for the Fraction, it is but 1 min. less or more, which is but the 675th. part of a point of the Compass, but to go to the exactness of it, it is the same. For the Departure from the Meridian A D. As Sine comp. the Course A B D 56 d. 15 m. co. ar. 0,2552609 To the Difference of Latitude 600 tenths B D 2,7781512 So is the Sine of the Course 56 deg 15 min. A B D 2,9198464 To the Departure from the Meridian A D 898 tenths 9,9532585 Which divided by 10, brings out 89 miles 8 tenths of a mile, as it was in the former Examples. To find the Distance run A B. As Sine com. A B D the Course 56 d. 15 m. co. ar. 0,2552609 To the Difference of Latitude 600 tenths B D 2,7781512 So is Radius to the Distance A B 108 miles 3,0334121 A TRAVIS. Admit I set from Sommars Islands lying in the Latitude of 32 deg. 20 m. North Lat. and sail S E 40 leagues; from thence S S E, till I alter my Latitude 1 d. 0 m. from thence upon some point between the North and the East 40 leagues, till I alter my Lat 1 d. 45 m. I demand what Lat. I am in, my Distance run upon a streight line, my Departure from my first Meridian, and my Course made good. FOr the doing this Geometrically, I have the Distance run, and the Course given; to lay down the Triangle A C B, make A the place you set from, and lay it down as was shewed in an Example of that nature before, Quest. 3.
Then it is said, from thence I sailed S S E, till I altered my Latitude 1 deg. or 20 leagues; which signifies that from C is the place I altered my Course; therefore from C draw a South line, which must be parallel to A B s; Consider what you have given, and work as hath been shewed in an Example of that nature, Quest. 1. be sure to set your Angles the right way: After that Angle is worked, depiction of geometrical figure I find my Ship is at e, then from e, draw the North line e G parallel to the first North and South line (for the Course is Northerly) and work your Tri∣angle as hath bin shewed in an Ex∣ample of that kind Quest. 4. where the Diffe∣rence of Latitude and Distance run is given, and you will find your Ship at F; let fall a Perpendicular from F upon the first Merid. line (which falls at R) and the length of it is the Departure from your first Meridian that you have made; likewise it cuts that Meridian, so that it leaves the Difference of Latitude R A, that you have made since you set out; then if you draw the line A F, it is the Distance that your Ship is now from the place she set from; and if you describe your first Arch of 60 deg. from s to O, and extend your side A F to it, it gives the measure of the Course s e O: Note that your Difference of
Latitude is Southerly, and therefore you must cast it into de∣grees and minutes, and subtract it from 32 deg. 20 min. (your first Latitude) and the Remainder is the Latitude you are in; whereas if you had been in a Southern Latitude, and had differed your Latitude farther Southerly, you must have made your Latitude so much more, by adding your Difference of La∣titude, as here, if you had gone to the Northwards, you must have done so, to have known your increase of Latitude Norther∣ly: The like is to be understood in any case else of this nature. Here following I have answered the demands. The departure from the first Meridian is F R 56 leagues. The Course is the measure of the Arch s e O, which is E S E 9 deg. 8 min. Easterly. The Distance that I am from the Port I set is A F 57 leagues. Diff. of Lat. made since I set out is R A 13 leagues or 00 d. 39 m. Which subtracted from the Latitude I set from 32 20 The Remainder is the Latitude you are now in 31 41 And thus you see you sailed from A to C, and then altered your Course, and sailed from C to e, and then from E to F; the like is to be understood of any Travis else. And thus if you had a Travis of 24 hours, you might find what Distance your Ship is from the place she was the day before, and he other things, as Difference of Latitude, the Latitude you are in, the Depar∣ture, the Course made good upon a streight distance; so that you need not set down every thing to every alteration in your Reckoning which is endless and fruitless. By the Tables. To give an answer to the demands in the Travis, you need find nothing but the Difference of Latitude, and Departure that is made in every Angle and note which way it is, either North or South for Latitude; East or West for Longitude, and taking this notice after you have done, see which is greatest, (in the Difference of Latitude) either the Northing or Southing, or for Longitude the Easting or Westing, and that which is greatest, that way it is, and so much as it is above the other: We will shew an Example of this, when we have wrought the Travis.
I mind the Travis, and I find I have the Course and Distance run in the first Triangle, to find the Difference of Latitude and Departure. For the Departure. As Radius   To the Distance run A C 40 leagues 400 tenths 2,6020600 So is the Course B A C 45 deg. 9,8494800 To the Depar. BC 283 tenths or 28 leag. 3 tenths 28 leagues 3 tenths East Departure. 2,4515450 For the Difference of Latitude. Forasmuch as the Angle opposite to the Difference of Lati∣tude, is equal to the Angle opposite to the Departure, namely, both 45 deg. the Sides will be also equal, therefore is A B the Difference of Latitude South 28 leagues 3 tenths. For the Second Triangle. Here I have given the Difference of Latitude and Course to find the Departure from the Meridian, which is all I need. As Sine com. the Course D C E 22 d. 30 m. co. ar. 0,0343846 Is to the Diff. of Latitude 20 leagues or 291 tenths 2,3010300 So is the Sine of the Course D C E 22 deg. 0 min. 9,5828307 To the Departure D F 8 8/10 leagues or 88 tenths 1,9182543 The Departure is 8 leagues 8 tenths East, because the Course is Easterly. For the third Triangle. In the third Triangle I have given the Difference of Latitude, and Distance run, to find the Departure. For the Course. As the Distance run G F 40 leagues comp arith. 7,3979399 Is to Radius   So is the Difference of Latitude G e 35 leagues 3,5440680 To the Sine comp. of the Course s G F e, the comp. of which is the Course G e F 28 deg. 58 min. 9,9420079
For the Departure As Radius   To the Distance 40 leagues 2,6020600 So is the Course 28 deg. 58 min. 9,6851151 To the Departure 19 4/10 leagues 2,2871751 The Departure is East, because the Course is Easterly. Thus now in every Angle you know the Difference of Longi∣tude and Difference of Latitude in leagues, and also which way either North or South, East or West, set them down apart thus: Lon. East. Lon. West. Northing. Southing. 28 3/10 00 00 28 3/10 8 3/10 00 00 20 19 4/10 00 35 00 56 1/10 00 35 48 3/10 Here I have added them up, and I find no West Longitude, so that the Departure from the Meridian is East 56 leagues 1/10, the Difference of Latitude North I find to be 35 leagues, the Difference of Latitude Southerly is 48 3/10, subtract the North∣ing which is least from the Southing, and the remainder is the Difference of Latitude in the whole run 13 leagues 3/10; if you had West Longitude, you must have subtracted thus likewise, and that which was greatest the remainder belongs to.
OF A RECKONING. FRom what hath been already shewed, you understand, that if the Latitude of two places be known, and the Difference of Longitude between them, you may find the bearing of them one from the other, their distance asunder, or any thing you desire; and this is all so plain, that if I set from a place, and am bound to a place, whose Latitude is known, and the difference of Longitude also known between them, and keep a reckoning of the departure both East and West that I make, setting them down in two di∣stinct Columns; it is but subtracting one from the other, and the remainder will be the East or West Longitude that I have made, (that of the two which was most,) also, if I know what Latitude I am in, and what Latitude the place lies in, it is but subtracting the lesser from the greater, and the remainder will be the difference of Latitude between your ship and that place (provided the Latitudes be both one way.) Also, subtract the Difference of Longitude that you have made, (provided that it be that way which shortens your Longitude between the place you set from, and are bound to,) from the whole difference of Longitude between the two places, and the remainder will be what is still between you and the place you are bound to: but if your departure which you have made, hath increased the difference of Longitude between the place you set from, and are bound to, add the remainder (after your subtracting the Columns one from the other) to the whole difference of Longitude be∣tween the places; the like for Latitude.
Example in the Reckoning following. Suppose the Island of Ditiatha lies so, that it hath been found to have 950 Leagues departure West, from the Meridian of the Lizard (according to the Courses that be ordinarily sailed by Plano) the Latitude of it is 16 deg. 16 min. North Latitude, the Lizard lies in the Latitude of 50 deg. 00 min. Now upon some Occasion that fell in the term of our Voyage, namely, the 29th. of January on Tuesday, the Captain demands of me, what Di∣stance Ditiatha was from me by Plano, how it bears, what Lea∣gues of Departure I have to it, and the like: I look in my Reckoning, and I find in the West Column 434 Leagues, I look in the East Column and see 60 Leagues; I subtract 60 (my whole East Column) from 434 (the whole West Column) and the Remainder is 374 Leagues; which signifieth the Ship hath de∣parted from the Meridian of the Lizard 374 Leagues West; for the West Column was greatest. Subtract this West departure 374 Leagues, from 950 the whole Departure, and I find there is still wanting 576 Leagues; This 576 Leagues is the Departure that is from the Meridian that my Ship is in, and Ditiatha. Subtract also the Latitudes one from the other, (namely, the Latitude your Ship is in, and the Latitude of Ditiatha) and the Remainder is the Difference of Latitude in degrees and minutes between the Ship and the Place you are bound to, which in this Example I find to be 6 degrees 24 minutes. Take the Latitude out of the Column of Latitude for that day in the Reckoning, and you will find it so, if you subtract 16 deg 16 min. from it. Thus you have the Difference of Latitude between you, that day, and your Port, and the Departure that the Port hath from the Meridian that you are in that day, given you to find the things demanded; I will not work it, for it hath beeen shewed sufficiently already. I have here following set down a Reckoning, and afterwards how I work it, and lastly the reason that makes me use this way of keeping my whole Reckoning in the last line, so that I am not troubled to add it up, when I give account of it.
January the 3d Anno Dom. 1655, we departed from the Lizard, lying in the Latitude of 50 d. 00 m. being bound for Ditiatha, which lies in the Latitude of 16 d. 16 m. it having West Departure from the Meridian of the Lizard 950 Leagues (according to the courses which we then steered) at 4 of the clock, the Lizard bore from us N N E, about 6 leagues distance by estimation. EVery day at Sea you set down at noon that 24 hours work: Now I advise you to set it down as it is here: In the first Column on the left hand, I set the day of the Month, in the next the day of the Week, in the third the Latitude I am in by dead Reckoning or by Obser∣vation, only I make a distin∣ction between them by the letter E, which stands for E∣stimation, and is set down on∣ly when I do not observe: that so you may know where to begin to correct. In the 4th. Column I set down the Easting, in the fifth column the Westing. The manner that I set my Easting and Westing down is thus.

Again, the next day at noon, I work my Ships Travis, as hath been shewed, and I find that she hath departed from the Meri∣dian she was in yesterday 38 Leagues West, which I add to what I had before, which was 21, and it makes 59 Leagues; and thus I go forwards, adding my last days departure in its true Column to all the rest, (which is in one sum) and by this means the last line is the whole Reckoning. 21 38 59 In the East Column I set Ciphers to fill it up, till I have some East departure to put in it, and as that increaseth, so I add it (as the other) every day. Also, I carry the West departure along in its full number of Leagues in the same line, without increase or decrease, till such time as I have more to increase it, and then I increase that, and carry the whole Easting with it in the same line: and thus you have need to look upon nothing, but the last line, to resolve you any thing that you desire, either of your course made good since you set out, your distance upon a straight line that you have failed, your Ports bearing from you, what departure is yet be∣tween
you and your Port, your distance to it upon a straight line; for there you have your whole Westing, and your whole East∣ing, and the Latitude you are in, as also the Latitude of the place you are bound to; whereby (as I have formerly shewed) you may find them. If there be Longitude but one way, you will see nothing but Ciphers in the other Column: this way you see is done without a Plat. I hold a Plat to be necessary only to shew what dangers lie in your way, that so you may shape a course clear by it, and I should use a Plat for nothing else, except it be for Coasting, where it is really useful. I commonly set down the Easting or Westing between the place I set and the place I am bound to at the beginning of my reckoning, as also the Latitude of each place, as I have done here. You may ask why I do not set down the course that I made good every day: indeed that is not unnecessary, but the reason why I omit it is, First, because I find it of little use in my Reckoning; and secondly, I find it can be better expressed in a Journal which is kept with my Reckoning; and indeed there I set it with the Winds, and the reasons for steering upon such Courses: but I leave every one to their own Judgment for that, as also for Distances and Winds, for Difference and Variation. It would have been necessary here to have set down some Ta∣bles to have worked Triangles by, for (as I have said) sometimes in 24 hours you have a Travis of 4 or 5 several courses, and to work them this way may seem tedious. I commend you to my Fathers Practice, where there is as good Tables as can be, to every degree of the Compass; its use is easie, and works to the tenth part of a Mile or League.
CONCERNING the VARIATION OF THE COMPASS. THere is always two things given to find the Variation of the Compass; that is, the true Amplitude of the Suns rising, and the Magnetical Amplitude of the Suns rising or setting: the true Amplitude of the Suns rising, is, (as I have said before in another place) the true and absolute quantity of degrees, that the Sun riseth from the East, (either Northwards or Southwards) or sets from the West, and is found (as I have before shewed) in the use of the Sphere. The Magnetical Amplitude of the Sun, is what the Sun riseth from the East, or sets from the West by the Compass: Now be∣cause the first gives the Truth how far the Sun riseth from the East, or sets from the West; therefore whatsoever difference there is between them, so much is the variation. As now, Suppose I find in a certain Latitude such a day of the Month (by the Sphere) that the Sun riseth to the Northwards of the East 17 degrees; that is, the true Amplitude: but I observe the Sun at her Rising, with an Azimuth Compass (which is made for that purpose) and find that she riseth but East 10 degrees Northerly; then I conclude the Variation is 7 deg. 0 min. or the Compass is false so much; so that whereas if I direct my Course East 10 degrees Northerly by the Compass, I do not go on that Course, but I go East and by North 5 deg. 45 min. Northerly, which is just 7 d. from my expectation, or East 17 deg. Northerly,
the true Amplitude. Now that is a gross error, and in long runs may deceive a man much, and perhaps be a means to lose a Ship, when one little thinks of it; and therefore it ought to be looked to. An Azimuth Compass is no other in effect, but a Compass fitted for the exact taking of the Sun at her Rising or Setting, or upon other certain times of the day, as you may have occasion. In like manner you may find the Variation of the Compass at other times, by taking the Suns Azimuth at any time of the day. Example. Suppose I were in the Latitude of 33 deg. 20 min. Northerly, and upon the 8th. day of November the Suns Declination is Southerly 19 deg. 20 min. I demand the Suns Azimuth at 8 of the Clock. The Suns Azimuth at her Rising (as I have shewed) is the Complement of the Suns Amplitude; but after the Sun is up, it may be also the Distance of the Sun from the East and West Azimuth: Now in this Proposition, you de∣sire to know how many Degrees the Sun is from the East and West Azimuth, (which is that Part of the Heavens that is distant from the Sun) parallel to the Horizon over the East Point of it; or if it had been at 4 of the Clock in the Afternoon, it would have been required from the West Point. For the resolving this Question project a Sphere (as hath been taught) for the Latitude proposed, with the Parallel of the Suns Declination drawn as it is given: Divide this Parallel of Declination into the hours of the day from 6 to 12, or which serves from 12 to 6 in the Afternoon; the way to divide it is thus; From 6 of the Clock set off 15 degrees by the third way of measuring, which will be 7, then (because 30 de∣grees is two hours in time) next set off 30 degrees by the third way of Measuring from 6, and it makes 8 a Clock; then take
45 deg. which is three hours, and it makes 9 a Clock, then 60 deg. for 10 a Clock, then 75 deg. for 11 a Clock, and then 90 deg. which will just fall in the place where the Sun comes to the Meridian for 12 a Clock. Thus you divide the Parallel of the Suns Declination into hours, as you may see in the Sphere here following: it being thus divided, the Suns Azi∣muth at 8 of the Clock is 8 s, taken off by the third way of Measuring, I find it to be 33 deg. 0 min. (by the Scale) so it is certain that the Sun should be just 33 deg. 0 min. to the Southwards of the East at 8 of the Clock, then I will see how high he should be at that time, and I find him to be 13 deg. 50 min. equal to s ♈, take off s ♈ by the second way of Measuring. I will observe the Sun till I find him at that height, and then I know it is 8 of the Clock; see by your Azimuth Compass whether he be 33 deg. 0 min. from the East or no, and if not, what it differs, so much is the Variation of the Compass. I have wrought this Example no nearer than the plain Scale works it, which possibly may be 15 min. or half a de∣gree of the Compass out of the way, but that is no consi∣derable error in a Course, which is the thing we here use it for. The same may be done at any time of the day, as La∣titude 32 deg. 20 min. North, Declination 19 deg. 20 min. South. Suppose it were cloudy, but at some time the Sun breaks out, so that I have an opportunity to take his height with my Quadrant, and also his magnetical Azimuth with my Azimuth Compass: Now I find his height to be r t, equal to N P, and the Azimuth at that time is N t, it being drawn parallel to the Horizon; this N t set off by the third way of Measuring, and so much as it comes to, so much is the true Azimuth of the Sun from the East towards the South: Take your magnetical Azimuth at the same time, and as much as they differ, so much is the Variation: And thus much for the Variation of the Compass. I have known some able men that have missed Barbadoes, and I have observed that it hath been most commonly, when the
depiction of geometrical figure Sun hath had North Declination, so far that he hath been to the Northwards of that Latitude. Now I suppose the reason of it may be this. When a man observes the Sun with a Quadrant (which is our usual Instrument) he takes the upper edge, which is to the Northwards in this Latitude. Suppose then I set from the Lizard, and am bound to Barbadoes, I make observations of the Sun as often as I can all the way, till I bring the Sun to the Zenith: after I pass the Zenith, the edge of the Sun that was highest is lowest: Now he that doth not consider this, loseth the
bredth or Diameter of the Sun, so that your observations may differ from your expectation 30 miles, which is enough to miss an Island; therefore I advise you always to allow the Suns Di∣ameter (which some count 30 min.) to every observation you make in places where the Sun is to the Northwards of you; that is, make your Meridian Altitude 30 min. less than it is, which is the Altitude of the lower edge, which was your upper edge before you crossed the Zenith, where the Sun was; or if you work your observations by the Complement of his height, make that 30 min. more. I confess the best way would be at all times to subtract the Semidiameter of the Sun, which is 15 min. from your Meridian Altitude: But because the Latitude of Places are not set down with this consideration, it is more safe to do as before, unless you know otherwise by your own experience. This only by the by to give notice. Example, for the laying open of this Error. Suppose I observe the Sun at Barbadoes the 11th. day of December, and I find that the Meridian Altitude of the Suns upper edge is 53 deg. 18 min. to which I add the Suns Declinati∣on for that day, which is Southerly 23 deg. 30 min. and it gives the height of the Aequinoctial above the Horizon of the Com∣plement of the Latitude to 90 degrees, which is 76 deg. 48 min. which subtracted from 90 degrees, leaves the Latitude or Aequi∣noctial's Distance from the Zenith, 13 deg. 12 min. Upon the 11th. of June, I observe the Sun again in the same place, and I find the Meridian Altitude of the upper edge of the Sun is 80 deg. 12 min. (Note that this upper edge is opposite to the edge before, for the Suns Declination is 23 deg. 30 min. Northerly, which makes that the Sun gives a South Horizon) I add the Suns Declination to the Meridian Altitude, and it gives 103 deg. 42 min. the Distance between the Aequinoctial and the North Horizon, from which subtract 90 deg. and the remainder is the Aequinoctial's distance from the Zenith, or the Latitude which is 13 deg. 42 min. Now this Latitude should agree with the other, for the place stands still; but for want of
this subtracting the Semidiameter of the Sun, it differs 30 min. and when men meet with things thus at Sea, for want of minding of this they run 30 min. more Southerly than they should do, which I suppose may be the greatest reason of their missing this Island, and others that lie near the Aequinoctial; but for those places that lie far from the bounds of the Sun, it is not to be minded: Yet it were good (methinks) if all Places had been laid down with allowance for the Suns Semidiameter; but be∣cause they are not, you ought to be careful, when at any time you cross the Zenith of the Sun: I have not been my self in a time of year to cross the Suns Zenith, and therefore I only set this down by way of Caution to those that may.
The USE of a PLAIN SEA-CHART. MOst Plats have all the Points of the Compass drawn out from several Centers through the Plat, and be∣cause they are common, and the way to work by them so ordinarily known, I have thought it ne∣cessary to draw the manner of a Plat, and to shew its use that hath only Meridians and Parallels drawn in it, which is the Plat following. Suppose then that I have a Plat that hath the Meridians and Parallels drawn to every fourth degree, as this following is. You see this Plat is divided into equal Squares throughout, by the Meridians and Parallels so drawn, also one of these Squares is divided into eight Points of the Compass, which is the Square E C D O, (the manner of dividing it we will shew anon.) Now if A where the Lizard, and B were the Island Madera, I demand their distance asunder. Let B A represent the edge of a Scale lying between them, take the Distance A B, and apply it to the Meri∣dian, and see how many degrees it reacheth, and convert them into miles, and it answers your desire. If you cannot take the distance at once, take it at twice, and add the several Sums toge∣ther, and convert them into miles: Then For their bearing one from the other. Imagine (as I said before) that A B were the edge of a Scale cutting upon the two places. Look for that Corner
that is nearest without the edge (which is S) fix one foot of your Compasses in S, and with the other sweep the edge of your Scale, which will be S G, keep fast your Scale, and from the Corner S run that foot of your Compasses (keeping it at the same Distance from the Scale by the other foot running by the edge of the Scale) till you come to the next side with it (which in this ex∣ample fails at F) then take the Distance E L, and apply it to the graduated Square, either from D or E, and as many points as it is there, so many Points doth the Lizard bear to the East∣wards of the North, from the Maderas, which is here two points and almost a quarter. The same will be done from a Corner farther from the Scale, and this is evident; for by the Flower de luys you see that S L is a North line from S, and a line drawn from S to F is parallel to B A, or runs upon the same point to the Eastwards of the North from S. Therefore whatsoever line S F is, the same is B A, the like is to be understood of any other example, as, suppose we had not found the bearing of the Lizard from the Maderas, and would find the bearing of the Maderas from the Lizard. Because my Scale runs no farther than B, I cannot use the Corner at S (which is nearest) and the rest are upon the graduated Meridian, therefore I will use the Corner at L, as I did the Corner at S; but because it is the contrary thing, I'll run the contrary way, namely from L to H, then is L H and F S parallel, and because S L is the Meridian to them both, therefore are H S and L F equal, so that if S H be applied to the graduated Square, it is as many points to the Westwards of the South, as L F is to the Eastwards of the North, therefore the Maderas bear from the Lizard South South-west almost a quarter of a point Westerly: if it had been from any other Corner, it would have been the same, the like for any other.
For the Departure from the Meridian between two Places. Suppose X were one Place, and (‖) the other, and I would know the Departure or Difference of Longitude between them. Fix one foot of your Compasses in (‖), and extend the other to sweep the Meridian nearest short of the other place, which is the Meridian V, that Distance apply to the graduated Meridian, and see how much it is, then take the Distance from the other place (which is X) to sweep the nearest part of the same Meridian, and apply that to the graduated Meridian, see how much it is, and add it to the former, and it makes the whole Departure between the two places, X and (‖), convert it into miles or leagues, according as you desire; in most Plats you have a Scale or Leagues, which is necessary for small Distances. For the Difference of Latitude between two Places. The Difference of Latitude between two places is taken af∣ter the same manner from a Parallel, as the Departure is from a Meridian Line; as suppose I would take the Difference of Latitude between X and (‖), first, take the nearest Distance between X and the Parallel that T is in, and see how much it is. Then take the nearest Distance between (‖) and the same Paral∣lel, and see how much it is, and add them together, and that convert into miles or leagues according as you desire. To find what Latitude any place lies in, take the nearest Distance between that Place and the next Parallel with your Compasses, and look where that Parallel cuts the graduated Me∣ridian, and carry your Compasses with that distance there (one foot) and observe to set the other that way as the place is, either to the Northwards or Southwards of that Meridian, and see upon what degree and minute of a degree it falls, and that is the Lati∣tude of the place. As, suppose I would know the Latitude of the North side of the Maderas, I will fix my Compasses, one foot in B, and extend the other to sweep the Parallel that S is in, that Distance I will carry
to the place were the Parallel cuts the graduated Meridian which is at 34, and fixing one foot there, I will see where the other falls to the Southwards towards L (because it is the Southwards of that Parallel) and I find it falls in the Latitude of 32 deg. 30 min. from whence I conclude, that the Northermost part of the Maderas lies in the Latitude of 32 deg. 30 min. The way that the Square E C D is divided into Points, is on this manner: First, I draw the line O C, then the other lines for half-points, and quarter-points, then I describe the Circles, making the outmost come to the innermost of the lines (but whether it be or no is no great matter) the Circles being divided into Points, half-points, and quarters, I lay my Scale by the Center of these Circles, which is O, and the divisions on the Circles, & where my Scale cuts upon the outer line, from thence I draw my Points, half-points, and quarter-points, as you see here in the following Blank; and the Points upon the sides of the Square thus set off are the Tangents of the Points upon the Arch: for when from the outer∣most edge of an Arch a Perpendicular is raised from a side that bounds that Arch (as the side N 4 is,) and the other side that bounds the same Arch be extended without the Arch to intersect it (as the line O C intersects N 4 at 4,) that Perpendicular is the measure of that Arch, either in degrees or points; as here N W is 45 degrees or 4 points, and so is N 4. And thus you may divide a Tangent line for degrees or points, from an Arch divided into degrees or points. To set off any Course from a Place assigned upon a Blank. Let the Place assigned be X, from which I would draw a N W b N line. Take three points from the graduated Square (making D or E the place you take it from) and fix one foot of your Compass in the next convenient Corner to X (which is at M) and set off the three points which fall at K; then from the next Corner upon the same Meridian that M is, (and to the Southwards of it) which is at P, lay your Scale to K, then your Scale lieth N W b N from
P, and a line Parallel to the Scale from X must be a N W b N line, the like for any Course else, observing the quarter of the Compass, it is to be set off in, as also whether it be nearer the East or West than the North or South; for if it be nearer the East or West than the North or South, you must do the same from a Parallel, as here you did from a Meridian; for the side of a Square is but the measure of four points, which is but half the points between a Meridian and a Parallel. This way of work∣ing may seem hard and tedious at first, but you will soon find that it is free from mistakes, and both exact and easie, if you practise it.

Of OBLIQUE TRIANGLES. Two Sides with an Angle opposite to one of them given, to find the other Angles and Side. QUESTION I. Two Ships set sail from the Rock of Lisbon, one sailed W S W, the other sailed N W b W 38 leagues, and at the end of their sailing, they were 58 leagues asunder, I demand the Souther∣most Ships Distance run, and how the Ships bear one from the other? FIrst draw a North and South line white, and then from that set off the Northermost Ships Course, make the Rock or Place setting out the Place in the North and South line that you draw that Course from, which is C, upon this Course set off 38 leagues (because the Question saith you sailed 38 leagues upon it) and extend the side C A to the Arch of 60 deg. at t, and set off five points from t to S, and draw S C a white line, which is W S W Course: (for it is five points between the W S W and the N W b W) this done, take 58 leagues from the Scale of equal parts, and fix one foot of your Compasses in A, and where the other intersects the Course B C (which it doth in B) there is the other Ship, then to measure the Angle of the Ships bearing one from the
other it is B, and B C is an E N E line; extend B A to the Arch of 60 deg. whose Center is at B, and see how many degrees or points it is more Northerly than an E N E line, and so the other Ship (namely, the Ship at A) bears from the Ship at B; depiction of geometrical figure then take the length of B C, and apply it to your Scale, and see how many leagues or miles it is. I have wrought this in leagues, but I will work the rest in miles, because it is more exact. I find that the Ship at A bears from B, N E b N 45 min. Easterly, the Distance run of the Southermost Ship is 70 leagues.
By the Tables. The proportion of this and all others of this kind, is the same that holds in right angled Triangles; namely, that the Sine of every Angle is proportional to its opposite side, or every side is proportional to the Sine of its opposite Angle. Here we have given the side C A 38 Leagues, the side A B 58 Leagues, and the Angle at C which is 5 points or 56 deg. 15 min. Say then for the Angle at B. As A B 58 leagues, 580 tem. comp. arith 7,2365719 Is to A C B 56 deg. 15 min. Sine   9,9198464 So is A C 38 leagues, 380 tem.   2,5797836 To A B C Sine 33 deg. 0 min.   9,7362019 Which subtract from 6 points or 67 d. 30 m.   33 00 Remainder is the Course from North 34 d. 30 m. Which the Ship A bears from the Ship B, which is N E b N 45 min. Easterly. For the Distance run of the Ship at B, the Side B C. As Sine C 56 deg. 15 min. comp. arith 0,080153 Is to A B 58 leagues   2,763428 So is Sine B A C 90 deg. 45 min. Take the Sine of the acute Angle B A t 89 d. 15 m. 9,999961 To B C 68 8/10   2,843542 The reason why you take the acute Angle is, because the Tables go no further than 90 deg. neither indeed is any Sine be∣yond 90 deg. but (as my Father saith in his Trigonometry, p. 2) the Sine of an Arch less than a Quadrant is also the right Sine of an Arch as much greater than a Quadrant: So then the right
Sine of the Arch 90 deg. 45 min. which is 45 min. greater than a Quadrant, must be the right Sine of the Arch 89 deg. 15 min. which is as much less (namely, 45 min.) the Geometrical De∣monstration of it is there laid down. You may ask how I came to know the Angle B A C, which was thus: I found one of the other two Angles, namely B, and the other I had given me, I added them both together, and that Sum I subtracted from 180 deg. the Remainder must then be the Angle at A, because 180 deg. is the Sum of the three Angles of any right lined Triangle: And if I subtract two of them from three of them, there will remain one of them, which was 90 deg. 45 min. The three Angles of a Triangle given, with one of the Sides, to find the other two sides. QUESTION II. Admit I set from a Head-land lying in the Latitude of 50 deg. 00 min. North Latitude, and sail W S W 38 Leagues, and then meet with a Ship that came from a Place which lies S S W from the Head-land. Now this Ship hath Sailed N W. I demand the Distance of that Place from the other, and also the Distance the Ship hath sailed that came from the Southermost Place. FIrst draw your North and South line B s. Let B be the Head-land. From B then draw a W S W line (by describing the Arch of 60 deg. s D from the Center B, and setting it off as hath been shewed) upon this W S W line set off the Ships run 58 miles B O: From O as a Center describe the Arch of 60 deg. R n, and extend the side O B to it: Now because the Question saith that B O is a W S W line from B, then O B must be an E N E line from O. Also because the Question saith, that the Ship that met her sailed N W, the side A O is a N W line from A, which is a S E line from O to A. Now there are 6 points between an E N E and a S E Course: there∣fore from the line D B extended upon the Arch of 60 deg. from B, set off 6 points or 67 deg. 30 min. which is n R, and
draw O R a white line: Then because the Question saith that the place the other Ship set from, bears from the Head-land B S S W. Draw a S S W line from B, which is B A, and where depiction of geometrical figure it cuts the line O R, which is in A, there will be the place the other Ship set from, and A B will be the distance of the Head-land and that asunder, A O will be the distance that the Ship hath sailed that came from it, which I find as followeth. The distance between the two places is A B 58 miles. The distance that the Ship sailed is A O 44 4/10 miles. If you have occasion to find the Latitude the place at A lies in, let fall the Perpendicular A N upon the South line that comes from B, and it cuts it in N, and leaves the Difference of Latitude B N, see how many miles it is, and subtract it from 50 deg. and you have your desire, measure A N, and you have the Westing that A lies from the Head-land B.
By the Tables. Here the Angle at B is an Angle of 4 points or 45 d. 00 m. The Angle at A is an Angle of 6 points or 67 d. 30 m. The Angle at O is an Angle of 6 points or 67 d. 30 m. The side B O is 58 miles.     First for the Side A B. The general Rule saith, That the Sine of every Angle is pro∣portional to its opposite side. Then from this I conclude, that B A should be equal to B O, because the Angles opposite to them are equal, and so you will find them For as Sine A 67 deg. 30 min. comp. arith. 0,034384 Is to O B 58 miles   1,763428 So is Sine O 67 deg. 30 min.   9,965615 To A B 58 miles, the two places distance 1,763428 You see it is so exactly, for these three numbers added toge∣ther, and Radius cast away, produceth the same Logarithm that 58 (taken out of the Book) did, and this Question I do on purpose to shew the truth of the general Rule. The same way other Questions of this nature are wrought. For the Distance that the Southermost Ship sailed, A O. As A O B Sine 67 deg. 30 min. comp. arith. 0,034384 Is to A B 58 miles   2,763428 So is Sine A B O 45 deg. 00 min.   9,849485 To A O 44 4/10 miles   2,647297 If you desire to find the Difference of Latitude between the two places B and A, you have the Distance A B, and the Course A B n given to find it or the Longitude.
If you desire to find the Latitude the Ships are in when they meet, let fall a Perpendicular from O upon the South line (which is B N) and you have the distance O B given, 58 miles, and the Angle O B R 67 deg. 30 min. to find it, or the Departure between the Ships at their meeting, and the Head-land O r. The like is to be understood of any other Question of this nature. Two Sides and their contained Angle being given to find the third Side and the other Angles. QUESTION III. Two Ships set from one Port, and make an Angle of 58 deg. one sailed N b E, and the other sailed N W 1 deg. 45 min. Westerly, the Eastermost Ship sailed 70 miles and came to her Port: The Westermost Ship sailed 89 miles, and came to her Port: I de∣mand the Distance of these Ports asunder, and how they bear one from the other? FIrst draw the North and South line A S. Let A B repre∣sent the Port you set from: Then from A as a Center, describe the Arch of 60 deg. F S D: From S to the East∣wards set off one point: for N b E the Eastermost Ships Course draw the line A D at length, and set the first Ships distance 70 miles upon it, which is A B, then from A draw a N W line 4 deg. 45 min. Westerly, and set off the Wester∣most Ships distance run upon that, which is 89 miles, and it reacheth from A to C, draw the line C B from the ends of the other two sides, which is the Distance between the Ports (for the ends of each Ships run must be the Ports) then is A C B the Angle of the bearing of the Eastermost Port from the Westermost, or A B C the bearing of the Westermost Port from the Eastermost, C A is a S E line, 1 deg. 45 min. Easterly from C, see how many points are contained between the C B and C A, by the way that is shewed in the Question before, or because B A is N b E
line (from B) you may find the Point of the Compass that B C runs upon from B, you need find it but one of these ways, and the opposite point must be the other, as I have shewed before, then take the length of the side C B, which is the distance of the Ports asunder, I find their distance and bearing to be as followeth. depiction of geometrical figure The Distance between the two Ports is C B 79 miles. The Bearing of them is East 5 deg. 35 min. Northerly, or West 5 deg. 35 min. Southerly. By the Tables. Here is given the Angle at A, 58 deg. 00 min. the side A B 70 miles, the side A C 89 miles, which is two sides, and their contained Angle, and here is required A C B or A B C, and the side B C.
First For the Angles. For all Questions of this nature, this Rule is beneficial, and will work your Question. Note, That in all plain Triangles, the Sum of two Sides are in such pro∣portion to their Difference, as the Tangent of the half Sum of their opposite Angles, is to the Tangent of an Angle, which Angle shall be the Difference between the half Sum, and the Angles: so that if it be added to the half Sum, it shall make the greater Angle; if it be subtracted, it shall make the lesser. I have said something of this Rule before, which makes me demonstrate it no farther here. Proportion. As the Sum of A B and A C 159 miles comp. arith. 6,79860 Is to their Difference 19 miles   2,27875 So is the Tan. of the half Sum of B and C 61 d. om. 10,25624 To Tangent of an Angle 12 10 9,33359 This added to the half Sum makes the Angle at B 73 d. 10 m. subtracted, it makes the Angle at C 48 deg. 50 min. which is 4 points, and 3 deg. 50 min. then say I, if C A be a S E Course, 1 deg. 45 min. Easterly from C, 'tis certain that C B must be 4 points and 38 deg. 50 min. from it, which is East 5 deg. 35 min. Northerly, the bearing of the Eastermost Port from the West∣ermost. To find the half Sum of the Angles, Note that the three Angles are 180 d. therefore if one of them be known, subtract that from 180 d. and the Remainder must be the other two. Now for their Distance asunder, C B. As Sine A C B 48 deg. 50 min. comp. arith. 0,123321 Is to B A 70 mil.   2,845098 So is Sine B A C 58 deg. co min.   9,928420 To the Distance of the Ports asunder C B 78 9/10 2,896839
The three Sides of a Triangle given, to find the Angles. QUESTION IV. Two Ships set from one Place, one sails N b E 70 miles, the other sails between the North and the West 89 miles, and at the end of their sailing they are distant asunder 78 miles 9/10 of a mile, I demand what Course the Westermost Ship sailed, and how the two Ships bear one from the other? FIrst draw the North and South line A e, make A the place of the Ships setting out, set off a N b E Course upon the Arch of 60 deg. I e, which is e D (because the Eastermost Ship sails N b E) likewise set off her Distance which she sailed upon that Course, which is A B 70 miles, then take the other Ships depiction of geometrical figure
Distance, which is 89 miles, and fixing one foot of your Com∣passes in A, with the other describe the Arch at C: Lastly, take the Distance of the two Ships asunder 78 miles 9/10, and fixing one foot of your Compasses in B, cross that Arch, and from the place of intersection draw the sides of the Triangle C A and C B: then measure the Angles from an Arch of 60 deg. as hath been shewed before; and to know them, consider that A B is a N b E line, so that A F will be upon a Course so many points, or degrees, and minutes from a N b E, as there are points, or degrees and minutes in the Arch D F. Secondly, for the bearing of the Ships, which is the Angle at B: consider that B A is a S b W line from B, and then the degrees and minutes, or points contained in the Arch O R, is so many degrees and minutes, or points from the S b W. I have resolved the Demands, which are as followeth. The Course that the Westermost Ship steered was N W 2 d. Westerly. The bearing of the Eastermost Ship from the Westermost is W b S 5 deg. 30 min. West. I set the Angles by the plain Scale a little differing, because the Scale cannot be guessed to a minute, or 2 or 5, nor the miles to a single tenth. By Proportion. Here the three sides are given us to find the Angles; the side A B is 70 miles, the side B C is 78 9/10 miles, the side C A is 89 miles. A General Rule in Oblique Triangles. As the true Base Is to the Sum of the other two sides: So is the Difference of the sides To the alternate Base.
You may make which side you will the true Base. If you make either of the shortest sides the true Base, and let fall a Perpendicular from the Angle opposite to it, the side must be extended in some cases, for the Perpendicular will fall without the Triangle, and the extent of the alternate Base will fall as far without the Perpendicular, as the Perpendicular is without the length of the true Base: but if you make the longest side the true Base, the Perpendicular will fall within the Triangle in any Question whatsoever, so that you will have no occa∣sion to extend the side, which makes me use the longest side for the true Base, though in this Question take any side and it would fall within. Here the side C A is longest, and therefore we will make that the true Base: take the length of the shortest side, which is A B, and fixing one foot of your Compasses in B, (the Angle opposite to the true Base) cut the true Base with that side B A in the point S, then draw the line S B which is equal to A B, the Perpendicular N B will fall in the middle between S and A, (which is in the point N) then shall S N, and N A be equal C S is the alternate Base: say, As C A the true Base 89 miles comp. arith 7,0506699 Is to C B and A B 148 9/10 miles   3,1728947 So is their Difference 8 9/10 miles   1,9493900 To the alternate Base S C 14 9/10 miles 2,1728946 Subtract S C the alternate Base thus found 14 9/10 89 74 1/10 37 ½ tenth From C A the true Base 89 miles And the Remainder is S A 74 1/10 miles The half of which is N A 37 miles or N A being thus found, I have A B besides it in the right-angled Triangle A N B to find the Angle at A:
Say then, As A B 70 miles comp. arith 7,154901 Is to Radius     So is A N 37 miles   2,568201 To Sine comp. N B A 58 deg. 6 min. 9,723102 Which is Sine B A C, or the quantity of the Arch D F. Consider then what Course the side A B runs upon, and 58 deg. 6 min. from that Course is the Course that the side A C runs upon. Example. A B runs upon a N b E Course from A: the side A C runs upon a Course 58 deg. 6 min. from it to the Northwards, and so to the Westwards, 58 deg. 6 min. is 5 points and 1 deg. 49 min. which is N W 1 deg. 45 min. Westerly. What this is above a Northwest 1 deg. 45 min. Westerly, is by the neglect of taking the absolute Logarithm answering to 2,1728946; and also the neglect of the half tenth in dividing: you see it is but 6 min. of a degree of the Compass from the other, in the Question before this, which is no sensible error in sailing, and indeed I neglect working so near, to let any Learner see what a necessary thing it is to be exact: the Angle at A being thus found, you may find the other An∣gles at pleasure, and also know what point the side B C runs upon, because you know what point B A runs upon from B. For the Angle C B A. As C B 78 9/10 miles comp. arith. 7,102922 To Sine B A C 58 d. 6 m.   9,928893 So is C A 89 miles   2,949390 To Sine C B A 73 d. 16 m.   9,981205
That is 6 points, and 5 deg. 46 min. more; then is B C a line that runs from B, W b S 5 deg. 46 min. Westerly, or the Ship at C bears from the Ship at B, W b S 5 deg. 46 min. Westerly. Then must B bear from C, E b N 5 deg. 46 min. Easterly; and thus your desire is known. But you may think much, that a Fraction should put you out so much as 6 min. (and if you know no better) you may be afraid it will cause some difference in the sides; but if you examine this Example, you will find the sides will not differ for this a full tenth of a mile. Example. By the Angles to find the sides to agree with the sides in the other Question, within a tenth part of a mile. As Sine B A C 58 deg. 6 min. comp. arith. 0,07110 To C B 78 9/10   2,89707 So is Sine A B C 73 deg. 16 min.   9,98120 To C A 89 0/10 miles   2,94938 Here it is evident, that all this Difference doth not alter the sides the tenth part of a mile. If you desire to see farther proof of the Rule, by which this Question is wrought, you have a clear Geometrical Demon∣stration for it in page 19 and 20 of my Fathers first Book of Trigonometry, which makes me forbear the demonstrating of it by any Geometrical way.
QUESTION V. Admit I be sailing along the Shore, and see two Headlands, the Eastermost bears N N E off me, the Westermost bears N W from me, at the same time I see an Island that bears South from me; but I sail West 8 miles, and find the Eastermost Head-land to bear N E b E 5 deg. Easterly from me, the Westermost N N E, and the Island E S E: I demand how these Places bear one from the other, and their Distance asunder? SUch Questions as these are used in situating of places that are in sight one of the other; or, as a man sails by a land, he may take the Headlands bearing one from the other, and also the Imbays as well as the Head-lands, if he be not too far out. This Question is wrought as the second Question, for here you have the bearing of the places you note in both Sta∣tions, and also the Course that you steer from one Station to the other, with the Distance; which is two Angles and a Side, to find the other two Sides, which is your Distance at each Station from the places. For the protracting of this Question; from your first Sta∣tion draw a line upon those several Courses, as the Question saith the places bear; As, suppose the first Station be A, from A draw A I a N N E line, and (mind) that line must be cut upon the Eastermost Head-land, because the Question saith it bears so. Next draw a N W line from A, which is A C, and cuts the the Westermost Head-land. Lastly, draw out a South line from A, which is A D, and cuts the Island. Then from A draw an East line (for the Course you steered) and set off 8 miles upon it, which is A R, from R draw a line to every place, as the Question saith they bear; Then (namely) from R to the Eastermost Head-land, draw
a N E b E line 5 deg. Easterly: from R to the Westermost Head-land draw a N N E line, and from R to the Island an E S E Course. Now because the lines drawn from each Station cut the Head-lands and Island; it is evident that the depiction of geometrical figure
Point of their intersecting one another must be the places, (thus) A I and R I are the lines drawn upon the Course that lead from the Stations to the Eastermost Head-land, and cut in I, then is I the Headland. A O and R O are the Courses that lead to the Westermost Head-land from both Stations, and intersect in O, therefore O is the Westermost Head-land. Lastly, A s and R s are the Courses that lead from the two Stations to the Island; and therefore s is the Island, for there they cut. Draw a line from every one of them as from s to O, and from O to I, from I to s, and take the distance of them asunder; then for their bearing one from another, draw a North and South line from each place, and by an Arch of 60 deg. measure it, as hath been shewed. By the Tables First, I consider that I have the Distance between the two Stations, R A (which is a side of the triangles A R I, A R O, and A R s) and in every of these Triangles, the Question gives me all the Angles, so that I can find my Di∣stance from my Station to the Head-lands, after the form of this Example, which I shall do from each Station to the Eastermost. For A I. As Sine R I A 38 deg. 45 min. comp. arith. 0,20347 To A R 8 miles   1,90309 So is Sine A R I 28 deg. 45 min.   9,68213 To A I 6 miles 2/10   1,78869
For R I. As R I A Sine 38 deg. 45 min. comp. arith. 0,20347 To A R 8 miles   1,90309 So is R A I Sine (its comp. to 180 d.) 67 d. 30 m. 9,96561 To R I 11 miles 8/10   2,07217 Here I have found the Distance from each Station to the Eastermost Head-land, next find the distance from the Wester∣most Head-land to the first Station A O. For A O. As Sine R O A 6 points or 67 d. 30 m. co. ar. 0,034384 Is to R A 8 miles   1,903090 So is O R A 67 deg. 30 min. Sine   9,965615 To A O 8 miles   1,903090 Thus you might find R O, R s, and A s, for you have the same things given, namely, R A and the Angles: Here we have found the sides A I and A O, and because A I is upon a N N E Course, and A O upon a N W Course, the Angles contained between O A I must be 6 points or 67 deg. 30 min. so that we have two sides and their contained Angle, to find the Angles of the bearing of these Head-lands A I O or A O I, and the Distance of them asunder O I: this is wrought as the third Question is. Thus, as this is found, so you may find the bearing of the rest of the places one from the other, if there were twenty of them, for you have as much given in the other Triangles; but I leave it to your own practice also to make such Experiments, or to frame such Questions.
Two Sides and a contained Angle being given, to find the third Side and the Course (that each Side runs upon) pro∣vided that no Course be named, only the half of the Compass that you sail in (or the quarter which is most commonly) and the Difference of Latitude that is made between the extent of the two Sides. QUESTION VI. Two Ships make an Angle of 50 deg. the one sails between the South and the West 40 leagues, the other sails between the South and the East 50 leagues, and at the end of their sailing, the Eastermost Ship is more Southerly than the Westermost, so that they differ their Latitude 15 leagues; I demand each Ships Course, and their Distance asunder. THe place the Ship set from, I make to be B, take off 60 deg. from your Scale, and describe an Arch, making B your Center, as the Arch T R: then I take 50 deg. from my Scale, and set off somewhere upon that Arch, namely, from T to R, and from B, upon the Course that leads to T, I set off 40 leagues, my Westermost Ships Distance, and so conclude my Westermost Ship is at C: then from B upon the Course that leads to R, I set off my my Eastermost Ships Di∣stance run, which is 50 leagues from B to A. Lastly, draw A C, which is the Distance of the Ships at the end of their sailing. Then because the Question saith the Eastermost Ship was 15 leagues more Southerly in Latitude, than the Westermost; I will take 15 leagues from the Scale of equal parts, and fix one foot of my Compasses in A, and with the other describe the Arch I S N, and draw the line from C, by the upper edge of the Circle at length, which must be an East and West line, because A is just 15 leagues to the Southwards of the nearest part of it: then let fall a Perpendicular from B upon C N, and extend it as far as the Arch of 60 deg. which you first de¦scribed
T R, and it cuts in O, this must be a South line from B, namely B S; then measure upon the Arch of 60 deg. from O to R, for the Eastermost Ships Course, and from O to T for the Westermost Ships Course, as you do in any other Question. I find them here as followeth, The Eastermost Ship sailed S b E 4. d. 40 m. Easterly. The Westermost Ship sailed S W 11 deg. Southerly. The Distance asunder is C A 39 leagues. depiction of geometrical figure By Proportion. Here are the two sides B A 50 leagues, and B C 40, with the contained Angle C B A given, to find the Angles A C B and B A C; therefore for the Angles,
As B A and B C 90 leagues comp. arith. 7,045757 Is to their Difference 10 leagues   2,000000 So is Tan. half the Angles B A C and B C A 65 d. 0 m. 10,331327 To Tang. their Difference 13 deg. 24 min. 9,377084 Which added to the half sum 65 deg. is 78 deg. 24 min. the Angle A C B, subtracted from 65 deg. it makes 51 deg. 36 min. the Angle C A B. Then for the Ships Distance asunder, C A. As Sine A C B 78 deg. 24 min. comp. arith. 0,008962 Is to B A 50 leagues   2,698970 So is Sine C B A 50 deg. 0 min.   9,884254 To C A 39 deg. 1/10 leagues.   2,592186 Here we have found the required Angles, and the required side, but we know not what point of the Compass either of the sides that bounds the Triangles runs upon: but this which we have found makes way to it, for now we know the side A C to be 39 1/10 leagues; and if you let fall a Perpendicular from A, upon the East and West line C N, it cuts it in S, then A S is known to be the Semidiameter of the Arch I N S u 15 leagues, so that in the Triangle A S C (right angled at S) we have A S 15 leagues given, and A C 39 1/10 leagues, to find A C S or C A S, we will find A C S. As A C 39 1/10 leagues 7,407823 Is to Radius or A S C 90 deg.   So is A S 15 leagues 2,176091 To Sine A C S 22 deg. 34 min. 9,583914 Here it is evident, the place A bears from the place C East 22 deg. 34 min. Southerly, which is E S E 4 minutes Southerly, because C S is an East and West line.
Also, if you subtract A C S 22 deg. 34. min. from A C B 78 deg. 24 min. the remainder will be B C S 55 deg. 50 min. the Angle that the Westermost Ship hath made from a West Course Southerly (for that T C V and B C S are equal) so that I say, the Course that the Westermost Ship hath sailed upon, is S W 10 deg. 50 min. Southerly, or the Course that leads to the place she set from B, is N E 10 deg. 50 min. Nor∣therly. Then for the Eastermost Ships Course, consider that B C is a S W Course 10 deg. 50 min. Southerly, and B A must be to the Southwards, and so to the Eastwards 50 deg. from it (which is 4 points and 5 deg.) that is, S b E 4 deg, 35 min. Easterly. Two Sides of an oblique Triangle being given in one Sum, and the other Side alone, with an Angle opposite to one of the Sides, to find the Sides several, and the other Angles. QUESTION VII. Two Ships set from two several Ports, these Ports were both in one Parallel, and distant 92 miles, the Westermost Ship sails N E b E, the Eastermost Ship sails upon some point between the North and the West, and they both meet, if the Distance run of these Ships together be 159 miles: I demand them several, and the Easter∣most Ships Course. LEt B A be the Parallel line the Ports be in. Let A be the Eastermost Port, B the Westermost, then must A B be 92 miles: from B set off a N E b E line, which is B C O, set off both the Ships runs upon it, which is 159 miles B C: then draw C A, which is the other side of the Triangle B C A, and divide it into two equal parts by a Perpendicular (as you see the Perpendicular D S doth, in the point R) draw this Perpendicu∣lar from one side of the Triangle to the other, as R I; then from I draw a line to A.
Then forasmuch as A R is the half of A C or equal to R C, and I R is a Perpendicular to A C from R, I A and I C must be equal, and if B I C be the length of the two sides 159, B I and I A are equal to them, so that B I is the Distance that the Westermost Ship sailed, and I A is the Eastermost Ships run, measure them, and set them down; also I A B is the Angle from the West toward the North, that the Easter∣most Ship hath steered, I have found them to be as fol∣loweth. The Eastermost Ship sailed North 7 d. 20 m. Westerly. The Westermost Ship's Distance run is 102 miles. The Eastermost Ship sailed 57 miles. depiction of geometrical figure By the Tables. In the Triangle B A C I have the side B C given, 159 miles, the side B A 92 miles, and the contained Angle at B 23 deg. 30 min. whereby I may find the Angle at C, which we will do first.
As the Sum of B A and B C 251 miles comp. arith. 6,600326 Is to their Difference 67 miles 2,816074 So is Tan. half B A C and B C A 73 d. 7 m. 10,517833 To Tan. their Difference 41 d. 20 m. 9,944 Which added to the half Sum, it makes B A C 114 deg. 27 min. the greater Angle: subtracted from the half Sum, it makes B C A 31 deg. 47 min. (which is equal to I A C, for if A I and I C, as also A R and R C be equal (as was proved before) and I R a Perpendicular to R A and R C, of ne∣cessity, the Angles in the Triangles I A R and I C R must be equal. So that then, if from B A C 114 d. 27 m. You subtract I A C equal to B C A 31 47 The Remainder is I A B 82 40 So that because A B is a West line (from A) of necessity A I is a line that runs upon a Course 82 deg. 40 min. to the Northwards of it, which is North 7 deg. 20 min. Westerly. And thus we have the Angles and the side B A of the Tri∣angle B I A to find the sides A I and B I. First then for B I the Eastermost Ship's run. As Sine B I A 63 deg. 35 min. comp. arith. 0,047894 To B A 92 miles   2,963787 So is Sine B A I 82 deg. 40 min.   9,996433 To B I the Eastermost Ship's run 101 9/10 miles 3,008114 If you question how the Angle B I A is known, it is easily resolved; for if B A I be found, A B I was given, add them together, and subtract that from 180 deg. and the remainder must be B I A, because the three Angles of any right lined Triangle is but 180 deg.
Lastly, for I A the Westermost Ships run. As Sine B I A 63 deg. 35 min. comp. arith. 0,047894 To B A 92 miles   2,963787 So is Sine A B I 33 deg. 45 min.   9,744739 To I A the Westermost Ships Distance run 57 d. 1/10 mil. 2,756420 I handled a Question of this nature before, by which you may be directed: for though that be a right angled Triangle, and this an oblique angled Triangle, there is no difference in the demonstration. The three Sides of a Triangle being given in one intire Sum, and the Angles apart, to find the Sides apart. QUESTION VIII. Two Ships set from one place, one sails S W, the other sails S b W, and at the end of their sailing, they arrive at two several Ports; the Westermost of these Ports bears from the Eastermost N W and by N: Now if the Ships Distances which they sail, with the Distance between the Ports be 148 leagues, (which is the three sides of the Triangle) I demand the Distance that each Ship sailed, and how far the Ports are asunder? FOr the resolving of this Question, I will suppose the side that the Westermost Ship sails upon to be 30 leagues, and so imagine you have the three Angles and a Side given, as you have in Quest. 2. We will protract this after the directions there given, it being so laid down: I find by the Plain Scale, that these sides are as followeth: The side C N is given to be 30 leagues. The side N B is found to be 42 leagues. The side C B is found to be 24 leagues.
By the Tables the Proportion is, As Sine B 45 deg. 0,15051 To C N 30 leagues 2,47712 So Sine N 33 d. 45 m. 9,74473 To C B 2 6/10 leagues 2,37236 For N B. As Sine B 45 deg. 0,15051 To C N 30 leagues 2,47712 So Sine C (take its Comp. to 180 d.) 78 d. 45 m. 9,99157 To B N 41 6/10 leagues 2,61921 These sides with the side C N (added together) makes 95 leagues 2/10. Then it stands to good reason, that being the Angles in this Triangle are the same with the Angles in the Question; there∣fore, as the sum of these sides are in proportion to the Sum of the sides there, so is the sum of the side 30 here, to the sum of the side that is correspondent to it there, or runs upon the same Course. To find the Ships Distance that sailed S W, correspondent to C N 30 leagues. As sum of the sides of the Triangle C N B 95 le. co. ar. 7,021363 Is to the sum of the sides in the Quest. 148 leagues 3,170261 So is the side C N 30 leagues 2,477121 To the Ships Distance that sailed S W 46 leagues 6/19 2,668745 Now we have the three Angles of the Triangle and a Side, so that we may lay it down by the Plain Scale, or work it by the Tables, as we wrought here in this Question before: you
might have wrought depiction of geometrical figure this proportion by the Rule of Three as well, or Geometrically, as I have shewed an Ex∣ample of this nature there. This side being thus found, we (to abbre∣viate the work) will lay it down in the Triangle before, whose Angles are equal to to the Angles here: set 46 6/10 leagues, for the length of the side, the Westermost Ships run, which is N R. Draw R s parallel to C B, and extend N B till it intersect R s, which it doth in s. This is as much as protracting of it anew, for the Angles at R, at s, and at N, are the same that they were given to be in the Question, and the side R N 47 leagues, as it was found. You may measure the sides unknown by the Plain Scale, and set them down if you will, or you may work by the Rule of Three, using this Proportion. As N C 30 leagues is to N R 46 6/10 leag. So is N B 41 6/10 to N S. Multiply and divide, and it maketh 64 6/10 leagues, 14/57 of a Tenth.
By the Tables for N s. As N C 30 leagues comp. arith. 7,52287 To N R 46 6/10 leagues   2,66839 So is N B 41 6/10   2,61909 To N s. 64 6/10 leagues   2,81035 We might have done this by the Tables, putting the Angles and Sides in proportion, as we have done all along in the other Triangles. But I suppose your own reason will give you, that this hath the same given in it that the Angle C N B had; and is wrought so. The Fractions here, and the other agree, only this is not so true altogether, because here we do it but to tenths, there in smaller Fractions, but this is within a small part of one tenth of a unite. For the Side R s. As Sine N s R 45 deg. 00 min. comp. arith. 0,15051 Is to R N 46 leagues 6/10   2,66839 So is Sine N 33 deg. 45 min.   9,74473 To R s. 36 6/10 leagues   2,56363 If you add the sides now found all together, it will come to 2/10 of a unite less than the given sides together, in the Question is; now that ariseth by neglecting the taking of the absolute number, answering to the Logarithm that comes out; but this is sufficient in cases of this kind. If you had set it in paces, and wrought to the tenth part, you would have been out but 2/10 of a pace, therefore use your mind in such cases. If you had wrought to Centisms, you would have been nearer: but this I count near enough for sailing, and I am sure is more proper to be used, than such small Fractions, because no long distances can be guessed to a mile or a league. You might have wrought your last propor∣tion by the Rule of Three, as you did the other.
Three Sides of a Triangle given, to find the Center. QUESTION IX. There be three Ships bound to one place, the Eastermost is distant from the middlemost 40 leagues, and bears S E b E, the middle∣most is distant from the Westermost 50 leagues, and bears N E; now they every one know as much as I have writ, they also know they are of a like distance from this Port. I desire to know what distance the Port is from them, and how it bears from each Ship? I Have applied this Question to sailing here, but before in this Book I have used it in a thing which is very proper for it; and indeed it may be of use many times, which makes me give it place here. I shall say nothing of this Question by the Plain Scale, for it is done, as before you see: but we will do it by the Tables of Tangents and Logarithms. Here I have given the side M er 40 leagues, the side M W 50 leagues, and the Angle at M, namely, its Complement to 180 deg. R M er 78 deg. 45 min. to find the Angles M er W and M W er: As W M add M er 90 leagues comp. arith. 7,04575 Is to their Difference 10 leagues   2, So is the Tan. of ½ M er W and M W er 39 d. 22 m. 9,91404 To Tan. of their Difference 5 deg. 12 min. 8,95980 Subtracted from 39 deg. 22 min. and the Remainder is M W er 34 deg. 50 min. added to it makes M er W 44 deg. 34 min. For the Side er W. As Sine M er W 44 deg. 34 min. comp. arith. 0,153824 To W M 50 leagues   2,698970 So is Sine R M er 78 d. 45 m. its comp. log. 180 d. 9,991573 To W er 69 9/10 leagues   2,844367
But now you will demand of me, how we shall find any thing in the Triangle W F er, being there is but one thing known in it, namely, the Distance of the Eastermost Ship from the West∣ermost er W, I'll tell you. depiction of geometrical figure Mr. Euclid proves this, which makes me forbear it.Mr. Euclid (Book 3. Prop. 20.) saith, That in a Circle an Angle at the Center is double to an Angle at the Circumference, (provided) that both the Angles have to their Base one and the same part of the Circumference. The Center is F here, the Triangle W F er and W M er have W er to both their Bases: then must B F A be double to I M O, or C B A double to D M I (that is to the Arch I O D) so that if you double D O I, 101 deg.
15 min. it makes C B A 202 deg. 30 min. that subtracted from a Circle 360 deg. leaves the Triangle W F er: It is evident then that W F er is double to R M I because R M I is what I O D wants of a Semicircle, as W F er is what C B A wants of a whole Circle, which is double to it. Example.   deg. min. W M er is 101 deg. 30 min. doubled it is C B A 202 30 That subtracted from a Circle 360 00 The Remainder is W F er 157 30 And this subtracted from 180 00 The Remainder is F W er and F er W (for the Angles of a right angled Triangle are 180 d.) 22 30 The half of which is F W er or F er W 11 15 For they must be equal, because the sides opposite to them are equal, namely, F er and F W. And thus we have the three Angles of the Triangle W F er, and the side W er to find F er or F W or F M, the distance of any of the Ships from the Port. For the Distance of the Ships from the Port. As Sine W F er 22 deg. 30 min. comp. arith 0,417160 Is to W er 69 9/10 leagues   2,844477 So is Sine F W er 11 deg. 15 min.   9,290235 To any of the Ships Distances from the Port which I find to be 35 6/10 leagues 2,551872 I need not count the Triangle (for the points) for I have shewed that sufficiently: So that you, I suppose, can tell how to find the Ships bearing from the Port, for it differs nothing from the way you count in other Questions.
QUESTION X. There was two Ships set from one Port, one sailed N W b N 6 leagues a watch, the other sailed N E 8 leagues a watch, these Ships arrived at two several Ports in one instant of time, the Ports were 12 leagues asunder: I demand the Distance run of each Ship, and the Ports bearing one from the other? FOr the doing of this Question, First draw a N W b N line, and set off 6 leagues upon it which is A I; then draw a N E line, and set 8 leagues off upon it, which is A D; draw the side I D, then consider that as A I is to A D, so is the West∣ermost Ships run to the Eastermost; so that the sides A D and A I extended so far that a line of 12 leagues long, drawn parallel to D I, will just touch the extended sides which must cut them in the places were the Ports are, namely, A B in B, and A I in C: measure the sides C A and A B, and also the Angles of the Ports bearing A B C, or A C B and count them as hath been shewed before. depiction of geometrical figure
I find the side A B the Eastermost Ships run to be 10 leag. 7/10. I find A C the Westermost Ships run to be 8 leagues. The Westermost port bears from the Eastermost West, 4 deg. 14 min. Southerly. By the Tables. First for the Ports bearing one from the other A D I equal to A B C, or A I D equal to A C B: they are equal, because I D and C B are parallel, and I A D is an Angle opposite to them both. As A D and A I 14 leagues comp. arith. 6,853871 Is to their Difference 2 leagues   2,301030 So is Tan. ½ A I D and A D I 50 deg. 37 min. 30 sec. 10,085698 To Tan. their Diff. 9 deg. 51 min.   9,240599 Which added to the half Sum is A I D 60 deg. 28 min. A C B equal to A D I or A B C the bearing, subtracted from the half sum is 40 deg. 46 min. For I D. As Sine D 40 deg. 46 min. 0,185100 To I A 6 leagues 0,778151 So is Sine I A D 78 deg. 45 min. 9,991573 To D I 9 Leagues 0,954824 For C A. As I D 9 leag. co. ar. 8,04575 Is to C B 12 leagues 2,07918 So is I A 6 leagues 1,77815 To A C 8 leagues 1,90309 For A B. As I D 9 leag. co. ar. 8,04575 Is to C B 12 leagues 2,07928 So is A D 8 leagues 1,90309 To A B 10 7/10 leagues. 2,02802 The reason that the proportion stands thus, is because the Angles are equal in each Triangle, and therefore the sides must be proportional.
Thus the Eastermost Ship sailed 10 7/10 leagues, the Wester∣most 8 leagues, and the Eastermost Port bears from the Wester∣most East 4 deg. 14 min. Northerly. There is no Distance that a man sails, but if he returns the same way that he went out, he shall find the same Distance back∣wards as he did out. But now, the World is round, and if a man goeth out one way, and returns another (as it is common) he will find a great deal of difference in long runs. For to demonstrate the reason of this I shall not, because my Father and others have done that sufficiently, besides, it would take up too much room in this little Book. These Questions of Sailing may be understood in such cases as this is, namely, when a man sails the same way home as he doth out: But because the Winds will not suffer a man to do so, it is necessary to know some better way to sail by. Let a man return never so contrary to what he sailed outwards, yet at all times to know how near or how far he may be off. Now there is no way better than Mercator's way of Sailing, it is very excellent, and hath been treated of by many, and that makes me presume to think that I may treat of it as well as others. And first here are the Tables of Meridional Parts, by which you are to work.

A Declaration of the Table of MERIDIONAL PARTS. THese Tables are in my Fathers Works to every six mi∣nutes, but here to every three minutes; so that if a man light not upon the very number that he desireth, he may the easier take it, for it will be but one third or two thirds of the Difference between the two nearest to be added or subtracted; I suppose it will be the less troublesom; I have gone no farther than sixty degrees, because I would not take up too much room, and I suppose there is but little Trading to the Northwards of that Latitude, so that it would have been sel∣dom in use, These Tables were calculated by my Fathers Tables. He that sails according to Mercator's Projection, notes the true Quantity of Longitude in degrees and minutes, namely, such degrees as in that Parallel, 360 makes the Circumference. But they which sail by Plano, measure the Sea, which is round, as though it were a flat or plain, now it stands to reason that there must be great Difference: as thus, All North and South Courses (which we call Meridians) intersect in the Poles: Now suppose there be two Ships under the Aequinoctial, 5 degrees or 100 leagues asunder, and these Ships sail both North, they will meet in the North Pole of the World, but by Plane they count them as far off there, as they were at first, for all North and South Lines are parallel one to another, as you may see in the Work all along. Illustration. All Meridian Lines (as I said before) cut through the Poles of the World, and all Parallel Lines go round about the Poles, continuing the same distance from them. The Aequinoctial is one of these Parallel Lines, drawn equally distant from the Poles, and so is upon the body of the Earth; and there a degree of Longitude is 60 miles, and 360 times 60 miles is the Circum∣ference of the Earth, which is 360 degrees.
But now if there be a drawn Parallel, 50 degrees nearer to one of the Poles, our own reason will give that that Circle will not contain so many miles round as the other did, be∣cause it must be less; yet he that sails by Plano counts that it doth, and though he hath Winds that carry him no better than due North from the Aequinoctial to the Parallel or La∣titude of 50 degrees, he counts he hath as many Leagues from the Meridian of the Place he is bound to, as he had when he was under the Aequinoctial. Now tell me how it is possible, (if Meridians intersect in the Poles, as they do) that these Meridians should be as far asunder upon a Parallel of 50 de∣grees nearer the Poles, as they were under the Aequinoctial: I hope you understand me. It is the work of Mrcator to shew (therefore) the Quan∣tity of a degree of Longitude in every Latitude, (for in these Parallels there is 30 degrees in the Circumference, but these degrees cannot contain so many miles as they do nearer the Aequator) It sheweth how you may sail upon any Course from one Latitude to another, and reckon your Longitude according to the truth of it in degrees and minutes: So that having two things given besides the right Angle, you may find your desire at Sea according to Mercator's Direction, which is the surest way of Sailing that I know, except Sailing by the Arch of a great Circle, and that and this will agree in degrees of Longitude, but that sheweth the nearest way to sail from place to place, which is all that it differs from this, (they being both true) this sheweth a general way of sailing from place to place, that a particular way of sailing the nearest way from place to place: It is but seldom used, because it is not very commonly known, but it is an excellent thing, I thought to have touched it, but I considered that my Father hath demonstrated it as evidently as can be. For Mercator use the Tables here inserted.
The Ʋse of the foregoing Tables of Meridional Parts. When you work this way, find first what Latitude you are in (if you cannot observe) do it by the things given that 24 hours: Then take notice what Latitude you were in the day before, and look in the Tables what answers to each Latitude, (setting them down) subtract the lesser from the greater, and the remainder are the Meridional Parts contain∣ed between the two Latitudes, which number make for the length of the side, which contains the Difference of Latitude, and so work according to the Directions following: I will be brief. Example. To find the Meridional Parts answering to any Latitude. Let the one Latitude be 50 deg. 9′ in the Tables 3488 3274 214 answers it. Let the other Lat. be 47 deg. 48′ in the Tables answers it. Subtract the lesser from the greater, and the Remainder is the Me∣ridional Parts contained in that Difference of Latitude. The same is to be understood of any Latitude else. QUESTION I. The Latitude of two Places being given, and the Rumb, to find the Distance and Difference of Longitude. SUppose I set sail from a Place in the Latitude of 39 deg. 12 min. North Latitude, and am bound to a Place in the Latitude of 13 deg. 12 min. North Latitude, which bears S W by W from the other; I demand the Distance between those Places, and Difference of Longitude. Let A represent the Northermost place, C the Southermost, then is A and B the Latitudes of each place, C B the Difference of Longitude, B A C is the Course from the Northermost to the Southermost place.
For the Distance between the Places A C. As Sine comp. A 56 deg. 15 min. comp. arith 0,25526 To A B the Difference of Latitude in miles 1560 3,19312 So is Radius   To the Distance between them C A 2808 miles 3,44838 For the Difference of Longitude. The Meridional parts answering to 39 deg. 12 min. are 2560 The Meridional parts answering to 13 deg. 12 min. are 0799 The Meridional parts contained between the two Lat. 1761 depiction of geometrical figure As Radius   To B A 1761 parts 3,245759 So is Tan. the Rumb A 56 deg. 15 min. 10,175107 To C B the Diff. of Longitude in minutes 2635 m. 3,420866 The Quotient is the number of degrees and the Remainder is the number of minutes contained in the Difference of Longitude 43 deg. 55 min.
QUESTION II. Course and Distance run, with one Latitude given, to find the other Latitude, and the Difference of Longitude. SUppose I set from the Latitude of 49 deg. 9 min. North, and sail S W b W 2808 miles. I demand the Latitude I shall then be in, and the Difference of Longitude. Let A be the Latitude of 49 deg. 9 min. let A C be the Distance run 2808 miles, then is A B the Difference of Latitude, and C B the Difference of Longitude. For the Difference of Latitude A B. To A B 1560 miles Which being divided by 60 The Quotient and the Remainder is the Difference of Lati∣tude in degrees and minutes, which is 26 d. 0 m. That subtracted from 49 d. 9 m. Leaves the Latitude you are now in 23 d. 9 m. The reason why there is no inequality between degrees of Latitude, is because all Meridians are great Circles, so that 60 miles is a degree of them always. For the Difference of Longitude. The Meridional parts contained between these two Latitudes I find to be 3396 1428 1968 pts. As Radius   To A B in parts 1968 3,294025 So is Tang. A the Rumb 56 deg. 15 min. 10,175107 To the Difference of Longitude 2945 m. 3,469133
Now you may ask a reason why this Difference of Longitude should differ from the other in the last Question, seeing the Difference of Latitude, Course and Distance in each Question are alike: the reason is, because this Question runs between two less parallels than the other did, and therefore the same things must give a greater part of this Parallel than it did of the other, though the number of miles of Departure be alike. Divvide 2945 min. by 60, and you have the Difference of Lon∣gitude in degrees and minutes 49 deg. 5 min. QUESTION III. The Latitudes of two places, and the Distance between them given, to find the Course and Difference of Longitude. LEt one place (namely A) be in the Latitude of 49 deg. 9 min. North, let the other place (namely C) be in the Latitude of 23 deg. 0 min. North, and let the Course be between the South and the East, the Distance between them is A C 2808 miles. depiction of geometrical figure For the Course A. As A C Dist. 2808 mil. 6,551602 Is to Radius   So is the Diff. of Lat. A B reduced into miles, 1560 miles 3,193124 To the Sine C, whose Comp. is A 9,744726 Which is 56 deg. 15 min. to the Eastwards of the South. For the Difference of Longitude B C. As Radius   To B A in parts 1968 3,294025 So is Tangent the Course A 56 deg. 15 min. 10,175107 To the Difference of Longitude in minutes 2945 3,469133 Which is as it was in the last Question 49 deg. 5 min.
QUESTION IV. The Latitude of two places, and their Difference of Longitude given, to find the Course and Distance, provided the Course be between the North and the West. LEt the Latitudes be as before, and the Difference of Lon∣gitude 49 deg. 5 min. or 2945 parts or minutes. For the Course. As the Diff. of Latitude in parts A B 1968 co. ar. 6,70597 Is to Radius   So is the Diff. of Longitude in minutes or parts B C 2945 3,46908 To the Tangent of the Course, A 56 deg. 15 min. 10,17505 To the Westwards of the North. As Sine C 33 deg. 45 min. comp. arith. 0,25526 To the Difference of Latitude in miles A B 1560 3,19312 So is Radius   To the Distance run C A 2808 miles 3,44839 depiction of geometrical figure
QUESTION V. The Difference of Longitude, Course, and one Latitude given, to find the other Latitude and the Distance in the Triangle CBA. LEt C B be the Difference of Longitude 49 deg. 5 min. or 2945 min. A the Latitude of 23 deg. 9 min. North Lati∣tude, C A B the Angle of the Course North-westerly 56 deg. 15 min. let it be required to find A B the Difference of Latitude, (which added to the Latitude of A 23 deg. 9 min. will be the Latitude of the other place B) and A C the Distance between them. Here you must find your Difference of Latitude in parts first, which will be reduced into miles (after the Latitude of the place at B is found) and then find your Distance 49 deg. 5 min. re∣duced into minutes (as I said in the Question) is 2945 min. the Difference of Longitude given. For the Difference of Latitude in parts. As Radius   To the Difference of Longitude in parts 2945 parts 3,469085 So is Tan. comp. the Course A 56 deg. 15 min. 9,824897 To the Difference of Latitude in parts, 1968 parts 3,293977 This done I look in the Tables against the Latitude that is given me 23 deg. 9 min. and the Meridional part answering to it, is 1428 To which I add the parts here found, 1968 because the Latitude is increased,   And there comes forth 3396 I look for that in the Tables, and I find answering to it the Latitude of 49 deg. 9 min. which is the Latitude of the unknown place B.
For the Distance between these Places. I subtract the Latitude of A 23 deg. 9 min. from the Latitude of B (now found) 49 deg. 9 min. and the Remainder is the Dif∣ference of Latitude between them, 26 deg. 0 min. which con∣verted into miles is 1560 miles: then say, As Sine comp. 56 deg. 15 min. A comp. arith. 0,255260 Is to A B 1560 miles 3,193124 So is Radius   To the Distance run A C 2808 miles 3,448384 I had thoughts to have shewed the Difference between Plano and Mercator, in an Example, but my Father hath done it in page 170 of his Book. If you are desirous to know Great Circle Sailing, you may learn it from his Book, for he hath treated of it largely; and indeed it is the most necessary way of Sailing that is, for a man cuts his way much shorter (in many runs) than the usual way that men go, doth: If you desire to know in any Latitude the number of miles contained in any number of degrees of Longitude, convert your degrees and minutes of Longitude into minutes, and say, As Radius To Sine comp. that Latitude; So is the Difference of Longitude in minutes To the Difference of Longitude in miles. If you desire to convert miles of Departure (in any Parallel) into degrees, say, As Sine comp. the Latitude or the Parallels dist. from the Pole Is to Radius; So is the Departure in miles To the Difference of Longitude in minutes. Divide that by 60, and the Quotient with the Remainder is the degrees and minutes contained in that Departure.
Of the Longitude and Latitude of Places. BEfore I come to shew how to keep a Reckoning by Merca∣tor's way, I will set down a Catalogue of the Latitude and Longitude of some Places in degrees and minutes, the Longitude taken from Floures and Corves.

Concerning the foregoing Tables. HE that is bound to any place, the first thing that he ought to consider is the Latitude of each place, and the Diffe∣rence of Longitude between them, which things may be ta∣ken from such a Catalogue as this is, after the manner fol∣lowing. Suppose I were bound from the Lizard to Barbadoes, I look in the Column of Latitude against the Lizard, and find 50 deg. 0 min. for its Latitude, and 25 deg. 20 min. for its Longitude, from Floures and Corves. I look in the Column of Latitude against Barbadoes, and find 13 deg. 12 min. for its Latitude, and 327 deg. 42 min. for its Longitude from Floures and Corves. Here you have the Latitude of each place; but to find the Difference of Longitude between these places, I consider that Barbadoes hath 327 deg. 42 min. of East Longitude from these Islands; but if I subtract that from 360 deg. (the whole Circum∣ference) there must remain the West Longitude that is between them, which I find to be 32 d 18 m. Circumf. 360 00 East Long. 327 42   32 18 To it add the longitude between the Lizard and Floures and Corves 25 d. 20 m. That Sum is 57 d. 38 m. The Difference of Longitude between the Lizard and Barba∣does (the Meridian of Barbadoes being to the Westwards of the Lizard so many degrees.) And thus any Difference of Longitude between two places is taken; provided, that one of them is nearer than 19 deg. to the Westwards of the place you begin your Longitude from, and the other nearer than 90 deg. to the Eastwards. And the reason of this is, because the Longitude of all places is set down from Floures and Corves to the Eastwards; so that if a place were but 1 deg. to the Westwards of Floures and Corves, it would be set down in the Catalogue to lie in the 359 deg. of Longitude.
For to know the Difference of Longitude between any two places, consider which way they are nearest, and that take: Suppose there were two places, one lieth in 20 deg. 0 min. of Longitude, the other lieth in 195 deg. of Longitude: I con∣sider that the difference between them is not 180 deg. and therefore I will subtract 20 deg. 0 min. from 195 deg. and the Remainder is the Difference of Longitude between them 175 deg. but if the Difference between two places be above 180 deg. as they are laid down in the Catalogue: Subtract that difference from 360 deg. and the Remainder is the nearest Dif∣ference of Longitude: Your own reason will guide you in this, and therefore I will proceed. How to keep a Reckoning of the Longitude and Latitude a Ship makes at Sea. HAving found the Difference of Longitude between the places I set from, and am bound to, as also the Latitude of each place. I will begin my Reckoning thus: Imagine it were between the Lizard and Barbadoes, and I set from the Lizard the 3d. of January 1658.

Here in this Reckoning I have set down the Longitude in de∣grees and minutes, as before I set down the Departure in leagues, carrying all in the last line: the last line of my Reckoning saith, that they were in the Latitude of 13 deg. 12 min. and the whole East Longitude that we have made since we set from the Lizard is 1 deg. 5 min. the whole West Longitude is 58 deg. 35 min. subtract the Easting from the Westing, and the Remainder is 57 deg. 30 min. which lacks but 8 min. of 57 deg. 38 min. the Meridian of the Place. Also the same line saith, that we are in the Latitude of 13 deg. 12 min. which is the Latitude of the place: therefore I con∣clude I am but 8 min. from it, so that I expect to see Land. There is no Difference in the setting down of this Reckoning from that before, but only this is degrees and minutes, that leagues or miles; neither is there any other difference in their casting up, for there your Easting from your Westing in leagues, here in degrees. That there be nothing wanting to make me be understood, I will here following do the three first days works in three Examples. SUppose the first day I set out, I sailed S W b W 6 deg. 25 min. Westerly, till I come into the Latitude of 49 deg. 0 min. which was the next day at noon. I consider that I have the two Latitudes given me, and the Course to find the Difference of Longitude. The Meridional part answering to 50 deg. 0 min. is 3475 The Meridional part answering to 49 deg. 0 min. is 3382 The Meridional parts contained between them is 93 For the Difference of Longitude. As Radius   To the Difference of Latitude in parts 93 1,96848 So is the Tangent of the Course 62 d. 40 m. 10,28661 To the Difference of Longitude in minutes 180 2,25510
This 180 divided by 60 produceth 3 deg. 0 min. the Diffe∣rence of Longitude made that 24 hours; set it down in your Reckoning with the Latitude you were in, filling up the East Co∣lumn with Ciphers: I need not shew how to find the Distance run, because I suppose by what hath been said before, you can do it. For the second days Work. Suppose till the next day at noon we sail S W 10 deg. 11 min. Westerly, 169 miles by Estimation (for we could not observe.) I consider here that I have given the Course and Distance run and one Latitude, namely, the Latitude I was in yesterday, 49 deg. 0 min. to find the Latitude I am now in, and my Diffe∣rence of Longitude. For the Latitude I am now in. As Radius   To the Distance run 169 miles 2,227886 So is Sine comp. the Course 55 d. 11 m. 9,756599 To the Difference of Latitude 96 miles 1,984486 This 96 miles is 1 deg. 36 min. which subtracted from the Latitude I was in yesterday (because the Course is Southerly) leaves the Latitude I am now in 47 deg. 24 min. (set it down in your Column of Latitude in your Reckoning) Thus I have both Latitudes and the Course, to find the Difference of Longitude. I take the Meridional part answering to each Latitude, and subtract the one from the other, and there remains 144 parts. For the Difference of Longitude. As Radius   To the Difference of Latitude in parts, 144 parts 2,158362 So is Tangent the Course 55 deg. 11 min. 10,157734 To the Difference of Longitude in minutes 207 2,316097
Which divided by 60, produceth 3 deg. 27 min. this I add to my west Longitude (because the Course is Westerly) 3 deg. 00 min. and it makes 6 deg. 27 min. This 6 deg. 27 min. I set down in the West Column, and thus you may keep your whole Longitude in the last line. The third days Work. Suppose the Winds be cross, and that we are forced to tack, and we make our way good S S E, and I observe and find my self in the Latitude of 46 deg. 9 min. I demand the Difference of Longitude. I find the Meridional part answering to my Latitude yester∣day 47 deg. 24 min. is 3238 The Meridional part answering my Latitude gives this day by observation 46 deg. 9 min. is 3128 The Meridional parts contained between these two Latitudes is 110 As Radius   To 110 2,04139 So is Tangent 22 deg. 30 min. 9,61722 To the Difference of Longitude in minutes 46 m. 1,65862 This 46 min. is East Longitude, and must be set down in the East Column: and let the West Column hold its Sum still, as was done in the plain Reckoning before, and when you come to increase your Westing again, carry your whole East Longitude along, and thus you have your whole Reckoning in the last line: The setting down of this differs nothing from the other; therefore to that I refer you. Sometimes your Latitudes may be such, that the Tables do not answer them to a minute, (for they are but to every 3 min.) as suppose the one Latitude were 13 deg. 20 min. the other 15 deg. 16 min. and I would take the Meridional part contained between them.
I look for 15 deg. 16 min. and cannot find it, but the nearest less than it, is 15 deg. 15 min. against which I find 926 I look for the nearest above it in the Tables, which is against 15 deg 18 min. and find 929 I subtract the lesser from the greater, the remainder is 003 Then I consider that the difference between 15 deg. 15 min. and 15 deg. 18 min. is but 3, and that the portion that I want is but ⅓ of this Difference, 1; therefore add 1 to the Meridio∣nal part answering to 15 deg. 15 min. which is 926, and it makes 927, the Meridional parts answering to 15 deg. 16 min. required. The same I do for 13 deg. 20 min. and find the Meridional parts answering it to be 807, subtract them one from the other, and the remainder is the Meridional part contained between them; the like for any other, As Suppose one demands of me the 20th. day of January, how the Island of Barbadoes bears off me by my account in this Reckoning. I look upon my reckoning, and I find that day I was in the Latitude of 20 d. 45 m. and I have made West Longitude 28 d. 44 min. East Longitude 1 deg. 5 min. I subtract the East Lon∣gitude 1 deg. 5 min. from the West 28 deg. 44 min. there re∣mains 27 deg. 39 min. the West Longitude that I have made since I set from the Lizard; subtract this 27 deg. 39 min. from the Difference of Longitude between the Lizard and Barbadoes 57 deg. 38 min. and the remainder is 29 deg. 57 d. 38 m. 27 39 29 59 59 min. the Difference of Longitude which I have yet to make: I look at the top of my Reckoning for the Latitude of the place I am bound to, and find it to be 13 deg. 12 min. Thus I have the two Latitudes, and the Difference of Longi∣tude, to find the bearing of the place I am bound to: You may find it as is shewed before, Quest. 4. by bringing your Diffe∣rence of Longitude into minutes, and taking the Meridional parts contained between the Latitude you are now in, and the Lati∣tude of Barbadoes; and using them as the sides to work by.
If you have a mind to know your Distance (upon the Course) to Barbadoes, see what Difference of Latitude is between the Latitude you are in, and the Latitude of Barbadoes, reduce it into miles, and say, As Sine comp. the Course To the Difference of Latitude, So is Radius To the Distance. And thus in brief you are able to give an account of your whole Reckoning at any time, or of any part of your Reckon∣ing, if the day be given. The like you may do for the Course that was steered from day to day; but that (as I shewed before) ought to be taken notice of in a Journal, or if you like it better make a Column for it in your Reckoning. The reason why I re∣fer that and the Winds and Variation, is, because it can better be expressed with the reasons of it than here. Those days that you observe, correct your Reckoning by your Observations, as my Father sheweth in his practice after the Tables. I had thoughts to have projected a Chart after the manner of Mercator, but because few of them are made true, I forbear, and advise none to trust them, except they are able to examine them. If I have been too tedious either in this, or any thing else, remember this is but the buds of my beginnings, and hereafter I may learn to comprise a great matter (more plainly) under fewer words, which is most docible.

Rules to find the Latitude, or Poles Elevation by the Meridian Altitude of the Sun or Stars, having the Tables of their Declination. FIrst, if the Sun or Star be on the Meridian to the South∣wards, and have South Declination, add the Suns Declina∣tion to the Meridian Altitude, and it gives the Aequinoctial's height above the Horizon, that total subtracted from 90 deg. gives the Latitude Northerly, which is the Aequinoctials Di∣stance below the Zenith or Poles Elevation. Example. Suppose upon the 11th. of February, 1663, I find the Suns Declination to be Southerly 10 d. 22 m. Suns Meridian Altitude I observe to be 30 10 That Total is 40 32 Which being subtracted from 89 60 The Remainder is the Poles Elevat. or Lat. North 49 28 If when you have added the Suns Declination to the Meridian Altitude, it exceed 90 deg. then cast away 90 deg. and the Re∣mainder is the Latitude Southerly. Secondly, if the Sun or Star be on the Meridian to the South∣wards, and have North Declination, subtract the Suns Decli∣nation from the Meridian Altitude, and it leaves the height of the Aequinoctial above the Horizon, that subtracted from 90 deg. leaves the Latitude Northerly.
Example. Admit upon the 19th. of May 1663. the Suns Declination is Northerly 13 d. 17 m. The Suns Meridian Altitude is 69 58 Suns Declination being subtracted the Remainder is 56 41 This subtracted from 89 60 Leaves the Latitude Northerly 33 19 Thirdly, if the Sun or Star be on the Meridian to the North∣wards, and have North Declination, add the Suns Declination to the Meridian Altitude, and it gives the height of the Aequi∣noctial above the Horizon, that being taken from 90 deg. leaves the Latitude Southerly. But if it exceed 90 deg. after the Declination is added, sub∣tract 90 deg. from it, and the remainder is the Latitude: See in the first Rule an Example, in its operation as this is. Fourthly, if the Sun or Star be to the Northwards and have South Declination, subtract the Suns Declination from the Meridian Altitude, and it gives the Aequinoctial's height above the Horizon; subtract that from 90 deg. and it leaves the La∣titude Southerly. Fifthly, if you observe when the Sun or Star hath no Decli∣nation, then the Complement of his Meridian Altitude is the Latitude. Sixthly, if the Sun or Star be observed in the Zenith, the Declination is the Latitude. If you have a desire to work by the Complement of the Sun or Stars Meridian Altitude (which is used for its brevity by Sea∣men) do as followeth: If the Sun hath South Declination, and be to the Southward of you, subtract the Suns Declination from the Complement of the Sun or Stars Meridian Altitude, and the Remainder is the Latitude Northerly: But if the Suns Declination be more than the Complement of the Suns Meridian Altitude, subtract the Complement of the Suns Altitude from the Declination, and the remainder is the Latitude Southerly.
Secondly, if the Sun or Star be on the Meridian to the South∣wards, and have North Declination, add the Complement of its Altitude to the Declination, and the remainder is the Latitude. If the Sun or Star be on the Meridian to the Northwards, and have North Declination, subtract the Declination from the Complement of the Meridian Altitude, and the remainder is the Latitude Southerly: If the Suns Declination be more than the Complement of the Sun or Stars Meridian Altitude, sub∣tract the Altitude from the Declination, and the Remainder is the Latitude Northerly. If the Sun or Star be to the Northwards, and have South De∣clination, add the Declination to the Complement of the Meri∣dian Altitude, and the remainder is the Latitude Southerly. If you observe the Sun when he hath no Declination, the Complement of his Meridian Altitude is the Latitude. If you observe the Sun or Star in the Zenith, the Declinati∣on is the Latitude. And thus much for the finding the Latitude by the Suns Meridian Altitude, or the Complement thereof; also for such Stars as have their Declination from the Aequi∣noctial. For those Stars whose Declination is their distance from the Pole, if you observe them under the Pole, add the Declination to the Meridian Altitude; if above the Pole, subtract their De∣clination, and the Remainder is the Latitude. And thus much for finding the Latitude by the Declination, and Meridian Al∣titude of the Sun or Stars, or the Complement of the Meridian Altitude of the Sun, or such Stars whose Declination is their distance from the Aequator.
OF ASTRONOMY. I Had thoughts to have handled the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles fully, but if I should, I might do that which my Father hath done before, better than I can; the thing which induced me to this thought was that I might make the Application of it to Great Circle sailing; but because that way of sailing (though the best) is seldom used, I have not set it in my Book; if you desire to know it, you may see the way of it in my Fathers works, as plainly as (I think) it can possibly be demonstrated by any man. I have thought good to make use of his fundamental Axiom, to shew how to resolve those Questions in the Sphere, which I have wrought in this Book by the Plain Scale, though I confess (for Amplitudes of Rising and Setting, and Azimuths at certain given hours, with divers other things that are chiefly to be minded at Sea, for the Variation of the Compass, and other necessary uses) I hold the Plain Scale to be true enough, but that I conceive not to be so satisfactory to all men, and there∣fore I have done this, the Axiom is this: The Sine of a middle part with Radius, is equal to the Tangents of the Extremes adjacent, or to the Sine Complement of the opposite Extremes.
Now for Brevities sake it is common to use these Characters, for this Character + signifieth with Radius or more, or one Side or Angle with an another, for equal =, for less −; so that the general Rule or fundamental Observation which we purpose to use, may be expressed thus: The Sine of the middle part + Radius is = to the Tangents of the Extremes adjacent, or to the Sine complement of the op∣posite Extremes. This Rule being rightly understood gives such full directi∣ons, that a man may resolve any Question in the Sphere by it, which makes me judge those culpable of a fault, that accuse him of Prolixity, that made it in so brief a manner. I will define a spherical right angled Triangle, and so come to the use of this Axiom. In the spherical right angled Tri∣angle A B C, right angled at B, there are 5 things considerable, beside the right Angle, namely, the three Sides and the two Angles; the two Sides next to the right Angle are not no∣ted to be Complements, but the Side A C, the Angle A, and the Angle C, is noted by their Complements to a Quadrant (which are the three things farthest from the right An∣gle B.) depiction of geometrical figure If you have two things given beside the right Angle, to find a third (as you always have) the first thing that you are to consider, is, whether it be an adjacent or an opposite Ex∣treme. That is an adjacent Extreme, when the given parts and the required part joyn. For Example in Adjacent Extremes. Suppose the given things were A C and A C B, and the re∣quired thing were C B: Here you see that A C is joyning to C,
and so is C B, therefore they all joyn, and C is the middle part, for it is between B C and C A the Extremes. That is an opposite Extreme that hath two things lying to∣gether, and the third thing lieth alone, and that part which lieth alone is the middle part. Example. Suppose the three things (namely the two given things, and the required thing) were B C, the Angle at A, and C A; then I conclude that C B is the middle part, and that it is an oppo∣site Extreme, because it is alone, and the other thing, namely, C A and A are together: If you ask how this can be, thus: A C B is between C B and C A, and A B is between C B and the Angle at A, which proves that B C is alone, and A C and the Angle at A joyns: Then is A C and the Angle at A also the two Extremes. Pray observe this for a Rule, that the right Angle never parts any thing, for if C B, the Side B A, and the Angle at A be the three things, it is nevertheless an adjacent Extreme; for though the right Angle be between the Sides B A, and B C, yet do not count that it parts them, (as another Angle would) so as to make it an opposite Extreme. Or if the given and required things were the three Sides, you might judge B A the middle part, because it is alone, for the Angle at A parts it from A C, and the right Angle at B is be∣tween B C and it: Now never count that the right Angle at B parts B C from B A, but that they lie together, and A C lies alone, being parted by the Angle C from C B, and by the Angle A from A B, and so is the middle part: These be the first conside∣rations (after you have a Question set you) that you ought to mind, without regarding which of the three things is given or required. We now come to apply this general Axiom. Suppose I have the Side B C given, the Angle at C, and that the Side C A be required. From what hath been said I know C to be the middle part and that it is an adjacent Extreme; I will apply the Rule thus, it saith
the Sine of the middle part, which intimates that the middle part must be always so called, as you may take the Sine of it; now because its noted to be a Complement, you must call it Sine Complement, to find the Sine of it. This done, I will go to one of the Extremes, and consider what the Axiom saith for that, (admit it be the Extreme C B) It saith the Sine of the middle part with Radius, is equal to the Tangents of the Ex∣tremes adjacent; from whence I conclude, that I must call C B so, as that I may have the Tangent of it; Now C B is not noted to be a Complement, and therefore I call it Tangent C B. Lastly, for the other Extreme C A, for the same reason I must call it so, as that I may take the Tangent of it: and because it is noted to be a Complement, therefore I call it Tangent Com∣plement, to have the Tangent of it: Now as I go along thus in my thoughts, I will set it down as I consider it, and it frames this Rule: Sine com. C + Radius is = to Tang. C B + Tang. comp. C A. My Question being brought into this order, I will consider which is given and which is required: those which are given, I will set down first, the thing required undermost, and look for them in the Tables by the directions which I have framed from the Axiom. Look for Sine comp. C For Tangent B A Add them together, casting away Radius, and the Sum look for in the Tangents take Tan. com. C A it produceth your desire.   And thus this Axiom sets your business in order; but now that you may know when to take a Complement arithmetical, or let it a lone; and also, that you may know which thing it is that you must take the Complement arithmetical of, observe this Rule, either in adjacent or opposite Extremes. That if the middle part and an extreme be given, take the Complement arithmetical of the given Extreme; but if the two Extremes be given, to find the middle part, take no Complement arithmetical at all: This may be sufficient for all Questions in
right angled Triangles, will fall out one of these two ways; this Complement arithmetical is what every figure in the Tables wants of 9: it was first invented by my Father, it saves a labour of Subtracting, and so abbreviates the work much. To many which I have taught, it hath seemed strange that a thing is called Sine comp. or Tan. comp. (when one is to find the Sine or Tangent of it) but the reason of it is this; if a thing be a Complement already (as three things in every right angled spherical Triangle is noted to be) the comp. of that Comple∣ment must be the Sine or Tangent of that Complement. But pray mind me; I have noted that there are five things in every right angled Triangle considerable, besides the right Angle. Now observe this for a Rule, (when you are framing your Rule from the general Axiom to work by) that if you call any of these five things by their names, you shall not have the Com∣plements of them, but call any of them out of their names, and you shall; I mean thus. Suppose you have a mind to take the Sine of A B, it is noted not to be a Complement, therefore call it Sine A B, to have the Sine of it, or Tangent A B to have the Tangent of it, the like for C B. Again, if you have a mind to take the Sine of C A, I consider that C A is noted by the name of a Complement, call it Sine comp. so shall you have the Sine of it, or Tangent Complement, and you shall have the Tangent of it; the like for the two Angles contrariwise: If you have occasion to take the Complements of them, call them out of their names. Example in opposite Extremes. Suppose A B be given, and B C, and the Side A C be required. From what hath be said, I consider this is an opposite Ex∣treme, and that A C is the middle part; (for that is alone) call A C Sine Complement to find the Sine of it: and because the Axiom saith, that the Sine of the middle part with Radius, is = to the Sines Complement of the opposite Extremes (for the former Reasons) call A B Sine comp. and B C Sine comp. which is out of their names, and you have this Rule: Sine com. A C + Radius is = to Sine com. A B + Sine com. B C.
This done, set the things down by the order Sine com. C B Sine com. A B Sine com. A C of this Rule, with the required thing under most thus: Take the figures answering the number of degrees and minutes, which the given things may contain, (out of the Tables) add them together, casting away Radius, (if it comes to be above it) and look for the Remainder amongst the Sines, and take the Complement of that Sine that answers it, to answer your demand. Suppose it were A B and A C that were given, to find the Angle at C; this is opposite Extreme, and A B is the middle part, call A B (the middle part) Sine, (which is by its name) to find the Sine of it, and A C, and the Angle at A out of their names (which is Sine A C, and Sine A) to find the Sine Com∣plement of them, and thus for any else. Be sure to remember the Rule that I propounded about the Complement arithmetical, that so you may know when to take it, and when to let it alone. This is in brief. My Father hath shewed the proportions that holds, and the reasons of them, which I purposely omit, knowing that this Rule works those Proportions: We will now come to the work it self; and I shall do only those Questions which I wrought by the Plain Scale, as being most necessary for our use that go to Sea. Latitude 50 deg. 00 min. Northerly, Declination 13 deg. 15 m. Northerly, I demand the Meridian Altitude of the Sun. LEt M G n R represent the Meridian, M n the Horizon, K y the Equinoctial, I ♈ the Parallel of the Suns Decli∣nation, G the Zenith, R the Nadir, subtract the Latitude G K 50 deg. 0 min. (= to n f) from G K M 90 deg. and the Re∣mainder is K M, the height of the Aequinoctial above the Hori∣zon, 40 deg. 0 min. to which add the Suns Declination K I 13 deg. 15 min. and the Sum is I M the thing required, 53 deg. 15 min. as you may see in this Example.
depiction of geometrical figure This, if the Suns Declination be 50 00 90 00 40 00 13 15 53 15 Northerly But if the Suns Declination were Southerly, namely, so as that her Parallel of Declination cut the Meridian in s; subtract the Suns Declination K s from the height of the Aequinoctial above the Horizon K M, and the Remainder is s M, the Suns Meridian Altitude. In any Latitude, subtract the Latitude from 90 deg. and so you have the Aequinoctials height above the Horizon; then see whether the Meridian Altitude be greater or lesser than that; if greater, add the Suns Declination to the Aequinoctials height above the Horizon, if lesser subtract it, and the Remainder is the Suns Meridian Altitude: and this is evident, because the Suns Declination is his Distance from the Aequator, and so he can be but as much higher or lower than the Aequator, as his Declination is.
Latitude 50 deg. 0 min. Declination 13 deg. 15 min. Northerly, I demand the Suns Amplitude of Rising and Setting. NOte, that the sides of a Spherical Triangle are three Ar∣ches of Great Circles, every Arch being less than a Se∣micircle; and therefore the Parallels or other lesser Circles of the Sphere must not be taken as the Sides of a Triangle. F O P is an Arch of the Meridian, cutting the Center of the Sun at his Rising, which is at O (you have been told that all Me∣ridians cut the Aequinoctial at right Angles) then must of ♈ be a right Angle, and in it I have given s 0 the Suns Declination (= to t c) and s ♈ 0 = 40 deg. 0 min. the measure of f ♈ 0, is E K = to t A the Complement of t s to 90 deg. (t s being the Latitude 50 deg. 0 min.) and I am to find ♈ 0, the Suns Am∣plitude of Rising; I consider it is an opposite Extreme, and that s 0 is the middle part. Sine f 0 + Radius is = to Sine ♈ + Sine ♈ 0. depiction of geometrical figure Sine f 0 the Suns Declination 13 deg. 15 min. 9,36021 Sine f ♈ 0 the com. of the Poles Elev. 40 d. co. ar. 9,19193 Sine ♈ 0 the Suns Amplitude of Rising or Setting 20 deg. 53 min. 24 sec. 9,55214
Use this way to find the Suns true Amplitude of Rising, upon occasion of finding the Variation of the Compass. The Suns place of Rising from the East towards the North, namely, East 20 deg. 53 min. 24 sec. Northerly; O ♈ is the Complement of O E, the Suns Azimuth of Rising from the North: so that if you subtract it from 90 deg. ♈ E the remain∣der is 69 deg. 6 min. 36 sec. O E; but if you have a desire to find the Suns Azimuth by the things you have given, here it is in the Triangle F E O, and is done as in this following Question. Latitude 50 deg. Declination 13 deg. 15 min. I demand the Suns Azimuth of Rising or Setting. LEt F O f P be an Arch of the Meridian, cutting the Sun at his Rising (which is at O) f O is the Suns Declination 23 deg. 15 min. which subtracted from f F 90 deg. the remain∣der is O F 76 deg. 45 min. the Suns distance from the North Pole, and F E is the Poles Elevation 50 deg. 0 min. and thus you have two sides given in the right angled Triangle O E F, to find the third side O F; its an opposite Extreme, and F O is the middle part: The general Axiom produceth this: Sine com. F O + Radius is = to Sine com. F E + Sine com. O E. Sine com. O F 76 deg. 45 min. 9,360215 Sine com. F E 50 deg. 0 min. comp. arith. 0,191932 Sine com. O E 69 deg. 6 min. 36 sec. 9,552147 Thus I find the Sun riseth to the Eastwards of the North 69 deg. 6 min. 36 sec. which is E b N 9 deg. 38 min. 24 sec. Northerly; the other Question shews the same, when you find the Suns Amplitude. Latitude 50 deg. Declination 13 deg. 15 min. Northerly, I demand the Suns height at six of the Clock. LEt G P m N be an Azimuth passing through the hour of 6: Now in the Triangle ♈ m P, right angled at m, you have given P ♈ the Suns Declination 13 deg. 15 min. and the Angle at ♈, namely P ♈ m = to the Arch f O (for f O is the measure
of it) it is the Poles Elevation 50 deg. 0 min. to find P m the Suns height at six of the Clock: I consider it is an opposite Extreme, and the required thing P m is the middle part. Sine P m + Radius is = to Sine P ♈ + Sine P ♈ m. depiction of geometrical figure Sine P ♈ the Suns Declination 13 deg. 15 min. 9,360215 Sine P ♈ m the Poles Elevation 50 deg. 0 min. 9,884254 Sine P m the Suns height at six of the Clock 10 deg. 6 min. 51 see. 9,244469 The same things given, to find the Suns Azimuth at six of the Clock. THe Suns Azimuth at 6 of the Clock is m ♈, and the reason is, for that P u in the Heavens (being parallel to the Ho∣rizon) is as many degrees in that Circle, as ♈ m is in the Hori∣zon; for ♈ is under m, and m under P. So that this Question will fall in the same Triangle as the other did, and we will use the same things to find it. The Angle P ♈ m is 50 deg. 0 min. the Poles Elevation. P ♈ is the Suns Declination 13 d. 15 m. and ♈ m is required. I consider that this is an adjacent Extreme, and that P ♈ m is the middle part; The general Axiom produceth. Sine com. P ♈ m + Radius, is = to Tang. ♈ m + Tang. com. P

Declination 13 deg. 15 min. to find the Suns height being due East or West. LEt O L I u be an Arch of the Meridian, cutting the Sun in the East and West Azimuth, and it helps to make the right angled Triangle L I ♈, in which lieth our business: For L ♈ is the Suns height being due East; and to find it we have I L the Suns Declination 13 deg. 15 min. and L ♈ I the Angle of the Latitude, besides the right Angle; I consider it it is an opposite Extream and I L is the middle part, there will be this inference produced from the general Axiom. Sine I L + Radius, is = to Sine I ♈ L + Sine L ♈. depiction of geometrical figure Sine I ♈ L the Latitude 50 deg. comp. arith. 0,1157459 Sine I L the Suns Declination 13 deg. 15 min. 9,3602154 Sine L ♈ Suns height being due East 17 d 24′ 34″ 9,4759613 The same height that the Sun is being due East in the morning, the same height he is when he is due West in the afternoon.
The Latitude being 50 deg. 0 min. Declination 13 deg. 15 min. I desire to know the Difference of Ascension. I Have shewed what the Difference of Ascension means in this Book before; and if you look in the Question to find the Amplitude of the Suns rising before, there is the same Scheme that this is, but for your better uuderstanding I have here set it. In the Triangle B D ♈ right angled at D, you have given D B the Suns Declination 13 deg. 15 min. the Angle at ♈ which is the Complement of the Arch I Z to 90 deg. or equal to O A the Complement of the Latitude 40 deg. 0 min. to find D ♈, which is as many degrees and minutes as B 6 is: It is an adjacent Ex∣treme and ♈ D is the middle part: The conclusion from the general Axiom is Sine Y D + Radius, is = to Tan. D B + Tan. com. D Y B. depiction of geometrical figure Tangent D B Suns Declination 13 deg. 15 min. 9,371933 Tan. com. D ♈ B com. Poles Elevat. 40 d. 0 m. 10,076186 Sine ♈ D the Difference of Ascension 16 d. 17′ 40″ 9,448119 Which converted into time is 1 hour 5′ 2/15 and ⅔ of 1/15 of a minute.
The same things given, to find the time of Sun Rising. FOr the doing of this, first find the Difference of Ascension (as hath been shewed in the last Question) and convert it into time; which done, subtract it from 6 hours, and you have your desire (in this case where the Declination and Latitude is both one way) but in any case take this in general, that if the Difference of Ascension be before 6 of the Clock, subtract it; if after 6, add it to 6 hours, and you have the time of Sun Rising. This stands to good reason, forasmuch as the Difference of Ascension is the portion of time that the Sun riseth before or after 6 of the Clock. In this Example you see the Difference of Ascension is before 6 of the Clock 1 hour 5′ 3/15 (we will omit the part of a part of a minute) I would know the time of the Suns Rising. Example. Subtract the Difference of Ascension 1 h. 5 m. 3/15 From 6 hours 5 60 The remainder is the time of Sun Rising 4 54 12/15 or ⅘ Thus I conclude the Sun riseth at 4 a Clock 54 min. ⅘ If you have a desire to find the time of Sun setting, subtract the time of Sun rising from 12 hours, and you have it; for as many hours and minutes as the Sun riseth before 12, so many hours and minutes he sets after 12. Example. Here the Sun riseth at 4 of the Clock, 54 m. ⅘ which we express thus 4 h. 54 m. ⅘ This subtracted from 11 60 Leaves the time of Sun setting 7 05 ⅕ Which is 5 min. ⅕ past 7 of the Clock in the afternoon.
This doubled is the length of the whole day, which is 14 hours 10 min ⅖. This subtracted from 24 hours, is the length of the night, 9 hours 49 min. 8/5. To find the length of the longest Day in that Latitude before proposed. VVHen the days are at the longest in any North Latitude, the Sun is in the Tropick of Cancer; in a Southern Latitude, in the Tropick of Capricorn: This is a Northern Lati∣tude, therefore make the Tropick of Cancer the Parallel of the Suns Declination as here, O R is the Parallel of the Suns Decli∣nation, then must I 6 be the Difference of Ascension, which is = to F ♈. In the right Angled Triangle I F ♈ right angled at F, you have I ♈ F the Complement of the Latitude 40 deg. given, and I F the Suns Declination 23 deg. 30 min. to find F ♈; find it as you was shewed to find the Difference of Ascension before, convert it into time, and find the length of the day (as was shew∣ed before) This note, that Sine s I F L is an Arch of the Meridian, cutting the Horizon in that place of it where the Sun riseth. Sine ♈ F + Radius is = to Tang. I F + Tang. comp. I ♈ F. depiction of geometrical figure Tang. I F Suns Declination 23 deg. 30 min. 9,638301 Tang. com.

But you may ask all this while how this Fraction is found, it is thus found: Admit I would find the sine of the Arch answer∣ing to 9714487, I look in the Sines, and find the nearest less than it to be   9,714352 I take the next greater than it and find it to be 9,714560 I subtract the lesser from the greater, the remainder is 208 Then from the figures that came forth 9,714487 I subtract the nearest in the Tables less 9,714352 And the Remainder is 135 Then say, As the Difference between the nearest less and the nearest greater 280 comp. arith. 7,681936 Is to the Difference between the same and that less 135 2,130333 So is 60 min. 1,778151 To 39 sec. 1,590420 The like is to be understood of any Fraction else; if you have occasion for the artificial Sine or Tangent of an Arch that hath a Fraction to it: Say, As 60 seconds Is to the seconds in the Fraction, which is here 39 So is the Difference between the nearest lesser and the nearest greater 208 To the Fraction 135 And this added to the lesser, makes the artificial Sine of the Arch required 9,714352 9,714487 The like is to be understood of a Tangent.   To find the hour of the Suns being due East or West. Latitude 50 deg. 0 min. Declination 13 deg. 15 min. Northerly, I demand the time of the Suns being due East or West. IN the following Scheme I O is the East and West Azimuth, R X is the Parallel of the Suns Declination, and cuts that Azimuth in C; from whence I conclude, that when the Sun is at C, she is over the East point of the Horizon; D C B A is an Arch of the Meridian, cutting the Sun in C: So that in the
depiction of geometrical figure Triangle C B r, you have given B C the Suns Declination, C r B the Angle of the Latitude 50 deg. 0 m. to find B r, which is as many degrees and minutes in a great Circle, as C 6 is in a lesser; find it and convert it into time, and in this case add it to 6 hours, and it gives the hour of the Suns being due East. And for the time of the Suns being due West, you are to sub∣tract it from 6 hours, (in this case) and the remainder is your desire: The reason is, because as many hours as the Sun is due East after 6 of the Clock in the morning, so long time is he due West before 6 of the Clock in the Afternoon. I have left the working of this to your own practice, only I have set down the Resolution of it: The Sun is due East 45 min. 9/15 past 6 of the Clock. The Sun is due West 45 min. 9/15 before 6 of the Clock. Which is at 5 of the Clock 14 min. 6/15. Note, That if the Suns Declination be Southerly, then will he be East before 6; so that whereas here you add, there you subtract from 6 hours, to find the hour of the Suns being due East, or add to 6 hours for the time of its being due West; but your own Reason (if you look well on the Scheme) will guide you to know this; and also to know that, it is useless in such cases, for then he is not above the Horizon.
Latitude 50 deg. 0 min. Declination 13 deg. 15 min. I demand the Continuance of Twilight. AS I have noted before, the Sun is accounted 17 deg. under the Horizon when the day breaks; therefore in the fol∣lowing Scheme let 17 I, be an Arch parallel to the Horizon, 17 deg. under it: Let D B C A be an Azimuth cutting the Aequi∣noctial, and the line of 17 deg. in the place of their intersection, which is at C: then in the Triangle r B C (right angled at B) you have given B C 17 deg. the Angle B r C the Complement of the Poles Elevation 40 deg. to find C r the continuance of Twilight (for C r and B u are equal.) I leave it to your own Pra∣ctice: I find the continuance of Twilight to be 27 deg. 4 min. which converted into time is 1 h. 48 min. 4/13 nearest. depiction of geometrical figure So I conclude that between the Day breaking and Sun rising, it is 1 h. 48 min. 4/15, which is u B: Now if you add this to the Difference of Ascension (before found) B 6, which was 1 h. 5 min. 3/15 of a minute (I omit the smaller Fraction) you have the time between break of day, and 6 of the Clock, which may be termed u B 6 2 h. 53 min. 7/15.
And because the day breaks so much before 6 of the Clock, if you subtract it from 6 hours, you have the hour and minute of day breaking, which is at 3 of the Clock 6 min. 8/15. Add it to 6 of the Clock, and you have the time of Twilight ending, which is at 8 h. 53 min. 7/15. To find the Suns Place and Right Ascension, provided, the Latitude and Declination be given. Latitude 50 deg. 0 min. Declination 13 deg. 15 min, I demand the Suns Place in the Ecliptick and right Ascension. RIght Ascension is an Arch of the Aequinoctial between a Meridian, cutting the Aequinoctial and the point of Aries or Libra; the Meridian must also cut the Sun or Star in the Ecliptick as here in this Scheme: A B C is an Arch of the Meridi∣an, cutting the Sun at B in the Ecliptick, and the Aequinoctial in C; then C ♈ is the Suns right Ascension. The Suns Place (as I shewed formerly) is the Suns distance in the Ecliptick, from the nearest Aequinoctial point here B Y. To find the Suns place ♈ B, you have given the Angle B ♈ C 23 deg. 30 min. and C B the Suns Declination 13 deg. 15 min. in the right angled Triangle B C ♈; it is an opposite Extreme, and C B is the middle part, I find it to be 35 deg. 5 min. if you propose the month and the day of the month that the Sun hath this Declination, you may tell what Sign the Sun is in, and what degree of that Sign. depiction of geometrical figure
As suppose the Sun hath this Declination here given upon the 14th. of April, I consider what Sign belongeth to that Month, and I conclude it is ♉, then say I, as much as the Sun is distant from the next Aequinoctial point above 30 deg. (which is the Sine of ♈) so much he is entered into ♉, which is 5 deg. 5 min. I omit the Fraction. For the Suns Right Ascension. You have the same things given in the same Triangle, to find the Suns right Ascension C ♈; but this is an adjacent Extreme, and the required thing is the middle part. I find it to be 32 deg. 47 min. some part of a minute more, (but I omit the Fraction.) This must be converted into time, and then is your demand fully answered, it is 2 h. 11 min 2/15. These be things necessary and very useful in Navigation for several occasions, and that hath made me insist upon them: If you are unacquainted with this way of working, my Father hath insisted upon it largely, and in his works, commonly called The Doctrine of Triangles; you may be satisfied both in the Doctrine of right lined Triangles, and Spherical. This I judge sufficient for the two kinds of Sailing. I would have handled something in oblique Spherical Trian∣gles, and so have proceeded to that incomparable way of Sailing by the Arch of a Great Circle; but the goodness of it is not known because it is not practised: If you love that way of Sailing, (Reader) I commend thee to my Fathers Doctrine of Triangles in large, where it is largely treated of.
