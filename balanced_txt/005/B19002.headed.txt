royal blazon or coat of arms C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE CHARLES by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland Defender of Faith, &c. TO all Our loving Subjects, not onely of Our Kingdome of England, but also of Our native Kingdome of Scotland, and Realme of Ireland, greeting: Whereas by the providence of Almighty God Wee have succeded Our royall father of
blessed memory (as was Our hereditary right) in all his Dominons and Signearies, We thought it fit to divulge Our thankful∣nesse to God, by extending Our royall Grace to Our people, which are by him committed to Our charge. And because no one Act can so well beseeme the naturall magnificence of a Christian King, as the expression of that divine attribute mercy, Wee by the testimony of that, and free grant of Our Grace to all Our Subjects, shall endevour to gratifie all Our loving Subjects. Wee doe therefore hereby, out of Our royall Grace and Benignity, by these pre∣sents, give and grant a free and generall pardon to all Our Subjects in Our said Kingdomes, of England, Scotland, and Ire∣land, and Our Principality of Wales; for all and all manner of crimes and offences, which to this present day have by them, or any of them, either by neglect or mis-un∣derstanding of Our Lawes, been commit∣ted against Vs. And this Act of Our royall Grace and Mercy, shall not be extended
onely to all Our Subjects within Our three Kingdomes aforesaid, but likewise to such of Oun Subjects as are absent in forraigne parts, provided alwayes, that this Our cle∣mencie extend not to such malefactors, as have beene banished Our said Kingdomes for any Treason or Treasons against Our royall father of blessed memory, or his ex∣cellent predecessor, Queen Elizabeth, nor to any person or persons that have of their owne accord, and to save themselves from the justice of Our Lawes relinquished and abandoned any of Our said Kingdomes: for any of these capitall and heynous crimes of high Treason to Our owne Person, of Sodomie, wilfull murther, or rape: and We do likewise hereby declare, that this Our said Act of Grace and generall pardon, is not extensive to any of Our Subjects now resident within any of Our said Kingdomes or Signearies, that are by due order of Law convicted and found guiltie of all or any of the crimes aforesaid of high Treason to Our Person, Sodomie, wilfull murther, or rape,
nay, also of Burglary. For, as We would wil∣lingly afford a testimony of Our mercy, so We would thereby no way injure the Dig∣nity of Our Iustice, or harme any of Our good Subjects by retracting and extenuating the severity of Our Lawes against such ca∣pitall malefactors. And that there may be no mis-understan∣ding of this Our Act of Grace and generall pardon in any of Our good Subjects, Wee doe declare and expresse to whom and what offenders Our said pardon reaches; We doe therefore by these presents, acquit and as∣soile all, and all manner of persons that by neglect, or any other accident, have runne themselves into a Premunirie, which extends to the forfeiture of their Estates, and impri∣sonment of their persons: all, and all man∣ner of persons that are guilty of the breach of Our peace; and therefore bound to an∣swer at Our Assises: all offenders whatsoe∣ver that have run themselves into the danger of punishment by Our Lawes; for simple felonies, petty larcenaries; chance-medleys,
or man-flaughters: We doe by this Act of Our Grace, fully and freely acquit and as∣soyle of all such penalties and mulcts, as by the Constitutions and Ordinances of this Kingdome are provided for such offences and offenders. And We doe moreover signifie to all Our loving Subjects, that it shall be lawfull for them or any of them that have so offended, and are thereby liable to the danger of Our Lawes, within the space of three moneths after the publishing this Our Act of Grace and generall pardon, to sue forth his or their pardon, either at Ourt Cour of Kings-bench, or before any of our Iudges at the Assises for the Countie wherein the offender liveth in their circuits; And if any of Our good Sub∣jects be by any impediment hindred from appearing in person to sue out the said par∣don, it shall be lawfull for him to sue out the same by his Atturney, and his said par∣don so sued out, to be of as much validitie as if it had been sued out by himselfe in per∣son: this Our said pardon shall release and acquit any of Our said Subjects from any
punishment of their bodies, or forfeitures of their Estates, which by the Lawes may be required, either in Our raigne, or in the raignes of Our successors. But if Our said Subject so pardoned shall with the like hope of impunity, by reason of Our royall Grace and Favour, presume to commit againe any of the said offences for which hee before was pardoned upon his being lawfully convict; therefore this Our pardon shall be void and of none effect, and his former crime require and be liable to the same penalty or punishment from the Laws that it was before this Our Act of mercy. Given at Our Court at Greenwich, APRIL the 7th. FINIS.
