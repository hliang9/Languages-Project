THocht fenʒeit Fabillis of auld Poetrie, Be nocht all groundit vpon treuth: ʒit than, Thair polite termis of sweit Rhetorie, Richt plesand ar vnto the eir of man. And als the caus, that thay first began, Wes to repreif the haill misleuing Of man, be figure of ane vther thing. ¶In lyke maner, as throw the busteous eird, (Swa it be laubourit with greit diligence) Springis the flouris, and the corne abreird, Hailsum and gude to mannis sustenance. Sa dois spring ane Morall sweit sentence Out of the subtell dyte of Poetrie: To gude purpois quha culd it weill applie. The Nuttis schell thocht it be hard, and teuch, Haldis the Kirnell, and is delectabill. Sa lyis thair ane doctrine wyse aneuch, And full of frute, vnder ane fenʒeit Fabill. And Clerkis sayis, it is richt profitabill, Amangis ernist to ming ane merie sport, To licht the spreit, and gar the tyme be schort. Forther mair, ane Bow that is ay bent, Worthis vnsmart, and dullis on the string. Sa gais the man, that is ay diligent
In ernistfull thochtis, and in studying, With sad materis sum merines to ming. Accordis weill thus Esope said I wis, Dulcius arrident seria picta Iocis. ¶Of this Author my Maisteris with ʒour leif, Submitting me in ʒour correctioun: In Mother toung of Latyne I wald preif, To mak ane mater of Translatioun. Nocht of my self, for vane presumptioun, Bot be requeist, and Precept of ane Lord, Of quhome the Name it neidis not record. In hamelie language and in termis rude, Me neidis wryte: for quhy of Eloquence. Nor Rethorike, I neuer vnderstude. Thairfoir meiklie I pray ʒour reuerence, Gif that ʒe find it throw my negligence, Be deminute, or ʒit superfluous, Correct it at ʒour willis gratious. My Author in his Fabillis tellis ʒow, That brutall beistis spak, and vndrstude. In to gude purpois dispute, and maid argow. In Philosophie propone, and ei conclude. Put in exempill, and in similitude, How mony men in operatioun, Ar lyke to beistis in conditioun. Na meruell is, ane man be lyke ane Beist, Quhilk lufis ay carnall and foull delyte: That schame can not him renʒe, nor arreist, Bot takis all the lust and appetyte, And that throw custum, and daylie ryte.
Syne in thair myndis sa fast is Radicate, That thay in brutall beistis ar transformate. ¶ This Nobill Clerk, Esope, as I haif tauld, In gray vestiment, and in facound purpurate, Be figure wrait his buke: for he nocht wald Lak the wisedome of hie, nor law estait. And to begyn, first of ane Cok he wrait, Seikand his meit, quhilk fand ane Iolie stone, Of quhome the Fabill ʒe sall heir anone. Ane Cok sumtyme with feddrame fresche and gay Richt cant, and Crous, albeit he wes bot pure: Flew furth vpon ane dounghill sone be day, To get his dennar set wes all his cure. Scraipand amang the as, be auenture, He fand ane Iolie Iasp, richt precious, Wes cast in furth in sweping of the hous. As Damysellis wantoun, and Insolent, That fane wald play, and on the streit be sene. To swoping of the hous thay tak na tent. Thay cair na thing, swa that the flure be clene. Iowellis ar tint, as oftymis hes bene sene, Upon the flure, and swopit furth anone. Peraduenture, sa wes the samin stone. Sa meruelland vpon the stane (quod he) O gentill Iasp: O riche and Nobill thing: Thocht I the find, thow ganis not for me. Thow art ane Iowell for ane Lord, or King. Pietie it wer, thow suld ly in this midding, And buryit be thus on this muke on mold, And thow so fair, and worth is mekill gold.
¶It is pietie I suld the find, for quhy, Thy greit vertew, nor ʒit thy cullour cleir, It may me nouther extoll, nor magnifie: And thow to me may mak bot lytill cheir. To greit Lordis thocht thow be leif, and deir, I lufe fer better thing of les auaill, As draf, or corne, to fill my tinne Intraill. I had leuer haif scraipit heir with my naillis, Amangis this mow, and luke my lyfis fude, As draf, or corne, small wormis, or snaillis, Or ony meit wald do my stomok gude: Than of Iaspis ane mekill multitude. And thow agane, vpon the samin wyis, For thyne auaill may me as now despyis. Thow is na corne: and thairof haif I neid. Thy cullour dois bot confort to the sicht. And that is not aneuch my wame to feid. For wyfis sayis, luk and werkis ar licht. I wald haif sum meit, get it gif I micht. For houngrie men may not leif on lukis: Had I dry breid, I compt not for na cukis. Quhar suld thow mak thy habitatioun? Quhar suld thow dwell, bot in ane Royall Tour? Quhar suld thow sit, bot on ane Kingis Croun, Exaltit in worschip and in greit honour? Ryse gentill Iasp, of all stanis the flour, Out of this midding, and pas quhar thow suld be, Thow ganis not for me, nor I for the. Leuand this Iowell law vpon the ground, To seik his meit this Cok his wayis went.
Bot quhen, or how, or quhome be it wes found, As now I set to hald na Argument. Bot of the Inward sentence, and Intent Of this (as myne Author dois write) I sall reheirs in rude and hamelie dite. ¶This Iolie Iasp had properteis seuin: The first, of cullour it wes meruelous: Part lyke the fyre, and part lyke to the heuin. It makis ane man stark and victorious. Preseruis als fra cacis perrillous. Quha hes this stane, sall haif gude hoip to speid, Or fyre, nor watter him neidis not to dreid. MORALITAS. THis gentill Iasp, richt different of hew, Betakinnis perfite prudence and cunning. Ornate with mony deidis of vertew, Mair excellent, than ony tirthlie thing. Quhilk makis men in honour for to Ring. Happie, and stark to wyn the victorie Of all vycis, and Spirituall enemie. Quha may be hardie, riche, and gratious? Quha can eschew perrell and auenture? Quha can Gouerne in ane Realme or hous Without science, ouer all thing I ʒow assure? It is riches that euer sall Indure, Quhilk Maith, nor moyst, nor vthes rust can froit, To mannis Saull it is Eternall mt. This Cok desyrand mair the sempill co, Than ony Iasp, may till ane fule be peir.
Quhilk at science makis bot ane mock and scorne, And na gude ca als lytill will e leir. His hart wammillis wyse argument to beir, As dois ane Sow to uhome men for the nanis In hir draf troch wald saw precious stanis. ¶Quha is enemie to science and cunning, Bot Ignorance, that vnderstandis nocht? Quhil is s Nob s preious, and sa ding, That it may not with eirdlie thing be ocht. Weill war that man ouer all vther that moch All his lyfe dayis in perfite studie wair, To get sien: for him neidis na mair. Bot now (allace) science is tint and hid: We sek it nocht, nor preis it for to find. Haf we riches, na better lyfe we bid, Of science thocht the Saull be bair and blind. Of this mater to peik, it wer bot wind. Thairfoir I ceis, and will na forther say. Ga seik the Iasp, qua will, for thair it lay. ¶FINIS. ¶The Taill of the Uponlandis Mous, and the Burges Mous. ESope myne Author makis mentioun, Of twa Myis, and thay wer Sisteris deir. Of  ye eldest dwelt in ane Borrous to: The vther wnit Uponland well ei: Soliter, quhyle vnder busk, quhyle vnder breir: Quh in the corne, and vther mennis skaith, Is olwi dois and lis on thair waith.
This rurall Mous in to the wynter tyde, Had hunger, cauld, and tholit greit distres, The vther Mous that in the Burgh can byde, Wes Gild brother and maid ane fre Burges. Toll fre als but custum mair or les, And fredome had to ga quhair euer scho list, Amang the cheis in Ark, and meill in kist. Ane tyme quhen sho wes full aud vnfute sair, Scho tuke in mynde hir sister vponland, And langit for to heir of hir welfair, To se quhat lyfe scho had vnder the wand. Bairfute allone with pykestaf in hir hand As pure Pilgryme scho passit out of toun To seik hir sister baith ouer daill and doun. ¶Furth mony wilsum wayis can scho walk, Throw mosse & muir throw bākis blak and breir, Scho ranne with mony ane hiddeous quaik, Cum furth to me my awin Sister deir, Cry peip anis, with that the Mous cryit heir, And knew hir voce as Kinnisman will do Be verray kynd, and furth scho come hir to. The hartlie ioy God gif ʒe had sene, Beis kith quhen that thir Sisteris met, And greit kyndenes wes schawinthame betuene, For quhylis thay leuch, and quhylis for ioy thay gret Quhyle kissit sweit, quhylis in armis plet, And thus thay fure quhill soberit wes thair mind, Syne fute for fute vnto the chalmer wend. As I hard say it was ane sober wane Of fog and fain full fbillie wes maid,
Ane slie scheill vnder ane steidfast stane, Of quhilk the entres wes not hie nor braid. And in the samin thay went but mair abaid, Without fyre or candill birnand bricht, For commounlie sie pykeris lufis not licht. Quhen thay wer lugit thus thir selie Myse, The ʒoungest sister into hir butterie ʒeid, And brocht furth nuttis, and candil in steid of spyce. Gif this wes gude air I do it on thame besyde. The Burges Mous prompit frth in pryde. And said sister is this ʒour daylie fude? Qyhy not (quod scho) is not this meit rycht gude? ¶Na be my faull I think it bot ane scorne. Madame (qod scho) ʒe be the mair to blame, My mother said sister quhen we wer borne, That I and ʒe lay baith within ane wame. I keip the rate and custume of my dame, And of my leuing into pouertie, For landis haif we nane in propertie. My air sister (quod scho) haif me excusi This rude dyet and I can not accord. To tender meit my stomok is ay vsit, For quhylis I fair alsweill as ony Lord. Thir widderit peis, and nuttis or thay be bord Wil back my teith, & mak my wame ful sklender, Quhilk wes befoir vsit to meittis tender. Weill, weill, sister (quod the rurall Mus), Gif it pleis ʒow sie thingis as ʒe se heir, Baih meit and drink, haberie and hous, Slbe ʒour a win will ʒe remane all ʒer.
Ʒe sall it haif with blyith and merie cheir, And that suld mak the maissis that ar rude, Amang freindis richt tender and wonder gude. Quhat plesure is in the Feistis delicate The quhilkis ar geuin with ane glowmād brow? Ane gentillhart is better recreat With blyith curage than seik to him ane Kow. Ane Modicum is mair for till allow, Swa that gude will be keruer at the dais Than thrawin will and mony spycit mais. ¶For all hir merie exhortatioun, This Burges Mous had lytill will to sing. Bot heuilie scho kest hir browis doun For all the daynteis that scho culd hir bring. Ʒit at the last scho said half in hething, Sister, this victuall and ʒour royall feist May weill sufice vnto ane rurall beist. Lat be this hole and cum into my place I sall to ʒow schaw be experience, My gude fryday is better nor ʒour Pace, My dische weschingis is worth ʒour hai expēce, I haif housis anew of greit defence, Of Cat, nor fall trap, I haif na dreid. I grant (quod scho, and on togidder thay ʒeid. In stbbill array throw gers and corne, And vnder buskis preelie couth thay creip, The eldest wes the gyde and vent beforne, The ʒounger to hir wayis tuke gude keip. On nicht thay ran, and on the day can sleip, Quhill in the morning or the Lauerok sang,
Thay and the toun, and in blythlie couth gang. Not fer fra thyne vnto ane worthie vane, This burges brocht thame sone quhar thai suld be. Without God speid thair herberie wes tane In to ane spence with vittell greit plentie, Baith Cheis and Butter vpone thair skelfis hie, And eshe and fishe aneuch of freshe and salt, And sekkis full of meill and eik of malt. ¶Efter quhen thay disposit wer to dyne, Withouttin grace thay weshe and went to meit. With all coursis that Cukis culd deuyne, Muttoun and beif strikin in tailʒeis greit. Ane Lordis fair thus couth thay counterfeit, Except ane thing thay drank the watter cleir, In steid of wyne bot ʒit thay maid gude cheir. With blyith vpcast and merie countenance, The eldest Sister sperit at hir gaist. Gif that scho be ressone fand difference, Betuix that chalmer and hir sarie nest. Ʒe dame (quod scho) how lang will this lest? For euermair I wait and langer to. Gif it be swa ʒe ar at eis (quod scho). Til eik thair cheir ane subcharge furth scho brocht, Ane plait of grotis, and ane dische full of meill Thraf caikkis als I trow scho spairit nocht, Aboundautlie about hir for to to deill. And mane full yne scho brocht in steid of geill, And ane quhyte candill out of ane coffer stall, In steid of spyce to gust thair mouth withall. This maid thay merie quhil thay micht na mair,
And haill Ʒule haill cryit vpon hie Ʒit efter ioy oftymes cummis cair, And troubill efter greit prosperitie, Thus as thay sat in all thair iolitie, The spenser come with keyis in his hand, Oppinnit the dure and thame at denner fand. ¶ Thay taryit not to wesche as I suppose, Bot on to ga quha that micht formest win. The Burges had ane hole, and in scho gois, Hir sister had na hole to hyde hir in, To se that selie Mous it wes greit sin So desolate and will of ane gude reid, For verray dreid scho fell in swoun neir deid. Bot as God wald it fell ane happy cace, The Spenser had na laser for to byde. Nouther to seik nor serche, to sker nor chace, Bot in he went, and left the dure vp wyde. The bald Burges his passing weill hes spyde, Out of hir hole scho come, and cryit on hie. How fair ʒe sister cry peip quhair euer ʒe be. This rurall Mous lay flatling on the ground And for the deith scho wes full sair dredand. For till hir hart straik mony wofuls stound, As in ane feuer scho trimbillit fute and hand. And quhan hir sister in sic ply hir fand, For verray pietie scho began to greit, Syne confort hir with wordis hnmbill & sweit. Quhy ly ʒe thus ryse vp my sister deir? Cum to ʒour meit, this perrell is ouerpast. The vther answerit hir with heuie cheir,
I may not eit sa sair I am agast. I had euer hi fourtie day is fast, With watter caill and to gnaw benis or peis, Than all ʒour feist in this dreid and diseis. ¶ With fair tretie ʒit scho gart hir vpryse, And o the burde thay went and togidder sat, And scantlie had thay drunkin anis or twye, Quhen in come G hunter our Iolie Cat, And bad God speid, the Burges vp with that, And till the hole scho went as fyre on flint, Bawdronis the vther be the bak hes hint. Fra fute to fute he kest hir to and fra, Quhylis vp, quhylis doun, als cant as ony Kid. Quhylis wald e lat hir in vnder the stra, Quhylis wald he wink, and play with hir buk heid. Thus to the selie Mous greit pane he did. Qhill at the last throw fortune and gude hap, Betuix ane burde and the wall scho crap. And vp in haist behind ane partalling, Scho clam so hie that Gilbert micht not get hir. Syne be the cluke thair craftelie can hing, Till he wes gane hir cheir wes all the better. Syne doun scho lap quhen thair wes nane to let hir. And to the Burges Mous loud can scho cry, Fairweill sister thy Feist heir I dey. Thy mangerie is mingit all with cair, Thy guse is gude thy gansell four as gall. The subcharge of thy seruice is bot sat, Sa sall thow find heir eterwart na faill. I thank ʒone courtyne and ʒone perpall wall
Of my defence now fra ane crewell beist. Almychtie God keip me fra sic ane Feist. ¶Wer I into the kith that I come fra, For weill nor wo, suld neuer cum agane. With that scho tuke hir leif and furth can ga, Quhylis throw the corne, & quhylis throw the plant Quhen scho wes furth and fre scho wes ful fane. And merili markit vnto the mure. I can not tell how weill thairefter scho fure. ¶Bot I hard say scho passit to hir den, Als warme als weill suppose it wes not greit, Full beinly stuffit, baith but and ben Of Beinis, and Nuttis, Peis, Ry, and Quheit. Quhen euer scho list scho had aneuch to eit, In quyet and eis withoutin ony dreid, Bot to hir sisteris feist na mair scho ʒeid. MORALITAS. FReindis ʒe may find and ʒe will tak heid, Into this fabill ane gude moralitie. As fitchis myngit at with nobill seid, Swa intermynglit is aduersitie, And als troubill, and sum vexatioun, With eirthlie ioy, swa that na estait is fre, That ar not content of small possessioun, And namelie thay quhilk climinis vp maist hie. Blissit be empill lyfe withoutin dreid. Blissit be sober feist in quietie. Quha hes aneuch of na mair hes he neid, Thocht it be lytill into quantitie. Greit aboundance and blind prosperitie, Oymes mais ane euill conclusioun.
The sweitest lyfe thairfoir in this cuntrie, Is sickernes with small possessioun. ¶Thy awin fyre my freind, sa it be bot ane gleid, It warmis weill, and is worth Gold to the. And Solomon sayis gif that thow will reid, Under the henin it can not better be, Than ay be blyith and leif in honestie. Quhairfoir I may conclude be this ressoun, Of eirthly ioy it beiris maist degre. Blyithnes in hart with small possessi ¶FINIS. ¶The Taill of Schir Chantecleir and the Foxe. THocht brutall beistis be Irrationabill, That is to say want and iscretioun. Ʒit ilk ane in thair kynde naturall Hes mony diuers inclinatioun. The Bair busteous, the Uolf: the ylde Lyoun: The Foxe sem is craftie and cautelous: The Dog to bark on nicht and keip the hous. Sa different thay ar in properteis, Unknawin to man, and sa infinite, In kynd huand sa fell diuersiteis. My cunning is excludit for to dyte. For thy as now I purpose for to wryte. Ane cais I fand quhilk fell this ather ʒeir, Betuix ane oxe, and ane gentill Chantecleir. ¶ Wedow dwelt, in till ane drop thay dayis, ilk wan hir fude of spinning on hi . na mai had  as the Fabill sayis,
Except of hennis scho had ane lytill flok, And thame to keip scho had ane iolie Cok: Richt curageous, that to this wedow ay Deuydit nicht, and crew befoir the day. ¶Ane lytill fra this foirsaid Wedowis hous, Ane thornie schaw thair wes of greit defence. Quhairin ane Foxe craftie, and cautelous, Maid his repair, and daylie residence. Quhilk to this Wedow did greit violence, In pyking of pultrie baith day and nicht, And na way be reuengit on him scho micht. This wylie Tod quhen that the Lark couh sing, Full sair hungrie vnto the Toun him drest, Quhair Chantecleir in to the gray dawing, Werie for nicht wes flowin fra his nest. Lowrence this saw, and in his mynd he kest, The Ieperdie, the wayis, and the wyle, Be quhat menis he micht this Cok begyle. Disimuland in to countenance and cheir, On kneis fell, and simuland this he said. Gude morne my maister gentill Chantecleir. With that the Cok start bakwart in ane braid. Schir be my Saull, ʒe neid not be effrayit, Nor ʒit for me to start nor fle abak, I come bot heir seruice to ʒow to mak. Wald I not serue to ʒow it wer bot blame, As I haf done to ʒour progenitoris. Ʒour Father full oft fillit hes my wame, And send me meit fra midding to the muris. And at his end I did my besie curis,
To hald his heid, and kis warme. Syne at the last the Sweit swell in my arme. ¶ Knew ʒe my Father od the Cok) and leuch. Ʒea my fair Sone, I held vp his heid, Quhen that he dit vnder ane birkin beuch. Syne said the Dirige quhen that he wes deid, Betuix vs twa how suld thair be ane feid? Quhame suld ʒe traist bot me ʒour Seruitour, That to ʒour Father did sa greit honour. Quhen I behald ʒour fedderis fair and gent, Ʒour beik, ʒour breist, ʒour hekill, and ʒour came. Schir be my Saull, and the blissit Sacrament, My hart is warme me think I am at hame, To mak ʒow blyith, I wald creip on my wame In froist and snaw in wedder wan and weit And lay my lyart loikkis vnder ʒour feit. This fenʒeit Foxe fals and dissimulate, Maid to this Cok ane cauillatioun. Ʒe ar me think changit and degenerate Fra ʒour Father of his conditioun, Of craftie crawing he micht beir the Croun, For he wald on his tais stand and craw. This wes na le, I stude besyde and saw. With that the Cok vpon his tais hie, Kest vp his beik, and sang with all his micht. (Quod Schir Lowrence) weill said sa mot I the. Ʒe ar ʒour Fatheris Sone and air vpricht. Bot of his cunning ʒit ʒe want ane slicht. For (quod the Tod) he wald and haif na dout, Baith wink, and craw, and turne him thryis about.
The Cok infect with wind and fals vaneglo, That mony puttis vnto confusoun. Traisting to win ane greit worschip thairfoir, Unwarlie winkand wawlad vp and doun, And syne to chant and craw he maid him boun. And suddandlie be he had crawin ane note, The Foxe wes war, and hint him be the throte. ¶Syne to the woid but tarie with him hyit, Of that cryme haifand bot lytill dout. With that Pertok, Sprutok, and Toppok cryit. The Wedow cryit, and with ane cry come out. Seand the cace scho sichit and gaif ane schout. How murther hay with ane hiddeous beir, Allace now lost is gentill Chantecleir. As scho wer woid, with mony ʒell and cry, Ryuand hir hair vpon hir breist can beit, Syne paill of hew half in ane extasie, Fell doun for cair in swoning, and in sweit. With that the selie hennis left thair meit. And quhill this wyfe wes lyand thus in swoun, Fell in that cace in disputatioun. Allace (quod Pertok) makand sair murning, With teiris greit attour hir cheikis fell. Ʒone wes our drowrie, and our dayis darling, Our Nichingaill, and als our Olege bell. Our walkryfe watche vs for to warne and tell, Quhen that Aurora with hir curcheis gray, Put vp hir heid betuix the nicht and day. Quha sall our Lemman be? quha sall vs leid? Quhen we ar sad quha sall vnto vs sing?
With his sweit Bill he wald brek vs the bred In all this warld wes thair ane kynder thing. In paramouris he wald do vs plesing At his power as nature did him geif. Now fter him allace how sall we leif? ¶Quod Sprutok than, Ceis sister of ʒour sorrow Ʒe be to mad for him sic murning mais. We sall fair weill, I find Sanct Iohne to borrow, The Prouerb sayis, als gude lufe cummis as gais. I will put on my haly dayis claithis, And mak me fresche agane this Iolie May, Syne chant this sang wes neuer Wedow sa gay. He wes angrie and held vs ay in aw, And woundit with the spir of Ielowsie. Of chalmerglew Pertok, full weill ʒe knaw Waistit he wes, of Nature cauld and dry. Sen he is gone thairfoir Sister say I, Be blyith in baill, for that is best remeid. Let quik to quik, and deid ga to the deid. Than Pertok spak, with fenʒeit faith befoir In lust but lufe he set all his delyte. Sister ʒe wait of sic as him ane scoir Wald not suffice to flaik our appetyte. I hecht be my hand sen he is quyte, Within ane oulk for schame, and I durst speik, To get ane berne suld better claw my breik. Than Toppok lyke ane Curate spak full crous, Ʒone wes ane verray vengeance from the heuin. He wes sa lous, and sa lecherous. He had (quod scho) Kittokis ma than seuin.
Bot rychteous God haldand the balandis euin, Smytis richt sair thocht he be patient For Adulterie, that will thame not repent. ¶Prydefull he wes, and ioyit of his sin, And comptit not for Goddis fauour nor feid. Bot traistit ay to rax, and sa to rin, Quhill at the last his sinnis can him leid To schamefull end, and to ʒone suddand deid. Thairfoir it is the verray hand of God, That causit him be werryit with the Tod. Quhen this wes said, this Wedow fra hir swoun Start vp on fute, and on hir kennettis cryit. How berk Berrie, Bausie, Broun, Rype schaw, Rin weill, Curtes, Nuttieclyde, Togidder all but grunching furth ʒe glyde, Reskew my Nobill Cok or he be slane, Or ellis to me se ʒe cum neuer agane. With that but baid thay braidit ouer the bent, As fyre of flint thay ouer the feildis aw, Full wichtlie thay throw woid and watteris went, And ceissit not schir Lowrence quhill thay saw. Bot quhen he saw the Kennettis cum on raw, Unto the Cok in mynd he said, God sen That I and thow wer fairlie in my den. Than said the Cok with sum gude Spirit inspyri Do my counsall and I sall warrand the. Hungrie thow art, and for greit trauell tyrit, Richt faint of force, and may not ferther e. Swyith turne agane, and say, that I and ʒe Freindis ar maid, and fellowis for ane ʒeir.
Than will thay stint, I stand for it and not steir. ¶This Tod thochte wes fals and friuolous, And had freindis his querrell to defend, Desauit wes be menis richt meruelous. For falset failʒeis ay at the latter end. He start about, and cryit as he wes kend. With that the Cok he braid out of the beuch. Now Iuge ʒe all quhairat Schir Lowrence leuch. Begylit thus the Tod vnder the tre On kneis fell, and said gude Chantecleir. Cum doun agane, and I but meit or fey Salbe ʒour man and seruand for ane ʒeir.

LEif we this Wedow glaid I ʒow assure Of Chantecleir, mair blyith than I can tell. And speik we of the subtell auenture. And destenie that to this Foxe befell, Quhilk durst na mair with waiting Intermell
Als lang as leme or licht wes of the day, Bot byd and nicht full still lurkand he lay. ¶Quhill that the Goddes of the flude Phebus had callit to the harberie. And Hesperus put vp his cluddie heid, Schawand his lustie wisage in the sky. Than Lowrence luikit vp, quhair he couth ly, And kest his hand vpon his Ee on hicht, Merie and glaid that cummit wes the nicht. Out of the wod vnto ane hill he went, Quhair he micht se the tuinkling sternis cleir. And all the Planetis of the firmament, Thair cours, and eik thair mouing in the Spheir. Sum Retrograde, and sum Stationer. And of the Zodiak in quhat degre Thay wer ilk ane, as Lowrence leirnit me. Than Saturne auld wes enterit in Capricorne, And Iuppiter mouit in Sagittarie. And Mars vp in the Rammis heid wes borne. And Phebus in the Lyoun furth can carie. Uenus the Crab, the Mone wes in Aquarie, Mercurius the God of Eloquence Into the Uirgyn maid his residence. But Astrolab, Quadrant, or Almanak, Teichit of nature be Instructioun, The mouing of the heuin this Tod can tak, Quhat influence and Constellatioun Wes lyke to fall vpon the eirth adoun. And to him self he said withouttin mair, Weill worth my Father, that send me to the lai.
¶My destenie, and eik my weird I ken, My auentour is cleirlie to me kend. With mischeif myngit is my mortall Ene, My misleuing the soner bot gif I mend. It is rewiard o sin ane schamefull end. Thairfoir I will ga seik sum Confessour, And schryit me clene of my sinnis to this hour. Allace (quod he) richt waryit ar we theifis. Our lyifis set ilk nicht in auenture. Our cursit craft full mony man mischeuis, For euer we steill, and euer ar lyke pure. In dreid and schame our dayis we Indure. Syne widdinek, and Crakraip callit als, And till our hyre hangit vp be the hals. Accusand thus his cankerit conscience, In to ane Craig he kest about his Ee. So saw he cummand ane lytill than from hence, Ane worthie Doctour in diuinitie Freir Uolf Uaitskaith in science wonder sle. To preiche and pray wes new cūmit fra the Cloister, With Beidis in hand sayand his Pater noster. Seand this Uolf this wylie tratour Tod On kneis fell, with hude in to his nek. Welcome my Goistlie Father vnder God, (Quod he) with mony binge and mony bek. Ha (quod the Uolf) Schir Tod for quha effek Mak ʒe sic feir, ryse vp put on ʒour hude? Father (quod he) I haif greit cause o dude. Ʒe ar Mirrour, Lanterne, and sicker way, Suld gyde sic sempill folk as me to grace.
Ʒour bair feit, and ʒour Russet Cowll of gray, Ʒour lene cheik, ʒour paill pieteous face, Schawis to me ʒour perfite halines. For weill wer him that anis in his lyue Had hap to ʒow his sinnis for to schryue. ¶Na selie Lowrence (quod the Uolf) and leuch, It plesis me that ʒe ar penitent. Of reif and stouth, Schir, I can tell aneuch, That causis me full sair for to repent. Bot Father byde still heir vpon the bent, I ʒow beseik, and heir me to declair My conscience, that prikkis me sa sair. Weill (quod the Uolf) sit doun vpon thy kne. And he doun bair heid sat full humillie. And syne began with Benedicite. Quhen I this saw, I drew ane lytill by. For it effeiris nouther to heir, nor spy, Nor to reueill thing said vnder that seill, Unto the Tod this Gait the Uolf couth tell. Art thow contrite, and sorie in thy Spreit For thy Trespas? Na Schir, I can not doid, Me think that hennis ar sa honie sweit, And Lambis flesche that new ar lettin bluid, For to repent my mynd can not concluid, Bot of this thing, that I haif slane sa few. Weill (quod the Uolf) in faith thow art ane schrew Sen thow can not forthink thy wickitnes, Will thow forbeir in tyme to cum, and mend. And I forbeir, how sall I leif allace? Haifand nane vther craft me to defend.
Neid causis me to steill quhair euer I wend. I eschame to thig, I can not wirk ʒe wait. Ʒit wald I fane pretend to gentill stait. ¶Weill (quod the Uolf) thow wātis pointis tw Belangand to perfyte Confessioun. To the thrid part of penitence let vs ga, Will thow tak pane for thy transgressioun? Na Schir considder my Complexioun, Selie and waik, and of my Nature tender, Lo, will ʒe se, I am baith lene and sklender. Ʒit neuertheles I wald swa it wer licht, Schort and not greuand to my tendernes, Tak part of pane, fulfill it gif I micht, To set my selie Saull in way of grace. Thow sall (quod he) forbeir flesche vntill Pasche, To tame this Corps that cursit Carioun. And heir I reik the full Remissioun. I grant thairto, swa ʒe will gif me leif, To eit puddingis, or laip ane lytill blude, Or heid, or eit, or paynchis let me preif. In cace I falt of flesche in to my fude. For greit mister I gif the leif to dude, Twyse in the ulk, for neid may haif na Law. God ʒeild ʒow Schir, for that Text weill I knaw Quhen this wes said, the Uolf his wayis went. The Foxe on sute he fure vnto the flude, To fang him fische hailleli wes his intent. Bot quhen he saw the watter, and wallis wod, Astonist all still in to ane stair he stude. Ad said, better that I had biddin at hame,
Nor bene ane Fischar in the Deuillis Name. ¶ Now man I scraip my meit out of the sand, And I haif nouthr boittis, nor ʒit Net. As he ws thus for falt of meit munand, Luk and about his leuing fr to get. Under ane tre he saw ane trip of Gait. Than wes he blyith, aud in ane heuch him hid, And fra the Gait he stall ane lyill Kid. ¶Syne ouer the heuch vnto the see he hyis, And tuke the Kid be the hornis twane, And in the watter outher twyis or thryis He dowkit him, and till him can he sayne. Ga doun Schir Kid, cū vp Schir Salmond agane. Quhill he wes deid syne to the land him dreuch, And of that new maid Salmond eit aneuch. Thus fynelie fillit with ʒoung tender meit, Unto ane derne for dreid he him addrest, Under ane busk, quhair that the sone can beit. To beik his breist and vellie he thocht best. And rekleslie he said quhair he did rest, Straikand his wame aganis the sonis heit, Upon this wame set wer ane bolt full meit. Quhen this wes said the keipar of the Gait, Cairfull in hart his Kid wes stllin away, On euerilk sydefull warlie couth he wait, Quhill at the last, he saw quhair Lowrence lay. Ane Bow he bet, ane flane with fddris gray, He haillit to the hed and or he steird, The Foxe he prikkit fast vnto the eird.
¶Now (quod the Foxe) allace, and wellaway. Gorrit I am, and may na forther gang. Me think na man may spik ane word in play, Bot now on dayis, in ernist it is ane. He harlit him, and out he drew his flane. And for his Kid, and vther violnce, He tuke his syn, and maid ane rcompence. MORALITAS. THis suddand deith, and vnprouysit end Of this fals Tod, without prouisioun, Exempill is exhortand folk to amend, For dreid of sic ane lyke confusiun. For mony now hes gude profssioun, Ʒit not repentis, nor for thair sinnis greit, Because hay think thair lustie lyfe sa weit. Sum bene also throw consuetude and ryte, Uincust with carnall sensualitie. Suppose thay be as for the tyme contryte, Can not forbir, nor fra thair sinnis fle. Use drawis Nature swa in propertie Of beist and man, tha nidlingis thay man do, As thay o lang tyme es bene hantit to. Be war gude folk and feir this suddane schoit, Quhilk smyis sair withouttin resistence. Atend wyse, and in ʒou hartis non, Aganis dith may na man mak defence.

¶The Taill of the Sone and Air of the foirsa Foxe, callit Fatherwer: Alswa the Par∣liament of fourfuttit Beistis, haldin be the Lyoun. THis foirsaid Foxe, that deit for his misdeid, Had not ane barne wes gottin richteouslie, Till airschip be Law that micht succeid, Except ane Sone, quhilk in Adulterie He gottin had in purches priuelie. And till his Name wes callit Fatherwar, That lufit weill with pultrie to tig and tar. It followis weill be resoun naturall, And gre be gre, of richt comparisoun: Of euill cummis war: of war cummis werst of all Of wrangous geir cummis fals possessioun. This Foxe Bastard of generatioun, Of verray kynde behufit to be fals. Swa wes his Father, and his Grandschir ls. As Nature will seikand his mit be sent, Of cae he fand his Father is Carioun, Nakit, new slane, and till him hes he went, Tuke vp his heid, and on his kne fell doun, Thankand greit God of that conclusioun. And said, now sall I bruke sen I am air, The boundis quhair thow wes wont or to repair. Fy Coetice vnkynd, and venemous. The Sone wes fane he fand his Father deid, Be suddand scht, for deidis odious, That he micht regne, and raxe in till his steid. Dreid and na thin the  lyfe to leid,
In thift, and reif, as did his Father befoir Bot to the end attent he tuke no moir. ¶ Ʒit neuertheles throw Naturall pietie, The Carioun vpon his bak he ais. Now find I weill this Prouerb trew (quod he) Ay rinnis the Foxe, als lang as he fute has. Syne with the Corps vnto ane peitpoit gais, Of watter full, and kest him in the deip. And to the Deuill he gai his banis to keip. O fulische man plungit in warldlines, To conqueis warldlie gude, gold, and rent. To put thy Saull in pane, or huines, To riche thy ar, quhilk efter thow art went, Haif he thy gude, he takis bot small tent. To execute, to do, to satisfie, Thy letter will, thy det, and legacie. ¶This Tod to rest him, he passt to ane Craig, And thair he hard ane buisteous Bugill blaw. Quhilk as he thocht, maid all the warld to wag. Ane Unicorne come lansand ouer ne Law. Than start he vp, quhe he this hard and law, With horne in hand, ane bill in brist he bure. Ane Pursephant semelie I ʒow assure. Unto ane bank quhair he micht se about, On euerilk syde in haist he culd him hy. Schot out his voce, full schill, and gaif ane schout. And on this wyis twyse, or thryse did cry. With that the beistis in the feild thairby, All merueland, quha sic ane thing fld mene. Greitlie agast thay gadderit on ane greue.
¶Out of his buist ane bill sone can he brad, And red the Text withouttin tarying. Commandad silnce, sadlie thus he said. The Nobill Lyoun, of all beistis the King, Greting to Gd hlth eurlesting. To brutall beistis, and Irrationall, I send, as to my subiectis greit and small. My Celsitude, and hie magnificence, Lattis ʒow to wit, that euin incontinent, Thinkis the morne with Royall diligence, Uon this hill to hald ae Parliament. Straitlie thairfoir I gf commandement, For to compeir befoir my Tribunall, Uder all pane, and perrell that may fall. ¶Te mrow come, and Phebus with his bemis Conuit had the mistie cluddis gray. The groun wes grene, and als as gold it glemis, Wth gers grow and gudelie, greit, and gay. The spyce thay sred to spring on euerilk spray. The Lark, the Meis, and the Merl full hie. Sweitlie can sing creip and fra tre to tre. The Leopardis come with Croun of massie gold, Birand thay brocht vnto that hillis hicht, With Iaspis Ionit, and Royall Rubeis rold, And mony diueris Dyamontis dicht, With powis proud ane Palʒeoun doun thay picht. And in that Throne, thair sat ane wild Lyoun, In Rob Royal, with Sceptour, Swerd, & Croun. Efter the tennour of the cry befoir, That gais on all fourfuttit beistis in irth.
As thay commandit wer withouttin moir, Befoir thair Lord the Lyoun thay appeirit. And quhat thay wer to me as Lowrence leirit. I sall reheirs ane part of euerilk kynd, Als fer as now occurris to my mynd. The Minotaur, ane Monster meruelous, Bellerophont that beist of Bastardrie. The Warwolf, and the Pegase perillous, Transformit be assent o sorcerie. The Linx the Tiger full of Tirannie: The Elephant: and eik the Dromedarie: The Cameill with his Cran nek furth can carie. ¶The Leopard, as I haif tauld beforne: The Anteloip: the Sparth furth couth speid: The payntit Pantheir: and the Unicorne: The Rayndeir Ran throw Reueir, Roe, and Reid. The Iolie Gillet, and the gentill Steid: The Asse: the Mule: the Hors of euerilk kynd, The Da: the Ra: the hornit Hart: the Hynd. The Bull: the Beir: the Bugill: and the Bair: The Tame Cat: Uildcat: & the Uildwod Swyne: The Hardbakkit Hurcheoun: and the Hirplād Hair: Baith Otter, and Aip: and Pennit Porcupyne: The Gukit Gait: the selie Scheip: the Swyne: The wyld Once: the Buk: the Ulteran Brok: The Fowmart, with the Fibert furth can flok. The gray Grewhound, with Sleuthoūd furth can slyde, With Doggis all diuers and different. The Ratoun ran, the Glebard furth can glyde. The quhrynand Quhitret, with the Quhaisill went,

The Mertrik: with the Cunning: and the Con: The Bouranbane: and eik the Lerioun. ¶The Marmysset: the Mowdewaxt couth leid, Because that Nature denyit had hir sicht. Thus dressit thay all furth, for dreid of deid, The Muk, the lytill Mous with all hir micht, With haist scho haikit vnto that hill of hicht. And mony kynd of beistis I couth not knaw, Besoir thair Lord the Lyoun thay loutit law. Seing thir beistis all at his bidding boun, He gaif ane braid, and lukit him about. Than flatlingis to his feit thay fell all doun, For dreid of deith, thay droupit all in dout. He lukit quhen that he saw thame lout, And bad thame with ane countenance full sweit, Be not effeirit, bot stand vp on ʒour feit. I let ʒow wit, my micht is merciabill, And steiris nane that ar to me prostrait. Angrie, austerne, and als vnamyabill, To all that standray ar to myne estait. I rug, I reif, all beistis that makis debait. Aganis the micht of my Magnificence, Se nane pretend to pryde in my presence. My Celsitude, and my hie Maiestie, With micht, and mercie myngit all be ay. The lawest hart I can full sone vp hie, And mak him maister ouer ʒow all I may. The Dromedarie gif he will mak deray, The greit Cameill, thochthe wer neuer sa rous,
I can him law als lytill as ane Mous. ¶Se neir be twentie mylis quhair I am, The Kid ga saiflie be the gaittis syde. The Tod Lowrie luke not to the lam. Na reuand beistis nouther Ryn, nor ryde. Thay couchit all efter that this wes cryde. The Iustice bad the Court for to gar fence, The sutis callit, and foirfalt all absence. The Panther with his payntit Coit Armour Fensit the Court, as of the Law effeirit. Than Tod Lowrie lukit quhair he couth lour, And start on fute, all stonist and all steird, Ryifand his hair, he cryit with ane reird, Quaikand for dreid, and sichand couth he say, Allace this hour, allace this dulefull day. I wait this suddand Semblie that I se, Haifand the pointis of ane Parliament, Is maid to mar sic misdoaris as me. Thairfoir gif I me schaw I will be schent, I will be socht, and I be red absent. To byde, or fle, it makis not remeid, All is alyke, thair followis not bot deid. Perplexit thus in his hart can he mene, Throw falset how he micht him self defend. His Hude he drew laich attour his Ene, And winkand with ane Eye furth he wend. Clinscheand he come, that he micht not be kend, And for dreddour that he suld bene arreist, He playit bukhude behind, fra beist to beist.
¶O fylit Sprit, and cankerit Conscience, Bfoir ane Roy Renʒeit with rchteousnes, Blakinit cheikis, and schamefull countenance. Farwill thy fame defylit for ay is, The Phnmie, the auour of thy face, For thy defence is foull and disfigurate, Brecht to the licht blasit, blunt, and blait. Be thow atteichit with thift, or with tressoun, For thy misdeid wrangous, and wickit fay. Thy their changis Lowrence thou man luke doun, Thy worschip of this warld is went away.

Ga make ane message sone vnto that Stude, The Court than cryit, now see quha sall it be, Cum urth Lowrie lrkand vnder thy hude, Aa Schir, mercie, lo I haifbot ane Ee, Hurt in the heid, and cruikit as ʒe may se. The Uolf is better in Ambassatrie, And mair cunning in Clergie fer than I. Rampand he said, gafurth brybouris aith. And thay to ga withouttin tarying,
Ouer Ron and Rute thay xan togidder raith, Ad and the Mir at hir meit in the morning. Now (quod th Tod Madame cum to the King, The Court is callit, and ʒe ar Contumax, Let be Lowrence (quod scho) ʒour Courtlie Knax. ¶Maistres (quod he) cum to the Court ʒe mon, The Lyoun hes commandit so in deid. Schir Tod tak ʒe the Flyrdome, and the Fon, I haif respite ane ʒeir, and ʒe will reid. I can not spell (quod he) sa God me speid, Heir is the Uolf, ane Nobill Clerk at all, And of this Message is maid principall. He is Autentik, and ane man of age, And hes greit practik of the Chancellarie. Let him ga luke, and reid ʒour Priuilege, And I sail stand, and beir witnes ʒow by. Quhair is thy Respite (quod the Uolf) in hy? Schir it is heir vndr my hufe weill hid. Hald vp thy heill (quod he) and so scho did. Thocht he ws blindit with pryde, ʒit he presumis To luke oun law, quhair that hir letter lay. With that the Meir gird him vpou the gumis, Ad straik the hattrll of his heid away, Half out of lyif thair lenand doun he lay. Allace (quod Lowrence) Lupe, thow art loist. His cunning (quod the Meir) wes worth sum coist. Lowrence (quod scho) wil thow luke on my letter, Sen that the Uolf na thing thair of can wyn? Na be Sanc Bryde (quod he) me think it better, To sleip in haill, nor in an hurt skyn.
Ane skrow I fand, and this wes writtin in, For fiue schillingis I wald no anis forfault him, Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum. ¶With brokin skap, and bludie cheikis reid, This wretchit Uolf weipand, thus on he went, Of his menʒe markand to get remeid, To tell the King the cace wes his Intent. Schir (quod the Tod) byde still vpon this bent, And fra ʒour bro wis wesche away the blude. And tak ane drink, for it will do ʒow gude. To feche watter this frandfull Foxe furth fure, Sydelingis abak he socht vnto ane slyke. On cace he meittis cummand fra the mure, Ane Trip of Lambis dansand on ane dyke. This Tratour Tod, this Tirrane, and this Tyke, The fattest of this flock, he fellit hais. And eit his fill, syne to the Uolf he gais. Thay drank togidder, & syne thair Iourney takis, Befoir the King, syne kneillit on thair kne. Quhair is ʒone Meir, Schir Tod, wes Contumax? Than Lowrence said, my Lord, speir not at me. Speir at ʒour Doctour of Diuinitie, With his reid Cap can tell ʒow weill aneuch. With that the Lyoun, and all the laif thay leuch. Tell on the cais, now Lowrence let vs heir. This wittie Uolf (quod he) this Clerk of age, On ʒour behalf he bad the Meir compeir. And scho allegit to ane priuilege, Cum neir, and se, and ʒe sall haif ʒour wage. Because he red hir respite plane and weill,
Ʒone reid Bonat scho raucht him with hir he. ¶The Lyoun said, be ʒone reid Cap I ken, This Taill is trew, quha tent vnto it takis. The greitest Clerkis ar not the wysest men. The hurt of ane happie the vther makis. As thay wer carpand in this cais, and Knakis, And all the Court in merines and in gam. Swa come the Ʒow the Mother of the Lam. Befoir the Iustice on hir kneis fell, Put out hir playnt on this wyis wofullie. This harlet huresone, and this hound of hell. Deuorit hes my Lamb full doggitlie, Within ane myle, in contrair to ʒour cry. For Goddis lufe, my Lord, gif me the Law Of this lurker, with that Lowrence let draw.

The Iustice bad ga cheis ane Assyis about. And so thay did, and and that he wes fals Of Murther, thilt, pyking, and tressoun als.
¶Thay band him fast, the Iustice bad belif To git the dome, and tak of all his claithis. The Uolf that new maid Doctour couth him schryif, Syne furth him led and to the Gallous gais, And at the ledder fute his leif he tais. The Aip wes Boucher, and bad him sone ascend. And hangit him, and thus he maid his end. MORALITAS.

The Foxe wes Clerk, and Noter in the cause. The Gled, the Graip at the Bar couth stand,
As Aduocatis expert in to the Lawis, The Doggis pley togidder tuke on hand, Quhilk wer confidderit straitlie in ane band, Aganis the Scheip to procure the sentence. Thocht it was fals thay had n conscience. ¶The Clerk callit the Scheip, and he wes thair. The Aduocatis on this wyse couth propone. Ane certane breid, worth fyue schilling or mair, Thow aw the Doig, of quhilk the terne is gone. Of his a win held but Aduocate allone, The Scheip ysitlie gaif answer in the cace. Heir I declyne the Iuge, the tyme, the place. This is my cause, in motiue and effect. The Law sayis, it is richt perrillous, Till enter in ply befoir ane Iuge suspect. And ʒe Schir Ulf, hes bene richt odious To me, for with ʒour Tusis rauenous. Hs slane full mony Kinnsmen of myne. Tharfoir Iuge, as suspect, I ʒow declyne. And schortlie, of this Court ʒe memberis all, Baith Assssouis, Clerk, and duocae, To me, and myne ar enemeis mortall, And ay hes bene, thoch I mycht not it lat. The place is er, the tyme is insperae. Quhairfoir na Iuge suld sit in Consistorie, Sa lait at euin, I ʒow accuse for thy. Quhen that the Iuge on this wyse wes accusit, He ad the pareis heis with ane assent, Twa Arbiteris, as in the Law is vsit, For to declair, and gif Arbitrement,
Qubidder the scheip suld answer in Iugement, Befoir the Uolf: and so thay did but weir, Of quhome the Namis efterwart ʒe sall heir. ¶The Beir, the Brok, the mater tuke on hand, For to dcyde, gif this exceptioun Wes of na strenth, nor lauchfullie mycht stand. And thairupon as Iugis thay sat doun, And held ane lang quhle disputatioun, Seikand full mony Decretis of the Law, And Glosis als, the veritie to knaw. Of Ciuile Law volumis full mony thay reuolue, The Codies, and Digestes new and ald. Contrait, Prostrait Argumentis thay resolue. Sum obiecting, and sum can hald. For prayer, or price, trow ʒe that thay wald fald? Bot had the glose, and Text of the Decreis, As trew Iugis. I beschrew thame ay that leis. Schortlie to mak ane end of this debait, The Arbiteris than did sweir full plane. The sentence gaif, and proces fulminat, The Scheip suld pas befoir the Uolf agane, And end his pley. Than wes he nathing fane, For fra thair sentence couth he not appeill. On Clerkis I do it, gif this sentence wes leill. ¶The Scheip agane befoir the Uolf deit, But Aduocate abasitlie couth stand. Up ais the doig, and on the Scheip thus plenʒeit, Ane soume I payit haf bt the hand, For certane breid thairto ae Borrow he fand. That wrangoslie the Scheip did had the breid,
Quhilk he denyit: and thair began the pleid. ¶And quhen the Scheip this stuf had contestait, The Iustice in the cause furth can proceid. Lowrence the actis, and the proces wrait, And thus the pley vnto the end thay speid. This Cursit Court corruptit all for meid, Aganis gude faith, Law, and ik conscience, For this fals Doig pronuncit the sentence. And it till put to executioun, The Uolf chargit the Scheip without delay, Under the panis of Interdictioun, The soume of siluer, or the breid to pay. Of this sentnce (allace) quhat sall I say? Quhilk dampnit hes the selie Innocent, And Iustifyit the wrangous Iugement. The Scheip dreidand mair executioun, Obeyand to the sentence, he couth tak His way vnto ane Merchand of th Toun, And sauld the wo, that he bure on his bak. Syne bocht the brid, and to the Doig couh mak Reddie payment as it commandit wa. Nakit and bair yne to the feild couth pas. MORALITAS. THis selie Scheip may present the figure, Of pure commounis that daylie is opprest, Be Tirrane men, quhilkis settis all thair cure, Be fals menis, to mak ane wrang conqueist, In hope, this present lyfe suld euer lst. Bot all begylit, thay will in schort tyme d, And efer deith to lest and panis wend.
¶This Uolf, I likkin to ae Schiref sou, Quhilk byis ane forfalt at the Kingis hand. And hes with him ane cursi Assyis about, And dytis all the pure men vp on land. Fra the Crownar haif laid on him his wand, Thocht he wer trew as euer wes Sanct Iohne, Slane sal he be, or with the Iuge compone. This Rai, I likkin to ane fals Crownar, Quhilk hes ane portioun of the Inditement, And passs urth befoir the Iustice Air, All misdoaris to bring to Iugement. Bot luke gif he wes of ane trew Intent, To Scraip out Iohne, and wryte in Will, or Wat, And swa ane bud at baith the parteis tak. Of this fals Tod of quhilk I spak befoir, And of this Gled, quhat hay micht signifie. Of thair naure, as now I spik no moir. Bot o this Scheip, and o his cairfull cry, I sall rehirs, for as I passi by, Quhair tat he ay on cais I lukit doun, And hard him mak sair lamentatioun. Allace (quod he) this cursit Consistorie, In middis of the winter now is maid, Quhen Boreas with blaitis bitelie, And hard froistis, hir ouris doun can faid. On bankis bair now may I mak na baid. And with that word in to ae coif he crap, Fra sair wedder, and noistis him to hap. Quaik and for cauld, sair murnand ay amang, Ket vp his Ee vnto the einu hicht.
And said, Lord God, quhy sleipis thow sa lang: Walk, and discerne my cause groundit on richt. Se how I am be fraud, maistrie, and slicht, Peillit full bair, and so is mony one, Now in this warld, richt wonder wobegone. Se how this cursit sone of couetice, Loist hes baith lawtie, and eik Law. Now few, or nane will execute Iustice, In falt of quhome, the pure man is ouerthraw. The veritie suppois the Iuge it knaw, He is so blindit with affecioun, But dreid for micht he lettis the richt go doun. Seis thow not (Lord) this warld ouerturnit is, As quha wald change gude gold in leid or tyn? The pure is peillit, the Lord may do na mis. And Simonie is haldin for na syn. Now is he blyith with okker maist may win. Gentrice is slane, and pietie is ago. Allace (gude Lord) quhy tholis thow it so? Thow tholis this euin for our greit offence, Thow sendis vs troubill, and plaigis soir. As hunger derth, greit weir, or Pestilence. Bot few amendis now thair lyfe thairfoir.

IN middis of Iune, that sweit seasoun, Quhen that air Phebus with his bnis bricht,
Had dryit vp the dew fra daill and doun, And all the land maid with his bemis lich. In ane morning betuix mid day, and nicht, I rais, and put all sleuth, and sleip asyde. And to ane wod I went allone but gyde. ¶ Sweit wes the smel of flouris quhyte and reid. The noyes of birdis richt delitious. The bwis braid blomit abone my heid.

Ane Swannis pen stikand nder his eir. Ane Inkhorne, with ane prettie gilt Pennair, Ane bag of silk, all at his belt can beir. Thus was he gudelie graithit in his geir, Of stature large, and with ane feirfull face. Euin quhair I lay he come ane sturdie pace. And said, God speid my sone: and I wes fan Of that couth word, and of his cumpanie. With reuerence I alust him agane, Welcome Father: and he sat doun me by.

Now in this warld me think richt few or nane, To Goddis word that hes deuotioun. The eir is deif, the hart is hard as stane. Now oppin sin without correctioun. The eir Inclynand to the eirth ay doun.

Sum tirllit at the Campis of his bird, Sum spairit not to claw him on the face, Merie and glad, thus dansit thay ane space, Till at the last, the Nobill Lyoun woke, And with his pow, the maister Mous he tuke. Scho gaif ane cry, and all the laif agast, Thair dansing left, and hid thame heir ad thair. Scho that wes tane, cryit and weipit fast. And said allace oftymes that scho come thair. Now am I tane ane wofull presonair, And for my gilt traistis Incontinent, Of lyfe and deith, to thoill the Iugement. Than spak the Lyoun to that cairfull Mous.

THe hie Prudence, and wirking meruelous, The proound wit of God omnipotent, Is sa perfyte, and sa Ingenious, Excellent far all mannis Iugement. For quhy to him all thing is ay preset, Richt as it is, or ony tyme sall be, Beoir the sicht of his Diuinitie. Thairfoir our Saull with Sensualitie So fetterit is in presoun Corporall, We may not cleirlie vnderstand, nor se God, as he is, nor thingis Celestiall. Our mirk and deidlie corps Naturall, Blindis the Spirituall operatioun, Lyke as ane man wer bundin in presoun. ¶In Metaphisik Aristotell sayis, That mannis Saull is lyke ane Bakkis Ee, Quhilk lurkis still, als lang as licht of day is, And in the gloming cummis furth to fle. Hir Ene ar waik; the Sone scho may not se. Sa is our Saull with fntasie opprest, To knaw the thingis in nature manifest For God is in his power Infinite:
And mannis Saull is feill, and ouer small, Of vnderstanding waik, and vnperfite To comprehend him that contenis all. Nor suld presume be ressoun naturall To seirche the secreittis of the Trinitie, Bot trow fermelie, and lat all ressoun be. ¶ Ʒit neuertheles we may haif knawlegeing Of God almychtie, be his Creaturis.

Sum makand dyke, and sum the pleuch can wynd, Sum sawand seidis fast from place to place. The Harrowis hoppand in the saweris trace. It wes greit Ioy to him that lufit corne, To se thame laubour, baith at euin and morne. And as I baid vnder ane bank full bene, In hart greitlie reiosit of that sicht. Unto ane hedge, vnder ane Hawthorne grene Of small birdis thair come ane ferlie flicht. And doun belyif can on the leifis licht, On euerilk syde about me quhair I stude, Richt meruelous ane mekill multitude.
Amang the quhilk{is}, ane Swallow loud couth cry, On that Hawthorne hie in the croip sittand. O ʒe Birdis, on leiffis, heir me by, Ʒe sall weill knaw, and wyistie vnderstand, Quhair danger is, or perrell appeirand, It is greit wisedome to prouyde befoir, It to deuoid, for dreid it hurt ʒow moir.

Ʒone lint will grow in lytill tyme in deid, And thairof will ʒone Churll his Nettis mak, Under the quhilk he thinis vs to tak. Thairfoir I reid we pas quhen he is gone, At euin, and with our naillis scharp and small, Out of the eirth scraip we ʒone seid anone, And it it vp, for gif it growis, we all Haif cause to weip heirefter ane and all. Se we remeid thairfoir furth with Instante, Nam leuius ledit quicquid preuiūimus ante. For Clekis sayis, it is nocht sufficient, To considder that is befoir thyne Ee. Bot prudence is ane inwart Argument, That garris ane man prouyde and foirse, Quhat gude, quhat euill is liklie for to be, Of euerilk thing euin at the finall end. And swa fra perrell the better him defend. The Lark lauchand yt Swallow thus couth scorne, And said scho fischit lang befoir the Net.
The barne is eith to busk that is vnborne. All growis nocht, that in the ground is set. The nek to stoup quhen it the straik sall get, Is sone aneuch: deith on the ayest fall. Thus scornit thay the Swallow ane and all. ¶Despying thus hir helthsum document The foullis ferlie tuke thair flicht anone, Sum with ane bir thay braidit ouer the bent: And sum agane ar to the grene woid gone. Upon the land quhair I wes left allone, I tuke my club, and hamewart couth I carie Swa ferliaud, as I had sene ane farie. Thus passit furth quhill Inne that Iolie tyde, And seidis that wer sawin of beforne, Wer growin hie, that Hairis mycht thame hyde: And als the Quailʒe craikand in the corne. I mouit furth betuix midday and morne, Unto the hedge vnder the Hawthorne grene, Quhair I befoir the said birdis had sene. And as I stude be auenture and cace, The samin birdis as I haif said ʒow air, I hoip, because it wes thair hanting place, Mair of succour, or ʒit mair solitair, Thay lychtit doun: and quhen thay lychtit war The Swallow swyith put furth an pietuous pyme. Said, wo is him can not bewar in tyme. O blind birdis, and full of negligence, Unmyndfull of ʒour a win prosperitie. Lift vp ʒour sicht, and tak gude aduertence, Luke to the Lint, that growis on ʒone le.
Ʒone is the thing I bad forsuith, that we Quhill it wes seid uld rute furth of the eird. Now is it Lint: now is it hie on breird. ¶Go ʒit, quhil it is tender and small, And pull it vp, let it na mair Incres. My flsche growis, my bodie quaikis all, Thinkand on it I may not sleip in peis. Thay cryit all, and bad the Swallow ceis. And said, ʒone Lint heirefter will do gude, For linget is to lytill birdis ude. We think quen that ʒone lin bollis ar ryip, To mak vs Feist, and ill vs of the eid, Magre ʒone Churll, and on it sing and pyip. Weill (quod the Swallow) freindis hardilie bed Do as ʒe will, bot certane sai I dreid, Heirefter ʒe sall find als sour, as sweit, Qnhen ʒe ar speldi on ʒone Carlis speit. The awner of ʒone lint, ane fouler is, Richt cautelous, and full of subteltie. His pray full sendill tymis will he mis, Bot gif we irdis all the warter be. Full mony of our Kin he hes gart de And thocht it bot ane sport to spill thair blude. God keip me fra him, and the halie Rude. Thir small birdis haifand bot lytill thoch Of perrell, that micht fall be auenture, The counsell of the Swallow st at nocht, Bot uke than flicht, and furth ogidder fure. Sum to the wod, sum markit to the Mure. I tuke my stat, quhen this wes said and done,
And walkit hame, for it drew neir the none. ¶The Lint ryipit, the Carll pullit the Lyne: Rippillit the bollis, and in beitis set. It steipit in the but, and dryit syne: And with ane Betill knokkit it, and bt Syne swingillit it weill, aud hekkillit in the flet. His wye it span, and twynit it in to threid. Of quhlk the Fowlar Nettis maid in deid. The wynter come, the wickit wind can blaw: The woddis grene wer wallowit with the weit Baith firth and fell with froistis wer maid faw, Slonkis and slaik maid sidderie with the eit. The foullis fair for falt thay fell of feit. On vewis bair it wes na bute to byde, Bot hyt vnto housis thame to hyde. Sum in the barn, sum in the stak of corne, Thair lugeing tuke, and maid thair reidence. The Fowlar saw, and greit athis hes sworne Thay suld be tane trewe for thair expence. His Nettis hes he set with diligence, And in the snaw he schlt hes ane plane, And heillit it all ouer with calf agane. Thir small birdis seand the calf wes gld. Trowand it had bene orne, thay lyhit doun. Bot of the Netis na presume thay had, Nor of the Fowlaris fals Intention. To scraip, and seik thair meit thy maid thame bo. The Swallow on ane lytill branche nei by Dreidnd for yle, thus loud on thme cth .
¶In to that calf scraip quhill ʒour naillis bleid, Thair is na corne, ʒe laubour all in vane. Trow ʒe ʒone Churll for pietie will ʒow eid. Na, na, he hes it heir layit for ane trae. Remoue I reid, or ellis ʒe will be slane. His Nettis he hes set full priuely. Reddie to draw: in tyme be war for thy. Greit fule is he that puttis in dangeir His lyfe, his honour, for ane thing of nocht. Greit fule is he, that will not glaidlie heir Counsall in tyme, quhill it auaill him mocht. Greit fule is he, that hes na thing in thocht, Bot thing prsent and efter quhat may fall, Nor of the end hes na memoriall. Thir small birdis for hunger famischit neir, Full besie scraipand for to seik thair fude. The counsall of the Swallow wad not heir. Suppis thair labour did thame lytill gude. Quhen scho thair fuluche hartis vnderstude Sa Indurate, vp in ane tre scho flew. With that this Churll ouer thame his Nettis drew. Allace it wes gret hart air for to se That bludie Boucheour bet thay birdis doun. And for ill heir, qhen thay ws weill to de, Thair cairfull sang and lamentatioun Sum with ane stat he straik to eirth on swoun: Of sum the hed he straik of sum he  the crag Sum half on ye he stoppit in his ag And quhen the Sallow saw that thay wer deid. Lo (quod cho) thus it happinnis mony syis,
On thame that will not tak counsall, nor reid Of Prudent men, or Clerkis that ar wyis. This greit perrell I tald thame mair than thryis. Now ar thay deid, and wo is me thairfoir. Scho tuke hir flicht, bot I hir saw no moir. MORALITAS. LO worthie fol Esope that Nobill Clerk, Ane Poet worthie to be Lawreat.

And thus endis the preiching of the Swallow. ¶FINIS. ¶The Till of the Uolf, that gat the Nekhe∣ring, throw the wrinkis of the Foxe, that begylit the Cadgear. QUhylum thair wynnit in ane wildernes, (As myne Authour expressie can declair) Ane reuand Uolf, that leuit vpon cas On bestiall, and maid him weill to fair. Was nane sa big about him he wald spair, And he war hungrie, outher for fauour, or feid, Bot in his breith he weryit thame to deid. Swa happinnit him in watching as he went, To meit ane Foxe in middis of the way. He him foirsaw, and fenʒeit to be schent, And with ane bek, he bad the Uolf gude day. Welcum to me (quod he) thow Russell gray. Syne loutit doun, and tuke him be the hand. Ryse vp Lowrence, I leif the for to stand. Quhair hes thow bene this sesoun fra my sicht how all eir office, and my Stewart be.
For thow can knap doun Caponis on the nicht, And lourand law thow can gar hennis de. Schir (said the Foe) that ganis nocht for me. And I am raid, gif thay me se on far, That at my figure, beist and bird will sar. ¶Na (quod the Uolf) thow can in couert creip Upon thy wame, and hint thame be the heid. And mak ane suddand schow vpon ane scheip, Syne with thy wappinnis wirtie him to deid. Schir (said the Foxe) ʒe knaw my Roib is reid. And thairfoir thair will na beist abyde me, Thocht I wald be sa fals as for to hyde me. Ʒis (quod the Uolf) throw buskis & throw bary{is}, Law can thow lour, to cum to thy Intent. Schir (said the Foxe) ʒe wait weill how it gais, Ane lang space fra thame thay will feill my sent. Than will thay eschaip, suppois I suld be schent. And I am schamefull for to cum behind thame, In to the feild thocht I suld sleipand find thame. Na (quod the Uolf) thow can cum on the wind, For euerie wrin forsuith thow hes ane wyle. Schir (said the Foxe) that beist ʒe micht call blind, That micht not eschaip than fra me ane myle. How micht I ane of thame that wyis begyl? My tipit twa eiis, and my twa gray Ene Garis me be end, quhair I wes neuer sene. Than (said the Uolf) Lowrence I heir the le, And castis or petrellis thy ginnis to defend. Bot all thy sonʒeis sall not auaill the, About the bulk with wayis thocht tho wend.
Falset will failʒe ay at the latter end. To bow at bidding, and byde not quhill thow brest, Thairfoir I gif the counsall for the best. ¶Schir (said the Foxe) it is Lentring ʒe se, And I can nouther fische, with huke, nor Net, To tak ane Banestikill, thocht we baith suld de. I had ane vther craft to win my meit. Bot wer it Pasche, that men suld pultrie eit, As Kiddis, Lambis, or Caponis in to ply. To beir ʒour office than wald I not set by. Than (said the Uolf) in wraith wenis thow with wyls, And with thy mony mowis me to mat. It is ane auld Dog doutles that thow begylis: Thow wenis to draw the stra befoir the cat. Schir (said the Foxe) God wait, I mene not that, For and I did, it wer weill worth that ʒe In ane reid Raip had tyit me till ane tre. Bot now I se, he is ane fule persay, That with his maister fallis in ressoning. I did bot till assay quhat ʒe wald say, God wait my mynd wes on ane vther thing. I sall fulfill in all thing ʒour bidding, Quhat euer ʒe charge on nichtis or on dayis. Weill (quod the Uolf) I heir weill quhat thow sayis. Bot ʒit I will, thow mak to me ane aith For to be leill attour all leuand leid. Schir (said the Foxe) that ane word mak{is} me wraith For now I se, ʒe haif me at ane dreid. Ʒit sall I sweir, suppois it be not neid. Be Iuppiter, and on pane of my heid,
I sall be trew to ʒow, quhill I be deid. With that ane Cadgear with capill, & with crlis, Come capand furth: than drew this Bouche our by. The Foxe the ewer of the fresche hering feillis, And to the Uolf he roundis priuelie. Schir, ʒone ar hering the Cadgear caryis by. Thairfoir I reid, that we se for sum wayis, To get sum fische aganis thir fasting dayis. ¶Sen I am Stewart, I wald we had sum stuf, And ʒe ar siluer seik, I wait richt weill. Thocht we wald thig, ʒone verray Churlische chuf, He will not gif vs ane hering of his Creill, Befoir ʒone Churle on kneis thocht we wald kneill. Bot ʒit I trow alsone that ʒe sall se, Gif I can traist, to bleir ʒone Carllis Ee. Schir, ane thing is, and we get of ʒoe pelf, Ʒe man ak trauell, and mak vs sum supple. For he hat will not laubour, and help him self, In to thir dayis he is not worth ane ie. I think to wirk als besie as ane Be. And ʒe sall follow ane lytill eterwart, And gadder hring, for that sall be ʒour part. With that he kest ane cumpas far about, And straucht him doun in middis of the way, As he war deid, he enʒeit him but dout. And than vpon ane lang vnliklie bray, The quhyte o his Ene he urnit vp in tway. His toung out hang ane handbreid of his heid. And till he lay, als straucht as he wer deid.
¶The Cadgear fand the Foxe, and he wes sane. And till him self, thus softlie can he say. At the nixt bait in Faith ʒe sall be slane, And of ʒour skyn I sall mak mittennis twa. He lap full lichtlie abot him quhair he lay, And all the trace he trippit on his ta is, As he had hacd ane pyper play, he gais. Heir lyis the Deuill (quod e) deid in ane dyke. Sic ane selcouth saw I not this seuin ʒeir. I trow ʒe haif bene tussillit with suin tyke, That garris ʒow ly sa still withouttin steir. Schir Fxe in Faith ʒe ar deir welcum heir. I is sun wyfis malisone, I trow, For pultrie pyking that lychtit hes on ʒow. Thair sall na Pedder, for purs, nor ʒit for gluifis, Nor ʒit for poyntis pyke ʒour pllet fra me. I sall of it mak mittennis to my luifis, Till hald my handis hait quhair euer I be. Till Fanderis sall it neuer saill the se. With that in hy, he hint hn be the heillis, And wich ane swak he swang him on the creillis. Syne be the heid the hors in hy hes hint. The fraudfull Foxe thairto glde tent hes tane. And with his teith the stoppell or he stint, Pullit out, and syne the hering ane, and ane Out o the creillis he swakkit doun gude wane The Uolf wes wa and gadderit spedilie. The Cadgear sang, huntis vp, vp vpon hie. Ʒit at ane burne the Cadgear lukit about. With that the Foxe ap qyte the creillis fra.
The Cadgear wald haif raucht the Foxe ane rou. Than with ane schou, thus can the Cadgear say. Bot all for nocht, he wan his hoill that day. Abyde, and thow ane Nekhering sall haif, Is worh my Capill, Creillis, and all the laif. Now (quod the Foxe) I schrew me, and we meit. I hard quhat thow hecht to do with my skyn. Thy handis sall neuer in thay mittennis tak heit, And thow wer hangit Carll, and all thy kyn. Do furth thy mercat, at me thow sall nocht wyn, And sell thy hring thow hes thair, till hie price Ellis thow sall wyn nocht on thy merchandice. The Cadgear trmillit for teyne quhair yat he stude. I is weill worthie (quod he) I want ʒone tyke, That had nocht in my had sa mekill gude, As staf, or sting, ʒone truker for to stryke. With that lychtlie he lap outouer ane dyke. And snakkit doun ane stat, for he wes tene. That heuie wes, and of the Holyne grene. With that the Foxe vnto the Uolf couth wend. And fand him be the hering, quhair he lyis. Schir (said he than) maid I not fair defend. Ane wicht man wantit neuer, and he wer wyis. Ane hardie hart is hard for to suppryis. (Than said the Uolf) thow art ane Bere full bald. And wyse at will, in gude tyme be it tald. Bot quhat wes ʒone the Carll cryit on hie, And schuke his heid, quhen that he saw thow fell? Schir (said the Foxe) that I can tell trewlie. He said, the Nekhering wes in till the creill.
Kennis thow that hering: ʒe Schir, I ken it weill. And at the creill mouth I had it thryis but dout. The wecht of it neir tit my tuskis out. ¶Now suithlie Schir, micht we that hering fāg, It wad befische to vs thir fourtie dayis. Than (said the Uolf) now God nor that I hang, Bot to be thair, I wald gif all my clais. To se gif that my wappinnis mycht it rais. Schir (said the Foe) God wait, I wischit ʒow oft, Quhen that my pith micht not beir it on loft. It is ane syde of Salmond, as it wer, And callour, pyand lyke ane Pertrik Ee. It is worth all the hering ʒe haif thair. Ʒe and we had it swa, is it worth sic thre. Than (aid the Uolf) quhat counsell geuis thow me? Schir (said the Foxe) wirk efter my deuyis, And ʒe sall haif it, and tak ʒow na suppryis. First, ʒe man cast ane cumpas far about. Syne straucht ʒow doun in middis of the way. Baith heid, and fei, and taill ʒe man streik out. Hing furth ʒour toung, & clois weill ʒour Ene tway. Syne se ʒour heid on ane hard place ʒe lay. And dou not for na perrell may appeir, Bot hald ʒow clois, quhē yat the Carll cummîs neir. And thocht ʒe se ane staf, haif ʒe na dout. Bot hald ʒow wonder still in to that steid. And luke ʒour Ene be clois, as thay wer out. And se that ʒe schrink nouther fute, nor heid Than will the Cadgear Carll trow ʒe be deid, And in till haist will hint ʒow be the heillis,
As he did mē, and swak ʒow on his creillis. ¶Now (quod the Uolf) I sweir the be my thrift, I trow, ʒone Cadgear Carll dow not me beir. Schir (said the Foxe) on loft he will ʒow lift, Upon his creillis, and do him lytill deir. Bot ane thing dar I suithlie to ʒow sweir, Get ʒe that hering sicker in sum place, Ʒe sall not fair in fsching mair quhill Pasche. I sall say In principio vpon ʒow, And croce ʒour corps, from the top, to ta. Wend quhen ʒe will, I dar be warrand now, That ʒe sall de na suddand deith this day. With that the Uolf gird vp sone, and to ga, And caist ane cumpas about the Cadgear ar. Syne straucht him in the gait, or he come nair. He laid his halfheid sicker, hard, and sad. Syne straucht his four feit fra him, and his heid. And hang his toung furth as the Foxe him bad. Als still he lay, as he wer erray deid. Rakkand na thing of the Caris auour nor feid. Bot euer vpon the Nekhering he thinki, An quyte forʒettis the Foxe, and all his wrinkis. With that the Cadgear als wraith as ony wind, Come tyand on the aid, for it wes lict. Thinkand ay on the Foxe that wes beind, Upon quhat wye, reuenge him best he micht. And at the last, of the Uolf gat ane sicht, Quhai he in lenth lay streiki in the gai. Bot gif he icht doun, or nocht, God wai.
¶Softlie he said. I wes begylit anis, Be I begylit twyis, I schrew vs baith. That euill bot it sall licht vpon thy banis, He suld haif had, that hes done me the saith. On hicht he hoit the staf for he wes wraich, And hit him with sic will vpon the heid, Quhill neir he swonit, and swelt in to that steid. Thre battis he bure, or he his feit mycht find. Bot ʒit the Uolf wes wicht, and wan away. He micht not se, he wes sa verray blind. Nor wit reddilie quhether it wes nicht or day. The Foxe beheld that seruice quhair he lay, And leuch on loft, quhen he the Uolf sa seis, Baith deif, and dosinnit, fall swonand on his knei. He that of ressoun can not be content, Bot couetis all, is abill all to tyne. The Foxe, quhen that he saw the Uolf wes schent, Said to him seif, thir hering sall be myne. I le, or ellis he wes efterwart syne, That and sic wayis his Maister for to greif, With all the fische thus Lowrence tuke his leif. ¶The Uolf wes neir weill dungin to the deid, That vneis with his lyfe away he wan. For with the Bastoun weill brokin wes his heid. The Foxe in to his den sone drew him than, That had betrai it hi Maister, and the man. The ane, wantit the hering of his creillis. The vtheris blude wes rynnand ouer is heillis MORALITAS. THis Taill is myngit with Moralitie. As I sall schaw sumuhat, or that I ceis.
The Foxe, vnto the warld may likkinnit be. The reuand Uolf, vnto ane man but leis. The Cadgear Deith, quhome vnder all man preis, That euer tuke lyfe, throw cours of kynd man dee. As man, and beist, and fische in to the see. ¶The warld ʒe wait, is Stewart to the man. Quhilk may mak man to haif na mynd of Deid. Bot settis for winning all the craftis thay can. The Hering, I likkin vnto the gold sa reid, Quhilk gart the Uolf in perrell put his heid. Richt swa the gold garris Land crteis, With weir, be waisti daylie as men seis. And as the Foxe with dissimulance and gyle, Gart the Uolf wene to haif worschip for euer. Richt swa, this warld with vane glore for ane quhyle Flatteris with folk, as thay suld failʒe neuer. Ʒit suddandlie men seis it oft disseuer With thame, that trowis oft to fill the sek. Deith cummis behind, and nippis thame be the nek The mickt of gold makis mony men sa blind, That settis on Auarice thair felicitie. That thay forʒet the Cadgear cummis behind, To strike thame, of quhat stait sa euer thay be. Quhat is mair dirk, than blind prosperitie? Quhairfoir, I counsell mychtie men to hai mynd, Of the Nekhering Interpreit in this kynd. ¶FINIS. ¶The Taill of the Foxe, that begylit the Uolf, in the schadow of the Mone.
IN Elderis dayis, as Esope can declair, Thair wes ane Husband, qubilk had ane pleuch to steir. His vse wes ay, in morning to ryse air. Sa happinnit him in streiking tyme of ʒeir, Airlie in the morning to follow furth his feir, Unto the pleuch, bot his gadman and he. His flottis he straucht with Benedicite. The Caller cryit, how, haik, vpon hicht, Hald draucht my dowis, syne broddit thame full sair. The Oxin wes vnwsit ʒoung and licht, And for fersnes thay couth the fur forfair. The Husband than woxe angrie as ane hair. Syne cryit, and caist his Patill, and greit sanis. The Uolf (quod he) mot haif ʒow all at atanis. Bot ʒit the Uolf wes neirar nor he wend, For in ane busk he lay, and Lowrence baith, In ane Rouch Rone wes at the furris end. And hard the hecht: than Lowrence lech full raith. To tak ʒone bud (quod he) it wer na skaith. Weill (quod the Uolf) I hecht the be my had, Ʒone Carllis word as he wer King all stand. The Oxin eirit mair reullie at the last. Syne efter thay lousit, ra that it worthit weill lait. The Husband hamewart with his cattell past. Than sone the Uolf come hirpilland in his gait, Befoir the Oxin, and schupe to mak deair. The Husband saw him, and worthit sumdeill agast. And bakwart with his beistis wald haif past. The Uolf said, quhether dryuis thow this Pray? I challenge it, for nane of thame ar thyne.
The man thairof wes in ane felloun fray. And soberlie to the olf answerit syne. Schir, be my Saull, thir oxin ar all myne. Thairfoir I studie, quhy ʒe suld stop me. Sen that I faltit neuer to ʒow trewlie. The Uolf said, Carll, gaif thow not me this drift Airlie, quhen thow wes eirand on ʒone bank? And is thair oucht (sayis thow) frear than gift? This tarying will tyne the all thy thank. Far better is frelie for to gif ane plank, Nor be compellit on force, to gif ane mark. Fy on the fredome, that cummis not with hart. Schir (quod the husband) ane mā may say in greif, And syne ganesay fra he auise and se. I hecht to stel, am I thairfoir ane theif? God fobid, Schir, all hechtis suld haldin ve. Gaif I my hand or oblissing (quod he) Or haif ʒe witnes, or writ for to schaw. Schir reif me not, bot go and seik the Law. Carll (quod the Uolf) ane Lord and he be leill, That schrinkis for schame, or doutis to be reprufit, His saw is ay als sickker as his Seill. Fy on the Leid, that is not leill and lufit. Thy argument is fals, and eik contrusit. For it is said in Prouerb: But lawte All vther vertew is ar nocht worth ane fle. Schir, said the husband, remember of this thing. Ane eill man is not tan at half ane taill. I may say, and ganesay, I am na King. Quha is ʒour witnes, yat hard I hecht thame haill
Than said the Uolf, thairfoir it sall nocht faill. Lowrence (quod he) cum hidder of that Schaw, And say na thing, bot as thow hard and saw. ¶Lowrence come lourand, for he lufit neuer licht, And sone apperit beoir thame in that place. The man lech na thing, quhen he saw that sicht. Lowrēce (quod the Uolf) thow man declair yis cace, Quhairof we sall schaw the suith in schort space. I callit on the leill witnes for to beir. Quhat hard thow that this man hecht me lang eir? Schir (said the Tod) I can not hastelie Swa sone as now gif sentence finall. Bot wald ʒe baith submit ʒow heir to me, To stand at my decreit perpetuall. To pleis baith I suld preif, gif it may fall. Weill (quod the Uolf) I am content for me. The man said, swa am I, how euer it be. Than schw thay urth thair allegeance but fabill, And baith propit thair pley to him compleit. (Quod Lowrence) now I am ane Iuge amycabill. Ʒe sall be sworne to stand at my decreit. Quhher beit efter ʒe think it soure or sweit. The Uolf braid furth his fute, the man his hand: And on the Toddis Taill sworne thay ar to stand. Thair tke the Tod the man furth till ane syde. And said him, rein thow art in blunder brocht. The  will not forg the ane Oe hyde. Ʒit wald my selne hel the, and I mocht. Bot I am lath to hur my conscience oth. not thy querrell in thy awin defence,
This will not throw but greit coist and xpenc. ¶Seis thow not Buddis beiris Bernis throw: And giftis garis crukit maeris hald full euin? Sumtymis ane nedill haldis ane man in ane Kow. ll ar not halie, that heifis thair handis to heui. Schir (said the man) ʒe sall haif sex, or seuin Richt of the fttest hennis of all the oik.

Syne priulie, he plukkit him be the sei, Is this in ernist (quod he) ʒe ask sic thing? b my Saull, I trow it be in hehing. Than said the Uolf, Lowrence, quhy sayis thow s?

THis Uolf, I likkin to ane wickit man, Quhilk dos the pure oppres in euerie place: And pykis at thame all querrellis that he can, Be Rigour, reif, and vther wickitnes. The Foxe, the Feynd I call in to this ca, Arctand ilk man to ryn vnrychteous rinkis, Thinkand thairthrow to lok him in his linkis. The Husband may be callit ane godlie man, With quhome the Feynd salt findis (as Clerkis reid{is}) Besie to tempt him, with all wayis that he can. The hennis, ar warkis, yat fra serme faith proceidis.

QUhylum thair wes (as Esope can Report) Ane schiphird dwelland be ane Forrest neir. Quhilk had ane Hoūd, yat did him greit cōor Full war he ws to wak his Fauld but weir, That nouther.

Bot tha (God wait) the keipar of the fe, For vray wo woxe  nor the we.
Allace (quod he) now se I na remed, To saif the selie beistis that I keip, For wit the Uolf, werryit beis all my scheip. ¶It wald haif maid ane mannis hart fair to s The selie cheiphirdis lamentatioun. Now is my Darling deid, allace (quod he) For now to beg my breid I may be boun, With pyikstaf, and with scrip to fair of toun. For all the beistis befoir andonit bene, Will schte vpon my beistis with Ire and tene. With that ane Uedder wrerhitlie wan on ute: Maister (quod he) mak merie, and be blyith. To brek ʒour hart for baill, it is na bute. For ane deid Doig ʒe na ait on ʒow kyith. Ga ethe him hithor, and fla his skyn of swyith. Syne sew it on me: and luke that it be meit, Baith heid, and cag, bodie, taill, and feit. Than will the Uol trow, that I am he. For I sall follow him fat quar uer he fair. All haill the cure I tak it vpon me. Ʒour scheip to keip at midday, lait, and air. And he persew, he God, I sall not spair To follow him als fast as did ʒour Doig. Swa that I warrand, ʒe fall not want ane hoig. Thā said the scheiphird, this come of ane gude wit. Thy counsall is baith skkr leill, and trew. Quha sayis ane scheipis dair, thay heir of it. With that in hy the Doggis skyn o he flew, And on the scheip rycht sotlie couh it sew. Thn worth the Uedder wantoun of his weid.
Now of the Uolf (quod he) I haif na dreid. ¶In all thingis he counterfait the Dog, For all the nicht he stude, and tuk na sleip. Swa that weill lang thair wantit not ane Hog, Swa war he wes, and walkryfe thame to keip, That Lowrence durst not luke vpon ane scheip. For and he did, he followit him sa fast, That of his lyfe he maid him all agast. Was nouther Uolf, Uildcat, nor ʒit Tod, Durst cum within thay boundis all about: Bot he wald chace thame baith throw ouch & snod. Thay hifull beistis had of thair lyuis si dout. For he wes mekill, and semit to be stou. That euerilk beist thay dred him as the deid, Within that woid that nan durst hald thair hed. Ʒit happinnit thair ane hungrie Uolf to slyde Out throw his scheip, quhair thay lay on ane le I sall haife (quod he) quhat euer betyde, Thocht I he werryit, o hunger or I de. With that ane Lamb in till his cluke hint he. The laif start vp, for thay wer all agast. Bot (God wait) gi the Uedder followit ast. Went neuer Hound mair haistelie fra the hand, Quhen he wes rynnand maist raklie at the Ra, Nor went this Uedder baith ouer Mois and strand, And stoppit noher at bank, bu. Bot followit ay sa elie on his , With sic ane drift, nhill dust and dirt ouerdra him. And maid ane wow to God, that he suld haif him.
¶With that the Uol let out his Taill on lenth, For he wes hungrie, and it drew neir the euin. And schupe him for to ryn with all his strenth, Fra he the Uedder sa neir cummand had sene, He dred his lyfe, and he ouertane had bene. Thairfoir he spairit nouther busk, nor boig. For weill he kennit the cumming of the Doig. To mak him lycht, he kest the Lamb him fra. Syne lap ouer leis, and draif throw dub and myr. Na (quod the wedder) in Faith we part not swa. It is not the Lamb, bot the, that I desyre. I sall cum neir, for now I se the tyre. The Uolf ran till ane rekill stude behind him, Bot ay th neirar the Uedder to couth wyn him. Sone efter that, he followit him sa neir, Quhill that the Uolf for leidnes fylit the feild. Syne left the gait, and ran throw busk, and breir, And schupe him fra the schawis for to scheild. He ran restles, for he wist of na weild. The wedder follot him, baith out, and in, Quhill that ane breir busk raif rudelie of the skyn. The Uolf wes wer, and blenkit him behind, And saw the Uedder come thra wād throw the breir. Syne saw the Doggis skyn hingad on his lind. Na (quod he) is this ʒe, that is sa neir? Richt now ane Hoūd, and now quhyte as ane Freir. I fled ouer fer, and I had kennit the cais. To God I wow, that ʒe sall ew this rais. Quhat wes the cause ʒe gaif me sic ane chace? With that in hy he hint him be the horne.
For all ʒour mowis, ʒe met anis with ʒour mache, Suppois ʒe leuch me all this ʒeir to scorne. For quhat enchessoun this Doggis skyn haif ʒe borne? Maister (quod he) bot to haif playit with ʒow, I ʒow requyre, that ʒe nane vther trow. ¶Is this ʒour bourding in ernist than (quod he) For I am verray effeirit, and on flocht. Cum bak agane, and I sall let ʒow se. Than quhar the gait wes grimmit he him brocht. Quhether call ʒe this fair play, or nocht? To set ʒour Maister in sa fell effray, Quhill he for feiritnes hes fylit vp the way. Thryis (be my Saull) ʒe gart me schute behind, Upon my hoichis the senʒeis may be sene. For feiritnes full oft I fylit the wind. Now is this ʒe: na bot ane Hound, I wene. Me think ʒour teith ouer schort to be sa kene. Blissit be the bu, that rest ʒow ʒour array. Ellis fleand, bursin had I bene this day. Schir (quod the Uedder) uppois I ran in hy, My mynd wes neuer to do ʒour persoun euill. Ane flear gettis ane follower commounlie, In play or ernist, preif quha sa euer will. Sen I bot playit, be gracious me till. And I sall gar my reindis blis ʒour banis. Ane full gude seruand will crab his Maister anis. I haif bene oftymis set in greit effray, Bot (be the Rude) sa rad ʒit wes I neuer. As thow hes maid me with thy prettie play.

Bot sickkerlie now sall we not disseuer. Than be the crag bane smertlie he him tuke, Or euer he ceissit, and it in schunder schuke. MORALITAS. ESope that Poet first Father of this Fabill, Wrait this Parabole quhilk is conuenient. Because the sentence wes fructuous & agreabill, In Moralitie exemplatiue prudent. Quhais problemes bene verray excellent, Throw similitude of figuris to this day, Geuis doctrine to the Redaris of it ay. Heir may thow se, that riches of array, Will cause pure men presumpteous for to be. Thay think thay hald of nane be thay als gay, Bot counterfute ane Lord in all degre. Out of thair cais in pryde thy clym sa hie, That thay forbeir thair better in na stid, Quhill sum man tit thair heillis ouer thair heid. Richt swa in seruice vther sum exceidis, And thay haif withgang, welth, and cherissing, That thay will lychtlie Lordis in thair deidis, And lukis not to thair blude, nor thair ofspring. Bot ʒit, na wait, how lang that rell will ring. Bot he was wyse, that bad his Sone considder. Bewar in welth, for Hall benkis ar rycht flidder. Thairfoir I counsell men of euerilk stait, To uam thae self, and quhome thay uld forbei. And fall nor with thair better in debai, Suppois thay be al galland in thair geir. It setti na seruand for to vphald weir,
Nor clym sa hie, quhill he fall of the ledder. Bot think vpon the Uolf, and on the wedder. ¶FINIS. ¶The Taill of the Uolf, and the Lamb. ANe cruell Uolf, richt rauenous, and fell, Upon ane tyme past to ane Reuer. Descending from ane Roche, vnto ane well. To slaik his thrist, drank of the watter cleir. Swa vpon cace, ane selie Lamb come neir. Bot of his fa, the Uolf, na thing he wist. And in the streme laipit, to rule his thrist. Thus drank thay baith, bot not of ane Intent. The Uolfis thocht wes all of wickitnes. The selie Lamb, wes meik, and Innocent, Upon the Reuer, in ane vther place, Beneth the Uolf, he drank ane lytill space, Quhill he thocht gude, beleuand thair nane euill. The Uolf him saw, and Rampand come him till. With girnand teith, and awfull angrie luk, Said to the Lamb, thow Caue wretchir thing. How durst thow be sa bald, to fyle this Bruk, Quhar I suld drink, with thy foull flauering? It wer Almous the for to draw and hing, That suld presume, with thy foull lippis wyle, To glar my drink, and this fair water fyle. The selie Lamb quaikand for verray dreid, On kneis fell, and said, Schir, with ʒour leif. Suppois I ar not say, thair of ʒe lid: Bot e my Sauil, I war ʒe a noche preif,
That I did ny thing, that suld ʒow greif. Ʒe wait alswa that ʒour accusatioun, Failʒeis fra treuth, and contrair is to ressoun. ¶Thocht I can nocht, Nature will e defend, And of the deid perfyte experience. All heuie thing, man of the self discend. Bot gif sum thing on force mak resistence. Than may the streme on na way mak ascence, Nor ryn bakwart: I drank beneth ʒow far. Ergo, for me, ʒour Bruke wes neuer the war. Alswa, my lippis sen that I wes ane Lamb, Tuichit na thing that wes contagious. Bot soukkit milk, from Pappis of my dame, Richt Naturall, sweit, and als delitious. Weill (quod the Uolf) thy language Rigorous Cummis the of kynd: swa thy Father before Held me at bait, baith with boist, and schore. He wraithit me, and than I culd him warne, Within ane ʒeir, and I brukit my heid, I suld be wrokkin on him, or on his barne, For his exhorbitant and frawart pleid. Thow all doutles for his deidis be deid. Schir, it is wrang, that for the Father is gilt, The sikles sone suld punist be, or spilt. Haif ʒe not hard, quhat halie Scripture sayis, Endytit with the mouth of God Almycht? Of his awin didis lk man sall beir the prais, As pane for sin, reuard for werkis rycht. For my trespas, quhy suld my sone haif plycht? Quha did the mis, let him sustne the pane.
Ʒaa (quod the Uolf) ʒit pleyis thow agane. ¶I let the wit, quhen that the Father oendi, I will chereis nane of his Successioun. And of his barnis, I may weill tak amendis, Unto the twentie degre descending doun. Thy Father thocht to mak ane strang presoa, And with his mouth in to my watter spew. Schir (quod the Lamb) thay twa ar nouther trew. The Law sayis, and ʒe will vnderstand: Thair suld na man for wrang nor violence, His awin sair punis at his awin hand, Without proces of Law, and euidence. Quhilk suld haif leif to mak lawfull defence, And thairupon Summondis Peremptourlie, For to propoe, contrairie, or reply. Set me ane lauchfull Court, I sall compeir, Befoir the Lyoun, Lord, and leill Iustice. And be my hand I oblis me rycht heir, That I sall byde ne vnsuspect Assyis. This is the Law: this is the Instant vse: Ʒe suld pretend thairfoir ane Summondis mak, Aganis that day, to gif ressoun, and tak. Na (quod the Uol) thow wald Intruse ressoun, Quhar wrang, and reif suld dwell in propertie. That is ane poynt, and part of fals tressoun, For to gar reuth reme with crueltie Be his woundis, fals tratour, thow sall de, For thy trespas, and for thy Fatheris als. With that anone he hint him be the hals.
¶The selie Lamb culd do na thing bot blai. Sone wes he deid: the Uolf wald do na grace. Syne drank his blude, and of his lesche can eit, Quhill he wes full, and went his way on pace. Of his murther quhat sall we say, allace? Wes not this reuth, wes not this greit pietie? To gar this selie Lamb but gilt thus de. MORALITAS. THe pure pepill, this Lamb may signifie, As Maill men, Merchandis, & all lauboureris. Of quhome the lyfe, is half ane Purgatorie, To wyn with lautie leuing as efferis. The Uolf betkinnis fals extortioneris, And oppressouris of pure men, as we se, Be violence, or craft in facultie. ¶Thre kynd of Uolfis, in this warld now Ring{is}. The first, ar fals peruerteris of the Lawis. Quhilk vnder Poet termis, falset mingis, Lettand that allwer Gospell, that he schawis. Bot for ane bud the pure man he ouerthrawis, Smoirand the richt, garrand the wrang proceid. Of sic Uolfis hellis fyre sall be thair meid. O man of Law, let be that subteltie, W nyce gimpis, and fraudis Intricate: And think tha God in his Diuinitie, The wrang, the rycht, of all thy werkis wait. For prayer, price, for hie, nor law estait, Of fals querrellis se thow mak na defence. Hald with the tycht, hurt not thy conscience. Ane vther kynd of Uolfis Rauenous,

With his mnʒe, at euin quhen he cummis hame. Thow suld dreid, for rychteous Goddis blame. For it cryis ane vengeance vnto the heuinnis hie, To gar ane pue man wirk, but Meit, or fe ¶O thow greit Lord, that riches hes and rent: Thow art ane Uolf, thus to deuoir the pure. Think that na thing cruell, nor violent, May in this warld perpetuallie Indure. This sall thow trow, and sikkerlie assure, For till oppres, thow sall haif als greit pane, As thow the pure had with thy awin hand lane. God keip the Lamb, quhilk is the Innocent, From Uolfis byit, and men exortioneris. God grant, that wrangous men of fals Intent, Be manifestit, and punischit as effeiris. And God, as thow all rychteous prayer heiris, Mot saif our King, and gif him hart and hand, All sic Uolfis to banis out of the land. ¶FINIS. ¶The Taill of the Paddok, and the Mous.
