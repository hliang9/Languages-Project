The Psal∣ter of Da∣uid in Englyshe / purely and faythfully trāslated after the texte of Felyne: euery Psalme hauynge his argument before / declarynge brefely thentente & sub∣stance of the hole Psal∣me.
To the reder. BE glad in the lorde (dere bre∣thern) & gyue hī thākes / whi∣che nowe at the last / of his mercia∣ble goodnes hath sent you his Psal∣ter in Englysshe / faithfully & pure∣ly translated: which ye may nat me∣sure & iuge after the comē texte. Fo the trouth of the Psalmes muste b fetched more nygh the Hebrue verite / in the which tonge Dauid with the other sīgers of ye Psalmes firs songe them. Let the gostly lerned i the holy tonge be iuges. It is the spirituall man (saith Paule) which hath the spirite of god that must de∣cerne and iuge all thynges. And the men quietly syttyng (if the truth be shewed them) must iuge and stande vp & speke (the first īterpretour hol∣dynge his peace) god giue you true spirituall and quiete syttynge iu∣ges. Amen.
Beatus vir. Psal. .i. ¶The argument of the first psalme. ¶ They that forsake theyr coūseyls / the waies / the lernyng / and conuersatyon of the vngodly: geuynge thēself holie to the knowlege of goddes awe / & to lyue therafter / ar blessed: the other ar wycked & vngodly. The blessed ar lykened to a moist frutful tre fast plāted by the wa side: the vngodly / to dri baren dust scatred with the wīde BEatus vir. Blessed is that man / whiche walketh nat in the coūsaile of the vngodly / & stādeth nat in the waye of sīners / & sytteth nat in the seat of the pestelēt scorners. But hath all his plea¦sure ī ye lawe of ye lord / & vpō it his mīde is ocupied both day & night Sith a man shall be lyke a tree planted by the ryuer yde: which wyl gyue forth her frutes in due tyme / and her leues shall nat wither / for what so euer he shall do / shal {pro}spere. But so shal nat ye vngodly: for they shal be lyke dust which is dyspersed with the wynde. Wherfore these vngodly shal nat stande in the iugemēt / neither these syn∣ners maye abyde in the companye of the rightwyse. For the lorde aproueth the waye of the ryghtwyse: but the waye of synners shall perisshe. The argument into the .ii. psal. ¶ This psal. sheweth who were againste god & his sonne Christ / their vayne study / howe god aboue scorneth their enforcementes / howe that Christes kyngdome standeth & encreseth whiles they
perisshe / and that the waye of helth is to truste and to cleue to Christe our kynge. QUare fremuerūt gentes. Wherfore do the gentyls thus swell & clustre togyther? Wherfore do ye people of the iewes thus gnaste in vayne? Wherfore conspire ye king{is} of therth / & ye chefe pre∣st{is} thus cast theyr hedes togyder against the lorde & his anointed. Sayeng / lette vs breke their bondes / & lette vs caste of their yokes. But he yt hath his residēs ī heuē derideth thē / ye lorde scorneth thē▪ Than shall he thrust them downe in his wrath / & in his indignation shal he all to trouble thē. I haue constitute & ordened my kynge / to be ouer Sion my holy hyl. I shall shewe forth ye lordes cōmaunde∣mēt / for he said vnto me / yu arte my sonne whō I haue now openly declared. Aske of me / & I shall gyue the yt nations into thy heritage / to be thyn owne possession thorow out all the worlde. Thou shalte smyte thē togyther wt an yerne sceptre / & shalt brke thē lyke erthē vessels. Nowe therfore ye kynges be wise & vnderstand / ye rulers of the erth be content to be mo∣nished & lerned. Serue ye ye lorde besely / study to gyue him his honour ioyfully wt reuerēce. Kysse ye the sonne / lest (he beīg wrath) your lyfe perishe / for hys angre
shall be shortly kyndled. And thā bles∣sed ar all men that truste in him. The argument in to the .iii. Psalme. ¶ Dauid merueleth & complaineth to the lorde of the multitude & boldnes of his enemies & cō∣mitteth hī selfe with gret trust to the lorde whi¦che wyl shortly smyte thē downe / for no mā els may saue / & no mā is {per}taker of helth but he trust in hī. The title of the ps. The songe or ditie of Dauid fleīg frō his sōne Absalō. Thistori is wri¦tē ī the .ii. boke of kīges frō the xv. cha. to the xx. DOmine quid. Lorde / see what a sorte there are that trouble me: full many there are yt ryse agaīst me. Many ther are that thīke thus vpō my soule / su¦rely ther is no helth to be loked for from god / vnto this man. Selah. But thou lorde / yu art my helpe & my glory / thou lif¦test vp my heed. The lorde I called vpō with my prayer / & he answered me euen from his holy hyll. Selah. I shall lye down & slepe / I my self shall vpwake me for the lorde sustayneth me. I shall fere / ye thousand{is} folke / althogh they besige me roūde aboute. A rise lorde / saue me any god / yu shalt gyue all my enemys such a clap on their chek{is} / yt anone the tethes of these vngodly shal be broken. It is ye lordes properte to saue / and thy people it be houeth to be holpē and endued wt thy enefytes. Selah.
¶ This worde Selah / sygnifyeth the sentence before to be pondred with a depe effecte / longe to be rested vpon / & the voyce there to be exalted. The argument into the .iiii. psalme. ¶ Dauid sheweth the goodnesse of god and his helpe brought to hī / whyles his sonne Absalon coniured against him / he reproueth the madnesse of the nobles of Israhell cōspirynge agaynst hī: & calleth thē to repentāce / after this he reioyseth of the great plētuousnesse / pease / & surenes / resto¦red thorow the goodnes of god vnto him. The title of the psalme. Dauides song vpon an in∣strumēt played for his victorie. CUm inuocarem. Whan I called vpō the / thou answeredest me / whi∣che art ye god of my rightwysnes. Whan I was in astrayte / thou dyddest set me at large / haue mercy vpon me / and heare my depe desyre. O mē / howe long entende ye to turne my glory into shame / howe lōge wyll ye loue vayne thinges & seke lyes? Selah I wold ye knewe it / yt the lorde hath set aparte & chosē vnto hī his saint / the lorde shall here whan I call vpon hī. All though ye be moued / yet se ye synne nat / pondre all thinges in your mynde as ye lye in bedde / that ye myght so set your hertes at rest. Selah. Make your sacrifice with rightwysnes / & put your trust  the lorde. Many thinke sayeng / se who shal shewe vs our desyre / lorde let thy shynyng face illumine vs. Thou hast pou∣red
my hert full of gladnes / whete & wy∣e haue ben encresed vnto them in tyme. Now therfore (thei restored to peace I shal lye downe & slepe / for yu (lord) hast so ordred me that I may lyue fre & safe ¶ The argument into the .v. psal. ¶This psalme. is a prayer of a man oppressed of wicked enemyes / whome whan he knoweth to be hated of god / he taketh herte vnto him a∣gayn trustyng that al peryl passed he shal thāke god his sauiour in the cōgregation of his saītes / wherfore he prayeth god so to lede hī / that he be nat trapped with their snares / & also to cast thē downe & to make glad the faithful. The tytle of the psal. Dauides song plaied vpō an instrumēt for his victory into the counfort of his people. UErba mea auribus. Lysten vnto my word{is} (lord) & cōsyder my loude cōplaint. Gyue eare vnto my crieng / my gouerner / & my god / for before the / do I poure forth my prayer. Lorde / yu shalt here me ī the mornīg / ī the mornyng shal I make my prayer & loke vp vnto the. For thou art nat the god which may de¦lyte in ye vngodly / the wycked men shalt haue no place with the. Synners shall nat abyde in thy presence / yu hatest who so euer are gyuen to wickednes. Thou shalt destroy these troublers wt their lyes bloudsheders / and men gyuen to deceyte (lord) yu shalt abhorre. But I vnder thy plētuouse fauour / shal go to thy house / &
shal worship the wt reuerente feare in thy holi tēple. Lede me forth of daunger for thy rightwisnes sake / & from the daūger of my aduersaries / & let thy way be defē∣sed for me. For the truth is nat in their mouthes / in their hertes they norishe de∣ceyte / their throte is an opē graue / and wt their tōge they flater. Gyue them into their synne / o god / let thē fall ī their own coūsels / caste thē downe hedlynge for the multitude of their sīnes / for agaynst the thei ar rebell. But thei mought reioyse who so euer trust in ye / they mought pray {per}petually also / & thou defēde thē yt they which seke ye glory of thy name / mought be glad of the. For thou lorde shalt be fauorable & gratio{us} to ye rightwise / thou shalte compase him rounde aboute with thy goodnes / lyke as with a shylde. The argument into the .vi. Psal. ¶ This Psal. cōteyneth a feruent desyre / and prayer of a man greuously deecte & wounded in his herte / & sore fearynge deth / but afterward reioysing of helth restored him. The tytle of the Psalme. The songe of Dauid for his victory plaied of the .x. strynged instrument. DOmine ne. Ah lorde / rebuke me nat in thy wrath / neyther chasten me in thine angre. But deale fauorably wt me (oh lorde) for full sore brokē am I / heale me lord for my bones ar al to shakē
My soule trēbleth sore / but lord how lō∣ge. Turne ye (lorde) & deliuer my soule / saue me for thy mercyes sake. For they veryly that ar in this dedly anguishe can nat thīke vpon ye / in this helly paynes / who may prayse the. I am wery wt sygh¦yng / I shal water my bedde euery nyght with my teares / so that it shal swīme in them. My face is wrincled & dried vp wt care & angre / my enemyes haue made it full thynne wt trouble. Auoyde frō me ye workers of wikednes / for ye lorde hath hard my cōplaītes poured out wt wepīg. The lord hath harde my depe desyre / the lorde hath receiued my peticiō. Al myn enemyes shall be shamed & astonned / they shalbe put to flight & confounded sodēly. The argument into the vii. Psal. ¶ In this psal. Dauid desyreth to be delyue¦red frō the troublous & perelous persecution of Saule: he remēbreth his innocency / he prayeth for the possessyon of his kyngdome that the peo¦ple myght be gathered to god / all cursed mēnes hastynes put away / after this he declareth that this vngodly shall perysshe with their owne swrde / and so at last he concludeth in the prayse of god. The tytle of the ps. The songe of Da∣uid played vpon a certayn musycall instrument which he songe to the lorde as cōcernyng the be∣synes to the which Cush the sōne of Iemi put hī. Rede thistory ī the ii of the kīges. the .xvi. cha This Ps. serueth to be sayd of a mā falsely ve¦xed & troubled.

Let my enemye {per}secute my soule & take it / let him cast down my lyfe & bury my glory. Selah. Arise lorde & shewe thy self / re∣pressyng the wrath of my troublo{us} aduer¦saries wt worthy vengeance / make me at the last to enioye the authorite which y• hast giuen me. For so shal the congre∣gatiō of thy people be gathered togither before the / ye / if there were none other cause / yet at the lest for delyuerāce of thy pore congregation set forth thy power. Lorde which art the iuge of the people iuge me after my ryghtwisnes & innocen¦cy which yu espied in me. Let the wicked¦nes of the vngodly (I pray the) be made ones an ende of / & thou (o rightwise god) sercher of hert & reynes / gyue prosperous good lucke to the rightwyse. My defēce is ī god the sauiour of thē whiche are of pure & {per}fet herte. God is a rightwyse iu¦ge
/ & he is ye god whose vēgeaūce is redy at all tymes. Yf this mā wyl nat turne him frō his euyl / but wyl whet his swerd cōtynually / bēde his bowe & prepare it to shote. He shall p̄pare dedly arowes for his owne self / & smyte his owne cōpany. Lo / he traueleth and groueth forth wic∣kednes / he hath cōceyued laborous afflic¦tion / & at laste bringeth forth lyes. He digged a pyt & hath made it holowe / & he is fallen into the dyke whiche he made. The mischefe which he entēded me shall fall vpō his own hed / & his violēs which he ordeined for me / he shal bring vpō his owne crowne. I shall magnifye the lor∣de after his owne rightwisnes / & I shall sprede the name of the lorde which is the most hyghest. The argument into the .viii. psal. ¶ This psal. is an hyghe prayse of god / in the whiche Dauid with great admiration magnifi∣ed thīestimable euerlastīg vertu & power of god / maker of all thīges / declaryng hī self euerywher gloriously: but especially shewinge vnto mā his fauour / his beneficēs: & lyberall goodnes. The tytle of the Psal. The songe of Dauid cōmit∣ted to the chaūter / to be played vpon the harpe. DOmine dn̄s nt. Lorde / ye / our lord howe wonderfull reuerēt is thy na¦me in euery lande / which hast lyft vp thy high magnificēce aboue ye heuēs. Ye / &

Thou hast made hī nat moch lesse & inferior thā Angels / wt so great di∣gnite & glory hast thou ēdued hī. Thou hast made hī lorde of thy handy workes / thou hast cast all thinges vnder his fete. As flockes of shepe all herdes of nete / & also the wilde best{is}. Foules of the aire & fissh{is} of the see / & what soeuer swīmeth in the water. Lorde / ye our lorde / howe wōdreful reuerēt is thi nam ī all therth. The argument into the .ix. Ps. ¶ Dauid in this psalme / singeth his songe of victorie / in the which he gyueth thankes for his noble victory vpon Goliath / afterwarde he ex∣tolleth the ryghtwysnes of god whiche delyue∣reth his children in tyme: at the last he cōcludeth with prayer desyrynge god to represse & to quēch the vngodly. The tytle of the psalme. The songe of Dauid cōmitted to the chaūter of the qure to be sōge vpō their musycall īstrumētes.
COnfitebor tibi do. I shal magnify the lord with my hert / I shal shewe forth all thy miracles. I shall reioyse & glory in the / I shal sprede thy name / oh most hyghest. For thou hast brought it so to passe / that al my enemyes are fled / they ar ded / one fallyng vpon another in their flyghte. For thou hast gyuen sen∣tence with me / thou hast affirmed my cau¦se / yu sittest ī iugement a rightwyse iuge. Thou hast sore blamed the hethē / the vn¦godly is fallē down ded / yu hast quenched their name for euer. O thou aduersary / hast thou distroied for euer / hast yu throwē downe cyties / is their memorial with thē ded / as yu thoughtest to bringe to passe. No verily / for the lorde raigneth yet styl for euer / his seat of iugemēt is made redy He shall iuge the worlde of his rightwys¦nes / & shal gyue sentēce vpō the people e∣uēly. The lorde shall be a refuge for the pore oppressed in tyme of afflictiō. In the shal they trust yt know thy name / for yu wylte nat forsake the sekers of the lorde. Synge ye to the lorde / whiche dwelleth in Sion / declare his noble fayt{is} among the people. For he maketh en∣querāce for murther / & forgetteh nat the bloudsheders / he shall nat forget the cry∣yng of the pore afflicte Haue mercy vpō
me (lord) behold my afflictiō which I suf¦fre of my haters / lyft me vp euē frō the ve¦ry thresshold of deth. That I myght re∣mēbre all thy praises within the gates of Siō / I shall reioyse of the helth which yu hast brought. The heythen ar drouned in their own pyt / and their fete ar tyed in their own net which they bet so preuily. Noble is the lorde & full wide is his po∣wer / ī yt the vngodly is th{us} trapped ī his own snare / for such is his praise. Selah. The vngodly shal slyde down to hell & al heithen yt forget god. But the pore for∣sakē shall nat be forgotē for euer / nether ye good hope of the aflicte shall alwaies be vayn. Arise lorde let nat the mortall mā p̄uayle / execute iugemēt vpō the he∣thē. Lord smite thē with feare / lerne the hethē to konw their selues mortal. Selah The argument into the .x. Psal. ¶ This psal. is a prayer against the peruerse / malycious / & importune men oppressynge & vn∣doyng the pore afflict with crafty violēce / in the which also their intollerable pryde / their vngod∣lynes & both their crafte to hurt and their studye are all descrybed. QUare dn̄e reces. Wherfore abydest thou so far (oh lorde) wylt yu be hyd frō vs in tyme of our afflyction? whyles the vngodly is a lofte he persecuteth the pore afflycte / let them be snared wt their
owne crafty deceyt which they study for. For what thīge so euer lyketh hym yt he prayseth / he bendeth him self al to lucre / he careth nat whither he speke wel or e∣uyll of the lorde. This vngodly man lo¦keth a loft / he regardeth nat that ther is any god neither is he in his thoughtes. What thinges he take in hāde / they pro¦sper a longe tyme to his minde / thy puny¦shement is lyfte vp high frō him / he thin¦keth to cast downe all his enemyes with a blast of his mouth. He thīketh in his hert I shal nat fal / I shal cōtinue throw out the worldes wythout hurte. His wordes swīme in periury / fraude / & de∣ceite / what so euer his tōge saith / it is in¦iury & shrewdnes. He lyeth bent to cat∣che decaied vyllages / he kylleth the inno¦cēt preuily / his eyes ar fast vpon ye pore wretches. He layeth pryuy watches / he lyeth bēt like a lion ī his dēne to deuoure the poore afflicte / he distroyeth hī whiles he drawe him into his net. He maketh him self like a sycke weyke man / but the pore afflyct fal away thorow his strēgth He thinketh in his herte / god careth nat for these mē / he turneth his face frō thē / & wyll neuer se thē. Aryse lord (oh god) lyft vp thy hāde / dyspise nat thy pore af∣flict. For how lōge shall this vngodly
blaspheme god? for he sayth in his here that thou seest nat. But thou seest ve∣rily / for thou beholdest īiury & indigna∣tion / & whā it shal please ye / thou wilt de∣clare thy selfe in very dede. The poore afflicte cōmitteth him selfe to the / which art wonte to be an helper to the yong fa∣therles. Al to breke the strength of the vngodly & hurtful man / folowe vpon hī / serchyng out his vngodlynes & than shal he nowhere apere. The lorde is kīge for euer / & these hethen vngodly haue peris∣shed & are fallē frō his erth. The desyres of the pore afflyct the lorde hath herde / yu shalt gyue them aquy minde / & thy eare shalbe intēt vnto thē. To delyuer ye yōg fatherles & pore oppressed so yt this mor∣tall mōstre be no more fered vpon therth. The argumēt into the .xi. Psal. ¶ Here Dauid chalengeth these men which ma¦de him to auoyde and to fle from euery parte of the lordshyp of Israhel / hauyng no place to hyde him He doth here also declare his trust in god / & magnifyeth his iugement agaynst bothe good & euyll. Rede the history ī the first of the kīges / frō the xxii▪ Cha. vnto the .xxvii. The tytle of the ps. For Dauides vyctory was thys Psal. songe. IN domino confido. I haue put my trust in the lorde / wherfore thā by byd ye me fle doune frō your hyl like a byrde▪ For lo / the vngodly haue bēt their bow
& haue set their arowes therin / to smyte the perfyte in hert espyed ī preuy places. For ther is no place sure to abyde ī / but what (I pray you) haue ye riʒtwise deser∣ued? The lorde is resydēt in his holy tē∣ple / in heuē is his seat regall / his eyes lo∣ke forth / he be holdeth to espie ye sōnes of mē. The lorde examyneth ye rightwise / but he hateth in his hert ye vngodli / & the man also yt loueth vyolēce & wronge. He wyl sēde fyer vpō the vngodly lyke rayn / brēning lyghtenīges / brimstō / and hote whirlwind{is} for such parte shall they dri¦ke. For rightwise is the lord / he loueth the rightwyseman & fauoreth the mayn∣tener of the ryght. The argument into the .xii. Psal. ¶ Here Dauid cōplayneth of the comen fall in euery place of rightwisnes and faith / & that the rafty deceytfull flaterers occupy all places: he prayeth the lorde to haue mercy of the poore af∣licte whom they vexe / & that he wolde helpe thē accordyng to his promise. SAluum me fac. Helpe lord / for ful few faithfull ar left among the chyl¦rē of mē. It is but vanite what so euer ne speketh to another / they flater falsly hewyng one thyng with their mouth / & oueryng another in their hert. The lor¦e shall cut these proude spekyng tonges ute of these false glauerynge mouthes.
Whiche say thus of tho thinges whiche we make / we wyll chalenge auctorite of our owne tonges / our mouth{is} ar the auc¦torite / who shulde be our lorde to cōmaū¦de vs. For the distruction of my pore af¦flicte / & for the waylyng of this nedeons now shall I ryse (saith the lorde) he shall saye wt him selfe / I shal brynge them in∣to sauyng helth. Nowe the speches of the lorde ar purespeches they ar lyke sil∣uer puryfyed & tried to the vttermoste in erthen caldrens. Thou lorde preserue these pore ones / kepe them from this wi∣ked nacion for euer. These vngodly ho∣uer about in euery place / & where suche bely best{is} ar promoted / there encrese the wicked children of men. The argument into the xiii. Psal. ¶ Here Dauid set in a Ieoperdous straight / called in his anguisshe to god for helpe: lefte his enemyes reioyse of his fall / & that he rather him selfe might reioyse of his receyued helth / & so magnifye worthely god his sauyour. USquequo. Howe lōge lorde wylte thou tarye? wylte thou forgette me for euer? howe longe wylte thou tourne thy face fro me? Howe lōge shal I thus cōtynue musinge with my selfe / fyllynge my herte full of sorowe daye by daye? Howe longe shal myne enemye be thus exalted ouer me? Beholde & answere me
lorde / my god / kepe me wakynge / lest the slomber of deth come vpon me. Ye / lest peraduenture myne enemye may saye I preuayled agaynste him / for if I fall my troublers wyll reioyse. But I trust in thy mercy / my herte shalbe gladde of thy helpe / I shall gyue thankes to my lorde for he hath rewarded me. The argumēt in to ye xiiii. & .liii. Ps. ¶ Here Dauid cōplayneth all to be full of vn∣godly & very damnable men: he descrybeth theyr naturall disposytion which there may no thynge be more corrupt / fylthy & / violent / & than he shew¦eth that vēgeaunce abydeth thē: & helth abydeth the innocētes whom they trede vnder their fete. DIxit insipiēce. The folyshe wicked men thinke in their hertes yt god is nat. Shrewde & abhominable thyng{is} do they / nowhere is ther one yt wyl do good The lorde loked frome heuens downe v∣pon the men / to se if there were any that had any knowlege or regarded god. And sayd / is euery mā & altogyder swar¦ued so farre frō the waye / perisshed & vn∣profitable / that there is no man that wyl do good / nat one? Are they so farre be∣sydes them selue all these workers of wykednes? Se / they deuoure my peo∣ple as one shulde ete vp brede / they are holden with no feare of the lorde. Wher¦fore they shall be feared with feare incō¦parable:
for god hath shakē the bones of thy besegers. Thou shalte dispyse the because god hath repelled them / for god is in the iust & rightwyse nation. They scorned thē because thei folowed the coū¦sell of the poore afflicte and put all theyr truste in the lorde. Oh / wolde god that the sauynge helthe wolde ones come to Israell from Sion / that the lorde wolde make an ende of the captiuite of his peo∣ple / that Iacob might be gladde and Is∣rahell myght reioyse. The argument into the .xv. Psal. ¶ In this Psalme is descrybed of what ly∣uynge and with what maners the ryght cyte∣zens of heuen and membres of Christes church muste be adorned and endued. DOmine quis ha. Lorde who shall dwel in thy tabernacle? Who shall sitte in thy holy hyll? Euen he that ly∣ueth in syngle & pure innocency studieth to do rightwisnes and speketh the truth euen frō his herte. He that backbyteth nat wt hys tonge / & in nothynge hurteth his neighbour / neither suffreth him to be reuyled or hurte vnworthely. But ab∣horreth suche sclanderous and noughtye persones / & suche as worshyp the lorde / he setteth moche by. Ye / & what soeuer he swereth / he wil {per}forme / although it be
to his great hurte & hynderaunce. And lendeth nat his money for auantage / ne∣ther receyueth gyftes agaynst any inno∣cēt. He that studyeth to do these thīges / shall abyde alwayes & neuer be moued. The argument into the .xvi. Psal. ¶ In this Psal. Dauid desyreth goddes helpe: affermyng that god hath no nede of his goodes: but that hys goodes oughte to serue his poore neighbours which he call saītes / & they that be∣stowe their goodes of any other thyng than pro¦fyteth these sayntes / make Idols with them. COnserua me domine. Defende me (god) for I haue trusted in the: o my soule saye yu vnto the lorde / my good{is} profyt the nothyng at all. I shall ther∣fore study with all my herte to helpe thy noble saintes / which yet lyue vpō therth For they which bestowe their goodes of any other thyng / shall make them ydols / and folowen feruently strange goddes. I shall nat offre their blody sacrifyce / no I wyll nat knowe ne remēbre the names of their idols. The lorde is the portion of my heritage & my substance / my lot is in thy hande. The lottes fell to me hap∣pely in to plesaunt places / a goodly riche heritage chaunsed to me. I shall thanke the lorde which hath well counseled me: but yet my raynes teach me these thyng{is} by nyght. I set ye lorde euermore before
myne eyes / for whyles he is at my ryght hande / I shall nat slyde. Wherfore my hert shal ioye and my tonge shall reioyse / ye / my body shall haue sure reste. For yu wylte nat so forsake my soule / yt it shulde go and abyde in the graue / neither wylte thou there suffre thy saynt to go into cor¦ruption. Thou shalt shewe me the path / wherin I maye go to lyfe / thy presence fylleth men wt all gladnesse / All ioye is euer oute layed by thy ryght hande. The argument into the .xvii. Psal. ¶ This psalme is a feruente prayer of Dauid to be delyuered from the persecutiō of Saull / as he dyd in the .vii. psalme declaring his innocēcye desyringe helpe: he descrybeth the proud behauy¦our & vayne study of his persuers: and at last he knowledgeth his felycite to stande in the know∣lege of god. The prayer of Dauid. EXaudi dn̄e iusticiā. Lorde / here my rightwyse prayer / & take vp my pe∣ticyon / gyue hede vnto my prayer / which I byd with pure mouthe. Let thy iuge¦ment declare my īnocency / shewe thy self to haue respecte vnto thy ryght. Serche my herte / & loke into it euen in the night trye me as metall with fyer / and yet shalt thou finde that my thought differ nat fro my wordes. I endeuer my selfe to auoy¦e mēnes wayes / accordynge to thy wor∣e / and I kept them in the way that fled
vnto me. Make fast my stepp{is} (I pray ye) in thi pathes / lest my fete slyde. Upon y• I call for yu art wonte to here me (o god) laye thyn eare to me & heare me speke. Declare thy excellent mercy / which arte wonte to saue me / trusting ī the frō the ri¦sers againste thy right hande. Kepe me euen as the aple of thin eye / & hyde me as though I were vnder the shadow of thy wynges. Hyde me frō the violēt vngod¦ly / hyde me frō my enemies closynge me in to take awaye my lyfe. Whiche haue their preuy riches / & speke proudly with their mouthes. Nowe lay they a wayte at our stepp{is} / theyr eyes haue they fast∣ned vpō vs to espie if thei may at any ty∣me cast vs to ye groūd. He lyeth bēt lyke a lyon euē flat downe for his praye to be deuoured / he lurked lyke ye yonge lyon in his priuy dēne. Arise lord & preuēt him / cast him downe / delyuer my soule frō the vngodly whō yu vsest for the swerde. De¦lyuer vs frō these mortall mē which are thy hāde wherwt thou smitest / euen ye mor¦tall mē addict to this worlde. Which de¦syer their {per}te in this presēt lyfe / to haue their beles fylled with thy treasure / and their chyldrē to haue ynough / & also to le¦ue to their neuewes. But I armed with thy ryghtwysnes shall beholde thy face
and shalbe satisfyed whā I shal vpwake arisynge in the beauteous symilitude. The argumēt in to ye xviii. ps. ¶ This psalme is a noble vyctoriouse songe / in the which Dauid first declareth his feruente trust in god. Than he expresseth with how gre∣uous yuels he was oppressed: afterward he shew¦eth the power of god / and his wyll toward him and that by the discription of a great tempeste / he sheweth his delyueraunce / his innocency / god¦des iugementes agaynst all men / his great vyc∣tory of his enemyes / the meruelous encrease of his kyngdome / his power for euer confyrmed / at laste concludyng the Psal. with a prayse and prophecye of Christe. Rede thistorye of Dauid in the two fyrste bokes of kynges. The tytle. The songe of Dauid the seruaunt of the lord whiche song this praise to the lorde whan nowe horow the lorde he hauynge the victorye esca∣ped the handes of Saul and of all his ennemies DIligam te. To thy mercye shall I cleue (lorde) which art my strēgth / The lorde is my rocke of stone / my bul∣warke / my delyuerer / my god / my defen∣der / vnto whose faithfulnes I betake my selfe / my childe / my sauynge power / my refuge. I magnifyed and worshypped ye lord / & so was I saued fro my enemies Dedly anguysshe inuaded me / and the soden rysynges lyke a rosynge flode of these men of perdicyon assailed me. The strayght helly ieopardes closed me ī / the
snares of deth hampred me. But while I was in this strait I called vpon ye lord I cryed vnto my god / and he harde my voyce in his king{is} hall / my cryeng came vp to his eares. For ye erth was moued and trēbled / the fete of ye hylles staggard and were smytten all to pouder / for he was angry. Smoke ascēded / as ye wold saye / into his nostrels / & fyer deuouringe all thinges flewe out of his mouth / & he spouted forth burnynge coles. He lefte the heuens & came downe / a derke cloude was vnder hys fete. He rydeth vpon a swyfte foule & flieth / borne with the win¦ges of the wynde. He made hī a preuye closet / powring darkenesse rounde about his tabernacle / congelīge ther vnto blac¦ke waters into thycke cloudes. But at his shyninge presence / these derke cloud{is} vanished awaye agayne / with haile sto∣nes / and fyry thunder boltes. The lorde thundred in the heuens the most hyghest sente forthe his voyce / with hayle stones and fyry thūdreboltes. He cast forth his arowes & threwe thē doune / he sent forth moche lyghtnynge / & cast them into gret feare Whyles thou thretenest & blamest (oh lorde) blowing forth thy wynde / the holowe bankes of the floudes ar sene vn¦der drye / & the foundations of the worlde
stande naked. He put downe hys hande from aboue and toke me vp / he drewe me out of moche waters. He delyuered me from mighty enemies / and frō my haters for they preuayled agaynst me. He pre∣uented me beynge in ieoperdye with hys helpe / the lorde was my socour. He led me forth and set me at large / he defended me bycause he fauoured me. The lorde gaue me after my ryght dealynge / and re¦warded me accordynge vnto the purenes of my hand{is}. I obserued verily ye way∣es of the lord & fell nat vngodlely fro my god. For I had all his decrees before myn eyes / & I dyd nat thruste awaye his lawe fro me. I behaued my self purely & {per}fitly toward him / & toke gret hede lest I shuld cōmit any yuell thīge. And ye lord hath rewarded my right dealynge / & the purenes of my hand{is} which he aproueth For yu art holy to the holy man / & offrest thy selfe pure to the pure man. With ye pure innocēt yu dealest pure innocently / & with the shrewde mā thou playest ye ouer whart. Thou hast veryly saued thy pore oppressed people / & hast cast down men yt loke alofte. Thou (lorde) hast lightened my cādel / my god hath put away my der∣kenes wt his lyght. Thorow the haue I broken the hole raye of the batayle / tho∣row
my god I ouerlept the walles. God is he whose dedes are pure and parfyte / the wordes of the lorde are purifyed / and tried lyke as with fyer / he is a buckler to all that truste in him. For who is god but the lorde? who is a defender / but our god? Euen the same god whiche hathe decked & endued me with a lordely power & hath furthered my waye spedely. He hath made my fete as light as the fete of gotes / and hath made me to ouerronne plac{is} were they neuer so hygh. He hath exercysed and accustomed my handes wt batayle / & hath made me to breke bowes of stele with my armes. Thou hast de∣fended me with thy sauynge shylde & bu∣kler / and thy right hande stayed me / thy fauorable gētylnes made me to haue the ouerhāde of my enemyes. Thou dydest hedge in my waye that I myght go fre∣lye therin / so that my heles shulde nat slyde. I folowed vpō my enemies & toke thē / & neuer turned vntyll I had slayne them. I slewe them / for they might nat stande in my handes / they were throwē downe vnder my fete. Thou hast taught me to fyghte / ye / and that with a puys∣saunte power / and as manye as rose a∣gaynste me / thou haste thruste them vn∣der me. Thou broughtest it so to passe /
that myne enemyes were fayne to turne their backes / and I made them awaye that hated me. They cryed / but there was no man to kepe them / they cryed to the lorde / but he answered them nat. I knocked theym togyther as small as dust layed redy for ye wynde / I trode thē as small as dyrte of the streates. Thou hast delyuered me from this chydynge / & contentyouse people / and haste made me ruler ouer the gentyles / the folke of whō I had lytell knowlege serued me. As so¦ne as they herde of me / they came to gy∣ther & dyd homage vnto me / the lyenge a¦lyauntes were made subiectes & seruaun¦tes vnto me. These aliaūtes were made drye for feare / and trembled whyles they were shyt vp in strōge holdes. And yet lyueth the lorde / my defendour moughte be praysed / and god my sauyour mought be exalted. Euen god which hath gyuen me power to auenge me of my enemyes / and hathe subdued the people to me. Which hath delyuered me from myne e∣nemyes / he hath set me ouer them which rose agaynst me / and hath delyuered me from the vyolent man. Wherfore I shall magnifye the (oh lorde) with hye praise amōge the nations / and shall synge with thankes geuynge vnto thy name.
Whiche hathe made great helth for hys kynge / he hath delte gentely with his a¦noynted Dauid / and also withe his seede into euerlastynge. The argumente into the .xix. psal. ¶ In this psalme Dauid declareth the exellent vertue & power of god / expressed in the merue∣louse creation of this present worlde aboue: and than he sheweth the preciousnesse of goddes law at the last he prayeth to be preserued from synne & that what soeuer he thīketh or speketh myght he plesante and accepte before god. CEli enarrant. The heuens declare the maiestye of god / and the fyrma¦mente sheweth what are his workes. One daye succedynge another / whetteth contynually our thoughtes / & one night folowyng another / encreaseth our know¦lege These creatures haue nether spech nor wordes / neyther is their voyces any where herde. And yet their poyntinge & shewynge hathe taught all the worlde / & their dōme speche hath gone forth īto all the cost{is} of ye worlde. He hath fastened in thē a tabernacle for ye sōne / this sōne co∣meth forth of his cloud{is} like a bridegrōe ye lyke a fresshe valyant knyght to make his course. From the farthest eest parte of the heuyns cometh he forthe / hauynge his recourse vnto the other extreme / nei∣ther is there any man that maye hyde hī
from his heat. The lawe of the lorde is perfyte / refresshynge the soule / the testy∣monye of the lorde is faithful / ministrīg wysdome to the vnleeued. The cōmaun∣demētes of the lorde are right / makynge glad the herte. The thinges whiche god cōmaundeth are playne & pure / & lyghtē the eyes. The feare of the lorde is pure and holy abidynge for euer / the plesures of the lorde ar true & right in euery parte. More worthy to be desyred than golde & precyouse stones / sweter than the honye combe whan it dropeth. And thy seruāt is taught & monisshed by thē / that same obseruynge of them is a great rewarde. Who maye perceyue and consyder what thynge is synne? purge me from secrete euyls. Also turne thou these great syn∣nes from thy seruant / leste they haue do∣mination ouer me / & than shall I be pure and clere from euery great synne. Let ye speches of my mouth & the thoughtes of my herte be plesaunte & accepte vnto the lorde my defender and my redemer. The argument in to the .xx. Psal. ¶ This Psal is a prayer in the which the peo∣ple prayeth for the helth of Dauid goyng to an harde & ieopardous bataile: & it is a ioyfull thā∣kynge for his helth & victory gyuen him of god. The tytle of the Psal. The dytie of Dauid commytted to the chaunter to be songe.
EXaudiat te dn̄s. Whan thou art in any strayte / than the lorde myghte here the / the name of the god of Iacob might set the in sauegarde. He myghte sende the helthe from his holy place / and from Sion might he strēgthen the. He might remēbre al thy offring{is} / & thy brent sacrifyces he might accept. Selah He might giue the thy hertes desier / and might stablysshe all thy entent. We shal reioyse in thy helth: in the name of oure god lyfte we vp our baners with trium∣phe / whan the lorde hathe gyuen the thy desier And let euery man saye / nowe do I knowe that the Lorde hath preserued his anoynted. He hath herde him frome his secrete heuenly place / ye / and that in the sauyng power of his right hande. Some trusted in their chariettes / & some in their horse: but we called vpō ye migh∣tye name of the lorde which is our god. Nowe they are thrust downe and all fal∣len: but we stande and are made faste. The lorde preserued vs / he is our kynge and answerith vs whan we call vpon hī. The argument in to .xxi. Psal. ¶ This Psalme is a victorious songe / in the which the people reioyseth with thankes for the victory & other benefytes of god / with the which he endued Dauid so excellently. And they prayse
god thorow whose goodnes he accepted all thin¦ges thankefully. DOmine in virtute. Lorde / ye kyng shall ioye in thy power / & shall re∣ioyse gretly in thy helpe. Thou hast gy∣uen him the desiers of his herte / and the prayers of his mouth thou hast nat tur∣ned awaye. Selah. Thou hast preuēted him with all maner of benefytes / yu haste set a crowne of precious stones vpon his hedde. He asked lyfe of the / & thou ga∣uest it him / ye / and that a full longe lyfe. Thy helpe tourned him to great glorye / thou hast endued him richely with noble fame & clerenesse. For thou hast set him in such estate / yt he may flowe {per}petually in all maner of goodnesse / thy cōfortable presēce maketh him glad. For this kīg trusteth in ye lorde / & he strengthned with the mercy of the moste highest shall nat swarue. Thy hande hath ouertaken all thy enemies / thy right hāde hath holden as many as hated the. Thou hast brent them lyke a brēnyng furnace / whan thy indignation wexed hote. The lorde swa¦lowed thē vp in his wrath / & fyer consu∣med thē. Their progeny perisshed from therth / & theyr postirite were worne out among the men. For they had bēt their myschefe vpon the / they began coūseyls
which they might nat bringe to passe. Thou shalt set them before the for a mar¦ke / that wt thy bowe thou mightest shote thē euen in their faces. Be thou lift vp lorde in thyne owne power / we shall sīge with prayse / and magnifye thy strength. The argumēt into the .xxij. Psal. ¶ Here Dauid declareth him selfe playnly to be the very fygure of Christ. wherfore first of al he syngeth & expresseth his great deiectyon and downe fall: & anon after his exaltatyon / his en∣crease & purchasynge of his kingdome / euen to the vttermost parte of the lande / & the contynu∣ance therof vnto the worldes ende. The title of the Psal. It is the songe of Dauyd cōmytted to the ouer chaunter to be songe of the erly herte or of the daye starre. DEus meus deus. My god / my god lo / wherfore forsakest yu me? howe farre is thy helpe from my out cryenge? My lorde shall I thus crie and call vpon the all daye / & yet wylte thou nat here? shall I crye all night and neuer ceasse? Uerily yet art thou that holy on whiche dwellest in Israhell extollynge the with prayse. Our fathers trusted vpon the they trusted vpon the & thou deliueredest them. They cryed vnto the & were dely¦uered / they trusted vpō the and were nat shamed. But as for me I am but a wor∣me and no man / euen the very approbry
of the men / and am abiecte frō the vylest folke. All that se me made but a laugh∣ynge stocke on me / they mocked me with their lippes / & wagged their hedd{is} at me. Sayeng / this vyllayne referred all thin¦ges to the lorde / let him nowe delyuer hī if he wyll / for he loueth hym well. But yet thou arte he whiche leddest me out of my mothers wombe myn owne re¦fuge / euen from my mothers teares. As sone as I came into this worlde / I was layde in thy lappe / thou art my god euen from my mothers wōbe. Go thou nat farre fro me / for my trouble draweth nigh / neither is there any mā yt wil helpe. There are beset me rounde aboute great sturdy steares / ye / that fatte bulles of Ba¦shan haue hedged me in. Lyke a rorīge lyon pantyng and gapyng for his prya / their mouthes ar open vpō me naked be∣fore them. I sanke awaye lyke water / all my bones shoke out of ioynt my herte within m melted away lyke waxe. The moyster of my body was dryed vp / and I was lyke a posherde / my tonge cleued to the sydes of my mouthe / thou  me to my graue. For euen lyke dogges they came about me / the chyhe of noy∣ous men hedged me in / they dygged tho∣row my hādes & fete. A mā might haue
tolde all my bones / and they gasyng vpō me thus petylesse entreated / toke theyr pleasure. They parted my ouer clothes to theym selue / & for my tother cote they casted dyse. But thou (oh lorde) be nat farre / o my strength / haste the to come & helpe me. Delyuer my lyfe from ye deth stroke / and my deare soule from the wod¦nesse of these dogges. Saue me from ye mouthes of these lyons / and defende my pore symplenesse frō the hornes of these vnycorns. I shall sprede thy name amōg my bretherne / in the myddes of the con∣gregation / I shall prayse the. I saye / ye that feare the lorde / se that ye prayse him all ye of the seede of Iacob glorifye him / and all ye of the progeny of Israhell fere him. For he hath nat despysed nor ab∣horred the troublouse afflyctyon of the pore / in no maner of wyse turneth he his face from hī / but whan he cried vnto him he herde him. I shall praise the in ye gret cōgregation / I shall {per}form my vowes be¦fore his worshippers. The meke mē shal ete and be satisfyed / they yt seke the lorde shal praise him / their hert shal lyue & ioye for euer. The dwellers in thextreme par¦tes of therth shal remēbre thē selues & be turned to the lorde / & all hethen nations shal fall downe before the. For the king¦dome

All the riche men of therth shal ete & do him homage / they shalbe bowed down before him & discēde in to their gra¦ues / for they may nat {pro}longe any lyfe to their soules. But their posterite shall ser¦ue him / & shalbe nōbred to ye lord for euer And thus their chylders chyldren shall shewe the rightwisnesse / whiche he hath gyuē to ye peple / which is yet to be borne ❧ The argumēt in to ye xxiii. ps. ¶ In this psalme Dauid declareth and setteth forth the maruelous suretie of the truste in god & also howe blessed a thīg it is. The song of Da. DOminus regit me. The lord is my pastore and feder / wherfore I shall nat wante. He made me to fede in a full plentuous batle groūde / and dyd dryue & retche me at layser by the sewte ryuers. He restored my lyfe & ledde me by the pa∣thes of ryghtwysnes / for his name sake. Ye / if I shuld go thorow the myddes of deth / yet wyll I feare non yuel / for thou arte with me / thy staffe & thy shepe hoke counfort me. Thou shalt sprede & gar∣nyshe me a table / ye / & that in the syght of myne enemyes thou shalte souple my hed with oyntement / and my full cuppe shall laugh vpon me. Ye / and thy mer∣cy and gentelnes shall folowe me all my

Dauid syngeth all thinges to be the lordes / howe wonderfull he hathe layde the foundation of the erthe vnder the see / & yet the erth appereth aboue it: He asketh a questyō who shall enter into the kyngdome of god / and answereth therto / cōcludynge all thinges be thei neuer so stoute & stronge to be obedyente to hys worde / and to be opened at his pleasure whiche is the moost valyant & gloriouse kinge. The ty¦tle of the psalme. The songe of Dauid. DOmini est terra. The erthe is the lordes / & all that is cōteyned in it: the rounde worlde & all that inhabyt it. For in the see hath he set his foūdatiōs / and hath buylded her aboue the flodes. Who shall clymbe into the hyll of ye lorde or who shall abyde in his holy place? An innocēte in his dedes / and he that is pure in hert / that hath nat extolled hīself proudly into vanyte / neither hath sworn for any disceyte. This man shalbe fedde with the blessynge of the lord / & with the mercy of god his sauyour. This is the nation gyuen all vnto him / & seketh him this is the very right Iacob· Selah.

The tytle of the psal, The songe of Dauid. AD te dn̄e leuaui. Unto the (oh lor∣de) I lyfte vp my mynde: my god I trust in the / let me nat be shamed lest min enemyes reioyse vpon me. For they shal nat be shamed who so euer depende vpon the: but they shalbe shamed that wrong∣fully hurte innocentes. Shewe me thy wayes lorde / & wonte me to thy pathes. Lede me forth for thy faithfull truthes sake / acquainte me with the / for thou art god my sauyour of whom I depende par¦petually.
Lorde remembre thy mercy & thy gracyouse fauour / for in these thyn∣ges thou excellest euē frō the beginnīg. But the synnes of my youthe withe my vngodlynesse also / remembre thou nat / remēbre me accordynge to thy goodnesse and for thy mercyes sake (oh lorde). Good and rightwyse is the lorde / wher∣fore he wyll instructe & tehe synners the waye. He wyll make the lowe lyons to go in rightly & in due order: & wyll teche meke men his waye. All the pathes of the lorde are mercy and faithfulnesse / to those men whiche kepe touche and coue∣naunt with him. For thy names sake (oh Lorde) forgyue me my wyckednesse / for it is very moch. Who soeuer that mā be that fereth the lorde / he shall tech him the chosē right waye. His mīde shall en¦ioye good thing{is} / and his posteryte shall possesse the lande as right heritage. The lorde is a secrete sure thynge to thē that feare him / & theym shall he make to knowe his conuenaunte and promyse. My eyes shalbe euer open vpō the lorde / for he wyll drawe my fete out of the net. Beholde me & haue mercye vpon me / for I am alone forsaken / full of afflyction. The sorowful sygh{is} of my hert encrease more & more / lede me out of mine āguish.
Beholde my poore state & my heuynesse / forgyue me all my sīnes. Consyder my enemyes / for they are full many  & wyth furiouse hatered they persue me.

father & my mother fayled me / there the lorde gathered me to him. Lorde teache me thy waye / & lede me forth in the right path frō them that laye awayte for me. Let theym nat take their pleasure vpon me which ar my troublouse enemyes / ly∣ynge wytnesses stode to gyther styffe a∣gainst me. Whose vyolence had greuous¦ly oppressed me / had I nat beleued to en∣ioye those thinges which ar good amōge the lyuyng men. Depende & wayte thou vpon the lorde / be thou stronge / it is he that shall strengthen thy herte / depende vpon the Lorde. The argument in to the xxviij. Psal. ¶ Here Dauyd expresseth his prayer / whereby he beynge in some great peryll: as peraduenture in the coniurayon of Absalon / fyrste desyreth the helpe of god: Furthermore he prayeth that he him selfe beynge innocente / might nat be ioy∣ned with the harmefull in vengeaunce takynge: than desyreth he / that worthy iugemente might fall vpon these vngodlye. After this he remem∣breth a▪ certayne Hymne / wherin he gyueth god thankes for his vyctorie and helhe / and laste of all / he byddeth a prayer for the people. AD te domine clamabo. Upon the lorde do I call / which art my stron¦ge defence dispyse me nat / neyther forsa¦ke thou me vnlesse I be lyke men lette downe in to their graues.
Here my prayer / whyles I crye vnto the and lyfte vp my hādes vnto thy holy tem¦ple. Plucke me nat into vengeaunce wt the vngodly / with those which study for shrewdnesse / spekyng pesable with their neighbours whyles they norissh euyll in their hertes. Gyue them as they deserue and after their malycious study / giue thē after their dedes / acquyte them their de∣seruynge. For they regarded nat the workes & dedes of the lorde / he shall ther¦fore destroye them / and nat edyfye them. Praysed be the lorde / for he hath harde the depe desyres of my mīde. The lorde is my strēgth he is my bukler in him tru¦sted my herte & I was holpen / wherfore my hert reioyseth and I shall magnifye hī in my sōge. The lord is their strēgth and a sauīge power to {per}serue his anoyn¦ted. Saue thy people / do good to thy heritage / fede and gouerne thē / and lyft them vp for euermore. The argumente in to the .xxix. psalme. ¶ This is a praise ī the which Dauid magnify¦eth god for his power & vertue whiche he decla∣reth by thunder & other heuenly tempestes. Also he reioyseth of his benifycence shewed vpon his people of Israhell. AFferte dn̄o. Giue vnto the lorde ye that excell in mighty power / gyue ye vnto the lorde honour and the prayse
of his power. Gyue the lorde worshippe worthy his name / honour ye lorde in his holy kinges halle. The voyce of the lor¦de is in the watery cloudes / God / whose maiestye is to be feared withe reuerence thundreth / the lorde is declared vpō gret waters. The voyce of the lorde is pas∣syng strōge / the voyce of the lorde is full of maiesty. The voyce of ye lorde smyteh togither ceder trees / the lorde breketh to¦gither the ceders of Libany. He maketh the mountaynes of Libany & Hierion to leape togither lyke calues / they ronne to¦gither lyke the calues of vnycornes. The voyce of the lorde casteth & cutteth forth fyrye lyghteninges. The voyce of the lorde maketh the desert to quake / the lorde made euen the deserte of Kades to tremble. The voice of the lorde maketh hartes & does to grone & to bray / & vnco∣uereth the thicke wodes / whiche all ma∣keth for his praise to be said in his tēple The lorde ruleth ouer the vnyuersall flo¦de / the lorde there kepeth resydens / a kyn¦ge euerlastyng. The lorde mynistreth strength to his people / the lorde is bene∣fyciall to his people / gyueng them pro∣sperous peace. The argument in to .xxx. Psal. ¶ In this psalme Dauyd gyueth thankes for
his helth restored / whervpon he declareth with a depe afflycte the goodnes of god which sēdeth aduersyte to his chosen for a good ende / whiche is but an hour in respecte to the ioyes euerlastīg here he maketh protestation that he desyreth nat longe lyfe but only to maynteyne and to encrese tho thynges which make for goddes glorye / and the helth of his sayntes. The tytle of the Psal. A songe or a dytie songe and played in the dedi∣cation of Dauides house. EXaltabo te domine. I shall exalte the (lorde) for thou hast axalted me / and hast nat made my enemyes to reioy∣se vpon me. Oh lorde my god / I haue called vpon the / and thou hast healed me. Lorde / thou haste led my soule forth of my graue / thou hast restored my lyfe lest I shulde haue gone downe into the pitte Ye sayntes of the lorde synge vnto him a prayse / and se that ye sprede his holye memoriall. For it is but a momēt that his wrath endureth / but longe is the ly∣fe y• cometh of his beneuolence. Wepyng and waylynge cometh in at the euen tyde but anon after / gladnes ariseth with the mornynge. Whan all thynges were pro¦sperous aboute me / I thought with my selue that I shulde neuer slyde. Lorde of thy good wyll / thou stablysshedest my kyngdome lyke an hyll / for as sone as yu haddest turned away thy face / I was a∣stōned

I sayd with my selfe / what profy∣teth my lyfe yf I be putte nowe in to my graue? shall the duste of my carcasse ma¦gnifye y• / or yet declare thy faythfulnes. Here lorde and haue mercy vpon me: lor¦de / be thou my helpe. Thou haste tur∣ned my mournynge in to ioye / thou hast shaken me out of my mournynge sacke / & clothed me with gladnes. Wherfore my tonge shall synge thy prayse / and shall nat cease (lorde my god) I shall magni∣fye the with prayse into euerlastynge. The argument in to the .xxxi. Psal. ¶ In this Psalme Dauid sheweth by what thynges he stablysshed his hope / what he desy∣red / of what thynges he complayned / and in what state he was / and mynde whan he was compassed in of Saules hoste in the deserte of Maon / whā he for anguysh of mynde he sought flyghtes / but al in vayne. After this he moueth vs to consyder the meruaylous goodnes of god agaynste euery man that feared him / and exhor∣teth to seke the knowlege of god which may nat forsake any that depende vpon him. IN te domine sperau. In the (Oh lorde) hau I trusted / lette me ne∣uer be shamed / for thy ryghtwysenes sa∣ke delyuer me.
Bowe down thyne eare vnto  spede y• to delyuer me / be yu my stonye rocke where vpon I myght sit fast / be thou my strōge defēced castell wherin yu maist p̄serue me. For thou art my rocke & my bulwarke / wherfore lede thou me forth for thy na∣mes sake / and take the charge of me. Lede me forth of the nete whiche they haue set so pryuely for me / for thou arte my strength. I betake my spiryte into thy handes / for yu shalt redeme me (lorde my god) which kepest true promyse at al tymes I hated these vaine witches ob∣seruynge inchauntementes / for I cleued and trusted to the lord. I shall ioye and reioyse vpon thy mercy / for thou hast lo∣ked vpon my affliction / and hast knowen my soule beynge in anguisshe. Neither hast thou shyt me vp in the handes of my enemyes / but hast set my fete at large. Haue mercy vpon me / for anguisshe and tribulation are come vpon me / my face / soule / & body / ar wasted away for anger. My lyfe is brokē sore with sykenesse and my yeres wt sorowfull sighes / my strēgth is wasted for sorowe of mīde / beholdyng thyng{is} amysse / & my bones wer cōsumed I was reuyled of all my aduersares / and chefly of myne owne neyghbours / myne owne famyliare acquayntance / abhorred

For I herde great offences put vpon me / ye / and that of ma¦ny men / fere closed me about whan they toke their coūsel togider agaynst me / for they coūselled craftely to take awaye my lyfe. But I trusted in the (O lorde) I sayd that thou arte my god. The tyme of my age is in thy hande / delyuer me frō the hāde of myn enemyes / euen from thē which persecute me. Lette thy presens shyne vpon thy seruant / saue me for thy mercyes sake. Lorde suffre me nat to be shamed for I haue called vpō the / let the vngodly be shamed and be nombred with thē that cease ī their graues. Let their liynge mouthes be made domme / which speke proude thynges arrogantly wt dys∣pite agaynst the rightwysmā.

Be ye stronge and he shal stablysshe your hertes / as many as depende and truste v∣pon the lorde. The argument into the .xxxij. Psal. ¶ In this Psalme Dauid declareth all puny∣shemēt to come for synne. wherfore he affirmeth that man to be happy whose synnes ar forgiuen also that the defēce of god cometh thorowe pure confessynge of our synnes vnto him and instant prayer / than techeth he howe men shuld knowe the iugementes of god whiche dealeth punyshe∣mente to the vngodly and good thynges to the good men / wherof the good men may greatly re∣ioyse in god. The tytle of the Psal. An instruc¦tion or a lesson of Dauid. BEati quorum. Blessed is he who∣se vngodlynes is forgyuen / & who∣se synnes are couered.

For day & night thy hande pressed me downe / my moyster was dryed vp / lyke as one tosted in the middes of somer. Selah. I shall know¦lege my synne and shall nat hyde my wy∣kednes. I thought sayeng with my selfe I shall confesse my vngodlynesse whiche is agaynst me to the lorde / and thou euē straight forgauest me my wickednes whi¦che openeth her self by my outwarde syn¦ne.

in the lorde / mercy closeth rounde about. Be glad therfore in the lorde / and reioy¦se ye rightwyse / make ye mery all faith∣full and vpright in herte. The argument in to the .xxxiij. Psal. ¶ This is a very prayse / worthy moche to be noted and red / in the which first he exhorteth vs to magnifye god: than he sheweth all thinges to be replenisshed with his goodnesse / making men¦tyon of his meruelouse creation & gouernance of this worlde. And at laste he syngeth one god to haue made & to gyue all thinges / and to be euer mercyfull presente with his beloued. EXultate iusti. Be glad ye rightwise for the lordes sake / for praise beco∣meth iust men. Magnifye ye the lord in prayse with harpe and lute / synge ye vn¦to him with ten stringed instrumentes. Synge ye vnto him a newe ditie / tune it swetely wt ioyfull melody. What soeuer the lorde hath institute / it is ryght / all his dedes procede of faythfulnes. He lo¦ueth to do all thinges ryghtwysly and in due ordre / therth swymmeth in the mer∣cy of the lorde. By the cōmaundement of the lorde / heuens were made / and all their ornourment at his byddynge. He gathered togyther & included the wa¦ters of the see / as ye wold say / into a bot∣tell / & layde vp their depnesses lyke trea∣sure. Let all regyons therfore feare the
lorde / let all ye inhabyt the rounde worlde drede him. For it is he / which so sone as he had spoke the worde / all thīges were presente / euery thynge standeth perfyte / euen as he cōmaunded. The lorde scate∣reth the counseyls of the heythen / & ma∣keth vayne the thoughtes of the people. But the counsell of the lorde stādeth for euer / the thoughtes of hys herte endure thorowe all worldes. Happy is that na¦tyon which hath the lorde for their god / euen the people whom he chuseth to him self in ye place of his possessed herytage. From heuens the lorde loketh downe / & beholdeth narrowly all men. From his sure seate / beholdeth he all the inhaby∣tours of ye erth. He made also the hert{is} of all men / he vnderstandeth what soeuer they haue done. A kinge is nat saued bi¦cause he hathe a great hoste / neither the valyaunte capitayne escapeth perylles thorowe his owne puissaunte power. That horse shall deceyue the / by whome thou lokest to be saued / he shall nat dely∣uer y• be he neuer so strōge. But behold it is the lordes eye that is vpon thē whi¦che feare him / & depende vpon his mercy. That he might delyuer their soules frō deth / & nourysshe thē in tyme of hunger. Our soules might truste in the lorde / he

The argument into the .xxxiiii. Psal. ¶ In this psalme Dauyd was moued of that same synguler benefyte / by the whiche god mer∣uelously preserued him whā he was knowen of Aches kynge of Palestine (whose kynges were called alwayes Abimelec) where he was in ieo{per}¦dy of his lyfe: prayseth excedyngly the cure and goodnesse of god agaynst his beloued. Exhortīg euery man to the dilygent study of īnocency and goddes worshippe / with the which who so euer are endued / they must nedes be delyuerd from all trouble / and bonde in all maner of goodnesse. The tytle of the psalme. The songe of Dauid after he had fayned himselfe madde before Abi∣melec / there changynge his mouthe & his wytte whom whan he had putte oute of his house / he wente his waye. Rede the historie in the fyrst of the kynges the .xxi. Chapiter. BEnedicam dn̄m. I shall praise and magnifye ye lorde at all tymes / his prayse shalbe in my mouth contynually. In the Lorde my soule shall glorye / the meke sprited shall here and be glad. Magnifye ye the Lorde withe me / and let vs extolle his name all to gyther. Busely sought I the lorde / & he answe∣red me / he delyuerd me from all thinges that I feared. Men shall loke vnto hī / & shall make hast / & their faces shall nat be shamed.
This poore afflycte persone / assoone as he called vpon hym / the lorde herde / and he preserued him frō all strayt anguyssh. Euen the angels pytch tent{is} roūd about them that fear the lorde / & delyuer them. Taste / & beholde howe good is the lorde / happy is that man that trusteth in him. Worshyppe ye the lorde whiche are his sayntes / for his worshyppers shall neuer want. Stronge lyons shall fainte & fa∣misshe for hunger / whan no good thyng shal fayle ye dilygent sekers of the lorde. Haue done children & here me / for I shal instructe you vnto goddes worshippe. Who soeuer thou art which desirest to ly¦ue / & louest longe lyfe: to delyte in good∣nesse. Kepe thy tonge from euyl report and thy mouth from disceytfull speche. Se thou do no man wronge / but bende thy selfe to goodnes / seke studyously and folowe vpō peace. The eyes of the lorde are fastened vpon the rigktwyse / hys ea∣res lysten vnto their cryenge. But the grīme coūtinance of the lorde is sette vpon these that do wronge / euen to cutte out their memoriall from therth. But those men crye & the lorde hereth / & he delyuereth them out of euery strainte. Full nyghe is the lorde men broken in herte / he saueth the contryte in spiryte.
Although full many yuels fal vpon the rightwyse / yet the lorde delyuereth them from thē all. He kepeth all their bones so that nat one of them be broken. But euery trouble shall make an ende of the vngodly / & the haters of the rightwy¦se shalbe shaken awaye. The lorde shall loose & redeme the lyfe of his seruantes / neither shall they be distroied whosoeuer cōmitte their selues to his faithful cure. The argument in to the .xxxv. Psal. ¶ In this psalme Dauid standynge fast in his innocēcy / lokyng surely for vengeance to be ta∣ken vpō Saule & his flaterers / abyding for god∣des helpe / desyreth the punisshmente of Saule with his flaterers / and helthe for himselfe: but these two thynges desyreth he natte: but for the good wyll of god for his glorie and prayse. IUdica dn̄e nocen. Lorde set agaīst my aduersaries / smyte downe them that fyght against me. Take anon vnto the / shelde & buckler / and ryse vp spedely to helpe me.

Let his iniuste vexatyon fall vpon hys own necke vnwares / let him be hampred in his owne nette which he hath hyd / let him fall into his owne mischef. But my soule mighte ioye in the lorde / & be glad of his helpe. All my inward partes shal say / lorde / who is lyke the? which dely∣uerest the weake afflict frō his stronger / and the sely vexed from the thefe. There arose vyolent wytnesses / & asked me thynges whiche I neuer thought. They aequyted me euyll for good / leuīg my soule all alone without any helpe.

But cleue thou to the lorde and study to do good / & thou shalt inhabite the lande / lede thy lyfe in good faithful∣nesse. Thou shalte delyte in the lorde / for it is he that shal gyue the what so e∣uer thy hert desyreth. What so euer thī¦ge thou takest in hāde committe the for∣theraunce thereof to the lorde / truste in him and he shall brynge all thynges to good passe. He shall lede forth openly thy ryghtwysnes euen lyke the lyght / & thy ryght lyuynge shall he make to shyne lyke the myddaye. Suffre / be styll / and let the lorde worke / abyde his pleasure / be nat angry with hī that prosper in his way / which is the man that is gyuen to deceyte. Refrayne thy selfe from wrath let thy angre be blowen ouer / be nat mo∣ued to reuenge. For who so euer ar har¦mefull and cursed shalbe cut awaye / but they that abyde the lordes pleasure shall inherite the lande. It shal nat be longe but the vngodly shalbe clene gone / thou shalt consyder his place / but he shall no where apere. Meke sprited with paciēt suffrers shall inherite the lande / and they
shall haue pleasure wt moche prosperyte. And for this cause the vngodly shal ha∣ue indignation at the rightwyse / & shall grynne vpon him with his tethe. But the lorde shall laugh him to scorne bicause he seith his daye of iugemēt at ye hande. The vngodly shall drawe out their swerdes / they shall bende their bo∣wes to smyte downe the poore carefull af¦flycte / and to sley the right treders in the way. But their swerdes shall smyte tho¦rowe their owne hertes / and their bowes shalbe broken. That lytell is better whi¦che the rightwyse mā hath / than the ma¦ny folde riches of the gloriouse vngodly. For the strength of the vngodly shall be brokē: but the lorde susteyneth the right¦wise. The lorde approueth the dayes of the parfyte faithfull / and their herytage shalbe parpetuall. In tyme of aduersyte they shall nat be shamed / in tyme of hun∣ger they shall be well satisfyed. Whan the vngodly shall perissh / and the enemys of ye lorde beyng in fatte pasture at their highest / than shall they vanisshe awaye lyke smoke. The vngodlye shall borowe & blowe to gyther other mennes goodes & neuer repay / but the rightwise shall do mercy & gyue forth gracyously. And they that do good to the rightwise
shall inheryt the lande / and they that do euyl shalbe cutte away. For of the lorde the steppes of this man are dyrected / & he fauoreth all theng{is} that he take in hāde. Whan he shall fall he shall nat be hurte / for the lorde putteth vnder his hande. Uerily I haue ben yonge and olde / and yet sawe I neuer the ryghtwyse forsa∣ken / or his seede beggynge their breed. But dayly he doth mercy & lendeth / and his seede is in a blessed encrease. Eschewe euyll & do good / & thou shalte abyde for euer. For ye lorde loueth that yt is done rightly & in good order / neither forsaketh her his saintes / but they shalbe layd vp for euer / whan the seed of the vn∣godly shalbe cut of. The rightwyse shall inheryt the lande / & shall dwell vpō it for euer. Wysedōe shall euer be in ye mouth of the rightwyse / and his tonge shall be occupyed ī that which god iugeth good. The lawe of his god is in his herte / the steppes of his fete they shall nat slyde. The vngodly beholdeth the rightwyse / and seketh occasyon to sleye hym. But the Lorde wyll natte leaue hym to his hande / neyther shall he repute hym vngodlye / all thoughe he be so iudged of the wicked. Abyde the lorde and ob∣serue hys waye / and he shall exalte the

For my synnes haue pressed downe my hed lyke an hea∣uy burden / they are heuyer than I may beare. My old preuy sores festered wtin and nowe ar they broken forth / for myn owne folysshenes. I am depressed and sore broken / I walke in cōtynuall mour¦nyng. For a foule botche occupieth all my thyghes / so that there is no helth in my fleshe.

My frendes and my fe¦lowes stode agaynst my wounde / and my nyghe kynnesfolke stode all a farre. In the meane seasō they that sought my soule made snares for me / and they that hunted for my faute spoke deceyt / whis∣perynge to deceyue me contynually.

But in the meane season my enemyes ly¦ue and wexe stronge / euen they whiche persue me falsly are encreased in power. Which acquite me euyll for good and ar agaīst me / because I sought studyously to profyt them. Forsake me nat / lorde / be nat ferre fro me / my god. Spede y• to helhe me / lorde / my sauynge helth.

By the re¦son of longe sylence I was made so dom¦me / that I might nat speke of any thyng were it neuer so good / but ī ye meane sea∣son my sorowe freted / me inwardly. My herte brent within me lyke fyer / whi¦les I mused with my self / breakynge to no man my mynde. But at last I losed my tonge / and I brake forth in to these wordes. Sewe me / lorde I besech the / what myne ende shall be or what shall be the measure of my lyfe / let me knowe / I beseche the / howe shorte is my tyme. Lo / as for my dayes they ar but an hād¦full / ye / they are nothynge to the / what sayd I? ye euery man / stande he neuer so faste is but vanite and nought. Selah.

I helde my pease / & opened nat ones my mouth / for thou madest me thus to do. Take awaye therfore thy plage / for thy strōge hāde hath almost made an ende of me.

Blessed is that mā that setteth the lorde before him for his hope / & hath no respecte to the proude men le∣uynge to vaine lyes (the truth forsaken) Many thinges hast thou done (lorde my god) thy noble dedes and depe counsels as cōcernynge vs / no man maye compre¦hende / no man maye shewe ne expresse them / neyther maye they be nombred. Thou delytedest neyther in sacrifyce nor in oblation / but hast opened my right ea∣res to here the / neyther brente sacrifyce / nor yet any slayn beest hast thou desired. And than I sayd / lo / I myselfe am here presente / of me it is wrytten in the bokes of the lawe. It hath lyked me well to do thy wyll / my god / thy lawe is set faste wt in me in my very herte.

DEus auribus. Oh god / we haue herde with oure eares / our fathers also tolde vs what heuēly workes thou hast done in their time before our dayes.

Thou gauest vs in to their mouthes ly∣ke a flock of shepe / thou scatredest vs a∣mong the gentyls. Thou soldest thy pe∣ple for nought / so that in this chaunge there arose no a vātage. Thou settedest vs vp to be a reuilyng stocke to our ney∣bours / to be scorned & shamed of thē that dwelt aboute vs. Thou settedest vs vp for aiestynge stocke to the heythen / we were a cōmen iest amonge them / so that who so euer se vs / wagged their heddes at vs. All wayes is myne ignominy be¦fore myne eyes / & euen very shame made me to couer my face.

Blessed is he whome thou hast chosen / & whom thou haste taken to the / to dwell in thy house. For he shall be satisfyed with the good thing{is} of thy house & of thy holy temple. Of thy meruelouse rightwysnesse shalte thou graunte vs / oh god oure sauyour) wherefore they shall truste in the / al that inhabyt the farthest costes of the erthe / & of the longe see. Thou arte he which set¦test the hylles in theire strengthe / gyrte
rounde aboute with power. Whiche swageste and peaseste the feerse rorynge of the sees / & ceassest the noyse of their floudes / and the wood furye of ye hethen. They that are in the extremest partes of the erth / shall feare at thy won¦derfull tokens / them that dwell at ye east and at the west thou shalt make glad. Thou hast vysyted the erth with rayne whan it was full drie / thou hast made it very riche and plentuouse / the ryuer of god floweth full of water / thou shalt ma∣ke her wheate to encrease luckely / for so is it thy pleasure to endue it. Laye playne her euyn vorowes / & moist theym temperatly withe swete showers / and blesse thou the spiringe of hir corne. Thou shalte leade the eare aboute with thy gentyll fauour / thy cloudes shall dro¦pe fatte plentuousnesse. There shall fall droppes vpon the man∣tions of the deserte / the hylles shall ioye couerde rounde aboute with plentuouse fruite. The playne feldes shall be coue∣ted with flockes of shepe / and the valeys shall be fylled with corne / wherfore eue∣ry man shall synge and make melody. The argument into the .lxvi. Psal. ¶ This Psal. is a gyuinge of thankes for the
delyuerance of the people of Israhell frome the tyranny of the vngodly. The tytle. The song of Dauid / commytted to the chaūter to be songe. IUbilate. Make ye melody to god / as many as inhabyt the erthe. Gyue ye glorie vnto his name in syngīg gyue ye vnto him gloriouse prayse. Saye ye vnto god / oh / howe fearfull are thy dedes for thy wyde power / euen thy enemyes shall come crepynge & crouchīg vnto the. Unto the shall {pro}fesse homa∣ge & worship / all that dwell vpon therth / they shall syng vnto the / they shall synge vnto thy name. Selah. Come hyther & se the workes of god / se his fearfull wor¦kes towarde men. He turneth y• sees in to drie lande / he maketh men to go tho∣rowe the see drie shode / & there we reioy∣sed of his power. He turneth the worlde by his power / his eyes loke vpon the hei¦then / these backslyders from his trouthe shall neuer be promoted. Selah. O people / magnifye ye our god / prayse him with loude voyces. This is he that hath preserued the lyfe of our soule / and hath nat suffred our fete ones to slyde. Uerily god hath {pro}ued vs / he hath tryed vs wt fyre / as men were wōt to try siluer. Thou broughtest vs in to a strayte / and charged our loynes with heuynesse.
Thou laydest sore men vpon our heedes we were brought in to fyre & water / and thou leadest vs out agayne in to a place where we were well refresshed. I shall go to the lorde at all tymes / I shall paye vnto the my vowes. Whiche I promy∣sed with my lyppes & made wt my mouth / whan I was in afflyction. I shall offre vnto the fatte sacrifyces with the ricke & sauour of motton / I shall brēne vnto the oxen & gotes. Selah. Come ye hyther as manye as feare god / and beare what thynges he hath done to my soule. I called vpon him with my mouthe / and with my tonge I exalted him. If I had set my mynde vpon iniquite / thā god had nat herde me: but nowe god hath herde & gyuē hede vnto my prayer. Praised be god which hath nat repelled my prayer / nether hath he wtdrawē his mercy fro me The argument into the .lxvii.

The people might sprede thy name / oh god / ye all people mought magnifye the. The erthe also myght gyue agayne her encrese / and god whiche is our god myght do vs good. God mought blesse vs / and all that in∣habit the erth / euen vnto the vttermoste partes therof mought feare him. The argumēt ī to the .lxviii. Psal. ¶ In this Psalme Dauid syngeth his victorie obtayned of the alyauntes / as of the Syrins / that the Acdomites and the Amonites. EXurgat deus. As sone as god ry∣seth to helpe / his enemyes are dys∣persed / they flee from him that hate him. He putteth them to flyghte lyke smoke / as waxe melteth agaynste the fyer / euen so wast the vngodly from the presens of god. But the ryghtwyse ioye and are glad before god they leape for ioye. Synge ye to god / synge to his name / lif¦te him vp rydynge vpon the ouermoste heuens / THE LORDE is his na¦me / ioye ye before him. The father of ye fatherlesse / helper of widowes / euen god syttynge in the seate of his secrete holye place. Euen god which giueth chyldrē
to the bareyne / and loseth men holden in feters / but the forsakers of hī shal dwell in ye wyde bareyne desert. Oh god / whā thou wenyst forth before thy people / and walkedest thorow the deserte. Selah. The erthe was al to shaken and moued / and the heuens droped at the presens of this god of Sinay / ye of god / euen the god of Israell. But / o god / thou scat∣tedest rayne in good tyme vpon the erth whiche thou chalengest be ryght herita∣ge / and whan it fayled thou restoredest it agayne. That this flocke myght dwell there in / yu hast so prepared for the poore oh god. afflycte / that they enioye thy goodes The lorde hath brought it to passe that womē shulde bryng good tydynges / and syng the vyctory of riʒt gret powers Kynges cōpassed with gret hostes haue fledde / they haue fledde / & the weake peo¦ple that sate at home deuyded the spoyle. Also if ye had ben as blacke as men syt¦tynge amonge pottes / nowe shall ye be white / as though ye were couerd wt dou∣ues fethers / which are as whyte as syl∣uer / and her winges as yelowe as golde. Whan / for her sake the almyghty god broke downe the kynges / she was made as whyte as the hyll zalmon. The hyll of god is fat / as is Bashā / it is
an hyghe hyll / a fatte hyll lyke Bashan. Wherfore sette ye so out youre selues / ye hyghe hyll{is}? this hill of god is a plesaūt habitacyon / for the lorde dwelleth in it perpetually. The horsemen and chari∣ettes of god are thousande thousandes / ye many thousandes of Angels / the lor∣de is in mydde monge them in his holy place. Thou hast lyfted vp thy selfe and hast take them whom thou wylt lede cap¦tiue / thou hast receyued some mē among as gyftes. And euen the forsakers of yt thou hast cōpelled to obaye the / for that in this place god wyl haue his seate whi¦che hath his beynge of him selfe. Praysed be the lord at all tymes / he miʒt encrese his benefytes vnto vs / the very same god which is our sauyour. Selah. God which is to vs both god & sauioure is the lorde hauynge his beynge of hym selfe / in whose handes ar dyuerse kynd{is} of deth. Uerily god hath smittē the hed of his enemyes / euen the very crowne of the hedde of the synful man. The lorde sayd / I shall restore my welbeloued / euen as I dyd ones restore them from Bashan ye I shall brynge them agayne / as I dyd ones from the botome of the see. Wherfore thy fote shalbe red with blode and thy dogges tonges shalbe redde with
the blode of thy enemyes / bothe wt theirs and with the bloude of the kynge. Thy beloued se / thy solemne goyng{is} (o god / euen the goyng{is} of my god / my kyn¦ge) syttīg nobly in his holy secrete place Singers go before / there folowe plaers at the orgayns / in the mydd{is} wente ther yonge maydēs playeng vpon tympanes In the congregations prayse ye god the lorde / euen ye whiche are of the seade of Israhell. There were of the lytell tribe of Beniamin certayne whiche bore rule the prynces of Iuda / their strength / the prynces of zabulon / the prync{is} of Naph∣thalim. Thy god hath gyuen the thy strength: stablysshe (o god) that thinge which thou hast wrought for vs. In the temple at Hierusalem / euen kyn∣ges shall brynge the gyftes. As thou sharply blamest the speare mē with thy myghty power amonge the ca∣pitayns of the hoste / so makest thou thē to yelde and to become trybutaryes pay∣enge their syluer. Caste downe the peo∣ple whose delight is to haue batayle. There shall come of the moste nobleste from Egypte / & Inde shall stretche forth her handes swyftly vnto god. Ye kyng¦domes of the erth synge ye to god / synge ye with prayse vnto the lorde. Selah.
Whiche rydeth vpon the heuens / ye vpō the euerlastynge heuens / lo / he putteth forth his voyce / ye and that a voyce full of power. Gyue ye to god the prayse of strength / his cleare maiestie is vpon Is∣rahell / his strength is in the clowdes. Thou art to be feared / o god / ī thy secret holy place / the god of Israhell / he shall gyue strength and power to the people. Praysed be god. The argument into the .lxix. Psal. ¶ In this Psal of Dauid / which is the fygure of Christ the hed of all faithfull mē (whom it be∣cometh to be cōformed and made lyke their hed) is cōtayned a gret complaint as of one beyng in greuous present perels / and afterwarde a feruēt prayer for delyueraunce. SAluum me fac de{us}. Saue me god / for waters are rysen so hyghe vpon me / that I am in peryll of my lyfe. I stycke fast ī the depe toughe claye ī the which I can nat cōtynue / I am brought into the depe floude and the violent stre∣me carieth me awaye. I am wery of cri¦ynge / my throte is hoorse / my syghte is wasted with lokynge vp vnto my god. They y• odiously persue me fautlesse / are mo in nombre than the heares of my hed they haue preuayled which vndo me caus¦les / & they whette their enymite vpō me they constrayne me to paye tho thynges

Oh lorde / the lorde of ho¦stes / lette them nat be shamed for my sa∣ke whiche depende on the / oh god of Is∣rahel / lette them nat be confounded that seke the. For I / for thy sake haue bor∣ne the opprobrye / shame and ignominye couerd my face. I was made a strāger to my bretherne / & an alyaunte to my mo∣thers children. Euen the very loue that I bore to thy house ete me vp / the pro¦bryes whiche the vngodly cast agaynste the brente me sore. I gyue me to we∣pynge / my body do I scourge with fastīg and for thus doynge / I am reuyled. I clothed me ī heare and sacke for their sakes / and they iested vpō me. They fabled vpon me that sat at the ga¦tes / and the dronken men in tauers ma∣de songes vpon me. But I / lorde / ī the meane tyme made my praier vnto ye whā tyme was offred me / oh god / for thy in∣fynite mercy & trouthe heare me / for the whiche thou were wonte to helpe. Delyuer me from this tough claye / and suffre me nat to be drowned / lette me be delyuered frō these odious persuers / euē from these depe waters.
Let nat ye streme cary me away / neyther the depthe swalowe me in / nor the pytte shytte her mouth ouer me. Answere me / oh lorde) for full gentyll is thy mercye / loke vpon me after thy great humanite. And hyde nat thy face from thy seruāt / for I drawe an heuy crosse / spede the to here me. Ioyne the to my soule and re∣deme it / lose me fro my enemyes. Thou knowest what approbri / what sha¦me / and howe greate confusyon I bere / they that trouble me are in thy syght. Opprobrie hath broken my herte / I am scourged / I loked for one to ease me wt cōfortable word{is} / but ther was none / I loked vp for cōforters / but I foūde non. For meat / they gaue me gall / & whan I thirsted they gaue me to drīke vinagre. Let their own table be their trappe / and their owne frendes their snares. Let their eyes be blynded leste they see / and make their loynes euermore to slide. Powre forth thy wrath vpon them / and let thy heuy indignation take them. Let their houses be desolate / and lette there be no man to inhabyt their taberna¦cles. For they saye that they persecute him / whom thou woldest to be smytten / and they boste them selfe to chasten hym whom thou commaundest to wounde.
Make that vnto these mē one wickednes be heaped vpon a nother / and let theym neuer be partakers of thy rightwisnesse. Let them be blotted oute of the boke of lyfe / & let them in no wise be written with the rightwyse. But me / oh god) for as moche as I am afflycte / pore & full of so∣row / thou shalt delyuer with thy sauyng helpe. I shall prayse the name of god wt songe / I shall extoll him with solempne prayse. For this shall be more accept to the lorde / than oxe and calfe / whiche are armed with hornes and houfes. Meke spryted men shall se these thynges and shall reioyse / the sekers of god shall se these and their hertes shall lyue. For the lorde heareth the pore / and mē layed in prison for his sake he hath nat dispised. Heuens & erth shall loue him / the sees also / & what so euer moueth ī thē For god shall saue Syon / and shall pre∣serue the cyties of Iuda / there shall men dwell & possesse that lande be riʒt inhery¦taūce The posterite of his seruātes shal receyue it for their heritage / who so euer loue his name shal haue their seate therī. The argument into the .lxx. Psal. ¶ In this ps. Dauid desyreth spedy helpe & pu∣nisshmēt for his aduersaries / and ioyeth for his helthe amonge the faithfull. The tytle of the
Psal. The songe of Dauid committed to the chaunter to be songe for a remembraunce DEus in adiutorium. Oh god spe∣de the to delyuer me / oh lorde haste the to helpe me.

Be thou vnto me a rocke of stonne / in the whiche I myghte kepe me and to the whyche I myght euer flee / hitherto haste thou taken charge of me

For thou art he of whom I depende / lorde / lorde / thou arte the sa∣me vnto whome I haue cleued sy then I was a chylde. Thou sustaynest me fro my mothers wombe / thou dreweste me oute of my mothers bely / my laude and prayse is vpon the contynually. I am made a wondrynge stocke vnto many men / but thou arte my stronge de∣fense. My mouthe shall be yet fulfylled with thy prayse / lette it dayly extoll thy cleare maiestie. Caste me nat awaye in myne olde age / forsake me nat whan my strength shall fayle me. For they spoke vpon me among them selue / & they whi∣che lay awayte for my soule haue coūsey¦led in vayne. Sayeng / god hath forsa∣ken him / folowe vpon him / and take him for ther is no man that wyll delyuer him God / be thou nat farre fro me / my god spede the to helpe me.

But I shall tary for thy helpe / and shall excede all men in thy prayse.
My mouth shall dayly speke of thy right¦wysnes and sauynge helth / for I knowe no ende of thy benefytes. I armed with the strēgth of the lorde hauīg his beyng of him selfe shall come: & remembre thy rightwysnes onely.

Ye verily / thou shalt nat forsake me euen vnto mi old age and hore heares oh god / whiles I shewe forth thy mighty power vnto this present generation / and thy strēgth vnto all the posterite to come And whyles I extoll thy ryghtwysnes oh god / which hast done so great thyng{is} o god / who maye be compared vnto the? Which hast made me to fele many & gre∣uous adflictions / and thou peased again shalt quicken me / & shalt bryng me agayn euen from the depest of the erthe.

Oh god / gyue thy authorte in iugement vnto the kyn¦ge / gyue the kinges sonne thexecucion of thy iustyce. He shall haue to do with the people of his rightwysnes / and shall de∣le euenly with thy poore afflycte. Mountaynes shall bringe peace vnto the people: & ye hilles shal bringe thexecucion of rightwisnes. He shall delyuer in iuge¦mente the poore afflycte people / he shall kepe the nedyons / he shall smyte downe the vniuste vexers of men. Men shall worshyppe the / as longe as the sonne & mone shall shyne in to euery age. He shall come down lyke small rayne in to a newe mowen medowe / & lyke rayne which sokingly maketh moist the erth. Rightwismen shall florisshe whyles he raigneth / & there shalbe moche peace en∣durynge as longe as the moone. He shall haue dominyon from the one se to the tother / and from the east floude vn¦to the worldes ende. Before him shall
fall downe the dwellers of the deserte / & his enemys shall lye {pro}strate lyckinge the dust. The kynges of Tharsis & of the yeldes shall gyue him gyftes / the kinges of Sheba & Sebashall offre vnto him ho∣nourably. All kynges shall do homage vnto him: all nacyons shall serue him. For he shall delyuer ye pore that cryeth vnto hī / & the man in heuynesse without helpe. He shall haue pytie and mercy on the poore nedyons / and he shall kepe the soules of them that are in afflyction. He shall redeme their lyues from fraude and vyolence / and precyouse shall their blode be in his syght. He shall lyue and shall haue giuen him of the golde of She¦ba / men shall blesse him all tymes & shall sprede his fame. And the erth shalbe so fruitefull that of an handfull of wheate there shall aryse suche plentie in the hyl¦les / that it shall waue with the wynde ly¦ke the thicke highe trees of Lybani / and shall growe forth before the cyte as thic∣ke as grasse.

Asaph songe this psalme for the consolacyon of the faithfull: whiche freate them selfe and ar offended at the filycitie of the vngodlye. The tytle. The songe of Asaph. QUam bonus de{us}. Right good sure¦ly is god vnto Israhell / euen to tho¦se men which are pure in herte. But my fete were almoste gone / my fo∣tynge had almost fayled me. For that ye good fortune of the folysshe wicked men set me so a fyer / whan I se such prospery¦te of the vngodly. For they are neither cōbred ne constrained to deth / but thei ar well lykynge / they thriue / and ar lusty. They are nat oppressed with heuynesse lyke other men / they knowe nat the so∣rowe and care that other men abyde. Wherfore pryde hath closed them roūde aboute / & they are clothed with vyolence as with garmentes. They are so full of felycite and welth that they swelle / they sette forthe them selues in the imagyna∣tyons of their owne hertes.
They thynke to be holden and brideled with no lawes: they booste their mische∣uouse vexation / they speke from a lofte. They haue lyfted vp their mouthes into heuē / their tōges walked all ouer therth. They called their peple vnto ye same stu¦dy / & made them to drynke of ye same full cuppe. Wherfore the peple was moued to saye within theym / howe myght god knowe these thynges? what knowlege maye there be in god aboue? Se / saith they / these are vngodlye men / and yet are they blessed in thys worlde / and swymme in plentuouse ryches. Uerily as for my selfe / I trowe I haue kepte my herte pure / and haue studyed to haue handes wasshen withe innocentes / clene from wickednes / but all in vayne. For I haue ben scourged daily / & I suf∣fred my chastisynge euery mornynge / ye / and that erly. But if I shall thus iuge and speake of these thynges / I shulde be iniuriouse vnto the natyon of thy chldrē. I mused and studyed fore to know these thing{is} / but it was laborious & hard to se it. Untyll I was brought into the se∣crete holy places of god / and was taught to make the ende of these men. Surely thou haste set theym in a slybery place / euen to cast them downe / and to be
vtterly distroied. Oh / howe sodenly wer they cast downe / & made an ende of / they were distroyed with sodayne mischef. They were but as a dreame of a man so¦denly / awake / oh lorde / euyn their imag{is} & pictures hast thou made spitfull in the cytie. Surely my herte bleded in bytter¦nes / and my inward partes were stinged and as pricked wt nedles. I was a sotte & perceyued nothynge at all / I was lyke a brute beest before the. And yet / nat wt∣standyng / was I alwayes with the / thou heldest my right hande fast in the hande. Thou ledest me at thy pleasure / & after¦warde tokest me vp & helpedest me glori∣ously. Whom therfore in heuen / whom in erth shuld I honour & worshyp but y•? My flesshe and my herte longe sore for y• oh the very strength of my herte / god is my porcion for euer. For lo / they that absente thē selfe longe from the / shal pe∣risshe / yu wilt distroie as many as forsake the. But I thought it good for me to cleue to god / I sette the lorde before me for my defense to thentent I wolde shewe forth thy workes. The argumēt ī to the .lxxiiii.

Lyfte vp thy selfe / and come to distroye for euer all enemys / which haue brought all myschefe vnto thy holye temple. Thy aduersaries haue rored in the myd∣des of thy Synagog{is} / they haue set vp their baners in token of the vyctorye. Lyke as in tyme paste full exellent & no∣ble was the workes & dilygence of them which cut downe with axes great trees / to the buyldynge of the temple. Euyn so nowe are therof lyke dilygēce & labour / to distroye & to breke the carued images in it with twybyll & hammers. They haue brente it in the fyer / & thus they throwīg downe the house of thi na∣me into therth / haue prophaned & pollu∣ted it. They thought in their mīde say∣enge / let vs also slaye them all to gyther
and they haue brente vp all the sinagog{is} of god in the erth. We se nat the tokens and myracles whiche god was wonte to shewe for vs / there is no prophet left vs / there is no man with vs which haue any knowlege / but howe longe shall this en∣dure? What ende / oh god / shall thy ad∣uersarie haue that thus shamfully reuy∣leth the? what shall become of this sclan¦derouse enemye / whiche thus vngodlye blasphemeth thy name? Wherfore haste thou plucked backe thy hande? holde nat thy righte hande thus styll in thy bosome. Uerily thou arte god which hast hytherto ben my gouer∣noure / thou arte euyn he that bryngest helth into the myddes of the erth. Thou verily thorowe thy power trou∣blest the see / thou breakest the heedes of the dragons in the waters. Thou knockest togyther the heedes of the greate whales / and gyueste them for meate to the people of the deserte. Thou breakeste vp the sprynges / thou makest drye the floudes. The daye is thyne / the nyghte also be∣longeth to the / thou haste ordeyned the lyght and the sonne. Thou hast ordeyned & sette all the costes of the rounde worlde / somer and wynter

Let not the lyfe of thy turtle douue come into the cō∣panye of these aduersaryes / the company of the pore afflicte forget nat for euer. Loke vpon thy {pro}myse / for among these blynde wretches of the erth all are full of vyolence & trouble. Turne nat awaye from the / these pore lowelyous wt shame but rather cause these pore afflycte nedi∣ons to prayse thy name. Aryse god & gyue sentence agaynste thy aduersaryes remēbre howe blasphemously they reuy¦led the / and how chorlysshly these wicked men deale with the dayly.

The argument into the .lxxviii. Psal· ¶ This Psalme warneth vs nat to forget the noble actes of the lorde and his wonderfull bene¦fytes done for his people led out of Egypte / and brought into the lande of Canaan. The tytle of this Psal. An instruction shewed vnto Asaph. ATtendite popule meus. Take hede my peple vnto my lawe / bowe dow∣ne your eares vnto ye word{is} of my mouth I wyll open my mouth into parables / & I shall speke olde derke sentēces of gra∣uite. Euyn those thīges which we haue herde / & knowen our fathers to haue told vs. There was nothing hid from their chyldren that succeded them / for euer one tolde a nother the lordes prayses / & put eche other in remēbrance of his stronge
power and meruelouse thīges whiche he wrought. He gaue this cōmaūdement vnto Iacob / & put this lawe vnto Israel whan he cōmaunded the fathers to decla¦re these thynges to their chyldren. That their posterite might knowe these thinges / & their chyldren whan they are waxē / might shewe the same to their chyl¦dren also. And so to put their confydēce & trust in god / & nat to forget the workes of god but to obserue his cōmaūdemētes And nat to be lyke their fathers whiche were a frowarde nation & fallynge out of kynde / a nacyon that dyrected nat their hertes / and their spirytes cōmytted nat their selues stedfastly to god. The sōnes of Ephraym well armed and good ar∣chers / turned their backes in battayle. They kepte nat touch wt god / they wolde nat lyue after his lawe. They forgot his workes / & his noble actes whiche he dyd for their sakes. For he dyd wonderfull thing{is} in the lāde of Egypte / in the felde of Tanys / their fathers beynge present. He deuyded the see and led them thorow he made the waters to rōne togyther stā¦dynge vp lyke walles of their ech syde. He led thē forthe by daye vnder a cloude and euery night with cleare lyght. He cutte in sondre the rocke of stonne in
the deserte / and gaue thē drinke out ther∣of lyke as out of a great depe water. He led ryuers forth of the stonne & made the waters to ronne lyke swete floudes. And yet for all this they synned agaynst him / & angred the most highest in the wil¦dernes. They tempted god in their her∣tes / whā they asked meat to saue their ly¦ues. And they spoke against god sayēg may god spreade vs a table here in the de¦serte? He smytte the stonne & there flo∣wed out waters plētuously / but whether maye he lykwyse / said they / gyue vs also brede / and prepare flesshe for his people? Wherfore the lorde whan he herde these thinges was angry / and fyer was kynd∣led agaynst Iacob / & his wrath was bēte agaīst Israhell. And that bycause they beleued nat god / neither trusted they to his helpe. And yet he cōmaūded ye clou∣des oboue / & openyd the dores of heuen. And powred thē downe MAN to ete he gaue thē heuenly fode. So yt man ete stronge & substācyally meat that cam frō the cloud{is} / he let thē haue meat euē their belifull. He turned about the east wīde in the heuēs / & by his power brought in the south wynde. And rayned downe v∣pon them flesshe / as thicke as duste / and fethered foules lyke the sandes of the se.
And they fel down īto the midd{is} of their tentes / & round about their tabernacles. And they eate / & were well fylled / for he satisfied their appetites. They were nat disapoynted of their luste / and yet their meate was no soner in theire mouthes / than the wrath of god fell vpon them. And slewe the chefe of theym: euyn the most stoutest of Israell he threw downe. But yet aboue al this they sīned against him / for they beleued nat his meruelouse dedes. Wherfore their dayes were con∣sumed myserably and swyftly / and their ares passed ouer in perpetuall trouble. Whan he distroyed thē / than they sought him / they turned & besought god busely. Whan they called to mynde / the god is their defender: and that the high god is their redemer. But they flatered him wt their mouthes / & lyed vnto him wt their tonges. Their herte was nat right to∣warde him / nether kepte they touch with him in promyse. But yet he (natwithstā¦dynge) full mercyfully forgaue thē their wickednesse / he dyd nat distroye them / he peased his great wrath & caste nat forthe all his indignatyon. He consydred that they were but flesshe / a pufte of fleynge wynde whiche cometh nat agayne. Often tymes prouoked they hī to angre
in the deserte / & agreued him sore in the wyldernes. Agayne / they tempted god and casteth awaye him that maketh holy Israell. They forgot his strōge hande and the daye in the whiche he delyuered them from the troublouse oppressours. They forgote his myracles also / which he wrought in Aegypte / & his wonderful tokens which he shewed in ye felde of Ta¦nis. Whan he turned their pondes & dy∣ches into blode / & their ryuers also that they shulde nat drinke. He sent amonge them swarmes of flyes which deuoured them / and frogges to dystroye them. And he gaue the profyte of their grasse and corne to be eaten vp of wormes / and thei labours to hote flyes. He beate downe their vynes with hayle stones / & their fygge trees were froste byten. He distroyed their cattell with hayle sto¦nes / and smitte downe their beestes with lyghtenyng{is}. He sente into amonge thē the heuy indygnatyō of his hote wrath / the consumyng vengeance of his fearfull yre / anguyssh & vyolent wodnes by noy∣ouse spirites. He hedged in the waye of his wrath / he spared nat their lyues frō deth but betoke them to pestilence. He smytte euery fyrst begotten in Egipt and what so euer they had most leyfe and
deare in the tabernacles of Cham. And ledde forth his people lyke a flocke of shepe / and droue theym forthe lyke an herde of nere into the wyldernesse. He led them forth so surely that they ne∣ded nothinge to haue feared / for he ouer¦whelmed their enemyes with the waters of the see. And he brought them to his holye place / euyn to the hyll whiche he chalenged with his right hande. He casted out therof the gentyles before their faces / and lymited vnto them their heritage / and made the trybes of Isra∣hell to dwell in their tabernacles. Natwithstandynge / yet they tēpted and prouoked the high god and kept nat his testymonies. They turned their selues from him / and delte vnfaithfully against him euyn as dyd their fathers / they were writhen backe lyke a bowe. They angred god with their worshippe in highe places / and kyndled his wrathe with their Idols. God herde them and was sore amoued / & greuously he reiected and reproued Israhell. He forsoke his habitacyon in Shilo / euen the taberna∣cle in the which he dwelled amonge men. He suffred his gloriouse mighty seate to be taken / and his beautefull house to be brought īto the hand{is} of his aduersares▪
He betoke hys people all togyther in to the swerde / his yre brente so sore against his heritake. Fyre deuoured their yōg chyldren / & their vyrgyns loste the floure of their mayages. Their sacryfyces were smytten downe with swerde / and their wyues had no lay¦ser to mourne lyke wydowes. And the Lorde awaked / as thoughe he had slepte / and sterte vp with great noyse from slombre / as a man that had surfet∣ted with wyne. And smitte his enemis in the nether afterpartes / and made them to be into perpetuall opprobrye. Natwithstandynge all this / yet he refu∣sed & reiected the tabernacles of Ioseph / and the trybe of Ephraym he wolde nat chuse. But he chose the trybe of Iuda / euyn the hyll of Syon his owne welbe∣loued. And he buylded thervppon hys temple lyke highe palaces / and layed the foundation as fast as the erth to abyde a longe space. And he chose his seruaunt Dauid / and toke him frome the shipkote. He led him frō the folowing of his shepe to fede his people / euen Israell his owne heritage. And he shal gouerne and fede them purely with faythfull herte / & shall etche them forth driuynge them wysely. The argument into the .lxxix. Psal.

For my dayes verily ar vanyshed away lyke smoke / and my bones are dryed vp lyke a stowe. My hert is smytē thorow lyke grasse & is wethered away / in so mo¦che as I forsoke to take myn own meate I was so dryed vp wt my sorowfull and lowde syghes / yt my bones clyued to my skynne. I am like an estrege of the wyl∣dernes / & made lyke an houlet in an olde forlaten house. I lye wakyng & am left alone / lyke the sparowe in the thacke. Myn enemies reuyled me al day / & they yt chidde me vsed my name opprobriously. I eate therth in stede of brede / & lycke in my teares in stede of drinke. And all is for thy indignacion & thi wrath / for whā I was a loft ethou threwest me downe. My dayes are vanyshed away lyke a sha∣dowe / & I my self am wythered lyke hay. But thou lorde syttest styll for euer & thy memoriall endureth in euery age. Thou shalte ryse & haue pety on Syon /

Euen the haythen also shal worship the name of the Lord / & al the kynges of the erth shal knowlege thy glorious beaute. The lorde verily shal bylde Syon / he shalbe sene in his be∣auteful glory. And he shal haue respect vnto the prayer of the pore forsaken / his prayer shal he nat dispise. This thynge shalbe writen for the worlde to come / and for his cause the people which ar yet vn∣made shall prayse the Lorde. For he shal loke forth of his hyghe holy place / the Lorde euyn frō heuen shall be∣holde the erth. To here the syghes of them that are in bondes / and to lose the chyldren iuged to dethe. That they myght preache the name of the Lorde in Syon / and his prayse in Ierusalem. Whan the people & the kyngdomes shall be gathered togyther to worshyp ye lord. He abated my courage in my iourney / & hath cut of my dayes. I say  my god take me nat awaye in the myddes of my dayes / for thy yeres endu∣re thorow out all ages.

He hath nat deelt with vs after our synnes / neither rewar¦ded vs accordynge to our iniquytes. But loke howe hyghe heuēs ar ouer the erth / euyn so high hath he made his mer¦cy to preuayle ouer thē that worshyp him And loke howe farre the eest is from the weest / euen so farre hath he set our syn∣nes from vs. Loke howe the fathers herte yerneth vpon his chyldren / euen so doth the lorde pety them that feare him.

Remembre his actes whiche he hath done / his wonders and iugementes which are gone forth of his mouthe.
Oh / ye seede of Abraham which are his seruantes / oh ye chyldren of Iacob hys chosen. The lorde / he is our god / which optayneth the rule ouer all the erthe. He remembreth his promyse thorowe al ages / that his bargayne might stande in to thousande generacyons. Whiche he smyt with Abrahā / & swore vnto Isaac. Whiche he put to Iacob for a lawe / & to Israhell into a perpetuall couenaunte. Whan he sayde / vnto the I gyue the lāde of Canaan / the lot & porcyon of thyne in∣heritance. Euyn whan they were but a fewe sely men and straungers therin. Goynge frome nacyon to nacyon / frome their owne realme to a nother people. He suffred nat any man to do them wrō¦ge / & for their pleasures he chastysed euē the kynges. Se therfore that ye touche nat my anointed / neither hurt ye my pro¦phet{is}. He brought an hungre vpon the lande / and wasted all their yerely corne. He sente before them a man / euē Ioseph solde into bondage. They tormented his fete with fetters / & his body was caste into yerns. Untyll his dede came īto lyght / the wor¦de of goddes owne mouth restored him tryed with fyer lyke golde. The kynge sente and delyuered him / and
the gouerner of the people dyd lose him. He made hym ruler of hys house / and the dysposer of hys goodes. To correcte his nobles at his pleasure / and to teach his sage men wysdome. And Israhell after this is comen in to Egypt / & Iacob became a stranger in the lāde of Ham. And god encresed his pe¦ple excedyngly / and made them stronger than their aduersaryes. And afterward turned the hert{is} of these men / & made them to hate his people / & to worke disceyte with his seruantes. And than he sente thē Moyses his ser∣uaunt and Aharon his chosen. These men shewed his myracles amōge them / and wōders in the lande of Ham. He caste vpon them derknesse / and made derke Egypte / and they dyd nat againste his wordes. He turned their waters in to blode / and slewe their fysshes. Frogges crepte euerywhere in their lā∣de / euyn in the kynges bed chambres. He dyd but saye the worde / & there came swarmes of flyes & lyse in to all their co∣stes. In stede of rayne he gaue thē hayle stones / and lyghtenynge in their lande. He smyt their vynes & fygtrees / & broke downe their trees in their coostes.
He spoke the worde / & there came hotte flyes / and deuourynge wormes without nombre. Which deuoured & brēte vp all the grasse in their lande / they eate vp the fruit in their feldes. He smyt also euery first begoten that they had / euyn the first fruites of their wedlocke. But he ledde forth his chosen / endued with syluer and golde / and there was nat one in their try¦bes that was sycke. Egipte reioysed in their forth goinge / for they were a frayde to holde them any lenger. He stretched forth a cloude which couered theym / and sente thē fyer to lyghten them by night. They asked / and their came quayles and he fylled them with heuenly foode. He opened they in the stony rocke / & their flowed oute waters / the floudes ranne downe ye wyldernesse. For he remēbred his holy promyse / and also his seruant Abrahā. And he led forth his people in great ioye / & his chosen wt gret triumph. And he delyuered them the lādes of the gentyles / & they chalēged vnto them the labours of the flocke by right herytage. To thentente they wolde obserue his ce∣remonyes / and kepe his lawes also. LOUE IE THE LORDE. The argument into the .C.vi. Psal. ¶ The people of god scatered amonge dyuerse

Loue ye the lorde which hath his be∣gynnynge of him selfe / and all other creatures haue their begynnynge of him. COnfitemini. Magnifye ye the lor∣de / for he bereth vs good mynde / & his mercy is set forth for vs into euerla∣stīge Who may expresse ye noble actes of the lord / who may declare all his praises Blessed are they that obserue equytie / and studye to do right at all tymes. Remēbre me / oh lorde) accordyng to thy good wyll promysed to thy people / vyset me with thy sauynge helth / which thou hast promysed. That I might delyte in beholdynge the prosperyte of thy chosen that I mighte reioyse in the gladnesse of thy folke / and that I might glorye with thy people / whō thou haste claimed to be thy right herytage. We are siners lyke as oure fathers were / we haue commyt∣ted wickednes and haue done vngodlily. Our fathers in Egipte regarded nat thy myracles / neither remēbred they thy ma∣nyfolde goodnes: they rebelled at the see euyn at the red see. And yet he saued thē for his names sake / to magnifye his glo∣ryouse power. He rebuked roughly the red see & it was vpdried / and he led them
thorowe the depth lyke as thorowe a de∣serte. He preserued them from the han∣des of their aduersaryes / & redemed them from the power of their enemyes. And the waters ouerwhelmed their ad∣uersaryes / so that nat one of theym was lefte a lyue. Than beleued they his wor∣des / and songe forth prayse vnto him. But full sone after forgote they his wor¦kes / they wolde nat abyde his pleasure. They were set a fyer wt lust in the deserte and they tempted god in the wyldernes. And he gaue thē their askīge / but with it he cast their bodyes into a consūptyon. They enuyed Moyses and angred hī in their tentes / and Aharon also the lordes saynte. Therth opened her selfe & swa∣lowed in Dathan / & supte vp the congre¦gation of Abyram. Fyer consumed their feloshyp / the flame brente vp thun godly. They made a calfe in Horeb / & worshipt the cast idole And they turned his beau¦tiouse glory īto the symilytude of an oxe that eateth grasse. They had forgotten god their sauyoure / euen him whiche dydde so great thynges for them in Egypte. They forgot the myracles in the lāde of Ham / euyn the terryble actes / whiche he wrought in the redde see.
And he thought to haue banisshed them had nat Moyses his chosen put forth hī¦selfe a speker for them reconsyled these of broken / & peasyng his heuy indygnation vnlesse he shu haue distroyed them After this they dispysed that lande so worthy to be desyred / neither had they a¦ny faythe to his promyse. They murmured in their tabernacles / they gaue no hede to the lorde. And he lyfted vp his hande againste thē to throwe them downe in the wyldernes. Ye / to cast downe their posteryte amōge the gentyls / & to scater them into the re∣giōs. They were addicte & maryed vnto Baalpeor / & they eate the ded sacrifyces. They prouoked him to angre with their owne inuencyons / and vengeaunce crept in and sprede amonge theym Thā stepte forth Pinchas & auēged god¦des quarell & helde backe the vengeance. Which facte was a lowed him for a right¦wyse dede throwout all ages into euerla¦stynge. They prouoked god also at the waters of their grugynge against sayēg / & Moyses was punisshed for their sakes. For they troubled & vered his mynde / & he spoke a mysse with his mouthe. Neither wolde they distroye the gentyls as the lorde commaunded them.
They medled & maried with the gentyls and learned their workes. They wor∣shypt their carued images which turned them to cōfusyon. Also they slewe their owne sonnes & daughters / offringe them vp to sacrifyces to deuils. They shedde thinnocent blode / euyn the blode of their owne sonnes & doughters whō they slew and offred to the Idols of Canaan / & the erth was polluted with the blode. They were defyled thorowe their owne workes / & they were vnshamfased in their owne dedes. And the wrath of the lord was kyndled agaynst his people / and he turned his face from his herytage. And he betoke them into the handes of the gentyles / & they that hated thē were become their rulers. And their enemis oppressed them / & subdued them to their power. Many tymes he delyuered them and yet they rebelled his pleasur / & were worne out with their owne wyckednesse. And he behelde whan they were sore lai¦de agaynst / and herde their lamentacion. He remēbred hys promyse vnto them / & of his great goodnes he turned himselfe from indygnation. And he brought it to passe / that euen they which helde them in captiuyte had pytie vpon them. Saue vs lorde our god / & seperate vs frō

For he ledeth them forth of derkenes / & from the shadowe of deth / and breketh of their bandes. And than they magnifye the lorde for his goodnes / and publyshe his meruaylous actes amonge the men. Whan he had broke the dores of stele / & distroyed the barres of yerne. Foles for their synnes / and wikednesses are scurged. Their mynde abhorreth all maner of meate / they are brought euen to dethes dore. And they crye vnto the lorde in to their narowe strainte / & he de∣lyuereth them from their distresse. For he commaundeth with a worde / and healeth them / and delyuereth them from distruction nowe beyge at hande. And thā they magnifye the lorde for his goodnes / and publyshe hys maruelous actes amonge men. They offre vnto him the sacrifyce of prai¦se / and shewe forth his workes with gret

For at his com∣maundement cometh forthe the stormye wynde / & lyfteth vp the waues of the see. And they nowe ryse vp into the heuens / and anone they fall downe into the dep∣thes / so that their hertes are clene gone. They are throwē here and there / they ar tossed / they rele lyke dronken men / they ar at their wyttes ende. And they crye vnto the lorde in this narowe straint / and he thorow his helpe delyuereth them out of their distresse. For the stormy wynde auoideth / that the see myght be caume & her waues might be styll Than ar they glad that they are at rest / and he leadeth them forth vnto their pleasaunt hauen. And thā magnifye hey the lord for his goodnes / & publishe his meruelous actes amonge the men. And they extoll him in the congregation of the people / they prayse him in the presens of the elders. He that turneth the moyst and frutefull soyle into a drye deserte / & caryeth away waters from the thristy erth. And brīgeth frutefull soyle into barons for the offences of the dwellers therin.

And there than setteth he these hongry and famisshed men / they prepare them cy¦ties to be inhabited. They sowe the fel¦des / they plante the vynyardes / & they make frute and encrese of corne.

He maketh hygh princes to be of no re∣putacyon / and he maketh them to erre be wyde and strange places. But in the meane season he lyfteth vp ye pore man out of trouble / and maketh hī an housholde lyke a flocke of shepe.

I loue the lorde for he hath herde me / he hath herde the depe de∣syers of my herte. He bowed down his eares vnto me / wherfore whyles I lyue shall I call vpon him. The sorowfull snares of dethe helde me strayte / strayte anguysshes hampered me in / anguisshe and afflyction founde me.

It is better to put our confydence in the lorde / than in men be they neuer so great Whan all the gētyles beseged me on eue¦ry syde / well sayde I / in the name of the lorde / for I shall cut them away.
They cōpassed me in / ye / they beset me in round about / well sayd I / in the name of the lorde / for I shall cutte them away. They swarmed about me lyke bees / and inuaded me as fersly as fyer yt drie thorn{is} but they were sone quenched / for I sayde well / in the name of the lorde I shall cut thē awaye.

For thou possessest my inwarde affectes and dydest facyone me in my mother bely I shall magnifye the for thou hast facio∣ned me meruelously / to behold thy work{is}
ar to be merueled aboue mesure / as kno∣weth my soule. My strength in my bo∣nes & senowes were nat vnknowē vnto ye whā I shulde be made secretly in my mo∣thers wombe / & knytte togyther in the lowe preuy erth. Where whā I was yet without facyon thou seest me wt thy eyes all my lymmes facyoned by tymes thou haddest drawen lyke as in a paper / whan there was nat one of thē yet sette full per¦fytly. Howe clere ar thy thought{is} vnto me o god? oh / how excede they ī nombre? If I wolde nombre thē / they excede the sādes of the see / but yet I labour busely to cōsyder them / & I cleue euer vnto the. O god / I wolde it were thy pleasure to distroye hese vngodly / ye blody men a∣uoyde out of my syght Which speake wyckedly agaynst the / and rayle spytful∣ly vpon the / these are thy enemyes. Them that hate the oh lorde / I hate ve∣rily / & I abhorrew ith great indygnatiō thē that ryse agaynste the. I hate them extremly / and repute them as enemyes. Serch me oh god / & knowe thou my hert examyne me and trye thou my pathes. And loke if I haue begōne any shrew∣de waye / and leade me there out in to the waye euerlastynge. The argument in to the .C.xl. Psal.
¶ Here in this Psal. Dauid prayeth to be de∣lyuered from the deceytfull lyes of Doeg and of his felowes / and that they for their false deceit myght be cast away / that those men which study to do right and to be good / myght the more fre∣ly gyue them selues to the holy seruyce and pray¦se of god. The tytle of this psalme. The sōge of Dauid commytted to the chaunter. ERipe me. Delyuer me / o lorde / frome this myscheuouse man / saue me from this vyolente man. Which thynketh mischef in their hertes / and contynually ronne to battayle. They haue whetted theire tonges lyke serpentes / edders venome is vnder their lyppes. Selah. Kepe me / o lorde / from the handes of this vngodlye man / saue me from this cruell man / which thinketh to supplāt me. These proude men haue set a preuy snare for me / & haue bēte their nettes / euyn by my path haue they layed their gynnes for me. Selah. I sayde / lorde / thou arte my god / heare lorde / my depe desyers. O lorde yu arte my lorde my god / & my mightye sauynge helth / thou shalte defende my hed / what tyme I shall take me to armour & wepen. Lorde suffre nat the vngodli to take his pleasure on me / let nat his myscheuous entent prospcre with him lest these prou¦de heddes be axalted. Selah. I meane these heddes that thus besege
me on euery syde / whose heuy laboure of their owne lipp{is} might ouerwhelme thē. Let colles of fyer fall vpon theym / caste them downe into the fyer pyttes / oute of the whyche they maye neuer aryse. Let nothynge prospere in therth wt this busye tonged & lyenge man / let his owne mischef hunte forthe this vyolente man / vntyll it hath cast hym downe hedlynge. I knowe that the lorde wyll auenge the poore afflycte / and delyuer the nedyons. The rightwise verily shall magnify and sprede thy name / the pure in herte shall dwell in thy presens. The argument into the .C.xli. Psal. ¶ Dauid chased awaye from the tabernacle of god / prayeth first to optayne the spirite wherby he might preferre the frendlye sharpe rebuke of the sayntes the fauour of thungodly (their fely∣cyte dispysed) afterwarde he desyreth worthye vēgeance to his enemys & his owne delyuerance. DOmine clamai. Lorde it is thou that I call vppon / haste the to me / here me as sone as I call vpon the. Let my prayer ascende luckely in to thy syght lyke incense / let the lyftynge vp of my hādes be in ye stede of the euenīge sa∣crifyce. Lorde / set a keper to my mouth and kepe thou dilygently the dore of my lyppes. Bowe yu nat my herte into any mischeuous thīge / lest I be about to com¦mytte vngodly dedes wt men gyuen all to
wickednes / & so eate their daynties with them. Let the rightwyse smyte me for my soules profyte / for I hadde leuer he chastyned me than the softe oyntment of thungodly shulde souple my heed. For yet do I stande instantly withe my prayer agaynste their malyce. Let their chefe rulers be cast downe hed lynge in to stonnye places / that yet other men might beare my swete wordes. As one that plougheth / slytteth / and deuydeth the erthe / euyn so were we sha∣ken a sondre / and oure bones were scat∣tered aboute oure graues. Wherfore vnto ye o lorde / lorde / my eyes are lyfte vp / whan in the put I my truste powre thou nat out my soule. Kepe me frome their snares whiche they haue bente for me / and from the trappes of thē / which ar gyuen all to wickednes. Let these vngodly fall in to their owne snares / whyles I escape for euer with other men. The argument into the .C.xlij. Psal. ¶ Here Da, remēbreth his flyght frō Saule ī to a certayn caue where he abode (as he beleued) his owne takinge / & was in a greuouse straynte / but he prayed to the lorde. Rede the historie in the first of the kynges / the .xxiiii. Chap. The tytle. This psalme is the instruction of Dauid and his prayer whan he was in the caue.
UOce mea. Unto the lorde I crye / before the lorde I fell downe & ma∣de my prayer. Before him I powred forthe my heuy meditacyon / before hym I layde my strayte anguysshe. Whan my spiryte was sore tormented wt in my selfe / & thou knewest my way / they setted snares for me in the pathes where I went. I loked on my righthande / and I loked on my lyfte hande / & there was nat one that wolde make any knowlege to me / all refuge was taken fro me / there was nat one yt wolde seke to saue my lyfe I cryed vnto the / O lorde / and I sayde / thou arte my helpe / thou arte my porciō among the lyuyng men. Attende vnto my cryenge / for I am in a greuouse and wretched state / delyuer me frō my pursu¦ers / for they haue preuayled agaynst me. Leade my soule oute of prison / that it might spreade thy name / let me be com∣passed about with rightwysmen / for it is thou that shalte do me good. The argument into the .C.xliii. Psal. ¶ This psalme hath the same argumente with the psalme before / for it entreateth the same ma∣ter. The tytle. The songe of Dauyd. DOmine exaudi. O lorde heare my prayer / lysten vnto my feruente be∣sechynge for thy trouthes sake / graunte me for thy rightwysnesse.
Haue thou nat to do with thy seruaunt in iugemente / for in thy presence no man lyuenge is reputed rightwyse. A cruell enemye verilye persecuted my soule / he hathe caste downe my lyfe in to the erth / he hath sette me in derknesse / ly∣ke as men iuged to dethe. My spirite is sore troubled within me / & my herte wexeth colde in my brest. But at last I remembred the dayes past I consydred all thy workes / and pōdred in mynde the dedes of thy handes. I stretched forthe my handes vnto the / my soule desyrously panted and brethed for the / I gaped for the lyke thursty erth Selah. Haste the to graunt me o lorde for my spirite fainteth / hyde nat thy face from me / onlesse I be lyke men goynge downe into their graues. Make me shortly to heare of thy mercy a∣ble goodnes / for in the do I truste / shewe me the waye wherin I maye go / for vn∣to the haue I lyfted vp my soule. Delyuer me fro my enemyes o lorde my god / for at the do I hyde my selfe. Teache me to do thy pleasures / for yu art my god / thy good spirit might lede me in to the right way. For thy names sake lorde restore me / for thy rightwysnes lea¦de my soule out of this strayt anguyshe. Ye & for thy mercyes sake all to distroye
my enemyes / & shake away all that trou∣ble my soule / for I am thy seruant. The argument into the .C.xliiij. Psa. ¶ Here in this psalme Dauid the prophet prai¦seth the lorde god / for that he hathe delyuered him from all perylles / and from all his troube∣louse enemyes and hath made him kynge / & his kyngdome to florisshe with all maner felycitye. BEnedictus do. Praised be ye lorde which fyghteth for me / which hath instructe my handes to battayle / and ler∣ned my fyngers to fyghte. Whiche is my mercy / my bulwarke / my castell / and my delyuerer / my shelde / and he in whom I truste / whiche casteth the people vnder me. O lorde / what thyng is man / that thou thus moche settest by him? what is this mortall mā that thou thus regardest him? Man is lyke a thynge of nought / hys dayes ar but a vayne flyenge shadowe. But ye lorde lettith downe theuens & dis¦cendeth / he toucheth the hilles and they smoke. He casteth forth lyghtenynges and scattereth theym / he sendeth forthe his arowes and distroubleth them. Let downe thy hande frō aboue / & dely∣uer me / delyuer me from these myghtye waters & from the power of strange men. Whose mouthe speketh vayne thinges / & their riʒthāde is a riʒthāde doyng deceit.
O god / I shall synge a newe dytie vnto the / with kytte and tenne stringed instru∣mentes shall I synge vnto the. Which bryngest helpe vnto kynges / whi¦che haste delyuered Dauyd thy seruaunt from the myscheuouse swerde. Take me vppe and delyuer me frome the handes of strange men / whose mouthes speke vanytes / & whose ryghthande is a right hande that dothe disceyte. That our sōnes might growe lyke well thriuīg plantes / & our daughters gorgy∣ously set forthe lyke the cornerde houses might represēt the beauty of the temple. Let our garners be replenyshed with all maner of corne / & our shepe wt thousande folde encrese might fulfyll euery waye. Let oure oxen be stronge for draught & burden / no brekynge in / no rōnynge out no out criynge in our stretes. Happy is that people with whom it go∣eth thus / happy is that people which hol¦deth the lorde for their god. The argument into the .C.xlv. Ps. ¶ In this Psal. Dauid declareth the mercy of god to be so poured forth into euery mā / that all thynges do prayse and magnifye it / but chefely the faythfull men whiche are moste plentuously fylled with it. The tytle. The hymme of Dauid EXaltabo. I shall extoll the / god / o kynge / and shall publyshe thy name thorowout all the worlde.
Contynually shall I magnifye & prayse thy name / throwout all the worldes. Great is the lorde & worthy moche pray∣se / his greatnes can nat be serched. Frō age to age thy workes shalbe pray∣sed / and they shal declare thy noble actes. All my mynde shall be ernestly set at all tymes to declare thy cleare and glorious fame / and also to publishe thy meruelous dedes. Men shal speke forth the mighty power of thy myracles / and I shall put them in mynde of thy myght. Men shall shewe forthe the memoriall of thy plentuous mercy / and shall ioyfully tryumphe of thy ryghtwysnes. The lorde is fauorable & bente vnto mer¦cy / slowe vnto wrathe and of plentuouse goodnes. Gentle is the lorde vnto al mē and his mercyable gentelnes swimming ouer all his workes. All thy workes shall magnifye the / and thy mercy shal de¦clare thy selfe. Men shall preache the beautefull glorye of thy kyngdome / and shall extoll thy dedes with wordes. That they myght certifye and shewe mē his noble actes / his glorie & his clearnes Thy kyngdome is a kyngdome in to all worldes / and thy power is a power tho∣rowe out all ages. The lorde stayeth who so euer slydeth, and as many as are thrust downe he lyfteth vp agayne.
The eyes of all thynges loke vp & wayte vpon the / and thou gauest them meate in tyme. Thou openest thy hande / & satis∣fyest all thyng{is} lyuyng for thy goodwyll Ryghtwyse is the lorde in all his waye / he is good in all his dedes. Present is the lorde to as many as call vpon him / to as many as call vpon him of true belefe. To them that feare him he maketh all thinges acceptable / he hea¦reth their erienge / and saueth them. The lorde kepeth all that loue him / and all the vngodly he wyll banyshe. My mouth shall speke the prayse of the lorde / & euery thynge lyuynge shal sprede his holy name into all the worldes. The argument into the .C.xlvi. Psal. ¶This Psal. is a prayse of lyke argumēt with the Psal. before / saue that here the Prophet dis¦swadeth chefely the trust in to men / whan it is so that god is he which alone both may saue & wyll saue all that trust in him, The title of the Psal Prayse ye the lorde. LAuda aīa mea. Prayse the lord my soule. I shall prayse the lorde whi¦les I lyue / I shal synge vnto my god / as longe as I shall haue my beynge. Trust nat in princes which are but men / in whom there is no sauynge helth. Their breth goth forth of their bodyes / and by & by they are turned ī to their erth in the same day all their counsels perishe
Hapy is he that seketh helpe of ye god of Iacob / & whose hope is ye lorde / his god. Which hath made heuens and erth / the see / and what so euer ar contayned in thē which kepeth his promyse for euer. Which auengeth men vexed wrongfully whiche gyueth meate to the hungry / it is the lorde that loseth men in holde. The lorde gyueth lyghte to the blynde / the lorde lyfteth vp men oppressed / it is the lorde that loueth the rightwyse. The lorde kepeth stāgers / he lyfteth vp the yonge fatherles & the wydowes / and the purpos{is} of thūgodly he turneth vp so downe. The lorde shalbe kynge for euer whiche is thy god / o Sion / in to al ages. Prayse ye the lorde. The argument into the .C.xlvij. Psal. ¶In this Psalme the prophet exhorteth Isra∣hell by name to the prayse of god: and also the cytisens of Ierusalem, LAudare dn̄m. Prayse ye the lorde for it is a plesaunt and a ioyefull thinge to prayse our god / there is no thin¦ge so to be desyred as the prayse of hym. The lorde shall restore Ierusalē / & shall gather to gyther the scattered out lawes of Israell. He healeth the broken in herte / and caseth their heuy labours. He nombreth the sterres / & gyueth nam{is} to them all. Grace is our lorde & grace is
his power / his wyt may no mā cōprehēde The lorde lyfteth vp ye meke lowlyōs / & ye proude vngodlye he casteth downe to the groūde. Sīge ye to the lord wt thākes gi¦uynge / synge ye vnto our god wt harpe. Which ouerledeth the heuens with clou∣des / and prepayreth rayne for the erthe / and bringeth forth grasse in the hylles. Which gyueth cat all their foode / & meat also to the rauyns chekens calling for it. He delyteth nat in strength & stronge ste¦des / neyther hath he pleasure in ye trum∣pets of men. But his plesure is in them that feare him / & truste vpon his mercy. Praise yu the lorde o Ierusalē / prayse thi god o Siō. For it is he yt shal strēgthen the barres of thy gates / & shall lade thi cy¦tesens within the with plētuouse gyftes. He endueth thy costes aboute the with pease / and satisfyeth the with the mooste purest floure of the wheate. He sendeth forth his pleasures in to the erth / his cōmaūdemētes rōne forth swift¦ly. He gyueth downe snowe lyke wulle / & the hore froste he scatreth lyke asshes. He casteth forthe his hayle lyke gobbet{is} of bred / who maye abyde his colde? He sendeth forth his worde and melteth them awaye / he ledeth backe his wynde / and the waters droppe downe. It is he yt tolde his pleasurs to Iacob / &
vis ordynance and decrees vnto Israhel. With no natiō hath he thus delt / neither to any other dyd he publyshe his decrees. The argument into the .C.xlviii. Psal. ¶ In this Psal. the Prophet exhorteth all crea¦tures both heuenly & erthly to the praise of god. The tytle of the Psal. Praise ye the lorde. LAudate dn̄m. Prayse the lorde ye heuēly mīdes / prayse ye hī all yt are aboue. Praise him all aungels / prayse him all his hoste roundaboute hym. Praise him sonne and mone / praise hym all bright and shynynge sterres. Prayse him the mooste highest heuens / and ye waters that ar aboue the heuens. Praise ye the name of ye lorde / for he ma¦de all thīges wt a worde. And hath made them to stāde fast into all world{is} / he hath gyuen thē a lawe whiche they breke nat.
