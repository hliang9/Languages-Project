A DISCOVERIE, What God, the supreame judge,Wised. 6. 1 Iohn. 3. through his servant hath caused to bee manifested unto the regents or Rulers in England, concerning their Cain-like, fierce,Habac. 3. Apoc. 16.20. Ierem. 30. Psal. 89. 1 Cor. 12. nay Diabolicall contentions and furious di∣stractions, by which they bring them∣selves with all their land and subjects in utter distruction. Besides,Gal. 5.16. Esai. 51. Deut. 32. Psal. 9: 75 96.97.98 that they have left their distressed fel∣lovv-members and brethren in Germany stincking in their perdition and misery, vvhich all God vvill Iudge. Rom. 1:2. 2. Pet. 3. Printed in the jeare of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, 1643.
In the behalfe of God the Supreame Iudge, these are directed to the King of England, and the Parliament. THe eternal God,Ies 40.66. Psa. 89.95. to whom chiefly both heaven and earth doth be∣long, doth require the King of England and his Parlement,Ier. 30. that if they will escape his fierce anger and hot displea∣sure,Esai. 34. Rom. 1. Iesa. 25.29. they do not so cruelly and tyranni∣cally bring the subjects in their Countries with their own sweat and blood-monies,Amos 5. Mich. 3. Ephe 4. 2 Tim. 3. Iesai. 1. Iere. 7. Galat. 5. Ezech. 14. Apoc. 6.20 Matt. 7. Ioh. 10. 2 Thess. 2. Apoc. 16. 2 Cor. 11. which they by force draw & extort from them, in the ignorance of God, unto all ruine & perdition, as those insolent, wicked and inconsciona∣ble theeues and murtherers in Germany have done, who like dogs have torn and devoured, & like unto the wilde & bruit beasts have killed and destroyed one another, and then afterwards in the behalfe of the salvation of their soules, yet trust and relie upon those ravening wolves and hirelings, by whom Satan, the very Devill, himselfe is transformed into an Angell of light. Behold, God commeth as a thiefe in the night, with the day of vengeance, and his fiery Iudge∣ment upon those who doe not spare the very righteous amongst them.
A DISCOVERY Of the Cain of this present world in his ge∣neration, namely, how the Beast hath ascended againe out of the pit of darknesse. Revel. 17. Whose Members have forsaked God in their Conscience, after the Communion and obedience of faith, and being intangled in the vanities of this world, have separated themselves from one another, and for asmuch as every one of them will maintaine his vanity and Religion, onely after his pleasure, they have taken up Armes, to destroy and roote out one another in a horrible and blood∣thirsty way. THe people of the second,2 Tim. 4, Rom 14. Ephs. 2. or new Testament, should have bene taught, not to rule themselfs, and live onely after their owne wil, but should have suffered the grace of God our Lord and Saviour IESUS CHRIST,Luc. 1.17. to chastise, rule and reprouve them inwardly in their hearts or consciences:Tit. 2. Rom, 1. Mat. 24. but for as much as they have forsaken God in his throne of grace, and are become vaine in their devices, & have like unto those in the dayes of Noach,Genes. 6, 7.19. Epist. Iud. 2 Petr. 1:2. Apoc. 17. Matth. 24. 4 Esdr. 5.19 and 16. Apoc. 6:12. and 16. Iac. 5. Heb. 10. Apoc. 3:16 Gal. 4.5. Ephes 4.5. Thess. 5. Ierem. 8. and Loth, builded up and multiplyed themselves, onely according to their flesly old Adamicall will, therefore they have set God behinde them secretely in the ground of their soule, have forgot him, are with the powers of the body & soule gone forth into the nature: and have for to maintaine their liberty and Religion, begunne warres one against another, by which they destroye and ruyne one another, and bring the poore to utter destruction. But when God cometh with his grace, & according to the spirit of filiation knoc∣keth on, to the end, that his children should open their hearts, and enter into their consciences, and marcke this present and last time, and observe the rights of the Lord;
then cometh the ungodly Cain in his generation, or chil∣dren of Belial, and will censure God in his judgement,1 Ioh. 3.5. maketh it worse then his brother in former times,2 Pet. 3. Gen. 4. Gen. 3. (who yet fell into the fear of desperation) and Adam, who fain would have been hid from the face of God. In summa,2 Pet. 2. 1 Cor. 3. the Devill hath wholly possessed the people in their Se∣ctarian Religion, with will & insolent deeds; to passe by,2 Tim. 4.3. 2 Pet. 2. Psal. 14. Epist. Iuda Apo. 16: 19 Esai. 9. and 13.27.61.63.65. that their false teachers and prophets besides, doe wholy deny and blaspheme the judgement of God, concerning the redemption of the poore and distressed, and are the very first of all that stirre up men to all wickednes, wher∣fore also God shall bruise the head of the old serpent, and execute vengeance upon his corporall and spirituall enne∣mies. 2. Thess. 1. Mich. 5. The shephards and teachers which every one hath loa∣det himselfe withall, in his sect,Ierem. 23. Zach. 10. 2 Tim. 4. Matt. 24. 2 Perr. 2. Matt. 7. Apoc. 20. 2 Tim. 3. Zach. 14. Gen. 18.19. Ier. 5 and 8. and 9. Psal. 36.119. Ies. 28.42.59. Sapient. 5. Amos. 5. Psa. 4: 89. Luc. 18. Zach. 14. Ps. 12.125 Es. 40 50. Apoc. 16. Mich. 7. 2 Pet. 3. Dt. 2.7. Irem 8. Rom. 8. 1 Pet. 4. Icob. 4.5. Amos 5. Ezech. 22. Mich. 3. Es. 40.45. Psal. 33. Esai. 8.30. Hos. 10. Epist. Iudae have seduced the whole world into errours and darknesse of conscience, and brought them away from the narrow way of life, unto the brood way of eternall damnation in hell, & doe chiefly resist the truth. If there were but five Godly and Righ∣teous men in a Land or Kingdome, like as God sought such at Sodome and Gomorrha; I leave not of to de∣nounce the right of the Lord, and to witnesse of his eter∣nall righteousnes, which for to maintaine the honour of his word or holy name shall be manifested as a strong streame. But what Faith, hope and conscience in this regard God findeth & hath found in all places Countries and Kingdomes, upon his eternall infinite Omnipoten∣cy, that shall be plainly discovered and judged, by reason of the confusion and ruine, which the children of man have brought to passe, which, like unto the mockers and despisers of God in former times know nothing of his
Kingdome, right, judgement and righteousnes, but will onely maintain their vaine, old, former confused doings and worldly deeds, with the revenue of the Countries, sweat and blood-mony of the poore Subjects, from whom they have extorted them. Wherefore there shall also be a judgement, for the God of Israel liveth yet, and his counsell and thoughts stand for ever, against the doings, counsels, or vaine and idle thoughts of all men: which vaine counsels and thoughts are come forth from themselves, to maintaine their divided Sects. Our God is Vnto the unbelevers,Heb. 10.12 Deut. 32. Rom. 9. Ies. 8.28. a consuming fire, a stone of stumbling, and a rocke of offence. 1. Petr. 2.
CONCERNING The Cainlike, fierce, bitter,1 Ioh. 3. Haba 4. Hebr. 10.11, 12. Psa. 94. Mare. 13. Rev. 13.16 Iob. 17. Es. 42.45. Ps. 10.68. Mich. 3. Malach. 3. Amos 5. Iames 5. Esai 5.59. Ierem. 7.22 nay Diabolicall revenge-fulnesse of the Heathen, or false Christians, who go about to thrust God out of the throne of his judgement, and will deprive him of all power and ho¦nour in heaven and on earth, in bringing both Coun∣try and people, viz. the poore Subjects, with their own sweat and blood, into extream calamity and utter de∣struction, and besides defiling the Land with innocent blood. Ezech. 22. GOd hath now for a long time in all places and Countries beheld the people and nations of this fourth or last Monarchy of the world,Dan. 2. and 7. Chap. Rom. 11 Matt. 21. Psa. 33.53.89. Luc. 21. Ier. 23.30. Eze. 21.22 Amos 5.  Esai. 9.45.50. Iam. 5. Dan. 27. Psal 36.89 97.98.119 4 Esd. 6.7.16. Rev. 16.19. 20, 22. namely the heathens or false Christians, and that both from heaven above, from his high and firme throne, and also through his servant David, whom he hath raised of and from among their owne selves, by reason of this pre∣sent misery, distresse and great calamity: who through their designes in every place, have effected nothing els but kindled the fire upon themselves, and hindered the redemption (or deliverance) of Israel with the utter de∣struction of the poore: all which must yet be judged: for God with his Kingdome, judgement, and eternall divine Righteousnes, will not give place, so much as a haire, to the Divell in all his members in the whole world, nor yeeld to them the least from his owne right. But woe
unto them,Esai. 8. or those in the fiery pit of everlasting hellish damnation, who in this cause oppose themselves against God,Mat. 24. Marc. 13. Rev. 12.16 Es. 34.66. 2 Cor. 5. and will prevent, nay wholy annihilate the counsell of the Lord: for as every one doth and behaveth himselfe against God, in regard of these present warres and com∣motions, and thereby is the cause, and guilty of the de∣struction of mankinde; so accordingly he shall be rewar∣ded both here in time, and there in eternity: which no shephard, false teacher 2. Petr. 2. or prophet can hinder, or shall be able to remedy in any way.Actor. 20. Mat. 7.23. Ioh. 10. 2 Tim. 3. Es. 28.57. Ezech. 13. Epist. Iudae For those hor∣rible ravening wolves and hirelings, who have seduced the people to such insolent prevarication against God, and moreover doe absolve them in their presumptuous persevering sinnes and damnable courses, & strengthen the hands of the impenitent and wicked ones, thus tur∣ning the grace of our God into lasciviousnes and inso∣lence:2 Petr. 2. Zeph. 3. Those, I say, shall principally above all be sent to hell, and the everlasting darknesse, by reason of the de∣struction,Marc. 11.13. Lucc 19. Iere. 7. Iere. 23. Ezech. 13. Matt. 21.24. which now for a time hath bene caused and brought to passe in all places and Countries in the murthering denne of this false Christendome, through the hypocrisie and lyes of such uncleane spirits, frogs and spirits of the Devill. The whore of Babylon must indeed be destroyed be∣fore the end of the world,Rev. 16. but it must not be done other∣wise, then by,Rev. 17.18 Ps. 89: 97.119. Gala. 5. Rom. 8. Ioh. 8.10. Ier. 7.8. Mat. 12.21 Marc 3.12 and according to the afore determined counsell of the Lord, namely, according to his justice, judgement and everlasting divine righteousnesse, which especially the people of the second, or new Testament, ought in the spirit, and through Faith to have waited and hoped for, and in no wise so as the Iewes did when their King came, whose life they sought above all others, in
regard of their outward Temple worship and false Reli∣gion.Lucc 6.11.19. 2. Petr. 3. Epist. Iudae Matt. 13. Deut. 32. Psal. 94. Rom. 1.2. Pet. 2. Esai. 1. Ier. 7.11.15.17. Therefore a fiery judgement is before the doore, by reason of the mockers and despisers, who in this re∣gard will not onely hinder the harvest of the Lord, but endeavour also wholy to annihilate and abolish it, by en∣trenching upon the vengeance belonging to God, and going about to maintaine, protect and defend their vaine worldly Sectarian courses and Religions. Whereby they doe but kindle the fire in the wrath of God, upon them∣selves, Esdr. 15.16. Those heathens or false Christians,Marc. 13. Gal. 4.5. Rom. 9. Iames 4. Matt. 24. Luc. 17. Rom. 1. Esai. 1.5.30. Ezech. 7.21 Levit. 26. Revel. 9.13 16.19.20. Luc. 19. Genes. 19. Epist. Iudae Ezech. 16. 2 Pet. 2. Gal. 5. Psalm. 12. Ierem. 23. Zach. 10.14. Hos. 4.10. 1 Ioh. 3. Psal. 2.99. Ezch. 22. Ierem. 2: 22. Mich. 3.6. Ier. 46.50. Esa. 30 31. Amos 5. who as concerning the spirit of grace and adoption (or childship) of IESUS CHRIST, within their hearts or consciences, are not other wise subject and obedient to God, then those in the times of Noah and Loth were, and will protect themselves in their vaine and wicked courses, without the counsell of the Lord, and against God & his spirit endeavour to set themselves at liberty, those I say must be ruined through their owne enemies, and subjected to the Divell and all wild beasts, which God shall raise and stirre up against them, and they shall have at last as little deliverance from the everlasting hellish damnation, as in former times the Iewes in the horrible destruction of Ierusalem; and those at Sodome and Gomorrha, whom God also ever for their owne Resractarinesse was forced to destroye with fire and brimstone from heaven. For God will not have the Sectarian contentions and bytings, the hypocri∣ticall and Schismatical doings of the shephards, by which there is no light, no faith, no love, no uprightnesse nor righteousnes any more left, within the hearts of these men, maintained and defended in this fierce and Cain∣like manner, with rage and fury, murderings and blood∣sheddings,
of the poore innocent souls, which now also for a time hath bene plainly seen and knowne, by lively experience, namely, how God hath throwne downe one tyrant through the other, and brought a desolation upon the Champious and strong-ones.Deut. 32. Esai. 12. Rom. 12. Psa. 10.94. Habac. 3. Iames 5. Amos 3.5.8. Psalm 33.76.93. Those that go about to deprive God of his honour and vengeance, and entrench upon his judgement against their enemies, doe first and foremost, burden themselves with great unquietnesse, trouble and labour in vaine to no pur∣pose. Secondly they bring their contry, people and sub∣jects with their revenus, sweate and blood into utter ruine: and then thirdly and consequently (which is the worst, greatest and heavest of all) they presume to alter or per∣vert the eternall counsel of God:Esai 30.33 1 Thess. 5. 1 Corint. 3.6.11. Hagg. 2. and thus will utterly abolish the gouvernement of God in heaven and on earth, especialy within their owne conscience, and also outward∣ly amongst themselves:Wisd. 6.12. all which the same God, who in former times hath throwne downe the Thrones and Seats of Kingdomes, will not suffer.Esai. 49. A Servant of the Lord Servinge God in his justice and judgement. Psalm. 17.18.
