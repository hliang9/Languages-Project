And soo was the commyn testymonye of alle tho that knewe her husbonde. Ja∣cob that was he a man ful symple by In¦nocencye and ryghtfull: alwaye fleyng from euyll: Also this good mannys softenes in speche was soo vertuous / that alle his meyny namely wymmen dame sels taught in his soole myght not speke ne here noo worde that were not semely or dyshoneste: In so moche that one of his doughter whiche was callyd Bonauen∣tura was wedded to a yonge man whi∣che was callyd Nycolas of the same Cy∣te wyth whome were conuersaunt ma∣ny other yong men of hys age by cause he hadde nother fader ne moder / And thyse men and he wythout ony refreynyn¦ge of tongue spake eche to other▪ and he wyth other: And they wyth hym foule wordes of dyshoneste mater.

I was norysshed in myn faders hours. and there was I neuer wonte to here suche wor∣des as I here now euery daye / And so was I neuer taught of my fader and moder / wherfor knowe it for sothe but this dishoneste of speche bee avoyded fro this hous wythin a shorte tyme / ye shall see me deed: whan her husbond herde this bothe he avoyded that vngoodly langa∣ge▪ and the felawshyppe and therwyth he was edefyed moche more than euer he was before▪ as well of the vertues lyuin¦ge of the fader and moder as of her dou∣ghter / that was his wyf / And anone he forbode his felawes neuer more to speke suche maner wordes in her presens and nomore they dede: and soo the softenes & the honeste of Jacob his hous amendyd in moderaunce / And the dyshoneste of Nycolas hous whiche hadde weddyd Ja¦cob his doughter ¶ Ferthermore ye shall vnderstonde ye Jacob vsed the crafte of makyng of co∣lours wherwyth wollen and wolle clo∣thes ben dyed: This crafte vsed bothe he and his sonys / In that contree they ben called dyers. wherfore full wonderfully god ordeyned that a dyers doughter shol be made the spouse of the Emperour of he¦uen: As ye shall see by goddes grace af∣ter in this boke: Somme of this that I haue shewed in this chapytre / was kno¦we to the more parte of the cyte / And som̄e her confessour had of the sayd may¦de katheryn and of her moder and of ma¦ny relygyous persons and of seculers / whiche were neybours and of kynrede to the same Jacob and to his wyf. ¶ Of her byrthe and of the merueylous werkinge whiche our lord wrought and shewed in the chylhode of this holy vyr∣gyn and mayde / Capitulū ij Whan this forsayd Lapa whiche was lyke a fructuous vyne by fulfyllyng the wyne of Jacob her husbonde in bryngyng forth full ofte bothe sones and doughters / It befyll a∣boute the laste tyme of the berynge of chyldren by the ordynaunce and dy spo∣sycyon of our lordis mercy that she con∣ceyued & brought forth; two doughters / freell and febyll by nature. But moche more freell by of bodely strengthe as se∣med outward▪ but strengthe and stabyl∣nesse they hadde in the syght of god. ¶ Whan Lapa the moder besely behelde theym she thought well that she suffysed nought to nourysshe them bothe forthe
wyth her owne mylke / wherfore by a good auysement she commytted that one to smother noryse / And that other she wythhelde and kepte stylle to be norys∣shed forth wyth her owne mylke: And soo it befyll by the ordynaunce of our lor¦de / that she chosed that doughter to her owne kepyng▪ whiche our lord of euer∣lastynge tyme hadde chose vnto his spou¦se Bothe they resceyued the grace of bap¦tysme And all be it that they were of the nombre of goddes chose chyldren / Yet the forsayd mayde was called katheryn and that other was called Johan This later suster whan she hadde receiued this grace of baptysme in the same grace. she went forth to heuen / For in short ty∣me after she passed out of this worlde. Katheryne abode stylle sukkyng on her moders brestes by goddes ordynaunce she shold drawe to heuen a longe cheyn of soulis / And for as moche as Lapa ye moder consyderyd that katheryn abode & that other was deed: She nourysshed her more dyligently hopyng that she was chose to abyde and be goddes chyld And ofte sythes this moder lapa wolde saye to maister Reymond her confessour to this holy mayde that she louyd kathe∣ryn passyngly aboue alle the sones and doughters that euer she hadde / She sayde vnto hym also that she concey¦ued soo ofte that she myght neuer nourys¦she ony chylde of her wyth her owne myl¦ke: ¶ Katheryn she nourysshed forth in to ye ende of the tyme yt she neded to be vnder the nourysshe / And in alle that tyme she conceyued not / as it semed that oure lorde for that doughter hadde graunted her a tyme of reste of trauey∣lyng of the byrthe of chyldren: and in a token that she myght come to the ende of conceyuyng and byrthe: in that doughter whiche sholde after ateyne and gete the ende of alle perfection / ¶ But yet this moder Lapa after the nouryssyng of katheryn▪ ones she con∣ceyued and bare a doughter whiche was called Johan: And there she made an ende of beryng of chyldren after that she hadde boen xxv chyldren / Whan this mayde was thus broughte forth and halowed to god: And whan she hadde lefte the mylke: and toke to e∣te brede whyle she wente aboute alone: She began to be soo acceptable and soo byloued to all tho that sawe her and soo wyse: and wonderfull wordes she spake: that vnnethes her moder myght holde her in her owne hous / Eche man aboute of her neybours and of her kynrede lad her home wyth theym / and glad they were who myght haue her to here her wyse spe∣che / And that they myght haue felaw∣shyp and the gladenesse of that yonge mayde. Soo that of a maner gladdenes∣se and of a passyng solace they called her not by her owne ryght name katheryn: but Eufrosyna: and what meued them to calle her soo: they wyst not theym self / but she afterward somme tyme wolde sa¦ye and suppose that it was a mystery by cause she purposed to folowe saynt Eufrosyne in lyuyng / Her confessour that wrote this legende supposed that the yonge mayde in her chyldis speche vsed somme maner of sow¦nynge that nyghed or acorded to that n¦me Eufrosyne. And soo in maner as they wolde reherce her wordes they called her soo by that name: Neuertheles what euer it was that appieryd she burgenyd out in her chilhode as a tree by ony suche shewyng what fruyt was brought forth Afterward in her olde age the wysdome and the prudence of her speche & connyng
and the swetenesse of her holy conuersa∣cion myght not be rehersed wyth tongue lygthly wryte wyth penne by theym that knewe only the veryte of thys / whiche hadde very experyence: She hadde also an Inward werkynge whyche shewed well▪ not only by her speche but by her cō¦uersacion wher thorugh many mennys sowlis were drawe to god: And hadde thorugh her grace grete lykyng and sa∣uour in god in somoche that all heuynes∣ses were excluded of all mennys hertes whiche were conuersaunt wyth her▪ and not only that but all thinges that noyed the sowle was put awaye. Also the re∣membraunce of eche noye or angwysshe was take awaye / And of this folowed eche man soo grete reste and stabylnesse / of sowle whiche they hadde byfore that euery man woundred of theym self / and made Joye wyth a newe maner of glad∣denesse / and eche man in his owne sow∣le cryed and sayde: Here it is good for vs to be▪ Make we thre tabernacles for our dwellyng place / And of this none woūder for douiles▪ he was there hydde inuysybly in the breste of his spouse whiche was transfygured in the hylle / As saynt Peter sayde and other appostles: ¶ Now ferthermore to our purpos this chosen mayde in her full tender age soone began to waxe and was cōforted wyth the holy ghost in token that she sholde be soone fulfylled wyth the dyuyne wysdo∣me / Aboute her age of fyue yere whan she was taught to saye the salutacion of the aungell / Aue maria: She recordyd it besely and sayde it full ofte / And whan she coude saye it as she was enspired frō heuen: She began to grete oure lady go∣yng vpward on a stayere and comynge doūward on the same stayere at eche gre¦es of the stayere to worshyppe our lady wyth an Aue maria / This she tolde her confessour afterward in the secretesse of confession. By this ye maye se that she that fyrst in the begynnynge shewed forth fyrst plesyng and acceptable wor∣des to men after that yonge age she be∣gan to stye vp from thynges that were inuysyble. ¶ After this holy begynnyng the encre¦sed euery daye▪ And than as it pleasyd our lord the was vyseed wyth a gracy∣ous and a wounderfull vysyon to stere her and to shewe here hyr gyftes of gra∣ce of the holy ghoost: And to shewe other how a lytyll plante shold be brought for∣the and soo nourysshed in to an him tree of Cidre by the moyster of the holy gost ¶ Aboute her age of vj yere. It befyll that this chosen mayde wyth her brother Steuen somme what elder than she wen¦te to her suster Bonauentura / Of whiche suster is made mencion byfore / perauen∣tur on someuer ende or to loke how she ferde as the maner of frendes of kynre∣de is soo to doo / whan she hadde doo that they were bode to doo in her goyng homward agayn by the waye whiche is called in her tongue wallis piacta / This holy may lyfte vp her eyen: and agaynste her ouer the chir∣che of the freer prechours she sawe in the ayer a full fayre chambre ryally aparay¦ed wyth all ryches and honeste / where oure lorde Ihesu Cryste in a trone Impe¦ryall clothed wyth pontyfycall vesture hauyng on his hede a myter papall / And wyth hym were saynt Peter and saynt Poule / and saynt Johan Euan gelyst. And whan she behelde alle thys she was fyrst a stonyd / But by a vysement stably she stode styll and wyth a louyngyng herte deuoutly

And ofte the wente in the waye besyde men and bestes / By nature dredfull sholde be as a chylde: but euer the eyen and the hede were vpward abydyng vp¦pon that blysfull vysyon and none dou∣ghte soo she wolde haue abyde but she hadde be touched or take awaye by som∣me other body as longe as that vysyon had endured: ¶ But at the lase whyles thys was shewed to the mayde▪ Steuen her broder helde forthe his waye and was passed her a greate space wenyng that she had folowed hym: But whan he tourned hym and sawe her not folowe / he tour∣ned agayn and sawe his suster fere be hynde stondyng styll in the waye and lo¦ke vp in the fyrmament / ¶ And thenne he cryed after her wyth alowde voys and called her she answer∣de not and take none hede. Thenne he wente nere cryeng afterher: but his voys helped not: ¶ He woundred and wente thenne & drewe her by the honde and sayde: what doost thou here why comest thou not for∣thr she anon cast doune a lytyll her eyen as she hadde awaked of an heuy slepe and sayde / A yf thou sawe that I sa∣we / thou woldest not haue lette me from this holy vysyon: And anone as she had said▪o wordes She lyft vp her eyen agayne to be holde more vp that she hadde seen / But the vysyon was alle wythdrawe and cesyd / as his wyll was whiche ape∣ryd to fore: And that myght she not be∣re wythout a sharpe stroke of sorowe / And anone she vengyd her on her self wyth sore wepynge for sorowe that she caste doune her eyen: And from that tyme and houre / This yonge mayde and vyrgyn saint Katheryn began to waxe olde in vertues and sadnesse of maners and to haue a wounderfull wit¦te and a felyng body bote by grace and by nature / In soo moche that her dedes were other chyldysshe ne as a yonge woman. But they semed rather to alle men that they came of the wysedom of a greate worshypfull age: Soo that anone was shewed that the fy¦re of dyuyne loue was kyndeled in her herte / by the whiche vertu her intellection was made clere. Her wyll was feruent her memorye was comforted and alle her outward werkyng shewed in alle thyn∣ges the rewle of goddes lawe: ¶ And as she sayd in confessyon to hyr¦confessour full mekely and lowely that she lerned and knewe at that tyme wyth out techyng of ony body or ony redynge or heryng / onely by the nfusyon of the holy ghoose / the leuyng and the maners of the foly faders of Egypte / and the ly¦uyng

For after that tyme she sought oute where that she myght haue a pryue place to abyde in preuely whan∣ne she wolde vse bodely afflyccyons / and whanne she wolde occupye hyr in prayer and holy medytacyons▪ ¶ In that place at certeyne tymes she scourged hyr lytell tender body wyth a ly∣tell scourge.

Swyfly she wente in the ayre and touched noo grees wyth her fete / and thys fylle namely whanne she wolde flee a waye oute of companye / and specyally from the syghte of compa∣nye of men. And for as moche as she had a gretely kynge in the begynnyng to say hyr Aue maria. And to grete our lady ther wyth in goynge vp and doune on hyr faders grees. Therfore it is to suppose that thys myracle was shewed there rather thanne in another place. ¶ Forthermore for as moche as she had knowynge of the lyfe of holy faders of Egypte by reuelacyon / therfore wyth al¦le her strengthes she was steryd gretely to folow hem. ¶ In so moche that in ye yong tender a∣ge full feruentely she desyred to be in the wyldernesse as the holy faders were in olde tyme / but she myghte not be thyn∣ke hyr by what maner waye she myght perfourme hyr desyre / & by cause it was not ordeyned of god that she sholde dwell in soo solytary place. Oure lorde suffred hyr to stonde to the wytte of hir proper na¦ture as in that.
And she myght nomore knowe what she sholde doo as touchyng that purpose / than hyr owne chyldes wytte wolde she∣we hyr. And ryght so it befyll that she wyth hyr feruent wyll to her purpose she ouercame the tendrenesse and the frealte of hyr age / but yet hadde she not the par∣fyte vyctorye. For erly on a morowty de she thought to go to the deserte or ellys wyldernesse and abyde in a solytary pla¦ce / wherefor by chyldys prouydence she purueyed her of a lofe of brede and of no more. Forthe she wente toward hyr susters hows that was wedded / whyche hows was faste by the gate is clepyd the gate of saynt Ansanye. She passyd hyr sustrer hows / and forthe she wente out at that gate / and so dyd she neuer afore / and soo passyd forthe tyll she came to a waye out of the Cyte where she saw noo hows stonde nyghe there as she dyde in the cyte. And thenne she thought wel she was nyghe the deserte / yet wente she somwhat forther / and at the laste she founde a lytel caue vnder a banke / whyche plesyd hyr well▪ And forth she wente in with a glad herte wenyng to hyr that she hadde fonde the wyldernesse whyche that she hadde de¦syred. And all be it that she it had not yet our lorde almyghty god whome she behelde long to fore and receyned hys ho¦ly blyssyng / whyche gladly acceptyth all holy desyres / alle be it that our lord hadde not dysposed hys spouse to haue that ma¦nere of lyuyng / yet wolde not he suffre that dede that she dyde of good desyre to passe awaye wyth out a token / to shewe¦her that she dyd was acceptable and ple¦syng to hym. And anone as she be¦gan to praye there feruently / she was I lyfte vp lytell and lytell from the erthe / and the body wente vp as hyghe as the height of the caue wolde suffre / and so she stode in prayer fro the morow in to none. Thys mayde perceyued welle that she was areryd from the erthe / and as for that tyme she wende it had ben the wor∣hyng of hyr enemye / whyche wold wyth hys fraudes and dysceytes lette hyr pra∣yer and desyre that she had to the deserte / And for that cause she besyed hir and en¦forced hyr the more stablye and feruently to praye. At the laste aboute the houre of the day whan our lord after his passy on of the crosse was take doun fro the crosse / she descendyd lytell and lytell as she ascendyd. And by Inspyracion of our lord she hadde vnderstondyng and knowyng that the tyme was not yet I come where in she sholde not putte hyr bo∣dy in suche afflyccyon for our lorde. Ne that she sholde leue her faders hows in su¦che maner / wherefor she torned as she ca∣me. But whan she wente out and sawe she was allone and behelde the gate of the Cytee longe and full fere to her age and feblynesse dredynge also that hyr fader and moder shold wene that she had be los¦te. She coude no more but beganne to praye and commytted hyr fully to god. And anone in a shorte whyle by the ordynaunce and myght of our lorde she was borne vp in the eyre and sette in the gate of the Cytee wyth out ony harme / And anone she wente home in alle the hast that she myght or coude. Thys she tolde to a Cosyne of heres / whyche was callyd Laxa. But to hyr fader and mo∣der alle thys was hydde and vnknowen tyll she came to elder age / for they wende she hadde come fro hyr susters hows that was wedded. Of thys that is shewed in thys chapytre in somme partye. La∣pa hir moder tolde to mayster Reymond Whyche was hyr last confessoure / and in somme partye her self / and of somme
Laxa hyr cosyne not wythstondyng that he hadde grete swetenesse of alle that is I wrytton and sayd a fore / Saue at the la¦ste bothe of hyr fyrst confessour / whyche was I nourysshed in hyr faders hows / and of many worshypfull and trewe ma¦tros of neyghbours nyghe / and of other besyde nygh to hyr fader and moder / and to hyr / ¶ Of hyr vowe made of virgynyte and of other vertuous liuynge and meruayl¦les whyche be fyll tyll she came to the age of abylytee / to be wedded to man / but wedded was she not ne neuer wolde / Capitulū iij SO moche vertue and grace was in that vysyon / whyche is reher∣syd in the nexte hapytle to fore that all worldly loue and affeccyon was wyth drawen out from the herte of thys holy yonge mayde / and onely the holy loue of goddys sone and of the gloryous mayde and moder of our lord Ihesu cry¦ste / stylly and stedfastly was prented in hyr herte▪ Wherfore she sette alle thyn∣ge at noughte / soo that she myght ouely wynne our lord hyr sauyour. And anone she had clere vnderstondyng only by the techyng of the holy ghoost / that is full semyng and accordyng to our lorde and our maker of nought to be serued wyth alle purytee and lenues bothe in body and in sowle. Wherfore she desyred fully to haue and kepe the clennesse of virgynytee / and for that she thought well and knowynge hyr by the techynge of god that our blessyd lady goddys mo∣der was the fyrste that founde the lyf of virgynytee / wherefor thys mayde concey∣ued in hyr herte that vp that mater she wolde haue recourse to our lady for helpe and counseyll. And whan that she ca∣me to seuen yere age / she took grete auy∣semente as though she hadde be of sadnes¦se of xx yere of age and contynuelly she prayed our lady quene of aungels and virgynes that she wolde wouchesauf to helpe hyr and gete hyr of our lord a par∣fyte waye to the techynge of the holy ghoost / where by she myght doo that were moost plesynge to god / and moste spede∣fulle for helthe of hyr sowle. And in eche prayer euer she shewed hyr desyre to our lady how sore she desyred to lyue an aungelslyf / and in the lyf of virgy∣nytee. And in alle thys tyme the loue of the euerlastyng spouse was more fer∣uent fro day to day in thys maydens herte / whyche loue steryd alle hyr sowle wyth oute ony cessyng vnto an heuenly liuynge. And whan thys wyse may∣de sawe how feruent her spyryte was in that desyre / by cause she wolde not quen∣che the spiryte / whiche that freely and gra¦cyously hadde graunted that she asked by a hote kyndelyng of desyre. Vpon a day thanne she chose hyr a preuy place / where noo body myght here hyr / and whe∣re she myght speke alle a lowde wyth a hygh voys what euer she wolde saye the¦re wyth all lownesse of body and sowle. Thus spak she to our lady and sayde O moost blyssedfull Lady and moost holy vitgyne / whyche fyrste amonge alle wymmen thou halowedest for euer thy virgynytee to our lord wyth makyng to hym a vowe / of whome thou were made moder of hys onely sone. Thy pyte why¦che may not be spoke ne tolde of tongue lowely I beseche and praye that be none of my merytes & notwythstondyng myn vnworthynesse wouches auf gracyous la¦dy to do me so moche grace / that thou me spouse to hym onely whome I desyred wyth all the strengthes of my sowle / and that is thyn holy sone my lord Ihesu cry¦ste and here I make to hym & to the fulle
promysse that I shall neuer take other spouse / and I shall kepe to hym my vir∣gynyte vndefowled after my myghte & poure / Loo maydens that rede thys / Loo vere ye may se how ordynatly alle the yef¦tes and vertuous werkyng and dedys of thys holy mayde were dysposed and ordeyned by that euerlastyng wysdome / whyche myghtely dysposeth alle thynges in softnes. In the age of syy yere she sawe hir spouse wyth hyr bodely eye / and took of hym hys blyssynge. In the age of seuen yere she made a vowe of vir¦gynyte. Taketh hede also by what auy¦sement and what ordre she kepte in ma∣kyng hyr auowe. ¶ Fyrste she desyred and askyd to haue hym to hyr spouse / whome hyr sowle louyd. After that desyre and askyng she forsoke euery ma∣ner spouse behotyng to hym trouth and feyth for euer lastynge. Thys petycyon myght not be denyed. Taketh hede al∣so whome she prayeth / and for whom she prayed / and how she prayeth. Fyrste she prayeth that lady / whyche hath properly inacte the lyberalytee and the fredome of alle graces / and can not but euer graun∣te and yeue grace. Be a man neuer so fowle for synne / she holdeth hyr selfe det∣tour to alle bothe to wyse and to vnwyse She despyseth none / she opened her hande to eche man that hath nede / and stretched out hyr pawmes to eche poure man / and sheweth out hyr self to all folke as a well that neuer faylled. How sholde that gracyous lady not here that lytell mayde so Innocent and feruent / whyche puttyth not awaye from hyr grace synfull men / and women of elder age. How sholde not our gloryous lady receyue the pur∣pose of virgynyte of that holy mayde / whyche gracyously fyrste amonge men founde out the holy & clene lif of virgyny¦tee. How sholde our mercyfull and py¦teuous lady denye thys lytell mayde hyr sone / whyche drewe hym from heuen to the erthe / for he sholde be gyue to alle that belyued on hym. Now ye haue seen whom thys mayde prayed Sithe now I praye thou for whom she prayed She askyd that same / whiche he him self taugh¦te for to aske whyche is asked. She sought that same whyche he byddeth alle men to seke that shall be sought. And he hym self that shalle be sought may not put awaye ne put of. And the petycyon of suche a thynge must nedys haue graū¦te after our lordes promyse where he say∣de Askyth and ye shall haue / Speketh and ye shall fynde. He sayde also in a∣nother place. Fyrste sekyth the kyng∣dome of god and hys ryghtwysnesse. Therefore whanne thys mayde and so besely sought soo tymely in so tender chyl¦dys age the sone of god / whyche is hym selfe the kyngdome of god / How or what manere myght it be / but that she sholde fynde what she soughte / or haue that she askyd / Ferthermore now seeth in what manere she prayed or asked that she desyred / and ye shalle clerely see that hyr prayer myghte not be doon awaye ne voydyd / She dysposed hyr selfe to receyue that she askyd / not onely for the tyme that now is / but for alle the tyme that is to come / She remeuyd alle hyr obstacles / she clothed hyr wyth a plesable clothynge of pouerte to hym for euer of whome she askyd hyr desy∣re / She bonde hyrself / and oblysshed hyr wyth a solempne vowe as to fo∣re god / And soo straytely restrayned hyr selfe / that neuer the world ne the fende sholde lette hyr dysposycyon / In alle thys tyme ther faylled hyr no condycyons / whyche a prayer sholde ha∣ue
/ but that prayer muste nede be herde that she asked for hyr self / she asked fulle mekely that was helthefull / & that was alle helthe / feythfully she stood and sted∣fastely / and to represente hyr perseueraū∣ce. She made a perpetuell vowe where by she remeuyd alle that shold be obstacle for hyr petycyon. Here may ye sekerly conclude that nedys she moste be herde of our lord / thynketh thenne sekerly that as she asked soo she resceyued of our lorde. And took hyr lorde and hyr loue for hyr euerlastyng spouse of hys blysfulle moder as she desyred / and bi helpe of that gloryous lady she was coupled for e∣uer to hyr dere sone by a perpetuell vowe of virgynyte / as it shall be proued wyth the helpe of our lord by a clere token in the last chapytre of this fyrst partye. But now ferthyrmore ye shall knowe that af∣ter thys vowe thys mayde began euery day to wexe more holy and holy. And in that tender age she began to take ba∣tayll wyth hyr flesshe / whyche as yet be¦gan neuer to be rebell. But for all that she purposed to take a waye from hyr fle¦sshe all flesshly mete as moche as she my¦ghte. Wherfore whanne flesshe was leyde to hyr / as it fylle ofte / eyther she ley¦de it to Stephen hyr brothyr or preuely lytyll and lytyll she voyded it / that no bo∣dy sholde perceyue it. She contynued alwaye hyr dysplyens / of whyche I spa∣ke a fore / and encresed hem more sharpely eyther allone by hyr self / or wyth other yonge maydens. Also a grete wele of othyr sowles helthe began to be kyndelyd in hyr / and that was wonderfull in suche a chyldes herte / and syngulerly she loued all tho sayntes / whiche laboured specyally a boute the helthe of mannes sowle. She hadde also knowyng onely by the techyn¦ge of god that Saynt Domynyk ordey∣ned the ordre of frere prechours for loue of the feythe of holy chyrche / and for the helthe of mannes sowle. Wherfore she had that ordre in so moche reuerence / that whan she sawe frerys of that ordre pas∣syng forth in the waye by hir faders how se / she marked wel where they wente / and when they were passyd fulle mekely and deuoutely she kyssed the steppes of theyr fete. From that tyme forward / there wext a grete desyre in hyr sowle to go vn¦to that ordre that she myght profyte man nes sowle wyth other brethern of that or¦dre / but by cause she sawe a grete obstacle in that she was a woman. Therfore she thought to folowe Saynt Eufrosyen as mē clepyd hir in childhode wōderfully as for a pronostycacion / that ryght as saynt Eufrosyen feyned hyr a man / and went in to a monastery of monkes / in the same manere thys mayde is purposed to seyne hyr a man / and go in to ferre contree whe¦re she was not knowe / and take the aby¦te of the ordre of frere prechours / where she myght helpe sowles and saue them from perysshyng. But yet not wytfston∣dyng that same thought and purpose abo¦de longe in hyr mynde. Our lord suffred not that thought to be perfourmed in dede¦ne brought to execucyon / for ye loue was put from hyr mynde to another ende / and our lord wolde also in another maner ful¦fyll hyr desyre. In all thys tyme thys mayde wexte fast in body and encreced in age / but moche more hyr sowle encreced in vertue. Mekenes wext fast / and de¦uocyon encreced / feyth was more clere / ho¦pe was gretely strengthed. Charyte mul∣typlyed hyr feruour. And of all thys vertues was gendryd a vertuous / and a worshypfull sadnes of maneres / and of relygyous putte in the syght of al men whyche consydered hyr dedys. The fader and the moder were astonyed / her brethern and susteren wondred gretely.
Alle the meyne of hyr faders hows meruaylled beholdyng and perceyuynge soo hygh wysdome in soo tendyr age. And amonge many notable wyse wordes and dedys / one I wylle shewe you here in cōmendacyon of that mayde. ¶ Hyt befylle at that tyme after seuen yere and to fore ten yere age that for deuo¦cyon that hyr moder hadde to saynt An¦thonye. She wolde haue a masse I say¦de in the worshyppe of the same Saynt / wherefor she clepyd Katheryne hir dough¦ter and took hyr a certeyne of candelles and a certeyne of syluer and sayde. Goo doughter to our parysshe chyrche and praye oure parysshe preest to syng or do synge a masse in the worshyp of sayn¦te Anthonye. And offer thyse candel∣les and thys money vp to the awtre. ¶ Thys mayde was gladde to doo alle thynge that myght torne to the worshyp of god / and anone she wente to the chyr∣che and performed hyr moders byddyng But for deuocyon that she hadde to he¦re masse / she abode stylle to the ende of the masse. And whan alle was I do / she wente home ageyn / but hyr moder wen∣de she wolde a comen anone ageyn / ano∣ne as she had made oblacyon to the preest ¶ And for as moche as her doughter taryed so longe after hir semyng. Whan she sawe that she was come / she thought to blame hyr doughter and sayd. Cur¦syd be the wycked tōgues / that sayd thou sholdeste nomore come ageyne. Thys was the manere of somme men to saye her langage to her name that taryed to longe out. Thys mayde thenne of gre¦te wysdome herde what hyr moder sayde / and helde hyr stylle a whyle / and spake noo worde ageyne. But after a good space thys mayde drewe hir modre a fy∣de / And wyth grete sadnes of hyr meke¦ly spak to hir modre and seyde ¶ A la¦dy modre when euer I trespas or do aga¦st youre biddyng bete ye me wyth a rodde as you thynketh best that I be more ware Another time for it is worthy and ryght full that ye do so But no thyng I praye you for my defautes curseth neuer good man ne badde / For it is not semyng for your degree And to me it is a full grete affliccion̄ in herte / while hyr modre herde these wordys sche wondrid gretely And no merueill was to here her lytill doughter teche and so wysely enforme hir In somo¦che that she hadde no spirite more to bla∣me hyr at that tyme for the wysdom that she sawe in so yonge alitill thynge Ne¦uer the les she wolde not that hyr dough∣ter hadde knowe that / therfor sūwhat she thoughte to speke ageyne and turned to hir doughter and seyde / Why were you there so longe / the doughter seyde mekely ageyne modre I herde that masse that ye¦badde me goo to / And whan it was I doone I turned home ageyn wythout ony tarieng for I abode nowhere till I come home ageyne Thoo was the modre by tho wordis more edyfyed than she was to fore and went to hyr husbonde / & seyd Thus and thus hath thi yonge doughter I spoke / He than as a good man gaf¦thankynges to god / and bare it stylle pri¦uely in hys herte / And seyde noughte a∣geyne Loo ye mayden̄s that here or rede thys book of thys oo poynt all be yt that it be one of the leste Yet mowe ye we∣le perceyue how our lorde encreceth hys grace all weye in thys yonge mayde till she come to ye yeres of abilitee to be wed∣dyd / of the whyche yeres ye shalle see in the next chapytre For of thys chapitre I make now an ende
¶ But yet ye shall vnderstonde that I had thyse that be conteyned in thys chapy¦tre of the same mayde for the more partye and somme I hadde of the modre and of other dwellyng in hyr fadres hows why¦se she was of that age. ¶ How hyr feruente deuocyon was drawe whyche our lord suffred for encrece of more grace folowyng. And of hyr stronge pacyence wyth the whyche pacy∣ens she suffred in hir fadres hows many Iniuryes. Capitulūq̄rtū AFter the wonderfull and vertu∣ous cours of lyuyng in the fyrst yeres of thys maydens tender age / our lordes wyll was in somme lygh¦te defaute to suffre hyr to fall as he suffred fulle ofte somme of hys holy sayntes / to that entent that they sholde the more my∣ghtely aryse vp ageyne / and lyue more warly / and strenght hem to atteyne to the ryght waye / and the heythe of perfeccyon and gloryously haue the vyctorye of the fende / whyche is euer enemye to mannes sowle. ¶ These wordes I saye here / for whanne she came to the age of the yeres of abylyte to be wedded / that is to saye to the twelthe yere of hyr age or lytel mo¦re / thenne after the manere of the contree she abode styll at home and came not out of hyr fadres hows. And the fader and the moder thenne and hyr other frendes & kynne / by cause they knewe not the may dens purpose / they bethought hem and be∣syed hem to seke aboute where that thys mayden myght worshypfully and parfy tably be wedded and to what prosone. Hyr moder supposed that for the grete wysdome that hyr doughter had / she shol¦de haue be wedded to somme man of gre∣te kyneede / where for she besyed hir fast a∣boute the bodely apparayll and araye of hyr doughter / and taught hyr to wasshe ofte hyr face / and to kembe ofte hyr hede / and to make hyr fayre here / and to voyde alle thynge that sholde be dyshoneste / or sholde make foule hyr face or hyr necke / That whan ony man came to aske af¦ter hyr for maryage she sholde be the mo∣re semely and fayrer. Thys holy may¦de was alle of another purpose and had made another vowe. Alle be it she she∣wed it not to hyr fader ne moder / wherfor vtterly she thoughte noo thynge to do as hyr moder bad hyr / touchyng suche curyo¦syte. She besyed wyth alle hyr streng∣thes to plese god / but no man in that wy¦se. And whanne hyr moder hadde as∣pyed that she had no wylle to that maner of lyuynge / she was dysplesed / and cle∣pyd to hyr Bonauenture hyr other dou∣ghter whyche was late I wedded before / And bad hyr trete soo hir suster / that she myght araye hyr in bodely apparayll as the manere was of wymen in that con∣tre that sholde be maryed / and doo as she hadde bad hyr doo to fore. Hyr moder knewe welle that Katheryne loued Bo¦nauenture fulle tenderly / and supposed that she sholde be broughte in to that mo∣re lyghtely by hyr suggestyons thanne by ony other. And soo she was as ye shalle see after. For by suffraunce of oure lorde she was broughte so Inne tho∣rough speche and example of hyr suster Bonauenture by many maner wayes / that at the laste she assentyd to hyr besy∣nesse in apparaylle of hyr body / after the wylle of hyr moder / not wythstondynge that stably she kepte hyr purpose neuer to haue husbonde. But after the graū¦te to hyr sustre and folowed hyr wylle / in suche araye / she maad soo moche so∣rowe whanne that she was confessyd therof wyth terys and sobbyng that
eche body shold suppose that she hadde do somme greuous synne: She vsed ofte to be confessyd generally: and alway whā she came to ye poynt she accused her selfe full harde wyth wepyng & sore sobbyng But the confessour alle be it he knewe that a vertue it is of god: and lowely sowles to see in them self defaute where none is. And where it is but lytyll / it se¦meth hym full grete / Neuerthelesse for as¦moche as she accused her self / and demed her worthy euerlastynge payne, for that synne / sauyng the mercy of god / There he asked her whether she purposed or wyl¦led in all that tyme to do agaynst her vo¦we: She sayde nay, for it came neuer in her herte. Also he asked agayne whether she dyde it to the plesaunce of ony man. In speciall: or to the plesaunce of all men She answerd and sayde: ther was none somoche payne to her as to be holde men or to be seyne of men / or to be there men shold fynde her / wherfore when her faders men yt lerned dyers crafte in her faders hous came to ony place or chambre whe∣re she was. she fledde as faste awaye as adders hadde come to her soo that all men wondred / She wold neuer goo to the wyndowe ne to the dore of the hows to see how men wente by the waye / Then̄e he sayd why deserued ye that dede whiche was but for a bodely ornamente euerlas¦tyng payne: namely whan the apparel∣le was not to excessyuely / She answerd and sayde that to excessyuely she loued her suster / And as her thought more thā god as at that tyme wherfore she wepte wythout remedye and dyd harde penaū∣ce: Her confessour wold haue replyed agayne and sayde Alle bee it ther was somme maner excesse of loue it was but lytyll: And that dede as of him self was not I doo for noo wycked or euyl enten¦cion / but for vayne plesaunce of her for the tyme and that was not agaynste the precepte of god / She herde how her confessour replyed / she lyft vp her eyen to god / And wyth a lowde voys cryed and sayde. A my lorde god what ghoste¦ly fader haue I nowe whiche excuseth my synnes / and wyth a sore grutchynge agaynst her self / she tourned to her confes¦sour and sayde / Fader thynke ye that this wretchedfull and mooste vnworthy creature of god whiche hath receyued of my maker of nought soo many gracy∣ous yeftes wythout my labour / And wythouten ony meryte shold occupye o∣ny tyme in arraye and vayne apparelle of this roten flesshe whiche myght or in∣duce a dedely synne: I wene she sayde helle suffyseth not to punysshe me: hadde not the pyte of god doo gracyously and mercyfull wyth me / After thyse wordes her confessour durst nomore speke of that mater / But than after that he besyed him to knowe yf that blessyd sowle had euer in her lyf be kept wythouten ony spote of dedely synne: Soo that she hadde kepte fully hole her vyrgynyte both of body and of sow∣le: Not only from the synne of flesshely steryng / but also of alle maner of synne ¶ And after that he knewe how vertu¦ous and how clene a sowle she hadde / This wytnesse and recorde he bare of her conuersacion and both sayd and wro¦te that he coude neuer perceyue ne fynde nother by her generall confessyon ne spe∣ciall confessyon as ofte as euer she was confessyd▪ And that was ryght ofte: that she hadde offendyd agaynst the pre∣cepte of our lorde: But yf it were that is tolde afore the whiche he myght not sup∣pose it were agaynste the byddynge of god / Ne he trowed none dyscrete man wold suppose it / And also he sayde that he founde her euer soo clene fro venyall
synnes that vnnethe he coude perceyue bi her cotydyan confessyon ony maner offē¦ce: It was openly knowen not only to her confessours that knewe her conscyen¦ce: but to all that were conuersaunt▪ with her that neuer or seldon she offended in worde: For eyther she occupyed her ty∣me in prayer and contemplacion or ellis in good edyficacion of her neyghbours / And as for her tyme of slepyng / vnne∣thes she wolde grauute to her a quarter of an houre And whan she sholde ete her mete▪ yet it may be called a mete. euer she prayed and thought holy medytacyons thynkyng of the thynges that she hadde lerned of our lord in her sowle / More her confessyon: Mayster Reymound be∣reth a trewe recorde of her for the tyme yt he knewe her and hadde cure of her consci¦ence / that it was more payne to her for to ete her mete, than it was to an hun∣gry man for to be wythdrawe from hys mete. And a grete tourmente it was to her body after tyme she hadde ete: than it was com̄ely to a fenerous man in ren¦nyng offhis feuer / And this was one of the causes why she wolde ete her mete as it shall be decla¦red wythin forthe for to tourmente and put in payne her body: In what maner of trespaas myght suche a sowle be occu∣pyed: that alwaye was occupyed soo wyth our lord god / And yet not wyth∣stondyng suche good occupacions. She accused her self soo sharpely in confession and soo wyttyngly put her selfe in tres∣paas and offenses / that yf hee cōfessour hadde not knowe her conuersacyon: He myght haue supposed that she hadde tres∣pased where she trespased not, but rather deseruyd mede / Loo ye maydens that heren and re∣den this boke: alle this processe is for no thynge ellys I sayde but by that ye per∣ceyuen this lytyll defaute / In the whyche this holy mayde yelde her self soo mekely gylty / Ye maye vnderstonde therby what per feccyon sheweth therafter by the gracy∣ous yefte of our lorde the whiche her con∣fessour reherseth in this wyse. Bonauen¦tura: ryght as she was besy afore for to araye this holy mayde as the worlde as∣keth / Ryght soo eftsones she besyed her for to enduce her in suche araye by her counseyll to the same apparaylle / She myght in noo wyse inclyne the may dens herte nother generall nother specy all that she sholde shewe her bodely presen¦ce wylfully to the syghte of man / to that entent oonly that she sholde be desy∣red the soner to be wedded. all though her feruour of prayer: and of swetenesse off medytaciō was slaked and wythdrewē from her for a tyme: Att the laste oure lorde wolde not len∣ger suffre that hys spouse the whiche had soo specyally chosen sholde be withdrawe and taryed from hys speciall seruyce / he wythdrewe from her in this wyse- In a tyme whan the same Bonauentura. the suster of the holy mayde sholde bryn∣ge forthe a chylde she was yet yonge y: nough of age for to bere chyldren / Take hede maydens therfore and see by thys / How oure lorde is displesed wyth theym that ben aboute for to lette and wythdra¦we theym that wolde serue hym specially in maydenhode and chastyte of lyuynge / Thys Bonauentura as it is reher¦syd after was alwaye full honeste in her maner of lyuyng bothe in worde and de∣de / But by cause that she besyed her to drawe her suster to wordly thynges the whiche desyred to serue our lorde specyal∣ly / She was smyten of hym and
punysshed wyth a full sharpe deth Ne∣uerthelesse our lord yet wrought full mer¦cyably wyth hyr / for as it was shewed afterward by reuelacyon to thys holy mayde / she was in purgatory / and suf∣fred many greuous paynes. And by the prayers of hir she was delyuered of pay¦ne and restored to blysse / as she shewed afterward preuely to hyr confessour. ¶ Whanne hyr suster Bonauenture was passyd out of thys worlde / thanne thys blessyd mayde Katheryn clerely per¦ceyued the vanyte of thys worlde / and be ganne more feruentely and more gredy∣lye trewely for to be torned to the louely ghostly clyppyng of hyr endeles spouse Jhesu cryste / claymyng and accusynge hyr self gylty wyth Marye magdalene / fallyng doune full streyte to the fete of ou¦re lorde plenteuously shedyng out terys axynge Inwardly hys mercy / praynge and thynkyng vncessably for hyr syn∣nes / that she myght deserue to hyr wyth Marye magdalene the wordes of confort of our lorde as he sayde to Marye thus. ¶ Remittūtur tibi peccata tua. ¶ That is to saye / doughter thy synnes by forye∣ue the. And so she beganne to haue a synguler affeccyon to Mary magdalene For thanne in that tyme she enforsed hyr¦self wyth alle hyr myghtys to conferme hyr to Marye magdalene to haue the mo¦re grace in forgyuenes of hyr synnes. Therfore afterward by encrece of deuo¦cyon thys folow therof that our lord god the spouse of holy sowles / and hys bles∣syd moder our lady Saynt Marye gaue Mary magdalene to thys blyssyd may∣de in to a maystresse and to a moder as it shall be declared more openly wyth Inne forth by the helpe of Jhesu. ¶ After thys the fende enemye to alle mankynde sorowyng that thus his pray was wythdrawe / and delyuerd alle hole from hys power / the whyche be lytell and lytell enforced to drawe it to hym. And also consyderynge / that thys holy mayde encreced more and more to renne quycke∣ly to the tabernacle of mercy of hyr spou∣se Jhesu. He thought felly and wylely to lette hyr of hyr ghostly purpose by the meyne of hyr faders howsholde / besyeng hym by aduercytees and persecucyons to drawe hyr holy to the worlde / that she sholde not be occupyed in suche ghostly ex¦cercyse puttyng in to the the mynde of hir fader and moder and also hyr brethern / that in alle wyse she sholde be wedded. That they myght so by hyr mene purcha¦ce somme manere of kynrede / aboute thys besynesse the fende enduced hem so hyely / that in asmoche as one of hyr doughters was passyd out of thys world / they shol¦de be aboute to recouer the harme of hyr that was dede by hyr that was a lyue. So ferforth that they were aboute to seke an husbonde for thys holy mayde. ¶ Whan thys mayde perceyued and con¦sydered the wyles of hyr ghostly enemye by Inspyracyon of our lord Jhesu. A none myghtely and besyly she contynued in prayer and medytacyon and excercy∣ses of penaunce to haue grace to flee the conuersacyon of men / and soo shewed by open tokenys to hyr frendes / that in noo wyse she was in purpose to be wedded to no dedely ne corruptyble spouse. Syth it so is and was that she had taken so gra∣cyously to hyr spouse in hir yonge tender age the vndedely kyng of endeles blysse Whanne the fader and moder & kyn∣ne perceyued veryly that thys holy may de shewed perseueraūtly bothe by tokens and by worde / that she wylled neuer to be wedded to none erthely man / they thought to bowe hyr herte / by a nother
mene for to consente to theyr purpose. They callyd to them a frende of therys a frere prechour the whyche they loued spe¦cyally / and prayed hym entyrly that he wolde goo and counseyll that holy mayde that she sholde consente to there wylle. To whome the frere answerde and sayde / he wolde do that he myght. But whan he came to thys mayde by communycacy∣on he founde hyr so stedfast in the purpose of maydenhode that by conscience he was so enduced to gyue hyr holsum counseylle and sayde. Syth it is so that thou arte dysposed to serue our lorde god in may∣denhede / ageynst whyche purpose thy fren¦des ben aboute to lette the. Shewe the stedfastnesse of thyn holy purpose / and cutte a waye alle thyn here of thy hede / & peraduenture they wold cesse of there pur¦suyte. As soone as thys blessyd mayde herdethys hys counseyll / she wrought the¦re after as though she hadde I herde it of god. And took a peyre of sherys ano∣ne and cutte awaye hir herys / in the whi¦che she supposed she had synned greuous∣ly / and that that she hated so moche / she cutte it awaye ryght gladly fast by the he de / And whanne she had I do / she couerd hyr hede wyth a Coyf / and so wente for∣the alle ageynst the comyn custome of o∣ther maydens of the worlde / wyth a ker∣chyf on hyr hede after ye doctryne of saynt Powle / And whan hyr moder Lapa aspyed thys that hyr doughter Katheryn vsed thus to couer hyr hede customably / She asked hyr why she dyd so / to who me thys mayden gaf none clere answer / by cause she wolde nethyr lye ne telle the trouthe. Wyth that the moder wente to thys maydens hede and took of hyr ker∣chyfe wyth hyr owne hondys. And so {per}¦ceyued yt hyr here was cut awaey Thāne was the moder sorowfull in hyr herte by¦cause hyr fayre here was cutte awaye waylynge and cryenge in thys wyse. Aa doughter what haste thou doo. Anone the mayde keuered hyr hede ef¦te sones / and wente a syde To the crye of her moder came bothe the fader and the chyldren meruayllyng what it myght be Whanne they knewe the cau of hyr cryeng / they were hugely ameuyd ageyn¦ste this maide / of the whiche trouble was begonne the secounde bataylle ageynst this mayde more sharper than thēne was the fyrst. But yet to thys mayden our lord gaff the vyctorye / that thoo thynges whyche semed lettyng to hyr holy purpo∣se was to hyr grete helpe meruayllously for to knytte hyr to our lord more mygh¦tely Therefore they pursued hyr openly rebukyng hyr and thretyng hyr in worde and dede sayeng thus. Thou wretched creature trowest thou for to escape thus that thou shalt not fulfyll our wylle be¦cause that thou hast cutte awaye thyn he∣re / hyt shall growe ageyn wyll thou nyll thou / and though thyn herte sholde to bre∣ste / yet shalt yu haue an husbonde. And thou shalt neuer haue reste vnto the tyme that thou haste consented to our wylle. And wyth that they made an ordy∣naunce that Katheryne shold nomore ha¦ue no pryue chambre by hir self to dwel¦le Inne / but that sholde openly be occupy¦ed in the comyn seruyce of the hows. So that the place and tyme of prayeng and vnyeng and knyttyng to Jhesu hir spou¦fe sholde vtterly be wyth drawe from hir And also that she shold see hyr self so mo¦che the more in despyte that she was ma∣de a comyn seruaunte. After thys or∣dynaunce thys holy mayde was putte to alle manere fylthe besynesse / and the fow¦le of the kechyn. Suffryng euery day repreues / and euery day also wronges
and rebukyng and dyspytable wordes were multeplyed ageynst hyr / that moste of alle ouercomen wymmenys hertys. For as hyt was supposed / hyr fader and hyr moder and brethern hadden fon∣de a yong man of whos kynrede they we¦ren gretely well apayde. And therefor they steryd and Inpugnyd hyr the more sharpely that she myght the sonner be bo∣wed to theyr consent. But where that oure ghostly enemye the fende / by whos wyckednes & tretcherous werkes all thy¦se thynges were wrought / & doune wen¦de for to wyth drawe thys mayde from hyr clene purpose. There by the helpe of god she was made moost strengest for she was in noo wyse meuyd ne stered of alle that was doone to hyr. But she made hyr a pryue chaumbre / by helpe of the ho¦ly ghoost in hyr owne sowle / fro the why¦che pryue chaumbre she made an ordy∣naunce in hyr self / neuer for to go out for no manere of besynesse And so it was done in dede / that she the whyche fyrste hadde an outward chaumbre assygned to hyr / somtyme stood wyth out and som¦tyme wente oute. But afterwarde whan she had made hyr selue in hyr sow∣le a pryue chaumbre that myght not be take from hyr of no creature in erthe / she went neuer out. Thes ben tho heuenly vyctoryes that may not be taken awaye fro crystis specyall in erthe / ouercomynge wyth out ony doubte alle stylly enemyes As holy wrytte seyth. Regnum dei infra nos est That is to saye / the kyng¦dome of heuen is wythin vs. And al∣so the prophete Dauyd seyth. That all the ioye of our lordes doughter is wythin forthe. Wythin vs wyth out ony doub¦te / there is a clere vnderstondyng / a fr wylle / and a retentyf mynde. Wythin vs also is the gracyous Infusyon of the holy ghoost / the whiche maketh perfyte the¦se ghoostly myghtys rehersed afore / and ouercometh and throweth vnder foot alle outward aduersytres. Wythin vs yf we ben trewe vylners of vertue dwelleth that ghest / the whyche sayde and seyth. Confidite ego vici mundum. That is trusteth feythfully that ye shall ouerco∣me your enemyes / for I haue ouercome the worlde that grete enemye. In this blessyd lord / thys holy mayde Katheryn trustyd so hyghely that she made hir wyth Inne hyr self a chambre by hys helpe / for whos loue she charged not for to lese the chambre made of mannes handes wyth∣out forth. ¶ But now one thynge shall I saye / that mayster Reymond the confes sour of thys holy mayde beryth recorde of that whan that he sholde walke outward by cause other whyle of grete outward be¦synesse and occupacyon that nedys must be done: Thys holy mayde oftymes warned hym and sayde / that he shold ma¦ke wythin hys sowle a pryuee celle / of whyche pryue cell he sholde neuer goo out And alle be it that he vnderstonde hyr not / but so ouerly so lyghtely. Yet neuer∣thelesse afterwarde whan he consydered more wyttely hyr wordes. The wordes that Saynt Johan sayde in the Gospell felle in hys mynde where it is rehersed of crystys dyscyples in thys wyse. Hoe autem non cognouerunt discipuli eius primum. Sed quando glorificatus est ihesus tune recordatisunt. That is cry¦stys dyscyples knewe not alle thynge of hym as touchyng hys passyon fyrst but onely. But after tyme whan he was reysen fro deth to lyue / and gloryfyed / thanne they knewe more openly and cle∣rely / And soo in the same manere wy∣se / bothe to mayster Reymond hyr confes sour & to tho other that were conuersaunt
wyth hyr / it happyd meruayllously that they perceyued more openly and clerely bothe her dedys and hyr wordes afterwar¦de / than whenne they were wyth hyr pre∣sently / ¶ Yette shall I telle you of another holy conseyt and a blessyd ymagynacyon of thys holy mayde / that the holy ghoost taught hyr / by the whyche she ouercome alle wronges and despytes as she tolde pryuely to hyr confessour / axyng of hym mekely how she myght be perfytly glad∣de amonge soo many despytes / And thanne she brake out and sayde / that she hadde suche an ymagynacyon in hyr self that hyr fader represented our lorde Ihe∣su Cryste oure sauyour and hyr moder oure blessyd lady Saynt Marye And hyr brethern and other many of the hous¦holde betokeneth the holy appostles of ou¦re lorde and other dyscyples of hys. And for thys blessyd ymagynacyon she serued hem alle the more gladdely / soo that they were alle a meruaylled therof. And by thys blessyd ymagynacyon she wan another grete profyte / and as oftr as she serued and made mynystracy on / euer she hadde in mynde hyr hyr spou¦se Ihesu Cryste. Whome hyr thought she serued. And soo she beyng in bodely ke∣chyn was alle waye wyth that holy pla∣ce that is callyd Sancta sancto{rum}. And as ofte as she serued atte mete / soo ofte she fedde hyr sowle wyth the presence of oure sauyour. A hyghe and rychesse of endeles counseyll / by how many dy∣uers and meruayllous wayes delyuerest them that trusten in the from alle maner dyseses / and bryngest them in to the ha∣uen of endeles reste / delyueryng them bo∣the from the pytte and the swolowe. Whan alle thys was done / thys holy mayde consyderynge euyr more in hyr sowle ye mede & the rewarde I ordeyned for hyr of the holy ghoost / suffred gladly and nought paynfully / alle the wronges that was putte to hyr. And also she encreced contynually the cours of hyr la∣bour the more / that she myght haue a full ioye in hyr sowle. And by cause that it was not suffred to hyr to haue a cham¦bre by hyr self / but for to haue hyr cham∣bre openly as other hadde. ¶ Therefore by an holy auysement / she chose the chambre of Stephen hyr brother that hadde nether wyf ne chyldren. Whe¦re by dayes tyme whanne he was absen¦te she myght be allone. And nyghtes ty¦me whan he slepte / she prayed after hyr desyre / soo that nyght and daye she sough¦te to see the face of hyr spouse Ihesu Cry¦ste / knockyng at the dore of hys ghoosly tabernacle wyth out cessyng. She prayed our lord vncessably that he wolde wouche sauf to be the keper of hyr virgynytee / sayeng and syngyng in in sowle wyth Saynt Cecylye thys holy verse of Da∣uyd the prophete Fiat cor meum domi¦ne et corpus meum immaculatum. That is lorde Ihesu I praye that myn herte and my body be kepte clene vnderfowled to the / and soo in scylence and in hope she was made stronge in our lord ryght mer¦uayllously. For the more torment and persecucyon she hadde wyth out forth / the more she was fulfylled wyth ghoostly io∣yes wythin forth / soo ferforth that hyr brethern perceyueng hir stedfastnesse say¦den betwyne them seluen thus we be ouer come. Hyr fader that was most Inno∣cente of alle consyderyng pryuely hyr de∣des / perceyued that she was ladde euery daye more and more by the holy ghoost / and nought by the lyghtnes of yonthe. Alle thyse that ben rehersed in thys cha¦pytre / hyr confessour mayster Reymond
had it by reuelacyon of Lapa thys may∣dens moder / and of lyxa her brother wyf and of other also that were in hyr faders hows / But as for other thynges that other folke myght not knowe / he knewe by tellyng of thys holy mayde in confes∣syon / ¶ Of the vyctorye whyche she hadde of them that desesed hyr / And that was by a culuer whiche hyr fader sawe / and by a vysyon of Synt Domynyk Ca v IN the mene whyle that thys ho∣ly mayde was putte in suche re∣proue and shame / it happyd vp on a daye that she entred in to the cham∣bre of hyr yonge brother Stephen. And prayed deuoutly leuyng the dore vnshett for it was forboden to hyr by hyr fader & moder that she sholde not shette the dore. Casuelly thenne it happened that the fader entred in to the chambre sekynge a certeyne thynge of hys sones that he had nede to. And as he loked aboute / he sa¦we hys doughter more goddes doughter thanne hys / prayng in a corner and kne¦lyng / and a lytell whyte culuer restynge vp on hyr hede / the whyche culuer fledde out of the chambre wyndowe whan the fader was entred in to the chābre as him thought Anone the fader axed the dough¦ter / what culuer that myght be that fled∣de so out of the chambre / to whom the dou∣ghter answerd and sayde / that neuer she sawe culuer ne other byrde in the cham∣bre. Thenne hadde the fader grete mer∣uaylle / and kepte all thyse wordes pryue¦ly in hys herte. Fro that tyme forwar¦de there beganne gracyously to encrece in that holy maydens sowle an holy desyre / whyche neuerthelesse was begonne as it is reherced a fore in hyr chyldehode / and now afterward it was renewyd for tuy¦cyon and dysease of kepyng of hyr may∣denhode or virgynytee / and that desyre was no thynge ellys but for to receyue the habyte of the ordre of frere prechours the whyche ordre Saynt Domynyk was bothe foundour and fader. There she prayed bothe daye and nyght to our lord that he wouchesauf to fulfyll hyr desyre. And therto she had a grete deuocyon to Saynt Domynyk / as it is rehersed a fore to a worthy and a fruytfull louer of sowles. Almyghty god therefor sa¦we how wysely and how myghtely hys doughter as a yong knyght faught in ba¦tayll / and wyth what feruour of deuocy∣on she besyed hyr to plese hym wyth alle hyr desyre / he wolde in no wyse dysceyue hyr ne defraude hyr of hyr holy purpose. But for the more sekernesse he comfor¦ted hyr wyth suche a vysyon. ¶ This holy mayde on a tyme had a vy¦syon in hir slepe that she sawe many holy faders / & many dyuers foūdours of ye or¦dre of ye frere prechours / amonges whom she saw saynt Dominyk that she knewe wel I now / holdyng in hys honde a fayre whyte lylye / the whyche lylye semyng to hir was all a fyre as ye busshe yt Moyses saw / & yet was not brennyd. Whan this holy faders al in general & eche in a speci¦all gaf hir coūseyll for hir more mede yt she shold chese oo Relygion of their ordynaūce in ye whiche relygion she myght yelde due seruyce to god. She torned hir self hole to saynt dominik / & so saw in spyryt how yt ye holy fader saynt dominyk came to hir & brought in his honde an habyte of sustris the whyche susters ben called sustres of pe¦naunce of saynt Domynyk Of ye whiche susters ther was ne yet is no lytell nōbre in ye cyte of Senee. And whan thys holy fader saynt domynyk cam to this mayde he cōforted hir with suche wordes & sayde Dought be of good cōfort / & drede no ma¦nere of peryll for ryght as yu hast desyred
this habyte: she thought she receyued it and thankyd almyghty god and his worthy confessour Saynt Domynyke not wyth a lytyll gladnesse but wyth io¦yefull teres that soo perfyghtely hadde cō¦forted her: And soo wyth wepyng she a∣woke & was restoryd to her bodely wyt∣tes. ¶ And whan she was awaked she cau¦ght comforte and bodely strength of this vysyon / and toke soo grete a boldenes of the truste that she hadde in our lorde / that the same daye she called her fader and mo¦der and bretheren togyders and sayde to theym boldely in this wyse / Somtyme ye sayde vnto me / and tretyd me longe tyme therof that I sholde bee wedded to a corruptyble and to a dedely man & though I hadde abhomynacion of suche weddyng in myn herte as ye myght cler¦ly perceyue by many dyuerse tokenes if ye hadde I wolde yet for the reuerence that I sholde shewe to my fader and mo¦der by the bydyng of god vnto this ty∣me I excused me neuer clerly to you / but now by cause I may noo lenger be styl I shall declare to you openly myn herte and purpoos / The whiche purpoos it is not conceyued of newe: but of chyldhode vnto this tyme▪ therfore I wyl ye kno∣we it that in myn chyldhode I made a∣vowe of virgynyte and serue oure lorde sauyour of alle the worlde / and his bles∣syd moder gloryous vyrgyn marie. our gloryous lady / not chyldely but wyth a sa and a longe avysement. And for a grete cause / I made avowe also that I shold neuer take husbond but hym a∣lone: Therfore now syth I am come by the sufferaunce of oure lord to a more per¦fyght age and knowleche and vnderston dyng wytte / wete ye ryght well this is the same purpoos whiche is soo myghty and stroonge in myn sowle that it were more possyble hard flynt stones rather to be made nesshed. than myn herte shold be wythdrawe fro this holy pnrpos and therfore the more ye laboure aboute thys thynge / the more tyme ye lese: Wherfore I counseyll you that ye leue of alle ma∣ner suche tretyng of weddynge as tou∣chyng myn persone / For therin shall I neuer fulfylle your wyll / by cause that I sholde rather be obedyent to god than to man / therfore yf ye wylle haue me suche one in your hous that I now serue god in this purpoos and for to be a commyn seruaunt to serue you all / I am redy in all that I can or may to doo you seruy∣ce gladly: And yf ye wylle receyue me but for this cause that ye wylle putt me out of your hous / I doo you well to wete that in noo wyse myn herte may be wythdrawe fro this holy purpos / ¶ I haue an husbond and a spouse cry¦ste Jhesu soo rychely and soo myghtely yt wyll not suffre me in noo wyse to lacke no thyng / But he wyll mynystre to me all that me nedeth: Whan she hadde sayde alle thyse wordes alle that herde her speke fyll in wepyng / and by cause of her plentnously syghyn¦ge and sobbynge / they myght for that ti¦me gyue none answer: They consyderid to the holy purpos of thys holy mayde ye whyche they myght not wyth saye ne wythstonde: & they behylde also how styll the mayden had I kepte her: how clene & how pure vnto yt tyme / & how bodely she declared her consciens by wordes of gre∣te prudence / & also ouer more they sawe openli that she was rather diposed for to forsake her faders hous than for to breke her holy purpoos and soo they hadde no∣more truste of her weddyng / wherfore it lyked theym better for to wepe than for to gyue her answer / Wythin a lytyll whyle after whan they
hadde cesyd all her wepynge: the fader yt loued her soo tenderly had dredde of god and dred god / soo hyghely hadde mynde of the coluer that he sawe and of many good dedes of the whiche she vsed / The whiche dedes he gretely merueylyng ga∣ue her suche an answere and sayde / Dere doughter god forbede it that we sholde o∣ny thynge wylle or desyre agaynste the wyll of god. For the whiche wyll / and fro the whiche wyll we knowe well thys holy purpoos cometh fro / Therefore it is soo that we ben taught by longe expery∣ence. And now openly we see that thou art not steryd herto by the lyghtenesse of chyldhode: but by feruent charyte of god / Make thy vowe therfore frely / and doo as the lyketh and as the holy ghoost techeth the: ¶ And fro this tyme forward we shall neuer lette the from thyn holy purpoos¦ne thyne ghostely excercise / but only pra¦ye for vs besely that we maye bee made worthy to the promys and the byheste of thyn ghoostely spouse whom thou haste chose by his specyall grace in thyn tender age: ¶ Thenne he tourned hym to hys wyf and to his chyldren and sayde none of you from this tyme forward be to my ne dere donghter greuous. None be soo hardy from this tyme forward to let her in ony wyse to suffer her to serue her spou¦se freely / and she to praye for vs be sely / We myght neuer haue founde a better husbond to her thenne he is. the whiche vochesauf to be so nere of our kynde for to wedde our doughter and haue her to wyf / Therfore we haue none cause to pfayne vs sythe it soo is that we haue receyued now for a dedely man▪ vndede∣ly god and man to be her spouse / ¶ Whan the fader hadde sayde thyse wordes wyth wepynge and wyth wey¦lyng bothe of theym, selfe and also of o∣ther that herde theym and hym speke and namely of ye moder that louyd this may¦de in maner flesshely. then̄e this holy mai¦de Katheryn ioyefully thanked oure lor∣de that brought her to this vyctorye and also her fader and moder wyth alle ma∣ner of lowenes: dysposyng her self to v∣se profytably the lycence that was graū¦ted to her And this is the ende of this cha¦pytre: ¶ But now I wylle ye knowen that redyn or heren this booke that Mayster Reymound confessour to this holy may¦de knewe neuer by reuelacion of the fa∣der that sawe the coluer the whiche restyd on this blessyd maydens hede for the fa∣der was deed or thā Mayster Reymoūd knewe this blessyd mayde. But he kne¦we it by reuelaciō of Cosyns that dwel¦lyd in the faders hous. the whiche cosins recorded and bare wytnes that the fader sawe suche a culuer wyth her ofte tymes And therfore he hadde her in greate reue∣rence. and he wold in noo wyse that she hadde be lettyd or troublyd / ¶ Of the vysyon that she sawe of saynt Domynyk bothe mayster Reymound & her confessour afore hym knewe it by tel¦lyng of this holy mayde.

ryght quyckely for to dyspose meruey∣lously alle her lyf to the seruyse of god: ¶ Att the begynnyng she asked to ha∣ue a lytyll chambre to her self / and so had de it: wherin she purposed to tourmente her body wyth penaunce as in a wylder∣nesse that she myght haue the more fre∣dome of sowle for to serue our lord / How moche and how harde penaunce she vsed in tourmentyng of her body / And how grete loue she hadde in seyng of hyr spouse in that lytyll chambre: there maye noo tongue suffre to telle / Neuertheles I haue rehersed som what in generall of her grete penaunce / And now I purpose to telle you maydens in speciall vnder fewe wordes the hardnesse of her penaunce / soo that ye of the grete vertuous herbes of her holy lyuyng maye taste somwhat of the fruyte that growen aboute the her∣ber bothe of the fyrst and of the laste / And for the condycions and the kyn∣dis of the fruyt: it shall be declared by the helpe of god afterward And the cause why that in this place is rehersyd som̄e what of her fruyte full vertuous lyuing is for nothynge ellys / But for the may∣dens sholde be the more able and redyer to ghostely excercyse: In this lytyll chā∣bre that was graunted her: ofte tymes she consydered swetely the ghostely wer∣kis of our old faders of Egypte. And in ghostely werkys was to her soo moche the more merueylous, and that she hadde the trewe knowleche therof in her faders hous wythout ensample or doctryne off other / Fyrst I shall telle you of her absti¦nence of mete and drynke fro her chylde∣hood in to the tyme that she came to that age / She ete full seldom flesshe as it is re¦hersed afore / but whan she was come to this age and this speciall fredom. she for∣soke vtterly etyng of flesshe soo fer forthe that belonge of custome and vse that she hadde in forsakyng of it: It was so lyght some to her that it was a payne to her for to smelle it as she told her confessour preuely in confessyon and by cause ye shold haue none gretter mer∣ueylle herof. I shall telle you of another grete abstynence / Whan her confessonr perceyued in a tyme that she was gretly wasted and feblyd in body for she recey∣ued none suche mete and drynke that fe∣byll folke sholde be comforted wyth / He gaue her counseyll that she sholde putte in her colde water that she dranke / suger or a lytyl suger roset: Wherby her spyrytys myght the more be quyckenyd / Wyth that she touenyd to her confessour and sayde / A lytyll lyf there is left wytt in me the whiche me semeth ye wolde it vt∣terly were quenchyd / And whan her confessour hadde askyd her why and knewe her excusacion / He vnderstode by her wordes that she hadde soo vsed her to bytter metes and vnsauo¦ry drinkys. that all maner swete thyng was noyous to her body / by cause her dys¦posycion was tourned in to a custome: And soo it was to her of etyng fesshe. as it is rehersed afore: And whan she sholde drynke wyne as the contree forye¦uyd after the tyme she hadde lycence to kepe her chambre: she medlyd that wyne soo wyth water that it loste both his tas∣te and his sauour / and also a grete parte of his colour / But afterward whan she was xv yere of age she lefte alle maner of drynkyng of wyne and vsed to dryn¦ke colde water: And all maner soden mete out taken brede alone / She wythdrewe fro her by lytyll and lytyll e¦uery daye somwhat / and wythin a lytyl tyme after she helde her to brede and ra∣we herbes / ¶ Att the lasie whan she was twenty
yere of age or there aboute. she lefte e∣tyng of brede and helde her only to rawe herbes: Thenne afterward she came to su¦che an hyghe state of lyuyng. nonght by vse and kynde as it shall be declared o∣penly ynogh wythinforth by the helpe of god / But oonly by myracle that alle be it: her body was oppressyd gretely wyth many dyuerse sekenesse and grete tra∣ueylles: The kyndly of dygestyon in the body hadde noo place in her: and the sto∣make also vsed not the myght and the v¦se of his offyce of defyeng: And yet the strengthes of the body not∣wythstondyng her strengthe lyuyng both in mete and drynke were neuer the febly er: soo that than her confessour recordeth of her / alle her lyf was myracle. She my¦ght neuer doo that she dede by strengthe of kynde as physyens sayd and tolde af¦terward to her confessour: but oonly by myracle. All thyse thynges shall clerely and play nely by the helpe of god openly be decla∣red wythin this boke afterward. But as for the conclusyon of her abstynence fro the tyme that her confessour Mayster Reymound knewe her as he recordeth of her is this that she lyued not wyth no mete ne drynke that was nourysshynge to her. ne she hadde none comforte of no∣ne kyndely strengthe: And yet neuerthe¦les she suffred gladly all maner dyseses and laboures: How came she to this sta¦te of lyuynge trowe ye trewely not by bodely excercyse and vse. But rather by fulnes of ye spirite I shall tel you in what wise ye fulnes off ye spirite som̄e tyme re∣bonudeth in to the body. there it is made subiecte & acordyng to the werkys of the spyryte for there the spiryte of a gostely creature is fedde wyth the gyftes of gos∣tely graces / the body suffreth the more pacientli aboue naturall strengthe of his own nedes: who wold be in dobute herof I trowe none resonable creature / whether martyrs in her holy martyrdome suffred not gladly aboue naturall strengthe tor¦mente and myserye of theyr bodyes in her passyons / I trowe yeis / And fro whens cometh this trowe ye / but of fulnesse of the spyryte / This is ofte tymes knowen by experyens in ou¦re dayes: that yf a man or a womman be occupyed in goddes seruyce deuoutly / He reketh neuer how longe he fasteth and neuer to speke wyth creature / but whan he ceseth of the speciall deuocion / And is occupyed in outward bodely be∣synes / it is harde for hym for to faste & doo as he dyde before / Whens cometh this grace / but oonly of the fulnes of the spyryte that conforteth the body: the whi¦che accordeth to the werkis of it / & alle be it that this is a gyfte aboue nature yet naturally the spyryte otherwhyle com∣muneth wyth the body: And the body wyth the spyryte bothe in good and euyl In thyse wordes I denye not / but that ther ben somme the whiche maye faste mo¦re esely than somme. But symply for to faste and absteyne longe tyme togyder in this lyf / me semeth it is inpossyble bi nature thus moche is rehersed of her grete abstynence for this tyme / Takyth hede al¦so of another thynge that this holy may∣de tourmentyd her body wyth: besyde all her abstinence / She made to her a bedde al of bordes wythout ony other stuff: other∣whyles she wolde sytte or stonde in holy medytacions & other whyle knele & pra¦ye: & alwaye whan she wolde slepe she la¦ye coun wythout ony doyng awaye off her weryng clothes. For she weryd al∣waye wollen bothe nexte her body and wythout some tyme she vsed the hayre or the cilyce, and yt she lefte afterward by cause as her confessour supposed / That
she that was clene wythin eschewed vn∣clen̄es wythout that is engendred of the cilyce or of the hayre / But for the hayre she vsed an yron chayne next her body e∣uyr syttyng faste to her sydes wythoute ony remeuynct or ease / vnto the tyme it endented the skynne / And made a mar¦ke ther vpon as it hadde be forbrennyd: As her ghostely doughters and her fela∣wes tolde after ward to Mayster Rey∣mond her confessour / the whiche ghostely doughters and felawes ofte tymes for dyuerse sekenesses that she suffred con∣streyned her for to chaunge / her clothes and for to wasshe awaye the swete. And therfore her confessour afterward by cause of her grete sekenesse that she suf¦fred a lytyl before that she sholde be deed constreyned her by obedyens that she shol¦de leue her cheyne. All be it she wolde not doo it by hyr good wyll. Euermore she contynued in wakyng tyl the daye dawed on the morowe as it shall be declared more opynly here after¦ward. After that by lytyll and lytyll our lorde gaue her grace to ouerco∣me slepe / that vnnethe she wold slepe half an houre in two dayes: And vnnethys she wolde receyue that half houre but as sekenes coustreyned her therto / And she wolde saye otherwhyle to her confessour that the moost traueylle that euer she hadde. was for to ouercome sle∣pe / It was soo harde a bataylle for her or she myght haue the vyctorye of it. Yet more ouer as her confessour recorded off her yf she myght haue founde ony body that cowde hadde vnderstonde her and commyned wyth hyr of vertue: And of the goodnes of god it shold not greue her though she hadde been wythout mete or drynke and slepte an hondred dayes and an hondred nyghtes she sholde ne∣uer haue be wery but rather the fressher and she gladder / She tolde ofte tymes to her confessour that she was neuer soo well refrysshed in spyryt in thys lyf / as whan she myght fynde wyth whome she myght commy∣ne of the goodnes of god: And that knewe well tho the whiche were con¦uersaunt wyth her. ¶ This was openly perceyued in her whan she myght haue leyser to speke off god / that tho thynges of vertu the whi∣che were hyd in her herte / appieryd stron∣gely by ghostely gladnesse in the body outwarde / ¶ And whan she hadde noo leyser to talke of oure lorde thenne she was feble: Herof bereth wytnesse her confessour: Mayster Reymound / to the worshyp of god and of his owne sha∣me that oftymes Whan this holy mayde wolde speke of the goodnes of our lorde and of the greate myseryes that he shewed to her. by cause of the lon¦ge tyme of her contynuaunce in spekyng And also by cause he was ferre from her louyng as he sayde hym selfe / He fyll in a slombryng / and alwaye she contynued forthe in spekynge: For she was reysyd vp by loue in to the breste of oure lorde / nothyng perceyuynge that he was a slepe. tyll a longe tyme after∣ward: And whan she perceyued that he was a slepe / wyth a grete voys she awoke hym & sayde: why lese here ye the prouffyte of our sowle for a lytyll slepe: speke I to a walle or to yow / ¶ Ferthermore she desyred aboue alle this to folowe the stappes of the holy fa∣der Saynt Domynyke / And that was in this wyse / she receyued euery day they¦es dyscyplyne wyth an yron chayne: The fyrst dyscyplyne was for her self. The seconde for alle tho that were a lyue And the thirde for them that were deed /
¶ Thus we rede in the legende of saynt Domynyk that he vsed contynually / & therfore she vsed the same longe tyme af¦terward. ¶ But after tyme she was fe¦blyd with sekenes that she myght no lon¦ger vse hyt. ¶ And whanne hyr confes¦sour axyd of hyr pryuely how & in what wyse she vsed that manere of penaunce / wyth a grete shamefastenesse she know∣leched to hym. ¶ That in euery dysciply¦ne she occnpyed an houre and an halfe / so that for the moost partye the blode fo∣lowed foo the sholdres doune to the fete. ¶ Loo maydens what perfeccyon was in thys holy maydens sowle / that thryes in the daye lete hyr self blood for goddys loue / shedyng hyr blood for hys blood. Seeye not in what vertue she was of / that wyth out ony exaumple or Informa¦cyon of ony man in erthe that vsed suche grete penaunce wyth in hyr faders hows Redeth Sayntes lyues and wrytyng of holy faders of Egypte / leueth none vnsought / but sercheth ouer all / and espye whether ye fynde ony lyke to hyr. Ye shall fynde Saynt Powse the fyrst here∣myte lyued longe in deserte. But a crowe brought hym euery daye half a lof to hys mete. Ye may also fynde saynt Anthonye a full holy lyuer and dyd gre∣te meruayllous penaunce / & yet he wen∣te to dyuers ankrys aboute / and of eche of them he gadred somme floures of ver∣tue. Ye may also fynde of Saynt Hyl¦laryon an holy lyuer. Yet as Saynt Je¦rome seyth / he was fyrst enformed to ver¦tuous lyuyng of Saynt Anthonye and ro wente to deserte and there myghtly o∣uercam hys enemyes. Ye may fynde also of Macharye and Arsenye and ma¦ny other whyche is longe to telle of / that had techers to vertuous lyuyng / one or moo / bothe in worde and also in exsaum∣ple / what in deserte / or in Relygion And this holy mayde had nethyr hyr doctryne to vertues in Relygyon / nother in deserte But in hyr faders hows wythout ony Informacyon or exaumple of ony man in erthe / and there to came to a grete per∣feccyon of abstynence / notwythstondyn ge the manyfolde lettyng the whyche she suffred in hyr faders hows Shall I yet saye more of thys maydens commenda∣cyon I praye you lystene a lytel why¦le & I shall telle how holy wrytte maketh mencyon yt Moyses fasted twyes fourty dayes / wyth out mete and drynke / and Ely ones / and our lord Ihesu cryst also as the Gospell sayth / that thei fasted more by many yeres contynued Holy wryt¦te telleth not. Saynt Johan baptyst though he were in deserte he lyued by ho∣ny soukeles and herbes. But symply that he fasted I fynde nowhere I wryton. Of Marye magdelyne allone hyr sto∣rye maketh mencyon of hyr lyf that she fastyd euery yere fourty dayes to gyder wyth out mete or drynke thre and thyrty yeres folowyng / leuyng in a Roche of the see. There for I trowe it was that our lord and hye blyssed moder commytted hyr to thys holy mayde for to be hyr may stresse and hyr moder as it is somwhat I touched afore. And as it shall clerely be de declared afterward by the helpe of god. By thys may ye knowe that thys holy mayde had a specyall yefte and a synguler grace of god. Not that she is preferryd in holy lyuynge aboue alle the Sayntes / the whyche ben rehersed afore. For that were a full odyous compary¦son. So for to make suche lykenes bytwe¦ne Sayntes / among whiche sayntes our sauyour Ihesu Cryst is I nempned / to whome for to lyken ony saynt in compa∣ryson of holy lyuyng / that sholde be euen
wyth hym / it were blasfemye / al tho other sayntes whyche ben named / they be not rehersed for to make lykenesse in merites of lyuyng / but that ye shal consydere and take hede fyrst of the grete magnyfycence of our lord Ihesu cryst / that euery day by hys gracyous plentuous largenes mul¦tplyed hys newe yeftes and grace / whe¦re wyth he arayeth ghostly & maketh per∣fyte hys chosen sowles. Another also that ye shall consydere and take of the gre¦te synguler worthynesse in hyr was noo Iniurye ne wronge to other sayntes For holy chyrche syngeth and seyth specyally / & syngulerly of euery saynt by hym self. Thes wordes of Salamon. Non est inuē¦tus similis illi. That is none I founde ly¦ke to thys: These wordes muste be vn∣derstonde of the grete myght and large fre¦dom of our lord / makyng holy and perfy¦te hys chosen sowles. The whyche may & wylle endowe & arraye euery saynt syn∣gulerly wyth a specyall yefte of grace wyth out ony wronge of other. Of alle thys mater now I shall cesse and procede forth in the fyrst purpose By thyse con¦dycyons of abstynence of thys holy may¦de / may be vnderstōde clerely that she was lene in body / that wyth so many herdenes of penaunce and sharpe afflyccyon was so often tymes tamed / and all was for to make hyr body buxom and subgett to the seruyce of the sowle. On a tyme hyr moder Lapa tolde to mayster Reymond hyr confessour▪ Thought that hyr dough¦ter tormented so holy hyr body in penaun¦ce / she was of soo grete myght & strenghte in body / that she wolde wyth out ony gre¦uaunce lyf vp on hyr sholdres a borthen that was I now for an hors for to bere / & bere it vp in to an hyghe garet aboue two longe steyers For she was that tyme as she sayde twyes soo grete in body thanne she was afterward at the age of xxxviij whan she had contynued in soo grete pe∣naunces. Hyt was no meruayll and so it is / for but yf it had nought I be that our lord hadde kepte hyr by myracle / hyt hadde be no meruayll though she hadde be all wastyd awaye. For at that tyme whan that hyr confessour mayster Rey∣mond knewe hyr / she was a full slender creature and that was no meruayll. For the spiryte encreced in vertue / the weyker wexxd the body as though it wer ouer∣come of the sowle / & not wythstondyng alle thys she wolde euer laboure gladdely and namely for the helthe of sowles. All be it she suffred grete sekenesse in hyr bo∣dy / for the spyryte whyche was so strong wythin susteyned and comforted the feble body wyth out. Now shall I cesse here of / and torne ageyn to the fyrst mater of thys chapytre. Whan thys holy may∣de hadde full graunte and lycence of hyr frendes for to serue our lord in hyr lytell chambre assygned to hir / and there began full feruently for to styghe vp ghoostly to hyr heuenly spouse. The serpent our ol de enemye the fende though she had ouer¦come hym dyuers tymes afore. Yet he cessed not for to assaylle hyr estesonys. He steryd Eue hys doughter. La∣pa thys maydens moder by a carnall lo∣ue that she hadde more to the body of hyr doughter than to hyr self / for to lette hyr of hyr penaunce For on a tyme whan the moder came to hyr doughter / and as∣pyed howe she bete hyr self wyth an yren chayne / she cryed waylyng wyth a lowde voys and seyde. A doughter what doste thou / thou arte but dede / for thou sleest thy self / allas who hath coūseylled my dough¦ter herto / who hath steryd hyr to do thys. And soo wyth cryeng and waylyng thys olde womman tormēted hyr self as
she had be a wood body wyth tryng of hyr clothes & of hyr here / for she thought hyr doughter was but dede. By the noy¦se of thys cryeng all the neghbours were styred aboute for to come Inne and see what thys olde woman eyled. Whan they cam they sawe how thys holy mayde had made hyr a bedde all of bare boordys where on she rested when she wolde slepe. And wyth vyolence hyr moder took hyr out of the chambre and broughte hyr to her owne chābre there she laye / for she thought that she wolde make her slepe in her owne bedde wyth hyr. And whan thys holy mayden sawe thys / by wysdo∣me of spyryte she shewed grete gladnes in chere and kneled doun a fore hyr mo∣der prayng her mekely wyth esy wordes that she wolde wouchesauf to put awaye alle hyr steryng and vnpacyence and be esy / for she was redy to obeye to hyr as she wolde haue hyr redy for to lye wyth hyr as she wolde bydde hyr. Whan she thus wysely psyd her moder for to kepe hyr in quyete / she layde hyr doune by her in that one syde of the bedde / and had the∣re swete medytacyons that she was won¦t to haue. After tyme hir moder was a slepe / she rose vp pryuely and wente a∣gayne to hyr holy ghostly excercyse. The fende eftsones hadde enuye herto that she sholde so encrece in vertue / styred hyr mo¦der the seconde tyme ageyn hyr. But there ageyn thys holy mayde vsed thys prudence by cause she wolde nomore ma∣ke ▪hyr moder sory wyth hyr / she took pryuely a post and leyde it in hyr bedde vnder a shete and clothes abouen / that the moder whan she wold comen and vysyte hyr sholde suppose that it had be she / the whyche had laye there vnder the clothes. And yet neuer thelesse she kepte hir co¦myn stome of harde lyeng / as she dyd a fore / hyt was not longe tyme after / but that the moder aspyed thys well / & when she had aspyed it she sayd to hyr dough∣ter in thys wyse. Doughter I see well alle my laboure is in vayne / I may not chaunge the from thy purpose / ese it is to me for to lete it ouer passe lyghtly. And therefor go and slepe there on thou arte I wont. And soo she was ouercomen wyth the stedfastnes of thys holy mayde and suffred hyr euer afterwarde to lyue as the holy ghoost styred hyr. Thus en¦deth thys chapytre. Somme thynges ther ben rehersed there Inne that hyr con∣fessour mayster Reymond knewe and hadde reuelacyon of by the holy mayde Katheryne▪ As is of hyr grete abstynen¦ce and other sharpenesse of penaūce / and of hyr maner of worchyng in them / and somme thynkes he knewe by reuelacyon of hyr moder Lapa / and som of other dy¦uers matrons that were conuersaūt with her. But som thynges he knewe by hym self / namely of hyr synguler & gracyous yefte of abstynence. ¶ Of the laste vyctorye that she had in a bathe. And how she took the abyte of Saynt Domynyk Whyche she had long tyme desyred to fore. Ca vij WHan thys holy mayde was res∣toryd ageyn to hyr deuoute excer¦cyse the more that she perceyued that the enemye of all mankynde was be¦sy for to lette hyr / the more feruent she was in hyr ghostly excercyse. Euery day she wayled & euery day she wepte / axyn∣ge and prayng our lorde deuoutly that he wold wouchesauf to gyue hir grace to res¦ceyue the abyte of saynt Domynyk that she had long desyred. The whiche thorugh hys grete yt was be hote hyr by our
holy fader Saynt Domynyk in a vysy∣on. For she was neuer seker in hir self to kepe the purpose of maydenhode vnto the tyme she resceyued that holy abyte she wyst well that after tyme she were a∣rayed wyth that abyte alle maner speche of hyr weddyng shold cesse / and she shol∣de be suffred for to serue hyr ghoostely the more frely. Wherfore she prayed hyr fa¦der & moder that they wold gyue hyr leue to be one of the susters of penaūce of sayn t Domynyk / that ben called in comyn speche of the Cyte of Senee susters of the mantll. And ouermore she prayed to the same sustres that they receyue hyr to the same abyte amonge theyr holy nom¦bre. To thys axyng the mod was not well apayed / alle be it she sayde not ones nay / but euer she was aboute as moche as she myght for to withdrawe hyr from hyr grete penaunce that she vsed. And for thys cause she purposed on a tyme for to go to an hoot bath / or for to be bathed & hyr doughter wyth hyr. That assone as thys holy mayde had felte ony maner comforte & solace to the body by that ba∣thyng by lytell & lytell she shold haue left hyr grete penaunce▪ Thys was not done wythout wyll of the fende / the whyche be∣syed hym in that he myght to wyth dra∣we suche a feruent sowle from the ghostly callynge of hyr heuenly spouse He tau∣ght thys synfull wōman Lapa this may¦dens moder full pryuely his malycyous wylles Neuerthelesse bi cause ther may no counseyll preuayll ne haue the may∣strye ageynst the coūseyll of god Thys holy mayde that was armed wyth the ar¦mere of vyctorye bothe in hyr ryght syde / and eke in hyr lefte syde torned alle the fende is trecherous wylles to grete profy¦t of hyr sowle. Whan she came to the bathe / she founde a newe maner bathyng in hyr sowle / how that she shold tormente hyr body amonge the delycyous bathes. She went to the condyt there the hote wa¦ter cam Inne to the bathe & there she satte all naked and suffred pacyently the hote water brenne hyr tender naked flesshe the whyche was more payne to hyr / thenne whan she bete hyr wyth a cheyne Now shall I telle you how hyr confessour kne∣we it. In a tyme hyr moder Lapa tl¦de mayster Reymond afore hyr doughter how they went for to be bathed / & thenne thys mayde pryuely tolde hym how she was bathed / and how wysely she asked leue of hir moder whan she was there that she myght be bathed by hyr self whan all folke were gone. For she wyst well yf hyr moder had seen hyr she myght not do as she dyd And thenne hyr confessour axyd hyr how she myght suffre so grete he te wyth out peryll of deth. Thys mayde answerd to hym & sayd full symply / that whan she satte in that bathe / she thought besyly vpon the paynes of purgatorye & of hell / prayng to our lord whome she had so hyely offendyd / that he wolde wouche∣sauf to torne mercyably tho peynes that she had deserued in to that temperall pay∣ne that she suffred gladly. Of hys mercy she had so grete gladdenesse in hyr herte / that all the peyne was ryght swete to hir & therfore hyr body was no thynge hurte there by / though she felt peyne. Whan she had tolde thys tale / hyr confessour wente home / & she ageyne to hir penaūce that she was wont to vse And whan hir mod yt {per}ceyued / she had no more hope tho of hir chaungyng. But yet she cessyd neuer wyth out grutchyng of the penaunce that she vsed. Of the whyche grutchyng thys mayde hyr doughter lyghttly suffred hit ouer passe wyth a defeere hauyng myu∣de rather of hir holy purpos / & excyted &
steryd hyr moder euery day that he hold go to the sustres of penaūce of saynt Do∣mynyk for to praye thom that hyr dough¦ter myght receyue them abyte of penaunce that she had so long tyme desyred: The moder seyng that she myght haue no reste for hyr doughter / she wente to the susters of penaunce & prayed that hyr doughter myght receyue the abyte amonges them. To whom they answerd & sayd. That it was not hyr custome to receyue may∣dens / ne yonge wymmen to that abyte / but onely wedowes of sadde age and of good name & fame that wold fully gyue hem to goddes seruyse For syth it is so that susters of that abyte be not enclosed vp / but eueryche of them lyued at home in hyr owne hows / hyt were full necessary that eche of them were of suche sadde age yt they myght & coude gouerne them self sad¦dely. The cause why these susters of pe¦naunce answerd thus / it shall be declared by the helpe of god openly I nough in the next chapytre that sueth. Whan the mo¦der had this answere she went home & tol¦de hyr doughter / the whiche answere was to the doughter full gladsome / & to the mo¦der not full heuysom. Neuerthelesse yet thys holy mayde mystrusted not / for she wys welle hyr purpose sholde be fulfylled that was behot hir of so gloryous a fader as Saynt Domynyk. And therefore efsones she prayed hyr mod that she shol¦de not cesse / but go to thyse susters ageyn & praye them wyth asmoche instaunce as she coude / that she myght receyue that aby¦te. The moder dyd so / & brought ageyn the same answer as she dyd fyrst Then ne sone after it happed that thys mayde fyll seek in body / the whyche sekenesse co∣mynly yong folk ben vexyd wyth or thā¦ne they come to a sadde age. And yet praduenture that passynge he that sh suffed in the hote bathe myght be cause the¦re of / al be it that it was the wyl of god yt it shold be so. All the skynne of hyr bo¦dy was full of bladders & byles / that vn¦nethe she myght be knowe. And there to also she had a strong feuer. The moder seyng that hyr doughter was soo seek all though she loued hir sones & doughter ten¦derly Yet thys doughter whom that she nourysshed wyth hyr owne mylke she lo¦ued more tenderly / & therefor she was the more sory of hyr dysease. And she kne¦we no cause where of thys sekenesse cam For suche a sekenesse myght not come of abstynence / but rather of supfluyte. And also that same tyme it was comyn seke∣nesse to yong chyldren & yong maydens And therefor she coude not deme where of the sekenesse came / & what ese & remedye she myght do there to / she dyd bothe in wor¦des of comfort / & also in dede / syttyng alle waye by the beddes syde by hyr. But the seker ye doughter was in body / ye stren¦ger she was in hyr holy desyre / wayteng after leysyr to constreng hyr mod in ma¦nere for to pursewe to fulfyll hyr desyre wysely & swetly she sayde to hyr moder. Good dere moder yf ye wold I were ho¦le & ferd well / I praye you beth aboute yt my desyre may be fulfylled for to receyue that abyte of penaūce. Ellys I wote well that our lord & saynt domynyk the why∣che haue called me to there seruyce woll so ordeyne for me / that ye sholde no longer haue me in thys lyf. Whan the moder herde thys oft & many tymes rehersed to hyr / she beynge a ferde lest she sholde haue deyde / went to the same susters ageyn & prayed them so entyerly of the abyte / that they were ouercome wyth hyr prayers & so graūted hyr in thys wyse. Yf youre doughter be noght ouer semely in body / & ouer fy in beaute / we shall graun
your axyng & receyue hyr And yf she be to fayre we drede vs of the peryll of slan¦dre / and of malycyou lyuyng of men in thyse dayes. And for thys cause we dare not consente to receyue hyr in noo wyse. To whom the moder answerd & sayde Cometh and see hyr & eue ye the dome whee she be fayre or not. There were sente two dyscrete matrons chosen amon¦ge them wyth Lapa for to see thys may∣de bothe of dysposycyon of hyr body / & al¦so for to serche hyr desyre of soule When they come they founde thys mayde lyeng seek in a bedde / & therefor they myght not clerely knowe the dysposycyon of hyr bo∣dy for sekenesse. Neuerthelesse as by hyr wordes they knewe hyr feruent desy¦re of sowle to the seruyce of god / & were gretly astoyned there by. And also glad¦de seeng so yong a mayden passe in ver¦tuous yuyng many olde matrons / whe∣refor they took her leue ioyefully gretely edyfyed by hyr wordes & tolde theyr fela¦wys with a grete ioye what they harde & sawe. Whan thise susters herde thys / by counseyll of the frerys they receyued hyr with oo wyl & one assent amōges them sendyng worde to the moder / that also so∣ne as ye mayden were hole / she shold bryn¦ge hir to ye frere prechours / that she myght rceyue the abyte of Saynt Domynyk / the whyche she had so long desyred in pre∣sence of the brethern & the susten of the sa¦me abyte as the custome is. Whan the moder tolde these wordys to hyr dought she was gladde that she wepte for ioye & thanked our lord & saynt domynyk that hadde fulfylled hys promys and byhst. Thanne she began to preye to god that she myght be hole of hyr bodely Infyrmy¦ / for to fulfylle hir holy purpose in recey¦uyng of the abyte / lest she shold be lette & delayed of hyr desyre / for that bodely seke¦sse. And there she was fyrst gladde of hir bodely sekenesse with meke suffraū¦ce. Afterward she was as heuy therof besekyng our lord with besy prayers that he wold wouchelauf to delyuer hyr wyth out ony taryeng of that sekenesse the whi¦che letted the purpose of hyr desyre / & as she prayed our lord graūted hir / for wyth in fewe dayes afterward she was hole. Our lord wold not alway of his good¦nesse denye the axyng of suche that con∣ferme them euer wyth all theyr besynesse to fulfylle hys wyll For what euer she axyd or desyred she referred it to him who me she loued wyth all the myghtes of hir sowle / and to who seruyce she offred hyr self all hole body and sowle / whome she was restoryd of bodely hele. Alle be it the mod was aboute to tarye hyr of hyr pur¦pose lenger tyme. She made suche Instaū∣ce to hyr moder / that the day and houre was assygned whan she sholde receyue hyr abyte / the whyche abyte she receyued wyth a grete ghostly gladnesse / whanne the moder and the doughter were come to gyder to the chyrche. The frere that had the charge of the susters arayed that holy mayde wyth that maner of abyte in pre∣sence of them all of the colours of whyte and blak in token of Innocence and me kenesse / the whyche abyte holy faders of Saynt Domynykes ordre ordeyned for to be hadde. Soo that by the whytnes is vnderstonde Innocencye / and by the blak¦nesse mekenes. For as mayster Rey∣mond hyr confessour recordeth and wry∣teth▪ Ther was none abyte soo well ac¦cordyng to hyr conuersacyon of lyuyng bothe Inward and outward. Thenne thys mayden wyth alle hyr myght o that tyme forthward mortyfyed hyr bo∣dy in sleyng of the olde lust of synne wyth alle hys braunches of pryde / in the
wynnyng of the veray mekenesse / the whyche mekenesse betokeneth the mantell of blacke that she hadde receyued. Al∣soo she besyed hyr wyth alle hyr mygh∣tes for to kepe the Innocencye of virgy∣nytee and maydenhode / not onely of bo∣dy / but also of sowle to her endeles spou¦se Ihesu cryst / the whyche is veray lyght for to receyue by hym fayrenesse of ver∣tuous lyuyng / the whyche fayrenesse is betokenyd by the whyte cote vnder the mantell. Yf hyr abyte had be all black or alle whyte / tho two thynges mekenes¦se and Innocencye myght not properly be vnderstonde therby. And yf hyr aby∣te hadde ben graye russeth / it myght re∣presente mortyfycacyon. But not pro¦perly puryte and clennesse of sowle. Thys was the cause why the susters at the begynnyng denyed hyr thys abyte lest she hadde not be able to bere it in me∣kenesse and clennesse of herte / dredyng of hyr yonge age. Whanne that holy mayde hadde receyued that abyte / hyt be¦come hyr better than it dyd the matrons. Therfor it had not be well do / that it had¦de be denyed hyr / whyche abyte was or∣deyned a fore of holy faders in token of Innocencye. Syth it soo was that she passyd in clennes alle the chastyte of we∣dowhode. Of one thynge hyr confes∣sour Mayster Reymond recordeth and wryteth that / that abyte hadde neuer hys full perfeccyon in the Cytee of Senee vn∣to the tyme that holy mayde hadde I take vpon hyr for to were hyt. She was the fyrst mayde in that Cytee that took it vp on hyr / the whyche many maydens afterward receyued also. Soo it myght be songe of hyr that verse that Dauyd the prophete speketh of.

That is to our lorde god endeles kyng / many may¦dens shall be brought Inne after thys ho∣ly mayde Katheryne. ¶ How thys mayden encreced it shall be declared afterward by the helpe of god / But now I shall make an ende of thys chapytre and procede forthe how thys ho∣ly abyte beganne of thys holy Relygy∣ous estate / lest for defaute of knowyng there of / the opynyon and the fame of thys holy maydens vertuous lyuynge myght be lessenyd therby in somme men¦nys hertys / as for the matere the whyche is reherced in thys chapytre mayster Rey¦mond recordeth and seyth that he hadde it by relacyon of hyr moder / and of hyr self And as the abyte it nedeth no profe / for it is knowen openly ynough. ¶ Of the begynnyng and the founda∣mente of the Relygyous state of the sus∣ters of penaunce of Saynt Domynyk / and where of came the manere of lyuyng of tho sustren.

For they hadde none power neuer to wythstonde her hereye for the defaulte of temperall substaunce / ne for to releue clerkys and poure folke after the dewe of her offyce / This consyde¦red our holy fader Saynt domynyke & myght in none wyse suffre this myscheff in holy chyrche for the grete and entyrly loue that he hadde therto he chaas a wor∣thy lyf of pouerte both for hym selfe and also for theim that shold be his folowers And thenne beganne to pursue forthe for the ryght of holy chyrche assosyen∣g to hym certyn laye people that ded god and that he knew well and so cōmy¦ned wyth theym of the ordeynaunce of an holy lyuyng that sholde recouere agai¦ne the rychesses of holy chirche and defen¦ded it myghtely euer afterward / & faith¦fully agaynst heretikes by comyn assent suche a lyf was soo graunted and ordey¦ned. ¶ For there that our holy fader Saynt Domynyke founde ony well wyllynge folke to suche a lyuyng / Fyrst he endu∣ced theym for to swere that they sholde ke¦pe and obserue all the thynges that shold be reherced to theym to the vterest for to putte her goodes and her lyf therfore in Jeoperdye: and lete this holy lyuynge sholde bee lette by suche that we wed¦ded / He made also wyues to swere that they sholde also not lette her husbondes to maynten in suche a poure lyuyng the ry¦ght of holy chyrche: but rather sholde hel∣pe theym to her power in all that they mi¦ght: And to eyther partye this holy fa∣der saynt domynyke he byhote theym sy∣kerly yf they kepte this purpoos: ende∣les lyf for her mede / ¶ Tho men that toke this holy lyf vp∣pon them were called fryers of Crysico knyghthode / Neuertheles by cause tey sholde beknowen fro other by somme to∣ken and that they sholde haue somme maner of besynes aboue the vsage of o∣ther laye peple: He gaue them the colour of his owne habyte that bothe men and wymmen of the same knyghthode of Ihe¦su cryst shold were whyte and blake.

By cause the maner of lyuyng was not hard: A blessyd fader of the sa¦me ordre / the whiche was called Munyo wrote that maner of lyuyng / and toke it to thyse wydowes: the whiche manere of lyuyng in to this daye is callyd amon∣ges theym a rule: All be it thay it may not properly be callyd soo / In as moche as encludeth not wythin it the thre pryn¦cypall vowes that other relygyous fol∣ke haue / And after tyme that this nom∣bre of susters thus encresed in dyuerse partyes of Italye / Our holy fader the pope in tho dayes the whiche was called honoryus perceyued that good lyuynge of thyse susters graunted theym by bulle that in tyme of Interdyction that they myght here her dyuyne seruyce amonges the fryer prechours / And soo our holy fader the pope Johan the whiche came af¦ter hym he hadde made the constytucions of Clementynis agaynste the vyrgyns and by gardys: He declared the bulle of the same decretall or constytucion that it sholde not be vnderstonde of the same susters of penaunce of Saynt domyny∣ke: For by that Decretall the astate is not repreued in ony wyse / ¶ Loo maydens by this ye may vnder stonde why that state of liuing was foū¦de in wymmen only: And why the sus∣ters answerd soo att the begynnynge to the moder of this holy mayde / that were not wounte to receyue maydens to that state of lyuyng: but oonly to wydowes approuyd in sadnes / thyse thynges that ben wrytten in this chapytre for the more parte Mayster.

How this holy mayde in receyuin∣ge of her habyte made none by∣hest to the thre pryncipalle avo∣wes of relygyon / by cause that the estat asked it nought: As it is rehersed afore Yet neuerthelesse she purposed to kepe¦full stedfastly tho thre pryncypal avo∣wes ī her self. As for the vowe of chasty¦te there was none doughte of / For she hadde made avowe of maydenhode afore in her tender age. as touchyng for her o∣bedyence: She purposed oonly for to bee obedyent to that fryer that was mayster of the susters and to the pryoresse of the same susters. But also to her confessour the whiche obedyence she kepte to her ly∣ues ende / ¶ For as she sayde by her lyue whan she sholde passe out of this worlde: She hadde neuer mynde that she brake onis her obedyence / Neuerthels by cause there were somme the whiche hadde enuye off her holynesse both bacbyters and lyers that sayde the contrarye / ¶ I doo you to vnderstonde maydens that thowe this holy mayde hadde none other tourment whyle she was lyuynge in erthe but oonly vndyscrete byddyng and mysseyng of her souereyns: she my∣ght haue ben in maner a martyr by the grete pacience the whiche she suffred: Her confessours vnderstood nonght ne gaue none credence many tymes to the excellent gyfte of grace that she receyued of god / Ne gaue none reuerence to the werkys of our lorde that wrought in her merueylously / And therforre they wold haue made her lyuyng after the commyn lyuyng of her susters / not consyderyng ye opyn tokens of grace that were shewed in her dyuerse tymes. But rather they myghi be lykened to ye pharysens that seyth the opyn myracles the whyche our lord wrought: And yet they grutched by cause he helyd a man v∣pon the sabat daye seyng thus / ¶ Non est hic homo a deo qui sabbatum non custodit: That is this man is not of god hals that kepeth not his sabat daye This holy mayde whan she hadde recey∣ued her habyte of penaunce▪ she besyed her what she cowde to obeye to her soue∣reyns / and therto she durst not forsake ye waye of vertuous lyuynge / the whiche our lord taught her by hym self / soo that bytwene thyse two / she was sore angwis¦shed in tourment that ther maye none tongue telle it ne penne wryte it / Was this not trought ye maydens a martyr∣dome for her / I trowe yeis / A a lorde god ofte was it sayde to her in repref yt all her vysyons come nought of god but of the fende / ¶ Notwythstondyng that they the whi∣che sawe in her many merueylous wer∣kes and that therto they myght see that all her lyf was myracle / as it shall decla∣red more clerely here after / Now was this a stronge martyrdome as me semeth ¶ And as touchyng to pouerte of ly∣nyng she kepte soo perfyghtly that ver∣tu pouerte that she beyng / in her faders hous and housholde where greate plente was of temperall goodes: for her self she toke no thynge but that she wolde gyue frely to poure folke / And therto her fader gaue her a specyall leue / ¶ She loued soo moche pouerte that as she sayde preuyly to her confessoure she hadde neuer ioye of her faders hous by cause temperall goodes were soo plente∣uosly vsed therin: And therfore she prayed oure lord herte∣ly that he wolde vochesauf to tak awaye that rychesse: And brynge hyr

For she vsed to ete none maner of mete that was made by the fyre out taken breed a¦lone as it is rehersed afore / ¶ Also she made an ordynaunce in her owne herte neuer to come to mete but wyth wepyng: soo that euer afore mete she wolde offre to our lord teres for to fe¦de her soule fyrst / And than afterwarde wolde she susteyne her body wyth mete / ¶ Her faders hows was to her as a wyldernesse and deserte / notwythston∣dyng the confluence of peple that were therin. ¶ Besyde all this what wakyng what prayers what medytacions and what teres she vsed.

To whom this holy mayde answerde full mekely and prayed hym that he wol¦de vouchesauf to teche her Thenne sayde oure lorde thyn soule may esely be taught by Inspyracyon and by worde for to dyscerne bytwene the one and the other / But by cause that I wol∣de it myght prouffyghte as well to the o∣ther as to the / Therfore I shall teche the by worde. ¶ Doctours of holy chyrche whome I haue taught the trouthe seyn / and soothe it is / that myn vysyon begynneth wyth a drede but euer in the passyng it setteth a sowle in greate reste and sekernes / It begyn̄eth wyth a maner of bytternes But euermore more and more it wexith swete / And the contrarye herte dothe the vysyon of the fende: It gyueth in the be¦gynnyng as it semeth a maner of glad∣denes or sykenes / or ellys swetenesse / But whan it passeth awaye / euer it en∣creseth in the sowle dred and bytternesse This is the trewest knowleche for to kno¦we myn wayes from the fendes wayes ¶ The waye of penaūce and the kepyn¦ge of myn preceptys and commaunde∣mentes in the begynnyng it semeth har∣de and sharpe / But the more a sowle
prouffyteth in kepyng of theym: the mo∣re esely it waxith ¶ The waye of synne in the begynnyng semeth full delectable but euer in encres therof a sowle is ma∣de more and more dampnable / ¶ But yet shall I gyue the another to¦ken for to knowe myn vysyon from the vysyon of the fende / Vnderstonde this for a sothe / that sythe it soo is that I am trouthe euer of myn vysyons the sowle of man receyueth a greate knowleche of trouthe: and by cause that the knowleche of trouthe is full necessarye to the soule as well to her self as to me that she may knowe me & her self / of the whiche know¦leche she passeth out fro her self in settin∣ge lytyll by her selfe and honoureth and worshyppeth me / The whiche condycion properly is called the condycions of me¦kenes. Therfore it were full nedefull that a sowle sholde thus knowe her self / And soo be made meke by vysyon. The contrarye is of the vysyon of the fē∣de. sythe it so is that the fende is fader of lesynge and kynge of all the chyldren of pryde / And he may not gyue but that / that he hathe as his lesyng and pryde. Therfore as of his visyō / a soule semeth moche by her self and is made glad and  Joye / The whiche is properly the condycion of pryde: and so she is by lefte swellyng and bolnyng in pryde: Then̄e therfore yf thou examyne and dyscusse dylygently in thy self: mayste knowe whether vysyon come to the of trouthe or ellys of falsenesse / yf it come of trouthe: it maketh thyn sowle meke / yf it come of falsenes & by desceyte: it maketh thyn sowle proude. ¶ Thenne this hooly mayde whan she hadde herde thys / she kepte this holsome doctryne full dylygently in her sowle and tolde it afterward to her confessour and also to other for her edyfycacion as it shall be rehersyd wythinforthe by the helpe of god. And thenne began our lor¦de to shewed this holy mayde visyons & reuelacyons plentuously: soo ferforth yt vnnethe myght be founde two men so ho¦mely in conuersacion to gyders: as oure lorde Jhesu and she were to gyders / For whether she prayed or redde or had medytacions or walked or slepte o wyse or other: she was comforted many times whan she spake wyth other she hadde re∣uelacions or vysyons and spake in her sowle to our lord whyles her tongue spa¦ke outward to other / But that myghte not longe contynue for her sowle was so wonderly I drawe vp to her spouse Jhesu that wythin a lytyll whyle afterward. She was rauysshed out of her bodely fe¦lyng. Out of this rauysshyng came ma∣ny merueylous thynges that foloweth afterward▪ as well of her grete abstynen¦ce as of her merueylous doctryne: And also vpon myracles the whiche oure lorde shewed in her by her lyffe / now than lest there be somme that wolde be in doubte whether this holy mayde hadde suche re∣uelacions or not. I shalle telle you how her confessour Mayster Reymound pre∣ued it whether her reoelacions and vysy∣ons were trewe or not / At the begyn∣nyng whan Mayster Reymound herde of her hye cōuersaciō of liuyng he begā to waxe homely wyth her in comunycacion wyth her / for he coude not fele it verely yt suche reuelacyons in her myght be trewe the whiche mystruste was for his better / And therfore he enquyred by diuers me¦nes and wayes to knowe whether they came of god. or of the fende: Or whether they were fals or trewe: For thenne came to his mynde of ypocri¦tis the whiche regnyd in his dayes / and
that he founde many dyscetys / & namely amōges wymmen / whom ye deuyll dyscey¦ued wyth ye vyce aboue all other creaturs Hyt came also in to his mynde how ye fyrst womman Eue was deceyued / and many suche other / & therefor he doubted the more of this holy mayde. Whyle he sto¦de long thus in suche a doubte / it came to his mynde / that yf he myght by hir pray¦ers gete of our lord one grete contrycyon for hys synnes aboue the customable con¦trycyon yt he was wonte to haue / by that myght he knowe that all hyr vysyons re∣uelacyons & dedys come of the holy ghost For ther may none gete suche a contry¦cyon / but by yefte of the holy ghost. And all be it that ther is none lyuyng that can saye whether he be worthy of god hate or loue Yet hertely contrycyon for synnes is a grete token of grace Mayster Rey¦mond had not so sone thought thys / that he went to thys holy mayde / & prayed hir hertely / that she wold praye for hym to ou¦re lord / yt he wouchesauf to for gyue hym the synnes the whyche he had done To whom thys holy mayde answerd & sayd that she wold full gladly. Than sayde mayster Reymond that he myght not be easyd in his desyre by hyr prayers onely but yf he had there of a bull that hys syn∣nes were for gyuen Of whom thys ho¦ly mayde axed wyth a smylynge chere / what bull he desyred to haue. He ans∣werd that in token of a bull he axed one grete contrycyon for hys synnes / the whi¦che contrycyon thys holy mayde sayde he shold haue all redy. Thenne that tyme hyt semed to mayster Reymond that she vnderstode clerely all hys thoughtes / & so he went from hyr. On the morne it hap¦ped mayster Reymond for to be seek and laye don in his bedde / whom kepte one of hys brethern a deuoute man the whyche was called Nycholas of Pyse. The place ther he lay in seek was an hows of sustres in as moche as he caught hys sekenes so¦deynle Jorneyng by the waye. Whan this holy mayde perceyued that he was se¦ke. She aos vp of hyr bedde not wyth∣stondyng that she was seek hir self of the feuers / and other dyuers passyons / and sayd to hyr felawe Goo we and see we how srere Reymond dothe fare. And hyr felawe answerd & sayd that it was no nede / & though it were nede / yet was she more seker than he Neuerthelesse yet she come to hym and axyd how he ferd. Anone whan he sawe hyr he meruayl¦led gretety & sayd to hyr as feilly as he myght speke. Aa lady why come ye hyther / ye be agrete dele seker than I am. Thanne she began to speke of the good¦nesse of our lord as she was wonte to do and of oure vnkyndnesse ayenst hym. Wyth that mayster Reymond hir con¦fessour arose vp out of hys bedde gretely comforted by hyr wordes / and sate in an other bedde besyde / hauyng no mynde yet of the wordes that the holy mayde spake to hym at euen afore All this whyle she contynued in spekyng of the kyndenes of our lord / and of oure grete vnkyndenes. Sodeynly in tyme of hyr deuoute co∣munycacyon came to hys mynde a clere consyderacyon of hys synnes / that hym thought he stode afore the ryghtwys Ju∣gement to be condempned to the peyne for his wycked lyuyng ryght as a theef that stood before a temporall Juge. Hym thought also that he sawe in hys soule the grete benygnyte & the mekenes of our lor¦de / that gracyously delyuered hym fro the peyne that he was worthy for to haue / & not onely that / but also he clothed hym wyth hys owne clothes / ther he was na∣ked / and had hym in hys holy hows / and
fedde hym and nourysshed hym / and ac∣cepted hym to hys seruyce / and ther to by the synguler grace of hys ende. Loo the goodnesse / hys deth / vnto lyf / hys dre¦de vnto hope / hys sorow vnto ioye / & hys shame vnto worshyp. By thyse consy¦deraciōs & clerely knowynges / and sygh¦te of hys soule / the wyckettes of the wyn¦dowes of his harde herte were broken vp & opened / and the wellys & ryuers of we¦pyng terys aperyd plenteuouly / by cau¦se that the foundament & the grounde of hys trespassys were shewed so clerely to hym / in so moche that he wayled & that he was aferde laste by suche grete plente of sorow / hys herte & his brest wold haue to barst Whan thys holy mayde saw that she was styll & suffred hym a whyle to be fedde wyth hys owne terys / for therefore she came. Wythin a whyle after he ces∣syd lytell & lytell / and bethought him mer¦uayllously of this newe grace / thynkyng also of hys petycyon the whiche he axed of this holy mayde the day before / wyth that he torned to hyr & sayd / is thys thy bull that I spak of to you yesterdaye. She answerd & sayd ye laynge hir hondes vp¦on hys sholdres seyeng thus / haue in mynde fader of the gracyous yeftes of our lord. And soo wente home to hyr chambre / and he abode stylle wyth hys fe∣lawe gretely edyfyed & comforted. A∣nother tyme the same mayster Reymond had another excellent token of thys holy mayde wyth out ony axyng afore Hit happed on a tyme that thys holy mayde was vysyted by dyuers sekenes / & laye seek in hyr bedde. And sent after hyr con¦fessour desyryng to comen wyth him pry¦uely of other newe reuelacyons / the why¦che our lord had shewed her grete sekenes¦se beganne to speke of the goodnes of our lord / and of the reuelacion that he shewed hyr that day. He heryng so grete reue∣lacyon and wonderfull shewed to hyr / and to none other that euer he herde of / ha¦uyng no mynde of the grace that our lord hadde gyue hym afore by prayers of this holy mayde. He bethought hym of som¦thynges that she rehersed and sayd to him¦self thus / whether it be all trewe that she seyth. Whanne he had thought thus / he loked sodeynly in hyr face / and saw that hyr vysage was transformed in to man∣nes vysage berded / the whyche vysage be¦helde hym stedfastly / and made hym sore aferde. Hit was to his syght a semely longe vysage of myddel age / not hauyn¦ge to long a berde / but of a resonable assi¦se coloured after whete / shewyng in his syghte a mageste after the mageste of ou¦re lord Jhesu / and myght in no wyse for that tyme see none other face / but onely that face. Of thys syght he had so grete a fere / that he lyfte vp his armes and be∣gan to crye and sayd. Oo who is he that loketh vpon me. To whome this holy mayde answerd and sayd. He that is seeth and beholdeth you wyth that wor¦de / that dredefull face vanysshed awaye / and the maydens vysage appyred to him clerely. Thys was no feynyng thyng but a trewe / as he recordeth & bereth wyt∣nes in hys wrytynges He recordeth al¦so for the more confyrmacyon of that my¦racle that after that sensybly vysyon / he hadde soo clere a knowyng wythin hym¦self im his sowle by ghostly Illumynyng of the mater that the holy mayde spak to hym / of the whiche he wyll not pupplyche it openly. That hym thought he felt in experyence that thyng the whyche our lor¦de sayd to hys dyscyples whan he behote them the holy ghoost seyeng to theim thus Et que ventura sunt annunciabit vo¦bis. That is whan ye haue receyued
the holy ghost / he shall shewe thynges that ben to come Loo For the mystrust that he hadde to her wordes oure lorde of his gracyous goodnesse wouchesauf to teche hym clerely by him self / he afterward for to bere wyttenes to other that hir reuelaci¦ons weren & ben trewe pryntyng stedfast¦ly in his mynde / the grete graces that he shewed to Saynt Thomas of Inde / for he that wolde not be taught & enfourmed by open tokenes of gracyous gyfte / the whyche he receyued by this holy mayde he was taught and enformed by example of suche a disciple that was mystrowyng as he was For after tyme he had recey¦ued a gracyous token of conpunccyon of our lord a fore by merytes of holy pray∣ers of this holy mayde / yet he contynued in mystrust of hyr reuelacyons that they were not trewe. Wherefor our lord him¦self / shewed hym self openly to his oute∣ward wyttys / that he myght therby kno¦we by open experyence that he spak in hir so that it may be sayd that he shewed him thenne to mayster Reymond / the whiche mystrowed as he dyd som tyme to saynt Thomas of Inde by bodely felyng. And ryght as he cryed afterward & sayd this worde Deus meus et dominus meus. That is my god & my lord So may thys mystrowynge renuwed saye after thise two vysyōs of this holy mayde / that she is & was the veray spouse and the ve¦ray discyple of our lord god. All these ben rehersed to you maydens / that ye shol∣de be in no doubte / ne despyse the reuelaci∣ons and the vysyons / the whiche ye shall here by the helpe of god afterward Alle be it that no wytnes may be founde of re¦corde saue she allone / but that ye sholde he¦re hem / rede hem / & vnderstonde hem with re¦uerence. And also that ye may lerne ther by holy examples & doctrynes / the whiche our lord hath shewed in suche a ves¦sell by kynde seke & bryttell. But by gra¦ce meruaylously made strong and precy¦ous. And thus I make an ende of this chapytre. All thoo thynges the whiche mayster Reymond was taught & enfour¦med of this holy mayde / he hath declared them openly in this chapytre. Outake one thyng that he was charged by hyr to kepe it pryuely of a certeyn reuelacion as it is rehersed a fore. ¶ Of a noble doctryne whyche our lord gaf to hyr in her begynnyng / and of other doctrynes in the whyche he founded hyr maner of lyuyng. Capitulum x SYth it so is that the grounde & the foundament of trust and byleue touche the reuelacyons of this ho¦ly mayde by the helpe of god / is declared in the chapytre that goth afore. Therfo¦re now I shall procede forth & shewe you the spyrytuall edyfycacyon of this same mayde. And by cause that trewe sow∣les & feythfull ben fedde and edyfyed by the wordes of our lord. Therefor I shall telle you & shewe you a notable doctryne of ye whiche this holy mayde was taught of our lord him self. Thys holy mayde tolde to hyr confessours amonges whom mayster Reymond was one / that in the begynnyng of hyr vysyons our lord ap¦pyred to hyr whan she prayed & sayde to hyr in this wyse. Knowest thou not doughter who thou arte / and who I am yf thou knowe well these two wordes / thou art / and shalt be blessyd Thou art she that art not / and I am he that am. Yf thou haue the veray knoweleche of these two thynges in thy soule / thy ghost∣ly
enemye shall neuer dysceyue the. But thou shalt escape gracyously all his sna∣res / ne thou shalte neuer consente to ony thyng that is ayenst my commaundemen¦tes and preceptes. But alle grace alle treuthe alle charyte thou wylte wynne wythout ony hardenesse And now is this a bryef worde and a grete & in ma∣ner Infynyte and endeles. Oo this is a grete wysdome expressyd vnder fewe syllables Whether this be not that leng the that brede / that heythe and that depthe the whiche saynt Poule desyred for to ha¦ue wyth all sayntes / I trowe yes. Oo dere maydens consydereth & beholdeth mer¦uayllously this Incomparable tresoure / the whiche is founde in this holy maydes breste. For our lord Jhesu that vnde∣ceyuable trouth seyth to this holy mayde thus. Yf thou knowe thyse two thyn¦ges in thy sowle / the fende shall neuer de∣ceyue the Me semeth it is full good for you to make here thre tabernacles or dwel¦lyng places vnto the worshyp of god / that excellent doctou the whiche tched the vnderstondyng of thyse fruytfull wordes Another to the loue and deuocyon of this holy mayde Katheryne. The whi¦che receyued the holsom doctryne of this fewe fruytfull wordes And the thyrde to the ghostly tresoure of valour of all tho the whiche fynden lyf in this fewe fruyt∣full wordes. In the vnderstondyng of thoo fruytfull wordes / now be founden & had ghostly rychesse so plenteuously that it shall no nede be to alle tho that haue soo founde this ghostly rychesse / for to begge of other A whether this bryef fruytfull sentence be not trewe / where it is sayde. Art not thou she that is not / I trowe¦yes. Euery creature is made of our ma∣ker Jhesu cryst of nought So ferforth that yf our lord Jhesu cryst oure maker wolde cesse for a tyme / be it neuer so lytell fro conseruacyon of hys creature that he hath made. Anone that creature shold tor¦ne in to nought / whan soo euer a creature doth synne / the whyche synne in hym self is nought: Ne of hym self he may noo thynge do or thynke that is ought. As Saynt Poule seyth. And that is mer¦uaylle / for he may not be ne haue beyng of him self / ne yet be conserued of him self in his beyng. And therfore the aposle sayd. Qui se existimat aliuid esse cū nichil fit ipse se seduci. That is he that wenyth he be ought / he is nought / he decey ueth hym selfe. Sest thou not mayde how noughty a creature is A creature made of nought / euer of him self owyng to nought by synne maketh him self nou¦ghte / as Saynt Austyn sayd / for he may noo thyng do that is ought by hym self / but rather that is nought / as oure lorde sayd. Sine me nichil postis sacere. That is wythout me ye may do ryght nought / the whyche nought is synne. Therfore ye may wel clerely know by this that a creature of hym self is nought And that knewe well Saynts afore thys tyme / the whiche by knoweleche of this veray wysdom excluded veraly out of theyr sowles alle manere of synne. What manere of Inflacyon of synne may entree in to suche a sowle the whiche knoweth hir self nought How may she be ioyfull in vayne glorye of ony good werke that euer she dyd / the whiche kno∣weth wel I nough that suche good dedys come neuer from hir / but fro god How may suche a sowle enhaunce hir selfe by pryde aboue other that holdeth hyr self nought. How may a sowle that thus settth hir self at nought / Inwardely de∣spyse other / other haue enuye to other. How may ony creature haue vaynioye
in outwarde rychesse / that now hath dys∣pysed all his owne ioye of hym self. I trowe suche a creature is taught by the wordes of our lord endeles wysdom whe∣re he sayd Siego quero gloriam meam gloria mea nichil est. That is yf I seek myn owne ioye / my ioye is nought Al¦so how may suche a creature that knowed hym self in no wyse his owne / but onely his that made hym / see of alle outwarde thynges / this is myne / syth he hym self is not his. How myght make suche a crea∣ture to haue delectacyon in flesshely syn∣nes / that euery day restreyneth hym self by suche manere consyderacion of nought Loo maydens by this bryef fruytfull wordes / thou art nought / ye may consy∣dere / that all maner of synne is and may be excludeth. That other bryef fruytful worde that oure lorde sayde to this holy mayde is this. I am he that am / whether this bryef fruytful worde be a newe wor¦de / ye forsothe bothe newe & olde. This is that olde worde that our lorde sayde to Moyses in the sussh / the whiche semyd brennyng whan he sayde. Qui est mi∣sit me. That is say to the chyldren of Israel He that is sente me to you. Hit is also now a newe worde / by cause it is newe reherfed to this holy mayden in ly∣ke wordes that she the whiche by the fyrst bryef fruytfull sentence was I taught to knowe hir self nough / sholde lerne by the nexte fruytfull sentene to aske our lorde ought / the whiche is the endeles welle of all essencyall beyng. By thyse bryef fruytfull sentencys may ye knowe that a creature is nought of hym self. For all that he hath of vertue / and of beynge co∣meth of god maker of all creatures. Almyghty god maker of al creatures hath onely of hym self and of none other endeles perfeccyon of essencyall beynge. For he myght neuer forme and make all thyng of nought / but yf he had an In∣fynyte vertue of essencyall beyng in hym self. Wherfore alle that euer oure lorde Jhesu / that souerayne mayster taught his spouse in tho two bryef sentences as it is rehersed afore / is no thyng ellys but this / that she sholde knowe hir self as she is / and our lord verayly as for hir ma∣ker in the depnes of hir herte / and thenne she sholde be blessyd. In the same wy∣se I fynde I wryten that he sayd to saynt Ktheryne the virgyn and marter. Whan he vysytre hir in prysone / Doughter kno∣we me for thy maker. Of suche manere of knoweleche cometh all maner of perfec∣cyon and all ordynate settyng of the sow¦le / What is he that may not loue so lar¦ge and so free a gyuer wyth all his herte / and all his sowle / what is he that is not styred euery day more and more to loue suche a lorde that fyrst er thanne he made his creatures / he loued hem not for theyr deserue and meryte / but onely by his In∣fynte goodnes / ¶ What is he that ferth not and dredeth contynually to offende in ony maner of wyse / soo grete and soo dredefull a maker soo myghty and soo large a gyuer / soo gladsom and soo free a louer. What is he that may not gladdely suffre all ma∣nere of dyseases for suche a lorde / of who me he hath receyued / and receyuyth day by day / and hopeth to receyue wythoute ony deubte soo manyfolde goodnesse. What is he that sholde be wery / or tor¦mented by sekenes to please so amyable a lorde. What is he that endeyneth to kepe reuerently and louyngly in hys mynde the blessyd wordes that suche a lorde wouchesaue to hys creatures. ¶ What is he that wyll not gladdely o∣beye to the commaundementes and pre∣tho
thynges that the sowle loueth ye whi¦che desyre may not be hadde wiwout wer¦ke: soo ferforth that in as moche it loueth soo moche it werketh / And yet neuerthe∣les it trusteth nought in her owne werke as in her owne self: but only in our lorde that worched in her: The cause of this louely desyre is noo∣thynge ellys / but the very knoleche off god that he is aulterd / therfore amonge all other merueylaus thynges of this ho¦ly mayde: she helde that doctryne the whi¦che our lord taught her syngulerly to bee worshy ped / To the whiche wurshypfull doctryne yet shall I adde more to / For but yf I be gretly dysceyued all they co∣me out of the fyrst notable doctryne. Ofte tymes this holy mayde was woūt to comyn and to speke to tor confessoure Mayster Reymound of the worthynes and condycions that our lord loued off a sowle / And she sayde that suche a sow∣le perceyued not ne seeth not ne loued her self ne none other sowle ne hadde none mynde of none creature: This was a full hard word to Mayster Reymound for to vnderstonde and ther∣fore he prayed this hooly mayde for to declare it. Thenne she sayde a sowle seeth her selfe that she is verely nought of her self and knoweth perfyghtly that all the goodnes wyth alle the myghtes of the sowle is her maker / ¶ She forsaked vitely her self And alle creature and hedeth her self fully in her maker our lord Jhesu in soo moche yt she sendeth fully and pryncypaly all her ghostely and bodely werkynges in hym In whom she perceyued that she maye fynde all goodnes and all perfection off blessydnes and therfore she shalle haue none wyll to goo out from suche inwarde knowleche of hym for nothynge / And of this vinte and loue that is en∣cresed euery daye in suche a sowle: She is transfourmyd in a maner in to oure lord that she may neyther thynke ne vn¦der stonde ne loue ne haue no mynde but god or ellys in god / she maye not see her self ne none other creatures but onely in god / Ne she may not loue her self ne no∣ne other but only in god. Ne she maye not hane mynde in her self ne of none o∣ther but only in god: ne she maye haue no mynde but only in her maker: Ryght as a man that is vnder a water and swymmeth vnder the water nether seeth ne touched nothyng but water and that is vnder the water / And thynge yt he is aboue ye water he neyther toucheth ne seeth of that yt is aboue ye water it shy neth vnder the water for that he may per∣ceyue and yet none other wyse but in the water / And as they maye byshewed in water as longe as he is voder the wa¦ter: Ryght so fareth it of a sowle that is hyd in the loue of god: ¶ All this she lerned of our lorde that dyuyne loue the whiche neuer teched er∣rour to his meke dyscyples: ne gyueth theym cause to coueyte ony thynge wyth out hym / For euer her ghostely excersyse in is hym / ¶ Another tyme this holy mayde reher syd in presence of her confessour Maister Reymound and to many other that wer called to clennes of lyuyng: A full nota¦ble doctryne and a vertuous the whiche is good for pure maydens to knowe / Whos chast lyuyng is full speyally to god / And the more ye ben met ner to god by swete meke maydenhede the sonner ye maye vnderstonde that vertuous doc∣tryne / And it is this that a sowle the whiche is vertuously I
mette to god as it is rehersed afore: As moche as it hath of the loue of god / Soo moche it hath of the hate of her owne sen∣sualyte. For of the loue of god natural∣ly cometh hate of synne the whiche is do ne agaynst god / the sowle thefore con∣syderyng that the rote and the begynnyn¦ge of synne regneth in the sensualyte & there pryncypally is roted: She meued and storyd hyghely and holyly wyth alle her merytes agaynst her owne sen∣sualyte / not for to vtterly destroye the ro∣te For that mayr not be longe the sowle dwelleth in the body lyuyng in this lyffe But euer it shall be lefte a rote namely of smale venyall synnes: Wherto accordeth ryght well saynt Johan whan he sayth thus / Si diximus quia peccatū non habemus / ipsi nos seducimus &c. That is yf we saye that we haue noo maner of synne in our sensualytes na∣mely of venyall syn̄es▪ we desceyue oure self / And by cause she maye not vtterly destroye that rote of synne thus in her sen¦sualyte as it is sayde afore / She concey∣ued a grete displesaunce agaynst sen sualyte and of her sesulyte / The whiche dyplesaunce spyngin vp an hooly hate and a dysplrsyng of her sensualyte by the whiche the sowle is e∣uer wel kepte fro her ghostely ennemyes ¶ There is noo thynge that kepeth the sowle soo stronge and soo syker as doth suche an holy hae: and that felt well the Appostle whan he sayde / Cum infirmot tunc forcior sum et potens / ¶ That is whan I am feble and syke in myn sensualyte by hate of synne / Thenne I am the stronger and myghty er in myn sowle / Loo fader of suche hate cometh vertu and of swete febylnesse and sykenesse cometh ▪strengthe / And of suche displesaunce cometh plesaunce. ¶ Suche holy hate fader haue euer with you: For it shall make you meke and e∣uer to fele meke thynges of your self / it shall make you pacient in aduersyt / and temperate in prosperyte / And sette you namely in all honeste of vertue: And it shall also make you loued oie god and man: ¶ A / a / now is that a paynfull sowle and full of woo that hath not this blysse For where that suche holy hate is not. ther is moche vnordynate loue the why∣che is the stynkyng thorroke and canell of all synne: and the cause and the rote of all euill concupyscence. Al suche and lyke wordes this hooly Mayde comyned daye by daye / wyth su¦che drede in commendyng of holy hate of synne and in despysyng of vnordynate loue: ¶ But whan euer she perceyued that o∣ny defaute of synne or of synne ī many creature that comyned with her or in ony other / Anon she wolde be styred to com∣passyon and sayde / Loo brethern loo sus¦teren the cause of this trspaas and this synne is nothyng ellys but an vnordy∣nate loue of your self: The whiche vnor∣dynate loue is norysshed of pride and of all vices / ¶ Doth all your besynes for the loue of god to pute awaye suche vnordynate loue of your owne self oute of your ow∣ne hertes / And planteth therin holy ha∣te of synne for certeyn that is the ryght waye of perfection and amendement off all synne / ¶ Loo maydens how well thys hooly maydes doctryne accordeth to the wor∣des of Saynt Poule where he sayd thus Quod virtus ī infirmitate perficitur That is vertu is made parfyghtly ī seke¦nes and febylnes and that was whā he
prayed to our lord to remeue awaye his temptacions / To whome oure lorde ans∣werd and sayde thus / ¶ Sufficit tibi paule gracia mea.

And there to gaf hyr a sensy∣ble and an euerlastyng token / for to fele in erthe how plesaūt almes dedes ben to hym. Me semeth that whan our lorde sayd to thys holy mayde that he wolde she we hyr that lytell crosse at the daye of do∣me the whiche she gaue in almes And also that he wolde araye hyr wyth a clo∣the of ioye / in heuen is no thyng ellys but a sikernes of endeles helthe. And ther¦to an excellent ioye in blysse for hir mede Therfore maydens sett not lytell by su¦che reuelacyons and suche tokenes / for sy¦kernesse of endeles helthe onely causeth so grete ioye and so grete comforte in a sow¦le that it were impossyble a tongue to tell it or a penne to wryte it. What foloweth after suche a sykernesse of ioye trowe ye to a sowle. Trewely encrece of all vertue of pacyence / of strengthe / of temperaunce of besynesse / and delygence in kepyng of hyr self / in holy werkes of feyth / of hope / of charytr / and of suche other vertues. And all that were harde to suche a sou¦le a fore ben made by suche comfort ryght esye Loo what grace suche predestyna¦cyon notefyed to a clene sowle wercheth. Another tyme also it befyll that thys holy mayde fulfylled wyth compassyon perceyued that ther was a man the whi∣che made him pore wylfully for goddes lo¦ue and lacked mete / wherfore she toke pre¦uely a lynnen bagge and fylled it wyth egges / and bare it wyth hyr preuely vn∣der hyr oote to refresshe wyth that poure man whan she mette wyth him. She ca¦me to the place there that the poure ma dwellyd / and entred fyrst in to the chyrche there besyde for to praye. And whan she was entred / she bethought on our lord so Inwardly / and anoue her spiryte was rauysshed / soo that she was fully for that tyme wythdrawe from hyr outwarde wyttys / as it is rehersed afore. Whanne she was thus rauys¦shed / it happed sodeynly that the body bo∣wed to a pyler casuelly on that syde that the egges were on / so that she lened fully vpon the bagge wyth egges / thanne was ther in the same bagge for goten a fore a thymbyll as tayllours sowen wyth / the whiche thymbyll was broken in thre par¦tyes by burthon of hir body / but the eyren that charyte hyd there were hole & in noo partye broken. Now was thys a mer¦uayllous thyng that the eyren were hole / and the thymbyll of coper was to broke / so our lorde shewed there hys myracle in the charytable eyren. For our lord she¦wed his helpe not only by this holy may¦de to nedy folke / but also he shewed hys myracle in hyr by werkes of his godhede And for to declare the more openly / I shall tell you a meruaylles thyng / of whi¦che meruayll were wytnes bothe men and wōman aboute the nombre of xx of this maydens faders housholde Her moder Lapa tolde mayster Reymond hir dough¦ters confessour that after tyme hir dough¦ter thys holy mayde had leue of hyr fad to gyue almes. It befylle that the mey¦ne of the housholde had dronke amonges
them a certeyn vessell of wyne / so that the remenaūt the whiche was lefte was not fresshe for to gyue to poure men / in asmo¦che she had in custome to gyue them of the beste for goddes loue. She went hyr than to the next vessell of wyne there besyde in hyr faders seller / and tamed that for pou¦re folke And gaf them largely ther of euery day as they neded many dayes to gyder / and it was not aspyed of the mey¦ne. At the last whan the fyrst vessell was done / the boteler mynystred drynke to the meyne of the vessell the whyche the holy mayde had tamed. Yet the ho∣ly mayde left not therfore / but alwaye she gaue ther of to the poure folke / and ye mo¦re the meyne dronke / the more largely she gaue to poure folke / and it was not aspy¦ed / ne the wyne was neuer the vnfressher ne neuer the lasse in the vessell / but alle¦waye kepte his estate / bothe in fulnesse & in fresshenesse. Alle the meyne of the housholde gretely meruaylled ther of that the vessell contynued so long / and the wy¦ne was so good and so fresshe / for it was well knowe a fore / that suche a vessell of wyne myght not laste ouer xv dayes or xx dayes at the ferthest Neuerthelesse it contynued not onely xx dayes / but a full moneth complete And yet it semyd that the vessell was noo wyse lessened. All the meyne had meruayll ther of yt the wyne was so good & so fresshe & las∣tyd so long. For better wyne them se∣med they tastyd neuer It was vnkno¦we to them all how that myght be / but the holy mayde knewe well I nogh yt it was by myracle of our lord / by cause of the al¦mes that she gaue ther of the more large∣ly to the poure folke. And therfore she gaue ther of the more largely to pour fol¦ke openly that all the meyne myght see it and yet it semed neuer the lesse in the ves¦sell. O moneth was passyd & an other began to entre / & yet the wyne contynued euer lyke fresshe / & lyke full as it dyd fyr¦ste in to the tyme the grapes were rype for to make newe wyne. Whenne the ga¦pes were rype & vessellys were ordeyned for to be fylled wyth newe wyne / the may¦ster of the wyne bad & commaūded / that the vessell whiche cōtynued so long wyth olde wyne / sholde be emptyed and fyllyd with newe wyne One of the seruaūtes made ordynaūce for to empte that vessell by fyllyng of botellys / & yet it semed ne∣uer the lesse. Atte the laste the vessell was vndone for to be gawgid to knowe ther by what was lefte in the vessell / & it was founde all drye as though ther had no wyne be ther Inne many monthes a∣fore Thenne all the housholde were mo¦re amexuaylled of ye myracle thenne they were of the habundaunce of wyne afore. Loo maydens what myracle our lord shewed by gyuyng of almes dede of this holy mayde Katheryne / the whiche myra∣cle was openly afterward knowen in the Cyte of Sene Thus endeth this chapy¦tre. The wyttenesse of thys mater con¦teyned in thys chapytre ben rehersed in thys chapytre. ¶ Of meruayllous dedys whiche she dyd in lowely & besy seruyse to them that we∣re syke. Capitulum iiij THys holy mayde had a meruayl¦lous compassyon in hyr soule of poure folke and nedy But yet she hadde a more excellent & a more mer∣uayllous pyte of seke folk / for the whiche pyte that she hadde of them she wroughte many wonder thynges / whom I shall re∣rce
by the grace of god / for the more edy¦fycacyon of theym the whiche shall rede or here thys holy legende. And though it seme to somme incredyble / yet shall I not leue therfore. In the cyte of Sene ther was a full poure womman / and a syke that for nede and wantyng of temporall gooddes / she was constreyned to lygge in an hospytak in the same Cyte where she supposed to haue and fynde remedye of hyr syknes / that she myght not haue by hyr self / it happed thanne that she was receyued in to a poure hospytall of the sa∣me cyte / in the whiche hospytall vnnethe she myght haue that she nedyd Hyr sy¦kenesse encrecyd so hyghely that she was a lepre though out all hyr body / thenne all that euer were wyth Inne the hospy∣tall eshewed hir te more / and dysposed for that she sholde be sente to the spytellhous wythout the toune / the whyche was or∣deyned for lazaros and not for to abyde amonges them. Whanne thys holy may¦de perceyued thys / she wente full of chary¦te to the same hospytall / and vysyted the poure leprous womman / and mynystred to hyr not onely the substaunce of tempo¦rall gooddes / but also the helpe of hyr ow¦ne mynystracyon. For euery day on the morowe / and euery nyght at euen / she vysyted the same seek womman by hyr owne persone consyderyng in that same leprous womman hir spoust Jhesu with hyr ghoostly eye. And therfore she ser¦ued her to more besely / the more dylygente¦ly / and the more mekely / thys holy may∣de serued hyr the more prude and vnkyn¦de / the seek womman was ageynst hyr. For so ofte tymes it happeth in them that ben not meke / that the more meke∣nes ther is shewed to them / the more prou¦de they be. And there that they sholde thanke our lord for the kyndnes whiche is shewed to them / the shewe rather Iniu¦ryes and wronges / ryght so dyd thys se¦ke womman to this holy mayde whan she saw that she was serued soo customa¦bly euery day of thys holy mayde / she be¦gan to chyde hir whanne she was not ser¦ued to hyr plesaunce. It befyll other whyle that thys holy mayde was longe at the chyrche / and contynued somtyme longer thenne somtyme / and that was the cause ofte tyme why she was taryed fro that seek wōman And after whan she came late to the seek wōman / she wol¦de chyde hyr shappely / and sayde to hyr soornfully many suche heuy wordes. O lady quene welcome / where haue ye ben so longe lady quene / a now ye be a grete lady that so long haue ben at the frerys / haue ye talkyd I nough wyth the freres lady / wyth suche lyke wordes and many lyke these / she dyd what she coude to sty∣re thys holy mayde to wrath / yet was she not styred by hyr wordes / but rather ser¦ued hyr as she wolde hyr owne moder / & comforted hyr as lowely / and as mekely as she wolde hyr owne moder / seynge to hyr ryght thus O good moder / for god¦des loue be not dyspleased wyth me / for though I haue be longe I shall mende all thyng anone. Than she hyd hyr fast & made a fyre / and ordeyned besyly for hyr mete / and for all other necessaryes as she wolde for hyr owne moder / soo that the se¦ke womman in all hyr vnpacyence mer∣uaylled of hir pacyence Thys rebukyn¦ge contynued longe tyme / and yet was that holy mayde neuer wery of hyr seruy¦se / but rather contynued / many folk had meruayll therof. But hyr owne mod Lapa was gretely troubled wyth al and cryed vpon hyr that she sholde leue that minystracion lest she were a lepre as ye se¦ke womā was / & oftymes she sayd to hir
Doughter I wote well thou shalt be a le∣per yf thou contynue in seruyce of this se¦ke woman / and that may I not suffer / And therfore leue of I charge the / To whom this holy mayde excused her hones¦tely and sayde that she hadde it of oure lord that she sholde not leue the minystra¦cion of that poure woman / And soo she eed her moder / and she contynued forthe in her hooly mynystracion. Thenne the fende perceyued that she myght not bee ouercome by swete reuelyng / he tourned hym to another whyle by the suffraunce of oure lorde and made her hondes leper the whiche touched the lepers body of the seke woman in soo ferforth that euery bo¦dy yt sawe her sayd that she was a leper yet wold she not sece thefor but rather de¦sireth to be a leper than for to see of holy ministraciō / she despysed her owne body & rought neuer what befyll to her so that she mightserue our lord That lepers sekenes contynued vppon her many dayes / But her semed full fewe daye in comparyson of grete loue that she had¦de to our lord. That blessyd lord the whi¦che tournyd all thynge to god in his lo∣uers after tyme he consyderyd the ghoste¦ly strengthe of his spouse this holy may¦de: he wolde not suffer that the lepers sy∣kenes sholde longe endure in her / Wyth∣in a lytyll tyme afterward it happed by the dysposycyon of our lord that lepers woman sholde passe out of this worlde / Soo that in a tyme of her passynge this holy mayde was wyth her and comfor∣ted her besely and blessydly. ¶ Whan she was passed she wasshed de¦uotly that lepres body and arayed it to the berynge / And whan her dyryge and her masse was done / she beryed her wyth her owne hondes / And assone as she was buryed / the leper passed awaye fro her hondes as though she hadde neuer no ne sykenesse therof / But rather her hon¦des was more fayrer afterward thenne ony place of her body / as though she had¦de neuer be touched wyth ony spyce of le∣pre. See not ye maydens what encrece of vertue this hooly mayde wan by this dede of mercy / charyte the moder of vertu stererd her to doo that charytable dede of mercy and mekenesse conpeled with cha¦ryte the whiche made her to bee subiecte and seruaunt to the seke / And also pacy¦ence was conpeled wyth that charyte the whiche made her to suffre pacyently and gladly the seke wommans rebukynge: ¶ And yet ferthermore to this dede off charyte was knytte wythouten ony dou¦ghte sekernesse of clere faythe / By the whiche faythe she behelde euer her spouse Jhesu in her sowle as ofte as she mynys¦tred to that woman. ¶ And yet neuertheles she failed none hope, by the whiche she contynued to the laste ende in her holy mynystracyon. Af∣ter alle thyse hooly company of vertues folowed an open myracle in clensyng of that lepre by the dethe of this poure wo∣man the whiche she toke by her mynystra¦cyon. This is a gracious myracle and a merueylous yet sholde ye see and here a more merueylous thinge that folowed yf ye lysten / & here it besely / In the same Cyte of Gene there was a susters of pe∣naunce of Saynt Domynyk seke yt whi¦che was called after the maner of speche ī ye coūtre Palmaria / ye suster Palmaria was so gretely styred to hate by excyta∣cion of ye fende agaynst this holy mayde katheryn / yt as ofte as euer she sawe her or herd herd her speke or herd speke of her. she was hyghely troubylyd in her sowle soo ferforth that she shewed alle the toke¦nes of malyce agaynste her bothe in

perceyued this. she vnderstoode that oure lord had receyued that seke suster to her kepyng / Thenne anone she came to her that wyth a glad there she comforted her and she serued her gladly to the laste en¦de of her sekenes / that seke suster toke her seruyce the more freely in as moche as she consydered that all other forsoke her / this holy mayde lefte no thynge vndo yt was longyng to her seke suster encresyd neuer her abhomynable stynche neuer so moche / She stode by her and opened her wounde / wasshed it and wepte it / and coueryd it▪ and yet neuer she hyldeth she her nose for noo stynche ne shewed none token of lothsomnes / ne ne¦uer was heuy ne wroth of seruyce ne we¦ry about her. but gladli dyd her dilygēt seruyce / soo that her seke suster had mer∣ueyle of the grete stedfastenes / and of the grete sufferaunce and of the grete fulnes of loue and charyte that was in so yon¦ge a mayde / Of this grete loue and cha∣ryte that she shewed to that seke suster ye fende had grete enuye and was aboute to lette that dede of mercy and of charyte after his power. ¶ Fyrst vpon a daye as this holy may¦de was aboute to vnoouere her wounde for to wasshe it and wype it & to refreissh it agayn▪ there came out suche an odoure of stynche that vnnethe her stomake my∣ght suffer it: But almost she was brou∣ght to a vomyte. Assone as she percey∣ued that / she arose agaynst her self wyth an hyghe wrathe and sayde to her skey∣mons flesshe in this wyse whether ye wret¦ched flesshe haste abhomynacion now of thyn suster the whiche oure lorde boughte wyth his precious blode / yu mayste falle euery daye in ye same sykenesse that she is in or in verse: trewely thou shalt be pu¦nysshed therfore / Anone she bowed done to the sore and hyld her nose and her mou¦the open agaynst the wounde soo longe vnto the tyme she felt in her selfe that her skeymousnes was goo / and soo she ouer came the flesshe that was contrary to the spyryte / The seke suster behelde this and cryed to her merueylyng and sayde cece¦dere doughter corrupte not thy selfe wyth this foule stynkyng sore / ¶ This holy mayde for alle her cryenge wolde not aryse vp vnto the tyme she felt her enemye was ouercome and so she arose vp and he auoyded awaye fro her for a tyme / But he consyderyng that he myght not haue the maystry of her wro¦ught wylyly agaynst her by her seke sus¦ter / He put in her herte suche an heuenes agaynst this holy mayde that she lotheth her seruyce / and by lytyll and lytyll that malyce soo encresyd that lothenes was tourned in to an hate. For though she knewe well ynow that there was none that wolde serue her but she / But yet she scyd not of that pryuy hate but brake out agaynst her in to a suspycious glo∣sye. for that is the condycion of theym yt lyuen in hate euer lyghtely for to leue a suspycious thought of them that they ha¦te: And at the laste she began to ymage ne and bere her an honde that whan she was not present wyth her she was abou¦te somme actuell synne flesshely in som∣me other preuy places▪ ¶ Yet wold not this holy mayde neuer sce of her holy seruise aboute her notwith¦stondyng suspycious ymagynacions I put agaynst her / For she wel that wyle¦come by the deuyll and the more besy she was aboute her the more wrathfull was her seke suster agaynst her by exortacion and excitacion of the fende that euer ha∣ted the dedes of charite / In so moche that he steryd that seke suster to slander thys holi mayde openly of ye filthe of vnclen̄e
and that scland was so open / that at the last whanne that it came to hir susters he ryng / somme of the oldest / and of the sted fastest cam to thys seke suster for to knowe the trouthe Thanne the seek sus¦ter as she sdaūdred hyr a fore / ryght soo she contynued in the same sclaund to hir susters / accusyng hir full foule actuell vn¦clennesse Of the whiche foule accusacy on / thyse sustres were gretely a meruayl∣led and styred ageynst thys holy mayde / and so was called forthe a fore them / and sharpely rebuked wyth many repreuable wordes axyng of hir how she wold suffre hyr self so be deceyued for to lese hyr may¦denhode. To whome thys holy mayde answerd full pacyently and softely / seyn¦ge thus▪ Trewely ladyes and sustres by the grace of our lord Jhesu cryste / I am a mayde. And neuer wold she say other worde in blamyng of hyr that so had ac∣cused hyr / but onely thus. Trewely I am a mayde / trewely I am a mayde. Yet for all thys she cessyd neuer of hyr seruy∣se / all be it that it was full heuysom to hir for to here suche wordes & sclaundre But yet fyrst she serued hyr seek suster / and af¦terward went to hir chābe for to praye / for that was hyr most comforte in all su∣che dyseases. There she prayed in soule more thenne in wordes by mouthe / and yt was in thys wyse. O almyghty god & my dere beloued spouse / thou knowest well that the name of maydes is tender / and lyghtly for to catche sclaundre / & na∣mely of suche maydens that haue chosen the to be their spouse / and that was ye cau¦se why that thou woldest / that thy glory∣ous moder our lady Saynt Mary / was commytted to Joseph / that was called & spoused hyr husbond for to kepe hyr na∣me of virgynyte wythout sclaunder Thou knowest lord that alle thys sclaundre / the whiche is putte vpon me is come by the fende he fader of esynges / by cause I sholde cesse of the besynes the whiche I ha¦ue begonne for thy loue. Therfore lord I praye the helpe me / that knowest well I am gylteles / and suffre not thys wycked enemye the whiche was ouert rowe by thy passyon to haue the maystrye of me. Whanne she hadde prayed thus longe to our lord wepyng plenteuously. Ou¦re lorde appyred to hyr as she knowele∣chyd afterward in confessyon to hyr con¦fessour mayster Reymond. Holdyng in his ryght honde a golden crowne arayed with precyous margaryte stonys. And in hys lyfte honde a garlonde of sharpe thornes / seyng to hyr in thys wyse De¦re doughter it is nedefull yt thou be crow∣ned wyth owne of thyse two crownes / & therfore chese whether thou hast leuer haue of thys two. Chse now whether thou haddest leuer be crowned wyth the shape crowne of thorne in thys ly / and that o∣ther to be reserued to the in euer lastyng lyf. Or ellys for to haue this precyous crowne. & for to haue ye other after thys lyfe. Thenne thys holy mayde sayde. Lord thou knowest well that I haue forsake myn owne wylle / and chosen for to do after thy blyssed wyll / therfore I da∣re not chese no maner thyng wythout thy plesaunt wyll. Neuerthelesse by cause thou wylte that I shall answer I say thus that I chese rather in thys lyf euer to be cō¦fourmed to thy blessyd passyon / and soo for to suffre peynes for thy loue. After thyse wordes anone she toke of our lordes hondes the garland of thornes feruently and put it myghtely vpon hyr hede wyth a maner ef vyolence / that the thornys per¦cyd hir hede rounde about / as hir thought in so moche that she had a peyne long af∣terward in hyr hede by prykynge of the thornys / as she recorded hir self openly to mayster Reymond hyr confessour. Than
sayd our ford to hyr thus / in my poure is al thyng / and as I haue suffred this sclaū¦der to be areysed / ryght so it is in my po∣wer to cesse it. Therfore thou shalt con¦tynue in that holy seruyse as thou hast be gonne / & gyue no stede to the sende that wold let the / I shall gyue the full vntorye of thyne enemye / that what that euer he hath Imagyned ageynst the it shall torne to hys owne hede for thy more ioye / and hys more peyne. Thus was thys holy mayde comforted / and soo bode stylle in that holy seruyse. But whanne thys sclaundre cam to hyr moder Lapa / all be it yt she was seker ynough of hyr dough∣ter / she was gretely styred by thys sclaun¦der & sayd to hyr wyth myghty spyryte in thys wyse Doughter haue I not oft sayd to the / that thou sholdest nomore ser∣ue that stynkyng woman / loo what re∣ward she hath gyue the for thy besye seruy¦se She hath sclaundred the full foule to all thy sustres / yf thou euer serue hyr mo∣re or come to hyr / neuer shall I calle ne na¦me the my doughter afterward / ne thou me thy moder. Now was this the soty lest wyll of all. For ther the fende myght not haue the maystrye of hir by sclaunde ryng of hyr seek suster / he beganne wyth a maner of pyte to lette hyr of hyr holy seruyse by hyr moders mouthe. Then∣ne was thys holy mayde astonyed som∣what for hir moders wordes. And at the last she wente to hyr and knelyd afo∣re hyr seynge to hyr thus. Swete mo∣der whether our lorde wolde be pleased yf we leue vndone the dedys of mercy to our negyhbours for theyr vnkyndenes. Whether our sauyour lefte to raunsom vs by suffryng deth on the crosse for the re¦prouyng wordes and obloquye of men. God knoweth moder & your charyte al∣so yf I lefte thys seek suster / & wolde do hir no seruyse / there wolde none do hir ser¦uyse. And so she shold deye for defau. Sholde we be cause and occasyon of hyr deth / she is now a lytell deceyued of ye fen¦de / perauenture here afterward our lorde wyll gyue hyr grace for to knowe hyr trespas. By suche wordes & lyke to thise / at the laste she wan hyr moders blessyng / and wente to the seek suster a∣geyn and serued hir so gladly as though she had neuer sayd euyll of hyr. These ke suster was than astonyed / and percey¦ued thenne that she had do amysse / and beganne to haue sorowe & contrycyon in hyr herte of hir sclaunder that she had put vpon hir. Thenne our lord shewed mer¦cy to hyr. And for to make the good fame of hys mayde / he shewed that seek suster in a tyme / as she laye in hyr bedde a gracious vysyon / that he wouchesauf to shewe to thys holy mayde vpon a daye / whanne thys holy mayde wente to hyr / chambre after hyr seruyse that she had do to that seek suster. That same seek sus¦ter sawe as she laye in hyr bedde aboute the holy mayde a grete lyght comyng don from heuen / of so grete mirthe & swetenes that it made hyr for to forgete vtterly all hyr dyseases / what thys myght mene cle¦rely she wyst neuer / but she loked aboute here and there. And behelde the maydes face transformed or trāsfygured / that hyr semed that she was not thenne Katheryn Lapais doughter / but rather lyke to an heuenly creature gloryfyed / & that lyghte beclypped hyr rounde aboute. And the more she behelde hyr / the more she yelde hir self gylty in hyr sowle to our lorde / of the sclaunder that she putt vpon that holy mayde. Whanne thys vysyon hadde tary a whyle the whiche appyred to the bodely eyen of that seek suster / as it came so it passyd awaye / after the whiche pas∣syng
the seek suster was long after com¦forted / and also sorowfull for her trespas And anone she axed mercy of the ho∣ly mayde wyth sobbyng terys that she had so wyckedly trespassyd ageynst hyr / and sclaundred hyr full falsely. Loo maydens by that outward lyght / our lor¦de gaf hyr an Inward lyght / for to kno∣we how falsely she was deceyued by the fende. Anone forthwyth whanne this holy mayde herde how mekely she axed forgyuenes. She wente to hyr mekely and took hyr in her armes and kyssed hyr / seyng to hyr thus full comfortably. Dere moder I am not dysplesed wyth you in no wyse / for I wote well it was the fendes malyce / and not youres / but I thanke yon wyth all my herte / for ye lo∣ue me in that ye wolde I were kept clene And therfore I wyte you no thyng of all thys / but the fende that hath wrought all this so malyciously ageynst me / wyth su¦che wordes and lyke thyse. Thys holy mayde comforted hyr seek suster and dyd hyr seruyse as she was wonte to do / and whan she had do / leste she shold haue spen¦de hyr tyme in vayne / she wente to hyr chambre and occupyed hyr in prayer. In the mene tyme that the seek su ste knowleched hir gylty with wepyng and waylyng afore all thoo that came to hyr and sayd openly afore theym alle that by dysceyte of the fende / she sclaundred ye holy mayde wrongfully. And she axed forgyuenes of hem alle. For she sayde that she knewe well ynough yt this may∣de was not onely pure and clene from flesshely synnes / but also she was holy and fulfylled wyth the holy ghoost / and that she knewe well. Thenne somme of the saddest of hyr susters axyd hyr pry¦uely and wysely how she knewe that the mayde was holy / and what tokens she hadde therof. She answerd stedfastly wyth a feruent spyryt that she knewe ne¦uer afore what was swetnesse of the sou¦le and ghoostly comfort vnto the tyme she sawe thys holy mayde afore hyr transfy¦gured or transformed & ouercouered with an vnspekable lyght. Eftesones then∣ne hyr susters axyd hyr / whether she saw that syght wyth hyr bodely eyen. But she coude not telle it wyth noo thyng the fayrenes of that lyght / and the swetnesse that she felte in hyr sowle for that tyme. Thenne ye holy maydens name began to encreace vertuously ouer all / for there the fende was aboute to dysceyue / and to hynder hyr name / there the holy ghoost en¦hauncyd hyr name vertuously. But in all thys ryght as she was neuer the son∣ner throwe doun by an euyll fame / ryght so she was neuer the more enhauncyd in hir self by elacyon for suche a good name She contynued euer forthe in hyr holy seruyse and dyd hyr besynesse / euer for to knowe hyr self that she was nought / but yet hyr ghoostly enemy the fende cessyd neuer for to lette hyr / eftesones he temp∣ted hir in hir holy minystracion by squey mousnes of the stomake. In a tyme whanne thys holy mayde wesshyd hyr seek susters horryble wounde / there cam suche a sauour out therof that she was in poynte to caste out all that was in hyr bo¦dy. Thenne she rose ageynst hyr self & so moche the more vyolently that she had the vyctorye of another temptacyon by the grace of the holy ghoost / and sayde to hir self thus Trewly wretche thou that hast so moche abhomynacyon thou shalte receyue it wythin the. Anone she toke all the wesshyng of that wounde / with the matter & fylthe and went asyde / and drā¦ke it of preuely / whanne she hadde so do all hir tēptacyon of abhominacion cessyd
This was tolde afterward to mayster Reymond hyr confessour in hir presence to whome she addyd & sayd pryuely / that srthn she was borne in thys worlde / she etc neuer ne dranke so swete ne so good a sauour of noo maner mete ne drynke. After thys gloryous vyctorye that sa¦me nyght suyng our lord Jhesu cryst / ap¦pyred to that holy mayde / shewyng to hir hys fyue blessyd woundes / the whiche he suffred for our helthe and sayd thus De re doughter many bateylles thou hast o∣uerpassyd for me & by my helpe thou hast oue coome them / yet hyther to / for the whi∣che vyctoryes thou art to me ryght welco¦me / but specyally yester day thou plesyst me gretely in that / that yu dyspysedest thy∣ne owne nature & kinde for my loue thou receyuest a drynke the whiche was abho¦mynable and dedely. Therfore ryght as in that thou passst thy kynde and thy nature Ryght so shall I gyue yu a dryn¦ke that passyth the custome and the kyn∣de of man Wyth that he helde hys arme of her necke & brought hyr mouth to hys blessyd wounde in hys syde / and sayd to hi thus. Drynke doughter out of my y  the drynke of helthe / by ye whiche thy soule shall be fulfylled wyth so moche swe¦tenesse that it shall boūde in to thy body the whiche thou hast so meruayllously de∣spysed for my loue. Thenne thys holy mayde sowked out of the pype of lyf co∣myng out of hys blessyd wounde wyth hyr mouth of hyr bodye / but moche more wyth the mouth of hyr sowle / longe tyme to gyder full plentuouly an vnspekable drynke of euer lastyng helthe. At the lost by the ordynaunce of our lord she ces¦syd and yet thursty not withstondyng she had ynough. Now maydens I praye you consydereth mekely thys vertues ac∣te of thys blessyd mayde. Beholdeth I beseche you the rote of hir charyte / where with she was moeued to take vpon hit fo¦lowely a seruyse for to serue seek folke▪ Also beholdeth how long she contynu∣ed in that seruyse / not wythseondyng the grete lettyng that she had by abhomyna∣cyon of nature. Behelde also the grete stedfastenes that she hadde in abydyng not wythstondyng the foule sclandres the whiche were put vpon hyr / and at the last she beholde a notable cōclusyon / how af¦ter tyme she hadde receyued that holsom drynke out of our lordes syde. She was fulfylled wyth so moche habundaunce of grace that she etc neuer ne myght etc af∣terward in suche a wyse as she dyd afore as it shall be declared more clerely wythin forthe. For as touchyng this chapytre I shall make an ende There is no thyn ge wryten ne reherced in thys chapytre / but suche as mayster Reymond thys ho∣ly maydes confessour knewe it out hyr by confessyon of hyr / or as he founde by wrytyng of hyr confessour that was afo¦re him / or of certeyn of hir sustres / the whi¦che were trewe & sadde of leuyng. ¶ Of hyr synguler maner of lyuyng / & how they were dysceyued / that grutched wyth hyr meruayllous fastyng. Ca V AFter tyme our lord Jhesu the en¦deles spouse of thys holy mayde had proued hir in the ouen of ma¦nyfolde trybulacyons / & also had taught hyr to ouercome hyr ghostly enemy ye fen¦de by dyuers bateyll / it were ryght seme∣ly yt he shold reward hyr in thys lyf wyth somme specyall gyfte of grace But by cause that soules as longe as they ben in the body may not fully receyue the fruyte of vertue / as it is had in blysse endelesly Therfore it is full nedefull as for the
fulfyllyng of the dyuyne prouydence of our lord that euery chosen spouse of hys in erthe shold yet dwelle in erthe / & neuer∣thelesse yet shall be endowed with som spe¦cyal reward of mede for this cause / it was that our sauyour wouchesauf to begynne in his spouse & in his handemayde Kathe¦ryne / this wretched lyf a maner of an he∣uenly lyuyng. And wyth that maner of lyuyng he wolde assocye hyr to erthely folke Therfore whiche suche a maner of re¦uelacyon he enfourmed hyr. It be fyll in a tyme that this holy mayde prayed in hyr chambre / where our lord apperyd to hyr & sayd in this wyse / wete ryght well dere beloued doughter that thyne abydyn¦ge in erthe shalbe fulfylled with so many meruayllous gyftes of my grace / that it shall be cause of studieng & Incredulyte to many mannes hertes / & specyally to fles∣shely mēnys hertes / that knowen not the maner of my gracyous gyftes. And also many that louen the / they shall be in thought and suppose that my passyng lo¦ue the whiche werche in yt shold be dyscey∣te For I shall gyue so grete habundaū∣ce of grace in thyn sowle / that it shall mer¦uayllously rebounde in to thy body / by the whiche thy body shall receyue and haue a meruayllous maner of lyuyng / the whi∣che hath selde be herde afore Ferthermo¦re thyn herte shall be soo gretely kyndelyd to helthe of soules / that thou shalt forgete in maner thyn owne kynde & chaunge al¦thy fyrst conuersacyon. For thou shalt not eshewe & shun the company of men and wommen as thou were wonte to do but rather for theyr soule helthe thou shalt put the to all maner of laboure to thy po∣wer and myght. Of thys maner of ly¦uyng many one shold be sclaundred / and so of many thou shalt be ageyn sayd that the thoughtes ef theyr hertys may be kno¦wen by theyr wordes / but loke thou be in no wyse aferde ne troubled / for I shall e∣uer be wyth the & delyuer thy sowle from treucherons tonges and lyers. Therfo¦re werke myghtely that the holy ghoost shall teche ye / for by yt I shall delyuere mā¦nes sowle out of the fendes power / and by mediacion of my specyall grace I shal¦lede them to heuen. Whanne our lorde had sayd thyse wordes / and often tymes had rehersed to hyr the same comfortably as touchyng that poynte. Where our lord sayd to hyr that she sholde not be a ferde¦ne troubled She answerd as she bekne¦we afterward in contessyon Thou at my lord & my god / and I thy wretched ser¦uaunt / euer more thy wyll be done / but ha¦ue mynde of me good lorde god after thy grete mercy & helpe me / and thus vanys∣shed & cessyd this vysyon. Thys holy mayde bethought hyr & kepte well in hyr herte wha this gracyous chaūgyng shol¦de be in tyme comyng. Fro that tyme af∣terward fro day to day / the grace of oure lord Jhesu encreced in hyr herte / & the holy ghost habounded in hyr so moche / that she hyr self was astoned therof / & wext feble in body & sayd as the propheet sayd thyse wordes Deficit caro mea et corpus me um deus cordis mei et {per}s mea deus ine∣tenū That is my body & my flesshe se¦bled & deailleth / but good lord by ye gouernour of myn herte & my parte wythouten¦ende And eftesones she sayd as the same {pro}pheet sayd in another place. Memor fui dei et drlectata sum & exercitata sum / et deficit spiritus meus That is I haue mynde of my lord god / & haue therin grete delyte / & I haūce me in ye ghostly delyte / & therfore my spyrytes & strengthes of my body wexen feble and defayllen This mayde wext seek in body for the loue of our lord / and hir sekenes had no remedy but by weping & waylyng / & therfore she wept & wayled euery day / & yet by suche
wepyng and waylyng she myght not so cour hyr sekenes Than our lord put in hyr herte that it sholde be good for hyr as for a souereyn cemedye to hir sekenes oft tymes to be housled / that so she myght re∣ceyue that lord yt she loued / by sacrement of the autre. Of whom she myght not yet be fulfylled fully in thys lyf / as she shold be in heuen blysse And netheles yt was cause of more loue & encrece of gretter se∣kenes. But yet for a tyme it made satys faccyon by the vertue of the feyth to ye ser yse of hyr charyte / that brenned conty∣nuelly in hyr herte by in sufflacyon of the holy ghoost. After tyme she had in cus¦tome to be comuned & houseled as it we∣re euery day / all be it though she were oft tymes lette by sekenes of body / and soo for besynes that she had of mennes soules She had suche a desyre ofte for to be house led / that but yf she were hyr body sholde su grete peyne / & in maner it sholde fe¦ble & defayll & right as the body had par¦ of the haboundaunce of the spyryte by affluence that haboūded fro wythin forth Ryght so it myght not be but yf it had be pereyner of the anguysshe & dysease that the spyryt suffred Thys mater shall be de dad more largely by the helpe of god af¦terward. For now I shall tell you of the meruayllous lyuyng / yt she leued as touchyng hyr body / mayster Reymond recordeth thus of this holy mayde / as he knewe well by hyr confessyon & also by wrytyng of hyr confessour afore hym / yt after tyme she was vysyted by ye forsayd vysyon / she had so moche plente of graces & ghoostly comfortes / and namely whan she had receyued our lord Jhesu in ye bles¦syd sacrement of the autre / that it reboun∣dyd in to hyr body by a copyous affluen¦ce / that the kyndly consumpcyon of dy∣gestyon in hyr body had no place / but it chaūgyd so the kynde of hir stomake that the receyuyng of mete was not now ned full to hyr / for she myght not receyue me∣te wythout grete torment of the body / & yf she shold algates te hir body suffred ry∣ght gret peyne / for it myght haue no kyn¦dely dygestion / but nedys it must by vyo¦lence come out ageyne yt she etc ther that it went June. It is not lefull to wryte wyth a penne how ofte & how many pey∣nes this holy mayde suffred for receyuyn¦ge of bodely metes This maner kynde or condycyon of lyuyng in the begynnyng was to many folke / bothe to them of the houshold & to other that were conuersaunt wyth hyr so Incredyble that they named this synguler gyfte of god eyther a temp tacyon or ellys a sottyll dysceyte of the deuyll. In to this errour fyll mayster Reymond hyr confessour as other dyd yt wende she had be disceyued of hyr enemy ye whiche oftymes transfygured hym self to an aungell of lyght for to deceyue sou∣les▪ And therfore he bad hyr etc hir mete euery day / & gyue no credens to suche des¦ceyuable vysyons that wold lett hyr fro hyr mete. Thenne sayd this holy may de to hyr confessour that she founde well by experyence yt she was more hole in bo∣dy whan she receyued no bodely mete / thā whanne she receyued it. Yet for all suche excusacyons he wold not cesse of his pre¦cepte / but badde & commaunded hir yt she shold ete. Thenne she as a trewe doughter of obedyēce obeyed to his byddyng / & ete hir mete vnto ye tyme bi sekenes she was almost dede. Thenne she called hyr confes∣sour mayster Reymond and sayd to him thus. Fader yf I be to moche fastyng we∣re I cause of myn one deth / were I a sleer of myn one body / he answered & sayd yes Thenne she askyd eftesones whether it be grete synne to be dede bi etyng or by absti¦nence / he sayd by etyng.

In suche maner of wyse this holi mayde ans¦werd whan she was I asked why she e∣te not as other dyde / all be it that she ans¦werd in other termes I coueryd with me¦kenes / whan she was asked why she e∣te not as other dyde / She sayde that oure lorde hadde smyte her for her synnes by a synguler passyon of infirmytes: whe∣refor she was let to ete her mete as other dyde: Gladly she sayd that she sholde ete but she myght not / therfore she sayde I praye you pray for me / that he vouchesaf to forgyue me myn sinnes wherfor I suf¦fer all thyse sykenesses / As though she hadde sayd thus / god doth this in me & not I in myn self / And also less ony maner of spyce of pryde sholde appyre in her euer she sayde she suffred that infir¦myte for her synnes: And yet she sayde not agaynst conscien¦ce: for she supposed stedfastely that oure lorst hadde suffred her to falle in to the grutchynge of men for to punysshe her synnes / For what maner of euyll be fyll to her / She wyted it her synnes and what good that euer was wrought in her she put it to oure lord / ¶ This same sentence is a good ans∣were to the thrydde preuy bacbyters that sayden and euer conseylde to other for to be ware of the ende of suche synguler fas¦tyng / For the ende muste nedes be vyci∣ous the whiche is not of god / How may the ende of this holy maydes fastyng bee vycious the whiche come of god and not of her self as it is clerly declared afore / Also there that they sayde that she was dysceyued of the fende / how may that be that soo ofte ouercome the dysceytes of ye fende / But now I sette caas that she myght so be dysceyued of the fende what was he than that helde and kepte her bo∣dy in suche kyndely strengthe perauentu¦re they wolde saye the fend. Then̄e wolde I wett yf he kepte her soule in suche gho¦stely gladnes and peas / sythe it soo was depreuyd fro all maner symple delyte or delectacion / This fruyte of the holy ghost may not be in none deuyll ys power to gyue: for ye appostle sayth yt the fruyt off ye holy gost is charyte / ioye & peas I wol¦de not suppose yt all this shold be directed to ye fende / Therfore all suche sclaūders & bacbyters of vertu shold be answerd ra¦ther by silence than by word / Euery vir¦tuons man shold eschewe them & suppo¦se yt they ben vnwurthy to haue an ans∣were / This holy mayde dyd what she cou¦de euery daye to stoppe her mouthes lest they sholde be sclaūdred in her / In that yt she came to mete euery day to ye meyne of ye houshold therbi for to know whether
she myght or not as other dyde / And yet otherwhyle she wolde assaye for to ete / & it was soo grete payne to her that alle yt sawe her hadde compassyon of her / For her stomake myght not defye her mete & the kyndly consumpcion of naturall dy¦gestyon had none vse in her: But alle yt entryd in her in to the stomake come out agayn by the same waye there it wente in / This caused in her many dyuerse pas¦syons / For all be it that this holy mayde receyued not in her stomak ony mete the whiche was mete wurthy as for that ty∣me: yet she spet out fro her grete mater off flewme as other folke dyde the whiche myght not bee by nature: But yf the sto¦make hadde receyued somme substaunce afore / and thrfoere our lord wrought mer¦ueylously in her aboue nature / Also as for drynkynking of colde water she recei¦ued it gladly to refresshe her chykes and her throte: This maner of lyf she lyued vnto her I aste ende for grutchers and for theym that were slaundred by her fastin¦ge / Her confessour Mayster Reymound perceyued how grete peyne she suffred by vndygestyon of her stomake and all for to stoppe grutchers / he conforted her for cō¦passyon that he hadde vppon her that she sholde leue and ete nomore rather than for to suffre suche a payne / And lete theymgrutche ynow To whom she answerd smylyngly fader is better for meto suffrein this lyfefor my syn̄es thanne for to suffre payne endelesly / Her grutchyng is to me profyta∣ble by cause I shall be delyuerd of pay∣ne wythouten ende for the payne that I suffre in this lyf sholde I fle the ryght∣wysnes of god / Nay god forbede it oure lord doth to me grete grace by cause he gi¦ueth me myn payne in this lyf / Soo her confessour coude nomore answe¦re to her but helde his peas in this / wyse ¶ Of alle her enemyes she had the mai∣stry what soo in maner of the fende and of grutchers / & so she taughte other to do euery daye: So yt in a tyme whan she co¦mynyd wyth her confessour of the gra∣cious gyftes of our lord / She sayd who soo coude vse the grace of oure lorde He sholde euer haue the vyctorye of all thynges that fallen to hym / And then̄e she tourned to her confessour and sayde to hym. soo I wolde that ye dyde as ofte as ony newe thynge byfalleth to you be it prosperyte or aduersyte thynketh with in your self and sayth ofte this / I wyll wanne somwhat and ye doo soo ye sholde soone be ryche in vertu. ¶ Loo maydens haue mynde of thys∣notable doctryne for thus I make an ende of this chapytre / The wytnes of all thynges. the whiche ben wryte therin / Is this holy mayde eyther by her opyn dedes or ellis by her wordes. And also her confessour the whiche was a fore mai¦ster Reymound. ¶ Of the wounderfull rauysshyng and excesse of her mynde for her bodely wyt∣tees / And of grete reuelacions I shewed to her of oure lorde / Capitulum vj rIght as oure lorde graunted to his spouse this holy mayde a syn¦guler lyuyng as touchyng her bo¦dy▪ ryght soo he vysyted her soule wyth grete merueylous confortes of reuelaci¦ons / Fyrst for the grete haboūdant gra¦ces with her come that bodely strengthe yt she had aboute kynde. Wete ye right wel yt fro the tyme that this holy mayde had I dronke of oure lordes syde the drynke
of lyf as it is rehersid a fo / many grete graces were haboūdant ī her yt ofte times & ofte times as it had be in maner conty¦nuabyl / She was occupyed in actuell cō¦templacion and her spyryte was lowyd to our lord that for the more parte she by lefte wythout felyng in her bodely wyt∣tes / Soo that as it is rehersed in the fyrst party her armes were founde ofte times soo styf in tyme of suche actuell contem∣placion that rather they sholde breke thē∣ne bowe / Her eyen were all closed her e∣res herde none noyse were it neuer so gre¦te and her bodely wyttes for that tyme were sequestred fro her owne werkynge ¶ This sholde be none merueyle to no∣man yf they wolde take hede to yt syweth Oure lorde began to bee soo homely with her and brennyd her sowle wyth soo mo∣che haboundante fyre of loue not oonly in pryuy places / but also in open places as well stondyng as goyng / that she the whiche hadde thyse grete graces by kne∣we it playnely to her confessour she cou∣de fynde none wordes for to telle expres∣sely the grace that she felte / ¶ For in a tyme whan she prayed to oure lord feruentely wyth the Prophete Dauyd seyeng deuoutly thyse wordes / ¶ Cor meum crea in me deus / et spiritū rectum innoua in visceribus meis / That is prayng our lorde specially that he wolde take awaye her herte & her owne wyll and gyue her a newe herte after his wyll / She hadde suche a comforte that her semed that our lord Jhesu come to her and opened her lyft side and toke out her herte and went his waye: and belyfte her with out her owne herte: ¶ Afterward it befyll that she commy∣nyd wyth her confessour / and amonges all thynges she sayde that she had none herte in her body / the whiche wordes her cō¦fessour srned her in a maner and bla∣med her for she sayde soo / Thenne she re∣hersed eftsones and confermed her wor∣des trewely fader as moche as I maye fele / yet after the felyng of myn body me semeth I lacke myn herte for oure lorde apperyd to me and opened myn leste sy¦de and toke out myn herte and went his way / Thenne the confessour sayde that it was vnpossyble that she shold lyue with out an herte. she sayde naye there is no∣thynge vnpossyble to god. And therfo∣re she bad hym gyue credens that it is so For ofte tymes after ward she rehersed that she lyued without herte with in a fewe dayes afterward it befyll that she wente to a chapell of the fryers where susters of penaunce were wonte to kne∣le / And whan all were goo home it befil that she contynued in her prayers so that she was fro her self by rauysshyng and at the laste she awoke of her rauysshyng and went homward / And as she wente by the waye sodenly a lyght of heuen bi¦cliped her: And in that lyght aperyd our lord holdyng in his honde a reed shining herte in lykenes of a mannys herte / At the commyng of thys heuenly lyght she was aferde that she fyll doune vppon the grounde / Thenne came our lorde to her & openyd her lyftesyde eftsones and pute in her body that herte the whiche he hylde in his hondes seyng to her thus / ¶ Loo dere doughter as I toke awaye thyn herte the laste daye / ryght soo now I giue the myn herte wherby thou mayst lyue endelesly: & whan he hadde so doo he closed the wounde agayn that he made open in the flesshe / Neuerthelesse there by left a merueylous marke in the lykenes of a woūde heled in the same place euer afterward / where as her felawes tolde her confessour Mayster Reymound for ofte tymes they sawe it as she coude not forsake it to hym whan he askid it of her
whether it were soo or not. Out of that meruayllous gracyous herte that was so I gyuen hyr of our lord came out many meruayllous werkys And yet many moo meruayllous reuelacyons haboun∣deth wythin forth. She came neuer af∣terward for to be hoseled / but that ther was shewed to hyr many synguler gyf∣tes of grace. Oft tymes she sawe a ly¦tell chylde in the prestys handys / and o∣ther whyle a well growen chylde / & other whyle an hote brennyng ouen of fyre. And whan the preste receyued that blys∣sed sacrament / it semed to hyr that the fy∣re entred in to hym. But whan she shold be houseled ofte tymes she tastyd so grete an odour of that blyssed sacrament that almost hyr body defaylled. Euermore also whether she sawe or receyued ye blys∣sed sacrament She receyued with all a ne¦we ioye in hir soule / so that many tymes she sholde daunce in hir body for ioye / ma¦kyng a noyse that hyr felawes myght here hyr / the whiche tolde it afterward to hyr confessour / and he enquyred the trou∣the whether it were so / and founde it trewe and soo wrote it for a perpetuell recorde. That sowne and that noyse was not lyke other maner comyn sownes of men / but as it hadde be a noyse aboue comyn cours of kynde what meruayll was that though she made a ioyfull noyse aboue kynde. Syth it so was that she hadde re∣ceyued an herte aboue kynde For after ty¦me that she hadde receyued that newe her∣te as it is rehersed afore / she semed that she was not the same that she was afore / & ofte tymes she sayd to hyr confessour. See ye not fader that I am not the sa∣me that I was afore / but rather chaūged in to another persone. O wolde god fa∣der ye knewe that I fele / for I trewe very¦ly yf a creatour knewe that I fele in my sowle / he sholde be resolued & made ryght esye were he neuer so harde. For my sow∣le is full of melodye and ioye. And it is meruayll to me how it may abyde in the body. There is also grete hote bren∣nyng of dyuyne loue therin / that thys outward materyall fyre semeth me in cō∣paryson of that fyre rather colde than ho∣te. Also of that ghoostly hote is kynde led in my sowle as me semeth soo grete a loue of my neghbours that my thynketh I myght gladdely suffre for them bodely deth wyth grete ioye. And ouermore out of that ghoostly hote is come to my soule a renewyng of purytee and mekenes / in so moche that me semeth I am brought to the same purytee and mekenes / that a chylde of foure or a fyue yere age is Inne All this she tolde to hir confessour pre¦uely and to none other. After tyme that thys holy mayde was thus fulfylled in hyr sowle of suche plente of newe gracys that were many notable vysyons she∣wed to hyr / of whom somme I shall reher∣ce by the grace of god. ¶ Fyrste our lord Jhesu & hys blessyd Moder and Marye magdalene appyred to gydres to hir and comforted hyr in hir holy purpose / whome our lord axed and sayd. Doughter what desyrest thou / She wyth wepyng chere answerd & sayd Lorde thou knowest what me nedeth better than I / for I haue no wyll but thy¦ne / ne none herte but thyn hert. Thenne came to hyr mynde how Marye magda∣lene commytted hyr self fully to our lorde whan she satte & wepte at his fete. Wyth that she felte the same swetenesse of loue that Marye magdalene felte that tyme whan she wepte. Wherfore she behelde Ma¦rye magdalene. Our lord {per}ceyued that and for to fulfyll hyr desyre he sayd. Loo dere doughter for thy more solace and cō∣forte
I gyue the Marye magdalene to be thy moder. To whome thou mayst truste∣ly go to and be comforted / for to hir specy¦ally I commytte thy gouernaunce For this grete gyfte this holy mayde thanked our lord wyth gpete mekenes & reuerent¦ly & deuoutly she comended hyr ghoostly gouernaunce to Marye magdalene pra∣yng hyr that she wolde wouchesauf to ta¦ke hyr vnder gouernaunce. Syth our lord had specyally commytted hyr to her. Fro that houre euer afterward the ho∣ly mayde called Marye magdalene hyr moder / the whiche was not doo wythout grete mysterye as me semeth. for as Ma¦rye magdalene lyued xxxiij yere in a o¦che wythout bodely mete / and all that ty∣me was I occupyed in comtemplacyon. Ryght so this holy mayde fro that ty∣me that she was endowed wyth these ne∣we graces vnto the age of xxxiij yere af¦terward / whiche yere she passyd out of thys worlde. She was so occupyed in dyuyne contemplacyon that she hadde ne¦uer nede all ye tyme of bodely mete And yet as Marye magdalene was take vp in to the ayre by aungels seuen tymes in the day / where she herde the pryuetees of god Ryght so this holy mayde for the mo¦re partye all hir yeres she was rauysshed fro hyr bodely wyttes by strengthe of the sowle that was occupyed in contempla∣cyon of heuenly thynges / and so praysed our lord wyth aungels / in so moche that often tymes hyr body was lyfte vp in to the ayre / of the whiche many men & wom¦men that sawe hyr for that tyme bare re∣corde Ouermore in that rauyssheng she sawe many meruayllous thynges & spa¦ke preuely in tyme of hyr rauysshyng many hygh wordes of contemplacion / of the whiche som I shall tell you afterward Hyr confessour saw hyr ones in a tyme rauysshed fro hyr bodely wyttes in the sa¦me wyse as it is rehersed afore / and he her¦de hyr speke preuely / thenne he came nere for to lysten clerely what she sayd / and he herde that she sayd formably thyse wordes in latyn. Vidi archana dei. And that was sayd often tymes / other wordes say¦de she none but thoo Whanne she was restoryd ageyne to hyr bodely wyttes / she cessyd not to reherse these same wordes cō¦tynuelly / and it is nomore for to say / but I haue seen the pryuetres of god. Then¦ne hyr confessour desyryng for to knowe why she rehersed tho wordes so ofte / axyd hyr in thys maner of wyse. Good mo∣der why rehersed ye soo ofte the wordes & wyll not tell me what ye mene as ye we¦re wonte to do. She answerde I may not say none other wyse. Hyr confes∣sour axed hyr why / and what is the cau∣se / ye were wont to declare me many thin¦ges that our lord hadde shewed to you / why wyll ye not do so now / thēne she say¦de.

As mayster Reymond hyr last confes∣sour bereth recorde. In a tyme thys ho¦ly mayde came to the Cyte of Pyse / and other many wyth hyr / amonges whome mayster Reymond was one the whyche holy mayde was receyued in to a worthy mannes place of the same Cyte besyde a chappell of Saynt Crystyane. In the whyche chappell mayster Reymond say∣de masse at the holy maydes prayer / and ther he houseled hyr after hyr desyre / as she vsed to be contynuelly whanne she hadde receyued that blyssed sacramente she was anone rauysshed fro hyr bodely wyttes / and all that tyme mayster Rey∣mond and other moo abode tyll she hadde do / for to here of hyr somme ghoostly com¦forte as they were wonte to do after suche rauyssheng.

Thenne sodeynly whyle she sayde thyse wordes er thenne thoo rede bemys were fully come doune to the body changed hir colours out of rede in to a meruayllous bryghtnesse / and in lykenes of a pure lyght they restyd in fyue placed of my bo¦dy / that is vpon the hondes / the feet / and the herte. Thenne mayster Reymond axed hir whe¦ther ony of the bemys come to the ryghte syde. She sayde nay / but onely vpon the lyfte syde vpon my herte / mayster Rey∣mond axed hyr eftesones felyst thou ony maner of sensyble pryne in thoo places. She answerd wyth a grete sygheng & sayde / I suffre soo grete a sensyble sorowe in all tho fyue places and specyaly in my herte / that but god shewe a newe myracle it is Impossyble to me for to lyue longe tyme to gydres in this body This wor¦de marked well mayster Reymond hyr confessour and espyed where he coude see in hir ony maner tokenes of peyne Whā she had told that she wold say they depted a sonder out of that chappell / & they went to gyders home to theyr Inne / & the holy mayde went to hir chambre & ther she lay doun femyng to all that euer were aboute hyr drawyng to the deth. Thenne was mayster Reymond called & other of hys feleshyp for to see ye wound thyng / whan they were come / they wepte sore by cause they wend she shold had depted frō thē for they saw hir ne so feble nygh so to ye deth

Mayster Reymond founde wryten in a book that hir fyrst confessour wrote & they ben these In a tyme whan she was rauysshed she lerned of our lord that the prayer the whiche he made a fore hys passyon whan he watt bothe blood & water seynge thus Transfer hunc calicem &. That is fader remoue this peynfull passion fro me He prayed thenne for them whome he sawe afore that wolde haue no parte of his passion / the whiche was to him peyn¦full passyon. And by cause he loued ryghtwysnesse / he put a condycyon and sayd. Verūtamen non mea voluntas That is neuthelesse fader be not my wyll fulfylled / but thy wyll / and yf he had not putto suche a condycyon / it wolde haue fo¦lowed ther on she sayd that all folk shold haue be saued. After tyme thenne that he had thus prayed / he was herde as sayn¦te Poule sayd for hys reuerence. Ex∣auditus est {pro}pter suam reuerenciā In exposycion of this wordes of saynt Pou¦le comynly doctours vnderstonden the sa∣me It had be ellys meruaylle but that the same sone of god sholde haue be herde. Al¦so she sayd another tyme to mayster Rey¦mond & taught hym that the passyons whiche our our lord god Jhesu Cryst ve ray god and man suffred for the helthe of mankynde were so myghty / that it were impossyble ony man in erthe for to suffre but that he sholde dye & it were possyble many tyme yf that he suffred them. For ryght as his loue yt he had thenne / & hath yet to mankynde vnestymable / & vncom¦perable. Ryght so hys passyon that he suffred by constreynyng of loue allone was vnestymable. Who wolde beleue that the thornes of hys crowne sholde pe∣rysshe in to the brayne. Or that the bo∣nes of a quyk man sholde be drawe out of theyre ioyntes For the {pro}phete sayd of our lordes passyon thus. Dinume∣rauerūt omnia▪ ossa mea. That is they tolde & nombred all the bones of my body So thenne it may be proued yt the pryn¦cypall cause of hys passyon was loue / the whiche he shemed for mankynde And it myght not be shewed more conuenyent¦ly than by hys passyon. By this it se¦med that the naylles helde hym not vpon the crosse / but hys loue onely. Ne the
strengthe of man ouercame hym ot / but loue. How were men so stronge for to holde hym / that at a worde of hys mouthe they fyll doune to the grounde whan they came for to take hym Suche hyghe wor¦des & conuenyent wordes of our lordes passyon this holy mayde cōmyne wyth mayster Reymond. And yet she sayd more that she had experyence in hyr body of som maner of passyon that Cryst suf∣fred on the crosse▪ Of all she wold not say for that was Impossyble to ony erthely creature. But specyally by cause of the grete loue that she had to our lord & to his passyon the most peyne yt she suffred was in hyr herte / soo that it semed to hyr other whyle that hyr herte was to braste & cutt a sondre fro that one ende to that other. And for thys grete peyne of loue / she was oftymes dede to all mennys syght. Of thys bare wytnes many one / the whiche were presente whanne she dyed for the loue of Crystys passyon allone. Here of was mayster Reymond in gre¦te doubte. But for to put awaye that doubte / he thought to comen wyth this ho¦ly mayde & serche the sothe of hyr whether it were so or no. Whanne he axed hyr this. She for grete wepyng coude gyue none answer long tyme to gydre / but at the last she sayde. Fader wolde ye not haue grete pyte & compassyon of a sowle that were delyuered out of a derke pryson to lyght / and after tyme it had see so me∣ry a lyght / eftesones to be reclused ageyn in the same derke prysone. I am that same wretche that thus happed me by the ordynaunce of god for my synnes. Then ne mayster Reymond axed hir where hir sowle was fully departed fro the body. To whome she answerd & sayd thus. That the feruent fyre of dyuyne loue & of ghoostly desyre was so moche in hyr herte for to lyue with our lord endelesly whom she loued. That though hyr herte hadde be of stone or of yren it must nedys to bre¦ste. Therfore fader vnderstondeth thys for trouthe that myn herte of myn body was thenne vndo & opened fro the ouer∣most partye to the nether / onely by the strengthe of pure loue / so that me semeth yet I fele the markys of that syssure in myn herte. By this ye may knowe yt the sowle was fully for that tyme de{per}ted fro the body / and sette in the presence of god / where I sawe the preuytes of god / that is vnefull for to speke to ony man on erthe For ther is no speche in erthe that can expresse the preuytees in ony mānis tongue. But this wote I well as ofte as I here of that mater I am tourmented so gretly in my sowle consyderyng where I was thenne & where I am now / that I can not tell my sorowe but wyth wepyn¦ge & sobbyng. Thenne mayster Rey∣mond prayed hyr to tell him how that all this began in hyr. She answerd & say¦de. After tyme that I was fedde and comforted wyth many vysyons & reuela¦cyons by our lordes mercy / I fell seek for pure loue & laye doun in myn bedde whe¦re I prayed our lorde Jhesu that he wolde delyuer me out of this wretchyd worlde / and oned me perfytely to him The whiche for that tyme he wolde not graunte me. But he graūted therfore as long as I lyued in this lyf / shold be partyner of his passyon / in asmoche as it is possyble a dedly body for to suffre / and soo she tolde hym all that / that is rehersed afore. And more ouer she sayd / loo fader by suche ex∣peryence of hys passyon / I am made so se¦ke by the strengthe of loue / that my sowle desyred no thyng ellys but for to be dely∣uered out of this world And the same fyre so encrecyd in my sowle that my herte
often tymes defayled & departed a sonder and my soule was vtterly delyuered out of the body Neuerthelesse it was but a lytell tyme & that was my sorowe. Then ne eftesones mayster Reymond axed hir how long tyme hyr sowle was out of the body. She sayd as they that kepte hyr & were aboute to haue beryed hyr foure houres or thēne she reuyued ageyn Yet he axed hyr what she sawe for that tyme / & why came the soule ageyne to the body she answerd thus Fader that tyme my sowle sawe & vnderstode ioye of blessyd sowles / and peynes of synners. And as myn mynde wold suffre me & wordes wolde suffyce to expresse them / I shall tell you. My sowle sawe the diuyne essen cyall beyng of god / and that is the cause why I am soo lothe & vnpacyent to lyue in this worlde / and had not be the loue of hym & the loue of crysten people / for whi∣che my sowle was restoryd to the body a∣geyne / I sholde had defaylled & dyed for sorowe. The hyghest comfort that I ha∣ue is whan I suffre ony dysease / for that I haue the perfyte vysyon of god / therfore trybulacyons ben not heuysom to me / but comfortable as ye may knowe / & other that ben conuersaunt wyth me I sawe also the peynes of dampned sowles / and peynes of sowles that ben in purgatory / the whiche I can not expresse perfytely wyth no maner of wordes. For yf wret∣ched synners sawe the leste peyne that is there / they had leuer chese bodely deth an hondred tymes yf it were possyble / thēne for to suffre o daye the leste peyne that is there. But specially I sawe hem ponys shed syngulerly that had synned in ma∣trymony / the whiche hadde not kepte hem to gyder honestly as they sholde do / but folowed the dylectacions of theyr lustys Of this mayster Reymond hir confes sour axed hyr why that synne in specyall was more greuously punysshed thenne o¦ther synnes / syth it so is that it is not the most greuous synne She sayd for this skylle. For they had not soo grete con∣scyence of that synne ne so grete contrycy on as they had of other synnes / but ra∣ther they offended in that synne thenne in ony other That synne the whiche a syn¦ner chargeth not for to remoue / by penaū¦ce is a grete synne be it neuer soo lytell. Thenne this holy mayde proceded for∣the in hyr mater & sayd thus also. Fa¦der whāne I had seen all thyse ioyes and thes peynes wenyng my self that I had∣de fully be delyuered out of this body. Oure lorde sayde to me / seest thou not doughter what ioye they lacke and what peyne they haue that offenden me. Tor¦ne ageyn therfore to thy body & tell to the peple theyr errour and theyr peryll. And wyth that worde I was astonyed for to torne ageyne to the body and sore aferde. Thenne our lord sayd to me / it is pro∣fyte to mennys soules that thou torne a∣geyne / and thou shalte not lyue the lyfe that thou hast lyued a fore ne kepe the so¦lytarie allone in chambre / but thou shal¦te goo a brode to wynne sowles / I shall e∣uer be wyth the / and goo wyth the bothe goyng and comyng. Thou shalte bere the worshyp of my name and of ghoostly doctryne afore grete and smale & laye peo¦ple and clerkys and a fore Relygyous folk also I shall gyue the bothe mouth and wytte for to speke that none may wythstande the. I shall also bryng the afore bysshoppys and curates of sowles for to confounde there pryde. Whyles our lorde spak thyse wordes sodeynly my sou¦le was restored ageyne to my body. And whanne I perceyued that I had∣de grete sorowe / that I wepte thre dayes
and thre hyghtes to gyders wythout ces¦syng And yet I can in no wyse abstey¦ne ne refreyne me ther fro / whanne it co∣meth to my mynde how sodeynly I was come fro the grete ioye vnto this prysone of the body What wonder is it therfore fader though myn herte to brest euery day consyderyng the grete excellent ioye that tyme that I hadde / the whiche now it is ferre fro me / but all is done for the sowle hele Therfore ther shall no man meruay¦le though I loue them passyngly to who∣me our lord hath bede me warne them of theyr synfull lyuyng / for I haue lefte for them a grete ioye for a certeyn tyme I wo¦te not how long. Therfore as saynt Pou¦le seyth. They ben now my glorye my crowne & my ioye. All thys I saye to you fader & to all other for to putte out of youre hertes the passyon of grutchyng in tyme comyng whan I shall be homely a∣monges all men. Whan mayster Rey¦mond herde all this & vnderstode them / af∣ter the grace that was gyue hym / he {per}cey∣ued in hys herte / that for the incredulytee and blyndnes of men / all that she sayde sholde not be publysshed. Wherfore he for bade bothe the freres & the sustres / that all the whyle this holy mayde lyued in erthe they sholde not pupplysshe that matree. He perceyued also of somme that folo¦wed fyrst hyr doctryne / how they wente backward / for they coude not ne myghte not take hyr wordes But leste he shol¦de offende god yf he hadde hydde it hym¦self wythout wrytyng / he wrote it for a perpetuell recorde after hyr dyssece / & not whyle she lyued Now maydens for to knowe veraly that al this is sothe I shall tell you wytnes of recorde that were pre∣sent wyth this holy mayde whan all thyse thynges befyll hyr In that same tyme whan this holy mayde drewe nye to the deth as it semed & as it is rehersed afore. There drewe aboute hyr wymmen and other ghoostly doughters of herys / & they sent after hyr fyrst confessour frere Tho∣mas for do be present at hyr passage by prayers & other holy exercyses in commē¦dyng of hyr sowle to god. He came & thre freres wyth hym mo to be present att the passyng of this holy mayde. But whan she was passyd as it semed. One of the freres took so grete sorowe therfore that by vyolence of hys wepyng / a vey∣ne of hys brest was all for brosyd / where wyth he caught a coghe & spatte gebettes of blood. Thenne was that another so∣rowe to them that stode aboute / for bothe they wepte for the holy mayde that was so passyd. And also for hir brother the whiche was not shappely to lyue long af¦ter in that payne. Thenne sayde frere Thomas hir fyrst confessour to that seek frere wyth grete feyth and trust. Bro∣ther I wote well this holy mayde is in grete reputacyon afore god for hyr good lyuyng. Therfore take hyr honde and putte in the same place of thy sekenes. And I doubte not but that thou shalte be hole. And anone forth wyth he dyd so and so he hadde helthe / the whiche he tolde afterward to al that wolde here if Ther was also a ghoostly doughter of herys that was present thenne / the whiche was called Alyxa / & passyd out of this worl∣de sone afterward Moother were that came Inne for to see whether she was pas¦sed or not / and ther was none that coude suppose otherwyse There were also two other specyall wyttenessys / that were a∣boute for to ordeyne for the body that it sholde be beryed. And bothe were susters of penaunce of Saynt Domynyk / that one was called Katheryne as she was / the whiche was hyr felawe longe tyme a∣fore.
And that other was hyr cosyn Lysa / and thus I make an ende of thys chapytre. ¶ Of somme myracles wrought gracy∣ously by thys holy mayde aboute the hel∣the of sowles. Capitulum vij YF I sholde reherce alle the myra∣cles that our lord shewed by this holy mayde / I myght rather ma∣ke a grete book of them than for to compre¦hende hem in oo chapytre. But by cau∣se I wolde put awaye dulnesse of them that sholde rede or here this legende of this holy mayde I am aboute asmoche as I may vnder fewe wordes for to compre∣hende them in one chapytre / that they my∣ghte knowe vnder fewe wordes how gre¦te they ben the whiche I passe ouer lyghte¦ly. therfore in as moche as the sowle passeth the body in worthynesse. I shall begynne of tho myracles the whiche we∣re shewed of our lord by hyr aboute men∣nys sowles / and after that of the bodyes As touchyng for the fyrst whan that Jamys or Jacob / the fader of this holy mayde perceyued that hys doughter Ka∣theryne was alle gyuen to serue and to please our lord as it is rehersed in the fyrs¦te partye of thys legende / euer he loued & tretyd hyr reuerētly and louyngly / for be∣dyng all folk of hys housholde that none be soo hardy for to lette Katheryne hys doughter in ony maner wyse / what that euer she wyll haue done Thys is a gre¦te cause why that the doughter loued the fader. And therfore she commended spe¦cyally hyr faders helthe oft tymes to oure lord. And he had suche a truste in hys doughters prayers / that he supposed well she myght haue of god what she wold for hys helthe Sone after the fader sykened & laye doune in hys bedde all seek. Whan this holy mayde hys doughter perceyued that / anone she prayed to oure lorde hyr spouse for the helthe of hyr fader. And it was answerd to hyr of our lorde / that the ende of hys dayes of this worlde we∣re come / and that it were not spedefull for hym for to abyde lenger in this lyf. Then ne she wente to hyr fader & vysyted hym and examyned hym how he was dyspo∣sed in hys sowle / and founde redy & wyl∣fully to passe out of this worlde / hauyng no luste for to abyde lenger / wherefor she thanked our lord hyghly But thenne she prayed our lord eftesones / that syth it so is that he hadde gyuen hyr fader so gre¦te grace for to passe out of this worlde wythout synne / that he wolde wouchesauf to graunte hym also for to flee to heuen / wythout payne of purgatory.

Holy mayde I shall do what euer thou bydde me do: Not onely of this mater but also of all other what that euer it be. I knowe well now that ye deuyll hath hadde me bounde in hys chayne hyder to / but now I shall do what euer ye counseyl me to do / counseyll my soule how it may be deliuerd out of ye fendes poure I praye
you. Att these wordes the holy mayde torned to hym & sayde. I thanke god brother that thou hast perceyued what pe∣ryll thou stodest Inne of the mercy of our lord / wherof I spake fyrst to the / but thou ettys lytell therby And thenne I spak to our lord / & he herde my prayers. Therfore now good brother do penaunce for thy synnes by tymes / leste a sodeyne trybulacyon fall vpon the Thenne ano¦ne wyth grete contrycion he was shryuen of mayster Rymond of all his synnes / & afterward by helpe of this holy mayde he made pees wyth all folk / & also wyth god by counseyll of mayster Reymond. But wythin a fewe dayes after he was take by the Justyce of the Cyte & put in a strey¦te pryson / and it was a comyn saynge yt he sholde be behedyd. Thenne mayster Reymond herde that / he came to this holy mayde wyth a sorowfull chee / and sayd Loo moder all the whyle Nannes serued the fende / he had no dysease / but alwaye speryte And after tyme now he is tor¦ned to god / all the world is ageynst hym where of I am a ferde by cause he is yette but a yong braūche / lest he be all for broke by this tempest / and so fall in despeyre. I praye you therfore praye for hym to god / that he whom ye haue delyuered from the deuelys poure by your prayers / helpe him also & defende hym from his aduersaryes Thenne she sayde to mayster Reymond why be ye sory for him for whome ye shol¦de be gladde. Now be ye seker that our lord spareth him & wyll relesse hym from endeles payne by that temporall payne. Fyrst whan he was in the worlde / the worlde loued that was hys And now he is passyd out of the worlde / the worlde begynneth to hate hym. Fyrst our lord reserued for him endeles payne / but now of hys mercy he hath chaunged hys ende¦les payne in to temporall payne And of hys desperacyon be thou noo thynge in doubte / for he that hath delyuered hym of helle / wyll delyuer hym gracyously out of thys peryll / and as she sayde soo it was / For wythin a whyle after he was dely∣uered out of pryson / though he hadde grete losse of hys temporall goodys / where of thys holy mayde was no thyng sory / but was ioyefull and sayde that our lord of hys mercy hath do awaye fro hym the poyson yt he was poysoned wyth. And at the last he had so many trybulacyons / and hys deuocyon encrecyd so moche that he gaf to this holy mayde a fayre paleys of his vnder his letter and seale yt was two myle wythout the Cyte. Of the whi¦che paleys she sholde make a monastery of sustres of penaunce. Thenne this ho¦ly mayde by specyall lycence and auctory¦te of hyr holy fader the pope Gregory the xj made there a monasterye in the wor∣shyp of our lady to all hyr ghostly dough¦ters and called the monasterye the mona¦sterye of our lady. And Nannes that man the whyche this holy mayde conuer∣ted was gouerned ghoostly by mayster Reymond and lyued after a blyssed lyf. Abouen all these maters yf I wolde re¦herce all the conuersyons of euell lyuers / all the roburacyons and the strengthes of seek folke All the comfortes of deso∣late folke or them that were in trybulacy¦ons / all the exortacyons of them that we∣re in ghoostly perellys / the whiche our lor∣de hath meruayllously wrought by hys spouse this holy made. I myght ma∣ke many grete bokes. Who coude telle how many wretched synfull lyuers she hath delyuered out of the fendes bondys / How many obstynate folke she hath brought ageyne to theyr owne knowle∣che. How many she had made forsake
and despysed the worlde And how ma¦ny tempted folk in fonle synnes she hath delyuerd out of the fendes daunger by hyr prayers and doctrynes. Neuerthe¦lesse ye shall saye as saynt Jerome sayd comendyng our lady / I myght say that yf all the membrys and lym̄ys of my bo¦dy were torned in to tongues / they sholde not suffyce for to tell all the fruyte of sou∣les / that this holy mayde hath purposed to heuen by the helpe of almyghty god / mayster Reymond bereth this trewe recor¦de / that he sawe a thousand or moo bothe of men and wymmen comyng doun fro the mounteynes and other vyllages lon¦gyng to the shyre of the Cyte of Sene / co∣myng for to see and here this holy mayde as though they hadde be called by an In∣uysyble trompe / the whiche not onely by hyr wordes / but also by hyr lokyng we∣re styred to compunccyon for to be confes∣syd of all theyr synnes wyth grete contri¦cyon / & so theyr went two confessours of whome mayster Reymond was one as he seyth hym self / and they confessyd hyr synnes wyth so grete contrycion that eche man myght well knowe that there was grace gyuen of god in her hertes / & that was not onys ne twyes but oftymes. Wherfore the forsayd Pope Gregorye that was that tyme hadde soo grete ioye / and delyte of the wynnyng of soo many soules that he graūted by bull to mayster Reymond and to hys felawes / that all thoo the whiche wolde come and vysyte this holy mayde / and after desyren for to be shreuen / they sholde here them & assoylle them as moche as the bysshop of the dyo∣cyes myght do. Therfore mayster Rey¦mond bereth recorde and seyth / that there came many synfull wretches to hym and to hys felawes / the whiche were neuer shreuen a fore of the synnes / the whiche they were shreuen to hym and to them. And they stode ofte tymes fastyng fro the morow tyll euen / by cause of grete con¦cours of people / and yet they myght not suffyce for to here all that wold be shryuen All that tyme this holy mayde prayed and thanked our lord ioyefully that the fende hadde loste hys prayer. There is no penne that can expresse the ioye of hir herte that she had that tyme of wynnyng of soules. Thus moche is rehersed in this chapytre of the ghostly meruayllous thynges that our lord wrought by hys spouse. This holy mayde Katheryne a¦boute the helthe of mannes soules. ¶ Now shall I tell you in the next chapy¦tre what god wrought for hyr aboute the helthe of bodyes / & so shall I make an en∣de of the next chapytre. The wyttenesse that nedeth to be rehersed in the ende of this chapytre / ben rehersed a fore in the same chapytre / and that suffyceth ynough. ¶ Of somme myracles done in hyr lyfe by hyr aboute the lyf and helthe of men∣nys bodyes. Capitulum viij I Shall tell you maydens a won∣der meruayllous thyng. And yette it is lyght and esye to them Inough / wyth whome is founde none vn¦possybylyte. Lapa this holy maydes moder was a womman of grete sympte∣nesse and Innocencye. Yet she hadde for that tyme lytell affeccyon to Inuysy∣ble thynges. And therfore she was sore aferde to dye and passe out of this worlde. She caught a bodely sykenes / and it encreced day by day more and mo¦re. Whan this holy mayde this vnder∣stode. She prayed to our lord deuoutely
for hyr that he wold wouchesauf to socour hyr moder wyth helthe / that brought hyr forth and nouryshed hyr. She hadde an answer anone from heuen that it was beste for hyr for to passe now out of this worlde / or thenne she haue more aduersy¦tees that ben to come. As soone as she wyste this / she went to hyr moder and sayde to hyr wyttely suche swete wordes. Moder yf our lord swete Ihesu wyll calle you to hym out of this worlde / dys∣pose you to be confourmyd to his blyssed wyll / and beth noo thyng sory. ¶ Thenne the moder desyryng not for to deye / prayed hyr doughter to praye for hyr that oure lorde wolde wouchesauf to graunte hyr bodely hele / and speke nomo∣re to hyr of hyr deth. Thys holy may∣de prayed thenne our lord hertely and fer¦uentely that he wold wouchesauf take hir nought out of this worlde in to the tyme she knewe that hyr wylle were more con∣fourmed to hys wyll. ¶ Our lorde graunted hyr / hyr axynge and suffred hyr moder to be seek for a ty∣me / and not for to drawe to the passage of deth. And thenne this holy mayde was made mene betwene god and hyr moder for to praye that one / and exhorte that other. Our lord she prayed that he wolde not take hyr ageynst hyr wyll. And hyr moder she exorted and ad¦monysshed wyth swete wordes that she sholde confourme hyr and consent to the wyll of god. Neuerthelesse though in maner she bowed our lord to hyr prayers yet she myght not enclyne hir moder wyll by hyr exortacyons. ¶ Thenne our lord spake to hys spouse Katheryne and sayde. Telle thy moder that she hath now no nede to passe out of this worlde / but tyme shall come that she shall desyre for to deye / and then̄e she shal not haue it / and that was sothe. ¶ Hyt befyll that she lyued in to a grete age / and sawe many aduersytres in hyr dayes / as well of persones as of theyr goodys / in so moche that she sayde ofte ty¦mes in heryng of many folke suche wor∣des. Whether our lord Ihesu hath put a soule in my body / that it shall neuer be de∣lyuered thens So many chyldren and doughters grete and smale yong and ol∣de ben dede / and I may not deye ¶ Now I shall cesse of this mater and procede forthe in the fyrst mater that I be¦gan Lapa this holy maydes moder was of so harde herte that she wolde in no wy∣se dye ne by confessyd / ne thynke in noo wyse on hyr soule hele. ¶ Thenne oure lorde for to appyre more meruayllously in hys spouse Katheryne denyed in maner as it semed hys fyrste graunte. And suffred Lapa to dra∣we fast toward the deth wythout confes∣syon Whan this holy mayde perceyued that / she lyfte vp hyr eyen to heuen wyth wypyng terys & sayd to our lord thus. A a lord god ben thise thy behestys that thou hast graunted me / that none of my faders houshold shold perysshe / is this thy mercyable byheste that saydest my moder sholde not passe hens ageynst hyr wyll. I see well now that she shall dye wyth¦out sacramentys of holy chyrche Ther¦fore I beseche the by alle thy mercyes that thou suffre me not to be deceyued / and that I goo not hens a lyue vnto the tyme thou haste yolde to me my moder reuyued in soule and body. ¶ These wordes and these meruayllous cause herde thre wimmen of Sene that we¦re present. ¶ Whan hyr moder as it semed by sygh¦te and felyng was dede / soo that they we¦re aboute for to go home ageyne to theyr
howses leuyng Lapa there for dede / yf it had not ben that the holy mayde prayed as she dyd / and therfore they abode the lenger. Of the maners of these wym∣men I shall tell you afterward. ¶ Thys holy mayde contynued long in prayers / at ye last our lord herde hyr pray¦ers gracyously / and quyckened the soule and the body ageyne of Lapa / that she ly¦ued afterward vnto ye tyme she was fou¦re score yere of age and nyne wyth grete torment of herte for many aduersytres that she suffred as it was prophecyed to hyr afore by hyr doughter this holy may¦de. ¶ Of this myracle were wytnesse one Katheryne and Angelyna sustres of pe¦naunce / and also Lysa this holy maydes cosyn they were present whan Lapa was leyde forthe for dede and herden how this holy mayde prayed to oure lorde thus. Lorde ben these thy behestys that thou behote me as it is sayd afore. Of the re¦meynaunt of hyr age / whan she was re∣storyd ageyne to lyf / bare wyttenes ma∣ny one. Lo ye maydens here may ye kno¦we of what meryte this holy mayde was wyth our lord Ihesu that delyuered hyr faders soule out of purgatory / and redu∣ced hyr moders soule in to hir body agey¦ne meruayllously. ¶ Another meruayllous thyng shall I tell you. It happened that ther was a comyn pestylence of bocchys reygnyng in the Cyte of Sene / soo that it oppressyd bo¦the men and wymmen / yong and olde to the deth / that comynly they dyed wythin two dayes or thre at the ferthest / the whi∣che sekenes feryd many a man. ¶ Thenne mayster Reymond wente a∣boute to vysyte seek folke / and comforted them in god no thyng chargyng of the In¦feccyon of that pestylence touchyng hys bodely deth / soo that he myght wynne sou¦les. Whanne he hadde so vysyted them for werynes that he had in goyng abou¦te / he restyd hym in a chyrche of our lady / where to he hadde a grete deuocyon / and namely for the persone of the same chyr∣che was a blessyd lyuer and well kno∣wen wyth thys holy mayde Katheryne / the whiche persone was called Syr Ma∣thewe. ¶ It befyll fewe dayes after that may∣ster Reymond wente out by the morowe for to vysyte seek folke as he was wonte And as he came by the chyrche of our la∣dy for deuocyon that he hadde to our lady in that place / and also for affeccyon that he hadde to the persone syr Mathewe / he wente for to loke how he ferde. Sodeynly whan he was entred in to the chyrche / he sawe syr Mathewe bere vp in to hys chambre semynge as he hadde be dede by vyolence of that pestylence For he hadde lost bothe colour of hys face and strengthe of hys body / and also hys spe∣che. ¶ Thenne mayster Reymond axed of other aboute what hym eyled. They an¦swerde and sayd / that the nyght afore a∣boute one after mydnyght / he was vppe for to vysyte a seek body And wyth Inne lytell tyme afterward he was take wyth the pestylence Here of was may∣ster Rymond ryght sorye & folowed hym vp to his chambre as other dyd and then ne satte doun by hym. Wythin a whyle after whan he was lay¦de in hys bedde / he recouered his spyrytes ageyne and callyd mayster Reymond to hym prayeng hym of confessyon / and so was shryuen clene of hys synnes as he was ofte wonte to do. After tyme that he was assoylled may∣ster Reymound axed how it stode wyth
hym / and he answerd and sayd ageyne / that it greued hym so sore in hys grynde or in the flanke / that it semed to hym / his thygh wolde falle awaye / and not onely the thygh / but also ye hede fareth as though it were departed in foure partyes / by pay¦ne and ache that he suffred ther Inne. Thenne mayster Reymond touchyd & tastyd hys poūse and founde well that he hadde a passyng feuer Wherfore he had hys menye that they sholde bere hys wa∣ter to leches and so they dyd But may¦ster Reymound folowed soone after to knowe verayly what the leches wolde saye. To whome the leche sayde thus. Thys man is take wyth the pestylen∣ce / and therfore I drede me that the hows of our lady shall wante and lacke a good persone. ¶ Thenne axed mayster Reymond / whe¦ther he myght be holpe by ony maner re∣medye of medycynes / he sayd that he shol¦de assaye. But he hadde no grete trust in noo medycynes by cause the sykenes was ryght greuous. Thus mayster Reymond departed from hym wyth gre∣te sorowe euer prayeng by the waye to our lord in hys soule / that he wolde wou∣chesauf to saue hys bodely lyf Yet a why¦le for hys example to many: ¶ In the mene whyle this holy mayde herde saye that syr Mathewe was seek / whome she loued tenderly for hys vertu∣ous lyuyng. Anone she wente home to hym / and as soone as she sawe hym she cryed to hym and sayd. ¶ Aryse vp syr Mathewe / aryse vp for shame / is it now tyme to lye a bedde. Sodeynly thenne atte hyr callyng / the feuer and the bocche wente away fro hym as though he hadde neuer hadde hem / and thenne he roos vp wythout ony taryeng goodly / soo that in hys rysyng he sayde smylyngly and ioyefully / that the vertue of god restyd in that holy mayde. ¶ Thenne the holy mayde wente awaye and fledde the preysyng of men. But as she went out of the hows / the mette wyth mayster Reymond. To whome mayster Reymond sayd full sorowfully. ¶ Moder whether thou wylte suffre this man to dye / that is so dere and profyta∣ble to vs. Alle be it that she wyst well ynough what she hadde to done / yette she sayde to hym of mekenes suche wordes. Fader what wordes be these / whether ye wene I am god / that may delyuer men fro deth. ¶ Thenne sayde mayster Reymond to hyr ageyne wyth a grete spyryte for soro¦we that he hadde of hys deth Saye this to whome that thou lust / but to me tell no suche thynges that knoweth how our lor∣de dothe wyth the. I knowe well that what that euer thou axyste of god thou shalte haue. ¶ Thenne this holy mayde bowed hyr he¦de to hym and smyled. And at laste she loked vp wyth a gladde chere vpon hym and sayd. Be of good chere fader / for he shall not dye at thys tyme. ¶ Wyth that was Mayster Reymound gladde / he knewe well that god hadde gy∣ue hyr grete grace / & soo he departed from hyr and wente to syr Mathewe for to lo¦ke how he ferde. Whome he founde syt∣tyng in hys bedde / and wyth gretr ioye rehersyng the myracle of the holy may∣de. ¶ To whome Mayster Reymound say∣de in confortynge of hym that the holy mayde tolde hym. Syr Mathew sayd thenne to mayster Reymond. What trowe ye she hath do / he sayd he wyst ne for she tolde him no wor¦de therof. Syr Mathew wyth yt aroos
vp out of his bedde & sat doune by may∣ster Reymound and tolde hym all the ho¦le gladly how the holy mayde was there and sayde to hym as it is rehersed afore Soone after syr Mathew ete and dran∣ke none seke mannis mete / but hole mā¦nys mete / and that was a grete meruey¦le / he was mercy and gladde that vnne the he myght speke a worde that same da¦ye in the morowe / Of this myracle were wytnesse: one Fryer Nychol that came wyth Mayster Reymound and other pre¦stes and clerkes of the hous of our glori¦ous Lady gloryous vyrgyn Mary xx. or there aboute / But now I praye you maydens taketh hede that infydelyte off curyous hertes dysceyue you not in this myracle / Somme wyll saye to you pera¦uenture that it is none greate merueyle though a man be helyd of suche a comyn sekenes as is the feueres and pestylence for all day suche a thynge happeth / To whom it may be asked agayn what mer¦ueyle that was whan our lord heled pe∣tre his wyffes moder of ye feuers / al day it happeth that men ben delyuered of the feuers be it neuer soo greuous: why is it than of petris wyffes moder rehersed for a myracles in the gospell. But now ta∣keth hede ye curyous vntrowyng hertes take hede whether it be not he the whiche he¦led this man Mathewe that heled petris wyffes moder: In helyng of petre wyf∣fes moder he commaūded that her feuers sholde goo fro her / and soo it dyde anone wythout ony taryeng▪ And she thenne arose vp and mynistred our lord at mete ¶ Ryght soo in this miracle it was the same lorde that spak in the holy maydes breste the whiche heled petrys wyffes mo¦der / and soo syr mathewe was bothe off the fruers and also of the pestylence / What was the cause trowe you / trewely for the mynystracion that he sholde shewe to our lorde in tyme comynge for wyn∣nyng of soules / soo thenne the entent fo∣lowyng is cause of the miracle that goth byfore / & therto he was made so perfyght¦ly hole that he ete forwyth hole mete and mennys mete as thought he hadde not be seke afore now I sythe I haue tolde you of the myracle done to the helthe off bodyes. I shall telle you a nother by the helpe of god / ¶ A lytyl beside the Cyte of Sene there was a deuoute woman that was one of the susters of penaunce of saint Domy∣nyke the whiche herd and sawe moche off the vertuous lyuyng of this holy may∣de / she drewe moche to her afterward and was vnder the coūseyll of this holy may¦de / & dyde her reuerence as to her moder After it befyll on a day that this deuout suster was on hye on a solier of her hous for certayn thynges that she hadde to do And sodenly the solyer fyll doune & the woman vndernethe ▪ alle the raftre treys brosed so her that she was drawe out hal¦fe ded or soone after to be deed / At the laste by the helpe of god she was brough¦te to bedde and began to reuyue and fel∣te that payne of her herte brosour: & com∣playned her sore wyth wepyng and wey¦lyng / Leches than were sought to do the besynes for to hele her▪ but yet for all her lechecraf she myght not tourne her in her bede without helpe of other: Whan ye holy mayde katheryn herde therof / she had com¦passion in herte of the suster and came to her and comforted her in penaunce and in her dysese / But whan she perteyued that her dysese was soo passyng payne to her She touched the places of her body that were paynefull as though she wolde a∣noynted theym wyth her hondes: Of the whiche touchyng the suster
was well apayed supposyng faythfully by the mercy of god that it sholde bee to her grete ese / She hadde not so soone tou∣ched her syde but that she was all hole as though she hadde felt afore none payne / Thenne the seke suster prayed her that▪ she wolde touche the oder syde as she dyde ye syde by cause the holy mayde thenne sup¦posed that it was ese to her / She dyde soo as she badde her & in the same wyse her dysese went a waye in that place after her touchyng as it was in the other syde: soo thenne at the laste the holy mayde tou¦chyd ouer all her body there she felte dyse∣se / and all dysese was clene a voyded / At the laste whan she was alle hole she tourned her aboute by her self wythouten ony helpe that all myght see verely by her tokens that she was fully hole: Neuer∣theles yet she helde her peas tyll tfe hooly mayde was a goo leste she sholde haue troubled her mekenes yf she hadde tolde it her ī presence / but afterward she told it bothe to leches & to neyghbours and say∣de thus katheryne the doughter of Lapa hath heled me by her touchyng / All they hadde me rueyle therof and thanked god that hadde gyue suche gracious vertues to the holy mayde katheryne / For they wyste ryght well that the holynes might not come but of god & therfore they than¦ked hym / This myracle Mayster Rey∣mound knewe by tellyng of other: But now I shall tell you of anther yt mayster Reymound him self knewe and sawe it ¶ In that tyme whan the greate pesty∣lence contynued in the Cyte of Sene as it is rehersed afore: there was an holy re∣cluse in the Cyte of Sene and was cal∣led Scūs that louyd the whiche was tou¦ched wyth that same pestylence: whan this holy mayde perceyued that she ordey¦ned that he sholde be brought to the hous of our gloryous lady gloryous vyrgyn mary the whiche was called also ye hous of mercy where she her self wyth her fela∣wes vysyted hym and ordeyned for al∣thynge that was nedefull for hym in his sekenes and at the laste she came to him her self and tolde hym preuyly in hys ere and sayde thus / Fader drede you not for thou shalt not deye for this sekenesse att this tyme / but she wolde telle not thyng of this to Mayster Reymound and to her felawes the whiche prayed her to pra¦ye for hym that he sholde lyue / For it se∣med to them that she was in doubte off his lyf as well as they were / and therfo¦re she ordeyned for hym medycins for to be heled by: wherfore Mayster Reymaūd and alle her felawes were sory by cause all they louyd that holy man for his gode lyuyng: Thenne at the laste his sekenes encresed more and more and drewe faste to the deth as it semed: wherby al that sa¦we hym supposed he shold deye and pra∣yed for the good passage of his soule: And also the holy man wende he sholde haue deyed right anone / In that same poynt of deth this holy mayde came and rouned in his ere & saide to him ye second tyme / fader drede you not for yu shalt not deye at this tyme for this sekenes he vn∣derstod her wel all be it yt his wyttes we∣re in party dystrauʒt & alienyd fro hym for the greuousnes of the payne & he ga∣ue more credence to her wordes thenne he dyde to his actuall payne of deth / & so it fyll afterward that the holy maydes wor¦des ocame ye dedes of kynde & nature / Neuertheles he contynued in suche transi¦te passyng ye comyn tyme of other mani dayes to gyder / but at ye last as ye spirite was in passyng as it semed / The holy mayde came and sayde nowe ye thyrde tyme in the seke mannys ere thus I charge the spyryte in the name

Soo that men and wymmen deyed, wythout com∣forte and counseyll and kepyng mayster Reymoūde bythought hym that he was bounde to loue mennis soule castyng no¦ne peryll for his one bodely dethe by en∣fection of that pestylence purposed hym to goo aboute the Cyte and vyseted seke folke and comforted theym and dyde it in dede / Neuertheles by cause he was a∣lone in party in so grete a Cyte for to vi¦syte and comforte the seke / that vnethes he myght haue tyme or space for to ete & to reste.

In the mene whyle he hadde a feuer and the hede ache as the maner was off that pestylence sekenes soo that he was gretely payned and tourmentyd / But yet he sayde his matyns as he myghte: whan it was daye he called to hym hys felawe and wente to gyder as he myght to the holy maydes hous and founde her not at home for she was out to vysyte a seke body / ¶ In the mene whyle hym thought she was soo longe and he so seke that he my¦ght no thynge doo / but lay doune there in a lytyll bedde / prayeng all tho that we ren in the hous that they sholde sende for her assone as they myght / She was sent after and came anone and perceyued yt he was sore seke / she knyled doune afore his bedde and crossed hym on the forhede wyth her honde: And thenne she began to praye as she was wont to done in her soule / Mayster Reymound behelde how she was rauysshed a fore hym hopynge of som̄e synguler grate for the prouffyte of his soule or of his body abode her long as him semed / within a half an houre af¦terward or there aboute he felte all his bo¦dy sterid to avomite: wening yt he sholde haue caste. But yet was it not soo / but hym thought that out of euery▪ parte
of his body was pulled out wyth a ma∣ner of vyolence somme maner of corrup¦cion / And so began to wexe better at ese than he was / yet or than the holy may∣de was fully restoryd agayn to her bode∣ly wyttes he was all hole saue a lytyl fe¦vylnes bylefte in hym / After tyme thys holy mayde hadde purchased of our lord that grace of the helthe she seyd of that rauyshyng and badde her felawes shold ordeyne somme mete for hym / whan he had receyued mete of her holy hondes she badde hym lye doun and este a whyle he dyde soo as she badde hym: And whā he awoke / he was as stronge as though he hadde not be seke / Then̄e the holy may∣de sayde vnto hym / fader gooth and laboureth now for the helthe of sowles thanketh almyghty god that hathe dely∣uered you fro this parylle: he went forthe to his custumably besynes and thanked god that hadde gyue suche vertu to hys blyssyd mayde / Suche a lyke myracle our lorde wrought by this holy mayde to Fryer Bertylmewe in time of the same pestylence / But yet that myracle was ye more bi cause her long time was oppssid in that sekenes than Mayster Reymoūd And by cause it was in all wyse lyke ellys / therfore I passe ouer and reherce it not: But I wolde ye vnderstood may dens that this holoy mayde shewed not oonly the dyuyne myracle of curacion in tyme of pestylence but also in other ty¦mes / and yet not only in the Cyte of Se¦ne but also in other places But therfore one I shall declare at this tyme wherby ye may vnderstonde all other yf ye take hede wytely therto ¶ It befyll soone after that the general pestlence the whiche is rehersed afore / ye many folke both men and wymmen as well relygyous and seculer / But specy∣ally certayn mynchis of the Cy of y¦se herde of the famous name of this holy mayde katheryn desyreden to see her and here her speke / And by cause it was not¦lefull for theym to goo oute and seke her therfore they prayed her as well by let∣tres as by messengers that she wolde vouches f to come to yse seyeng to her that there she myght wynne many a son le the whiche sholde be to oure lord greate worshyppe / Albe it that this holy mayde eschewed alwaye for to go fer about the contre / yet she was soo ofte prayed wyth soo many messengers or messages that she was almoste constryned therto by prayer of lettres & messages: Thenne she had a recource to prayer as she was wont to done and asked our lorde meke¦ly declaracion of that doubte that she sto∣de in and what she sholde doo / somme off theym that were counseyllers to her saide that it was best for her to goo: and som̄e sayde nay: wythin a fewe dayes after∣ward she had an answere of our lord as she beknewe afterward to mayster ey∣mound that she shold not tarye: but alga¦tys she sholde goo to speke wyth hys ser∣uauntys and his spouse dwellyng in the same Cyte of Pyse: Thenne as a tewe obedyencer by leue of Mayster Rey∣mound her confessour she wente to Pyse whome folowed afterward Mayster Reymound wyth a certeyn of hys bre∣dren for to here confessyons: For many ther were that came to her whā they herde her speke soo eruent wordes of loue / we∣re steryd therby to contrycion / And let they sholde be lette fro trewe conuersacyō & falle agayn in to the fendes snares af∣ter suche cōpuccion she wold beidde theim go to confession & be shryue without ony taryeng / And by cause her confessy∣on was ofte tymes delayed for defaute
of confessours / therfore ofte tymes she de¦syred that she myght haue confessours by her to whom she myght sende suche re∣pentaunce: And therfore Maister Rey∣mound and his two felawes hadde po∣wer of the pope by bull for to here and as¦soyle all tho that were endued to confes∣syon by this holy mayde: Whā she came to Pyse she was receyued in a burgeys hous that was called Gerardus the whi¦che Gerad vpon a daye brought wyth hī a yonge man of xx yere of age alle seke of the feuers to this holy mayde besechin¦ge her that she wolde praye for his helthe for he tolde her that he was vexid. xviij / monethes to gyders wyth the feuers soo that it was none daye but that he hadde it / And therto it was so my¦ghty to him that it hadde brought hym soo lowe / and that is well sene by hys chekes and by hys body: And myght neuer by none medecyn be made hoole / Thenne the holy mayde hadde grete com¦passyon in herte of that yonge man / she asked hym how longe it was a goo that he was shryue of hys synnes and toke penaunce / he sayd not many a yere / ther∣fore it is sayde she that our lord hath ye∣ue the this oorge for thou hast not pur∣ged thy soule by holy confessyon soo lon¦ge tyme. Therfore sone goo forthe anone to confession and cast out that venim the whiche enfecteth alle thy body: whan he was confessyd and ame to her agayne she put her holy honde vpon his sholders and sayd to hym thus. Goo sone in pee of our lord hesu cryst for it is his wyll that thou be nomore vexed wyth tho fe∣uers as she sayd it was fro that time for¦ward he was not vexed therwyth. Within fewe dayes after he came again to the holy mayde / and thanked her of her curacion and sayde openly afore a folke that he hadde neuer the feuers sythe she a voyded it by the vertu of our lord / ff this bereth wytnes Mayster Reymound for he sawe that myracle: And other wytnesse there were ynow by Gerad & the childes moder and many other after¦ward the yonge man puplychid that mi¦racle by all e contree suche another by∣fyll in the Cyte of Seene / but moche mo∣re▪ merueylous by cause the sikenes was more perylous / ¶ There was a suster of penaunce of saynt Domynyke in the same yte off Seene that was called Gemina the whi¦che loued well this holy mayde: she had a sekenes of hir throte the whiche was called the synce / by contynaunce of ty∣me the sekenes encresyd soo that it made her throte soo streyght that vnethe she mi¦ght drawe her brethe▪ but almoost ofte ty¦mes was strangelyd / Thenne she wente to this holy mayde & prayed her as she myght speke seyenge thus / moder I shal¦deye but ye helpe me / this holy maide had¦de soo grete compassyon of her that she to¦ke her holy honde and crossed her throte▪ ¶ And anone wythout ony taryenge te sekenes avoyded: and soo she that co¦me wyth grete sorowe: went home wyth grete gladnesse / And tolde it soone after to her confessour / But by cause somme what I haue tol∣de you of curacions done to the body by this holy mayde to diuerse persones ther¦fore I shall telle you now of a grete no∣table myracle that our lorde wrought i this blessyd holy mayde / ¶ It befyll that this holy mayde wente in a tyme fro Pyse to Auyoun wyth whome wente two good deuoute yonge men that wrote the lettres that this holy Mayde wolde sende: The one was called Neryus that afterward as a deuoute recluse. And the other was
caled Stephene that was afterward a monke of the charterhous / And a good vyrtuous lyuer therto / to the same yte of auyoun wente als mayster Reymoūd ¶ It happed whan they were entred in to the Cyte of auyoun the forsayd Nery∣us was seke wyth a merueylou syke∣nes in his bowellis that he myght haue none reste / neyther nyght ne daye / But cryed and wayled ofte tymes and he mi¦ght not lye in his bedde but creped about on hondes and on feet and sought reste / and yet myght none fynde This was tolde to the holy maide and she badde mayster Reymound sende af∣leches to helpe hym: For other comforte wolde she none gyue mayster Reymoūd dyde soo: and there was none leche that myght ese him but rather he was the mo¦re payned / I trowe for that ende allone by cause our lord wolde worke that my∣rarle in his spouse katheryn / At the last leche said to maister Reymoūd yt they my¦ght not prouffyte in hym / And therfore they hadde none truste in his lyffe / ¶ Whan Mayster Reymound hadde tolde this to his companye as they satē at the mete Stephene the felowe of Nery¦us roos vp wyth a grete spyryte & went to the holy maydes chambre sytyng dou¦ne on his knees and prayed her mekely that she wyll not suffre his felowe Nery∣us to deye in suche a straunge contree: To whom this holy mayde answerde thus / sone why art thou heui thou sholdest not be sory for thy felawe / For our lorde wyll rewarde hym in blysse for his pacy¦ence in sufferyng of that sekenes / Then̄e he sayd agayn / dere moder yett here myn prayer at this tyme and helpe hym for I wote well ye may and ye wyll / Thenne she sayd well sone I see well that thou art not in will to conforme the to the wil of god as I haue tolde the / Therfore sy¦the I see that thou art soo tourmentyd for hym / come to me to morowe whan I go to here masse and be houselyd and reduce this mater to myn mynde / And I shall sende vp thyn prayer to god / And thou shalt praye for me that I maye be herde Thenne stephen was well apayed wyth this vyhesteerly / on the morowe / he met∣te wyth this holy mayde goyng for to he¦re masse / Assone as he aspyed her / he fyl¦doune on his knees and prayed her that she wolde not forgete hym of that he spa¦ke to her the day afore. After tyme whan she was hoelyd she was rauysshed from her bodely wyttes and prayed our lord for that seke man: Soone after she was restoryd ayen to her bodely wyttes and came to the same Stephene smylyng the whiche abode her there of an answere and sayde vnto hym thus: Sone thou hast the grace that thou hast asked / Thenne he asked her whether Neryus shold be deliuerd of his sekenes She sayd ye: wyth that he wente gladly to his felawe and badde hym be of good there for he shall be hole / and soo he was full tendaunt aboute for to recouer hym / In tyme of his mynystracion aboute hī it happed the same Stephene to be seke & lay doune in his bedde of a passyng fe∣uer / Whan the holy mayde knewe that she hadde grete sowwe and went to hym and asked hym what sekenes he hadde: And she perceyued by touchynge of hys ponse that he was vexed wyth a strong feuer: Anone wyth a greate feruour o spyryte she sayde thus / I charge the fe∣uer by the vertu of obedyence that tho goo out of this man / thenne went the fe¦uer a waye and he wos vp all hole with out ony taryeng / and thanked oure lorde of his grete grace that he shewed to hys
spouse Katheryne. Another notable myracle I shall telle you of a suster of pe∣naunce / the whiche was called Johan dwellyng in the Cyte of Sene In a ty¦me that our holy fader pope Gregory that lyued that tyme was in the cyte of Sene at the byddyng of our holy fader Grego∣rye / this holy mayde was sent to Floren¦ce to make pees betwene hym & his rebell children of florēce / ye whiche mat is to lon¦ge to tell here But this mater shall hau a chapytre by hit self afterward by ye hel∣pe of god And whan she was come to Florence / & wyth hyr a felawe of heres / the whiche was called Johan / for to trete for the pees betwene our oure holy fader / and that rebell people. The people sette lytell by hyr wordes / but slaundred hyr meruayllously & set hyr at nought. Then ne she was counseylled for to withdrawe hyr a whyle vnto the tyme that they we∣re cessyd of theyr malyce. She dyd so / but yet she sayd / that she wold neuer pas¦se out of that cyte in to the tyme they we∣re accorded / and pees were cryed thorugh out all the cyte of Florence / & as she say∣de so it was. Thenne she wente a syde & was lodgyd a lytell besyde the cyte / whe¦re sodeynly hir suster Johan was seek in hyr foot / so that hyr foot was all forswol¦and ther wyth for payne of hyr foot / she had a grete eruent axes / and so she was in double wyse tormented that she myght not goo wyth hyr. Thy holy mayde was heuy therof & wolde in no wye leue hyr behynde / let slaunder sholde spryng She prayed to our lord for helpe / that he wold woucheauf mercyably to helpe hyr felwe / all the whyle that she prayed hyr suster was a slepe And whan she awo¦ke she was all hole as though she had I had no sykenes. Anone she arose vp & went wyth this holy mayde as quykly as euer she dyd afore. ¶ Of this my∣racle many one thanked our lord that sa¦we it / the whiche had wrought soo gracy∣ously by hys spouse Katheryne. Yette shall I tell you another meruayllous thyn¦ge that our lord wrought by hyr in the cy¦te of Tholetane. Whan this holy may∣de was entred in to the Cyte of Tholeta∣ne / she took hir Inne / and anone she wen¦te in to hir chambre as she was wonte to do In to ye whiche mayster Reymond was come on the popes message. So∣deynly thenne he herde in the stretys of the Cyte of wymmen / that an holy wommā was come & entred in to the Cyte Then ne soone after cam men / and after wym∣men to hyr Inne & axed where thys holy mayde was. They of the Inne myght not hyde hyr / but they suffred wymmen onely to goo in to hyr & speke wyth hyr. Thenne ther was one of the wommen that hadde a lytell chylde / whos whombe was meruayllously swolle. And they prayed this holy mayde that she wold ta¦ke that childe in hyr armes / at the begyn∣nyng she refused it / by cause of vayn glo¦rye / but at the ast she was ouercome by pyte / and dyd as they had hyr / as soone as she took that chylde in hir hondes / ano¦ne ye childe deliuered from him moche wyn¦de / so that at last hys bely aswagyd / and was as small as euer it was / & soo the chylde was hole. All be it that mayster Reymond sawe not this myracle / yet ther was so open speche therof in the Cyte of Tholetane yt it came to the bysshopys ere / and sent after mayster Reymond & prayed hym that he myght speke wyth ye holy mayde / for the childe was neuewe to a vycary of hys. And than this holy mayde came & spake wyth the bysshop of many vertuous maters. Many moo¦meruayls our lord wrought by this holy
mayde that ben not wryten in this book. But these fewe I haue wryten to you maydens by cause that ye shall the sonner gyue credence that our lord Jhesu Cryste dwellyd in this holy maydens soule / the whiche principally wrought all thyse mer¦uayllous werkys / wytnes of tho maters ye whiche ben reherced in this chapytre ben reherced afore in tho places where these my racles were shewed / and thus endeth this chapytre. ¶ Of myracles wrought by thys holy mayde a boute the delyueraunce of them whiche were encombred and vexyd wyth fendes. Capitulum lx Owre lorde all myghty Ihesu ces∣syd not to shewe outward ye Fer¦tue that he gaue Inwarde to hys spouse Katheryne by many meruayllous werkes. The vertue therfore of our lor¦de Ihesu cryst angmented so myghtly in the brest of this holy mayde / that not one¦ly it was shewed to seek bodyes as it is reherced afore / but also it was shewed in voydyng of wycked spyrytes as it shall be declared in this chapytre by the helpe of god. Ther was in the Cyte of Sene a man / the whiche was called mychael that vsed the craft of wrytyng / whan he was passed in yeres of age by consent of hys wyf / he was in purpose to leue ye worlde / & serue our lord more specyally thenne he was wonte. And also for to make two doughters of hys mynchyns in a monas¦terye in the same Cyte of Sene endowed in worshyp of saynt Johan the Enange lyst & so hys lyst was fulfylled. And at the last by a pryue dome of god / one of his doughts the whiche was made a myn then that was called Laurencyana of vill yere of age or there aboute / was vexed with a fende so yt all the monasterye was vnquyeted by hyr vexacyon. And at ye last by comyn assent they sent after hyr fader & delyuered ageyne hys doughter / for they wold nomore haue hyr in the mo¦nasterye as long as she was so vexed. Whan she was take out of the monas∣terye / the fende spak wythin hir by ye chil¦dys mouth many wondre thynges & all in latyn wordes / so many herde questyōs & ther to pupplysshed many pryue syn∣nes in sclaunder of many folke / by ye whi¦che it myght well be vnderstond yt he was no good spyryte Of this vexacyon hyr fader & moder and other of hir frendes we¦re ryght sory / & wente aboute to dyuerse relyques of sentes for to seke helpe & gra∣ce that her doughter myght be delyuerd of that spiryte And specyally they trusted gretely in the relyques of saynt Ambrose the whiche was a frere prechour / to who∣me our lord graunted a synguler gyfte / to put awaye wycked spyrytes / soo that hys cope yf it had be layde vpon ony crea¦ture that had be vexed wyth a wicked spi¦ryte it sholde be auoyded / where fore the sa¦me chylde was brought to the frere pre∣chours & leyde vpon a tombe of saint am¦brose / & hys clothes were leyde to the chil¦de / and the fader & the mod prayed in the mene whyl the helpe ef god & of ye sente yt the chylde myght be socourre. But yet for that tyme were they not herde. Not for no synne that euer they dyd But I tro¦we be cause yt the syguler remedyes was reserued to this holy mayde. Thenne was it counseylled to the fad & mod for to pre¦sente hyr doughter to Pratheryne the holy mayde / they sent to ye holy mayde prayen¦ge hyr yt she wolde helpe theyre doughter. And she sent ageyn answer & sayd / that
often tymes defayled & departed a sonder and my soule was vtterly delyuered out of the body Neuerthelesse it was but a lytell tyme & that was my sorowe. Then ne eftesones mayster Reymond axed hir how long tyme hyr sowle was out of the body. She sayd as they that kepte hyr & were aboute to haue beryed hyr foure houres or thēne she reuyued ageyn Yet he axed hyr what she sawe for that tyme / & why came the soule ageyne to the body she answerd thus Fader that tyme my sowle sawe & vnderstode ioye of blessyd sowles / and peynes of synners. And as myn mynde wold suffre me & wordes wolde suffyce to expresse them / I shall tell you. My sowle sawe the diuyne essen cyall beyng of god / and that is the cause why I am soo lothe & vnpacyent to lyue in this worlde / and had not be the loue of hym & the loue of crysten people / for whi∣che my sowle was restoryd to the body a∣geyne / I sholde had defaylled & dyed for sorowe. The hyghest comfort that I ha∣ue is whan I suffre ony dysease / for that I haue the perfyte vysyon of god / therfore trybulacyons ben not heuysom to me / but comfortable as ye may knowe / & other that ben conuersaunt wyth me I sawe also the peynes of dampned sowles / and peynes of sowles that ben in purgatory / the whiche I can not expresse perfytely wyth no maner of wordes. For yf wret∣ched synners sawe the leste peyne that is there / they had leuer chese bodely deth an hondred tymes yf it were possyble / thēne for to suffre o daye the leste peyne that is there. But specially I sawe hem ponys¦shed syngulerly that had synned in ma∣trymony / the whiche hadde not kepte hem to gyder honestly as they sholde do / but folowed the dylectacions of theyr lustys Of this mayster Reymond hir confes¦sour axed hyr why that synne in specyall was more greuously punysshed thenne o ther synnes / syth it so is that it is not the most greuous synne She sayd for this skylle. For they had not soo grete con∣scyence of that synne ne so grete contrycy¦on as they had of other synnes / but ra∣ther they offended in that synne thenne in ony other That synne the whiche a syn¦ner chargeth not for to remoue / by penaū¦ce is a grete synne be it neuer soo lytell. Thenne this holy mayde proceded for∣the in hyr mater & sayd thus also. Fa¦der whāne I had seen all thyse ioyes and thes peynes wenyng my self that I had∣de fully be delyuered out of this body. Oure lorde sayde to me / seest thou not doughter what ioye they lacke and what peyne they haue that offenden me. Tor¦ne ageyn therfore to thy body & tell to the peple theyr errour and theyr peryll. And wyth that worde I was astonyed for to torne ageyne to the body and sore aferde. Thenne our ford sayd to me / it is pro∣fyte to mennys soules that thou torne a∣geyne / and thou shalte not lyue the lyfe that thou hast lyued a fore ne kepe the so lytarie allone in chambre / but thou shal¦te goo a brode to wynne sowles / I shall e∣uer be wyth the / and goo wyth the bothe goyng and comyng. Thou shalte bere the worshyp of my name and of ghoostly doctryne afore grete and smale & laye peo¦ple and clerkys and a fore Relygyous folk also I shall gyue the bothe mouth and wytte for to speke that none may wythstande the. I shall also bryng the afore bysshoppys and curates of sowles for to confounde there pryde. Whyles our lorde spak thyse wordes sodeynly my sou¦le was restored ageyne to my body. And whanne I perceyued that I had∣de grete sowwe / that I wepte thre dayes
ende of this chapite / It nedeth not for to reherce the wytnesses of euery acte that was done in this chapytre / for it is ma∣de mencion of forthwyth at euery acte ī the same chapytre / ¶ Of myracles whiche our lord wrou∣ght by this holy mayde in breed / wyne. herbes▪ and other thinges that had none lyff: Capitulum xj BY cause at the begynnyng whā Adam was made our lord or∣deyned a rewle to all tho that o∣beye to hym perfyghtly / that all thyn∣ges sholde obeye to them. Therfor may¦dens in this nexte chapytre I shall telle you how to this holy mayde obeyden alle creatures by cause she obeyed perfyghtly to god: In the tyme that this holy may∣de lyued in the Cyte of Seene: it befyll yt there was a wedowe a yonge woman called alixe the whiche wyth a greate fa∣uoure drewe to this holy mayde / soo that she thought she hadde soo grete affectyon o her▪ that as her semed she myght not li¦ue without her: And therfore she toke the habite of the susters of penaunce and for soke her owne hous / And hyred her an hows by syde the hooly maydes hows that she myght the more ofte bee conuer∣saunt wyth her. Whan she hadde do thus the hooly mayde was ofte tymes in her hous wyth her / and fledde for a tyme her faders hous / It happed afterward in ye same yere that in the Cyte of Sene there was a grete sharsyte of breed corn soo ye stynkyng whete was drawen out of the erthe and out of dyches the whiche was bought of Cytezynes of the same Cyte as that tyme for good where by cause the¦re myght none other begoten for none pryce / Of the whiche stynkyng whete / A∣lyxe the sorsayde wedowe must nedes be ye / or ellys she shold be wythout brd / Neurtheles in as moche as it was ny∣ghe ye tyme of herwest her olde whete was fayled and brought to the marcat Alixe wyst therof that newe whete was comen she purpose to cast awaye the olde syn∣kyng whete and beye newe: but bycause the hole Mayde was in her hous she wol¦de nothyng doo wythout counseyll of her wherfore she opened her purpos to her se∣myng thus / moder sythe our lord heth do mercy wyth vs in syndyng of newe whe¦te I am in wyll to throwe myn olde sin¦kyng whete▪ To whom this holy mayde answerd thus / yf ye wyll not ete of that olde corn / gyue it ellys to poure folke yt hauen none▪ Alixe sayd than yt she shol∣de haue greate conscitence for to gyue the poure folke soo stynkyng whete she hadde leuer for to gyue theim of the beste whete Thenne this holy mayde badde her ordeyne water and bryng to her that stin¦kyng whete that she purposed to caste a∣waye for she sayde that she wolde make brede therof for poure folke / as she sayde soo it was / Fyrst she made her dowe & after she molded loues of that lytyll quā¦tyte of whete: And it encresyd soo plen∣tuously in the moldyng that both Alyxe and her seruaunt weren gretely astonyed that sagen suche multyplycaciō of loues For as theym thought soo many loues myght not be made of suche foure lytyll quantyte of whete as thys hooly mayde made and sette forthe for to be bake / and also there was none stynche of tho loues as it was of the other that were made of the same whete afore / whan thei were ba¦ke they were sette fourth on ye table for to be eten: & in ye etyng there was foūde no∣ne bitternes no stynche / but as thei saide

This Alexe sent fo her confessonr & he came wyth certain of his bretheren for to see▪ that myracle and lyke as it was sayd to hym in quantyte encresyng and in qualyte ryght well amendyd: To thy∣se two myacles / the thyrde was addyd to and that was this / the breed was lar¦gely gyuen to poure folke and to other yt wolde ete therof and yet was it neuer ye lasse in nombre / but alwaye was it foū∣de ynow in ye breed hutche: were not this trewely thre fayr myracles / for fyrste she put awaye the stynche of that corn: and afterward encresyd the loues in the mul¦dyng / and at the laste she multyplyed ye loues in etyng of the breed: in soo moche that they myght vnnethe be distribued bi many wekes togyders neended / soo yt xx yere after or moo there were somme yt kepte of that breed for a relyke: ¶ Thenne mayster Reymound her con¦fessour asked her how ye myracle was done / She answerd and sayde that she hadde soo grete zele or loue to pour folke lest they shold spylle for defaulte and soo tender loue to our lord lest his gyfte shol¦de be dyspysed that she went wyth a gre∣te feruour for to make breed of that styn¦kyng whete: ¶ And thenne our blessyd gloryous la¦dy gloryous virgyn Mary wyth a mul∣tytude of angelis stood by her and helpe her to molde / by vertu of her holy glory∣ous hondes she trowed that the loues en¦cresed / for tho loues that oure gloryous Lady gloryous vyrgyn Mary molded / she delyuerd to this holy mayde / And she to Alixe and to her seruaunt for to be put in to the ouen: what meruayle is it maidens though tho loues were swete sythe the hooly gloryous hondes of oure blessyd gloryous lady gloryons virgin Mary molded theym / consydereth therfor¦re good maydens and taketh good heede of what meryte this holy mayde was to whom vouchesaf our blessyd glorious la¦dy gloryous vyrgyn mary stonde by her and helpe her in that myracle for to ma∣ke vs vnderstonde that ryght as bodely lyuelode encresed in that hooly maydens hondes / Ryght soo ghostely liuelode shol¦de encrese by her blessyd exortacion: ¶ Now sythe I haue begonne of breed multyplyed by myracle therfore I shall contynue forth in suche in suche in suche a lyke myracle was done in the laste ende of her lyff whan she lyued here in erthe: Of the whiche myracle were wytnesses lysa her cosyn and a suster of penaunce the whiche was called Johan for bothe they were wyth her whan she was sente after by our holy fader pope vrbane the vj to the courte of Rome / And whan she was come to the Cyte she rsted there wyth a certayn nombre of her ghoostely chyldren that she hadde noryssched in ver¦tu the whiche folowed her fro the partyes of Tuskan in maner agaynst this hooly maydes wyll / som̄e for prechyng of ghos¦tely grace of our holy fader / and somme for pylgrymage and visitacions of sain¦tes the whiche desyred to go specyally in this holy Maydes companye by cause they myght be fedde wyth the swetnesse of her blessyd conuersacion / ¶ Thenne this holy mayde hadde made an ordynaunce amonges them that they sholde not haue aboute them neyther gol¦de ne syluer. But oonly they sholde lyue of poure almesse / And that they sholde be herbourd in an hospytall / ¶ And also the wymmen eueryche off theym a weke sholde mynysre lyflod su¦che as they hadde receyued of almesse to all her felawes that other myghten bee

But Johan had forgete that / whan hyr fela∣wes were come to mete Johan wolde ha¦ue sette brede afore them / and she founde nomore but a cantell that wolde vnnethe seue foure to theyr mete / and ther were in nombre of persones xvj Thenne Jo¦han wente to this holy mayde & knowle∣ched hyr neglygence all sory & shamefast / seyeng that ther was no brede but a lytell that vnnethes wolde suffyse to foure / eche of them to resteyne a lytell. To whome this holy mayde sayd A suster god for gyue it you / why haue ye so neglygently brought vs to this last nede / myght ye not haue warned me as I bad you / well well byd goddes seruaūtes go sytte doun Thenne sayde the mynyster that ther was but a lytell brede / yet byd them sytte doun sayd this holy mayde to hir / and ser¦ue them wyth that lytell / and bydde them begynne wyth that lytell tyll that god or∣deyne more.

And also the suposed that that lytell brede shol¦de soone be do But alwaye they hadde ete ynough / and yet the brede myght not defaylled And thenne they axed what the holy mayde dyd / it was tolde that she prayed Thenne they sayd all by vertue of hyr prayer our lorde fedde them as he fedde fyue thousand men wyth fyue lo∣uys / and so they thanked god. Whan they hadde all ete / yet ther was suche plen¦te lefte that poure folke had ynough. ¶ Now yette shall I tell you of another myracle that mayster Reymond bereth re¦corde of / the whyche was done after tyme that this holy mayde was passed out of this worlde in to the blysse of heuen. In a tyme hit happed mayster Reymond by counseyll of the Pryour of the freres and the couent / wolde doo somme solempne re¦uerence to the hede of Saynt Katheryne this blyssed virgyne / after tyme that it was translated out of the Cyte of Rome to the freres that dwelled at Sene. He sette a daye and bad to mete all hyr ghos∣tely chyldren that she had nourysshed in vertue. In the whyche day the freres we¦re fully auysed to gyue hyr a solempne re¦uerence / and also to fede that day all hyr ghoostly chyldren. Whan the day was comen and the solenpne was done. The frere that kepte the botrye of the couent lo¦ked what brede he hadde for the Couent / and for the gestys / and he founde scarsely ynough for half the Couent And thenne were there in Couent fyfty or there aboute and of gestys twenty / whan the Pryour herde here of he was sory. Neuerthelesse yet he serued the gestyn fyrst wyth that ly¦tell / and thenne the Couent wyth a lytell quantyte among them all / and yet belefte ynough Soo thenne eueryche of the Co∣uent and of the gestys hadde plenteuous¦ly ynough / of that vnnethe as them se∣med that lytell nombre of louys myght hadde suffysed fyfe a fore. Whan they had all eten / the Pryour and the Couent
came thyder ther mayster Reymond satte wyth the ghoostly chyldren of that holy mayde Saynt Katheryne / and rehersed a fore them all that myracle. Thenne say¦de mayster Reymond these wordes. Loo frendes this holy mayde Saynt Kathery¦ne in the day of hyr solempnyte wyll not leue vs wythout somme myracle / wyth whome she was so famylyer whyles she lyued in erthe. Ofte tymes whan she was wyth vs lyuyng in this lyf she she∣wed this myracle among vs And ther¦fore for to shewe vs that she now accep∣teth oure obseruaunce this daye done to goddes worshyp and to herys / she hadde shewed the same myracle eftesonys after hyr passyng / wherfore yelde we than∣kyng te almyghty god. Yet furthermo¦re our lord shewed meruayllous thynges by his spouse Katheryn in vnlyfely thyn¦ges / as in floures where in she hadde ofte tymes grete delyte by cause she florysshed in vertue hyr self. And in other vessel¦les of houshold that were lost & destruyed and of thoo meruayllous thynges I shall tell you. ¶ Thys holy mayde was somme tyme in the Cyte of pyse / herborowed in a wor∣thy mannes hows of the same Cyte / the whiche man loued well this holy mayde. After tyme she was ther a whyle / she was gretely feblyd in body by ofte exces¦se of spyryt in rauyshyng / so that as it se¦med mayster Reymond and other moo that sawe hyr. She was brought nye to ye deth / wherfore mayster Reymond was fore aferde lest she sholde haue dyed / he be∣thought hym what remedye he myght or∣deyne for to restore hyr to lenger lyf / and he wyst neuer what he myght ordeyne for hyr as for egges and wyne / and also o∣ther letuaryes he knewe welle that she myght not ete. Thenne he came to hyr and prayed hyr that she wolde receyue a lytell suker in hyr water that she dryn∣keth / to whome she answerd thus. Fa¦der I see well that ye wyll take awaye fro me that lytell lyf / the whiche is left in me by suche swete drynkes / for I doo you well to wete that all swete thingi to me dedly Thenne mayster Reymond and the souerenys of the hows bethought hem to gydres what remedye they myght or∣deyne ageynst hir feblynes At the last it came to mayster Reymond mynde that he hadde see that ofte tymes feble folke hadde be wesshen / somme tyme wyth ver¦nage aboute the temples in the pouses of the body / and so were restored of strengthe and gretly comforted Thenne mayster Reymond sayde to the souereyne of the hous thus. Syr sethe it is soo that we may not putte noo comfortable remedye wythin hyr body / lete vs▪ vse somme reme¦dye wythout on hyr body. Thenne sayde the souerayne of the hows / that he had a lytell besyde hys hows a neyghboure that hadde a vessell of vernage / to whome he sayde / he wolde sende to for to haue a bo∣tell full therof / for he knewe well that he sholde haue it full gladly. A messenger was sent to hym / and tolde him how this holy mayde was feble / wherfore he praied in his maystrys behalf that he wold wou¦chesauf to sende hyr a botell of vernage. To whome the neyghboure answerd thus that he wolde sende hym all redy / but cer∣teyn he sayde hys vessell was emptyd / and therfore he prayed hym to holde hym excused / for I wote well in all my hows is no drope of wyne / and that I am ryght sory fore. Neuerthelesse to be seker co∣me and see / and thenne bere wytnesse of the trouth to my frende as thou seest. Thenne forthwyth he took the messen∣ger wyth him all ageynst the messengers
wyll / and brought hym to hys wyne se∣ler / and shewed hym that same vessell of vernage / the whiche vessell semed by out∣warde tokenys that it was voyde many day afore / yet neuerthelesse the good man dyd more for to see the trouthe that it was voyde / he drewe out the spygot / that was in the vessell / and drewe it out in hys pre¦sence / that he sholde see that there was noo wyne Inne. As soone as he hadde do∣ne soo / the vernage came out and ranne vpon the grounde plentuously / he was so¦re astonyed and stopped the vessell agey∣ne / and callyd all hys meyne / and axed of them whether they hadde putte ony▪ wy¦ne of vernage in that vessell. All they sayde naye / they knewe no wyne there in thre monthys a fore and more. And it hadde be a grete meruayll that wythoute them ony lyquor had be putte ther Inne. Thys was afrward notefyed to the neghboures aboute / and all they sayde it was a myracle as it was The messen¦ger came ageyne wyth a grete meruayll gladdenes bryngyng wyth hym a botell of vernage / and tolde all the myracle as it was / soo that all thoo that herde it than∣ked our lord that wrought suche a myra∣cle in hys holy mayde Katheryne / and many one aftward whan this holy may¦de was hole / came for to see hyr / seyeng wyth grete meruaylle suche wordes / how may this be that drynketh noo wyne by myracle. By suche wordes of the peo∣ple / this holy mayde caught grete sorowe in hir herte as she knowleched afterward to mayster Reymond. And wyth su∣che sorowe and waylyng / she prayed to our lord in hyr sowle more thenne in hyr mouthe seyeng suche wordes: A good lord why suffrest thou me to be so tormen¦ted in herte that I shall be to all folke sha∣me and reproue. All other seruauntes of thyne may lyue among the people sa∣ue I allone. O good lord who axed of thy myldenes wyne. I by Inspyracyon of thi grace haue kept me fro wine long tyme And now I am made to all people for wyne in sorne and reproue / I praye the lord for thy grete pyte / make that wy¦ne for to vanysshe awaye / that this same whiche is deuulgyd amonges men now cesse. Our lord of hys mercy herde hyr prayer and made the vessell of wyne to de¦crece / so that sodeynly ther it semed full to all mennes drynkyng the whiche drank therof of deuocyon by cause of the myracle it was decrecyd to the lyes / and so all tho that praysed it afore for myracle / helde ther pes afterward for shame▪ And mayster Reymond and other moo of hyr ghoostly chyldren were ashamed of theyr grete praysyng afore. But the holy mayde was Jocunde and gladde thankyng our lord hyr spouse that hadde delyuered hyr of suche open praysyng of men. ¶ Now I praye you maydens taketh he de how oure lorde kepte this holy mayde from vayne glorye / and sette hyr in a per∣fyte grounde of mekenesse by thyse two myracles. By the fyrst he gaue hyr mater to worshyp him that wrought that myracle wythout hyr we∣tyng in that / that he fylled ye vessell of wy¦ne. By the secounde he gaue hyr mater to folowe hym in mekenes / in puttyng awaye of vayne glorye / the whiche was putte vpon hyr. By the fyrst our lord shewed what vertue of myracle she was endowed wyth By the secounde he she¦wed what wysdome she was fulfylled wyth. For there that mekenes is / there is wysdom. Neuertheles yet the secoū∣de myracle in emptyng of the vessell was gretter thenne the fyrst in fyllyng of the vessell / & that semed well by a simylytude
that Saynt Gregorye makyth in hys dy¦aloges betwyne the vertue of pacyence & shewyng of myracles / whether he seyth that the vertue of pacyence passeth she∣wyng of myraclee. Why thenne may not the vertue of trewe mekenes / the whi¦che is neuer wythout wysdom passe with out ony comparyson shewyng of myra∣cles / the whiche come as well by pryde as by mekenes. A bestely man may in no wyse perceyue this / and that is no mer¦uaylle. For Saynt Poule sayde that prudence of the flesshe is in no wyse sub∣iecte to god. Loo maydens now haue I tolde you what myracles our lord she∣wed by his spouse Katheryne in vnlyfly creatures / and thus I make an ende of this chapytre The wytnesse of this cha¦pytre also ben expressyd afore wyth Inne this chapytre there that the myracles ben declared. ¶ Of the ofte receyuyng of the holy sa∣crament of the aulter / and of the meruayl¦les whiche our lord dyd to hyr touchyng the holy sacrament / and other relyques of sayntes. Capitulum xij IT was knowen to all that knew this holy mayde whyle she lyued in erthe / what excellent loue she hadde in reuerence and deuocyon aboute the worshypfull sacrament of the aultre. Oure lorde hys flesshe and hys blood so that for the often receyuyng therof / hit was a comyn seyeng among the people that Katheryne the holy mayde was hou¦selyd euery day and lyued ther by allone wythout ony bodely mete. And all be it that they sayd not alwaye trouthe / yet I suppose they tolde it mekely gyuynge honour to god that euer apperyth meruay¦lous to hys chosen Neuertheles be cau¦se she receyued it so ofte / all be it that it we¦re not euery daye / yet ther were somme that grutched wyth all / ageynst whome may be brought wytnes ynough of holy faders that they dyd the same. But fyrst I shall tell you what the vse was of holy chyrche in olde tyme. Saynt De∣nys seyth in a book that he made de eccle∣siastica Jerarchia / that in the begynnyng of holy chyrche / the feruoure of the holy ghoost was so haboundaunt in the hertes of feythfull creatures bothe men and wō∣men / that they receyued the sacramente of the aulter euery daye Furthermore the doctryne of holy chyrche techeth this / that euery feythfull man is bounde in no dede∣ly synne yf he haue actuell deuocyon / it is not only lefull for hym / but also meryto∣rye for to receyue that excellent worshyp∣full sacramente Whoo thenne durst for∣bede suche a feythfull persone and suche an holy lyuer in ony maner wise for to wyn¦ne so ofte grete mede in receyuyn of that worshypfull sacramente. Trewely I doubte not therof / but that suche a creatu∣re had grete wrong yf it be denyed whan it is mekely vxed. But yf they wolde say vtterly / that it is not lefull to no crea¦ture be he neuer so feythfull / ne neuer soo perfyte ne deuote for to receyue that blys∣sed sacramente ofte. To this I shall tell you what answere this holy mayde gaue to a bysshop in presence of mayster Rey∣mond that sayd these wordes aforsayd to hyr. Alledgyng for hym the wordes of Saynt Austyn where he seyth thus. Eue¦ry day for to receyue the sacrament of the aulter nother I prayse ne blame it▪ to this obyeccyon answerde this holy mayde in this wyse to the bysshoppe. Fader yf Saynt Austyn blame it not. Ye alled
ge that holy doctour ageynst youre selfe. Ouermore now shall I tell you what Saynt Thomas Auyne seyth of thys doubte / whether it be spedefull to a crysten man ofte tymes or euery day for to recey¦ue the sacrament of the aulter. He ans¦wereth thus therto / that ofte receyuyng of that blyssed sacrament / encrecyth the de∣uocyon of hym that receyueth it / but it les¦syth other whyles hys reuerence that he sholde haue to that blyssed sacramente. Therfore euery feythfull Crysten man sholde haue bothe reuerence and deuocyon to that blyssed sacramente And whan he feyleth that hys reuerence is lessened by ofte receyuyng of that blyssed sacra∣mente / he sholde absteyne a whyle / that he myght go therto afterward wyth more re¦uerence. And yf he fele hys reuerence euer hole and neuer lessened / but  encrecyd wyth deuocyon / as o euer he receyueth it. Thenne he may sekerly receyue it. For truely wythout ony doubte suche a sowle well dyspesed wyn∣neth moche mede in the receyuyng of that blyssed sacramente. Thys holsom doc∣tryne of this deuoute and holy doctoure Saynt Thomas kepte this holy mayde Katheryne For ofte tyme she receyued that blyssed sacramente. And somme ty¦me she absteyned hyr ther fro. All be it that she hadde euer desyre to be knytte to hyr spouse by medytacyon of the blyssed sacrament / for the brennyng charyte whe∣re by she was drawe to hym / in so moche other whyle she desyred to be houseled. That but she hadde receyued that day whan she desyred that blyssed sacrament she shold haue a passion of syknes in hir body / as though she hadde be vexyd long tyme afore wyth a contynuell sekenes of feuer / and all that sykenes of the body ca¦me fro the passyon of the soule. Many tymes she was thus vexed whanne she was letted from houselyng / other whyle by the Pryoure of the freres / and other whyle by the Pryoresse of theyr ordre of hir susters. Neuertheles by cause she shol¦de not be lette / our holy fader the pope Gre¦gorye the xj for hyr more comforte graun¦ted hyr by bull that what preest hrde hyr confessyon myght housell hir in what pla¦ce that he wolde say masse wythoute ony leue of ony souereyne. ¶ Of one meruayllous thyng now shall I tell you yt befyll to mayster Reymond this holy maydes confessour. In a ty¦me whan mayster Reymond came from Auyon to the Cyte of Sene / and though¦te to loke how this holy mayde ferde / he entred in to hyr hous aboute none dayes and founde hyr in hir oratorye. And this was on Saynt Markys day the Euan¦gelyst / as soone as she sawe hym she rose ageynst hym and sayd to hym these wor∣des. O wolde god fadre ye wyst how hongry my soule is▪ Thenne mayster Reymond answerd hyr / for he wyst well ynough what she mente. And sayde mo∣der it is now all most paste tyme of syn∣gyng / and I am soo wery that vnnethe I may dyspose me to syng Wyth that she helde hyr pees a lytell whyle. And soone after she brack out ageyne the same wor¦des and sayd / she was sore an hongred. Thenne mayster Reymond wente to masse in hyr owne chapell that she hadde by lycence of the pope / and sayd masse of Saynt Marke. And whan he hadde vsed he torned for to gyue this mayde ge¦nerall absolucyon / as the maner of holy chirche axeth. He sawe hyr face lyke the face of an angell sendyng out bemys of bryghtnesse / in soo moche that he mer∣uaylled and sayd in hym self to oue lord thus. Thys is not Katheryns face.
But certeyne lorde this is thy dere spou∣se / wyth that he torned hym to the aulter / and sayde thys wordes to oure lorde in hys soule. Come lorde to thy spouse / a∣none as he had sayd that in hys thought sodeynly wyth the same thought / the oste rose vp hym self and came to hys hondes ¶ Another meruayllous thynge of this blyssed sacramente I shall tell you / that befyll to the same mayster Reymond. He was in a tyme in the Cyte of Sene for certeyne thynges that he hadde to done / and as soone as he hadde done / he wente for to speke wyth this holy mayde and founde hyr syke of a sykenes in hyr syde the whiche was callyd Ilica passio / and of other gret infyrmytees of hyr body / de syryng that same day to be houseled yf hyr sykenes hadde be cessyd. And af∣ter tyme mayster. Reymond hadde com∣myned wyth hyr of the grete excellence of the blyssed sacrament of the aulter / he went home to hys Couent for to say mas∣se And as he made hym redy to masse∣ward / this holy mayde sente to hym by a felawe of heres / and prayed him to abyde a whyle / for she wolde be houseled that day whan hyr sykenesse were passyd a∣waye from hyr. He dyd so and abode hyr leysyr tyll it was aboute none tyme / this holy mayde was esyd and came to chirche for to be houselyd. But hyr felawes con∣sydered that the tyme was late for to be houseled / thenne by cause she hadde it in custome for to abyde afterward thre hou∣res or foure to gyders in rauysshynge or more So that the chirche dores most all that tyme stooden open / of the whiche cus∣tome many of the freres grutcheden / ther∣fore they counseylled hyr not for to be hou¦seled for grutchyng of somme of the fre∣res. To the whiche counseyll this holy mayde mekely and obedyently conctyd But for hyr grete desyre that she had to that blyssed sacramente / and myghte not receyue it she prayed oure lorde deuou¦tely in the ferrest place of the chirche / vn∣knowyng to mayster Reymond that she was come / and there she prayed in this wyse. Lorde Thesu endeles mercy as thou hast gyue me gracyously this desy∣re. Soo I beseche the perfoume it by thy¦self / syth I may not perfourme my de∣syre by noo preest. Thenne almyghty god that neuer despyseth the desyre of his seruauntes / herde hys spouse Katheryne not onely mercyably. But also mer∣uayllously as I shall tell you. Whan she hadde comforte of oure forde / she sen∣te to mayster Reymond by one of hyr susters and prayed hym to goo to masse whan it lyked hym / for she myght nott be houselyd that day. Thenne he wente to masse supposyng that she hadde be at home at hyr hows / and not in the chyrche. And whan he hadde sacred / and wolde make the frac∣cyon a fore Agnus dei in thre partys as holy chyrche hath ordeyned. Mer∣uayllously as he wende to haue made iij partycles / he founde foure partycles. And that fourthe partycle skypped aboue the Chaleys and come doune be it self / and layde it self vpon the corporas / as it semed to mayster Reymond. But he coude neuer fynde it afterward. For many tymes he sought ther after bothe that same tyme / and also whanne masse was doune / wherfore he made gre¦te sorowe in hys hert. Whanne he had de soo dylygently sought it ouer alle a∣boute the aulter besyde the aulter and vp¦on the grounde At the last he bethought
hym to aske counseyll of the pryour of ye place herof / the whiche pryour loued and dred our lorde god right moche / couering in the mene tyme the aulter that none bo¦dy shold come there vnto the tyme he shol¦de come agayn.

Capitulum secundum AFter tyme ye mayster Reymond wente fro this holy mayde as it is rehersed afore / by the byddyng of our holy fader the Pope / she belefte in the Cyte of Rome / and what that our Lor¦de dede for hyr or that she deyed / & shewed to other how holy of lyuyng she was / and also what ioye he gaue hyr or she passyd out of this worlde I shall tell you. ¶ Leue it well maydens / whan this ho∣ly mayde perceyued that so moche dysease encrecyd in holy chyrche by the scysme / yt was begonne / and perceyuyng also that Crystys vycarye suffred grete dysease / she wept day and nyght / and prayed to our lord for the pees / that he wold wouchesauf to set pees in holy chyrche. Thenne our lord comforted hyr in som maner of wyse for the yere afore and an half or she dyed oure lorde gaue double vyctorye to holy chyrche / and to Crystys vycarye the po∣pe as well of the castell of Saynt Angell that was in the Cyte of Rome / the whiche was in scysmatykes hondes in to that daye / as of the people that helde the castell in the name of scysmatykes / that were ye same daye take / and the castell yolde. After that our holy fader the pope that myght not dwelle in Rome as he was wonte by cause of the enemyes that were in the Castell of Saynt Aungell knowe this / he cam to this holy mayde & axed hir counseyll what he sholde do. Thenne she gaue hym counseyll that he shold go bar∣foot & all the people of Rome wyth hym to the mynster of Saynt Peter thankyn¦ge our lord god wyth good deuocyon of that grace / and of that benefetys the whi¦che he had do for them. Thus holy chyr¦che beganne to quyken / and the holy may¦de hadde therof grete comfort. But soone after hir sorowe began to encrece eftsonis for that the fende myght not do by strayn gers / he assayed for to do by them that we¦re of the Cyte of Rome. He made a dys∣oorde bytwene ye people of the Cyte & the pope. That perceyued this holy mayde she prayed to our lord that he wolde wou∣chesauf put to hys mercyable honde / and suffre not that cursyd synne be done And as she prayed / she sawe the Cyte full of fendes styryng and excytyng the people
to kylle theyr ghoostly fader / and cryed horrybly to this holy mayde all the why∣le she prayed / seynge to hyr thus Thou cursed wretche thou arte aboute for to lette vs / therfore we shall slee the wyth an hor¦ryble deth. To whome she answerd no worde / but prayed more besyly and more feruently axyng of our lord that he wold wouches auf for the worshyp of hys holy name / and for remedye of all holy chyrche that thenne stood in grete meshyef / kepe hyr & hys vycarye wythout harme / and not for to suffre the peple do suche a synne and so to put awaye the fendes fro theyr purpose / the whiche steryng the people ther to. She hadde an answere of our lord / and it was this. Doughter suffe this peple / that euery day blasteme myn holy name / for to falle in to this synne / that I myght soo dystruye them for theyr cursed wretchydnesse for my ryghtwysnes ax∣yth that I shold no more suffe theyr wyc∣kydnes. Thenne she prayed more feruent¦ly wyth suche wordes and sayde. Mekest and myldest lord / thou knowest well how thy spouse holy chyrche is dyseased & tor∣mented / almost thorugh out all the world and that is routhe. Thou knowest well also how sewe helpers and defenders she hath / and therfore now yf they slee thy vy carye as they ben in purpose / hit shall not onely be greuous to this people of Rome but to all Crysten people Thempre ther¦fore good blyssed lorde thy ryghtwyse honde and dyspyse not thy people that yu haste bought soo de wyth thy precyous blood / but torne thy mercyable honde & cesse this myshyef. In this prayer she contynued many dayes to gyder as she wrote to mayster Reymond by a letter e∣uer our lord alledgyng his ryghtwysnes and she axyng his mercy / and in all that tyme the fendes cryed hoybly vpon hir as it is rehersed afore / so that she was fe∣ble for afflyccyon / yt but yf our lord had kepte hyr strengthe / hyr here shold to bors¦te / at last she sayd to our lord these wor∣des. Lorde syth it  so yt this mercy may not be graunted wythout ryghtwysnes / I beseche the despyse not my prayers / but what maner of payne these people sholde haue put it on my body / and I shall glad dely eceyue it for the worshyp of thy na∣me / and for the sauacyon of holy chyrche. Thenne our lord alledged nomore hys ryghtwysnes / but helde hys pees & gaue hyr the vyctorye / and fro that houre forth¦ward the grutchyng cessyd of the peopl by lyll and lytell / but hyr passyons en∣creced so ferforth that serpentes of hell had power of god and trmented hyr body cruely that it were vncredyble a man for to byleue it but yf he hadde seen it / as they sayden that sawe it and were ther pesen¦te / whanne hyr body autyshed / all be it that they sawe not the serpentes. They fretted and deuoured so that maydens bo∣dy / that therin be lefte but bones without skynne / as though it had ben consumed and wasted by long lyeng in the erthe / and yet neuerthe she walked & prayde as she was wonte / the whiche was to ma¦ny folke a wonder thyng / for she semed rather a wonder thyng to loke vpon / then ne a naturell thyng Hyr tormentes of payne encreced contynually / by the why∣che she was consumed / and yet she cessyd not from prayer / but she prayed ore fer∣uently and more lener thenne she was wonte. Hyr ghoostly chyldren whom she hadde nourysshed in vertue were that same tyme / and they sawe openly the markes of the strokes that the endes of helle gaue hyr in hyr bodye / and they myght do therto no remedy for two skyl∣les. One was for they wyste well hit
was the wyll of god whome they myght not wythstonde. Another cause was / for they sawe hyr gladde and ioyfull in hyr paynes / and the more that she prayed the more was hyr bodely payne But yet wolde she not cesse therfore / and the tor∣mentours of helle faylled not / but that they cryed vpon hyr alle that tyme / and sayde to hyr thus. Cursed wrtche thou hast euer be ageynst vs / and therfore thy tyme is come we for to be auenged vpon the. Thou haste putte vs oft tymes from our praye / and therfore we shall ne∣uer cesse vnto the tyme thou arte oute of thys yf. Thys she sente by letter to mayster Reymond / and soo she contynu¦ed in that payne from the sondaye of sep∣tuagesme vnto ye last daye of Apryll. sa¦ue one day ye whiche day she passed out of this world In ye whiche tyme a meruayl¦lo{us} thyng happed hyr as she sayd & wro∣te to mayster Reymond. Cuery daye it befyll hyr of custome that she hadde the passyon on the syde that is callyd lyca passio / and other moo vnto none tyme / wherfore ofte tymes she desyred heryng of hyr masse / and therfore euery daye by the morowe or thenne that the payne ca∣me vpon hyr / she wente to Saynt Pe∣ters chyrche thorugh oute alle the lenten. And soo herde hyr masse / and abode there tyll euensong and thenne came home a∣geyne and laye hyr doune in hyr bedde. In the whiche bedde whos hadde seen hyr / he wolde haue sworne that she mygh¦te neuer remeue hyr thens. Yet on the next mowe she wse vp and wente eft∣sonys f a place that is called via pape in to Saynt Peters chirche / soo fast that hyr Journey sholde haue made an hole man wery. Thys she contynued all the lenten / and wythin a fewe dayes af¦ter she laye styll in hyr bedd / and myght not remeue hyr thens for feblenes. And at last oure lorde called hyr and she passyd out of thys worlde. ¶ In the same daye that is rehersed afo¦re aboute none dayes / that is the nyne and twenty daye of Apryll / the whiche was vpon a sondaye. The yere of our lord a thousand thre hondred and foure sore. In the whyche daye the feste of Saynt Peter the martyr of the ordre of the frece prechours was and is solemp∣nysed in holy chyrche. ¶ Many notable thynges were wrou∣ghte thenne in hyr passyng / the whyche I lefte of in this chapytre / for they shall be declared openly ynough by the helpe of god in the next chapytre / & thus endeth this chapytre. ¶ How this mayde desyred for to be vn∣bounde fro the body / and be wyth Cryste and that is prouyd by a deuote prayer that she made / and is putte in the ende of another book whiche she mayde / and what is in that book generally and shor∣tly is wryten in this book wyth the sa∣me oryson. Capitulum ij WHanne the ende of the bodely lyf of this blyssed mayde Katheryn drewe faste vpon hyr / oure lorde shewed a ioye to hyr in hyr passyng by dyuers tokens / by the whiche ioy and glorye he purposed to rewarde hys spou∣se after hyr labour and sykenes in heue answeryng to the gyftes of grace / that she receyued in erthe. Among all other tokens by the whiche he shewed the per∣feccyon of hyr owl to all thoo that wol∣de consydere / it was this. That he quy kened hyr desyr euery daye more and
more for to desyre to be vnbounde from the body and be wyth Cryst. And for this skylle it was that she myght clerely and openly beholde in blysse▪ That tu∣the / the whiche she sawe in this lyfe by a myrour of feyth. The whiche desyre soo moche the more it encrecyth in hy her∣te / in as moche as the lyght aboue kyn∣de shyned in hyr herde from heuen. And therfore aboute a yere and a hal∣fe afore or thenne she passyd out of this worlde. Oure lorde shewed to hyr suche a clee knowyng of tuthe / that she was constreyned to shewe it openly oute by wrytyng. That was the cause why she prayed wryters as it is rehersed afore / that whan they sawe hyr in rauysshyng they sholde be dy to wryte that / the whi¦che she sholde speke by the mouthe for that tyme / and soo in a lytell tyme she compyled a book / that conteyneth a ma∣ner of a dyaloge / bytwene a soule axyn¦ge of oure lorde foure petycyons. And oure lorde Ihesu Cryst answeryng to the same soule / and enformyng it of many profytable trouthys. In the last ende of whiche book two thynges ben sette that me semeth is nedefull for to reherse here / as well for the grete profyte that rederys sholde fynde therin / as for to declare this blyssed maydens desyre / that she hadde soo perfytly in hyr soule. ¶ Neuerthelesse by cause noo body shol∣de mysdeme me / wenyng that I wolde translate it other wyse thenne she sayd in hyr owne language / therfore I purpo∣se to translate it none other wyse thenne she sayde it worde by worde. Tho two thynges by these. Fyrst the recapytu∣lacyon of the same book I sette in the en¦de / the whiche rehersed shortly all tho thyn¦ges that ben dyffusely sette in the book a∣fore. The seconde is a prayer / the whi¦che this holy mayde made / whanne she hadde endyd hyr book / by the whyche prayer is openly shewed what desyre she hadd to be vnbounde / and loosyd oute of hyr body and be wyth Cryst. Afore the recapytulacyon thys holy mayde reherseth in the ende of the same o¦ke / that almyghty god the fader of oure lorde Ihesu Cryst spekyth to a soule atte e ende of the dyaloges after tyme he hadde long tyme spoke afore of obedyen∣ce of perfyte folke in this wyse. ¶ Now my welbeloued and dere dough∣ter I haue made a sythe to thy desyre ro the begynnyng to the laste ende / the whi∣che I haue made spekyng of obedyence. For yf thou haue good mynde in the begynnyng / thou axest me wyth a grete desyre of herte / as I made the to axe / that I sholde encrece the fyre of my cha∣ryte in thy soule. Thou axest also foure petycyons / of the whyche one was for thy selfe. To the whiche petycyon I made a sethe to the by Illumynyng / the whiche the lyght of my trouthe / and shewyng to the alle the maner / by the whiche maner by medyta¦cyon of the lyght of feyth wyth knowele chyng of thy self / and of me / thou co∣mese to the knoweleche of the trouthe. The secounde petycyon that thou axest that I sholde to mercy wyth the worlde. The thrydde petycion was for my mys¦tery all body that is of my spouse holy chir¦che / prayng me that I sholde wythdrawe all derkenesse of perfeccyon from hyr that she suffreth. And thou axest that I shol∣de punysshe the wyckydnes of them vp∣on the. Therfore it was that I declared to the that no pay∣nes fynyte or gyuen in tyme fynyte of it selfe allone maye make satysfaccy∣on for trespas doone ageynste me /

THe holy doctour saynt Gregorye seyth in hys dyalogus yt the ver∣tue of pacyence is more commen¦dable thenne shewyng of myracles This is the cause why our moder holy chyrche / whā she wodel Canonyze ony saynte / fyrs¦te she enquyreth of the vertue of pacyence. Thenne of the shewyng of myracles / & that is for two skylles. One is for ma∣ny euyll lyuers haue do wond thynges / & shall do yt semeth myracles / all though they be none / as Symon magus dyd / & Antecryst shall do in hys tyme. Another is by cause som ther hath ben that haue do¦ne & shewed myracle by tue of our lord Ihesu / the whiche haue be dampned after¦ward as Judas / & all tho yu our lord spe∣keth of in the gospell / where he sayth that som shall stande on ye lyfte syde on the day of the generall dome / & saye to hym in ex¦cusyng of them self. Lord haue we not in thy name shewed & do wonderfull myra∣cles To whome our lord shall answere a∣geyne & say Go ye from me werkers of wickydnes / by thyse two skylles ye may vnderstonde ye holy chyrche in erthe may not only be certyfyed by myracles / whe∣ther ye {per}sone be holy or not / by whom they be shewed / all be it yt they shewe presump∣cyon of holynesse. And namely tho my∣racles that ben shewed after the deth of a {per}sone / for they were no sayntes / at whos graues myracles ben shewed. Yet were possyble yt our mercyable lord sholde ha∣ue them excused / & yelde them after theyr meke beleue / the whiche beleuen that they be sayntes. Not for them that ben there be∣ryed but for the glorye & the ioye of hys owne name / lest they the whiche beleue in hym be defrawded from theyr desyre wher¦fore our mod holy chyrche in erthe / that is gouerned by the holy ghost / desyryng for to be certefyed of tho merites of holy sayn¦tes as moche as it is possyble in this lyf enquyreth specyally of theyr vertuous ly∣uyng / & of tho thynges yt they wrought whyles they lyued in erthe. Soo our lord Ihesu hyr spouse taught hyr to do whan he sayd Ex fructi{bus} eo{rum} cognoscetis eos That is of hyr werkys ye shall knowe them / for it folowed aftward in the same place where that clause is wryten afore / yt a good tree may not bryng forthe euyll fruyte. What ben thyse fruytes. Trewely no thyng ellys but werkys of loue & cha¦ryte / bothe of god and of our neyghbours But by cause of these werkys of chary∣te / ryght as they be plesaunt to our lord / ryght so they ben dysplesaunt to the fende So that he is about in all yt he can & may for to lette the dedes of charyte / bothe by hym self & also by the worlde / that is by worldly lyuers. Wherfore it is full neces∣sarye to holy lyuers to haue pacyence & {per}ceueraūce yf they wyll be rewarded for theyr mede in blysse / by the whiche pacy∣ence they may conserue them & kepe them in good loue of god and of theyr good neyghbours / notwythstōdyng all maner {per}secucyons. Therfore it was that Saynt Powle assygned the fyrst condycyon of charyte pacyence whan he sayd. Caritas paciens est. That is charyte is pacyence Loo maydens this is the cause why oure moder holy chyrche in erthe / requyreth mo∣re after the pacyence of a saynte yf he shol¦de be Canonyzed thenne after the myra∣cles / for among all tuous werkys / yet pacyens is the grettest wytnesse of holy∣nesse. And this is sayd maydens be cau¦se that ye shold not be in doubte of this ho¦ly maydens holynes / for she had that ver¦tue of pacyence full blyssedly / As I shall tell you by the helpe of god & of your good prayers rehersyng all hir dedes of pacyen¦ce / by recapytulacyon of this hole legende namely for wery reders that thynken an houre in deuoute redyng is lenger than a
daye / and yf they were occupyed in tales & tryfles / thenne them semeth ye long day hort thenne an houre. Vnderstonde well maydens that this holy mayde Katherin {per}ceyued / that the v{er}tue of pacyence myʒt not haue his gracious werkyng in a sou¦le / but fyrst vnlefull thynges were reme∣uyd awaye from it / & namely suche vnle∣full thyngys that ben eytable to the lus¦tes of ye flesshe / wherfore or thenne she ca∣me to the age of ex{per}yence of flesshly lus¦tes. She emeuyd awaye myghtly all su¦che / as suche thynges that sholde styre hyr whn she came to age. And yet she dyd not this wythout Inspyracion / & notable vision of our lord by ye whiche Inspiracōn whan she was j yere of age / she saw our lord arayde as a bisshop sytting in a ryt fayre chambre ouer the chirche of the fere pechours / Wyth whome she sawe aso saynt Johan Euangelyst / & whyles she behelde our lord / he lokyd vpon hyr full be∣nyngly & mekely and blyssed hir. After this holy vysyon hyr soule was fulfylled wyth {per}ye loue / that she putte awaye all chyldren condycyons / & gaue hyr selfe a∣none to prayer & to penaunce / and therin she encrecyd {per}fytly / that in the nexte yere after / whan she was of vij yere of age she made a vowe of madenhode afore an y∣mage of our lady / not sodely but wyth grete delyberacyon afore / as it is openly declared in the seconde & the thrydde chapy¦tre of the fyrst {per}tye. Furthermore by cau¦se that this holy mayde wyst well that ab¦stynence was necessary for to kepe ye pur¦pose of maydenhode. Therfore she gaue hir to grete abstynence in hyr yong age / & {per}∣fourmed it meruayllously For as it is re¦herd in the thrydde chapytre of the fyrst {per}ye / & in the vj chapytre of the same par¦tye more largely the began preuely to le∣ue flesshe. And thenne as she encrecyd in age lytel & lytell / she lefte all maner etyn¦ge of flesshe / & therto she dranke no wyne but whan it was medled wyth watr / so that it had all most lost hys ast & hys co¦lour of wyne. And whan she was xv ye¦re of age / she lefte bothe wyne & flesshe / & all maner of metes out take brede & rawe herbes. Also whan she was xx yere of a∣ge / she lefte brede & took hir onely to dye∣tyng of rawe herbys / & soo contynued in that maner of lyuyng vnto the tyme our lord gaue hir a newe maner of gracious lyuyng / whan she lyued without ony ma¦ner of mete / & that was whan she was xxv or xxvj yere of age / as it is openly declared in the vj chapytre of the fyrst par¦tye / where is rehersed the cause & the ma∣ner why & wherfore she came to suche esta¦te And where also is answered suffycyen¦tely to them that grutched to that maner of lyuyng. Whan this holy mayde hadde thus fully ocome the styryng of synnes that she came to the {per}fyte vertue of pacy¦ence / as I shall tell you by the helpe of god The fyrst proue of pacyence that she had / was by hyr moder Lapa that wold that she had be wedded / whan she came to the age of xij yere. And whan that she sawe that she myght not brynge hyr doughter well therto / thenne she putte hy▪ out of hir chambre that was assygned to hyr afore of honeste / and putte hyr to all maner de¦foule of the kechen / that nother she myght haue lesyr for to praye ne for to haue me∣dytacyon ne contemplacyon as she was wonte / what pacyence she hadde in this {per}¦secucyons / and how gladde she was ther Inne / it is clerely declared in the fourthe chapytre of the fyrst partye. Meruayllous¦ly and vertuously alwaye she stode in the purpose of maydenhode / and yet serued the housholde wyth a gladde chere. And neuer for suche occupacyons and pryua∣cyons of hyr pure chambre she cessyd fro prayer and other ghoostly excercyses / vn
to the tyme she hadde ouercome bothe hyr persecucyons and hyr pursuers / as it is rehersed in the same fourthe chapytre / but yet ouermore / whan the fende styred hyr moder Lapa for to sette this holy mayde from holy dyscyplynes and wakynges / & also herde lyggyngs. Thys holy may∣de thenne wyth a myghty pacyence / and a meruayllous tempred ryght dyscretely hyr moders heuynes ageynst hyr. And yet neuerthelesse kepte forthe hyr harde∣nes of lyuyng / as it is declared in the vj chapytre of the fyrst partye fully ynough And moreouer what Impediment she suf¦fred in hyr sowle by the fende in tyme of prayer / and of other ghoostly excercyses / in tormentyng of hyr flesshe / and other al¦mes dedes that she dyd as it is openly she¦wed in many dyuers chapytres of thys legende afore as I shall declare to you. The fende besyed hym that he myght fyrst to remeue thys holy mayde awaye from hyr spouse Jhesu / afterward to wythdra∣we hir fully from hym. Or ellys at the las¦te for to lette hyr / namely for a tyme / but she wyth a myghty feruour fyrst ouerthre¦we hyr enemye the fende. Afterward by wytte and counseyll of the holy ghoost o∣uercome hym. At the last wyth stedefast vertue shamed hym / that was aboute to lette hyr. As for the fyrst the fende began to remeue hyr fro hyr holy purpose Fyrst by hyr suster Bonauenture / the whiche was wedded curyosyte of her here and clo¦thys / as it is declared openly in the four∣the chapytre of the fyrst partye. The secon¦de tyme by hyr brethern and hyr moder that were in full purpose for to marye hir as hit is shewed in the same chapytre. And the thrydde tyme by hym selfe / put∣tyng to hyr dyuers heuynes of temptacy¦ons / and dyuers Illusyons / or thenne she receyued the habyte of penaunce / as it is rehersed in the vij chapytre of the fyrst par¦tye. Also mayster Reymond of hyr besy∣de all this as he was enfourmed of other that were trewe folke / that in a tyme whā she prayed afore a crucifyxe of our lordes passyon / the fende stood afore hir hauyng in hys honde a clothe of sylke / and was aboute to araye hyr wyth the same clothe The whiche Illusyon of curyosyte she dys∣pysed and blyssed hyr and torned hyr to the crucyfyxe. After that the fende vanys¦shed awaye / but yet he lefte in hyr mynde temptacyon of curyosytre of clothyng. Thenne anone she hadde myne of hir pur¦pose of maydenhode / and spak to our lord in this wyse. Dere lord and swete spouse / thou knowest well that I desyred neuer husbonde but the Therfore I praye the hel¦pe me that I may ouercome these tempta¦cyons of curyosyte by vertue of thyne ho¦ly name. I axe not lord / that thou shol∣dest take them awaye fro me / but yt thou wouchesauf to gyue me the vyctorye of thy mercy. As soone as she hadde say∣de these wordes. Our blyssed Lady que∣ne of maydens apperyd to hyr syght / se∣myng to hyr syght that she took oute a ryght fayre clothe out of hyr sones syde / wyth the whiche clothe she arrayed hyr / And afterward she sayde to thys holy mayde thus▪ I do the well to wete dough¦ter / that the clothes whiche comen oute of my sones syde passen all other clothes in fayrnes and in beaute. Thenne alle hyr temptacyon wente awaye / and she was gretely comforted. As for the seconde the∣re the fende was about to wythdrawe hir fully from our lord / by wytty counseyll of the holy ghoost / she ouercome hym and lette hym of hys wycked purpose in that that she pesyd hir moder Lapa wyth gre¦te wytte cessyd hir of hir hastynes whan she was aboute for to lette hyr of hyr pe∣naunce
doyng / and contynued afterwar∣de neuerthelesse in hyr penaunce as she be¦gan▪ also whan she bare hir self so wysely to hir confessour & to other counseyllours the whiche counseylled hyr to leue hyr gre∣te abstynence and to lyue after a comyn¦dyete / as it is declared in the fyfthe cha∣pytre of the seconde partye And also wy¦sely and meruayllously she pesyd hir so∣ueraynes that forbode hir to go to places thyder that our lorde sente hyr. But yet she fulfylled goddes byddynges / and ese¦ly pesyd hyr soueraynes / what pacyence she hadde in this werke / ther can noo ton∣gue tell ne penne wryte. Furthermore the fende saw that he myght by noo why¦le remeue ne wythdrawe thys holy may∣de from hir deuoute purpose / he besyed him namely for a certeyne tyme for to lette hyr not onely by hym self / but by dyuers persones / the whiche shall be tolde you spe∣cyally wythinne forthe what they were. Fyrst by hyr owne moder Lapa that brought hyr to a bath for to be bathed / that she myght by that esy bath be wyth∣drawe for a tyme fro hyr sharpe dysciply¦nes / and from other hardenesse of penaun¦ce But yet she coude fynde ther more shar¦pe penaunce thenne in hir owne chambre whan she suffred the hote brennyng wa∣ter vpon hyr naked body / a it is rehersed in the seuenthe chapytre of the fyrst par∣tye. Also another tyme he wolde hadde lette hir by the byddyng of vndyscrete so¦ueraynes that were euer aboute to lette hyr from confessyon / from prayer / & from all other ghoostly exercyses / as it is decla¦red openly ynough in the fyrste chapytre of the secounde partye. Neuerthelesse somme shall I reherse here in specyall that ben not spoken of in the same chapytre. And all be it that somme thynges may not be rehersed here wythout shame of som Relygyous personys / the whiche were cō¦trarye to hyr holy purpose. Yet better it were that I rehersed them / thenne the gyf¦tes of the holy ghoost be hydde / where by ye maydens may haue loue and drede / bo¦the for to here suche trespasses of suche Re¦lygyous folke / and loue in seyeng of the vertue of pacyence in this holy mayde. This holy mayde Katheryne after ty∣me that she hadde sauoure and swetenes of deuocyon / she myght neuer do dede of vertue openly wythout sclaundre & bac∣bytyng of suche / namely that she sholde ra¦ther had fauoured hyr and comforted hyr therin / as ghoostly lyuers bothe of Rely∣gyous and seculerys / meruaylleth noo¦thyng here of / for as I sayde afore in the fyfthe chapytre of the secounde partye. But yf ghoostly lyuers quenche perfy¦tely hyr propre wyll of them self / they fall more cruelly in the dyche of enuye thenne other flesshely lyuers. As I putte an exsample therof. Of the monkes of an ho¦ly Abbotte Pachamye / that for the grete abstynence of a newe monke / that was come amonges them / they sayd theywold goo out of the momasterye / but yf that ne¦we monke were auoyded. Ryght so it befyll wyth this holy mayde. Alle the sus¦ters of penaunce sawe that Katheryne passyd them alle in hardenes of lyuyng / in sadnes of vertue / in deuocion of prayer and contemplacyon. Anone the serpente of enuye entred in them and styred them for to bacbyte this holy mayde / bothe pry¦uely and also openly to the prelates and the ordre wyth grete boldenes / & yet they that were holde moste sadde / helde wyth them and sayd that it myght not be ellys but tat she wrought all that euer she dyd in Belsabub the prynce of all deuelys. Thys womman by suche false sugges¦tyon drewe vnto theyr errour many sad
folke / bothe Relygyous and seculers / soo that by theyr counseyll thys holy mayde was ofte tymes lette from hyr confessy∣on and hyr confessour / and also from re∣ceyuyng of the blyssed sacrament / and all this she suffred pacyently wythout o∣ny grutchyng or playnyng. Rather sup∣posyng of them that so lette hyr / that they dyd it for an holy entente / and for the hel∣the of hyr soule / where fore hyr semed that she was ye more bounde to praye for them not as for hyr enemyes / but as for hyr specyall frendes. Yet aboue all this whan she was other whyle suffred to be house∣lyd / in receyuyng of ye blyssed sacrament of the aulter / they wolde not suffre hyr af∣terward to abyde long in prayer as she was wonte to do / the whiche was to hyr vnpossyble / by cause she receyued it wyth suche a passyng feruour of deuocyon / soo that euer soone after hyr spyryte was ra¦uysshed fro hyr bodely wyttes / and so she abode many houres to gydre / as it is de∣clared afore in the seconde and in the laste chapytre of the seconde partye As soo∣ne as she was aspyed in that wyse / som that were dysceyued by the forsayde sus∣ters wolde come Inne and drawe hir out of the chyrche / where ofte tymes she sholde lye in the sonne whan it was most hotest aboute mydde daye long tyme to gyders or thenne she cessyd of hyr rauysshynge and restored to hyr bodely wyttes. And ther wyth wepyng and waylyng somme▪ of hir susters that were vertuously styred to grace kepte hyr tyll she was restoryd. Also there came another man that ca∣me in a tyme and founde hyr lye there as a dede womman in rauysshyng / & wyth a grete angre he wente to hir and sporlyd hyr wyth hys feet. And whanne she was restoryd to hyr bodely wyttes agey∣ne / it was tolde hyr how she was ferde wyth / yet she wolde neuer blame hem ther¦fore / but rather excuse hem whan other spake euyll of hem. Neuertheles they we¦re punysshed of our lorde full harde / and that was a grete sorowe to hyr / saue she durst not long stryue ageynst hys ryght∣wysnesse. For in a tyme there was a la¦dy / that hadde grete Indygnacyon of this holy mayde whan she sawe hyr in suche rauysshyng / wherfore she came to hir and sporlyd hyr wyth hyr feet. But as soone as she was come home to hyr owne pla∣ce / she dyed wythout receyuyng of ony sa¦crament. There was also another wret¦che that sporled hir in the same wyse / whā she was soo rauysshed. And also was o∣ne of tho that one tyme bare hir out of the chyrche whan she was soo rauysshed full vyolently / but he was punysshed after∣ward that I am a ferde to tell it. Thys wretchyd man was soo enuyous and soo odyous to thys blyssed mayde / that not wythstondyng alle the formest cursed de∣dys that he shewed to hyr / yet he was a∣boute in a tyme for to kylle hyr / and ther was no thynge that letted hym / but one∣ly he hadde hyr not there he wold haue hir Thys holy mayde knewe noo thyng herof / but our lord Jhesu punysshed him therfore full sore / and that was in this wy¦se wythin a lytell tyme after / this wret¦chyd man / as he wente to a certeyn place he was take wyth the frensye that he cry∣ed nyght and day suche wordes / helpe me helpe me / for the hange man comet for to smyte of my hede. Other that were ny∣ghe hym and herde hym / they sawe that he was so from hym self comforted him that he sholde not be aferde / and for fere that he sholde slee him self / as he shewed by certey¦ne tokenes that he wolde / they kepte hym the more dylygently Soone after it se∣med that he was amended / so that he was
not kepte so dylygently as he was But pryuely anyghtes tyme he wente oute of the Cyte / and henge and strangelyd hym self meruayllouly. He took a corde and tyed it vpon the foote of a tree euen by the grounde / and that other ende of the corde he putte aboute hys necke / and soo wyth pure vyolence he slyded vpon the grounde and kylled hym self / as it was demed of them that founde the dede bodye was not beryed in holy place / but in the dongehyll as it was ryght semely that it sholde. By this maydens ye may kno¦we what vertue of pacyence this holy mayde hadde / and how pleasaunt hyr de∣dys were to our lord / that so auengyd hir wronges vnknowyng to hyr. ¶ Also yet shall I reherse to you by ma¦ner of recapytulacyon thre meruayllous thynges that be wryten in the fourthe cha¦pytre yt of secounde partye / by the whiche thynges ye may consydre that this holy mayde hadde passyngly the vertue of pa¦cyence. As for the fyrst it is wryten in the same chapytre of a leprose wom∣man that was called Secta lyeng in an hospytall / the whiche womman not onely lacked necessaryes but also a keper / for ther was none that wolde kepe hyr by cause of hyr lepre. Thys holy mayde herde here oft she wente to hir and was to hyr a seruaunt / and ordeyned gladly for all that she neded. Of this mynystracy∣on the syke leprous womman was prou¦de / and styred what she coude this holy mayde wyth many Iniuryes reproues & sclaundres puttyng ageynst hyr▪ But yet this holy mayde was so armed wyth myghty pacyence that she was noo thyn¦ge meued by hyr wordes / thenne the fen∣de sawe that he myght in noo wyse meue hyr from hyr merytorye seruyce / he enfec∣ted and desouled hyr hondes wyth the sa¦me lepre that the same leprous womman hadde / yet for that wolde she not leue / but rather desyred to be a lepre thenne for to leue hyr vnseruyd And so she contynued in hyr seruyce vnto the tyme she hadde be∣ryed that syke womman. And after¦tyme she was beryed / our lord by myra∣cle clensyd hyr from hyr lepre in hyr hon∣des. Charyte that is pacyence and be∣nyngne taught hyr for to ouercome alle this. As for the seconde / there is also wryten in the same chapytre of another womman that is called Palmarya / the whiche was one of the sustres of penaun∣ce. I shall tell you this womman Pal¦marya was hyghly sette in a wycked ha¦te ageynst this holy mayde / soo ferforthe that she dyffamed hyr wretchedly / wherfo¦re our lord gaf hyr fyrst a sykenes in hyr body. Afterward she began to perysshe bo¦dy and soule / so that she myght not esha∣e dampnacyon / but yf this holy mayde Katheryne by perfyte pacyence that cha∣ryte formyd in hyr soule / had prayed for hyr as it is rehersed in the same for the cha¦pytre of the seconde partye. Also there was another suster of penaūce / that was called Andrea as it is wryten in ye same chapytre / the whiche had in hyr brest a fou¦le stynkyng kancre / yt ther was neuer one yt wold minystre to hir for stenche Of this herde this holy mayde / & she cam to ye syke wōman & serued hir gladly without ony squeymousnes / in washyng & wypyng of hyr woūde / & whan she felte in hyr self ony maner squeymousnes she wold then put hyr nose to ye woūde long tyme to gy¦ds vnto ye tyme hir body defaylled / but ye lothenes went awaye ther by. Thenne ye fende Sathan entred in to ye syke suster / & made hir to grutche with this holy mayde & for to haue hir in suspeccion / & so wood she was wyth hir yt she sclaūdred hir open¦ly to hir susters & sayd that she had syn∣ned flesshely and loste hyr maydenhode.
¶ Al be it that this hooly mayden and vyrgyn was heuy of this shlaunder: yet she lefte neuer her seruyce to her / but ouer came by meke seruyse and myghty pacy ence her malyce / and wente to prayer as for a souerayn remedye agaynst suche ac¦cusacions / at the laste by grace of thys holy mayde and vyrgyns prayers and by ye merytes of her stronge paciēce / this seke suster sawe this holy mayde & vyr∣gyn in tyme of her prayers transformed a fore her in to a grete lyght that she had therby grete comforte and repented here of her fals accusacion Thā she called this holy mayde and vyrgyr to her and as∣ked her forgyuenes af her cursed accusa∣cion & all other to whom she had shlaun∣dred her / she sent after and tolde theym that she hadde falsely accused this hooly mayde and vyrgyn wherfore she asked theym forgyuenes / and thenne she tolde theym what she sawe of this holy mayde and vyrgyn affermyng to theym all that she was not only a pure mayde and vir¦gyn but also an holy mayde and vyrgin Loo dere frendes there the fend wente to the fame this hooly mayde and vyrgyn by his malycious excitaciō / there he mag¦nefyed her vertuous name alle agaynste his wyll: yet all this oure reuerend lorde almyghty god by medytacion of the ver¦tu of pacience that was in her / Then∣ne from that tyme forward this holy vyr¦gyns name encrecyd soo hyghely amon∣ges the peple / that it come to the audyen¦ce of two popes whiche were in her tyme and many cardynals / ¶ Ferthermore of another thinge I shal telle you the whiche is writen in the same chapyter of the same woman Andrea. It befell in a tyme whan this holy may de and vyrgyn wasshyd and wyped her stynkyng wounde / The fende made her so skeymous that her stomake was meruey lously steryd for to caste wyth that she aroos & saide to her sefl thus Trewely wretche thou that art soo skaymous off thyne susters sykenes: leue it welle thou shalt receyue the fylte of her wounde with in thyn owne body / Thenne she wente & wysshe that stynkyng wounde and recey¦ued the fylthe that came ther fro in to a dysshe and went a syde and dranke it of The nexte nyght after our reuerend lord apperyd to her and sayde: Doughter in this dede thou passyst in myn syngh / And thou hast therby pleasyd me more than in ony werke that euer thou dedest And therfore by cause thou hast doo soo merueylously a dede for my loue / I shal gyue the a merueylous drynke by the whiche thou shalt be hadde in grete mer∣ueyle amonge alle creatours wyth that as it semed to her he putt her mouthe to ye reuerend wounde of his swete blody sy∣de / And sayde doughter drynke ynongh of the drynke of myn syde that is mer∣ueylous and delectable bi the whiche not oonly thyn soule but thyn boody shal bee fulfylled the whiche thou hast despised for myn loue / Fro that tyme forword her so¦make had none appetyte to ony matery al mete ne it nyght not defye ony mete and that was none merueyle For wher that ony creature hath receyued drynke habundauntly of the well of lyf / what merueyle is it though it nede none helpe of other bodely mete / Oute of this gra¦ce came that merueylous faste the which is rehersyd in the fyrste Chapytre off the seconde party: Wherfore was all this grace graunted trowe ye dere fren∣des trewely for the charytable pacyens that she hadde to syke folke & to all other
