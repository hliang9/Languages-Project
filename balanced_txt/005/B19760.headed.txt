royal blazon or coat of arms C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT By the King. A PROCLAMATION For restoring Goods imbezzell'd during the late Fire and since. CHARLES R. WHereas the general amazement and distraction occasioned by the late dreadful Fire was so great, that many persons were surprised and overtaken by the Flames before they could get time or opportunity to remove any part of their Goods, and others who made a shift to remove some of their Goods, did yet do it in that haste and confusion, that they were fain to leave very much behind them, By reason whereof great quantities of Plate, Money, Iewels, Houshold-stuffe, Goods and Merchandize, besides many value∣able Materials for Building are daily found out and discovered amongst the Ruins of those several Houses which have been destroyed, to which nevertheless the true Own∣ers are still legally and rightfully entituled, and have in no sort lost their propriety; Nor will the finding of any Goods thus exposed excuse any Person who shall wilfully or feloniously take and carry them away from inturring the penalties of Law, which may in some cases extend even to the loss of life, and in all cases will extend to Fine and Imprisonment, besides the Damages which the injured party may recover by Action. And whereas also divers persons have notwithstanding adventured, and do still day∣ly presume to take, seize, and carry away whatsoever they can find or lay hands upon, which may be of any value or consideration, of whom some few may possibly intend to restore the same to the Rightful Owners as soon as they shall be known; And others may possibly have offended in this kind meerly through ignorance, not well understanding the nature of their Crimes in Law, nor knowing the dangerous consequences of their offences, nor the severities to which they are become lyable. His Majesty therefore to the end that all his Subjects may know the danger of the Law, and that they may be left without any kind of excuse or pitty if they bring the extremities of Law upon themselves, hath thought fit by this his Royal Proclamation to publish and declare, and doth hereby require and command all persons whatsoever who have seized or possessed any Plate, Iewels, Money, Houshold-stuffe, Goods or Merchandize, or any Materials for building not truly and of right belonging to them, that they do within the space of eight daies after this his Proclamation cause the same to be brought into the Armory in Finsbury-fields, and there delivered unto such Persons as by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen shall be appointed to receive the same, To the end the same may be Inventoryed and pre∣served there for the true and rightful Owners, and restored to them after the Charges of keeping the same, and a competent Reward to the Parties who found them and brought them in shall be first deducted, which Reward shall be assessed by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, or such other of the Court of Aldermen as by them shall be appointed, and the Names of the Parties who ought to receive the said Reward shall be duely Registred and Entred: And his Majesty doth hereby declare, That all Persons in whose possession any Goods or Merchandizes shall be found after the said Eight days expired, whereof they cannot prove themselves to be the true and Lawful Proprietors, shall be proceeded against in his Name and at his Suit, as persons that have broken the Peace, and possest themselves by Rapines and spoyle of other mens Goods, his Majesty being resol∣ved to punish these Crimes and offences with the utmost severities of Law, and then with the paines of Felony where the Case will bear it. And hereof all Iudges, Iustices of Peace, Mayors, Iurors, Constables, and all others his Majesties Officers and Ministers in all his Courts of Iustice and Publick Sessions are re∣quired to take notice, and to see that strict and effectual prosecution be had accordingly. Given at our Court at Whitehall the Nineteenth day of September in the Eighteenth year of Our Reign. God save the King.
