The most Deplorable Case of the Orphans of the City of London. WE have these Ten Years last past attended all Sessions of Parliament, humbly Imploring your Compassions, (for the Redressing the unexpressable Wrong we have sustained by the City of London, taking and keeping our Properties from us by force) this Honourable Assembly being the True Representatives of our Protestant Nation: We come with humble Confidence, believing your Honours will not send us away Starving; we find by long and doleful Experience, That the Court of Aldermen have secretly, and last year publickly opposed the Wise and Just Pro∣ceedings of this Honourable House towards our Relief, we can∣not but humbly hope that this August Assemhly, will be pleased to exert your own Prerogative in Extercating us from the Intolle∣rable Grievance we Groan under; We poor Fatherless Ones, be∣ing the Only Subjects that no Law yet extant can Relieve, the City having both Power, and our Portions, to defend themselves and thereby Ruine us. We humbly beg for Gods sake, who hears the Cries of the Fatherless, that your Honours will not please to let any more time elaps, but keep the day that is now appointed for our speedy Relief, that so no more of the Lives of Orphans may be lost, through Necessity and Want, which many have done since last Sessions; We tremble to think so much of this Sessions is spent, and that your Merciful Inclinations towards us, have yet had no Effect.
