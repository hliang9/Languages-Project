SOM SOBER INSPECTIONS MADE Into those INGREDIENTS That went to the COMPOSITION of A late CORDIAL, call'd A CORDIAL FOR THE Cavaliers. For the satisfaction of som, who mis-appre∣hended the Author. LONDON: Printed for Henry Brome, at the Gun in Ivy lane, 1661.
So Is mde Into those Ingredients that went to the C of a le Cll, call'd A Cordial for the Cavaliers. THe Author in the first place begi wih very rel Epi  the Calies, pg them i  of the iget Red that e  is capable of, which they my wll epect, for shewing themselfs, in such e  of , so good C, so good Sjcts, nd so good , towards their C, thir Kig, nd their C. Then the Author de by dgees to the o∣ther Res, which they tey may clim  due, from their King and Cy, g em, that their con∣dition is far from being dt, which words are equivalent, as if he h said they might rest cn∣fident, that they s  Rs fom the other t, therfoe    Intin o His Majesty, and the Palement, in order theru,
which hath produc'd no small effects since, for di∣vers Cavaliers, whose wants wer apparant and pressing, have bin releev'd, I say, ther is an Intima∣tion that the service of the Cavaliers being for the public good, 'Tis reason, (all the reason in the world,) they shold be satisfed o of the pblc , he∣of the Commons in Parlement are the Dispensers, therfore it is in Them, to furnish His Majesty to that end, and 'tis soly in the King to give public Rewards, In allusion whereunto, His Majesty ath bin pleas'd to say, Tht nne shd e the  to Rerd the Cavalirs but He imself. And y, n∣der favour, never any▪ Soin Pince   and honorable ground to conse ,  no sto∣ry can shew that ever any stuck so stoutly to their Prince and Principl s the le Cavaliers did, or e shew'd a clearer affectin, for they expo'd their lifes and livelihoods for Him, when, in the eye of uman judgment, hi case was desperat, the bels aving all the imagble advantag that could e, for they had the Ciy, the Sea, and the St on their side, yet the Cavaliers, transported by the fr  of loyal▪ hearts adher'd unto Him sill,  ith nding the hug disproption, ad inty  ngth; y▪ though they knew▪ He had no money to pay them, and truly ther's no Na∣tion
can parallel such a love; The German will speak high words of his love to the Keysar, the Spniard, and French will cry out Vivele Roy, but not one of them will stir a fot for King or Keysar, with∣out money, for their pay, and hopes of som recom∣pence besides; which the Spaniard▪ useth o claim as his due by the name of Ayl de costas; To this purpose ther is a notable passage that happen'd twixt P the Second and a Tledo Capain, who being return'd from the wars of the Netherlands, went to see the King, who was then at the Escurial. It was the Captains chance to meet Him (incognito) as he was a hunting ther, being alone, and stray∣ed from his servants, the King saluting the Cap∣tain ak'd him where he was going? he said, that he was lately returned from Flanders, with his Wounds and Scas about him to give Dn Pbelippe  account of his seices, and to demand a re∣ward of him; The King ask'd, whether he had his Salay payed him? , quoth he, I must confess I ve thugh I stayed somtimes long enough for i, but I am come now for an Ayd de costas, for som Reward besides; But, put case the King will not do it▪ th Captain answer'd, Voto a di ubs mi mula en el culo, If he will no let him kis my Me in the tyl; Thereupon the King with a smile ask'd his
name, who told him he was call'd Captain Ro∣drigo del Rio; The King said Senior Captain Ro∣drigo I see you are a stout man, the Counsel of war sits to morrow, where if you make your addres∣ses, and bring with you a sufficient certificat of your services, I shall procure you admittance to the King and Counsel, by giving your name to the door-keeper before hand; The next day the Cap∣tain being let in, and seeing the King with all the Counsel bare about him, the King told him, well Captain, do you remember what you said yester∣day, and what the King shold do to your Mule, if he gave you no Reward extraordinary? The Cap∣tain being nothing at all daunted, said, truly Sir, my Mule is ready at the Court-gate, if ther be occa∣sion. The King liking the stoutness of the man commanded 400. Crowns to be given him, and 2000. Rialls for an annual pension during life: The condition of the English Cavaliers is much more considerable, for the Spanish Captain had all his arreares pay'd him, which our Cavaliers have not; now, ther is no Atizan or Labourer whatso∣ever that deserves his hire, more then the Soldier, who besides his hard duties and toyle, ventures both life and lim for his wages. Then comes the Author of the Cordiall in an
humble way, to speak of His Majesties condition at present, how lightly the Coffers of the Crown are yet ballasted, what vast summes have bin ta∣ken out of them to discharge such indispensable arrears, and how unable he is to do what he so heartily intends, with what convenient speed he may; Then he gives a touch at some Roundheads that were rais'd, who, computed with the Civaliers, are not one for twenty, which, under favor, holds tru, take all professions together; for go to the Church ther are twenty five Bishops for one; go to Deans, Canons, Prebends, ther is forty to one; go to the parochial Ministers, wherof ther be above 9000. in the Land, ther is above fifty to one; go to the Universities, how many Heads of Houses, and Fellows of Colledges have bin thrust out, and Cavaliers put in their rooms? go to the City, scarce any Roundhead hath receav'd favor. The Lieute∣nant of the Tower and six Commissioners of the Custom house, with divers other Officers, all Cavaliers; go to the twelve Judges ther are ten to two; go to the Sargeants, with other Officers at Law, go to the Army and Life-guard; go to the Court above and below stairs, the odds more then twenty to one holds for the Cavalier: Tis tru, fom few are crept in into Offices, but 'tis for their
mon y, whereof I beleeve the King hath no know∣ledg (and 'tis only God Almighty is omniscious.) Touching those Lords of the Privy-counsel, I take leave to say, that we stood without the Curtain and could not see what was contriv'd within, for His Majesties coming over, where the Consultation of the said Privy counsellors with other choice Lords and Persons (that were the Kings Confidents to that end) did very much avail to bring the business about; though indeed, as the case then stood, it may be said that no humane wit or power, but it was pure Omnipoten ce which did the work: But let it not offend any to remember, that divers great Kings have bin enforc'd to raise and reward those that were once their very enemies for a time; The Kings of France, at the pacification of Nants, and the Treaty of Loudun, were, by Article, to confer honors, in lieu of punishments, upon divers who in open Field fought against them; and the last King was to remove his bosomest Counsellor from him, as Sillery, and others; that Hee shold approve of all actions pass'd as done for his service, &c. And all this by public Edict, which was verified by Par∣lement. In such a posture, it seems, were things in our Edward the Seconds time, when dining in Westminster-Hall upon a great Festival, ther
came a Minstrell-woman on horse-back to shew som sports, and going about the Table she left a paper behind, as Stow hath it in his Survey of London page 521. as also Daniel in his History of Edward the Second, which paper was as followeth, Our Soverain Lord the King hath nothing courteously respect∣ed His Knights that, in his Fathers time, and also in His own, have put forth their Persons to divers perils, and have utterly lost or greatly diminish'd their substances, to the Ho∣nor of the said King, and he hath enrich'd abundantly such as have not born the weight, as yet, of the businesse. The Author of the Cordial proceeds then to His Majesties great clemency, wherat som seem to except; 'Tis tru in som cases, That he who spares the guilty wrongs the innocent; And 'tis as tru, that th In∣nocence of a Cavalier is to be prefer'd before the Re∣pentance of a Roundhead; But the World knows what Rules of Mercy His Father (of ever blessed Memory) prescribes him in his sacred Legacies; Moreover, ther's a world of examples how, after a Civil War, such Acts of Indemnity, such Amne∣stia's and general pardons were granted of necessi∣ty, for if the Law were permitted to pass in such cases, the King might hang up half his Subjects; yet, it cannot be denyed, but that it is a very sad case, that one shold have my Horses in his stables,
my Hangings and Housh old-stuff in his House my Oxen in his plough, my Books in his study, my Jewels upon his wifes fingers, which he had rob'd me of, with other things, and that I shold not have the benefit of the Law to recover them; yet, touching that, let it be also consider'd how many hundred Cavaliers have bin restor'd since to their Real Estates, and Offices, which, though it can∣not be call'd properly a Reward, yet it is a cleer be∣nefit we receav'd by the Kings coming, which be∣nefit we were in despair of but twenty Moneths since. Then the Author goes on with som encourage∣ments, not as if he went about to read a lecture of patience, it being not only an unseasonable thing, but a peece of impertinency, to preach patience to those who are upon point of sinking or starving; as, God wot, too many of the Royalists are; only He gives a hint, that they shold stil keep up their spirits, ther being no doubt but that His Majesty being so sosible of their condition, and the Parlement being made up of so many Worthy and discerning Gentlemen, they will put Him in a capacity to take them into due and speedy consideration, as it is well hoped they will do upon their Re-accesse, 10 which purpose that Cordial may do more good then they are aware.
To conclude, he who with a sober and well∣biass'd judgment will examine that Cordial, will find, that ther is never a Line, Word, or Syllable therin, but breaths out the spirit of a perfect Cava∣lier, as above twenty other several peeces of the same Author publish'd upon Emergent occasions, do breath besides, ther is no fretful drug, or the least Corrosive dram in it, but all gentle lenitifs, therfore he wonders how it should stir up such Malignant humors in any, unless it were in them, who having somthing lying upon the stomack, made wrong use of that Cordial to cast it up. In fine, the Author of that Cordial is very con∣fident, that ther will be such a noble conside∣ration had of the Cavaliers, that they shall have cause to say to His Majesty, as the Grave of Fu∣stemburg said to Charles the Fift after the Wars of Saxony, who having don notable exploits in that War, and the Emperour acknowledging it, Sir, said he, If ther be occasion again, I will feed upon one arm, and fight with the other, to do your Majesty service. For the fuller Infomatrion of the Reader, the Cordial it self followes.
A CORDIAL FOR THE Cavaliers. Worthy, and Deserving Gentlemen, IN the Affairs and traverses of this life, it is a tru Rule (and 'tis a comfortable one). That he who dischargeth a good Conscience, of his Own, wherewith to reward Himself, though he receive no compensation from any where else: The World knows, and Envy it self doth ac∣knowledg, That in the late Confusions (which were of that length that might have shaken the fir∣mest Spirits in their Loyalty) you have discharg'd a Good Conscience three ways, towards your Creator, to∣wards your Country, and towards your King; your Religion bound you to the One, Nature to the Other, and your Alleageance to the Third; And although many of you have not yet receiv'd what you ex∣pected for the two last, yet touching the first (wher∣unto the other conduce) you are sure to have such a Reward one day, that will not onely be above all
Merit, but beyond all Imagination, in the Kingdom of Eternity. Adde hereunto, that I hold your Condition to be far from being desperat, but that you may receive rewards, at least som Consideration from the other Two, viz from your King and Country; For the present Parlement, which represents your whole Country, being compos'd of so many Wise, and well-weighed Gentlemen (wherof divers hath bin Co sufferers with you) will, as it is well hoped, out of a sense therof, have such reflections upon your Suf∣ferings and Services, both Active and Passive, that they will enable his Majesty, whom the Law stiles, The Fountain of Honor and Bounty, and wherof indeed no other Power shold partake with Him, I say it may well be hoped, that this Parlement, before their Recess, will put His Majesty in a Capacity, and humbly Advise Him, if not to Reward you, yet to Relieve your present wants in such a measure, that the Steed may not starve, while the grass grows. You know well that the King hath bin among us but a little more then the compass of one year, and his Grandfather Henry the Great of France, was above 7 years (which is an Age in our Law) before he could requite those, who stuck to him not much above 20 months, in making him Master of the
Elowerdeluces; You know the vast debts His Maje∣sty hath pay'd both by Sea and Land, which yet were not his own, nor his Kingdoms, but of that ac∣cursed usurping Commonwealth, which exhausted more of the publick Treasure, then all the Kings of this Land, since gold and silver was first coind in its you know He is so shortned, that He hath not yet provided bread for all of his own house; He is in such a condition, that He cannot give his Royal Aunt that treatment which might be expected; He hath not wherwith to go his Progress: Consider what vast expences his Fleets at Sea, his Life-guard, with other Garrisons do stand him in, as also what debts he drew upon himself so many years beyond the Seas, for his necessary subsistence, &c. Novv, vvhereas som object he hath revvarded Roundheads, Truly I believe if a Catalogue vvere made of those upon vvhom he hath confer'd Ho∣nor or Office since his Return, ther vvill be found above tvventy Cavaliers for one of any other upon vvhom he hath set any marks of Favour. 'Tis tru, albeit he came not in by the Presbyterian, yet he could not have come in without him so peaceably, though som alledg that vvhat the Presbyterian did, vvas not as much out of a Love to the King, as out of a Hatred he bore to the Independent, vvho may be said to have
us'd the Presbyterian a the Fox useth to deal vvith the Badger, vvho having found out his Chamber in the Earth,  o betrayeth it, that the Badger comes thither no more, and so the Fox makes himself ma∣ster of the hole. Wheras som except against his Majesties lenity, and indulgence, let them know that Mercy is the in∣separable Inmate of a magnanimous brest, and that the no∣blest way of Revenge is to forget, and scorn injuries; I have read in story, that one thing which made Lewis the twelf of France most famous was a Speech which drop'd from Him, when being ad∣vis'd by som of his Counsell to punish such and such as were profess'd Enemies unto Him while He was Duke of Orleans, He answer'd, That the King of France doth not use to revenge the injuries of the Duke of Orleans; no more (with most humble submissi∣on be it spoken) doth King Charles reset much the wrongs that were done to Charles Stuart. Therfore, Noble Cavaliers, possess your Souls with patience, we have a most gracious King who is in the Meridian of his years, and will live to re∣ward all in time. In the confus'd medley of mun∣dane affairs, the Proverb often is verified, Some have the happ, but some stick still in the gapp, Som have the fortune of preferment, som not, and 'twill be so to
the worlds end. The Author hereof though during the many yeers that he was in prison for his loy∣alty, had three sworn over his head in an Office of Credit that he shold have had de jure, yet it nothing discomposeth him, being more then in hpe of a compensation som other way. And as we have a Gracious, so have we a Glorious King, the most Glorious that ever wore these three Crowns, for all the eyes of Christendom are fix'd upon Him with a kind of astonishment and admi∣ration, and not only of Christendom, but of all the World besides, for 'tis written that the Great Tk shold say, If he were to change his Religion, he wold fall to worship the God of King Charles of England, who hath do such miracles for him, such miracles that no story can parallel: And certainly, God Almighty must needs love Him for whom he doth miracles: which that his Divine Majesty may continue to do, are the in∣cessant Prayers of 20 Iul 161.
