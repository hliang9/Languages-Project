AN ELEGY ON THE Death of that Learned and Famous PHYSICIAN Dr. RICHARD LOWER. Unhappy Age! That must at last resign A Soul so great, and so Adorn'd as thine: Adorn'd with all that former Times could shew; All that the Ancients taught, or Moderns knew. When the learn'd WILLIS dy'd, he did impart His utmost Skill to thy capacious Heart. Full well he knew, there was no other Shrine So fit to keep his Treasure in, as thine. So the Old Seer did to his Son dispense, A double Portion of Prophetick Sense, When in his fiery Chair he mounted hence. WILLIS Expiring, joy'd in Thee, to find He'd such a Legacy for Human kind. A Legacy more valuable far, Than both the Indies and their Riches are. They cannot to our Days one Minute give; But Thousands by thy powerful Art still live. And live thou wilt in them, till Time shall be Quite swallow'd up in vast Eternity. How many Millions did thy Art restore? Just to the Rich, and Tender to the Poor: In Consults serious, in Debating sound; Free in Advice, in Judgment most profound. Thy Friendship Courted equal with thy Art, Unenvy'd Greatness, and diffusive Heart; None ever did with more Success embrace The Peoples Wishes, and the Prince's Grace. Oh had kind Heaven, e'er thou from hence wer't hurl'd, Been pleas'd to lend Thee longer to the World? What lasting Monuments had'st thou design'd, Both to relieve and to support Mankind, When our wise King thy Worth and Parts had try'd, And found Thee fit for Armies to provide? Then gave Thee leave his Bounties to dispense, Best for thy Countries Honour, and thy Prince. And Reader, now would'st thou his Equal know, Go follow him, for there's none left below; Go, follow to that Blessed Place Above, Where all your Admiration will be LOVE. LONDON; Printed for E. Reyner. 1691.
