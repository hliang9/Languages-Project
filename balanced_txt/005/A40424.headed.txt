A NEW LETTER FROM WINDSOR, FROM A Person of Quality, TO HIS Friend and Correspondent at LONDON. Honoured Sir, THough it be a Matter of vast Moment, and migh∣ty Consequence to Rule well, and know how to dispose the Reins of Go∣vernment so justly to the Subjects Tempers, that neither the Mild be cast down, and trambled on, nor the Un∣quiet and Turbulent, through too much Remisness, become Insolent; the Loyal not discouraged, nor the Factious have Reason to rejoyce: A Task, which none but such to whom Nature hath given Understandings equal to the high Dignity, to which they are Born: such I mean, whom Providence thinks Wor∣thy to be its Vicegerents on Earth, are able to undertake, much less perform; Though I say, that Qui bene gubernat est Deo similimus, He that Rules well, is the Truest Image of his Maker; And Consequently, it may be thought an unpardonable Arrogance in me, to pre∣sume to meddle in a Matter as far a∣bove the Capacity of a Subject, as is the Almighty KING of Heaven above his Vice-Roy, amongst Us; yet is not any Man debar'd from declaring his Sentiments in such a case, so far as he neither pretends to Instruct his Prince, nor by prying into his Cabinet-Council, betray the Failings, or Derogate from the Authority of his Royal-Master, which has of late been the Deplorable Effect of too too many Pamphlets, whose Authors purpose, if truly Search't in∣to, was only to spread Sedition, and foment Rebellion; a thing so different from my Principles, that I had much rather desist from an Enterprize Emi∣nently hazardous, than either in Thought, Word, or Deed, injure my King, were He the worst of Tyrants, much less the present KING in whom concenter all those Vertues that Compound a Good, Pious, Just, and Merciful Prince; and make Him almost an Object of Ado∣ration, to all His Subjects that do not look upon him with Malicious, and (though Unjustly so) a Disaffected Eye. However, in this Juncture of Affairs, when the KING's Prerogative seems on all sides to be forgotten; and the Liberty, and Property of the Subjects, becomes the Chief Business of the Na∣tion: I think it the part of not only every Loyal Subject, but of all that can pretend either by Birth or Nature to be English-Men, to Vindicate their Prince, under whose Gracious Government, they enjoy all that either Subjects can Modestly require, or a King without Derogating from His Authority can Grant. Yet has it been the Endea∣vour of not a few Malignants to insi∣nuate into the Minds of the Ignorant, Unsteady People, a disliking of the present Government, perswading them that Arbitrary-Power is breaking in up∣on them, and that unless they quick∣ly stand up in Defence of their Just Priviledges, they will be for ever Sold to Slavery and Popery; two things as
generally Abominated by the Vulgar, as the Thoughts of an Inquisition; and I dare Aver as far from the KING's Intentions, as the introducing of Ma∣hometanism. But however, the KING is extreamly Oblig'd to them for their good Will, in taking such great Care of His Person; and for their unspeak∣able Zeal to make Him a Glorious Prince: But, How do they set about it? Even by Alienating the Hearts of His Subjects from Him; and by Pos∣sessing their unthinking Heads, with Groundless Jealousies of mighty Dan∣gers, from whence they know not; but, Who can be Ignorant that this is the ready way to make Him like His Blessed Father, a Glorious Martyr in this, and a King Triumphant in the other World? For they need but Cry out against Tyranny and Popery, and the Business is more than half Effected; Cry but Liberty, Liberty, and their needs no Drums or Trumpets to A∣larm them; for then they'l Swarm like Bees to the Banner of the Good Old Cause: nor shall they need Encourage∣ment to Fight the Lord's Battel; for there shall Arise in the Camp, Men that from the Pulpit shall Justify their Proceedings, and by Inspiration (no matter whether it be from Heaven or Hell) tell 'em 'tis Meritorious to Fight against, nay, to Depose Tyrants: a Principle so near a Kin to that bug∣bear Popery, that nought but their Ig∣norance and Illiterateness can Testify, that they were not brought up at St. Omers, or some other Popish Seminary. And when Matters are brought to this Head, when the Vulgar are Run Mad with Devotion; 'twill be very diffi∣cult to reduce them to their Right Sence of Loyalty and Allegiance: And when their Minds are Fermented in∣to a Lump of Rebellion, nought but the Mill of Oppression under a Grin∣ding Common-Wealth, can restore them to their first Purity. But Hea∣ven be Prais'd, things are not yet grown so Desperate, but that by Applying pre∣sent Remedies, the KING may Main∣tain his Prerogative, and the Subjects not lose their Priviledges; a Cure that can be perform'd by none, but a Mo∣derate, Sober Parliament; and such it lyes in the Peoples Breast to Choose, as neither prefer their own Priviledges so high, as to over-power your Reve∣rence to their King's Prerogative. We have been now near Three Years under the Sence of a Popish Plot, which has possest the People with so panick a Fear of the Popes Supremacy, that they have almost forgot the Alle∣giance, and to the greater Amazement of the World: At last, when every one seem'd so well Satisfied with the Truth of it, that none durst distrust it; that Party which seem'd most to Pro∣secute the full Discovery of it, and did with so great Zeal Persecute the Ac∣tors in it even to Death, are found Com-Plotters; and I doubt, are as deep in the Mire, as the other in the Mudd; for it has been the continual Practice of some of no low Degrees, to Hunt with the Hound, and Run with the Hare, one of whom has often serv'd as many purposes as he Looks ways at once. But I shall leave the Discove∣ry of that, to Providence and Time, when no doubt the People will be Sa∣tisfied, that striving to avoid Scylla on the one side, they run into Charybdis on the other; that shunning Popery on that hand, they betray themselves to the greedy Jaws of Phanaticism on the o∣ther; whose Proselites (not to abuse the Scripture Phraise) compass Heaven and Earth to Create new Ones, whom when they have Gain'd, they make Ten times more the Children of Hell, than them∣selves; and I hope, when the Curtain is drawn from before their Eyes, they will clearly See how they have Liv'd almost in Egyptian Darkness, and Be∣nighted with Ignorance, have been Led into the Paths of Eternal De∣struction. Having now pursu'd my purpose, as far as I believe my Readers Pati∣ence will hold out; I shall set down this, as an undeniable Maxim, That Loyalty, and Honesty is alwayes the best Policy; and they that make these the Pole-Star of their Course, shall never Split on the Rocks of Damnable Re∣bellion. Thus having given you in Short my Opinion, I remain in all Candour and Sincerity, Your, &c, Iohn Freeman. London, Printed in the Year, 1681.
