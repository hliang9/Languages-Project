His MAJESTIES Gracious Letter to the Parliament of Scotland, with the Speeches of the Lord High Commissioner, and Lord High Chancellor; Together with the Parliaments Answer to His MAJESTIES Letter. JAMES R. My Lords and Gentlemen, THe many Experiences We have had of the Loyalty and Exmplary Forwardness of that our Ancient Kingdom, by their Representatives in Parliament Assembled, in the Reign of our dearest and most entirely beloved Brother of ever Blessed Memory, made us desirous to call you at this Time in the beginning of Our Reign, to give you an opportunity not only of shewing your Duty to Us in the same manner, but like∣wise of being Exemplary to others in your Demonstrations of Affection to Our Person, and compliance with Our desires, as you have most eminently been in Times past, to a de∣gree never to be forgotten by Us, nor (We hope) to be contradicted by your future Practices. That which We are at this Time to propose unto you, is, what is as necessary for your Safety as Our Service, and what has a tendency more to secure your own Pri∣viledges and Properties, than the Aggrandising our Power and Authority (though in it consists the greatest Security of your Rights and Interests, these never having been in danger except when the Royal Power was brought too low to protect them) which now We are resolved to maintain in its greatest Lustre, to the end we may be the more en∣abled to Defend and Protect your Religion as Established by Law, and your Rights and Properties (which was Our Design in calling this Parliament) against Phanatical Con∣trivances, Murderers and Assassins, who having no fear of God more than Honour for Us, have brought you into such difficulties as only the Blessing of God upon the steddy Resolutions and Actings of Our said dearest Royal Brother, and those employed by Him, (in Prosecution of the good and wholsome Laws by you heretofore offered) could have saved you from the most horrid Confusions and Inevitable Ruin. Nothing has been left unattempted by those wild and inhumane Traitors for endeavouring to overturn your Peace: And therefore We have good Reason to hope, that nothing will be wanting in you to secure your selves and Us from their outrages and violence in time coming, and to take care that such Conspirators meet with their just deservings, so as others may thereby be deterred from Courses so little agreeable to Religion, or their Duty and Allegiance to Us. These things We considered to be of so great importance to Our Royal, as well as the Universal interest of that Our Kingdom, that We were fully resolved in Person to have proposed the needful Remedies to you, but things having so fallen out as render this im∣possible for us; We have now thought fit to send our Right Trusty and Right entirely beloved Cousin and Counsellour William Duke of Queensberry to be Our Commissioner a∣mongst you; of whose Abilities and Qualifications We have Reason to be fully satisfied; and of whose Faithfulness to Us, and Zeal for Our Interest we have had Signal Proofs in the Times of Our greatest difficulties. Him We have fully intrusted in all Things Relating to Our Service, and your own Prosperity and Happiness, and therefore you are to give him intire Trust and Credit as you now see We have done; From whose Prudence and your most Dutiful Affection to Us We have full Confidence of your entire Com∣pliance and Assistance in all those Matters wherein he is instructed as aforesaid. VVe do therefore not only recommend unto you, that such things be done as are necessary in this Juncture for your own Peace, and the support of Our Royal Interest, both at home and abroad, but also that you do them so speedily as may Evidence to the World that you are still in the same manner addicted to the Royal Interest, of which we had so much Ex∣perience when amongst you, that we cannot doubt of your full and ample Expressing the same on this occasion; by which the great concern We have in you Our Ancient and Kindly People may still increase, and you may transmit your Loyal Actions (as Examples
of Duty) to your Posterity. In full Confidence whereof We do assure you of Our Royal Favour and Protection in all your concerns. And so We bid you Heartily Fare∣well. Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the 28th day of March, 1685. and of Our Reign the first Year. By His Majesties Command, DRVMMOND. The Speech of the Lord High Commissioner. My Lords and Gentlemen, HIs Majesty has been pleased so fully and obligingly by the Letter you have now heard to intimate his Royal pleasure to you, as what I am to say seems in a manner superfluous, so I need not take up much of your time, nor shall I do more than touch a few things as briefly as is possible. And in the first place, my Lords, This being the day of His Majesties Coronation in our Neighbouring Kingdom, you see he is no sooner placed on the Throne of his Royal Ancestors than he inclines to have your advice in what may import the good of his Service and Subjects here; By which you ought not only to be convinced of the great confidence His Majesty has in the Loyalty of this his Ancient Kingdom, and their good Example to his other Dominions, but also how fully he makes good his Royal Word and Declaration, to follow (in his Reign) the Example of his late Majesty of ever glorious Memory un∣der whose Protection and Government we enjoyed so long Peace and Quiet; I say (my Lords) as by calling you so soon, His Majesty expresses great confidence in you, and seems still mindful of the Zeal and Affection of the last Parliament for the Rights and Pre∣rogative of the Crown, so (in a due return) it is not to be doubted, but you will upon this occasion not only exceed what has been formerly done, but also comply with all that can be proposed for establishing His Majesties Greatness and your own Security, and by this convince the World how sensible you are of the great honour His Majesty has allow∣ed you of being the first Parliament of his Dominions to do so. I am in the next place to tell you, that His Majesty is very mindful of the Duty and Loyal∣ty of this Kingdom to his late Majesty and himself, when he was here amongst us: And the better to compose the minds of his faithful Subjects, I am allowed to assure you of his Princely Resolutions to protect and maintain the Religion and Government of this Church as they are now Established by Law, and that he will take the Persons and Concerns of the Regular Clergy into his special Care and Protection; And in order thereunto, I am to give the Royal Assent to such Laws and Acts as can be reasonably proposed. I am likewise to let you know, That His Majesty will concernedly maintain your just Rights and Properties according to the Established Laws of this Kingdom, and will not allow of oppressive Arbitrary Proceedings in Souldiers or others, And further His Ma∣jesty being sensible of the great decay of our Trade, has warranted me in His Royal Name to consent to such Laws as can reasonably be proposed for recovery and improve∣ment thereof. And, my Lords, to conclude what I am to say on this Subject, His Majesty is so con∣cerned in the Encouragement, Welfare and Prosperity of this his Ancient Kingdom, as He will not only do what can justly be desired or expected for these ends, but even in Business of the Excise and Militia (his immediat concerns) I am warranted to go the greatest lengths for your ease and conveniency that the nature of these things can bear, and His Majesties Service and your own Security will allow. And, my Lords, His Majesty having in all things so evidently discovered his gracious inclinations for the good of this Kingdom, and given us the fullest assurances of his Fa∣vour and Protection that our hearts can desire, what suitable Returns and Acknowledg∣ments can we make to so excellent and imcomparable a Prince, who in all things relating to our quiet and prosperity prevents our very desires; So if during his Reign (which I pray God to make long and glorious) we be not the happiest people in the World, we have only our selves to blame.
And now the King having so fully done his part, it concerns you in the next place to mind yours; And in order thereunto, I make no doubt but you will assert the Rights and Pre∣rogatives of the Crown, and establish the Revenue as amply upon His Majesty and his Law∣ful Successors as it was enjoyed by the late King or any of his Royal Predecessors, since you cannot (in the least) doubt but his Royal care for your repose and security will rather exceed than fall short of any of his Ancestors. But to use any further Arguments to incite you to what is so much your Duty and Interest, were at the same time to question your Loyalty and Zeal for His Majesties Service, and your concern for the interest and honour of your Native Country whose Representatives you are, so I shall not injure you, nor lessen your thanks by saying more upon this Subject. My Lords, His Majesty certainly expects from the Prudence and Loyalty of this Par∣liament, that effectual ways will be fallen upon for destroying that desperate Phanatical and irreclaimable Party who have brought us to the brink of Ruine and Disgrace, and are no more Rebels against the King than Enemies of Mankind; Wretches of such Mon∣strous Principles and Practices as past Ages never heard, nor those to come will hardly be∣lieve: What Indemnities and Acts of Grace and Clemency have they not Contemned? And all the use they made of them has still been to harden and confirm them in their exe∣crable Villanies; and how inconsiderable soever they appear, assure your selves they ought not absolutely to be contemned; for if they had not support and correspondence not yet discovered, it is not to be supposed they could have so long escaped the care and vigilance of the Government: It therefore concerns you both in Honor and Prudence, no longer to dally with them, but that the utmost severities be most effectually applied, and all wayes taken, both to find out their Favourers and retired and secret Haunts. My Lords, I doubt not but all of you sufficiently know that some of our Nation are deeply involved in the late Horrid Conspiracy, who (and some others for other Treason∣able Crimes and Practices) are to be proceeded against before this Parliament; The Evidence of their Guilt I shall leave to its proper Place and Time, and do not doubt but His Majesties Advocate will manage that weighty matter with suitable care and faithful∣ness: So all I shall further say upon this Subject at present is, that if Almighty God (who watches over the security of Princes) had not Miraculously Discovered and disappointed those the most Hellish and Barbarous Designs that were ever contrived, in Place of that Peace, Happiness, and Tranquillity which we now Enjoy, these Kingdoms had certainly been at this day a Sea of Blood and in all imaginable Misery and Desolation; which (be∣ing evident beyond denial) will certainly provoke your and all good Mens Indignation and Resentment against those who can be reached, not only as Advisers and Contrivers of such Villanies, but Concealers of them: And since our Honour and Security every way seems absolutely bound up in the Life of His Sacred Majesty, ought we not most cheerful∣ly to grant what the Exigencies of His mild and gentle Government requires? Especially seeing what we give is still bestowed upon our selves, and for maintaining us in our just Rights and Possessions, against the most cruel and Barbarous Designs of His and our E∣nemes. And now my Lords and Gentlemen, in the last place touching my self I shall not say much, my unfitness for this Eminent station is possibly more obvious to me than to any of you; however since His Majesty has been Graciously pleased to place me in it, I am re∣solved to serve him boldly and firmly, and thereby labour to make up my other great defects: And as this has still been my Practice in the other great Trusts I have the Honour to carry under His Majesty, so I know His Goodness will always accept the sincere endea∣vors of His Servants in place of greater Performances. The Lord High Chancellor's Speech. My Lords and Gentlemen. AFter what my Lord Commissioner hath so well represented to you, it will be very little necessary for me to say much. I shall only take the liberty to put you in mind, (of what I believe you are very sen∣sible
already) of the many obligations this Nation lies under to be grateful to our great Monarch. When by the Command of the late King, His Majesty who now Reigns came first hither, what Disorders, Divisions, and Animosities found He amongst us? To bring the state of things into your prospect as it was then, could not be very grateful to you, nor pleasing to me, but we all remember with joy how well He left us, and by what easie gentle ways He brought about the Establishment of that Unity, which we were beginning to despair of: Since that time, how much we have been in His particular care, during the Happy Reign of that Excellent Prince His Brother, of ever Blessed and Glorious Memory, is known to all the World. But of all the instances of His Majesties Care for us, his Favour towards us, and his good Opinion of us, this of His calling us together in the very beginning of his Reign, (which God grant may be long and prosperous) that we might have the opportunity of present∣ing Him with the first Fruits of the Service of His Parliaments, and of becoming Exemples to His other Dominions, is the greatest and what we should prize the most, improving it as far as it will go. When we consider what strange turns the extravagant Follies of some, and the mali∣cious devilish Contrivances of others among us have taken, since the last Meeting of Parliament, what Convulsions have Attacted the Body of this Nation, and how vile a Ferment has raged in it, to have our Advice called for by our Prince, how to provide proper Remedies for it, is the greatest Honour could be put upon us. That we may do what in Duty we are bound in return, let us lay aside all private Aims and Ends; for how can we hope to serve His Majesty, or promote the Interest of the Nation, while our Eye is directed only towards our own particular? and let us with the Frankness and Cheerfulness of honest SCOTS MEN. use all possible means for Uniting of the Nation, and the driving from amongst us, whoever will not joyn with us upon such Terms as may conduce to the Advancement of the Honour and Interest of our King and His Crown, and the Well-being of this our Native Countrey, which we should not suffer to be defiled and rendred contemptible to the whole World by enter∣taining so Venemous a Bastardly brood of villanous men, as have of late, to the reproach of Scotland, and of Humane Nature it self, maintained Principles, and ventured upon Practices not to be named amongst any who have ever heard of a Government, much less of Religion. My Lords and Gentlemen. You all know what a Conspiracy hath been entered into by ill men of both Kingdoms, against the Sacred Lives of the late King and his present Majestie; and who but incarnate, Devils could think of attempting any thing against such precious Lives? For what Prince in Erop, or the whole World, was ever like the late King, except His Glorious Brother who now Reigns? and to have cut off any of them, had been barbarous to a degree of making us appear more abominable then any people ever were, but for us to have lost both, had been our utter ruine. Yet against both was the design laid, and had suceed∣ed, if that watchful Providence, which hath often preserved the two Royal Brothers in so many difficulties, had not defeated the success, by an un-fore-seen accident, and had it succeeded, what Confusion, what Cruelty, what Blood, what un-expressible Misery had overflowed these Kingdoms? But besides this, we have a new Sect sprung up amongst us from the dunghil, the very dregs of the people, who kill by pretended Inspiration, and in stead of The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, have nothing in their mouths but The Word of God, wresting that blessed conveyance of his Holy Will to us, to justifie a practice suggested to them by him who was a Murtherer from the beginning, who having modelled them∣selves into a Common-wealth, (whose Idol is that accursed paper the Covenant, and whose only Rule is to have none at all) have proceeded to declare themselves no longer His Majesties Subjects, to forefeit all of us who have the honour to serve him in any considerable station, and will be sure ere long to do so by this great and honourable
Court. It is how to rid our selves of these men, and of all who incline to their Princ¦ples, that we are to offer to His Majesty, our Advice, Concurrence, and utmost Assi¦ance. These Monsters bring a publick reproach upon the Nation in the eyes of all Neighbours abroad, while in their Gazets we are mentioned as acting the vilest Assass¦nations, and the horridest Villanies, they render us unquiet and unsecure at hom they bring Reproach upon our Religion, and are our great plague. Let us for the sake of our Allegiance, for His Majesties Honour, for our Reputatio abroad, for the vindication of our Religion, and for our own Peace and Tranquillity make haste to get our selves cured of it. If this were once effectuated, we might yet hope for quiet, and in order to the mak¦ing our quiet the more comfortable to us, when once we are come to a Resolution abou what relates to the publick peace, and to the respect we owe to His Majesty, we may have occasion of considering what Laws may be necessary towards the facilitating th well-governing of our selves and Native Countrey, both as to the regulating our Carriag one towards another, and the securing our Estates, from any thing that may be unea from the distribution of Justice between man and man, as to the improving of our Trade and Commerce abroad, and encouraging Industry and Frugality at home; for in all these things His Majesties care will not fail us. And my Lord Commissioner amongst his ma∣ny other advantages, is so well known to be a lover of his Countrey, that we need not fear, but that He will give his Concurrence in what He is allowed so freely to consent to. My Lords and Gentlemen. To encourage us to do all we can towards the service and the Honour of our Glorious Monarch, let  consider Him in all His Personal Advantages, whether in what relates to War or Peace, where has the World afforded such another? One whose Natural En∣dowments have been improved by his great experience, at home and abroad, in Ar∣mies and Courts, by the greatest tryals of the most differing kinds; those of prosperity and success, and of adversity and opposition, of hazards and toyle, and of Authority and Command in the strictest adhering to His Word; such Temperance and Sobriety, so indefatigable a diligence in Affairs, so Undaunted a Courage upon all occasions, and so unwearied a Clemency towards the most obstinate malicious Offenders? Did ever Heroe compleat the Character so fully, in over∣coming bravely, and shewing gentleness to the vanquished? And I must say, the Tri∣umphs of His Patience are not His obscurest Glories; nor is the forgiving of those whose virulent Tongues, would have Tainted his Fame, if their malice could have reached it, what is least to be admired in him; what Reputation other Princes have laboured for, at the vast extent of Blood and Treasure, and the putting of a constant constraint upon themselves, sits so easie upon Him, that what they would have, He forces from the Con∣sciences of his very Enemies by His Merit, and it costs Him no more than to be Himself But this Theme is not for me, I do Him wrong, and while it may be at this very mo∣ment, He is receiving the Acclamations of His good Subjects, in the chief City of our Neighbour Nation, at the great Solemnity of His Coronation there, I am detracting from Him here, by giving him too low a Character. I shall onely add, that He gave to Subjects the greatest example of Loyalty and Obe∣dience while He was one Himself; and now He is an example to all Kings in His Love, His Clemency, and Care towards his People. Let us give Him the return of our Love, our Fidelity, and our Obedience. And seeing He takes pleasure in nothing so much, as in our felicity and prosperity, let it be an additional tye upon us to advance His Honour and Greatness, by all the endeavours of our Lives, without reserve, and with our whole For∣tunes, which under His protection we may (if we please) so peaceably and comfortably enjoy.
The Parliaments Answer to His Majesties Letter. May it please your Sacred Majesty. YOur Majesties gracious and kind remembrance of the Services done by this your ancient Kingdom, to the late King your Brother of ever-Glorious Memory, shall rather raise in us ardent desires to exceed whatever we have done formerly than make us consider them as deserving the Esteem your Majesty is pleased to express of them, in your Letter to us dated the 28th of March. The death of that our excellent Monarch is lamented by us to all the degrees of Grief that are consistent with our great Joy for the Succession of your Sacred Majesty, who has not onely continued, but secured the Hap∣piness which His Wisdom, His Justice, and Clemency procured to us: And having the honour to be the first Parliament which meets by your Royal Authority, of which we are very sensible, your Majesty may be confident that we will offer such Laws as may best secure your Majesties Sacred Person, the Royal Family and Government, and be so exemplarily Loyal, as to raise your Honour and Greatness to the utmost of our power, which we shall ever esteem both our Duty and Interest. Nor shall we leave any thing un∣done for extirpating all Fanaticsm, but especially those Fanatical Murtherers and Assassins, and for detecting and punishing the late Conspirators, whose pernicious and execrable de∣signs did so much tend to subvert your Majesties Government, and ruine us and all your Ma∣jesties faithful Subjects. We can assure your Majesty that the Subjects of this your Majesties ancient Kingdom are so desirous to exceed all their Predecessors in extraordinary marks of affection, and Obedience to your Majesty, that (God be praised) the onely way to be Popular with us, is to be eminently Loyal. Your Majesties care of us when you took us to be your special Charge, your Wisdom in extinguishing the seeds of Rebellion and Faction amongst us, your Justice which was so great, as to be for ever exemplary, But above all, your Majesties free and cheerful securing to us our Religion when you were the late King your Royal Brother's Commissioner, now again renewed when you are our Sove∣raign, are what your Subjects here can never forget. And therefore your Majesty may expect that we will think your Commands sacred as your Person, and that your Inclina∣tion will prevent our Debates. Nor did ever any who represented our Monarchs as their Commissioners, (except your Royal Self) meet with greater Respect, or more exact Observance from a Parliament, than the Duke of Queensberry (whom your Ma∣jesty has so wisely chosen to represent you in this; and of whose eminent Loyalty, and great Abilities in all his former Employments, this Nation hath seen so many proofs) shall find from, May it please your Sacred Majesty, Your Majesties most Humble, most Faithful, and most Obedient Subjects and Servants, In name of the Parliament, Sic Subscribitur, PERTH Cancell. I. P. D. Parl. At Edinburgh the 28th of April, 1685.
