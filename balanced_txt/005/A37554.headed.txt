THE East-India Stock in the Companies Books stands as Principal about 740000 l. and no doubt of its being worth that. Now, to end all Disputes about adjusting its Value, which to do justly, if it be not impracticable, will create much of Trouble and be inconvenient at least. As also to avoid (the otherwise unavoidable Complaints) which will inevitably follow the new, (as intended) Sub∣scriptions, where the first come must be served first; and where to make the Trade (as Proposed) National, there will not be room for half so many to Subscribe, as may Desire to do so, and so more will remain to complain of, being therein left out than now do; And that the Trade may go uninterrupted on; Suppose, By way of Proposal, 'twere Asked of the Company, (who being tied up by the Votes, dare make no Proposal themselves) Whether they will not be willing, on being settled by Act of Parliament, under such Regulations as have been Voted, (the Subscribing part only except) to Agree; That from 740000 l. their Stock should be made up a Million by Exposing by the Candle to Sale of 260000 l. and of the Money that will bring in to Let 260000 l. go to the Government, and to take what more it will yield to the Stock, and that will be 260000 l. Ready Money, and possibly very much more: And 'tis not to be doubt∣ed, but were this Proposed, the Company would be wise enough to Comply with it. And thus, It ends all Disputes. It lets the Trade quietly and uninterrupted go on, and under the Regulations intended. It brings 260000 l. to the Government, and the same Sum (if not more) to the Stock. It gives an Opportunity to any to come in to the Stock, as will give as much as 'tis worth to do so. And Leaves none to complain but such only who very gladly would come in for less.
