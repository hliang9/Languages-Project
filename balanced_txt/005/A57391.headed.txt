THE TREASURE OF TRAFFIKE OR A DISCOURSE OF FORRAIGNE TRADE. Wherein is shewed the benefit and commoditie arising to a Common-Wealth or Kingdome, by the skilfull Merchant, and by a well ordered Commerce and regular Traffike. Dedicated to the High Court of PARLAMENT now assembled. BY LEWES ROBERTS, Merchant, and Captaine of the City of LONDON. LONDON, Printed by E. P. for Nicholas Bourne, and are to be sold at his Shop at the South Entrance of the Royall Exchange. 1641.
TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS IN THE High Court of PARLAMENT now assembled. PArdon me Right Honourable, if amongst your other more se∣rious present affaires, I presume to dedicate to your acceptance and perusall this short discourse of forraigne Traffike: It hath ever beene ac∣counted a branch of Englands Royall Stem, and a commoditie, that for many yeeres, hath brought a wonderfull Revenue to Englands Diadem; It now presseth to your presence as an agrieved weight, laden with many set∣ters, imposed thereon by the covetousnesse of some, and by the Envyers of our prosperous Traffike, yet seeing that like religious Pilots you guide the helme of our Kingdome with
your hand, whilst your eyes are fixed on hea∣ven, taking from thence the conduct of your earthly directions, it hopes by that your good and gracious aspect to be now freed from them all, and florish againe in its fist lustre. It is now about forty yeares since it began to be ingrafted in our English Climat, and ever since found our soyle proper for is further grouth, but if it find not your Ho∣nors favourable protection and future che∣rishing, a few yeares more may see it withrd and reduced to its first nothing, I dare not undertake in this discourse to demonstrate the burthens that cloggeth it in this King∣dome, the severall Societies of incorporated Merchants of the Citie of London being called before you, will best particularise he same, onely I have labour'd to shew, what may best gaine it in those parts of this King∣dome where it is wanting, and augment that portion thereof in those places where it is settled already. Let not then, Right Hono∣rable, so excellent a Jem, and so hitherto profitable and eminent a revenew, for want of a little of your helpe, die in your dayes, nor yet perish in our age, but release it from those subtle Gives, that cunningly have beene intruded upon its liberties, and goes about to kill the root thereof, decking it once againe as primarily, with some of those lasting & beautifull immunities that can
and may make it live longer, and spred it selfe much fairer, that the times to come may de∣servedly attribute to your names and memory that splendor & glory it shall obtain by your benignity, so shall the King, our gracious Soveraige, have just cause to commend your care for your preserving to Himselfe and Kingdome, this so noble a Royalty, your Honours be justly applauded for imploying your industrious hands and heads in pruning, and lopping the disordered branches of so ex∣cellent a graft, and the Merchants of this Kingdome that have hitherto sowne in Expe∣ctation, live in hope to reape a fruitfull crop of their foraigne adventures, and hartily pray for the good successe of all your other weigh∣ty affaires, and amongst the rest, so shall ever ascend the devout Orisons of Your Humble Servant L. R. Merchant of London.
To The READER. COurteous Readers, It is needlesse for mee here to tell you, how good a common wealths man a Regular merchant is, nor yet trouble you in relating the severall benefits accr∣ing to a Kingdome, by his adventrous paines and in dustry, this short discourse, though unpolished, if well considered, will I hope sufficiently speake the one, and questionlesse make good the other. My well-wishes to our Countries present Commerce, and the enlargement thereof, the great need in the encouragement to the one, and the insensible ruine and decay of the latter, was herein, and still is my greatest hope and obiect: I have late∣ly discerned that our industrious Neighbours were ready at a deare rate to purchase that trea∣sure by Traffike, which wee our selves, by means of the enviers of our Countreys foraigne Trade, were ready to yeeld them gratis, and as it were unsought, and for nothing; yet if it may be right∣ly said, as undoubtedly it may be accounted, that Englands trade, is Englands treasure, why should our gracious King and his people lose that so excellent a profit in a moment, which cost his
Merchants so many yeares to compasse, and so many hazards and charges to obtaine and set∣tle, a few priviledges, and a little protect on, a faire aspect, and a gentle encouragement, from both these honourable assemblies, will quickly set∣tle this Kingdomes Traffike, and not only preserve it in its present splendour, but also easily augment and enlarge it, wih will adde a wonderfull ho∣nour to our Soveraigns Name, throughout the World, and an eminent commodity and profit to the subjects of all his Dominions, which every true subiect I thinke doth earnestly wish for, and every honest Merchant doth truly pray for, as doth un∣fainedly, Lewes Roberts, Merchant, and Captaine of the City of LONDON.
THE TREASURE OF TRAFFIKE. THat we are not borne for our selves, is a saying no lesse ancient, then true: the hea∣thens as well as the Christi∣ans have held it a rule worthy to be pra∣ctised,No Man is born for him∣selfe, but for his Countrey. and every good man, of what quality and profession soever, that will give evidence to the world of his faire intentions, for the benefit, either of the publike or private, are daily seene to fol∣low and observe it. The religious Divine, that with much labour and long study, having learned himself the wayes of Godlinesse, is daily noted to take care and pains, to instruct others therein: the valiant soulder that
weares hi sword to dfend himselfe, yet is ever ready to draw the same in de∣fence of his Countrey; the skilfull Law∣yer, that hath learned by the Lawes to make good his owne interest and right, is ever also ready to right the title of o∣thers▪ and the judicious Merchant, whose labour is to profit himselfe, yet in all his actio, doth there with benefit his King, Countrey, and fellow Subjects. Politicians that have written of State Government, Three ways whereby a Kingdome is inriched. have observed three prin∣cipall meanes, wherby a Kingdome may be inriched, the first whereof is by arms and conquest, but this way must be con∣fessed to be, both chargeable, bloody, & hazardable. The second is, by planting of colonies, building of well scituated Townes, and the like, and this is also ac∣counted uncertain, chargeable and tedi∣ous. But the third and last is by traffike, and foraign trade, which is held the most certain, easiest, and soonest way; money and time must bee consumed to effect the two former; but immunities, privi∣ledges,
and liberties to the Merchant, wil not only assure, but perfect the latter. In the management of these,The Arts∣man is still th bst coun∣sllor in his ow profssi∣n. there is re∣quired an orderly proceeding, and Salo∣mons counsell is the safest, that his advice is stil to bee taken, who is best versed in the way that is prescrib'd; when our sal∣vation is doubted, we apply our selvs to the learne Divine; when our countrey is invaded, the souldier is the best dire∣ctor: when lawes are to be instituted, the lawyer proves the best counsellor: so when a Countrey is properly seated for traffik, and the soveraign willing, by fo∣raigne Commerce to inrich his King∣dome, the Merchants advice is question∣lesse best able to propagate the same. To inrich a Kingdome is a worke of great excellency,Parents la∣bour to inrich thir posterity and fittest the study of the Soveraigne, and where many things may concurre to effct it, that only is to bee chosen▪ which is most facile, and least troublesome. Many men plant trees, though they are sure never to see the fruit therof, & thus the child oftimes enjoyes his predecessors labours.
King Henry the eight did enjoy the be∣nefit of Henry the seventh, and other his Fathers and Predecessors prohibition of the exportation of our English wool, and the setling of cloathing here, and the drawing of Flemings hither, to make our manufacturies in England, and this turned him and his Kingdome to more profit then the suppression of so many religious houses, and the annexi∣on of so many old rents to his Crown. Edward the sixth,Edward the sixth, his Sta∣ple of Trade. though in his infancy, yet saw how those haunse-townes flou∣rished, where his English Staples were setled, and had he gon forward with his design, of setling the same in England, in apt and sit townes, for traffike, as hee once intended, doubtlesse it had bin the most politick and surest way to in∣rich his Countrey, as ever had bin put in practice since the conquest, and his successors should have seene the fruits therof, in the opulency of their Towns, the riches of their Countrey, and abun∣dance of shipping, as now Holand doth witnesse unto us.
The consideration of this,The scope of this discourse for the benefit of England, and their Traffike. and my wel-wishes to the inlarging and benefit∣ting of my Countrey by traffique, and for the advancement of the Merchants thereof, hath drawne mee in this short Treatise to set downe in a briefe manner, the commodities, that doe arise to a Common-wealth, by skilfull Merchants and by a wel ordered and regular trade, and Commerce, therewithall shewing, how this Commerce may be facilitated, and how disturbed, how advanced, and how ruind, and how by the good go∣vernment therof, it may prove both pro∣fitable and honourable to a Countrey, and how by the ill management and irregular courses thereof, it may bee both prejudiciall and dishonourable. Statists have noted,No one way more condu∣cible to inrich a Countrey, then is for∣raign traffick. that the Arts and Sciences are very many, that are commo∣dious and beneficiall to a Common-Wealth, and which consequently beget abundance, wealth, and plenty, not on∣ly to the Prince in his owne particular, but also to his people and Countrey in
the generall, but yet amongst all others they confesse none is more conduceable thereto, then Traffike and commerce especially when the same is govrned and managed, both by well ordered rues, and by regulate and skilfull Mer∣chants; and to the end, that the youth of this Kingdome, may be incouraged to undertake this profession▪ the painefull Merchant cherished in the prosecution thereof, and the Prince induced to give them imunities and protection: the par∣ticular commodities and benefits, and commodities that arise by Traffike, shall be here demonstrated, and if by my discourse the same shall be ound re∣ally such, as by me and others it is con∣ceivd and here aleaged; the same may in the future be the more furthered and protected, and being found otherwise, it may as in reason it ought, bee both dis¦countenanced and suppressed. Now the aboundance,The riches consist in 3 thing. plenty, and ri∣ches of an estate or nation, may be said, principally to consist in three things.
1. In naturall commodities or wares. 2. In artficial commodities or wares. 3. In the profitable use and distribu∣tion, of both by Commerce and Traffike. Vnder the title of naturall commodi∣ties,Naturall commodities or wars, What. may be comprehended, such wares as are used in way of merchandizing▪ & are such as either the earth doth natural∣ly & originally afford, or such as by the labor of the land is brought forth, and these I account the naturall riches, that bring plenty to a Kingdome or Coun∣try. Now the earth in it selfe may be said,Nturall commodiie o 2, sorts. to produce two severall sorts of naturall commodities, thence drawne from the very intrailes thereof, such as is gold sil∣ver, copper, lead, and the like. The se∣cond are wares growing on the face thereof, such as are fruits, trees, graine, &c. and both these I terme naturall commodities, as produced either by the benefit of the Climate, soile, or tem∣perature of the earth, where the same are taken up, planted or found growing,
and doe become thus to inrich a Coun∣trey, as a man would say, of themselves; but yet by the meanes of Commerce and Traffike,How they in∣rih a Coun∣try. contributing thus naturally to the benefit and use of the inhabitant, and to the furtherance of universall Com∣merse; those things whose plenty (o∣therwise without Traffike, and trans∣port to other Countryes, where such is wanting) would prove altogether fruit∣lesse, unnecessary, and peradventure pre∣judiciall unto the owners and possessors, and this hath bin manifested in some parts of those rich Kingdomes of India, some years past, by their great quantity of spices, drugs, and lemmes, which, not by the Commodity of Traf∣fike, carried thence away, exported and vented into other parts, and to remoter Countries:Naturall Commodities are pejudici∣all to a Coun∣trey, without the help of Traffik. these excellencies which na∣ture herein afforded them, would be pre∣judiciall to them, and their ground o∣ver-laid with sundry (though otherwise) excellent trees, and exquisite Minerals, whose fruit or worth would thus not be
requested nor sought after, neither by their neighbours, nor yet by foraigne Nations, where the same are wanting, and which would consequently no way benefit a Countrey, nor yet by Com∣merce and commutation, supply them with those things in lieu thereof, that they in their necessities stand more in need of. Againe,The bene∣fits of the Earth neg∣lected by▪ whm, and how. the earth, though notwith∣standing it yeeldeth thus naturally the richest and most precious commodities of all others, and is properly the foun∣taine and mother of all the riches and abundance of the world, partly as is said before, bred within its bowels, and partly nourished upon the surface there∣of, yet is it observable, and found true by daily experience in many countries, that the true search and inquisition ther∣of, in these our dayes, is by many too much neglected and omitted, which indeed proceedeth from a li∣berty that every man hath to doe, with that his owne part thereof, which
he possesseth what he pleaseth, propo∣sing commonly to himselfe, a care to find out that which will bee most pro∣fitable to him for the present time, and because the rich and great of this world, and those that possesse the geeatest part thereof, are seldome or never seene to reside upon their whole estate, nor yet found to husband their owne good, farther in this point (either by their ser∣vants or themselves) then by a present benefit and quickest profit, their farmers and tenants are oftnest observed to occu∣py the same; who like gleaners, sucke and draw thence the present profit and daily benefit thereof,The Farmers eate the mar∣row of the earth, to the prejudice of the owners. eating up the heart, and marrow of the same, with greedy art, and continuall labour, not minding, or indeed not regarding the future interest and good of the pos∣sessor: & on the other side, where we find the owners themselves to reside up∣on their owne, yet tis observable, that some of them through Igno∣rance, some by negligence, and too
too many by bad husbandry, content themselves with the yearely rents there∣of, or at most with the Revenues, that their predecessors drew therefrom before them; as being loath to take the paines, either by industry, improve∣ment or care, to increase those their demesnes and estates, either by plan∣ting, cleansing, or manuring a waste or barren piece of ground, or by dray∣ning a marshy bogge, or the like, and thus to inrich themselves by a faire ad∣vancement of their own: which in some forraine Countryes, hath of late dayes taken such effect, partly by good or∣ders, but especially by example, that Princes themselves, and States have thought it a worke worthy their owne paines,Sundry Prin∣ces have stu∣ied the a∣vancment of their estates. and study, as the late labours of the State of Venice in Polisona de Rovigio, of the Duke of Toscany, a∣bout Leghorne: Pisa and Creso, of the Duke of Ferrara in the Valley of Coma∣chio, of the States of Holand, in sun∣dry and diverse parts of the Low-Countryes
Countryes doe manifestly witnesse, which hath wrought such good effect, that they have thereby much benefitted themselves and subjects, and by this meanes, have quickned the diligence of the industrious, and punished the negligence of the sloathfull,No commodity can inrich a Countrey, without the helpe of Traf∣fike. yet not∣withstanding all the laborious hand, and paines of man, to plant, sowe, or bring things growing in, or upon the earth, to their perfection; the ex∣cellent temperature of Soile or Cli∣mate, to bring forth either Jemmes, Spice, drugs, or grains, naturally pro∣duced from it, and whatsoever else the bounty and goodnesse of the Earth can naturally, or by labour yeeld or affoord to mankind; yet it must be here conclu∣ded, that all this would, neither in it selfe, inrich the inhabitants, nor yet bring abundance to a Kingdome or estate without the benefit of Commerce, and Traffique, which distributeth the same into foraine parts, and by commutation with forraign Nations, convert this
naturall bnefit of the Country, to the common benefit and plenty of those that are found to possesse, inhabite, and abide thereupon. The second thing which I observed,The artificiall wares and commodites of a Countrey, what. that did inrich a Kingdome, is by ar∣tificiall commodities and wares, and these by a generall title, I may call the manufactories of all commodities. In which two principal things are con∣siderable,2 Considerable points therein. conducing to universall Traf∣fike,1 The number of work-men. and to the benefit of a Kingdome. First the number of the work-men,2 Their abili∣ties. or Arts-masters, and this in the first place affords the aboundance of the things wrought: and secondly their suf∣ficiency, ability, and skilfullnesse, and this is it that gives the true credit to the fabriks and worke it elfe, and to the merchandizes so wrought and perfected. Now the over great umber of work∣men in all manufactories,Many unskil∣full Arts∣men, is hurt∣full to Traf∣fike. would of it selfe be not onely improfitable to com∣merce, but also hurtfull, if they were not also as good, skilfull, and as cunning
in their Art and mysterie, therefore to the end, not onely to make them such, but als to keepe them so, and multiply them. Wee ee in many Countries, many societies and publike houses, erected for all sorts of mnufactors, wherein some the poore and needy are instructed, the skilfull and good are cherished, incouraged, and rewarded, and in other the lasie and sluggish punished and imployed. The excellent industry of the Germans, to set men n work. The Germans in this point, I thinke excell all other nations, who willingly admi of all skilfull Arts-men, into their societies and corporations, though otherwise strangers unto them, and of what nation and mystery so ever, incou∣raging them by large allowances and salares, to practise with them, and teach and instruct ther fellow Towns∣men. And if otherwise ignorant, yet are they then admitted to learne and pra∣ctise what they see, by which cours it is oserved, that some of their Cites and especially their haunse.The fruits thereof. Townes, flourish
in all wealth, and are abounding in all riches, though otherwise peradventue, deprived of all naturall commoditis, and furtheraces of trade whatsoever. Ad to this end, was first granted and erected,The originall of the Halls in London. the Companies, Brother-hoods, Halls, and societies of these mysteries, in the City of London, many of which were at first founded with large immunities, and great priviledges, to be incourage∣ments to the said manufactories, and to set the poore of those societies a worke, and the better to cherish these mysteries and Arts,Many rinces have been fre of Halls in London. Many of our Princes have cau∣sed their names to be registred, in their soceties and Corporations, for honour and inouragement to their Halls and Brother-hoods: and yet when all this is done, it must b granted, that neither the multitude of good able and skilfull worke-men,Artificiall commoditis inrich not a Kingdome, without the helpe of Traf∣fike. nor yet the great quantity of reall and substantiall manufactories, made and abounding in a Kingdome, can of it selfe either fully and throughly inrich or bring plenty to a place, with∣out
the helpe of Commerce, which is the arme and hand that must distribue, and send abroad both that store & quan∣tity of artificiall commodities so wrought, and must export, and vent it into forraine parts, as being otherwise a superfluity and overplus, and more in∣deed then the Country it selfe standeth in need of; and in lieu thereof, impor∣teth and bringeth in by commutation and exchange, those things, and such as the place it selfe standeth in want of, and is thereby seene to be onely and pro¦perly inriched, for the worke-men by this meanes become to be incouraged, and the manufactories to be preserved, in their reall and substantiall goodnesse, worth, and value, to the honour of the Kingdome, benefit of the inhabitants, & to the furtherance & inlargement of the generall Commerce and Traffik thereof. Traffike is on∣ly able to in∣rich a Coun∣try, which of it selfe is bar∣ren. These two points thus considered and granted, and that neither the naturall commodities of a Countrey, be they ner'e so rich or precious, nor yet the ari∣ficiall
commodities of a Kingdome, be they never so many or excellent, can of themselves, without the assistance of Traffike, benefit a common-weale, or bring plenty or aboundance thereto; and consequently inrich the same. Come we in the next place to the third point, which is this trade it selfe, which of it selfe and by it selfe, can supply all de∣fects either of naturall or artificiall com∣modities, and that without the assi∣stance and helpe of either, can yet produce both, and is alone effectuall to accomplish and perfect the same, though in a barren place,Foure conside∣rations in the prosecution, preservation, and augmen∣tation of trade. affording nether in the prosecution, preservation, and augmentation thereof; foure generall considerations, are in the next place to be noted and observed. The first consideration is grounded upon those wares and commodities, 1 What wares to export, and what not. that a well ordered Traffike is to export or not to export to the stranger, or forraine Country and people. The second consideration is groun∣ded
upon these wares and commodities,2 What to re∣ceive, and what not. which this trade must receive from strangers or forrain Countries, and their Entrie or import into a Kingdome or estate, or not to receive them, and banish the Commerce thereof. 3 What may facilitate, and ease this trade. The third consideration, is grounded upon the facility and ease of this Com∣merce in generall, collected by practise of forraine nations, and accompanied with the meanes of the augmentation tereof. 4 What com∣modity and benefit, this trade produ∣ceth to a Kingdome. The fourth and last consideration, is grounded upon the commod ity and be∣nefit of this Traffike in generall to a Kingdome or estate, where the same is orderly and regularly practised, and that by skilfull and discreet Merchants, bred up thereunto. Fist what wares are to be exported, & what not. First then it is diversly observed, and that in sundry Countries, what the com∣modities and wares in themselves are which a well ordered Traffike ought to export and carry, into forraine Coun∣tries and nations with whom they have Commerce.
Where in most countries it is general∣ly observable,1 Those where∣of a place hath aboundance, and how far. that those wares are only to be carried out, by way of merchan∣dize, whereof the place it selfe hath a∣boundance and plenty, of which after that th place or Country is sufficiently furnished, the exportation thereof may be admitted and allowed, as contrary∣wis those commodities which the place may want,Those which a place may stand in need f, are not exportable. or stand in need of, are in no sort admitted, to be exported, nor in lke manner those, whereof forraine parts may use to the hurt and preju∣duce of the place it selfe,Nor those that may be used to the hurt of the place. where we a∣bide and remaine, as Armes, Horses, pro∣visions, ammunition or things designed to Sea, or war, or the like. And amongst the rest in many countrys, it is noted that the exportation of gold and silver,Nor gold, and silv er. is al∣so forbidden and prohibited, though in many places ill observed, and in some Countries againe, the same is allowed and tollerated, so that the differing lawes of sundry Princes, in divers King∣domes upon the exportation of gold
and silver,Gold and sil∣ver, by some exportable, and by some not. as in some prohibited, and in some allowed and admitted, will in this place be worth our observation, and the rather, that the reasons given thereupon, may be examined, & the benefit or pre∣judice arising thereby observed, where the same is either granted or denyed. The reason why some Princes forbid the exportati∣on thereof. First it must be considered and gran∣ted, that silver and gold is not growing in every Region, and therefore as thngs in themselves scarce, and by all Princes sought after, may be accounted a forrain commodity, and the rather, for that the same carrieth with it, the prehemi∣nence, and predominancy over all other commodities, whatsoever the worldly rich doe possesse, and therefore by rea∣son of the excellency, power, vertue, ge∣nerall use, and need of it, when once it entereth into some Countries and King∣domes; the Princes thereof forbid the exportation and carrying out of the same, upon sharpe penalties and se∣vere punishments for feare of the want and scarcity which may arise,
and come thereby,The same found of no effect, where the contrary is allowed. yet it must likewise bee considered, as a thing granted and found true by experience, that in some countries and free Townes, where the ex∣portation thereof is freely allowed and admitted, and the carrying out openly permitted by authority; no such want or scarcity is discerned; but contrari∣wise, all abundance and plenty thereof is noted, so that this being granted, the exportation thereof may bee allowed without prejudice to the state or King∣dome where we abide: now forasmuch as that this point will hardly find ad∣mittance in the opinion of many of our Sage Politicians, I wil a little enlarge my selfe thereupon, endeavouring by foraign example to make good this my asser∣tion. There is two differing countries,An example of both for proofe. the one a great Kingdome, where gold and Silver in the greatest plenty groweth, and the prohibition of exportation ther∣of, strictly observed & most looked into, and the other a petty Dukedome, whose
Prince is not owner, of neither silver, or gold Mines at all, yet publikely, and by authority admitteth an exportati∣on of this commodity, shall serve here for demonstration and Example of this point. The King of Spaine, richest in Mines, for∣bideth expor∣tation of gold and silver, being posses∣sor of al the rich mines of silver & gold, in the West-Indies, found in themselves of farre greater value, then all the other mines yet discovered throughout the world, hath through all his Dominions, strictly prohibited by sharpe lawes, the exportation of his monyes, out of any his Countries, and hath by sundry sub∣tile decrees, and politicall ordinances, endeavoured to debarre all other, both neighbouring, and remote Kingdomes, and People else of partaking of his Spa∣nish Reals, yet for all this it is observed, that the necessities of his great and ambiti∣ous undertakings, and the urgency of the Commerce of that his barren and poore Countrey,Yet finds smal benfi by these restrictions. The King of Spaine then, enforceth a passage and cur∣rent dispersing, will he, nill he, thereof
into all Countryes over the face of the earth, so that in the height of all his store and plenty, and when hee was in∣volved in the greatnesse of his greatest a∣boundance, his Country and Kingdoms, were yet notwithstanding, and still are, noted to be both scant, dry, and needy, of both silver and gold, and the com∣mon Commerce and Traffike of his most eminent and richest citties, to bee wholly performed by the use of blacke,And his coun∣tries are tra∣ded most, with black-monies. and of Copper monies, to the great dis∣order and confusion of his trade, and the generall ruine and undoing of his Merchants and people, and though by this meanes,Turkie with whom Spaine is ever in war, yet hath a∣boundance of Spanish Rials. Turkey, with whom hee is, and ever hath bin, in greatest enmity, should consequently be more bare of his coynes, yet wee finde, that have either li∣ved, or doe Traffike thither, that almost throughout all the Grand Seigniors Do∣minions, which are both ample, large, and spacious; there is no silver coyne of note currant, but the Spanish Riols, and the same not carried thither by the hand
of war, or the necessity of his designes in those parts, but by the hand of Com∣merce, and concurrence of Traffike, which fils all those Countries, and that in great abundance therewith. The Duke of Florence hath no mines admits expor∣tation, yet hath abun∣dance of Ri∣als. Now the Duke of Florence, which is onely the Lord of a pettie, but pretty Seigniory, barren in its selfe of mines, both of Silver and Gold, maketh con∣trariwise no open restriction, nor pub∣like prohibition of exporting, of either gold or silver; and whereas in Leghorn, his only noted maritine towne of trade, a million of Ducats are freely and yeerly openly laden, and shipped away, yet the Countrey wants it not, nor is found any way to be scant thereof, nor is it seene, seldome to arise, or fall in price or value; nor yet is there noted any brasse or cop∣per moneyes in use amongst his Mer∣chants in Traffique & Cómerce, so that by this experienced demonstration, Spain that should have most,Note. is the most barren, for al their prohibitions, & Tosca∣ny, that shold have least, affords the most
plenty, by reason of its liberty of ex∣portation and freedome in the Com∣merce therof. But it may be here alled∣ged, that the naturall infertility of Spaine, and the naturall plenty of Tus∣canie, may partly occasion, or else in∣force the same; to which I answer and grant, this may have some concurrence, but no necessity:Spaine in its lowest ebbe, came to be the owner of the West-India. For when as Spaine in its lowest ebbe became fortunately ow∣ner of the rich West-India, that Prince then by this meanes had silver, but yet he wanted the other materials of Com∣merce, for the performance of that coun∣tries Traffike, which other places could best afford him, and which his monies might best, and did then procure him; and when the Portugal, by his happy dis∣covery, had the East-India trade alone, yet he wanted Rials to purchase the commodities of East-India, which Spain was then best able to afford him, but both these Kingdomes joyned now in one, and bowing to one and the same Scepter, it is observable that the VVest-India
affords,West-India af∣fords the monies to drive the East∣India rade, & the East-India affords the spice, & that drives the West-India trade. now the monies to drive the East-India trade withall, and the East-India affords the rich spices, and drugs which must procure the sundrie needfull diversity of European commodi∣ties, to drive the VVest-India Traffike withall; so that a man would imagine Spaine as it now stands, should not at this day want any manner of thing to make it abound, either in monies, or in wares and commodiies, and yet we find it to be both bare and poore in their Commerce; and notwithstanding, the so strict prohibition of the exportation of their silver and gold, and the autho∣rzing of so much Copper-monies cur∣rent amongst them, yet stil his King∣domes to remaine in great need and want thereof. Tuskanies ferti∣lity, is attri∣buted more to the trade, then to the Country.And as for the fertility and plenty of Tuscany, though it must needs be in some sort granted, yet its richs and a∣boundance is to be attributed, rather to the trade of the place & to the excellent government of the Country, in matters
of Commerce, then to the naturall Cly∣mate thereof, or industry of the inhabi∣tants,Oservable in 3 rules of Traffike. for it is noted, that three well ad∣vised rules in Traffike, hath brought it to this height that now it is. The first is the allowance of free and  publike exportation of monies. The second is the easie duties and  customes, paid upon all merchandize to the Prince. And the third is the goodnesse, and  reall value of the Coyn current through∣out the Duke-dome: but this is from my purpose. This one example then I hope will suffice, to make good the point before∣going, (whereto many others might be alleadged) to prove that this tolleration of exportation of monies, makes not in it selfe the scarcity of silver and gold, nether yet the prohibition thereof makes the aboundance, but I will proceed no further in this point,Merchants must submit themselves to the Lawes of Princes, where they Traffike. save by way of cau∣tion, advise all Merchants to submit themselves, to the Lawes and ordinan∣ces
of Princes, and conforme themselves to the customes of the Kingdomes and places to which they Traffike; which almost varies in every Country, one commodity being in one Kingdome prohibited, which in another is permit∣ted and allowed; as we find, that Lead, a native commodity of this Land,Some wares transportable in some Coun∣tries, and pro∣hibited in o∣thers. is lawfully exportable in England, but is accounted a Contrabanda, and prohibi∣ted exportation in Spaine, and in many other Countries, when once it is impor∣ted: and we find that Woolls are prohi∣bited also in England, yet allowed in Spaine, Iron againe allowed in Spain, but prohibited in France, and Saile-cloth, Canvas, and the lke, allowed in France, yet prohibited in Spaine; so is gold and silver, as aforesaid is mentioned, forbid∣den in England, Spaine, and France, yet allowed in Marsellia, Leghorne, Barbary, Turky, and in many other places. Reasons for the prohibiti∣on of commo∣dities, unpos∣ble to be kep. Divers reasons are given by Stats-men, for the prohibition of some peculiar commodities, as I said before, but indeed
many of them are impossible to be ob∣served in the execution; for that Country that will maintaine a free Commerce with his neighbour, makes in one Coun∣trey, one Commodity lawfull, which in an other is not lawful, unlesse all com∣merce might be made by a kind of Ex∣change, and bartering of Commodities against commodities, and that also pra∣ctised in regard of the merchandise or wares, which are not very necessary, and not in regard of those that are for the place of our aboade, and whereof wee cannot passe without; and in this case Merchants are forced to have recourse to otheir foraign parts, and then must take a law from them, in either giving them other merchandises, which may be as necessary for them, as theirs are for us, or in paying or contenting them with ready monies for the same, how∣ever it happen,A generall rule observed in prohibited Commodities. this is found the general, Rule in this point, that a Kingdome and State doth commonly admit of the ex∣portation & carrying out of those com∣modities,
and wares, which are native and growing in their Dominions, or of that whereof they have store and plenty, not regarding the lawes of other Coun∣tries, but yet some prohibitions in these very places, are made of exporting of some commodities of war-fare, as is seene of Iron Ordnance in England, and the like, for the possessing thereof by our neighbours, might at one time or other, annoy and prejudice our selves, or the place and countrey of our aboad: within the compasse of this considera∣tion is also comprehended those artifici∣all commodities,Artificiall wares which are not expor∣table, and how far. and wares, which are not to be carried out and exported, and such are they as have not received their intire perfection at home, as is ordained by wools, in England, which is not al∣lowable, till wrought into cloath, and yet not in cloath neither, till the same hath received all necessary and fit perfe∣ction, by dressing, dying, and the like, for thus the meanes of workeman-ship is taken away from the Artist, and work∣man,
which in some certaine workes, and fabrikes, exceedes the price of the substance, and matter it selfe, and therby their lively-hoods deprived them, and a powerfull furtherance and helpe of Commerce is by this occasion cut off, and hindred. This point is by some Princes so nar∣rowly watched,The care of some Princes to set their people on worke. and so vigilantly look∣ed into, that they are not satisfied with those materials, that grow amongst them∣selves, and in their owne countries, but they covet by al industry to draw others from their neighbours, or foraigne nati∣ons, to employ their subjects, and to put their people on worke, by this meanes, much enriching themselves, and ho∣nouring their Countrey; and adding a great helpe to the publike Traffik therof; selling and venting them thus once wrought, even to those Nations, who many times have first sold and furnished them with the very first materials of the said Manufacto∣ries.
Examples of this practise we find ma∣ny, and that in sundry Countries and places,Examples of the Florentines are, in this point. as the Florentine, who of all o∣thers exceeds in silk Fabrikes, yet at first provide much of his raw silke, in Valen∣tia, in Spaine, in Naples, and other the neighbouring Countries, and having wrought and perfited the same in Tos∣cany, returnes it to the proud and lasie Spaniard, and to other places in Damas∣ces, Sattins, Taffeta's, and the like; so bringing it backe wrought, to the selfe same place whence it first came out raw, to be sold and vented. And of the Dutch, before their last wars with Spaine. The Dutch likewise, buyes his Woolls in Spaine, carries it home to his owne house, there spins it, weaves it, and workes it to perfection, then brings it backe into Spaine, in Sarges, Sayes, and such like stuffes: and so there againe sels the same to good profit, and vents it. And of Man∣chester. The towne of Manchester in Lan∣cashire, must be also herein remembred, and wothily, and for their industry commended, who buy the Yarne of the
Irish, in great quantity, and weaving it returne the same againe in Linen, in∣to Ireland to sell; neither doth the in∣dustry rst here, for they buy Cotten wooll, in London, that comes first from Cyprus, and Smyrna, and at home worke the same, and perfit it into Fustians, Vermilions, Dymiies, and other such Stuffes; and then returne it to London, where the same is vented and sold, and not seldome sent into forrain parts, who have meanes at far easier termes, to pro∣vide themselves of the said first mate∣rials Now though it may be wished,How far this is to be cheished. that all other parts of our Country, could be so industrious; as thus to procure ma∣terials of Fabrikes, for the inriching of themselves, and inlarging of this King∣domes Traffike, yet we find it in some places, an impossible thing to be per∣formed; for where the Traffike or ex∣portation of a native commodity, is of greater consequence to the Country, and over-valueth the commodity im∣ported,
it is safer then, and better to pre∣serve the native, and to neglect the for∣raine, then by too much preservation of the forraine, to neglect and ruine the native. Besides, the native commodity may be rich, and in its selfe, a necessary com∣modity, but the forraine a meaner, and tending peradventure more to excesse, and superfluity, then to need and neces∣sity, as the great quantity of native clothes, that are yearely shipped into Turky, by the levant or Turky Company, having their full worke man-shp, and perfection in England, brings in returne thereof, great quantity of Cotten, and Cotten-yarne, Grograme-yarne, and raw silke into England, (which shewes the benefit accrewing to this Kingdome by that Company) for here the said cloth is first shipped out,Staple an na∣tive commodi∣ties of a King∣dome, are in th first plae to be cared for. and exported in its full perfection, dyed and drest; and thereby the prime native commodite of this Kingdome, is increased, impro∣ved, and vented, and the Cotten-yarne
and raw silke, that is yearely imported and brought in, is more (as experience tells us) then this Kingdome can spend, vent, or any way utter, either raw, in the same nature as it is brought in, or wrought in this Kingdome into manu∣factories: here the first as the most use∣full, native, and excellent, is to be first preferred and cared for, and the other yet so much cherished, that it may as much as possible it can,And the for∣aine hat sets the Subject on woke, in the next to be che∣rishd. be wrought here, and perfited into Stuffes, partly to give a consumption to the materiall it selfe, partly to set the poore Artist here on worke, but principally to further the generall Commerce of this Kindome and Country, and to helpe a valueable returne, for the English cloth exported▪ some States have seriously entred into consideration of this point, and have indevoured with all possiblecare, the fur∣therance thereof, wher it was defective, as King Iames of famous Memorie,King Iams, his provident are in this point. inordered as I have been informed, that the white cloth shipped hence to the
Netherlands, by a Nonobstante should have every tenth cloth thereof, died and dressed here, thus indeavoring by a wholesome order, to bring the whole shipping quantity, in use amongst them, that by this meanes, in time to come, all the said shipping might be drawne, to be dyed and dressed in our own Coun∣try▪ and not be shipped white, as was then in use, and is still, to the great pre∣judice of that clothing; but had his Ma∣jesty then been pleased, to grant the la∣der thereof, some extraordinary privi∣ledge, or to be free from custome, for a∣ny such cloth so shipped, in its full perfection, it would doubtlesse before this time, have wrought better ef∣fects in this point, then hitherto we see the former order hath brought to passe. The indea∣vours of some other Princes in this point. Some again to further the same, have eased the native manufactories of their Countries, of all customes, imposts, and such like duties in the vent or ex∣portation, thereby incouraging their
Subjects, to make them, and their Merchants, to snd them abroad, and transport them, and some have againe, charged the forraine Manufactories, which tended not immediately to need or use, with heavie taxs, thereby deterring the importation, and cherishing the native worke man to make the same, and to indeavour the obtainment of perfection therein at home. Some have also eased all raw materi∣als, that have beene imported, being commodties, tending to set the poore subjects on work, as is Cotten, Hempe, Yarne, Flaxe, Woolls, raw silke, and the like; and all these practised in some places, have met with a happy suc∣cesse, which hath both inrichd the Subject, set the poore native Artists on worke, and proved the maine furtherer of the Commerce of that Kingdome, where the same hath been daily, and industriously put in use and practised.
Second consi∣deration what commodities are to be e∣ceaved, and wha not. The first point grounded upon the con∣siderable benefit of a well ordered Traf∣fike, being thus handled, and having con∣cluded what wares and commodities may be exported, and what may not, out of an estate or Kingdome, & what hath bin practised by forraine nations with good successe; I come now to the second con∣sideration before mentioned, declaring what wares and commodities must be received, and what must not be receaved into an estate, by the limitation of a well ordered trade and Commerce. All commodi∣ties tending to riot, are to be pohibited im∣portations▪ Some observing States-men, have noted that a Prince should stop the entry, and importation by Commerce, unto all commodities, that tends to riot or ex∣cesse, as the principall meanes that impo∣verisheth a Kingdome, though many times it inrich the trader, and Merchant, amongst which precious Stones, rich Iems, exquisite perfumes, costly unne∣cessary Spices, and rich Stuffes, which serve more for pompe and show, than for need and use, are principally noted.
But how difficult in an age or Kingdome of peace and plenty,With their difficulties. this may bee ef∣fected, I leave to the said statesmen to de∣termine, yet presuppose that these com∣modities, such as they are, be admitted their importation, the Prince and sove∣raigne may notwithstanding bee in his owne particular a gainer, though the sub∣ject or Countrey therein prove loosers, for if the use, or rather abuse of these commodities in a Kingdome, be so inve∣terate, as that the same cannot be hindred, by a moderate prohibition, yet they may be charged with such great customes and Imposts, as the merchant or importer may have no great desire to bring them in any quantity, fearing he shall not obtain the price they cost him; and the subject will likewise have no earnest desire to buy them, in regard of the dearenesse thereof, and though that sometimes this consideration will not, nor doth not re∣straine the rich and wealthy of a King∣dome, from procuring and purchasing such merchandises, yet the soveraignes
treasure, will by this meanes be aug∣mented, and by this way it may upply in place of punshment, for the riot and excesse in private person, and on the other side, the Subjct desisting from the excesse, though the Soveraigne gaine not tereby, yet that Common∣wealth will be both improved and be∣nefitted, by this chiefe and good hus∣bandry. Needfull wares ever to be receaved. Now for such other commodities as may be receavd and imported, those are most welcome, which are noted to be the most needull, & hat the Coun∣try and inhabitants thereof wants, and such as tend to need or use▪ are still the most desired, Graine, Butr, Chese, and all provisions for food, should eve∣ry where be freely receaved, and that without dties or customes thereupon, as in Leghorne, in Tuskanie, in Spaine, and in many other places: The Merchants and bringers in of such, have ever a re∣ward allowed them, to incourage them to a readinesse at all times, to
bring in the same againe, at another time and season. Also all ammunition for the defence of our Country,Needfull for wars. and for the offence of of our enemies, as Horses, Armes, Pow∣der, Cannons, Muskets, Bullets, Match, and all provision for shipping, as Planks, Timber, Masts, Pitch, Cordage, Iron, Saile-cloth and the like, are ever to be receaved. Thirdly all such commodities,And wares that set the Subject a wok, are to be received. as may set the poore or richer sort on worke, by making of sundry sorts of Fabrikes, either of Linen, and Woo∣len, silke or the like, as are Cotten Wooll, and yarne, of which is made Vermillions, Fustians, Demities, & such others, also fleece-wooll, of which is made woollen-cloth, Sayes, Sarges, Perpetuanas, Bayes, and sundry other sorts, comprehended under the name of new Drapery with us, also Grograme∣yare of which is made, Iames, Gro∣grams, Durettes, silke-mohers, and ma∣ny others late new invented Stuffes,
Flaxe, Hempe, and the Yarne thereof, of which is made all sort of Linens, fine and course, all Ropes, Tackles, Ca∣bles, and such like used in ship∣ping, all raw-silke, and throwne, whereof is made all manner of Silke∣Laces, Sattins, Plushes, Taffeta's, Cally-mancos, and many others, all silver and gold in thred, and Bullion whereof, is made silver and gold Lace, Cloth of gold and silver, and manie others, whch may set on worke, not onely the poore industrious wor∣king Subjects, imploy the monies, and estates of the rich, but also much further Navigation and Commerce, and generally inrich the Prince and Kingdome, by the second Traffike of these Manufactories. Yet with cer∣taine Limita∣tions. Yet many of these commodities and wares, are to bee receaved with some certaine restrictions, and lamentations, according to the Iudgement and dis∣cretion of the Soveraigne; For if by incouragements or Immunities, the
Merchant brings in the first materiall' as I may say, Cotten-wooll, the yarn thereof may then bee prohibited, for thereby part of the poore mans labour is taken away, and so in Hemp, and Flaxe, and the like, if it be im∣ported in good aboundance, the yarn thereof may be prohibited, for the cause before mentioned, and so may also such petty manufactories be deny∣ed entrance, as playing Cards, gold and silver thred, and the like, whilst wee have the principall materials, whereof the same is or may be composed, & per∣fitted at home. And thus much shall serve to have said, concerning what wares may be receaved, and what may not be receaved into a Kingdome, by the rules of a well ordered Traffike, the facilitating and acquisition of this Traffike, consi∣derations is to facilitate, &c ease Traffick. in a Countrie or place, comes in the next consideration to be handled. The politike estate of Venetia,The practises of sundry Princes, to augment Trade. the Iu∣dicious Duke of Tuskanie, the cun∣ning
Hollanders, the industrious hauns townes, and others, that much in∣deavour and studie this point, have noted, and found out many particu∣lar points, which they have put in practise, as the most effectuall, o∣perative, and efficient, conducing to the facilitating, ease and augmentati∣on of Traffike in generall, which ga∣therd out of their practises, wee may put in use, and applie to our seles, for the increase of a Coun∣tries forraine Traffke, which princi∣pally are these. 1 To further the commodi∣ous cariadge of goods &c. First to further by all meanes, the commodious carriage of goods and merchandize both by Land and by water, either by Boats, Cartage, Horses, or other such conveiances, wherein is considerable as a thing necessary, that the Rivers bee navi∣gable or made so if possible, by la∣bour, Art and industrie, then to remove all hindring Mills, Bridges,
fishing weares, Bankes, Sholds, and such like impediments that may any way let or hinder the same. Secondly,2 No tolle up∣on Rivers, bridges &c. that no Lord, or adjoy∣ning commanding borderer, impose either custome, tolle, taxe, or du∣ties upon the commodities, and wares so carried in Boates, Lighters or Bar∣ges, passing or repassing thereupon, or heavie acknowledgements, passing o∣ver Bridges, Causyes, or the like, that may disturbe the publike Traffike, or be a charge to the generall Commerce of a Country. Thirdly,3 To free the Seas from Py∣rats. to keepe the Seas, and streames, free and safe from all Py∣rats, theeves, and robbers, as the principall disturbers of the universall Traffike, of Kingdomes and nations, and the greatest overthrowers of the navigation, and Commerce of Cities and Countries.
4 To main∣taine Boyes, Lights, and Castles, &c. Fourthly, to safeguard the Ports, Har∣bours, Roads, and Sea-Creekes, from them, to maintaine where is necessarie, fortified places, to defend the pursued, and to offend the pursuer, to maintaine and conserve the keyes, Peeres, molds, and other places of moredge, fastnings, anchoredge, and the like, and to set up and maintaine, Beacons, Watch-Townes, Lights by night, Sea-marks, and Boyes, for the safeguard of Ma∣riners sayling either by night or day. 5 To keep the wayes from theeves, &c. Fiftly, to keepe the Land wayes and passages, free and safe also from Theeves and Robbers, to mend Cau∣seys, high-wayes and decayed Brid∣ges, to build alberges, Innes, lodgings and places of safety whare none is, in fit and commodious places, for the reposing and rest of men and beasts of carryage, where all accommodation, both for men and horses travelling, may be had at easie and reasonable rates and prises, and where all needfull things
may bee obtained, for the trvailer which he may ordinarily stand in need of. Sixtly,6 To main∣taine the Posts, &c. to maintaine posts, and post-horses, by Land, and post barkes by Sea, also all Letter-carriers, and such like foot-posts, with priviledges, and fit stipends, for their paines and care therein. Seventhly,7 To put down Mono∣polies, &c. not to suffer any Mono∣polies, Pattents, and grants to private men, which may hinder the liberty, and freedome of Traffike, and if such bee discouvered, and found out, to punish the same rigorously and se∣verely. Eightly,8 To invite industrious strangers by priviledges▪ to invite by priviledges, the industrious strangers, and Merchants, to bring and import unto us, the wares ad commodities, which wee cannot want, and those whero the Country it selfe stands in need of, and hat which may either advantage the publike, or the defence of the Countrie it selfe.
9 To dis∣chage all great customes. Ninthly, to discharge all great cu∣stome, heavie imposts, and duties upon all goods and merchandize, or at least wise upon the Subjects goods, and up∣on all needfull and usefull commodi∣ties, or if the same stand not with the commodity of the Prince, yet at least wise; so much of these customes &c. As the necessity of the state will beare, and trade may well permit, without overthrowing of the generall Traffike, and Commerce of the Country, and the dependances thereupon. 10 To esta∣blish Sea Lawes, for Merchants & navigator. Tenthly, to establish such Lawes, and ordinaces for Merchants, and mer∣chandizing affaires, and Sea causes, as that there be not onely faith and assu∣rance, preserved amongst all negocia∣tors, Sea-faring-men, and merchants whatsoever, but also amongst all man∣ner of buyers, and sellers, and that there be likewise severe punishments decreed for fraudulent & publike decavers, ban∣kerouts, and robbers of the common Traffike, of a nation or Country.
Eleventhly,11 To erect a Court of Mer∣chats. that in case of dif∣ferences, debates, controversies, and the like accidents, hapning in Traffike amongst Merchants, there may be a summary, and speedy Justice executed, either by a quick∣ned law, or a Court of Merchants, as it is observed and practised in many Countries, especially in that which concernes strangers, who oftentimes are noted to forbeare their Traffique into a place, no lesse, in regard of the charge and tediousnesse of suits, then for the tretchery and falshoods of the inha∣bitants of the Countrey. Twelfthly,12 The Coins current to be constant and good &c. and forasmuch as a permutation of Commodities can∣not bee well made, without a cer∣taine price set downe upon all mer∣chandises, and that they cannot negotiate with all sorts of people, simply by Exchange, but that it is necessarie to make use of the
monies and Coynes of Princes, in their severall distinct Coun∣tries, the value, price, and esti∣mation thereof, must bee there∣for certaine, constant and firme, otherwise it would bring a con∣fusion to the generall Commerce of a Kingdome, and every com∣moditie must then bee gover∣ned in esteeme and value, ac∣cording as the monie shall bee current in price. Neither is this onely suffici∣ent, but the reall goodnesse, and true value of these Coines must bee easie, to bee judged, and knowne, not onely by the waight thereof; but also by the eye, and sound of the same, if it bee possible, the which may bee the easier done, if there bee no metalls used in Coine current, but onely silver and gold, which
is sufficient in themselves, to ex∣prsse all summes, and quanti∣tie, ow little and small soever, and if everie peece both of sil∣ver and gold, bee Coyned by a certaine waight, thickesse, and greatnesse, and in forme of cer∣taine medlles, as the GRECI∣ANS, LATINS, HE∣BREWES, PERSIANS, and EGYPTIANS, in old time did use, it would prove a difficult thing for a man to be de∣ceived therewith, and it would bee facile for all strangers, and Mer∣chants, to bee soone experienced, and acquainted with them Thirteenth,13 To give honour to merchants, and why? whereas some ig∣norant estates and forraine nati∣ons, doe contemne Mrchants, and merchandizing, and such as ex∣ercise Traffike, holding and under∣valuing, the Art of merchandi∣zing in its selfe, as base and
sordid, which too often is found in many places quickly to decay the publike commerce of some King∣domes, for thereb it commeth to passe that they which have gotten a little wealth, retire themselves speedily to embrace some other vocation, to the which the com∣mon people carry more respect and honour, then to this. It being a thing, which in all civill and well governed King∣domes, ought carefully to bee a∣voyded, and removed, for the good and furtherance of the Traf∣fike thereof; now indeed it must be granted, that there bee certaine trades, which should bee left to the poore and common people, to inrich themslves by; but there are others, more noble, which they on∣ly can best execute, that are con∣versant in foraign Countries, which is that of Merchandizing in re∣mote
parts, by the benefit and commodity of the Sea,Merchandi∣zing is the most profita∣ble i an estate. and that by persons qualified and versed in forraine regions, which in it selfe is the most knowing, profitable, beneficiall, and excellent in an e∣state, as shall bee shewed in this following Treatise, and to these more honour and respect should be attributed, then is now done, both in France, and in some other Countries, for if in all estates, the wise, judcious, and prudent Counellours of a Prnce, have thought it fitting, and requisite to invite the Subjects by honour, to the most dangerous and hazardable attempts and actions, which may bee profitable and conduce to the benefit and profit of the publike; these two of Navigation by Traf∣fike, and of Commerce by navi∣gation, being of that concurrent qualitie, and united disposition,
they should propound and attri∣bute more honour to those that shall deale therein, and exercise the same, then now it is noted they doe. And if true Nobili∣tie should have taken its founda∣tion,Why such should be ho∣noured. (as the Iudcious and Lear∣ned have observed heretofore) from the courage of men, and from their Valour, there is no vocation, wherein there is so many usefull and principall parts of a man required, as in these two, for they are not onely to adventure and hazard their owne persons, but also their estates, goods, and what ever they have, amongst men of all nations, and Customes, Lawes, and Religi∣ons, wheresoever they are inhabi∣ted. And that not onely in com∣mon casualties, mishaps, and
dangers, but somesomes to wra∣stle and stand even against the foure Elements, combined toge∣ther, to threaten their ruine, and destruction, which is the stron∣gest and most remarkable evi∣dence and proofe, that possibly can bee alledged or spoken, of the constant and firme resolution of a man. This sole point and considerati∣on, hath beene the occasion, that some States have beene of opini∣on, and thought that this doore should be opened, to the adventu∣ring Merchant to attaine unto No∣bility, so as the Father and the Sonne, have continued succesfully for some ages therein; and which is seene in ome sort to be practi∣sed in some places at this day, and if those Noble-men, (the up∣holders of a Land or Kingdome)
who are commonly the richet and greatest in an estate, should practise and addict themselves to this Commerce, and Sea-Traf∣fike (as some beganne to doe in Queene ELIZABETHS daies) being a thing not prejudiciall, nor hurtfull to their honour, or to their noble condition, doubt∣lesse it is, ad would bee more honourable unto them, then to bee Vsuerers, and Bankers, as is observed in Italy, and many other Countries as they are, or to impove∣rish themselves, in doing of no∣thing, or nought worthie of note, but neglect their owne occasi∣ons, in spending, lavishing, and wasting, when peradventure they never gather any thing to what they have, or what was formerly was left unto them, by their An∣cestours.
Hence would grow many advanta∣ges,The benefit of the Trade of Nobles and rich in a kingdome. both to the publike and private, for that they that thus deale in traffike, having thus meanes, courage, and suffi∣ciencie, for this Conduct and Enterprise, the same would bee farre greater, and more eminent in it selfe, then now it is, setting thus more ships to sea, and by be¦ing consequently better armed, and bet∣ter furnished; and whereof the state in time of need, might make good use of, for its safety and defence; and withall it would carry the reputation of that Nation, farre further into remote Regi∣ons; the which they cannot doe, who being poore, and having litle or no stock, but of one ages gathering, or per∣adventure taken up at Interest, and bor∣rowed from others, wanting both power, meanes, and courage, either to hazard themselves in great, and eminent Enterprises, or to wade through the same, being once entred thereinto. And for other particular Interest, this Commerce being wisely managed, and
discreetly handled, what hazard soever they should run, there is more to be got∣ten thereby, then to be lost: And if Gen∣tlemen in generall would thus apply themselves to traffike, as some within these late yeares have beene observed to doe, and that without wasting of their estates by vast Expences, or importu∣ning their Soveraigne by disorderly de∣mands and gifts, they should by all like∣lihoods benefit themselves more in one yeare, by a well govern'd traffick at sea, then peradventure at Court by ten years waiting and solicitations. Finally, to conclude this point, Ex∣perience hath taught, and teacheth us daily, where those of great purses, and good judgements have exercised traf∣ficke, and where such have beene bac∣ked and encouraged by a gracious, and furthering Soveraigne, and by a Prince that loveth Navigation, and favoureth Traffick; it hath mightily enriched both themselves, and the Princes and Estates, under which they have liv'd; as by the
late Examples of the Portugal, Hollander, Spaniard, and Venetian is made knowne, and manifested unto all the world. Next to erect and settle an office of assurance,14: To erect an assurance office. with fit and skilfull Iudges, which should determine, and give spee∣dy Execution in their Decrees and Acts, betweene Adventurers, to avoide de∣murs, delayes, and hindrances, that hap∣pen by tedious suites in adventures at sea amongst Merchants. Fifteenth,15. To erect some Companies. the only meanes conceived to settle the Commerce and Traffick of a Nation into forraine Countries by sea, in the which the best purses will not bee drawne to hazard themselves in the En∣terprise, is to compell the Merchants which trade at sea, to one and the selfe same certaine place and countrey, to joyn one with another in a corporation, and Company, and not to make their Traffick by themselves asunder, or apart; for although that adventuring apart, the Gaine would probably be the greater to the Adventurers, when the enterprise
succeeds happily; yet it is to be conside∣red, that the losse which may happen, would wholly ruine him that attempts the danger alone; and if in making a joynt Company, or Society, the Gaine should turne to be the lesse; yt it is ever more assured, and the disorders by Traf∣fike by a good government is still remo∣ved; and the losse being borne by ma∣ny, it is consequently the lesse to every one that is interessed therein; and thus dividing the rade of the whole, ac∣cording to either the places, or coasts where the same is made, forbidding them to attempt one upon anothers pri∣viledges; and prohibiting all other pri∣vate Subjects (of what quality soever) which shal not be Members or free Bro∣thers of those Societies, to negotiate in∣to those parts upon great penalties, and appointing certaine Governours, or o∣thers the greatest adventurers, to order and regulate the said Traffike and Com∣panies; which Rules have found such good successe, both in Holland, England,
and else-where, that it hath beene one of the maine causes, that hath brought the traffike of London, and of Amsterdam, to that present height and greatnesse, as it is now observed to be.16. To lend money to the Merchant out of the common Treasury. Next for the furtherance of the Traf∣fike of some Kingdomes, it hath beene observed, that great summes of monies have beene lent gratis, or upon easie rates and security, to skilfull Merchants, out of the soveraigne, or common Trea∣surie, which hath also found such good successe, as that the customes of that Prince have beene thereby much increa∣sed, the kingdome enriched, the poore set on worke, and the native Commo∣dities thereof, vented to all parts of the world thereby.17. By trans∣portation of Bils. In the next place, it hath beene noted mainely to further the traffike of a Kingdome, the transportation of bils of debt, from one man to another, in liew of monies, as is used in some Countries; for thereby many Law suits are avoyded amongst Dealers,
errors in Merchants accounts cleared, the Princes customes increased, the great stock of the Kingdome, which conti∣nually lyeth in all Negotiators hands in dead Bills and Bonds, employed, Traf∣fike it selfe quickned, and such a benefit enjoyed thereby to the Common∣wealth, as cannot be expressed. In the next place it hath beene obser∣ved in some places,18. Exam∣ple of the Princ, a maine Fur∣therer of Trade. where the poore for want of abilities cannot trade, and where the great or rich have not will, or dare not adventure their Estates in for∣raine Traffike, that the examples onely of the Prince hath throughly effected it, and proved a maie Furtherer of the ge∣nerall Commerce and Traffike of his Countrey; which doth not only hold in this matter of Trade, but in all other state matters whatsoever; for then it will be impossible for the rich Subjects to for∣beare; when they see their Soveraigne bend his mind, and addict himselfe ther∣unto. For the wise have observed, that Princes cannot frame an Age unlike
unto themselves;Cassiod. 11.3. and that it is easier (as one said) for Nature to erre, then that a Prince should form a Common-wealth unlike himselfe: Iust if they be wicked, regular if they be dissolute, chaste if they be immodest, and religious if they bee impious. Neither is it thus in these our dayes; History it selfe warrants the point, and makes it good in all former ages. For, under Romulus it was found that Rome was warlike; but under their Soverain Numa they were religious, under the Fabritii they were continent, under the Catoes Regular, under the Graccbi seditious, under the Lucalli and Antonines, intemperate and dissolute; under Constantine the Great the Empire is Christian, but under Iulian idolatrous: Therefore, for conclusion, if the Prince love the sea, his Subjects will be all Sea-men; and if he be a Lo∣ver of trade and traffike, the rich and powerfull of his Kingdomes, will be all Merchants. In the next place, it hath beene noted
as an effectuall meane,19 By ere∣cting a staple of rade. whereby traf∣fike may be obtained and setled where none is, is by erecting a staple of trade, and to indow the same with freedome of traffike, which briefly may be termed to containe some of these before recited particulars, especially those of great priviledges, and small customes; for this will gaine Trade where none is, and being gotten mightily increase the same, when this shall fall out to bee in a Countrey, where God and Industry hath blessed the Land and people with wares, that are either rich or usefull, it will soone beget, maintaine, and in large the Trade of the place, so made a staple, as above is said. Now for as much as this staple is in many countries a thing unknown, and that many men are ignorant of the be∣nefit that the same may produce, I will a little inlarge my selfe thereupon, and in few words shew how it may turne a Kingdome to profit, and by perusing the commodity it affordeth to other
nations, conceive it may yeeld the like to that Prince that coveeth the same, or putteth this rule in practice:A staple of trade what. A staple of Trade is a place then, where large immu∣nities and priviledges are granted to all Merchants of what nation soever; some∣times extending to native commodities onely, and sometimes to forraine, and sometimes to both, with free liberty, to xport and import all manner of wares custome free, when, whither, and by whom they please, paying a small acknowledgement onely in liew of the said cutome to the Prince, and where∣soever the same hath thus been seene to be settled in a Kindome, it hath beene noted much to encourage the inhabi∣tants thereof, and force them in a short time to become either great Merchants, or industrious Furtherers thereof; for the same would yeeld them occasion to be sharers in the traffike of other Coun∣tries, whereof before they neither had any profit, nor yet the Prince any cu∣stomes thereby: the benefit of this staple
of Trade may be the better discerned by looking upon the practise of those Countries,The benefit of a staple by the experi∣ence of other Countris. where the same is put in use, and especially by our Neighbours the Netherlanders, where the same is practi∣sed with wonderfull industry, paines, care, and conducible profit, instanced by these examples. No timber in Holland, and yet they have the sta∣ple thereof. First it is well knowne to us, and all the world, that they have there no tim∣ber, nor yet Forests of any sort, of their own growth, yet the freedome of Trade begets them such fit materials, that the same builds them yearly above a thou∣sand sayle of ships, partly serving to their owne use, but principally to sell to o∣thers; and that the huge pales of wain∣scot, Claboard and Deale are in their sta∣ple Cities. No corne there, and yet they have the staple thereof. Next, they are found to have no corn growing almost in all their countries; for it is the East Countrey that affords the same in abundance; yet wee know that the greatest Store-houses, and staple Granaries of grain, is by the freedome
of their trade in the low Countries; for Amsterdam (if report may gaine credit) is continually stored with 8. in 100000. quarters, besides what is by trade daily sold away and vented. The maine shooles,No fish there, yet the staple therof is in Holland. and massy bulke of Herrings, from whence their industry and traffike raiseth to them so many millions yearely, proceeds meerly out of our English seas; but yet the great Fishe∣ry (to the shame and wonderfull disho∣nour of England) is in the Low countries; wherewith not onely their owne occa∣sions at home are plentifully supplyed, but all Christendome besides, abundant∣ly stored, it being computed, that they send forth yearely into other Countries, above one hundred thousand last, which wee may account to bee two hundred thousand tuns. The large and mighty vast Vineyards,No Vine∣yards nor salt in Hol∣land, yet they have the sta∣ple thereof. and great quantity and stoe of salt, is noted to be in France and Spaine, yet the great Vintages, as I may say, and staples both of Salt and Wine, is found in the
Netherlands, whereby they imploy yearely above a thousand sayle of their shipping. No Wools there, and yet they have the staple of ma∣nufactories The Wooll, Cloath, Lead and Tinne, and divers staple English commodities, are properly and naturally of Englands production, but yet, to the dishonour and prejudice of England, the great Ma∣nufactories of Dying, Dressing, &c. of them are seene in the Low-countries, whereby they not onely imploy their poore by labour, but their Mariners by shipping, and often times under-sell the English, both in their owne countries, and abroad, with these and other our owne commodities. Light cu∣stomes in∣crease trade, and heavy ruine it. Many others in this kind may be pro∣duced; for it is to be noted, that where∣soever such a staple of trade is erected, kept and maintained, there all foraine and native commodities doe abound, for the supply of any other countrey, that may or doth want the same; and where the customes upon Merchants goods is small, it easily draweth all nati∣ons
to trade with them; and contrari∣wise where great impositions are laid upon Merchants goods, the traffike of the place, will be seen soone to decay, to the prejudice of hat place and kingdom. The difference thereof is made evident in any two townes of severall Princes Dominions: Example thereof be∣tween Eng∣land, and Holland. in the one, where customes are easie, and there Merchants doe flock together from all parts of the world, and abundance of foraine commodities are from all countries imported thither, that benefit the Merchant, the people, and the Prince; and in the other, where the cu∣stomes are heavie and burthensome to a Merchant, and heavie upon his wares, and there none comes, nor brings any commodities, but what hee knowes is liable, and must pay this custome to his and the countries great prejudice; which by an example or two I shall here mani∣fest. Two ships laden at Burdeux,In a ship of 300. tuns come from Burdeux. of equall burthen, viz. of three hun∣dred tuns, the one goeth for England,
and the other for Holland;Paying in England 1260. and in Holland 60. 1. she that com∣meth into England▪ payeth for custome, Prisedge, Butleredge, and other charges thereon by booke of rates, one thousand two hundred pounds and upwards, be∣fore she bee discharged, and the other going for Holland is discharged there for threescore pound sterlin, or there abouts; so that after they have there unladen their said ship, and custome being paid, and the wines sold, the buyer can trans∣port them againe into some other coun∣trey; and, if hee should in the second place but gaine this custome that was paid in England, yea or halfe so much, hee would thinke to have gained very well thereby: but it is not possible for any English man to pay this great custome in England, and to transport them againe in∣to another Kingdome, but he must be a great loser by them; for the Hollander can still under-sell him, and yet be a gainer thereby. In 200. uns of Tobacco. The like may bee alledged of two ships, of two hundred tuns a peece, com∣ming
alike laden, with 200. tuns of To∣bacco from Barmuda, Saint Christopher, or any other English Plantation: now, this 200. tuns paying custome, &c. in Eng∣land, vvill amount unto 10000. pounds, whereas in Holland the said 200. tuns will bee cleared for 120. pounds. Now though the said 200. tuns of Tobacco should be here againe shipped out with∣in the yeare, and the impost repaid him, yet the Merchant loseth infinitly by bringing it into the kingdome, which he would account for wonderfull gaine, might hee enjoy the same upon all the whole parcell towards all his adventure, interest and charges. But some Princes may imagine that this will too much diminish their cu∣stomes,These small customes, wil increase the totall cu∣stome of a Kingdome. and draw their Revenewes to a low estate: but I rather hold the same will bee a meanes to increase the same; for though a Prince should for the ease of his people, and the augmentation of the trade of his Countrey, take but a small custome upon all forraine goods
imported, and thus exported with the reservations mentioned in the second consideration of trade▪ yet he may have a moderate custome to be paid him, up∣on all goods vented within the King∣dome, as is now used in England; and the multiplicity of trade, which will be pro∣cured by this staple, and small custome, whereof there is not otherwise accru∣ing to the Prince any profit at all, wil much increase the same in the totall. Presuppose that this staple of traffike, furthered with such immunities and smalness of customes, were in some one, two, or three convenient Towns settled here in England, let us consider the good in generall, that by the former assertion it would produce to us. First the Merchants would be enabled to export the commodities of France,Benefits ari∣sing to Eng∣land by a sta∣ple of trade. Spaine, Italy, Turky, and Barbary, and of the East and West India, into the Kingdomes of Germany, Poland, Denmarke, Swethland, Pomerland, Sprucia, and Lifeland, and the merchandise of those other counties,
which are both many and usefull, will againe be transported from the said sta∣ple, to those Southerne and Westerne Countries, and hereby the Merchants would mightily flourish by this inlarge∣ment of trade. Secondly, diverse sea-Townes, where this staple should be kept would be very much enriched. Thirdly, the Mariners and shipping of this Kingdome, would hereby come to be very much enlarged and im∣ployed. Fourthly, many poore people, and other handy crafts men and labourers, would be hereby set on worke, and im∣ployed. Fifthly, the honour and reputation of this Kingdome will be much advanced in other countries, and much Bullion would thereby come to be imported. Sixthly, it will keepe all sorts of graine at a reasonable price, both for the buyer and seller, and the countrey should al∣wayes bee well provided with corne,
if dearth should happen, and thereby also retaine our coine, which upon such an occasion is usually exported. Lastly, the customes of England would bee much increased by intercourse of trade, both by Importation and Expor∣tation of all sorts of foraine commodi∣ties, whereof we have no use our selves, and whereof His Majesty hath at pre∣sent no custome at all, because there is no such course of trade in use. Having thus shewed how this staple of trade is to be setled, and what benefit it brings with it to that countrey where the same is erected, and may bring to us were the same here setled; and because in all Kingdomes it is a worke of time and much difficulty, and that our ordinary States-men doe neither seriously consi∣der, nor truly weigh the reall benefits that arise to a Kingdome and people by the hand of traffike; I will here in the last place, for conclusion of this conside∣ration, shew that a maine Furtherer of a countries traffie, and the only way for
the preservation therof, being once acqui∣red, is to settle by authority of the Sove∣raign a selected number of able and dis∣creet Merchants, with power and suffici∣ent priviledge, to examine the disorders of traffike, and irregular Traders, and to re∣duce the same to such orders, and con∣stitutions as may stand with the benefit and good of the Soveraigne, his countrey and subjects; and these Merchants to be either sworne and admitted into the Princes counsell, or have a superinten∣dency over the generall Commerce of the kingdom, by themselves entituled as State-merchants, or Merchant States-men; the benefit of whose endeavour, skill, judgement, and discretion thus authorised, I shall by these few rules offer to the consideration of the Iudicious. It is by all Statesmen accounted a truth undeniable,By inlarge∣ment of traf∣fike. that the wealth and welfare of all countries (where the subject exer∣ciseth traffike with forraine nations) is mainely frthred, and much advanced by the regular orders, and merchantlike
rules thereof, and more especially in that of Englands, by nature commodiously seated to that end, and of purpose; the procurement of which wealth and wel∣fare by the inlargement of Commerce, and the well ordering and regulating thereof, cannot be so fully effected, nor the hindrances fore-seene, nor the pre∣judices so soone avoided by a meere States-man, as the same can be by a dis∣creet Merchant, qualified with power from the Prince to that purpose. By importa∣tion and ex∣portation. of Bullion. Secondly, the importation of Bullion to the Princes Mint, or exportation of his coyne out of his countrey, cannot be so well fore-seene and prevented as by the Merchant, who by the course of traffike, knowes the impediments of the one, and the preventions of the other. 3. By under∣valuing of native wares. Thirdly, the under-valuing of the home-bred, and native commodities of a Kingdome, and the over-valuing in that Kingdome of forraine commodi∣ties, with the discommodity of both to
the common wealth, nor the causes thereof, cannot be so well knowne to a States-man, nor by him be prevented, as the same can to a Merchant, qualified with power thereunto. Fourthly,4. By new Plantations. the inlargement of trade by any new Inventions Plantations, or Dis∣coveries of new traffikes, cannot be by any so well furthered, as by a qualified Merchant, who best knowes by reason of his trade, what priviledges are fit to be granted, what customes invvards and outwards to be imposed, and for the in∣couragement of the Merchants, and Vndertakers in these said courses. Fifthly,5. By rising and falling of custmes. it is granted that the greatnesse of customes, and other duties upon Merchants goods, in all places diminish∣eth the trade of a Kingdome, and the smalnesse of the same inlargeth the trade thereof; now a meere States-man conceives not what commodities are fit∣test to be eased, and vvhich are to be rai∣sed for the common good, and profit of the trade of that Countrey.
6 By imploy∣ment of workemen in the Manu∣factories. Sixthly, the generall imployment of all the poore of a kingdom in the work∣manship of native, and home-bred com∣modities, and foraine materials impor∣ted (now too little regarded by many States-men in many Kingdomes) may with more ease and speed be put in Exe∣cution by a States-merchant then by a meere States-man, as is seene in the dying and dressing of clothes in England, and in the prosecution of the Fishing-trade, lately here set on foot by the care and industry of divers noble personages, and lost for want of experienced men in that profession to manage the same. 7. By fur∣nihing de∣ayed twns. Seventhly, as a matter worthy of a Princes consideration, the furnishing of decayed haven Townes, with inhabi∣tants, Mariners, and shipping in a king∣dome, and the needfull helps and furthe∣rances thereto, with a profitable trade to maintaine both, to their, and the Prince and countries good, is better performed by a Merchant, then by a meere States∣man.
8. By provi∣ding of corn in dearth. Eighthly, the continuall furnihing of a Kingdome with corne at cheape rates, yea even in times of Dearth, the want whereof some yeares past the last great Dearth, inriched Holland for seven yeares following, and impoverished England full as long, by their exportation of two mil∣lions of pounds, as is conceived that year out of all ports of this Kingdome in gold, wherein a meer States-man knows not the way, neither how to provide for the one, nor yet how to prevent the other; which notwithstanding a Mer∣chant can with ase, and better husband∣dry accomplish and performe. Ninthly,9. By setling of a staple of trade. the setling of a staple, or free∣dome of trade in a kingdome, in com∣modious and fit places, with fit and ad∣vantageable priviledges, and how the same is to be governed and directed, and wherein to be restrained and limited, is onely within the knowledge of a Mer∣chant, and fittest for his direction, which a meere States-man doth not so well un∣derstand, nor can judge of.
10. By weak∣ning the ene∣mies by trade. Tenthly, Salomon saith, that wisdome is better then the weapons of warre, therefore a Merchant can in times of warres with foraine Princes, better direct how to weaken his enemies, in course of their traffike, and preiudice them in the point of their profit, and crosse their designed intentions, for provision of warfare, more then the best States-man can doe by open hostility. 11. By trea∣tises of peace in trade. Tenthly, In concluding of a peace, or in the making of leagues, and amity with foraine Princes, the Merchant can ad∣vise of the fitting conditions, to bee in∣sisted upon, and obtained in the point of traffike, for the advancement of his King and Countrey, which a Statesman doth not so much regard, nay many times not yet understand. 12. By forain intelligence. Twelfth, A Merchant that hath beene resident, many yeares in foraine parts, and sometimes hath remained all that time in one and the same Countrey, and hath afterwards continuall advice from his Factors there resident, by reason of
his daily trading thither, of all the oc∣currences of the place, with their pro∣visions made there for arming of hrse, foot, or shipping, must needs conse∣quently understand thereof, and the affaires of those parts, better then those that never were thre, or but cursorily to see fashions, and that peradventure many yeares before that time. Thirteenth,13. By sup∣pressing of trades depen∣ding upon ex∣portation of coyne. A Merchant knowes by his observations in course of trade, that there bee some trades in a Kingdome, which cannot subsist, nor bee driven without exportation of the coyne of that kingdome and place, or which cause the diversion of Bullion from the Mint of that place, which are not to bee che∣rished, as those trades are which doe nei∣ther; all which a meere States-man can∣not so well comprehend, and take no∣tice of. Fourteenth,14. By che∣rishing some trades that subsist by coyn. A Merchant doth know that there be some trades againe, which cannot subsist without this exportation of the coine of a kingdome, and have a
necessary dependance thereon, which yet notwithstanding are to be cherish∣ed, sometimes equall, sometimes above other trades, by reason that the same trade begets another advantageable trade, that doth more profit to the king∣dome, then the exportation of that coyn doth prejudice the same; which a States-man can neither discerne, nor take no∣tice of. 15. By acts prejudiciall to trade. Fifteenth, A Merchant doth know what decrees and ordinances made in a Kingdome, doe further and enlarge the trade therof, and which againe in them∣selves doe hurt and prejudice the same: also what decrees and ordinances are en∣acted in foraine states or countries, that are injurious and hurtfull to the trade and countrey where he abides, and how to meet with, and prevent the same by counter Decrees, and Regulations; which a meere States-man doth neither know, nor can of himselfe prevent or have notice of. 16. By re∣medying the foraine disor∣ders in trade. Sixteenth, A Merchant doth find by
his traffike into foraine parts, what com∣modities, and what nations are eased by foraine Princes within their dominions, to the end that by charging of some, and easing of other some, they covet to be∣nefit some nations more then other, and further the vent of some commodities more then others, redounding to the prejudice and ill consequence of the Kingdome of his aboade and residency; which the Merchant can in a short time both prevent and remedy, to the good of that Kingdome where hee lives; but the States-man cannot in a long time find out, nor yet being found out reme∣dy it, till peradventure the remedy be worse then the disease. Seventeenth,17. By carry∣ing out or in of commodi∣ties hurtfull or beneficial to a king∣dome. A Merchant knoweth what commodities can bee drawne out of another countrey, to the benefit of his owne, and what commodities are carried out of his owne countrey, to the prejudice (as Iron-Ordnance are in Eng∣land,) or benefit of ano ther, and can by regular orders in the course of traffike
hinder the importation, and exportation of what is hurtfull, or any way dam∣mageable to the Kingdome of his aboade, and further the importation and exportation of such commodities as are prejudiciall to the traffike of the strange and remote Countrey; which the States-man for want of knowledge in merchandising cannot effect or ac∣complish. 18. By im∣portation of materials for Manufa∣ctories. Eighteenth, A Merchant can advance his Countrey by the importation of materials for Manufactories to bee wrought at home, and by this meanes set multitudes of poore on work, to the great benefit of the place of his aboade, and can by reason of his travels into foraine parts, where hee sees the natu∣rall and profitable commodities of other Nations, transport the same, and some∣times plant them in his owne native soyle, for his Countries good and ho∣nour; which the States-man cannot without great difficulty performe and effect.
Lastly,19. Foraine decrees that prejudice navigation and shipping. the Merchant best knowes what Decrees are constituted in foraine Countries, that hinder the Navigation, and diminish the shipping of the countrey of his aboade, and what orders and injunctions are imposed at home, that insensibly ruine and destroy the same, either by meanes of grants, made to private persons to the prejudice thereof; or by innova∣tions imposed by Farmers, or other Vnder-officers, that either destroyeth the same, or tendeth to the discou∣ragement of Sea-men; which meere States-men cannot so soone discerne, nor yet in fitting times remedy. To conclude this point, having thus shewed the courses that are used in sundry Countries, for the setling, preserving, and augmenta∣tion of Commerce in generall, and withall considered how farre in his owne person a Merchant is able to benefit, and advance his Countrey and place of his aboade, and how a staple of
trade may bee erected, setled and privi∣ledged with fitting liberties, to gaine an ample traffike where none is, and shew∣ed withall the commodities that arise to the Countrey, where the same is so set∣led and maintained. The endea∣vours of sun∣dry Princes to gaine traf∣fike. I will now, for conclusion of this third consideration, run through and briefly survey the marvellous care, cost and paines, that severall Princes have willing∣ly beene at and undergone, to compasse the same. By what hath beene said then in this consideration, and upon this point, it may be gathered, that the obtaining and acquisition of a traffike at the first is very difficult, being as a precious Iewell which must be sought after, courted and purchased with many priviledges, liber∣ties & immunities, and sometimes with the very example of the Prince him∣selfe, because that the honour, benefit, and commodity that doth still attend it (as I shall declare in the close of this dis∣course) extends itselfe both to the So∣veraigne,
his Nobles, Kingdome, and subjects in generall: and to the end that it may appeare, that all Iudicious Princes, and Politick States▪men have thus jud∣ged thereof, and found the effects of the same answerable to this my assertion; I will here briefly declare, and shew the industrious paines, and painefull endea∣vours of sundry the wisest Princes of Europe, to acquire, purchase and obtaine this so excellent a Iewell. The Dukes of Toscany,The practise of the Duke of Florence to get the trade of Leghorne. being ever ac∣counted expert Exchangers, finding that their Dukedome, by reason of the want of a Sea-port, for the receit of shipping, was very unfit to entertaine a trade by Navigation, purchased the town and Territory of Leghorne, of the Com∣mon-wealth of Genoa, at the rate (as some report) of one hundred and twen∣ty thousand Dollers (it being then a poor Fisher-towne, capable only to receive small Barkes, and that of no considera∣ble burthen) and did, for the inlarging of his traffike by sea, adde a faire and pretty
new built-Towne to the old, fortifying the same with Wals, Ditches, Castles, a Bannia for his slaves, and a Lasseretta, or a Pest-house, to receive both the goods and persons of such as should arrive there from contagious and infected parts; then he gave a dwelling to all for seven yeares gratis, that would come to inhabit there, then hee erected a watch-Tower with a strong mould to pre∣serve the ships that anchor there from the violence of all weathers; he gives his Merchants many priviledges, cuts a ditch for twenty miles, to convey and cary up all commodities to Pisa, and so to Florence the Metropolis of his Duke∣dome; to conclude, by making it a free scale, and that all manner of goods, wares and monies may bee freely ship∣ped inwards, and outwards, without any charge or custome; and that when commodities doe arrive, which the pur∣ses of his subjects will not, or cannot purchase, he hath himselfe bought up the same, and that sometimes to his losse and prejudice, hee hath I say by these and other the like meanes within this 25. or 30. yeares, made this the greatest port of traffike in all the Mediterranean seas, to his owne great honour, and to the ex∣ceeding profit, and commodity of him∣selfe, and all his subjects in generall. The Hollanders,Of the Hol∣landers to support their trade. who have need of all the politike helps that can be, to sup∣port the charges of their war against a potent enemy, who is continually ready at their doores to give them the alarme, yet so well doe study this point of traf∣fike, and make so much of Commerce in their countrey, where indeed they hold but a hand-full (as it were) of land to abide in; though, I say, they have annu∣all Armies afoot, which doth cost them infinite, vaste and great sums to main∣taine and nourish, and that their very bread, meate, and beere which is eaten by them, doth first pay the States an ex∣cise thereon; yet in all their extremities, dangers and debts, they have erected many staples of trade in their coun∣tries,
and also raised an East-India and West-India Company of Merchants, with large priviledges, which they have prosecuted with happy & good success, wheron, notwithstanding their great dis∣bursements, they impose little or no cu∣stomes at all, their interests are easie, their Companies countenanced, and protected by the Estates, and their Fleets are ready in our Channell, to safe-guard and defend both the Merchants, Mari∣ners and Fisher-men from the depreda∣tion, and violence of either enemies or Robbers. Of the Ve∣netians. I am not able to recount how, and with what care and industry the Vene∣tians maintaine their traffike, and the li∣berties of their subjects; in point of Commerce they ease them of customes, give large priviledges to their Mariners, injoyne their ancient gentlemen, and Cla∣rissimi to use the sea, make daily sundry advantagable decrees and orders for the suppressing of foraine traffike, and ad∣vancing of their owne, keepe a selected
Court of the best experienced Mer∣chants, to superintend other Commerce, and have a stocke ever in readinesse by the name of Cottimo to expend both in Turky and other places, for the defence of their Merchants and their Estates, from all wrong and injuries. Yet none of these comes neere the care and industrious prudence,Of the East Kings of Por∣tugall. practised by Iohn and Emanuell, Kings of Portugall, in erecting, prosecuting, and setling the trade of the East-India, with such provi∣dent decrees and immunities for the or∣dering of their returnes, Lectures for the instruction of their Pilots, and Sea-men, building of Forts and Holds to make good and preserve their traffike, to their exceeding honour and profit in getting those small Ilands of India, but of most notable consequence, Mosambike, Ormus, Dieu, Goa and Mallacca, fit Receptacles of trade and strength, and which have to this day preserved to them the Com∣merce of all others, the parts of India. Isabella, that famous Queene of Castile,
having by her Christian Piety spent her owne estate in prosecution of the wars against the Moors of Granada, Mutia, &c. when yet she and her husband Ferdinan∣do's Crownes and Revenues were drawne dry, and farre ingaged in cha∣sing those Barbarians out of their Kingdomes, then when Henry the seventh, accounted amongst the wi∣sest of our English Kings, had un∣happily refused Columbus, the Genoes his offer, for the discovery of the We∣sterne Continent, now termed America, then I say being laden with her greatest debts and engagements, her Coffers, empty, her Church plate spent, and all drawne to the lowest ebbe by loanes and interests, then did shee for in∣couragement to all her subjects, and for to comply with the resolution of that brave Italian, pawne her owne wearing Iewels, to set him out in three Carvels; where how he thrived, and how that Kingdome, Prince and Peo∣ple have beene bettered thereby ever¦since,
the whole Christian world may witnesse at this day, as England hath had just cause to repent of ever af∣ter. But Henry the seventh having now seene his errour,Of Hen. the 7. of England. and apparently dis∣cerned what hee had lost by his parci∣mony, endeavoured to make amends to his Kingdome, and people, cal∣ling hither Sebastian Cabot, also a skil∣full Pilot, Genoes giving him both encouragement, honours, and em∣ployment; but the issue of his en∣deavours did not answer that Kings expectation, though after his life the same was prosecuted in King Henry the eighth's dayes with various suc∣cesse. And though Margaret Countesse of Flanders did, in envy to him, set up Perkin Werbeque to disturbe the peace of England, and that that mocke Prince came at length to bee a Scul∣lion in his Kitchin; yet that wise Prince found another more noble
revenge to himselfe, and more profitable to his people, by setling here the Manu∣factories of Clothing, and the strict pro∣hibition of the Exportation of English wools, which cost him  two yeares, (as I have beene informed) neare one hundred thousand pounds, a mighty masse of monies, the Prince and times considered: but England soone found the benefit thereof;Anno 1515. for in Anno 1515. the English having removed their staple from Bridges to Antwerpe, where the aforesaid Kings of Portugall had then set∣led their Contractors, for the vent of their new gained East-Indian spices, it was noted by those Registers of Com∣merce kept in that place, and left to po∣sterity by Guicciardin, that hath written their Chronicle, that the English Com∣pany of Merchant-adventurers did bring thither clothing to the summe of, which was in value 9. of 15. parts of all the other commodities and wares brought thither of all other the nations whatsoever.
What a brave designe Edward the sixt his Grand-child had,Of Edward the 6. for the setling of sundry staples for that and other com∣modities in England, and how that by reason of the then poverty of his Mer∣chants, hee intended, upon security, to lend them out of his Treasury great summes for the effecting thereof; I have briefly touched before, and for conclu∣sion of this point, looke a little into Queene Elizabeths dayes,Of Queene Elizabet. who though she was ever accompanied with state af∣faires of mighty consequence, some∣times at home, and sometimes abroad; yet was she ever so careful to set forward traffike, and encourage Navigators, that both Earles, Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and of every degree, willingly thrust themselves in search of new traffikes and adventures, and to her dayes are wee beholding for the trades of Barbary and Italy, and other places, and for the discoveries of Turky, Egypt, India, Russia, Muscovia, and Greenland, and the trades set∣led by the English therein; which hath
since found such fortunate successe, to the benefit of our now happy Sove∣raigne, and his Crownes, that the cu∣stomes were in her time, some yeares before her death, farmed but at four∣teene thousand pounds, which Smith, commonly called Customer Smith,Customes increased in 50. yeares in England, from 14 to 500. thousand pounds a yeare. in one yeare petitioned for reliefe, as ha∣ving beene a loser thereby, and now in lesse then fifty yeres is come to five hun∣dred thousand pounds yearely, if report gaine credit to the Kings purse; and how much more the Farmers have made thereof, His Majesties custome bookes can best manifest.Princes that have gained traffike must be carefull to preserve it. If then Princes of all ages, and the wisest of all Princes, have made it part of their study, and have in many occurrences prejudiced them∣selves, and their estates, to win this so excellent a benefit, how carefull need all Princes to be when the same is brought to perfection, to preserve and cherish it, and not to suffer the liberties of their Merchants to be incroached upon, the freedome of their traffike, to be fettered
by heavy imposts, customes, and Inno∣vations, which are like Cankers that doe insensibly eate out and ruine a trade be∣fore the Prince, or the wisest of his Counsellors, can see how to prevent or remedy it. The want of this care,Townes that have lost their traffike by want of care and good order. and provident foresight hath lost many kings the traf∣fike of their Kingdomes, which were the best Iewels of their Crownes, and the richest flower in their Diadems: The want of good orders in the government of the trade of Antwerpe,Antwerpe. and the impo∣sing of heavy customes upon the Mer∣chants there trading, hath within this fifty yeares brought that Towne to the lownesse wherein now wee see it.Lyons. Lions in France hath suffered wonderfully by the same inconveniences;Marsilia. and Marsilia within the dayes of my knowledge had a wonderfull great traffike for many pla∣ces of Turky, Barbary, Spaine, and other kingdomes, and was then able to shew many ships imployed in merchandise, carrying thirty and forty peeces of Ord∣nance
and now which is not above 24. in 25. yeares past, the best of their ves∣sels have not above ten peeces, and of those but very few neither. English East-India trade. Here I could also particularize, the fet∣ters Incroachments, and Intrusions that have within these late yeares beene laid upon the East-India traders of England, and their liberties, and what they have suffe∣red both abroad and at home, by the ill wishers of their prosperity; but what will it availe them, or benefit our coun∣trey, to travell into the disturbations, crosses and afflictions, which they have, to their prejudice, felt, and to their losse suffered? It sufficeth me here to say, that the want of due and timely protection, and incouragement from the Estate, hath reduced them to that bad point, and low passe, wherein we now observe them to bee; and that for the future erecting of such a brave society, a great deale of time, and mony must be expended, and many larger immunities then formerly must be granted, ere the same can be reduced to
that pristine flourishing estate we lately have beheld it to be in. I could also here,Turke, and Moscovia Company in England. by way of addition, say somewhat of those disturbances, that the Turky, Moscovia, and other Compa∣nies of London have groaned under; but I trust the goodnesse of our Soveraigne, and the wisdome of his Counsellors, will rectifie the same, or remunerate them by fitting encouragements some other wayes; lest thereby the same be re∣duced to the present condition of the East-India Company, to His Majesties great losse and dishonour, and to the wonderfull prejudice of his people and kingdomes. Now, having thus handled the 3. first considerations of trade, & observed that neither naturall nor artificiall commodi∣ties of a kingdom can inrich a countrey without the helpe and hand of traffike; and then shewed what commodities by a well ordered traffike, a Kingdome must suffer entrance, and what prohibit, and what againe to send out, and also what
to forbid, and withall shewed the par∣ticular meanes and wayes that Princes are observed to use to gaine, settle, pre∣serve, and augment the same with the la∣borious and studious courses that have beene taken by sundry late Princes to ob∣taine and purchase this so beneficiall a commodity: I come now to the last point and consideration before mentio∣ned, wherein the rest is for the most part comprehended,The reasons that doe move Prin∣ces to covet trade in their Kingdomes. being the reasons and causes that move all estates, Kings and Empires to covet the same, which I may say doth extend it selfe into foure heads and principall parts. 1 Honoura∣ble. The first is, that traffike with foraine nations is notable in respect of the ho∣nour and reputation thereof. 2 Rich. Secondly, excellent in point of riches, both to the King, his Countrey, and Sub∣jects. 3 Strong. Thirdly, eminent in regard of strength offensive, and defensive, that it brings
with it to the Countrey and Princes where it is orderly managed; and regu∣larly practised by skilfull Merchants. First then,Ttraffike is honourable to the people and country. a well governed traffike, practised in a Kingdome, by judicious and expert Merchants, to foraine and re∣mote countries will easily bee granted, and confessed to bee both honourable, and of singular reputation, both to the Soveraigne in his particular, and to the nation in generall. I need not seeke farre for examples, nor search much for ar∣guments to make this good and mani∣fest, but only looke upon this our king∣dome wherein wee live. How had ever the name of the English beene knowne in India,Experienced in the Eng∣lish. Persia, Moscovia, or in Turky, and in many places else-where, had not the traffike of our Nation dis∣covered and spread abroad the fame of their Soveraigne Potency, and the re∣nowne of that peoples valour and worth? Many parts of the world had, peradventure even to this day, lived
in ignorance thereof, and never dreamt of the inhabitants of so small an Iland, had not the traffike of the Merchants by Navigation made it famous over all those remote Regions. And in the Portugall and Hollan∣der. Nay, the Portugals, and Hollanders, an ob∣scure people, in comparison of the Eng∣lish, and enjoying but a handfull of those subjects, that are comprehended under the Scepter of great Britaine, have by this onely meanes given witnesse and good testimony, to many powerfull remote nations, of their countries worth and honour. What brought the Portugall nation to to be famoused in Affrica and Asia, or the Spanish name to bee notable in America, but her traffike and Commerce. The com∣merce, and not the con∣quests of the English have made them famous in India. It is not our conquests, but our Com∣merce; it is not our swords, but our sayls, that first spred the English name in Bar∣bary, and thence came into Turky, Armenia, Moscovia, Arabia, Persia, India, China, and in∣deed over and about the world; it is the traffike of their Merchants, and the
boundlesse desires of that nation to eter∣nize the English honour and name, that hath enduced them to saile, and seek into all the corners of the earth. What part is there unsearched, what place undis∣covered, or what place lyes unattemp∣ted by their endeavours, and couragious undertakings? most of which hath beene accompanied with such fortunate suc∣cesse,League con∣tracted by the English Merchants with foraine Princes. that they have contracted Leagues and Amity with the Mogull, Persian, Turke, Moscovite, and other mighty fo∣raine Princes in their Soveraignes name, and to his honour; which even in our Fathers dayes was not knowne to us, ei∣ther to have any such condition, or being the Merchants of England. And to speak truth of London, maintaining now at their charge an Agent in Moscovia, an Ambassa∣dour and three Consuls in Turky, and cer∣taine Presidents and Agents also in India, Persia, and many other places thereof, which by computation cannot cost them lesse then one hundred thousand pounds yearely (which though it mayAt their own charge 100000. l. yearely.
be alledged is for their own profit, & the benefit of their traffike into these parts) yet for as much as that it is not charge∣able to their Soveraigne, nor prejudiciall, but profitable to his Kingdomes, it must be granted that the same brings honour to his name, and a great benefit both to him and his subjects; and it is more then can be paralleld in all other Christian or heathen Countries now in the world. The Danes, Sweeds and Germans not knowne in India, &c. The Danes and Swedish nations are potent, and the French are yet more powerfull in Europe; yet if you travell into India, Persia, and many of those Easterne Kingdomes of the world, they know of no such people, Kings or Coun∣tries, but hold all Europe to be inhabited by the Portugals, English and Dutch; nay the French are hardly knowne in Moscovia and Russia, save by name, but not by their worth or actions; and the Em∣perour of Germany, the greatest of our Christian Princes, for all his eminence and power in Christendome, is not in India, knowne, no nor yet in Persia, save
for some leagues, which the Sophy would sometimes have contracted with him, to the prejudice of Turky, and the Ottoman Empire. So that by what hath beene said, the Commerce of Merchants, though many times it be accompanied with losse and prejudice to themselves, and estates, and that they are enforced to expose their fortunes to the mercy of mercilesse stormes and tempests, & be subject to the Lawes of Heathenish Princes, and groan under the heavy customes of many So∣veraignes and Infidels; yet is it still at∣tended upon with a great deale of ho∣nour to their owne Prince, and reputa∣tion to his subjects: Therefore I will conclude here this point, that a well or∣dered traffike managed by skilfull Mer∣chants, hath beene, and ever will be, ho∣nourable to that Kingdome and Sove∣raigne, where the same is duely practi∣sed, and carefully protected, and preser∣ved.2. Traffike is excellent in point of Riches, tw wayes. The second point is in regard of
Riches, and the benefit that traffike bringeth with it, where the same is pre∣served with fitting priviledges, and pra∣ctised with regular order and method; and this Riches extendeth it selfe two wayes. 1 To the King and his Nobles. In the first place to the Soveraigne, his Nobles and Gentry, in the particular of their owne estates and Interests. 2 To his people. Secondly to his subjects, the inhabi∣tants in generall; As to the Sea-men, Husbandmen, Artificers, Labourers, and others. How it in∣richeth the King. First for the Prince, or Soveraigne, it particularly inricheth him by his cu∣stomes and imposts, imposed inwards, and outwards upon all commodities and wares, either imported or exported, in or out of his Kingdomes and Domi∣nions, by the Merchant, and also by ven∣ting, and dispersing of such wares, and merchandises, as hee appropriateth to himselfe, either by purchase, preroga∣tive, or by right of his Crowne; as we find it to doe by the Gabell of Bay-salt,
to the King of France, by the property of silke to the King of Persia, by the Mines of Copper to the grand Signior, and by the preemtion of Tyn to His Maje∣stie of England,How the Nobility. and next it proveth bene∣ficiall to the Nobility and Gentry, by the improvement of their lands, by the sale and working of their clothes, by the use of their Timber, by the vent of their Cattle, Graine, and other provisions, and in many regards, which experience dai∣ly maketh evident, both in this, and all other Kingdoms where the same is pra∣ctised. Secondly,How the countrey. it inricheth the inhabitants of a countrey in the generall, by setting Arts-men on worke, by imploying the poore, by furthering and incouraging of all professions whatsoever; for every Arts-man, Worke-man and Artificer, is conducible one way or other to traffike, and every hand is set on worke, where a wel governed Commerce is observed to be driven, and exercised by judicious and skilfull Merchants, and to the whole
countrey in generall it is found benefi∣ciall by venting the native commodities of that land, as experience tels us, in Per∣sia by the vent of their raw silkes, in France by the vent of their Wines, Oyles, Lynens, Graine, &c. in Zante by the vent of their Corrence, in Spaine by the vent of their Wines, Fruits, Sugars, &c. and in England by the vent of their Tinne, Cloath, Lead, &c. as the like may be said of many other countries. 3. Traffike produceth strength two wayes. Thirdly and lastly, it produceth strength and safety to the Kingdom and people, where the same is duly and or∣derly practised. That which begets wealth, also doth beget strength. Now this strength and safety may be considered two wayes; either defensive or offensive: if my former assertions be granted, That a well ordered trade doth enrich a Prince, his nobles, gentiles and Subjects, as of necessity it must, it will be easie for mee to make good this point also; for that which produceth Riches, doth consequently also beget strength and safety, so farre forth as trea∣sure
is accounted the principal nerve and sinnew of war, either offensive, or defen∣sive; but to come to some particulars It furnisheth the Prince,How traffike doth beget strength. and his sub∣jects, having maritime ports, with plen∣ty of shipping, and store of Mariners, to manage and sayle the same, in all oc∣casions of the state and countrey by sea▪ and it furnisheth the same with all fitting Ammunition of and for warre, as Powder, Armes, and other the like necessaries; and by land it maketh the countrey a Magazine, not only for war∣like provisions, brought in for the use of the Prince, and the Kingdom it selfe, but also for all other neighbouring countries that stand in need thereof. I may here fitly bring in Holland to make good this point to all the world,An excellent plo of the Hollanders to inrch themselves. who, though exercised in continuall warfare, and daily pressed, and some∣times oppressed by a potent Enemy; yet their industrious traffike into Forrain parts, is handled and practised with so much benefit, countenanced from
the State and good Iudgement, that the same doth not onely supply their owne occasions, with what warlike provisions they want, but withall have thereof in such abundance, that from their owne states they furnish freely all other neigh∣bouring countries whatsoever there∣with; for the Arts-men that are by them employed daily, in building of ships, ca∣sting of Artillery, making of Muskets, shot, powder, swords, pikes, corslets, cor∣dage, Canvas, and the like Habiliments of warre, doe not only supply their owne turnes, and necessities, and that both cheape and plentifull; but herein pro∣ceed so farre, contrary to the politike Rules of many countries, that they sell, and vent their over-plus; yea even to the Spaniards their very enemies conceiving it, no ill trick of thrift, nor yet small point of State-stratagem, to draw thus the monies and wealth of their greatest ad∣versaries to be a reward to their owne labour and industry, and so sell as it may be said (for monies to their foes) the
very sword, which peradventure may aftewards be imployed in the cutting of their owne throats, but being instru∣ments considerable, and which must necessarily be had in warre, and which will be by their enemies had else-where for monies, if not of them, they chuse rather thus to sell them, and so by per∣mitting an unusuall policy of state, en∣deavour for their monies to give them with their owne consents, and that vo∣luntarily, and of their owne accord, what they cannot with their best of policie otherwise prevent, and what their enemies will bee furnished with∣all, in despight of their utmost endea∣vours else-where. I need not insist further upon this point, having declared the honour, be∣nefit, and strength, both offensive and defensive, which doth arise to a Com∣mon-wealth or Countrey by a well or∣dered traffike, managed by Regular and Iudicious Merchants, I could here adde to what I have said before in the behalfe
of the Merchant, and shew that as hee can in many things advance his coun∣trey before a meere States-man, so also declare the Nobility of his art, and the excellency of his profession, no one vocation in the world requiring a more generall knowledge, and inspection into all other professions then this doth; and withall make it appeare, that hee is the best of Common-wealths men, both towards his Prince, and fellow-sub∣jects; and that for the most part all other professions live, and have their subsi∣stence from others, hee onely giving by traffike a lively-hood to others, and no way dependent, but upon himselfe, and his owne labour and endeavours; as it will easily appeare to any judicious man that shall examine his profession, and compare the same with others. But I will conclude this discourse, and take it by what hath beene said for granted, as for a truth undeniable, That the excellency of a well ordered traf∣fike, is such and so singular, and the
effects thereof so notably beneficiall to a kingdome, and in its selfe so admira∣ble, and the discreet and skilfull Mer∣chants endeavours so laudable, and his art so eminently honorable, that it re∣quireth and duly challengeth A Royall Protection, and Reall Encouragement from all Kings and Princes, a faire respect from all Nobles, a love from all persons, and well wishes from all those their Countrey∣men, that tender the Profit, Advancement and Honour, both of the King and Countrey, &c.
