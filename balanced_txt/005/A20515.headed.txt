¶ A dyurnall: for deuoute sou¦les: to ordre them selfe therafter. depiction of St. John writing the Book of Revelation on Patmos, actually the altered printer's device of Robert Wyer (who worked at the sign of St. John the Evangelist in the Bishop of Norwich's rents at Charing Cross)
depiction of the Crucifixion, with the Virgin Mary and St. John at the foot of the Cross
Ihesus. Maria. THe great cause (as I do thyn¦ke) why we profyte lytell in the way of perfeccion is: that we do not with al our studye and dylygēce / folowe by per∣seueraunt exercyse in our dayly conuersacy on / the good instruccyons and counceylles that be daylye gyuen vs of oure lorde god. The whiche for the gracyous desyre that he hath of our saluacyon: ceaseth not to admo∣nysshe and teche vs / howe we shuld ensue and optayne our soules helth: and his perpe¦tuall fauoure: not onely by secret inspyracy on / but also by outwarde techynges and en samples: that oft tymes we rede & se. And this defaulte in ve ryseth partly of our ne∣lygence / that we gyue no great force of our owne profyte: partly of our frayle and obly¦uyous memory / that soon forgetteth what is taught vs: but yf by often rehersynge it be depesy wryten and grauen in oure stony hertes. ¶ Agaynst the fyrste the onely reme¦dy is a good wyll / the which with the helpe of grace (daylye desyrynge by contynuall prayers to amende) shall at the last opteyne that it perseuerantly desyreth. Agaynst the seconde defaulte the remedy is: often tymes
to rede or here those thynges the which wol¦de alwaye be had in mynde. wherfore I ha¦ue accordynge to your deuout request / noted breuely ī this lytel papyre thre exercyses: the which I haue many tymes coūceylled you to vse at thre tymes of the daye specyally / that is to say in the mornynge when ye ryse∣at your meate / and when ye go to reste. ¶ In the mornynge. AS soon as ye be ful wakyn¦ge marke well what thyng cōmeth fyrst to your mynde And yf ye haue ben wakyn¦ge at any tyme of the nyght past / what remēbraūce ye haue had of god. And yf ye fynde that any thynge hath occu¦pyed your hert then the rule of perfeccyon re¦quyreth / the whiche is that our herte be at al¦tymes vnyd and knytte vnto god / eyther by actuall loue and contemplacyon of his goodnes with de we thankes gyuynge for his benefytes / or elles by contynuall prayer & confessyon of our owne euylles. ¶ Then anone with great heuynes complayne of your selfe knowlegyng that this īperfeccy∣on
is founde in you for want of dylygent ghostly exercyse in the tyme past. And with a feruent desyre to amende from thensforth: begyn anone with humble prostracyō both of spyryte and also of body (yf ye be alone) to prayse the gloryous trynyte sayeng thus. ¶ O beata et benedicta & gloriosa trinitas tibi laus et gloria et grati¦arū actio ab omni creatura tua per¦infinita secula seculorum. Amen. Thus in sentence. O blyssed and gloryous trynyte / laude / glory and thankes be to the of all thy creatures / worlde without any ende. Amen. ¶ And when ye say this pray∣er: speke it not onely with your tongue / but of all your hole herte moste affectuously de∣syre that the prayse / glory and thanke of all goodnes that is or shall be wrought by you or any other creature be retourned all onely to hym the which is the begyn̄yng / the myd¦des & the ende of al thyng yt is worthy any prayse. And acustome to reherse this many tymes on the day / so oft as ye fele any ghost¦ly / or elles corporall / delectacyon of god / or of his creatures / that is to saye when soeuer ye be touched with inwarde deuocyon or
good thought: when ye cōsydre the graces of saynt{is} / when ye be delyted with the be wty of any creature / when your meate & drynke do content your appetyte / and so of al other thynges that pleaseth you. Alwaye synge¦th youre herte and many tymes speke with your mouthe. O beata triuitas. vts̄. But specyally se that ye in no wyse omytte this when ye be moued to vayngsory. And I thynke the contynuall exercyse of youre hrte in this one lesson / shall moch promote & encrease the grace & loue of god in you. ¶ But now retournyng to the mornynges exercyse when ye do on your clothes / se that your mynde be occupyed ī the prayse of god thankynge hym that he hath so plentuously puyded for you al necessaryes / many other moch better then ye / beyng ī nede / and pray hym to moue your herte: & the hertes of other to releue his poore people. And this ye shall dylygently remembre both at your fedynge and when ye go to your rest at nyght. FYrste when that ye be clothed be¦fore that ye departe out of your chambre saye this shorte prayer folowynge before some ymage of our lorde Ihesu cryste / fyrste
thankynge hym for your creacyon and re∣dēpcyon sayenge. ¶ Gratias tibi ago domine Ihesu criste qui me creasti¦redemisti et preordinasti ad hoc qd sum: tu scis quid de me facere vis / fac de me secūdum voluntatem tu∣am cum misericordia. Amen. Lorde Ihesu cryste that hast created me / he∣demed me / and prcordynat me to be that I am: thou knowest what thou wylt do with me / therfore make of me what soeuer thy wyll is after thy mercy. Amen. ¶ And when ye say this knowlege in your herte that ye are wel content with the estate and callynge that ye be in: desyrynge intyer¦ly with all youre herte to be obedyent to the ordynaunce of god what soeuer it pleaseth hym to make of you. ¶ Secunderly confesse yt al your lyfe past hath ben full of synne and moche vnkynd∣nes to warde your lorde god / promysynge vnfeyningly that ye wyl without any fur¦ther delaye / with the helpe of his grace this same daye begyn a newe lyfe / humbly as∣kynge mercye and remyssyon / sayenge. ¶ Dn̄e Ihesu criste ego cognosco
me grauiter peccasse / et libenter vo lo me emendare per gratiam tuam miserere mei propter amaram pas∣sionem tuam. Amen. O lorde Ihesu cryste I knowe that I haue greuously syn¦ned / and gladly I wyll amende me by thy grace: haue mercy on me for thy bytter passy¦on. ¶ And when ye saye thus / haue before your eyes some of your greatest offences yt moste may moue you to shame of your self and to contrycyon. ¶ Thyrdlye vtterly dysprayrynge of your selfe (thynkyng that ye are not in any wyse able or suffycyēt to ordre youre owne lyfe & to gyde your selfe in the waye of vertue) cō¦myt you fully to the prouydēce of god & say ¶ Domine Ihesu criste qui solus es sapientia patris / tu scis que mi∣chi peccatori expediunt, prout tibi placet / et sicut ī oculis tue maiesta∣tis videtur de me / ita fiat cum mi∣sericordia. Amen. O lorde Ihesu cryste that onely arte the wysdom of the father / thou knowest what thyng{is} are to me expe∣dyent / as it pleaseth the: & as it is seen in the
eyes of thy maiestie of me / so be it with mer¦cye. Amen. ¶ And when ye say thus: offre your selfe perpetually to be obedyent to all ghostly counceylles and mouynges of the holy ghoste / to the power of youre freyltye. Vnto the houre of dethe: sayenge in remem∣braunce therof. ¶ In manus tuas do¦mine. &c. Lorde in to thy handes I cōmen¦de my soule and bodye: hauynge a full pur∣pose to be wylful to dye: when soeuer it shal please our lorde to call you. ¶ After that ye haue thus done: ye shall gyue thankes to the trynyte (as ye before haue ben taughte) for thre speciall excellent{is} gyuen to our blessyd lady: sayenge thryes. Aue maria. Great¦ly desyryng to do some thynge before ye dye that may be pleasaunt to her. And then ha¦ue mynde of your good aungell and other saynt{is} to whom ye haue specyall deuocyon: namely those whiche shall be honoured in the churche that daye. And of this ye maye occupye your mynde in the waye to warde the churche / prepayrynge your herte to pray¦er / by the remembraunce of some parte of theyr lyfe. And when ye come to churche / se that ye do nothynge onely of custome / as it were a thyng that hath no reason or vnder
standynge. ¶ But in all thynge consydre the presence of your lorde god: hauyng hym cōtynually before the eye of your soule. and so behaue you in all thynges / that your ser∣uyce may be pleasynge to hym the which re¦quyreth of vs not onely our corporall exer∣cyse / but moche more the exercyse of our her∣te. And before ye departe out from the chur∣che forget not to thanke oure lorde with all your hert that he hath gyuen you grace that day to be present at his holy seruyce: and su∣che leysure that ye maye attende without worldly let your soules helthe: thynking yt many one in the worlde that be compelled of nede to applye theyr bodely labours▪ yf they myght haue suche seysure as ye haue to ensue the spyrytuall lyfe: shuld moche more profyte in vertue than ye do: and be perauē∣ture (not withstandynge all theyr besynes) moche more feruent in the loue of god. And then call to mynde howe many persones be¦set from the presence of the churche to prouy¦de for your nede / meate / drynke / and clothe: and hertely cōmende them al at the lest inge¦nerall to oure lorde and his sayntes. ¶ In departynge from the churche beware that ye fall not anone to ydle speche: but in
the waye consydre by ordre / howe ye haue ben occupyed in the churche / and what deuo¦cyon oure lorde hath gyuen you / and what good purpose ye haue ben moued to / and gy¦ue god and his sayntes thankes with a full desyre to folowe them. And lykewyse cōsy¦dre wherin ye haue be fawty and neclygēt / & be sory therfore with a purpose to be more ware from thensforth. And thus ye shal do after euery worke / before ye dyuerte to any other occupacyon. ¶ And when ye come ho¦me to your chambre / se yt ye demeane your self there lyke as at the churche: at all tymes consyderynge the presence of god / and his aungels. ¶ Fyrst at your entryng / on your knees salute our sauyour and his mother / & applye your self to some profytable occupa¦cyon / consyderynge in the begynnyng whe¦ther it be of necessytye or elles voluntary. Yf so be that it be of necessytye it maye not be omytted / But and yf it be of voluntarye then cōsydre whether there be any other thin¦ge of more necessytye and profyte that may be done at that same tyme or not / and say to your selfe woldest thou be thus occupyed yf thou shuldest dye this daye / and constrayne youre selfe with the fere of dethe to spende
your tyme at euery houre to the moste profy¦te of youre soule / offerynge your herte with your werke both at the begynnynge and at the endynge vnto our lorde. And before ye departe from your chambre / cōmyt your cu∣stodye and gouernaunce to our lorde and to your good aungell. ¶ Before your meate. PRepare your herte dylygent∣ly to com therto with cōpunc¦cyon / the which is the most ex¦cellent remedy agaynst al sē∣suall appetytes. And though there ben many meanes to induce compūc∣cyon / yet that notwithstandynge it shall be expedyent / that ye be determyned euery day to some inspecyal / wherfore I shal assygne to you lyke as ye desyred for euery daye in the weke one refeccyon of our lorde Ihesu / yt ye may be accustomed to fede with hym.These seuen ye shall fynde in vita christi se¦cundum bonauenturam: in the chapytres here intytled. ¶ On moneday the .xvii. chapytre .i. On tuesdaye the .xxii. chapytre .ii.
On wednesdaye the .xxiii. chapytre .iii. On thursdaye the .xxv. chapytre .iiii. On frydaye the .xxxix. chapytre .v. On saturdaye the .xxxiii. chapytre .vi. On sondaye the .lxii. chapytre .vii. ¶ These chapitres ye shal vse to rede eyther in part or hole as may be suffycyēt to styrre your herie to compūccyon. But yf ye wyll fynde shortly the fruyte of your redynge / se yt ye begyn with a great desyre to take pro∣fyte therof / & aske of our lorde helpe sayeng. ¶ Emitte domine sapiētiam tuam de sede magnitudinis tue vt mecū¦sit et mecum laboret / vt sciam quid acceptum sit coram te in omni tem¦pore. Amen. Good lorde sende oute thy wysdom from the seet of thy magnyfycēce that it maye be with me and laboure with me / so that I may knowe what is accepta¦ble afore the at all tymes. Then begyn to re¦de euery thynge reuerently / depely merkyn∣ge eche worde that ye rede / oft tymes askyn¦ge grace to profyte. ¶ And when ye shall make an ende / consy¦dre your doynge as I haue sayd before / and gyue god thankes for his helpe / and cōfesse
your owne neclygēce. And then gyue than∣kes also to our lord for the saynt that wrote those thynges for the profyte of your soule: & say ī the honour of hym one. Aue maria. And so cōmendynge your selfe vnto oure lorde / come to your meate with heuynes of herte that ye be cōpelled for the nede of your body (the which is your cōtynuall enemye) to leue the seruyce of youre moste beloued spouse. ¶ After this when ye haue sayd gra¦ce (intyerly desyryng our lord lo blysse you and all your cōpany / and his creatures that ye shall fede of) take youre place in ordre as besemeth / thynkynge youre selfe to vse the to wme of a seruaūt and not of a souetayne yf yt ye wyl folowe his example that sayd. Ego in medio vestrū sum sicut qui ministrat. I am amongest you as it we∣re a mynystre or a seruaunte. Beynge glad yf all other haue that thynge that cōtenteth them. And thynke that ye alone be vnwor¦thy the brede that ye do eate. And obserue at your meale these fyue thynges. ¶ Fyrste that ye fede not gredely withoute consyderacyon / but before euery tyme that ye shall take your meate: lyft your herte vn
to god thankynge hym that he hathe made that creature for your vse / and then consy∣dre whyther it be cōuenyent for the helth of your body: & then take of it moderatly seuin¦ge the beste for other that be more worthy. ¶ The seconde is that youre abstynence be as secrete as ye can / standynge rather in the brekynge of your appetytes / and forberyn∣ge of those meates that ye fele yourselfe mo¦che inclyned to desyre: than in any syngula∣rytie notable. ¶ The thyrde that you refuse nothynge yt is offred you / but with great deuocyon re∣ceyue it as sent of god / gyuynge thankes to hym therfore. And when ye haue taken par¦te of it / gyue the resydue as ye thynke beste / specyally for the norysshynge of charyte. ¶ The fourth / that in all that tyme ye stu∣dye to kepe in your herte the remembraunce of god at euery morsell that ye receyue / gy∣uynge thankes in herte to hym. And euery thynge that ye leue / offre it vnto hym / and your herte withall. ¶ The fyft / that ye do not forgette to praye for the pore people (lyke as ye dyd ī the mor∣nynge.) And when ye haue fedde suffycy∣ently / so that ye leue alway withe hungry
stomacke / beware then of ydle word{is}. But yf the cōuenyency of the company so requy¦reth / to fynde suche cōmunycacyō that may edyfye your selfe and the herers. ¶ When ye haue sayde grace / as shortly as ye may conuenyently / without any occasy∣on departe to your Chambre and recompte with your selfe howe you haue done as is before rehersed. ¶ Then be moche ware of ydlenes: and applye your selfe to some pro∣fytable exercyse. And yf any thynge wold occupye your mynde that before ye haue her¦de or seen: an one retourne in herte vnto our Lorde Ihesu / and tell hym all the mater / whatsoeuer it be. Yf ye be dyscontentyd ma¦ke your playnt vnto hym. Yf ye haue done amysse / confesse forth with to hym. Yf ye be in any doubte or perplexyte aske counceyll of hym. Yf ye be sycke o: dyseased let hym be your Physycyon. And generally at all ty∣mes haue hym syttynge in the myddyst of your herte / as your Iuge / your preest / your mayster and leche. ¶ When the after noone is passed in vertu∣ous ocupacyon / ordre your selfe in the ser∣uyce of god / before your supper and in the tyme tof syke as is before rehersyd. So
that ye endeuer your selfe alwaye to do bet∣ter the after noone than ye dyd the forenone And the seconde daye better than ye dyd the fyrste / and so forth to your lyues ende. But in all thynges beware that ye be not moche anxious or pensyfe / nor longe abydynge in any heuynesse / nor yet greatly labourynge for to wepe / though ye fynde your selfe mo∣che neclygent: and dayly fawty lytell or no¦thynge amendynge. For it is nother necessa¦ry nor profytable / but moche lette of profy∣te to them / that fynde in them selfe a good wyll / to serue god. But rather / anone as ye fynde and haue aspyed your defaute and cō¦fessyd it to our lorde / thāke hym of his great pacyence / that he hath with you / & by suche meanes rendreth you to the knowlege of your selfe / and therby vnto mekenes. And synge alwaye in your herte. O beata et gloriosa trinitas. As it is beforesayde. For it is moche better in all thynges to con∣sydre the goodnes of god: and to prayse hym therfore / than to consydre your owne euyll / and to mourne for it. And example moche notable for this / ye haue in vitis patrum / of two bretherne. ¶ Before nyght.
AT complyne tyme / call to mynde in ordre the benefites of our Lorde shewed to you that daye / and thanke hym for them. And cōtrary wyse your neclygence / and all your dedes / word{is} and thoughtes / makyng cōfessyon of them to our lorde. And those thyng{is} that be nota¦ble / wherof ye shuld be moste asshamed to shewe / Imprynt them in your mynde with purpose to confesse them to your ghostly fa¦ther / askynge grace that ye maye so do. ¶ Consydre also what sayntes inspecyall ye haue serued that daye / and what ye haue done to theyr honour / comptynge that daye in maner loste / that ye do not obteyne some frendshyp of the cytezens of heuen / where ye shall euermore dwell. ¶ And then temē∣bre what sayne{is} be the next day / with a de∣syre to honour them. ¶ After all this / when ye haue also prayed for the poore people / sy∣ke as ye dyd in the mornyng / cōmende your selfe vnto our lorde / our ladye / youre good aūgell / and all sayntes with the same pray¦ers / & in the same ordre as is before wryten. And the tyme that ye do of youre clothes / & tyll that slepe close youre senses / kepe youre
herte dylygently occupyed in remembrynge the goodnes of our Lorde to warde you: and specyally his gracyous prouydence and lon¦ge pacyence that he hath with you from day to daye. ¶ And then conceyue a great desyre and a feruent purpose to begynne the nexte daye tymely / to amende your lyfe. ¶ And yf ye contynewe this ordre and cease not / but perseuerantly enforse your selfe to kepe it to your lyues ende. I truste in goddes mercy by the prayers of his holy mo∣ther and all sayntes / ye shall en∣crease in good lyfe / and in the loue and fauoure of our lorde Ihesu. To whom be all prayse / ho∣noure / and glorye with out ende. Amen. ¶ Deo gratias. ¶ Imprynted by me Robert wyer / dwel∣lynge at the Sygne of saynt Iohan Euangelyst / in saynt Martyns parysshe / in the bysshop of Norwytche rentes besyde charyn∣ge Crosse.
