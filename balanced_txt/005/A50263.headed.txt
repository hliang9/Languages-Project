TO THE READER. FIrst, Learn this Book, together with a Testament of the newest Print, and then the Bible; and as hard words are come at, seek in this Book how they are divided, being they are set Alphabetically. Secondly, Those that desire to write words according to the English Tongue, hould often write over words as they find them printed in Books, minding to bserve to divide them into Sillables, which will imprint them in the Memo∣y) and so by use, which is the Mother f Language, (as the School-man saith) e may come to be so perfected in true lling, as may serve well enough for a
Shopkeeper or a Husbandman, without the Latine Tongue. Thirdly, Those that desire to learn to write without a Master, let them with a dry Pen, run over the writing Letters in this Book, learning to make (a) very well, and the (b) and the rest of the twenty four small Letters before they joyn them or make great Letters: Set the least all of a height; keep a Ruler and piece of Lead, to make Lines to write on, and a sharp Pen-knife, and let not the Ink be thick. Fourthly, Those that desire to live and walk in the true Religion, must above all outward Teachings, mind the Re∣proofs of the Spirit of Truth in their own Hearts against all Sin and Evil, other∣wise they will turn to the Right Hand, or to the Left into evil. Isa. 30.20, 21. Gen. 6.3. John 3.19. Fifthly, I have also added some ne∣cessary Questions wrought by Arithme∣tick, (which some want) notwithstand∣ing they may have learned several Rules
in Arithmetick, which I do believe will be acceptable to the Ingenious (and some Masons and Carpenters) that are lovers of Geometry and Mathematical Experi∣ments, though I have written but little thereof in this Book, endeavouring that it may be a small Volume. And it is more commendable for men to spend their leisure time in such harm∣less Studies than at idle sports and plaies, knowing that for every idle word we must give an account. Matth. 12.36. Lastly, Hoping that none will be of∣fended, that I have given such short hints of things: (according to my weak Un∣derstanding, yet intended for the good of those that cannot purchase large Books.) Yet do I believe that these things in this Book, will be kindly accepted by those that are not biassed with Self-interest (more than the Publick Good) for I seek no ho∣nour to my self herein, but the good of o∣thers (that are kept in Ignorance;) for to God all praise belongeth, who giveth true Wisdom to all those that ask it of
him in his fear, and they are most happy therein, that seek no Glory to themselves; for unto God alone it doth belong; for he is worthy to rule and reign in every heart and Conscience (by his Grace therein) now and for ever, Amen. I am a Lover Of all People, W. M. Remember Man, that the Reproofs of Christ For Sin i'th' Conscience, is the way That leads to Life Eternal, if obeyed, The everlasting blessed Day.

11 Inches in the length, makes a square Rod or Pole. The first Co∣lumn is the height in Feet. The second and third are the length in Feet and Inches.
To reduce Wall-Measure into Standard-Measure, which is a Rod of 16 ½ Foot square upon the superficies, and 14 Inches or a Brick and a half thick; Do thus: First measure how many Rods you have upon the side of the Wall (as be∣fore) and take that number, and mul∣tiply it by the number of the half Bricks that the Wall is in thickness, and that product divide always by 3, and the Quotient will shew how many Rods of Standard-Measure is in the Wall. If one Yard, Pound, Bushel, Load or Quart cost me so many pence, what will any number of Yards, Pounds, &c. cost me? Always multiply the number of Yards, &c. that you would buy, by the number of pence that one Yard, &c. will cost, and the product will shew
the number of pence that the whole will cost, the which divide by 12 to bring it into shillings, and the shillings by 20 to see the pounds in the Quo∣tient. Proof. If 112 pound cost 400 d, what will 1 l cost. That is 3 d and four seven parts of a penny.   20 12 4 l s d q 30 17 3 2 That is 30 pounds, 17 shillings, 3 pence, 2 farthings; and the figures a∣bove
shew that four farthings make a penny, 12 pennies make a shilling, and 20 shillings is a pound. By the same Rule read the figures that follow. Averdupoise Weight.

The figures above each Sum are also help, to cast up Sums both in Additi∣on and Substraction. For in Addition they shew what you are to dote at, or carry to the next row; as every 20 Grains must be car∣ried to the place of Scruples (as one) and the odd set down. And in substraction they shew what you are to borrow, if need be; so that af∣ter you have learned to the Rule of Di∣vision, you may understand all the Questions in this Book. How to measure Land, or any o∣ther thing, that lieth flat, as the figures following. A true Square multiply one side into itself. square Multiply the length by the breadth. rectangle
Add the length of each end together, and half of which multiply by the length. rhombus Multiply the doted Line into one side. rhombus Add the two short doted lines together, and multi∣ply it by half the longest. rhombus Multiply half the doted line by any side, if a Triangle. isosceles triangle Multiply half the doted line by the longest side. triangle Multiply the doted line by one third of the Com∣pass. circle If any of these be for measuring of Land (or any Close may be measured
into Triangles) and is measured by the Pole of 16 ½ Feet, divide the product by 160, and the Quotient shews the number of Acres. To know how much Hay a Barn will hold by the Load. Multiply the height to the Beam in∣to the breadth in yards, and that pro∣duct, by the Length, the whole divide by 20, and the Quotient sheweth the Loads of Corn or Hay the Barn will hold to the Beam. And for the Roof, multiply half the depth into the breadth at Beam, and that product by the length, and work as before, and add it to the other. How to find how many square Inches is on the outside of any Globe, or other round thing. Multiply the thickness or Diameter by the Compass or Circumference, and
the product sheweth the number of Inches. How to find how many solid Inches is in any Globe, or Bullet. Suppose the thickness or diameter be 21, multiply 21 by 21, and that pro∣duct by 21, the which multiply by 11 and the product will be 101871, which being divided by 21 gives 4851 the solid Inches in the Globe. A Globe of 10 Inches diameter, what is the circumference? A Globe of 31 3/7 Inches the Circum∣ference, what is the diameter?

A Workman will lay 1000 in a day. 4600 or 5000 Brick will make a Rod.
The value of a single Fraction. ½ is the half of any thing. ⅔ is two third parts. ¼ is one quarter. ¾ is three quarters. 1 is Nume∣rator. 2 is Deno∣minator. How to multiply a whole number, and a Fraction by a whole number and a Fraction, so that if you measure any thing, and the length and breadth are Poles, or Feet, with part of a Pole or Foot. Example. To multiply 120¼ by 58½. Do thus: First multiply the whole numbers to∣gether, as 120 by 48, and to the Pro∣duct add one quarter of 48, and the half of 120. Multiply ¼ by ½ is ⅛. Thus 1 time 1 is one, 2 times 4 is 8.
To Reduce a Fraction into its known parts. As ⅚ of a shilling, or 12 pence. Multiply the Numerator 5 into the parts of a shilling, that is 12 pence, and divide that product by the Nume∣rator 6. Example. How many square Quarters of a foot is in a solid foot of Timber?

Or take the nearest number and substract. Ten hundred thousand, or a thou∣sand thousand is a Million. To know when it is the middle of the day by the Sun. At twelve a clock cut a notch in a Window, by the shadow of a stansion or Door post. To reduce 5267 Poles into Acres, Roods, and Poles.
That is a r p 32 3 27 How to measure any parcel of Land small or great, by a Chain and the Rule of Multiplication, which may be very useful for the new planter in Ame∣rica, the way being in a pocket Book. Suppose the length of a piece of Land be 9 Chains and 50 Links, the Breadth 6 Chains, 25 Links. Note that the Chain is called Gun∣ter's Chain, being 4 Poles in length,
and is divided into 100 Links, and at every ten Links is a brass Ring, price five or six shillings. Multiply the Chains and Links as whole numbers, and from the product always cut off 5 figures next the Right hand, and those to the left hand are Acres.
  a. r. p.   That is 5 3 30 00000         100000 parts of a Pole. Secondly, The remaining Figures that is cut off from the 5 Acres, must be multiplied by 4, because so many Rood is in an Acre, and 5 figures cut off also from that Product, and the other are Roods. Lastly, Multiply the five figures, so cut off from the Roods by 40, because there is 40 Pole in a Rood, and then cut off five figures from the last product, and the Left hand figures are Poles, as in the Example appeareth. Note, that if in your Lengths or Breadths the Links are under 10, add a Cipher to the Left hand. How to reduce any number of Chains and Links into feet.
That is 351 Feet, 12 parts; 597 Feet, 30 parts. Always cut off 2 figures from the product, towards the Right hand, and they are parts of 100, and them on the Left are feet. That is 351 12/100 597 30/100 Note that if the number of Links be under 10, place a Cipher to the Left hand as before. To know how far it is to a Steeple or Tree, that you cannot measure to, by reason of water or wood, &c.
Choose two places to stand in to see the same, as suppose 20 yards distant, for which distance draw a Line on Pa∣per, and divide it into 20 parts, then lay the edge of a Quadrant at one standing, the Quadrant lying flat, to point to the other standing, and mark how many degrees the sight of the Tree may cut, to make an Angle, which mark at the end of the Line on the Pa∣per, do so at the other standing and bring it to the Paper: Lastly, draw both the Lines at length till they touch each other, and that will shew the distance in yards to be measures by your first Line. Note, that if the Tree be far distant, let your standings be the farther off each other. And for want of a Quadrant the square corner of a Board may serve, if it be exact square at one corner. If you are upon the Land, you may take the distance of a Ship at Sea, by two standings as before: But if you are
upon a Ship Mast at Sea, or upon a high Tower near the Sea, then spie through the sights the Ship, observing how ma∣ny Degrees and Minutes makes the An∣gle, which note upon Paper, and let down into the Sea a Line and Plummet the which Line measure into yards, and lay it down also on Paper, by the Line of equal parts. Note that the Angle at the water is a perfect square (as one should always be.) Then draw your Lines to a point as before, so that by this Rule the ingeni∣ous may find the distance of several Towns and Castles one from another, and also their heights and breadths, though you cannot come at them by reason of Water or an Enemy, &c. Note, that if the Plummet cut one one quarter of your Quadrant on the right side, in taking of sight, then twice the distance from your standing to the bottom of the Tree is the height. Or if it cut so much of the Left side then half the distance is the height. Re∣member
that the sight to the top of the Tree, must be as a streight Line to the Ground; it may reach 6, 7, or 8 foot backward, if you stand upright to take the sight. How to make black Ink. Take Rain water two Quarts, Galls bruised six ounces, let them stand one week in the Sun, then put in Gum A∣rabick and Coperas of each four ounces, heat it over the fire, and stir it with a stick often.
This Table is called multiplication Table, which all have learned by heart, that are skill'd in Arithmetick. 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18     3 9 12 15 18 21 24 27       4 16 20 24 28 32 36         5 25 30 35 40 45           6 36 42 48 54             7 49 56 63               8 64 72                 9 81 How to read this Table. Begin at the figure 2 in the second Line, and 2 in the first, and say 2 times 2 is four, 2 times 3 is 6, &c. Then begin at 3 in the third Line, saying 3 times 3 is 9, and 3 times 4 is 12, 3 times 5 is 15, and so to the end.
Multiply 20 by 5 Thus the Cipher in the 20 set down under the Line, then 2 times 5 is 10, set it down, so 5 times 20 is 100. Multiply 69 by 87, set it thus. Work thus: Say 7 times 9 is 63, set down 3 and carry in mind 6, then 7 times 6 is 42 and 6 I bear in mind is 48, set down
8 and bear in mind 4, which 4 set down, having no further to carry it. Then say 8 times 9 is 72, set down 2 under 8, and carry 7, and work as the other Line. Lastly, add up the two Lines, say∣ing 3, set it down, then 2 and 8 is 10, set down a Cipher and carry 1, then 1 that I carried and 5 is 6 and 4 is 10, set down a Cipher, and carry 1, say∣ing 1 and 5 is 6. 23 times 100 is 2300

Now to measure a Tree that standing, take the length of the Bo in Feet by a Pole, and in the midd girth it with a string, and the numb of Inches in the Girth find in the fi
Column of Co. or Compass, and the number against it multiply by the Feet of the length, and from the product ut off 3 figures to the right hand, and he other are feet. Example. Now by this Rule, a man with a Pole nd a string, and a short Ladder, may n a little time value a Wood, that he ay not sell any one Tree too dear, and et it down in a Wood-Book as follows.
A Wood-Book for the sale of Timber. First, Mark the Trees as you mea∣sure them with Stamps, as 1234567 89, &c. (made of Iron for the purpose) and enter them in a Book, with the year and day of the month, the owners name, and the Field or Wood where∣in they grow; this done, make a Co∣lumn, one for the number of Trees, se∣condly for their lengths, in the third their squares or number of Feet, and the last how sold, if you will. Having thus, by assistance, got al the chief into your book, you may sell them according to the marks, if you do but send the buyer to see them, whic may prevent many words, as is no too much used in bargaining in thes days. A Friendly Advice. If thou reads or hears any accusatio

Do so also be∣ore thou begins any new work or any promise; so shall God be thy Guide, &c. Of the unlawfulness of the Art of judicial Astrology, or Astro∣logical Predictions. Being a few words taken out of a Book written by J. R. who once was a Practitioner of Astrology, and Stu∣dent in the Magick Art. Saith in Page 33. Matth. 6.26.10.29. The very Hairs of your Heads are all numbred. So that a Sparrow cannot fall, nor a Hair of my Head perish without the good will and pleasure of my heavenly Father.
Wherefore we may plainly see, that God, the living God, doth govern all the World by his only Wisdom and Providence, so that we see here is no place for the secundarian Intelligences of the Astrologians, whereupon it is evi∣dently to be seen, that their secundari∣an Intelligences are only pernitious and superstitious Fables, whereby the Astro∣logers are deluded by the Devil, in that they Idolize the Stars, and are deceived in their Planetary Angels, who they think are the good Angels of God: But the Astrologers, and all other that think those seven Angels which the Astrolo∣gers call Planetary Angels, are good Angels, I say, if any man say, that the said Angels are good, I say that all such are deluded; for whosoever saith that evil is good, the same is deluded; but Astrologers do call evil good, in that they do affirm the Planetary Angels to be good Angels, the which said An∣gels are Devils, as I said afore: For be∣cause that no man can by Conjurations
cause the good Angels to appear in a visible Form at his will and pleasure: But some man can cause the Planetary Angels to appear in a visible form at his Will and pleasure, by Conjuration; therefore the Planetary Angels are not good Angels. Morover I say, that these seven Pla∣netary Angels of the Astrologers are the chief Agents for Conjurors, — are se∣ven Devils, which are also the Magi∣cians chief Agents in all Magical ope∣rations. In Page the 30. — For Mr. Lilly Critemini Avenazre saith, that the names of the Planetary Angels are (viz.) 1 Cassiel, 2 Zachariel, 3 Samael, 4 Michael, 5 Anael, 6 Raphael, 7 Gabriel. Again in 31 Page. These seven Angels are thus by the Astrologers ap∣propriate unto the seven Planets (that is to say) unto Saturn Cassiel, unto Ju∣piter Zachariel, unto Mars Samael, un∣to the Sun Michael, unto Venus Anael, unto Mercury Raphael, unto the Moon Gabriel.
Page 35. Now the Devil maketh out himself unto the Astrologers in a dark, hidden way, that the Astrolo∣gers cannot see him, although he work continually by him. Now then the way by which the Devil and the Astro∣logers do work together, is briefly thus, (viz.) That the Astrologers superstiti∣ous regarding of times, and their erect∣ing of a Figure with their observing the Position of the Stars in the said Fi∣gure, to this end, that so they might know the event of particular things; I say, that this regarding of time, and erecting of a Figure, with the observ∣ing of the Stars therein, to the end a∣foresaid, I say it is nothing else but vain Ceremonies, whereby the Planeta∣ry Angels do come to understand and know what it is the Astrologer would foretel, or what the thing is, of which the Astrologer would predict and fore∣tel the event thereof. So then the Astro∣loger's Figure being thus erected, he doth from thence conjecture what shall
be the event of the thing, for which the Figure was erected. Now the Astro∣loger having thus delivered his Oracle, from thenceforth the Planetary Angels do all that they are able (God permit∣ting them) to bring to pass that which the Astrologer did foretel. Now why the Devil doth all this, it is to this end, that so he may uphold and maintain his Kingdom of Darkness. And Page 7. — The practice of it is unlawful, as it is to be seen in Deut. 18.12, 14. Isa. 47.13, 14 Let now the Astrolo∣geas, the Star-gazers, the monthly Prog∣nosticators stand up and save thee from these things which shall come upon thee. Behold, they shall be as Stubble, the Fire shall burn them, they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the Flame, &c. Again the practice and Practitioners thereof are condemned. Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the Heaven, and be not dismaid
at the signs of Heaven; for the Heathen are dismaid at them, Jer. 10.2. Astrology is a vain and foolish Art, because, that the regarding of time, without which Astrology cannot be practised, is by, and in the Scripture condemned for an Abomination, as it doth appear in the 18 of Deut. and the 14 ver. which saith thus, For these Na∣tions which thou shalt possess, hearkned unto Observers of times, and unto Divi∣ners: But as for thee, the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do. And as you may see in the 12 verse in the same Chapter, these words, (viz.) For all that do these things are an Abomina∣tion unto the Lord: and because of these Abominations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee. Where∣fore my beloved Country-men, aban∣don these your Astrological follies, which if you do not do, I proclaim from the Lord God, that Destruction shall come upon you, which you shall not foresee by all your Art of Astrolo∣gy;
and when it is upon you, then shall you behold your selves in misery, but shall not be able to help your selves by all your Babilonish skill, &c. And Page 34. I could have here set forth unto thy view the Magicians Figures, Circles, and how these 7 Planetary Angels are to be called upon, and the whole Body of Magick. And that the Planetary Angels will say unto the Magician, Pete quid vis, &c. And resolve doubts: I could declare much of this Art, but shall forbear; for I am appointed to de∣stroy it. And Page 3. G Carleton Bishop of Chichester, saith, (viz.) The first Invention of Astrology is by many learned men attributed to the De∣vil; with whom agree the sayings of many antient Writers, as Tertullian, Clement, Alexandrinus and Lactantius, with others who shall be mentioned in their proper places, (but for brevity sake, I shall only mention Augustin,) who saith,
It is a great madness and folly to go a∣bout to tell by the Stars, the manners, actions, and events of men, which, saith he, true Christian Piety expelleth and condemneth. Vid. St. Aug. Lib. de Doc. Chr. Aug. Lib. de nat. Doemon. Now I shall conclude in the Author's own words, pag 36. Thus Reader, I will here make an end, and if thou hast any thing to say against me, be∣cause I have denied Astrology to be a lawful Art, thou knowest where I have my abiding place: J. R. Of the Burrough of Chippingwickham in the County of Buckingham.
From Maryland in America, March 20. 1681. THe dreadful Comet that appeared here, (without doubt) portends sad News to all the Northern Hemi∣sphere, that appeared here in Novem∣ber and December last, &c. and I shall be glad to hear what our English Astro∣logers say of it; as matters are repre∣sented to us here from England, old sores seem now to bleed afresh, &c. I have no mind to see with my own Eyes, whether there be any difference be∣tween 41 and 81, &c. This I took out of the Loyal Protestant Intelligence (so called) of July 16. 1681. That would make as if the Nonconformist Protestants were now of the same Spi∣rit, that was in 41, by the deceit of Astrology, when the Comet is only a warning to all People upon Earth, that are workers of Iniquity, speedily
to depart from it, else the Rod of God's Judgment will come upon them. And a Plough-man can give as true a Judg∣ment of the Effects of a Comet, as an A∣strologer; yet Princes and People may be deceived by Astrological Judgment, and too many are. But as for Astro∣nomy, or the knowledge of the Stars motions, it may be no Snare to a Christi∣an, if God is in all his thoughts. Psal. 10.4. 2 Cor. 10.5.

If 423 l. be con∣tinued at Interest 6 years, after the rate of 6 l. per 100 l. for a year Interest upon Interest, the Question is, what Principal and Inter∣est is to be received at the expiration of the said tearm? Multiply 423 by the number a∣gainst 6 years, and from the product cut off seven Fi∣gures.
Example. The Principal and Interest comes to l. s. d. q. 600 0 8 3 A Table of Annuity, or for∣bearance of Money. 1 10600000 2 5454369 3 3741098 4 2885915 5 2373964 6 2033626

Interest for his Money. Multiply the number against 27, and from the Pro∣duct cut off seven fi∣gures to the Right hand, and the other are pounds. Example. The enclosed 8 in the first Product, is 8 prims, that is 16 s.
Here I find, that 1200 l. will pur∣chase an Annuity of 90 l. 16 s. 8 d. for 27 years. do so with others. Again. A Merchant being indebted 1600 l. present pay, the Creditor is contented to receive the same at 10 equal pay∣ments, the debter allowing for the for∣bearance after the rate of 6 l. per annum Interest upon Interest; the question is, what those yearly payments ought to be? Multiply the number against 10 in the last Table by 1600 the pounds, and work as before. Note that Pro∣duct is multiplied by 240 the pence in one pound.
Example. Answer. Every payment ought to be 217 l. 7 s. 9 d. the inclosed 3 is 6 shillings.

Suppose a Lease to continue 10 years, and you would know how many years purchase it is worth in ready Mo∣ney. Look in the Table for 10 years of a Lease to the Left hand, and against the same you have 7 years Rent, and
4 Months rent, and 3 parts of a Months rent of the said Lease (Let the rent be what it will) viz. 7 years is 70 l. and the 4 Months is 3 l. 6 s. 8 d. and 3/10 of a month is about 30 s. so added together is about 73 l. 8 s. 8 d. ready Money of a Lease of 10 l. a year. Again. Suppose a Lease to be 30 years that you would buy, (let the Rent, as aforesaid, he what it will.) Look for 30 in the first Column, and a∣gainst it is 13 years, 9 months, and 1/10 of a month purchase, or the Rent present possession.
But suppose there be a Lease of 5 years (more or less) before you com∣mence look in the Table against 5 years, and you find 4 years, 2 months 5/10 purchase, substract this out of the Sum against 30 viz. 13 9 2. Example.   y. m. p. Years 30 13 9 2 Years 5 4 2 5   9 6 7 And so much is the Reversion after 5 years —purchase worth the remainder of 30 years.

First, Draw it upon Paper, as be∣fore. Secondly, Write the 12 Months in a long piece of Paper, every Month in the same compass as March is writ in, in the Almanack, and cut between each double Line to slip it through, that but one Month may be seen at a time. Thirdly, Upon a long piece of Pa∣per write the days of the week twice over at length to slip as the other. Lastly, Do so also for the year 1681, 1682, &c. and for the Kings Reign. And at the bottom write the Expla¦nation thus: Explanation. If the day of the Month begins on a Thursday, the next Thursday after is 8, the next is 15, the next 22, &c. The Friday is the 2d day of the month, the next Friday is the ninth, &c. Or you may place them according as
the Months and days are in the Scrip∣ture, as the first Month (or March so called) second Month, &c and first day of the week, or Sunday so called. Example.

The Use of this Table. Cut marks in a Staff, for 10 parts, and when the Sun shines set it upright on the Ground, and measure the Sha∣dow into parts, and find them in the Table, and the Figure above it at the top of the Table, tells you the hour of the day. Deafness. THe most common cause of Deaf∣ness in the Ears, comes of stop-age of Wax and Dust in the Ears, that hardeneth against the Drum; therefore pick them not, but have them well washed with a Syringe (with warm Beer and Water) at going to bed, which I have proved, by helping above one hundred people, I do believe. It's good to drop into the Ear a night or two be∣fore
they are cleansed, a little Oil of bitter Almonds, or the Fat of a silver Eel, so called, if these do not cure, try no further. Urine, The signs thereof. 1. Red Urine signifieth heat of the Blood. 2. White, rawness and indigestion in the Stomach. 3. Thick, like puddle, excessive la∣bour or sickness. 4. White or red gravel in the bot∣tom threatens the Stone in the Reins. 5. Black or green, commonly death. Scurvy, The signs thereof, Is through a Melancholy humour; which makes the Gums swell and exul∣cerated, loosening also the sinews and Teeth, the mouth stinketh, the Thighs and Legs are often full of blew spots like bruises, the colour pale, the feet
are swollen as in a Dropsie, and a pain in the soles of them,, and so will the fingers ends sometimes. Dropsie, The signs thereof. There are three sorts through the coldness of the Liver. 1. The watery Dropsie, the Body is full of phlegmy blood, or oak Water between the skin and the Flesh, and the Body doth suck it up as a Spunge sucks up Water; an ill colour of the face. 2. Is wind and water, lying between the Guts and the Stomach, the Body waxes lean. 3. If more wind than water, it's a Timpany. A good Diet Drink for all that are inclining to the Scurvey, or Dropsie, or others, to be taken in the Spring and Fall. Take Fumitory, green or dried, red
Dock Roots, water Cresses, and com∣mon Scurvy grass, of each one handful, Fennel Seed one Ounce, and half a peck of Pippins sliced, boil all these half an hour in 10 Gallons of Water, strain it, and add to the Water of Horseradish one handful sliced and bruis∣ed; Liquorish one ounce, Rasons in the Sun half a pound, then boil them half an hour in the said water, and put in half a pound of Munks Rubarb sli∣ced, Sea Scurvy grass half a Peck, Se∣na two ounces, and one pound of Su∣gar, and boil it a little, (the said wa∣ter being the wort of one peck and an half of Malt) work it with yest as o∣ther drink, and drink every morning about half a pint. A Drink that hath cured wounds and Sores, when many other Medicines could not. Take Bugloss, Self heal, Yarrow, Sanicle, Ox Eye, the three sorts of
Plantane, red Briar Leaves, mix the juice with white wine, and take five spoonfuls three times a day, and only wash the Sore with it, or get the ver∣tue of the hearbs by boiling. To provoke Urine.

Convulsion and Mother-fits. Take one quart of Spring water, and half a handful of Savin, and one hand∣ful
of purple coloured Hartsease, bruis∣ed, steep them in the water two hours, strain it, and sweeten it with Hony, take every morning half a pint for a man or Woman; and every night take as much as will lie on a shilling of this powder, that is, single peony roots, and the best poudered Sugar. Pain in the Side. Anoint it well with Melilot Oint∣ment or Salve, and lay on a Tobacco Leaf, and at night take one of Mat∣thew's Pills, with the decoction of Field Thyme. For a Cancer in a Womans Breast. Take 4 ounces of Lapis Calamina∣ris, being red hot, quench it in one pint of White Wine; quench it so three times, then take two ounces of Lapis Tuty, and quench it twice in red Rose water, beat them small, and put them
both in a glass to the Wine, when you use it, shake the bottle always, and wet double Cloaths therein twice or thrice in a day, and apply to the Breast. Fundament sore or pained.

Sirups; How to make and keep them. Sirups made of Flowers, is made by the often steeping of Flowers in water, covered by the Fire, the water being boiled before, by itself, when it is strong enough of the Flowers strain it, and to every pint add two pound of Sugar, set it over the Fire but not boil it, and scum it well; and to make the Sirup of any hearbs, you must boil out their vertue in water, and let it run of itself through a woollen cloath, with the weight in Sugar, boil it to a Sirup, Scum it of∣ten, cover the Bottles only with paper, both Sirups and distilled Waters.

Melancholly by Hellebore white and black. Take none of these violent pur∣ges alone, without a right Composition among others to correct them.
Purging, the manner and way thereof. 1. If the humours be to be drawn from remote parts of the Body, as the Head, Arms, Feet, or the like, let the Purges be made up in a hard form, as Pills are; for by that means it stays the longer in the Body, and is in all rea∣son therefore the better able to perform its Office. 2. If the afflicting humour lie in the Bowels, or near to those parts, use li∣quid Medicines, for they operate spee∣diest, and the Bowels are soon hurt by purging Medicines; if the matter be tough and of long continuance, it is impossible to carry it away all at once; therefore take gentle Purges, and take them often; for strong Purges weaken Nature. A good Purge. Take Rubarb and Senna, of each ʒi,
Jallap ℈i, Cream of Tartar and Ana∣seed of each 16 grains, Ginger 10 Grains, all in pouder, let them steep in a draught of white Wine or water all night, in the morning drink the Li∣quor, and keep house, and take posset drink as in other Purges; it is very safe for many distempers, (taken as of∣ten as need shall require) this quantity is enough for a man or Woman.

Of Mans Eye. The Muscles of a mans Eye are six, which gives the motion with the Op∣tick Nerves ascending to the brain. In the Eye there are three humours, as 1. Watry, 2. Glassy, 3. Christal∣line. First, The Christalline humour is the sight, in the middle of a pretty hard substance. Second, The Glassy humour is seen behind, like melten Glass, softer than the Chrystalline, and is five times big∣ger, and twice as big as the Watry humour, it nourisheth the Christalline. Third, The Watry humour is be∣hind the last, and thin; for it is some∣times consumed in Diseases, and lost with wounds in the Eye. The Christal∣line is nourished of the most lightful part of Seed.
The Hairs of the Eye-lid being lost, the Party cannot see things afar off. Those whose Ears stand out hear the best, and some are dull of hearing, by lying hard upon their Ears, and al∣so by Nurses binding them. A tickling noise in the Ears, de∣notes a thin humour. A stiff humour often hindereth the hearing, then they want cleansing with a Syringe, the way you may find in this Book. To break an Impostume in the Ear. Tie a thread to a piece of an Onion, and prick it full of holes when it is broke, cleanse it with Basilicon, with Lint. For a blew or gray Web in the Eye. Take Thunderbolt Stone one part, and as much Ginger, and half as much as one of these of Allum, and a little Loaf Sugar.
For a white Web put in Salt, for a Horse put to it Turmerack, and make it like Salve, with butter, and put in a Pill twice a day into the end of his Eye, or when his Eyes are thick with humours. For the Pearl or Web in the Eye. Take the juice or the distilled water of the hearbs, Mouse-ear and half Moon Grass, it may be made milder with Eye bright water or Sugar, drop into the Eye a little twice a day, for two Months if need be. Another. Take the Juice of Celandine, Ground Ivy, and field Dasy, or let these be di∣stilled in May, &c. After the smart is over, the Eye be∣ing drest with Pouders, wash them with Eye bright water mixt with snow water.
But if you cannot get these waters, then boil the juice of Houseleek in an Egg shell with the white. Eyes that are clogged with humours or filthy flesh. Put into them three Lice, and lay on a Plaister of the white of an Egg, beaten with Honey, upon Flax, all night. Or every night put in a Seed or two of wild Clary, and lay to the wrests Plaisters of Burgundy Pitch, and also to back of the Neck and Temple patches of the same, and read in no book quickly after Meat; Sunshine, the heat of Fire or smoak not good for weak Eyes, except the Smoak of To∣bacco. Stifness of the Eye-lids. Anoint them at night with Deer Suet.
Bloodshot Eyes, and black bruises. Boil Hysop and Wormwood toge∣ther, and lay it on, or bruise them to∣gether. Eye-Salve, or Ointment of Tutty. It cools and dries up salt and hot hu∣mours, that flow into the Eys from the heat of the brain, the Eye lids only be∣ing anointed at nights. Is thus made. Take Tutty prepared 2 ounces, La∣pis Calaminaris 1 ounce, being in fine powder, make it up with 1 pound and an half of the Ointment of Roses. Now to prepare the Lapis Calami∣naris, quench it six times in Plantane or Rose water, with this water wash the Tutty, and let the Durt run through a Cloath, and make each into Balls for use.
And to make the Ointment of Roses, take fresh Hogs Grease cleansed one l. fresh red Roses Buds half a pound, juice of the same three-ounces, on a gen∣tle fire make it into an Ointment. If Dimness of Sight come from the brain, Take a spoonful of blew Sows, cal∣led Wood-lice, wash them and stamp them, and let them lie all night in Ale, strain it, and drink the Ale in the morn∣ing, take the same quantity till thou art well. Physick for the Poor. Or an universal Medicine to be ta∣ken about the quantity of a Pease in a Pill or Powder, drinking a draught of strong drink after it at going to Bed, for one man or Woman, but less for Children. It purges by Sweat and U∣rine,
causes ease in sleep and sickness; it cures Agues, by getting into a sweat by one of them half an hour before the fit is expected to come. I need not write but little of it's Commendation, it being so well known by the name of Matthews his Pill, which, if rightly prepared, is an excellent thing. I had it from one of my Uncles who was a Chymist, who said he had it of a Ser∣vant of the said Matthews, and there∣fore I commend it to all who are able, and well inclined, to do their poor Neighbours good when in sickness, and may dwell far from an honest Phy∣sician. Take of the best white Tartar (or Lees of Wine) and Salt-Peter, of each one pound, make them together into fine pouder, and put them in a well glassed pot, that's upon hot Coals, stir them in the pot with a red hot Iron, un∣til they have done flaming, let it cool by degrees, and take it out and beat it
into fine pouder, and put it into a wide mouth Glass, with one pint of the best oil of Turpentine, stir it in the Glass once or twice a day pretty much, for two or three weeks, the longer the bet∣ter, and set it in a Seller, to moisten the Pill when need is. Then take of Corn poppy heads be∣fore they open, (but white Garden Pop∣py is the best) a good quantity, beat them, and strain the juice into a well glassed Platter, and let it stand in the Sun till it is as hard as wax. Take of this, and Juniper berries, and Liquo∣rish, of each one ounce, and black Hel∣lebore and Saffron a quarter of an ounce, (but instead of Poppy juice, you may take as much Opium) make these into as fine pouder as you can, and in a Mor∣tar, with the aforesaid mixture, work them like Dough for Bread, then knead it hard into a wide mouth Glass and cover it with a Bladder, and it will keep many years.
Here may be Doses for about one thousand times, for little more than two shillings charge, which an able and charitable Neighbour will not grudge to have in store at all times for them∣selves and the Poor near them. But if you are willing to make it of very great vertue, then add to it of the best Chymical oil of Juniper Berries, and of Sulphur, of Antimony, of each one ounce, which may cost, if rightly prepared, about ten shillings. I have made this Pill about twenty years. Put a little of this Pill into an ach∣ing Tooth. A Purge for a Country-man, Take Grunsel, Mallow, the hearb Mercury, Endive and Succory, and Red dock Roots, of each about a quar∣ter of a handful, Fennel seed a little spoonful, and a little Ginger, boil them in almost a quart of water to a little less
than a pint, strain it, and sweeten the Liquor, and drink it fasting, and now and then drink Posset drink. For Childrens sore Feet, that the skin is off with Chilblains. If the Feet itch much with Chills and is hot; the best is to hold them to a Fire, very hot, a quarter of an hour at a time, which allays the itching, and keeps them from breaking; but if they are broke, and be as sore as can be, one Plaister of Burgundy Pitch cureth, if it do but stick, and it is very safe, lay it on in the morning. A Balsom to cure Burnings and Scald∣ings, Head-ach, the Temples and Nostrils anointed, biting of a mad Dog; use nothing else in Wounds, Stitches and Pains in the Sides being rubb'd in and apply a Tobac∣co Leaf; for inward bruises, or Ulcers in the Bladder or Kidneys, taken like Pills night and morning, &c.
It is made as followeth. Take Venice Turpentine washed in Rose water, one pound, oil Olive three pound, yellow Wax one pound, then cut the wax, and melt it on the Fire, and put in the Turpentine, Oil, and six spoonfuls of Sack, stir them till they begin to boil, and take it off the Fire, and when it is cold, melt it again (the Sack being from it) and put to it one ounce of Natural Balsom, price four or five shillings, Oil of St. John's wort, and red Sanders in fine pouder, of each one ounce, give it a boil, and take it from the Fire, and stir it till its cold almost. Note, that the hotter you make this Balsom, when you apply it to wounds, Burns, Inflamations, Ulcers, or Fistu∣la's, the better it is.
Another. Anoint with Linseed Oil, ground with white Lead, or Cerus, which is also good for the chops and sores on Cows Teets, or others. Bleeding at the Nose, &c. Let the party sit upright, and stuff into the Nose Rabbets wool, which hath been rouled in fine Bole-armony and Dragons Blood, and sprinkle cold water in his Face, and a cloth wet in Vinegar to the Forehead. Bleeding at the Nose in the beginning of a Disease is a bad sign. Directions for Health. 1. Keep from evil Company. 2. Virtue lengthens Life, Vice short∣neth.
3. Use moderate Labour of Body. 4. Keep thy Feet dry, except used to do it. 5. In morning wash Face, Ears, Teeth and Hands. 6.

Sanguine, heat and moisture Over∣come. Cholerick, heat and driness Over∣come. Phlegmatick, cold & moisture Over∣come. Melancholy, cold & driness Over∣come. If none of these four overcome, then the Body is in health. Philosopher's Stone, so called, some∣thing thereof. Hermes, Plato, Aristotle, and other Philosophers, in former times, flourish∣ing
the original Spring of Sciences, and the Inventors of Liberal Arts (so called) earnestly approving the vertues of things under the Heavens, did enquire with great desire, if any thing was a∣mongst the Creatures, that might save Man's Body from all Corruption, and preserve it alive for ever. In which search (in vain) they wea∣ried themselves, (by seeking that in the Creature which is only in the Creator) calling it a Stone, or Medicine extract∣ed, or to be by them created out of E∣lementary things, that shall have power of itself, to change melted Lead into fine Gold, and also to cure all dis∣eases in Man or Woman; and having not found such a thing, yet have found many Secrets of Alchymy, as the Oils and Salts of Animals, Vegetables and Minerals, &c. But their pretending to transmute or change the filing of Tin, which they call Jupiter, into Silver, called Luna, and part of Coper called Venus, into Gold, called by them Sol,
put in Lime 24 hours in a flame, which only makes them the more malleable or harder, though there is some Gold and Silver both in Tin and Lead, of which some, it's to be feared, makes course Silver of; and having not found such a thing (as I said before) and being asha∣med in themselves, (having spent so many years in toiling, cost, and study in seeking) will not say they cannot, or have not found it; but have still led others in the dark to search by their writings, as if they had known, or did possess such a Stone, or secret, and that it would lose its vertue, if they make it known to others. For Saith Morien, Who hath it (that is this Stone) possesseth all things, and shall need the help of no body in any thing, because in it is all temporal Fe∣licity, corporal Health, and earthly prosperity. And further the Philoso∣phers saith, that by this Stone or Spi∣rit Moses made the Vessels of the Tem∣ple, and the Tabernacle; Noah built
the Ark; Esdras recovered the Law; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob obtain∣ed length of days and abundance of Riches, &c. This many do seek, (say they) but few do find it; for the defiled with vices or polluted are unworthy to know such things: Therefore it is not shewn but to the devout, because it is incom∣parable to all prices, &c. O how the Gentiles hearts have been darkned, and become vain in their ima∣ginations! Rom. 1.21. (as at this day) to think to find that healing vertue in the Life or vertue of earthly things; that's only in God's Spirit, Mal. 4.2. Jer. 30.17. For, saith the Lord, if thou wilt dili∣gently hearken, O Israel, unto the voice of the Lord thy God, &c. Then will I put none of these diseases upon thee, which I brought upon the Egyptians, &c. (not∣withstanding the Astrologers say, that the Planets cause Diseases either by Sympathy or Antipathy, as Mars caus∣eth
diseases in the head, &c. Venus de∣forms the Beauty of the Face by Anti∣pathy to Mars, &c. Isa. 3.24.) Both Riches and Honour come of the Lord. 1 Chron. 29. Psal. 103.3. For by Faith Noah being warned of God.— prepared the Ark, by Faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come, Heb. 11. Unto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure. Tit. 1.15. So that it was by Faith in God, that Noah, Moses, Isaac, and Jacob, and all other the Righteous walked, (but not by Philosophy, or Astrology, or any other created thing;) not like the Gentiles and Astrologers, who are be∣come vain in their Imaginations, Rom. 1.21. and Observers of times, for which Sin the Lord drove out the Ca∣naanites out of their Land. Deut. 18.12, 14. Lev. 19.26. Therefore what man of sense will be∣lieve, that all the Art of earthly men,
can procure one thing out of earthly things, that may be but as the quantity of a pease, that shall have power (being put into a pound or two of melted Lead) to change it into most fine Gold, or that this one thing shall have also power, as an outward Medicine, to cure all dis∣eases in the Bodies of the wicked, that they may get strength to be wicked still. But most happy is he, that above all searching, he seeketh after, and waiteth upon God, that he may give unto him that white Stone, and in it a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth, Rev. 2.17. Now before I conclude, I shall recite some of the words of two of these Philosophical Writers, as Geber and Villa Nova. Saith Geber, For wheresoever we have spoken plainly, there we have said no∣thing, but where under Riddles and Fi∣gures we have put something, there we have hid the Truth. Villa Nova saith, The Alchymists of
latter time, are for the most part mock∣ers, and whiles by Sophistications, they seek rather to seem wise than to be, they deceive the yielders to them; but the an∣cients not profiting according to their own Covetousness, have wrapped up this Art in Riddles, shewing rather their own Ig∣norance than Science, &c. Eph. 5.11. And have no fellowship (saith the Apostle) with the unfruitful works of darkness; but rather reprove them, Eph. 4.17, 18. Yet the word Philosophy has signi∣fied a love to Wisdom, and the way to holy Living, and not vain and impracti∣cable things. See Pythagoras his works; and the Speech of Palamedes at his Ex∣ecution, manifesteth, that some of them sought after Righteousness: For, saith he, I never hurt or injured any, but on the contrary, have advantaged all that conversed with me, to my utmost ability, communicating what good I could gratis, and not for gain. O that all, called Christians, was but
come so far into a righteous Life, as this Palamedes! (who was called a Heathen, as his Speech declareth,) then would England be happy, and all o∣ther Nations. Note, that if William Lilly, and the rest of the Astrologers, do not stu∣dy to be acquainted with the seven Pla∣netary Angels of the Magicians, why did he write thus? viz. For though Philosophy and Philosophers teach us, that Comets have a matter, or Ethereal Sub∣stance, of which they are created, yet those learned men, wanting Angelical conversation, are deceived. Above all things (saith he) let the Artist rather judge by the strength of his reason, guided by Art, upon the Confi∣gurations of the Planets, than by ill di∣gested Aphorisms, &c. Nor are the secundian Intelligences, viz. what Angel then governs, to be omitted in Consideration for the judging of future Events, &c. There is in the Art of Astrology,
saith e, (which some ignorant persons are pleased to villifie.) Arcanum quod∣dam equivalent, To prophesie, &c. Woe to the rebellious Children, saith the Lord, that take Counsel, but not of me, and that cover with a covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin, Isa. 30.1.9.6. Josh. 9.14. But the most sure word of Prophecy is by Astrologers neglected. 2 Pet. 1.19. Many also of them which used curious Arts, brought their Books together, and burned them before all men; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of Silver; so mighti∣ly grew the World of God, and prevailed, Act. 19.19.20. A Rule for a Baker. When the Bushel of Wheat is worth 3 s 4. the peny wheaten Loaf weigh∣ing 20 ounces, what shall the peny Loaf weigh when Wheat is 5 s. the Bushel.
How much Cloath of 3 Quarters broad, will serve to line 9 Yards of 7 Quarters broad.
Of the right placing of points in Writing. Comma , Semicolon ; Colon : Period . Interrogation ? Admiration ! Continuation - Perenthesis ( ) A Comma is the most frequent point, and of least force, it is to be set when the least stop of the voice is; as, But when the Husbandmen saw the Son, they said among themselves, this is the Heir, come, let us kill him, &c. When there is a stop somewhat big∣ger, set (;) or (:) as, They that would destroy me, being mine Enemies wrong∣fully, are mighty: Then I restored, &c. When the sense, and sentence is per∣fected and full, then write (.) as, Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks. Quench not the Spirit.
After a Question asked, set this (?) as, Whose Ass have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? After a wondring, admiring, or cry∣ing out, set this point (!) as, O wretch∣ed man that I am! O death where is thy sting! When you must divide a word at the end of a Line, and with a part of it begin the next Line; then at the end of the Line, where the first part of it is, you are to set down this point (-) or when (by way of Elegancy) two or more words are put in one, as, Self-love. A Perenthesis is (.) when some words may be left out, and yet the sentence perfect, as, I know that in me, (that is in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing.
Of the Globe of the Earth, the Pole-Stars, and some hints of Dialling. THe Globe of the Earth on which we dwell, is supposed to be 2 third parts water or Sea, and the other third part Land, and two third part inha∣bited. Seeing the Earth and Water is co∣pared to a Globe, or as a round Ball, being in the Air by the wonderful work of God. That it so remaineth, held up by Gods hand, only appeareth by what follows, that is to say. There is two fixed Stars, called the two Poles of the World; the North Pole, and the South Pole, opposite one to the other, the Earth being in the middle, or betwixt them, and a Line supposed to be held from the one to the other Star▪
The Sun, Moon and Stars moves round them, and the Earth continually. The Sun giving Light to one place of the Earth at all timesThe People in New England, and New Jersey are ri∣sing out of Bed when we in Eng∣land are at Dinner; so that we differ six hours in time, the Sun making the day, &c. for mans outward sight to guide him in outward things, and to refresh the Earth, (as the Son of Righte∣ousness, Christ Jesus, causeth his Spiritual Light to shine in the hearts of all men, to light them out of Darkness or Sin, Joh. 1.9. Luk. 1.78.) So that all earthly things presseth to this Earth upon every part thereof to the middle or Center, from whence they sprung. Now to make it more plainly to ap∣pear. Suppose, I draw a crooked line to represent some part of the Earth upon which we dwell, in England, and ex∣tend a doted Line to see which of the
two Stars or Poles is above our dwel∣ling, or Horizon, so called. Now he that travels 60 miles North∣wards, the North Star will be a degree higher; or Southwards the contrary; but altereth not to go Eastward, or Westward directly; (and 360 of these degrees is round the Earth, or Globe, as is supposed.) This North Pole is elevated above our dwelling about 52 degrees 30 Mi∣nutes.
Therefore a man may travel until the South Pole seem to be over his head. So being these two Stars are as fixed, they are of great help to those that go over the Sea; together with the help of a needle, placed in the Sea-man's Compass, which needle turning upon a point, will not be still, until it points at one end to the Iron-Mines in the North, because of its being touched by a Load-stone, that draws always towards the North, and the place to which they are travelling to, if it bears South, or S.S.W. the Compass will shew.
The height of the Pole in degrees and Minutes are taken by a Quadrant like this Figure following, on which, Lines may be drawn to find the hour of the day. quadrant
I have only placed the 12 hours' and by this Table following you may place the rest. A Table for the Latitude of 52 De∣grees for the Quadrant. Hours. D. M. D.

A for April, betwixt these two or any two Months, that the time is when you would know the hour of the day, as suppose it is the 15th of March, set the Head at the 25th, because the Month you must suppose to begin on the 10th of each Month, then let the Sun shine through the sights, and the Bead will shew the hour of the day. In Sun Dials, the Stile, or straight wire, that shaddows every hour Line, should point directly to each of these two Stars (like as the doted Line) which if you can so place upon any flat or up∣right thing, you may with ease draw the hour Lines by the shadow thereof at length, by another Sun Dial rightly placed, when the Sun shines at any time of the year, or by a Clock, if it goes right that day as you draw the Lines; Or do thus, to place a Stile up∣on and upright Wall, that is South∣ward.
Just at 12 a Clock, set one end of a stick against a Wall, and at the other end let a Line and 2 Plummet hang, till the shadow of the stick and string hang in a straight Line upon the Wall, (being held square wise) mark both ends of the shadow, upon which place your stile, that the distant of the lower end, from the Wall, may be 37 De∣grees, 3 Minutes, and draw the hour Lines as before, and when the days are at the longest, you may add more hour Lines; set the stile square wise from the Wall. stile stile The 37 Degrees, 30 Minutes must be taken from the Quadrant, for the height of the Stile, and ready to fasten
upon the Shadow; if this stile is placed upon a Board, fastened to the South Wall, it will serve for a Northern Di∣al on the other side of the Wall, turn∣ing the Stile upside down, and draw the hour Lines as before. And Direct East or West Dials. You may place the stile as before, by setting a Board Southward by a Wall, to find the place by a stick and Plummet, and take it away, as soon as you have fastened the Stile, from the Dial. stile. In making of Post Dials, you are to take 52 Degrees, 30 Minutes, the rest, or other part of the Quadrunt, for the height of the stile, being about the
Latitude of Bedford-shire, to stand thus: stile stile. Set the stile upright, and exactly North and South at 12 a Clock, and draw the hour Lines as before. But being that there are so many Books already printed concerning Dial∣ling, I shall forbear (at this time) to write any further thereof, that this Book also may not be too big.

To know when it is Leap-year Divide the present year by 4, what remains, shall be for Leap-year, o; for past, 1, 2, or 3. Example. One remain, it's first after Leap-year. To rate Town Taxes Suppose A. hath an Estate worth 35 pounds a year, payeth 5 s. 10 d. to a Subsidy or Tax, what shall B. pay, whose Estate is worth 100 pounds per Annum? Answer, 16 s. 8 d.
If 35 l. pay 70 d., what shall 100. l.. That is 16 s. 8 d. Suppose a Tax or rate of 39 l. is laid upon a Town for certain uses, whose value of the Town Rent is 900 l. per Annum, I demand every mans propor∣tion of what he shall pay according to his Rent. If one man in the said Town be worth 100 l. per Annum, what shall he pay to the said Rate? Reduce the 39 l. into farthings, and say:

To measure Timber of three equal sides, being at the end like this Figure following. And one side is 16 Inches, and the doted Line, or perpendicular ten Inches. Multiply half the doted Line, 5, in∣to the base or one side, and that pro∣duct by 62, if it be the length in Inches, and the last product divide by 1728, the Inches in one foot, as in round and square Timber measure, and the Quo∣tient shews the number of Feet. To measure Timber, having 5, 6, or 7 equal sides. Multiply half the Compass by half
the thickness, and that product by the Length in Inches, and work as before. To measure a Cone or Spire Steeple. Multiply half the Compass at the bottom thereof, by half the thickness, and that Product by the third part of the length, shews the Content in Inches, the which divide by 1728, as before. To measure part of a Circle. semicircle First, To find the half of the arch Line A B C, divide the Line A C into
four equal parts, and set three of the parts from Z to K, and draw the doted Line K Z, which suppose to be 18, and the whole 36. Secondly, Multiply the half of the arch Line 18 by 14 the doted Line A to X, the Center as if it had been half a Circle, and it gives 252 Inches. How to find a true square. Draw a Line at Pleasure, and di∣vide it in the middle, and set one Foot of the Compasses at one end, and make a mark and cross it, at the other end, and from the cross draw a Line to the middle of the first Line.

To lay down upon paper an Angle con∣taining any number of Degrees and Mi∣nutes, by the Line of Chords. Line of Chords. The Line of equal parts for platting of Ground. rulers The Line of equal parts is of great use in ta∣king the plat of a Close in Pa∣per. The Line of Chords is of use for to take the height of a stile in making o Sun-Dials, &c▪ somewhat there of in this Book▪
Example. Draw a Line at pleasure as A B from the point A, let it be required to make an Angle of 40 Degrees, 20 Mi∣nutes. First, Extend the Compasses upon the Line of Chords, from the begin∣ning thereof to 60 Degrees always, and with that extent set one foot upon the point A, and with the other de∣scribe the doted Line D C, then with the Compasses take 40 Degrees, 20 Minutes, which is the quantity of the desired Angle.
Example. the measurement of an angle To take the plot of a Close by the Line of equal parts. Measure the length of one hedge in Chains and Links or Poles, and the tenth part of a Pole, and for every pole take one part from the Line and the tenth part, and draw the length on Pa∣per; do so with the next hedge, and to know how to set these two hedges in their right place, make an Angle like
the Figure following, do so with the other part of the Close. Measure this to find the Angle. Two places only differing in Latitutde, to find their distance. First, If the two places do differ only in Latitude, and lye both of them on one side of the Equinoctial (in which the Sun is in, when the days and nights are equal) you must substract the lesser Latitude from the greater, and the re∣mainder is the distance required. Or, Secondly, But if the two places pro∣pounded, lie the one on the Northside the Equinoctial, and the other on the
Southside, then you are to add the two Latitudes together, and the Sum will give their distance in Degrees and Mi∣nutes, the which reduce into Miles, allowing 60 Minutes for 60 Miles. The Latitude of places is known by a Table in some Almanacks. Of Reduction. l. multiplied by 20 are s. s. multiplied by 12 are d. d. multiplied by 4 are q. Of Division. q. divided by 4 are d. d. divided by 12 are s. s. divided by 20 are l. Example. In 896 l. how many shillings, pence and farthings.
Proof. In 860160 farthings, how many pence, shillings and pounds.
Pounds multiplied by 3 are No∣bles, and the Nobles divided by 2 are Marks. Pounds multiplied by 4 are Crowns. Pound weights divided by 112 are Hundreds. Ounces divided by 16 are pounds. Inches divided by 12 are Feet. Minutes divided by 60 are hours. So minding the parts, you may re∣duce all sorts of measures or weights, backward and forward, &c.
Of Division. To divide 576 pounds amongst 4 men, set it in this manner. BEgin thus, saying, how many times 4 can I have in 5. one time, (but if I could not have taken 5 or the figure in that place out of the figure above, then it should be set a place further, as under the 7) then set one in the Quotient or crooked line, and say 1 time 4 is 4, take 4 from 5 and there rests 1, set one over the 5, and cancel the 4 and the 5, and the work stands thus.
Now the divisor 4 must be removed a place further, that is under the 7; then say, how many times 4 can I have in 17, the figures above 4. I can have 4 times, then set 4 in the Quotient, and say, 4 times 4 is 16, take 16 from 17 and there rests 1, set the one over the 17, and cancel the 17, and the work stands thus: Lastly, there is one place more to set your Divisor, 4, that is under 6, saying, how many times 4 can I have in 16? just 4 times, set 4 in the Quo∣tient, and say 4 times 4 is 16, take 16 from 16, and there remains nothing, and the work is done, and stands thus.
By this Rule you may divide any number by one Figure; but to divide by 2, 3 or 4 Figures is harder. I will give you one example, by which the ingenious may (by the pract∣ice of the Pen) find out the rest. Example. Divide 288 l. amongst 16 men, set it down thus. Saying, how many times 1 in two? (once) If I say twice, then I cannot take twice 6 out of 8; then set one in the Quotient, and say 1 time 1 is 1, take 1 from 2 and there rests 1; set 1 over the 2, and cancel the 2: then one time 6 is 6, take 6 from 8 and there remains 2; set 2 over the 8, and can∣cel the 8, and 1, and 6, and the work will stand thus.
Then remove the divisor 16, and say, how many times 1 in 12? I say, 8 times, (but if I had said 9 times, I could not have taken 9 times 6 out of 38) therefore set 8 in the Quotient saying, 8 times 1 is 8, take 8 from 12 and there rests 4, set 4 over the 12, and cancel the 12. Lastly say 8 times 6 is 48, take 48 from 48 and there remains none, or 8 from 8 and 4 from 4, and the work is done, and stands thus: Note, that whereas you were to take
48 out of the Figures above; suppose you had been to have taken 48 out of 56 above, you might borrow 10 to put to the 6, as in Substraction, pay∣ing it as one in the next figure or fi∣gures to the Left hand, as thus: from 56 take 48 rests 08 To prove a Division Sum. Multiply the Quotient by the Divi∣sor, and the Product is the same with the dividend, (if it be right) adding thereto the remainder, if any be.
Example. To divide any number by 10, 100, 1000, &c. Cut off so many Figures from the Right hand of your dividend, as there are Ciphers in your Divisor, and the figures remaining towards the Left hand in your dividend, is your Quotient.
Example. How to measure a Wood by the help of a Quadrant, and measuring only round the same. FIrst, set up marks at each corner of the Wood, that three Marks may be seen at once; then at one of these cor∣ners place a Stool, and lay the Quad∣rant flat thereon, and take sight to two of the marks on each side, and mark upon Paper the Degrees of the Angle, and measure to the said two marks in sight, and lay them on the same Paper by the Line of equal part
in this Book, do so at all the other cor∣ners, till thou hast closed up the Plot, or Wood, the which you may with ease measure into Acres by the same Line of equal parts upon your Paper. Example. Note, that if your Quadrant be too little, join 2 Quadrants together, or do it by a board, &c. for want of a plain Table.
So your plot upon the paper makes 3 Triangles, and to measure one of them, multiply for one Triangle the longest doted Line, by half the middle doted line, or perpendicular gives the content; work so the other two Triangles, and add them together, and the work is done.

To know whether water may be convey∣ed by a Pipe, laid under the Earth, from a Pond or Fountain to your dwelling. TAke a Staff or Pole, long enough, and set it upright in the water of the Pond, and mark how many foot is above water; then set another Pole of the same length at the place where you would have the Water conveyed, and at the top of your first Staff or Pole, place the left Edge of a Quadrant, and through the sights spie the top of the other Pole, and if the Plummet cut any Degrees, the Water cannot be con∣veyed so as to run of it self through a Pipe.
Having the length of a Close, to find the breadth of an Acre. Suppose the length of a Close be 50 Pole, divide 160 by 50. Another way to measure Land, Pa∣ving, Hangings, Seeling, Tiling, &c. by Multiplication, the Pole yard Ell, &c. that you measure with, being first divid∣ed into 100 parts. Example. If a piece of Land be 20 Poles, and
25 parts, or a quarter of a Pole both ways, or length and breadth, multiply them as whole numbers thus: Always cut off from the Product 4 figures next the right hand, and it is parts of a Pole, and them toward the eft are Poles. As 410 Poles, 0625/10000 parts of one Pole.

The Use of the Table. Suppose the length of a Close or fur∣long be 50 Poles, how many Poles and Feet of 16 ½ Feet to the Pole, is the breadth of an Acre. Look for 50 in the first Column and against it is 3 Pole, 3 Feet, and a small matter more to make an Acre: This Table is almost exact, but to do it by Arithmetick is more exact. Note that in one Acre is 160 square Poles. A square Pole is 16 ½ foot both ways or 272 square feet is in a Pole.
An useful Table for a Shop-keeper to have by heart. d.   s. d. 20 is 1 8 30 2 6 40 3 4 50 4 2 60 5 0 70 5 10 80 6 8 90 7 6 100 8 4 110 9 2 120 10 0 IN Arithmetick the four first and chief Rules are called, Addition, Sub∣traction, Multiplication, and Division. First, Addition is the adding of two
figures, or other numbers together, as 7 and 8 is 15, &c. Example. Suppose I have Apple-Trees 136 Pear-Trees 076 Cherry-Trees 107 Plumb-Trees 036 In all 355 To sum it up, begin at the lowest figure 6, saying, 6 and 7 is 13, and 6 is 19, and 6 makes 25, set down 5 at the bottom, and carry the 20 as 2; saying 2 as I carry and 3 is 5, and 7 is 12, and 3 is 15, set down the odd 5, and carry the 10 (as before) saying 1 and 1 is 2, and 1 is 3, set it down, so the total Sum is 355.
The second Rule, Substraction, is the taking of a less number out of a greater, and to know what remains, as take 9 from 11, remains 2. Set it thus: From 11   Take 9 Add. Remains 2 Proof. 11   Thirdly, Multiplication is the mul∣tiplying two numbers together, as 6 times 6 is 36, &c. Example. Multiplicand 6 Multiplier 6 Product. 36
Mark how these figures are called, and bear it in mind. Fourth Rule. Division is the finding of a less num∣ber in a greater, saying how many times 4 can I have in 17. Answer, four times, and 1 remains, set it thus: Example. For proof, Multiply the Quotient 4 by the Divisor 4, and it is 16, and add the remainder 1, makes 17 equal to the Dividend.
How to find numbers upon Gunters Line. FIrst, it is figured thus, as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 to the middle, then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 at the end. To find 15 on the Line. For 1 take the Figure 1, for 5 take 5 of the large Divisions, and that's the point. To find 134 on the Line. For the figure 1, take the figure 1 on the Line, for 3 take 3 of the great Divisions, and for 4 take 4 of the smal∣lest Divisions. Note, that the Figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 sometimes signifie them∣selves
alone, sometimes 10 20 30, &c. sometimes 100 200 300 1000, &c. Multiplication by the Line. Multiply 5 by 7. Set one foot of the Compasses in 1, and extend the othr to 5 upwards, with that extent place one foot in 7, and the other foot will fall upon 35, the Product or Answer. Division by the Line. Divide 35 by 7, the proof of the last Question, therefore work back∣wards, thus: As 7 is to 1, so is 35 to 5, the Quo∣tient or Answer.
If 45 yards of Cloath cost 30 l. what will 84 yards cost. Which is, As 45 to 30 l. so 84 to 56 l. Extend the Compasses downwards, from 45 to 30, that extent will reach downwards from 84 to 56 l. the price. Those that desire to know more of this Rule, called also the Line of Pro∣portion, may buy a Book thereof writ∣ten by William Leybern, price 1 s. To reduce one sort of Coin or Money into another, of several Nations, as also Measures and Weights. Example, In 2990 French Crowns of 6 s. the piece, how many pounds English. Crowns. 2990   6 Shillings. 17940
Another. In 798 l. how many Scotish Marks, of thirteen pence half penny the piece. Reduce the 798 l. into half pence, and the Product divide by 27 (the number of half pence in 13 ½ d.) and the Quotient gives the Answer. So may you reduce several other Coins, from one to another. Note that by the same Rule you may also reduce several sort of weights, or Measures, one into another, by re∣ducing your Question into pounds or ounces, &c. or your Measures into feet, inches, or Barley corns, &c. or into pints, &c. and divide the Product by the number of Ounces, or Inches, or Pints, or Els, &c. that is in the measures that you would reduce it into,
(the dividend and the divisor being both of one denomination) and the Quotient will shew the Answer. Therefore to gain skill, be often try∣ing with a Pen, which helps more than much reading, and comparing one Rule to another, to see how they agree, or differ, by the well perusing of the Ta∣ble at the end of this Book, &c. How to draw out upon Paper any great Letter, or other thing that's writ∣ten or printed upon Paper. FIrst, Take a Board of about one foot square, or more, set it sloping like a Desk, that the Light may come under it, in the middle thereof make a hole of what bigness you please, and place a piece of Glass therein to lie even with the Board, starch the edge with Paper, and it is ready for use.
Secondly, take your Copy and lay it on the Glass, and upon that a piece of Paper, and pin them together at the corners, and then with a Pen you may draw the Letter, &c. And so by use you may come to draw without a Glass. Thirdly, if you desire to draw a great Letter or other thing, greater or less than the Copy, draw cross Lines with black Lead of an equal distance up∣on the Letter or Copy, (which you may rub out again with the crumbs of white Bread,) like unto a harrow. Then draw upon your Paper as ma∣ny cross Lines, at equal Distance, ac∣cording as you would have your Let∣ter in bigness, observing that you draw the parts of the Letter C in each square that answereth them in your Paper.

The signification of the seven Arts. 1. Grammar, signifies to write. 2. Rhetorick, to speak fluently. 3. Logick, to speak and reason. 4. Astronomy, the knowledge of the Stars. 5. Geometry, measuring. 6. Musick, Authors of Verses. 7. Arithmetick, is numbering. A Mathematician is one that is skil∣led in the four last Arts. Mechanick, or handycraft Trades∣man. Zenith, signifies the Sky over our heads. Nadir, under our Feet, or opposite. A semicircle, is half a Circle. A Trapezia, is two Triangles join∣ed.
Gunter's Line. How to measure Board or Glass. Suppose a Table or Board be 36 Inches wide, and 10 Foot long. Extend the Compasses from 12 the Center upwards to 36, and that ex∣tent will reach from 10 the Length to 30 foot the Answer. This is called over-board Measure, being the breadth is above 10 Inches. So reckon the great Divisions on the Rule. Under board Measure is when the breadth is under 10 Inches wide.
Example Extend from 12 the Center, to 9 the breadth downwards, that extent will reach from 15 the Length down∣wards, to 11 Foot the Answer. How to find the true square of a round Timber Stick. Suppose it is 62 Inches about, ex∣tend always from 10 in the middle of the Rule downwards to 62 the Com∣pass, the same extent always take from 28 downwards, will reach to 17 Inches the square. How to find the number of Feet in a stick that is 17 Inches square, and 13 Foot long. Extend from 17 the square to 12 always, that extent twice from 13 the length downwards, will reach to 26 Foot, the Answer.
Or if the square be 24, and length 8 Foot, extend from 12 to 24 the square, that extent will reach twice from 8 to 32 Foot Answer. This is called over-Timber Measure.

Find the breadth in the first Column, and against it is 26 Inches, and 2 tenth parts of an Inch to make a Foot.
Note, that when a Board or Timber is broader at one end than the o∣ther, add the breadth at both ends together, and take the half thereof for the true breadth or measure it ex∣actly in the mid∣dle, and it is the same in a piece of Land, that lies so, &c.

The flatter the Tim∣ber is, the greater is the errour; but if it be almost as thick as it
is wide, this way is well e∣nough; for whereas the Carpenter's Rule common∣ly measures square Timber for more than it is, and round Timber a great deal less, because of allowance for Chips, as they say, which is most allowable in Oak of any other.   C.         Tun.   q s. d     l. s. d 1 2 4     2 16 8 2 4 8     4 13 4 3 7 0   l. 7 0 0             C   d l. s. d s. l. s. d 1 0 9 4 1 5 12 0 2 0 18 8 2 11 4 0 3 1 8 0 3 16 16 0

THe Book, out of which I recited that part of Astrology in page 71 &c. has been printed this 30 years, and no answer has yet been given thereto, by any, as the Author (knoweth of) who is still living in Buckingham-shire. Obj. It hath been Objected unto me; saying, Why dost thou write against Astrology, seeing thou hast taught some People something thereof? Answer. In Answer to which, I must confess, I have been desirous after knowledge (as most young men are) not considering (at that day) that there is no true knowledge, but what is given only by Gods Spirit; and also not con∣sidering that the Serpent is more subtile than all the Beastly nature of Man, who begets de∣sire in Peoples hearts after all the vanities that's to be found in this world (still to uphold his Kingdom in their hearts) and things unlawful to be sought after by any (but more especially Christians) this Serpent, or roaring Lyon, that seeketh whom he can devour, or overwhelm in vanity, or choak by the Love and cares of this world, &c. he saying to some, ye shall be as Gods to predict things to come by me, &c. ye shall have the Friendship, and the Glory of the world which I will give thee, if thou wilt worship, or believe in me, &c. and so he keeps
the minds of most men imployed in the many follies, and bewitching fancies, and cumbered about the many things (as aforesaid) that they neglect the one thing needful (Gods Grace in their hearts) which Grace if truly minded, the Devil could not overcome them by his tempta∣tions (viz.) with the fading Glory of this world, &c. this Grace being the Armor of a Christian) which hath appeared to all men, Titus 2, 11▪) which is but one saving Grace (saying aside the School Divines, distinction of more than one) for the least measure thereof (if kept to) will resist the Devil, that he flies; for in it he hath no part; and it is so joyous to the true Christian, that for it, and by it, he doth for∣sake the Devil and all his Works, the vain Pomp, and Glory of the world, with all the covetous desires of the same, the carnal desires of the Flesh, and not to follow, and be led by them. The forsaking of these vices, makes a Christian; not the often saying, or hearing, or reading them. Therefore I praise God, who (by his Grace) hath kept me, that by it, I soon come to see the net, which the Devil spreadeth, to catch all the searchers into the Astrological Art, &c. (by the golden bait of perishing Glory, but all have found him a Lyar (before Death) that have trusted to him) out of whose mysterious Charms, there is no way to escape, but by apply∣ing
the whole heart (to Gods Grace aforesaid) in which the blood of Christ Jesus is witnessed that cleanseth from all Sin, yea, though thou hast made a Covenant with Death and Hell; the Lord will break it, if thou truly returns to his Grace (and go out no more) for in it is the Pearl of great Price, and for which all the truly wise Merchant Men will sell all (their fading Riches in Sensual-wisdom, Glory, and Babilo∣nish skill) to purchase, or obtain more and more thereof, from the hand of God. I was alwaies against the practise of resolving of Horary questions (so called) seeing Peo∣ple run to the Astrologers to be resolved in things (at this day) as People did in former Ages, run to the Oracles of their Wooden-Gods,When the De∣vil was dumb, at any time in the Wooden Gods (which they & the heathen Or∣acles were e∣ver since Christs Offering, &c.) the Priests to keep the people in Ignorance, put into them a man or men to speak (unknown to the people) to resolve their doubts, &c. Dan. 3. Query. Hath that man put a∣way all Idols, that performs a Worship made up, by mens invention, and doth not perform all the worship to the true God by the immediate Teachings and Leadings of Gods Spirit, &c. John 4.24. Athiest-like, as if they did believe that there is not a God in Israel to take Counsel at; Wo to the Rebel∣lious Children, saith the Lord, that taketh Counsel, but not of me, &c, Isa. 30.1. Wo unto them that seek deep to hide
their Counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the Dark, and they say, who seeth us, and who knoweth us? Isai. 23.15. There are many devices in a mans heart, nevertheless, the Coun∣sel of the Lord, that shall stand, Pro. 19.21. God Created the Day, &c. and God saw, that it was good, Gen. 1.5, 10. Contrary to which our Astrological observers of Times, say, that there are 5, 6, 7, and sometimes more, evil, or unfortunate days in every month (that is to say) every day, that the Moon is in Conjunction, square or opposition to the two Stars, called Sa∣turn, and Mars, saying, these are unfortunate days, full of fears, in these days take no Journy, take no Physick, &c. And when the Moon is Conjunction, &c. of the Star called Venus (which is two or three times in a Month) such days, they say, are days of pleasure and delight, &c. Thus Reader have I shewen thee a little of our Astrological Observers of Times (in this Nation) and whether these things differ at all from the Observers of Times mentioned by Mo∣ses, Deut. 18.14. saying unto the Children of Israel (viz) and because of these abominations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out before thee, v. 12 (aforesaid) Now let the witness, for the true, and living God in thine heart be the Judge, and not the selfish and devilish Wisdom that reigns in som∣men, that are so wise to do evil, (as the saying
is) can make a bad cause seem good; and a good cause seem bad, if it stands not with their interest in the obtaining of Earthly ends, &c. Let Love be without dissimulation, abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good, Rom. 12.9. The Astrologers will not own, that they fol∣low the Magick Art, or going on towards it, which nothing seems clearer, for people go to them to be resolved in their doubts (as the Ba∣bilonians did to their Magicians as unto an Ora∣cle, and they know that they cannot resolve doubts infallibly by all the Art of Astrology, without the help of the seven planetary Angels of the Magicians (aforesaid) nor then neither (yet the Devil helps them most as to perform such things (when God has given them up to hardness of heart (by often rebellion against his good Spirit) for Lilly in one of his Alma∣nacks, adviseth some Students of Astrological, and Magical Books Printed in that Year, as also of Sigils, Lamens, Images, and the Magick of the Ancients, &c. I hold (saith he) the present time capable of receiving, &c. you may per∣ceive that in all their Art, nor the Devil in any of the Magicians could foresee, the great dry∣ness of the Earth (which God was pleased to send this Year 1681 to shew how soon he can blast all, if people turn not from the evil of their ways (that Hay in less than six weeks time, rose from ten shillings a Load to forty in
some places, and came to be plentiful, before the Summer was ended; therefore in God a∣lone let us trust, and in no Art of the Egypti∣ans, for the Devil was a lyar from the begin∣ning, and saith G. Abbot, late Archbishop of Canterbury (so called) in a description of the World, p. 115, 116, for in India, and all the Eastern parts, so especially in this Country, their Noblemen, and Priests, and very many people, do give themselves to all Arts of Divination, here were the great Sooth-sayers, Enchanters, and Wisemen, as they call them, here were the first Astrologians, which are so described and derided in the Scripture, it is thought that a great reason whereof these Chaldeans were ex∣pert in the laudable knowledge of Astrono∣my, was partly because the Country is so plain, that being without hills, they might more fully and easily discover the whole face of the Hea∣ven, and partly because the old Fathers which lived so long, not only before, but in some good part also after the flood of Noah, did dwell in or near to these parts, and they by observation of their own, did find out, and discover many things of the Heavenly Bodies, which they de∣livered as from hand to hand to their posterity, but as Corruption doth stain the best things, so in process of time, the true Astronomy was defi∣led with superstitious Rules of Astrology (which caused the Prophets Isaiah, and Jeremi∣ah so bitterly to inveigh against them.)
And then in their fabulosity they would re∣port that they had in their Records Observati∣ons for 2500 years, which must needs be a very great untruth, unless we will qualifie it, (as some have done) expounding their year, not of the revolution of the Sun, but of the Moon, whose course is ended in the space of a Month, Quid enim iniquius, quam ut oderint homines quod ignorant, etiamsires meretur odium? Tertul. A∣pologet. The Lord frustrated the tokens of the Stars, and maketh Diviners mad, that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish, Isa. 44.24, 25.
Fortune telling, by the Lines in the Hand, an Egyptian Folly. THE Astrologers pretend, that they can prognosticate of the future happiness or unhappiness of Nations, and also peoples good and evil fortune by the Stars, or Host of Heaven; (which the Heathen worshipped as Gods.) And they also hold, that the Bodies of Men, Beasts, Hearbs, Mettals, &c. are under the Planets Government, and that we are to ad∣vise, or take Counsel of them (according to their Astrological Aphorisms) when we gather Hearbs, go to War, &c. 2 Sam. 5.19. Can they yet say, that they do not adore or worship the Host of Heaven, as the Heathen did? 2 Kin. 17.16.21.3. Act. 7.42. When the Lord hath said, Jer. 10.2. Learn not the way of the Heathen, &c. And do not the Astro∣logers also run into Egyptian-darkness, by tel∣ling Peoples Fortunes by the Lines or Marks in their Hands, (still going for Counsel, Isa. 30.1. to the Host of Heaven, like the Heathen and Egyptians) saying, one Line in the hand, is the Line of Saturn, another part they call th Mount of Jupiter, another of Mars, Sol, Venus, &c. and so are leading People back into Egypt, and taking the Heathen Gods for Leaders and
Governers, as if man was altogether in a brutish State, and had nothing of God manifest in him, Rom. 1.19. though in God he is to live, move, and have his Being, and know him to govern his whole heart and Soul; but not moved, ruled and Governed by any of the heathen Gods: yet the Lights in the firmament, to separate the day from the night (every Christian owns them in their places) for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years, Gen. 1.14. as God hath placed them in, in which they keep their places, in dividing the day from the night, &c. though man hath not kept his place, and we are not to fear them, as having Dominion over us, Jer. 10.2. but the Lord God only who made them; and still to admire his wonderful works in the Creation: But to be brief, (saith W. S.) But if this Mount (that is, the Mount of Venus so, called by him in the hand) be infortunated by evil Lines, or Lines from evil places, and ir∣regular figures, shews a Lecherous person, an Adulterer, a poor, base, sordid wretch, who shall spend his substance on Whores, &c. Now if the Fortune-teller gives this judgment on such a person, by the Lines aforesaid, and is really such a person; will not this judgment by the Lines, more harden his heart through this Idolatrous belief, that he may have by these Lines aforesaid, that may cause him to say, this is my fortune, I cannot help it, God hath so made me? &c. and so remains in Darkness
and Errour. Oh! What will they make man to be! (whom God hath created in his Image, 1 Cor. 11.7.) A Beast, nay, of some men they liken to be created worse than a Beast, to be born with such evil marks upon his hand; these marks happen but to some, say they; but this blind belief happens to too many, that believe that the Stars, and the said marks in the hand, shew the whole course of mens lives. And fur∣ther, saith he, Therefore it behoves the in∣dustrious and studious Artist not to determine all things at first sight, (that is of the hand;) for no man can attain the knowledge of all particulars at one Inspection; but yearly to make new Observations, as the per∣son encreases in age. See W. Salmon of Chi∣romancy, who for proof quotes Job 37.7. by the new Translation, viz. He sealeth up the hand of every man, that all men may know his work. But in the old Translation I find it is, With the force of the Rein he shutteth men up, and all men may know his work: (mark the difference.) Now blessed be the Lord, the living God, that hath unvailed to many this gross Babylonish and Egyptian Spirit of Darkness, (that by its sen∣sual Wisdom) would draw people to trust to a Reed of Egypt, (Jer. 17.5.) which turneth the truth of God into a lye, and worshippeth and serveth the Creature, forsaking the Creator, which is blessed for ever. Rom. 1.25. Behold, you trust in lying words that cannot pro∣fit. Jer. 7.8.
Concerning a Soothsayer, or Augurer, that pretends to know things to come by the flying of Birds. THe Rabbins speak in this wise: He is a Soothsayer, who will say, because a morsel of Bread is falln out of his Mouth, or his staff out of his hand, or his Son called him back, or a Crow croked unto him, or a Goat passed by him, or a Serpent was toward his Right hand, or a Fox on his Left hand, therefore he will say, do not this or that to day: These words are used, Gen. 30.27. I have learned Ex∣perience, (saith Laban) that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake. Again, Gen. 44.5. Is not this the Cup in which my Lord drinketh? and whereby he di∣vineth? That is, proveth or maketh trial or ex∣perience what manner of men ye are. The Heathen people were very superstitious in these observations; some days they counted unlucky, others lucky, (as our Astrologers do now) some unfortunate to begin Battle, and some days un∣fortunate to marry: and as they were supersti∣tious in observing unlucky signs, (as they called them) so likewise in the means used to avert the
evil portended: The means were either words or deads; thus if an unlucky bird (so called) or such like came in their way, they would fling stones at it: And of this sort is the scratch∣ing of a suspected Witch, which (at this day) amongst the simpler sort of people, is thought to be a means to cure Witchcraft. By words also they thought to prevent the evil signified by such signs, when they say, This evil light on thine own head. Vid. apud Theophrast. Character. & D. Kinchien radic. My people ask Counsel at their stocks, and their Staff teacheth them: for the Spirit of Fornication hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. Hos. 4.12. Ezek. 21.21. Lev. 18.26, 31. Eccles. 24.5, 6, 7.
The manner of the Moons Eclipse. THe word Eclipse, is as much as to say, as to want light, and to be darkned, or in part hidden from our sight. When the Sun and Moon are opposite one to the other, diametrically, and the Earth in the very midst between both, that is, when a right line drawn from the center of the Sun, to the center of the Moon, passing through the Center of the Earth, for the Body of the Earth, and water being thick, and not transparent, casting his shadow to that point, which is opposite to the place of the Sun, will not suffer the Moon to re∣ceive any light from the Sun, from whence she borroweth her light (as the Astronomers write.) And note, that every time she is at the full, she is opposite to the Sun, and yet the Earth is not at every such full, diametrically betwixt her and the Sun, for then she should be Eclipsed at every full, which indeed cannot be, unless she be either in the head or tail of the Dragon so called, being (two opposite places in the Skies, or Heavens. Now the Moon is Eclipsed in part, when the Sun, the Earth and the Moon be met in one self diametral line, but the Moon is declining either on the one side, or the other.
But note, that the Eclipses of the Moon may be universal, because the Earth is far bigger than the Moon, and thereby able to shadow the whole Body. The manner of the Suns Eclipse. THe Eclipse of the Sun is when the Moon is betwixt the Sun and the Earth, which chan∣ceth in a conjunction▪ or new of the Moon, and yet not in every conunction, but when it falleth in one of the two opposite parts of Heaven cal∣led the head or tail of the Dragon, which may chance (as is said before) either totally, or in part, totally in respect of those parts of the Earth whereon the Shadow directly falleth, for seeing the Moon is far less than the Earth, she cannot shadow all the Earth, and therefore the Eclipse of the Sun cannot be universal, but yet to some part of the Earth, it may be total or dark, to some partly, and to others nothing at all.

The Ʋse of this Table. Add the Hours and Minutes right against each Haven, to the Moons coming to the South, and the whole result will be the time of the Tide, or high water. By this Table you may see what point of the compass the Moon is in, at the time of the Tide, or full Sea. The Moons coming to the South is found in an Almanack. The Characters of the seven Planets. Saturn, ♄ Jupiter, ♃ Mars, ♂ Sol, ☉ Venus, ♀ Mercury, ☿ Luna. ☽ The Characters of the 12 Signs. Aries, ♈ Taurus, ♉ Gemini, ♊ Cancer, ♋ Leo, ♌ Virgo, ♍ Libra, ♎ Scorpio, ♏ Sagitarius, ♐ Capricornus, ♑ Aquarius, ♒ Pisces. ♓ To find what sign the Sun or Moon is in. What sign is the Sun in the 6th day of Sep∣tember, 1681. First find the day of the month by an Almanack, and right against it is 24 d.
0 m. in ♍, the Moon at the same time is in 17 d. 25 m. in ♏. Do so another time. Circles of the Sphere. Note, that the aforesaid 12 signs in the Zo∣diack, (so called,) are only as a supposed Circle or Circles, divided into 12 equal parts, (in the Firmament) whose breadth is about 23 d. 30. m. on each side of the equinoctial Line towards the two Pole Stars; the whole Circum∣ference (or round the World) of this Circle, is 360 Degrees, and every Degree upon the Earth is 60 miles. Secondly, Every one of these 12 Signs are divided into 30 Degrees, and every Degree into 60 Minutes, &c. Thirdly, The outmost side of this Circle, or Circles, towards the North Pole, is called the Tropick of Cancer, (one of the said 12 signs) the which when the Sun is in (about the 11th of June) the days are at the longest. Fourthly, And the other side of this Circle, next the South Pole, is called the Tropick of Capricorn, the which when the Sun is in, (a∣bout the 11 of December) the days are at the shortest.
Fifthly, In the middle of this Circle, or Cir∣cles, or Zodiack, may be said to be the equi∣noctial Line, into which when the Sun cometh, (about the 10 of March, and the 10th of Sep∣tember) the days and nights are equal throughout the World. Lastly, The Sun is a whole year in passing through all these signs, and the Moon in one Month; and that neither of them come so near the two Pole Stars, as 60 Degrees, which makes that the Earth is so very cold against them, as in Greenland, so called, where there is Ice all the year, being only inhabited by wild Beasts and Fowls in abundance.
Signs of Rain. 1. SUn rising seems bigger. 2. Sun rising with a Circle. 3. Setting in a black Cloud. 4. Sun or Moon looking pale. 5. Sky red in the morning. 6. Often change of the Wind. 7. No dew morning or night. 8. Many small Clouds North West at Even∣ing. 9. Wind long in the South. 10. Few Stars seen. 11. Moons Horns thick at rising. 12. Stars seem bigger. 13. Many Stars and Wind East in Summer. Signs of fair Weather. 1. The Sun looks bright. 2. Mists in the Water. 3. Rain-Bow after Rain. Signs of Frost. 1. Many Stars, and the Wind East.
Signs of Wind. 1. Sun and Moon look red. 2. Sky red in the morning. 3. Murmuring of Wind in the woods. 4. Shooting of Stars. 5. A Circle about the Moon at the Full. These Signs of the Weather are not so falli∣ble as Astrological Predictions. And People sometimes are saying, we want Rain, and sometimes fair weather, all signs fail. Oh! But the greatest want is the want of Obedience to the Talent or measure of Gods Grace in every heart, that would lead People, into Temperance in all things, in fruitful sea∣sons, and out of that mind, that seldom thinks that they have Apparel, Meat, Drink, and Furniture good enough, and that makes waste of any of Gods good Creatures (as too many do) when the poor wants)Jacob vowed, that if God will be with him, and will keep him in the way that he goes, and will give him bread to eat, and raiment to put on, he will give the tenth unto the Lord, Gen. 28.20, 22. Even o will the seed of Jacob at this day, give the Tenths, or more, if need be, of the in∣crease of God Bls∣sings upon their out∣ward Estate, unto the Lord, that is, unto the poor, and Father∣less, and Widdows, that wants relief, Mat. 25.40. 2 Cor. 9.7. So that now, if it shall please God to cause a Fa∣mine, it is but just upon many, who regard not, nor lay to heart the many warn∣ings and threatning Judg∣ments (that hangs over our
heads) which God hath shewed to many, in the midst of many Mercies,) yet but few regard with their whole heart, to seek after Righteousness by de∣parting from iniquity in the fear of the Lord; be∣cause Sin is the chief cause of sorrow, that comes up∣on Man and Beast, and makes the Earth to mourn. Oh, that People should still resist the strivings of Gods good Spirit, as in every Age! Gen. 6.3. that would lead them out of all evil into favour with God, Deut. 28.2, 3, 4, 5. Are people willing to forget, that the sins of the people have in all ages brought Gods Judgments upon them? Which makes the Righteous rejoyce, because many will learn Righteousness when Gods Judgments are in the Earth, Isa 26.9. Though the Righteous (in some outward things) bear a share of the Judg∣ment, yet have they true Content, Peace, and Joy, being redeemed from the Earth, and all vi∣sble things so as to set their hearts upon them. 1 Kin. 8.35, 36, 37. Zeph. 1.3. Deut. 28.47.32.4. Jer. 30.15. Psal. 5.12.38.25. Prov. 11.10.
An Image, called, The Rood of Grace. IN the beginning of the Reformation (in King Henry 8th's time) one Cromwel was greatly in favour with the King, and was made one of his Privy Council, &c. He brought to light and suppressed many Popish Idolatrous Images, and other superstitions of the Church of Rome, for which they sought his death, which the King af∣terwards lamented, &c. One Rood of Grace or Image, wherein a man stood inclosed with a hundred Wires within the Rood, to make the Image goggle its Eyes, nod its head, hang the Lip, move and shake its Jaws, ac∣cording to the value of the gift offered; if it were a small piece of Silver, then would he hang a frowning Lip, if it were a piece of Gold, then should his Jaws go merrily: Thus were poor peoples Souls seduced, and their Pockets pick'd by these Idolatrous forgers, until Crom∣wel caused the said Image to be carried publick∣ly to Pauls (in London,) where the People tore it in pieces. Then in Queen Maries time (Daughter to the said King Henry the 8th,) Bishop Bonner put out a Mandate to the Priests within his Diocess,
commanding, that comely Roods or Images should be again set up in all Churches, &c. the same injunction was published in other Dio∣cesses; for at Cockram in Lancashire, the Parishi∣oners and Wardens had agreed with a Carver to make them a Rood, to set up in their Church, at a certain price, which the Carver did; but the Rood being made of an ugly grim Counte∣nance, they disliked it, and refused to pay the Workman that made it, whereupon by War∣rant he brought them before the Mayor of Lan∣caster, who was a favourer of the Protest∣ants, and a man against Idols; when they came before the Mayor, he asked them why they did not pay the man according to their agreement; they replied, they did not like the grimness of its Visage; saying, they had a man formerly with a handsome Face, and they would have had such another now. Well, said the Mayor, though you like not the Rood, the poor mans labour has been never the less, and it's pitty he should lose; but I tell you what you shall do, pay him the Money you promised him, and if it will not serve you for a God, you may make a Devil of it, at which they laughed, and so de∣parted.
How pleasant Pictures become Idols in the Heart. AN Image, or Idol, saith Paul, 1 Cor. 8.4. is nothing, &c. that is, it is nothing to thee; but if thou set it in thy Heart, and affecti∣onate it, (or any other Picture,) thou bows to it, and this is Idolatry. Thou shalt make thee no graven Image (saith God,) neither any similitude of things that are in Heaven above, neither that are in the Earth beneath, nor that are in the Waters under the Earth; thou shalt not bow down to them, &c. Exod. 20.4, 5. Though we make them, say some people, we do not bow to them, or wor∣ship them, Answer. If thou art covetous after them, and hast inordinate affection to them, thou hast set them in thy heart, and this is Ido∣latry, Ezek. 14.2. Col. 3.5. And worships, and serves the Creatures more than the Creator, &c. Rom. 1.25. Set your affections on things above, not on things on the Earth, Col. 3.2. My Son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways, Prov. 23.26. So that he that has given his heart to God, his affections will not be set upon liknesses, for so his mind may be drawn from God who is to have the whole heart. We may read, that the Heathens did wonderfully adore the like∣nesses
of things, &c. (yet being no example to a Christian, whose heart and Treasure is only in God, and the Lust of the Eye cannot bewitch him) For, saith W. Salmon, in his Book of Drawing, Painting, &c. pag. 244. this imita∣tion of the Life gave the Artizan fame, which fame quickned his aspiring thoughts, adding more fuel to the Flames, till such time as he brought forth a most absolute work, whereby he conceived a joy, content and satisfaction (mark that) as durable as the work it self, upon which he now conceived himself a happy man, and through a just affrance of his Vertues, knows himself to be lifted up above the reach of Envy, where he stands secure of his fame, enjoying in this life (as if he were now consecrated unto Eternity) the Veneration that is like to follow him after his Death; thus an honest emulation, and confidence, bringing forth works of general applause, procureth unto its Author an ever∣lasting glory (then not given only to God) A∣gain in Pag. 246, saith he, Berosus excelled in Astrology, wherefore the Athenians, for his di∣vine Prognostications, (mark that) erected him a Statue with a Golden Tongue, set up in their publick Schools, as Pliny saith, lib. 7. cap. 37. Publick Libraries were furnished also with gold∣en, silver and brass Images of such, whose im∣mortal Souls did speak in those places. The provocation of Vices have also augmented the Art; (mark that,) it hath been (pleasing) to
engrave wanton Lusts upon their cups, and to drink in Ribauldry and Abominations, as Pliny saith in the Proem. of his 33. Book. (Are these things good to be dedicated to a Nation professing Christianity?) And this Author goes on, and tells us how the Ancients depicted their Gods, as Saturn, Jupiter, &c. Diana, Juno, Neptune, &c. In the greatest imaginary Glory, to bespeak their fame, &c. when all these things and the pleas∣ant Pictures, with all the Babylonih rubish, are for the fire of Gods wrath, that draw the heart from God. And it is great pity, that the Au∣thor (whom God hath given so much Wisdom) should rake in this Heathenish and Babylonish rubish, &c. And though God once commanded Moses to make some things under the Law, who hath he commanded, in this Gospel time, to imi∣tate or make the likeness of any thing, that may so affectionate the Heart, as to draw it from God to commit Idolatry? And also though God (to shew his wonder∣ful works) hath made variety of Colours in the Flowers, Hearbs, &c. It is no part of Christia∣nity to deck or cloath our selves in imitation of the colours of Flowers, or to make the likeness of any of them, to so affectionate the Heart, as to forget the giver, or take any Glory to our selves, in drawing the likeness of them (as a∣foresaid) as some have done; but rather give
all Glory unto God, admiring his wonderful power in creating these Flowers, Hearbs, &c. for the use of Man. Lastly, Hast thou made any likeness, or plea∣sant Picture of Religion for others to imitate? or set up any spiritual Gift (given thee of God) above Gods Spirit in thy heart? and dost ad∣minister it unto others, without the immediate leadings of the same Spirit? Thou hast set up an Idol in thine heart. 1 John. 5.21. Little Children, keep your selves from Idols. Amen. If any shall yet deny, that there's an Idoliz∣ing of Pictures and graven Images, [whereby the Lord hath not the whole Heart,] I shall for proof recite some more words out of the aforesaid Author's Book, of painting, graving, &c. in pag. 232, 233, 246, 253, 262. (saith he) And therefore those that would profit much, must take care and pains to furnish their minds with all sorts of useful Images and Ideas. And Pro∣clus saith If you take a man brought forth by na∣ture, and another by art of carving, that by na∣ture shall not seem the statelier, because Art doth many things more exactly: [Where's God's Glory? W. M.] To which Ovid assents, when he saith, that Pygmalion did carve the Snow-white Image of Ivory, with such a happy dex∣terity, that it was altogether impossible that such a Woman should be born. [Are not all
things possible with God? W. M.] The estimati∣on of the Artists were also understood from the esteem and high rates their works were prized at. A Picture of Bularchus a Painter, was valu∣ed at its weight in Gold, &c. Caesar paid to Timomachus Eighty Talents of Gold (about 14000 pounds Sterling) for the Pictures of Ajax and Medea. Many more examples we might produce (saith he) but these may suffice; at length no price was thought equal to their worth, &c. [Was not this Idolizing them? W. M.] Great minded men are most of all given to en∣tertain stately conceits; therefore (saith he) an Artizan (or Artist) ought to be of a magna∣nimous Nature, if not, yet at least he ought with a determined resolution to aim at magni∣ficent things. So it seems that Nature did dis∣pose Nicophanes to a high strain of Invention: Nicophanes (saith Pliny, Lib. 35. Cap. 10.) was gallant and neat, so that he did paint Antiqui∣ties for eternity, (mark that) whereby he was commended for the magnificence of his work, and gravity of his Art. Such Artificers there∣fore as do bring any thing to perfection, must be of an exceeding great Spirit, [then not poor in Spirit, Matth. 5.] and entertain upon every occasion great thoughts, and lofty imaginations, (Isa. 2.8, 11.) by this means they shall gain everlasting Fame, &c. (mark that.) Lastly, A good invention affects the mind, true proportion draws the Eyes, lively motion
moves the Soul. (Is not then God forgotten? W. M.) exquisite colours beguile the phantasie, and an orderly disposition wonderfully charms all the senses; (Here's a joy, but not in God,) if all these unite and center in one piece, how great an ex∣cellence and perfection will appear? what a comely Grace? This Grace it is which in beau∣tiful bodies is the Life of the beauty, and with∣out which its greatest accomplishments cannot please the beholder: [Grace in the heart is the greatest perfection of Beauty. W. M.]The Image or Te∣raphim which Michal put in the Bed, 1 Sam: 19.13. was a com∣pleat Statue, or Im∣age of a man. The use of such Images (saih T. .) was to con∣sult with them as with Oracles, concerning things for the present unknown, or future to come. To this purpose they were made by Astrologers, under certain constellations capable of heavenly Influences, whereby they were enabled to speak. The Idols have spoken vainly, Zec. 10.2. Vid. Aben. Esra, Gen. 31. And among other Reasons why Rachel stole away her Fathers Images, this is thought to be one; that Laban might not by consulting with these Images discover what way Jacob took in his flight. Gen. 31.19. And it is said, that Zorcastes, a King of the Bacirians, in the time of Ninus, he was an excellent Astrolo∣ger, (saith the Au∣thor) and first invent∣ed Magical Arts. They are indeed the most likely men. See pag. 77. For it is not so much (saith he) the per∣fection of Invention, pro∣portion, Colours, Motion, & Disposition apart, which affects the senses; but all these perfections absolutely united, which brings forth that comely Grace and highest perfection, which Art aims at, and the Arti∣zan strives after. [Here the beauty of created things is cal∣led the highest perfection, or Grace, which is only due to God's Power or Grace in the Soul. W. M.] This Grace, saith he, proceeds not from any rules of Art, but from the excellent Spirit of the
Artificer; it is eaer at∣tained by Observation [not called by God to such works; though Bezaleel and Aholi∣ah were called to make curi∣ous works in Gold, in Silver, in Brass, and in Silk, for the Tabernacle. Ex. 31. W. M.] and a good Judgment, than learned by precepts, as Quintilan in his Instituti∣ons, lib. 11. cap. 1. learn∣edly observes. And this Grace is most graceful, when it flows with facility out of a free Spirit, and is not forced or strained out with Labour and toil, which quite spoils and kills the Life of the work: Now this facility springs from Learning, Study, and exercitati∣on, Art and Nature must concur to the Consti∣tution of this Grace; Art must be applied dis∣creetly to those things, which we naturally af∣fect, and not to things which we loath, lest we miss of that Glory which we seek after. [Oh, the sading Glory of this Worlds Wisdom, Art, Learn∣ing, &c. that takes all to itself, &c. W. M.] Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his Wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his Might, let not the rich man glory in his Riches; but
let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understand∣eth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which ex∣ercise Lovingkindness, Judgment, and Righteous∣ness in the Earth; for in these things I delight, saith the Lord. Jer. 9.23, 24. Painting the Face; one of the Marks of of a Jezebel, 2 Kings 9.30. for she pain∣ted her Face, and tired her head, when she heard of Jehu's coming; like the Proud ones of our day. VVIlliam Salmon in his Book before∣mentioned, (saith) some may wonder that we meddle with such a subject as this is, 1 Cor. 3.20. viz painting the Face, cur∣ling, colouring, and poudering the hair. Answer. And so they may well; that a man of so much knowledge (in several things) should encourage the practise of so much vanity, Ephes. 4.17, But let such know (saith he) the painting of a deformed Face, and the licking over of an old withered, wrinkled, and wea∣ther beaten skin are proper appendices to a Painter; since a single deformity in the Body begets a complication of miseries in the mind, &c. Exod. 4.11. Answer. Then Jezebel must learn of the Pain∣ter, to paint her Face, being she is so wicked, to
think it a great misery of mind, not to be, or seem to be more beautiful, than God hath made her; and he tells these slly Women, viz. it shall put admiration into the beholders, and fix them in a belief, that you are the first Fruits of the Resurrection; (where's the washing of Regeneration? Titus 3.5.) Again, though some think the Poets did not much amiss, to fancy the Creature hatcht in Hell, by reason it brings with it such a torrent of dejections, &c. Ans. Is not this sad, that such censures should be given of the Creature, as being hatcht in Hell, if it want some outward beauty, to pleae the lust of the Eye, &c. 1 John 2.16. Again (saith he) by this means your spark∣ling Glories shall fire Platonick Lovers, so that none, though as cold as Saturn, shall be able to resist your actuating flames, but shall force the stoutest heart, to a Sacrifice to Love. Answer. Behold, here's a Sacrifice to a pain∣ted Image, or Face, and an incouragement to be like unto the Daughters of Zion, that were haughty, and that walked with stretched forth necks, and wanton Eyes, &c. whom the wo was against, Isai. 3.16. Again (saith he) but it may chance that some Saint or another, may condemn your hearts for evil, because you strive to make your faces good, and may like your infide the worse, be∣cause your outside may look so well.
Ans. There is that in his heart, that tells him that no Saint will like Jezebels painting; but if no Saint do personally condemn them; the wit∣ness for God in their hearts doth condemn them, when no Eye seeth, when they are spending their time in decking their outside, when with∣in they are full of rottenness, neither do they by this painting make their Faces good (as he saith) but evil to allure and draw men to Sacri∣fice, to such love, as the Harlot in Prove 7. Who said to the foolish young Man, I have perfumed my Bed, &c. Come, let us take our fill of Love, &c. Let not thine heart decline to the ways (of a pain∣ted Woman, though she hath Riches) go not astray in her paths, O young Man, Her House is the way to Hell, going down to the Chambers of Death, &c. Again, yet with Benjamin (saith he) refuse not the many messes of pottage, nor the many changes of Raiment (although one might well enough serve your turn) but receive them from the hands of Joseph, though all the rest of the Brethren be angry. Ans. Here he pleads for the many changes of Raiment (though he offend his Brethren, 1 Cor. 8.13.) which was one of the sins of the Daughters of Zion, Isa. 3.22. And one great sin in this Nation, (when the poor want) and though Joseph did to shew the dear love he had to his only Brother Benjamin, give unto him more than the rest of his Brethren; we do not
read that he received them to become sparkling in Glory, for outward beauty to win any hearts (from God) to Sacrifice to vain and foolish love; but rather was for the cloathing of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is of great price with the God of Heaven, 1 Peter 3.4. 1 Tim. 6.8. Again, (saith he) avoid not Company for want of Beauty, when art affords an innocent supply, but with confidence crucifie that evil conscience, which forbids the use of a little oil to make a chearful countenance, and the drin∣king of a little wine to make a merry heart. Ans. Here he incourages Women not to be shame-faced, contrary to the Apostle, 1 Tim. 2.9. But to be confident, Phil. 3.19. And to Cruci∣fy (saith he) that evil conscience,Complexion makers (so called by God.) such Artizans, who mask Men and Womens Fa∣ces with paintings, & false complexions, he compareth such to Juglers, or Sorcerers, who bewitch the senses, and minds of Men, by changing the Forms of things, ma∣king them appear o∣therwise than indeed they are, see his Civ. & Ec. Rites. lib. 4. c. 10. which forbids the use of oil, &c. to plead for paint for the Face; and so puts darkness for light, and light for darkness; in going about to Crucifie, and call that an evil con∣science, that forbids Jeze∣bels paint, and attire, that their mouths may be smoo∣ther than oil, to deceive the simple, Prov. 5. So ta∣king no care to have oil in their Lamps, to be belo∣ved of the chief Bridegroom, Math. 5.3.
Nor to be cloathed like a Woman professing Godliness with good works, 1 Tim. 2.10. Heb. 6.6. Phil. 3.17, 18. 1 Peter 3.3.4.5. Lastly, Borrow our Artificial Beautifiers (saith he) and become splendid, that you may be fit to be gathered by the hand of some meta∣morphosed Hero, lest in the Garden of defor∣mity, growing green with sickness, you should be taken for thistles, and so crop'd by Asses. Ans. I am even weary of writing of such a whorish mark, or painted Faces, that it grieves my heart, that any professing Christianity should plead for the painting, and attire of Jezebel, and the Babilonish Whore; and that Woman should be so splendid, that the Souls of Men may be ensnared and captivated, to Sacrifice to their Lust; which is very sad, as if the Au∣thor W. S. had never read what our blessed Sa∣viour said, Mat. 5.28. But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh upon a Woman to lust after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his heart. Then is it not a snare of the Devil, that would allure men to last after a Woman; which is caused by these Beautifiers, saying by this means; your sparkling Glories shall fire Plato∣nick Lovers, &c. as before? Therefore (my Son, saith Wisdom) Lust not after her Beauty in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her Eye-lids; Favour is deceitful, and Beauty is vain, but a Woman that seareth the Lord, she shall be praised, Prov. 6.25. & 31, 30.
Who can find a vertuous Woman? For her price is far above Rubies: the heart of her Husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil, she will do him good, and not evil all the days of her life, she seeketh Wool, and Flax, and worketh, willingly with her hands, she looketh well to the ways of her Houshold, and eateth not the Bread of idleness, she stretcheth out her hand to the poor, &c. The Judgments that God will bring upon a proud Woman. Thus saith the Lord, because the Daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks, and wanton Eyes, walking, and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their Feet: Therefore the Lord will smite with the scab the Crown of the Head, &c. and take away the bravery of their tinkling Ornaments, Chains, and Bracelets, their Rings and Jewels, the changeable suits of Apparel, the Hoods and Vails, and have burning instead of Beauty, be∣cause of the filth of the Daughters of Zion, Isa. 3. They are waxen fat, they shine, yea, they overpass the deeds of the Wicked. Jer. 5.28. Wo unto you Scribes, Pharisees, and Hypocrites, for ye are like unto painted Sepulchres, which did appear Beautiful outward, but within full of dead Mens Bones, and of all filthiness, Mat. 23.27. Whereas the aforenamed Author W. S. in p. 376. Complains of some ingrateful men, that
will traduce his well meaning, and skill in Art; And our person (saith he) sought to be rent and destroyed. Answer. Far be it from me to abuse any mans person; (God knows my heart, I love all men,) and for his skill in several com∣mendable Arts, he is worthy of praise (so far as it is due to man;) but for some things written by him, (to gratifie a proud Spirit) which I have answered, as aforesaid, I cannot commend him for, seeing they are contrary to the Gospel and Cross of Christ Jesus, which crucifies the Flesh with the Lusts of the Eye, &c. Hoping in God (that by his Grace) he will shew him his Duty, and what is most profita∣ble (in Art) for a Christian, and make use of his Talent for Gods Glory for the future, which is the prayer of his Loving Friend, W. M. A Charmer is thus described by T. G. aforesaid. HE is a Charmer who speaketh words of a strange Language, and without sense (sometimes) And he in his foolishness thinketh that these words are profitable: That if one say so or so unto a Serpent, or Scorpion, it cannot
hurt a man; and he that sayeth so or so unto a man, he cannot hurt, &c. He that whispereth over a Wound, or readeth a verse out of the Bible; likewise he that readeth over an Infant, that it may not be frighted, or that layeth the Book of the Law, or the Philacteries upon a Child that it may sleep; such are not only a∣mong Inchanters or Charmers, but of those that generally deny the Law of God; because (saith he) they make the words of the Scrip∣ture medicine for the Body, whereas they are not; but medicine for the Soul, as it is written Prov. 3.22. They shall be life unto thy Soul, &c. Among which may be numbered several more Diviners, (Vid Mag. Demon. lib. 2. cap. 1.) whose Practice is forbidden in the Scriptures, Deut. 18.10, 11. in number nine, not because there were no other, but these were the most usual. As 1. An Observer of times. 2. An Inchanter. 3. A Witch. 4. A Charmer. 5. A Consulter with Familiar Spirits. 6. A Wizzard. 7. A Ne∣cromancer. 8. A Consulter with the Staff. Hos. 4.12.9. A consulter with intrals of Beasts; Ezek. 21.21. Now a Consulter with Ob. or with Familiar Spirits, the Magicians Art, (in this day) Such a Diviner was the Damosel, Act. 16.16. and the Witch of Endor. A Consulter with the Staff, (aforesaid) he measureth his Staff by spans, or by the length of his Finger, (Vid. August. 2. de Doctr. Chris ca. 23. saying as he measureth, I will go (to
War, &c.) I will not go, I will do such a thing, I will not do it, and as the last span fell out, so he determined; this was termed by the Hea∣then, divination by the Rods; which way Ne∣buchadnezar consulted with, Ezek. 21.21. Being to make War both with the Jews, and the Am∣monites, and doubting in the way, against whether of these he should make his first onset, he also consulted with the Liver of a Beast, by taking notice of the colour of the Intrails, and if any be displaced, and whether any were wanting, &c. I shall conclude this part (of vain Divinati∣ons) with one memorable example recorded,Jarchi Levit. 19.26. 1 Sam. 29. There King Saul being about to War with the Philistines (God denying to answer him either by Dreams, or by Urim, or by Prophets) upon the fame of the Witch of Endor, he repaired to her, demanding that Samuel might be raised up from the Dead, to tell him the issue of the War. Now that this was not in truth Samuel, is easily proved both by testimonies of the learned, and reasons First, It is improbable, that God who had denied to answer him by any ordinary means, should now deign him an answer so extraordinary. Second∣ly, No Witch or Devil can disturb the Bodies or Souls of such as die in the Lord, Because they rest from their Labours Rev. 14.14. Thirdly if it had been Samuel, he would doubtless have re∣proved Saul, for consulting with Witches, see T. Godw. Civ. & Eccl. Rites lib. 4. c. 10.
Bowing, Worshiping, Cap and Knee to God only, and not to man, under the Gospel Dispensation. 1. HE that performs this Worship to man what doth he more to God, to whom every Knee shall bow. 2. Mordecai refused it to proud Haman. 3. Peter refused it from Cornelius, saying, he was a man. 4. The Angel twice refused this kind of bow∣ing from John, Rev. 19.10.22.9. for this Rea∣son, Because I am thy fellow Servant, and of thy Brethren. 5. It is written, that the customs of the Gen∣tiles we are not to follow. 6. The Apostles desired us not to be con∣formable to the World, &c. Rom. 12.2. As he that respects Persons commits Sin. Jam. 2.9. Lastly, Though it be far from me to judge a those, to whom God hath not shewn the evil o these things (in this day,) yet nevertheless doubt not, but to such as will prove faithf witnesses to Gods Grace in their Conscience God will also shew to them the evil of the things, and not rob God of his Glory, to who all honour, &c. belongs now and for ever.
Of Titles, or Names given to Persons, and Places. THe Titles of Holiness, Eminency and Ex∣cellency used among the Papists to the Pope, and Cardinals, &c. And Grace, Lord∣ship, and Worship to the Clergy among the Protestants, It is a most high usurpation; See R.B. Apolog. pag. 373. How can they say, they follow the Example of Peter and Paul, who never sought such Titles. Hence saith Jude, ver. 25. To the only wise God our Saviour be Glory and Majesty, &c. 1 Pet. 1.16. Neither be ye called Master, saith Christ Jesus unto his followers, Matth. 23.10. That is, ex∣cept it be by those that are really your Servants, Eph. 6.5. If I say to one, I am your Servant, I lye, except I am really his Servant, and at his command in all lawful business whatsoever. And saith Casaubon in his Book of manners and Customs, pag. 169. In this last age he is esteemed an uncivil man, who will not either to his inferiour or equal subscribe himself Ser∣vant. But Sulpitius Severus was heretofore sharp∣ly reproved by Paulinus Bishop of Nola, because in his Epistle, he had subscribed himself his Ser∣vant;
saying, Beware thou subscribe not thy self his servant who is thy Brother; for flattery is sinful, not a Testimony of Humility, to give their Honours to men, which are only due to the one Lord, Master and God. And saith Eli∣hu, Job. 32.21. Let me not accept any mans Person, neither let me give flattering Titles unto man. For I know not to give flattering Titles; in so doing, my Maker would soon take me away. And though Sir, Rabbi or Master, and some other things were customarily used amongst men, before Christ's Ascension; but after his followers grew up into more knowledge of Gods Spirit and Kingdom of Righteousness, they finally reject∣ed it: who being not of the Pharises Spirit, for they love the praise of men, more than God, John 12.43. that Christ Jesus said, Chap. 5. v. 44. How can ye believe which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only? Neither do we read, that the Apo∣stles called an house a Church, or Christs Church, or St. Pauls Church, or Jesus Colledge, or had Bells to call people together, or an hourglass to preach by, or had Deanries, or Prebendries, or sprinkled Infants, or called any thing a Sacra∣ment, or had Mattens, & Evening songs, Organs, Rails, Altars, Fonts, and singing men, and Boys to sing to them. or Hood, Surplisses and Tippets, &c. or did the Apostle preach for Tithes, or yearly hire, or preached by Uses, Reasons, Helps, Motives, &c. studying before∣hand

Nor did compel any to sing in rimes, in imi∣tion of David, saying, I go mourning all the day ng, &c. even by such as never were truly sor∣owful for their Sins. Reader, search thy own heart, and there is Witness for God's ways, which will shew thee from whence all these took root; so mayest hou beled out of Babylon, if thou followest its all, Rev. 18.4.21.7.

Chymical hard words, their signification. A Malgamation, Is a calcining, or corroding Mettals with Quicksilver. Calcination, Is a reducing any thing into Ashes. Coagulation, Is a reducing of any liquid thing to a thicker substance, by evaporating the humi∣dity, or moisture. Digestion, Is a concocting of a crude thing, by an easie and gentle heat. Filtration, Is the separating of any liquid matter from its Faeces, as water from Ashes, through a paper, or flannel bag. Fixation, Is the making of any Volatile Spiri∣tual Body endure the fire. Fumigation, Is the calcining of Bodies by the same Spirit. Insolation, Is the digesting of things in the Sun. Menstruum, Is any liquor that serves for the ex∣tracting the essence of any thing. Reverberation, Is the reducing of the Bodies of Mettals, &c. into a Calx (like unto ashes) by a reflecting flame in a furnace. Sublimation, Is the raising of any matter to the upper part of the vessel, by way of subtile pouders, as Antimony, Saltpeter, &c. Volatile, is that which flyeth the fire.
Transmutation, Is the changing of a thing in substance, colour, and quality; now our Alchy∣mists would have people believe that they have attained to a Pouder, Tincture, Elixir, or Stone of the Philosophers, which will separate all im∣purity from the Bodies of all Mettals, and change it into fine Gold; which I believe, but when they have got this fine Gold, it will but make the old Proverb good, that is, a man may buy Gold too dear; for he that blows away (in a test) all the impurity (as I may say) of about a pound of Silver; and it may be shall scarce have one dram of this fine Gold, so had better sit still; for the separating of Metals from their impurity, leaves but little for the Workman; therefore they had better be silent than write of transmutation of Metals into fine Gold, ex∣cept they can change them in substance, colour and quality as aforesaid. Note, That it was much in my heart to write something of these things, because that many of great wits (so called) are deceived by the Philosophical writers of this and former Ages, and such wits are the most apt to deceive others, in things that are beyond the reach of mortal man, to new create, or so much change nature, as aforesaid, and so comes to be elevated in his mind, and to boast of high attainments in these things; deceiving himself as well as others, by seeking and preparing Earthly Treasures above the Heavenly; for he that has attained to know
God, he need seek no further, for his Riches no man can take from him, it's beyond the finest Gold, because it's everlasting; yea, it's a King∣dom also to the true Christian; but not of this world, (where all things fade.) Now some men, having their hearts in the Earth, have found a Kingdom there, called a Mineral King∣dom (by W. Salmon;) the Mineral Kingdom (saith he) is divided into Metals, Semi-metals, Salts, and Stones. 2. Metals are in number seven, viz. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, and Luna, cal∣led by the vulgar (saith he) Lead, Tin, Iron, Gold, Copper, Quicksilver, and Silver; (must these seven Planets be called the seven Gods of this Mineral Kingdom?) being it's vulgar, to call them Lead, Tin, &c. 3. The Semi-metals are Antimony, Tin-glass, Cinnaber, and Zink. 4. The Salts are chiefly, Vitriol, Sulphur, Arsenick, Allum, Nitre, Borax, and Salt. 5. The chief Stones are Lapis, Calaminaris, Tutia, Lazuli, and Lime-stone. 6. Now out of these (saith he) the Alchy∣mist designs three things, to wit. 1. Either the Counterfeiting of the fine Metals. 2. Or the separation of fine Metals out of the base. Or 3. The generation of the fine Metals out of the base, by transmutation, &c. By generation, and transmutation, what can be meant but by a new Creation of Metals? which no mortal man can do
as I said before, and in p. 376. Let others search as we have done (saith he) like a Philoso∣pher, it is some satisfaction, that the matter here, sought, is really in rerum natura. &c. If I have erred in any thing before written, I beg the Authors pardon; and wish him well believing he knows better things. A short memorandum, when a House is on fire. IF you see the first beginning of the fire, strive to damp it, by spreading wet Linnen∣sheets thereon, and keep the Doors, and Win∣dows close shut, that the fire draw not the wind to force the flame out (till more help come) and also spread Sheets upon all the Buildings near, and to every sheet let one man be to keep it wet, by this means several Buildings have been saved, through Gods Blessing; and amongst the several Judgments that God brings upon people for Sin, this is often one; so fear the Lord, by departing from iniquity then happy are ye, come what will come; for the tryal of the people of God; as also for a Rod for the workers of iniquity; that turn not yet from the evil of their ways, notwithstan∣ding they have seen Gods Judgments, of the Sword, Fire, Sickness, &c.
Embalming of the Dead with the E∣gyptians, Gen, 50.2. THey took out the Bowels of the Dead, they cleansed them, and washed them with the Wine of Dates, and after that, again with Odours, then filled they the Bowels with pure Myrrhe beaten, and Cassia, and other O∣dours (except Frankincense) and sowed them up, after this they seasoned the Corps hidden in nitre seventy days, not longer; after seventy days they washed the Corps, and wrapped it in fine Linnen cloth, gummed, which gum the Egyptians often used instead of Glew, but when the Funeral obsequies were not long delayed, they used another kind of embalming, namely an external, and outward application of Spi∣ces, and Odours without the unbowelling of the Corps; this was used toward our Saviour Christ, John 19.20. Of the Sepulchres, or Tombs, or Caves. They hewed them out in a Rock, six cubits long, and four broad, in which eight other Cells, or lesser holes (or as some say thirteen) were made, as so many distinct receptacles, or Tombs
for the dead Bodies to be be laid in,Talmurd, seder Nezi∣kin. Bava. Bathra cap. 6. as often as they buried any, they were wont to roll a great stone to the mouth of the Cave; Joseph▪ laid the Body of Christ in such a new Tomb, Mat. 27.59, 60. The Jews sounded Trumpets at the Funeral of Noblemen, but for common people or Children they used a Pipe; in this respect it is said, that Jesus when he raised Jairus his Daughter, cast out the Min∣strels, Mat. 9.23. (signifying that where Christ rules in the heart, there is no delight in out∣ward Minstrels.) These Jews were not then come off these things, who hired Women to sing at Burials, &c. and likewise by outward significations of Sorrow, to move the company, and more strongly to affect them, call for the mourning Women, &c. and send for skilful Women, Jer. 9.17. These the Romans called, chief, or skilful mourners. Of Bells to Assemble. But saith (T. G.) the Priests might lawfully blow their Trumpets, and Horns on the Sabbath Day, for the Assembling of the People, num. 10.2. by proportion (saith he) it is now warran∣table for Christians to ring Bells to assemble the People together on the Lords Day, and to take Journies to join with the publick Congregation,
as the Jews say concerning the overthrow of Jericho, which according to their writings fell on the Sabbath Day;R. D. Kimcbi in Josh. 6. he which commanded the Sabbath to be Sanctified, com∣manded it also to be prophaned; saith the Au∣thor: Now whether this practice of Bells ringing for Worship, for Marriages, and for Burials; be to be observed under the Gospel, let the witness for God in every heart be the Judge, &c. And saith (T. G.) Ʋriah the Priest, and Za∣chariah the Son of Jeberechia, are thought to have been God-fathers at the Circumcision of Maher-shalal-hash-baz, Es. 8.2. and from them the custom of having God-fathers in Baptism, to have taken its Original, Stukius de conviv. lib. 1. cap. 16.
The Epistle of Paul to the Laodiceans. 1. PAul an Apostle, not of Man, nor by Man, but by Jesus Christ. 2. To the Brethren, which are at Laodicea, Grace and Peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. 3. I thank my God in all my Prayers, that you re∣main stedfast in him, and in all his works, waiting upon his promise to the day of Judgment. 4. And be not seduced by some unprofitable talkers, who go about to cause you to fall from the Gospel which was Preached unto you by me. 4. Oh that they that were instructed by me, might serve to the profit of the Gospel of Truth, and become diligent in good works of Eternal Life. 6. And henceforth are my bonds manifest, which I suffer for Christs sake. Wherefore I rejoyce in heart, and account it Eternal Salvation: 8. That such is done through your Prayers, by the working of the holy Spirit, whether by Life, or Death. 9. For I have a Will and a Joy to die in Christ, who will through the same Mercy give you to have the same love, and to be of one mind. 10. Therefore beloved Brethren, as you have heard in my presence, that keep and finish in the fear of God,
so shall you have Eternal Life, for God will work it, and perfect it in you without delay. 11. My beloved, rejoyce in the Lord, and take heed of them that are desirous after filthy Lucre. 12. Let your Prayers be manifest unto God, and remainfirm in the knowledge of Christ. 13. And do that which is meet, convenient, just, and reasonable; and what you have heard and recei∣ved, that keep in your hearts, so shall you have praise. 14. The Grace of God, and our Lord Jesus Christ be with your Spirits, Amen. Col. 4.16 This Epistle of Paul to the Lao∣diceans, was found in the oldest Bible that was Printed at Worms. To the Bowed in Spirit, under Sin. DOst thou still feel in thy heart, reproofs for Sin, Be of good courage, for God hath not yet forsaken thee, therefore obey the reproof of in∣struction (in thy heart) for it is the way to everlast∣ing Life with God for ever, Isa. 30.21. John 16.6. To the hardned in Evil. Canst thou Swear, Lye, Cheat, break thy Promise, oppress the Innocent; or commit A∣dultery; and feels no sharp reproofs for any of them in thy Conscience, then art thou in a mise∣rable
condition, and it's to be feared that God hath cast the Reins of the Bridle on thy neck, and given thee up to thy own hearts Lust, which is thy portion; because of thy so often provoking of the Lord by thy Rebellion against his good Spirit, that he has left thee to hardness of heart, as he did Pharoah, never to escape everlasting vengeance without a timely, and speedy Re∣pentance in Dust and Ashes, before thou go hence, believing that all things are possible with God; though thy sins were as Scarlet, &c. Isa. 1.18. & 55, 6, 7, 8. If thou turns unto him with all thy heart. An Advertisement of Love. THey that burn in Effigie the Person of the Pope, and also the Person of a Pres∣byter (after the same manner) with a short Cloak, diminutive band, &c. are all Christians of one size, or nominal Christians, being far from loving of Enemies, as Christ commands, of whom they would take the name Christian, but wants the nature of that Love, that will o∣vercome Enemies, which Love will certainly o∣vercome, if all called Christians, would seek Gods Glory, and not the exaltation of self in this world, and put their trust in God alone for deliverance, saying with the three Children unto
the King, We are not careful to answer thee in this matter, behold the God whom we serve is able to deliver us, but if not, be it known to thee O King, that we will not serve thy Gods, &c. Dan. 3.17. For he that knows not God, knows not what God he Worshipeth, so may compel to the Worship of an unknown God. See the Mock-procession of the 17th day of November, and the Royal Intel. Number 30. Common-Prayer-Book; of good things therein, if truly minded. 1. See Good-Friday, the Collect, so called; Almighty and everlasting God, by whose Spirit, the whole Body of the Church is govern'd and Sanctified, 2 Thes. 2.13. Observe, By this it is declared that they only are of the Church of God, that are governed and sanctified by the Spirit of God, so that all that are so governed, go to the Church, and Worship God according to the said Common-Prayer, being the Church is in God the Pillar, and ground of Truth, 1 Tim. 2.15. Colos. 1.24. 2. The Coll. 3d Sunday after Easter gives a clear testimony to the (Light) that God shew∣eth to all men that be in error. Observe, do not those that believe that this (Light) in every man, is not sufficient to
lead out of error, believe contrary to the Com∣mon-Prayer? John 1.9, 3, 19, 20, 21. 3. Collect 5th Sunday after Easter, that is a Prayer for the inspiration of Gods Holy Spirit, to cleanse the thoughts of the Heart, and to think those things that be good. Observe, How do they own the Common-Prayer-Book, that in these days make a mock at Inspiration, and say it is ceased? Job 32.8. 4. And that good Prayer, which is said often, but little practised, said on St. Stephens Day; Grant us O Lord to learn to love our Enemies, by the example of thy Martyr St. Stephen, who prayed for his Persecuters? &c. Observe, Now what People lives and walks nearest the life of the words of the Common-Prayer-Book, let the witness for God (against all sin) in every heart be the Judge (a Tree being to be known by its Fruit, Mat. 12.33.) For some People are so far from loving Ene∣mies, that they persecute their Friends, because they go not to a Church, so called, made of Stone, Acts 7.48. when the Common-Prayer-Book doth not require it, it being sufficient to be of that Church, that the Members thereof are governed and sanctified by the Spirit of God, and also because they cannot in good Consciences pay tyths of the encrease of their Lands Labour, and sweat of their brows, being that the tenths, or tyths to the Priesthood is disannulled by Christ Jesus, Heb. 7. For Christs
Ministers receive temporal things, only of those that freely give, Mat. 10.8. And having by their Ministry planted a Vine-yard, may eat the Fruit thereof, but not make the Gospel charge∣able, 1 Cor. 2.18, 27. For forced maintenance has caused most of the Divisions, and strivings in the Nations, for possession, John 18.36. Lastly, And to persecute those, that cannot break Christs Command (nor teach others so to do, Mat. 5.19.) that is to say Swear not at all Mat. 5, 33, 34, 55, 36, 37. James 5.12. For be∣cause of swearing the Land mourns, Jer. 23.10. Neither hath Oaths been of safety to any Ma∣gistrate or People, as appeareth by the late times, by swearing to and again as Govern∣ments have altered, for he that will Lye, mat∣ters not an Oath (except to keep favour with his Party) and he that breaks his yea or nay (a Christian-bond) ought to suffer as much, as he that breaks his Oath, the Sin being the same in the sight of God, Mat. 5.19. James 2.10. See T. Godwyns Civil & Eccless. Rites, Lib. 4. Cap. 10. Wherein he sheweth many of the unwarrantable Heathenish customs that the Jews borrowed of the Heathens; several of which, the Christians (so called) have imita∣ted since; yet we see the goodness of God, that he more and more is bringing People out of outside formality, into the inward life and power of Godliness, with himself, from those that are setled in Mans Traditions (who cry, lo
here is the way, lo there is the way (in some outward observation) when Christ Jesus saith; Behold the Kingdom of God is within you; Luk. 18.21. And saith Paul, for the Kingdom of God is not Meat nor Drink, but Righteousness and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost, Rom. 14.17. And he (Christ Jesus) said unto them, Will ye reject the Commandment of God, that ye may ob∣serve your own Tradition, Mark 7.9. Mat. 15.9. Will you compel People to your Tradition, of Swearing, when God has Commanded not to swear at all, Mat. 5.33, 34, 35, 36, 37. James 5.12. Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least Commandments, and teach men so, he shall be called the least, &c. Mat. 5.19. And moreover saith our Saviour, Observe all things, whatsoever I have Commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, unto the end of the world, Mat. 28.20. And as Chrysostom, and others say, for what end wilt thou force him to Swear, whom thou be∣lievest not that he will speak the truth? and se∣veral Martyrs have born a testimony against all Oaths, &c. And the Martyrs in and before Queen Maries days, did also bear a Testimony against Oaths, as Walter Brute, (and others) he held that it is not lawful for Christians, for any cause, in any case, to swear by the Creator, neither the Crea∣ture, in his last Testimony against the Pope and Church of Rome. See Act. Mon. vol. 1. fol.
653. so that those Protestants that practise swearing, are out of the Life of the Apostles, and Martyrs of Jesus, though they be garnish∣ing the Sepulchres of the Righteous, (like the Jews the Prophets) Printing and Re-printing their Labours, although in Life and Practise as contrary to them, as Light is to Darkness; for in Christ Jesus, it is neither being of this or the other Religious Opinion, going to Church, or Meeting, or not going, taking Bread and Wine, or not taking Bread and Wine, Baptizing with Water, or not Baptizing with Water, Cir∣cumcision, or Uncircumcision availeth any thing, but A NEW CREATURE, Gal. 6.15. (without God shall by his Spirit require any outward Practice) And as many as walk accord∣ing to this rule, (of the NEW CREATURE) peace shall be upon them, and Mercy, and upon the Israel of God. ver. 16. For thus saith he, that is high and excellent, he that inhabiteth the Eternity, whose name is the Holy One, I dwell in the high and holy places, with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and to give Life to them that are of a contrite Spirit. Isa. 57.15. Psal. 34.18.51.17. Oh, that all People would bring their Lives and Practices to be tried by Christs Sermon upon the Mount! Matth. 5, 6, and 7. Chap.
An Experiment of Bees. How to take some Honey from each Stock of Bees yearly, or to double them, which may be called an artificial Swarm, if the year comes not very bad for gathering of Honey. 1st. GET strong straw Hives made, but not too big, let them be almost flat at the top, to set one upon another conveniently, let each Hive have a round hole on the top, a∣bout one Inch and a half over, dress them as for a swarm, and they are ready. 2dly, Cut a natch on the back of the Bee-stool, about 5 or 6 Inches long, and 2 over, with a shutter, like a bread gratter, to draw in and out, to see the strength of your Bees by the light of the door, let not the Sun shine on the Hives, except about the door. 3dly, About May-day (so called) set those new Hives upon the Bees-stools, under each stock of Bees that is not poor, clay up the edge of the stocks to the new Hives, that a Bee pass not out, except at the Door of the new Hives. 4thly, About the middle of June, see if they have half filled the new Hives, which if they
have, choose a warm morning, as when Bees are apt to lie out, and take off one stock, and give it a shake, that some Bees may drop out, and carry it a pole or two, and clay it up, and let it work till the middle of August to be smo∣thered or saved for store; then return to the new Hive, and with a piece of Tile cover the top hole, and clay it well, and brush off the Bees with Hysop, and cover the Hive. 5thly, If they have not half filled the lower Hive, by the middle of June, then let them so stand and work till the middle of August, and then take the Honey in the new Hive, and save the Bees alive; after this manner choose a clear cool morning, (having the night before taken some clay from between the Hives to cool them) take off both the Hives together and set them on the grass, and immediately take the Stock off the new Hive, and set it on the Stool again; then take up the new Hive and shake out some of the Bees, and if there be Bees enough in the Stock, smother the Bees in the new Hive; but if you had rather save them all alive, carry the Hive into some secret Place, cover it with straw, being turned upside down, and many will out, re∣move your place, and take fresh Straw twice or thrice, and they will most go home; but if you would save all the Bees, carry the Hive into a Chamber, (having before opened the top of the window all along) and brush the Bees off the Combs, and they will fly to the Window, and
so out and home, and the Hony will be Virgins Hony, so called: But to arm your selves to do this work, make a thin bagg to put thy head in, and tie it about the neck, having first sow∣ed in a piece of a Weavers slee, for sight and breath. I have taken above two hundred pounds of Hony out of seven Stocks, in one year, besides the seven new ones. Note, that if the year comes very good for Bees, and they have half filled their lower Hive by the first of June, (and good store of Bees) you may set then another under the se∣cond and first, &c. and then take the Stock, or Over-Hive for use, at the middle of August, and get the Bees out as before. Note, In driving of Bees out of the Combs, (as aforesaid) take the Hive off gently; for if you knock it, so that any Hony happen to get out of the Combs, the Bees Wings will be smeared with Hony, so that they will not go out of them∣selves, do what you can, which if it so happen, take it into a private place amongst the grass, (being a Sunshiny day) and take out Comb af∣ter Comb, brush the Bees on the grass, and lay the Combs in a dish, (often removing your places) and the drowned Bees, with the Hive, set near the other Bees, for a general Feast, and they will cleanse the smeared Bees, and it may be they may go home to their new Hive.
Memorandums. 1. LAy salt on the stool, and ashes on the Crown once a year. 2. Dress the stools in February. 3. Feed them but in April with wet Sugar, if rainy weather come. 4. The Queen Bee is often found on the ground under a Hive of two swarms, and after the last swarm. 5. Bees age scarce two years. 6. Help them to kill the Drones in July, or at other times, to prevent swarming. 7. June the best Month for Bees. 8. They breed most in wet weather, and al∣most all Summer. 9. When they cast out young white Bees, the stock is good. 10. Take no Hony before August. 11. Remove Bees in January, and to carry them many Miles, wrap a Cloath about them, and turn them upside down on Straw in a Cart. 12. To try to make them swarm, lay stink∣ing weeds under them that they lie not out, but above the door, and the Sun shine not on them but at the door; if this do not make them swarm, rare them two Inches, and they often swarm in two or three days after; do this about the middle of June.
13. In swarming time have a Hive ready drest, to place at their settling, and they often go in of themselves. 14. If a swarm is going home again, cover all your stocks with sheets, and place a drest Hive for them. 15. Set not a swarm too near the commen hiving place. 16. One swarm being hived, cover it, if ano∣ther is rising. 17. If a swarm hangs on several boughs, get them together quickly. 18. If two swarms hangs near, or together, shake half into one Hive, and cover it with a cloath, and carry it a Pole off, and when they have taken to the Hive, cover it, and hive the other part of the Bees. 19. Two swarms together most commonly fight till one Queen Bee be killed. 20. Take up the best and the worst. 21. One good swarm is enough out of one stock in one year. 22. Set each stock with their doors almost East, and 3 foot asunder. 23. If a swarm gets into a hollow Tree, stop them up, and bore a hole under them, to let in the smoak of burnt Cow dung, and open the other hole for them to flie out. 24. If Robbers come, shut the Bees up close at night, and before, to one Bee, with Tin having holes in it, and kill the Robbers in the morn∣ing;
but if crumbs of Wax come down, smo∣ther them at night, and take the Hony, and set the Hive in its place again, and place a piece of Whalebone long ways at the door, that the Robbers can put by to get in, but not out. To know whether they be your Neighbours Bees, take notice which way they pass at Sunset, and after, and you may know. 25. Keep Grass smooth near the Bees. 26. The Bees will choose to go in and out at the East side of their Hives, if nothing be in their way. 27. Let the Bee stools be but little wider than the Hive, and rising in the middle, then the rain will not beat under them, which causeth vermine to breed; let a board be nailed to the edge of the Stool, about 10 Inches square, slopewise for the Bees to settle and rest on, when they come home laden. 28. For Capes or covering for a Bee Hive, take half a sheaf of Rye straw, bind it in the middle with a string, like unto a Faggot, then turn the ends both ways like a Cake, and set it on a Hive, and cut it round, on which lay a two penny earthen pan, and heavy stones on the pan. 29. A swarm this year is most likely to give a swarm the next year, the older the stock is, the lother they are to swarm, for the most part, after the second year of a swarms age, set them double as before is taught.
30. To make doors to set under the edge of each Bee Hive, take a piece of Sallow; or Wil∣low of about one Inch square, and 6 or 7 Inches long, then cut away about 4 or 5 Inches in the middle at one side, that Bees may easily pass under it, (but not a Mouse, nor a House Snail,) then cut a natch long ways with a Saw, for a shutter of the same Wood to slip too and fro, that but one Bee can pass out all Winter, or when robbing Bees come, and to slip full open in May, June and July. 31. When you are minded to kill Bees, make a great round Hole in the ground, (at the middle of August) set a match of Brown paper upon a short stick, of 2 Inches square, dipt in Brimstone, being well lighted set the Bees there∣on, and put the loose earth about the Hive, knocking the Hive a little. 32. The Bees being dead, cut the finest of the Combs into a Sieve that stands over, a pan, and bruise them a little, so let them stand two days, the first Hony, that you pour out of the Pan is the best, the Combs in the Sieve you may either make Mead with washing them, or get the Hony out by putting the Sieve into an Oven, after the Bread is drawn, and it will be pretty good Hony; and for the worst of the Combs, soak them in Water, with them that come out of the Oven, and brew it with some Malt, and drink it in a little time; three pound of Hony is one quart.
33. Melt the Wax in water, and press it out strongly, then melt it in fair water, and skim it clean, then cover it with cloaths till it is cold, that the Wax Cake crack not. Common-ground, the Poors Right more than the Rich. IT is a sad age in which we live, that rich, earthly minded men should seek to keep the poor people always very poor. The Cattle upon the thousands of Hills are mine, saith the Lord, which God intended for the poor, as well as others, even for a general good; And besides the large Common-grounds in England the Rich keep from the Poor, in a great measure, which properly is their right, or so much thereof, to keep their Families from want, but not to live in idleness; for some Christian spirited people did, in former ages, give Land as common un∣to the Poor; but we too often see, how that Rich men by force take it from them, That many Lords of Towns, so called, and other rich Commoners, had rather hinder themselves (in some things,) that they may lord it over the poor, and hinder a general Improvement of Land, than to benefit the poor, by letting
them enclose a small part of a Common, to maintain their Families, (though the poor may have friends raised to give the value of it in Mony;) but are rather for having a Law to maintain them very poorly by collections; whenas the Poor might improve Common∣ground for a general good, and pay taxes. Such oppression on the poor, is no fruit of a Christian Spirit, which is to do unto the poor as they would be dealt with, if they were in the poors condition; The Nation being big e∣nough to maintain ten times as many people (I suppose) as are now in it, by a Christian In∣dustry, and the Laws put in execution against Drunkenness, and other the abuses of good things, the which is of the greatest concern, that the Magistrats ought to look after: And the Poor, as well as others, ought to learn the A∣postle Paul's Lesson, that is, to be content in all conditions, which Paul said he had learned, Philip. 4.11. Then will none of the poor in a contentious angry Spirit, strive to get in ground enclosed from the Common, but rather patient∣ly wait upon God, until he shall be pleased to open the hearts of men in outward Power, to grant them their Birth-right, and to become sharers with them of the Earth, (that all may seek a General Good, and not so much for a pri∣vate Interest;) then will there be a Blessing up∣on all their Labours, so as none covet to have more than is needful, to spend it upon their
Lusts and pleasures; for which Sin, the Crea∣tor of the Heavens and the Earth, doth and will more and more send his Judgments upon the Inhabitants of the Earth, except they spee∣dily repent by yielding obedience to the Grace of God in their hearts, which will not consent to one Sin. Exod. 23.6. Prov. 22.22.23.16.29.14. Rob not the poor, because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in Judgment; for the Lord will defend their cause, and spoil the Soul of those that spoil them. Thou shalt not overthrow the right of the poor in his sute. A King that judgeth the poor in truth, his Throne shall be established for ever. There are multitudes of Examples to be gi∣ven, that shew the wonderful Mercy and Love of God, to such as have been assistant to the Poor, which hard hearted men take little notice of; but for brevities sake, I shall but mention one remarkable passage, as I found it in Richard Burton's Historical Remarques, p. 63. Printed for Nath. Crouch at the Bell in Exchange-Alley, London. In the Reign of K. Henry the Third, was a great famine in England, about the year 1245, whereby the Poor miserably perished for want of Bread. The Authors of those times relate this story very credibly, to shew how displeasing Unmercifulness and want of Charity is in the sight of God; several poor People plucked the Ears of Corn, while they were green in the Common fields, meerly to keep themselves from starving, at which the owners
being much offended, desired the Priest of the Parish to curse and excommunicate them all the next Sunday: But one of the Company adju∣red the Priest in the name of God, to exempt his Corn from the Sentence, saying, That it pleased him well, that the poor being pinched with Famine, had taken his Corn; and so commended what was left to the blessing of God. The Priest being compelled by the im∣portunity of others, had no sooner begun the Sentence, but a sudden Tempest of Thunder, Lightning, Wind, Hail, and Rain, interrupt∣ed him, whereby all the Corn fields therea∣bout were laid waste and destroyed, as if they had been trodden under Foot with Cart and Horses; yea, no kind of Fowl nor Beast would feed upon it: But this honest, tender hearted man found all his Corn and Ground, though mingled among others, altogether untouched, and without the least harm. Prov. 14.31. He that oppresseth the poor, reproacheth his Maker; but he that honoureth him, hath mercy on the poor. Those may be said to rob the poor, as throw down Cottages, by taking the Commons from them, making great Parks to keep Deer and other Cattle, &c. (laying house to house, and field to field, that neither work nor place may be left for the poor, Isa. 5.8.) And enclosing whole Parishes in England, in these few years, whereby the poor have been forced to remove and lose their right; but many such Great
men have come to want for so doing, God hav∣ing blasted their Estates, and have felt God's Judgments for the same; (I shall forbear to name the Persons.) The same blasting hath also come upon many, that have bought up corn in times of scarcity, to withold it from the poor by great prices, which is well known to many in this year 1681. as in ages past; And do not they also rob the poor, that take away the Gleanings of the Grain in the common fields from the poor, whether it be by the Farmer, or such others as are not really poor; But some may say, Who are the poor that thou writes of? I Answer, He or she that hath nothing but wear∣ing Apparel, and he that hath a Wife, or a Wife and Children, and works hard for 8 d. or 10 d. a day, and hath not above 60 l. value in Land or Money. Lev. 19.9, 10. When ye reap the harvest of your Land, (saith the Lord) ye shall not reap every corner of your field, neither shalt thou ga∣ther the Gleanings of thy harvest: But thou shalt leave them for the poor, and Fatherless, and Stranger; I am the Lord your God. Matth. 5.3. Blessed are the poor in Spirit; for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, saith our Saviour Christ. Therefore whosoever first seeks the Kingdom of Heaven, all other things shall be added. Matth. 6.33. Psal. 37.16, and 25. I have been young, (saith David) and now am old; yet I have not seen the Righteous for∣saken, nor his seed begging Bread. Notwithstand∣ing I once heard a Priest interpret it, though his seed begging Bread.
Four great Works of a Tyrant. 1. To destroy the good. 2. To hate the Poor. 3. To extol the evil. 4. To root out the virtuous. Colouring in Oil to preserve the Dial-Boards. MAle the Dial Boards of Quartered wood that they warp not, then take about a Pint of Lintseed Oil, and put to it an ounce of the Litharg of Gold, heat it in a Pot till it al∣most boil, and stir it often, and it is fit for use; then grind a little Red lead on a Grinding Glo∣vers stone, with some of this Oil, but very thin of the Lead, brush over your Dial-board 2 or 3 times, letting it dry after every time of the doing of it. Lastly, wash it with White Lead so ground, as often as you please; and for the
Hour-lines, and Figures, or Letters, work the said Oil with Lam-black; but if you would have Golden Figures or Letters, do thus: Take yellow Oker, and White Lead, and with the said Oil grind it, lay some of this on the figures in the morning, and at night lay thereon Leaf-Gold, crush it on with Cotten, and when it's dry, black the edges of the Fi∣gures to make them smooth. To sodder Iron. SET the joints of Iron, as Close you can, lay them in a glowing fire, and take of Venice glass in pouder, and the Iron being red hot, cast the pouder thereon, and take it out gently to cool. Chops in the Skin. TAke Capons grease mixt with Camphire, or Oil of Roses mixt with Sheeps suet, anoint the place, and wrap it up, at nights.
To make red Ink. TAke small Brasil one Ounce, white Lead and Allum of each two Drachms, Gum Arabick 8 scruples, Urine one pint, shake them often together; it's good to rule Bibles and some other Books with. Wars and Fightings not to be by Christians. 1. CHrist commands, that we love our E∣nemies; but War on the contrary teacheth us to hate and destroy them, Matth. 5.44. 2. Christ said that his Kingdom is not of this World, and therefore that his servants should not fight; therefore those that fight, are not his servants. Joh. 18.36. 3. Because he reproved Peter for the use of
the Sword, saying, Matth. 26.52. Put up again thy Sword into his place; for all they that take the Sword shall perish with the Sword. Concerning which Tertullian speaks well, Lib. de Idol.How shall he fight in peace without a Sword, which the Lord did take away? For although Soul∣diers came to John, and received a form of Observation, if also the Centurion believed af∣terwards, he disarmed every Souldier in dis∣arming of Peter. Idem de Coro. Mil. asketh, Shall it be lawful to use the Sword, the Lord saying, that he that useth the Sword, shall pe∣rish by the Sword? See R. Barclay's Apologies pag. 402. The Word, You, to no more than one Person, how it begun. WItnessed by John Maresius, of the French Academy, in the Preface of his Clovis. Let none wonder (saith he) that the word [Thou] is used in this work to Princes and Princesses; for we use the same to God: And of old the same was used to Alexanders, Ce∣sars, Queens, and Empresses. The use of the
word [You] when one is spoken to, was only in∣troduced by these base flatteries of men of lat∣ter ages, to whom it seemed good to use the plural number to one person, that he may ima∣gine himself alone to be equal to many others in dignity and worth, from whence at last it came to persons of lower quality.
Law Terms, a few with Advice. FEoffour, is one that granteth a deed of Land. Feoffee, is he to whom it is made. Donour, is he that giveth Land in Tayl. Donee, is he to whom it is given. Lessour, is he that granteth a Lease. Lessee, is he that taketh it. Plaintiff, is he that begins the Suit. or Defendant, is he that answereth him. or Fee-simple, is Land holden to a Mans Heirs and Assigns for ever, but if the Man dies without Issue, or Will, it falls to the next of Kin. Fee-tayle, a Tenant in Tayl-General, is where Lands are given to a Man, and to his Heirs of his Body, and a Tenant in Tayl-Special, is Land given unto a Man and his Wife, and the Heirs of their two Bodies begotten. Three Brothers, the youngest purchase in Fee-simple, and dyeth without Issue or Will, it falls to the eldest Brother by descent, &c. To purchase Land to him and his Assigns for ever, this is but for Life. Fealty, is an Oath taken at the admittance of a Tenant, to be true to the Lord of the Mannor. Knights-Service, is to bear Arms for the Lord. Fee-farm, is Land holden to Mans Heirs for ever under a Rent.
Chattels, are Goods moveable, and immovea∣ble, and are called a Mans personal Estate. Real-Estate, are a mans Lands. Replevy, is bringing of a Writ called replegiari facias, to gain his Cattel, and putting in surety to the Sheriff, and Sue. Fine, is a formal conveyance of Land by ac∣knowledging a perfect agreement (more es∣pecially of a Married Woman) before a Judge, or other Commissioners. Copy-hold, is a tenure, that the Tenant holds Lands by Copy of the Court Rolls, made by the Steward at his Lords Court, this in some places is a base tenure. Extent, Commissions the Sheriff to seize and value Lands of one, who being bound by the Statute, &c. Hath forfeited his Bond. Recovery, is the obtaining of Lands by Judg∣ment, or Tryal at Law, and of intailed E∣states. Statute-Merchant, and Statute-Staple, is a Bond made between Debter and Creditor, in form of a Statute, and acknowledged before a Mayor, or Chief-Warden of a City, and 2 Merchants assigned therefore. Collaterall Security, is over and above the deed or lease. Lease-parole, is letting of Lands by word of mouth. Bargains, of above 10 l. value, should be under Hand and Seal.
If Husband and Wife purchase Land together in Fee, the Husband may sell the Land with∣out the Wives leave, Hen. 21. El. 3.6. There∣fore its best for the Woman to have trustees. Curtesie of England. He that Marries a Wife, that hath free I and and she dyeth, and leaveth a Child that's heard once to cry, and dyeth, he shall have the use of the Land during his Life, other∣wise not. All the Land that a Man hath, or shall purchase in Fee during his Life, having a Wife, and he die, his Wife shall have the 3 d of the profits of all; though he might have sold some in his Life-time, except she did acknowledge a Fine, or he held it joyntly with another. No Man is bound to accuse himself, by the Law of England, (viz.) Magna Charta 28 Edw. 3. Cap. 3. Item, That no Man of what estate or condition that he be, shall be put out of Land or Tene∣ment, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor disin∣herited, nor put to death without being brought in answer by due process of the Law. Note that Free-hold, is Goods and Chattels, as well as Lands and Tenements, Cooks In∣stit. 29.46. None under the Age of 21 years, can sue in his own Name; Males and Females of 14 years
old, may be bound in Bonds or Covenants, for necessaries, as Food, Raiment, Schooling, Instructions, and Marriage, &c. Bonds hold ever in force, till cancelled, or cut off by Hand and Seal. Lands may be passed ten manner of ways. As by Fine, Recovery, Feoffment, Grant Lease, Bargain and Sale, Exchange Surrender, Re∣lease and Confirmation, and by Will, but not by word of Mouth. Children may be Executors. If a Man dies without Will, or a Will not wit∣nessed by 3 or 4 Witnesses, the eldest Son will have all his Lands, his Children half the Goods, and his Wife the other half; if no Children, then his Wife to have half the Goods, and his next of Kin the other half. Men under 14, and Women under 12 years of Age, cannot make Wills of Land, but above that Age may of moveable Goods. An Administrators Power is equal to an Exe∣cutor, and are bound to pay his Debts by speciality according to the value of the Goods, 51 Ed. Cap. 11. Arbitrators cannot Judge of Fellonies, Trea∣sons, Marriages, and Criminal offences against the King or Commonwealth.
Parties may revoke (though not honestly) if they are not bound by Bond to get the Parties to Seal releases to each other, and some mony from one of them, before they see the Award is the best way to make them Friends, 2 Hen. 6.18 & 19. So that he that is not willing to refer all Perso∣nal trespasses to Arbitrators, Elected, and Chosen by the Parties, and stand to their A∣ward (but rather go to Law) is accounted an unreasonable man.

Of the Idol Moloch, to whom the Jews sacrificed their Children. Lev. 18.21. IN the valley Hinnon, not far from Jerusalem, the Jews set up an Idol of Copper, like a King, which they called Moloch, that is, a King of Idols. This Copper Idol stood with the Arms stretching out, and under it was a great fire; whereby the Image shewed fire-red; and be∣sides that, the more to honour it, they made a great fire between two Walls, which burnt for his sake; and through this fire the Idolatrous Priests cast living Children into Moloch's burn∣ing Arms, which he with his Arms red hot burnt to Death. And in this manner the Jews offered their own Children to the Idol Moloch, and when they did it, they made a great noise and cry, and beat upon a Drum, that the Fa∣thers, when their Children were offered, should not hear them cry, by reason of the great noise of the Drum; and therefore Christ likened this valley of Hinnon to Hell fire, saith the Margent to Matth. 5 chap. The Israelites were forbidden to offer their Children to it. Lev. 18.21. upon pain of death, chap. 20.2, 3, 4, 5. It was destroyed by Josiah,  Kin. 23.10.
Feasts that Christ allows of, but contrary to Dives's Feasts, Luke 16.19, 26. THen said Jesus, when thou makest a Din∣ner or Supper, call not thy Friends, nor thy Brethren, neither thy Kinsmen, nor thy rich Neighbours, lest they also bid the again, and a recompence be made thee. But when thou makest a Feast, call the poor, the maim∣ed, the lame, the blind, and thou shalt be blessed, for they cannot recompence thee; bu thou shalt be recompenced at the Resurrection of the Just. Luk. 14.12, 13, 14. Who, of the rich of this Worlds Goods, takes Christ's Coun∣sel in this matter? So that by the vanity tha follows most feastings in these days, we may say as the Preacher once said, Eccles. 7.2. That  is better to go to the House of Mourning, than to th House of Feasting.
Apparel, and Furniture, the excess therein not to be amongst Christi∣ans, and the poor wants. I will therefore, (saith the Apostle Paul) that Women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety, not with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or costly array; but (which be∣cometh Women professing Godliness) with good works, 1 Tim. 2.9, 10. And, saith the Apostle Peter, let not your adorning be in that outward adorning of platting the Hair, and of wearing of Gold, or of put∣ting on of Apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible, even the Orna∣ment of a weak and quiet Spirit, which is in the sight of God, of great price. 1 Pet. 3.3, 4. For all that is in the World, the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World. 1 Joh. 2.16. Now from whence proceeds the excess in Apparel and Furniture, (in things that are of no service) but from the Lust of the Eye, and the pride of Life, &c. Jam. 2.1, 2. Respecting such as come in platted Hair, or wears Gold or costly array, by such as profess themselves to be Christians, and say that the Scripture is their Rule, when they walk
quite contrary, even to that excess amongst some people, that the expences thereof might maintain six times as many poor people as I suppose is now in England: If the Scripture was their Rule, they would observe the same charge that Paul gave unto Timothy, saying, Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain Riches, but in the li∣ving God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, 1 Tim. 6.17, 18. for the poors relief. Days all to be kept holy unto the Lord, by ceasing from sin. THe Apostle Paul saith, Let no man con∣demn you, in respect of meats and drink, or of an Holy-day, or of the New-Moons, or of the Sab∣bath days, which are but shadows of things to come; but the Body is Christ. Col. 2 16. Now those that are come to the Substance Christ Jesus, the e∣verlasting Sabbath of rest, and are ceased from sin, and keeps every day holy unto the Lord I say such are persecuted by those that rest still in the shadows, or rather short of those forme shadows, who now observe days, and times, cal∣ling
them Holy-days, and instead of keeping a day holy unto the Lord, too many keep them to themselves, in sports, games, and other va∣nities; For, saith the Apostle Paul, he that re∣gardeth not the day, to the Lord be doth not regard it. Rom. 1.4.6. Yet do most, now called Christi∣ans, approve of one day in seven for publick Worship, the first day of the Week, being con∣venient for a day of rest, also for labouring men and Cattle; but the Sabbath day of the Jews was kept on the seventh day of the Week, called now by some people Saturday. A Character of a True Christian. 1st. HIS daily care is to keep his mind stayed upon God, that he may be kept in perfect peace, Isa. 26.3. And through God's Grace he is taught to deny Ungodliness and worldly Lusts. Tit. 2.11, 12. and to be sober, righteous, patient, humble, meek, up∣right, merciful, forbearing, forgiving, peace∣able, gentle, self-denying, constant, faithful, holy, and also temperate in meat, drink, appa∣rel, &c. which are the fruits of the Spirit, or Grace of God in his Conscience. James 2 chap. 2dly, He is come out of the works of dark∣ness,
and the fruits of the Flesh, Rom. 1.  4.31. and 5 ch. Gal. 5. That is, he is not wanton, or passionate, or proud, covetous, or a back∣biter, or envious, wrathful, unmerciful, re∣vengeful, prophane, drunken, voluptuous or unclean, nor makes Religion a Cloak for self-in∣terest, or for Loaves. 3dly, He will consent to any righteous thing, for a general good in the Parish where he dwells, or elsewhere, that the poorer sort may be help∣ed, or others his Neighbours, and is at all times willing to relieve the needy, according to his ability, 1 Tim. 6.18. 4thly, He always is ready to endeavour for peace amongst people, or when controversie arise amongst his Neighbours, he will seek to them in a Christian way, for them to refe themselves for peace sake to persons, chosen by them, to end their differences, and not go to Law, believing that they are accounted unrea∣sonable men that will not so end their diffe∣rences, Matth. 5.9. 1 Cor. 6.1. Lastly, He is always willing to submit to th outward Governours of the Nation wherein h dwells, or patiently suffer under them, if the require any thing that's against God's Law  his Conscience. Act. 5.29. And of him that t∣keth away his Goods (for the Law of his God
he will not ask them again. Luk. 6.30. But if this true Christian be an absenter from the Na∣tional Church (so called,) then the outside Christians do call His Gravity, Sullenness; His Seriousness, Melancholy; His Silence, Sottishness; His Diligence, Covetousness; His Christian-suffering, Obstinacy; His plainness in Apparel, Singularity; His proper Speech, Rudeness; His Scripture-Language, Canting; His Sobriety, a cheat for Custom; His being at a Word, a decoy for Trade; His Industry, Worldly-mindedness; His Hospitality, Flesh-pleasingness. In short, such true Christians have been impri∣soned, because they cannot take up Arms, and also for fear they should; and if they answer their Adversaries, they say it's Nonsense, or Equivocation, so that his Virtues are accounted Vice, by such Professors as delight only in the form of Godliness, more than the power there∣of. After this manner the Papist used to dis∣approve of the Sobriety of the Waldenses, of whom Reinerius, a Popish Author, so writ∣eth: Now the Protestants of the National Church make use of the name of these suffering Walden∣ses, to help to plead for their antiquity, equal
with the Papists, that is, from the Apos time; which makes them never the truerri∣stians, considering the great Apostasie, that first spoiled the simplicity of Truth, and keep∣ing up the Heathenish Learning and Traditions of men, Col. 2.8, 20. Yet did God here and there raise Witnesses for the Truth, (in all this dark night) who, for the most part, were per∣secuted by them that upheld the shell of Religi∣on, or outward Ceremonies, and neglected the substance (God's spirits teaching in their hearts) as at this day. So that if this good Spirit of God was but truly obeyed, it would lead people to be Wit∣nesses (in measure) of the Saints condition, re∣corded in the holy Scripture, experimentally, (for imitation of the Saints practices, before God's Spirit lead in each heart, has been, and is the door of Apostasie.) Man in his own Strength and Wisdom, hath been too apt to do and act (as to Worship) that which God doth not require or command him, Deut. 5.32. Isa. 1.12. That the Lord said, Matth. 15.9. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men. Now Reader, if thy desire is to be truly led, to build upon no other Foundation, besides the (Rock) Christ Jesus, mark well these Scrip∣tures following, and the Lord give thee an o∣bedient Heart, viz. For the wrath of God is re∣vealed from Heaven against all ungodliness, and un∣riteousness
of men, who hold the Truth in unrighte∣ousness: Because that which may be known in God, is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them: But unto every one of us is given Grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ; for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God: But the anointing which ye have received of him, a∣bideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lye, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide. We have also a more sure Word of Prophesie, where∣unto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the Day-Star arise in your hearts. 2 Pet. 1.19. Rom. 1.18, 19.8.14.10.6, 7, 8. Heb. 8.10, 12. Eph. 4.7. At that time Jesus answered, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes. Matth. 11.25. 1 Cor. 1.27, 29. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the World to confound the wise, and God hath cho∣sen the weak things of the World to confound the things which are mighty: That no flesh should glory in his pre∣sence. 1 Cor. 4.18, 19. Let no man deceive himself: If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise; For the Wis∣dom of this World is foolishness with God, &c. These things are as a sealed Book to all the Wit, Learning, Study, and mans reason, until
he come to bow his mind to the measure e Spirit, or Grace of God in his own heart, om whence these Scriptures (with others) were gi∣ven forth. For the Scripture is given by Inspiration of God, &c. 2 Tim. 3.16. For what knoweth the things of a man, save the Spirit of a man, which is in him, even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. But he that is spiritual discerneth all things, &c. 1 Cor. 2.11, 14, 15. For to be carnally mind∣ed is Death, but to be spiritually minded is Life and Peace; Rom. 8.6. Gal. 5.16.6.5. This I say then, walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the Lusts of the Flesh: For every man shall bear his own burthen. James 4.17. Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is sin. Prov. 18.10. The Name of the Lord is a strong, Tower, the Righteous runneth into it and is safe. Veritati adhaereto. Stick to the Truth.
Ʋniformity in Religion; how at∣tainable, according to true Christiani∣ty; and also something of the fruits of Imposition upon Conscience, for religi∣ous Opinions. Humbly submitted to the consideration of Su∣periours, By William Mather. WHereas it is pro∣fessed by all the Professors of Christianity, at this day, that the way and manner of their Religions, or Opi∣nions, is according, and not contrary to the Scrip∣ture of Truth. Now to create peace a∣mongst all the Churches, and to unite in harmless Love, that they may all build (only) upon the (Rock) Christ Jesus, Mat. 7.25. If it shall please God
so to open the Eyes of the Magistrates in every place (by his Grace in their hearts, the sure foundation, Eph. 2.8.) to so order it, That the Minister or Teach∣er, in each Congregation for Worship, shall read the holy Scriptures (only) unto their hearers, all waiting upon God in his fear, to worship him in Spirit and in Truth. John 4.24. So that if any thing be revealed by Gods Spirit (by way of Interpretation, Edification, or Prayer) to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. 1 Cor. 14.30, 31, 32. So will God be in the midst of those that are thus gathered together in his Name. Matth. 18.20. so as none (in Man's Wisdom speak,) but only as God's Spirit shall give utterance, though it be through the least Member (accounted of) in the Church. 1 Pet. 4.10.
or what confusion and bshed hath come upon the World, for several ages, by reason of mans setting up ways of Wor∣ship, Articles of faith, &c. when our Saviour hath al∣ready done it, Matth. the 5, 6, and 7. Ch. &c. For when an Arch-bi∣shop required Joh. Fox (the Author of the Book of Mar∣tyrs) to subscribe to Arti∣cles of Faith, he pulled out his Greek Testament, say∣ing, I will subscribe unto no∣thing but this. So that none, except Jews and Atheists, but will subscribe to God's Book, according to the primitive practice of the Saints, to worship God in Spirit: And for this Liber∣ty of prophesying, and In∣terpretation of the Scrip∣tures (only) by the same Spirit that gave them forth, the ancient Fathers (so called) have pleaded for; as Jacobus Acontius, — Af∣ter I have alledged (saith
he) what I had to say for my Opinion, if the rest shall not allow of my Judgment, I ought to give over defending of it, and cease to be trouble∣some to the Congregation concerning the same; but I ought not to be compel∣led to confess that I have erred; for so I should sin against God.— That we may wrestle with God (saith he) by daily pray∣ers, to grant, that we may have the use of this so so∣veraign and saving Liber∣ty, so profitable to the Church, &c. Oh, that people would but lay aside self-interest! then may they see, how they are falln from the true Worship of God, (by set∣ting up Man's Reason as Judge in spiritual matters,) out of which Apostasie there is no Redemption, till people come to own and obey the sufficiency of God's Grace in their
heas, (their only Teach∣er, it. 2.11, 12. which bears Witness against all sin.) God having said, un∣to the Apostle Paul, My Grace is sufficient for thee. 2 Cor. 12.9. And Paul committed the Saints to the Grace of God generally in his Epistles. The Teachers in England do so likewise (in words) to their hearers. And Kings also acknow∣ledge, it is by Gods Grace they are Kings: Therefore it is the one thing needful, and was Maries choice, and it is the same at this day, unto all that are willing and obedient to the guidance thereof, in the whole course of their Lives, which hath several other names in the Scripture, as Light, Word, Spirit, &c. but is but one eternal, pure Sub∣stance, Enlightning every man that cometh into the World, John. 1.9. And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution. 2. Tim.
3.12. Then it seems that Persecutors were ever blind, 2 Cor. 4.4. Though they may read, That Faith is the Gift of God, And whatsoever is not of Faith is sin. Rom. 14.23. Notwith∣standing many thousands have been murthered or Martyred, since the Apo∣stles time, (or beginning, when men began to force their Faiths,) upon the ac∣count of opinions in Religi∣on, upon such as had faith in Christ Jesus, Act. 10.35. Heb. 12.1. Acted and done by such as professed them∣selves to be Christians, or some faith in God, (even to the shame of the name of Christians amongst both Jews and Turks.) Some they have cut in pieces in cool blood, some burned to death, Bellies ripped open whilst alive, some bu∣ried alive, roasted, upon Spits, boiled to death, with several other Torments; some hanged, and some ba∣ed
in New-England, (in age,) some thousands it Old-England have been excommunicated and im∣prisoned; some imprison∣ed to death, some banish∣ed, some knock'd on the Head, whole Families un∣done, all their goods taken from them, only because of their meeting together (most peaceably) to wor∣ship God in Spirit and in Truth, as God requires, John 4.24. Which is hard-Measure, to be inflicted upon such Christians, as lives peace∣ably with all men, Rom. 12.18. upon such as was always willing, and still are to Give unto Cesar (or civil Magistrate) the things that are Cesar's, Mat. 22.21. and unto God the things that are Gods. The things which may be said to be Gods, or of God, is to worship and serve him in Spirit and in Truth, as aforesaid; to live in his fear by departing
from iniquity, and to seek after the good of all men, to live in all Christian vir∣tues, to do unto all people as we would be dealt with, Matth. 6.12, which can∣not be performed by any, but as they obey the teach∣ings of Gods Spirit in peo∣ples hearts, the Leader in∣to all good, (the same that made David wiser than all his Teachers, Psal. 119.99. Isa. 30.20. Heb. 8.11.) and is a swift witness against every evil thought, word and deed, in every Con∣science, Obedience to which makes people hap∣py for ever, 1 Sam. 15.22. But what person soever pretends, that Conscience or the Light therein is his guide, and acts any thing destructive to Civil Society, as Theft, Murther, or A∣dultery, or are Traitors, or Plotters, or Drunkards, or Cheats, or Vagabonds, or Mischievous Persons,
G. 5.19, 20. To all such the Ch istian Magistrate will be a terror, and a praise to them that do well, Rom. 13.3. if they be of Christs Religion; for he did not compel his Brethren af∣ter the flesh, to his Religi∣on, John 7.5. Yet did he and his Apostles bear a Te∣stimony against all fair-say∣ers and hypocrites in Reli∣gion, and left the Civil Ma∣gistrates to punish all open wickedness; to which a∣greeth King Charles the 1st, in the Collection of his Speeches, pag. 91, 123. In point of Consciencious tenderness, I have often declared, how little I de∣sire my Laws and Scepter should intrench on God's Soveraignty, which is the only King of mens Con∣sciences; nor do I desire any man should be further Subject unto me, than all of us may be subject unto God.— And in his advice to the then Prince of Wales,
now King of England, &c. Your Prerogative is best shewed and exercised in remitting, rather than ex∣acting the rigour of the Laws, there being nothing worse than Legal Tiran∣ny, &c. But saith Christ Jesus, Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and do∣eth them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a Rock, Matth. 7.24. And doeth them, (mark that) dost thou love them that hate thee? &c. The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, he that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. 2 Sam. 23.3.21.15. Now the Jews accounted the ap∣pearance of Christ Jesus in the Flesh, as low, and too mean for them, saying, is not this the Carpenter's Son, and despised him, Matth. 13.55. Even so do too many called Christians, at this
account his 2d coming,  iritual appearance, too low and mean for them to bow unto; that is, his Light or Grace in their hearts, which reproves for Sin, calling it a dark Light, or the Light of a Natural Conscience, and a mis∣guiding Light, &c. ac∣counting it not sufficient to save from the evil of the World, and so make mer∣ry over, and crucifie afresh the just Spirit or Witness of God in their hearts, by wilful kicking against it: Pro. 4.18. John 3.20.16.8. Rom. 3.24. Tit. 3.7. Rev 1, 5.3.14. But blessed be the Lord God, there is a small remnant (in this day,) that are come to witness in their hearts, that little Stone, Dan. 2.34, 44. cut out of the mountain without hands, which shall grow, and fill the whole Earth with Righteousness, and lay every Idol in the dust, notwithstanding all
the Opposition, Art, Wisdom, or Violenc of men or Devils; God will arise more and more in his spiritual appearance (in the hearts of Peo∣ple) until he hath conquered the enemies to Righteousness, and the Glory of the Lord cover the Earth, as the Waters cover the Sea; and happy will all they be, that meet him timely, by turning from the evil Imaginations of their hearts, and submit to his Grace, the way to him; for he is worthy to reign and rule in eve∣ry heart and Conscience, (by his Spirit or Grace therein) now and for ever. If any man say, I love God, and hateth his Bro∣ther, he is a lyar; for he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen? 1 John 4.20. In which Love I of∣fer this my Mite for Love and Peace-sake, de∣siring the good of all people impartially, ho∣ping that no longer the hedges of Opinions may barr us from loving one another, with the same love that God doth love us: And that many People may go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob (his Light or Grace in every Conscience) and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths, Isa. 2.3. To which all those that truly fear the Lord God, will say, Amen. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my Body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing. 1 Cor. 13.3.
To conclude, as things are now in the World, it seems to me, that no Protestant will ever∣more become a Persecutor, (for Conscience sake) they having seen the Judgments of God always following upon People and Nations for Persecution; for Persecutors striving to sepa∣rate the Tares from the Wheat, have taken too much upon them, (to ascend God's Throne-Conscience) it being the Work of the Angels, to separate the Tares from the Wheat in the time of Harvest, at the last day, Matth. 13.41. 1. Cain for persecuting godly Abel, was made a Vagabond, &c. 2. Ishmael for mocking his Brother Isaac, was cast out. 3. Joseph's Brethren were punished by fa∣mine and distress, who persecuted him. 4. Pharaoh and the Egyptians were drowned for persecuting the Children of Israel. 5. Ahab and his house were destroyed, who persecuted good Micah the Prophet. 6. Jezabel, who slew many of the Prophets, was eaten up by Dogs. 7. King Joash was slain in his Bed, who per∣secuted Zachariah. 8. Haman the informer, who persecuted Mordecai, and the Jews, was hanged. 9. The Priests that persecuted Daniel, was eaten up by Lions. 10. King Antiochus was destroyed with
worms, which he confessed came upon him for persecuting the Jews, and other evils. 11. Herod, who sought to destroy Christ, and put to death the Children in Bethlehem, was smitten of God, with a rottenness in his bow∣els, and Worms, whereof he dyed. 12. Pilate, that wicked Governour, under whom Christ was crucified, killed himself. 13. If Histories speak true, few or none of the persecuting Roman Emperors dyed in their Beds. 14. Judas the other Informer (some say) hanged himself. 15. Dr. Dunning, Chancellor of Norwich, a persecutor, dyed suddenly. 16. Bp. Thornton a Persecutor, seeing some of his Men playing at Bowls on a Sunday, (so cal∣led) fell suddenly into a Palsie, and being had to bed, he was put in mind to remember God, Yea, said he, I do, and my Lord Cardinal too; and so dyed. Much more might be men∣tioned of the sudden Deaths of Persecutors in Queen Maries days. 17. Dr. Story, a bloody Persecutor in Queen Maries time, was hanged in Queen Elizabeth's time. Multitudes of Presidents more might be gi∣ven from the Records of Histories, to this day, of Gods Judgments upon the Persecutors; but for brevity sake I shall omit, believing that no Protestant now is of a persecuting Spirit, they
having seen it to be the Rock upon which Go∣vernments have split, and whole Nations and Kingdoms ruined thereby: Therefore it may be good for all Persecutors in this day, to re∣member the Counsel of Gamaliel, Act. 5.38, 39. Now, I say unto you, refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this Counsel, or this work be of men, it will come to naught; but if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest haply you be found fighters against God. And also the Counsel of Athanasius, (whom the Papists have trusted) saith he, (as before mentioned,) It is the property of piety, not to force, but to persuade, in imitation of our Lord, &c. Constraining none coming to him, and knocking rather, and saying, My Sister, my Spouse, open to me, &c. and entereth when he is opened to, and retires if they delay, and will not open unto him; because it is not with Swords, nor Darts, nor Souldiers, nor Armour, that Truth is to be declared; but with persuasion and Counsel. And it is obser∣vable, that it was the impious Arians, who first of all brought in this doctrine, to persecute o∣thers, among Christians, whose Successors both Papists and Protestants are, in this matter, (saith R. B. p. 358.) whom Athanasius thus reproveth further: Where (saith he) have they learned to persecute? Certainly they cannot say, they have learned it from the Saints; but this hath been given them, and taught them of the De∣vil.
The Lord commanded indeed sometimes to flee, and the Saints sometimes fled; but to persecute is the invention and argument of the Devil, which he seeks against all. And after he saith, In so far as the Arians banish those that will not subscribe their Decrees, they shew, that they are contrary to Christians, and friends of the Devil. See Athan. in Epist. ad Solit. Vit. & Apol. 1. de fuga sua, Tom. 1. In the great day, Then shall the King say to them on his Right hand, come ye blessed of my Fa∣ther, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, &c. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye cloathed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in Prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the Righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? &c. And the King shall answer, and say unto them, verily I say unto you, In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me. Matth. 25. v. 34. to the end. — He is not ashamed to call them Brethren. Heb. 2.11. What portion can they expect, that uncloath the Righteous, and that take their meat from them, and instead of visiting of them in Pri∣son, cast them into Prison, &c. —The time cometh (saith our Saviour) that who∣soever
killeth you, will think that they do God ser∣vice▪ And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. John 16.23. —But blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil a∣gainst you, falsely, for my sake. Rejoyce, and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in Heaven; for so persecuted they the Pro∣phets which were before you.-Mat. 5.11, 12. Whosoever is wrong, the Persecutor is not in the right, most People conclude, by the Wit∣ness for God in their hearts, are made sensible of. Saith Jer. Taylor, D. D. (so stiled) Chaplain in Ordinary to His late Majesty, in his Discourse of the liberty of Prophesying. Let all errours be as much, and as zealously supprest as may be; but let it be done by such means as are proper Instruments of their suppression, by preaching and disputation, by Charity a sweetness, by Holiness of Life, assiduity of ex∣hortation, by the Word of God, and Pray∣er. For these ways are most natural, most pru∣dent, most peaceable, and effectual; only let not men be hasty, in calling every disliked Opinion by the name of Heresie, and when they have resolved that they will call it so, let them use the erring person like a Brother,
not beat him like a Dog, or convince him with a Gibbet, or vex him out of his Understand∣ing or persuasion, &c. With much more to the same purpose. Testimonies.

in the mean , shutting up th way of the holy Spirit, they determine to say nothing but what they have written. O unhappy King of Prophets, yea, and truly cursed, which depend not upon Gods: Spirit, but upon their own writings or me∣ditation! Why pray∣est thou to the Lord, thou false Prophet, to give thee his holy Spi∣rit, by which thou mayest speak things profitable, and yet thou repellest the Spi∣rit? Why preferrest thou thy meditation, or Study to the Spi∣rit of God? Other∣wise why committest thou not thy self to the Spirit? — Again, (saith he) the Sheep of Christ seeketh nothing but the voice of Christ,
which he knoweth by the Holy Spirit, wherewith he is fil∣led; he regards not learning Tongues, or any outward thing, so as therefore to be∣lieve this or that to be the voice of Christ his true Sheepherd, he knoweth that there is need of no o∣ther thing, but the Testimony of God's Spirit, &c.

(saith he) It is the property of Piety, not to force, but to persuade, in imitation of our Lord, who forced no body, but left it to the will of every one to follow him, &c. But the De∣vil, because he hath nothing of Truth, uses knocks and Axes to break up the Doors of such as receive him; but our Savi∣our is meek, teaching the Truth, Whosoe∣ver will come af∣ter me, &c.

FIrst, The Judges and the Witnesses did (when Sentence was pronounced) put their hands upon the con∣demned persons head,Drus. praeterit. Mat. 27. and said, Thy blood be upon thine own Head. Unto this the People had reference, saying, His blood be on us, and on our Children, Mat. 27.25. Secondly, In the time of Execution, they would give a Malefactor a grain of Frankin∣cense in a cup of Wine; this they did give to cause a giddiness in the condemned persons head, that thereby he might be the less sensi∣ble of the pain. Saint Mark calleth this cup, Wine mingled with Myrrhe, Mark 15.23. This was done after the manner of the Jews; but the
Souldiers, in Mockery, mingled Vinegar and Gall with it,Korot le bona be∣cos schel iaijn Mai∣mon in sanhedrim c. 13.Mat. 27.34. As likewise they gave him a second cup in Derision, when they took a sponge,It Moses Kotsens in san hedrim. and filled it with Vinegar, and put it on a reed, Mat. 27.48. Thirdly, The manner of the Cross, on which Christ was crucified, was like this figure, †, his Hands nailed to each side, and his Feet nailed together to the bottom of the Cross, al∣most. And Jesus said unto Thomas, reach hither thy Finger, and behold my Hands, &c. Joh. 20.27. Psal. 22.16. Even so do many (in this day,) Crucifie afresh the Son of God, and put him to open shame.

of the Thongs, and such Scourges; the Greeks termed Flagra Taxillata; in the Scripture they are termed Scorpions; My Father hath chastised you with rods, but I will correct you with scorpions. 1 Kings 12.12. The manner of their stoning to death the rebellious Sons, Witches, &c. THe Offender was led to a place without the Gates two Cubits high, his Hands being bound, from hence one of the Witnesses tumbled him by a stroke upon the Loins; if that kill him not, the Witnesses lift up a stone, being the weight of two men, which chiefly the other Witness casteth upon him;Paul fagius, Deut. 17.7. if that kill him not, all Israel throw stones upon him. The hands of the Witnesses shall be first upon him, to put him to death, and afterwards the Hands of all the people, Deut. 17.7.
The manner of their strangling of such as lieth with another Man's Wife, or that smiteth his Father or his Mo∣ther, &c, THe Offender was put in dung up to the loins, a Towel be∣ng cast about his neck,[Paraphrast.

in this kind, that if they had built an house with a Beam or piece of Timber unjustly gotten, they would pull down the house, and restore the same Beam or piece of Timber to the Owner.David Nimchi. From this the Prophet Habakkuk doth not much dissent: The Stone shall cry out of the wall, and the Beam out of the Timber shall an∣swer it, Hab. 2.11. Among the Jews he ought to be sold, that was not of sufficient worth to make Restitution, Exod. 22.3. And Augustine saith of Christians, (Aug. Epist. 54.) That he which doth not make restitution, according to his ability, never repented. And Non remittetur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum. No doubt, but that if this Law was practised in England, we should not have so many Thieves; for to be sold as slaves for stealing, is more ter∣rible than Death, (that are so desperate to cry, A short Life and a sweet.) And so may have time to see their folly, and may become new Crea∣tures, and steal no more, rather to work with their hands, Eph. 4.28. But if they become ho∣nest, and not able to work, they will be main∣tained by those that fear the Lord, Deut. 28.48.
Phylacteries, that the Pharisees wore upon their Arms. THey made broad their Phylacteries, and enlar∣ged the borders of their Garments, Mat. 23.5. It is said that they were parchment, upon which was written some of the Law, as the ten Commandments, &c. The Command was general,Mos. Kotensis. praec. offir. 22.Ex. 13.9. It shall be for a sign unto thee, upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine Eyes; So that it was not the wearing of them, which our Saviour (did then condemn) but the making of them broad, whereby they would appear more holy than o∣thers; some wore them on their fore-heads. Because the Pharisees superstitiously concei∣ted, that by them as by Amulets, Spells and Charms, hanged about their necks, themselves might be preserved from danger, Hierom testi∣fieth, that the Pharisees had such a conceit of their Or∣naments:Chrysost. & Hier. in Mal. 2.3. in which place he compareth them to cer∣tain superstitious Women of his time,The Priest under the Law wore white Garments, Levit. 16.4. But the white cloathing of a Chri∣stian is a meek and a quiet Spirit, &c. 1 Peter 3.4. Rev. 19.8. & 4.4, 18. See page 256. who carried up and down upon the like
ground, short sentences ou of the new Testament and Reliques of the Cross the same superstition hath prevailed with many o latter times, who for th same purpose hang the be∣ginning of St. John about their necks, and in the year of our Lord 692 certain Sorcerers were condemned for the lik kind of Magick, by the name of Phylacterians see T.G. civ. & Eccl. Rite lib. 2. ch. 4. As Christian in the consecration of their Churches (saith he make special choice of some particular Saints by whose names they call them, as St. Peter Church, St. Pauls, St. Andrews, &c. so the Idola¦trous Israelites consecrated their Groves unto particular Idols, &c. (no good example to Christians) howbeit the most high dwelleth no in Temples made with hands, Isa. 66.1, 2. Act 7.48. & 17, 24. Saith the Lord, and to him will look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit, and trembleth at my word. 1 Cor. 6.19. your Bo¦dy is the temple of the Holy Ghost, (the Lord Supper) Behold, I stand at the door, and knock i any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will com in unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me Rev. 3.20. Happy is he that opens his heart to the knocks, or reproofs of Gods Grace, shall o∣vercome the evil, and sit with God upon hi Throne, and live with Christ Jesus for ever and
ever; this is the plain truth, open and free unto all the obedient, of what Nation soever; as Serjeant Jefferies well said, in these words at the Tryal of Stephen Colledge, viz. Truth is not con∣fined to places, nor Persons neither, but applyed to all honest men, be they Irish men or others. Lastly, Herods Temple (which was the second Temple) about 40 years in building, was set on fire by Titus his Souldiers, that it could not be quenched by the industry of man, at the same time the Temple at Delphi being in chief re∣quest among the Heathen People,Genebrard Chro. l. 2. Anno Chr. 69. Theodore l 3. c. 11. sozomenus lib. 5. cap. 19.20.21. was utterly over∣thrown by Earth-quakes, and Thunderbolts from Heaven, and neither of them could ever since be repaired; the concur∣rence of which two miracles evidently sheweth (saith T. G.) that the time was then come, when God would put an end both to Jewish Cere∣monies, and Heathenish Idolatry, that the King∣dom of his Son might be the better established. Notwithstanding, many called Christians▪ do still build outward Temples; setting them East and West, as Solomons Temple, when Gods Temple is in an humble and contrite Spirit, Isa. 57. see page 267.
How to make Soap, called Ball Soap, that will be white. TAke 4 or 5 Bushel of the ashes of Fearn, (the Fearn having taken no wet, nor too ripe) Wood Ashes one peck, and three pecks of Lime, put these into a tub that hath holes in the bottom, (stopt with spickets) on these holes lay straw (in the tub) then put boiled water to the Ashes, and the next day let the water run out, boil this water in a furnace about 24 hours, or until it be thickish, that it will receive tallow; put in the tallow (being shred) by degrees, stirring it continually with an Iron Ladle, and if it thicken fast, put in tal∣low faster and faster, for fear it burn, for then all is spoiled, then stir it with a wooden spade (being so thick, that the Ladle will not do it) let the fire then slake, but stir it still (which is as much as a man can well do then) take it out as fast as you can, into a cloath that lies in a tub, wrap it up, that it cool not too fast, take it out by hand-fulls, and weight it into quarterns, or half pounds, and work them into Balls; so make a bigger or lesser quantiry.
How to make Starch for Linnen. TAke the Bran of the finest Wheat, steep it in water 2 days, then let the water run through 2 or 3 fine Sieves, then put the water in a broad Earth dish, and set it in the Sun, or over a gentle heat of coals, until it be dry, and it is fit for use. Here followeth the form of a Test, which may be necessary for all men to sub∣scribe publickly before a Justice of Peace (once a year) or nearest Justice, (which will prove as binding as an Oath can be) and be∣ing some people cannot in good conscience break Christs Commands, who hath Com∣manded not to swear at all, Mat. 5.34, 35, 36, 37. James 5.12. their yea or nay may serve, which will secure the Govern∣ment, as well, if not better, than all Oaths, if all could swear (as the late times may wit∣ness) for he that is found to be a plotter a∣gainst the King (let his Religion be what it will) there is a law in England to hang him,
then that law keeps the Government safer than all Oaths, &c. I. A B. do solemnly, and in good conscience, in the sight of God and Man acknowledge and declare, that King Charles the Second is lawful King of this Realm, and all the Dominions thereunto beloging, and that neither the Pope, nor See of Rome, nor any else by their Authority have right in any case to depose the King, or dispose of his Kingdom, or upon any score whatever to absolve his Subjects of their Obedience, or to give leave to any of them to Plot or Conspire the hurt of the Kings Person, his State, or People, and that all such pretences and power are false, pernicious, and damnable; and I do further sincerely profess, and in good Conscience declare, that I do not believe, that the Pope is Christs Vicar, or Peters lawful Successor, or that he, or the See of Rome, severally or joyntly are the Rule of Faith, or Judge of Controversy, or that they can absolve Sins: nor do I believe there is a Pur∣gatory after Death, or that Saints should be prayed to, or Images in any sense be worship'd; nor do I believe that there is any Transubstantiation in the Lords Sup∣per, or Elements of Bread and Wine at, or after the Consecration thereof by any Person whatsoever; but I do firmly helieve that the present Communion of the Ro∣man-Catholick-Church is both Superstitious, and Idola∣trous; and all this I do acknowledge, intend, profess and declare without any equivocation, or reserv'd, or other sense then the plain and usual signification of these words according to the real intention of the Law∣makers,
and the common acceptation of all true Pro∣testants, signed A B. Obj. They object (saith R. B.) that Christ did swear, and we ought to imitate him. Ans I answer, that Christ did not swear; and albeit he had sworn, being yet under the Law, this would no ways ob∣lige us under the Gos∣pel,Hier, lib. Ep. part 3 tract. 1. Ep. 2. R B. Apol p. 394. 398. as neither Circumci∣sion, or the Celebration of∣the Paschal Lamb, concerl ning which, Hierom saith, al things agree not to us, who are Servants, that a∣greed to our Lord, &c. The Lord swore, as Lord, whom no man did forbid to swear, but unto us, that are Servants, it is not lawful to swear, be∣cause we are forbidden by the law of our Lord. Yet lest we should not suffer scandal by his ex∣ample, he hath not sworn, since he commanded us not to swear. And saith Pythagoras, let no man call God to witness by an Oath, no not in Judgment; but let every man so accustom himself to speak, that he may become worthy to be trusted even with∣out an Oath; Quintilianus takes notice, that it was of old a kind of Infamy, if any was desired to swear, but to require an Oath of a noble man, was like an examining him by the hangman. This Doctrine of Christ is so strictly laid down, as that no room is left for the least objection, as is evident in these very words, Swear not all; But
above all things, my Brethren swear not, &c, which was the Judgment of many Martyrs, in Q. Maries days, and before, see Eusebius Relati∣ons, Justin Martyr Ap. 2. Tertullian Ap. cap. 32. Clemens, Origen, Athanas. in pass. & cruc. Dom. Christi, Chrysostom. in Genes. homil. 15. Idem homil. in Act Apost. cap 3 Beda in Jac. 5. Anselmus in Matth. 5. Waldenses, Viclevus, Erasmus in Mat. 5. and in Jac 5. A multitude more witnesses might be produced, whose faith was against all swearing, see R. Barclays Apology aforementio∣ned, see p. 273 in this Book.

Some Copies to write by. VVHoso loveth Instruction, loveth Know∣ledge, but he that hateth reproof is brutish. Every Child is known by his doing, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right; foolishness is bound in the heart of a Child, but the Rod of Cor∣rection shall drive it far from him. With-hold not Correction from thy Child, for if thou beatest him with the Rod, he shall not die. A wise Son maketh a glad Father, but a foolish Son is the heaviness of his Mother. A Child left to himself, brings his Mother to shame. The Father of the Righteous shall greatly rejoyce. A proud look, and a lying Tongue, the Lord hates, Prov. 2. Lord give me Wisdom to direct my ways. I beg not Riches, nor yet length of days. Be well advised, and wary Counsel take. Ere thou dost any actions undertake. Defend the Truth, for that who will not dye, A Coward is, and gives himself the Lye, Ever thy credit keep, 'tis quickly gone. Being got by many Actions, lost by one.
Hear much, but little speak; a wise man fears, And will not use his Tongue, as much as Ears, Judge not between two Friends, but rather see, If thou canst bring them friendly to agree. Keep thyself humble, Pride hath ruin'd many. The proud man's seldom well belov'd of any. Never to gather Wealth through fraud presume, A little evil got, will much consume. Grasp not for Honour, wish no blazing Glory. For these will perish in an ages Story. Quietly learn all crosses to endure, Repining doth more misery procure. Fame, Honour, Beauty, State, Train, Blood and Birth, Are but the fading blossoms of the Earth. When thou livest well, mind not what people say, It's not in our power, their Tongues to sway. Those whom God doth by his own Spirit lead, They are his Sons, you in the Scripture read. Safe in thy Breast, close lock up thy Intents. For he that knows thy purpose best prevents. Zeal is a fire, and useful in its kind, But nothing is more dangerous, if blind. 'Tis use, and practice, that becomes each skill, For that makes perfect, what neglect doth kill. Shun Rumors, lest thou beest, as the Author nam'd, Silence hurts none, but some for words are blam'd.

I humbly pray thee, to incline my heart more and more to take heed unto thy word in my heart, that daily re∣proves, and troubles me, for every evil thought, word, and deed, and stirs me up to good things, so shall I be enabled to praise thy name here on Earth, that I may dwell with thee in thy Kingdom of Heaven, for ever and ever, Amen. John 16.8.13. [Good thoughts are of Gods own begetting, and very comfortable to a Christian, and are the fruit and effect of keeping and obeying the Law of God within the heart, Romans 2.14, 15.

Now if thy heart be inclined to pray continually, thou wilt hunger and thirst after Righteousness, and will alwaies in thy heart give thanks unto God, at the receiving of meat and drink, and all other of Gods Mercies, though thou dost not express it in words, except God shall require it of thee for the edification of others, Matth. 5.6. 1 Tim. 2.8. Eph. 6.18. Answer. Truly, when my mind is still and out of earth∣ly thoughts, I find inclination to pray alwaies, and also a hungering, and thirsting after Righ∣teousness, Christ Jesus hath said all such are blessed, and as God said unto Cain, if thou do well, shalt thou not be excepted? and if thou dost not well, sin lieth at thy door, Gen. 4.7.

Yes, He works in many that are of a self interest, that cannot rest from compelling o∣thers (more Righteous than they) to some out∣ward observation, ceremony, or opinion, before
others see it their duty so to do. John 15.20. Question. Then is it not the same Spirit that put the Martyrs to Death, as at this day, that seeks to force others to their opinions? Exodus 23.2.

Yes, for all People of every Nation that fears God, and works Righteousness, it is by this Grace that they perform good things, and such do find acceptance with God, neither can such seek to enforce others to their faith any more, than Christ Jesus did his Brethren after the flesh, to believe in him, John 7.5.

Only by every ones keeping to their own measure of Grace in themselves, and none to exalt themselves above their measure received of God, and none to be drawn from the obedi∣ence
thereof by any mans words or actions, lest their portion be with the young Prophet, whom the old deceived, 1 Kings 13.18. Jere. 9.4. Question. May we by an outward force seek to deliver our selves from imposition? Rom. 8.31. Rom. 12.19. Answer. No, all true Christians will love their Imposers, and obey the Magistrate in all things that are due to Caesar, Matthew 22.21. Acts 4.19. [The true worship of God stands not in any outward observation of time or place, or any bodily exercise therein; but in doing the will of God, bowing in his Spirit, and obeying the voice thereof, W. S. page 43. Question. Doth God accept of the several Religious perfor∣mances of People in these days? John 4.24. Answer. Those that wait not to f eel Gods Spirit lea∣ding them into those performances or duties, find no more acceptance with God, than the offerings of the lame, and the blind did in the first Covenant, Jude 30. Rom. 8.26. Question. What is the work of the true Ministers? Acts 28.18. Answer. To remind People to take heed unto their
only Teacher, Gods Grace in their hearts, and such will not desire People to follow them any further than they follow Christ; and their holy Conversation, wins more to God than their Preachings, Job 36.22. 1 Cor. 11.1. 2 Peter 1.9. Heb. 8.11. A Cloud of Witnesses might be produced to prove, that no force ought to be used to drive People into this, or the other Religious opinion before the Lord by his Grace in their hearts manifesteth to them, that it is their duty to con∣form; For what is not of Faith is sin, Rom. 14.5, 23. A few Witnesses here follow. Jeremiah Taylor, (once) Chaplain to King Charles the first, said, I being most of all troubled that men should be persecuted and afflicted, for disagreeing in such opinions, which they cannot with sufficient grounds obtrude upon others necessarily, be∣cause they cannot propound them infallibly. Dr. Stilling fleet (once) Chaplain to King Charles the second, in a Sermon before the King, Anno 1674/5 saith, To be a Christian was not to fight for the faith, but to live by it, not to quarrel for good works, but to practise them; in short, to be a Christian was to depart from iniquity, and to
do good, to be meek and humble, and patient, and peaceable towards all men, to be charita∣ble and kind, to be sober and temperate in all things, to be holy, sincere, and innocent in his actions towards God and Man. Lucernus said, he that commandeth any thing, wherewith he bindeth the conscience, this is an Antichrist, Inde Benuse disp. fol. 71. Calvin said, that the Apostle gave to under∣stand, that to exercise Authority over ones faith was in no wise just nor tolerable yea, (said he) it is Tyranny in the Church; for faith ought to be free from all subjection of men. Luther, upon 1 Kings 5. In the building of the Temple their was no sound of Iron heard, to signify that Christ will have in his Church a free and a willing People, not compelled, and constrained by Laws, &c. Stephanus, King of Poland said, it belongeth not to me to reform the conscience, I have al∣waies gladly given that over to God, which be∣longeth to him, and so shall I do now; and also for the future, I will suffer the Weeds to grow until the time of Harvest, for I know that the number of Believers are but small, therefore said he, when some were proceeding to Perse∣cution, Ego sum Rex Populorum, non Conscientiarum,
that is, I am the King of the People, not of their Consciences, he also affirmed that Religion was not to be planted with fire, and Sword, Chron. van. de. Rel. Ʋriih 2 deel. Ellis Hooks said in a Book of Martyrs, Paul the Apostle taught, that the Servant of the Lord must not strive, but must be gentle to∣wards all men, suffering the evil men, instructing them with meekness, that are contrary minded, &c. 2 Tim. 2.4.2. If any Man shall pretend that the Scriptures judge according to his conceptions or consci∣ence for other men, and that they must take their religious measures by the line of his direction; such a Person makes himself greater than either Church, Scripture, or Conscience, W. P. Add to Prov. 148. Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, fur this is the Law and the Prophets, Mat. 7.12. FINIS.
THE Postscript TO THE READER. LET none wonder that I call some part of this Book a Primmer for Children; since my Soul loves innocence, and the true Childs State, and a Primmer only was my first design, but since so many things are added, I thought good to intitle it a Manual, therefore, where any has run into by-paths upon the barren Mountains of outside Religion (and true Re∣ligion not in the heart, but a talk of Religion
only in the head or tongue) must come and re∣turn to this innocent Childs State, to the Alpha, or the beginning, to the A B C in Christs School (Gods Grace in the heart, the just mans path, Prov. 4.18. that reproves for evil) to have peace in God, so shall their Religion, and learn∣ing be in the substance (Christ Jesus) not sha∣dowy, nor tinctured with heathenish learning, through Philosophy, and vain deceit, Col. 2.8. And therefore Reader, apply thy whole heart to Gods Grace therein, and God will teach thee to profit in all good things who alone can drive away all darkness and errour out of thy heart (and not to be drawn from the obedience of Gods Grace by any mans words or actions what∣soever, least thy portion be with the young Prophet, least thy portion be with the young Prophet, whom the old deceived, 1 Kings 13. not minding his own gift given him of God, before anothers) so shall thy mind be fixed, and stayed in the way of righteousness; and will give unto God all the honour and praise, (from whence alone all good cometh) not unto man, nor any thing of Man, whose imaginations are evil, when at any time he turns his mind (in∣to his own wisdom) from his true guide (Gods Word, Spirit, or Grace in his conscience, Psalms 119.9. Isaiah, 30.20.) which Spirit was the only rule that the Righteous walked by, before the holy Scriptures were written or printed in paper (the same at this day, blessed be the Lord God, he hath not left himself without a witness
for Righteousness in every conscience) and be∣ing written are a Rule, but not the chief Rule, now they that hold it to be their chief Rule, ought by it to learn to love their enemies, being it is therein written; but indeed that they can∣not do, before they turn their whole mind and soul to the said chief Rule (Gods Grace) to re∣ceive power also, to be kept (by it) out of the many evils that are in the world, John 17.15. But instead of making the Scriptures their Rule, the Priests meanings from the Scriptures is injoyned for a Rule, which breeds the great disunion (at this day) there∣fore if nothing but the Scrip∣tures was read in publick pla∣ces for worship (for nothing of mans framing,See p. of unifor. and making is so good) and see how many Dissenters there will be, &c. And no interpreter, but Gods Talent of Grace in every heart (to himself) by which People knows good from evil, and by it can also see and discern such as profess Religion (only) as a Cloak for self-interest, from such as are Re∣ligious indeed, that follow after Righteousness, and seek the good of all People in general (being Gods Workmanship) that is Godly, dwelling in the same love one to another, as God hath for us all (that would not the death of a Sin∣ner) in his sending plentiful seasons, &c. Mat. 5.45. For God is holy, just and good, and with∣out holiness, no man shall see God to his ever∣lasting
joy, and truly happy is that man, that dwells in this innocent love to all the Creation, he is blessed, let People call him either Papist, Protestant, or Heretick, or any other name, he is never the worse, the Lord God is on his side, Gods Name is his strong Tower, and sure hiding place (if he continues in this love to all People) he will not fear, though ten thousands rise up against him; for he doth not trust in the arm of flesh, Horses nor Chariots, nor go's to Egypt for help, but his strength and stay is only upon God to deliver him from all his enemies both within and without; for he that dwells in this Love, dwells in God, and God in him, 1 John 4.16. and he will assuredly take his Lord and Masters Counsel, who said, Mat. 5.44. But I say unto you, love your Enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you. That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, for he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil, and on the good, &c. For if you love them which love you, what reward have ye, &c. Note, That all the Rules in this Book are not set in order (as some Books are) but the Contents or Table at the end will direct to each part, and parts of each rule and thing; which so happened by reason, that several questions and things were by me sent to the Press in single papers, and so printed partly as they came, that
some few things, may be twice mentioned, but the errors in printing I hope thou wilt amend by thy pen accordding to the errata, and others that are really so. I have omitted the fractional parts in several of the Rules and Tables in this Book; because (if I had inserted them) they would have much puzled the young learners, (which some Persons may be ready to cavil at) but the er∣ror is so small, being few Persons matter the measuring of Timber, Board, &c. to an inch or part of an inch, the which exactness may be learned, after the learner is a little skilled in the rule of Fractions, in page 42. In Gaging of Vessels or Barrels in page 29 there was a mistake, therefore begin at the ninth Line thus. Or if it be a round Barrel that bellies in the middle, measure the breadth at bung, and at the head, and add them together, and half thereof multiply into half the Compass (between the end and the bung) and that product by half the length of the Barrel, and the product divide by 288 ½ or 289 for Ale or Bear, 231 for Wine, or 272 for Salt or Corn, the quotient shews half the number of Gallons in the said Barrel, but if the Barrel be wider at one end then the other,
add the breadths together, and half the number of inches is the true breadth, allowing for the sides of the wood of the Barrel. Note, That if it's round, and bellies not at all, you may find the product of inches, by round Timber measure in page 28, and divide it by 289 the inches in a gallon of Ale (or therea∣abouts) and work as before. How to find the square of a round Timber, stick, or Stone, by Arithmetick, which you may also do by Gunters line in p. 207. Alwaies multiply the number 2821, by the inches of the Compass, and cut off 4 figures from the right hand. Example. See p. 37. For the third figure, or multiply the whole longest doted line, by half the 2 shorts, being first added together. The fifth figure, or multiply half the longest side by the dote line.
For the sixth figure being a Circle, or multi∣ply half the Compass by half the breadth, the product shews the number of flat or superficial Inches, if it be the end of a Barrel, round Tim∣ber, Stone or Land, &c. being round. See p. 36. The second figure there, may be measured like the 3d figure in p. 37. Of Bees, p. 276. &c. The best is to smother no Bees, till the latter end of September, the weather cold, to prevent your Neighbours Bees, that will smell the Hony, and so may rob your o∣ther Bees that are not very strong. Secondly, if you find that the under Hives, be somewhat too weak in October, set 2 of them together, the strongest uppermost, or any other weak stock upon one of them; to be one house. Rot in Sheep, p. 112. Drench them every month (if need be) also give every Sheep one mouthful of Hay, before they go out of the fold every dewy morning, both in Winter, and Summer; and other Cattel, if it be a very wet time. Remember that Medicines that are good for Men, are also good for Beasts giving them the bigger quantity; but to save some Charge. For Rubarb, take Red-dock roots.

For the leaves of Coriander, use Parsnep leaves. For Navelwort, use Housleek. For Cypresse, use Savine. For Fir-leaves, use the leaves of Popular. For Acacis, use the juice of Sloes. For Opium, use the juice of Field Poppies. For Liquorish, use Raisons in the Sun. For juice of Citrons, use Lemons. For Aloes, use the juice of Wormwood. For Bears-grease, use Fox-grease. For Goose grease, use Duck, or Hens-grease. For Badgers grease, use Neats-foot-oil. For Antimony or Lithargy, use burnt Lead. For Spodium, use burnt Harts-horn, or the con∣trary, taking the bigger quantity of the wea∣kest, &c. Lastly, The decoction of the Herb, called Gransel, is good against all diseases of heat, and binding, both in Men and Beast; and for wind use Peny-Royal, green or dryed.
To make Mead. VVHen the Hony is run out of the best of the Combs, as in p 282. wash the Combs in water, and the Hony will quickly out, strain it through a Sieve; now to know whether the water be strong enough of the Hony, put in a sound Egg, if it swims, to be seen the breadth of a groat, it is sweet enough; otherwise put in more Hony; (it may be made any time of the year) when this water is well setled, take the clearest, and boyl it almost a quarter of an hour, with 2 or three sprigs of Rosemary, skim it often, and when its cold, put Barm to it, and beat it, and work it like new Ale, then barrel it up, and stop it close, and after about three or six Months, bottle it up, and it will keep long; it's very good for the aged, and consumptive Persons. Of Cyder. AFter your Apples have stood 2 days in Tubs (being stampt) or less time, if they were mellow before they were stampt. Or if
too mellow put water to them; and for to press out the juice, do thus, take a thick board, almost 2 foot over both ways, and nail some inch board at the edges thereof, that it may hold water a∣bout 2 Inches high above the board, and cut a natch for it to run out; then upon the middle of this thick board, nail an inch board, of about 14 inches square, to lay the bag thereon (house little hair bags, and fill them not too full) the board being ready with the bag thereon; and a thick board on the bag also, set it near a post in the house, and make a square hole for a weighty pole to go in to crush the bag, so that by this way two men may press in an hour, more than I saw any screw-press would do in two; and the charge of this Press may not be 18 d. If you put into each bottle a lump of loaf Sugar, the Cyder will be the better, and keep longer, being set in a cool place. Water-Cyder, being a wholsom drink, thus made. STamp one bushel of Apples any time of the year, and put to them 8 gallons of water, let them steep one week, and strain them, or take the stampings that you prest your Cyder out, and put as much water to them as they yiel∣ded
Cyder, let them steep 2 days or more, then press out the water, and boyl it as good bear, and work it with Barm, and tun it up, and to every gallon, put in one ounce of Sugar or more; drink it all before 2 Months is past. Note, that if you boyl with the Water-Cyder one peck of Malt, it will be much better; order it as you do Bear or Ale. Pills to purge any one of the four hu∣mours. First, For the Colick.

How one that can read English well, may understand the Latin Bible in∣to English, without a Master. John the First. 1. In prin-ci-pi-o e-rat Ser-mo, & Ser-mo e-rat a-pud De-um, & Ser-mo e-rat De-us. 1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was at God, and the Word was God. 2. Hic Ser-mo e-rat in prin-ci-pi-o a-pud De-um. 2. This Word was in the beginning at God. 3. Om-ni-a per hunc Ser-mo-nem sunt fa-cta, & abs-que e-o ni-hil e-rat fa-ctum quod e-rat fact-um. 3. All things by this Word are made, and without it nothing was made which was made.
4. In e-o e-rat vi-ta, & vi-ta e-rat Lux ho-mi-num. 4. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5. Et Lux lu-cet in te-ne-bris, & te-ne-brae non com-pre-hen-de-runt e-am. 5. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness not▪ comprehended it. 6. E-rat ho-mo mis-sus à De-o, cu-jus no-men Jo-han-nes 6. There was a man sent from God, of whom the name John. 7. Is ve-nit ad Te-sti-mo-ni-um, ut te-sta-re-tur de Lu-ce, ut om-nes cre-de-rent per e-um. 7. He came for a Witness, that he might witness of the light, that all might believe by him. 8. Il-le e-rat non illa Lux, sed e-rat mis-sus
ut te-sta-re-tur de-il-là Luce. 8. He was not that Light, but was sent that he might witness of that light. 9. Hic e-rat il-lave-ra Lux, quae il-lu-mi-nat om-nem ho-mi-nem ve-ni-en-tem in mun-dum. 9. This was the true light, which enlighteneth every man coming into the world. 10. E-rat in mun-do, & mun-dus non no-vit e-um. 10. He was in the world, and the world not knew him. 11. Ve-nit ad su-a, & su-a non ac-ce-pe-runt eum. 11. He came to his own, and his own not received him. 12. Au-tem quot-quot ac-ce-pe-runt eum, de-dit eis hoc jus, ut fint fa-cti
fi-li-i D-ei, nem-pè i-is qui cre-dunt in no-men e-jus. 12. But as many as received him, he gave to them this right, that they might be made the sons of God, namely to them which believe on the name of him. 13. Qui sunt na-ti non ex san-gui-ne, ne-{que} ex vo-lun-ta-te vi-ri, sed ex De-o. 13. Which are born not of blood, neither of the will of man, but of God. 14. Et Ser-mo est fa-ctus Ca-ro, & ha-bi-ta-vit in no-bis, & vi-di-mus Glo-ri-am e-jus, ut Glo-ri-am U-ni-ge-ni-ti à Pa-tre, ple-nus gra-tiae-&ve-ri-ta-tis. 14. And the Word is made Flesh, and dwelt in us, and we saw the Glory of him, as the Glory of the only begotten of the Fa∣ther, full of grace and Truth. 15. Jo-han-nes te-sta-tus de eo, & cla-ma-vit, di-cens, Hic est de quo di-ce-bam, is qui
ve-nit po-nè me est an-te-po-si-tus mi-hi, qui-a e-rat pri-or me. 15. John testified of him, and cried, saying this is he of whom I said, he who came after me is prepared before me because he was before me. 16 Et om-nes ac-ce-pi-mus & gra-ti-am pro gra-ti-à. 16. And we all have received and grace for grace. 17. Nam il-la Lex da-ta est per Mo-sen; gra-ti-a & ve-ri-tas prae-sti-ta est per Je-sum Chri-stum. 17. For the Law was given by Moses; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 18. Ne-mo vi-dit De-um un-quam, il-le U-ni-ge-ni-tus fi-li-us, qui est in fi-nu Pa-tris, il-le ex-po-su-it no-bis. 18. No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten son who is in the bosom of the Fa∣ther, he hath set him forth to us
19. E-ti-am hoc est Te-sti-mo-ni-um Jo-han-nis, quan-do Ju-dae-i mi-serunt Sa-cer-do-tes & Le-vi-tas, ut in-ter-ro-ga-rent e-um, quis-nam ip-se es-set. 19. Also this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent Priests and Levites, that they might ask him who he was. 20. Et pro-fes-sus, ne-que ne-ga-vit, in-quam, profes-sus est se esse non il-lum Chri-stum. 20. And he confessed, neither denied, I say he confessed that he was not that Christ. 21. Tunc in-ter-ro-ga-ve-runt eum, er-go quid es? tu-ne es E-li-as? ve-ro ipse di-xit, sum non; & illi di-xe-runt, es tu ille Pro-phe-ta?
qui re-spon-dit non. 21. Then they asked him, therefore what art thou? art thou Elias? but he said, I am not; and they said, art thou that Pro∣phet? who answered no. 22. Er-go di-xe-runt ei, Quis es? ut de-mus re-spon-sum i-is qui mi-se-runt nos; quid di-cis de te-ip-so? 22. Therefore they said to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them who have sent us; what sayest thou of thy self? 23. A-it, e-go sum vox vo-ci-fe-ran-tis in de-fer-to, com-pla-na-te vi-am Do-mi-ni, pro-ut I-sai-as Pro-phe-ta di-xit. 23. He said, I am the voice of one crying in the desert, make straight the way of the Lord, as Isaias the Prophet hath said. 24. Ve-rò qui fu-e-rant mis-si, e-rant ex Pha-ri-sae-is. 24. But they which had been sent, were of the Pharisees.
Here is enough for the Ingenious for a begin∣ning; then go to the 25th verse in the Latin Testament, and English it by an English Bible printed in King James his Reign, and find the English of some hard words in a Dictionary, be perfect in one verse before you go to ano∣ther, and so by use, which is the Mother of Language (as the Schoolmen say) you may be as perfect in the Latin Tongue, as Travellers learn Languages, (and a little time will perfect you, when you desire to learn the rules of the Tongue) and indeed few retain more than En∣glishing the latin Bible (after 7 years Schooling;) see that you be perfect in Reading latin words, and for the obtaining of which mind, these latin words, which follows. Note, That every verse you learn, write it like the verses as before, which will imprint it in the memory very much. Latin Words divided.

If one pound of any thing cost 6 d. what wi one hundred weight cost (that is 112 l.) at th same rate, without pen and ink. Do thus, saying in 6▪ d. is 24 farthings, doub it, and it is 48, the which call 48 Shilling lastly, 24 groats is 8 shillings, being added. Thus 48 half farthings in 6 d. reckon 48 8 being the Groats, for farthings in 6 d.-8 Answ. 56 Do thus for any other price. How to cast up Sums of Mony by Counters, or f things, very useful for those that never learned write figures. First, make three marks or choaks upon Table about three inches asunder, like the Then let the first mark be supposed to be place of pounds, the second the place of S∣lings,
and the third next the right hand the place of pence; (and you may make another if you will for the place of farthings.) Secondly, now to place your several Sums to be cast up, as suppose I begin with 3 l. 7 s. 3 d. lay down as many Counters at each mark thus, And when you put another Sum to this, as suppose 17 s. with the 7 s. already makes 24 s. then set one Counter more in the place of pounds, and leave but 4 in the place of shil∣lings, and your sum is 4 l. 4 s. 3 d. and so add more at pleasure. Lastly, but if you are to cast up several Sums that are pounds, without shillings, or pence; then mark upon the Table 4 marks as before. These being so easy, I need not write much, for further directions, observing the four pla∣ces. Read them thus, the three Counters next the
left hand, stands for three thousand, next two hundred, next four tens, or forty, and three at the last, that is 3243. Thus you may make the Sum bigger or lesser as you please, even from one pound, to thou∣sands. So I hope that whoever can do it, will not grudge to teach their Neighbours near them (if they desire it) Gratis.
How to divide a square into two parts, according to any proportion assigned, by a Line drawn parallel to one of the sides. square divided into two parts LEt the figure be A, B, C, D, containing 676 Poles, and it is required to cut off 208 Poles, with a Line parallel to D C, to be aid out next unto the same. First, divide 208 by 26, and the Quotient will be 8, the which distance set from D to E, nd from C to F.
How to divide a Triangle into tw parts. SUppose, that this Triangle is 8 Acres, an it is required to draw a Line from A, divide it into 5 Acres, and three Acres. triagle divided into two parts The longest side being 40, work thus, say∣ing,
So 25 of the base or longest, cut at D, and draw the Line A D, and 15 for the other side. How to divide a Triangle into 5 equal parts, from a point given. triangle divided into 5 parts SUppose the given point be at D, first divide the longest side of the Triangle into 5 qual parts, and draw paralleld doted Lines om each part, then from the given point D, raw Lines to divide it, as in the Triangle.
To divide a common field into as m∣ny parts, as shall be required. SUppose a Common of Pasture for the use three men, as A, B, C, and it is agreed  them all, that each man shall have his Propo∣tion of Ground laid out, according to the qua∣tity of his Commons in the same place. First, measure the whole field, and if it co∣tain 35 a. 3 r. 15 p. or 5735 p. then confid how many Beast-Gates, or Cow-Commons the are in the Pasture, and divide the quantity  the field to them according to the Rule  Proportion, or Rule of Three, in page 1 saying, If the whole number of Beasts-gates,  Commons of A, B, and C, give the who quantity 5735 p. what shall the number of the belonging to A be, and the Answer will be  part: So work the parts for B, and C, and t part of A be 1817, to B 1716, to C 22 poles. The field being drawn into a Plot, on ∣per, divide every mans part by the Geomet∣cal Problems in this Book, and also by the h of the Table in page 188.
How to make a Triangle which shall contain any number of Acres, Roods, and Poles. SUppose I make a Triangle, that shall con∣tain 5 Acres, 2 Roods, and 30 Pole, or 10 Poles, whose base or longest side must be 0 Poles. how to make a triangle First, double the number of Poles, and they make 1820, the which divide by 50, and the Quotient will be 36 2/5, the length of the per∣pendicular
D, B, then from the Line of equa parts in page 164. lay down the Line A, B, equal to 50 Poles, then upon B, raise the per∣pendicular B, D, equal to 36 2/5 poles, draw the Line C, D, parallel to A, B, then from the poin E, draw the Line E A, and E B, including the Triangle A E B, which contains 5 Acres 2 Roods, and 30 Poles, as was required. Note, by the same Rule you may lay out a bigger or lesser. Quadrant, in page 148. VVHen you make a Quadrant in Wood. First, That it may be perfect square at the Center make a square on a piece of paper by the example in p. 162. Secondly, Let not the uppermost Arch line be so near the Center, as the printed Qua∣drant is. Thirdly, And let the division on the right, edge of the Quadrant, between the two arches marked 12, be divided into 14 equal parts, whereas this is 19. Fourthly, Then from the over arch M, to A▪
or April set of 6 parts, every part supposed to be 5 days, & from A. to M. or May six parts more, & the remaining 2 parts serve for June, and December. Fifthly, Instead of a Bead, a pins head may serve. Lastly, To place the rest of the hour lines draw out the string to the degrees of the Qua∣drant, and mark for the hours according to the Table; and draw arch lines for hour lines like the 12 a clock line. Of the Moons Influence. VVHereas I have mentioned in p. 181. of cutting the Hair, the Moon in∣creasing, &c. It was rather of custom, then any belief I have in it (being all power is in God, that a hair of our Head perisheth not without his good will, &c. Mat. 10.30.) and though the tide, and some other things happen∣eth monthly, the power is only to be attributed to the providence of God, and not to any crea∣ted thing (though all his works are good in their places;) for God will not give his Glory to another neither would he have man to look up unto the Stars to Idolize them, least they give that pow∣er to them, that belongs to God only, Deut. 4.19. And John Gadbury writes of the Moon thus,
The more she fills her forked round. The more the marrow doth in bones abound. So that by his reason the marrow in the bones also decreaseth, as the Moon decreaseth;The Moon was worsh∣iped throughout all A∣sia, and in great esteem among the Ephesians, whence arose that cry; Great is Diana of E∣phesians, Act. 19.28, Macrob, Saturnal, lib. 1. c. 15. The Sun and Moon (saith Godwyn, p. 199) which are the greater lights in the Heaven, I take to have been the chiefest Idols worshiped by the Hea∣then people, notwith∣standing their blind devotion deified also the other Planets, &c. of this nature are these Chambers of Imagery Ez. 8.9. and some are of opinion that the flow∣ing of the Sea is caused by the Moons warmness when she comes to the South; others hold that the fire hid in subter∣raneous stones, in the Sea and Earth, and Saltness of the water, makes it as it were to boyl, &c. And to manifest what Spi∣rit this Astrologer J. G. is of, by his skill in the Stars saith in his Astrological Observations in Jan. 1681. The pretence of passive o∣bedience is too stale a cheat to be any longer swallow∣ed, the Law was made to be obeyed, not to be oppo∣sed by a pretence of suffe∣ring; and Traitors, Thieves and Murtherers when pun∣ished for their misdeeds, are as passively obedient, as the Non-conforming Bro∣ther. Answer; As to Traitors, Swearers, Drunkards, &c. we know it belongs to the Magistrates to punish, be it in whom it will, but the Non-conforming Brother, (be he a just man) he shall be numbred amongst Transgressors, as the Righ∣teous have been in former
Ages saying we have a law, &c. Joh 19.7. And so would punish the Righteous, (with the wicked, or in∣stead of the wicked) that cannot but obey God rather then man, as Peter and John did, Acts 4.4. & 5, 28, 29. If mans law command, not to meet, and speak no more in the name of Jesus (but when and where we appoint) shall we o∣bey God or Man, judge ye, that are not of Cains Race, Gen. 4.5, 8. For he slew his Brother, be∣cause his Brothers Sacrifice was accepted, &c. One would think that the Magistrates might think themselves happy, that God hath placed them as outward Governors, to be a terror to evil doers, and also to have a people under their Righteous Government, that delight in the Law of God, and what the Law of God is, and the fruits, thereof, see Psal. 19.7 to 12. Mat. 7.12. & 22.37.38. John 13.34. Heb. 8.10. Rom. 7.22. & 8. 1 James 2.8. To the young learners of Arithmetick. FIrst, Learn to write and read figures, in p. 24. Secondly, Addition in p. 193.33. Thirdly, Substraction in p. 193.58.36. Fourthly, Multiplication in p. 54.193, 187. Fifthly, Division in p, 194.171. Sixthly, Reduction in p. 168.197.34.35, Seventhly, Golden Rule, or Rule of 3, in p. 158, &c. Be perfect in one Rule before you go
to another, (by the much writing them over) So that when you have learned the 7 Rules a∣foresaid, you may easily understand (in a little time) all the other questions in this Book (though no man teach you) if you live in the fear of God, which is to depart from iniquity, and it is also the beginning of wisdom, Job. 28.28. So will God teach you to profit, Isa. 48.17. So Dear Children, my Soul even longs for you, that ye may still keep in your first Inno∣cence (for none are the Children of wrath, but they who actually join themselves to the power, and Prince of the Air, Eph. 2.2. Rom. 4.15. Ezek. 18.20.) That you take not of the forbidden fruit of the evil of this world, for you will find that it is much better for you to remember your Creator, now in the days of your youth, Eccl. 12.1. For when once you are grown old in the custom of evil, you will find it hard returning into Innocence, into a Righteous Life. Therefore O dear Children apply your whole hearts to Gods Grace therein; it troubles you after you have been wild or wanton, or done a∣ny evil thing (though no man condemn you) and you will receive Gods Blessing, and your Parents Love: O prize this Grace above Gold, & all other the delights of this world, for if you obey it, it will lead you to a greater knowledge of Christ Jesus, who will be your Saviour from all sin, where you shall have durable Treasure, and possess it for evermore (much better than
to have your portion only in this life, Psal. 17.14. in the abundance of earthly Riches) to be a door keeper, or watcher here, Psal. 84.10. Un∣to this Grace of God, one day is better than a thousand elsewhere, and God your Father will give you your daily Bread, to nourish your Souls, Mat. 6, 11. Psal. 121.8. Kings must take Counsel at this Grace of God in their own hearts (the Gate of Wisdom, Pro. 8.34.) yea, and lay down their Crowns before it, (in which is the feet of Jesus) if they rule for God, Kings will be nursing Fathers to the Faithful thereunto, Isa. 49, 22, 23. Hasten this good day more and more, O Lord our God (which is already dawned) prayeth the Righ∣teous, for thy name sake that all people may give unto thee all Glory for ever, Amen. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. Who is a a wise man, and endued with knowledge amongst you, let him shew out of a good Conversation his works with meekness of Wisdom, Jam. 1.5. & 3.12. And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, he hold I set before you the way of Life, and the way of Death, Jer. 21.8. Deut. 30.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Rom. 10.8. FINIS.
