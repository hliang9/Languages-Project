All which His Majesty signifieth to all, and singular His Officers, Ministers, and loving Subjects of this His Realm, to the intent that they, and every of them who have, or shall have any suite, or other occasion to attend any of the said Courts of Chancery, Receipt of Exchequer, and of first Fruits and Tenths, Duchie of Lancaster, Court of Wardes, and Lyveries, and Court of Requests may give their attendance at the said City of Oxford as aforesaid, and not elswhere; and that such of them as have or shall have cause or commande∣ment to appear in any of His Majesties said Courts, of Kings-Bench, Common-Pleas, and Exchequer, at Westminster, in or at the said Return of Quin∣dena Paschae, or in or at any day or time from and after the said first day of the said Return of Quindena Paschae, and before the said Return of Quin∣que Septimanas Paschae, may tary at their Dwellings, or where their businesse otherwise shall lye, without resorting to any of the said Courts for that cause, before the said returne of Quinque Septimanas Paschae next comming, and that without danger of forfeiture, penalty or contempt, to incurr towards His Majesty in that behalfe. And neverthelesse His Majesties pleasure is, That two of His Instices, that is to say of either Bench, one shall the first day of the Term of Easter called Quindena Paschae, according to the ancient order of the Lawes, keep the Essoines of the said Quindena Paschae, at which Return of Quindena Paschae, Writs of Adjournment shall be directed to the said Iustices, giving them authority to ad∣journ part of the said Term of Easter, that is to say from Quindena Paschae untill the said Return of Quinque Septimanas Paschae as before is said, and the same Adjournment shall be made in the first day of the said Quindena Paschae, commonly called the day of the Essoines. Willing and Commanding all and every of His Majesties Officers, Ministers, and Subjects to whom it doth, or shall appertain, to observe, and keep their As∣semblies, and Appearances with all their Returns and Certificates in His Highnesse said Court at Westminster, in Quinque Septimanas Pascha next, then and there to be holden, and kept, and there to doe their offices and duties in every behalfe, in like manner and form as they should or ought to have done if this present Proclamation had not been had or made, as they will answer the contrary at their Perills. And whereas His Majestie hath by His Declaration in Print formerly declared to all His loving Subjects, That whosoever shall loose His life in this Service for His Majesties defence, the Wardship of his Heire shall be granted by His Majestie without fine or rent to his owne use: So His Majestie doth hereby farther declare, That whosoever shall loose his life in this service for His Majesties defence, the Lyvery or Ousterlemayne of his Heire being then of full age, shall be granted by His Majestie to such Heire without payment of any Primer seisin, Fine, Arrerages, or meane rates whatsoever. But as for those Heires within age or of full age, whose Ancestors were or shall be slaine in this Rebellious Warre against His Majestie, His Majesties pro∣ceedings in their Wardships and Lyveries shall be according to the strict rules of Iustice and not otherwise, of which His Majesties will and plea∣sure is, That all the Officers of His Majesties Court of Wards and Lyveries doe take notice.
