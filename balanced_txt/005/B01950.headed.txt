THE CATECHISME IN THE Book of Common-Prayer EXPLAINED. Quest. Is set before many of the longest and hardest Questions, &c. * Is a mark of Explanation. Question. WHat is your name? A. N. or M. Q. How many names have you? A. Two, a Christian, and a Sirname. Q. What may they put you in mind of? A. Of a twofold Parentage; Natural, and Spiritual. Q. Who are your Natural Parents? A. My Father and Mother. Q. Who are your Spiritual Parents? A. God and his Church. Q. Which of these two names are de∣manded of you? A. My Christian name.
Q. Why so? A. That by this name, I may be put in remembrance of my Baptism, wherein it was given me. Q. Why was your name given you in Baptism? A. That thereby I might be distinguish∣ed from other men, and that I might be put in mind, as often as I hear my name, of the Covenant then ratified between God and me. Q. VVho gave you this name? A. My Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptism, wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven. Q. What benefit did you then receive by Baptism. A. Three; First, I was made a mem∣ber of Christ: Secondly, the child of God: Thirdly, an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven. Q. What hath a Member relation unto? A. To a Body. Q. How many bodies hath Christ? A. Two, a Natural as we have, and a Mystical. Q. of which are you a member? A. Of his Mystical Body. Q. What Body is that? A. His Church. Col. 1.18.
Q. What is Christ to his Church? A. He only is the Head thereof. Q. What doth Christ the Head, for his Body the Church. A. He giveth it Spiritual Life, motion and direction, as a head doth to the body. Q. What must you feel in you, to be sure that you are a true member of Christ? A. That I live by him to God, am mooved by his Spiri, and directed by his Word. 2. Q. How are you made the child of God? A. By the Grace of Adoption. Q. How knowest thou, that thou art the child of God by Grace? A. Because he hath given the earnest of the Spirit into our hearts, crying Abba; Father, which Spirit witnesseth to our spirits, that we are the children of God. Rom. 8.15,16. Q. Is Baptisme of that virtue, that by the only outward washing thereof, every one is made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven. A. No, for unless a man be born again of water, and also of the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Hea∣ven. John 3.5. Q. Why then saist thou, that by Bap∣tism
thou art made a member of Christ? A. Because Baptisme is the laver of Regeneration by the power of the Spirit. * And therefore we may rightly say, that we are thereby made the Members of Christ, and the children of God; and be∣lieve the same touching all others that are baptized. Q. Why is it added, That we are In∣heritors of the Kingdom of Heaven? A. Because being sons by Adoption, we are heirs, and heirs of God, and heirs an∣nexed with Christ. Rom. 8.17. 1 Pet. 1.3,4. Q. What did your Godfathers and God∣mothers then for you? A. They did promise and vow thrée things in my name: First, That I should renounce the Devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of the wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh: Se∣condly, That I should believe all the Arti∣cles of the Christian Faith: And Thirdly, That I should keep Gods holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my life. 1. Q. How are you to renounce the Devil? A. By refusing to hearken to any of his wicked suggestions. Q. How are you to renounce the world?
A. By withdrawing mine affections from the honors, riches, pleasures and other contentments which the world affordeth, as they are a means to draw me from God. 1 John. 2.15. Q. How are you to renounce the lusts of the flesh? A. By denying satisfaction to my own natural desires and affections, so far as they are any way repugnant to the Word of God. Rom. 13.14. Q. Dost thou think that thou art bound to do as they have promised for thee? A. Yes verily, and by Gods help so I will; and I heartily thank our Heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this state of Salvation, through Iesus Christ our Saviour; And I pray God to give me his Grace that I may continue in the same unto my lives end. Q. Art thou able to perform all these things? A. Not of my self, but in some measure I am enabled thereunto by Gods Grace. Phil. 4.13. Q. What dost thou chiefly learn out of the Articles of your belief? A. First, I learn to believe in God the Father, who hath made me and all the world. Secondly, in God the Son, who hath redéemed me and all mankind.
Thirdly, in God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifieth me and all the elect people of God. 1. Q. What is God? A.

Man consists of Body and Soul; the first mans body was made of the dust of the earth, but our Bodies come by ge∣neration, and are with his mortal; and both his and all our Souls by inspiration, and are immortal. Q. How can our Souls be sinful, that come not by propagation, but by inspira∣tion? A. 1. For that Adams Soul was deputy for all Souls of men naturally begotten. 2. Because man sinned, and man is not man, before body and soul be knit toge∣ther which being conjoyned become toge∣ther as man, partakers of mans fall, and corruption.
Q. In what state was man first created? A. In the Image of God, that is to say, holy and righteous, enjoying the favour of God and all happiness. Gen. 1.27 Eph. 4.14 Q. How did man fall from this estate, that is, deface the Image of God, and lofe his favour? A. By the transgression of our first Pa∣rents, who eating of the forbidden fruit both themselves, and in them all mankind became first guilty of eternal death, and li∣able both to temporal and spiritual mise∣ries; Secondly deprived of original righ∣teousness; Thirdly, corrupt in every part and faculty both of soul and body, which deprivation and corruption received in and from them is called Original sin.

Qu. Was God so angry, that he would curse man for eating an Apple, or such like?
A. That was not the matter of Gods anger, but his unthankfulness, pride, dis∣obedience, and crediting rather the Devil then God. 2. Q. Who redeemed you, that is, deli∣vered you from eternal death, and recon∣ciled you unto God? A. Iesus Christ the Son of God. Q. By what means did Christ redeem you? A. By suffering death upon the Cross for my sins, and the sins of the whole world. 1 John 2.2. Q. How could he suffer death, seeing he was the Son of God? A. He took upon him the nature of man, that is, an humane body and soul, and therein suffered death upon the Cross for our redemption. Heb. 2.16. Heb. 10.5. 1 Pet. 3.18. 3. Q. Who sanctified you? A. The Holy Hhost. 1 Cor. 6.11. A. A work of the Holy Ghost, by which such as are redeemed are made holy and become new creatures, and enabled to do good and holy works. 1 Ths. 4.3. John 15.3. Q.

John 4.24. Q. What is the word of God, which doth prescribe the manner of Gods wor∣ship? A. The word of God is contained in those Books which are called the Canoni∣cal Scriptures. Q. Why are they called Canonical? A. Because they are the Canons, that is, the rules of Gods worship, according to the which, men must frame their faith and manners. Isa. 8.20. Psal. 119.9. Q. How do you know that every part
of the Scripture was delivered by Divine Inspiration, and so is indeed the Word of God? A. By many firm arguments, but espe∣cially six. 1.

What is the ground of Faith? A. The frée promises of God made in Christ, concerning the forgiveness of sins, and eternal righteousness. Rom. 4.18. Heb. 11.1. I. Arti. Q. why do you say, I believe, and not, we believe? A. Because another mans prayer may help me, but it must be mine own, and not another mans Faith that must save me. Q. What is the meaning of this, I be∣lieve in God? A. I believe him to be my God, and put my whole trust and confidence in him. Rom. 10.11.
Q. Why is God called the Father? A. Because he is the Father of all by creation, and of Christ by nature and e∣ternal generation; and in him my Father I being one of Christs members. Q.

Q. Whereof did God create the world? A. Of nothing, to shew his might and power by his Word. Heb. 11.3. Q. In what time made he the world? A. In six days, that we might more par∣ticularly consider of the creatures. Q. When made he man? A. Last of all, because he was made Lord of all, and might find all things rea∣dy for him Gen. 1.26. II. Art. Q. Why is Christ called Je∣sus? A Because he saveth his people from their sins, neither is there salvation in any other. Mat. 1.21. Acts 4.1. Q.

Q. VVhat benefits hast thou by the offices of Christ?
A. Both I and all the elect people of God, are made spiritual Kings, Priests, and Prophets. 1. Kings in bearing rule over our own hearts, and mastering our rebellious thoughts, wills, and affections, Rom. 6.12. 2. Priests in offering up to God our spiritual Sacrifices of Prayer, of Thanksgiving, of Almes, of a contrite heart, of our own souls and bodies, for the service of God. Psal. 141.2. Heb. 14.15,16. Phil. 4.18. Psal. 51.17. Rom. 6.13. & 12.1, 3. Prophets in applying that know∣ledge we have, to the benefit and good of others. Luke 22.32. Q. Why is Christ called the only Son of God, since we also are the Sons of God? A. He is the Son of God by nature, and by eternal generation, we are the sons, of Gods by Grace, and by Adoption. John 1.14. Rom. 8.15. Gal. 4.5. Q. What do you learn from hence that Jesus Christ is the Son of God by nature? A. I learn to my comfort, that he is ve∣ry God; and that therefore whatsoever was performed and suffered by him, is in∣finitely meritorious for our salvation. John 1.14. Col. 2.19. Q. Why is Jesus Christ called our Lord? A. Because having redéemed our souls from sin and Satan, he doth challenge us as his own to do him service. Rom. 14 8,9.
III. Art. Q. How was Christ conceived by the Holy Ghost? A. In that his humane nature was su∣pernaturally framed by the powerful working of the Holy Ghost in the womb of the Virgin. Lke 1,35. Q. Why was he conceived by the Holy Ghost? A. To sanctifie the séed of the woman, and to unite two natures in one person, God and man in one Christ, Luke 1.35. Rom. 9.5. 1 Tim. 2.5. Q. Why must our Saviour be both God and Man? A. He must be a man, because man had sinned, and therefore a man must die for sin to appease Gods wrath; he must be God to sustain and uphold the Manhood, to overcome and vanquish death. 1 Tim. 2.5,6. Q. What learn you out of these words, which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary? A. I learn: 1. By his birth that he was man, that so he might suffer for my sin. 2. By the manner of his conception by the Holy Ghosh, that he was without all manner of sin, and so the Sacrifice of him∣self being most pure, it was precious for our redemption.
IV. Art. Q. VVhat was Pontius Pilat that condemned Christ? A. He was at that time the Governo of Judea, under the Roman Emperor. Luk 3.1. Q. VVhat death did Christ suffer? A. The death of the Cross, Q. VVhy suffered Christ the death of the Cross, rather then any other kind of death? A. 1. Because that kind of death was most shameful. 2. It was most painful, 3. Thereby he took upon him the curse, to free me from the curse of the Law. Gal. 3.13. Q. Seeing Christ hath thus died for us, why yet must Gods Saints die? A. Not as a satisfaction or penalty for sin, but for two special benefits: First, for that sin is thereby abolished in my na∣ture, Rom. 6.7. Secondly, death is made an entrance for our souls into Life eternal. Phil. 1.23. Q. Could the sufferings of Christ, which were but a short time, countervail ever∣lasting damnation, and so appease Gods wrath? A. Because Christ, who was God suffer∣ed; though not in his Godhead; and that is more, then if all the men in the world
had suffered for ever. Acts 20.28. Q. VVhat followed upon his death? A. His burial and descending into hell, that is, his subjection to the power and do∣minion of death, and the grave for a time. Heb. 2.14. Acts 2.24. Q. Why did he abide thus under the power of death and the grave? A. That it might be certainly known that he was dead, and that the body of sin might be utterly destroyed and abolished in us for ever. Rom. 6.6. V. Art. Q Was it needful that Christ being dead, should rise again? A, Yes it was for his own glory and our good. Q. How for his glory? A. That being formerly abased as a ser∣vant, and crucified as a sinner, he might thus be declared to be the Son of God, and exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour. Rom. 1.4. Acts 5.30,31. Q. How for our good? A. That having paid the price of our re∣demption by his death, we might have good assurance of our Iustification by his Life. Rom. 4.25. Q. Why did Christ rise again the third day? A. Because it was prophesied of him,
that he should see no corruption. Acts 2.27. Q. Why did he not rise before the third day? A. Lest rising so presently upon his death, his enemies might take occasion to cavil that he was not dead. Mat. 27.63. Q. Why would he not put it off untill the fourth day? A. Lest the Faith of his Disciples should have been weakened, and their hearts too much cast down and discouraged. Luke 24.21. Q. What learn you out of the 5th. Article, the third day he rose again from the dead? A. 1. That he is risen and hath over∣come death and Hell for my Iustification. 1 Cor. 15.17.7. 2. I learn to rise from sin, and to delight in righteousness. Rom. 6.4. 3. By his rising I am assured that my body shall rise again. 1 Cor. 15.16. VI Art. Q. Why did Christ ascend into Heaven? A That he might triumph more glori∣ously over his and our enemies, and make way for our ascention thither. Eph. 4.8. John 14.2.3. Q. What is meant by Christs sitting at the right hand of God? A. 1. The honour that God hath given him. Heb. 1.3.
2. His exercising of the Sovereign power which he hath, as he is our Mediator over all the world. Eph. 1.20,21. VII. Art. Q. What learn you out of the Seventh Article, from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead? A. 1. I learn to my comfort, that he that is my Saviour, shall be my Iudge. Job 19. verse 25. 2. To the terror of the wicked and un∣godly, that he shall be their Iudge, whom they have refused and despised. 2 Thes. 1.8. Q. Who are the quick and the dead that are to be judged by Christ? A. All men that ever were from the be∣ginning, are, or shall be to the end of the world, whether they shall be alive then, or dead before. Q. Why doth Christ defer his coming? A. He waiteth till the number of the elect be accomplished, till the measure of iniqui∣ty be fulfilled, till his enemies be all sub∣dued and abolished. Rev. 6.11. Mat. 13.30. Heb. 10.13. Q. What need is there that the dead should be brought to Judgment, seeing particular judgment was given of them before, whether they be good or evil? A. It is needful for two causes. 1. Be∣cause the first judgment pertains only to
the soul, but the latter to the whole man, both body and soul. 2 Cor. 5.10. 2. That that particular Iudgement may be made manifest before all men, and that there may be a more manifest declaration of Gods just judgment. Rom. 2.5. VIII. Art. Q. What is the Holy Ghost▪ A. The third person in the Trinity, e∣qual in majesty and glory to the Father and the Son, and joynly proceeding from them both. Acts 5.3,4. John 15.26. Q. Ghost is an old English word, and signifies Spirit, why is the third person called Spirit? A. 1. Because God is a Spirit (that is) an immaterial and pure essence. John 4.24. 2. Because the Holy Ghost is the Spirit and breath of God, blowing freely where it listeth, and working spiritually for man∣ner, means and matter where it pleaseth. John 3.8. Acts 2.2,3,4. Q. Why is the third person called holy? A. Not only because of his essential ho∣liness as God, but because he is the author and worker of holiness in men. 1 Cor. 6.11. IX. Art. Q. Why do you say, I believe the Church, not in the Church? A. We do believe that there is a Church, but we do not believe in the Church, but in
God; the Church here below at the best, is but a company of men called, justified, sanctified in part, and therefore may erre. Q. What is it then to believe the Church? A. 1. That there is and always shall be a Church. 2. That I am one of the Church. 3. To believe the doctrine of the Church, wherein it followeth Christ, the Prophets and Apostles, the onely sure pillars and ground of truth. Q. How many sorts of Churches are there? A. Two sorts, Triumphant and Mili∣tant. Q. What is the Church Triumphant? A. The company of Gods children in Heaven. Heb. 12.23. Q. VVhy is it so called? A. Because they are all out of danger and so do triumph. Rev. 21.4. Q. VVhat is the Church Militant? A. The company of Gods Children here on Earth. Q. Why are they thus called? A. Because they fight the Lords battles against the world, the flesh, and the Devil. 2 Tim. 2.3. Eph. 6.12, Q. What Church is here meant? A. The Church Militant. Q. What do you learn hence?
A. That God hath a Church, and will have to the end of the world. Q. Is there but one Church? A. No, there is but one true Church of Christ, though there may be many parti∣cular visible Churches, which are parts thereof; yet there is but one Catholick and Vniversal Church, of which not one shall be lost, and out of which not one shall be saved. Eph. 5.23. John 17.12. Q. Why is it called Catholick or Uni∣versal? A. It is called Catholick or Vniversal, 1. In respect of time, because it hath been and shall be in all ages. Acts 2.39. 2. In respect of persons, it consists of all sorts of men, high and low, rich and poor. Acts 2.10,34. 3. In respect of place, it hath been gathered from all parts of the earth. Rev. 5.9. Rev. 7.9. Q. Why is the Church called Holy? A. Because it is made holy by justi∣fication in Christ, and Sanctification of the Spirit. Rom. 3.24. Cant. 4.7. Q. What is the Communion of Saints? A. That holy and sweet fellowship, which all the members of Christs Church have one with another; as they make all but one body in Christ, so communicating of all good things unto one another, whether spiritual or temporal, as their mutual ne∣cessities do require. 1 John 1.3. 2 Cor. 8.14.
Q. Why are all believers called Saints? A. Because they are partakers of Christs holiness, daily growing and in∣creasing in the same; And to let us know, that none shall be Saints in Heaven, but such as are first Saints on Earth. Heb. 12.10. 3 Cor. 7.1. Q. What duty doth this communion of Saints require of us? A. To renounce all fellowship with sin, and sinners, to edifie one another in Faith and Love, to delight in the society of the Saints, and to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. X. Art. Q. What is meant by the for∣giveness of sins? A. Forgiveness of sins is that great blessing of God, which Iesus Christ by his death and passion, procured for all that be∣lieve in him; whereby God esteems of their sins as no sins, or as never committed by them. Q. What duties are required of us, that find our sins pardoned? A. To sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto us; to forgive others, as God hath forgiven us; to renew our assurance by prayer, repentance and new obedi∣ence?
XI. Art. Q. What professest thou to believe in the eleventh Article, The re∣surrection of the body? A. That the bodies of the wicked shall be raised by the power of Christ, as he is Iudge, and joyned to their souls, so to con∣tinue together without separation for e∣vermore in the torments of Hell; but the bodies of the faithful, and so mine among others, shall be raised by virtue of Christs resurrection, to enjoy in body and soul to∣gether life everlasting. 1 Cor. 15.20. 1 Thes. 4.14,16. John 5.28,29. XII. Art. Q. What is life everlasting? A. That glorious estate of absolute ho∣liness and happiness in the Heavens, which all the elect shall for ever enjoy with Christ in the presence of God and his Angels. 1 Thes. 4.17. Q. What assurance have we of this estate? A. It is prepared by the Father, purcha∣sed by the Son, confirmed by the Holy Ghost, entred upon here, and inherited hereafter. Mat. 25.34. Eph. 1.13,14. Col. 1.5. 1. Pet. 1.3,4,5. Q. What profit dost thou get by believ∣ing all these things? A. 1. By this means I am justified be∣fore God, even by faith alone in Christ. Acts 13.39. Phil. 3.9.
2. By faith I shall overcome the ene∣mies of my Salvation. 1 John 5.4. 3. Being justified and overcomming, I shall inherit eternal life. Rom. 8.38. Tit. 3.7. Q. What is justification? A. It is Gods accepting and accounting of a sinner as guiltless, not for any righte∣ousness of his own, but upon the frée re∣mission of his sins and the imputation of Christs righteousness and obedience. Phil. 3.9. Rom. 3.24. Q. How is faith wrought and confirm∣ed in our hearts? A. 1. Inwardly by the Spirit, the foun∣tain of all Spiritual Graces. Acts 16.14. 1 Cor. 14.1,2. 2. Outwardly by the Word of God, which containeth the promises, the ground of Faith. Rom. 10.17. 3. By the Sacraments which are seals of those promises. Rom. 4.11. 4. By prayer, which addeth strength to Faith. Luke 17.5.
The Third Part of the CATECHISME, concerning the COMMANDEMENTS. Qu. HOw many Commandements are there? A. Ten. Q. Into how many Tables are the com∣mandements divided? A. Into two * and no more, because all righteousness is reduced to two Heads, namely towards God, or towards man. Mat. 22.39,40. Q. What doth the first Table concern? A. Our duty to God, contained in the four first Commandments. Q. What doth the second Table con∣cern? A. Our duty to our Neighbor, contai∣ned in the six last Commandments. Q. In this order of the Tables, that the Duty to God, is set before the duty to our neighbour, how many Lessons do you learn? A. 1. I learn to serve him before all thing, and not to regard worldly things, no nor life it self in respect of his glory. Mat. 6.33.
2. If I render my duty truly to God, I must do my duty also to my Neighbour, for if I neglect it to my neighbour, whom I see daily, it is evident that I do so to God. 1 John. 3.17. Q. How many Lessons learn you out of the Preface or Introduction to the com∣mandements, God spake these words and said; I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage? A. Four; 1. In that it is said, God spake these words, I learn that God is the Author of them. 2. In that it is said, I am the Lord, I learn that he hath authority to command and power to punish the breakers of his Law. Mat. 10.28. 3. It that it is said, Thy God, I learn that we must obey, in regard of the Cove∣nant which we have made with him. Ezek. 11.20. 4. In that it is said, Which brought thée out of Egypt, & learn that we must obey in regard of his mercy and goodness to∣wards us. Deut. 4.20. Luke 1.74. I. Command. Q.

To teach us to pray for others, as well as for our selves. Q. Why is God said to be in Henven? A.

who was frée from all sin, was tempted unto sin. Mat. 4.9. Q. How is God said to lead men into temptation? A. When he bringeth them into the lists with Satan, but especially when he leaveth them to themselves, to try it out by their own strength. Q. What is comprised under this word Evil? A. 1.

What doth the conclusion (For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever, Amen) contain in it. A. Arguments of assurance to the con∣science of him that prayeth, that he shall obtain that which is best for him; for, if

Q. Doth he not sometimes delay us, when yet he purposed to answer us? A. Yea, he doth. 1. Because he loves to hear the voice of his own spirit in us, Rom. 8.26,17. 2. Because the suit may be good, and yet the season not so meet for us. Acts 1.7, Luke 18.1. 3 He takes pleasure in our constancy, being a fruit of faith and fervency. Mat. 15.27,28. 4. Because such blessings as are won by long and strong prayer, are al∣ways estéemed very highly, received in humility, enjoyed in sobriety, and employ∣ed faithfully for mans good, and Gods glory. 1 Sam. 2.20,22. 1 Chron. 29.14,15.

The Fifth Part of the CATECHISME touching the SACRAMENTS. Qu. HOw many Sacraments hath Christ ordained in his Church▪ A. Two only as generally necessary to salvation, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord. Q. What difference is there between Baptisme and the Supper of the Lord? A. Besides the difference in the signs and Sacramental rites; there is this dif∣ference betwéen them: Baptism is a Sa∣crament of our new birth, of entrance into covenant with God, of Incorporation and engrafting into Christ, and of Admission into the Church of God; and therefore we are once only baptized. Tit. 3.5. Gen. 17.11. Rom. 6.3. But the Supper of the Lord is a Sacrament of confirmation of faith, of renewing Gods covenant with us, and of ours with God, and of further nourishing of our Souls to eternal life, and therefore we are often partakers of it. 1 Cor. 10.2,3,4. 1 Cor. 11,24,25,26.
Q. What necess  there of being partakers of the Sacrament of Baptisme? A. Not an absolute, but a respective ne∣cessity: For the Infants of believing pa∣rents dying unbaptized are not deprived of Salvation through Gods promise and mercy; yet it is required. 1. As a requisite means and instrument, the contempt whereof is fearful and dam∣nable in such as refuse or neglect it, where according to Gods ordinance it may law∣fully be had 2. In regard of our weakness, who have néed of all helps to strengthen our faith. Q. Are Infants to be baptized? A. Yes; 1 Because Children in the Law were circumcised. Gen. 17.12. 2. They have interest to the thing sig∣nified, the Kingdom of Heaven, much more to the sign. Mark 10.14. 3. All nations are bidden to be bapti∣zed, whereof Infants are a part. Mat. 28.19. Q. What meanest thou by this word Sacrament? A. I mean an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual Grace, given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.
Q. Why is Christ the only Author of these Sacraments? A. 1. Because he is God, and the Author of salvation, and therefore he only may appoint the means as the Word and Sa∣craments. 2. Because Christ only can make the Sacraments effectual by his Spirit. 3. Because his heavenly wisdom knew best, how and whereof to institute the Sa∣cramental signs or elements. 5. Because Christ is the only Lord, to whose Laws alone the Church is, and may be tyed. Q. How many parts be there in a Sa∣crament? A. Two, the outward visible sign, and the inward spiritual grace. Q. What is the outward visible sign in Baptism? A. Water, wherein the person baptized is dipped or sprinkled with it. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Q. What is the inward and spiritual grace? A. A death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, for being by nature born in sin, and the children of wrath, we are thereby made the children of grace. Q. Why hath Christ ordained Bap∣tism?
A. That being out of Christ by nature, we might by the Sacrament of our new birth be engrafted into his Mystical body again. Tit. 3.5, John 3.5. Q. What instruction doth the Sacra∣ment of Baptism teach us? A. As by water the filthiness of the flesh is washed and done away, so by the vertue of Christs blood, the filthiness of the soul should be washed away. * For the blood of Christ that is the force of his death, and the Spirit of Christ, serve to cleanse the soul of a right receiver of Bap∣tism, from the filthiness of sin. 1 John 1.7. Ezek. 36.25. Q. What is required of persons to be Baptized? A. Repentance, whereby they forsake sin: and faith, whereby they stedfastly be∣lieve the promises of God, made to them in that Sacrament. Q. Why then are Infants baptized, when by reason of their tender age they cannot perform them? A. Yes, they do perform them by their sureties, who promise and vow them both in their names, which when they come to age, themselves are bound to perform. Q. What other reason can you shew, why Infants are baptized, seeing they do not yet actually believe?
A. Because the covenant and pro∣mises of God do belong unto them. Gen. 17.7. Acts 2.38. Mat. 19.14. Rom. 11.16. Q. Seeing we are baptized only in In∣fancy, how hath Baptism ffect to wash away sins afterwards commted? A. Baptism hath this effect during our whole life, and is a perpetual fountain e∣ver washing us, while we with a lively faith do look unto the shedding of Christs blood. Zach. 13.1. Heb. 10.10,14. Q. Why was the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ordained? A. For the continual remembrance of the Sacrifice of the death of Christ, and the benefits we receive thereby. Q. Why is it called the Lords Supper? A. Because Christ ordained it at his last Supper. Q. What is the outward part or sign of the Lords Supper? A. Bread and Wine, which the Lord hath commanded to be received. Q. Why be there two representing signs in the Sacrament of the Lords Sup∣per? A. 1. That we might know that in Christ we have whole and perfect spiritu∣al nourishment, and whatsoever is requi∣site to Salvation.
2. For a more lively representation of his death and passion, wherein his body and blood were separated. Q. What is the duty of the Minister in the administration of the Sacrament? A. To consecrate it, by declaring the institution thereof; and prayer joyned with thanksgiving, as also to break the Bread, and afterwards to deliver the Bread and Wine to the people. Q. What is hereby signified? A. The action of God the Father, offer∣ing Christ to all, and bestowing him effe∣ctually upon the worthy receiver. 1 Cor. 10.16. Q. What is the duty of the receiver? A. To receive the Bread and Wine delivered, and to eat and drink thereof. Mat. 26.26,27. 1 Cor. 11.23,24. Q. What is signified hereby? A. Our receiving and féeding upon Christ by faith. Q. What is the inward part or thing signified. A. The Body and Blood of Christ, which are verily and indéed taken and received of the faithful in the Lords Sup∣per. Q. By what means do we eat Christs Body, and drink his Blood in the Sacra∣ment?
A. Spiritually by faith, while in those outward signs, we do behold Christ cruci∣fied for us. John 6.35,47.  Christ is truly and spiritually present in the Sacrament, exhibited to the faith of every worthy re∣ceiver, but not corporally united to the bread and wine in respect of place. Acts 3.21. compared with Mat. 28.6. John 16.18. Q. Is the bread and wine turned into the Body and Blood of Christ? A. No, for so, 1. the unbelievers should eat Christs Body, and drink his Blood. 2. We should destroy the nature of the Sacrament, by taking away the outward sign. 3. We should destroy the truth of his natural body, by depriving it of the true properties thereof. Heb. 2.17. Q. What difference is there between our common bread and wine, which we receive for our bodily sustenance, and the bread and wine in the Sacrament? A. There is no difference in their na∣ture and substance, but only in the use and end; * for that, elements before common, are now consecrated to the signs of things spiritual and holy; And therefore they are called holy Mysteries, because they lively set forth and seal unto us, the Mystery of our redemption purchased by Iesus Christ. Q. What are the benefits, whereof we are partakers thereby?
A. The strengthening and refreshing of our souls by the body and blood of Christ, as our bodies are by the bread and wine. Q. In respect of this benefit? What is the Lord Supper? A. It is a Sacrament, whereby our continuance, nourishment and growth in Christ is sealed unto us. Q. What special benefits shall we have by receiving the holy Communion? A. 1. We have hereby communion and fellowship with Christ (and through him with the Father) set forth by our ta∣king, eating, and inward digesting the bread and wine, that become nourishment unto us, and are united to the substance of our bodies. 2. Communion with one another and with all the faithful in all ages, set forth by the same bread, being made of many grains of Corn, and by the same wine made of many grapes. 3. Strength of faith for the death of Christ received and applyed by faith in the Sacrament, doth strengthen our faith, and comfort our consciences in the pardon of our sins. 4. All other graces and blessings are thereby conveyed unto us; And all the marits of Christs passion. and whatsoever is in him, is verily become ours. Rom. 8.38.
Q. What is required of them that come to the Lords Supper? A. To examine themselves whether they repent them truly of their, former sins, stedfastly purposing to lead a new life▪ have a lively faith in Gods mercy through Christ, with a thankful remembrance of his death, and be in charity with all men. Q. That a man may know how to ex∣amine himself, what is he to know touch∣ing the Lords Supper? A. He must be able to discern the Lords Body. Q. How is the Lords body discerned? A. Two ways: 1. In our understan∣ding, when we know what this Sacra∣ment is, the Author, the end and use there∣of. 2. In our practice. Q In how many things ought every one principally to examine himself? A. In thrée things. 1 Faith. 2 Repen∣tance. 3. Charity. Quest. What faith is here required of you? A. A special and peculiar faith, that ap∣plyeth to my soul and conscience, the body and blood of Iesus Christ, crucified and shed for me, as truly as my mouth recei∣veth the bread that is broken, and the wine that is poured out.
Quest. Why is faith required? A. Because well we may eat the bread, and drink the wine without faith, but we cannot eat Christs body, and drink his blood without faith. Q. What if a man find himself weak in faith, and full of doubting. A. He must bewail his unbelief, pray for faith, séek to have his doubts resolved, and so receive to be further strengthened in believing, because the Sacraments are given us of God for the confirmation and strengthening of our faith. Mark 9.24. Judg. 6.37. A. Chiefly thrée things. 1. Confessi∣on that we acknowledge our selves sin∣ners. 2. Contrition, that we be heartily and sincerely sorry for our sins. 3. Purpose of amendment, that we fully resolve and purpose with our selves, never to commit them, nor the like again, but to lead the rest of our lives according to Gods holy Will and Commandments. Q Why is repentance so necessary? A. Because this Sacrament is the seal of the remission of sins in Christs blood, which cannot be had without repentance. Q. How many offices be there of love?
A. Thrée. 1 To do our neighbour no wrong. 2 To do him good if we can. 3 If he doth us wrong, to forgive him. Q. Why is charity so necessary? A. Because this Sacrament is a seal, as of our union with Christ, so of our Com∣munion and fellowship with our brethren the members of Christ. Q. Why ought every one to examine himself? A. 1.
