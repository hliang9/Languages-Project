¶How Broadas sone to the Soudan toke Croyne and slewe the kynge Tyber. SO befell it as fortune i wolde one of the thre sones came as ye wynde brought his nauy by grete tourment that he passed besyde Croyne in galy¦ce and there he came vp. So toke he the londe in a ba∣lyngere / and toke of the men aboute the ryuage. And whan he had taken them he asked of them who was lorde of that countre. And they answered & sayd that it was the reame of Galyce / and that kynge Tyber was kynge therof. Than asked the Sowdans sone what lawe they helde. And they answered & sayd the lawe of Ihesu cryst. Thā made he to withdrawe his nauy so as he wolde haue withdrawen hym fro the re¦alme & from the countre / & toke twelue shyppes and made theym to be ledde to the porte of the towne of Croyne & charged them that they sholde make them marchauntes of swet gommes & of spycery and of clothes of golde and of sylke. And than they sholde at euen go lye in the towne in theyr hauergeons vnder theyr gownes and aboute the poynt of the daye they sholde go vpon the walles of the gate towarde the see And that they sholde gee the gate & the walles and that they sholde helpe them to scale & to come vp in to the towne. And so as he had deuysed it was done So came the twelue vesselles / & made them marchaūtes and solde spycery & clothes of damaske & solde grete chepe ynough. And sythen the marchauntes lodged in the towne as nyghe the gate as they myght. And dyde make redy ryght good mete & made theyr hoost to soupe with them whiche thought none euyll nor no gyle / & whan they had well sported them they wente
to rest / & had take theyr poyntment  poynt of daye vpon the gate and deuysed theyr ordynaun∣ce. And whan tyme came they wente vpon the wal∣les / and at the same tyme the Soudanes sone whiche was named Broadas the fyrst sone of theym came to the fote of the wall with a grete nombre of ladders / & so wente vpon hyghe. And they aboue the wall drewe theym vp soo many that with in a lytell whyle there were vpon the walles more than a thousande and ga¦te the gate and the towne without ony gayn saynge / and dyde there moche harme. And syth assayled ye ca∣stell and there in was the kynge Tyber and hym they toke by strengthe / and ye kynge defended hym as mo∣che as he myght ryght vygorously / and he wolde ne∣uer yelde hym / and so longe he defended hym that he was deed and slayne and that was ryght moche har∣me / and the quene tho wente out by a posterne & had but a mantell wrapped aboute her / and went in to de¦serte. And an olde preest toke the kynges sone & .xiii. chyldren more with hym wihche he taught / and wen¦te out and ledde theym all and hydde theym in an ol∣de roche besyde a gardyne / and there were they two dayes without mete or drynke / & the olde preest whi∣che was called syr Denys had so grete drede whan ye chyldren wolde go out of ye caue he came tofore them / and sayd vnto theym goo not out yf ye wyll not dye / and so he withhelde theym two dayes but at the thyr∣de daye Ponthus sayd to hym mayster better it is to dy with swerde than to be enfamyned and to dye for hunger / for thenne sholde we be cause of oure dethe & homysydes of our selfe / & by auenture we sholde mo∣we fynde some remedy. The preest sayd that he had
moche leuer to dye of hunger than to fll in the daun¦ger of theyr enemyes handes / and trembled for drede and by strengthe Ponthus stete out of the caue he & his cosyn germayne Polydes and were apperceyued and ledde to the kynge Broadas whiche than named hym to be cleped kynge of the countre. And whan the kynge sawe these .xiii. chyldren whiche were meruay¦lous fayre he asked what children they were And pon¦thus answered and said yt they were chyldren whiche ye kȳge made to be nourysshed for goddes loue for to serue hym whā they were of greter age. And of what seruyse sayd Broadas. Syr sayd Ponthus that one sholde haue gouerned his grehoundes and the kȳges  houndes. And that other the gosshawkes  hawkes of the towre / and the other of nedes in the hall and in the chambres. O sayd the kyn¦ge clothed he his seruynge people so worthely as ye be clothed / ye seme to be grete lordes sones after the es∣tate I se you in. Syr sayd Ponthus we be but vaua∣soures and of small gentylmen comen. By mahowne I wote not what ye be / but of beaute ne of well spe∣kynge haue ye not fayled / but it behoueth that ye leue your lawe whiche is no thynge worth & take mahow∣nes lawe. And I shall do you moche good. And yf ye wyll not do it I shall make you to dye a myscheuous dethe now chuse whiche that ye wyll. Sothely sayd Ponthus of the dethe mowe ye well ordeyne to your pleasynge / but for to forsake our lawe for to take ma∣hownes ne shall we neuer do for to dye therfore. No sayd the kynge to the dethe be ye thenne come / so sayd he that they sholde dye an euyll dethe.
¶How a crysten knyght saued .xiiii. chyldren that is for to wete Ponthus and his thyrtene folowes in a shyppe vpon the see. THan sterte forth a crysten knyght whiche had take mahounes lawe for drede of deth / & had alwaye his herte to Ihesu cryst the whiche knyght ye kynge loued ryght moche and sayd. Syr I take the charge vpon me to delyuer you yf they wyl not byleue in mahoune I shall ordeyne for them in suche maner that neuer shall they hurte youre lawe. I praye you sayd the kynge bethynke you. And I take theym you to gouerne. Than went Ponthus & the other to haue be deed / but god remedyed theym / the knyght ledde them to his place & made them strongly aferde afore the kynge. And whā he was at his place he made his folkes to withdrawe them / and than asked of theym for to assaye them in this wyse / ye must byleue in ma∣houmet
or ye be but deed. And they answered & sayd they sholde neuer byleue vpon hym to dye therfore. And whan he sawe theym swere / he had ryght grete Ioye & asked them yf they had ete ony mete that daye and than he made them to ete & drynke for they had grete hunger. A sayd one of theym wherfore ete we syth that we shall go to the deth. Do waye quod Pon¦thus by the grace of god we shall lyue / yf it be to his pleasynge / & we shall hope in him / & he shall saue vs. Soo ete they & prayed our lorde to haue mercy vpon them. The knyght herde what Ponthus sayd & pray¦sed hym ryghte moche / and sayd in his herte that it sholde be grete pyte yf suche chyldren sholde dye / for they were meruayllous fayre & fayre spekynge. Soo departed he fro theym & sought a vessell & made to be put therin by nyght lyuynge for a moneth. And vpon the morowe full erly he ledde the chyldren to ye shyppe and set them therin / & set within it a crysten maryner whiche was prysoner with them and made him to be hydde with the lyuynge vnder ye hatche of the shyppe And whan the chyldren were in the shyppe he made the sayle to be lyfte vp / & the shyppe departed into ye hyghe see / & the maryner sterte out fro byneth & toke the gouernayle & asked them wheder they wolde go. And Ponthus sayd fayre frende syth god hath sente the to vs thanked be he / lede vs & brynge vs into the coūtre of Fraunce. And he answered & sayd he sholde And badde them no thȳge be abasshed / & tolde them how the knyght had made hȳ to be put in to ye shyppe by nyght tyme / & theyr lyuynge with hym Than said Ponthus fayre lordes knele we downe & thanke we god whiche hath done vs so moche good / & praye we
hym that all be at his pleasynge. And soo dyde all the chyldren / and were daye & nyght vpon theyr knees & sayd theyr prayers and theyr owres deuoutly & hadde theyr trust all onely in god. So leue we of ye thyrtene chyldren / and retourne to the knyght that had theym in to the shyppe. The knyght was called patryke / & he wente and tolde the kynge yt well was he auenged of the chyldren whiche wolde not byleue in mahowne How sayd the kȳge haue ye done. Syr sayd ye knyght ye shall neuer se them / for I haue set them in an olde shyppe without ony maner of lyuynge of the worlde. And within haue I made two or thre holes / and let drawe the sayle vp to the toppe whiche bare theym in to the see that neuer shall ye here tydynges of them. I wyll it well sayd the kynge for I haue dremed to nyght that I sawe the .xiiii. chyldren in a wood. And the fayre chylde whiche spake to me became a lyon / & deuoured me & hurte me so moche that I dyed as e semed / soo was I sore afrayed. Syr sayd the knyght that was but a dreme of that that be ye quyte. I wyll well sayd the kynge / than sayd the knyght vnto hym By mahoune I ought to coūseyll you truly / wherfore I rede you that none be put to the dethe / but he wyll defende hym / for ye haue made a fayre conquest / for this is the fayrest countre & the moost delectable that is. And who that sholde slee ye people the londe sholde be without fruyte. And men saye comynly / as moche auaylleth a myl that gryndeth nought / as an ouen ye baketh nought / lette euery man byleue in suche lawe as he wyll / but all the fortresses / and the countre that wyll not obey vnto you / and yelde trybute be they dys¦comfyted / and lete ye other lyue and labour / & ye shall
be as ryche as ye wolde / & ye shall be lorde of the coun¦tre and the ryche men whiche may be raunsoned that ben prysoners take theyr fynaunces / and by fayrenes drawe them to our lawe of mahoumet. Than sayd ye kynge / by mahoune ye counseyll vs truly. Gooth and serche the prysoners / and they that wyll not byleue in our lawe / be they trybutayrye & in seruage and yelde vnto vs trybute after theyr puyssaunce / and we put all the rule of our lawe in you. ¶How the knyght Patryke delyuered from pryson ye Erle Desture and ye other crysten men: THus was the knyght all gouernoure of theyr lawe of the prysoners / and of the ordynaunce of the countree. And the knyght whiche that toke no hede but to saue the crysten people and the countre to his power wente all aboute to serche the prysoners & putte theym to lyght raunsome after that he founde with them. And amonge the other prysoners he foū∣de the kynges brother of Galyce that was the erle of Desture whiche was hurte of two woundes but not to the dethe. So was he taught to whiche he was / & whan the knyght knewe hym he toke hym and ledde hym asyde in to a chambre they two alone & sayd vn∣to hym. Syr yf ye be the kynges brother I wote well ye haue grete desyre to saue the countre and the peo∣ple whiche is fall in grete caytyfnes and seruage tyll that Ihesu cryst sette remedy there to / soo saye I you in good fayth pryuely by youre good counseyll all the best remedy that I can or may I shall putte there to Thenne the erle hadde ryght grete Ioye to here speke of the name of Ihesu Cryste / and that he wolde the
auayle of the crysten people & sayd vnto hym syghyn¦ge ryght sore. Ryght swete syr I wote neuer yf ye say these wordes for to assaye me / but yf it pleased god ye youre herte wolde it as your mouthe sayth it I shol∣de than oure lorde. Than sayd the knyght vnto hym all his doynge and how he hadde be take in bataylle / and how for to refuse the dethe for to auayle vnto the prysoners of that batayle & to all crysten men / he had feyned too be a Sarrasyn and bare the sygne but his herte was alwaye in Ihesu cryste. And he tolde hym how he hadde saued .xiiii. chyldren / and how he hadde doo so moche to the paynym kynge that none sholde no more be putte to the swerde. And that euery man sholde holde his lawe and yelde trybute and be in ser∣uage to the kynge. And that he had do tyll god wolde sette remedy therto & how he had be charged to raū∣some the prysoners. Than the erle kneled doune and thanked god wepynge▪ And the knyght toke hym vp & than clypped they togyder & kyssed wepynge & thā¦ked Ihesu Cryste. And whan they had longe weped of pyte than sayd they that god had assembled theym for to do some good to ye people whiche were in waye to be dede & destroyed. And syr patryke sayd. Swete syr I thynke yet ye god shall haue mercy on this coun∣tre and of the people / & it behoueth to haue the more space to speke togyder and to ordeyne ye comyn good and profyte of the crysten people that ye feyne you to be a sarrasyn as I am / & the kynge shall haue ryght gree ioye therof / & I shall saye it vnto hym / & yf god wyll we shall sette suche ordynaunce vpon it that it shall be profytable in a bydynge the mercy of god / & I shall tell you what myn herte sayth me. Myne hert
sayth me that the chyldren whiche I haue saued shal yet relyeue this coūtre agayne & also the kynge tolde me suche a dreme. And than he tolde hym of the .xiiii. chyldren and how ye gretest became a lyon and deuo∣red hym· A sayd the erle how moche ye ease my poore herte for that is my neuewe and my sone whiche god them lede as myne herte wylleth and desyreth. Thā swore they felowshyp togyder to endure togyder in good or in euyll and kyssed them togyder with alyaū∣ce of loue / and so had they deuysed togyder of the ru∣le and of the comyn profyte / & vpon that syr patryke departed and came to the kȳge and sayd vnto hym. Syr ye ought to thāke mahowne of his grace for I haue conuerted the kynges brothers herte of this coū¦tre that is the erle of Desture / he shall be of our Ma∣hownes lawe. And we shall make you to haue ye gre∣te trewes & the grete honour of this countre / so shall he & I ryde tofore the townes & we shall speke to the cytezeyns and barons & to theym whiche wyll obeye ye shall take to mercy & the other shall be punysshed. The kynge had ryght grete Ioy of this and made ye kynges brother to come before hym and made theyr alyaunce togyder. And the kynge rode tofore the tow¦nes and fortresses with well a thyrty thousande fy∣ghtynge men so that all the coūtree was full of them the ende was that all the coūtree sholde be trybutary and yelde trewe vnto the kynge. So dyde they there ryght grete thynges whiche sholde be to longe to tell. And I passe forth for to abredge this mater and leue to speke of ye kynge whiche reygned there well abou∣te twelue yere so as by a vengeaūce of god. And syth was the coūtree made clene of the wycked lawe so as
ye shall here more playnly here after. ¶How ponthous and his felawes arryued by fortu∣ne in lytell bretayne / & how ye seneshall Harlant foū∣de them vpon a roche HEre shall I tourne agayne to ye chyldren whi∣che were in the see ryght heuy & in grete drede of theyr lyues. But fortune whiche is ryght meruay∣lous brought them to the partyes of morygne that is lytell brytayne. Soo was the wynde stronge and the torment of ye see grete whiche made theym to arryue vp at ye last / & that was towarde a forest where was an abbay / & there was a roche / & the sayle & the mast were broken / & the shyppe smote vpon the roche / but god saued them for the sayle yerde fell bytwene two roches / & the sayle yerde saued them & came all vpon the roche nyghe to ye londe as god wolde. So Ioyned they theyr handes togyder towarde heuen / & thāked god / and alway be sought hym with good herte / and god whiche forgate not the clamour of his seruaūtes herde the voyce of the chyldren / & he sent them socour in shorte tyme so as ye shall here. In what tyme rey∣ned in bretayne kynge Huguell a worthy man and a true / but he was olde & of grete age. And he had but one doughter of all his chyldren whiche was by a sy∣ster of the duke of normandy. The moder was ful of the goute and myght not bestere her. The doughter was the fayrest / the swetest / the courtoysest that ony man myght fynde in ony countre. And there was no myrth but of her goodnes. So it befell that Herlant the seneshall of brytayne a ryght good knyght and a true / the whiche was keper of all brytayne that daye hunted in the forest of suffone / and as of auenture an
harte wente vnto the water tofore the roche there ye chyldren were. Harlant loked & sawe them on the ro∣che / & came thyder and cryed to them / & asked what folke they were. And they answered & said they were dryuen thyder by aduenture. And than the seneshall smote his horse with ye spores and came thyder vnto them / for the see was withdrawe / & yet ye horse went to the bely. So made he them lepe vp behynde him & behynde his knyghtes & his squyers / & brought them to the drye londe. And than he asked them what they were / & of whens they were. And they answered and sayd they were of the countre of Galyce. And one of them whiche hyght verrac sayd vnto the Seneshall, Syr se Ponthus there whiche is the kynges sone of Galyce & also his cosyn germayne Polydes. And the other ben barons sones of galyce. And whā he herde that Ponthus was the kynges sone he made to hym ryght grete chere & dyde him grete worshyp· And set hym in wordes of many thȳges. And the chylde whi¦che was wyse answered hym ryght wysely. And thā he tolde hym how Broadas the soudans sone had sea¦led Croyne & slayne his fader / and taken the coūtre. And how he had be sette in a shyppe / & also ye maner And whan the seneshall herde the dyscomfyture of ye countre / & the sorowe of the realme of Galyce he had grete pyte of the kynge and of the countre / and that suche folke had the lordeshyppe vpon crysten people. So made he them to lepe vpon theyr horses & ledde theym to vennes vnto the kynge ye whiche was there as at that tyme. And whan that ye kynge sawe them And had vnderstondynge of the dethe of the kȳge of Galyce / & the exyle of ye coūtre he was all abasshed &
wepte and had ryghte grete sorowe / for he loued the kynge meruayllously. And sayd that many tymes he had done hym good and worshyp vpon the partyes of spayne where he had be in werres ayenst the sara∣syns in the kynges felawshyp of Fraunce. And I say you well sayd the kynge that it is ryght grete harme to all crystendome / for the kynge was a meruaylous good knyght & a semely. And also the coutre is bothe fayre and good. And amonge all other thynges we bourtons sholde haue more harme therby than ony o∣ther nacyon / for we sent our marchaūdyse to chaūge with theyr good wynes. So haue we loste more than we knowe of / but god of his grace delyuer the coun∣trees of that false byleue. And syth that god hath gy∣uen me that grace to haue the kynges sone / and the barons sones of that countree I thanke hym therof ryght hyghly / for I shal make them to be nourysshed and to be lerned as myne owne propre chyldren / and than called he the Soneshall and betoke hym Pou∣thus / and to eche of the barons he sente one. And de∣parted them for a thre yere. And than he sette terme for to se them agayne. And prayed eche of them that they sholde be taught of the wood / and of the ryuer / and of the chesses / and of tables / and of all maner of dysportes. And he whiche taught his best / him sholde he conne moost thanke. And so departed he theym as ye haue herde. ¶How Harlant by the commaundement of the kyn¦ge ladde with hym Ponthus for to nourysshe.
SO were the .xiiii. chyldre departed with the ba¦rons of Brytaygne & Herlant wente his waye to gouerne Ponthus and taught hym of all dyspor∣tes of the chasses hawkynge huntynge and of all ma∣uere playes of the tables & of other dysportes Ryght grete was the name thorugh all Brytaygne of the gre∣te beaute of the witte of the fayre gouernaūce & of ye curtesye of Ponthus al of hym spake ferre & nyghe & amonge all other thynges he loued god & holy chyrch And his first werke was whā he was arysē to wasshe
his handes to saye his prayers and to here his masse ryght deuoutely. Ne neuer ete he ne dranke he tyll he had sayd all his prayers suche as they were / he gaue of that he hadde pryuely to poore men / and neuer ne swore he ryghte grete othe but his othe was surely or soo god helpe me my frende it was thus. Yf he played at the playe of ye tenys or ony other playe also Ioyous was he whan he loste as whan yt he gate / and yf men dyde hym ony wronge he shewed it within a two wor¦des or thre that men dyde hym wronge / and neuer ne strofe he ne brawled he lete rather all his ryght passe but he sayd well / ye sholde not haue this for custome but I shal rather leue of playe than I sholde stryue wt you / men myght not be angry with hym he spake soo many swete wordes and alway vpon bourdes & myr∣thes. Neuer ne loued he to mocke man / and yf men spake ony wordes of vyces of ladyes or of gentylwo∣men or of gentylmen or of folke of the holy chyrche he brake of the wordes & sayd men ought not for to byle∣ue all that euer they herde some haue sayd it you whi∣che knewe it not but by herynge & it is no nede that al reportes sholde be soth / & also he blamed all maner of vngentelnesse. After that he was the goodlyest yt me¦kest / the curteysest that ony man myght fynde / for no man dyde of his hode so soone to hym that he ne dyde of his as soone agayne / he salewed ye lytell & the grete mekely & made hȳselfe to be beloued by his grete cur∣tesye / & he played neuer with no play that touched to harme / ne bourded not of no bourdes dishoneste ne of dyspleasaūce. What sholde I say you he was the best enteched & the gracyousest that men myght fynde / & after that the goodlyest & the best fourmed that men
myght beholde / for he was grete and large in ye brest & small in the waste / & ye shuldres ye armes ye thyghes and ye fete were made of ryght deuyse / ye vysage was clere browne / the eyen so meke / the mouth rede / & the nose streyte / he semed lyke an aungell / for the more ye had beholde hym the more sholde it haue pleased you to haue sene hym. What sholde I saye you more all a∣boute ne was there no speche but of hym / & men spe∣ke soo moche of hym that the wordes came to courte suche ye fayre Sydoyne ye kynges doughter herde spa∣ke therof / and herde the grete wordes the beaute / the good maners of hym & had grete desyre to se hym by suche maner that she quaked all for desyre and prayed god yt she myght se hym in shorte tyme. She was the fayrest lady holde of the realme of Fraunce or of Bry∣taygne the swetest the courteysest & whiche best coude mayntene her estate amonge al maner folke. HOw it befell that the terme of thre yere was to come and that the kynge helde his feeste at Uennes at Penthecoste / & sente gownes of a sute all of one clothe to the .xiiii. chyldren & so sente for theym that they sholde come to the feest / and eueryche of the barons brought his & Herlant brought Ponthus and the lorde of Lauale broughte Polydes his cosyn ger∣mayne with hym whiche was ryght goodly & more a∣greable than all the other saue Ponthus. And whan that Ponthus was come / euery man behelde hym & praysed hȳ. And whan ye kynge sawe hȳ it nedeth not to aske yf that he made hym grete chere and myrthe / and sayd vnto hym that he was welcome / and that god graūted hym as moche honoure and worshyppe
as he wolde hym. The kynge helde his feest of the ba∣rons / & of knyghtes on that one syde. And the kȳges doughter of ladyes & of gentylwomen on that other sy¦de. Grete was the feest and the Ioye of meruayllous dysportes. Sydoyne whiche herde of ye grete wordes of the grete beaute & connynge of Ponthus was daye and nyght in grete thought to se hym whiche she de∣syred so moche / and she wyst not nor knewe to fynde the maner how she sholde come to her desyre / and to her worshyp therwith / all for drede of euyl speche. But the ende was whan yt she had bethought her ynough she sent for Herlant the seneshall. And whan he was come / she gaue him a ryght fayre palfraye / and a mer¦uayllous gentyll faucon and a good / and made hym ryght grete chere / & Herlant meruayled moche of the good chere yt she made him / & doubted well that some thynge she wolde / & after that she sayd vnto hym / a fayre seneshall fayre frende it nedeth that we se your chylde that ye haue nourysshed that is Ponthus whi∣che is well lerned and ryght wyse. I pray you brynge hym to vs to daye that we may se hym / & come youre selfe with him / for men haue tolde me that he syngeth and daunceth well / therfore I wolde se hym synge & daunce. Madame sayd the Seneshall I shall brynge hym syth that it pleaseth you. Than sayd she we shall se yf it be sothe that men sayne. The seneshall toke le∣ue and departed. And alwayes he was a wyse knyght and doubted that his good chere & his presentes were for Ponthus loue / & so was he in grete study what he sholde do / and sayd to hymselfe. A saynt Mary / yf I brynge Ponthus he is soo fayre & so goodly that these women sholde mowe be enamoured on hym in suche
wyse that she sholde not haue none other but hym / & she sholde mowe haue suche loue that she sholde be ap¦perceyued / & than myght she haue blame / & than the chylde sholde be loste by enuy / soo ne wyste he what to do / so he thought he wolde brȳge his cosyn germayne in stede of him for many causes / for he doubted moche the kynge for euyll that myght befall. Soo came he a∣gayne and brought with him polydes. And Sydoyne wente in to her wardrope & had a mayde whiche was named Elyos / whiche she loued / & in whome she tru∣sted more in than many other / & she had tolde her all redy how she had grete desyre to se fayre Ponthus of whome all folke spake of. And she hadde a lytell wyn∣dowe where she had alway her eye / for he sholde come on that partye. Another tyme she toke her myrrour & called Elyos to se yf there neded her ony thynge that were not well at the poynt. So at the laste as they lo∣ked out they sawe the seneshall come & Polydes whi∣che was ryght fayre & goodly. So came she downe in to the chambre and made them ryght grete chere and ryght grete Ioye & toke Polydes by the hande / and wolde haue made hym to haue syt downe besyde her. And Polydes sayd. Madame I shall not be so nyghe you / for that were no reason. Sothely sayd she yf ye be a kynges sone wherfore is it no reason. Madame saue your grace I am none. And be ye not the kynges sone of galyce / no madame I am his cosyn germayne A sayd she sothely I wende ye had ben he. So made she hym as grete chere as she myght / but for all that she was ryght angry / for she helde herselfe be mocked And than called she the seneshall asyde and sayd vnto hym / A seneshall ye haue begyled me / how so mada∣me
/ ye sholde haue brought me ye kynges sone of Ga∣lyce & ye brought me his cosyn germaine / wherfore ha¦ue ye do yt / what may ye thynke therin / wherfore hol∣de ye me so vnwyse. Than the knyght kneled downe & sayd. A madame mercy for goddes loue & dysplease you nought for in good fayth I thought but well / but I myght not brynge hym at this tyme. Do waye said she than sholde ye haue abyde as yet & not haue brou∣ghte a nother for hym / ye doubte you of me I am not so yonge but that I can kepe myn honoure & my wor¦shyp doubte it nought. Madame sayd the seneshall I thought but well / but I doubted the kȳge your fader whiche loueth you so moche yt yf ye made hym but a ly¦tel better chere thā ony of his felawshyp yt they sholde haue enuye to hȳ / & that there myght come euyll ther∣of / the worlde is so full of euyll langage that there we∣re as ye thought but good & worshyp they sholde saye and note otherwyse / Ha sayd she seneshall ne haue no doubte for I had leuer to be deed thenne ony man my¦ght repreue me of my worshyp be ye certayne therof / madame god it wolde also wysely as I haue you mo∣re dere than ony woman lyuynge / & syth ye assure me so I shall brynge hym to you. Now I praye you then quod she ne tarye not longe. And ye seneshall wente to seche hym / & Sydoyne wente vp in to her warderobe where she had a lytel wyndowe whiche opened towar¦de yt syde where as they shold come. So ne was there but she & Elyos her welbeloued gentylmā. Elyos said she take me my myrour & loke yf me nede ony thȳge. by god she sayd / Madame ye be ryght well. Loke thā yf he come / & Elyos went often & many tymes to se yf they came / & so lōge was one of thē at ye wȳdowe for
to abyde ye comynge of hym whiche she desyred so mo∣che / than Elyos came rennynge strongely & sayd Ma¦dame madame se where he cometh ye fayrest of ye worl¦de / & Sydoyne came rennȳge & sterte forth al at ones vnto that syde / & she sawe ye seneshall come & hym to∣gyder / & she sawe hym so fayre & so goodly yt she was al meruaylled. And than she spake & sayd. A A Elyos my loue me semeth he is meruayllous fayre. Fayre la∣dy sayd Elyos / he is no man / he is an aūgell / neuer sa¦we I soo fayre a creature of man / god hath fourmed hym wt his propre handes. By my fayth sayd Sydoy¦ne Elyos my fayre loue ye saye trouth / & I byleue the / also as she whiche was caught wt ye loue of him. Than came she doune in to her parlyament chābre wt her la∣dyes & gentylwomen / & it taryed not longe yt he & the seneshall came in / & Ponthus auaūced hȳ & enclyned hȳ ryght lowe & salewed Sydoyne & her felawshyp / & Sydoyne toke hȳ by ye hande & wende for to haue ma¦de hym sytte vpon a cuysshyn besyde her / but he sayd. Madame yt is no reason yt I sholde sytte so nyghe you soo made he moche courtesye. But she sayd wherfore make ye suche courtesye / be ye not a kȳges chylde as I am. Do way madame it is no cōparyson / for ye be a myghty kȳges doughter / & I am ye sone of a kynge dysheryted / & haue no thȳge but ye good doynge of my lorde your fader whiche hath done me so moche good. A Ponthus qd she leue of these wordes / for god hath not made you as nature sheweth for to vnmake you ye be shapen to haue moche more good & worshyppe than euer had your fader / & god it graunte. ¶How Sydoyne spake gracyously to Ponthus & be¦gan for to loue hym without ony poynt of vylany.
MAdame I may not se that waye / but all be it in the mercy of god / now sytteth downe quod she I cōmaunde you. So sate he a lytel bynethe. Thā she sayd to the ladyes I pray you make the Seneshal sporte and wete yf that he hath ony thynge forgoten of his songe. Madame I may no thynge forgete. So toke they hym for to daunce and for to synge / and to lede Ioye. Sydoyne whiche seete hym in wordes of many thynges helde hym ryghte wyse of his age and amonge all other thynges she sayd vnto hym. Pon∣thus ye haue be longe tyme in Brytaygne & haue not sene vs. Madame he sayd I am in gouernaunce soo must I nedes obeye. That is reason she sayd / but I as¦ke you haue ye ony lady and these ladyes whiche ben here in please they you. Madame yes sothely for it is a noble felawshyp to se. Now sayd she haue ye yet set
your herte vpō ony lady or gentylwoman for to be her knyght whan tyme cometh. Madame in good fayth naye / for the seruyce of me sholde be but lytell. Pon∣thus she sayd saue your grace / ye be come of soo good a place yt ye be lykely to serue the gretest gentylwomā and ye fayrest of all brytayne. Soo had they bytwene theym fayre langage ynoughe / & soo moche yt she sayd vnto hym. Ponthus whan ye haue ye estate of knyght hode I wyll yt ye holde you for our knyght / and whan that I here yt ye do some good I shall haue ryght gre∣te Ioye to here it / madame I thanke you. God graū∣te me yt I may do some good yt it may be pleasaunt to you & to all your ladyes but I am lytell shapen therto for ye dede of a poore man is but of lytell thȳge. Thā she sayd I shall saye you. I wyll well yt ye wete how well that I holde you for my knyght / yt whā tyme co∣meth that ye shall be knyght / yt yf ye do better thā ony of myne other knyghtes. I shall holde you moost de∣re / and ye shall fayle no thynge that I haue. And I shall saye you what ye shall do / ye shall swere to serue me aboue all other in worshyp / & doubte not I thȳke but good and worshyp. A madame he sayd I thanke you as moche as▪ I may of this grete worshyp whiche yt ye proffre me / & god graūte me to deserue it. I shal saye you she said I shal loue you as my knyght whan tyme shall come in suche maner that yf I apperceyue that ye thynke ony vylany / neuer shall I loue you af∣ter. Madame I had leuer be deed than for to thynke that were not to your worshyp / & to my lordes your fa¦der. Also than ye shall swere this to me & promytte as a kynges sone / Madame sothe by my fayth. Thā she gaue hym a rynge with a dyamonde ye shall bere this
dyamonde she sayd for the loue of me. Madame graū¦te mercy. So he toke it & set it on his fynger. And af∣ter that she ledde hym to daunce / and prayed hym to synge a songe / and he dyde her cōmaundement as he whiche was tho taken with the loue of her. So sange he a meruayllous songe and a swete And he was be∣holde of ladyes and of gentylwomen whiche praysed hym moche / & sayd eueryche in theyr hertes that well sholde she be worshypped that he vouched safe to loue And after that they hadde daunced she made to come wyne & spyces / & gaue the senesshall a cuppe of golde full of wyne / & sayd vnto hym. Seneshall I gyue you with my hande the wyne and the cuppe. And the sene shall thanked her. And whan they had sported theym ynough the seneshall sayd. Madame ye shall gyue vs leue to se the kynge your fader / & she gaue them leue / and prayed the seneshall that they sholde come se her agayne often / & he sayd so they sholde. So loked eche of them on other at the departynge / & she helde her as couert as she myght / & whā they were departed / they asked togyder that one lady of that other / what saye ye of Ponthus / & there was none but yt they praysed hym meruayllously / wherof there were some of them that sayd. A well eurous sholde that lady be whiche shall haue suche a loue / she shall mowe saye that she hath the floure & the goodlyest of the worlde. So pray¦sed the ladyes Ponthus and it dyde Sodoyne grete good to here this / she durste saye no thynge but that she sayd he is fayre ynough / but men can not yet saye the sothe wherto he shall tourne / & therfore he ought not yet to be ouermoche praysed. And that she sayd vpon her herte but that was for to here the maner of
the spekers. The feest dured thre dayes full and there were Iustes and many straunge playes made. ¶How tydynges came to the kynge of brytayne that the sarasyns were comen in to his realme. ANd amonge all other thynges there befell meruayllous thynges / for there came messan¦gers whiche sayd that the sarasyns were come downe towarde breste / & had taken the londe and were more than thyrty thousande / wherof the courte was all to troubled. And at the houre of mydday there came vp a knyghte / and two squyers sarasynes in message on kynge Karados behalfe the sowdans sone. And that was one of the thre sones wherof ye haue herde. That knyght was grete & brode in the sholders / fyers and proude / and had trewes wherby that he myght come and speke. So sayd he on hygh that the sowdans sone was come vpon that countre for to do awaye the cry∣sten lawe / and for to publysshe mahowmettes lawe.
And he sente to the kynge of brytayne that he sholde leue his lawe / & take mahonnes lawe. And ouermore that he yelde trybute of euery fyre hous of the realme and yf he wyll not he wyll dystroye brytayne & put it al to the swerde. The kynge herde the menaces & the pryde. Soo was there none that answered agayne ne said one worde. Thā Ponthus sawe that no man spa¦ke a worde / and he sterte forth and went to saye. I am a chylde & I am symple / but I shall not here our holy lawe so dispysed tofore me but that I shall speke. So wente he & kneled tofore the kynge & asked hym leue And the kynge graunted hym whan he sawe that the other wolde not speke / than he sayd to the knyght sa∣rasyn. I answere that your lawe is but dampnacyon of the fende / & deth of euerlastynge fyre. And ours is saluacyon & Ioye whiche shall alway endure / & whā that we yelde you trybute we be false / nor neuer shall we do you sernage & god wyll. Than sayd the sarasyn yf there be ony two that wyll fyght ayenst me / yt ma∣howne is not greter than your Ihesu Cryste. I shall fyght with them. Than answered Ponthus / neuer & god wyl ne shall we set two ayenst one. I am yonge & feble / but I caste my gloue in pledge to defende that worde / & saye that Ihesu cryst is the sone of god / and mahowne is the sone of the deuyll / & he caste it downe tofore the kynge / and the sarasyn toke it vp and said. Chylde I sholde fyght with ye & with another. I aske none but me sayd Ponthus. The kynge & the barons were gretly wrothe that Ponthus had waged batayll but they myghte not amende it. And than the kynge sayd. A Ponthus ye haue betrayed vs / and set vs at grete vnhertes ease / whiche haue be soo hasty to caste
your pledge & be so yonge ayenst that knyght whiche is so grete & so harde. Syr sayd Ponthus wote ye not how Danyel whiche was a childe saued Susanne by the meane of god / meruayll not of the myght of god / whome that he wyl helpe hym nedeth not to drede. I holde me sure & hop in hym. So ne doubte no thynge of me. Whan the kynge herde hym speke he wept and tourned his vysage asyde of the goodnes of the hardy¦nesse / & of pyte that he hadde of the chylde / & prayed in his herte that god wolde hȳ saue. Syr make me kny∣ghte with your hande sayd Ponthus / and gyue me ar¦mes and I shall go doo my deuoure. And the kynge made hym knyght and gyrde hym with the swerde / & kyssed hym wepynge that he myght saye no worde / & syth armed hym with his best armour of his tresourye and toke hym the best hors that he had. And whan he was on horsbacke armed he was soo goodly to se / soo ryght & so well shapen / the feet the legges so streyght and sate soo well on horsbacke yt it was a fayre thynge to se / his thyrtene felowes wepte for pyte & of drede. Harlant the seneshall was heuy / so were there all ma∣ner of folke whiche sawe that he was so yonge / & had to do with so grete an aduersary / for men sayd that he was ye hardest & the strongest of the sarasyns. Ryght grete was the crye whan Ponthus was armed for to fyght for the fayth / so moche that the wordes came to tofore Sydoyne / but it nedeth not to aske yf she had grete heuynesse and drede of her knyght / and she sent hym a pensell to sette vpon his spere / and whan he sa∣we the pensell his herte awoke / and he thanked her. And she sette her all styll in her closette in her oryson prayenge for hym.
¶How Ponthus ouerthrewe the sarasyn that sayd that his lawe was better than the crysten. ANd whan all was redy the paynym sayd to hym. Chylde go seke another for to helpe ye for thou arte ryght yonge / & I haue pyte of the / for yu art ryght fayre / so sholde it be ryght grete harme yf it be∣fell that I slewe the. By mahowne it sholde be good to vnsaye that thou hast sayd / & praye mahowne that he forgyue the / the vylany that thou hast sayd of hym Knyght sayd Ponthus leue thy Ianglynge yu shalte se sone ynoughe the vertue of Ihesu cryst defende the yf yu wylte / & he afrayed hym a lytell & toke his spere & came to hym a grete pace and smote hym bytwene ye shelde and the helme that he perced the mayle and the doublet / & put the Iren & the tree bytwene ye necke & the sholders / & the tree brake well a two fote from the heed whiche greued hym moche / & the paynym smote Ponthus in the shelde & brake his spere in his breste.
And whan the kynge & other sawe these Iustes / they thanked god & sayd that Ponthus had Iusted ryght fayre & prayed that god sholde helpe hym. Ponthus passed forth & made his cours & sette his hande on his swerde / & came towarde the paynym & gaue hym soo grete a stroke that he kytte a two halfe his ventayle & vnmaylled it so that ye vyser bename hym the syght & the paynym rent it of so boystously yt his vysage was all dyscouered / & than had the crysten men grete Ioy & grete hope / & the paynym drewe his swerde of stele & smote Ponthus so that he made all his heed to shake & his eyen to sparkle in his heed / so he felte hym asto∣nyed of the grete stroke / & smote the hors wt his spores & came agayne & smote him a grete stroke. So was ye batayle bytwene them strōge & longe endurȳge / & all wayes Ponthus wayted to smyte the paynym in the vysage / whiche was dyscouered / & soo moche that he wente to caste suche a trauers / that he smote the nose the mouth & the chyn / so yt all helde not but the skyn / so bledde he strongely / & soo moche he bledde yt all his shelde before was blody. The kynge & the people whi∣che sawe that stroke made ryght grete Ioye & thāked god. The paynym lost the blode & febled fast & so mo∣che that vnnethes he myght holde hym on his hors / & Ponthus ranne vpon hym sharpely tyll he caste hym downe as he that hadde loste his blode & myght holde hymselfe no more. Than Ponthus toke & rente of his helme from▪ his heed / and afterwarde smote hym su∣che a stroke that he made his heed for to flee too the grounde. And he bowed downe and nyghed it with his swerde / and lyfte it vp and bare it vnto the two squyers sarasynes / and sayd vnto them in this wyse
Fayre lordes I present you▪ with your maysters heed / and bere it to the sowdans sone your kynge / & tell hȳ that at his request / & for the profe of your lawe & ours that batayll hath be done / & that Ihesu cryst hath she¦wed by a chylde that he is very goddes sone / and also that by his myght he shall shewe bytwene vs whiche holdeth the wycked lawe / and tell hym that wtin short tyme men shall se who shall haue ye myghtyest god. So goo your waye all surely. For messangers ought not to haue no drede / yf they of theyr request be come be it to doo dedes of armes or for to do other thynges. The two squyers sarasyns toke ye heed / & so dyde they the body / & bare it to theyr kynge and sayd vnto hym the maner of ye request of ye batayll fro poynt to poyn∣te / and how the batayll had be do / And how he whiche had fought ne was but .xviii. yere of age at the moost. And the kynge was ryght sory of it & ryght heuy & all other lordes sarasynes / and meruaylled moche of su∣che an auenture / for they helde hym the strongest and the best knyght of theyr partye. Soo made they hym to be buryed after theyr lawe / & was moche playned and bewaylled. ¶Here leueth of hym now / and tour∣ne we agayne to Ponthus. POnthus smote his horse with the spores / and wente to the chefe chyrche & alyght there / and wente to thanke god mekely & sayd lorde swete Ihesu cryst it is meruayll of you & of your dedes / for by your grace I haue ye better of myn aduersary / lorde it hath not ben I but it hathe ben ye whiche remembred you of your lytell seruauntes / lorde haue mercy & pyte of me thy seruaunt & of this poore countree whiche is in thyne hande. And than he made his offerynge / and
after toke his hors agayne & wente & alyght afore the kynge. So nedeth it not to aske yf the kynge & the ba∣rons & all they made hȳ Ioy & ryght grete chere. The kynge beclypped hym and kyssed hym saynge / fayre swete frende we hope in you of ye delyueraūce of this coūtre whiche our aduersaryes wyll vndo. After that nedeth it not to aske yf Sydoyne & the ladyes made Ioye and myrth and sayd sothely / beaute / bounte ben assembled in Ponthus & he shall do many meruayles god saue hym and kepe hym from all euyll. After that the kȳge made his barons & his knyghtes to come to¦gyder / for to haue theyr aduyse of ye mysbyleuers whi¦che were come in to that countre. So asked the kynge theyr aduyse / & they were all afrayed & abasshed for ye grete nombre that were of them / & it was spoken of in many maners. And than the kȳge asked of Ponthus and he made ryght straunge for to speke / but ye kynge cōmaūded & prayed hym that he wolde tell his aduyse And he sayd to me it appertayneth not to speke whi∣che am so yonge & so lytell of connynge / & there where as be so many good knyghtes / but to fulfyll your wyl and to please you I shall speke as a scoler of armes / & as a chylde amonge wyse folkes / but alwaye ye shall foryeue me my foly. Syr it semeth me yt how many there be of these folke in grete nombre they ought not to be doubted / nor we ought not for to make so moche doubte for we shall be & ben in god almyghty whiche may saue & dystroye by a lytell folke a grete nombre / that is to saye one agaynst an hondred in his fayth to kepe theym / all this dede toucheth to all crysten men / for this is the seruyse of god / and all ye crysten people shall come hyder to our helpe / for yf they had gete our
countree the other sholde not be assured. And therfore I say by the good coūseyll of the good knyghtes whi∣che ben here / ye shall sende to the good knyghtes pryn¦ces barons your neyghbours / for to be here within .xv dayes / & by the helpe of god & theyrs / ye shall do them suche harme that neuer shall they can amende it / and anone present ye shall sende by your fortresses / & ma∣ke them to be stuffed well of lyuynge & of theyr thyn∣ges / & make townes & castelles to be reprayed ayen / and make the vytayl to be withdrawen bytwene this and them. And specyally vpon the partyes where as they ben. This counseyll was holden for good aboue all / and was fulfylled. And messangers were sente to neyghboures by all the countre / that is to wete vpon normandye to the vycounte of auerenches / to rhe erle of Mortayne / and to paynel / and in to Mayne / to the vycounte du lieu / to the lorde de la vale de doucelles & of Sygle / & also to the coūtesse of Anioye / for the erle was deed / & her sone was but .x. yere olde. And there was wrytē to payne of chateau Goutyer / to Guyllam de roches / to Bertram de donne / & to Androwe de la toure / & in to poytowe was wryten to the erle of poy∣tyers / & he was departed to goo to Rome / & also there was wrytē to Geffrey de lesygnen / to leoncel de man∣leon / & to Henry de la marche. Soo were they chosen for the best knyghtes in that countree / and the kynge of Brytayne prayed theym that eche of theym sholde do all the good knyghtes and squyers to wete therof that they knewe in these countrees / and that wrote so hastely yt he myght not wryte to all Eueryche of them that these letters were wryten vnto wrote to all them yt they thought wolde arme them / & eueryche of them
wyste that the sarasyns wolde gete brytayne & the cry¦styente / all maner folkes came drawȳge downe to ye nede / eueryche in the best wyse that they myght & soo many yt within the .xv. daye there was of all coūtrees neyghbours ryght moche folke / & the barons were all redy / the assemble was made at vennes / & the kynge made theym grete chere / & dyde them grete worshyp. So departed they to go towarde breste where ye hoost of sarasynes were whiche pylled the countre & set it at destruccyon. But than were there gone foure thousan¦de for to see the hoost / and they doubted to haue a ba∣tayle / & men approched vnto quypercorentyne / & the¦re the kynge & Ponthus & the barons ordeyned theyr bataylles. The kynge had a batayll & partye of his ba¦rons / & for yt he was olde there was take to gouerne hym the vycounte de lyon / & the lorde of clymaux of ye brytons brytonauntes. And of Galos. Guy de vetre. Rowlande de dueil / & Rogier de ronge / and ye other ba¦tayll was take vnto Ponthus & to Herlāt to gouerne Of ye normannes ye erle of Mortayne / & the vycounte of Auerenches the gouernaunce / & the erle of Mans gouerned the mansaus / & of the gree of barons and knyghtes of anioye. Guyllam de roches. Androwe de la toure / and the lorde of donne were ordeyned to go∣uerne the herupoys / that be the aungeuynes. And the poyteuynes were gouerned by Geffrey de lesignen / & the erle of manleon. The normannes were nombred .xi. hondred / the manseaus .ix. hondred / the aungeuy∣nes .x. hondred / the poyteuynes two hondred / and the brytons foure thousande / and of the normannes and the manseaus were one batayll / and of the poyteuy∣nes and the Torengeaulx that other batayle / for of
Touraine there was Bansaye maille la haie Amboise And so made they foure grete bataylles / wherof Pon¦thus and Harlant made the vāwarde for the kynge. Sythen the erle of Mans / and he of Mortayne / & the aungeuynes / & the poyteuynes made the rerewarde. So rode they towarde theyr enemyes / and laye vpon the felde / & ordeyned the halfe dele amonge theym to watche / and the other halfe dele to slepe. And aboute mydde nyght they had a grete fraye / for Reynault de sully / and Aygret de poully / with well a thre hondred sheldes come drawynge downe to the nedes / the whi∣che men knewe / & than whan men knewe them / they made of theym ryght grete Ioye. So put they theym with theyr wyll with the aungeuynes. And the kynge sayd vnto them & to Bertram de dōne / & to Androwe de la toure / fayre lordes god bethanked / there is mo∣che folke of vs / & of grete worthynes / & our refuge & our dongeon is in you & in your handes. So ye come without that ye were desyred in good ordynaunce / & assemble not tyll ye se we haue grete nede of you. Pon¦thus & Harlant the senesshall ordeyned the barons / & Ponthus sayd vnto ye kynge and the lordes. My lor∣des yf ye wyll leue me. I counseyll that we goo vpon them tofore daye / or aboute the poynt of daye / and or they be armed or theyr horses sadled / and or that they be sette in ordynaunce / & they shall be halfe dyscom∣fyted / for they holde theym soo grete folke that they doubte no man. And therfore me semeth that it shall be so done that they shall be the easelyer dyscomfyted Sothely sayd the kynge & all the barons this coūseyll is good. Now take we our horses for it is tyme. Than euery man armed hym / and lepte vpon theyr horses
And the weder was styll and fayre / & the mone shone ryght clere. So rode they towarde ye hoost of ye sarasy∣nes / whiche were towarde preste in theyr pauylyon / & had taken theyr counseyl yt syth they were not fought with yt they wolde ouer ryde brytayne & lede wt theym engynes & ladders for to assayle townes & castelles / & they doubted not to haue batayle / & made no watche ne none awayte to tell of / but helde them as folkes as∣sured / for ye grete nombre yt were of them. Now befell that the bataylles approched so nygh yt they sawe the sarasyns whiche yt occupyed wel two myle. There we¦re many pauylyons of many dyuers coloures. ¶How Ponthus yt had the fyrst batayle recomforted his felawes / & how bernarde de doe / landry de la tour & Guyllyam de roches socoured Ponthus & his folke.
THan Ponthus whiche ledde the fyrst batayll sawe them & sayd to his folke. Se here the ene¦myes of our fayth whiche wyll dissheryte vs / we be in the seruyce of god almyghty / wherfore no man ought to haue doubte that one of vs ne is worth an hondred of them. I pray you of two thynges / that one to trust all in god / for by his myght ye shall come aboue them That other that ye take none hede to no pyllynge to no couetyse / but go to dyscomfyte them / & put theym out of this countre for ye honour of our lawe / & for the pyte of the comyn people whiche dwell out of the for∣tresses / & haue so moche trauayll for the goodes and ye profytes wherby we lyue. And for that we be ordey∣ned for to defende the chyrche & theym. And whan he had sayd all vnto theym that he wolde he sayd. Now forth my frendes & thynke euery man for to do well. Than euery man toke herte vnto them / & smote theyr horses with the spores towarde the tentes & made a grete crye / & smote downe tentes and pauylyons / & to slee turkes / & some sterted out naked / and wende to haue armed them / & the other fledde fro pauylyon to pauylyon. So was there on theyr syde grete hewȳge and grete crye on all partyes / and the daye began to appere and wexed clere. Brytons slewe all that they myght holde / ye other put a fyre in the lodges in suche wyse that it was all clere. Kynge Karados was all a¦frayed / & made his trumpes and his trumpettes to blowe / & anone euery man armed them / & lepte vpon his hors that myght. So were they all ouertaken / for on all parties men ranne vpon them surely / but there were soo grete nombre of theym / wherfore or men myght haue conquered the thyrde parte of his hoost /
that other were on horsbacke & armed / and assembled them by grete flockes vpon a grete playne with ryght a grete batayll / & with his folkes well armed / & eche helde theym in ordynaunce with the chyeftene for it was come to the nede. Than sholde ye haue sene the sarasynes enbatayll them in grete maner / & alwayes they were ouertake in suche wyse that they were more than .vii. thousande deed / that was aboute the fourth parte of theyr folke / & all had well nyghe fledde. And kynge Karados whiche was of grete courage of that that he was on horsbacke / toke his baner in his honde for to make his folke to come agayne / & they herde his voyce & his crye / so gaue he hardynes to the moost co¦warde of theym. And aboute the sonne rysynge was there grete hewynge and grete crye / for at that tyme / the thre bataylles of our folke were assembled vpon the sarasyns there was a ryght pyteous stoure of our folke whiche set fyre in theyr lodges and slewe theym Kynge Karados rayled a batayll of well a seuen thou∣sande turkes and wolde haue come to smyte vpon the syde of ye batayll of our folke whiche had moche to do / and so moche that they wente abacke. And than sayd Androwe de la toure Bertram de donne / & Guyllam de roches. Lordes it is tyme to departe / se our folkes whiche lese theyr places / and also beholde a grete ba∣tayle whiche cometh to smyte vpon them / abyde we not tyll that they smyte for that sholde be peryll. Thā dressed he his spere vpon his thyghe and wente ren∣ged ayenst the kynge Karados. ¶How Ponthus helped the kynge of brytayne that was ouerthrowen & had hym out of the prees.
¶How Ponthus helped the kynge of brytayne that was ouerthrowen / and had hym out of the prees. ANd whan he sawe theym come he tourned to themwarde & made hym redy afore / for to go gyue theym strokes with his spere / and his cosyn ger∣mayne Broalys whiche was a good knyght / & wente to smyte Bertram de donne / & Androwe de la toure. The kynge bette downe Bertram / & Androwe bette downe Broalys & toke his hors & gaue it to Bertram de donne / & he sayd vnto hym / felowe that is not the fyrst seruyce ye haue done me. The sarasynes assem∣bled aboute Karados / there were many fayre Iustes bytwene two batayles. Guyllam de roches & Geffrey de lesygnen eche of thē bete downe his / but I knewe not theyr names. Than assembled they on all parties There was grete frusshynge of speres & many folkes
ouerthrowen that had no power to releue themselfe. & than set they theyr handes to theyr bryght swerdes of stele / & there was grete noyse of the dede / and of them that were hurte. On that other partye ye kynge of bry∣tayne faught whiche was fallen of his horse in the ba∣tayle / and was ryghte sore brused / but that Ponthus came vpon hym of auenture / & whan he sawe the kȳ∣ge on the erth & his hors aboue his body / it nedeth not to aske yf he was ryght sory and heuy. And wete well that he was in waye to be deed / ne had be Royart de∣ronge / & Mountfort / and the lorde of Clymaus these thre amonge other susteyned the grete dede / & suffred moche. But Ponthus set his body in auenture to re∣scue his lorde / & sette his hande on his swerde & smote on the ryght honde / & on the left sleynge men & hors and dyde dedes of armes / so yt all meruaylled of hym gretly & so moche he dyde that all fleldde with his stro¦kes. In lytell whyle he departed the grete prees with the helpe of Harlant the senesshall and his cosyn ger∣mayne Polydes / these two felawes sewed hym what partye that euer he wente. And Ponthus dyde so mo¦che of armes that he rescowed the kynge / & alyght to helpe hym vp agayne. The kynges ryght arme was broken & ryght euyll ledde for he was ryght olde and brused / for he was of an hondred yere of age & more. but he had ben a ryght good knyght and of grete cou∣rage / on horsebacke was he set maugre his enemyes. Whan Ponthus apperceyued that his arme was bro∣ken. So sente they him out of the batayll wolde he or not / & was withdrawen. And the batayll was ryght cruell on that one syde & on that other. And Ponthus behelde that the batayll on the best syde had moche a
do / where the erle of Dongres was Gautyer de rays Bernarde de la roche. Geffrey dauncemys. Bryaunt de quynten. Mountfort / & many other barons of bry∣tayne whiche were ouerthrowen & were in grete auen¦ture to be deed or taken. For ayenst one bryton was .x of the sarasynes / but aboue all set he hym in grete de∣fence Bernarde de la roche. Than sayd Ponthus / se our folke whiche haue grete nede of helpe / go we and rescue them / than smote they the hors with the spores theyr swerdes in theyr handes / & came so styffely that they frusshed all tofore them. And Ponthus wente to¦fore them sleynge all that euer he smote / & bette and slewe and maymed folke soo moche that the hardyest made hym waye. So dyde they so moche within a ly∣tell whyle that they recouered our folke & put the sara¦synes to flyght wolde they or not. And made them to resorte agayne in to the grete batayle whiche was ry∣ghte greuous and peryllous for the grete nombre of paynyms the whiche smote vpon the crysten mennes helmes. Kynge Karados helde with grete dystres the erle of Mans / and the lorde of Craon / and had ouer∣throwen them and many of the manceaus and heru∣poys / as Hamelyn de sylle. Geruays de la porte. Thy bault de matheselon. Peter de doncelles. Sauary de la hay. Gerarde de chateau goutyer. Guyllam de ro∣ches. Geffrey de lesygnen / and Leoncel. But they de∣fended them on fote / & were assembled whiche auay∣led them moche. Androwe de la toure / and Bertram de donne sette grete payne for to recouer theym / but there was soo grete prees of sarasynes / and soo grete a folke that vnnethes myght they come to them / tyll that Guyllam de roches sawe Ponthus whiche that
made the renges to shake with the helpe that sewed hym. Syr it is nede se yonder a grete partye of our ba¦rons the whiche ben on fote. Than smote they on that syde / and brake the prees in suche wyse that they reco∣uered the erle and theym the whiche hadde nede / and ryght soone they were on horsbacke agayne. And thā the batayll began ryght cruell / for at that tyme there was none that wolde besene a cowarde. Grete crye & grete hewynge there was on euery partye. And kȳge Karados dyde gre∣te and meruayllous dedes of armes / he and Broalys / and Corbatan his vncle Tho were the thre knyghtes of all the sarasyns whiche su¦steyned most theyr folke: makynge the grete stoures & the grete dedes of ar∣mes & whiche most releued agayne in theyr grete nede. ¶How the kynge Karados was dys∣comfyted by Pon∣thus and his folke.
POnthus behelde the kynge whiche dyde ryght grete dedes of armes & sawe hym ryght ryche¦ly armed with perles & precyous stones / and vpō his helme a ryche crowne of golde / and slewe many of the crysten people / and had ouerthrowen Guyllam de ro∣ches / & slayne Guyllam de dygnan / and bette downe many knyghtes & woūded. Than said he to Androwe fayre lorde what an aduersary haue we of that kynge & of his two knyghtes whiche be besyde hym / yf they dure longe they wyll doo vnto vs moche harme. And yf these thre myght be sette on fote or to the deth / it se∣meth me that we sholde haue ye hyghe hande of them Syr sayd Androwe de la toure / goo to that one / & we shall go to the other two. Than sayd Ponthus I shal go to ye kȳge / & put me in auenture of all his strength And he wente forth & gaue the kynge so grete a stroke that he bette hym downe of his horse to ye erth / and at the fallynge he brake his canell bone. And Androwe bette downe Broalys / & smote of his ryght arme that he dyed withall. And Harlant the seneshall smote Cor¦batan agayne so felony that he bette him downe / and whan these thre were defowled it nedeth not to aske yf they sarasynes were abasshed / for ye dyscomfyture was there ryght grete / & all theyr power was fallen / and they dwelled as shepe wtout shepeherde. Than to¦ke they theym to dyscomfyture and to lese londe. And than our cresten folke toke boldnes vpon theym and to haue the crye of them / so slewe they many of them from thens forth. The kynge myght vnnethes releue agayne / so slewe hym one that bare the lyon that was Reynault de vytre or deglysson I wote neuer. The sa¦rasynes wyst not where to flee or to hyde them. On ye
coost towarde the nauy was a ryght grete stoure of sa¦rasynes / whiche wyste not yet of the deth of theyr kȳ∣ge / and hadde bette downe Bausaye mayle. Geruays daner / the mount Iohn̄ / & payne de rochefort / & there helde they strayghtly our folke. But whan they sawe theyr folke slayne / they meruaylled moche / and whan our folke wt whome they fought / sawe them affrayed they toke herte to them / & ranne vpō them. And also there came to rescowes Geffrey de lesygnen / & leoncel the herupoys and brytons soo many / that they made them to leue the place / & there was grete slaughter of paynymes and of sarasynes. ¶How the sarasynes were ouercomen & drowned. POnthus dyde meruayllous dedes of armes / for he slewe folke & also hors / & all that he toke
with the stroke was deed defouled or beten doune his shelde was to all presented / he departed the grete stro¦kes with his bryght swerde. So Ioyned there theym togyder Geffrey de lesygnen. Androwe leoncel. Guyl∣lam de roches. Bernarde la roche / & Harlant the sene¦shall. And whan they were assembled togyder they dy¦de meruayllous dedes of armes / for there where they sawe ye grete prees / they bette in and broke in amon∣ge theym / and made theym to make waye who that euer it happed wt theyr good swerdes of stele / none ne durste abyde theym. And Ponthus whiche dyde mer∣uayllous dedes of armes was knowen by the strokes whiche he departed on the ryght syde and on the lefte So cryed he vnto them / they be dyscomfyted the pay∣nymes whiche were as bestes without shepherde / for theyr kynge / and theyr capytaynes were tho deed / so coude they take no good counseyll ne sette noo remedy in them / & so they lete themselfe be to all hewen. Soo was there within a lytell whyle suche slaughter that all the feldes were strawed with deed men and with maymed / & they fledde towarde the nauy / & drowned them in the water / and our folke pursewed theym & made them to be drowned & perysshed. Ponthus toke a lytell vessell / & slewe well a .xxx. whiche hasted them for to saue theym / & toke foure all on lyue / and asked theym where the tresour & the ryches of ye kynge was And they shewed hym a fayre shyppe / & than he sayd lede me thyder or ye shall dye / & they ledde hym thy∣der. And Ponthus & his cosyn germayne Polydes & seuen of his felawshyp sterte in to the shyppe & slewe & caste out all that they founde therin in to the water
So loked they the cofers where as the kynges golde was and his syluer / fayre felowes kepe me this vessel sayd Ponthus to his seuen felowes / & I wyll see yet yf there be ony yet that wyll lyfte vp the heed ayenst vs. Than lepte he out of the shyppe and come to the londe by a vessell / but there was none that defended hym but all were slayne or drowned. Brytons heru∣poys Torengeaus. Manseaus / pooteuynes / and nor¦mans ranne in to the shyppes / and in to the vesselles and the other serched the tentes and the pauylyons / and there was none so poore but that he had ynoughe and that one more than that other. Men serched the feldes eueryche for his frendes. And they founde the vycount of Auerences deed. And Ihon̄ paynell. Tur∣nebeef / and the lorde of villyers so made the normans grete sorowe for they were good knyghtes. And what of the Manseaus. Hongres de beaumount. Marge∣ron / and ye lordes of doncelles. And Amaulry de sylly Of the herupois Gassos de mountereul. Rowlande de chenulle. Endes de penaunces / and Fresylde la hay. Of poyteuynes Gautyer de chateau neuf. Androwe de montagu and Hubault de la forest. And other bry∣tons. Peter de duel. Raoul le reis Iohn̄ dauauger. har¦dy de leon. Huberte de dygnan. Godfrey de roham. Aubrey de rays / and many other good knyghtes / eue∣ryche made theyr frendes for too be borne in to theyr coūtre / and the hurte for to be kepte. Ponthus made the grete shyppe / and the grete tresoure for to come vnto his place at vennes. And he departed grete foy∣son vnto good knyghtes / and vnto the good folke of armes soo largely / that he was ryght hyghly praysed
and alowed therfore. The kynge was withdrawen a¦gayne to quypercorentyne / & there assembled al ye gre¦te lordes. The kynge feested the straungers / and gaue them grete gyftes / after that euery mā was of degre And than he sayd vnto theym / lordes ye be come gra∣mercy vnto you / in to goddes seruyce / & in to the ser∣uyce of the holy chyrche and of the poore people. And by the grace of the hyghe lorde and by your grete pro∣wesses and hardynes ye haue delyuered this countree of mysbyleuers whiche wolde haue dystroyed our ho∣ly lawe. And it is sothe that his purneyaunce hath gy∣uen you this holy gyfte and this grace / for ayenst one of you there was syxe of them. So ought we with all our hertes to thanke god. And after that spake they ynough of them whiche had done best / & sette grettest remedy & dyde & suffred grettest dedes of armes but without comparyson Ponthus had the loos & sayd all with one voyce that he had ouercome all. And so gaue they the grete pryce vnto Geffrey de lesygnen / to An∣drowe de la toure / & vnto Bernarde de la roche. And that they thre were after Ponthus whiche moost had suffred & gretest dedes had done of armes / & many o∣ther there were whiche had done ryght well / but lon∣ge sholde it be to tel the prowesse of them. Thre dayes the kynge withhelde them and feested them and gaue theym fayre gyftes to eche of them after that he was. And after that toke they leue of the kynge. And Pon∣thus conueyed them as ferre as he myght. ¶How the crysten men retourned in theyr coūtrees. And of the grete chere that Sydoyne made to Pon∣thus her welbeloued knyght at Uennes.
ANd thus they departed fayre and Ioyful and euery man wente in to his countree. And the kynge tourned agayne to vennes So nedeth it not to aske yf Sydoyne had grete Ioye / and sayd to Ponthus / swete loue blessyd be god of the goodnes and of the honoure that ye receyued of this batayll / for soo god helpe me I haue so grete Ioye of the goodnes that I haue her∣de saye / that myne herte is all ledde with gladnes nor there is no thynge that I take soo grete pleasaunce in / as to here tell the grete goodnes and the loos that euery man gyueth you. Madame sayd Ponthus it lac¦keth moche that all is not true. Some haue sayd vn¦to you and reported more than there is / suche para∣uenture as loue me. But alwaye I thanke you of the
goodnes & worshyp that ye wolde me as I thynke it. Madame wete it well that yf god wyl gyue me grace to doo some good / that it cometh to me frome you / for soo moche onely that I take me all for to please you / and in ye hope that I haue for to fall in your good gra¦ce / and for to do you seruyce whiche myght please you the whiche god graunte me to do your worshyp Pon¦thus my swete loue your seruyce take I in gree with all myn herte whyle that I fynde you true wtout thyn¦kynge of ony vylanye / for our loue I wyll that it be clene and certayne without ony thought of vylanye. And wete it wel for certayne that fro the tyme I may apperceyue that ye thynke ony other thynge thā wor∣shyppe of me and of my frendes / ye shall lese me and so moche as I loue you I shall hate you to the dethe. Madame he sayd ne thynke neuer that I wolde yma¦gyne thynges the whiche that toucheth agaynst your worshyp. And for that that I haue founde you and fynde it so clene / so good / and soo sure / that I prayse you and loue you better a thousande tymes and more ardaūtly / for a nobler tresoure is there none in ye worl¦de than is a good woman and a clene / what sholde I saye you / gretely loued they twayne togyder of true lo¦ue wtout ony vylany. but enuye may not suffre thȳges ende well as ye shall here more playnly here after fo∣lowynge. ¶How that Ponthus was ordeyned and constytned constable of brytayne.
THe kynge sente to seke all his barons / & sayd vnto them. Fayre lordes I say you that I am ryght olde & may not trauayll as I was wonte / & it nedeth me from hens forwarde to take myne ease / & therfore it is good that by youre good counseyll there be chosen a good constable that he may haue the rule and ye charge of brytayne to whome the barons of the countre wolde best obey without daunger. So loke a¦monge you one / & chose hym / for I wyll yt he be chosen
and made by you & by your good counsyell. And than sayd the barons all with one voyce / We knowe not whome men myght better fynde yf it pleased hym to be it than Ponthus / he is worthy to gouerne an Em∣pyre / of bounte / of beaute / of wytte / of gouernaunce and of gentylnes as a kynges sone / & as the beste be∣gynner of knyghthode that at this daye is lyuynge. Whan the kynge harde that / he had ryght grete Ioye for that was all that he sought / but he wolde not do it without that he spake to them therof to the ende that they sholde haue hym in the more fauour & good wyll Soo was there none that withsayd it Ponthus was cleped and it was sayd vnto hȳ before them / all that the kynge & the barons of brytayne hadde chosen him constable for the moost suffysaunt. So thanked he the kynge & the barons / & sayd vnto theym after that he had auysed hym a lytell / that he had not the wytte the gouernaunce ne the worthynes in hym to be it / & that he was ryght yonge bothe of wytte and of age / but no¦thynge auaylled theym his lackynge / but that he was by strength charged wheder he wolde or no. So was he in his offyce bothe beloued and dredde. And whan there was ony dystruccyon bytwene rhe barons & the knyghtes / he was he that set them agayne in peas / & at accorde / he kepte the ryght of brytayne without do¦ynge ony wronge / he made hym to be byloued of all he Iusted / he made feestes / he was ryght pleasaunte to grete & to small / & specyally amonge ladyes & gentel∣women / he was so curteys that there was none dyde of so soone his hode ayenst hym / that his ne was done of as soone agayne / he harde the poore / and he dyde them ryght in shorte tyme of the request where he had
reason / he wolde not that the poore folke were oppres∣sed / he loued god and holy chyrche / & herde-euery daye two masses at ye leest / he loued hawkynge & huntynge and all dysportes / he made ladyes & gentylwomen to synge & to daunce / all Ioy was there he was he gaue them dyners & soupers / he was well beloued of fayre ladyes and gentylwomen whiche shewed hym many grete sygnes of loue & drewe to hym gretly / but neuer prayed he them of loue / but that touched to theyr wor¦shyp for ony semblaunt that ony of theym made. So sayd they bytwene them oftentymes ye one to another She sholde be blessyd who sholde be byloued of Pon∣thus / & some sayd in pryuete / wolde god he loued me as moche as I wolde loue hym / & that he had me also dere as I haue hȳ moche made he hȳ to be byloued of ly¦tel & grete. But en¦uye whiche faileth neuer came to one of hys felowes of his coūtre / whiche was one of ye .xiiii. whiche was mer∣uaylous subtyll of spekynge & full of gile. and his name was Guenellet. ¶How Guenellet put dyscencyon by¦twene Ponthus & Sydoyne.
GUenellet whiche sawe the loue of Sydoyne & of Ponthus soo had he enuye / & for to make it to be lefte he asked of Ponthus his mayster an horse whiche Sydoyne had gyuen hym / & he thought well that he sholde not mowe haue it / & he sayd vnto hym Mayster gyue me the horse that Sydoyne gaue you. Sothely sayd Ponthus that wyll I not gyue / but go in to the stable & take whiche that lyeth you / for there be ynoughe fayrer than he. Sothely sayd he I wyll haue none other / yf I haue not hym / ye may not haue it sayd Ponthus. O sayd Guenellet refufe ye to gyue me an hors. I ought lytell to trust in your good dedes O sayd Ponthus suffyseth it not you for to take or to chose amonge all my horses / & yf ye haue not ynough of one take two at your owne choyse. Guenelet passed forth & made hym ryght heuy and sayd in his herte. I wote well I shall not haue it / but it shall be well dere bought yf I lyue longe. Soo thought he malyce and thought fyrst to hynder hym to Sydoyne / so went he to go speke to a gentylwoman whiche was one of Sy¦doynes maydens / & sayd vnto her that he loued her ryght moche / & that he wolde saye her a grete coūseyll but that she sholde swere vpon holy euangyles that she sholde not dyscure hym. And she swore vnto hym A sayd he I loue well the kynge & his doughter my lady and her worshyp / as he whiche hath nourysshed me / & therfore I wolde holde no thynge whiche were ayenst them. Wete it well quod he that Ponthus my mayster hath made my lady and yours byleue that he loueth her more than ony other woman of the worlde but wete it well yt he dodth begyle her / for I am well apperceyued yt he loueth another more than her & yt is
foly to sette her herre so on fledde folke. And it is sayd often tymes / who that wolde haue grace ouer all this worlde many tymes ben deyceyued / and therfore it is good that she take hede betymes A sayd the gentylwo¦man I had wende that he had ben the trewest yt was lyuynge / and alwayes I am syker that he besoughte my lady neuer but of honoure and of goodnesse / I by¦leue it well sayd he / but all that shyneth is not golde The gentyl woman wende that he had sayd trewe & wente vnto her lady and made her to swere that she sholde not dysure her / and that she sholde make no semblaunt of that she sholde saye vnto her. And syth she sayd her as it was done her to vnderstande that Ponthus loued another more than her / & all the ma∣ner. And whan Sydoyne hadde herde her. It nedeth not to aske yf she had grete sorowe in her herte what semblaunte that euer she made / but there ne shewed she none outwarde as she was ryght wyse. And it be∣fell that Ponthus came to se her as he was wonte to do of custome / & made tho gladde chere / & Sydoyne was mornynge & pensyfe & made hym but lytel chere And Ponthus was ameruayled & came to Elyos her gentylwoman & asked her what her ayled / sothly she sayd I wote neuer but it was wel a two dayes agone that she was not so glad as she was wente to be. And Ponthus drewe agayne vnto her and sayd. Madame what chere▪ make ye me / haue ye ony mysease / is there ony thynge lyuynge that I myght set remedy therto A sayd she no man woteth now a dayes in whome he may trust to / the worlde is so ryght meruayllous and straunge for to knowe. Than sayd Ponthus vnto her A Madame for goddes mercy / tell me wherfore that
ye saye these wordes / is there ony body whiche hathe mysdone ayenst you. Naye she sayd / but so moche I saye you / therwithall she departed & wente in to her chambre ryght sory & ryght pensyfe. Ponthus myght gete none other hynge of her / ne haue no good chere as he was wonte / so apperceyued he that he was hyn∣dred to her by flaterynge. And he sette hym in way to haue wyst more / but that was for nought for more ne wyste he not at that tyme. That nyght was he ryght sory & pensyfe without slepe / & sayd wery & sorowfull wretche what haue I sayd or what haue I done / who hathe hyndred me to my lady. Alas what is he or she that wyll slee me or murthre me vntruly without ony deseruynge / where ben they yt wolde benymme me al my worldly Ioy / & make me nyght & day to langour sorowfully. Thus complayned hym Ponthus / & yf he hadde sorowe Sydoyne had no lesse than he / & sayd in herselfe. Alas who sholde euer trust ony man. I haue be well dysceyued / for I thought that he had ben the trewest aboue all knyghtes / how hath nature fayled to forgete to sette in the gracyousest / the best holden of honoure / of courtesye / of worthynesse / of larges / & of all good maners / faylynge no thynge but trouthe / How forgate she to sette that in hym that was pyte & harme. Soo sorowed the fayre Sydoyne / and by this waye had vntrouth I set trouble bytwene them two and the two louers were tho in grete sorowe by suche flaterynge. Ponthus whiche had slepte lytell & rested hym / rose vp erly and wente for to here masse / and after that he sente to seke Elyos / the whiche he loued moche / for that that he wyste his lady loued her moche and yt she wyste all the pryuete of her lady. A he sayd
Elyos my swete loue moche haue I meruayled of y• that my lady sayd vnto me / in suche wyse I thynke I neuer shall haue Ioye. A syr she sayd ye ought not to do so / for I thynke that my lady ne dyde it not but for to assaye you / or that there be some euyll reportes whiche shall be foūde lesynges. So se I nought wher¦fore ye ought to take suche dyscomforte. A quod he my loue I wote not what to thynke / but I shall go out a lytell / and I shall not come agayne tyll I that I kno∣we yt my comynge please her. So ne sayd he no more at that tyme / & he drewe hym agayne to his chambre and called a squyer vnto hym whiche was named Ge¦rarde / Gerarde he sayd make you and two yemen & myne horse and myne harueys pryuely redy / for two houres tofore daye I wyll goo oute a lytell where I shall be nyghe one yere. So leue I Harlant ye seneshal my lyeutenaunt / for he is a true man and a good kny¦ghte. Than came he to the kynge and sayd vnto hym that he wolde go out a lytell. And the kynge sayd vnto hym. Ryght swete frende go not ferre / but that I may se you oftentymes / for in you is all my Ioye and the sustynaunce of all my lyfe / and the gouernaūce of my realme. My lorde he sayd I thynke not to tary nor to go in place yt yf I wote yt ye haue ony thȳge to doo wt me that toucheth your worshyp / that I ne shall come to you afore all other. Alwaye ye kynge sette grete pay¦ne for to let his goynge / but he myght not in no wyse So toke he his leue of ye kynge pryuely / at euen ryght late that none sholde apperceyue hȳ / & wente to reste hym / and sente for Harlant the seneshall vnto his bed and sayd vnto hym. Harlant my swete frende I wyll go out a lytell whyle to knowe somwhat on ye worlde
and for to acqueynte me with good knyghtes. So ha∣ue I spoke to ye kynge that I shall leue you my lyeu∣tenaunt / & ye wote well how I loue you / wherfore I praye you for my cosyn germayne & myne other felo∣wes. A whyder wyll ye go fayre swete frende. I wyll go out a lytell whyle & wyll not dwell longe / & I wyll that no man wote it / & for a cause Harlant wolde not enquyre / for he doubted not yt he wolde haue taryed lō¦ge. And whan ye Harlant was departed he made his clerkes to come forth & wryte two letters yt one he ga∣ue his power to Harlant / that other he recōmaunded hym to his felawshyp / and prayed them to serue well the kynge / & to obey Harlant / & that he sholde come a∣gayne from thens as he sholde go to. So he left them there & toke them to the clerke / & badde hym yt he shol∣de not delyuer theym tyll the nexte daye at euen / and he dyde yt for drede that his felowes wolde haue pur∣sewed hym. ¶How Ponthus departed from the courte secretely. ANd whan it was aboute mydnyght / he arose vp & arayed hȳ / & parted thens as pryuely as he myght. He rode all tyll daye / & syth wente hym in to the forest of brycelyon / in a pryoury & an heremytage whiche was all solytary & depe in the forest / where he was well a seuen dayes / & euery daye he went to here masse at ye heremytage. And he dyde moche abstynaū¦ce as to faste thre dayes in the weke / & the frydaye he wered ye heere / & he thought for yt / yt the kynge was ol∣de / & that ye realme abode to hȳ yt he wolde not be farre for yt / yt yf there fel ony trouble yt he myght remedy it. So was he moche annoyed & was at euen in ye forest
ryght pensyfe & full of stody / & lystened ye songe of the byrdes whiche was ryght delycyous / as in ye tyme of Aueryll / & made a songe where he was at ye refraynȳ∣ge of ye songe of ye byrdes. No Ioye sholde me recōfor∣te whā she whiche I haue loued so moche / wolde be so straūge to me / & there he set it in a songe. And syth he thought he wolde take an empryse of dedes ot ar∣mes. So wrote he his ordynaunce and sent to seche a dwarfe & made hȳ to be arayed ryght wel & clothed hȳ in a robe of sylke ryght nobly & toke hȳ a yeman & hor∣ses & a letter wryten in foure whiche sayd thus. The blacke knight wt ye whyte armes doth to wete to ye best knyghtes of eche coūtre / yt they shall fynde at ye wel of auenture in ye forest of brycelyon a blacke pauylyon wt whyte teres euery tuesdaye in the yere at the houre of pryme / & also they shall fynde a tree where his sheldes shall hange / & there shall be an horne whiche a dwarfe shall blowe / & whā he hath blowen it / there shall come out an olde gentylwomā with a sercle of golde / & an heremyte with her / whiche shall saye them what they shal do / she shal lede thē in a medowe where ye blacke knyght shal be armed / whiche shal Iuste thre courses & after ye Iustes he shall fyghte wt a swerde poyntles to the vtteraunce / & hym yt he shall conquere shal aske of all the knyghtes in good fayth the fayrest mayde of the realme of lytell brytayne / & to her shall he yelde hȳ prysoner to do her wyll wt hym on the sorowfull blacke knyghtes behalfe with ye whyte teres. And ouer that it is to be knowen that all they that haue Iusted shall yelde theym in this forest at wytsontyde come twelue moneth at a feest whiche shall be therin. And he whi∣che that shall Iuste best / shall haue the spere the guf∣fanon / and a sercle of golde with stones. And he whi∣che
shall smyte strongest with the swerde and longest fyght / shall haue the swerde with the gyrdell of golde & the crowne of golde / & yf it befall that ony of theym conquere the blacke knyght he shall mowe sende hym to pryson to suche a lady as shall please hym. ¶How Ponthus sente a dwarfe thrughe all ye coū∣tree of Fraunce to anounce and shewe of dedes of armes that sholde be made in the forest of betelyen euery tuesdaye thrughe the yere. ANd whā Ponthus hadde taken these letters to the dwarfe / he cōmaunded hym yt he sholde go by all the coūtrees of Fraūce / there where he wyste ony assemble of feestes or Iustes / & that he do them to wete all aboute. The dwarfe whiche that coude speke ryght well / wente by all the countree doynge them to wete / and many one meruaylled wherfore the blacke knyght wolde fyght so. And for that that he chose the best knyghtes of euery countree / and many one made
them redy to come thyder / & sayd that he sholde haue grete worshyp that he sholde haue the swerde or ye spe¦re / & yet more who sholde mowe conquere hym it ta∣ryed not longe that there came thyder ynoughe of bry¦tayne & of other countrees. And Ponthus made his folke swere / the pryour / and the heremyte all that they sholde not dyscure hym. And he sente to Rennes the whiche was afore named vyle ronge to seke that that hym neded. And he sent to seke an olde gentylwoman whiche sholde be of his counseyll / & arayed her in cote and in mantell of sylke / & a large sercle of golde vpon her heed / and had a kercher of almayne tofore the vy∣sage that men sholde not knowe her. And Ponthus was disguysed in maner of an heremyte with a grete heed of heere / and whyte berde & a vyser / & had in his hande a letter of the ordynaunce. And at that tuesday there came many knyghtes wenynge to haue Iusted and to haue doo dedes of armes to the blacke knyght whiche was at the well / & some men called it the well of brylaunson. And sawe pyght a grete tent & a grete pauylyon / & it taryed not longe that a dwarfe came out of the pauylyon ryght foule & horye / & came to a tree where henge a grete horne / and the blacke shelde with the whyte terys / & toke the horne & blewe ryght strongly / & whan he had blowen it / out came the gen∣tylwoman & the heremyte whiche helde her by the bry¦dell of golde / & came ryght to ye shelde / and made the dwarfe to crye that the knyghts of euery coūtre whi∣che wolde do dedes of armes with the blacke knyght sholde hange vp theyr sheldes at that grete tre where the speres were aboute. And there were lytell hokes of yren where euery man myght hange his shelde / euery
man that was there made his shelde for to be hanged there. And whan the sheldes were hanged the dwarfe sayd / this gentylwomā whiche is here doth me to say to you what her ordynaunce is / that she shall chose a∣monge all these sheldes foure sheldes / to whiche she shall shote to eche an arowe federed with golde. And that that she shall smyte fyrst shall go to aray hym for this tuesdaye. And that where she shall shote to the se¦conde arowe / shall make hym redy by that day seuen nyght. And he that of the thyrde / shal make hym redy for the thyrde tuesdaye. And yt where she shall smyte the fourth arowe / shall make hym redy for the fourth tuesday. And at the ende of the moneth she shall shote agayne other foure by the same semblaunce / & so shall she do for euery moneth from this tyme to the ende of the yere / & there shal be fyfty knyghtes / & two whiche shall delyuer of the best / & of the moost renowned that that gentylwoman shall mowe chose at her deuyse & shall dure from this tyme all ye yere / or so moche that he fynde who to conquere hym by armes. And whan the dwarfe hadde sayd that he entred in to the pauy∣lyon all on horsbacke. And brought with hym a mer∣uayllous fayre bowe of turquye / and foure arowes gylte / and federed with golde to the gentylwoman / & tolde her whiche she sholde smyte. So Sotte she the foure arowes / & smote foure sheldes / wherof ye fyrste was Bernarde de la roche the beste knyght of all bry∣tayne holde. The seconde was Geffrey de Lesygnen holde ye best of poytow. The thyrde was Androwe de la toure holde the best of aungeuynes and herupoys. The fourth was the Erle of Mortaygne holde ye best of the normans that were there.
¶How Ponthus conquered fyrst Bernarde de la ro∣che / and sente hym vnto the fayre Sydoyne for to yel∣de hym prysoner. ANd whan she had shotte these foure arowes the heremyte ledde her agayne to the greate tente whiche was blacke with whyte teres / and anone he alyght downe and armed hym at all poyntes and came out of the tente / the shelde at his necke / and the spere in his fyste vpon a grete blacke horse / couered all with blacke syglaton with whyte teres ryght ry∣chely armed. The knyght was grete and wel shapen and moche was for to be doubted. Moche wondrynge and moche lokynge was there at that tyme vpon hȳ and moche meruayllynge the straungers what that
he was / for the comyn voyce was that Ponthus was gone in to the realme of Poullain / & of Hungary to a warre whiche was there / wherfore none ne wyst that it was he. It taryed not longe that Bernarde de la ro¦che whiche had ye first arowe in his shelde: came ryght nobly armed / with grete foyson of trumpes / and ta∣boures with suche a sowne that all men meruaylled. The knyght toke a cuppe of golde & put it in the well and wette the stone withall / and the water sprange a brode / and it began to thonder & to hayle / and to be a stronge tempest / but it dured not longe / & moche mer¦uaylled the straūgers of that well / for alway he spryn¦cled it tofore yt he wente to fyghte. Syth toke he his horse agayn / and his helme on his heed / and toke his spere and smote his horse with ye spores towarde Ber¦narde / and Bernarde to hym / and gaue hym togyder so grete strokes yt they brake theyr sheldes / and passed ouer & came agayne / & smote togyder in suche wyse that Bernarde and his hors fell / but Bernarde sterte vpon his fete / and whan the blacke knyght sawe him on fote / he alyght & ranne vpon hym with his sharpe swerde of stele / and gaue hym grete strokes where he myght take hym / & Bernarde defended hym to his power / but Ponthus smote so grete strokes / and soo harde / that he bette downe what that euer he toke / & so moche that he smote soo grete a strote that he bette thauentayll of his helme / & all the sercle / & hurte hym a lytel in ye vysage / and Bernarde lyfte vp his swerde and smote Ponthus / but Ponthus caste his shelde to fore hym / & the stroke fell vpon the shelde / entred in halfe a fote / & in suche wyse that he myght not haue out his swerde agayne so strongly it helde. And Pon∣thus
apperceyued that drewe the shelde to hym wt so grete strength soo moche that the dwerfe & all togy∣der came at ones. And whā Bernarde sawe yt he was wtout swerde / he was ryght euyll at ease. And Pon∣thus sayd vnto him. Syr knyght it is tyme yt ye go in to ye fayrest ladyes mercy of this realme / & Bernarde answered neuer a worde as he that was angry. And Ponthus sayd vnto hym / syr knyght neuer & god wyl shall I do no thynge to you whan I se ye haue no thȳ¦ge to defende you wt. Than Bernarde came & wende to haue taken hȳ wt his fystes. And Ponthus whiche was grete & stronge / he manfully toke hym by ye hel∣me / & he drewe hym to hym felly / yt he made hȳ to fall vpon his handes to the erth / & had hym downe vnder hym / & sayd vnto hȳ. I shall let you go vnto ye fayrest gentylwomannes pryson / & salue her on ye blacke kny¦ghtes behalfe. And so he withdrewe hym / & Bernarde sawe well the debonayrte of the blacke knyght / & pray¦sed hym moche / & came to ye knyghtes whiche behelde the batayll & sayd vnto them / fayre lordes I haue foū¦de my mayster. Neuer afor ne foūde I so harde a kny¦ghte / ne so curteys / ne so stronge. So aske I you yt ye tell me whiche is ye fayrest gentylwoman of this real∣me & they helde them to Sydoyne ye knyges doughter & she had the voyce of them all / & he departed than to go to Uennes. Ponthus lepte vpon his horse & smote hym wt the spores / & wente in to the forest / as faste as the hors myght go by certayne wayes whiche yt he kne¦we / so yt none ne wyste where he became / & came to ye pryoury & entred in & closed ye gates after hȳ & alyght and vnarmed hȳ. And ye gentylwoman & the dwarfe / & all other wt vysers abode in ye pauylyons tyll that it
was nyght. And whan that all people were withdra∣wen and done they came theyr way. Soo here leue I of theym and retourne agayne vnto Sydoyne and Bernarde de la Roche. Sydoyne was bothe day and nyght in grete sorowe and vnhertes ease / for whan her gentylwoman hadde tolde her how Ponthus had sayd vnto her that he wolde goo a lytell whyle out of that countree. Soo she thought that it was for the e∣uyll chere that she hadde made hym / tho she repented her ryghte sore / and bewaylled her selfe oftentymes and sayd. Alas caytyfe now haue I loste hym by my grete foly / shamed be they that brought me fyrst su∣che tydynges / for I se well and knowe that yf it we∣re not for fere that he hadde that I sholde haue be wro¦the with hym he wolde not haue lefte the countre. It was vnto me grete foly for to put in doubte that his swete herte sholde not haue be trewer than ony other / than she wepte and sorowed in her herte for very fere that she sholde haue loste hym soo she sorowed daye & nyght. There were many grete complayntes in the courte for the goynge awaye of Ponthus. The kynge was heuy and myght haue no reste and oftentymes wysshed after hym / and so dyde his cosyn germayne and all his felowes / and all maner of people bothe gre¦te and small / and the courte was in grete heuynes for hym. It was but lytell whyle after that Bernarde de la Roche came vnto courte and asked fayre Sydoyne sayenge that he was her prysoner / the kynge sente for her and she came with a grete foyson of ladyes and of gentylwomen / and theyr assembled knyghtes and all maner of people bothe grete and small to here the lor∣de la roche Bernarde. And whā she was come downe in to the hall / tho Bernarde kneled doune to her & spa¦ke
on hyghe yt al men myght here hȳ & sayd. Madame to you sendeth me ye blacke knyght wt the whyte teres the whiche by his worthynesse hath cōquered me in ar¦mes & bad me yt I sholde yelde me prysoner to ye fay∣rest gentylwoman of this realme. So haue I enquy¦red of all the knyghtes & squyers yt were there whiche was the fayrest / & they all helde them to one voyce to you. So yelde I me to you & in to your pryson as your knyght / & ye to haue power to doo as of your owne / & yet he bad me yt I sholde salewe you from hȳ. Sydoy¦ne wexed reed & was asshamed by cause ye men helde her ye fayrest. Trewly sayd she I thanke them all / but they haue symply aduysed me. And I thanke the kny∣ghte yt sent you hyder / but tel me yf ye wote fro whens he is. Truly said he madame nay. O sayd ye kȳge may no man knowe what he is / truly no sayd Bernarde / but so moche I say you he is the goodlyest knyght ar∣med yt euer I sawe / & the best can smyte bothe wt spe∣re & wt swerde. And me semeth yt he is somwhat more thā was Ponthus & he is moche lyke hȳ / but it is not he / for men say yt he is in ye realme of poulayne or in hū¦gary at ye warres whiche ben there. There was moche spekȳge of ye blacke knight / & how yt he sholde ye nexte tuesdaye fyght wt Geffrey de lesygnen / & wt Androwe de la toure on ye other tuesday & than after yt wt ye Erle of mortayne. The kȳge & all ye ladyes made grete che∣re vnto ye lorde de la roche / & they dyde ete all togyder in the hall wt the kȳge at mete. Sydoyne bourded wt Bernarde and sayd tho vnto him / lorde de la roche I am ryght Ioyfull to haue suche a prysoner as ye be. So ye ought to haue grete doubte of the prysonynge
that ye shall haue to suffre. And Bernarde began for to smyle & said. Madame yf ye shewe me none harder prysonȳge thā this is I shal suffre it wel. And wete it well as I thȳke or this yere be passed / ye shal haue mo¦re largely / and so shall I not be allone. After dyner be¦gan the daunces and the karolles / but Sydoyne daū∣ced but a lytell / and yet wolde she haue daunced lesse ne had ben for fere ye men sholde haue perceyued her / sorowe. ¶How Ponthus conquered Geffrey de Lelygnen and sente hym vnto Sydoyne. THe daye fayre & clere & the lorde of Lesygnen / the whiche was a meruayllous good knyght was armed and on horsbacke & came before the foun∣tayne.
And ye blacke knyght lepte out of his pauylyon his spere in his hande / & ye shelde aboute his necke & as sone as eche of them sawe other / they let theyr hor∣ses renne gyuȳge grete strokes with theyr speres So that bothe horses fell vpon theyr arses / & almoost all was ouerthrowen. Neuerthelesse they rose agayne & toke other speres grete & strōge & sharpe / & they affer∣red eche frome other / & came agayne as faste as theyr horses myght dryue for to Iuste ye one ayenst ye other / & gaue so grete strokes on ye sheldes yt all ouerthrewe bothe knyghtes & horses / & was so rudely yt the hors of Geffrey felle ye heed vnder the body & myght not stere neyther knyght nor hors / for Geffrey had his legge & his thygh vnder ye hors / & was ryght sore brused. But ponthus rose agayne vpon his horse / & yet he was sore ashamed yt he was ouerthrowen. So loked he on the knyght yt myght not stere frome vnder his hors / than he alyght & came to ye knyght & dyde so moche yt he dre¦we hym from vnder his hors / & he had his fote out of Ioynte / & so he myght not stande but vpon one fote / & yet he layde his honde on his swerde as he yt was of grete herte & grete hardynesse. And whā Ponthus sa∣we yt he myght not stonde but vpon one fote / he wolde not smyte hym but lete hym smyte a stroke or two / & sayd vnto hym. Syr knyght I se you in a symple par¦ty / & shame it were for me for to assayle you. And gef∣frey sayd wherfore I holde me not ouercome as lon∣ge as I may holde my swerde in my hande / & whā he wende to stryke Ponthus he mette with a stone wt his fote whiche made hym for to ouerthrowe. And whan Ponthus sawe yt he dyde helpe hȳ for to ryse agayne. And sayd vnto hym. Syr knyght & yf ye were hole I
wolde renne vpon you / but I se well your dysease / & ye shall not yelde you to me / but to the fayrest gentyl∣woman of all brytayne yt whiche shall take you to her mercy / and salewe her from the blacke knyght / soo I praye you that we do no more than we haue done / for I wote well yf ye were in good estate ye wolde not le¦ue me soo hole as ye haue letfte me / for I knowe well your worthynesse of tyme passed. And whan Geffrey sawe the debonayrete and grete bounte of the blacke knyght he praysed hym moche and sayd. Syr I shall go where yt it pleaseth you to cōmaunde me. And yf I wyste that it sholde not displease you I wolde aske you your name. And ponthous answered hȳ agayne Syr ye nor none other shall wete it at this tyme. And Geffrey helde hym styll and wolde no more enquere. And ponthus toke his leue of hym & wente his waye pryuely in to the forest by the pathes as he was wonte to do. So the people that sawe the batayll meruayled moche and sayd. Ryght curteys is the blacke knyghte haue ye not seene his debonayrete and his grete gen∣tylnes how he wolde helpe hym vp. Moche they pray¦sed hym and gaue hym grete loos. Soo they came to Geffrey de lesygnen that myght not bestere hym. So he sayd vnto Androwe de la toure / fayre frende and felowe I shall abyde tyll the nexte tuesdaye comynge for to holde you felawshyppe for to goo vnto the fayre Sydoyne yf ye sette no better remedy in you that I haue done in me. Syr sayd Androwe de la toure / of ye auenture of armes may noo man Iuge / for they be ryght meruayllous / and ye myght not doo therto of this auenture / for it was befall of your horse wherof noo man may beware. And I thynke not for to haue
shame yf I pursewe suche knyghtes as ye and Ber∣narde de la Roche. Soo they spake of many dyuerse thynges / and so he was taken & lyfte vp as softely as men myght / & was ledde vnto Moūtfort / where yt he was dyght yt he myght ryde with a palet. ¶How ye thyrde tuesdaye Ponthus conquered landry and sente hym vnto Sydoyne. THe nexte tuesdaye came from euery parte peo¦ple to se the batayll / at the houre of pryme the blacke knyght with ye whyte teres came / & of ye other syde came landry / & than they caste theyr speres in the restes with ye guffanons hangynge & with grete Ire eche of them smote other without ouerthrowynge / soo they passed forth & came agayne ryght rudely / so mo∣che that they persed theyr sheldes and brake theyr spe∣res / and than they toke theyr swerdes / and eche gaue other grete strokes where they myght reche. So they were a grete whyle on horsbacke / & so befell that Pon¦thus dressed hȳ well & smote landry wtall his strength that he made hym astonyed / & whan Ponthus had do so he sawe hym staker / soo he toke hym by the helme & drewe hym with all his strength so yt he cast hym to ye erth / but neuertheles he rose vp agayne / & whan Pon¦thus sawe hym at the erth / he sayd that he sholde not assayle hȳ on horsebacke & ye other on fote / for it sholde tourne hym to shame / but anone he alyght & put his shelde tofore hym / & his swerde in his hande / & came rennynge vpon hȳ. And Landry dressed hym & made hym redy to defende hym / for he wyst well he had not a do wt a chylde / & Ponthus came & smote hȳ a stroke & the swerde glaunced / & smote away a quarter of his shelde & landry smote hȳ ayen grete strokes / where he
myght reche hym / and ryght well he defended hym to his power lyke a good knyghte / for he was meruay∣lously stronge / harde & manly / soo he endured moche. Ponthus gaue hȳ grete strokes where he myght hyt hym. So he meruaylled moche how he myght endure ayenst hym so longe. Soo they brake theyr sheldes / & theyr helmes / & they were so wery at the fyrst assaute that they must nedes reste theym / & to take theyr bre∣thes / & they lened vpon theyr swerdes for werynesse. And than Androwe spake fyrst & sayd. Syr knyght I wote not what ye be / but soo moche I saye you yt I wende not in the mornynge to haue founde so moche strength & worthynes in you as I haue proued / but be¦fore or ye haue conquered me in armes ye must do mo¦re than ye haue done yet / ye sayd Ponthus by the holy fayth ye shall yelde you to the fayre gentylwoman / or myne herte lyeth / & bere her this gyfte of this swerde Than he lyft vp his swerde / & smote Androwe as he whiche hadde grete angre & shame that he endured so longe ayenst hym. And so began the batayll soo harde that the blode ranne from them doune to the groūde. And Ponthus hadde gyuen hym a grete stroke vpon the temple / so that his helme was broken / so tourned he his shelde / & toke his swerde with bothe his handes and smote Androwe so grete a stroke that he was all astonyed / and it was no meruayll for ryght longe had the batayll endured bytwene them bothe yt with grete payne they myght stonde. So ofte he smote hym that he apperceyued well that Androwe was wery & asto∣nyed of strokes that he had gyuen & receyued / & so he hasted hym more & more soo moche that he sawe hym staker / so he came & put hym with all his myght / and
caste hym downe and fell bothe to the erth / but Pon∣thus fell vpon hym soo yt Androwe myght not ryse / & Ponthus sayd vnto hȳ. Syr knyght yelde you / & An∣drowe sayd no worde / & endured moche payne & had grete sorowe to yelde hym. So sayd he to hȳ agayne as he whiche was ryght courteys. Syr knyght yelde you to the fayre gentylwoman I praye you and that there be no more debate bytwene you and me / for we haue preued vs ynough togyder. And than Androwe knewe well the grete courtosye of the knyght whiche that he faught with / & sayd vnto hym / to her shall I yelde me gladly syth that it pleaseth you. It suffyseth me sayd Ponthus / & than he rose vp ryght wery / and moche trauayled of the grete strokes and of the grete batayll that had so longe endured / soo he came to his hors with moche payne & lepte vp and wente in to the forest where he sawe the thyckest soo faste that euery man loste the syght of hym. And Geffrey de lesygnen & many other came to Androwe & asked how he dyde & he sayd well after the disease that he hadde / but that he had foūde his mayster. A sayd Geffrey fayre fren∣de we shall go you & I togyder to the ryght fayre lady & we shall yelde vs to her mercy. Syr sayd Androwe I shall bere you felawshyp / for it were no reason that ye sholde go without me. And so bourded that one fe∣lawe with ye other. Soo he was vnarmed & had grete foyson of woundes / but he stode in no daunger / for he had no woūde that myght lette hȳ to ryde. So wente they on the thyrde daye after to yelde theym to fayre Sydoyne. And the kynge made theym grete chere & grete Ioye as to two of the beste knyhgtes that men myght fynde in ony londe / & moost named of worthy
knyghthode. So they came to Sydoyne / & put them in to her mercy. And she whiche was ryght wyse and gentyll receyued them with grete Ioye / & fested them & dyde them grete worshyp / & gaue them mantelles of sylke furred with veer & gyrdelles fayre & ryche / & on euery gyrdell a ryche gypsyer & the knyghtes than¦ked her / & sayd well was befall them of her pryson / & that she was not harde for to endure. Lordes sayd she I wote not who is ye knyght that sendeth you hyder but he & ye do me ryght grete worshyp without cause for fayrer & goodlyer ben ynough in this realme who that wyll seche them & chose them. Madame sayd cho∣knyghtes we must byleue the comyn / for all haue the sen you for the fayrest. Soo they bourded ynoughe of many thynges / & abode there two dayes yt one wt the kȳge that other wt her after yt she gaue them leue. So they departed for goo se the batayll of the erle of mor∣tayne whiche was a ryght good knyght.
¶How the fourth tuesday Ponthus conquered Thy¦bault de bloys erle of mortayne & sent hym as ye other & also of other knyghtes on tuesdaye ensewynge. SO the olde gentylwoman / & the dwarfe came out of ye pauylyon & had a bowe turkoys and her foure arowes as ye haue herde before / & the here∣myte with the vyser ledde her by the brydell / and ma∣de her sygne to whiche she sholde shote as at for that moneth. And the olde gentylwoman smote fyrst in ye shelde of Thybault de bloys / the whiche was named for a good knyght. And the other arowe in the shelde of damp Martyne. The thyrde arowe in the shelde of Henry de moūt maurency / and the fourth arowe was in the shelde of Roberte de resyllyon. These were the foure knyghtes moost named of whome that the shel∣des of theyr armes were hanged vp / & whan she had shote her foure arowes she withdrewe her to the pa∣uylyon. And anone after the blacke knyght came out armed with all his armes / his shelde aboute his necke the spere in his hande. And on the other syde came in Thybault the erle of mortayne ryght rychely arayed with grete foyson of trumpettes and taboures. And as soone as eche of theym sawe other / they lette theyr horses renne and gaue grete strokes. But Ponthus reuersed so the erle that he hadde almoost beten hym downe vnto the grounde. So they sette hande vpon theyr swerdes / and eche of them ranne vpon an other ryght rudely / but Ponthus smote so myghty strokes and so harde that he kerued a two all that euer he hyt the Erle defended hym to his power. Soo endured the batayll ryghte longe / but Ponthus whiche was grete and stronge toke hym by the helme and drewe
hym so sore that he rente it frome hym & threwe it to to the groūde. And than abode in his coyfet of yren on whiche he gaue hym a grete stroke sayenge vnto hym that he sholde yelde hym / but he smote hym not with the cuttynge. And the erle endured moche but nedes he muste yelde hym whyther he wolde or not. Soo he badde hym yelde hym to the fayrest lady of Brytayne So he departed & wente in to the forest as he dyde be¦fore. And the erle wente & yelde hym vnto fayre Sy∣doyne as the other knyghtes dyde whiche dyde hym grete worshyp / and so dyde her fader the kynge. The nexte tuesdaye faught Tybault de bloys / & soo all the other tyll the yeres ende after folowynge. But it were to longe taryenge to tell the Iustes and the bataylles that euery man dyde in that moneth & in all the other monethes & in all the other monethes folowynge / for there were many fayre Iustes & grete bataylles / and many noble dedes of armes / the whiche sholde be to longe for to tell who that wolde rehers theym all. But the ende was that they were all ouercome in armes / and sente in to the pryson of fayre Sydoyne. So they were two & fyfty knyghtes prysoners of the best that men myght fynde in ony londes for to conquere wor∣shyp. Euery man herde & sawe that the good knygh∣tes wente to assaye themselfe / & that he chose alwaye the best that men myght fynde to do dedes of armes Euery man desyred for to be of ye nombre for to assaye them ayenst hym. And so grete was the voyce & the re∣nowme ranne thrughe fraūce almayne / & by all other countrees / that all knyghtes came & henge vp theyr sheldes. So there came many of the realme of fraūce & of other realmes & countrees. And Ponthus chose
alwaye by worthynes the best & faught but with one of euery countree bycause his name sholde go the fer∣ther. So was there of the nombre of the two & fyftye. The duke of Osteryche / the duke of Lorayne / the Er∣le of baar / the erle of Mountbelyart / the erle of moū∣fort / and other dukes and erles. Syr Wylyam of ba∣yrs. Syr Arnolde of henaude / the erle of Sauoye / & other dyuerse good knyghtes / soo leue I of theyr na∣mes for it were ouer longe to tell / & so I torne agayne for to abredge my mater / soo that it befell yt whytson∣tyde was come at the yeres ende that all ye prysoners came for to yelde them ther as it was ordeyned. Pon¦thus dyde make a grete halle couered with leues / and a fayre grene fast by the foūtayne of meruaylles that men called Belenson. And sent for al maners of mete & wynes & for all maner of stuffe & thā he wrote vnto the kynge of Brytayne saynge. The blacke knyght wt the whyte teeres wt all humylyte & honoure moost me¦kely recōmaundeth hym vnto your moost noble & ex∣cellent grace. The blacke knyght besecheth you meke∣ly that it please your hyghnesse for to be at this feest of Pentecost in the forest of briciiun at the fountayne of meruaylles with the fayrest ladyes and gētylwomen that is in all your realme. And also yt it pleaseth you not to forgete my lady your doughter for to se & coun∣sayll to whome ye pryce shall be gyuen / that is to hym the whiche hathe best Iusted and myghtyest fough∣ten of the two and fyghty knyghtes / for euery tewes∣daye of the yere. Whan the kynge had sene the lettres he hadde ryghte grete Ioye / and sayd that the blacke knyght had done him grete worshyp / & yt there sholde he be / & than he sente for his doughter / & tolde her the
tydynges that was sente hym. And charged her for to sende for the fayrest ladyes and gentylwomen of his realme to come vnto her at ye Penthecost. And fayre doughter ye ought for to doo it for ye knyght hath done you grete worshyp that by his swerde hath sente in to your pryson so many good knyghtes & lordes wherof grete worshyp is fal vnto you & also vnto your realme for the whiche I am moche beholdynge vnto ye blacke knyght. Fayre Sydoyne kneled downe and sayd syth that it pleaseth you I shall do your cōmaundemente. So she dyde wryte lettres vnto ye grete ladyes of Bry¦tayne that they sholde be with her the frydaye afore whytsondaye And that they sholde brynge in theyr cō¦pany the fayrest ladyes and gentylwomen that men myght fynde. The ladyes that herde the maundemen¦te of Sydoyne they had grete Ioye and made theym redy and came to that Iourney. And there was a gre¦te assemble. So they came vpon whytsondaye to the foūtayne with theyr tentes and pauylyons / and they were pyght there aboute that they semed as it were a grete hoost. Ponthus came agaynst the kȳge. And he hadde sente the day tofore .xiii. gownes of a sute to his xiii. felowes / and one to herlaunt ye senesshall / bycau∣se that they sholde bere him felowshyp. It nedeth not to aske yf his cosyn germayne and his felowshyp had grete Ioye of the worshyp that god had sente hym & whan they kynge wyst yt it was Ponthus yt had done so moche in armes it nedeth not to aske ye Ioy he had of it and the chere yt he made hym / & colled hym & kys∣sed hym / & than he sayd vnto hym / ye haue longe hyd you frome vs / and men sayd that ye were in hungary and in poullayne at warres / yt were there but in good
fayth myne herte tolde me that it was ye that dyde su¦che meruaylles. Ponthus wexed rede & sayd nothyn∣ge for he was ashemed that the kynge praysed hym so moche. ¶How Ponthus made to make a conuys and made to be gyuen vnto euery knyght after as they hadde de¦serued. AFter that he wente agaynst Sydoyne yt was accompanyed with many fayre ladyes. And salewed her mekely / & she yelded him agayne his salu¦tacyon / as she that had all Ioye yt herte myght thyn∣ke / & than she sayd vnto hȳ in smylynge O Ponthus ye haue hyd you lōge tyme frō vs in this forest I dou∣te me yt ye be become an ermyte & wylde. A madame
sayd he saue your grace I am easy to tame. And than he departed frome her as he that was all taken in the loue of his lady that of lōge tyme he had not sene her And than he wente too se the ladyes the whiche were all dysguysed with grene bowes & garlondes / and he sayd vnto them. My ladyes I praye god that eche of you haue that yt your hertes desyre / for in good fayth it is a good syght to se soo fayre a company. The lady¦es yelded hym his salutacyon / the whiche were full of Ioye for to se hym for they loued hym meruayllously well aboue all knyghtes. And the one sayd to another It is Ponthus the good and fayre knyghte thanked be god of the grete worshyp that he hathe sente hym and I praye god that he wyll kepe hym vs as the best knight of the worlde / and this was there speche ferre and nere. So they arryued at the fountayne bothe ye kynge and the ladyes / with grete Ioye. And on that other syde came the knyghtes straungers. The kyn∣ge and the ladyes made them grete Ioye. And there was grete sowne and noyse of dyuers maners of mȳ∣stralsy so that all the wode ronge of it. And the kynge and ponthus dyd grete worshyp to the dukes and lor∣des / as to the duke of Ostrytche of Lorayne & of ba∣ar / & to the erle of dampmartyn of Sauoye of moūt∣belyart & to other dyuers grete lordes. So they wente and herde masse that the bysshop of Rennz sange / af∣ter that they came to the halle. And the kynge / the du∣kes and Sydoyne were sette at the hygh dese / and af¦ter euery man after as he was. Greate was the feest and grete was the hall / and on the syde were hanged the .lii. sheldes of the knyghtes conquered Ryght stra¦unge and fayre thynges were made bytwene the cour¦ses
as armed chyldren that fought togyder / & dyuers other thynges / and syxe olde knyghtes / and syxe olde squyers / some bare the spere & the gouffanon blacke with the whyte teeres of grete margaretes & oryente perles / & a ryche cercle of golde meruayllously wrou∣ght of ryche perles and of good stones. The other ba∣re the ryche swerde with the pomel of golde / And the gyrdell of sylke wrought with golde & grete margare∣tes and perles / & with precyous stones that it was a fayre syght to se. And this rychesse had ponthus won in the shyp of the Soudans sone. So he sayd hymself that he myght no better beset them than afore so ma∣ny notable prynces and grete lordes / for he shewed all his dedes ryght honourably. The knyghtes and ye la∣dyes wente aboute the halle syngynge as though they wyste not to whome they sholde presente theym. And than they came before the lorde de Lesygnen and pre∣sented hym the spere and the ffouffanon and the ryche cercle of golde ye whiche they set vpon his hede / for ye beste Iuster. And after they came to Androwe de la toure and presented hym the ryche swerde and the ry∣che crowne set vpon his heed / whyther he wolde or no for he excused hymselfe moche & wende to haue refu∣sed it saynge that they dyde hym worshyp that he had not deserued and that there were dyuerse other that had better wonne it than he had and he wexed rede & was ashamed / but Ponthus hadde so ordeyned it for he sayd in good fayth that he had yeuen hym moost a do as for one daye. Also Geffrey hadde ryght wel Ius¦ted. Than beganne mynstrelles for to playe of all ma¦ner of mynstrelsy and also the herauldes began to cry that men sholde not haue herde thondrynge / for al rō∣ge
bothe wood and forest of the noyse. There was gy¦uen many dyuerse meases and good wynes and also grete yeftes vnto heraudes and mynstrelles. Ponth{us} came behynde the kynge and sayd to hym in his ere. Syr & it please you we shall do crye the Iustes ayenst to morowe / and on tewesdaye at Uennes bycause yt ye sholde knowe these prynces / and these dukes / for it shall be your worshyppe. A sayd ye kȳge in good fayth it is a good and a trewe counseyll and I praye you that it be done. Than Ponthus called an heraude and made hym to crye that the whyte knyght with the re∣de rode shall be this mondaye and tewesdaye in ye cy∣te of Uennes with fyue felowes and hymselfe shall make the syxte for to withstande all maner of knygh∣tes with speres. And he that shall haue the pryce on ye mondaye without forth shall haue the gyrdell and the gypsere of ye fayrest of the feest. And he that dooth best on the tewesdaye shall haue the sparohawke mewed with the loynes of perles and margarytes / and a cha¦pelet that the fayrest of the feest shall gyue hym. And he of the ynner partye that shall Iuste best shall haue a rynge of the fayrest. ¶How Ponthus made a Iustes to be cryed in the cy∣te of Uennes and how he smote downe the strongest that he recountred. ON ye morowe after they departed by tymes / & wente and herde masse at saynt peters of Uen∣nes / and than they wente and dyned / and after dyner the kynge & the ladyes wente to the schalfoldes. And than came Ponthus & his hors al whyte with a grete
rede rose that betokened his lady / & his fyue felowes of the whiche one was Bernarde de la Roche / the vy∣count of Lyon / the vycount of donges. Polydes and Herlaunt ye senesshall all good knyghtes. The Iustes were grete on the mondaye and on the tewesdaye the¦re were many grete Iustes and many grete strokes gyuen. But ouer all knyghtes Ponthus Iusted beste for he bete downe knyghtes & horses / & dyd suche mer¦uaylles yt euery knyght doubted to mete wt hym so he set bothe herte & wyl bycause yt his lady was there pre¦sent / bothe grete & small praysed hym moche / the la∣dyes sayd se hym come yt beteth all downe before hym He is a grete fole that gooth agaynst hym / his spere spareth no man but yt he hurteth hym or felleth hym.
Sydoyne sawe well that the ladyes & all other prey∣sed him she sayd no worde but kepte her selfe close that no man sholde apperceyue that she had more Ioye of hym than of another how moche that her herte hadde all maner of Ioye. Ryght well Iusted the duke of Of trytche and he of Loreyne the erle of Sauoye the erle of mountbelyart & many other but it were to longe to tell. And all the good Iusters / on the monday and on the tewesdaye were ryght worshypfully feested. At ye souper on the tewesdaye the feest was grete and large they gaue the pryce on the mondaye of the vtter par∣tye to the erle of mountbelyart ryght a good knyght and he had the gyrdell and the Gypsere of Sydoyne bycause that she was chosen for the fayrest of the feest The pryce of without on the tewesdaye was yeuen to the duke of Ostryche. Soo hadde he the sparohawke with the ryche loynes and the chapelet of Sydoyne / Ponthus hadde the pryce on mondaye as of within. And he wolde that the pryce vpon tewesdaye within sholde haue ben gyuen vnto the lorde de la Roche the whiche hadde beste Iusted of all the other saue oonly Ponthus the whiche no man myght come nere by fer The ladyes sente a rynge with a greate Rubye vnto Ponthus. And an ouche ryghte ryche vnto Bernarde lorde de la Roche / Heraude & mynstrelles ledde grete Ioye and grete noyse. After souper they carolled and daunsed / & sange songes tyll mydnyght / & than they dranke and ete spyces. And after that the straungers toke theyr leue of the kynge and of Sydoyne and of the grete ladyes. And they departed on wednesdaye by tymes whan they had herde masse & Ponthus con∣ueyed thē to ye castell of gyron where he had ordeyned
them a dyner / & after dyner he wolde haue conueyed theym ferther / but the lordes wolde not suffre hym / & yet he offered hymselfe ryght moche vnto theym / & so they toke theyr leue that one of that other. The lordes bothe grete & small they praysed moche Ponthus of his good felawshyp & of his good chere / & that trewly he was the goodlyest knyght & the best and the moost gracyous of the worlde at theyr aduyse / & that there was none lyke hym / and also they praysed moche Sy¦dyone of her beaute & of her curtesye and that he that sholde haue her sholde be well eurous. And Ponthus tourned agayne to the kynge and to the ladyes. After dyner the ladyes and the knyghtes of Brytayne toke theyr leue of the kynge & of his doughter. The kynge and his doughter came syngynge & sportynge theym towarde syclynere. On a tyme Sydoyne & Ponthus spake togyder. So sayd Sydoyne vnto Ponthus ye haue hyde you longe tyme from vs / & I meruaylled moche that I herde none other tydynges frome you. Madame sayd he I sent you euery weke a messanger Ye saye trouth swete frende sayd she / ye sente me the moost notable messangers that myght be founde. Ne¦uertheles it wolde haue done me grete pleasure to ha∣ue wyst who had sente them syth that they came from you for euery man sayd ye were in hungary. And also I meruaylled moche that ye dyde me none otherwyse to wete of your goynge awaye / & therfore myne herte was in ryght grete disease. A madame he sayd I was here nyghe you that were in my herte & in my thought and all yt euer I dyde I thought to do it for your loue & for to encrease your good renowne / for I wyst well that ye sholde be chosen for the fayrest of Brytayne / &
so I haue done soo moche that the best knyghtes that men knowe of eche countre be come for to se you and to put them in your mercy. But for all that madame in good fayth it was not I that dyde it it was ye ma∣dame / wherfore I thanke you for the power and the hardynesse ye gaue me / for of my selfe I durste not ha¦ue vndertake it. Ponthus sayd she I wote well that this goodnes and worshyp cometh to you frome god and frome none other / but that is for that ye loue god and drede he hath gyuen you the grace and the hardy∣nesse / and the strength soo ye ought for to thanke hym hyghly. Madame he sayd so do I / but I thynke well that the enterpryse came frome you. Now Ponthus sayd she leue we this talkynge for in good fayth ye gre¦test Ioye myn her¦te may haue is for to here good tydyn¦ges of you as lon∣ge as I fynde you trewe for the wor∣shyp of me & of my lord / madame said he of that be ye cer∣tayne / for I haue le¦uer to be deed than thynke other wyse by my fayth. Upon this talkynge arry¦ued Guenelet one of ye .xiiii. felawes.
¶How Ponthus was accused to the kynge by Gue∣nellet yt was amerous of Sydoyne his doughter. THis Guenellet was ryght enuyous & a fayre speker and a grete flaterer. Soo had he grete enuy at his mayster and had so grete sorowe that ony sholde be more mayster in the courte than he. Soo sa∣we the kȳge was olde & aged / and he thought that by fayre speche and flaterynge he wolde be mayster / & he thought to put out and estraunge his mayster whiche was the preuyest wt ye kȳge / & to doo hym treason. So he sawe the kynge alone in the wood where as he hun¦ted and sayd vnto hym. I shall tell you a grete coun∣seyll / so that ye wyll swere vpon kynges wordes that ye shall not dyscure me. I shall swere it to you sayd the kynge whiche was all good and true & mystrusted hym in no thynge. My ryght dredefull lorde sayd Gue¦nellet ye haue nourysshed me and made me / and all the good that I haue is of your well doynge / & ther∣fore oughte I for to haue you better than other fader and moder or all the worlde / soo maye not my herte suffre your domage nor dysworshyp / & therfore wyll I tell you a thynge whiche toucheth gretely agaynst your worshyp. How moche that I loue Pōthus more than ony man saue onely you. So wolde I suffre no thynge that sholde be ayenst your worshyp. Syr it is thus that Ponthus loueth my lady your doughter / & therfore be ye well aduertysed / for he is a ryght good knyght. Soo I haue doubte that some foly loue may fall bytwene them / wherof she & ye myght haue grete shame and dyshonour. A sayd the kynge Guenellet I se well that ye loue me ryght well / and that ye wolde not be glad of my dysworshyp soo am I ryght moche
beholdynge to you for euer more & I thanke you gre∣tely. And thus thanked hym the kynge as he yt wende that he had sayd trouth. And sayd Guenellet ye ought not to thanke me for I holde me so moche boūde vnto you that there is no thynge yt ony erthly man myght do for his lorde but that I wolde do it for you onely to dye for to alength your lyfe yf it nede were. But syr I tel you how ye shall preue hȳ / yf he saye that he loueth her not bydde hym swere & make an othe / & ye shall se perauenture that he wyll not. Now Guenellet had herde saye of Ponthus in the partyes of Galyce & of spayne a kynges sone sholde make none othe of thyn∣ge yt were put vpon hym as longe as he myght fyght therfore / & yf he dyde he sholde be dysworshypped / & therfore tolde he this to the kynge / for he wyste well yt he wolde make none othe / and by that waye he wolde set the kynge & hym at dystaūce / & for to estraūge hym from the countre for to haue the more rule gadered in to his owne hande / for an enuyous man may no thyn¦ge suffre. The kynge was all pensyfe & angry of these tydynges as he whiche loued his doughter meruay∣lously well was aferde to haue dyshonoure. Whan he was come fro ye wode & alyght of his hors. Ponthus whiche was there came tofore hym wenynge to haue taken his swerde & his gloues as he had done before of customes / but the kynge tourned hym frome hym warde and made no semblaūt to hym nor to speke to hym / whan Ponthus apperceyued it he wyste well yt the kynge was dyspleased with hym / soo wente he to hym & sayd / syr how is it that ye are dyspleased with me for goddes loue tell me what I haue forfayted. Ha sayd the kynge whiche was ryght angrye. Ponthus.
Ponthus I haue made lytell nourture of you whan ye haue auysed you for to dyshonour me / how syr sayd Ponthus by what waye By that waye sayd ye kynge that ye loue my doughter for to dyshonoure her. And I haue no chylde but her and she is all my Ioye and all the lengthynge of my lyfe Syr said Ponthus who tolde you so / yf there be ony that dare saye it nowe I am redy for to preue it with my body that he lyeth fal∣sely saue your honour. Nay sayd the kynge yf ye wyll swere vpon holy gospels that ye loue her not as I ha¦ue sayd / parauenture I wyll byleue you. Syr for to say that I loue her not as I owe to loue the doughter of my ryghtfull lorde I say not the contrary / but that I wolde doo thynge or thynke that sholde touche the dysworshyp of her or of you I shall answere as a true knyght ought to do / and syr ye wote well ye ought not to aske me none other thynge to my worshyppe / for ye wote well ynoughe that a kynges sone oughte not to make none othe of noo thynge that were put vpon hym as longe as he myght defende hym with his bo∣dy And that is the vsage of the countre where I was borne I wote neuer sayd ye kynge whiche was ryght fell and angry of the wordes that he had herde. Syr sayd Ponthus yet wyll I offre you more that I wyll fyght with two or thre yf there be ony that wyl mayn∣tene it / for I fele my quaryll so good and so clene that I am all in certayne that god shall helpe me as a true Iuge. A sayd the kynge ye holde yourselfe so stronge & so knyghtly yt ye wote well there dare none fyght wt you. A syr sayd Ponthus I offre you all that euer I may with my worshyp profre. The kȳge passed forth and sayd ye batayll sholde not be done as for y• dde.
¶How Ponthus toke leue of the fayre Sydoyne. WHan Ponthus sawe that he was ryght sorow¦full and angry bycause yt he was a kynges so∣ne he was sory for to make an othe yt it sholde torne hym to dyshonour and to reprefe / and on the o∣ther syde bycause the kynge wolde do hym no ryght / So he came to the kynge and toke his leue of hym / & sayd vnto hym that he wolde not dwelle in his courte in mysbyleue nor in suspeccyon and thus departed he and came vnto Sydoyne and tolde her how the kyn∣ge had sayd vnto hym / and how he had offered for to fyght with two or thre and how that the kynge wolde do hym no ryght / and wolde make hym to be sworne to his dysworshyp. And whan Sydoyne vnderstode
this it nedeth not to aske yf she had grete sorowe and sayd. A god whiche ben these false tryatours flaterers that so grete vntrouth and lesynges haue contryued for by my fayth I dare swere in god that in our loue was neuer vnclenly thought. But thus it is that en∣uye may neuer deye. Madame said he by my fayth ye saye trouth. But I wyll take my leue of you with as grete sorowe and heuynesse as euer toke knyghte of his lady. A sayd she swete loue ye were better to ma∣ke the othe for ye may do it surely and to put away all blame. A madame sayd he neuer sholde I dare be se∣ne in the countre where I was borne. And neuer god wyll that I be the fyrste of kynges sones that sholde make an othe / for it sholde be a reprefe to myn heyres for euer more. Madame how moche that the body go the from you a whyle I shall be with you at the seuen yeres ende / and I be a lyue / yf soner I come not / wher¦fore I praye you & yf it please you to kepe you frome maryenge vnto that tyme & ye may. A sayd she how the terme is set longe / and I shall be the whyle so so∣rowfull and shall haue so many heuy dayes & sorow∣full houres to suffre. At these wordes she was all va∣nysshed & fell in a swowne. They had bothe theyr her∣tes soo heuy that with grete payne they myght speke. saue onely that they embrased eche other / and the te∣res fell downe fromr theyr eyen. And Ponthus put his hatte before his eyen and departed and wente to his chambre and shytte the dore to hym / and than his herte waxed all heuy and sayd to hymselfe yt he was the moost vnhappyest knyght that lyued whan suche a lady may receyue blame for hym without ony cause And also he leseth all Ioye / for to leue ye countree and
the syght of his lady where euer he gooth. So he com∣playned and bewaylled hymselfe sorowfully / & whan he had ben a whyle in suche payne and sorowe he re∣frayned and enforced hymselfe to be of good chere / & yf he had sorowe Sydoyne had no lesse / for she entred in to her garderobe and called Elyos with her & whan she sawe no mo but they two and that they were alo∣ne than began her sorowe soo meruayllous grete that it was pyte to se. ¶How Sydoyne complayned ryght pyteously the departynge of her louer Ponthus.
A Sayd she Elyos my loue he gooth his waye ye fayre / the good / ye floure of knyghthode / and of curtesye / and the best on lyue / and the best instructe and he that hathe best maner of demeanynge amon∣ge all maner estates & all maner men / and it is good reason / for he loueth and dredeth god / and worshyp∣peth the aeged and the wyse people / & is honourable and humble bothe to grete and lytell / he is morrour of all largesse / & of noblesse / what his swete herte is gen∣tyll and debonayr / what sholde my herte do after his departynge / but languysshe daye & nyght neuer to ha¦ue Ioye nor rest / & I wote well that his herte shal suf¦fre no lesse. Than she fell in a swowne / and Elyos to∣ke her in her armes and streyned her / and toke rose water and bespryncled her lady and comforted her ye fayrest she myght / but it auaylled not she was so soro∣wefull. And after she sayd A Elyos my swete loue I may not hyde my herte from you I loue you & truste you soo moche. But swete loue this sorowe cometh to me whan I thynke on the grete vntrouth that hathe ben contryued agaynst vs in that that we neuer thou∣ght / for truer loue was there neuer. And after that I thynke on the langage that shall be sayd theron / and than after by me he leseth the countre where he was soo moche byloued bothe of lytell and of grete / and all the harme that he hathe and shall haue is and shall be by me. And I am cause of all his myschyef. All these thynges putteth grete sorowe to my herte / so she ma∣de grete sorowe / and after she wyped her eyen. And so ne after she wente downe in to her grete chambre a∣monge her ladyes & gentylwomen / and made no fem¦blaūt that she had ony sorowe / for she was ryght wy∣se
and well coude she hyde herselfe. The ladyes & gen∣tylwomen wepte for pyte and sorowe of Ponthus / & sayd that cursed be they that suche false tydynges had contryued / but Sydoyne comforted them ryght swe∣tely. ¶How Ponthus departed from the courte of the kȳ∣ge of Brytayne. POnthus called a squyer and the yomen of his chambre and cōmaunded them to trusse & put in a clothesakcke all thynge that hym neded and than he toke his leue of the court and of euery man. So ne was there none but yt they ne wepte & cryed and rente theyr heer & made as grete sorowe as they had sene al theyr frendes deed soo moche they loued hym. So he
departed frome the courte. The barons and the kny∣ghtes and all that euer myght lepe on horsbacke con∣uyed hym syghynge and wepynge / & well they wen∣de for to haue witholde hym with fayrnesse saynge vn¦to hym that the kynge was aeged and redooted / and that ye ought not to sette his herte of nothynge that he sayd to hym. But he wolde not vnderstonde it and whan they had conueyed hym a two myle he abode & prayed theym to torne agayne. So he made theym to torne agayne whyder they wolde or not / at the leue ta∣kynge there was wepynge & waylynge ynough sayn∣ge. A Brytayne so moche thou oughtest well to wepe whan the gentyll and the good knyght whiche had ye in peas and Ioye / and kepte the from harmes / aduer¦saryes & all enemyes as the henne dooth her chekyns vnder her wynges and he that helde all the Barons and ye people in good loue. So they wente by wayln∣ge & wepynge and cursynge them that this false tay∣les had ymagyned. And Ponthus rode to saynt So∣lo. And there he dyd ordeyne a shyp. And on the mor∣nynge he herde masse and wente to the see. And her∣launt & his felowes wende for to haue gone with him all saue ganelet / but he wolde not suffre them / and he sayd yt the kynge had nourysshed them and yt he was of power to make them & doo them good & therfore he wolde that they sholde torne agayne vnto hym / with grete payne they myght beparte from hym so sorow∣full they were. Soo they toke theyr leue wepynge and whan the shyp was gone out of theyr syght than be∣gan theyr sorowe / all saue ganellet whiche made sem∣blaunt to wepe / but he hadde grete Ioye in his herte And whan Ponthus had lost the syght of Brytayne.
Than fell the teres frome his eyen and sayd. Blessyd be Brytayne and the fayrest / the good / the trewest ye lyueth / and the best / and all other ladyes and gentyl∣women for the loue of her / and al the knyghthode / for better nor sweter was there neuer. ¶How whan Ponthus was arryued at the porte of Hampton he founde a wylde bore and cutte hym in the myddes. POnthus had his herte heuy and sorowfull for his lady whiche dwelled there / and alwaye he refrayned his sorowe the beste that he myght. So he arryued and londed at Hampton / and came rydynge towarde London. Then he met a greyhounde in his
waye and a wylde bore whiche greyhoūde folowed & pynched the bore. Tho Ponthous drewe out his swer∣de and smote the bore in two peces. Harry the kynges sone of Englonde that sawe the stroke / was gretely ameruaylled / and enquyred hym of whens he was / & Ponthus sayd vnto hym. Syr for as moche as I ha∣ue herde grete renowme of the kynges hous of Eng∣londe & that he hath two sones whiche ben good kny∣ghtes I am come hether for to se the state and the no∣bles of his hous. Syr sayd Harry ye be welcome and I am one of the kynges sones / and praye you for too be with me. Syr in the name of god syth that it plea∣seth you. Soo they rode forth towarde the courte spe∣kynge of many thynge / whan they arryued ye kynge was set at dyner. Harry cōmaunded ye men sholde de¦lyuer chambre & stable to his newe knyght / & it was done. The kynges sone entred in to the halle & his ne∣we knyght with hym / and salewed humbly the kynge and ye quene. The kynge asked hym how he had hun∣ted / & he tolde hym / & than he asked hym pryuely who is yt goodly knyght / & he tolde hym how that he foūde hym / and of the grete stroke yt he had stryken the wel∣de bore. Moche was Ponthus loked vpon / for frome euery parte men came for to se hym as it hadde ben a myracle. Anone it was noysed in the courte that the∣re was come the goodlyest knyght of the worlde that the kynges sone hadde brought. The ladyes behelde hym and in especyall the kynges doughters. Eeuerye of theym sayd that he is ye goodlyest knyght that euer I sawe. Ye saye trouthe sayd another yf he be good yet is he more agreable and pleasaunt / he was set at dy∣ner with the ladyes. After mete the kynge wente out
of the hall and sawe the bore whiche was the grettest that he had sene of a grete whyle / and was in two pe∣ces. A sayd harry to the kynge & to the quene / se what my newe knyghte hathe done with one stroke of his swerde. Ponthus turned fro thens and was ashamed bycause that men praysed hym for that stroke. The kynge asked hym of whens he was / and he sayd vnto hym that he was of the realme of fraunce / and what is your name. Syr sayd he men calle me Surdyt de∣droit voyce So he asked hym of the tydynges of fraū∣ce / and many other tydynges / but the kynge founde hym so wysely answerynge that he was all ameruay¦led. And than he wente vnto the quene and to the lor∣des & knyghtes and sayd vnto theym that he had not of a grete whyle spoken with so wyse nor with so gen∣tylmanly a man as is that goodly knyght in talkyng And truely sayd the kynge myne herte sayth me yt he is gretter & more noble than he maketh hymselfe So he dwelled there a longe tyme and the more that men sawe hym the more they loued and praysed hym. ¶How Ponthus put the stone before ye ladyes at lon∣don at the request of syr Harry his mayster. SYr Iohan the kynges eldest sone had grete so∣rowe for that he had not founde hym afore his broder Harry / of all maner of dysportes he coude well entermete hym / as hawkynge & huntynge / & he wold neuer auaunt hymselfe of nothynge yt he dyd / his ma∣ner & his behauynge pleased well euery man / he loued well holy chyrche / & euery daye he wolde here masse & gyue his almes to ye poore people / his byggest oth was
in good fayth it was thus or it is thus. On an euenyn¦ge the erles sone of Gloucestre yt was a fayre knyght and a stronge / but he was somwhat proude / he cast ye stone with the kynges sones & many other / so he ouer caste syr Iohan well a foure fyngers / & auaūted hym selfe yt he had cast before them all. So syr Harry bad Surdyt yt he sholde put the stone / syr sayd Surdyt I can not / but syth yt it pleaseth you I shall do as I can So he wente to the stone and put it with the ferdeste A sayd syr Harry by the fayth yt ye owe to the woman of ye worlde that ye loue best put it as ferre as ye may whan he herde that he was soo coniured he bethought hym of his lady / & sayd syr ye haue coniured me ore / for I owe to grete fayth to my lady my moder A sayd Geneuer the kynges eldest doughter. Surdyt. Sur∣dyt / it may not be that ye be now vnpurchaced and be so moche & so goodly. Madame quod he I am so sym¦ple & so boustous that none wolde lyste for to loue me. God wote wele sayd Geneuer. And than she thought in her herte / ye wolde god he loued me as moche as I wolde loue hym. And than Surdit toke the stone and put it wel a .vii. large fore afore them all / & whan ye kȳ¦ge & the ladyes sawe ye cast they meruaylled / ye erles so ne was abasshed / & sayd I am ouercome. Than sayd syr Harry to Surdyt / why haue ye so longe taryed of this caste. A syr sayd he had it not ben yt ye cōiured me so sore I wolde not haue medled me / for I haue dys∣pleased hym & me forthynketh for it was but for to o∣beye your pleasure / & ye wote well yt it sytteth not me to be in no mannes dyspleasaūce. So his mayster ap∣perceyued well his gentylnesse. Geneuer came to her brother & sayd vnto hym. Fayre broder come play you
in my chambre and brynge youre newe knyght with you. Fayre syster I wyll well sayd he. So they wente to playe and to dysporte them in her chambre / & then came wyne and spyces / and after they began to daun¦ce and to synge / but with grete payne they coude ma∣ke Surdyt for to daunce / saynge that he coude not daunce but whan he hadde a whyle daunced / he daun∣ced best of all / and also with grete payne they myght make hym for to synge / and at the praynge of the kyn¦ges doughter / he sange a songe the best of all / he ma∣de hymselfe alwaye vnconnynge of euery thynge but at the last he dyd euer best. After that they had songe the kynges sone & his syster began to sharpe / & whan they had harped a whyle they prayed Surdyt for to harpe / but with grete payne they made hȳ for to har∣pe At the last he harped a newe laye passynge well. A sayd Geneuer Surdyt in good fayth I haue grete Io¦ye that ye can that laye / for we haue had grete desyre for to knowe it / for it is the laye that the good knyght Ponthus made for his lady as it hathe ben tolde vs and we suppose wel for whome he made it. Madame sayd he I wote not who made it. Soo he was some what ashamed and chaunged coloure whan he thou∣ght on her he made it for▪ So he taught it to Geneuer and to her syster whiche made it to be wryten. And so the two doughters came to the kynge and to the que∣ne and shewed theym. Truely sayd the kynge lerne it fayre doughters I praye you for it is ryght good and the knyght playeth it well. Of all dysportes and pla∣yes he coude ryght well / & on a tyme Geneuer reson∣ned hym & sayd. Surdyt se ye in this realme lady or gentylwoman where ye set your herte and your plea∣saunce
tell it me / & in good fayth I am she that with good herte wyll helpe you in worshyp. Madame sayd he I thanke you for alwaye haue I nede of your good ladyshyp and helpe / but as in that I loue them all as I ought to doo good ladyes. A Surdyt sayd she ben they all incomune / is there none that hathe auaunta∣ge one ouer another. Madame they ben all soo good yt there may no man to moche preyse them nor loue thē in worshyp / and as for me the loue of a poore knyght is but of lytell thynge. A sayd she he is not poore that hathe the beaute / the bounte / & the good condycyons and ye good behauynge that ye haue for in good fayth I knowe none so fayre nor so grete a lady in this coun¦tre / that she ne ought to holde herselfe ryght wel wor∣shypped for to be byloued of suche a knyght as I hope that ye be. Madame I am ryght fer frō suche one as ye saye / but it pleaseth you for to talke and dysporte you with so poore a knyght as I am. A sayd she ye by¦leue me not / in good fayth I saye but as I thynke / al waye the knyght toke her talkynge in myrthe and in bourde and gaue her no maner of comforte / in so mo∣che that she aspyed that he was not in wyll for to loue the whiche dyspleased her moche / for yf she had foūde in hym ony maner of comforte yt he wolde haue loued she wolde haue dyscouered herselfe more largely and so apperceyued her well Surdyt / often tymes many fayre ladyes & gentylwomen gaue him many wordes of loue & preue lokes yt they wolde haue loued hym yf he wolde haue loued them but he made all fayre chere wtoute gyuynge ony comforte of loue / wherfore there were many ryght sorowfull & in especyall the kynges doughters / ryght wysely demeaned hym selfe Sur∣dyt
and pleased all. Many nyghtes he thought on his lady and made layes of her the whiche fell all in com∣playnynge of sorowe & that he sholde alway serue her without chaūgynge & in these thoughtes he toke ofte tymes grete dyscomforte & somtyme allegyaunce of his heuy thoughtes. Tho it befell yt there was rygour of warre bytwene the kynge of Irlonde & the kynge of Englonde. Soo there was trewes taken that was broken at Myghelmas and was passed a thre dayes. And ye kynge of Irlonde came with grete armes. So the tydynges came to the courte. And the kȳge of En¦glonde sente letters ouer all & made his assemble and ordeyned his two sones for to goo. Surdyt asked his mayster. Syr what tytle hathe the kynge your fader for to warre. And Henry sayd that his fader hadde good tytle takynge it on his soule & on his peryll Syr sayd Surdit than shall I go with you for in no wron¦ge tytle of warre wyll I not arme me for no thynge for we owe better for to loue ye soules than the bodyes that ben mortelles whiche drawe euery daye to theyr ende and the soule may not dye for she must haue her rewarde of ye good dede and of the badde his mayster herde hym and praysed hym moche in his herte / but well he thought that he had good ryght. ¶How the Englysshemen and the Irysshe faught / & how Ponthus conquered & toke the kȳge of Irlonde and how he made afterwarde the peas of hym and of the kynge of Irlande.
THe armes were assembled & wente ayenst the kynge of Irlonde yt kepte the felde & had take a castell with a saute / whā he herde by his espyes that ye kynges two sones came to ye batayll he went ayenst them / for he was a good knyght and a manly. What sholde I saye you the kynge of Irlonde had seuen ba∣taylles & had many comyns / & our men had but foure bataylles / of the whiche the erle of hampton ledde the fyrst & he was marchal of englonde. The secōde ledde syr Henry. The thyrde syr Iohn̄ the kȳges two sones and in that was moost of barons. The fourth ledde ye kynge of cornewayle yt was a good knyght & neuewe to the kynge of Englonde and he hadde with hym the walshe men. The kynge of Irlonde had moost of his men on fote / but the Englysshe men were moost on horsbacke. At the assemblynge of the men of armes
there was grete noyse and grete crye / and there we∣re many knyghtes ouerthrowen that syth had no po∣wer to ryse / Soo the Erle had moche to suffe by thre bataylles that were agaynst hym. And whan Sur∣dyt that was in the seconde batayll sawe theyr felow∣shyp withdrawe he sayd to his mayster. Syr it is ty∣me to departe for your men lese grounde / ye saye well sayd syr Harry. Than they lete renne and smote in to the batayll & bette downe knyghtes & horses in theyr comynge / and than they drewe theyr bryght swerdes of stele & began the batayll fyers and cruell. Soo they droue abacke the Irysshemen with that the other ba∣tayll came to theym where as the kynge was and the best knyghtes / and there was grete noyse and sowne of trompettes and tabours and taryed but a whyle yt all the bataylles assembled togyder. There were ma∣ny fayre Ioustes but it were to longe to tell. Surdyt yt had grere wyll for to do dedes of armes / bete doune many with a tronchon of a spere. And than he set his hande to his swerde and began for to smyte on the ry∣ght syde and on the lefte syde that he made before hȳ a grete way / he made hymselfe be to byknowen of thē that neuer erst had sene hym and he dyde suche mer∣uaylles of armes that there were many that lefte the batayll for to beholde hym. Than sayd the kynge yf he lyue longe he shall make vs to lese the felde. Soo ye kynge smote hym a trauers that he reuersed him / and yet he fe not thoughe he was nyghe ouerthrowen / & whan he was dressed agayne he preysed hymselfe ly∣tell in his herte but yf he be auenged / for he knew well that it was the kynge of Irlonde for he had sene him do many grete dedes yt daye / so he sawe hym rychely
armed and arayed with peerles and precyous stones Then Surdyt auaunced hym and smote hym so gre∣te a stroke vpon the helme that he astonyed hym / and laye ouer the sadyll bowe / but he wolde not smyte hȳ agayne for ferde of sleynge. And he sayd in his herte that yf god wolde he sholde not slee so good a knyght. Than he toke hym by bothe sholders and drewe hym to hym & ledde hym forth as the wulfe dothe his pray The Irysshemen wende well for to haue rescowed hȳ but he smote soo grete strokes aboute hym that none durste come nyghe hym put smytynge as the brachet abayeth the wylde bore. And so he bare hym out of the batayll / and set hym in good kepynge and made hym for to fyaūce pryson / whan ye Irysshemen sawe theyr kynge was taken eche of theym loste hardynes / & be∣ganne to fle to the wodes and to the mountaynes the¦re were many taken and slayne and ouerthrowen in the chace. At the nyght euery man drewe to his bane & his standarde / they lodged them in the feldes in the sygne of vyctory. Syr Harry had grete Ioye that his knyght had taken the kynge of Irlonde. Euery man spake of the knyghthode of Surdyt all men sayd that he hadde all ouercome and was cause of the vyctorye vpon the morowe after they wente before the castel yt the kynge of Irlonde had goten and it was yelden a¦gayne and other townes & castelles. And whan wyn∣ter came on euery man came home in to his owne coū¦tre. Grete was the Ioye of the tydȳges that came to the kynges hous ye Surdyt had dyscomfyted ye Irys∣shemen and had take the kynge of Irlonde in myd∣des of all his men. Soo there was grete preyse of his knyghthode At his comynge home the kynge and the
quene wente ayenst hym and sayd welcome be ye / the beste knyght on lyue & floure of all knyghthode. Sur∣dyt was asshamed of the worshyp that they made hȳ and sayd to the kȳge & to the quene that they shamed hym / & yf he had wyst he wolde not haue come thyder of all that yere / for it behoueth you not to do me suche worshyppe / for I haue not deserued it / & me semeth yt ye bourde with me. A sayd ye kynge ryght dere frende in good fayth we wende we hadde done well / but syth that it dyspleaseth you we shall doo soo no more. And thus the kynge exscused hym. Men asked the kynge what he wolde do with the kynge of Irlonde. And he answerrd as Surdyt wolde for he wolde neyther put hym in warde nor in pryson but as Surdyt cōmaun∣ded. And he answered agayne as the kȳge were plea∣sed so sholde be done. And yf it pleaseth the kynge that he myght be at his fyrst comynge out of pryson and be brought in to the hall & men doo hym worshyp it were well done. The kȳge sayd that this coūseyll was good and true and so was it done. ¶How the kynge of Irlonde by the counseyll of Pon¦thus dyned in the hall with the kynge of Englonde. SYr Henry brought hȳ in to the hall. The kynge of Irlonde was a ryght goodly knyght / and of the age of .xxx. yere / & he was ryght rychely arayed as in purple / mantell furred with fables. Eeuery man behelde hym. The kynge of Englonde and the quene made hym grete chere for the worshyp of Surdyt & was set bytwene the kȳges doughters at mete. The kynge of Irlonde was ryght sadde and made symple chere. Surdyt came before hym & sayd vnto hȳ. Syr
be of good chere / for ye haue good pryson for to be set bytwene two so fayre ladyes. Truely sayd ye kȳge as longe as god gyueth me so good pryson I ought not to be dysmayed. After mete tho Surdyt began for to bourde with the kynges yongest doughter and sayd. Madame how lyke ye the kynge of Irlonde / and yf I thought he myght please you I wolde touche of ma∣ryage bytwene you and him all thoughe it sytteth me not to do it for poore men are seldome herde amonge grete lordes. A Surdyt quod she fayre swete syr are ye bethought theron. Ye madame yf I thought that it were to your good pleasure. God wote said she he shol¦de please me well yf it pleased my lorde my fader and my brethren / yf so be that I myght not haue another that is neyther kȳge nor duke / but he is ye best knyght of ye worlde. Madame it is harde to knowe ye best for
there be many good / so he thought well that she sayd it for hym / & so dyde she / so he wolde not supporte her and fell in to other maters. After that they wente to playe and sporte theym in the gardynes / some at the chesse / and some at the tables / and at other dysportes And at after souper they songe and daunced. And on the morowe after the kynge helde his grete counsayll and there was the kynge of scottes that had wedded his syster. And the kynge had wedded ye kynges syster of scottes. And there was the kynge of cornewayle & the prynces and ye barons for to wete what sholde be done with the kynge of Irlonde. So it was spoken of in dyuers maners that longe were to tell. Soo at the laste the kynge asked Surdyt and sayd. Surdyt saye ye youre auyse for it is reason youre wyll be herde / for by you we haue hym in subgeccyon. Fayne he wolde haue exscused hym & sayd. Syth it pleaseth you that I shall saye forgyue it me yf I speke rudely as a man symple and of lytell connynge / but it semeth me that the warre that is bytwene you is onely but selfe wyll fulnes of hertes of grete lordes / and it is not after the holy lawe nor the cōmaundement of god / for he sayth loue thy neyghboure as thy selfe. And also whan god was borne the aungell came to the shepeherdes and anoūced them the byrth of god / & than wente agayne vp in to the skye sayenge. Gloria in excelsis deo et in terra pax hominibus bone voluntatis. That is for to saye / yt glory be to god ye fader & peas to men of good wyll / & also whan god came in to ony place he sayd to his apostelles / peas be amonge you / & therfore yf god haue gyuen you grete realmes and lordshyppes / it is not that the ryche sholde warre vpon the poore for the
poore people of the countre ben dystroyed and exyled / and ye ought for to kepe them and nourysshe them in peas. So I shall tell you how that I thynke that go∣de peas sholde be amonge you / and that ye gyue hym your yongest doughter with the debate that is bytwe∣ne you / and what it pleaseth you ouer. All men sayde that blessyd be he that soo hathe thought and sayd for it is a ryght true counseyll / soo this counseyll was hol∣den Than sayd the kynge of Scottes fayre dere fren¦de syth that from you is come so good a counseyll and so pleasaunt to euery man as we may see / perfourme ye this dede and go speke with the kynge your pryso∣ner / & brynge vs worde what his wyll is / for we char∣ge you of all this mater. Surdyt sayd that he sholde go with good wyll syth that it pleaseth theym. So he wente and spake with the kynge of Irlonde / and tol∣de hym that god loueth theym yt loueth peas to theyr neyghbours / and how yt many men were lost by theyr hye courage & theyr couetyse. And than he asked hym yf it myght be that he wolde haue the kynges yongest doughter / and that his raunsom & the debate bytwe∣ne theym were forgyuen. A sayd ye kynge yf ye myght brynge it aboute I were moost beholden to you nexte god of all the worlde / and wyll ye that it be soo sayde Surdyt yf I may brynge it aboute / ye sayd the kȳge with all myn herte there is nothynge I desyre so mo∣che. Soo Surdyt departed and came to the counseyll where as they abode ye answere. And they asked hym how he had done / and he sayd that ye kynge of Irlon∣de thanked them moche / and that this mater pleased hym with all his herte. And how he had grete desyre for to haue her with the accorde bytwene theym. And
the kynge of Englonde made ye archebysshop of can∣torbery for to handfest theym / & a moneth after they were wedded & there was a grete feest / for the kynge of Irlonde came with an hondred knyghtes in a sute And he gaue vnto Surdyt foure stedes / & syxe cour∣sers & ten thousande besaūtes of golde / with grete foy¦son of clothes of of golde / of purple / and of sylke / & go∣de furres of veer and of sables / he was moche behol∣den vnto the kynge of Irlonde for the grete gyftes yt he gaue hym. And whan the kynge had wedded her he ledde her home in to his owne realme where as she was ryght well beloued and worsshypped. ¶How Corboran the thyrde sone of the Sowdan ar∣ryued in Englonde and how Ponthus occysed hym.
IT befell in the .vii. yere yt there came tydyn∣ges in to the courte yt the soudans sone whi∣che was named Corboran had robbed & pyl∣led many Yles & realmes / & had done moche harme to the crysten people & had may coun∣tres trybutary to hym / soo he londed in Englonde as his two bretheren dyd / one in Galyce / another in lytell Brytayne. So he was sore dred / for he came wel wt a .ix.C. shyppes what grete what small. And whan he was londed he defyed the kynge of Englonde. And badde that he sholde auoyde the realme or elles to for¦sake his fayth and yelde hym trybute. All the countree was aferde for the grete nombre that he had of men The kynge toke his counseyll and sente for his people Thenne he sente for his broder of Scotlonde / and his sone in lawe of Irlonde / and for his neuewe of Corne wayle / and also for the Erle of wayles / and for all the lordes of Englonde. And whan they were all assem∣bled togyder there was a grete armee. The kynge sen¦te forth his two sones and ye Surdyt well a foure my¦le from the hoost of the sarasynes for to ordeyne theyr bataylles wherof the kynge of Scottes was the chy∣fe ledder of all the hoost. The fyrst batayll ledde ye kyn¦ge of Irlonde. And the kynge of Cornewayle ledde ye seconde batayll. The erle of wales ledde ye thyrde Syr Iohan the kynges eldest sone ledde the fourth. Syr Harry ledde the fyfth batayll. And the Surdyt ledde the syxte batayll. So there were syxte grete bataylles And they were nombred moo than thyrty thousande men / besydes all the fote men / as arbalastres and ar∣chers. Whan that the kynge Corboran herde telle of theyr comynge he made mo than .xii. bataylles yt were
nombred moo than .xl. thousonde without fote men / Soo they were ryght fyers & proude as they that had neuer ben dyscomfyted in the space of .xii. yere yt they departed frome the Sowdan of babyloyne. Soo our men rode to them warde in good ordynaunce / & whā they sawe the hoost of the turkes and sarazyns ye helde so grete a countre they were gretely ameruaylled but they helde themselfe well assured for they were clene shryuen and houseled. Surdyt came before the batay∣les and comforted them & sayd fayre lordes / dysmay you not for the grete nombre that they be / for our qua¦rell is the quarell of Ihesu cryst that fedde fyue thou∣sande men with fyue barly loues and two fysshes. Al∣so he may gyue vs vyctorye one ayenst an hondred so be euery man of good herte & smyte surely vpō them for he that well assaylleth or defendeth vpon theym yt haue no fayth god helpeth hym / & go we hardely with out ony fere. And ye shall se them anone dyscomfyted The euery man toke good herte for the wordes of sur¦dyt. And they answered. Syth that it pleaseth to god that Surdyt was there they were not aferde for to be dyscomfyted. Than they smote the horses with the sporres and ran one ayenst another. And there was a grete sowne of trompettes and tabours / that a mā sholde not haue herde the thondrynge There was ma¦ny ouerthrowen that syth had no power for to ryse / & the batayll lasted tyll that all ye bataylles were assem∣bled on bothe partyes so that ther was grete noyse of speres and of swerdes. Surdyt made hymselfe away whersoeuer he wente & whome that he stroke he was deed eyther maymed. Feragyne one of the sarazyns had slayne syr Iohan ye kȳges eldest sone of Englon∣de
& that was grete harme. The bataylles were ryght cruell. And Corboran the hethen kynge dyde grete de∣des of armes and sawe syr Henry Surdytes mayster was rychely armed and dyde many grete dedes with his handes / he toke a spere grete & sparte / & came vp∣on a morell stede / & smote syr Henry in ye syde that he perced his harnays that it entred halfe a fote in to the body / and that was grete domage for he was a good knyght & a manly. Surdyt serched the prees & made all to flee before hym with grete strokes that he deled & as he passed he sawe his mayster fall to the grounde wt a spere in his syde. It is not for to aske yf he was ryght sory. And he began for to smyte on the ryght sy∣de and on the lefte & made hymself a grete waye with the helpe of the kȳge of Irlonde that alway abode by hym. And than he alyghted of his horse lyfted vp his mayster & asked hym how he fared. And he sayd well so yt he were auenged on hym yt soo hurte hym. What is he sayd Surdyt. It is Corboran the kynge of this hoost / ne doubte you not sayd Surdyt for I shall a∣uenge you or elles dye. Soo he dressed hym vp & lepte on horsbacke & bare hym oute of the prees. And than Surdyt gadered to hym an hondred good speres or more / & sawe the guffanon of kynge Corboran. And stroke to that parte & brake the prees so moche that he sawe where that Corboran dyde meruayllous dedes with his handes and he was rychely armed / & had a crowne of golde vpon his basynet. Surdyt sayd vnto hym. Ha fals cowarde that hast slayne my mayster yu shalt go no ferder. So he smote hym so grete a stroke that he was all astonyed / & laye vpon his sadell bowe And Surdyt smote agayne and smote the heed from
the body / and bare ye heed out of the batayll vnto his mayster. And whan syr Henry sawe the heed he sayd blessyd be god I shall now dye the more meryly. And gramercy sayd he to Surdyt. Syr sayd he thȳke not to dye for ye shall se the sarasynes anone dyscomfyted syth that they knowe the deth of theyr kynge. And he said sothe for as sone as they wyst it they put no more defence in them & were all abasshed and sorowed sore for to se themselfe without an heed. And Surdyt en∣tred in to the grete prees & began to do grete dedes of armes for to gyue boldenes to all his felawshyp. And he bete downe sarasynes & dyde suche dedes of armes that euery man knewe hym by the grete strokes that he gaue. Soo thry fledde before hym as shepe before the wolfe. Soo they began to dysseuer and fledde by the countre as wylde bestes. And the Englysshe men and Irysshe men and the scottes began the slaughter vpon them on euery syde / there were slayne so many that ye feldes lay all strawed of deed men / the archers and the fote men whan they sawe ony ouerthrowen they all to hewed theym. The sarasynes wyste neuer where to hyde theym nor to saue themselfe / many of theym fledde towarde the shyppes / but Surdyt and the Englysshe men helde them so shorte that they my∣ghte not escape but put theym in to the see that they drowned theym selfe. Grete was the mortalyte vpon them / & they called vpon mahowne / but he neuer dyd helpe them tyll all were slayne and drowned. ¶How Ponthus pylled the shyppes of the sowdan.
ANd Surdyt came to a bote and endtred in & coude speke well latyn and asked where was kynges shyp with all his tresoure / so one of the sara∣synes tolde hym. Come forth sayd Surdyt in to this bote & brynge me thyder or thou shalte dye / the other sayd that he sholde brynge hym well. So he toke ores & thre sarasynes & rowed to the grete shyppe & wente in / ye shyppe was passynge grete & well poynted. So there were some within that wende to haue defended them / but Surdyt layde haude on his swerde & slewe and drowned all that were therin. So there abode no more therin but hymselfe and the thre sarasynes that hadde brought hym thyder. Soo they sayd that they wolde be crystened syth that mahowne had lette theyr lorde to be slayne & all theyr felawes. And after that they were crystened / and Surdyt gaue theym moche
good. Than sayd one of ye sarasynes se these grete hut∣ches and these grete cofers they ben full of golde and syluer that our mayster had robbed and spoyled vpon crysten londes that were nyghe the see. Soo no man myght thynke the grete ryches that was within. Eue¦ryche other lordes toke of the shyppes for there were well nyne hondred / and the flode fayled theym There was so grete wȳnynge that euery man was ryche by that Iourney / Surdyt called of his men suche / as he trusted & betoke theym ye shyppe to kepe & cōmaūded theym that it sholde be broughte to London to one of his lodgynges that lay vpon the water for he thought to wage men of armes for to go in to his realme that the sarasynes kepte in seruage. And neuerthelesse he gaue many grete gyftes that euery man praysed hym of his largesse. That nyght passed & was vpon a tues∣daye / the wednesdaye they serched ye felde for to wete who was deed of the crysten people. Soo they founde the kynges two sones of Englonde & the erle of wales the baron of staunforde / the erle of Gloucestre / thre other barons / and .xii. knyghtes / & well a two .M. of crysten people. So some were borne in to theyr coun∣trees & the remenaūt buryed at an abbay. The kynge and the quene had grete Ioye of the vyctorye / and all they sayd with one voyce that the good knyght Sur∣dyt had dyscomfyted the felde / and yf he had not ben they had loste the felde / but his grete knyghthode sa∣ued them & dyscomfyted the felde and theyr enemyes. So he had all the pryce / but he was ryght sorowful of the dethe of the kynges two sones. The kynges and ye quene made grete Ioye to Surdyt / & so dyde all the ladyes / & they sayd vpon hym that by hym they were
quyte of theyr enemyes. Surdyt wept whan he sawe the kynge for pyte of his mayster & the kynge comfor∣ted hym & sayd that in more noble seruyce myght they not dye than in the seruyce of god for to kepe ye coun∣tree and our holy lawe ayenst the mysbyleuers. ¶How the kynge of Englonde & the kynge of scottes made a parlyament & wolde haue gyuen vnto Pon∣thus to his eldest doughter. THe kynge behaued hȳ ryght fayre all thoughe he were sorowfull in his herte. Than ye kȳge helde his grete counseyll. And there was his brother of scotlonde / & his neuewe of cornewayle & all the lor∣des. And the kynge sayd vnto theym / fayre lordes ye se ye grete meruayles that haue fallen in this realme & how I haue lost my two sones / & how I am aged
and the quene is not yonge. Soo we must be aduysed who shal holde the realme after me / and who shall go¦uerne it in myne age. The kynge of scottes stode vp & sayd I haue your syster to my wyfe. And I gaue my syster to your wyfe and so I holde me for your broder And therfore my counseyll is thus. Gyue your dough∣ter vnto Surdyt. And ye shall be dredde & doubted & your realme well gouerned. And all answered with one voyce he hath well sayd / & the kynge of Englonde accorded therto with all his herte. And the kynge of scottes was charged to speke vnto Surdyt. Soo he wente and sayd vnto hym. Surdyt ye ought well to thanke god of the vertues that he hath gyuen you / for euery man loueth you. The kynge and all his coūseyll haue chosen you to haue his eldest doughter and to be kynge after hym / & in his lyfe to gouerne his realme Syr sayd Surdyt I thanke the kynge and all his lor¦des of the grete worshyppe that they profre me / but they ben symply aduysed as me semeth / for it is not syttynge that soo grete a kynges doughter and heyre sholde take so poore a man as I am / and of so lowe a kynred. And yf god wyll the noble blode of Englonde shall not be abessed by me. What is that ye saye quod the kynge we be all one fader and of one moder. And more ouer there is so moche worshyp and worthynes in you that ye be worthy to haue a better. They spake moche of this mater / but they coude fynde noo waye that he wolde consente / so fayre he founde Surdytes excusacyons that it was meruayll to here. And whan he sawe that it sholde not be he wente agayne to ye kȳ∣ge and his counseyll / & tolde hym what he had foūde & how that Surdyt thanked ye kynge / & how that he
exscused hym. Truely sayd the kynge he is maryed or ensured / or elles he loueth suche one as he wyll not be vntrewe to. Truely sayd all the lordes we wene yt it so be. Who so euer was glad or sory the kȳges doughter was ryght sory what semblaūt yt euer she made / and sayd to herselfe. Alas what eyleth me yt god hath not gyuen me ye grace that I myght not haue hȳ. Truely I se well that he hath set his herte in some other place where as he wyl kepe kepe his trouth / or perauenture he is maryed / sore she cōplayned in her hert & sorowed for ouer al men of ye worlde she loued hym best. ¶Now here I leue of Surdyt & of the kynges hous of Englonde & tourne agayne to Sydoyne to the kȳ∣ge of Brytayne. THe terme dureth yet that Ponthus set to Sy¦doyne / but Sydoyne hathe many a streyght thought & heuynesse bothe daye & nyght / & wysely she demeaned herselfe that no man sholde aspye her heuy¦nes saue Elyos the whiche knewe all her counseyll & sayd vnto her. Alas by me is gone out of this realme the best and the goodlyest knyghte of all the worlde / & often tymes she sorowed and wysshed for hym / but Elyos comforted her in the best wyse that she myght. Now it befell that Guenellet had all his desyre for he was mayster of al the kȳges hous of Brytayne by his grete wyles & subtyll speche. Soo he put out Harlant the senesshall out of his offyce and made ye kynge his heuy lorde and hadde all the rule in his handes. Sy∣doyne was desyred of kynges and of dukes / but she wolde here speke of no maryage. Soo amonge all o∣ther the kynge of Bourgoyne herde speke of her of the
erle of moūtbelyart his cosyn that Sydoyne was the fayrest & the connyngest that was in ony countre. So the kynge was of her so amerous that he myght haue no rest / so he enquyred by whome the kȳge was ruled and gouerned. And they tolde hym by a knyght that hyght Guenelet. So he sente hym many presentes & grete gyftes / and made hym large promys so that he wolde labour that he myght haue Sydoyne. And soo for couetyse Guenelet letted not but laboured ye kyn∣ge & sayd vnto hym. Syr mary your doughter whyle ye be in good helth / & allye you with some good kynge & that shall be wysely done. Here is the kynge of bour∣goynge that desyreth her and he is ryght noble and a ryche kynge / & it were grete foly to refuse hym. And the kynge sente vnto Sydoyne & hymselfe sayd vnto her fayre doughter I am olde and aged & I haue no chylde but you / & ye be desyred of many kȳges & grete lordes / and I haue herde saye he that refuseth reason reason wyll refuse hym / & so it befalleth often wherof god gyue grace it do not so by you. Fayre doughter ye kynge of Bourgoyne desyreth you / and he is neuewe to the kynge of Fraunce / & he is ryght myghty and a ryche kynge. Soo me semeth he ought not to be refu∣sed / and as for me yf it lyke you I am accorded therto Syr sayd Sydoyne it is noo nede yet to be wedded. Truely sayd the kynge ye haue so longe forborne & I knowe noo cause why / but I shall neuer loue you but yf ye accorde you to this. She was sore abasshed and heuy that her fader helde her soo shorte she sayd vnto hym. Syr ye wote well there is no thynge ye wyll cō∣maunde me to do but I wyll doo it with a good wyll. My ryght dredefull lorde I tell you in counseyll that
there is a sykenes in me I dare not tell it / but with ye grace of god I shall be hole of it / but it wyll be fyrst so¦mer or aboute Pentecost / & at that tyme I shal fulfyl your wyll. Truely sayd the kynge it suffyseth me / & I forgyue you tyll ye terme / & that was the seuenth yere that Ponthus set terme that he departed frome Sy∣doyne. The kynge was well pleased with his dough∣ter & tolde vnto Guenelet of ye terme that she had set hym. Guenelet sayd that it was well done / & he sente vnto the kynge of Bourgoyne that the maryage was graunted to be on tuesdaye in Pentecoste. Sydoyne was in grete dysease / & sente dyuers tymes to wete yf she myght haue ony tydȳges of Ponthus & she coude none here bycause he had chaunged his name / and so was she in grete sorowe bothe daye & nyght / whan he tyme drewe nyghe she was sore dysmayed / and sente after Harlant and sayd vnto him. A Harlant my dere frende I haue grete sorowe that my lorde is so affon∣ned on Guenelet whiche maketh hym for to do many straunge thynges / one is to put you out of your offyce and also by his fals wyles he wyll put awaye the beste knyght that at this daye bereth armes as men saye yt was Ponthus that ye taught & nourysshed thre yere the whiche loued you so well / & he maketh my lorde to do many shamefull thynges by his fals flaterynge / & in lyke wyse he maketh me to be gyuen to the kynge of Bourgoyne ayenst my wyll / for men saye yt he hath many euyll condycyons / & also he is aged & corsyous and lame and dronklew / but I may not do ayenst my lordes cōmaundement / so the terme draweth nygh of Pentecost. And I wote well yf Ponthus wyfte it he wolde set remedy therto / so I praye you that by your
counseyll remedy may be had / for there is no man in the worlde that I wolde discouer me to saue onely vn¦to you. ¶How Sydoyne sente Olyuer sone to Harlant in to Englonde for to fynde Ponthus. MAdame sayd Harlant / neuer god wyll that ye shall haue an housbonde of suche condycyons. But I shall tell you what we shall do. Olyuer my so∣ne is one of the knyghtes as ferre forth as I knowe yt Ponthus loueth best / he shall go in to Englonde & en∣quere of hym / & in to scotlonde & Irlonde whyther he be a lyue or deed / so he shall knowe the trouth. A sayd she in good fayth ye saye well. So Harlant spake vn∣to his sone whiche wente wt good wyll & charged hym
of all ye mater bytwene Ponthus & Sydoyne & toke hym money ynoughe for his exspences. Soo Olyuer passed the see & londed at hampton where he requyred of Ponthus. And he founde well that seuen yere afore there was passed in to the courte ye goodlyest knyght & the best that euer men myght se / but he named hym self Surdyt de driot voyce. Olyuer supposed yt it was he & that he had chaunged his name for certayne cau∣ses / soo he rode forth he & his man / & came thrughe the forest where he founde theues / & bycause he coude not well speke the langage of the countre / & bycause they sawe hym well arayed & rychely / they ranne vpon hȳ and toke hym & dyspoyled hym / & toke from hym all that euer he had / and hurte hym foule / but he escaped from them in the forest and saued hymselfe / so he had grete honger & thurste & grete colde. So he sorowed sore / for he myght fynde no comforte of his dysease / & the lettynge of his enquest greued hym wors than all his losse. He passed the forest and wente beggynge his mete fro dore to dore tyll he came to the kynges hous and it was the same daye that the kynge of scotlonde had spoken vnto Ponthus of the maryage of his nece Genneuer. ¶How Olyuer founde Ponthus in the courte of ye kynge of Englonde. POnthus was in the courte where as he behel∣de Iustes & dysportes of yonge knyghtes & dy¦uers maners. Olyuer was all naked & dyspoyled & lo¦ked aboute hym & sawe Ponthus & knewe hym well. So he came & kneled downe afore hym & sayd to hym My lorde Ponthus god gyue you good lyfe & increase you in the worshyppe that ye be in. Ponthus was all
abasshed & sayd vnto hym. Frende to whome speke ye Syr I speke to you that I knowe well / for ye be pon¦thus the kynges sone of Galyce / ye haue forgoten the countre of Brytayne & thoughe I be poore & naked it is befall me in sekynge of you. And ye ought to knowe me for I am Olyuer the sone of Harlant. And whan Ponthus herde hym he loked vpon hym & knewe hȳ well. And than he toke of his mantell & caste it aboute syr Olyuer / & toke hym by the hande & kyssed hym we¦pynge & myght no worde saye vnto hym. Thā he toke hym by the hande & ledde hym in to his chambre / and it was a grete whyle or he myghte speke. And whan that he myght speke he sayd vnto hym. A dere brother and frende how doo they in your countre / & how be ye thus arayed / & tolde hym all the mater frome the be∣gynnynge to the ende. Ponthus cladde hym with the best clothes that he had / and whan he was arayed he
a ryght goodly knyght. Than he tolde vnto Ponthus how he was robbed & in poynte to be deed / and how yt he came beggȳge his brede fro dore to dore / & after he tolde hym how Guenelet had all the rule of Brytayne and how the kynge byleued in no man but in hym / & how that he had put out his fader of his offyce of the seneshall shyppe of brytayne. And after he tolde hym of Sydoyne how that she sholde neuer consent to no maryagesyth that he departed / & of the grete dysease that she hath suffred / and how that she may no lenger abyde than tuesdaye in Pentecost that than she shall be maryed vnto the kynge of Bourgoyne ye whiche is full of euyll tatches / but Guenelet made the maryage that had grete gyftes of ye sayd kynge. So Sydoyne sendeth you worde by me that ye wyll sette remedy in this mater vpon all the loues yt is bytwene you & her. And whan he herde of the grete trouth of his lady the teres fell frome his eyen / & he sayd yf god wyll he shol∣de set remedy / so they spake of dyuers thynges. ¶How the kynge of Englonde knewe Ponthus & of what lygnage he was & exscused hym that he had not more honoured and worshypped hym. THe tydynges wente in to the courte that there was come a man of lytell Brytayne yt knewe well Ponthus the whiche named hymselfe Surdyte whan the kynge and all his housholde wyste of it they were sore ameruaylled. And the kynge and the quene sayd to the kynge of scottes / it was neuer but that my herte sayd & thought that he shold be of greteter byrth than he made hymselfe by the noble dedes of hym. A sayd ye quene I meruayll me no more though he wyll not haue our doughter / for I haue herde saye that he
loueth our cosyn Sydoyne of Brytayne without ony shame. Truely sayd the kynge it may well be whā he wyll not be maryed in this coūtre. So at souper tyme Ponthus came in to the hall & his knyght with hym the whiche was rychely arayed as in clothes of sylke furred with sables / so he was a ryght goodly knyghte to se. The kynge of Englonde and the kȳge of scottes came ayenst Ponthus & sayd vnto hym. A Ponthus why haue ye made vs to do ourselfe suche dysworshyp as ye haue done / for ye sayd that ye were but a poore knyghtes sone / so therby they were disceyued / & we ha¦ue gretely offended for bycause we haue not done you worshyp as we ought for to haue done / but all the bla∣me is in you / for in good fayth we dyde but as we kne¦we whan Ponthus sawe the grete courtesye of ye kyn¦ge & how he dysblamed hym selfe he sayd vnto hym. All thoughe I be a kynges sone it is but a lytell thȳge for a man dysheryted is but lytell praysed / so it is a ly∣tell thynge of poore noble his dedes ben ryght symple and therfore men ought to sette lytell by hym. A sayd the kynge saue your grace / he that hath the noblesse / the bounte with the good condycyons and worthynes that is in you / it is worth a kynges raunsom / for ye be lykly to conquere your owne and dyuers other. Pon∣thus was asshamed of the grete prees and chaunged his wordes in to other maters. The kynge made hym to syt at souper bytwene the quene and his doughter whyther he wolde or not but it was with grete payne After souper they wente to dysporte them in the gar∣dyn at dyuers dysportes. Ponthus came to the kynge of Scottes / and the kynge of Irlonde / and the kynge of cornewayle / and some of the grete lordes and they
set theym downe in an erber / and than he sayd to the kynge. Ryght hyghe and myghty prynce and to you al my lordes and frendes I wolde made a request vnto you all my lordes & frendes. I wolde make a request vnto you of a nedefull mater of myne. Than he tolde them how ye sowdan had sente his thre yongest sones for to conquere vpon crysten realmes / and how he de¦lyuered them grete army / and nauy and tresoure and how that he sayd vnto them / he that shall moost con∣quere and be moost worthy of knyghthode / he sholde be best welcome to hym. And how one of them londed in Galyce / and by wyle and treason they gate the tow¦ne of Columpne in Galyce / and of the grete sorowe & myschefe that he dyde / and how they slewe the kynge his fader. And than he tolde theym how that an olde preest hydde them two dayes and two nyghtes in an olde caue in a roche / and of ye grete fere that they had and as the wolfe gooth out of the wode for honger ry∣ghte so I and my thyrtene felowes of grete lordes so∣nes wente out of the caue and how they were taken / and also how the knyght saued theym / and how they landed in lytell Brytayne / and how theyr shyppe bra∣ke vpon a roche / and how they were saued. And as he tolde his tale many of the lordes the teres fell frome theyr eyen for to here the peryll and the shrowe that he escaped from. ¶How Ponthus departed out of Englonde with a grete company of people.
ANd after whā he had all tolde his tale he said vnto theym that he wolde goo for to conquere the myssebyleuers that helde his londe that was his faders / for I thanke god sayd he I haue ben in the fe∣lawshyp of them where as the pryde of two of theym hathe ben dystroyed / soo is there no more on lyue but the thyrde that holdeth the realme yt was my faders and that I oughte for to haue / and I vnderstande yt the countre is well gouerned & wysely / & fewe people of the countre slayne / for they lyue in seruage & paye trybute euery pece a besaunte of golde / & for the grete tresoure that the kynge reyseth he suffreth euery man to lyue in what byleue that euer he wyll. Syr sayd the kynge of Englonde I offre you my body with good herte all thoughe I be olde and aged / & after my men and my tresoure. Syr sayd Ponthus I thanke you hyghly. The kynge of scottes & the kynge of Irlonde
and the other kynges & the lordes all they offred hym body men and goodes / soo there was none but yt they offred themselfe to hym. Ponthus thanked the kynge and all the lordes ryght humbly and wysely / and sayd vnto the kynge and to the other kynges and lordes y• that god of his grace yelde theym the worshyppe that they offred hym. My lordes sayd he to the kynges I shall neyther lede kynges nor other grete lordes / but men of armes sowdours a twelue thousande the whi¦che that I wyll wage / & I thāke god I haue ynough wherof / and he sayd trouth / for at the laste batayll he founde ynoughe in kynge Corborans shyppe ryghte grete tresoure so moche that it was meruayll to here & with grete payne it myght be nombred. They offred hym ynoughe of golde & haueour / but he wolde none take of them / but toke of euery kynge of the best men that they had so many that he had well a twelue thou∣sande men well arayed in good shyppes. Soo he wa∣ged theym at theyr owne wyll / & they had grete Ioye for to go with hym / he ledde with hym ye erle of Glou¦cestre / the erle of Rychemonde / and the erle of Derby chyeftaynes and captaynes of the englysshe men. Of scottes the Erle of Douglas / and of euery countree a lorde to gouerne the men of theyr countre whan they were in the shyppes wel arayed and garnysshed of al thynge that theym neded / and had taken theyr leue of the lordes and of theyr frendes / they drewe vp sayles & had wynde at wyll & departed with grete Ioye out of the hauen of hampton. And Ponthus toke his leue of the kenge & the quene & of Genneuer her doughter So there was ynoughe of sorowe & wepynge / & they made Ponthus to promys them to come agayne & se
them as soone as he myght come vnto an ende of his warre. And he thanked theym hyghly of the grete ho∣nour that they had made hym. The kynge of scottes and the kynge of Irlonde / & the kynge of cornewayle they conueyed Ponthus whyther he wolde or not to ye shyppes / and there he toke his leue of them with gre∣te heuynes / and the kynge of Irlonde sayd vnto hym Now I se well that ye loue me not ye that haue done so moche for me that neytheyr I nor my realme may neuer deserue it to you / & ye wyll not suffre me to go with you to bere you felawshyp. Syr sayd Ponthus I thanke you I refuse not your good helpe after that I fynde in my countre yf nede be / but I shall neyther lede you nor none of myne lordes tyll that I knowe more how that the countre standeth for certayne cau∣ses Soo they toke theyr leue that one of that other / & thus departed Ponthus from the realme of englonde with his army. And his goynge was sore complayned of the men of the londe. So he sayled daye and nyght that he londed by Uennes / he ordeyned his nauy to a∣byde in the hyghe see / and sayd that he wolde not that they sholde come to londe nor shewe past a forty shyp∣pes / and that they sholde make them marchaūtes to come for salte to ye bay. So he ordeyned well his nauy & all his nede / & toke with hym certayne vessell where as he wolde londe and well a thre hondred fyghtynge men / & londed by nyght bytwene Auroy▪ & vennes / & there he ordeyned that they sholde not goo thens tyll they herde tydynges of hym / & that they sholde come to hym lyke as he sholde sende theym worde / and this was on the mondaye of Pentecost / and the weddyn∣ge sholde be on the tuesdaye of ye kynge of bourgoyne
and Sydoyne. Than he lepte on horsbacke he and a man with hym on the tuesdaye in the mornynge bety∣mes. And as he rode he met with a poore palmer beg¦gynge his brede the whiche had his gowne all to clou∣ted / and an olde pylled hatte / so he alyght and sayd to the palmer / frende we shall make a chaunge of all our garmentes / for ye shall haue my gowne and I shall haue yours and youre hatte. A syr sayd the palmer ye bourde you with me. In good fayth sayd Ponthus I do not / so he dyspoyled hym and cladde hym with all his rayment / & he put vpon hȳ ye poore mannes gow∣ne / his gyrdell / his hosyn / his shone / his hatte / and his bourden. And than his man sayd vnto hym / syr what do ye be ye out of your wytte that haue gyuen your clo¦thes for suche an habyte. Holde thy peas sayd ponthus thou wotest not why that I do it / kepe the pryuely & thy two horses here at ye townes ende & go not awaye tyll that I come agayne to the. ¶How Ponthus departed from his dwarfe & wente to Uennes lyke a pylgrym & how he founde Guenelet and the kynge of Bourgoyne. SO he wente forth with his bourden & came in to the waye where as the kynge of bourgoyne sholde passe. And anone after he sawe comynge his so∣mers and his offycers / & than after he sawe the kynge come rydynge on a palfray comynge togyder he and Guenelet the traytour / & the kȳge helde his hande on Guenelettes sholdre / as they passed Ponthus sayd Se here two well nourysshed felawes for bothe they haue grete belyes. A saynt Mary sayd he to Guenelet your bely hathe receyued many a fatte morsell of the courte / ye are full well shapen for to be a veray grete
flaterer of the courte. Guenelet wexed reed & was an angred & tourned his hors and sayd vnto hym what fals trewande must thou myssay me / so he wolde ha∣ue stryken hym with his warderer & Ponthus lyft vp his bourden and came to hymwarde and sayd that he wolde make his berde yf he touched hym / & the kynge sayd to Guenelet / lete the trewande go / for men shol∣de haue no worshyp for to touche hym. So they wen∣te forth. And Ponthus that loued theym not made as he had ben a fole & mocked them & folowed after & ca∣me to ye courte / & as he sawe yt men went in he threste in amonge the prees / & the porters wende for to haue put hym out & toke hym by bothe sholders for to haue put hym abacke but Ponthus threwe hym vnderfote and passed forthe & sayd that he was one of the poore men that sholde ete before the bryde in ye worshyp of god and of his apostles. ¶How Sydoyne knewe the pylgrym Ponthus by a rynge that she had gyuen hym or he went for to dwell in Englonde. AT the solempne feest of this maryage of the kynge of bourgoyne and of Sydoyne at after mete the bryde sholde gyue them drȳke her owne han¦des suche was the custome there. So Ponthus went and set hym downe as for one of ye poore men / grete was the weddynge and grete was the feest. Ponthus ete but lytell but loked vpon his lady the whiche was ryght symple & all for wepte / for Guenelet had affer∣med ouer all yt Ponthus was in Irlonde & she wende veryly that it had be soo. After mete whan the tables were take vp they ledde the bryde vnto her chambre
for to chaunge her aray / and her attyre for to go vnto the scaffolde for to se the Iustes. And as they went to her chambre there was a tresaunce where as the .xiii. poore men were. And there were two gentylwomen that one had a grete potte of syluer full of wyne / that other helde a cuppe of golde. Sydoyne toke the cuppe and gaue euery man drynke. And Ponthus was the laste and he toke the cuppe and dranke and lette fall in the cuppe a rynge of golde with a dyamounde the whiche that she hadde gyuen hym as ye haue herde be¦fore / whan he had dronken he sayd vnto her pryuely. Madame drynke the lytell remenaunt for the loue of Ponthus. And whan she herde the name of Ponthus her herte lepte in her breste and soo she dranke the re∣menaūt / and as she dranke she apperceyued & knewe the rynge so she was all entred in to Ioye and wyste
neuer what to thynke. Than she called Elyos her gen¦tylwoman and badde her in counseyll that she sholde brynge the moche poore man in to her warderobe / & the other poore people wende that she wolde haue gy¦uen hym some thynge or some grete gyfte for the loue of god / for they knewe her for a good woman & ryght charytable. and whan she was in her warderobe there was none but she Elyos & the poore man. Than Sy∣doyne spake fyrst and sayd vnto hym. Swete frende and loue who toke you the rynge that I founde in the cuppe. I praye you tell me and hyde it not from me. Wote ye not quod he to whome ye toke it to / yes sayd she is he deed or a lyue tell me. Truely sayd he he is on lyue. She Ioyned her handes togyder & thanked god and sayd lorde I thanke the of thy grace. O madame wende ye that he were deed / ye truly said she for Gue∣nelet had soo affermed it ouer all. Madame sayd he yf ye sawe hym what wolde ye saye / what sholde I saye sayd she / neuer erst befell me so grete Ioy as I sholde haue. Whan he herde all this he fordyde no more his speche / & toke a cloth and rubbed his vysage / & anone she knewe hym. A sayd she ye be Ponthus the thynge in the worlde that I moost loue nexte god & my fader and ye be ryght welcome. Than she had grete Ioy & halfed hym. A madame sayd he I haue grete Ioye yt ye be so well and rychely maryed / and he sayd it for to assay her. A my swete loue sayd she speke neuer therof for I shall neuer haue other than you yf it please you for to haue me / for I swere to you bothe with mouthe and wt herte / and so y• latter dede standeth for nought for the fyrste othe must be holden. A madame thynke neuer for to take a poore man beggynge his brede and
to leue a ryche kynge and a myghty. I wolde neuer coūseyll you so for to acquyte your trouth. Ryght de∣re knyght and loue sayd she I shall neuer haue other but you / for I sholde be a thousande tymes more at hertes ease to suffre in youre felawshyp the pouerte & dysease that ye suffre than all the rychesse with ye my∣ghtyest kynge that is. And yf ye haue ony pouerte or trybulacyon god hathe sente you for to assaye you the whiche after wyl sende you of rychesse more than euer ye had so that ye haue good truste in hym. Whan Pon¦thus herde of the grete trouthe of Sydoyne and sted∣fastnes of her / the teres fell from his eyen & after smy¦led & sayd. Madame neuer truer nor better lady was there neuer than ye be. I shall hyde no thynge fro you wete it for trouth that I haue more golde & syluer and precyous stones & Iewelles seuen tymes than hathe my lorde your fader / and also I haue .xii. thousande men of armes waged for halfe a yere to conquere the realme that was my faders / so dysmay you for no thȳ¦ge / but I shall tell you what ye shall doo / make Poly¦des my cosyn germayne for to lede you and that he ke¦pe him with you and all my felowes suche as loue me and I shall come se you in suche araye. Soo he tolde her how he sholde be arayed and ordeyned and I may no lenger abyde with you. And toke his leue and folde her in his armes & halsed her / and yet durste not kysse nor desyre for to kysse her. ¶How Ponthus came to the Iustes and Iusted at auenture with the kynge of Burgoyne and ouerthre∣we hym so that he dyed.
SO he wente his waye haltynge as he had ben a lame begger / & came to his man that abode him & lepte vpon horsbacke & came to the wode where as he had lefte his felawshyp / & whan they sawe hym in suche plyght they knewe hym not / and some there were that wolde haue taken hym for a spye / but he be¦gan to laughe & sayd I am Ponthus quod he to them and than euery man knewe hym / so there was game ynoughe. Syr sayd the erle of Gloucestre almoost we had doo you shame / how be ye thus dysguysed. Fayre lordes quod he I dyde it for a cause I wolde not ben knowen. Than ordeyned he yt euery man sholde arme them for to come to ye Iustes / & that they sholde come by ·xx. by .xxx. to the scaffolde & that none sholde Iuste but by his cōmaundement / & he tolde them of the ma¦ryage
and of the grete feest that was there. So Pon∣thus arayed hym and fourty knyghtes all in a sute of the best & of the notablest of all his felawshyp. And he tolde theym all his mater that he had to doo. So they came to Iuste in the ranges / & the brytons & the bour∣goygnyons were sore ameruaylled what they were yt were so nobly arayed / & that so well Iusted. And Sy¦doyne was come before to the scaffoldes with ladyes and gentylwomen / & Polydes ladde her by the brydel and therfore was Guenelet ryght wrothe that Poly∣des had taken it from hym / saynge vnto him that she had so cōmaunded hym. And she had tolde hym afore that he sholde se Ponthus his cosyn germayne / wher∣fore Polydes had so grete Ioye that no herte myght thynke it / and than she tolde it to all his felowes saue onely Guenelet / wherfore they were all as Ioyous as they myght be / & it is not to for aske yf Sydoyne had all worldly Ioye in her herte. So she sawe Ponthus comynge the whiche was more semelyer than ony o∣ther knyght & more goodlyer / & he Iusted from ranke to ranke / & bette downe knyghtes & horses and brake speres & dyde meruayles in armes. Sydoyne bowed downe to Polydes & tolde hym. Se ye yonder knyght armed in purple and asure with a whyte lady that hol¦deth a lyon enchayned / & ouer the lyon ben letters of golde that sayth. God helpe the fourty felawes. And they ben all in sute of hym saue onely they haue no let∣ters of golde / truely he with ye letters of golde is Pon¦thus your cosyn germayne and all the other ben of his felawshyp. So Polydes helde hȳ with Sydoyne lyke as she had cōmaūded hym. The kynge of bourgoyne came in to the felde vpon a grete Iennet of spayne / &
he was rychely armed / & with hym forty knyghtes in a sute & euery man his spere in his hande / so they begā to renne & Iuste. And whan Ponthus sawe them he dressed hym towarde them and began to ouerthrowe bothe hors & man / soo that euery man was abasshed for to mete with hym. The kynge of Brytayne yt was on the scaffoldes with the ladyes & the olde knyghtes asked who was that goodly knyght that had the lady in his shelde & holdeth a lyon enchayned with letters of golde and hath so many knyghtes in a sute / euery body sayd that they wyste neuer / saue that he hytteth none but that he ouerthroweth. So he ouerthrowe & beteth doune knyghtes and horses / and what dedes of armes that he doth / he is a stronge aduersary▪ Truly the lady of Dueyl whiche was ryght wyse & a fayre la¦dy I sawe neuer no knyght erst yt coude soo well ryde an hors nor none yt resembled so moche Ponthus / on whose soule god haue mercy. Than sayd the kynge to Sydoyne / fayre doughter I wolde not that he sholde mete with your husbonde / for I am aferde yt he shol∣de hurte hym / for his strokes ben ouer harde. My lor∣de sayd she yf he be wyse he shall kepe hym fro hȳ / for yonder knyght is to harde. They had moche talkynge of Ponthus & of his knyghthode / but all they were in grete thought for to wete what he was. It taryed not longe after yt Ponthus of auenture encountred with the kynge of bourgoyne so he sawe hym ryght nobly & rychely arayed & armed & he thought well that it was the kynge or some grete lorde of Bourgoyne / than he smote his horse with his spores and hytte hym in the myddes of ye shelde / & his spere was grete & stronge
so he toke hym as he whiche had ynoughe of strength and hardynes / and in especyall to do dedes of armes before his lady that of soo longe tyme he had not sene her / so the stroke was so grete that he bare the kynge ouer the croper of his hors / that he loste the brydell of golde / and that other was yonge and stronge & bare hym backwarde & fell in to a grete pytte full of stones and Ponthus wende for to haue lepte ouer / but they fell all in so sore the kynge vndernethe all that he was deed and his hors deed. The Bourgoynyons were all heuy and sory for theyr lorde / and euery man cryed ye newe wedded kynge is deed. Ponthus herde it yt whi∣che recked but lytell of it and no more dyde Sydoyne Ponthus alyghted of his hors / and all his felowes & wente vp vnto the scaffoldes and dyde of his helme / and anone euery body knewe hym / he came to Sy∣doyne and toke her by the hande and sayd. Madame ye must be my prysoner / saue ye shall haue good pry∣son. She wexed reed and had grete Ioye in her herte an answered agayne yf I owe to be your prysoner I muste nedes suffre it. The kynge was gone downe of the scaffoldes / the whiche was ryght sory for the deth of the kynge of bourgoyne / but whan it was tolde hȳ that it was Ponthus that had done al the meruayles and yt he had takē his doughter he was ryght Ioyfull & sayd ye god hathe ordeyned yt he shall haue her / & we may gyue her to no better knyght / for truly there is in hym so moche worthynes yt he is able to haue ye kȳges doughter of fraūce / but truly I wende he had be deed as men dyd me to vnderstande. Than he came ayenst Ponthus / & Ponthus sayd yt good lyfe gyue hym god as to his lorde / there was grete Ioye bytwene them.
It is not to aske yf the lordes & the ladyes made hym grete Ioye. And his cosyn germayne and his felawes made hym grete Ioye / saue Guenelet whiche made Ioye with mouth but not with herte. The cyte and al the people thanked hyghly god / & sayd that god had vysyted them / for we shall now haue a kynge whiche shall kepe vs from all harmes & dyseases. Grete was the Ioye of this auenture. Ponthus helde with hym the erle of Gloucestre / & the erle of Wynchestre / & the erle of Rychemoūde / & dyuers other barons & knygh∣tes of Englonde / and all the remenaunt he sent to the shyppes. The kynge made grete Ioye to these lordes and soo dyde Sydoyne / and in especyall to the erle of Gloucestre the whiche was ryght a good knyght / & he asked hym of the welfare of the kynge of Englonde whiche was his cosyn. The erle tolde hym of the auen¦tures that was befall to the kynge & to the realme / & how by the worthynes of Ponthus they had the ouer hande of the kynge of Irlonde / and how that he toke hym in the myddes of all his men & ledde hym awaye whether he wolde or not / & all the maner / & also how that he wolde not put hym to no raunsom / but made a {pro}eas bytwene bothe kynges. And also the erle tolde hym how the soudans sone londed with grete nombre of people / & how they were by Ponthus dyscomfyted & slayne / & how Ponthus wanne the grete tresoures of the sayd hethen kynge that be so grete that it is mer¦uayll for to here / for he had not cessed to robbe & pyll vpon crysten londes well the space of .xii. yere. After he tolde hȳ how yt he named hȳselfe Surdyt de driot voyce / and made himselfe but a poore knyghtes sone. Whan the kynge herde that he had so named hȳselfe
he auysed hym & sayd that he dyde it bycause that he had aledged mater ayenst him / and the name was by cause that he sholde haue his doughter / and the cause that he named hȳ de droit voyce / bycause he wolde ha¦ue foughten with two or thre / and many studyed vp∣on these names. After the erle tolde the kynge how the kȳge of Englonde & all his coūseyll had offered Pon∣thus to haue Genneuer his eldest doughter / & to be kȳ¦ge after ye decesse of her fader / & in his lyfe to be gouer¦noure of Englonde / & how he exscused hȳ & wolde not be it. And also he tolde hȳ yt by a naked knyght he was knowen yt he was the sone of Harlant / & how the kyn¦ge & all the lordes helde themselfe asshamed for yt they had done him no more worshyp than they dyde bycau¦se he was a kynges sone. The kynge of Brytayne had grete Ioye to here tell of the grete worshyp of Pon∣thus / & yet well more had Sydoyne / & the lordes yt we¦re there / for it was ryght a noble & a good tale to here After yt the erle had tolde his tale the lordes of Bry∣tayne called the kynge asyde & sayd to hȳ. Syr what thynge wyll ye do / do speke vnto Ponthus in haast yt he take your doughter / & than shall ye & all your real∣me be well kepte / for we be in doubte yt he wyll not ta¦ke her bycause of ye kynges doughter of Englonde / for yt is moche better maryage than this / & also he hath so grete tresoures & ryches yt setteth but lytel by ony daū¦ger. Fayre lordes sayd the kynge I praye you that ye wyl thynke theron / for I desyre it moost of ony thȳke in the worlde / for neuer erst befell vs so good an auen¦ture. Than wente the lordes & comyned togyder and gaue the voyce to speke to the vycoūt of lyon for to spe¦ke to Ponthus. Syr they spake to hym ryght goodly
how that he was fyrst saued in ye coūtre of bryatayne and how that the kynge loued hym / and how that by enuy & false lesynges the kynge & he were at debate / & how that the kynge was aged / & how that he was to lyght of byleue / & there is no man wtout some tatche. And therfore ye kynge for the loue that he hath to you & for the welth & profyte of the countre / he offreth you his doughter & to be kynge after hym. And Ponthus yt desyred none other thȳge answered. Than he than∣ked the kȳge hyghly & his lordes / and that he was the fyrst lorde that euer dyde hym good or worshyp / & he woteth well he coude neuer deserue it vnto hym / and yf he were of the vylue and worthynes to haue the gre¦test lady of the worlde / he wolde not take her to refuse the kynge & his doughter his barons & the countre of moche he is beholde to them yt he loueth them ouer all other. The barons had grete Ioy of the answere and they wente & tolde ye kynge to whome it pleased well.
¶How Ponthus was fyaunced vnto the fayre Sy∣doyne doughter of the kynge of Brytayne. THey sent for ye bysshop for to fyaūce them And on the mondaye seuen nyght after Pentecost was set ye day of maryage. Sydoyne had grete Ioye & Ponthus also. It is not to aske yf they had an .C. ty¦mes greter Ioye than they shewed Grete was ye Ioy in brytayne of the maryage bothe of ryche & of poore. Ponthus whiche was ryght wyse and wolde haue no maugre of no body / he came to Guy of bourgoyne the kynges brother / & to Aymberte de chaloys & to ye erle of mountbelyart yt whiche were come wt the kynge of bourgoyne / & excused hȳ to them / & sayd vnto them yt he was ryght sory of this auenture of ye kȳges deth & that in good fayth whan he Iusted wt hȳ he wyste not what he was And they answered sayd yt they byleued hȳ well / for it was but auenture of armes / & therfore he ought not to be dismayed / for he myght not do ther to So Ponthus offred them all maner of gentylnes / & on the morowe after he ordeyned yt the seruyce was done for the soule in the goodlyest wyse / & gaue .iii.d. sterlenges to all theym yt wolde aske it / so there was neuer sene in the coūtre before so grete almes / for the whiche he had grete pryce / & the kȳges frendes coude hym grete thanke / & thanked hȳ moche. The body of the kynge was enbaumed and layde in a chayre ryght well stuffed / & besene of fayre horses in to his countre of Bourgoyne to be buryed. And Ponthus made the body to be cōueyed with grete torches well a .vi. myle & dyde it all the worshyp that he coude all thoughe he were not sory of his deth. Than ye lordes of bourgyne made hym to tourne agayne / & toke theyr leue of him & they gaue praysynge to Ponthus saynge there was
no knyght but he / of worthynes / of largesse / & of cour∣tesye / for he loueth god & holy chyrche / & that he hathe soo well done his deuoyre yt they were all ameruaylled Ponthus came ayen to vennes & wente to Sydoyne and kyssed her / and they talked togyder of many plea¦saunt thynges / & he bourded with her and sayd vnto her / yf that she coude ony maugree to his spere that had delyuered her of her husbande / & she wexed reed and sayd vnto hym. Syr it is peryllous for to doo de∣des of armes with you whan that kynges dye / but I can you good thanke for that ye haue done so well for his soule / for all his frendes shall thanke you & gyue you grete pryce. Ponthus sayd thynges that ought to be shall fall / ye ought not for to be full gladde ye shall haue none dower bycause ye set neuer fote in his bed with hym / & thus he bourded with her & talked of ma¦ny dyuers thynges. And than he wente to the kynge & to his barons & sayd. Syr ye haue herde how that I haue waged people for to conquere with the helpe of Ihesu the realme that sholde be myne whiche that the sarasynes occupye & kepe / so wolde I fayne & it plea∣sed your hyghnesse to haue of the men of your realme suche as wyll take wages / & I shall truely paye them for halfe a yere. A sayd the kynge / sone ye oughte not for to aske / but take my men at your wyll to conquere your herytage & my tresoures & all that euer I may haue / & yf it pleaseth you I wolde con you good than¦ke to suffre me to go in your felawshyp / for I am olde and so it sholde be but lytell losse of me / & also in better nor in more profytable seruyce for my soule myght I not dye than in the seruyce of god. Ponthus thanked hym hyghly / and sayd that at this tyme he sholde not
go / but he sholde abyde at home & kepe his countre / & as for tresoure he wolde none haue of hȳ / for god had sente hym ynoughe for this nede and other to / but he refused not his men / for it be they of the world that he moost loued / and in whome he moost trusteth at a gre¦te nede· The barons & the knyghtes of Brytayne had grete Ioye of this goynge / & euery man arayed hym for to go / euery man profered for to go with hym and he thanked them all / and thā he sayd vnto them that euery man sholde be redy within .xv. dayes after at vennes / & ordeyned by all the costes to seke shyppes & vytayl for to be at that day redy. Euery baron arayed hym & stuffed hym of vesselles / and of men of armes the best that they myght fynde. ¶How Ponthus made a maūdement of brytons poy¦teuynes / normans & angeuynes for to go in to galyce to conquere his countre yt the sarasynes helde.
POnthus sente for the Barons of Anioye / of mayne / of poytow / & of other countres aboute and he sayd yt he wolde wryte vnto them. So he sente to Geffrey de lesygnen / & Androwe de la toure ouer al men / and it was tolde hym that two were late comen home from beyonde the see / frome the realme of ger∣many where as they had ben well a two yere in warre ayenst the sarasynes. A sayd Ponthus they ben good knyghtes & worthy men well is he felawshypped that hath them in his company. Than were there sente let¦ters to them / and to dyuers other by the countrees a∣boute / as in to normandy. Anioye. Mayne. Toreyne and poytow / to them that they subposed that had wyl for to auenture themselfe to gete worshyp / that they ben assembled with hȳ the .xviii. day aftee at the toure of derbondell faste by thalamount / & there they shall fynde shyppes & fyluer / & so the messangers departed And whan the barons and the knyghtes herde the ty∣dynges of hym / & how the sarasynes helde his realme they had all grete Ioye for to go / and euery man was redy at that day assygned. Ponthus sente thrughe all the countrees golde and syluer for to gete shyppes in brytayne / in to normandy / poytow for to come some to vennes & some to sable daulon in poytow. THan after that Ponthus sente for his greate shyppe / and sente for a parte of his ryches for to come vnto vennes ayenst the daye of his maryage he sente many ryche presentes to Sydoyne of crow∣nes / of sercles / of gyrdelles / of chapelettes / of purses / of perles / of golde / of purple / of precyous stones / & of margaretes that it was meruayll for to se the grete ryches that it was worthe / for it was praysed more
than thyrty thousande besauntes of golde. The kȳge sawe theym and sayd to his doughter. Fayre dough∣ter ye be not maryed to prynce dyssheryted / god hath gyuen hym and you fayre good and ryche / and noble lo ye ought to thanke god. After that Ponthus gaue to the kynge ryght fayre gyftes and good Iewelles / as precyous stones / perles / and cuppes of golde / and to the barons of Brytayne he gaue gyftes of golde & ryches after that they were he was moche praysed for his grete gyftes and of his grete largesse. The day of the maryage were the lordes of Englonde / of Irlon∣de & of scotlonde rychely arayed / and they of brytayne dyde them grete worshyp. Grete was the feest & grete was the Ioye of mynstrelles and of heraldes. Grete gyftes gaue them Ponthus. There was many rhyn∣ges bytwene ye courses. And there were made many meruayllous thynges. Ponthus made auowe whiche was moche spoken of / for he sayd thus bycause that men sholde nt saye the kynges doughter hath taken a man without londe / therfore I make myne auowe that neuer shal I come in her bedde tyll that I be lor∣de of the realme and londe whiche was my faders / & crowned or elles I shall dye therfore. And I auowe to god yt I neuer kyssed her / nor requyred her of thyn∣ge that sholde tourne to disworshyp / whan that I de¦parted out of this countree / nor thought more to doo vnto her than vnto myne owne moder. Soo he sayd thus bycause of the wordes the kynge had meued be∣fore tyme / for the whiche he departed from brytayne. And whā Sydoyne wyste yt he had made this auowe she was ryght Ioyfull therof / all thoughe she had le∣uer haue had his felawshyp / so it was moche spokē of
some sayd that he was a ryght good man and a trewe knyght / and some sayd that he had delayed the grete frendshyp & disporte that she supposed to haue hadde with hym. Than sayd the kynge in good fayth I was to hasty to byleue suche tales so lyghtly. The feest was ryght grete / but the kynge wolde not that yere sholde be Iustes for the auenture of that befell of the kynge of bourgoyne for fere that some myschefe sholde haue befallen. And than they began to synge & daunce and made many gētylmanly dysportes. And at euen Pon¦thus came in to the chambre to Sydoyne and said vn¦to her. A my swete loue & all my Ioye / my herte / my lyfe / & all my sustynaunce. I haue ben to hasty of the auowe that I haue made / but in good fayth I made it for to saue your worshyp / for the wycked tongues of the worlde are alwaye redy to reporte the worste. And for trouth my fayre loue I shall suffre greter dysease than ony body / for the grete desyre that I haue to be bytwene your armes / but & god wyll I shall be there hasty for it is the gretest desyre that myne herte hath. My swete loue and lorde sayd she wote it well that all your pleasure is myne / & we ought to desyre no thȳge so moche as worshyp and good name / so ye haue done well for to put awaye the doubte of the mysse sayers. Inoughe they talked togyder / & than they halsed and kyssed / there was moche Ioye & feestynge of armes tyll the .xv. dayes were passed. There was ye monstre and the brytons were nombred foure thousande fyue hondred armed men. And of the normans twelue hon¦dred / and were all waged & payed for syxe monethes It was a fayre thynge for to se theym assemble with the nauy of Englonde.
¶How Ponthus departed from Brytayne for to go onquere his countree. PPonthus toke his leue of ye kynge and of Sy∣doyne. And by flatery this Guenelet dyde soo moche that he abode with the kynge & with Sydoyne as all gouernour & keper of them. And Ponthus toke hym a party of his tresoure to kepe. So at the depar∣tynge there was wepynge ynoughe of Sydoyne and of the ladyes. Ponthus kyssed her & toke his leue and betoke her the moost parte of his Iowelles & rychesse to kepe. Than he departed & wente by londe & passed by nauntes / & came to sable danlon & to derbendelles there was his grete nauy. And there arryued Geffrey de lesygnen / & Androwe de la toure with grete felaw¦shyp. And than Ponthus receyued theym with grete Ioye as the two knyghtes straungers of the worlde that he loued beste / than he gaue theym grete gyftes
And than came Guyllam de roches a good knyghte Paraunt de rocheforte / the lorde de douay. Pyers de donne. Gerarde de chateau goutyer. Iohn meleurier with the herupoys. Of the manseaus, beaunmount la vale. Sygles de doncelles and other of the countre of mayne. Of Tourayne baussay mayle hay / & of other tourangeaus. Of poytw / the vycount of toures / the erles brother of marche / maulyon chastemur / la gar∣nache & dyuers other. Ponthus gaue them grete gyf∣tes that they all were abasshed of his largesse / & sayd that there was none to serue hym / he is worthy to con¦quere and to gouerne all the worlde by his grete cour¦tesye and largesse. To euery baron & knyght he dely∣uered shyppes after that they had people. And than they toke the see and departed with grete Ioy. It ta∣ryed not longe that all the nauy assembled / soo it was a good syght to se the shyppes and the sayles drawen vp that it semed a grete forest. So they had wynde at wyll & passed the yle of doloron. And whan they were a .vi. myle from the columpne. Ponthus made the an¦cres for to be caste and all the shyppes to abyde / & he sayd to the lordes & to the chyefteynes / it were good to entre in to the countre by nyght for the mone shy∣neth / and therfore lette vs londe a thre or foure myle from columpne / and than to withdrawe our nauy a∣gayne / for I wolde not sayd Ponthus that they of ye countree sholde knowe vs for certayne causes. Than he ordeyned aboute ye sonne goynge downe that they sholde departe and so they dyde. And soo they londed a foure myle frome the cyte of columpne. Whan they were londed they sente theyr shyppes in to the hyghe see / bycause that they sholde not be aspyed. Than they
hydde them in a valey vnder a grete wood and helde themselfe as preuy as they myght. ¶How Ponthus founde his vncle the Erle of desture & syr Patrycke ye knyght in a chapell by columpne. THan Ponthus toke an hors & rode out at the wood syde for to se yf he myght fȳde ony man of the coūtree for to wete and to knowe the rule of the londe. So it befell yt he came to a lytell chapell ryght deuoute. It happened of fortune yt the erle of desture Ponthus vncle & syr Patrycke ye knyght yt saued him & his .xiii. felawes were rysen afore day. So these two knyghtes loued togyder as bretherne and they hadde saued the people from the deth & made them to yelde trybute to the hethen kynge in abydynge the mercy of god of theyr delyuernaunce. Soo they were vp before
day to come on pylgrymage to that chapell that they sholde not be aspyed of ye sarasynes. So it befell whā Ponthus sawe ye chapell he wente thyder and a lyght and wente in / and it was in the sprynge of the daye so he loked and sawe two men knelynge before ye auter for the whiche he had grete Ioye / for he supposed they were crysten men syth they were in ye chapell in theyr prayers. And whan ye two knyghtes herde hym come they were sore aferde / & wende to haue ben aspyed of the sarasynes. And Ponthus asked theym what they were / name you hardely & tell me what ye be & what lawe ye holde of / sayd Ponthus & god wyll I shal not hyde my name nor my god / for in good fayth I am a crysten man / thā sayd his vncle ye be ryght welcome for your felawshyp pleaseth vs well / & also we be cry∣sten men in herte / but we pray you that ye well tell vs what ye be. In good fayth sayd he my name is Pon∣thus / & I was ye kȳge of galyce sone / whan his vncle the erle of desture herde it he ranne to hym his armes abrode and halfed hym & kyssed hym and sayd. A my ryght dere neuewe blessyd be god that he hath gyuen me the grace that I may se you or I dye. Whan Pon¦thus sawe that he was his vncle & felte the good chere and the good wyll yt he made hym / he had grete Ioye & sayd vnto hym. For the loue of god syr what ye gyue me grete Ioy in myn herte yf it be as ye say. The day began for to wexe clere / so eche of them knewe other / and whan they knewe they kyssed / & wepte bothe two & neyther myght speke a worde / & whan they myght speke the erle sayd. A fayre lorde & neuewe how durst ye come hyder thus allone / for yf ye be aspyed ye are lyke to be deed. Fayre vncle sayd he I am not allone /
but I haue here with me more than .xxviii. thousande men of armes / as of the floure of Englonde / of Scot¦londe / of Irlonde / of Brytayne / & of other countrees aboute. Whan his vncle herde it he kneled downe and Ioyned his handes / & thanked god hyghly of his gra¦ce / than he tolde hym the gouernaunce of the londe / & how the countre and the people were saued / but that they yelde trybute to the kynge Broadas. And than he shewed hym syr Patrycke the knyght that had sa∣ued hym. And they twayne had saued all the countre Ponthus came to hym & toke hym in his armes and sayd that he was all his. So they spake ynough of dy¦uers thynges. And Ponthus ledde theym for to se his meyny / and whan they sawe them they had grete Ioy It behoueth sayd the two knyghtes that ye ordeyne you your bataylles. And so he made his ordynaunce and set in a valey foure thousande men of armes that whan the kynge sholde come out of the towne for to fyght / they sholde fall behynde hym that he sholde not withdrawe agayne to ye towne. And also they delyue∣red to syr Patrycke fyue hondred men of armes for to laye in a certayne place that whan the kynge & all his power were come out of the twone / they sholde go in as thoughe they were sente for to kepe the towne / and thus it was ordeyned amonge theym. Than sayd syr Patrycke / fayre lordes this assemble is made by the pourueyaunce of god that hath sente vs Ponthus the ryghtfull lorde of this countree. The Erle of desture sawe his sone Polydes yt whiche was a ryght goodly knyght / so he kyssed hym and made hym grete Ioye. Than sayd the erle of desture / lorde sette you in ordy∣naunce / for I shall goo tell the kynge Broad as that
crysten men are entred for to robbe this countre / & he shall come out with as many men as he may & shall come rennynge without ony ordynaūce / wherfore he shall be the more easy for to dyscomfyte. And sende ye forth a lytell balyngere for to fetche a thre score shyp∣pes to come to the londe & sette some hous on fyre / soo he shall not knowe of your grete power / wherfore he shall come all dysarayed / & without makynge ony or∣dynaunce. Than the Erle toke his leue and departed & came to the towne reght erly / he came to the kynge as a man afrayed / the kynge rose vp and he salewed hym by mahowne / & than he sayd to the kynge. Syr the crysten men be come for to pyll and to robbe your countre / and they ben but two myle frome the towne be they many sayd the kynge. Syr I wote neuer / but as I may apperceyue there ben a thre score shyppes. Fye sayd he be they no more / by mahowne in an euyll tyme be they come. So I shall tell you / for I dremed this nyght that I became a grete blacke wolfe / and yt ye set vpone me a grete whyte greyhounde & a braket and yt the greyhounde slewe me. A syr sayd the erle to the kynge ye oughte not to byleue in dremes / ye saye trouth sayd the kynge. Go and make to blowe vp the trumpettes / & do crye that euery man do arme them Soo we shall take the fals rybaudes and robbers on the see / the whiche I shall make them all to be slayne and to be drawen at the hors tayles Ye saye well sayd the erle whiche thought it sholde not go soo. The erle wente forth & armed hym / & made to crye that euery man sholde arme them. So euery man armed them and lepte on horsbacke. The kȳge was rychely armed and wente out of the towne without makynge of ony ordynaunce / but who so myght go wente. Soo there
wente forth mo than .xii. thousande on horsbacke with out fote men archers & arbelasters / & of suche as had none horses. ¶How Ponthus slewe Broadas yt slewe his fader. Ponthus had ordened his bataylles & sette in a valey foure thou∣sande mē of armes for to fall bytwene them & the towne. And syr Patrycke came with his fyue hondred fyghters in to a preuy place for to wynne the towne / & he abode tyl that he sawe his tyme to departe. The kynge smote his hors wt the spo∣res to yt parte whe∣re he sawe ye smoke towarde ye see and sawe not past a .iii. score shyppes / now on them they be all shente / theyr god shall neuer saue theym but yt they shall dye an euyll deth / he abode not tyll he was passed the place where the .iiii. thousande men were / than he behelde afore hym & sawe ye grete bataylles in ordynaūce / so he was ameruayled of this dede / & wende to haue withdrawen hȳ for to haue set his men in ordynaūce / & he ordeyned a grete party for
he was a wyse knyght & an hardy in armes / and as he made his ordynaunce he herde a grete crye bytwene hym & the twone and sawe his men flee towarde him Than he sayd there is no fleynge / lette vs renne vpon them sharpely. So he smote the hors with the spores and assembled with the bataylles. So he Iusted with Geffrey de lesygnen the whiche was not all redy / and they gaue grete strokes / but the kynge toke Geffrey at a trauers and ouerthrewe him. The kynge layde han¦de on his swerde & cryed mahowne helpe / & the fyrste that he smote he bette downe to the erthe & dyde mer∣uayllous dedes of armes. The batayll began ryghte harde & sharpe. Ponthus that had grete desyre for to do dedes of armes in especyall vpon them that helde his realme / he smote on the ryght syde & on the lefte. and bette downe sarasynes and horses and slewe all that euer he smote. The sarasynes helde them aboute theyr kynge whiche slewe and maymed many of our men. Androwe de la toure sawe Geffrey de Lesygnen on fote that myght not lepe vp agayne / and was sore brused and in grete peryll / he smote a turke and ouer threwe hym & toke his hors & ledde it maugre them al to Geffrey & sayd vnto hym / fayre felawe lepe vp / for here is a peryllyous abydynge on fote. Geffrey lept vp & thanked hym / & whan they two were togyder they made grete slaughter vpon ye sarasynes / wel beftyred them the brytons and the herupoys. There was grete crye / & the kynge dyde blowe a trumpet & gadered his meyny togyder / & gaue a stronge batayll to our men. Ponthus loked aboute & apperceyued the kȳge yt had slayne his fader / & also by hȳ many men were slayne for he dyde grete dedes of armes with his body / he is
ryght rychely armed & hath a crowne vpon his helme Ponthus had grete Ioye that he had founde hym & wente towarde hym & gaue hym a grete stroke / & the kȳge smote hym agayne / so there was stronge batayl bytwene them / for the kynge was ryght stronge & of grete herte / but Ponthus gaue hym soo many grete strokes that he made hym all astonyed and to stoupe and kytte the lace of his helme. And the kȳge had thā no more strength nor myght no lenger endure. Pon∣thus smote hym well with all his strength and smote a two his necke vnder his helme so that he fell downe deed. And whan his men sawe it they bette theyr han¦des and were all dyscomfyted / & on the other syde the foure thousande came behynde and kepte theym in so that there escaped none but all wente to the swerde. They were all put to ye deth without ony mercy. Syr Patrycke wente out of his enbusshement / and came fyrst with fyfty armed men for to gete the gate of the towne / & cōmaunded yt the remenaunt sholde folowe after. So he came to the cyte & they knewe hym well. And they asked hym how it wente with the kynge & his people / & he sayd ryght euyll. Than entred syr Pa∣trycke & wanne the gate / & kepte it tyll the remenaūt came to hym / than he set good kepynge at the gate & badde that no man sholde entre in tyl Ponthus came Than wente he in to the towne sekynge the houses of the sarasynes / & tho that he founde he put to the deth. So syr Patrycke wente cryenge thrughe the towne. A morte sarasynes and lyue crysten. The crysten men that were in the towne that were in seruage & yolden true / they made a crosse wt theyr armes so they founde no body that dyde them harme / nor of no thynge that
longed to theym / for syr Patrycke had so ordeyned it. The towne was wonne / for all men of defence were gone vnto the batayll where as they were slayne. So there was more than .xxxv. thousande slayne. Whan the dyscomfyture was done euery man sought the fel∣des for to fynde his frendes his cosyn or his mayster. So there was not many slayne of grete men of name Of brytayne there was founde deed of barons and of knyghtes. Geffrey dauncemys / & Bryaunt de pount. Rowlande de corquyan. Henry de Syan. Bernabe de saynt Gyle / & many other hurte / but they stode in noo peryl of deth. Of ye herupoys Hubert de craon. Pyers de chenulle / & of knyghtes. Thybault de bryse. Hame∣lyn de mountlayes / and Eustace de la poyssouner. Of poyteuynes. Androwe de la marche. Iohan garnage and Hubyn dargenton / & of knyghtes. Amaulry de la forest / and Henry de basoches / & of Mayne. Ardenne de sylle / & Olyuer de dōcelles / & of knyghtes Grayue de cusses. Guyllam du sages. Of normans. Rycharde tesson. Guy paynell / & Pyers de vyllyers and well a fyue knyghtes more. And for Englonde & Scotlonde there were fewe slayne / for they were in ye rerewarde and they of the lowe marches bare the brute / for they were in the forewarde. And Ponthus cōmaunded to take all these bodyes & to be buryed in the grete chyr∣che of columpne / and dyde ordeyne all ye seruyce and worshyppe that myght be done for them / in so moche that euery man praysed hym for his good dedes. The crysten people were serched & layde togyder / the deed on the one syde / and the hurte on ye other syde. Whan this was done. Ponthus and his bataylles rode vnto the towne. There was delyuered to euery lorde after
that he was of men / stretes & houses and they founde soo moche ryches and vytayll that the poorest hadde ynoughe. It was cryed that no man sholde take nou∣ghte frome the crysten people of the towne nor to doo them no wronge. ¶How Ponthus was crowned kynge of galyce / and how he offred his horse and his harnays. POnthus rode streyght to ye grete chyrche & of∣fred vp his hors & his harnays / & dyde do sȳge thre masses / & knelynge wepynge full sore thankynge god of his grete grace. After yt the erle his vncle & syr Patrycke came to hȳ & asked coūseyl what they shold do / & syr Patrycke sayd I coūseyll before all thȳges yt to thē yt haue ony charge or kepȳge of townes castelles
or fortresses be letters wrytē to them as it were from theyr kynge that after the syght of ye letters they come to this towne bothe day and nyght in all ye haast they may / & some shall be taken here / & some shall be taken by enbusshementes that we shall laye in certayne pla¦ces & so we shall haue the moost parte of them & euer we shall haue the lesse a do. This coūseyll was holden in suche maner that frome townes & castelles all they came to ye towne of columpne / & some were taken in the towne & put to deth / and the remenaūt dystressed by enbusshementes. So they were ouerthrowen in dy¦uers places. Whan the crysten people that had lyued in seruage herde of the dyscomfyture of the sarasynes they rose by townes and by castelles and slewe as ma¦ny of theym as they myght fynde / and soo longe was the warre ledde that all the londe was clensed & dely∣uered of them / for some of them dyde yelde them and were conuerted / & Ponthus gaue them good ynough to lyue vpon / and the remenaūt that myght flee they fledde. wherof some were slayne by ye spanyardes and by theym of ye realme of Castyle / & other perysshed in dyuers places myscheuously. Wherof ye Sowdan of babyloyne was syth ryght sorowfull / for to haue loste thus his thre sones and his men / he was ryght angry with mahowne & sayd before all men as a man out of his wytte that the god crucyfyed had ouercome hym & that he was of greter vertue than mahowne whan he hadde not saued his sones / & his men. And so there was grete complaynt for theym in babyloyne & in da∣maske. Ponthus made leches to be sought for to hele the people that were woūded and hurte in the batayll & hymselfe vysyted them often & made men to brȳge
them all that theym neded / he fested & felawshypped the lordes and gaue theym grete gyftes. And also he founde in a toure the grete tresour of kynge Broadas the whiche was a grete thynge to tell. And whan he had ouer ryden the countre and clensed of the mysoyle¦uers / he founde moche people & the londe well labou∣red bothe of vynes and of cornes. From all the coun∣trees the people came rennynge for to se theyr ryght¦full lorde as it had ben to myracles / & they loued hym well for his grete renowne and worthynes his bounte and his courtesye / for there was none so symple nor so poore but that he wolde speke to & here hym mekely / he was ryght pyteuous of the poore people / he loued god and holy chyrche. And whan he had done all his dedes he came to the columpne to his crownacōn whe¦re he was full solemply crowned by the handes of the bysshop / at whiche daye he helde a notable & a royall feest. And thyder came to hym the kynge of Aragon his vncle / & that was his moders brother the whiche had grete Ioye to se hym & of his vyctorye / & he tolde hym how kynge Broadas had warred vpon hym and how there was takē a trewes bytwene them for a cer¦tayne tyme / in to the tyme that god had set remedye and thrughe his grace he hath ryght well purueyed of the pyte by you. Thus complayned the kynge to his neuewe / & yet he tolde hym that he abode ye comynge downe of the kynge of Fraūce & the kynge of spayne that sholde haue come this somer / but I thanke god it is now no nede. The feest was grete of the kynges crownacyon / & there was made many straunge thyn¦ges. The grete lordes of the countre they came & dyde theyr homage. And also the fayre ladyes hadde grete
Ioye that they were comen out of hell and of seruage where as they had lyued in sorowe & heuynes / & now they be aswaged in to Ioye & myght & in to paradyse as them semeth. They lyked well theyr kynge in so mo¦che that they had Ioye to loke vpon hym / and all ma∣ner of people thanked god hyghly of theyr delyueraun¦ce. There was songes and many mynstrelsyes whi∣che were to longe to tell. ¶How Ponthus knewe his moder amonge ye poore people that wente askȳnge theyr brede for goddes sa∣ke & how he put his crowne vpon her heed. THe kynge dyde brynge & presente by .xii. fayre ladyes and .xii. olde knyghtes grete gyftes & Iowelles to the good knyghtes & chyeftaynes / some of fayre coursers & other of fayre cuppes of golde and syluer / of fayre clothes of golde & of sylke and many o∣ther grete Iowelles / soo yt all men were ameruaylled of his largesse. He was a man ryght pleasaunt and of grete courtesye & of good condycyons. So there befel a grete meruayll for the custome was that before the kynge sholde be serued .xiii. poore people for the loue of god and his apostles. So it befell the erle wente vysy∣tynge the tables as god wolde / he behelde the table of the poore people / and sawe a woman that loked vpon the kynge / & as she behelde hym the teeres fell downe frome her eyen. The erle loked vpon her & auysed her so wel that by a token she had in her chynne he knewe well that it was ye quene moder vnto kȳge Ponthus And whan he knewe her & sawe her in so poore estate that her gowne was all to clouted and all to rente / he myght not kepe hym from wepȳge so his herte swym¦med
for pyte to se her in soo poore araye. And whan he myght speke he thanked god and wente behynde the kynge his neuewe & sayd to hym. Syr here is a grete meruayll / wherof sayd the kynge. The best and ye ho∣lyest lady that I knowe my lady the quene your mo∣der is here in / where is she sayd he / and he with grete payne myght tell hym for pyte / and whan he myght speke he tolde hym in counseyll. Syr se her yonder wt the .xiii. poore folke at ye fyrst ende / and ye kynge Pon∣thus behelde her and she apperceyued it and put her hode afore her eyen & wepte. And the kynge had grete pyte in his herte and sayd vnto his vncle. Fayre vncle make noo semblaunt that none aspye it but whan we are vp fro the table I shall goo in to the warderobe & thyder brynge her pryuely to me / and so it was done. Whan the tables were taken vp and graces yelden to god / the kynge departed pryuely and wente in to his warderobe and the Erle of desture his vncle brought thyder the quene his moder pryuely. And whan kyge Ponthus sawe her he kneled downe before her / & toke his crowne & set it on her heed. And she toke hym vp all wepynge & kyssed hym / often she kyssed hym and halsed hym / & sore they wepte she & her sone & the erle And whan they myghte speke / kynge Ponthus sayd vnto her. A madame so moche pouerte and dysease ye haue suffred & endured. A my swete knyght and sone sayd she I am come out of the paynes of hell and god hath gyuen me paradyse whan it hath pleased hym to gyue me soo longe lyfe that I may se you with myne eyen / and that I se vengeaunce for my lorde your fa∣der that tho tyraūtes put to the deth / and also that I se the countree voyded of the messebyleuers / and the
holy lawe of Ihesu cryste to be serued / & I wote well that this trouble and sorowe hath endured well a .xiii. yere as by chastysynge of god / for the grete delytes & lustes that were vsed in this realme / soo me semeth now that god hath mercy on his people that he hath kepte you and sente you for to delyuer the countre of the mysbyleuers. Ryght well spake the quene & wysely as an holy lady that she was. Now I praye you sayd the kȳge tell me how ye escaped / & how ye were saued Fayre sone I shal tell you / whan ye crye was grete in the towne in ye mornynge & your fader slayne. I was in my bedde & your fader armed hym wt an hawberke and his helme / & ranne forth without ony more aby∣dynge as the hardyest knyght that was as men sayd. Whan he was departed & herde the crye I was sore a ferde / & toke one of my womennes gownes & wente my waye with my launder I founde of auenture the posterne open yt some people had opened / soo I went out & wente to the woodes faste by the landes / where as dwelled an holy heremyte the whiche had a chapell and a lodge at the wodes syde. So I abode there and my chamberer whiche was aged came euery daye to fetche the almes at the kynges hous. And therby we lyued the heremyte she and I / & so ye may se how / god hath saued me. In good fayth sayd ye kȳge her sone ye ledde an holy lyfe / & so dyde she for she wered ye hayre & wente gyrde with a corde & was an holy lady. The kȳge had grete Ioye & grete pyte of his moder. Than he sente for his taylloures and dyde shape kyrtelles gownes and mantelles for his moder of veluet bothe blewe & purple & made them to be furred with veer and ermyne & fables / & whan it came to theyr souper
they brought in the quene rychely arayed. And whan the kynge of Aragon her brother sawe her he toke her in his armes and kyssed her & sayd that he wende not that she had ben on lyue. The lordes and the ladyes of Galyce had grete Ioye of the quene & dyde her grete worshyp / for they helde her for a good & an holy lady. And they were all ameruaylled fro whens she came / for they wende she had be deed. Her brother the kynge of Aragoon was set at souper at the tables ende / and after the quene & than her sone / the kynge Ponthus for the day of his crownacyon he must kepe his estate The quene was of goodly porte & semed well to be a grete lady / she was ryght humble & had grete Ioye of the goodnes and worshyp that she sawe in her sone. Than she sayd to her sone. Fayre sone I haue grete desyre for to se our doughter your wyfe for the grete goodes I haue herde of her. Madame sayd he ye shall se her hastely yf it please god. That daye passed with grete Ioye & grete dysportes of ladyes of syngynge of daunsynge / and of other maner playes. That nyght kynge Ponthus dremed that a bere deuoured quene Sydoyne his wyfe and she cryed & sayd. A Ponthus my swete lorde suffre me not thus to dye. This auy∣syon fell to hȳ twyes or thryes / so he was sore afrayed ther with & grete meruayll in his herte what it mente In the mornynge in the sprynge of the daye he called vp his men and sente for his vncle & syr. Patrycke / so they came to hym & he tolde them his auysyons / & he sayd myne herte telleth me that my wyfe hath some sekenes or in some trouble / so I wyll no lenger abyde here / for I wyll go as faste as I can to se her. Whan they sawe his wyll they durste not agayne saye hym.
Than sayd the kynge / fayre lordes I thanke god and you this countree is clensed of the myssebyleuers / and I thynke well yt by you two the coūtre hath be saued and the people kepte fro the deth by your good rule as it was goddes wyll. So I bethynke me of Moyses & Aaron that god set to saue the people of Israell / so ye shall haue meryte and the guerdon of god. And as for me I am ryght moche bounde to you / wherfore fayre vncle I make you my leutenaūt / & syr Patrycke shall be senesshall & constable of this realme / for it is grete reason that ye that haue done soo moche good & saued the countre ye to haue the rule and the gouernaunce. And ye syr Patrycke my dere frende ye saued me / soo I shall gyue you londe & good so largely yt ye shall not lese your good seruyce. Syr Patrycke kneled downe and thanked hym. Than the kynge cōmaunded them that the estate of ye quene his moder were kepte / and that she sholde haue her cōmaundement as it were to his owne propre persone / & also yt they sholde susteyne the poore as well as the ryche & that the ryche sholde not greue nor ouerlay the poore. And than he cōmaū∣ded theym to repayre chyrches & glasse wyndowes / & of all other thynges where as they were broken to ma¦ke them vp agayne / & I shall take you ten thousande besauntes of golde therto / he ordeyned ryght well for his realme all thynges that neded. And than he went and herde his masses & sent his dyner in to the shyppe and toke his leue of his moder the quene & sayd vnto her herynge all men. Madame I leue you the realme and the tresoure that I haue all in your grace & gouer¦naunce. I haue cōmaūded & cōmaūde all men to obey you as I my propre persone & better I leue you myn
vncle and syr Patrycke my good knyght yt whiche I haue made my constable & seneshall of this realme & myne vncle my leutenaunt. Soo he toke his leue we∣pynge / & she prayed hym that he wolde come agayne in shorte tyme / for she wolde fayne se his wyfe / and he toke his leue of the lordes & the ladyes of the countree and wente to the shyppes / & euery man arayed hym & dressed hym to the see. Kynge Ponthus came vnto ye barns & tolde theym what auysyon there was befall hym / wherfore he sholde neuer be at hertes ease tyl he had sene his wyfe. So he toke the see & sayled so longe tyll he sawe the costes of Brytayne. ¶Of ye false letters and treason that Guenelet dyde ayenst Ponthus / wherfore he dyed with grete mysche¦fe as ye shall here hereafter. GUenelet was abyden keper of the kȳge and of his doughter / for kynge Ponthus had gyuen hym all the gouernaūce as ye haue herde before wher¦fore he had grete Ioye. Neuerthelesse he myght not kepe hymselfe nor chastyse hymselfe from treason / so he bethought hym that he wolde haue the quene Sy∣doyne to his wyfe by what waye and that he wolde be lorde and kynge of the countree eyther by fayre or by foule / & so he wolde set hymselfe in auenture. Soo the deuyll tempted hym so moche yt he dyde stuffe the cyte and the castelles & sente for sowdyours & gaue theym syluer in hande for to haue the loue of them of armes. So is syluer of an euyll vertue for the good men put them in peryll of deth. And whā he had stuffed all the fortresses he dyde make a fals seale of kȳge Ponthus
and made two false letters that one to the kynge and that other to the quene Sydoyne / the whiche specy∣fyed that kynge Ponthus recōmaunded hym to the kynge / & that all his men were dyscomfyted & slayne and hymselfe hurte to the deth without ony remedye So he prayed hym that for his welfare & for the welth of the countre that he wolde gyue his doughter vnto Guenelet / & that better he myght not besette her. And for to make the maryage he gaue hym all his tresour that he broughte out of Englonde. The letters were ryght well deuysed / & in the letter of quene Sydoyne was how he prayed her and requyred her for the loue that was bytwene thē that she wolde take Guenelet his cosyn. And whan the kynge & his doughter sawe the letters / it is not to aske of the greate sorowe that they made & heuynesse. Quene Sydoyne swowned ofte & wepte & wysshed after hym the whiche myght not out of her mynde / she drewe and rente her fayre heere and made so grete sorowe that it was pyte to se So the ladyes & all the coūtre were in grete heuynes for hym and sayd. Alas what domage what pyte / the floure of knyghthode / the floure of all gentylnes / my roure of all good maners. And the comyn people they wepte & sorowed for theyr frendes & for theyr kynne∣for they wende yt they all had ben deed. There myght no man comforte quene Sydoyne. Alas sayd she he where as all bounte & trouth dwelled in / & by whome I thought to haue all Ioye the whiche was so free / & so true / & loued me so well / and was so lykly to haue holde the people in rest & peas / how hath god suffred suche an auenture ayenst hym and ayenst me. Alas so rowfull creature what shall I do. So there was none
so harde an harte but that he sholde haue had pyte on her. This sorowe dured more than eyght dayes with out ony cessynge. And Guenelet came and sayd to the kynge how that kynge Ponthus requyred hym that he sholde gyue hym his doughter / soo he flatered hym ryght fayre & sayd that he sholde serue hym & her / and worshyp them & kepe them and the realme. And that kynge Ponthus had gyuen hym golde & syluer more than the realme was worthe. So he offred it to hȳ & sayd. Syr I praye you go speke with your doughter that she wyll consent. The kȳge was aged so he wyste not what to saye. And Guenelet dyde so moche by his subtyll wytte that he made the kynge to consent. The kynge came to his doughter and comforted her in the fayrest wyse that he myght & sayd vnto her that dys∣comforte dyde but greue her without ony helpe to her nor to his realme. And syth that kynge Ponthus re∣quyred it that she sholde haue Guenelet that for the lo¦ue of hym. And for the grete tresour that he hadde gy∣uen hym / & also that he sholde obey vnto hym and ke∣pe his realme / for sayd the kȳge he is wyse & shall aby¦de in this realme for to rule it / for yf I gaue you to ony kynge he wolde lede you in to his countre / & soo sholde this londe abyde without ony gouernoure / whan que¦ne Sydoyne had herde her fader thus speke she hadde grete meruayll / & sayd that & god be pleased he shall not be her husbonde / and that she sholde rather dye. And than the kȳge that loued her soo moche sayd yth that it pleaseth you not ye shall not haue hym / but ad¦de her be of good comforte. Soo he came to Guenelet and sayd his doughter wolde haue none husbonde at this tyme. O sayd Guenelet refuseth she me / it shall
not be al at her wyll. So he came to her & made moche of her & gaue her fayre langage how that he thought to serue her & to obey her & she to be lady of all / & that no thynge shall be done in the realme but by her com∣maundement / & how he hath the tresoure of her sayd lorde that was wonne vpon the sarasynes the whiche was gyuen hym by his letters. Moche made he of her and flatered her / but alwaye it auaylled not for she swore vnto hym that she sholde not be wedded of all that yere for man that speketh with tongue. O said he yf your fader cōmaūde you wyll ye dysobey hym My lorde may cōmaunde me what soeuer it pleaseth hym sayd she / but for to dye I shal abyde all this yere / after say I not but that I wyll obey hym / ye said Guenelet make ye refuse of me / & wyll ye not obey the letters of your forsayd lorde the whiche ye desyred and loued soo moche / & that there was no thynge but that ye wolde do for hym. And syth ye lyste not to obey hym / nor to his prayer / nor to his letter / & also ye lyste not to obey the cōmaundement of your fader. By ye fayth I owe to hym but yf ye take other counseyll I doubte that ye wyll be angred / so he thretened her whan by fayrenes he myght not haue her. And than he sayd syth that he hath the letter of her forsayd lorde / and the consent of the kynge her fader / that she sholde do it whyther she wolde or not / ye sayd she am I in that partye / ye sayd he by my fayth ye shal se what shal befall. Rather said she I shall suffre euery lymme of me to be hewen from other / ye sayd he it shall be sene all betyme. So he de∣parted as a mad man / for he wened not to fayle of her Quene Sydoyne was all abasshed & thought in her herte that it was not the fyrst treason yt he had done.
Soō she thought well that the letters sholde be falfe / for other tymes he had done vnderstonde yt kȳge Pon¦thus thus was deed / so called she two squyers & .iii. yemen of her chambre that she had / & called Elyos and two other gentylwomen / & sayd vnto them that doubted her of Guenelet / & shewed them how he was hote we∣nynge to haue her eyther by fayre or by foule / for he is malycious & perauenture he wolde werke by stryngth So I haue purposed we shall go in to yonder toure / and do bere thyder some vytayll & there shall we aby∣de vnto ye tyme we haue some rescowe of our frendes or some of the barons / or elles haue herde the trouth of my lorde kynge Ponthus. ¶How Guenelet menassed Sydoyne the whiche had drawen in to a toure. THey dyde bere brede & wyne in botelles / and barelles & in pottes / flesshe & chese & all thȳge that theym neded as longe as they had layser / & than they shette the dore with ye barres / & bare vp rockes &
stones for to defende it / for Guenelet had thought for to take it ayenst her wyll & for to haue done her outra∣ge yf she wolde not haue consented. So he came in to her chambre / and whan he founde her not he serched the warderobe where he founde a gentylwoman whi∣che tolde hym she was withdrawen in to the toure / & how she had vytaylled it and stuffed it. And whan he herde it he loked as a madman and came before the toure & prayed her full fayre that she sholde open hym the dore & swore by his fayth that he wolde not mysse doo her / but quene Sydoyne whiche knewe well his vntrouth sayd that he sholde not come in. But whan he sawe that he myght not come in by that meane / he thretened her sore and swore that he sholde take her by force / & make her his wenche yf she wolde not be his wyfe / & badde her chose whiche that she wolde. A said she whiche that was angry to here tho vngoodly wor¦des. Traytoure thou shalte not come therto and god wyll / for thou shalte dye an euyll deth for this false en¦terpryse. Than he waxed angry and sayd syth that he had done so moche he wolde fynysshe it what soo euer befall. Soo he toke the kynge and put hym in pryson for fere that he sholde gader no men of armes ayenst hym. And than he came to the bourgeys & sayd vnto hym how quene Sydoyne was gyuen hym of her hus∣bonde by good letters / & also the kynge her fader was accorded therto hycause that she wolde haue be wed∣ded to a man of nought the whiche wolde haue hated and dystroyed ye countre / but sayd he yf I haue her I shall kepe the fraunchyses and lybertees / & shall kepe you as golde doth the stone. So I haue set the kynge in a chambre for he is al doted and hath no wytte / & he
wolde lyghtly consente vnto the lewde courage of his doughter / wherby the countre sholde be loste yf it be∣fell as they thynke / but I shal kepe them well therfro with goddes helpe & youres for to saue the welfare of brytayne. So he gaue largely to them that he suppo∣sed myght noye hym / & he dyde it in suche wyse / we∣nynge to them that he had sayd trouth / wherfore they durste not ones aryse nor meue / and also he had many straunge sowdyours. ¶How Guenelet made to assayle the toure where as Sydoyne was in. WHan he had spoken with the bourgeys and ye people he came to the toure & assayled it. So there was within but .v. men & foure women that threwe downe grete stones & defended the toure well / & also there was the moost parte of them yt dyde but fayne / for they wolde not that she sholde be taken The assaute lasted a grete whyle. And whā Guenelet
had fayled he was ryght sorowfull & angry & thought at ye leest he wolde haue enfamysshed them. In good fayth sayd quene Sydoyne we haue vytayll ynoughe for a moneth or more / & in the meane tyme god shall helpe vs and sende vs rescowes. And whan Guenelet vnderstode her he wende to haue renne madde for an¦ger for he was all dystraught bycause he fayled of his purpose / & wolde & wysshed yt he had neuer begon / but syth that he hath vndertaken it he wyll fynysshe it or elles dye therfore. Soo he set good watche & wardes aboute the toure that there sholde no vytayll come to them / & than he bethought hym of a grete malyce / for he came to the kynge & prayed hym that he wolde go to his doughter for he woteth well yt he sholde tourne her of her foly that she hath taken in honde / and tolde hym that he wolde not famysshe her but fall to a trety The kynge was good & trewe & thought none harme but wente to his doughter & tolde her how she was in waye to be deed & shewed her many ensamples. And she answered hym to the contrary / & how he thought well the letters were false / and ye wote well sayd she that other tymes hath he sayd that he was deed. Soo I shall rather dye but yf I knowe ye very trouth. In good fayth sayd the kynge it may well be as ye saye / for I knowe no man of knowlege that hath ben there and harde it is where as none escapeth. So they ben somwhat comforted for the grete vntrouth that they knowe in hym. Guenelet asked the kȳge that he sawe aboue at the wyndowe. Syr what wyll she doo. Soo helpe me god sayd the kynge I may not spede / for she is yet all sorowfull and angry for her lorde / wherfore I may haue no good answere. No sayd Guenelet by
the holy fayth ye shall abyde with her and bere her fe∣lawshyp for to ete pesen & plommes / for ye shall bothe two dye for honger or I shall haue her. So the kynge abode with his doughter / wherfore she had the soner pyte for the honger and dysease of her fader. Foure dayes or fyue they had mete ynoughe but at the syxte day theyr vytaylles fayled them / for them had neyther brede nor flesshe. So they were two dayes that they ete no mete saue a lytell chese / & eche of thē a draught of wyne. The kynge began to feble sore. Quene Sy∣doyne had noo more but syxe apples wherof she gaue her fader euery daye two / she wepte and sorowed for the grete dysease that her fader was in / and that dyde her more sorowe than her owne. So loked ofte tymes out at a wyndowe towarde ye see / yf she myght se ony thynge come. Soo she wysshed ofte tymes after her lorde kynge Ponthus and than she wepte and made grete sorowe desyrynge her owne dethe & sayd to the kynge. A my lorde it had ben better for you that I had ben deed longe ago than to gyue you suche a payne or that ye had suffred so moche honger for me. The kyn∣ge wepte and sayd I had leuer dye fr honger rather than yonder traytour sholde haue you by this meane Quene Sydoyne called hym and sayd / fals traytour how mayst thou suffre the kynge to dye whiche is soo good a man. Alas sayd she is it ye norture that he hath made of the whan thou hast besyeged & makest him to dye for honger and for thurste that often tymes hathe gyuen the good mete and drynke / is this the guerdon that thou yeldest hym. She sayd hym moche shame / but it auaylled noo thynge / for he made his othe that he sholde made hym too dye for veray greate honger
yf she wolde not consente to be his. The kynge dyed almoost for honger & laye in his bedde and myght not stere. And whā quene Sydoyne behelde hym she sayd that she had leuer dye or languysshe all her lyfe than her fader sholde dye for her / than she sayd vnto hym wepȳge. My ryght swete lorde & fader I may no len∣ger suffre your sorowe nor the honger ye abyde. I ha∣ue leuer to for dye or elles to be in sorowe al my lyf lan¦guysshynge than to se you in this plyght. The kynge wepte and wyste neuer what to saye for to se that he sholde haue his doughter by this waye it greued hym sore / & on the other syde to se hymselfe dye & her togy∣der it dyde hȳ harme / for they sholde be cause of theyr owne dethe. So he sorowed sore & sayd that he had to longe lyued / so he coude not counseyll hymselfe & sayd vnto her. Fayre doughter I wote neuer how we may be auysed nor what counseyll I may gyue you so mo∣che sorowe I haue / but for to se you dye I may not suf¦fre it. And I wolde that the deth toke me so that kyn¦ge Ponthus were on lyue in the towne on ye stronger partye / for he wolde auenge hym well on the traytour yt wolde haue you ayenst your wyl. And the squyers & the gentylwomen the whiche were at the deth & wood for honger as it was noo meruayll for it was passed foure dayes and more that they had eten no maner of thynge / & they sayd. Madame ye shall be cause of the deth of the kynge youre fader / of you and vs / it were better to take the vnhappy man than for to do wors. Whan she sawe that she muste nedes do it for to saue her fader more than for her owne deth that she recked not of / she sayd that syth it is so she shall do her wyll. Than she wente to ye wyndowe & dyde call Guenelet
and he came so she tourned agayne & sent her fader & badde hym to speke to Guenelet / & yf he myght fynde none other remedy that ye sholde accorde with him so that he haue .viii. dayes or more of respyte yf ye may to recouer vs of the honger & sorowe that he hath set vs in. The kynge rose vp & spake to Guenelet and she wed hym that by strength he sholde neuer gete ye loue of her / & that he wolde leue his enterpryse & he sholde gyue hym townes & castelles or what thynge yt he wol¦de haue. He answered agayne yt he wolde not take all ye realme but yt he wolde haue her syth yt her lorde had gyuen her to hym. Than sayd the kynge here is but ly∣tell reason. I doubte me yt ye wyll not reioyse her lon∣ge. All auayled not yt the kynge sayd for he was more in cursydnes than he was afore. And sayd not for to dye he wolde leue his enterpryse what so euer befall. The kȳge asked hym a monethes respyte & at the mo∣nethes ende he sholde gyue hȳ an answere. And Gue∣nelet wolde ryght nought do but the kȳge dyde so mo∣che yt he had foure dayes of respyte & after the foure dayes he sholde wedde her / & that she cōsented therto. And thus was the mater agreed & sworne / & yet sayd Guenelet yt she sholde not departe out of ye coure tyll the daye came yt sholde be wedded / he had grete Ioye and dyde bere her euery daye of the best metes that he myght fynde / & than he helde the kynge well auysed. After the fourth daye the feest & the araye was grete / for Guenelet flyed for Ioye for to haue so fayre a lady that he loued so moche. The kynge wente and fetched her doune and she came all be wepte / and was so heuy that she had leuer haue dyed than lyued / and wysshed in her herte after her lorde kynge Ponthus and sayd
Alas in an euyll houre was I borne / for symple chaū∣ge haue I now made. So she was ledde to the chirche and the bysshop fyaunced them & wedded them. The teres fel often & thycke from her eyen. The mete was ordeyned & there was many dyuers thȳges of trum∣pes / taboures / & fydelles. Ryght mery & Ioyous was Guenelet / but I doubte it was ayenst his mysse auen¦ture as it pleased god / for euery mā shal be rewarded after his seruyce / yt day was the feest ryght grete ¶Here leueth to speke of them and retourne agayne to kynge Ponthus. POnthus the kynge whiche was in the shyppes and had taken the see and hadde taken leue of his moder and of his vncle and of his Barons of the countre / and had all ordeyned as ye haue herde afore He dyde drawe vp the saylles and had wynde at wyll and saylled soo longe tyll they arryued in the yle of the¦re faste by the rochell / there toke leue of hym the poy∣teuynes the aungeuynes / manseaus / & torengeaus. So kynge Ponthus toke his leue of them & thanked them moche and gaue them grete gyftes. Than he to¦ke the see agayne he and the other nauy of Englonde & of brytayne. And the wynde fell all calyne / & kynge Ponthus toke two small Balyngers / and a thre score felawes with hym and began to rowe Qunene Sy∣doyne had dremed that her lorde came / wherfore she had sente one of her squyers to the see syde to se yf ony thynke came. So he was lepte on a courser and he be∣helde the two balyngers & sawe in them a standarde. So he supposed wel that it was of the army of galyce wherfore he toke his hode & made a sygne of callynge
Kynge Ponthus behelde and sayd / se yōnder a ryder and that maketh vs a sygne of callȳge / & it semeth as though he had grete haast or elles he mocketh vs haast you that we there at hym. And whan he knewe that it was kynge Ponthus he cryed vnto hym. A syr haast you what is there / is there ony thynge. ¶How the kynge Ponthus slewe Guenelet in playne souper. THan the squyer tolde hym how that Guenelet had serued hym frome poynt to poynte. And whan kynge Ponthus herde this he blessyd hym and was ameruaylled that euer he thought to do suche grete treason. Now sayd ye squyer they shall be
anone at souper / so it shall be harde to come in. I shal tell you sayd kȳge Ponthus how we shall do / we shal dysguyse vs at yonder vyllage / & we shall go in daun∣synge with pypes and tabours / and we shall bere pre∣sentes saynge that we ben felowes whiche haue grete Ioye of the maryage / & by that meane we shall come in with the daunses. In good fayth sayd the squyers it is well sayd / and soo it was done. Kynge Ponthus and his felowes dysguysed theym in gownes of the good mennes of the subbarbes. And they went daun∣synge in to the courte. So it was nyghe ye sonne goyn¦ge downe / and men lete theym entre in to the hall wel dysguysed. Some had hatres of strawe and of grene bowes / and some had hodes stuffed with heye / some were haltynge / & some were croke backed / euery man made after his owne guyse. Guenelet had grete Ioye and sayd / ye se well how the comyn people haue grete Ioye of our weddynge / here be fayre dysportes that they make vs / but he knewe not of ye busshemēt wher∣by he was sone angred▪ And whan kynge Ponthus and his felawshyp had daunsed twyes or thryes abou∣te the hall / and had beholde the hyghe deys and sawe Guenelet that made grete Ioye and grete feest of the daunses and wayted at the table. Kynge Ponthus ca¦me thyderwarde and caste awaye his dysguysynge so that euery man knewe hym and sayd to Guenelet. A tryatour false and vntrue how durste thou thynke so grete treason ayenst me and the kynge and his dough¦ter whiche haue nourysshed the and done the soo mo∣che good / a symple guerdon haste thou yelded theym agayne therfore / but now yu shalte haue thy payment.
Guenelet behelde hym the whiche was all loste & wyst not what to answere / for he thought he had ben deed. Kynge Ponthus drewe a lytell sweede ryght sharpe & smote hym so that he claue his heed & the body to the nauyll / & after he cutte of his heed in sygne of a tray∣toure in two peces / & made hym to be drawen out / & cōmaunded yt he sholde be borne to the gallous / whan the kynge and his doughter sawe the kynge Ponthus they lepte fro the table & came rennynge theyr armes abrode & halsed hym & kyssed hym. Quene Sydoyne wepte for Ioye & kyssed his mouth & his eyen and she myght not departe frome hym. Kynge Ponthus had so grete pyte for the dysease that they had suffred that the teres fell from his eyen so sore his herte was. And whan theyr hertes were somwhat lyghted the kynge sayd. Fayre sone it had but lytell fayled that ye sholde haue loste the syght of your wyfe & me. Than he tolde hym of the grete treason of the false letters / & of the hunger that he made them to suffre. Kynge Ponthus blessyd hym & was all abasshed & sayd that neuer erst was borne suche a traytoure / nor neuer was thought suche a false treason. I bethynke me sayd he of Ihesu cryst yt had .xii. apostles / of the whiche one solde hym. And so we came hyder .xiii. felowes as it pleased god / wherof one was wors than Iudas / but thāked be god he is well payed of his rewarde. A sayd the kynge yf ye had lenger abyden ye had be yet more mocked. God wolde it not sayd kynge Ponthus. Now lete vs leue this talkynge sayd the kynge / for this mater is well fy¦nysshed to my pleasure / and lete vs thynke for to lede Ioye & dysporte / and also tell vs of your dede how ye haue spedde. Ryghte well I thanke god sayd kynge
Ponthus. Than he tolde hym of the batayll & of the dyscomfyture / & how the countre was clensed & well laboured / and than there were some that tolde all the rule & the maner / & how he was crowned. They had all grete Ioye to here of the fayre auenture that god had sente hym. Than they set theym downe to souper and songe & daunsed & ledde Ioye. Quene Sydoyne was mery & glad / & it is not to aske how in her herte she thanked god mekely to be escaped from soo grete peryll. That nyght they were wel eased / for both theyr hertes had ben in dystresse. They talked of many thȳ∣ges & had ynoughe of Ioye and dysporte togyder / for they loued full well togyder. They loued god and holy chirche & were ryght charytable & pyteuous of ye poore people. That nyght the sowdyours of Guenelet fled∣de awaye who so myght go wente. All ye people than∣ked god of ye comynge of kynge Ponthus & they wen¦te on pylgrymages & processyons yeldynge graces to god / for euery man wende he had be deed. ¶How the erle of rychemonde toke leue of Ponthus & came in to Englonde / & tolde the kynge of the grete dedes of armes yt Ponthus had done. ON the morowe after arryued the nauy of Eng∣londe / of brytayne / & of normandy / whan they herde the treason of Guenelet they hadde moche mer∣uayll how euer he durste thynke suche falsenesse. The kynge of Brytayne receyued theym with grete Ioye. And kynge Ponthus withhelde with hym the Erle of Gloucestre / & well a .xii. knyghtes more / and sayd that within .xv. dayes he wolde go in to Englonde to se the kynge and ye quene & her doughter Genneuer / & sayd to the erle of Rychemonde recōmaunde me to theym
and yf my lady Genneuer be not wedded I shall brȳ∣ge her an husbonde / yf it please the kynge & her to ta∣ke hym. So he tolde hym in his ere yt it was his cosyn germayne Polydes the whiche was a ryghte goodly knyght & full of good condycyons & lykely to come to grete worshyppe. In good fayth sayd the erle ye saye trouth / & I can thynke the kynge wyll be ryght glad of hym & haue hym in grete chere for the grete loue he hath to you. So he conueyed hȳ as frre as he myght and after toke his leue of theym. So they departed & came in to theyr owne countre with grete Ioye. The erle of Rychemonde came to the courte and foūde the kynge & the quene and the kynge of scottes that was come to them. The kynge asked hym of the tydynges And he tolde hym of the begynnynge and endynge of all auentures. And how the countre was delyuered of the sarasynes / & how that the countre and the people hadde be saued by the Erle of desture & syr Patrycke
in suche wyse that it was well laboured & pleopled of men by ye trewage that they yelded wherby they lyued in peas. And than he tolde hym of the grete treason & falsenes of Guenelet / & afterwarde he tolde them of ye grete gyftes the good chere & grete gentylnes ye kȳge Ponthus had shewed them. And whan he had all tol∣de he called in coūseyll ye kynge & ye quene & her dough¦ter Genneuer & the kȳge of scottes / & tolde them how kynge Ponthus wolde come thyder within .xv. dayes and had withholde with hym the erle of Gloucestre / & how he had spoken to hym of ye maryage of his cosyn germayne & of Genneuer. The kynge asked what ma¦ner knyght he was & he answered yt he was the good∣lyest knyght he knewe saue onely kynge Ponthus / & I tell you sayd he that he resembleth moche of person and of condycyons / saue that he is somwhat lesse. By my fayth sayd the kynge I accorde me yf it please my doughter. And she kneled downe & sayd what it plea∣sed hym to cōmaunde her she sholde do. The quene & the kynge of scottes praysed & agreed to the maryage And ye kȳge of scottes sayd / syr it nedeth not to mary your doughter to a kynge or a lorde yt wolde not dwell in this realme for a kȳge or a grete lorde perauenture wolde not dwell in this countre / & that were not good for the people nor for the countre. And wete well that as longe as kynge Ponthus lyueth there shall be noo man so hardy to assay to greue his londe. Than sayd the kynge that he had sayd soth. Genneuer that loued so moche the kȳge Ponthus sayd in her herte that the knyght pleased her more than ony other / & enquyred of hym frome ferre of the Erle and of the knyghtes that haue ben at ye warre that haue sene hym / and the
more that she enquyreth the better she fyndeth. And the more she loueth hym. Now hath she no desyre so grete as to se hym / and she prayeth vnto god that he may come soone. ¶How kynge Ponthus made a grete feest at vennes and a grete Iustynge for to feest ye straūgers where as he wonne the pryse aboue all other. THan kynge Ponthus tourned agayne to ven∣nes whan he had conueyed the lordes of Eng¦londe and of the countrees beyonde. Soo they wente for to here masse / and after they wente to mete. And than sayd kynge Ponthus vnto all the barons of Bry¦tayne. Fayre lordes yf it pleaseth you we must se our ladyes of this countre & feest theym for the loue of the
erle of Gloucestre and of these knyghtes of Englonde the whiche must be feested / and to disporte them with some dedes of armes / for within .xv. dayes we muste go in to Englonde so se the kȳge for certayne maters I haue to speke with hym. They answered yt it sholde be done. Now quod he I charge eche of you to brynge of ye fayrest ladyes & gentylwomen of your coūtrees And eche of you shall brynge others wyfe & ye shall be here by this daye seuen nyght. So this was graunted and euery man wente to his wyfe & his frendes / and eche of them sought of the fayrest ladyes & gentylwo∣men & best syngynge and daunsynge that they myght fynde & came to vennes. And kynge Ponthus wente ayenst them & receyued them with grete Ioye of myn¦strelles & other dysportes. On the morowe after were the Iustes grete. Quene Sydoyne was on the scaffol¦des & the kynge her fader / & the grete ladyes of Bry∣tayne & the aged knyghtes. Kynge Ponthus was of the inner partye / & the erle of Gloucestre. Barnart de la roche. Gerarde de vyttry. Peers de vyttry. Roger de loges / the vycount de donges / and Endes de doul for to Iuste ayenst all comers. So the Iustes began grete & harde. Kynge ponthus bette downe knyghtes and horses. Soo euery man doubted for to mete with hym / the ladyes praysed them moche / and so dyde all maner men / grete was the feestes the Iustes and the dysportes / & lasted tyll the sonne goynge downe / there were many fayre Iustes & harde strokes that longe it were to tell. At euen they wente & sette them to souper and were serued with many dyuers seruyces. Myn∣strelles and heraldes ledde grete myrth and grete noy¦se. The pryce of the vtter syde was gyuen to the lorde
mountfort / for ryght wel & sore had Iusted / so he had the cuppe of golde. And kynge Ponthus had the pryce within and he had a chaplet that the ladyes sent hym And with that came thyder Geffrey de lesygnen and Androwe de la toure. Guyllam de roches / & Leoncel de mauleon the whiche kynge Ponthus had sente for for to go with hym in to Englonde / for ouer all knygh¦tes he loued theym best for theyr worthynes / & kynge Ponthus rose ayenst them & toke them in his armes and made them grete chere. And they sayd vnto hym that he had done euyll to ryse ayenst theym / and that he was to courteyse and to gentyll. After souper the lorde de lesygnen sayd ye haue this daye Insted with out vs. And yf it please you sayd he to kynge ponthus we foure yt be last come shall Iuste to morowe. Than sayd kynge Ponthus ye shal haue with you my cosyn Polydes & ye vycount of lyon for to be .vi. for I vnder∣stande by the vycountes wordes this day that he was wrothe bycause he was not of the inner partye / so we shall mowe at this tyme ease his herte. Than he was called & Polydes tolde them that to morowe they .vi. sholde Iuste ayenst al comers. So yt crye was made yt the whyte felowes sholde Iuste & delyuer al maner of knyghtes / & he of without that sholde haue ye pryce he sholde haue a gyrdell & a purse of the fayrest lady of the feest / & he of within yt sholde gete ye pryce he sholde kysse her / & haue of her a rȳge of golde So there were grete Iustes & many grete strokes gyuen / but who so euer Iusted well or not I lette it passe for to abredge this story. And neuertheles the pryce wtout was gyuen to Geffrey de chateau bryaunt / & the pryce of within to Polydes but some men sayd yt Geffrey de lesygnen
had wonne it. So there was therfore a grete debate. On the morowe after kȳge Ponthus toke his leue of the kynge & of Sydoyne & of the ladyes of Brytayne and than he wente to saynt Malo / & toke the see and ledde with hym .xii. of the barons of Brytayne and ye foure before sayd. So they passed ouer / for the erle of Gloucestre departed before hym a daye for to tell the kynge of Englonde that kynge Ponthus came for to se hym. The kynge vnderstode well by the erle of Ry∣chemonde that he came. So was he garnysshed and stuffed of all thynges that hym neded for to receyue hym worshypfully / with hym was the kȳge of scottes his brother / & ye kynge of Irlonde / & he of cornewayle his neuewe & the erles & the barons of his realme. So they had grete Ioy of his comynge. The kȳge prayed to them all for to make kynge Ponthus good chere & all ye worshyp that myght be done / for sayd he ye wote well all how by him this realme was releued bothe of neyghbours and of sarasynes. They sayd al that they sholde do theyr power. The kynge lepte on horsbalke and the other kynges & rode ayenst kynge Ponthus well a myle with all maner mynstrelsy they receyued hym with grete Ioye and grete worshyppe. The chere that they made hym is not for to tell for it was grete. Kynge Ponthus was rychely arayed of perles and of of precyous stones and had a cercle vpon his heed of stones and of perles. The were .xx. knyghtes with Po¦lydes & the .xvi. that I spake of before and foure hon∣dred of Galyce. ¶How Ponthus came to London wt grete noblesse where ye kynge and the quene receyued hym with gre∣te Ioye.
THese .xx. knyghtes were full rychely cladde in syglatons furred with veer all in one sute wel & rychely arayed of gyrdelles of golde & purses fayre & ryche the whiche appered vnder theyr furred man∣telles / they were moche loked vpon / & theyr ordynaū∣ces were holden for fayre & good. With grete Ioye en¦tred tho kȳge Ponthus in to London / & there he foū∣de the quene & her doughter / & the ladyes in ye coūtree abydȳge hym. So whan he sawe the quene he alyght a farre & wente rennynge to her warde / & she kyssed hym & halsed hym and was than receyued with grete worshyp· The quene asked hym how he had done syth he departed from theym / and he sayd ryght well. And Genneuer the kȳges doughter hadde alwaye her eye for to se Polydes the whiche she hadde grete desyre for to fe. So she knewe hym by the tokens and lyknes of his cosyn kynge Ponthus. And she sawe hym so gra∣cyous & so pleasaunt that she lyked hym ouer all thyn∣ges / and yet for to be the more in certayne she axed of the erle of Gloucestre / and she shewed her by sygne / & syth she sayd in her herte that he had not fayled for to chese hym / & that her herte tolde her well that it was he / they wente to mete and there were many straūge seruyces and notably serued / for the barons serued by the kynges cōmaundement. After mete they dronke and ate spyces. Genneuer had grete desyre that they sholde speke of her mater. So she sayd to the kynge of scottes laughynge. I wote neuer what shall be of the speche that the erle of Rychemonde brought. And the kynge smyled & sayd ye haue sene hym / what saye ye by hym / pleaseth he you / she wexed all reed and sayd. I shall doo as my lorde & ye wyll. So he sawe well yt
she lyked hym / he came to the kynge and sayd to hym that it was good to wete of ye mater of his nece. Than sayd ye kynge of Englonde ye saye trouth / withdrawe you in to yonder chambre. And the kynge withdrewe hym and sent for the kynge of Irlonde and the kynge of cornewayle / and for the prynces and barons of his realme. And whā they were come he tolde them how the erle of Rychemonde had spoken to hym from kyn∣ge Ponthus of the maryage of his doughter & of Po∣lydes / and he sayd vnto them. Fayre lordes ye knowe wel that I am aged & may bere no more none armes nor laboure nor trauayll for to kepe you yf nede befell. So it behoueth that our doughter were maryed to a man that were lykely to kepe you and to holde you in rest & peas / yf ye take a grete lorde or prynce perauen∣ture he wyll make his dwellynge in his owne countre so sholde ye dwell wtout gouernour / & yf ony wronge were done to ony of you or too ony of this realme he sholde be fayne to goo out of the countre to seke ryght of his request / therfore me semeth it were better for to take a yonge knyght of hyghe kynred that sholde aby∣de & dwell with you / and that wolde thynke hymselfe to be beholden to haue worshyp by his wyfe / and in so moche he sholde be the more enclyned to obey you and the realme / so I wyll tell you all the mater that hathe be spoken vnto me. Than he declared them how that kynge Ponthus had spoken to ye erle of Rychemonde of Genneuer & of his cosyn germayne the whiche men holde for a good knyght and of good condycyons. So there was moche talkȳge bothe of one & of other that longe were to tell / but the ende was that they were al accorded & sayd that they myght no better doo for the
surete & welfare of the realme / & for to be abeyed and out of trouble / and that as longe as his cosyn kynge Ponthus lyueth there shall no man be so hyrdy for to meue warre ayenst them. ¶How Polydes kynge Ponthus cosyn wedded Gen¦neuer the kynges doughter of Englonde. ANd whan the kȳge sawe that they were con∣sented he sayd to the kynge of scottes and the Erle of Rychemonde the whiche were worshyppefull knyghtes. Go sayd he to the kynge & doo hym to wete of all this mater / & saye hym that for his loue we wyll haue his cosyn. These two departed and called kynge Ponthus a syde and tolde hym ryght gracyously how the kynge and the lordes were consented for the loue and worshyp of hym to the maryage that he had spo∣ken of to the Erle of Rychemonde. Kynge Ponthus thanked the kynge and all his barons ryght mekely & sayd yt they dyde hym grete worshyp / for the whiche
god graūte hȳ grace to deserue it. And so longe wen∣te & came the kynge of scottes that he assembled them in the quenes chambred. And there came the archebys¦shop of Caūtorbury the whiche fyaunced theym It is not to aske yf Genneuer hadde grete Ioye in her her∣te all thoughe she made tho symple for she loued and praysed hym moche the more for the good name that men gaue hym / and also for the loue of his cosyn the whiche that she loued so moche before tyme. And also Polydes thanked god hyghly in his herte that he had sente him so grete a worshyp in this worlde / and to ha¦ue so fayre a lady and of so goodly behauynge. So the daye of weddynge was sette ye eyght daye after. Gre∣te were the feestes and grete were the Iustes y• whi∣che began the morowe after the day of maryayge for kynge Ponthus wolde not accorde that there sholde be done dedes of armes the day of the maryage. And that he sayd for the kȳge of bourgoyne ye whiche dyed the day of his maryage. For to tel of the well Iusters it were to longe to tell / but ouer all kynge Ponthus Iusted best / for he was without pere. Ryght well Iu∣sted Polydes & the kynge of Ironde / and the lorde de lesygnen / & the lorde de la toure / & the lorde Moūfort of brytayne / these had the voyse of al well Iusters. It were to longe to tell / so I passe lyghtly / it were a gre∣te thynge to tell of the grete feest and of the grete ordy¦naunces of the seruyces of the vowes and of the pry∣ces that were gyuen & of all dysportes. The feest du∣red from the mondaye to the frydaye. ¶How kynge Ponthus departed from Englonde.
AFter mete kynge Ponthus toke his leue of ye kynge and of the quene / but with grete payne they gaue hym leue. Genneuer conueyed hym well a two myle / & they had moche goodly talkynge togyder & she sayd vnto him that she loued her lorde Ponthus moche the more bycause she had loued hym couertly / and that she praysed hym the more that he had kepte truly his fyrst loue. Kynge Ponthus smyled and sayd that there was noo wyle but that women knewe and thought. Soo they spake ynoughe of dyuers thynges & than he made her to tourne agayne with grete pay∣ne & sayd vnto her. My lady and my loue I am your knyght and shall be as longe as I lyue / so ye may cō∣maunde me what it pleaseth you / & I shall fulfyll it to my power / & than he sayd afore Polydes my fayre lady & my loue I wyll that my cosyn here loue you & obey you / & that he haue no pleasaunce to none so mo¦che as vnto you / & yf there be ony defaute do it me to wete & I shall correcte hym. Syr sayd she he shall do as a good man ought to doo. God graunte it sayd he. So he toke his leue & departed. The kynge of scottes and the kynge of Irlonde & the kynge of cornewayle they wolde haue conueyed hym vnto the porte / but he wolde not suffre them. There was grete heuynes and courtesye bytwene them at theyr departynge / & after they toke theyr leue of hym & retourned agayne to the kynges hous. And kynge Ponthus came to the porte & called to hym his cosyn Polydes asyde & sayd vnto hym / thanked be god ye ought grete guerdon to god / for ye are in the waye for to be a ryght grete kynge & a myghty of armes & of haueour & of noble lordshyp∣pes / soo ye ought for to thanke god hyghly. And ther∣fore
it behoueth you for to haue foure thynges yf that ye wyll reioyce in peas and peasybly. THe fyrst is that ye be a very true man / that is to wete loue god with all your herte & drede to dysobey hym yf ye loue hym he shall helpe & susteyne you in all your nedes / loue & worshyp holy chyrche & all the cōmaundementes / this is the fyrst seruyce that men sholde yelde to god. ¶The secōde is this that ye sholde bere worshyp and seruyce vnto them that ye be comen of / & to them of whome ye haue and may haue rychesse & worshyp / that is to saye loue and serue ye fa∣der of your wyfe / wherof moche worshyp & seruyce to them that ye be comen of / be to hym a very ryght sone kepe you that ye angre hym not / suffre & endure what langage or wordes that shall be sayd vnto you / or of what tales that shall be reported to you / some for to pleale you / & some by flatery or elles for malyce couert of suche men as wolde not the peas bytwene you and hym / for fayre cosyn he that well suffreth of his better & of his greter he ouercomoth hym. It is a grete gra∣ce of god & of ye worlde towarde hymselfe to haue suf∣fraunce for dyuers reasons the whiche sholde be vnto longe to tell. ¶The thyrde reason is for to be meke / gentyll amyable / large and free / after your power to your barons & to your knyghtes & squyers of whome that ye shall & may haue nede / & yf ye may not shewe them fredome & largesse of your good at the leest be to theym courteys & debonayre bothe to grete and to ly∣tell / for bothe be good / the grete shall loue you & the ly∣tell shall prayse you ouer all of your good chere and so he shall auayll you a ryght heralde soo moche ye shall
be praysed ouer all. And also it is to vnderstande that ye shall be so more to your wyfe than to ony other for dyuers reasons / for by worshyp & courteys berynge to her ye shal holde the loue of her bounde vnto you and for to be dyuers & rude to her she myght haply chaun∣ge / and ye loue wherof ye sholde reioyse she myght gy∣ue it to another / where as me myght take suche a plea¦saunce wherof that ye sholde be ryghte sory / and that sholde ye not withdrawe whan ye wolde. So is there grete peryll and grete maystry to kepe the loue of ma∣ryage / & also beware that ye kepe your felfe true vnto her as it is sayd in the gospell that ye sholde chaunge her for none other / & yf ye doo thus as I saye you god shall encrease you in all welth & in worshyppe / yf ye se her angry appease her agayne by fayrenes / and whā she cometh agayne to herselfe she shal loue you moche the more / for there is no courtesye but that is yolde / & whan an herte is fell and angry & men wrath it more it ymagyneth thynges wherof many harmes may be fall. ¶The fourth reason is that ye sholde be pyteous of the poore the whiche that shall requyre ryght of the ryche or of ye myghty that wolde greue them / for ther∣to be ye sette and ordeyned / & all tho that haue grete lordshyppes / for ye came in to the worlde as poore as they dyde / & as poore shall ye be the daye of your deth and ye shall haue no more of all erthe saue onely your length as the poore people shall haue / and ye shall be bylefte in the erthe allone without ony felawshyp as the poore people shall be / and therfore shall ye haue noo lordshyp but for to holde ryght wysynesse without blemysshynge or doubte of ony mayster or represe / neyther for loue nor for hate / for thus god cōmaūdeth
her euery fryday in especyall the clamour of the poore people and of women wydowes / put not theyr good ryght in respyte nor in delacion / nor byleue not alway your offycers of euery thynge that they shall tell you. Enquere before the trouth / for some of theym wyll do it for to purchace domage vnto the symple people for hate / and some for couetyse to haue theyr good whan they se they may not do with hym what they wyll / soo they came with false reportes. It is a peryllous thyn∣ge of a grete lorde to be lyght of byleue. What shall I tell you / he taught & shewed hȳ many examples. And tho Polydes thanked hym & sayd vnto hym. Syr I knowe wel that ye loue me & of your goodnes ye haue purchased me the welfare & the worshyp that I haue & therfore I praye you that euery yere we may mete and se vs togyder / for that shall be my comforte & all my sustynaunce. I graunte it sayd kynge Ponthus. And after whan they had spoken and talked of many thynges they toke theyr leue eche of theym of other & halsed and kyssed togyder / & none of them had power to speke one worde that one to that other / for meruay¦lously they loued well togyder. And whan that kynge Ponthus had his herte somwhat clered yt he myghte speke / he toke his leue of the lordes of Englonde and offred hymselfe moche vnto them. And Polydes tour∣ned agayne to the kynges hous where as men made hym ryghte grete Ioye. Polydes withhelde well the good doctryne of his cosyn for he serued & obeyed the kynge & the quene / and made hymselfe to be byloued bothe of the grete and of the lytell by his largesse & by his courtesye. Ryght well he loued god & holy chyrche and was pyteous & charytable vnto the poore people
The kynge & the quene loued hym as theyr owne chyl¦de / and aboute a seuen yere after ye kynge dyed / & thā was Polydes crowned kynge of Englonde peasybly And ryght good loue was bytwene them & his wyfe & the olde quene / & soo he reygned in good peas & grete Ioye. So here I leue to speke of Polydes & retourne agayne vnto kynge Ponthus. ¶How the kynge Ponthus arryued in Brytayne. HEre doth kynge Ponthus sayle so longe on the see tyl he & his barons were londed in brytayne And than they wente vnto the kynges hous where as they were receyued with grete Ioye of all maner of people. And whan they hadde soiourned well a seuen dayes Geffrey de lesygnen / & Androwe de la toure / & the straūgers toke theyr leue & departed. And kynge Ponthus gaue them many grete gyftes / & ryche pre∣sentes & thanked them & whelde them as his felowes and his frendes / & than he conueyed them a two myle whether they wolde or not / and there they toke theyr leue eche of theym of other. The kynge of brytayne ne lyued but aboute a thre yere after / for he was ryghte aged. And than was kynge Ponthus crowned kȳge of Brytayne / & was ryght well byloued of the nobles & of all maner of people / he was ryght good & ryght full of Iustyce charytable and pyteuous on the poore. Ryght well they loued togyder he and the quene his wyfe & ledde a ryght good & an holy lyfe & dyde many almesse dedes. And whan the housholde remeued fro one place to another / he dyde crye that all they that he ought ony good vnto / were it for his housholde or for ony other thynge yt were taken for hym / that they sholde come to hym or to his offycers / and all he dyde
paye / for he sayd that they were foles that abyde to theyr heyres or to theyr executours / for fewe were con¦tented / & also they that helde the good from the poore people sholde haue therof full lytell meryte. He vsed & ledde a ryght good & an holy lyfe. So than they wen∣te & dwelled a yere in Galyce where as they were well byloued / dredde & doubted & worshypped. The erle of desture thanked moche the kynge his neuewe for the grete worshyp that he had done to his sone. The kȳge gaue grete londes & herytages to syr Patrycke that had saued hym in the shyppe / and he that had done so moche good to the countre. Ryght grete reuerence and worshyppe bere quene Sydoyne vnto the olde quene her lordes moder. The kynge sente for his vncle ye kȳ∣ge of Aragoon and for lordes and barons of the coun∣trees aboute / and made grete Iustes that dured well a ten dayes. ¶How Ponthus & Sydoyne came to saynt Iames. ANd after they all and the quene wente on pyl¦grymage to saynt Iames in galyce And after his ertournynge agayne they dwelled not longe that they wente to warres in to spayne ayenst ye sarasyns and he ledde wt hym the barons of Brytayne / of anioy of mayne / of poytow / of tourayne / & of Normandye. Of the normans he ledde the erle of mortayne / the vy¦counte of auerenches. Tesson / paynel / & many other knyghtes. Of mayne hongres de beaumount / & Guy de la vale / and dyuers other of anioy. Pyers de donne. Androwe de la toure. Guyllam de roches / the lorde of Nermount. Iohan de poytow / the lorde de lesygnen. Guy touars. leoncel de manleon / hongres de partenei Of Tourayne Hubert de mayllye. Hondes de Bassye
patrycke damboyse / & many of theym of brytayne / & of goscoyne / they were well a .xv.M. & dyscomfyted ye hethen folke / & there dyde many grete dedes of armes and toke many townes and castelles / and than in the wynter euery man wente home in to his countre / and euery man gaue grete loos and pryce to kynge Pon∣thus. For he payed them well of theyr wages and ga∣ue them gretes gyftes / in so moche that they sayd the∣re was no ryght chyefteyne but he / & yt he was lykely to conquere all maner of countrees by his knyghthode largenes & courtesy / for all maner of good cōdycyons ben in hym after the rule of god & the worlde / & in hȳ is all goodlynes / for he oweth grete guerdon to god. He dwelled a lytel whyle after in galyce / & than came agayne in to brytayne / & than he wente & sawe his co∣syn whiche was crowned kynge of Englonde where as he was receyued with grete Ioye. It is not to aske yf the quene Genneuer set grete payne to feest hym / & make hym grete chere. After that wente the kynge of Englonde in to Gascoyne & in to galyce to se his fader and his kynnesmen / & gaue theym grete gyftes. And than he tourned agayne in to Brytayne where as he was moche made of & had grete chere. And after that he wente agayne in to his owne realme. Kynge Pon∣thus & ye quene reygned longe ynoughe· And lyued to the pleasure of god. And than they dycessed & fynys∣shed to ye grete heuynes & sorowe of theyr people. But thus it is of the worldly lyfe for there is none so fayre nor so ryche so stronge nor soo goodly but at the laste he must nedes leue this worlde. Deo gratias.
¶Here endeth the noble hystory of the moost excellent and myghty prynce & hygh renowmed knyght kynge Ponthus of Galyce & of lytell Brytayne. Enprynted at London in Fletestrete at the sygne of the sonne by Wynkyn de Worde. In the yere of our lorde god. M.CCCCC.xi.
