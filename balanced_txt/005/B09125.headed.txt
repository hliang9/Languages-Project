AN EPITAPH. On the Worst, and most Wicked of all Mankind, C. I. Who Dyed on the 6th. of June. 1681. THE veriest Villain e're was born, The Goodmans great Contempt and Scorn Lies here Inter'd, if BELZEBÆ²B Ha'nt Pickled him in's Powdring-Tub. His Name was Kit, a Rogue (to tell The Truth) worse than ACHITOPHEL: His Birth was base, and what more odd is, His Dad a Maker was of Boddice; Or as some Learned Men will have it, Th' Evidence of an Affidavit. Nor did his Son Degenerate, Who was far worse, I know not what: A Pimp well known to every Harlot; A Pettifogging Paultry Varlet; A Rogue in Grain, though not in Scarlet, Since he ne'er had the Grace to blush at Those Crimes he only made a push at. He was a Knave made up of strife, A Mischief-maker all his Life; An Hand-Granada, to Enflame And scatter Coals where e're he came. But mark! Those Coals this busie Elfe Scatter'd abroad, consum'd himself To Cinders, who Dyed, which you please, Of the POX, or Foul Disease. Yet were the Fates in one thing kind, In striking him before-hand Blind, That he might not behold, or view That Shame his Sins had brought him to. This (Reader,) in great haste I writ, That thou at leasure may'st Learn Wit, And warning take by Cursed Kit. London, Printed by G. L. for the Author. 1681.
