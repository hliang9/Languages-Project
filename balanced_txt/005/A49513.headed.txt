Advertisements touching the use and purpose of this Booke, to my People. 1. THere be two parts of a Ministers office that undertakes the instru∣ction of Gods people: the one to deliver suf∣ficient matter of distinct knowledge unto Christian faith: The other, to lay downe, and diligently to in∣culcate Principles of sanctification, whereby a Christian may be dire∣cted in point of duty and holy life, & enabled to discerne between the state of Nature and the state of Grace. Both these I have endeavou∣red; the former, by drawing out the
generall heads of Christian doctrine into particulars: the latter, by lay∣ing down trials, and principles of sanctification and holy practice. 2. I intend this Booke for the in∣struction of those that are to be ad∣mitted to the Lords Supper, where∣in they shall be publikely exercised three years: the two former years to be hearers, and the last yeare to be answerers in it. In which time it is hoped, that the meanest capacity will be able to attain the sense, & un∣derstanding of the matter. And whē they have been thus diligently in∣structed, & the Congregation satisfi∣ed of their competent knowledge in the doctrine of Christ; then upon a day appointed for their admission to the Lords Supper, the said Catech∣umenes (upon their own motion & desire to be admitted) shall make professiō of their faith & repentāce Ezek. 20.37. & in their own names,
& with their own mouthes under∣take that Covenant of Faith, & obe∣dience unto Christ, which at Bap∣tisme we all entred into, and stand bound to performe. 3. I have prepared a severall chapter for every week of the year, and endeavoured to make the an∣swers as weighty and perspicuous as I could, both which, as I conceive will be more delightfull and profi∣table to the learner. To every an∣swer I cause thē to read the proofes, one or more, as the time and matter requires; within three quarters of an hour each Chapter will be dis∣patched: if any thing be more light∣ly passed over one time, it may be more largely insisted on the next. 4. The number and length of questions, will not be burthen some to thē that be long exercised there∣in. The answers themselves are not long, if you observe that they end
where this marke [beginneth, and that all that is included within this marke [] is added for explication, and not to lode the memory. And if you expresse the sense of the answer in other words of your owne, the answer will be the better accepted. 5. There is some repetition of the same matter in the doctrine or justi∣fication by faith, the Offices of Christ, the difference betwixt the Law & the Gospel, which was not an oversight, but of purpose, the bet∣ter to root those main points in weak understandings. 6. This training up of our Chil∣dren and Servants in a forme of wholsome words, will, I hope, through Gods blessing, be a meanes to prevent that grosse ignorance in them, which now reignes in aged people. The like fruit may be hoped in the free Grammer Schoole. The Lord grant you to grow in grace, &
in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, that both he that soweth and he reapeth, may rejoyce together; and when we shall be parted by death, may have a joy∣full and happy meeting in Hea∣ven, and be united to our blessed and glorious head for evermore. AMEN.

CAP. I. Of the state of Man by Creation; and of the Covenant of Nature. WHat should be the first and great care of every man in this World? Ans. To (a) know God betimes; to serve him aright; and to (b) provide for the eternall salvation of our poore soules. (a) Eccl. 12.1. 1 Chron 28.9. (b) Luc. 10.42. John 6.27. Esa. 55.2. 1 Tim. 6.18, 19. Q. What is mans chiefest happinesse in this world? A. It is to enjoy God by faith, to walk with him, to know our selves to be in his favour here, and that we shall for ever live with him after death. [Without this we are as miserable as the Beasts] Gen. 15. 1. Lam. 3.24. Eccl. 2.1, 11, 13. No earthly thing can make one happy Jer. 9.23, 24.
Eccl. 12.13. Math. 16 26. 1 Cor. 15.19. Eph. 2.12. Q. How shall a man attain to this true Happinesse? A. Only by the Scriptures, which are able to make us wise to Salvation. Ioh. 5.39, 46. Luke 16.29, 31, Iohn 14.6. 2 Tim. 3.15. Q. How are we assured that the Scri∣pture is Gods-Word? A. Not onely by the Testimony of the Church, which cannot universally de∣ceive, but especially by the Testimony of the Spirit, working strange and superna∣turall effects in us by the Word, giving us such joy, contentment, and satisfaction touching spirituall and eternall things, by way of tast and feeling, as is not pos∣sible for humane reason to doe: Ioh. 4.42. Ioh. 6.68, 69. 1 Thes. 1.5. 2 Pet. 1.18, 21. 2. Cor. 4.6. Foure heads of Christian doctrine.Q. What be those Parts or heads of Christian Doctrine delivered in Scri∣pture, the knowledge whereof maketh us happy? A. There be foure generall heads of it.  1. The Doctrine of mans creation, and state of innocency  2ly. Of the fall and mise∣ry of man.  3ly. Of mans deliverance and
redemption by Jesus Christ, and of the means to partake of Christ. 4. How the redeemed ought to live. [These Truthes bring us to Humiliation, Justification and Sanctification.] Act. 20.20. Q. God in the beginning created A∣dam and Eve; in what state did he make them at first? A. God made them upright after his own likenesse,Of the state of Man by Creation. i.e. in an holy and happy estate, free from sin and misery. Gen. 1.27. Col. 3.10. Eccles. 7.29. Q. Wherein consisted the Image of God, in which man was created? A. It stood in two things: First, in that Dominion, Honour and Excellency which Adam had over the creatures. Gen. 1.26. Gen. 2.20. Gen. 9.6. [This was ex∣ternall.] Joh. 10.34. God is the great King and Lord of all things, and all in Authority doe beare his Image. 1 Cor. 11.7. Rom. 13.4. Q. Wherein chiefely did that Image of God consist? A. In Holinesse and Righteousnesse, wherein man was like unto God himselfe, their whole soules and bodies being fil∣led with the fulnesse of Grace. Eph. 4.24. Col. 3.10.
Q. If Adam had not sinned, should he have died? A. No: For death came in by sinne, as the wages of it. Rom. 5.12. Gen. 2.17. Q. Also if he had continued upwright he should have been saved without the help of a Mediatour? Of the first Covenant made with Adam.A. It is true; for so God Covenanted with him, and in token thereof Gave him to eat of the tree of Life. Gen. 2.9, 16. Gen. 3.22, 24. Rev. 2.7. Q. Declare more plainly the Cove∣nant made with Adam before he fell. A. It was a Covenant of Workes, wherein life was promised, upon condition of his continuing without sin in perfect obedience. Rom. 10.5. Gal. 3.12. Rev. 22.14. Doe this and live. Q. But could Adam at that time have been saved by his own inherent righteous∣nesse? was he able to keepe that Cove∣nant? A. Yes: For Adam was the Sonne of God, perfect in holinesse & righteous∣nesse, and Heire of Heaven, even as the holy Angels are. Luk 3.38. Gen. 1.27, 31. Adam had a whole will no ignorance, no corruption to strive against the Spirit. Q. Can any man, since the fall, be saved by that Covenant?
A. No: Because all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, and therefore must look for salvation by an∣other, that is, by Christ Jesus. Rom. 3.22, 23. Rom. 8.3. Heb. 8.8. Gal. 3.10. Q. Must any be judged, that is, stand or fall by that Covenant of Workes? A. Yes, all unregenerate persons; all that be out of Christ, be under the Law, and must answer for themselves: for all the world, by the Law of their creation, are bound to be holy and perfect, as God made them at first, and must be judged ac∣cording to that Covenant, unlesse they come to be in Christ. Gal. 4.5. Rom. 3.9.19. Joh. 16.9. Rom. 2.12. Eph. 2.12. Q. Then all that have not Christ be in an ill case. A. They be so; they have nothing to plead for themselves before the judge∣ment seat of God, [nothing to stand be∣tween the justice of God and their sins.] Eph. 2.12. Acts 17.30.
CAP. II. Of the fall of man, and his sinfull state. Second head of Christian doctrine.Q. HOw came sin into the World, seeing God made man upright? A. By the first sinne of Adam and Eve, who being deceived by the Serpent, did eat of the forbidden fruit. 2 Cor. 11.3. Gen. 3.3, 4. Rom. 5.12, 19. Q. How did sin come upon all by that one mans sin? A. Two manner of waies. First, by im∣putation, the Lord in justice imputing the guilt of that first sinne to all his posterity. Rom. 5.14, 15, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 15.22. By one mans disobedience many were made sin∣ners: as soone as he sinned that first Cove∣nant was broken, and the state of Adam and all mankind in him, was changed in∣to a state of sin, and misery. [In Adam all die, (i) the sentence of death was passed on all in Adam, when as yet there were no more men in the World. 1 Cor. 15.45, 47. There were two head men by whom all fall and rise: Adam was the head of the Covenant of Nature, if he had stood, none of us had fallen: And so Christ is the head of the Covenant of Grace, if he were not
risen, we cānot rise; we rise or fall with him, vers. 16, 17. As the Righteousnesse of Christ is imputed to them that be of Christ by spirituall regeneration. (Esay 53.10.) So is the sinne of Adam imputed to all that come of him by naturall generation; For as all the Elect are justified first in Christ their Head, as in a common person & sure∣ty, when he rose againe from death, and thereby received as it were Gods acquit∣tance in full discharge of our debts. 1 Tim. 3.16. And 2ly, the are justified in their own Persons when as they come by Faith actually to be members of Christ: In like manner all mankind was condemned in Adam, as a common person representing all mankind, and as a radicall person contain∣ing all that Nature which was to be deri∣ved to all generations of men, Act. 17.26. Every one of us would have done as A∣dam did, if we had been in his place. And we are in our own Persōs liable to that sen∣tence of death, so soon as we exsist, and have our sowre, sinfull being from that poysoned root. Q. But doth it stand with the justice of God to impute unto us Adams sinne? A. Yes; because Adam was the head and root of all mankind; we were in his loyns
when we sinned, we were part of Adam in him, and of him. As the Children of bondmen are bondmen, the Children of a Traitor are tainted in blood, till they be restored in bloud; so it was with us; our Father became a slave, sold under sinne, and such are we his children, till Christ make us free: Adams sinne was the sinne of mankind, he stained and corrupted our Nature Rom. 5.12. Hos. 2.2. If adulterous Brats complaine why they are cast out, the Lord bids them plead with their mo∣ther; so we must plead with Adam: This is just in our Law. Q. How secondly, did sin enter upon all by that one sin? A. By propagation; the lump and root of mankind being corrupted, so are the branches. Rom. 11.16. Gen. 5.3. Job. 14 4. [with our nature Adam propagated sin and corruption] God made Angels all at once, and therefore the fall of some of them did not draw all into the same con∣demnation: But God made all mankind in one man to be multiplied by generation, and so that root dying and being poyso∣ned, all that come of him are likewise dead & poysoned. We were in Adam two manner of waies. 1. Legally, as Parties con∣tracting
with God in that first Covenant, and so were to stand or fall with our Head. 2. Naturally, we were in his loynes, so that whatsoever befell the humane Na∣ture, it is Common to us; of which nature we are a part: All the seed of man was in Adam, and therefore all that seed being corrupted in Adam, we that come of him must needs be corrupted also: we are a ge∣neration of vipers, Mat. 3.7. a seed of evill doers. Es. 1.4. and young Serpents are worthy to dye, because of their kind, and the poyson somnesse that is in them. Who can bring a cleane thing out of an un∣clean? Job. 14.4. Q. What then is the state of every one that is borne into the world? A. Very miserable, & in no wise to be rested in, if ever we meane to be happy, Eph. 4.18. Q. Why so? A. By reason of sin and wrath, where∣unto from the birth we are all subjected. [That which is of nature, is common to the whole kind, if thou be a man it is so with thee.] Eph 2.3. Q. How long does a man continue in that sinfull and cursed estate? A. Untill he be regenerate and borne
againe, and made a member of Christ. Joh 3.3. Q. What is there in sinne that makes one thus miserable? A. Two things. First, the stain of sin. 2ly. The guilt of sinne. [The one makes us ugly creatures,1. Sinne it selfe. the other accursed.] Q. What mean you by the stain of sin? A. It is that filthinesse whereby the pre∣tious soule, being turned from God, is de∣filed and become uncleane. Math. 15.20. 2 Cor. 7.1.1. Jam. 1 21. Every sin leaves a spot upon the soule, even those sinnes which men think they get credit by; as the Pox or Leprosy doth upon the body] therefore sinners are compared to Vipers, to Dogs, and Swine, &c. Q. Is it such a matter to be a sinner, if there were no punishment to follow? A. Yes; for two reasons. 1. Because the wretched soule hath lost his excellen∣cy, being deprived of the favour of God, and of supernaturall Graces,Reason is mans excel∣lency and Grace a Christians which is the greatest losse of all. [When the soule is become a filthy stye, then God departs. It's worse to be a theese or a mad-man, then to be in prison; to be Nebuchadnez∣zar amōgst beasts, then Daniel in the lions den; the privation of supernaturall good,
is a supernaturall misery.] Esa. 64.6. Levit. 26.30. Q. Why Secondly? A. Because the sinner can doe nothing that is pleasing to God; the best things he doth, God abhors them all. Esa. 1.10, 15. Hag. 2.13, 14 Rom. 8.8. Esay. 66.3. Prov. 15.8. Tit. 1.15. [Every thing is marred & and defiled by them, being dead in sins.] Q. What is the guilt of sin? A. It is that quality in sin,2. Guilt and punish∣ment f sin. by which we are bound over to answer Gods justice, for offēding his Law. [Though the act of murther or theft be past, yet the offender is liable to justice twenty or thirty yeares after; so doth sin, it lies at the dore, it calls for vengeance, as for its wages, &c.] Gen. 3.9, 10. Iam. 1.15. Gen. 18.20. Every sinner is a vile and filthy person: But that is not all; He is also a guilty person, under the curse and wrath of God. Gal. 3.10. Q. What be the punishments every sin makes one liable unto? A. They be three. 1. The sinner is in bondage, and subject unto wrath and feare all his life long: [Cursed in his basket and store; all the sorrowes of this life are parts and steps to the greater death; his sins are
treasured up.] Ps. 7.11. Joh. 3.36. Joh. 27.7, 14. Job. 15.20, 21. Job. 20.5, 11, 14. Heb 2.15. Deut. 28.15, 16, 17. Mal. 2.2. Zach. 5.2. Rom. 2.5. Q. What 2ly? A. At his death he is stript off all his comforts, & the wretched soule is brought naked and singly to the barre of Gods ju∣stice: [The sinner while he lived and flou∣rished, was deceived and befooled; now death unbefooles thee, and makes thee see what a foole thou wert.] Heb. 9.27. Q. What lastly is the punishment and misery that sin brings? A. After death to be tormented with the Devill and his Angels, for evermore, Rev. 21.8. 2 Thes. 1.9, 10. 1 Pet. 3.19. [This is the wofulnesse of a sinner once come to his place, and this misery is everlasting, unabatable, &c.] 1 Thes. 1.10. hath de∣livered us from wrath to come. CAP. Of the kinds and degrees of sin. WHat is sin? A. It is any transgression or swerving from Gods holy Law and will; it is any declining from that Holinesse
and uprightnesse wherein God at first did make man. Rom. 4.15. 1 Joh. 3.4. Sin is either Originall, or Actuall Q. What is originall, or birth-sin?Of Origi∣nall sin. A. It is that hereditary corruption of our nature, wherewith, through the dis∣obedience of Adam, all his posterity,August. Confes. Art. 2. (na∣turally descending from him) are infe∣cted, and are subject to the wrath of God, and to the power of sin, being void of all righteousnesse, untoward and unable to doe any thing that is truly good, and prone to all manner of evill. Or thus; Originall sin is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man, that natu∣rally is engendred of the of-spring of Adam, whereby man is very faire from originall righteousnesse, and is incli∣ned to evill; and therefore in every per∣son, born into the World, it deserveth, Gods wrath and damnation. Rom 5.12,16. Rom. 3.23. See 39. Art. of Ch. of Engl. Art. 9. By that first sinne, our first parents fell from their originall righteousnesse, and so became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of their soule
and body, and were the objects of Gods wrath Now those sad effects of Adams first sin, did not rest and stay in their own per∣sons onely, but are conveyed to all their posterity, so that from the birth we are de∣filed with sin, void of goodnesse, prone to evill, and deserve Gods wrath. And this pravity and nautinesse of our corrupt Nature, because we bring it into the World with us, is called Originall sin: See this opened in the severall Branches. Q. 1. Are all that be borne into the World, guilty of sin, and subject to Gods wrath? A. Yes, by reason of Adams fall, in whom, and with whom we all sinned 1 Cor. 15.22, 49. Rom. 5. 12. 14, 15, 16. Q. 2. Are all likewise, from the birth, corrupted and defiled in their soules & bo∣dies? A. Yes; we are all as an unclean thing Ephes. 2.1, 2, 3. Psal. 51.5. Job 14.14. Rom. 7.24. Q. 3. Are we all borne into the world void of all goodnesse. A. Yes; and till we be regenerated, we cannot doe any thing that's truly good. [Being meere morall and naturall men.] Rom. 7.18, 23, 24. John. 3.6. Eph. 4.18. Math. 7.17.
Q. 4. Is this the condition of all that come of Adam? A. Yes, of all, except Christ; and Christ is excepted, because he was conceived by the Holy Ghost. Luk. 1.35. Q. 5. Why is this guilt and corruption called hereditary. A. Because we have it by nature, before we know how to doe good or evill. Esa. 1.14. Math. 3.7. and not by imitation. Q. You see what Originall sin is: What is Actuall sinne? A. It is any thought, word,Actuall sinne. or deed in our own persons against any part of Gods Law, together with any evill motion of our hearts, before or after the consent of our will. Rom. 7.19. Jam. 1.14. Actuall sinnes be either of Omission, or, Commission. Q. What is a sinne of Omission. A. It is, to leave undone any duty which we are bound unto, by Gods word; or when we faile in the manner of doing the same. Mat, 25.35, 40. 2 Cron, 30.18. 1 Cron. 15.13. Esa. 1.15. Esa. 58 3. We must take heed how we heare, Lu. 8.18. How we pray, Jam. 4 3. How we receive the Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11.28. How we give Almes, Mat. 6.8
Q. What's the danger of sinnes of Omission? A. The servant that doth not his Ma∣sters will, shall be beaten. Besides, sins of Omission make way for sins of Commi∣ssion, they harden and estrange the heart frō God. Luk. 12.48. Jam. 4.17. Mal. 1.8. Q. What is sin of Commission? A. It is, to doe any thing which we should not doe. [To doe contrary to that which is commanded or forbidden.] 1 Tim. 1.9, 10. Levit. 26.23. Ezek. 18.24. Again, sins be either of Ignorance, or Knowledge. Q. What is sin of Ignorance? A. When a body doth evill and knowes it not. 1 Tim. 1.13. Gen. 20.6. John. 16.2. Acts 3.17. Q. Is that a sin? A. Yes: (a) ignorance is it selfe a sin, it is a (b) cause of other sins; (c) and sins committed through ignorance are not thereby excusable. (a) Hos. 4.1, 14. 2 Thes. 1.8. Luk. 12.48. (b) Eph. 4.18 Jer. 5.4. Psal. 14.4. (c) Psal. 19.12. 2 Pet. 3.5. Luk. 23.34. Levit. 5.17, 18. Q. What is sin against Knowledge? A. It is, when we goe against our owne
knowledge in any thing: when we know to doe well, and doe it not. Rom. 1.18, 21, 23, 32. Rom. 2.21. 1 Kings 15.5. Luk. 12.47. Jam. 4.17. Jer. 44.16, 17. Q. What's the danger of sinning a∣gainst knowledge? A. God usually gives up such persons to impenitency, hardnesse of heart, and to a reprobate sense. Rom. 1.21, 24. a Ten∣der Conscience is a sweet Blessing. CAP. IV. Of the differences and degrees of sin. A Gain; sins be either Voluntary, or Against ones will. Q. What is voluntary sin? A. When we sin of our own accord, (i.e.) when sin proceeds from the disposition and inclination of our hearts, without force of temptation, Heb. 10.26. Joh. 8.44. he sinneth of his own. Rom. 6.12. Q. What is sin involuntary, or against ones will? A. When contrary to the bent and dis∣position of our hearts, we be overtaken unadvisedly, or through force of tempta∣tion? [and when there is no liking or al∣lowance of the evill which we fall into.]
Rom. 7.15, 16, 19. Luk. 22.33, 57. Q. What is a sin of infirmity? A. When we be overtaken in some s contrary to our desires, purpose, and en¦deavours. Gal. 5.17. John. 13 37. Rom. 7 21, 22, 23. Q. What say you of smaller sins, an sinnes to which we are enclined by natur or custome; and sinnes into which men fa suddenly; Are they to be accounted sin of infirmity? A. No, unlesse we can say, that the de∣sire, bent, and purpose of our hearts is a∣gainst them, the least and suddenest di∣stempers and failings, are reigning sins if they spring from a root within us, or b excused, defended, and made light of Rom. 8.4. Rom. 6.16. 1 Sam. 15.21. Q. What is a sin of presumption? A. When a man will venture to doe e¦vill, upon a conceit that he shall repen and doe well anough for all that. Num▪ 15.27, 31. Deut. 29 19. Q. What is reigning sin? A. Sin reigns when corruption remain in us unmortified, and there is not whithi us a principle of Grace set up against it. [S that the evill proceeds from an habit an dispositiō of the soule, where sin reigneth
Sinne may perhaps be outwardly resisted and restrained: as by lawes of men, shame, &c. But where sin doth not reigne, there it is resisted by a contrary principle of Life and Grace, which striveth against the flesh, Gal. 5.17. as when one streame is re∣sisted by another.] Rom. 6.12, 14. 1 Joh. 3.10. Rom. 8.2. Q. How may we judge of a reigning sinne? A. Two waies. 1. Not by the grossenesse or smalnesse of it: nor yet by mens vio∣lence in sinning: but by the power and sway it hath in us, overbearing all motions and commands of the Word that crosse it. [When we are led by any lust, or can plead for it, that is a raigning sin.] 2 Pet. 2.19. Rom. 8.6, 13, 14. Luk. 16.10, 13. Q. What 2ly is a signe that sin reignes in a Man? A. When sin is not a burthen to thee; when thou art unwilling to heare of it, or to be discovered and reproved, that is a signe that sin reignes in thee, Mat, 14, 3, 4. 1 King. 21.20. Againe sin is either against the Law, or Gospell. Q. What is sin against the law? A. Any breach of any one of the ten
Commandments. Rom. 2.12, 14. Rom. 1.28, 29. Q When doe men sinne against the Gospell. A. As many as reject and disobey the Go∣spel calling them to repent, & to believe in Jesus Christ for salvation, they sin a∣gainst the Gospell; and so doe all that make bold to sin, because there is mercy in Christ, and also all that slight and despise the means of Grace. Act. 7.51. 1 Joh. 3.23. Luk. 7.30. Act. 13.46. Q. Infidelity then, & Impenitency, be sins against the Gospell; What is the danger thereof? A. Such persons must of necessity pe∣rish, there being no help left for a man that rejects Christ: [they sin against the remedy.] Iohn. 3.18. Luk 13.3. Iohn. 16.9. Ioh. 8.24. Mar. 16.15, 16. Heb. 10.26.27. Q. What is the sinne against the Holy Ghost? A. It is a [totall] renouncing of Christ, after some knowledge and taste of the good word of life. Heb. 6.4 6. Heb. 10.28, 29. Mar. 3.28, 30. [Ignorant persons, nor unbelievers, nor backsliders, return∣ing unto God, doe not sinne against the Holy Ghost.]
Q. Why is this sin never to be forgiven? A. Because they think basely of Christ, and have no mind to returne by repen∣tance, [they give the lye to the Spirit; as if Christs bloud were no more to be ac∣counted of then common bloud, and not able to save.] Heb. 10.29. Q. Is any, the least sin, veniall in its own nature? A. No; all sinnes, even the least, be in their owne nature damnable, and will damne us, if we repent not of them. Rom. 6.23. Heb. 2.2. Mat. 12.36. CAP. V. How to convince men that they be under sin, and under the curse. SEeing all unregenerate persons be thus wretched; how is it, that the most nei∣ther feele, nor feare any such things by themselves? A. 1. Because they are dead in sinnes and trespasses. Eph. 2.1. Q. Why 2ly? A. 2. Because they judge themselves by false rules, and so think themselves to be something, when they are nothing. Gal. 6.3. Rev. 3.17.
Q. What be those false rules whereby they deceive themselves? A. Many thinke, that because they are (a) baptized, and professe the faith of Christ, and (b) live in good order, a civill, harmlesse life:Whatsoever is short of Regenera∣tion, is short of salvation. perhaps (c) better then o∣thers, or better then themselves have done heretofore: that therefore they be in good case: and yet an Hypocrite may doe all this. (a) Math 3.9 Rom. 2.17, 25, 29. Rom. 10 3. (b) Mat. 19.20. (b) Luk. 18.11. Phil. 3.4, 7. Mat. 7.21. Q. What is the true glasse whereby to judge of our spirituall state aright? A. The Scripture: which showes how bad we are indeed, and what we want: and what manner of people we ought to be, if we mean to be saved. Jam. 1.25. Gal. 3.22. Mat. 5.20. Joh. 3.3. 2 Cor. 5.17. Act. 26.18. Q. O but men will confesse that they are sinners: and were it not for Christ, they should perish: But how may it be made ap∣peare to their consciences, that for all this their confession, they are under the Law, and not under grace? A. By 7. things. 1. By the blind and will conceits they have of God and of Religion▪ Q. What be those blind conceits of car∣nall people
A. They thinke, that it is a folly a to be singular and precise, and that they have b ever had faith and a good heart towards God— c that it was better when there was lesse preaching, and lesse knowledge, (such conceits discover a gracelesse heart) a Mat. 5.47. b Mat. 19.20. Rom. 7.9. Phil. 3.6, 7. c Jer. 44.17, 18. Q. What other blind conceits discover them to be out of the way, and in a state of darknesse? A. They think it presumption to say, a man may be a assured of his own salva∣tion, [and yet that he is in an ill case that doubts of his salvation] & that it is no such b hard matter to repent, to have a good heart, and to save God: and that c pet∣ty sins are not to be stood upon (as omis∣sion of duty, lesser oathes, humouring of men and times, &c.) a they say they doe their best, and what would you have more?] All that thus think, doe shew that they are poore deluded soules. a 2 Cor. 13.5. 2 Pe. 1.10, 11. b Eph. 1.19. Ezek. 11.19. c Luk. 16.10. 1 Sam. 15.13, 14, 20. Mat, 12.36. Jam. 5.12. d 2 Cor. 10.18. 1 Cor. 44. Q. How 2ly, may carnall persons be
convinced that they be under the Law, and not under grace? A. By the blind rules they walk by; for they (a) walk in darknesse, being (b) led by carnall reason, custome, example, and motions of their own hearts, and not by the Word and Spirit of God (a) 1 Ioh. 1, 9 (b) Rom. 8.13, 14. Eph. 2.2. Ier. 44.17.6. And if the blind lead the blind, they both fall into the ditch.—a Blind rule is a blind guide. Q. How thirdly may it be knowne? A. Because they were never converted; neither doe they see why, or from what, such as be borne and bred up in the true Religiō should be converted. such people are yet in their naturall state] Ioh. 8.33, 34.36. Ioh 3.4, 7. Luk. 15.7. Act. 3.19. Q How fourthly may people be con∣vinced to be under sinne, and without grace? A. Because sin is no burthen to to them; they were never pricked in their hearts, not soundly humbled under their naturall condition. [A man may finde many faults in himselfe, by cōmon grace; but to feel and bewaile the rottēnesse & sink of iniquity, that is in our hearts▪ the contrarieties that be in our nature against God, and the
workings of corruption; this we cannot discover, but by the sanctifying Spirit of God.] Rom. 7.7, 9. Q. How fiftly doth it appeare that men want Grace? A. Because they discerns not betweene pretious and vile; as between the state of Nature, & the state of Grace; between ci∣vill honesty, & saving Grace. [Let them tell what the differences be] Num. 16.3. Eze. 22.26. Esa. 5.20. Joh. 3.4. 1 Cor. 2.13, 14. Spirituall things must be spiritually dis∣cerned; you must not heare a Sermon as you would heare a speech, &c. Q. How sixtly may this be proved? A. Because they cannot bring you one promise out of the Scripture, nor one mark of a saved one, of which they can say, this doth belong to me: [But the lesse they know of the Word of God, the better they thinke of themselves; and the lesse they search their owne hearts, the greater is their assurance: These are deluded ones.] Sound Christians can bring promises and evidences, that they are in the state of Grace: such as these, Rom. 8.1, 2, 13. 1 Joh. 3.14. 1 Joh. 5.1, 2. 1 Thes. 5.5, 6. Q. How lastly may a carnall person be convinced to be under sin?
A. Because they are not in Christ: this you must know, that it is not enough for a man to doe his best, and what he can: but if he be not in Christ, the Law layeth hold on him, he is under the curse: [No body is safe by doing his best:Eph. 2.12. 1 Thes. 1.10. the Law is a cru∣ell Master, it lookes not what we can doe, it accepts not of repentings, &c. but unless we be in Christ Jesus, it curseth all our imperfections.] Gal. 3.10. 1 Joh. 5.11, 12. Q. This is the case of man by nature, and of all the sons of Adam. What must we doe to escape wrath? A. We must get into the Covenant of Grace made to us in Christ the promised seed. Gal. 3.13, 26. Rom. 10.4 Gal. 4.4, 5. CAP. VI. Of the Covenant of Grace; and our Redemption by Christ. Third head of Chri∣stian do∣ctrine.Q WHat is the Covenant of Grace? A. It is Gods free Charter and Grant, wherein he bestoweth remission of sinnes, and the Kingdome of Heaven, in and for the death of Christ Jesus: [or it is a con∣tract betweene God and man, concerning reconciliation and life everlasting, to be
given and received by faith in Jesus Christ.] 2 Cor. 5.19. Gen. 17.4, 7. There is Gospell in that. Rom. 4.16, 17. Gal. 3.8. Deu. 26.17, 18. [The matter, covenanted, is life, and reconciliation: the conveyance, it is a  gift by Christ: the instrument and mean to  receive it, is faith: all our right and title to Heaven comes this way: from the love of the Father, through the merit of the Son, made ours by faith. Eph. 15. Rom. 5.21. Rom. 3.22, 24 Eph. 2.8. Q. What is the true difference between the Covenant of Workes, and the Cove∣nant of Grace? A. The Law, or Covenant of Workes offereth salvation to them that keepe it perfectly in their own persons, [that is, to them that be without sinne, and have a righteousnesse of their owne, a personall, perfect, perpetuall Obedience.] Rom. 10.5. Luk. 10.28. Q. Explaine that farther. A. The Law considers not what we can doe now, neither doth it accept of sor∣rowes for doing amisse: but it is satisfied only with a full and compleat obedience [If thou say I doe my best, &c. that is no con∣tent to the Law: the Law requires that all our works be holy, without any touch of
the flesh.] Rom. 7.14. 2 Cor. 3.7, 9. Gal. 3.10. It curseth every failing. Q. How doth the Gospel offerus salvation A. By the righteousnesse of Christ th Mediator; so that the humbled soule, rest¦ing on Christ by faith, is justified, and  peace with God, though we be not per¦fectly holy. Rom. 3.25, 26, 27. Gal. 2.1. 2 Cor. 5.19. Rom. 4.16. 1 Tim. 1.15. [This the priviledge of the Gospell, that whe we faile, yet if we repent, and turnet God, God accepts our persons, and th greatest sin shall not condemne us; (th Law knowes no such thing.)] Gal. 3.12. Of justifica∣tion by faith in Christ Jesus.Q. 1. Then Christ doth not justify us  giving grace and ability to keep the Law A. No, for then Justification were a  works, and not of Grace: besides, there no such (b) ability given to any living [Grace is given whereby we subdue or corruptions,The Cove∣nant with Adam was of workes, though all he had was given him. and strive to please God, b not to fulfill the Law perfectly] (a) Eph. 7, 8, 9, 10. (b) 1 Joh. 1.8, 9. Act. 5.31. Ac 15.11. That which I fetch with my pen is not a gift; but our righteousnesse is  gift. Rom. 5.17. Q. 2. Doth he save us by joyning  merits to our workes, as if we were justi¦fied partly by workes, and partly by fai in Christ?
A. No; we are justified by faith, with∣out the deeds of the Law; and Christ will not have any to bejoyned with him in that businesse. Rom. 3.21, 27, 28. Rom. 11.6. Esa. 64.6. Jer. 23.6 Esa. 63.3. Rom. 4 5, 6. Heb. 7.25. Heb. 9.26 Gal. 5.4. To a sinners justi∣fication, Christ is all in all▪ or none at all. Q. 3. Doth the New Covenant save as, by changing the condition of workes into faith, and sincere obedience; as if the act of believing and obeying, should be in stead of perfect obedience to the Law? A. By no meanes;The righte∣ousnesse by which we are justified is, 1. The righteous∣nesse of a God. 2. Im∣puted to us, residing in the person of Christ. 3. Every way able to an∣swer the Law. See Phil. 39, 2 Cor. 5.21. Ro 3.21, 22, 26. But our faith and sincere obedience is. 1. But the righteousnesse of a man 2. Inherent, no im∣puted. 3. No way able to answer the Law. The New Covenant doth not change workes into workes; workes perfect incompleat, ito workes imperfect▪ But it changeth workes of our own performing, into workes performed for us by Christ. for faith doth not ju∣stifie, as it is a grace wrought in us, & work∣ing in us; but as it is an instrument where∣by the soule layeth hold on Christ: ['Tis the object of faith that saveth us: God gives Christ, and thou must receive him, and the hand to take him is faith. Heb. 10.10. Rom. 9.32. with Rom. 10.3, 4. Joh 6.35. Joh. 1.12. 1 Joh. 5 11, 12. Col. 1.20. Rom. 4.5, 6, 7, 16. The righteousnesse of Christ is the onely righteousnesse by which we stand justified before God: and Faith is the onely Meanes by which Christs righte∣ousnesse
is made ours: and this faith doth justify, not as it acteth upon our heart to subdue lusts, but as it acteth upon Christ's bloud: as the meat that is eate doth feed, & the medicine received doth cure the disease: even so he that eateth me, shall live by me, saith Christ, Joh. 6▪ 57. Q. You say that you cannot be save by the Law: What then is the onely way left to inherit eternall life? A. Christ is the way, the truth, and th life: He was made sinne for us, that w might be made the righteousnesse of Go in him. John. 14.6. 2 Cor. 5.21. 1 Cor. 1.3 [This is the Covenant of Grace: this  the Word of eternall life.] Joh. 6.68. Q. When was this Covenant first mad with mankind. A In (a) Paradise, immediately afte the fall of Adam: and it was renued (b with Abraham, declared by Moses (c) an the Prophets, till at last it was confirme by the death of Christ the promiser an testator (a) Heb. 11.4. Gen. 3.14. (b) Gen▪ 17.4, 11. (c) Exod. 24.8. Heb. 9.19, 20. Ga 3.16, 17. Q. Were the Fathers, before the come¦ing of Christ, saved by faith in him?
A. Yes: we and they doe all drink of the same Spirituall Rock, which is Christ: being all children of faith and of the promise. 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3. Rom. 4.12. Rom. 9.8. Gal. 3.29. Heb. 11.4. Heb. 9.15. Rom. 1.1, 2. with 1 Pet. 3.18, 19. 1 Pet. 4.6. Q. Then the Old and New Testament be all one for substance? A. They are so: Christ is the substance of both: and they are but severall waies of setting down the Covenant of Grace: the one teaching to believe in Christ that was to come: the other shewing more clearly all things fulfilled in Christ now come, [according as was promised and prefigured.] Q. By this it appeares that the Cove∣nant of Grace is a most free Covenant, not grounded upon any condition on our parts: not upon any thing that we can doe, or suffer. A. It is a most free and gratious Co∣venant: all the promises be made good to us in Christ:Eph. 3.12. 2 Cor. 1.20. 2 Tim. 1.. and we have nothing to doe but to embrace Christ: and that grace also God promiseth to worke in us. The Covenant of workes was con∣ditionall, grounded on mans owne obedi∣ence: This New Covenant, whereby we
are restored againe into Gods favour, is called a Covenant of Grace; because the remission of sins, the favour of God, and life everlasting, are the free gift of God, gi∣ven us in Christ, not for any thing in us or done by us, but for the onely obedience o Jesus Christ the Mediator, Eph 2.8. Ro. 5.21. Whē once we have Christ by Faith, we are made New Creatures, to bring forth fruit unto God. Eph. 2.10. Rom 7.4. But we can challenge nothing of justification and life, as a debt, or as from the hand of ju∣stice, but onely as as meer gift of grace Go doth performe all things to us; not for any¦thing is us, but for his Christ. And tho conditionall expressions, If ye mortify th deed of the flesh, ye shall live, &c. such promises doe tell us who shall live not why they shall live. Lastly, that first Cove∣nant is mended; Christ the Mediator o the New Covenant makes it good, by en∣abling, us to performe the condition thereof, which Moses could not doe: he gave the Law, but could not give grace &c. Jer. 31.33. Heb. 8.9, 10. Deut. 5.27, 29. Heb 7.22.
CAP. VII. Of promises to Christ the Mediator, the Head of the Covenant of Grace. IN the Covenant of Grace there be three parties contracting and covenant∣ing. 1. God, the party offended. 2ly, Man, the party offending, and to be re∣conciled. 3ly, Christ the reconciler and peace-maker between them both. Q. The first party contracting in this New Covenant, is, God himselfe:The first Party in the New Covenant. What hath he done for Mankind? A. The Lord hath done three gratious Acts for us; His goodnesse and love to∣wards us appeareth in three things. Q. 1. What is the first gratious act of God in this Covenant of peace? A. It is the free giving of his Son to take our nature, that he might redeem us. It was the Fathers will he should have a body, and the Sons willingnesse to un∣dertake it. Heb. 5.4, 5. Heb. 10.5, 7, 9. Joh. 3.16. Esa. 9.6. Q. 2. What is the second gratious Act of God in this New Covenant? A. God hath established the Covenant
of our Redemption in and with his Son Jesus Christ:2 Cor. 5.19. God in Christ re∣conciling, &c. [God did not send his Son empty into the world, but furnished him with Testimonies & promises of his favour for the comfort of Christ himselfe, and o us his people. Joh. 10.36. Heb. 1.6. Ther was a Covenant betwixt God and Chri our head, touching the work of Redem¦ption; the Lord promising some things  Christ, and requiring some things o Christ.] 1 Tim. 3.16. Gal: 3.16, 19. Ge 12.3. Q. How many sorts of promises there in the New Covenant? A. Two sorts, some be made to Chri the Mediator: and some unto all suc persons as doe, or shall embrace Chri offered unto them. Q. What things did God promise Christ Himselfe,Of Gods promises to Christ. as our Head and Medi¦tor? A. Three things. 1. God promised to  to him a Father; to fill him with the Ho¦ly Ghost, and with power to goe throug with the work of our redemption. Heb. 5, 6. Act. 10.38. Ep 1.22. Esa. 11.2. Esa. 49. Q. What 2ly doth God promise to him A. 2. God promiseth him acceptance, vict¦ry, and successe in all his undertakings
man, Mat. 3.17. Ioh. 5.20, 21. Esay 42.6. & 53.11. Act. 2.27. Q. In what particulars shall Christ have successe, and power to blesse his people? A. In five particulars. I God sayes to him, Thou shalt a teach them,1. Conver∣sion. 2. Adopti∣on. 3. Sancti∣fication. and turne them to the Lord. 2ly Thou b shalt make them my sonnes and doughters. 3ly And thou c shalt have the spirit to bestow on them. a Mal 4.6. Luk. 1.16, 17. Ioh 6.45. Esay 61 1, 2. b Ioh: 6.40. & 1.12. c & 15.26 Luk. 24.49. Q. In what else shall Christ have suc∣cesse? A. 4ly Thou shalt a give them peace whilst they live in this world.4. Peace in our justifi∣cation. 5. Glorifi∣cation. 5yl And b raise them up at the last day to eternall glory. a Ioh: 10.16, 28, 29. & 14.27. & 16.33. b Ioh. 6.37, 40. Rom 8.11. Q These are Gods promises to his Son: What did God require of him when he gave him to be Head and Covenant to his people? A. God said, Thou must a have a body prepared thee, wherein to do my will; Thou b must be a servant, a man of sor∣rows, to bear mans transgressions; thou must die, & be made an offering for their sins.
a Heb. 10.7. Gal. 4.4, 5. b Esay 53.5, 6, 10 Phil. 2.8. Heb: 2.10. Luk. 24.46. Q. Christ was content to doe all this. What lastly, did God for him upon the performance thereof? A. He highly exalted him above every name, and anointed him with the oyle of gladnesse above his fellowes; thereby testifying, that he is well pleased and sa∣tisfied with Christ's performances for us. Phil. 2.9 Heb. 1.3, 4, 5, 9. Psal. 45.7. Esay 53.12. 1 Tim. 3.16. Q. What have we to consider in this worke of God towards mankind? A. His sweet and unspeakable love; that when it was not in the power of any crea∣ture to devise a way, he provided a price out of his owne store to redeeme us, Esay 59 6. Eph. 3.10, 18. 2 Cor. 5, 19: to him∣selfe, &c. Q. Why did God thus article with Christ our Head? A. It is for our consolation and assu∣rance, that God doth capitulate with Christ our head, in the name of the elect; be∣cause now all is sure, God cannot breake with his owne Son, 2 Cor. 1.20, 21. Gal 3.16. Ephe. 1.3. Joh: 20.17. [He is first Christ's Father, and then ours, 1 Pet: 1.21.
John. 16.10. Christ will see the Covenant performed on both parts, viz: all that God promiseth to us, shall be made good to us; and all that man ought to doe, he hath done for us, and in us, our righteousnesse is placed in the person of Christ, and so it is in a safe hand, where we shall be sure to find, and have it, when we have most need of it. Our righteousnesse is not in our owne keeping, as it was in the first Covenant. CAP. VIII. Of Christ offered to Sinners, as yet uncon∣verted; and of the ground of a Sinners going to Christ. Q. WE have seen the promises made to Christ the Media∣tor. What is the third gratious Act of God the Father in this New Covenant? A. The Lord offereth Christ to all sin∣ners, and with him, all things that pertain to life and godlinesse. 2 Pet. 1.3. Rom. 8 32. Luk. 24.44. Mar. 16.15. Q. Shew particularly what promises God hath made to mankind,Of Gods promises to mankind. in and with his Sonne Jesus Christ? A. Some belong to sinners that be as
yet out of Christ; that so of unbelievers, they may be made believers. And some be peculiar to them that do embrace Christ, [and be in covenant with him.] Q. Are there any promises made to a man not yet in the state of Grace, to un∣believer? God consi∣ders not what thou hast beene heretofore; Come in now, em∣brace Christ and live.A. Yes: Christ, with all his riches and promises, is offered to poore sinners, of what sort soever they be absolutely, with∣out any former condition in themselves; and freely, for just nothing. [Any that will may take him.] Esa. 55.8. Rev. 22.17. Luk 14.16, 21, 23. Joh. 7.37. Esa. 61.1, 3. Ezek. 16.6. Buy without money, &c. Q. Are such invited to take Christ, as have nothing in them but sinne and wret∣chednesse? May they meddle with Christ? A. Yes: And he is fittest for Christ, that doth most loath himselfe, & seeth least goodnesse in himselfe. Mat 9.13. Luk. 18.9, 11, 13, 21. Q. Declare that more largely. A. All that come to Christ, must come with an heart a emptied of all conceits of goodnesse; having a vile esteeme, not onely of their sinnes, but of their best righteousnesse b and moralities, and performances of their unregenerate time.

God doth not only offer Christ, with all his merits, but also a inviteth, and  b beseecheth, and c commands thee  to believe; d promising that he will not  reject thee, whatever thou hast beene here∣tofore. a Mat. 11.28. b 2 Cor. 5.20. c 1 Joh. 3.23. Luk. 14.23. d Joh. 6.37. Luk. 15.19, 20. This is the key of the Go∣spell to let sinners into Christ; to make a believer of an unbeliever: It is a cable cast out to us, whereby to pluck our selves to shore, as men doe that are fallen into the water.] Q. What is the poore sinners duty now? A. To take Christ thus offered, and
pressed upon him by God: But if thou re∣ject him, thou dost justly perish: [Thou must accept Christ for thy Lord and Sa∣viour.] John 16.8, 9. Luk. 14.18 24. Q. O but what comfort hath the soule to goe to God, till we know our selves to be in Christ, and in the state of Grace? A. Promises are not offered to belie∣vers onely, but laid as the foundations of Faith: we goe to God, not from being par∣doned, but to be pardoned; not from assu∣rance, but for assurance: And for your so doing, you have grounds and comfort e∣nough in Gods promises, and Christs call: Thy assurance is not the ground of thy going to God, but Gods invitation, and promises, Rom. 10.12. Mark. 16.15. Eph. 1.13. Heb. 11.6. The sad soule, though he goe to God trembling, yet he goes be∣lievingly: It is faith that sends the soule a begging unto God. Q. All that seem to fly to Christ, doe not accept of him aright: How may I know that I doe it aright? A. As the Wife takes the Husband to be her head, to stick to him, to obey him: so must thou take Christ to be thy head and husband, thy King and Saviour, upon any
tearmes: [If thou canst say, I will have Christ what ere it cost me, that is a true accepting of Christ. [Luk. 14.28, 33. & 16.13. Mat. 10.37. [this is the whole na∣ture of faith, to know him, to accept him for our Lord and Saviour,What Faith is. and to rest on him. Eph. 1.13. Q. What followes hereof? A. By this we have an entrance and right unto all the promises made to the Elect in Christ, 1 Pet. 1.21. Eph. 2.18. 2 Pet. 1.11. CAP. IX. Of Gods promises to them that actually embrace Christ: of the Blessings of the Covenant. Q. VNbelievers have promise of acce∣ptance, if they will come in and submit to Christ: What are the promises made to them that doe believe? A. They be of three sorts: 1 Spirituall; 2 Temporall: 3 Eternall. [Spirituall promises may be reduced to two heads: for either they concerne remission of sins, or our sanctification, and perseverance in grace.]
1. Sort are spirituall promises.Q What promise of mercy hath God made to them that believe? A.

God hath promised to teach us ef∣fectually; to write his Law in our hearts; to cause us to love him, and not to depart from him. [God hath promised to work our works in us, else this Covenant also would nor be sure to us.Those are better pro∣mises then were in the first Cove∣nant. God doth not only keepe faith and covenant with us on his owne part, but he doth also forgive our failings and unfaithfulnesse, and causeth us to keep covenant with him. Heb: 8.10, 11. Jer: 32.38.40. Esa: 26.12. Hos: 2.19. Deut: 30.6. Act: 5.31 2 Tim 2.13, Rom: 3.3. Q. Doe these promises belong to all degrees of believers? A. Yes; to the weake, and to them that be cast downe, as well as to them that be strong in saith, and free from doubtings. Mat: 12.20. Mat: 14.31. Q. Shew particularly what promises
God hath made to the weake Christian, to one that is a beginner. A. First, there is a promise of accep∣tance. God will accept and cherish the ve: ry first motions, desires,1 To the weake. and weakest per∣formances of the honest heart. Luk 15.20. 2 Chron: 9.1. Gen: 22.16. with Heb: 11.17. Esa: 42.3. 2 Chron. 19.3. particularly for prayer. Esa. 65.24. for almes. 2 Cor. 8.12. Q What other promise is there for weake Christians? A. Secondly, there is a promise of per∣severance;2 To the doubting. their faith shall never finally faile, but they are kept by the power of God unto salvation. 1. Joh: 3.9. Luk: 22.32. Joh: 10.28, 29. 1 Pet: 1.5. Zac: 12.8. Esa: 40.29. 1 Thess: 5.24. Jud: v. 1. Q What promise is made to the doubt∣ing and distressed Christians disquieted a∣bout his spirituall estate? A. God will heale the broken hearted, beare their prayers, and sustaine them with his grace. [The sanctifying spirit in thee is Gods witnesse that thou art his. [Esa: 61.3. Esay 50.10. Jam: 5.13. 1 Cor: 10.13. Ioh 13.15.16. Esa: 57.16, 20. Mat: 5.4. Psal: 51.8. Psal: 77.3. Q What promise is there for them that be tempted by Satan?
3. To the tem∣pted.A. Greater is he that is in us, and with us, than he that is against us; and he will tread Satan under our feet, 1 John 4.4. Rom 16.20. Re. 12.10, 11, 14, 16. Mat. 16.18. 2 Cor. 12.9. Iam. 4.7, 8. Heb. 4.15.16. Q. What promise is there to a back∣slider that is returning? 4. To the la∣psd.A. God will heale their back-slidings, and his anger shall be turned away from them. Hos. 14 1, 4. Ier. 3.1, 12. Ier. 31.18, 20, 22. Ezek 18.28, 30. Luke 22.32. Esay 55.7. Q. What promises are made to them that long for grace, and for the favour of God? 5. To the hun∣gry soule.A. God will satisfie their desires, and speake peace to their soules: [He will be found of them. The spirit is compared to water; 1. For its refreshing the weary 2. For its clensing of the filthy. 3. For it fruitfulnesse, making the barren to bring forth good fruit.] Mat. 5.6. Luke 11.13 Esay 44 3. & 65.13. Prov. 2.25. Q. What temperall promises, concerning this life hath God made to us in Christ? Second sort of promises.A. He will give us all needfull a bles¦sings, and turne b all hurtfull things  our good. a Mat. 6.26, 32. Ps. 84.11 Esay 43.2. Gen. 15.1. c Rom. 8.28, 35, 37 1 Cor 3.21, 22.
Q. What promises concerning the life to come hath God given us? A. It is his good pleasure to give us his Kingdome,Third sort of promises. Luk. 12.32. Joh. 12.26. Joh. 17.24. [All these things doth God promise with his Sonne; saying, Take him; this I will doe for you, I will forgive your sins, and give you peace: if any thirst, I will fill him with good things, &c. And because all this shall be sure to you, I will frame your hearts to love me; I will be your teacher; you shall be able to discern be∣tween pretious and vile; when you fall, I will not suffer you to fall away: I will heare your prayers, I will give you vi∣ctory over Satan, and after all I will bring you to glory. This portion you shall have with my Christ.] Q. How doth God confirme all these promises to us? In whom are they sure? A. In Christ, the foundation of the New Covenant; to whom God hath sworne, and will not repent. 2 Cor. 1.20. Heb. 7.19, 21, 22. Heb. 6.13, 17, 18, 19. Tit. 1.2. 2 Tim. 1.1.
CAP. X. Of Christ the Mediator of the New Test¦ment; and first of his wonderfull person, God and man, and the Benefits flowing from that personall union. YOu have seen what God hath do for us, viz. given his Son; offered hi to sinners, with rich and large promis to them that recieve him. The secon party in the New Covenant is Christ th Mediator.The second party in the New Cove∣nant. Of this Mediator we are to con¦sider two things: 1. His person. 2. H undertaking and office. Q. All the promises of God have the Yea and Amen in Christ: Who is Christ▪ A. Jesus Christ is the a eternall So of God, of the same b substance wit the Father, God from everlasting; c wh in the fulnesse of time tooke on him on nature; d so that he is true God and tru man in one person. a Mat. 16.16. b Heb 1.3. Joh. 1.1, 3. Joh. 10.30. Rev. 1.8. Esa 9.6. Joh. 5.18. Phil. 2.6. c Gal. 4.4,  d Rom. 1.3. Rom. 9.5. Col. 2.9. Ma 22.43. Q. What is necessary that Christ on
peace-maker should be man? A. Yes, for three reasons. First, because he that redeemeth, and they that be re∣deemed, must be both of one kind and na∣ture, that so Gods Justice may accept him in our stead [a right to redeeme; there∣fore Angels that fell are not saved, be∣cause he took not their nature.] Heb. 2.10.11, 14, 16. Ruth. 4.4, 6. 1 Cor. 15.20, 21. Q. Why secondly? A. That he might be put under the Law, and die; the which as God he could not doe. [He was to pay our debt, and therefore to enter into our bonds.] Heb. 2.9, 10, 14. Rev. 1, 5. 1 Pet. 2.24. Q. Why thirdly? A. That he might be a mercifull, and faithfull High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. Heb. 2.17, 18. Heb. 4.15. Heb. 5.2. Our Saviour was taken from a∣mong men, that he might have compassi∣on them that be tempted, and out of the way. Q. Did Gods justice require him to death? was it necessary that Christ should dye for us? A. Yes; Sin calls for death, as for its wages; and he that will redeem a sinner,
must dye for him: [He must pay all o debt, and that is a price for a sinner▪ Math. 26.39. Rom. 8.32. Heb. 9.12, 22, 26 1 Pet. 3.18. Q. Why must the Mediator be all God? A. 1. That he might be able to over come death. Act. 2.24 John 10.18. C 2.15. Q. Why 2ly must the Mediator be God A. 2. To make his obedience and suf¦ferings efficacious and acceptable for us All the Angels in Heaven, if they shoul suffer in Hell for evermore, cannot sati¦fie for one soule. Heb. 9.12, 14. Heb. 10. 9. Mic. 6.6, 7. 1 Pet. 1.18. Psal. 49, 7, 8. [N meer creature can stand before the wrat of God to overcome it; a finite creature cannot satisfie an infinite God.] Q. Say the same againe in plaine tearmes. A. All that Christ did and suffered  therefore meritorious & pretious, becaus it was the suffering and obedience of on that is God: [The bloud of God, the righ∣teousnesse of God.] Acts 20.28. 1 Cor. 2.8. 2 Cor. 5.21. Rom. 3.22. Q. How can that be, seeing God can¦not suffer, nor yet be obedient to any
there being none greater then God? A. Is it so; because God and man be one person: his humane nature is united to the person of God; by reason of which personall union, that which is proper to the humane nature, is applyed to whole Christ, [to the man Christ Jesus.] Luke 1.43. John 8.58. John 3.13. Q. Then Jesus Christ the Son of God, and the Son of Mary, are not two persons, but two natures in one person. A. It is true; for the humane nature was taken into the subsistence of the se∣cond person in the Blessed Trinity, being from his conception prevented from a personall subsisting of it selfe, like other men. God took man into himselfe, and joined it to himself; and so God and man be one Christ] Luk. 1.35. Heb. 2.16. Joh. 1.14. Joh. 17.21, 22. [Man and wife be one by civill bonds, yet not one person, Christ & we are one by spirituall bonds, yet not one person; but God and man be one per∣son of Christ, Mat: 1.23. Emmanuel. Q. Why must the Mediator be God and Man in one person? A. He must be man, that he might dye; and he must be God, that he might be able to overcome death; & he must be both in one
person that the sufferings in the humane nature, might have worthinesse and me∣rit to save us. 1 Pet. 1.19. Esay 53.10, 11. Q. You see that the worthinesse o Christs sufferings depends on that blessed union of man to the Godhead: What o∣ther benefit flowes from thence? A. From that personall union are com∣municated to us all the graces and pri∣viledges which we doe enjoy, or looke for hereafter. [all our riches and happi∣nesse is first in Christ our head, and from Christ to us.] Eph. 1.3, 4. 1 Cor. 3.22, 23 Ioh. 17.21, 22, 23. & 15.9. & 1.16. Col. 1. 13, 15, 17, 19 Rom 8.11, 17. [All thing are ours; because we are knit to Christ and Christ is Gods: from that blessed and glorious Head of ours that dwels in the glorious Godhead; from thence descend all grace to the brethren. God is first th Father of Christ, then our Father. Christ is that Iacobs Ladder, that joynes Heaven and Earth together. Iohn 1.51. & 20 17.] Q. Is it not a great comfort that our Mediator is our brother, and also one with God? A It now is, and ever will be, an infi∣nite contentment to the poore soule, to
behold our blessed Head and Mediator dwelling in those everlasting burnings, set in glory at Gods owne right hand a∣bove all created natures: [From whence he now governes the Church, and will hereafter glorifie it with his own glory.] Eph: 1 21, 22. Rom. 8.34. We must looke upon all things done to Christ, and by Christ, as a common person, and head of the Elect, uniting us unto God, com∣municating unto us all spirituall good things; triumphing over all the enemies of our salvation; preparing mansions for us against we die, and in the mean while making intercession for us, untill he hath brought us to the enjoyment of himselfe in glory, John 14.2. 1 Cor. 3.23. & 17.21, 22, 24. CAP: XI. Of Christs Priestly office, & the parts there∣of, viz. satisfaction and intercession. HE that shall bring sinners to Heaven must doe three things. First, he must make satisfaction to God for their sinnes. Secondly, he must effectually teach them to know God. Thirdly, he must rule
and deliver them from all opposite power. All this Christ doth undertake and per∣forme in us and for us: And accordingly we are taught in Scripture, that he hath  threefold office; namely, 1. Of Priest, to make reconciliation,Of Christs threefold office. by the offering up o himselfe to God for us. 2. Of a King, to conquer our enemies, and rule in ou hearts. 3. Of a Prophet, to teach us the will of God. Q. What is Christs Priestly Office? 1. Priestly.A. Christs Priestly office is, to pacifie his Fathers wrath, and make an atone∣ment for the sins of the people, by the offering up of himselfe a sacrifice for sin Heb. 5.1. Heb. 2.17. Levit. 5.17, 18. Num 16.47. Heb. 9.26. Q. What be the parts of Christ Priestly office? A. Two, namely, to make 1 Satisfaction for the people. 2 Intercession for the people. [And so was the Office of Aaron, and the Priests, to be mediators between God and man; and to make atonement for the sins of the people, and to pray for them. Heb. 9.7, Heb. 5.1.
Q. We have offended and wronged God:Of Christs satisfaction Did Christ make any reall satis∣faction to God for the same? A. Yes: He did not barely intreat for us, but he paid in such a price, and gave such contentment to Gods Justice in our be∣halfe, that the Lord doth smell a favour of rest to our soules. Rom. 3.25, 26. 1 Tim. 2.6. 1 Pet. 1.19. with 1 Joh. 2.2. Num. 19.9. with Heb. 13.11, 12. Levit. 16.20, 22. Esa. 53.5, 8. [Christ doth not barely in∣treat, but as an advocate, he pleads a satis∣faction made: Expiation and satisfaction is the taking away of an offence, by doing or suffering something, by some worke or price which the party offended will ac∣cept of. As 2 Sam. 21.3. 1 Cor. 6.20. Heb. 9.12. Philem. v. 18. Q. How did Christ make such satisfa∣ction for us. A. By the offering up of his body a sa∣crifice for sinne, according to the will of God, by which we are consecrated and reconciled to God for ever. [The Father craved no more but once offering for our ransome.] Heb. 10.5, 9, 12. Eph. 5.2. with Gen. 8.21. Rom. 8.34. Christs bloud is the price of soules. Q. Is that a true & full satisfaction for sin?
A. Yes: Gods Justice is no looser by pardoning sin for Christs sake, seeing our sinnes are visited to the full upon Christ our surety; there is man for man, soule for soule; the pretious death of his righteous Son, instead of a sinfull crea∣ture. 1 Pet. 3.18. 1 Joh. 17.9 Joh. 11.50. Rom. 8 32.In Hell there is suf∣fering e¦nough but no satisfa∣ction; the debt is ne∣ver pd. Gods Justice is better con∣tented in Christs sufferings for a time, then in the creatures for evermore; and for the sinnes of the Elect, then for the sinnes of the damned.] Q. If God be satisfied, then we are dis∣charged from the curse of the Law, and all our debt to Gods Justice A. We are so because Christ our sure∣ty hath fully answered the Law for us; so that nothing remaines to be charged on us. Gal. 3.10, 13. Rom. 8.33, 34. Q. But how did Christ answer the Law for us? A. By a bearing all that punish∣ment which is due to breakers of God Law; and by b fulfilling all that obed∣ence which it requireth of us. a Phil. 28. Ro. 5.19. b Mat. 5.17. Joh. 8.29. Mat. 3.15. Rom. 8.3. We that are sinners stand bound to God in a double debt. 1. Of satisfaction for sins past. 2. Of obedience for time
coming: This the Law requireth of us, and thus much Christ hath performed for us. Q. What is the second part of Christs Priestly office. A. To make intercession for us,Of Christs intercession. Rom 8.34. Heb. 7.25. Q. What meane you by Christs inter∣cession? A. Christ stands between God and us; he presents us and our prayers to God, & pleads his merits for our acceptance. [Christ appears in the presence of God for us, as the high Priests did with the names the twelve Tribes, in the Holy of Holies.] Heb. 9.24. 1 Joh. 2.1. Rev. 8.2, 3. Exod: 28.28, 29, 38. Q. What then be the parts of Christs intercession? A. They be two. 1. To present and tender to his Father his owne bloud, which he shed for our sins: And 2ly, To make requests for us. Thus did the high Priest, (who was a Type of Christ) enter into the Holy of Holies [which was a figure of Heaven] with the bloud of a Bullock, & a Goat, [which did signifie Christs bloud] and with Incese: [which did sig∣nifie his prayers for the people.] Thus did
the High Priest when he went into the Holy of Holies, to make atonement and reconciliation for the people. Lev. 16.5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19. And thus doth Christ our High Priest for us now in Heaven. Rev. 8.2, 3. Heb. 9.12, 23, 24. Christ carried his own bloud into Heaven. Q. What is the effect and fruit of this part of Christs Priestly office? 1 Pet. 2.5. Heb. 7.25. Heb. 9.14.A. By this applying and pleading of his sacrifice for us, both our persons, and our services are accepted with God. Exod. 28 38. Q. What followes of all this? A. Therefore we must go to God on∣ly by Christ, and not by any Creature, Saint, or Angll: 'Tis Christs office, not theirs, to appeare in our behalfe before God. Heb 4.14, 16. with Heb. 5.4, 5. Q. How doth it appeare that he is a Priest to you? A. Because he gives me peace of con∣science in his bloud, and hath made me a Priest, to offer up spirituall sacrifices to God by him. Rev. 1.6. 1 Pet 2.5. Rom. 12.1.
CAP. XII. Of Christs Kingly, or Ruling office. Propheticall, & Teaching office. ALL the Benefits obtained by Christs Priestly Office, are conveyed unto us by his Kingly and Propheticall office. Q. Is Christ the King of the Church? A. Yes:2. Of Christs Kingly office. Christ is the only King over the Church: It is such an Honour, that God thinkes it fit for none but his Son. Heb. 1.8, 9. Col. 1.15, 18. Christ is the first borne of every Creature; He is the Head and Husband of the Church, and there∣fore he alone is fit, he alone is able to ga∣ther a Church, to rule his Church, and to deliver it from those mighty Princi∣palities and Powers which fight against our soules. Mat. 2.2. Rev. 19.16. 1 Tim. 6.15. Rev. 15.3. Q. What kind of Kingdome, or domi∣nion hath Christ over the Church? A. It is not of this world, nor like the Kingdomes of earth: But it is a spirituall Kingdome, ordering the businesse of the soule, and the affaires of Heaven. Col. 1.
13. Rev: 1.18. & 3.7. All things belong∣ing to it are spirituall; the means of ga∣thering and governing it, are spirituall; the weapons of our warfare, are spirituall; the blessings and priviledges are spirituall; the enemies of it are spirituall, &c. Q. What be the parts of this spirituall Kingly office of Christ? A. They be foure. 1 To deliver us out of the hands of our spirituall enemies; to turne us from darknesse to light, & from the power of Satan unto God, and so to translate us into the Kingdome of Jesus Christ. Act: 26, 18. Col. 1.13. Luk. 1.74. Q. What be those spirituall enemies out of whose hands Christ doth deliver us? A. Foure. 1 a Sinne. 2 b Satan. 3 c The curse of the Law. And Lastly, d Death: All these be enemies to our salvation, and over them all Christ doth give us the victory: a 1 Pet: 4.2. 1 Joh: 3.8. Mat: 12.20. Rom 6.7. b Rom. 16.20. 1 Ioh: 4.4. c Rom: 7.1.4. & 8.33. d 1 Cor. 15.55, 57. Q. What is the second part of Christs Kingly office? A. To give us Laws and Rules to order and governe us (being thus gathered)
in the wayes of truth and righteousnesse. Esay 9.6, 7. Gal: 6.16. Mat: 28.20. Q. Then they wrong Christ in his Kingly office, that challenge a power o∣ver the conscience, to bind it with sin, or duty? A. They doe so; because it is Christs prerogative to give Lawes to the consci∣ence, Esay 33.22. Mat. 23.8, 10. Iam. 4.12. Men may order the outward man by their Lawes,Col. 2.11.21, 12. but the conscience is Christs pecu∣liar, they may not meddle with that, to bind where Christ hath set free; And where Christ hath bound, no man can set us free, 1 Cor. 7.24. 2 Cor. 11.20 Gal. 5.1. Q. What is the third part of Christs Kingly office? A. To subdue our lusts; to rule in our hearts by his Word and Spirit, and to keep us in obedience to his Lawes, Psal. 110.2, 3. & 45.5. 2 Cor: 10.4.5. Luk: 19.14, 27. Ezek: 34.23, 24. Q. What is the fourth part of Christs Kingly office? A. To defend and preserve us amidst all tentations, unto his Kingdome of glo∣ry. Christ doth take order with the Ene∣mies of his Church & Kingdome: he dis∣covers and confounds their plots and de∣vices:
He restraines their rage, and sets bounds to their malice, & at last he cast∣eth them into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone. Rev. 2.10. Luk. 18.7, 8. Esa. 43.2. Amos 9.9. Ezra 6.8, 11, 22. Esth. 3.8, 13. with Esth. 6.1, 6. with Esth. 8.5, 8, 11. with Esth. 9.1, 22. Rev. 19.20. Q. By what means doth Christ gathe him a Kingdome, and carry on the Go∣vernment thereof? A. a Not by the arm of flesh, b bu by spirituall weapons, viz. His Word, Sa¦craments, and the exercise of the keyes (which we call discipline) a 2 Cor. 10.4. Esa. 11.4. Eph. 6.11, 12. b Jo 20.23. Mat. 18.17, 18. Q. Then it is not lawfull for Christians by force of Armes, to erect Christs King∣dome? much lesse is it lawfull for Chri¦stian people to rise up against civill Ma∣gistrates, for the Cause and Kingdome o Jesus Christ? A. It is utterly unlawfull, a because Christs Kingdome is not of this world,  therefore his servants may not fight:  Christs Spirituall Kingdome does not o∣verthrow Cesars temporall power, an therefore Christ hath commanded a humble subjection to all civill Powers.
a Joh. 18.36. Mat. 26.52. b Mat. 22.21. Rom. 13.1, 2, 4, 7. Tit. 3.1. Act. 23.5. 1 Pet. 2.13, 15, 16. It is a singular wickednesse, to make Christs Name and Gospell a pre∣tence to shake off Temporall authority, or to make it a Condition of our yeilding ci∣vill obedience unto them. Q. How shall I know that Christ is a King to me? A. By two things. 1. By the obedience I yeild to his Lawes. Joh. 15.14. Q. How secondly? A. By the victory he gives me over my sinnes: if sinne reigne in us, Christ is not King.

Rev. 3.18. Christ does not onely hold forth the light, but he gives us eies to see it. Q. Be there not other Prophets and Teachers of the Church. A.

Q How shall I know that I am taught of God? A. When the Word which we heare is followed by us, and obeyed: [else thou hast heard a meer man; man may teach you to know the definitions of faith, of sin, of repentance, &c. but Christ alone teacheth you to believe and repent; Christ giveth the discerning, the taste to judge between things that differ.] 2 Cor. 10.5. Joh. 10.4, 5, 27.
CAP. XIII. Of Man to be reconciled to God in the New Covenant; Man is the third party in the Covenant of Grace. GOD hath given his Son to be a Co∣venant of the people,The third party in the New Co∣venant. (Esa. 42.6.) Made sure promises to him, &c. And Christ thus brought into the world, furnished with grace & power, is offered to sinners, with large promises to them that receive him. It followes to be considered. Q. To whom doe those promises of life and salvation belong? Who may take comfort in them? A. Onely they that be in covenant with God. Eph. 2.12. Q. When is the soule in covenant with God? A. When the heart consents to take Christ as he is offered to us in all his Of∣fices; resigning up, & engaging our selves to be wholly his: [God takes us for his people, we take him to be our God.] Deut. 26.17, 18. Jer. 30.21, 22. Gen. 15.1, 6. Zach. 13.9. Joh. 1.12. The soule does not mis∣like the person, nor the Portion, nor the
tearmes on which Christ is offered to us. The believer takes Christ for his Saviour, for his Teacher, for his Lord and Ruler. Q. What manner of persons are in cove∣nant with God? A. Such as believe the Gospell, repent of their sinnes, and walke uprightly before God. Gen. 17.1. Mar. 1.15. Acts 20.21. These three things are required of all that be in Covenant with God. 1. Of Faith.Q. What is the nature, and proper act of faith? A. It is a grace, whereby we doe acknow∣ledge and accept of Christ for our Lord & Saviour, and rest on him alone for salvati∣on. [Or it is a grace, whereby the soule doth rest and rely on the promise of life and salvation made in Christ Jesus.] Eph. 1.12, 13. Rom. 10.14. Rom. 15.12. Tit. 1.1.2 Psal. 2.12. Psal, 18.2:] Trust hath for its object, the promises of God; and it is not every promise that is the object of faith, as it justifieth, but the promise of life only: Christ is the proper object of faith as it justifieth, & trusting is the proper act of faith. To seek, and thirst after Christ, and rest on him, that is Faith.] Heb. 10.38. Q. Many say they trust on Christ, and
yet deceive themselves: Shew some signes of true faith. A. There be three signes of true faith. 1. It makes me to strive against unbeliefe. and all other lusts; purging the heart, and working out the filthinesse of it, as a spring doth the mire and dirt that is cast into it: [or as the stomack expels poyson] faith and lusts cannot lodge and dwell together. Mar. 9.24. He. 10.38. Acts. 15.9. Q. What is a second signe of true faith? What gratious affections doe shew true faith? A. True faith makes us to prize Jesus Christ above all things; the soule will sell all gladly, and part with any content for Christs sake. Mat. 13.44. Psal. 45.10. Heb. 11.24, 25. Gen. 22.12. Heb. 11.8. Q. How, thirdly, may true faith be knowne? A. Because it is not a dead faith, but it worketh by love, that is, whatsoever sin we resist, and whatsoever good thing we doe, we doe all out of a love to the Lord Jesus: [We so love God, that we hate e∣vill for Gods sake.] Gal. 5.6. Ioh. 21.16. Iam 2.17, 18. Q. What, secondly,2. Of Re∣pentance. must they doe that be, or would be in covenant with God?
A. They must repent of their sins, and change their lives, Mot: 3.7, 8. Act. 2.38. Q. Why must they also repent that be, or would be in Covenant with God? A. Because it is necessary that they that be in Covenant with God, must breake their league with every sin: friendship with God cannot stand with friendship with any sin, 2 Cor: 6.17, 18. Jam. 4.4. 1 Joh. 2.15. Q. What is Repentance? A. It is a grace of Gods Spirit, whereby we are grieved for offending o God, b and doe turne from sinne, c ou of an inward and spirituall dslike and hatred of its filthinesse; a Mat. 26.75. 2 Cor. 7.10. b Esay 1.16, 17. 2 Pet. 2.22 1 Cor. 5.7. Act: 3.19. Ezek: 36.26, 27, 31 c Esay 33 22. Q. What be the parts of repentance▪ A. Two: mortification, whereby we die to sinne: and vivification, whereby we are quickned to a life of grace, Gal. 5.24. 1 Pet. 4.1, 2, 3. Rom. 6.6, 7. & 8.2, 10, 13▪ Eph. 4.22.24. Luk. 3.11. Q. Then prophane persons, that be at sometimes grieved & ashamed for some sins, are not esteemed to repent, unlesse they be renued to a life of grace?
A. It is true; Because their sorrow for sin is greater then their conscience of sin, and therefore it is but a fleshly sorrow. 1 King. 21.19, 20, 27. Mat. 27.3, 4, 5. Re. 16.10, 11. Hos. 7.14. Es. 58.5, 6. Jer. 8.5. Ez. 36.15, 31. the stone sweats, but is not soft: So, &c. Q. How then may I know my repen∣tance to be true? A. By three signes.  1. By the consci∣ence I make of sinne for time to come, [True repentance begets tendernesse of conscience.] 1 Sam. 24.5. Job. 34.31, 32. Hos. 14.2. Q. How Secondly? A. It workes in my heart a secret an∣tipathy and heart-rising against all sin, in whomsoever it is: though their sins doe not indanger my own salvation. [Nature doth abhor those things that be contrary to it; as a Toad or Serpent: so doth our new and spirituall nature loath all sin.] Psal. 119.136. Act. 17.16. 2 Pet. 2.8. Q. How, Lastly, is true repentance knowne? A. By the fruits of godly sorrow, rec∣koned up by Saint Paul. 2 Cor. 7.11. Q. What say you of confession to a Priest, and satisfaction: Are not they parts of repentance?
A. No; we need not confesse all our sinnes to men, and we cannot satisfie God by bearing penance: [Our sinnes are not a jot better done away by performing all the penances in the world.] CAP. XIV. Of mans uprightnesse before God. Q WHat, thirdly, is required of them that be in Covenant with God? A. God requires that all such as be in covenant with him,3. Of new obedience. should walke before him, and be upright or perfect. Gen. 17.1. Q. What is uprightnesse or sincerity? A. Uprightnesse is, when we strive to walk in a all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord, blamelesse; b so that our hearts shall not reproach us of any unfaithfulnesse, from the least to the greatest of his lawes, a Luk. 1.6. Mat. 23.23. Luk. 16.10. Jam. 2.10. c Psal. 66.18. Iob 27.6. Psal. 50.16, 17. 2 Cron. 30.19, 20. Q. None can be perfect without sin in this life: Whom doth the Gospell ac∣count perfect before the Lord?
A. Them that without guile and par∣tiality doe apply themselves to the whole will of God; that is, Hate all sinne, and have respect to all Gods commandements. Psal. 119.6. & 32.2. Job. 1.1. Gen: 6.9. Num. 14.24. 1 Chron. 12.33. Iam. 4.8. Q. What be the properties of this up∣rightnesse of heart? A. They be foure. It is expressed and known by,  1. Truth a in the inward parts.  2. By soundnesse b of heart with∣out guile and doubling.  3. By the c whole heart, without dividing.  4. And by d sin∣cerity, without mixture, doing all things as in the sight of God. a Psal. 5.6. Joh. 4.23. Heb. 20.22. b Psal. 119.80. Psal. 32.2. Rev. 3.2. 1 Tim: 1.5. Psal. 12.2. c 1 Sam. 12.24. 2 King: 23.3. Psal. 119.2. Hos. 10.2. Psal. 15.2. d 1 Corinth. 5.8. 2 Cor: 1.12. Mat. 5.8. 2 Cor. 2.17. The upright and sincere Christian is, 1. Real∣ly and in Truth such as he seems to be. 2. He is thorough for God in all places, in all companies, in all businesses. 3 His heart is not divided betweene God and Idols, between God and Men, betweene God, and credit, or profit, and any other creature. 4. He does not mingle false ends, or false motives, with Gods will and
glory: He is not an eye-servant. Q. What is the benefit and comfort of uprightnesse before God? A. God is pleased with them, and a takes delight in their person, and in all their services, b accepting the will for the deed: a 1 Chron. 29.17. Prov. 11.20. Heb. 11.5. 2 Chron. 25.2, 14. b Gen. 22.16. 2 Sam: 7.2. 2 Cor: 8.12. 1 King: 8.18. Q. This Covenant with God when is it broken? A. It is not broken by particular failings, but by unfaithfulnesse; that is, when the heart departeth from the Lord secretly or openly, choosing and joyning it selfe to any creature, or goeth after any lust. Ez. 14.7. Heb. 3.12. Deut: 29.18. Hos. 4.16, 17. Ezek. 33.31. Hos. 2.2. Es: 66.3. 2 Chron. 15. with 2 Chron. 16.7. 10, 12. 2 Chron. 9.3. Q. When is it kept? A. When, though we faile in particu∣lars of duty, yet the heart is not divorced from the Lord, but still loveth, prizeth, and cleaveth to him above all things. Psal: 119.57. 2 Chron. 25.17. Ezr: 6.21. Jer: 30 31, 32. Q. Why be these Graces required in Gods people? Why must they repent, and walk in new obedience?
A. Because God is an holy God, and therefore his people must be holy, & seve∣red from the pollutions of the World. 1 Pet. 1.15, 16. Act. 7.3. Lev. 20.26. Zach. 14 20, 21. 2 Thes. 2.13. [God receives not to glory, who are not first partakers of Grace.] Heb. 12.14. Mat. 23.25. Q Might not God as well bring us to Heaven without sanctification; forgive our sinnes, and more adoe? A. No: Because Christ is unto us san∣ctification, as well as redemption; that so he might deliver us from all the evill of sin; that is, from the power of sin, as well as from the guilt of sin: Grace is no burthen to him that hath it; nay it is a greater mercy to bring us to Heaven, through sanctification and adoption, making us his Sons, then absolutely to forgive our sins. [As it is a greater honour to be the Son of a King, then his favourite.] 1 Cor. 1.30. Gal. 2.17, 18. Q. What followes of all this Doctrine of the New Covenant, as to the wicked? A. It follows, That no wicked, grace∣lesse, impenitent person, hath any thing to doe with the Covenant of Mercy and Peace. Esa. 4.3, 4. Mar. 7.23. 1 Ioh. 1.6. Rom 8.9. Rev. 21.27.
Q. What comfort ariseth hereof to the godly? A. They are hereby assured, as by a witnesse within themselves, that God is their God, and they his children: The heart pondereth the promises, and sees him∣selfe taken into Christ, and his name writ∣ten in Heaven.] 1 Joh. 5.10. 2 Pet. 1.10, 11. 2 Cor. 1.22. [These graces are not matter of conjecture, but of experience and feeling, they find that they obey Gods call, heare his voyce, believe, repent, &c. these Graces are as the seal sealed; the Spi∣rit of God is the seal sealing, which makes that holy stampe and impression on our hearts.] Q. But my faith and graces be weak, and I often fall. A. If they be sound, in truth and sincerity, it is enough: Our graces do not save us; tis Christ that saveth, who is made unto us righteousnesse, &c. 1 Cor. 1.30. But these Graces evidence our Being in Christ, 2 Cor. 5.17. and our future Glory, being made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of Saints in light. Col. 1.12.

It is a Forme of sound and whole∣some words, teaching us what we must believe concerning God, and the Church of God. 2 Tim. 1.13. Q. It is not then a prayer? A. No; it doth not contain matter of petition, but of profession of faith; as the ge∣sture of standing up doth also shew. It belongs to the Honour and Worship of God, that we make confession of our Faith. Rom. 10.9.

[And such an one we shall finde him to be.] 1 Tim. 1.17. Exod. 34.6, 7. Q. Is it needfull to know these Pro∣perties to be in God? A. Yes: We must have an assured knowledge that he is Almighty, perfectly good, the Fountaine of all Goodnesse; else we should not believe on him, nor feare him, nor love him; nor depend on him for good things. Rom. 10.10, 14. Heb. 11.6. Q. What is it to believe in God? A. To believe God, is, to believe that God is, and that he is true: But to believe in God, is, to rest and relie on him for salvation, and for all things else that be good for me. Iam. 2.19. Eph. 1.13. Esa. 26.4.

Not by the power of nature, as we are of two Parents, but by the power of the holy Ghost, which did frame his body of the substance of the Virgin Mary, and u∣nited it to the Godhead, Luk 1.35. Joh. 3.13. Eph. 4.9.
Q. All that be borne of women be sin∣ners: How came Christ to be conceived and borne without sin? A. Because he was conceived by the power of the holy Ghost, who did separate originall sinne from his nature. Luk. 1.35. that holy thing. Heb. 7.26. Heb. 4.15. Q. Why must Christ be without sin? A. Because else he could not save sin∣ners, Heb. 7.27, 28. Else he must, like the High Priest, offer for his own sins, as well as for the peoples. Q. Why was he borne of a Virgin? A. To answer the Prophesies; that hereby it might appeare, that he was the true Messias spoken of by the Prophets. Esay 7.14. Ier. 31.22. Heb. 7.3. Q. Why of that Virgin, of the stock of David and Abraham? A. Because the promised seed was to come out of the loynes of Abraham: [Sal∣vation is of the Jewes.] Gen. 12.3. Gen. 22.18. Gal. 3.16. Joh. 4.22. Q. What do you believe in this Arti∣cle? A. That the eternall Son of God, re∣maining God, did take my nature on him, and in that nature did satisfie for my sins: [In which, being now advanced to Gods
right hand, he doth execute, as Mediator, all things belonging to the Kingdome of God.] Q. How doth the true beliefe of this Article affect our hearts? A. In that wonderfull Person I admire Gods infinite wisdome and love, in con∣triving and working mans salvation: [As he is in himselfe a wonderfull Person, so he is to me: I look to the man that is Gods fellow, and dwels in the everlasting burning.] Eph. 3.8, 9, 10. Zach. 13.7. CAP. XIX Of Christs sufferings, & the vertue of them. Suffered under Pontius Pilate. Q. DID Christ suffer for himselfe? A. No; He was no debtor to the Law; and therefore what he suffered was for us, and in our stead, as our surety. Esa. 53.4 5, 6. Heb 9.9. 1 Pet. 3.18. 2 Cor. 5.21. Heb, 7.22. Mat. 3.14, 15. Dan. 9.26. Rom. 4.25. Q. What did Christ suffer in our stead? A. The whole punishment due to out sinnes, the whole wrath of God in his
soule and body, which we should have suffered, Esay 53.4, 10. Mat: 26.38, 39. Rev. 19.15. 1 Pet: 2.24. Psal: 22.14. Rom. 8.32. Q. When did he suffer all these things? A. Especially in the garden, where he swet clots of blood, before any hand was laid on him; and on the Crosse, by the space of six houres, Luk: 22.43, 44. Mat: 27.46. Psal: 22.1, 6. Mar: 14.33, 34. Phil. 2.8 [So heavy was the wrath of God, that an An∣gell came to comfort him, yea he roared as a man forsaken, &c.] Q. What is the vertue and efficacy of his sufferings? A. By his stripes we are healed, Es: 53 5. Heb: 9.14, 26, 28. Col: 2.14. Heb: 10.2, 10, 12, 14. [In him we all died, and were con∣demned, and his death tooke away our condemnation, 2 Cor: 5.14.] Rom: 8.3. Q. For whom did Christ suffer all this? A. For his Body, the Church: [Christs blood is of value to save all men; but it was not intended for them that perish: Christ stood not in their stead, for then they should not dye themselves.] Eph: 5.25. Joh: 10.15. Q. How know you that you have a
part in Christ's sufferings? A. Because the life and power of sin is killed in me, and I now live to him that died for me. [Sinne is of all things most odious to me.] 2 Cor. 5.15. Rom. 6.3, 6. 1 Joh 5.6 The merit of Christs death reacheth unto God, to satisfie and pacifie him; and the vertue or efficacie of it reach∣eth to our soules, to mortifie and kill sin in them, 1 Pet: 4.1, 2. Q. Who was Pontius Pilate? A. The Roman Judge that condemned him, because he said that he was the Son of God, the King of Israel, Joh: 19 7, 8, 12, 15, 19, 21. Mat: 20.19. [a signe that the Messiah was come, because the government was taken from them, and now in the hands of a stranger, Gen. 49.10. Joh: 18.31.] Rev. 11.8. where Christ was slaine. Q. Why was he thus legally condem∣ned, and not killed privily. A. Because that death alone is satisfa∣ctory to the Law, which publike authori∣ty doth inflict on Malefactours; [for though Christ were no Malefactor, no guile was found in his lips; he was inno∣cent by the Judges owne mouth, yet he was numbred amongst the transgressors.] Esay 53.12. Mat. 20.18, 19.
Q. What kind of death died he? A. He was crucified; which was a pain∣full, shamefull, and accursed death, Ioh. 19.18, 31. Phil. 2.8. Deut. 21.23. Q. Why that kinde of death? A. Because he was to remove the curse from us, therefore he was to be made a curse for us. Gal. 3.13. Q. Dead: Why died he? A. Because death is the wages of sin; and sin is not remitted without shedding of blound, Rom. 6.23. Heb. 9.22. 1 Cor. 15.56, 57. Heb. 2.9, 14. Q. Buried: Why so? A. That he might sweeten the grave to us, and be God both of the dead and of the living, Mat. 12.40. Rom. 14.9. 1 Cor. 15.55. Q. Descended into Hell: When Christ gave up the Ghost, his Body was put in∣to the Grave, and his Soule went into Pa∣radise, being commended into the hands of God, as the soule of Steven, and other the faithfull are; & as the soule of the converted theef was. What then is meant here by Christs descending into Hell? A. His Soule went not into the place of the damned; but thereby is meant, his abiding prisoner under the dominion of
Death the space of three daies.Bp. Ushers answer to the Irish Jesuits challenge. c. 8. [As Jonas was three daies in the Whales belly, and saw no corruption. But David doth, &c.] Compare Psal. 16.10. with Act. 2.27, 31. Act. 13.34.35. Rom. 6.9. Mat. 12.40. Q. What is the substance of that you believe in this Article? A. I believe that Christ suffered the whole punishment belonging unto sinners, both in his Soule and Body, when he offe∣red up himselfe a curse and a sacrifice for sin; and that by his sufferings Gods wrath is pacified towards me, [& all the spiritu∣all enemies of my salvation are thereby vanquished.] CAP. XX. Of Christs exaltation & sitting at the right hand of God the Father. The third day he rose again from the dead. Q. DID Christ still remain in the the grave? A. No the third day he rose againe: Luke. 24.3, 6. Act. 2.24. Act. 1.3. 1 Cor. 15.4, 8. Q Why was it needfull that Christ should rise againe? A. 1. Because else we were still in our
sinnes; else it doth not appear that our sinnes be satisfied for. 1 Cor. 15.17. 1 Pet. 1.3, 21. [Christ was not onely to suffer Death and the Law, but to conquer them; which he had not done, if he had been still holden of death; and we must have looked out for another Saviour that could con∣quer it. The debtor comes not out of pri∣son, till he hath paid the utmost farthing, &c. If any one sin had beene unsatisfied, Christ had no risen from the dead.] Q. Why else must Christ rise againe? A. That he might apply effectually unto us the merit of his death, 1 Cor. 15.16, 54, 55. Rom. 4.25. Rev. 1.18. He ascended into Heaven. Q. What became of Christ after he was risen? A. After he had spent forty daies in teaching his Apostles the things belong∣ing to the Kingdome of God, he went up into Heaven in that same body which had been crucified and buried. Act. .3.9, 10, 11. Eph. 4.10. Luk. 24.51. Eph. 1.20, 22. Q. What good is that to us? A. 1. It assureth us, that he hath finish∣ed the worke of our redemption (which
his Father gave him to doe) in an accep∣table manner, Iohn 16.10. Iohn 17.4, 5. Heb. 9.12, 25. Heb. 10.12. If Christ had not fulfilled the Law, and satisfied for all out debt; if he had not in all things well pleased his Father, he had never got into Heaven: But now God welcomes him to Heaven, and bids him, Sit thou at my right hand, untill I make thine enimies thy Foot-stoole. Heb. 1.3, 9, 13. Q. What else doth it assure us of? A. 2. It assureth me, that seeing Christ is entred into Heaven in our name, & hath taken possession for us of the purchased in∣heritance, that therefore he will bring us thither in his appointed time, Ioh. 12.26. Ioh. 17.24. Heb. 6.20. Sitteth at the right hand of God. Q Where is Jesus Christ now? A. In Heaven at Gods right hand, in great glory and power. Act. 7.56. 1 Pet▪ 3.22. Q. God hath no right hand, nor left hand: What then is the meaning of it? A. It signifieth that Honour and Power which Christ received of his Father when he had finished the worke of our redem∣ption,
Heb. 1.13. Mat. 22.44. Eph: 1.20, 22. 1 Cor: 15.24, 25. Q. What does Christ do there? A. He makes intercession for us, that is, he presents our prayers, and pleads his merits for our acceptance, Heb: 7.25. & 9.24. Ro: 8.34. [He entereth our appearance, and causeth that no wrath issue out a∣gainst us, though our sins cry for venge∣ance.] God never said to Saint or Angel, Sit thou at my right hand, Heb: 1.13.] Q. Doe we not want him more to be with us here on earth? A. No; He doth us more good in Hea∣ven, appearing for us in the presence of God upon all occasions, [and yet he is here with us in his Majesty, Headship, & Grace, though not in his Body,] Joh: 16.7. Joh: 14.28. Our businesse lieth in Heaven with God; and it is best that Christ be there, Heb: 4.14. Q. How doth this affect the Heart of the believer? A. It comforts me, in assurance that it shall not goe ill with the Church, or any Member thereof, as long as Christ is at Gods right hand [Pull Christ from Gods right hand, and then you may over∣throw the Church and children of God]

A All that have departed this life from the beginning of the World, they shall come againe with their owne bodies,
Rev: 20.12. Joh. 5.28, 29. Q Whereof shall they be judged? A. All men shall give account of them∣selves, as their workes and waies have been. 2 Cor. 5.10. Rom. 2.5, 6, 12, 16. 1. Cor. 4.5.

[And then shall be made an e∣verlasting separation between men & men, betweene godly and wicked, betweene chaffe and wheat; the one to everlasting joy, the other to everlasting punishment with the Divell and his Angels for ever∣more.] Mat 25.41. Mat. 24 40. Mat: 13.30, 38, 41, 49. Here we live together, and work together, and eate together, and Pray and Heare together: but then the separation shall be made, the Godly shall be taken, and the Wicked left, and cast in to the furnace of fire. Q. What followes of the true beliefe of this Article? A. It makes me carefull so to order the
matter, that I may be found of Him in peace; not willingly going on in any course in which I would be loath to be found at the last day: [I would not at that day stand and appear among Non-residents, Usurers, Swearers, &c. and therefore I hate those courses now.] 2 Pet. 3.11, 14. 1 Pet. 1.17. 2 Cor. 5.9, 11, 12. Mat. 24 46, so doing. I believe in the Holy Ghost. Q. Who is the Holy Ghost? A. The third Person of the blessed Tri∣nity, equall, and of the same substance with the Father and the Sonne, proceed∣ing from the Father and the Son, 1 Ioh. 5.7. Mat. 28.19. Iohn. 15.26. Ioh. 14.26. Ioh. 16.15. Gal. 4.6. Esa. 48.16. with Rom: 8.9. Q. What is the office and worke of the Holy Ghost in mans salvation? A. It is to make us holy, to sanctifie, wash, and renew our hearts and lives; fil∣ling us with all spirituall graces, and thereby sealing up the love of God unto our hearts, Matth. 3.11. Ioh. 3.5. 1 Cor. 6.11. Tit. 3.5. Rom. 8.16. 2 Cor. 1.22. The work of the holy Ghost is to be a Sanctifier & a Comforter.
Q. What doe you believe in this Ar∣ticle? A. I believe, that as Christ redeemed the Church, so the Holy Ghost sanctifieth it; and that through sanctification of the Spi∣rit, I shall receive the inheritance purcha∣sed by Christ; [or, I depend upon him for sanctification and salvation] our salvation being among those workes of God which are externall, that is, terminated in the creature; it is the work of the whole Tri∣nity, Eph. 1.5. Act. 20.28. Rev. 1.4, 5. only as there is an order in their subsistence, so there is in their operations,] 2 Thes. 2.13. Tit. 3.5. Q. How may it appeare that you be∣lieve in the Holy Ghost? A. 1. Because my hope and confidence for mercy, is not seperated from, nor grea∣ter then is my care to be sanctified:Triall of this faith. or be∣cause I desire sanctification of the Spirit, as well as justification by Christ. Rom. 8.1.13. Psal. 51.9, 10. Q How else may this be known? A. Because I will not grieve the holy Spirit of God, but doe endeavour to fol∣low and be led by the motions, counsels, and directions of the Spirit, and not of the flect, Rom. 8.14. Eph. 4.30 [I beg the
Spirit to do all my workes in me, a spi∣rit of revelation and renovation; a spirit of consolation and confirmation, &c. CAP. XXII. Of the Church of God. I believe the holy Catholicke Church. Q. THE gathering of the Church is a fruit of Christs death and exaltation: Tell me what is meant by the Church of God? A. The company of Gods Elect, called and separated from the rest of mankind, and united unto Christ their head by faith 1 Cor. 1.2. Gal. 1.15. 1 Pet. 2.9. Heb. 12.23. Eph. 5.23, 25, 26. The rest are the Church by calling and profession only. Q. From what are they called? And unto what are they called? A. From sinne, and the power of dark∣nesse, unto Faith & true Repentance; from love of the world, to the love of God; from carelessenesse, to conscience of plea∣sing God. Col. 1.13. 1 Thes. 1.9. 1 Thes: 4.7. 1 Pet. 1.14, 15. Act. 26.18. Q. By what meanes are they called? A. Outwardly by the Word preached, which inwardly is made effectuall by the
Holy Ghost to their conversion. 1 Thes. 1.5. Act. 16.14. 1 Cor. 3.6, 7, 9. 2 Cor. 3.3. [There is an outward calling, and an out∣ward joyning to the Church. Mat. 20.16. 1 Ioh. 2.19. Rom. 9.4, 5. But this sa∣veth none without the inward calling, & spirituall ingrafture into Christ. Ioh. 15.2.19. Gal. 1.15. 1 Pet. 2.5. Eph. 2.19, 20, 21. Col. 2.19. Q. These called ones, How be they di∣stinguished? A. Part of them be in Heaven,The Church Militant & Trium∣phant, what it is. having a finished their blessed course, and are called the Church triumphant: And part is yet on Earth, b combating and striving with corruptions, fears and temptations from within, and from Satan, and are therefore called the Church Militant. a Rev. 7.13, 16, 17. Rev: 14 13. Heb. 12.23. 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. b Eph. 6.13. Q. Why is the Church called holy? A. Because it is made holy by the Word and Spirit; so that no ungodly person is of the Church, though he be in the Church Rom. 2.29. Rom. 9.6. 1 Ioh. 2.19. Q. Why is it called Catholick? A. Because this company is gathered, not out of one place or people, but out of all Nations, Languages and Peoples, and in
all ages of the world. Rev. 7.9. Rev. 5.9. Q. What be the signes by which the societies of men, professing the faith of Christ, may be known to be the true Chur∣ches of Christ? A. The true Church of God on earth is known by two markes; 1. By the puri∣ty of Doctrine and Faith which they hold and teach. 2. And by the purity of Worship preserved amongst them from pollutions of Idolatry, and Superstition: [Pure faith, and pure worship, shew a true Church.] Jude vers. 3. Acts 24.14. Hos. 2.2, 4, 5. [Pa∣pists call themselves Catholicks but falsely being both Heriticall in Doctrine, & Ido∣latrous in Worship: a Catholicke is a right believer: All true believers in the world make but one Catholick Church; as there is but one Christ, one Faith, one Baptisme, one Heaven, and one way to life eternall, Eph. 4.5, 6. Heb. 11.40. Those people that maintaine Heresy, or Idolatry, are not the true Churches of Christ. Col. 2.16, 19. 2 Cor. 6.15 Rev. 18.4. Q. Doe you believe in the Church? A. No; there is no trust nor helpe in man for matters of salvation, Ps. 49.7, 8, Mic. 6.7. Q. What then doe you believe?
A. I believe that God ever had, and ever, will have, to the end of the world, a company of faithfull people to serve him; and that I am one of the number. Q. How doe you know that you are one of the Church? A. Because I am not of the world, but have seperated my selfe from the evill manners, and sinfull courses thereof; and doe now heare and follow the voice of Christ. Joh. 10.16. Gal. 1.4. Rom. 12.2. CAP. XXIII. Of the Communion of Saints. Q. WHat meane you by the com∣munion of Saints? A. I meane, that this holy People have a spirituall fellowship with Christ their Head, and one with another. [The members of the Church are coupled together with Christ their Head, and one with another] Eph. 4.4, 6. 1 Joh. 1.3. Q. Wherein have they a fellowship with Christ their Head? A. In all the priviledges & riches which God hath bestowed on the man Christ; as in his sufferings, in his graces, righteousnesse
and Kingdome. [Christ is a Son, so are we; Christ is justified from our sinnes, so are we: As Christ the first borne is, such are we in relation unto God] Rom. 8.17. Joh. 14.19. Eph. 5.30, 32. Joh. 17.24. Joh. 1.16. These places shew, that the true believer hath a fellowship with Christ in his Son∣ship, in his Life, in his Graces, in his King∣dome. Q. By what bonds is this spirituall union betwixt Christ and your soule made up? A. They be two; one coming from Christ to us, and that is his a Spirit, whereby he doth apprehend and quicken us; the other going from us to Christ, and b that is our faith, whereby we embrace & hold him fast. [By these two we are knit unto Christ, and so partake of all his riches.] a 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. 1 Cor. 6.17. Rom. 8, 9. b Eph. 3.17. Heb. 3.14. Rom. 11.20. Q. How doth it appear that you have communion with Christ the Head? A. By this I know it; because I have the same Spirit of Christ, whereby I am confor∣med and made like unto him in all things; his will and waies, his friends and foes be mine, [even as if the same soule were in two bodies, they would move alike, and affect the same things.] Col. 2.19. 1 Ioh. 4.

They are all partakers of one Hope, one Spirit, one Faith, one Baptisme, and all goe one way to Heaven. [And are all confederate with Christ, to serve him accor∣ding to the covenant of faith and obedi∣ence, against all sects, heresies, mis-be∣lievers, and loose livers whatsoever.] 1 Cor. 10.1, 4. 2 Pet. 1.1. Eph. 4.5, 13. Phil. 1.27. Zeph. 3.9. Q. In love: How? A. By that one Spirit, whereof all par∣take, we are united together in love; so that all the faithfull doe love a and e∣steeme each of other, and b communi∣cate each to other in all good things, e∣ver wishing well to the prosperity of Gods Church and cause in all the World. a Philem. v. 16, 17. 1 Ioh. 5.1. 1 Pet. 2.17. b Act. 2, 42, 45, 46. Act. 4.32. 1 Cor. 12.13, 25. Psal. 137.6. Q. How are the members of the Church called Saints, seeing in many things they sin?
A. Because they are made holy in part, and are perfectly holy in Christ, [We must be Saints here, else we shall never be Saints in Heaven.] Eph. 1.1. Heb. 12.14. CAP. XXIV. Of forgivenesse of sinnes. Q. WHat is sinne? A. Any transgression of Gods Law. 1 John 3.4. Gen. 3.11. Q. What is the punishment due to sin∣ners? A. Eternall death, the curse of God for ever in Hell fire. Rom. 6.21, 23. Mat. 25.41. Q. Are you a sinner? A. Yes: I was borne in sinne, and doe daily break Gods holy Lawes. Psal. 51.5. Rom. 5.14. There is sinne in Infants. Q. Shall you then be damned in Hell fire? A. I deserve damnation; but I believe that through Christ my sinnes shall be forgiven me. Rom 8.1. Q. Are sinnes forgiven in this life? A. Yes: now or never. 1 Joh. 2.12. Col. 1.13. Mat. 9.2. Rev. 2.17. Rom. 5.5. The
conscience is now absolved, and it shall be hereafter declared solemnely before Men and Angels. Act. 3.19. Q. What is forgivenesse of sinnes? A. It is a free and full discharge of a sinner from the guilt & punishment of sin; so that in Gods sight they are as if they had never been. Esa. 43.25. Mic. 7.18, 19. Rom. 8.33, 34. The afflictions and mise∣ries which the Godly endure in this World, are not punishments for sin, in a way of justice, and satisfaction for sin, (as if they were the cause why sins are forgi∣ven to us) 1. Because Christ alone hath borne the chastisement of our peace, and none of the people with him. 2. Because the afflictions of the Godly are for the good of the party afflicted, and not in a way of revenge, to satisfie divine justice. 3. And not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us. Q. Who doth forgive sinnes? A. God alone, who is offended and dishonoured by them. Mar. 2.7, 9. Lu. 23.34. Men doe forgive one another the Trespasse, but not the sin, as it is sin. Q. Why, and for whose sake, doth God forgive sinnes? A. For Christs sake, without respect to
any thing that we can doe, or suffer. 1 Iob. 2 12. Act. 2.38. Eph. 4.32. Rom. 3.24. Q. Why for Christs sake? A. Because he being surety of the New Covenant, hath in my nature, room, and stead, answered the Law, & pacified Gods wrath. 2 Cor. 5.21. Heb. 7.22. Q To what manner of persons is re∣mission of sins granted in the Gospell? A. To them only that believe, & repent, and amend their lives, and turne from the evill of their doings. Luk 13.3. Mar. 16.16. Ezek. 18.21. Esay 1.18. Act. 16.31. Joh. 5.24. Q. Do you think in your conscience that your sins in particular be forgiven? A. Yes; that is it I believe in this Ar∣ticle: namely that I am of the number of those that have their sins forgiven them. 1 Ioh. 5.13 Rom. 10.9. Q. What signes be there that your sins be forgiven you? How will you know it? A. By three signes. 1. Where sin is for∣given, it is subdued and purged out. [The issue of our corruption is stanched and dried up, when once we have touched Christ by faith, & have his bloud sprink∣led on our consciences. Mar. 5.29. Act. 3.26. Rom. 6.11, 14. [Peace, without Grace, is
not of Gods sending, it is a false peace: but if we be healed and clensed of sinne, we are forgiven, though we feare the contra∣ry. Col. 2.13.] Q. What other signe and effects fol∣lowes upon our beliefe that our sins be forgiven? A. The perswasion that God hath for∣given me, begets in my heart a strong love, and high prizing of Jesus Christ. Luk. 7.42, 47. Zach. 12.10. 2 Cor. 5.14. Q. What thirdly is a signe that your sin is forgiven you? A. It makes me ready to a forgive o∣thers, and to b pity them that goe on in their sinnes impenitently, as I my selfe have done heretofore. a Eph. 4.31, 32. Mat. 18.32, 33. b Luk. 22.32. CAP. XXV. Of resurrection of the flesh, and ever∣lasting life. Q. SHall they that be dead live a∣gaine? A. Yes; at the last day every one shall come againe with his own body. Act. 24.15. Iude. v. 14.

Yes, the same bodies, made free from all defects and weaknesses, unto which we are now subjected. 1 Cor. 15.43, 53. Phil. 3.2 1. Joh. 5.28, 29. Rev. 20.12. Q. How doch the beliefe of the resur∣rection work upon you? A. It makes me keep a conscience void of offence before God and men, continu∣ing in well-doing with courage and pa∣tience. [I will not be corrupted with worldly honours or pleasures.] Act. 24.16. 1 Cor. 15.33, 34, 58. 2 Cor. 9.10. Heb. 11.35. And the life everlasting. Q. When a man dies, his body goes to the grave: Doth the soule die with the body, like the beasts? A. No; the soule is an immortall sub∣stance, and separated from the body at death. Eccles. 12.7. 1 King. 17.21. Luk. 23: 43, 46. Mat. 22.32. 2 Cor. 5.6, 8. Luk. 12.5. Q. Whither then goe the souls of them that depart hence?
A. To Heaven, or to Hell, to everlasting life, or to everlasting death; immediately after their dissolution. Luk. 16.22, 23. Heb. 9.27. Col. 1.20. Rev. 14.13. Rev. 6.9. Phil. 1.23. 2 Cor. 5.8. Q. Then there is no Purgatory, or third place, where, as in a prison, by enduring exquisite torments, the soules that were not fully purged in this life, doe make satisfaction for veniall sins, and lighter faults; or for their temporall punishment due to their mortall sinnes, which they have committed? from which Purgatory they say they are delivered by the prayers of the living, and the Popes indulgencies; or at least at the day of judgement, if they chance to lye there so long. A. No; for as there be but two sorts of men, godly or wicked, sheep or goats, re∣generate or unregenerate: so there be but two places provided for them, where they remaine in an unchangeable estate of blisse, or woe: [All a wicked men, of what profession soever, being punished with e∣verlasting perdition from the presence of God: and b all the faithfull are present with the Lord, their soules being fully purged from all spot of sin; and the fault c quite remitted through the bloud of
Christ. a 2 Thes. 1.9. Mat. 25.41, 46, Rom. 2.9. b 2 Cor. 5.6, 8. Rev. 14.13. c 1 Joh. 1.7. Eph. 5.27. Q. What is meant by life everlasting? A. It is the glorious state of the Elect after this life, wherein they do immediate∣ly enjoy God & Christ for ever, in a most holy, happy, unutterable and unchange∣able communion. 1 Joh. 3.2. Rev: 22.4. Rev. 21.3, 4. 1 Thes. 4.17. Psal. 16.11. 1 Cor. 2.9. Q. For whom is eternall life prepared? To whom is it given? A. To them that walke with God, a finishing their course in feare & holinesse; and b endeavouring to glorify God here on earth. a Mat. 5.8. Heb. 12, 14. Joh. 10.27, 28. Rev. 21.27. Rev. 22.14. b Ioh. 17.4. 2 Tim. 4.8. Mat. 25.21. Q What doe you believe in this Ar∣ticle? A. I believe that at the last day my soule and body shall be joyned together a∣gaine, and that in both I shall enjoy the presence of God for evermore. Tit. 1.2. 1 Thes. 4.17. 1 Ioh. 2.25. Q. Why doe you think that you shall enjoy this blessed life? A. Because the life of grace is already
begunne in me, which shall end in glory. 1 Joh: 3.3. Mat. 19.28, 29. Rom. 6.22. Phil. 1.6. 1 Pet. 1.23 Q. May a Christian be assured of ever∣lasting life, before he depart this present life? A. Yes he may, and that upon sure and infallible grounds, out of Gods Word, wherein we clearly see Gods promises & purposes towards them that be ef∣fectually called. [Faith is a sure know∣ledge of a thing upon the authority of divine revelation, which cannot deceive, nor be deceived.] Joh. 3.36. 1 Joh: 5.11.12. 1 Joh. 4.10, 14, 19, 24.

The office and work of faith is twofold; to 1. Justify the person▪ 2. Purify the heart. CAP. XXVI. Of the fruit and office of faith, viz. to justify, and of the meanes how faith is wrought. Q. WHat Benefits redound to thee of this beliefe? A. Two. 1. By Faith I am righteous before God, and heire of eternall life; not because my faith of it selfe can make me righteous, but because the righteousnesse of Christ is my righteousness before God; and I cannot apply it to my selfe by any other way then by faith. [God offereth us life and righteousnesse in Christ; and faith is the hand by which we recieve that gift.] Rom. 4.5, 6. Joh. 6.35. 1 Joh. 5.11, 12, 13. Rom. 3.24, 25. Q. Say the same in other tearmes. A. When I say, we are justified by faith, I meane the object of faith, Christ Jesus. [The onely way and meane to embrace Christ, and to rest on the promises of the Gospell, is by faith:] Phil. 3.9. The only
righteousnesse by which a sinner stands just before God, is the righteousnesse of Christ; and the onely meanes, to partake of that righteousnesse, is by Faith, Rom. 9.32. Q. It seemes then that faith is a most ex∣cellent gift of God, which bringeth us into the possession of Gods rich mercies, and tender love revealed in the Gospell? A. It is so; and therefore above all things we must labour for the grace of faith. John 6.29. Joh. 3.18. Act. 16.31. Heb. 4.2, 11. Heb. 3.12, 14, 19. Q. Can we attaine it of our selves by our own strength? A. No; a it is the gift of God; our hearts are b slow to believe, being natu∣rally inclined to distrust God, and to trust in the creatures; and therefore c God by his holy Spirit draweth our hearts to embrace his gratious promises. a Heb. 12.2. Eph. 2.8. b Luk. 24.25. Mar. 9.24. Num. 20.12. 2 Chron. 16.7, 9. Mat. 14.31. Luk. 18.9. c 1 Cor. 2.9, 11. Joh. 6.44, 45. Q. Why must we strive, seeing it is Gods gift? A. Yes; because God hath appointed means whereby he will bestow all graces on us; & therefore if we seek him in those
meanes, we shall find him; & if we neglect those meanes, it is a signe we have no grace, nor can we ever hope to have any. Mar. 4.24. 1 Cor. 3.7, 9. Rom. 10.14, 15. Prov. 2.1, 2, 3. Mat. 13.44. Act. 16.14. 1 Cor. 12.6. Q. Why secondly must we strive? A. Because faith and all other graces be contrary to our corrupt nature, and therefore we must give the more dili∣gence to attaine the same at Gods hand. [As he that plants a graft contrary to na∣ture, must use the more care; and because we cannot cure our selves, we must seek and beg some one to put us into the pool when the waters be moved.] Phil. 2.12, 13. Esay 26.12. Heb. 6.11, 12. Rom. 11.24. 2 Pet. 1.10. Q. By what meanes doth God usually worke faith in us? A. By two Meanes. 1. By the know∣ledge of the Law, convincing us of sin. Mat. 3.2, 3. Ioh. 16.9. Rom. 4.15. Gal. 3.22, 24. This is but preparative. Hos. 10.12. Q. But what is the chiefe meanes by which God doth worke faith in us? A. By the preaching of the Gospell, by which it is also encreased. [And therefore if we desire to have faith, we must heare
and obey the Gospell; the Word of the Kingdome must be rooted in our hearts and affections.] 1 Pet. 1.23. 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. Rom. 1.16. Luk. 8.13, 15 Gal. 3.2. Q. How doth the Doctrine of the Go∣spell bring about the heart from security, and false confidences, to believe on Christ for salvation? A. Two waies especially.To rest in any thing short of Christ; is a false con∣fidence. 1. By invi∣ting us to come unto Christ: The Spirit doth convince us of sin, and damnation, and that we have need of the righteous∣nesse of another to save us. Luk. 13.3. Joh. 16.9. Joh. 5.45. Joh. 8.24. Phil. 3, 3, 8.9. Matt. 9 13. [By the law is the knowledge of sinne: but to make us fly from the Law, and to be dead to it, and to seeke salvation by a righteousnesse with∣out us, this is the worke of the Gospell. Rom. 7.4. The Gospell inviting, comman∣ding, and calling us to Christs righteous∣nesse, it doth cause us to renounce and forsake all hope of righteousnesse by works of the Law; the Gospell puts a spirit into the letter of the Law: The Gospell awaking us, and bidding us to repent, and goe to Christ for salvation, doth make use of the Law, to shew us our danger and our insufficiency to save our
selves, and consequenly, a necessity of believing in Christ. Q. How secondly doth the Gospell work the heart to believe? A. 2. By shewing us such a fulnesse and al sufficiency in Christ, that of him, and in him, we have all things needfull for salvation: [it shewes and assures the conscience, that God is satisfied, and well pleased with us in Christ.] Act. 13.32, 33, 34. John 1.16, 17. Col. 1.13, 14, 19. Q. What followes thereof? A. Therefore they that meddle not with the Scripture, & regard not the Ministry of it on the Lords day, but slight it, or scoffe at the preaching thereof, shew plainly that they have no faith, Rom. 15.4. Rom. 10.14, 17. CAP. XXVII. Of the second office & worke of Faith, viz. to purify the heart, & worke by love: Here fol∣lowes the life of a believer, and the first end and use of the Morall Law. Fourth heal of Christian doctrine.Q. WHat is the second office of Faith?
A. To purify the heart, working it to an obedient walking in all the Command∣ments and Ordinances of the Lord, [so that I shall not professe one thing, and do another] Jam: 2.17, 21, 26. Act: 15.9. [it is ever purging out corruption.] Q. The rule of obedience, in generall, is the whole written word of God, and more summarily the morall Law, contained in the ten Commandements: Tell me now; Is the Law of the ten Commandements still in force? A. Yes; and whosoever doth, or teach∣eth otherwise, shall be least in the Kin∣dome of Heaven, that is none at all, Mat: 5.18, 19. Rom: 3.19, 31. Rom: 7.12. As touching the ceremoniall Law, that which was a sin or duty then, is not a sin or duty now under the Gospel; and therefore the ceremoniall Law is not in force now, as to our practice. But as touching the morall Law, that which was a sin then, is a sin now, as lying, perjury, &c. which shewes that the morall Law is still in force now, under the time of the Gospel. Q. Is the Law given that we should looke for life and solvation by it? A. No? because by it all the world is guilty before God; [If we were without
sin, we should be saved by the Law: but being all wretched sinners, the Law curs∣eth us and we must looke elsewhere for a worthinesse to answer Gods judge∣ment.] Rom: 7.4, 6. Rom: 3.20. 23. Gal: 3.17 Q. To what use then was the Law gi∣ven? The first use of the Morall Law.A, There is a twofold use of it. 1. To convince us that we are under sin & wrath, that so we might be brought to seek sal∣vation in Christ alone. Gal. 3.19, 24. Q. How doth the Law force a sinner unto Christ? A. There be five effects or operations of the Law, whereby it drives one to Christ.  The first is, to make sin knowne in its true greatnesse and sinfulnesse, both for the extent and danger of it. [By the Law we come to know our selves to be greater sinners, and in worse case then we could imagine, we find and feele that to be sinne, which before we knew not; and many things to be greater evils, exposing us to greater wrath then heretofore we con∣ceived; as our naturall corruption, the first motions unto sinne, &c.] Rom: 3.20. Rom. 7.7, 8, 9, 13. Rom: 5.13. Q. What is the second worke of the Law forcing us to seek Christ?
A. It shews us how farre short we come, and how unable we are to doe any one thing that is good, in any measure, man∣ner, and degree, as is required. [Many think they are holy, and please God well enough, because they know not the holy∣nesse and rigour of the Law.] Rom. 7.11, 13, 18. Mat. 19.18, 20. Q. How, thirdly, doth the Law shew us our need of Christ? A. By it we finde and feele the emnity & contrariety that is in our nature against God: Tell a man of his sinne, or duty, O the heart is sad upon it, the Law is a bur∣then to him, the heart rebels against it, and could even wish there were no such Law, yea no God to take vengeance. [Sinne is a burthen to a regenerate person, but Gods Law is not grievous to him. 1 Joh. 5.3. On the other side, to a carnall man, sinne is pleasing, and duty a burthen: the duties of the Law being brought and pressed on the soule, doe shew how hollow and rot∣ten we are, which otherwise we should never have mistrusted by our selves.] Ro. 7.9, 9, 10, 13. Rom. 8.7. Q. What fourth worke of the Law bringeth a sinner to Christ? A. It worketh wrath, that is, it laies the
curse upon us; it proclaims the judgement of God against us for every sin: [It curs∣eth every disobedience; it tels every soule of us, thou art a domned creature, &c.] Ro. 1.18. Rom. 4.15. 2 Cor. 3.7, 9. The Law is full of rigour.  1. It accepts of no obedi∣ence, but what is every way full and per∣fect.  2. The Law admits of no excuses; It accepts of none of our sorrows.  3. The Law regards not what we can doe, but what we should doe: All that be under the Law, must doe it, or dye: This is the case of all that be out of Christ, the Law curseth them. Q. How fiftly doth the Law drive us unto Christ? A. When we see that we are shut up, and cannot winde our selves out of Gods wrathfull hands; the soul even drowned with sorrow and feare, is constrained to goe to Christ, upon the invitation of the Gospell: The soule does hereupon consult and advise with it selfe, what to doe to be saved, and so at length resolves to goe to Christ; this is one use of the Mo∣rall Law, viz. to make us see, 1. How vile we are. 2. How weak we are, 3. How wicked we are; what enemies to God and goodnesse. 4. How cursed we are.
5. And so to consult within our selves, and to resolve to goe to Christ, as that prodigall did, Luk. 15.17, 18. and those Lepers. 2 King. 7.3, 4. Thus the Law and the Gospell worke together for our salvation: it is not in me to save you, saith the Law, therefore seeke further: It is in me to save you, saith the Gospell, therefore rest in me. Act. 2.37. Mat. 11.28. Rom. 8.15. And so the soule is converted and drawn unto Christ by the Gospell, being driven from the Law, by the Law it selfe. CAP. XXVIII. Of the second end and use of the Morall Law. Q. WEE have seene the first maine use of the Morall Law: What is the second? A. To be a perpetuall rule of obedience and holinesse.Second Use of the Mo∣rall Law. [and it is therefore called the Morall Law.] Mat. 19.17. Rom. 2.25. Rom. 7.12. Heb. 8.10. 1 Tim. 1.5, 8. Jam. 2.10, 11. The Law shewes us what is good, and what is bad. Q. Our obedience is but in part here:
What be the properties of that obedience which God will accept of his servants? True obedi∣ence, what.A. 1. It must be a free, a loving, sub∣mitting of the b inward and outward man to the c whole will of God, with an in∣tention d and desire to please and approve our selves to him in every thing we doe. [This is the nature of true obedience; a the ground and rule of obedience, is the will of  God; b the creature obeying, is the in∣ward  and outward man; c the manner is free, without compulsion; d the end and aime of all, is to please God, not men, or our selves; and by these properties true obedience is differenced from meer civill honesty, & restraining grace in hypocrites] a Mat. 15.9. Esa 1.12. b Rom. 6.13, 17. c Psal. 40.8. & 119.6, 80. Mat. 5.20. Jam. 2.10. d H. s. 7.14. Zach. 7.5, 6 Rom. 14.6. Joh. 5.30. John 7.18. Esay 10.7. Mat. 6.6. Q. Is there any worthinesse in our works to procure to us Gods favour? A. None at all; our best works done before we be regenerate, are utterly cor∣rupt, and cannot please God. [The evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit.] Joh. 3.6. Rom. 8.8. Mat. 7.18. Phil. 3.8. Q. But what say you of the workes we performe after regeneration?
A. Though God in mercy, for Christs sake, doe accept of our endeavours to please him, yet our very best workes are stained with many imperfections. [And therefore have need of forgivenesse, &c.] Luk. 17.10. Rom. 7.21. Esa. 64.6. Tit. 3.5. Mat. 20.10, 14. When the Scripture speaks of rewarding our workes, Mat. 10.42. and Mat. 6.6. It is a reward of Grace, not of Debt; Neh. 13.22. Remember me, and spare me. The rewards of God must needs be full of Grace, seeing he promiseth to reward Begging and praying: and a cup of cold water, which is of little worth. Q. It seems then that God doth receive us into his favour, without any considerati∣on of our works, of his meer mercy in Christ alone, imputing his righteousnesse unto us, and not our frailties. A. It is most true; for we are saved by faith in Christ, without the works of the Law. Rom. 3.28. Rom. 11.6. Q. But doth justification by faith make men despisers of good duties contained in Gods Law? A. By no means; for faith is the very life and root of all good works. [And the reason, why many doe not performe works of obedience, is, because they have
not faith] Heb. 11.7, 8, 17, 25, 27. Iam. 2.22. Luk. 17.3, 5. Esay 7.4, 12. 1 Pet. 3.5. The more faith,Faith an∣swers all objections, it removeth carnall rea∣soning, and so brings the heart to obey in all things. the more obedience. Gal. 5.6. Q. The Law being the rule of obedi∣ence, we ought to be carefull to know it, and to lead our lives by it. A. Yes: For both he that knows it not, and he that obeyes it not, shall be beaten with many stripes. Luk. 12.47, 48. Q. How many Commandments be there? A. Ten: Ten words. Deut. 4.13. Q. What sorts of duties doth the Law of God containe? A. Two sorts. 1. Duties that immedi∣atly concern Gods Glory and Worship, in the foure first precepts. 2. And duties that more immediately respect our Neighbours good, in the six last. Mar. 12.29, 30, 31, 33. Mat. 22.37, 40. Thus are the Ten Com∣mandments divided. Q. What motives are there to stir us up to the keeping of this Law in all the points of it? A. Two. 1. Because God is the Law∣giver; God spake every one of those words; and where God hath a voyce to speake, we ought to have an eare to heare, and an heart to obey: God sets his stamp
upon them all. Iam. 4.12. Heb. 2.2. Rom: 7.12. The law is holy, just and good. Q. Why secondly must we carry an aw∣full regard to this Law? A. Because he is Jehovah, our God, our maker, our deliverer, and therefore may justly challenge obedience at his creatures hands. [Love and feare ought to keep us in obedience] Mal. 1.6. Es. 5.4. Deut. 10.12. Jer. 2.9, 13, 19. Mic. 6.3. Esay 43.23, 24. Deut. 7.6, 11. Deut. 26.17, 19. [the strongest and sweetest bond of obedience is that relation between God and us.] CAP. XXIX. Q. THe first Table of the Law of God containes foure Com∣mandments: What is the summe and substance of it? A. The first Table of the Law teacheth and requireth, 1. That I cleave unto God with my heart. 2. That I worship him with my soule and body, in the duties of Religion, and Divine Worship. 3. That I honour him with my Tongue and Life. 4. And that I carefully keepe his Sab∣baths.
Of the first Commandment. Thou shalt have no other Gods, &c. Q. WHat is the purpose of God in this first Command∣ment? A. That we should take Iehovah, the only true God, for our God, & set him up in our hearts in his due place, that is, above the creature;Of spirituall & inward worship. to love and feare him; to serve, trust and obey him. [We must re∣serve unto him all that preheminence of ho∣nour, feare, love and trust, which is due to him as a God, and not to give any part thereof to the creature. To honour a King as if he were but a private person, is not to give him his due, because it is be∣neath his place: God must have his full preheminence in our hearts.] Mar. 12.29, 30. Mat. 4.4, 10. Thus does Christ expound this Commandment. Q. What particular duties are comman∣ded under this generall, that so God may be thy God? A. Five. 1. I am hereby bound to know God in his Nature,1. Know∣ledge. Will, and Attributes, else I shall never love him, nor trust in him. 1 Chron: 28.9. Rom. 12.2. Ioh. 17.3. Ro. 10.14.
Q. What, secondly?2. Trust. A. We are bound to believe on him, to depend and stay our selves on him for e∣very good thing we need, not being dis∣heartned in our duties, nor stepping out to false helps in evill times. Jer: 17.5.7. 2 Chron: 20.20. Psal: 31.6, 7. Psal: 11.1, 2. Job 31.24. Jonah 2.8. Dan: 3.16. Dan: 6.23. Q. What, thirdly, is here required? Q. I am bound to love and delight in him as the chiefest good, above father,3. Love. lands credit, profit, or life it selfe. Mat: 10.37. 1 Sam: 2.29. Mat: 19.22, 29. Q. What fourth duty? A. I am bound to feare him,4. To feare him. to stand in awe of his Majesty, not daring to of∣fend him in any thing for any respect. [The object of godly feare, is the evill of sinne, the offending of God. 1 King: 8.3, 12. Esay 51.12. Esay 8.2, 13. Jer 2.19 [In all these God must have his full prehemi∣nence; for if we love, feare trust, or de∣light in any thing against God, or above God, then that is our God,] Q. What fifth duty is required? A. I am bound to acknowledge him, and to make outward profession,5. To con∣fesse him, that God is the Lord whom we serve; that he is gover∣nour,
preserver and rewarder of all men; the searcher of all hearts; and that no God can do as the doth: [There is none other to whom any of these can be ap∣plied.] Dan: 4.37. 1 Chron: 29.10, 11. Esay 26.13. 1 Cor: 1.31. Mar: 8.38. Jer: 10.6, 7. Q. What is the thing here generally forbidden? A. The thing here forbidden, is, the gi∣ving of any divine honour to the crea∣ture; the setting up of the creature in our hearts, to withdraw us from God. Q. Tell me particularly who be the transgressors of this Commandment? A. Seven sorts of persons. 1. All igno∣rant persons,Ignorance of God. that either (a) naturally, o (b) carelesly, or willingly remaine igno∣rant of God, and his will concerning us. (a) Eph: 4.17, 18. (b) Iob 21.14. Ioh 3.20 2 Pet: 3.5. Q. Who else? Disobedi∣ence.A. They that have knowledge severed from obedience; such as professe to know God, but in their works and waies deny him. [These doe not take Jehovah for their God.] Tit: 1.16. Rom: 1.8. Q. Who thirdly doe sinne against this Commandmemt?
A. All Atheists, and Idolaters; that is,Atheisme and Idola∣try. all such as think there is no God, or that there be more Gods then one; or that God is like to any thing made by Art, in Car∣ving and Painting—Also whosoever do give any divine honour, worship, and ser∣vice to any Creature: All such persons be either Atheists, or Idolaters; They fancy to themselves some other God. Rom. 1.23. Act. 14.15. 1 Cor. 8.3, 6, 10. Rev. 19.10. Rev. 22.9. Q. Who fourthly? A. All superstitions persons; that is,Superstiti∣on. such as ascribe any spirituall or supernatu∣rall effect (good or bad) to ceremonies, & observation of things; the observation whereof hath no ground in nature, nor di∣vine institution. [as to the crying & flying of birds, bleeding at the nose, the hare crossing us in our journey, &c. Also in Re∣ligion, ascribing supernaturall and spiritu∣all effects, worth, excellency, or acceptable∣nesse, to ceremonies devised by man; as to anointing with oile, signing with the crosse, sprinkling with Holy-water, conse∣cration of Temples, Vestmēts, Altars, &c.] Mar. 7.4, 5, 8. Col. 2.21. 1 Sam. 4.3. Ezek. 21.19, 21. Jer. 10.2, 3. It is Gods pre∣rogative to give grace, and also to insti∣tute
any sign or token of Grace, or to make any thing to be an effectuall meanes of ap∣plying any spirituall good to the soule; and therefore it is an injury done to God, to ascribe that which is due to him, unto mens inventions, &c. Q. Who, fiftly, be the transgressours of this Commandment? A. All such as seek to Wizards, Wiches, Conjurers, Soothsayers, or to Saint or Angel for help.Seeking to Witches for helpe. [All that step out of any unlawfull shifts in distresse, &c. all these doe forsake Jehovah, and cleave to the creature.] Deut. 18.9, 10. Act. 8.10, 11. 1 Chron. 10.13, 14. Esay 47.12, 13. Q. Who, sixtly? Unbeliefe & despare.A. They that doubt and despaire of Gods truth and love made knowne, and will not commit their soules and estates to him. [It is a sinne to doubt and re∣fuse any part of Gods truth and promi∣ses; the highest degree of unbeliefe, is de∣spaire.] Esa. 7.9. He. 3.19. Mat. 6.30. Joh. 20.25. Mat. 8.26. Job 27.10. Iob 15.22. These deny God the Honour due to him. To be asha∣med of God and godli∣nesse.Q. Who, lastly, be transgressours of this Commandement? A. All that be ashamed of God, and de∣ny him here before men in any degree; as
in his Word, Waies, Worship, Children and ordinances, Joh. 12.43. Luk. 22.57. 2 Tim. 4.16. Mat. 11.9. 2 Tim: 2.12. Q. What followes hereof? A. That if we doe not make consci∣ence of these duties, and care to avoid these sins, we be under the Law; that is, under the sentence of it, to be judged by it. [Where sinne reignes, the Law reignes, and is in force against thee.] Rom. 6.14. CAP. XXX. Of the second Commandement. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven Image. Q. WHat is the purpose of God in this Commandement? A. To preserve his outward worship pure and undefiled, from all superstition & Ido∣latry, from all inventions of man, and to keep us to that entire manner of worship which himself hath appointed: so is this Commandement expounded in Scripture▪ Num. 15.39. Deut. 12.30, 32. Psal. 106.38, 39. Esay 8.20.  Hence we learne, that
whatsoever is made use of, for the tendring up our Homage unto God, or for the conveying of any spirituall efficacy from God into the hearts of his servants; it must have an institution from God, else we sin against God, who alone hath power to give any grace, and to appoint the means of obtaining it. The first Com∣mandment requires, that we worship the only true God, and that we doe not give his properties and honour to another: the se∣cond Commandment prescribes the true manner of worshipping that true God. Q. Well then; here we are forbidden to worship God after our own wits and wils What is particularly forbiden in this kind? 1. Images for religi∣ous use.A. 1. The making of any Image, either of God, or of any Creature, for religious use, that is, to help us in our worshipping of God. [The likenesse and representati∣on of any thing whatsoever, is a false help und meane of worship.] Exod. 32.1, 4. Ps. 106.20. Jer. 10.8, 14, 15. Ezek. 8.10. Jer. 50.38. Jer. 51.17, 18, 19. Q. Is it unlawfull to make an Image of the Trinity, or of any Person in the Godhead? Pictures of God un∣lawfull.A. It is utterly unlawfull, and a great dishonour, to figure the incorruptible
God, by the shape of a base and corrupti∣ble man, or bird, or other creature. Deut. 4.15, 16, 17, 18. Rom. 1.23. Act. 17.24, 29, Esa. 40.15, 18, 19. Hab. 2.8. [It abuseth our understandings: the party thinks there is some good in an Image, else he would not make it; and that's a lie: He lieth that shews me a Toad, and saies it is the picture of an Angel; so, &c. All the pictures of Christ in the flesh, as that on Christ on the Crosse, and resurrection, are lies, false in their representations, and false in the conceit of any good by them.] Q. Is it unlowfull to make the image of a man, or Angell, or other creature, to help us in the worship of the Creator? A. It is utterly unlawfull to make, or to have the likenesse of any creature for reli∣gious use, to serve God thereby, in, at, or be∣fore it. [To think that by doing any part of worship before an Image, one shall please God the better, or that it will be a mean of good unto us; this is to rob God of his due: What promise of Gods pre∣sence, audience or acceptance before an Image, do you find in the whole Scri∣pture? &c. Esay 42.8. 2 Kings 18.4. 1 Ioh. 5.21. Rev. 9.20. Ezek. 8.10, 11. Act. 7.43. 1 Chron. 14.12. Deut. 27.15, the congrega∣tion
are bound to curse this man. v. 26. Thou shalt not bow downe to them, nor serve them. 2. All out∣ward re∣spect done to Images. vid. Cate∣chis. Rom. part. 3. c. 2.Q. What is forbidden in those words? A. 2. We are forbidden to give any ho∣nour, or outward reverence, to any Image; as, to come before it, to make our prayers, to bow the knee, to put off the cap, or to shew any token or reverence unto it. [It is a cursed thing to doe any honour to an I∣mage in word, by speaking favourable of it; or in deed, as to put off the hat to bow the knee, to give money and offerings for the maintenance of it, or to be at the feasts held in honour of the creatures, &c.] 1 King. 19.18. Hos. 13.2. 1 Cor. 9.7, 10. with 1 Cor. 10 14, 20, 21. Dan. 3.5, 11, 18. Exod: 32.5, 6. Ezek. 18.6. Judg. 6.31. Esay 66.3. 2 Chr. 25.14. we must not kisse the Calves, nor blesse an Idoll. Q. What, thirdly, is here forbidden? 3. All help∣ing forward of Idolatry.A. All outward service, tending to the honour, worship, and service of Saints, Angels, Images, or any other creature whatsoever. [As the building of Temples, dedicating of Daies, Altars, Garments, Priests, Feasts to them, and
raising of money for the maintenance thereof.] Hos. 8.14: Hos. 10.1, 2. 1 King: 12.32, 33. Esay 46.6. Exod. 32.2. Q. Under this grosse sinne of making and worshiping of Images, are condem∣ned all other superstitious corruptings of Gods worship without an Image. Now, How is Gods worship corrupted without an Image? A. By will-worship; that is, all such means and manner of divine worship,4. Will-worship, & humane traditions. as is not prescribed by God, but brought in by man: [It is will-worship to observe what God hath not commanded, and to forbeare what God hath not forbidden, for consci∣ence sake.] as going to God by Saints, worshiping of Angels; vowes of conti∣nency, placing of holinesse in meats, daies, garments, and places. Lastly, the inventing or using of New Sacraments (as the Popish Masse, and the five new Sacra∣ments) Adoration of the Altar; and of the consecrated Elements of Bread and Wine; together with all religious Ceremonies and Rites in and about the worship of God, wherein is placed any holinesse, vertue, ne∣cessity, or efficacy: All such manners and formes of worship be obhorred of the Lord. Col. 2.18, 21. 23. 2 Chron. 28.3.4.
1 King. 12.33. Ier. 19.5. Q. Why are such things unlawfull? A. Because they be imposed or taken up for Conscience sake, & made the matter of Gods worship, according to the Traditi∣ons and Commandements of men, with∣out any Authority of God. Mat. 15.9, 20. Esay 29.13. Mar. 7.4, 7. Act. 17.25. To place holinesse, or sin, or duty, in any inven∣tion, and ordinances of Men, is a super∣stition of deluded and seduced soules. Q. What is the thing commanded in this precept? A. That we worship God with a pure worship, that is, by those meanes, and in that manner, as God himselfe hath prescri∣bed. (as hath been shewed in the first que∣stion) Tell me next: Q. What be the chiefe Parts of Gods outward worship under the New Testa∣ment? A. They be foure. 1. The a Preach∣ing and hearing of the Word. 2ly, The exercise b of Prayer, publique and private. 3ly, The c administration of the Sacraments. 4ly, And singing of d Psalmes. a Act. 2.42. Luk. 4.16. Act: 13.15. b 1 Tim. 2.1, 8. Act. 16.13, 16. 1 Cor. 1, 2. c 1 Cor. 11.23. d For sing∣ing
of Psalmes read. 1 Chron. 16.7, 9. Act: 16.25. 1 Cor. 14.26. with 1 Chron. 25.3. Col. 3.16. Q. In what manner must this worship of God be performed? A. First, for the inward man;Care of the inward man in Gods worship. each part of Gods worship must pe performed, 1. In a faith, with feeling affection, b 2. And with a cleane heart. 3. Not c resting in the work done, but desiring to please God, and expecting a blessing by them. a Rom. 14.23 2 Chron. 17.6. Psal. 63.1, 2. Psa. 84.2, 6. b Ezek. 33.31, 32. Mat. 15.8. Ezek: 14.3. Psal. 50.16. Esay 1.11. Job 16.17. c Ier. 7.4, 10, 11. Hos. 7.14. Zach. 7.5. Mal. 1.7, 8, 13, 14. Mal: 3.14. 1 Pet: 2.2. [Exer∣cises of Religion must be performed, not only as a duty, but as a means of grace.] Q. How must Gods worship and ser∣vice be performed by the outward man? A. With such humility and reverence,And of the outward man. as becomes people that have to doe with an holy Lord God. Heb. 12.28, 29. 1 Cor. 11.22, 28, 29. Act. 20.9. [It is a sin either to disuse or to neglect the outward wor∣ship of God, or to performe the same carelesly. Reverend Gestures of the Body, as Kneeling, Bowing, lifting up of Hands and Eyes, putting off the Hat, &c. are for∣bidden
to be given to an Image; therefore they are commanded to be given unto God.] 1 Cor. 15 13. 2 Sam. 6.3, 7, 8. Q. What duty is here required, as an helpe, to further the outward worship of God. A. We must provide all such means, by which the worship of God may be ere∣cted, defended and maintained. Mal. 1.10. 1 Cor. 9.13, 14. [We must pleade for Religion, and be at cost for it: take away Arts, Tongues, Schooles, Colledges, and Maintenance, you will soon have no preaching, nor any worship of God.] Helping service is forbidden to Images, bur required for Gods Worship. Q. Why should we be so carefull to a∣void Images and Will-worship? A. Because such persons be indeed ha∣ters of God; however they say, they doe it with good intentions, and in greater honour and reverence to God. [As the unchast Wife doth not love her husband, what ere she professe.] Prov. 6.34, 35. Hos. 2.2, 13. 2 Chron. 19 3. Esay 30.1. God will vi∣sit this iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children to the third and fourth genera∣tion of them that Hate him.
CAP. XXXI. Of the third Commandement. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine, &c. Q. WHat is the drift of this third Commandement? A. To provide for the glorifying of Gods great name, in our tongue and do∣ings; that we so behave our selves, as God in all things may be glorified. [This Com∣mandement directs us to an holy use of all Religion, and of every thing upon which God hath set his name.] 1 Pet. 4.11. Levit. 10.3. Joh. 2.16. Ezek. 22.26. Mal: 1.13. Ezek. 8.12. Ezek. 18.2, 19. Deut. 28.58. Mat. 5.16. Mat. 6.9. Joh. 11.4. Joh. 15.8. Gods name is taken in vain, either In an Oath, Or, Without an Oath. Q. How many waies is it taken in vain in an Oath? A. Foure. 1. By vain, and needlesse, and customary swearing in mens common talk: Oaths cannot come unawares from a gra∣tious
heart, much lesse ordinarily. Eccles: 9.2. Iam. 3.12. Mat. 5.34.37. Ier. 6.7. Q. How, secondly? A. By false swearing; as when we a af∣firme a falshood, or deny and conceal the truth, b or falsifie what we have pro∣mised by oath. [This is called perjury.] a Zach. 5.4. Mal. 3.5. Lev. 5.1. Zach: 8. 16, 17. b Psal. 15.4. Ezek. 17.16, 18. with Judg: 9.20, 56, 57. 2 Sam. 21.1, 7. with Josh. 9.15. Men are perjured, when they goe from what they have promised by Oath, as well as when they swear an un∣truth. Q. How, thirdly? A. By wicked swearing, that is, when by an oath, or vow, we bind our selves to doe evill, to doe any thing against charity, piety, justice, duty. [As that I will not come to such a mans house, or that I will be revenged on him: Also all sinfull com∣binations, Covenants and Oaths, to hide e∣vill, or to set up any pretended good, con∣trary to Authority, Law, and duty; or contrary to any former Oaths and Pro∣testations All this is wicked swearing: for Gods ordinance must not be a bond of iniquity.] 1 King. 19.2. Act. 23.12. 1 Sam: 25.22. Hos. 10.2, 3, 4. See Iunius & Diodate in loc.
Q. How, fourthly, do men take Gods name in vaine in an Oath? A What they sweare by the creatures, as many doe by their Faith and Troth, by the Masse, by their Drink, or, as I live, &c. [vainly, customarily, or in passion.] Mat. 5.33, 34. Jam, 5.12. For these things men are damned. Amos 8.14. Zeph. 1.5. Esa. 45.23. Q. But is it not lawfull to swear be∣fore a Magistrate, for the maintenance of truth, justice, and peace among men?Three con∣ditions in an Oath. A. Yes: First, provided that we swear in truth, (the thing sworne, or vowed, must be a knowne truth.) Secondly, in judgement. (as becomes a wise Chri∣stian.) Thirdly, in righteousnesse. (not to the hurt of another.) Jer. 4.2. Exod: 22. 10, 11. Q. Is it not lawfull to make a vow and promissory Oath, whereby we bind our selves to God, to perform the thing that is gone out of our mouthes? A. Yes; it is with these two conditions:Of a vow. First, that the thing vowed & promised be lawfull to us, and within our power and callings to performe. [Else we take Gods name in vain, if we bind our selves to doe that which is not in our Power, or not law∣full
for us in our places to performe [And therefore to vow single life, absolute and blind obedience to superiours, as Popish Priests doe; or to vow any thing against our duty, callings, former Vowes and Oathes, they be all unlawfull, and to be broken.] Num. 30.3. Jer. 44.25. Psal. 24 4. Q. What second condition is required in a vow and solemne protestation? A. Because all lawfull Vowes must be performed: therefore we should foresee and consider, how meet, lawfull, and profi∣table, the Oath will be before we swear, that so we may safely performe our vowes [Our promissory Oaths must be with much caution and condition: It is a sinne not to performe a lawfull Vow.] Josh. 9.14, 15. 1 Sam. 14.44. Jsh. 2.19. Gen. 24.5. Judg. 11.31. a rash vow. Q. How is Gods name taken in vaine without an oath? A. First, by foolish, light, unreverent speaking of Gods a Will, Titles, and Attributes; or of his b Word, and c works. [As in foolish admirations, O Lord, O sweet Jesus, Lord have mercy upon us, I never saw the like! Secondly, When gamesters thank God for their good luck.
Thirdly, when men jest with Scripture-phrases. Fourthly, when men speake re∣proachfully of Gods decrees. as if I be pre∣destinated, I shall be saved; if not, I shall be damned, doe what I can, &c.] a Rom. 9.19, 20. b Joh. 6.60. Jer. 23.34. Act. 17. 32. c Gen. 4.24. Mar. 3.22, 29, 30. Esay 36.20, Mic. 3.11. Zach. 11.5. Q. How, secondly, without an oath? A. When men have cursings and impre∣cations in their mouthes. [As a pox, or a plague on thee, the Devill take thee, &c. It is a sinne to wish a curse to our selves, or others; as, God damne me, would I were hanged, &c.] 1 Sam. 17.43. 2 Sam: 16.7. Q. How, thirdly? A. When we apply the name Jesus, or any other name of God, or any sentence of Scripture, to Charmes, sorcery, or other supernaturall uses. [As to drive away Devils, to doe cures, to sanctifie creatures not sanctified by God; as to baptize Bels, &c. this is a false application of Gods Word.] Act. 19.13. Q. How, fourthly? A. When men goe about to imitate the miraculous, and extraordinary workes of Christ, and the Apostles. [As the Popish exorcisme; ex tempore, Prophecying of men
called and ungifted; laying on of hands to give the Holy Ghost; to make empty signes, without effects following, &c. This is a misapplication of Gods power, with∣out promise or warrant; exposing of Re∣ligion to contempt, and a taking of Gods name in vaine.] Act. 19.13. Act. 8.18, 19. 1 Cor. 14.31, 32. Q. How, fiftly, is Gods name taken in vain without an Oath? A. When we performe any part of Gods worship carelesly & perfunctorily. As when we pray without understanding and good sense, or for fashion and ostentation; when we preach without preparation, and for civill complement, or vaingloriously; when we receive the Sacrament, because it is the use at certain times in the year, &c. Now is Gods name taken in vain by us, though we seem to honour him.] Jer 48.10. 1 Cor. 14.11. See Eccl. 5.1, 2. Mal: 1.13. 2 Tim. 2.15. Phil. 15.16. Luk. 8.18. Q. How, lastly, is Gods name taken in vaine without an Oath? A. When we put Gods Name, Cause, & Religion, upon our own worldly, carnall, and base ends and enterprizes. [When Re∣ligion is made a cloak to carry on, or to cover any vile and unjust actions, then is
Gods name taken in vain.] Jer. 7.9, 10, 11. Mic. 3.11. Mat. 23.14. 2 Sam. 4.8, 11. They put the name of God upon their wicked murther, saying, the Lord hath a∣venged thee of Saul: with 1 Sam. 26.8. Q. Why must we be carefull of this Law? A. Because God holdeth all prophaners of his name, for most vile persons; who, though they escape punishment amongst men, yet shall not escape Gods wrath. [They are under the Law, in whomsoever any of these sins reigne.] God will not hold him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine. CAP. XXXII. Of the Sabbath day we consider, the 1. Institution, 2. Change, and 2. Celebration of it. Remember the Sabbath day. Q. WHat is the purpose of God in this Command∣ment? A. God will have every seventh day set apart, and observed to his honour and
worship, in the duties of Religion, and not spent to our pleasure or profit. [It must be separate from. other daies.] Eze. 22.26. Esay 58.13, 14. The Sabbath was insti∣tuted chiefly for the publique worship of God. Exod, 34.21. 1. Q. Is this Law of keeping one day of seven, for an holy est, still in force? A. Yes; it hath been from the beginning, and shall continue to the end of the world;The Mora∣lity of the Sabbath. & it is not in the power of man to alter this proportion of time. [as to make the day of rest to be sooner or later, as on every fift, or on every eight day.] Gen. 2.2, 3. Hel. 4.3, 4. Exod. 16.22, 25. Mat. 5.18. [God created seven daies, and no more, and God rested from the begin∣ning.] 2. Q. Touching the change of the day. The observation of the Lords day for the Sabbath: Is it from Heaven, or of men? A. It is of God, who changed the day, though not the number of the day, to the first of the weeke, called the Lords day. Act. 20.6, 7. 1 Cor. 16.2. Rev. 1.10. Joh: 20.19, 26. [This is a rule; looke what hath been continued down to us by the uninter∣rupted practice of the Churches in all a∣ges from the Apostles times, and the first
linke of that chaine, that is, the example, practice, ground, reason, & analogy thereof is found in Scripture: that is, to be ac∣knowledged of divine authority, and not meerly of man: Now such is this of the Lords day, and baptizing of Infants; the Commandement limits out the quotient, and God by particular designation hath pointed out the day, from which none but God can againe alter it.] 3. For the celebration of the Lords day, two sorts of duties are required of a Christian: Some Before the day come. When the day is come. Q. What is required of us before the day come? A. We must remember it, that is, we must be mindfull of it before hand; so to contrive and order our affaires and affe∣ctions, that they may not hinder us in the Lords worke, on the Lords day. Ex. 16.5, 23. Q. What followes hereof? A. Therefore it is a sinne, first, to re∣serve some od choares, or journies, or merry meetings, to that day: secōdly, to encumber our selves with more businesse then we can conveniently dispatch in six daies. [As to take in more worke, more writing,
more Merchandize, &c. In this kinde, Brewers, Tailers, Millers, Treaders of Wine-fats, and men of other occupations doe greatly offend, as many as doe not order their businesse to end with the weeke; that so their calling may stand still, and their hearts be fitted to meet God in his Ordinances.] Q. When the day is come, What is our duty? A. It is two-fold: First, we must rest from all businesses of our callings, in heart, in act, and in tongue, both we and ours. [The law is spirituall, and binds the inward man.] Neh. 13.15, 16, 17. Exo. 34 21. Exod. 31.15, 16. Jer. 17.24. Q. What, secondly? A. This rest must be an holy and san∣ctified rest; it must not be a brutish rest. [There is a difference between the rest of an Ox, and of his Master.] Esa. 58.13. Q. What duties are required to an holy rest? A. Foure: First, we must prepare our selves for a publick worship in the morn∣ing, by examination of our wants & waies, and by Prayer, both by our selves alone, and with our families, for Gods blessing on the ordinances, for the edification of
our selves and others. [They that come without praying, goe away usually with∣out a blessing] Exod: 19.10. Q. What second duty is required? A. We must be diligent to come to the publike assemblies, timely, reverently, and with our company, if we have any. Act: 15.21. Luk: 4 16. Ezek: 46.10. Act. 10.33. Psal: 42.4. Heb. 10.25. Q. What thirdly? A. I must religiously joyne with the Congregation in the duties there perfor∣med; as in a Prayer, b praising and sing∣ing, c attending to the Word read or Preached, and d participation of the Sacrament. Eccl. 5.1. 1 Cor. 14.26, 27. a Act. 16.13. Mat: 81.19. 2 Chron: 5.13. Col: 3.16. c Act: 13.15, 16. Luk. 4.20. d 1 Cor. 11.21. Act: 2.42. Act: 20.7. [It is a fault in the congregation to di∣vert our selves from the exercise in hand, to private reading, or talking, or gazing a∣bout; we must make one in every exercise of Gods worship. Q. VVhat fourth duty is required to the sanctifying of a Sabbath? A. After the Assembly is dismissed, I must spend the other time in meditation, and reading of Gods word, in prayer,
and conference of that we have heard, to the edification of our selves and families. Act. 17.11, 12. 1 Cor. 14.35. Gen. 18.19. [These be the duties of the day.] Q. Is all work simply unlawfull to be done on the Sabbath day? Three sorts of workes lawfull on the Sabbath day.A. No; workes of mercy to a man or beast; b workes about the worship of God, and workes of true necessity, may be done. [God will have mercy rather then sacrifice: It is therefore lawfull to ring bels to call the people together; to travell to a Sermon, to dresse our Meat, to Milk our Kine, to set watch & ward, & such things as belong to the meet comfort of mans life: man is not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man.] a Luk. 13.11, 15.

Because if we make conscience of the Sabbath day, we shall be blessed in our soules, and in the labours of the weeke daies. [Tis a blessed day; the day is not ca∣pable of blessing, or a curse, in it selfe, but to the observers of it, it is a day of blessing.] Esay 56.4, 6. Neh. 13.18. Jer. 17.24, 25.

Deut. 6.7. 2 Tim. 3.15. b Prov. 19.18. 1 Sam. 3.13. 1 King. 1.6. Q VVhat is the second duty of Parents? A. In all things Parents must shew themselves patternes of Godlinesse, and not bane their Children by their irreligious examples; which makes both their own counsels at home, and the helpes of educati∣on abroad, to be unfruitfull unto them, Psal. 131.2. Q. VVhat third duty? A. Parents must cherish, protect and provide for their Children of substance ho∣nestly gotten. 2 Cor. 12.14. Gen. 30.30. Josh: 7.24. Q. VVhat fourth duty belongs to Pa∣rents? A.

Gen. 24.3, 6. 2 Cor. 6. 14, 15.16. Mal. 2.11. Q. What, secondly, is their duty? A. To pitty and doe good each to the soule of other; to bring one another from errour and darknesse, to be heires of the grace of life. 1 Cor. 7.16. 1 Pet. 3.7. Q. What, thirdly? A. Mutuall helping each of other in counsels, care, and bearing the burthen of the family; especially they must, as yoke-fellowes, joyn together in setting up Religion in the family. [They must draw in one yoke, and one way, in all good things: the burthen must not be cast on one,
through the sloth, nicenesse, voluptuous∣nesse and pride of the other.] Gen: 2.20, 24. 1 Sam. 25.17, 24, 25. Q. What, fourthly? A. They owe one to another conjugall a love and loyalty, whereby they must love and delight one in another above all others, b bearing one anothers burthens and infirmities.

25, 26. Hest. 1.12, 17.] a Tit. 2.4, 5. b Prov. 7.11. 1 Tim. 5.13. c 1 Tim. 2.12. Gen. 3.6. Col. 3.18. d Prov. 31.26. 1 Pet. 3.3, 4.

What is the duty more peculiar to the Husband? A. To dwell with the Wife according to knowledge, giving honour to her, as to the weaker vessell, that is, not overbearing any thing contrary to her credit, place, & comforts; but fitting imployments, accor∣ding to her abilities; making up in love and wisedome, what is defective in her weaknesse. 1 Pet. 3.7. [What beautifull Christians should we be, if we were care∣full to performe and shew the power of Religion, in discharge of the duties that belong to us in our severall relations; he is an hypocrite that is forward in common duties of Christianity, and is not alike carefull of the particular duties belong∣ing to his relation and calling.]
There be other relations of men who ought to give honour one to another; as Pastours and People, young and aged, rich and poore, &c. Q.

Jer. 38.4, 9. b 1 Cor. 96, 10, 13, 14. 1 Tim. 5.17. That double honour is spoken of their mainte∣nance; it is a sinne to make him a poor de∣spicable man. Gal. 6.6. in all good things. Q. What is the third duty of people to Ministers? A. To suffer themselves to be guided & amended by their wholsome and faithfull doctrines. Heb. 13.17. 2 Tim. 4.15. [These are not duties of curtesy and good nature, but of conscience before God, who will re∣quire a strict account of all the derision, slanders, hard usage, and up-risings against their Ministers persons, calling, doctrines, and godly admonitions, as if it were a glory to keep them under, or to carry on
a foolish disorder against them, &c. Hos. 4.4. Mat. 22.6, 7. 2 Chron. 36.16, 19. Act: 4.2, 3, 24. Rev. 11.5. See 1 Cor. 4 11, 12, 13. Jer. 26.15. Q. What is the Ministers duty to the flock? A.  1. He must goe in and out before them in a (a) blamelesse conversation.  2. & (b) feed them with wholsome doctrine, (a) plainly, diligently (b) and faithfully, separating be∣tween sheep and goates; between pretious and vile; having (e) compassion on the igno∣rant, and them that be out of the way. (a) 1 Tim. 4.12. Tit. 1.6. Levit. 21.4, 21. (b) Tit. 1.9. 2 Tim. 3.16. Jer. 23.28. (c) 2 Cor. 4.2. 2 Tim. 2.2, 25. 2 Cor. 12.15. (d) Ezek. 13.10, 19, 22. Jer. 15.19. (e) Mat 19.36, 38. Zach. 11.15.

And what is their duty back againe to Inferiours?
A. They must not disdaine, nor dispise others that be below themselves in gifts or estate, but rather to be beneficiall to them, by their countenance, good example, & best use of their gifts.

Because all men are to be honoured, and we must not doe any thing whereby our brother is set at nought: Tell me how equals ought to behave themselves one to∣ward another? [As fellow-servants, fel∣low-Ministers, fellow-Citizens.] A. They must be curteous one to an¦other, & respectfull, giving honour one to another, not provoking, envying, or dis∣gracing one another. 1 Pet. 2, 17. Rom. 12.10. Mat. 23.6. Gal. 5.26. Q. Why must we be carefull of this Law? A. Because God hath annexed outward blessings to the conscionable perform∣ance of the duties herein contained, name∣ly, long life, & wel-being. [It shall be well with thee, and thou shalt live long.] We must take all outward promises with this condition, viz: so farre as they shall be ex∣pedient
for the health of our soules, and not to the hurt of them; Gods children have long life, health, &c. or the blessing of them.] CAP. XXXVI. Of the six Commandement. Thou shalt not kill. Q.

Two waies.  First, by rash and un∣advised anger. [Now anger is an inward motion of displeasure against another, in∣clining the heart to wish or practice evil to
another; there is a just anger against the sinnes of others: but sinfull anger is that which is conceived upon surmises, & false causes; or else is excessive in the measure, and continuance; or evill in its effects, moving us to doe evill.] Mat. 5.22. Eph: 4.31. Jam. 1.19, 20. Prov. 14.29. Q. How, secondly? A. By hatred and malice, envy and de∣sire of revenge against another. [This is the murther of the heart.] 1 Ioh. 3.15. Col. 3.8. Rom. 12.19.

shaking the head, stamping with the foot at one, or any other gesture and carriage, whereby thy brother is set at nought, is a sinne against this commandement; this is to say, Rache.] Q. How secondly? A. When the wrath and malice of the heart breaks forth into evill speeches; as a railing, b scoffing, c brawling and chi∣ding, d accusing, upbraiding e and threat∣ning, &c. These shew the venome and rancor of the heart, and are the murther of the tongue; this is to say, Thou foole.] a Psal. 59, 7. 2 Sam. 16.8. b Mat. 27.40, 43. 2 King. 2.23. c Eph. 4.31.

How else doe men become guilty of murther in the sight of God? A. VVhen we a neglect the means of life and health; or else by b surfetting and drunkennesse impaire our own or an∣others health; or c else doe desperately cast our selves and others into dangers, and sinnes, which are punishable by death. a 1 Tim. 5.23. b Rom. 13.13. Hab. 2.15. c 2 Sam. 23.15, 17. Joh. 11.8, 9. d 1 King: 2.23. Q How, lastly, doe we become guilty of bloud in the sight of God? A.

VVhat doth God require of us in this re∣gard? A. That we should not a plunge our selves, or others, into sin and heresy, by re∣jecting or corrupting the food of souls, Gods VVord, nor by any other seducement what∣soever; but b rather to bring our selves, and others, to a love of the truth, and la∣bouring after the bread of life. a Ezek. 33.8, 9.

conscience in dealings. All kind of oppression is theft.] Q. Who, thirdly, are guilty of theft before God? A.

By lending, or borrowing, to the de∣ceiving and oppressing of our brother. [Sometimes the Lender gripeth the Bor∣rower, and sometimes again the Borrow∣er deceives the Lender.] Ezek: 22.12. Psa. 37.21. Rom. 13.8. ['Tis not a sin to bor∣row for ones need: yet to borrow without cause, or to maintain pride and idlenesse, and beyond our abilities to pay, that is evill.] Q. Under the name of theft is forbid∣den
all unlawfull waies of gaine: Tell me then: How, fiftly, doe men sin against this Commandement in outward act? A. By using unlawfull callings, and un∣godly practises, to get their livings. [As doe Gamesters, Jugglers, Stage-players, Rope-dancers, &c. also they that sell justice, or the gifts of the Holy Ghost; or else ex∣pose their bodies for hire, or their wits and pens to get money by filthy Poems, false and foolish writings, &c.] Act. 16.16, 19.

Tell me then: How doe we sinne against this Commande∣ment inwardly? A. Two waies: First, by grudging and wishing evill to the prosperity of others, or plotting their dammage. Psal. 73.3, 21, 22. Deut. 22.1. Q. How, secondly? A. By Covetousnesse and discontented∣nesse with our own estates. Eccles. 5.10. 1 Tim. 6.10. Prov. 15.27. Esa. 32.7, 8. Pro. 30.15. Hab. 2.5. Heb. 13.5. Q. How doth Covetousnesse discover it selfe; [No man will yeild himselfe to
be a Covetous person. A. 1. A covetous person spendeth ma∣ny pretious thoughts and delights upon a∣bundance.Three signs of a cove∣tous person. 2. He placeth much credit and comfort in that treasure. 3. And for attaining thereof, he will do mean things, yea sinfull things, and hidden things of dishonesty: [He covets & desireth more then he dares to pray for: that's a Covetous person.] Ezek. 33.31. Eccles. 4.8. Prov. 28.20. Eph. 5.5. Q. Thus of things forbidden. What doth the Lord require of us in this Commande∣ment? A. Foure things:  First, to worke with our hands the thing that is good, that is, to be diligent in a lawfull calling, Eph. 4.28. 2 Thes. 3.8, 10. Prov. 10.4. Gen. 2.15. Gen. 3.19. Q. What, secondly? A. Frugality and providence, in using our goods according to the rules of Charity and justice. Joh. 6.12. Psal. 112.5. Q. What, thirdly, and fourthly? A. 3. To deal justly with our Neighbour; a to help him in his estate.  4ly, And if we have wronged him, to b make resti∣tution. a Deut. 22.1. 1 Sam. 25.16. Gen. 30, 33. 1 Thes. 4.6. b Gen. 43.12. Job 20.

[No man hath power over his own goods, to wast them in rioting, in clothes, build∣ing, gaming, sports, &c. as he pleaseth: but we must use them as stewards, who are to bring in their bills of expence unto God.

Job 13.7, 8. Rom: 3.7, 8. Gen: 20.9, 12, 16. 1 King: 13.18. Hos: 7.3. Q. Shew some other particulars where∣in we sin against this Commandment? A. The grossest and most harmfull kind of lying is in judgement, and bearing of witnesse, when either the Judge, Witnesse, or Pleader, shall deny, conceal, pervert, and dissemble the truth, or countenance the wrong [It's a sinne to shrink from the truth, when Religion, Justice, or Cha∣rity, doe call for the maintaining of it. Jer 9.3.] Deut: 19 18. Mic: 7.3. 2 Tim: 4.16. Prov: 24 11, 12. Q. How secondly, is this Law broken? A. By backbiting, slandering, harsh and unjust censures of others; or any way rai∣sing or taking up an evill report against our brother. Psal: 15.3. Exod: 23.1. 2. Sam: 16.2, 3. Neh: 6.6. Levit: 19.16. Mat: 7.1. Mar: 3, 22, 30. 2 Sam: 16.3. Q. How, thirdly, doe we sin against this Commandment?
A. By dissimulation, and equivocation; that is, when we are made to believe one thing, and another is intended; or when mens words doe beare a double sense. [So that there is one proposition reserved in the mind of the equivocator, which cros∣seth that which is uttered by the tongue: 'tis a sinne to dissemble and equivocate.] Ier. 8.9. Psal. 12.2. Psal. 15.3. Mat. 26.72. Q. How, fourthly, doe we sin against this Commandement? A. When we speake the truth in malice, that is, with an intent and desire to hurt and disgrace another. [As Doeg did.] 1 Sam. 22.10. with Psal. 52.2, 3.4. Q. Out of the heart proceeds false witnesse. Mat. 15.19. How doe men offend in heart against this Commandement? Inwardly.A. Two waies: First, by evill surmisings, and ungrounded suspicions, a thinking hardly of others without a cause. [That is, upon some b weak matter, or weak (c) evidence; as upon hear-say, jea∣lousie, uncharitable collections, &c. all which proceed from want of love.] b Mat. 9.3, 4. Ioh. 7.24. Ioh. 9.16. b Rom. 14.3. 1 Tim. 6.4. c 2 Sam. 10.3. 1 Sam. 22. 8, 10. 2 Sam. 16.4. 1 Sam. 24.9. Q. How, secondly?
A. When we can rejoyce in the disgraces of another, being glad to heare him evill spoken of; or else to be grieved for their good esteeme. [This also proceeds from want of love.] Mat. 21.15. 3 Ioh. v. 10, 12. 1 Sam. 18.7, 8. Q. These be things forbidden: What doth the Lord require of us in regard of our brother? A. First,Duties re∣quired. that we speak the truth in love no more, nor no lesse then the truth. [With∣out wrenchings, fetches, doublings; with∣out flattery or detraction.] Eph. 15. Psal. 12.2. Q. What, secondly? A. To defend a our brothers good name, as farre as may stand with good conscience; and if we have b wronged it, to repaire the same. [Recanting that which hath beene falsely said; explaining that which hath been doubtfully said, and prai∣sing or justifying them in that wherein they have been unjustly condemned] a 1 Sam. 19.4. Ier. 26.9, 16. Prov. 25.23. Prov. 24.11, 12. b 1 Sam. 24.17. 2 Sam. 19.19, 20. Q. By what meanes must I defend my brothers good name? A. We must a construe things in the
best sense; and when they cannot be alto∣gether excused, yet we must b acknowledge other good things to be in them. [That their honesty be not quite trodden under foot, &c.] a 1 Cor. 13.7. 1 Pet. 4.8. b 2 Chr. 19.3. Q. How doe men sinne against their own good names? A. Two waies: First, when we speak more or lesse of our selves then is true, making our selves better or worse then we are, dissembling the good or evill that is in us. [When men lessen faults, or greaten their virtues; or on the contrary, doe aug∣ment their sinnes and unworthinesse, and debase Gods goodnesse in any kind to∣wards them, or in them, that's a false te∣stimony of our selves; boasting or bragging and selfe-condemning, they be both of them evill.] Gal. 2.13. Exod. 4.10. 1 Sam: 21.14, 15. Prov. 13.7. Prov. 27.2. Prov. 20.6. Acts. 12.22. Q: How, secondly, doe we wrong our own good names? A. When we deserve a an evill report, or else (b) suffer an evill report to rest upon us unjustly. [Both these doe wound a good name.] a Ge. 34.30. 1 Sa. 2.24. Phi. 4.8. b Act. 24.12. Mar: 3.23, 24. Job 27.5.
Q. By what means may a Christian pre∣serve and defend his own good name a∣gainst slanders and false accusations? A. There be two waies:  First, he must a cleare himselfe of the slander before men by a modest and dispassionate con∣viction of the defamer.  2. At least he must stop b their mouthes by an holy and blamelesse conversation. a 2 Sam. 19.26, 27. 2 Cor. 11.5, 12. b 1 Pet. 2.12, 15. Tit. 1.11, 13. CAP. XL. Tenth Commandement. Thou shalt not Covet, &c. HEre God takes order with the first motions and inclinations to evill,The scope. though they never come to the consent of the will, and purpose of the heart. Q. Thou shalt not covet: What is here forbidden? A. The first motions unto sin, the lusting of the old man, though we never purpose nor consent unto them. [All evill inclinations and motions of the heart before consent, as vaine thoughts, suddaine passions and affections, and all
lusting of the old man against the will of God. [So Paul expounds this Commande∣ment. Rom. 7.7, 23. Jam. 1.14. Gal. 5.17. Q. What is the particular coveting here forbidden? A. Discontentednesse with that we have, wishing and longing after that which is anothers. [As when we be not content with that place and condition which we hold in the Family, Church, or Common∣wealth; but the heart is still rising, wishing, woulding after the condition of another; as would I were a Master, or a Minister, or a Tradesman, rather then a Minister, &c. This unquietnesse of the spirit, this sicknesse of the desire, repining, rising, and saying within our selves, O how well could I live, if I had such a field, such a Wife, such a Servant, &c. these motions be contrary to that compleat contentment which is here requirey.] Under this particular concupis∣cence of the heart, coveting that which is anothers, all evill motions and desirings of the like kinde are forbidden; namely, all lustings against the Law of the minde; all the rising, enmity and Rebellion that is in our nature against the things of the Spi∣rit; the suddain passions and perturbati∣ons of the mind; also the rolling of vain
thoughts in the mind, as thoughts of pride, revenge, the moving of the heart towards any evill object, though without any set∣led approbation of the same. But tell me: Q. Are these thoughts and motions sinfull, if we doe not consent unto them, nor purpose to put them in practice? A. Yes, they are: The very risings of corruptions within us, are sins to be repent∣ed of: [They are as the scum and boiling, of the pot, the rising of the mud, &c. A lame horse, if he move, he will halt in going: An instrument out of tune will jarre in the sounding, and that is a fault; there is something wanting that should be unto perfection; so in our very natures, there is a jarring and a swerving from the Law of God, and that uprightnesse, wherein God created man; and these swervings are the fruits of sinne; and the causes of sinne in us, as Jam. 1.14, 15.] Rom. 7.21, 23, 24. Gen. 8.21. Eph. 4.22. Q. What say you then of evill sug∣gestions and thoughts that arise in our minds, as thoughts of Blasphemy, &c. are they sinnes? A. If they be cast in by Satan,Of Satani∣call injecti∣ons. and not yeelded unto by us, they be Satans sins, and not ours: [To be tempted is no sin, for
Christ was tempted, and had evill thoughts cast into his mind by Satan; but to yeeld to the temptation, that is our sinne.] Mat. 4.6. Mat. 16.23. Q. How may it be discerned whether the evill motions doe arise from our own cor∣rupt hearts or from Satan? A. Two waies: 1. If the motion or temp∣tation he unnaturall, (that is) if thoughts arise which tend to the destruction of our naturall well-being, or of our spirituall & eternall well-being, it is then from Sathan, and if we consent not to such thoughts, they are not our sins but Satans: Perhaps thou hast thoughts to curse God, to wish there were no God, thoughts perhaps of despaire, or to kill ones selfe or others, &c. these be Satanicall injections; for nature loveth it selfe, and so doth grace our new and spirituall nature, and therefore if we resist and dislike such motions, they be not sinne to us. Matth. 4.9. Matth. 16.23. 1. John 4.3. Mat. 3.28. Q. How else may that be known? A. By the manner of their comming, if they seaze upon us with terror & affright∣ment, suddainly and unexpectedly, so that the soule is burdened and groaneth un∣der them, willing to be rid of them, it is a
signe they come from Sathan; [And such thoughts and tentations are our trials and afflictions, but not our sinnes; evill thoughts which agree to nature & to our dispositions, (as that of Davids numbring the people, and Judas selling his Master,) though Sathan cast them into our minds, and stirre us up thereunto, yet they are our sins as well as Sathans.] Matth. 4.10. Christ had indignation against that moti∣on. Q. What doth this Law forbidding all concupiscence, informe us of? A. Two things: First, it shewes the in∣finite purity of Gods Law which requires a conformity to his will, not onely in our wils, affections and actions, but in the very frame and temper of the soule: [That no evill motions arise against God.] Q. What, secondly? A. It shewes the impurity of our nature, which is so great, that for it alone, (though we never harboured an evill thought) the Lord might justly abhorre us for ever: [And therefore these inward workings of corruption, the untowardnesse & contra∣riety of our natures against God, are to be bewailed and crucified, if we desire to be sound in repentance. Job. 15.15, 16,
Eph. 2.3. Psal. 51.5. Ier. 17.9. Eph. 4.22. Rom. 6.6. Rom. 7.21, 24. Q. Is every soule bound to make con∣science of the Law, in forbearing the sins forbidden, and doing the duties comman∣ded? A. Yes: To his power he must keep it all, else he is under the Law, and not under Christ. [And consequently must perish for ever.] Rom. 6.14. Rom. 2.25. Gal. 5.24. Q. Are there, besides this Law of God, other Lawes and precepts of the Church to be observed of Christians for conscience sake: [As to observe Saints daies, keep fa∣sting daies, make confession to the Priest at certaine times in the yeare of all our sins, heare Masse upon holy daies. Canisius Cat.] A. No there is nothing to be added to the written Word of God, it being in it self most holy, perfect, and sufficient to make men wise to salvation, Deut. 4. 2. Rev. 22.18. 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. [Man hath no power to make Laws to the conscience; civill con∣stitutions they may make for outward orders sake; which we are to observe, if they be agreeable to the Word of God, not otherwise. Q. Are there Evangelicall counsels of
perfection, distinct from precepts, which if we keep voluntarily, do help forward our salvation, and increase our glory? [As that of poverty, single life, blind obedi∣ence to superiours? Canitious Cat.] A. No, the Lord hath left us a liberty in some things, but our choice therein is no part of perfection, and other things na∣med for counsels, are not left to our curte∣sy, but are duties to be performed as oc∣casion requireth. [The only service and sacrifice which God accepteth, is, obedi∣ence to his will in his Word, and God re∣fuseth whatsoever a man taketh in hand besides.] Q. Well then, there is but one Law un∣der which we stand, and the end of that Law is, as hath been said, to drive us un∣to Christ. Tell me what must we goe to Christ for? A. For three things.  1. For a mer∣cy, to forgive our sinnes.  2. For b strength and victory over our sins.  And 3. for c acceptance of our will for the deed. [For the Law justifieth no transgressor, the Law gives no grace to keepe it selfe, the Law accepts nothing but compleat obedi∣ence.] a Rom. 10.4. b Joh. 1.16. 2 Cor. 3.6. Gal. 3.2. c Eph. 1.6. Heb. 13.15. 1 Pet. 2.5.
Q Our faith is unperfect and so is our obedience, what is our duty in regard of the imperfection of both? A. We must strive to encrease and grow in grace by a diligent and constant use of all those means which God hath set apart and sanctified to that end. [If we have a dimnesse in the eyes, or a lamenesse, we will try twenty waies to help it, so, &c. and to this end, only the wayes of God are available, and must be used in their place, one ordinance helps another.] 2 Pet. 2.18. Heb. 6.11, 12. Luke 17.5. 1 Thes. 4.1, 10. Prov. 1.24. Iob 17.9. He that hath cleane hands, shall be stronger and stronger. CAP. XLI. Of the meanes of Working and encreasing faith & 1. of Hearing the word of God. THere is a threefold use and benefit of the means of grace, viz. 1. To worke faith and conversion. 2. To encrease gra∣ces begunne. 3. To seale up the assurance of all to our hearts. Q What be those means which God hath sanctified and set apart for the beget∣ing & encreasing of his saving graces in us?
A. Three: First, the exercise of the a word Read and Preached. Secondly, prayer b publick and private. Thirdly, and the use c of the Sacraments. a Rom. 10.13.14. Act. 8.31, 35. Act. 13.15.27. Act. 15.21. b Luk. 11.9, 13. John 16.23. Act. 16.13. c Luk. 7.30. 1 Cor. 10.16, 1 Cor. 11.17. Mat. 3.6.7. Mark 1.4. 1. Of hearing the word of God. Q. How may I heare the word of God to my comfort and salvation? A. Some things are required, 1. Be∣fore we come to Heare. 2. Some things in Hearing. 3. And some things after we have Heard. Q. What is required before we come? A. Before I come, I must set my heart and minde in frame by due preparation. Exod. 19.10, 11. 1 Sam. 6.20. Acts 10.33. Luc. 8.18. Q. VVherein Stands this preparation to right hearing,Of prepara∣tion before Hearing. or reading the word of God? A. In three things:  First, the heart must be emptied of all stumbling blocks of ini∣quity, I must receave it in an honest heart, (that is) with a teachable & tractable heart, resolving to practice whatsoever is taught me out of Gods word [I must not set up
any imaginations, reasonings, or purpo∣ses, which may make me to be offended, and stumble at the Word, being disobedi∣ent: but I must submit every opposite de∣sire to the obedience of Jesus Christ.] Ezek. 14.7. Ezek. 33.32. Mat. 19.22. Ioh. 5.44. Ier. 4.3. Act. 10.33. Luk. 8.15. Rom: 6.17. Iam. 1.21. 1 Pet. 2.1, 2, 8. Lord here I am before thee as they clay, fashion me to thine owne mind and will. Q. Wherein, secondy, stands right pre∣paration? A. We must not come heavily, and for formes sake, but with an hungring and thirsting after the good knowledge of God, desirous to grow by it in grace and goodnesse. Esa. 2.3. Luk. 1.53. 1 Pet. 2.2. Iob. 23.12. Psal 19.10, 11. Q. Wherein, thirdly, stands this pre∣paration? A. We must pray for the Spirit, and blessing of God, to accompany the out∣ward Ordinances, without which they are uneffectuall. [Many men know these directions: but didst thou ever put them in practice? Didst ever set thy selfe by hear∣ing to get wisedome, and be healed?] Prov. 20.12. Luk. 24, 45. Esa. 48.17. Psal. 119.18.
Q. 2. In hearing, What must we doe? A. The Word must be heard with re∣verence, and attention, and mingled with faith, that is, I must believe that it is true, and true to me. [As if I heare a promise, or a duty, or a marke of grace, I must take it to my selfe, as true and good to me.] Heb: 4, 2.3. Luk. 4.20. Act. 13.46. Q. What help have you thus to prepare and dispose your heart? A. I must consider, that it is not the will a and word of man, but of God, by which also I shall be judged; and therefore if I b resist it, I stand not out against man, but against God. [Untill I give Gods Word a divine authority over my heart, I am but an hypocrite, I can never believe, &c.] a 1 Thes. 1.4, 5. with 1 Thes. 2.13 b Zach. 7.12. Act. 7.51. 2 Chr. 34.19, 21. Ezra 9.4. [This conside∣ration would free the heart of impatiency, and contempt of the Preacher, of pride of our own hearts, and other carnall affe∣ctions, which make the Word unfruitfull unto us. Q 3. What must me doe after we have heard? A. Two things: First, we must meditate and conferre of it, and examine it, (as the
Bereans did) that so the rules of Gods Word may be rooted in our understand∣ing, memories and affections. Acts 17.11, 12. Luke 2.51. 1 Cor: 14.35. Q. What secondly? A. We must be carefull to turne hear∣ing into practice, for not the hearer, but the doer of the word is blessed. Matth: 7.24, 26. Jam. 1.22, 23.25. Psal: 119.105. Prov. 9.21, 22. Luke 11.28. CAP. XLII. Of Prayer, which is the second means of Grace: PRayer is an excellent means to ob∣taine all good things spirituall and temporall at Gods hands, Iam. 1.5. Luke 18.1, 2. Q. What is Prayer? What it is.A. Prayer is a wrestling with God or a making known of our requests to God with supplications for good things ac∣cording to his will, and giving him the praise of all the good we have. Gen: 32.24. Hos: 12.4. Phil: 4.6. Neh: 1.8. There be ma∣ny things required to the making of an ac∣ceptable prayer, to a right manner of
calling upon God, which shall be set down as followeth. Q. To whom must we make our pray∣ers? A. Only to God in the name and medi∣ation of Jesus Christ, Christ bids us pray to our Father in heaven. Col. 3.17. Eph. 3.12, 14. 1 Tim. 2.5. Rev. 8.3. Q. What is it to pray in the name of Jesus Christ? A. It is not only to say those words, [through Jesus Christ our Lord Amen;]2. Through whom. but it is by faith to plead the grace of the Cove∣nant made with us in Christ: [to make him the great Master of Requests in Hea∣ven; it is an interposing and pleading of Christs merts with the Father, to speed our desires.] Acts 4.29, 30. Iohn 16.23. Heb: 3.15. Q. Why must we call upon God alone, and not upon any creature, either Angels, or Saints departed? A. Because God alone searcheth all hearts, knoweth all griefes, hears all prayers, and is alone able to satisfy our desires, and sup∣ply our wants. [To pray to one doth sup∣pose in him these two things: 1 Omniscience (that is) knowledge of all hearts, of all our wants, desires and groanings. 2. Om∣nipotence
(that is) power in his own hands to help,Catechis∣mus. Rom part 3. c. 6. and these are peculiar to God a∣lone] Psal. 65.2. 1 Kings 8.39. with 1 Kings 18.26. Acts 1.24. Esay 63.16. Psal. 50.15. Q For what things must we pray? A. Such things as stand with God Will, and promise to grant: [Look what God promiseth us,3. Fo what. and in what manne he promiseth any thing, the same things and in such manner must we beg them i prayer: some things God hath promise absolutely, and some things with reservatio to his Fatherly wisdome, as the thing themselves, or the want of them, or th contrary to them, shall make most for th praise of his grace, and for final and spi∣ritual good.] 1 Iohn 5.14. Rom. 8.27. Q. For whom must we pray? A. For a all men, the dead b only exempted,4. For whom. and such as have sinned agains the Holy Ghost. a 1 Tim. 2.1. 1 Sam. 15.35 Ier. 28.6 Rom. 10.1. b Eccl. 9.6. Luk 16 26. c 1 Iohn 5.16. [The state of the dead is unalterable; besides, we have no ex∣ample, precept, or promise of prayer made for the dead.] Q. In what manner must we pray unto God for these things?
A. To a right manner of praying three things are required.5. In what manner. 1. It must proceed from the heart renued by the Spirit, and as∣sisted by the Holy Ghost in the very act of prayer, Eph. 6.18. Iude v. 20. Gal. 4.6. with Rom. 8.15, 26.1. In the Spi∣rit. [Spiritual prayer is not only opposed unto lip-prayer, as when the tongue is exercised without the heart and affection, but also unto heartiest prayers of unregenerate persons; a natu∣ral man cannot pray though he cry from the heart as they did, Ion. 1.5. Hos. 7.14. Psal. 78.34, 36. He must be a spiritual man that can pray aright, and also he must be assisted in prayer by Gods Spirit, else he will make unmeet requests and loose his prayers. Iam. 5.15, 16. Q. How shall I know when I pray in the Holy Ghost? A. By three things:3 things in spiritual prayer.  First, if the sense & apprehension of spiritual wants and evils which destroy the work of grace, and hinder Christs Kingdom in us, do chief∣ly stirre us up to prayer: [That is, prayer in the Holy Ghost, there is a natural, and there is a spiritual good and evill.] Psal. 4.6, 7 Q. How, secondly, may it be known? A. By the kind of our importunity: the
desire is not filled, nor the heart at rest, un∣lesse God answer us with spirituall fa∣vours and mercies, no not although all outward good things be granted.

Q. How thirdly? A.

Iohn 5.15. 2 Cor: 12.9. Q. What ground of assurance have we that we shall be heard? A. Gods promise of giving such & such things, and of hearing us when we beg them in and through Christs mediation.

Secondly, and he hath bid us call upon him for the same with promise to heare and answer us: and this is the ground of our confidence.] Luke 11.9, 13. Psal. 50.51. Heb. 4.15, 16.

Rev. 5.13. 1 Chron. 29.11.14. Psal. 103.1, 2. Q. Doe all Gods Children call upon their Father in Heaven? A. Yes, as the Child will Crave, and make his moane to his Parents, so the Children of God be of a spiritual craving
disposition, whereby the soul hangethup on God to receive good things from him [Prayerlesse people be dead and grace∣lesse people.] Gal. 4.6. Zach. 12.10. Psal. 79.6. Iob 27.10. Q. When, and how often must we pray? A. We must pray continually (that is) con∣stantly Morning and Evening, and also upon special occasions.  1 Thes. 5.17. Luke 18.1. 1 At set times, Acts 3.1. Acts 10 2, 9. Acts 16.13, 16. Ps. 92.1, 2. And it is a good thing so to doe: Psal. 55.17. with Dan. 6.10. 2 And upon special occasions, Dan. 9.2 Acts 12.5. Luke 6.12, 13. Q But does the Spirit of God come at, and keep set houres of prayer? Can prayer at set times, be prayer in the spirit? A. Yes, for the spirit of Grace is con∣tinually abiding in us, and with us, and therefore the spirit of supplication also: David and Daniel, Peter and John, did  want the spirit of Prayer, when they kept the houres of Prayer. Q The Lords Prayer consisteth of a Preface and a Body of Petitions; and there be six Petitions of the Lords pray∣er: How be they divided? A. In the first three we begge such
things as doe most immediately concerne Gods glory: In the three latter, such as con∣cerne our good. Our Father. Q. How is God our Father, and why so called. A.

With holy confidence. Q. Why Father, rather then any other name or title of God? A. Because Gods Fatherhood in Christ is it which doth assure our consciences, and
giveth us boldnesse in prayer, comming to him as a Child to his Father, of whose good will he is well perswaded. Math: 7.9, 11 Eph: 3.12. Psal: 103.13, Esay 49.15. Q. Why is he called our Father A. Because all the faithfull have one common interest and propriety in God, and God in them. Mal. 2.10. Eph: 4.6. Q. What doe you learn from this, that you are taught to say, Our Father? A.

A. To shew his excellency, presence and
power, every way able, present and ready to heare and help us, as being the best Fa∣ther, the Lord and Master of all things. [1. He is the best Father, as heavenly things are better then earthly, 2. He is, whereever we are, 3. And he is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and from heaven doth com∣mand blessings.] Lam. 3.41. 2. Chron. 20.6. 1 Kings 8.39. Marke 9 22, 23. John 11.22 29, 40 [This doth wonderfully help our faith that our God is able to forgive sins, to subdue Sathan, to save a soule; and we may expect any thing at his hands better then from an earthly father; yea if some father of ours were in Gods place in Hea∣ven, there were not so much comfort in it; the Lords bowels, tendernesse, sweet∣nesse, freenesse, be as far beyond and above all the love and compassion of the best natural Parent, as the Heaven is above the Earth. Esay 5.7, 8, 9. Psal 123.1. Psal. 115.3. Q. What else doth Gods being in Hea∣ven teach us? A. To draw nigh to God in Prayer with all holy reverence: for God is in Heaven, and we on Earth Eccles. 5.2.

[They spake and thought of God & his works more meanly then of their Idols; they used his word and daies as common things.] Q. When is Gods name hallowed or sanctified? A.

all things God must be acknowledged to be Just, and Holy, and Wise, and Good, & Righteous, Q. Thy name, (comparatively) and in op∣position to every other name, What doth that import? What doe we pray for in that? A. We pray that we may set up Gods name & glory above our selves, above men, above Idolls, and false gods, that above all adverse power it may be lifted up and glorified: [His Truth above every truth, his Mercy above every mercy, &c.

We pray that God would destroy the kingdome of Sathan, and all devices a∣gainst his Church and Gospel, and that all wickednesse may be beaten down more and more, [Till this Kingdome be fini∣shed
in the glory of the Saints, and finall destruction of the enemies.] ps: 68 1, 18. Rev. 12.10, 11. We pray against the do∣minion & power of the Divel, the World and the flesh. Rom, 6.12, 13, 14. Q.

Therefore they be Christs enemies, & they crosse their owne Prayers, that sub∣mit not to the Gospell of Christ, that dis∣countenance, or any wayes hinder the Preaching and spreading thereof, or be friends and favourers of bad men and bad causes. [Such as the silencing and vex∣ing of Godly, quiet Ministers, or depriving them of due maintenance, preferring the unsound, &c. any inlet to prophanenesse, setting up a Chaire for Sathan against the Pulpit of Christ; these and the like per∣sons doe pray for Christs Kingdome, and fight for Sathans; among swearing, railing loose, riotous persons, families, and Pari∣shes, whose Kingdome is there set up? Christs or Sathans?] Luke 19.14, 27. Acts 4.18.

CAP. XLVI. The 5th Petition. And forgive us, &c. Q HEre we pray for the forgivenesse of our sinnes and transgressi∣on Why be our sinnes called debts? Mat. 6.2. A. Because they make us debtors to the Law and ustice of God, to make satisfa∣ction for the offence done to him: [As  Felon is a debtor til he have satisfied the Law.] Col. 2.14. Mat. 5.26. Q How are we freed and discharged of this debt? A. By Gods free grace and pardon, ac∣cepting us in Christ, when we had no∣thing of our owne to pay. [When we had nothing to pay, God provided a price out of his own store.] Luke 7.42. Mat. 18.25, 27. Eph. 1.7. Christ hath cancelled our Bonds Col. 2.14. Q What is forgivenesse of sinne? A. It is a free and full discharge of a sin∣ner from guilt and punishment, whereby a sinner is received into favour with God. [Forgivenesse of sin is not the abolishing of sinne and corruption, by infusing an
habit of charity & holinesse, (as Papists teach) but it is the receiving of a sinner in∣to favour, not in puing unto him any blame.] Esa: 43.25. Esa. 44.22. Mich 7.18. Exod: 34.7. Q Doth God forgive all men their sinnes? A. No: only such as believe and re∣pent, and walke by the rule of new obe∣dience Marke 1.4, 15. Gal. 6.16. Q. What then is the substance of that we begge in this Petition? A. We begge that God would give to every one of us faith and repentance, by which we may be accepted into his fa∣vour, in, & for Christs sake; having all our sins freely & fully done away by him. Ps. 5.1, 2, 7, 9. Dan. 9.17, 18, 19. The best have need every day to pray, forgive us our sins. As we forgive. Q. Why i that condition added? A. Because no man can have assurance that God hath pardoned his sins, unlesse he finde in himselfe a disposition to for∣give his brother [The love of God shed a∣broad in our hearts, begets in us compassion towards our brother, when he hath offen¦ded
us [No unmercifull cruell man can be assured of mercy] Matth: 6.14, 15. Matth. 18.33, 35. Col: 3.13 Rom: 12.19. Q How shall I know that I doe indeed forgive my Brother? A. By two things; First, if I dare not wish him ill, nor doe him hurt, though it lay in my power, no, nor yet rejoyce when evill befals him, though I had no hand in it. Job. 31.29, 30. Prov. 24.17, 18. Ps. 35, 13, 14. Levit. 19 18. Q. How 2dly shall I know it? A Because it is a trouble to me to think ill of another; and I am glad to see any good thing in my enemy, any cause to think better of him, any ground or hope of reconciliation [A Christian is gentle and easie to be entreated, and though some be so perverse and spitefull that one dare not trust them, yet we can be glad of any good thing in them.] 2 Thess. 3.14, 15. Jam. 3.17. Psal. 120.6, 7. Q. What doe we learn from these two words, forgive our debts? A. Two things. First, the dangerous na∣ture of sinne; our sinnes and our names are entred into Gods debt-booke together, and we are every houre liable to be arre∣sted, and brought to an account before
God. [What a case is he in that hath Bai∣lies watching him in every place & cor∣ner. &c. Matth. 5.25. Q. What else doe we learne? A. It sheweth our inability to satisfie for the least sinne, we have no price to pay, we must be forgiven, or else cast into pri∣son for the last farthing. Rom. 4.7. Mica 6.7. CAP. XLVII. The 6th Petition. Lead us not &c. IN the former Petition we prayed to have our sinnes forgiven, now we pray that we may be kept from sinne for time to come. Q. What doe we learne from the order and connexion of these two Petitions? A. All that pray aright to have their sinnes forgiven, must be as earnest to be kept from sinne for time to come, Ps. 15.7 Rom. 7.24. Psal. 19.13. Carnall people can pray for mercy, but the Godly will pray for Grace as well as mercy. Q. What is here meant by Temptati∣on? A. Any thing whereby a man is enti∣ced
and drawn into sin. Jam. 1.14. 2 Cor. 11.3. 1 Thes. 3.5. Iohn 13.2 Prov. 1.10, 11. There lieth a Temptation in most things we have to deale withall: as in Meats Drinks and Apparrel, in Wealth, in Po∣verty, in Preferments, in Examples, in Counselles, in fear of Men, in love of life in our Pleasures, yea in our very callings And unlesse the Lord do gratiously keep us, we shall be enticed and drawn away. Q. What is it to be  Temptati∣on? A. To be tempted is to be assured & pro∣voked unto evil; but to be led into temp∣tation is, when we are deceived and over∣come of the evil. [When we yeeld to the evil motion, the snare is laid and we are caught.] 2 Sam. 11.2, 4. Mat. 16, 35, 69, 70. 1 Tim. 6.9. Q. How doth God lead into Tempta∣tion? A. When hee doth not support and strengthen us against the evil, but leaveth us to our own wit, strength, or lusts, or unto Satan. 2 Chron. 32.31. 2 Chr. 10.15. 1 Kings 22.22. 2 Th. 2.11. Ro. 1.24. Job 1.12. Q. How doth God enable us to resist temptation?
A. Three waies,  1. By making us wise to discerne an evil motion. 2 Cor. 2.1. Mat. 16.13. Neh. 6.11 13. Q. How, secondly? A. By making us a  full over our slip∣pery hearts, and  ctions of fal∣ing. M. 26.1 Prov. 8 1 Thes. 5 22. Q How, Thirdly, doth the Lord enable us to resist Temptations? A. By fortifying us with saith and cou∣rage whereby we cleae to God against all the world. Mat. 4.7. it is written: Eph. 6.11. Q. What do we pray for in this Peti∣tion? A. That God would give us spiritual wisdome and strength to discerne and over∣come all temptations unto sinne; and if at any time he suffer us to be tempted, yet that he would not leave us to our selves to be deceived and overcome of the evil. [We pray that God will hold us up, and deliver us from the power of all spiritu∣al enemies.] But deliver us from evil. Q. What's here meant by evill? A. The evill one, (that is) Sathan & all
his wiles, and subtilties. Iohn 17.11, 12, 15. 1 Iohn 5.18. Iob 2.6. Q. What doe we pray against in these words? A. That seeing we desire to be kept from sinne, we desire also to be kept from the power and wiles of the temptor: [That God would discover his wiles; and help us against him, Gen. 20.6. 1 Sam: 25.33. Zach. 3.2. Rev. 12.13, 16. Psal. 17.4, 5. Q. What must they doe that pray to be kept from temptation? A. In a due sense of our own weaknesse we must shun occasions of evil, we must not cast our selves upon temptations: [For else we are not true to our owne prayers] Iudg: 16.15, 17. Prov. 7.8. Gen. 34.1. Eccles. 2.3. For thine is the Kingdome, &c. Q. These words are for matter and forme, a thanksgiving, What do we ascribe to God therein? A. We acknowledge that Kingdome a over all the world, and b power to doe what he will, and c glorious excellencies do belong to God our Father in Heaven: And we ascribe the praise thereof to him. [The excellency of Grace, Majesty, Mercy,
Power, any thing whereby one may be mag∣nified and extolled is the Lords peculiarly, and transcendently.] 1 Chron: 29.11. Rev: 4.10, 11. a 1 Tim. 1.17. Psal: 103.19. Dan: 5.21. b Psal: 115.3. Psal: 62, 11. Rev: 4.8, 9. Deut. 32.31. c Esay 6.3, 5. Esay 43.7. Rom: 9.17. Q. What is required to an holy and right praising of God? A. Two things. 1. We must labour to have our hearts a affected with his glori∣ous excellencies and greatnesse,Conditi∣ons in right Thanks∣giving. as being the fountaine b of all the good we are, or have. a Esay 12.4. Psal: 126.2, 3. b 1 Chron: 29 11, 12. Psal: 116.12, 13, 14. Mic. 7.18 Q. What 2ly must we doe, If we de∣sire to praise God aright? A. We must endeavour to Live and Dye unto him who loved us first: we must use all mercies which we receive from Him, unto his Honour and service. Psal: 50.23. Ps: 18.1, 2. Rom: 14.8. 2 Cor. 5.15. Rom: 12.1, 2. Q. Wherefore is this clause added to the end of the Lords prayer? A. To teach us that the hearing & an∣swering of our Prayers is grounded on a Gods own goodnesse, b greatnesse, and
c glory: [and by them he is engaged to hear us. We must presse God with the in∣terest of his own glory, power and King∣dome, for hearing and helping of us.] a Ezek. 36.22, 32. b Mic. 4.8. Dan. 3.16, 17. 2 Chron. 14.11. c Ier 14.8, 21, 22. Exod: 32.11, 12. Iosh. 7.9. Q. What must they do that ascribe all these to God? A. We must set a up God in our hearts as upream King, make him our Rock and Fear, not b giving any part of his glo∣ry to any creature. a Matth. 10.37. Luke 12.5. Ier. 10.7. Esa. 8.12, 13. b Dan. 2.30. Q. [For ever,] What doth that word import? A. That Gods a Kingdome, power and glory, in, and over the Church, is e∣verlasting; it failes not: and that the Church shall b ascribe the same unto him in all ages, and throughout all eternity: [When all Kings and Kingdomes shall cease: when we are dead and gone; yet Christ remain a King of the Church, and shall be magnified in it.] a Dan. 7.14. Esa. 50.2. Esa. 46.3, 4. b Eph. 3.21. Rev. 5.13, 14 according to that antient doxolo∣gie used in the Churches of Christ, Glory
be to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,Hooker Pol. lib. . 8. 42. As it was in the begin∣ning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Rom. 11.36. Rev. 5.13. AMEN. Q. What doth that Word import? A. Amen being set after any prayer or thanksgiving, it doth imply our consent, confidence, and desire, that the thing shall be as is uttered Deut. 27.15, 16. Jer. 11.5. Jer. 28.6. 1 Kings 1.36. 2 Cor. 14.16. Q. What followes hereof? A. That we must understand, attend un∣to, and affect the things prayed for; else how shall I say Amen? They that pray in an unknown tongue, or gaze up and down, or fiddle about their cloathes and other matters, and complements in time of prayer, do not bear a part in Prayer, & their Amen is fruitlesse and vaine. 1 Cor, 14.16. Rev. 22.20.
CAP. XLVIII. Of the right Ʋse, and Abuse of the Lords Prayer. Q. HOw may a Christian make a right use of the Lords prayer? A. We may use it both for a Rule of prayer, to measure our requests, & make other prayers by; and also for a prayer it selfe, as it was delivered by Christ. [Christ puts matter & words into our mouthes: Christ taught his Apostles to pray, as John taught his Disciples, (that is) He did not only give Rules of Prayer, & a pat∣terne, but a form for them to use,] Mat. 6.7, 9. Luke 11.1, 2. If you ask, May we pray our Father &c? our Lord Christ gives the Answer, when you pray, say, Our Father &c. Of set Formes PrayerQ Is a Set Forme of Prayer lawful, ei∣ther of our own making, or delivered to us in a book? A. Yes, it is, else Christ and the Pro∣phets would never have delivered set formes to be used by the Church. [God appointed Formes, and therefore formes be not  themselves unlawful: the pray∣er
is not evill, because it is a formed pray∣er.] Num: 6.23, 26 Ioel 2 17. 1 Chron. 16.7, 35. 2 Chron. 29.30 He gives the forme, he sets them the words to be used: and it was at a solemne Fast too. Q. But is a set forme of Mans making lawfull to be used by us? A. Yes, If the prayer for matter and sub∣stance be lawful; and such as concernes us, we may safely use it. [We may use the words of Moses, Daniel, Nehemiahs prayer.] Q. Is stinted prayer lawfull; (that is) set prayer, to which one is confined; and tied to use no other?Of stinted prayer. A. That's unlawfull both in publick and private: he that confines himselfe to book-prayers, or to the prayers of others with whom he joynes, or to set prayers of his own devising, can never discharge the duty of right praying. Ps. 50.15. Jer. 14.7, 21. Ezra 9.6. Dan. 9 5. They changed their Prayers with the occasions. Q. Why so? A. Because  prayers must be made according to our necessities; and neither book, nor men with whom we joyne in prayer, can expresse all o u wants and griefs; nor I my selfe this day, what I shall need pray for to morrow. [Yet it con∣cludes
not that set prayer, or prayer with others, for so much as it doth contain of meet matter to be asked, is hereby un∣lawfull; Because by such prayers we are not stited, but have liberty, both the Mi∣nisters in their Congregations, and our selves in private, to enlarge our prayers as caus requireth. There is addes between lawll and sufficient: such a measure of Pe∣titions is sufficient for the publike, or the family which is not sufficient every way to all my occasions: and that prayer may be sufficient at one time, which is not at another.] Q. But in praying must we not exer∣cise the spirit of prayer? And can that be done in a set or book prayer? A. Yes, the spirit of prayer is, when we begge in faith, with feeling and fervency with sights and groanes; and that is done when we joyne with others, or use set formes as well as in sudden, & ex tempore conceived prayers. [As a Begger in true want, beggs hard if there be any hope of obtaining; and yet peradventure the next day, or to the next man, useth the same words, or to the like effect: the varying of a phrase doth not make it the spirit of prayer.] Mat. 26.39, 42, 44. with Heb: 5.7.
2 Cor. 13.14. with 2 Thes. 3.17, 18. Col. 3.16. [The songs are not lesse spiritual, because set and taken out of the book, if our hearts be affected with the matter.] Eccles. 5.2. Job 22.27, 28. Q. When is the Lords Prayer abused? A. When people say it over without un∣derstanding and affection, or else make vaine and needlesse repetitions of it: [both these are a taking of Gods name in vain] 1 Cor. 14.15. Mat. 6.7, 9. Our duty after Prayer. Q. What is our duty after we have pray∣ed? A. 1. We must Practise what we pray for: our actions must not crosse our pray∣ers. We must not pray and still rebell a∣gainst God. Hos. 7.14. We must joyne our endeavours with our prayers, Gen. 32.9, 11, 12. with Ps. 13.30. 2 Thes. 2.2. with 2 Cor. 11.2, 33. Q. What 2dly must we doe after we have prayed? A. 2. When we have prayed, we must observe how well our prayers have sped, how God doth answer our requests, Psal. 85.8. Luke 18.5. [There is expectation of
answer from God to fulfill our desires; if you knock at ones doore ye listen for an answer: if you preferre a Petition, you will look what answer is returned: so &c. Q. How shall I know whether my prayer be heard or not? How shall I com∣fort my selfe in that case? A. There be foure Rules: First, thinke not thy prayers denied, though they be de∣layed. [God dealeth after diverse manners with his servants; sometimes he answers presently, Dan. 9.21, 23. Esay 65.24. Some∣times he seemeth to stop his eare, and to deny us for divers reasons; as 1. Because he loves to hear the voyce of his children crying unto him: 2. Perhaps thou art not ready for the blessing, 3. Perhaps it is bet∣ter thou shouldest want it. 4. Perhaps thou takest a wrong course to obtaine it. 5. Perhaps thou prescribest to God; and God will give thee the blessing in a way more for his glory, as Christ did.] John 11.3, 6, 15, 40. Gen. 25.21. Q. What second rule have you? A. If God give some better thing in stead of what we beg, or strength to beare the want of our desires, we must not take our selves to be denied. 2 Cor. 12.9. Gen. 17.18. 2 Sam. 12.23, 25. Deut. 3.26. Psal. 3.
4, 5. Psal. 138.3. Q. What third rule to judge of Gods acceptance of our prayers? A. When after prayer we finde our hearts to be drawn to God, and our spirits upheld to continue praying, returning to that duty with fresh delight and hopes, that is a signe we are heard. [It is a signe the begger fares well, where he goeth of∣ten. It is a good signe, when we still goe to God as to our best friend.] Psal. 116.1, 2. 1 Sam. 1.18, 28. Q. Particularly touching forgivenesse of sinnes, how shall I know that my prayer is heard? A. If I get a victory over my sin, if the sense of Gods love doth work in me a love to God again, and to the things of God; [that is a signe our prayer is heard]. Luke 8.46, 47. Luke 7.47. Q But if we finde no token of Gods an∣swering our prayers, what is to be done? A. We must search if there be any ac∣cursed thing that may hinder our prayers; and also we must be humbled for our failings in the manner of our duty. Josh. 7.7, 10, 11. 1 Chron. 15.13. Iam. 4.3 Luke 9.54.
CAP. XLIX. Of the Seales of the Covenant. Q. WEE have spoken of two means of working and en∣creasing faith, viz. the Word and Prayer: By what means is God wont to seale up to our hearts the assurance of our recon∣ciliation with himselfe? A. Two waies: 1. Inwardly by the testi∣mony of the Holy Ghost, witnessing with our Spirits that we are Gods children.Of the wit¦nesse of the spirit. 2. And outwardly by the Sacraments, Rom. 8.16. 2 Cor. 1.32. Q. How doth the Spirit of God inward∣ly witnesse to a man his salvation? A. Two waies: first, by imprinting holy∣nesse and the stamp of grace on the heart thereby shewing us our right to the pro∣mises of life: [as the seale leaveth its im∣pression on the wax, so doth the Spirit. And look where grace is printed, there is the spirit that wrought it: and we have that seale to shew for our salvation.] Gal. 5.18, 22, 23, 25. Gal. 6.16. Rom. 8.13. 2 Cor. 3.3. A seale makes things to be au∣tehntick and warrantable: Deeds and
writings once sealed are good in Law, and we may plead our right by the seale: so &c. Q. How secondly doth the Spirit wit∣nesse with our Spirits? A. By cheering, strengthening, & clear∣ing up the Conscience to see, and ac∣knowledge, and to certifie our hearts of the truth of Grace, so as to make us able to say, I have true faith, and true hatred of sinne, &c, [The spirit saith, They that are called; are certainly saved. Now the con∣science enlightened doth say, 'Tis so and so with me. This is the answer of a good conscience, & the witnesse of two is true, Gods Spirit and our spirits: as consci∣ence awakened can tell David, thou hast done ill in the matter of Ʋriah, so the conscience enlightened and cleared can tell Peter, and make him say with confidence, Lord thou knowest, and I know that I love thee, Iohn 21.17.] Eph. 1.13. 1 Pet. 3.21. 1 Iohn 2.20, 27. 1 Cor. 2.11, 12. 1 Iohn 5.20. Q. But put case our conscience cry peace without any such impression, & cha∣racter of grace on the heart; What then? A. Then it is a false cry, it being but the single testimony of our owne deceived
& several from the true testimony of the Spirit of God, which ever agreeth with the Scripture. [The Spirit of God doth not crosse the word, it doth not blesse whom the word curseth, nor curse whom the word blesseth; and if our own hearts do so we know it to be a false te∣stimony, and a deceived spirit.] 1 Iohn 5.6, 8. Psal 51.9, 10. Q. Put case I finde some works of the sanctifying Spirit, and yet feele unquietnesse in my owne conscience? A If upon examination thou finde any sinne in thy soule, pull it out and cast it from thee, but if there be no sin that hin∣ders thy peace, then thy conscience ought to acquit thee. [Thou art in safety, and in Gods favour by the spirit of sanctificati∣on, whereby thou dost cleave to thy God amidst all fears and doubts.] Esay 50.10. Iob 27 1, 4, 6. Iob 13 15. Thus of the in∣ward Testimony of the Holy Ghost; fol∣lowes the outward. Q. How doth God seale up our Re∣demption to us outwardly? A. By the Sacraments, which to the worthy partakers are particular tokens and pledges of Gods favour & good-will towards us in the death of his Son. [In
the word God speaks generally; but▪ be¦comes home to each particular beleever in the Sacraments.] Q. What is a Sacrament? A. A Sacrament is a seale of the righte∣ousnesse of faith,What a Sa∣crament is. or it is a token of the Co∣venant between God & us, Gen. 17.10, 11. Rom. 4.11. A Sacrament hath two uses. 1. Of a signe promisory to represent. 2. Of a seale to exhibit, and put us in possessi∣on of the things granted by Gods Cove∣nant. Q. Must we be in Covenant with God before we can partake of the Sacraments? A. Yes: for else the outward signes doe not profit: Abraham was first in Covenant with God, and then he received the signe of Circumcision. [Even as we use first to agree upon the conditions before we seale and deliver the deeds] Gen. 15.6, 18. with Gen. 17 7, 10, 11. with Rom. 4.10, 11. Acts 8.13, 21, 37. As in Covenant, and Con∣tract of Marriage, there is first a consent of the parties, and then the writings are sealed, so it is in this covenant of Grace, both we and our Children must be in Cove∣nant with God, before the Sacraments which are the seales of the Covenant can belong to us, Some are in Covenant
with God, only by outward profession, and  such people receive the signe, but not the thing signified, as Acts 5.3. 1 Cor. 10.3, 5. 1 Cor. 11.27. Rom. 2 25. others are really in  Covenant with the Lord, & they receive both the signe, and the things thereby sig∣nified, as Acts 2.41. 1 Pet. 3.21 Our Chil∣dren are taken into Gods Covenant, and so have the signe of Baptisme, Howbeit when they come to age, they must per∣forme the condition of their Fathers Faith, else they forfeit all. Q. The Sacraments of the Old Testa∣ment were two. 1. Circumcision and 2. the Passeover: of the New Testament be like∣wise two Sacraments. Baptisme and the Lords Supper; How do they differ the one from the other? The New from the Old? A. Not in substance, for Christ is the substance and end of all Sacraments; but only in the manner; the Old did lead un∣to, and fet forth Christs death which was to come, the New doe set forth Christ al∣ready come, 1 Cor. 10.3, 4. 1 Cor. 5.7. Exod. 12.13. The parts of a Sacra∣ment.Q. How many parts be there in a Sa∣crament? A. There be two parts in every Sacra∣ment:
1. Some outward & bodily signe: 2. And some spiritual benefit signifi'd thereby Q. What is the spiritual thing signified in every Sacramnt? A. Christ crucified, or the doing away of sinnes, in, & for the death of Christ: [it is not every grace represented by an out∣ward signe, that doth make a Sacrament, but the benefit of Christs passion is that grace which is set forth in every Sacra∣ment. [Col. 2.11, 12. Marke 1.4. Matth. 26.28. 1 Cor 10.16. 1 Cor. 5.7. Q. What followes hereof? A. Therefore those other five Sacra∣ments of the Papists, viz Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, extreame unction, are falsly called Sacraments of the New Testament, as being neither or∣dained by Christ, nor having such Sacra∣mental signes and significations. [A Chri∣stian needs but two things to his being, viz. a new birth, and a growth in Christ, both which are set forth in the other two Sacraments; besides, those five are not common to all Christians that be in Cove∣nant with God, nor yet peculiar to the Christian Churches.] Q. Who is the Author and ordainer of all Sacraments?
The Au∣thor.A. Only the Lord God: None but God can forgive sinnes, & bestow spiritual gra∣ces, and therefore none but God can make signes and seals thereof. [As he alone can signe and seale a deed that hath the right to sell the land: All signes and Sacra∣ments of mans devising cannot teach or help devotion, but only delude and breed superstition. It is a foolish thing to make a significant signe of that which is not in our power to give.] Mat. 28.19. 1 Cor. 11.23. Q. What is the efficacy of Sacraments? Do they justifie the receiver, or work in us that grace which they signify, if the party him self do not hinder it by some grosse sin?And Effi∣cacy. A. No: Sacraments are signes of Gods grace and favour towards us, but not the working causes thereof: [For then the signe should be before the thing whereof it is a signe, which cannot be. Sacraments serve as it were to put us in possession of the Co∣venant, as a sealed deed formally delivered doth of an house or land that is sold: Re∣mission of sins, and oher blessings of the Covenant, are not in the Sacraments, as Heat is in the fire, or as a medicine in a box; But as a Key given in token of possession, or a deed whereby Men are enfeoft in any House or Land, are in Law sure Pawn of the things promised; so are the holy signes,
given to the beleiver. Remission of sins & sanctification of our hearts is from God alone through the bloud of Jesus Christ; yet for the applying thereof unto us, there are diverse means established, as  1. Bap∣tisme, Act: 2.38. Mat: 3.7. Mar: 1.4.  2ly The Eucharist, Mat. 26.28. 1 Cor. 10.16.  3ly Preaching, 2 Cor: 5.19  4ly Prayer, Act: 8.22. Ja: 5.15.  5ly The power of the Keys, Mat: 18.18. Ioh: 20.23. All these are Acts instituted by God,Sacramēts are not physicall, but moral instrumēts by which God be∣stoweth what they represent: the use of them is in our hands the effect' in Gods; for the use we have his Com∣mande∣ment, for the effect his Conditional promise. The Sacraments are not bare resemblances and memorials of things absent, nor naked signes of Grace received before, but means effectual, where∣by God delivereth into our hands the Grace signified by them. Hoker Pol. l. 5. S. 57. & executed by us for that purpose. And therefore although the dead soul, that hath no inward motion of faith to receive the benefit offered, nor any disposi∣tion of heart answerable to the thing that is done outwardly, these means availe nothing. Gal. 5 6. Yet on Gods part offering, and on mans part duely receiving and imbracing them, the outward signe, & the spiritual benefit thereby signified doe ever goe to∣gether: hence it is, that in the Scripture, that which is proper to the thing signified, is sometimes ascribed to the signe; as Acts 22.16. Arise, and be Baptized, washing a∣way sinnes, with 1 Cor: 10.16. 1 Cor: 11.
24, 25. The which is well expressed Art. 25 of the Church of Eng.Gallica Confessio fi∣dei Art 34.37. Harm. of Confes∣sions. That the Sacra∣ments be certain sure witnesses, & effe∣ctual signes of grace, and Gods good will towards us, & in such only as wor∣thily receive the same, they have a wholsome effect. By the Sacraments, God doth quicken, strengthen, & Con∣firme our faith, ibid. CAP. L. Of Baptisme. Q. WHat is Baptisme? A. It is a Sacrament of our engrafture into Christ out of old Adam. [It is unto us an entrance into the Church, witnessing unto us, that whereas we were before strangers from God, a God doth now receive us into his family & people, and we again b give up our selves toge∣ther  with our names unto God through Jesus Christ to walk in newnesse of life. a 1 Cor 12.13 Gal. 3.27. Eph. 2.11, 12, 13 b Mat. 3.8, 11. Rom. 6.3, 4. Q What's the owtward signe in Baptisme? A. The dipping or sprinkling of water in the name of the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghost, Mat. 28.19. for dipping see Iohn 3.
23. Mat. 3, 6 16. Acts 8.38 And for sprink∣ling, read Ac 16.33. in Houses: Marke 7.4. with Heb. 9.10, 19, 20, 21, 22. Heb. 12.24. Q. What is the spiritual thing signifi∣ed by this sprinkling of water? A. The clensing of the soule from all sinne by the bloud of Christ sprinkled on it, Acts 2.38. Rom: 6.3. Col: 2.12, 13. Bap∣tisme teacheth and signifieth unto us that in Christ we, who were dead in sinnes, are quickned, & washed, and all our sins for∣given, by the mighty operation of God. Eph: 5.26. Tit: 3.5. In and by Baptisme God doth two things:  1. He doth instruct us touching Christ crucified, that our sins are washed, and our souls clensed from all sinne by his bloud. 1 John 1.7. Rev. 1.5. 2. He doth apply the same in particular to the party Baptized, Acts 22.16.  For the Sacraments, by reason of the word of com∣mand [go and Baptize them] and of the word of promise of a benefit to worthy recei∣vers [Be Baptized for remission of sinnes, Acts 2.38.] They do tell us that Christ is ours, given to us, and his bloud sprinkled on us, and by this means, (it being a word of promise (and every word of promise is a word serving to beget faith) the spi∣rit of God doth stir up faith, strengthen
and confirme faith in us: God doth not put any such virtue into the signs, as to par∣don our sins and make us Holy, ex opere o∣perato, neither doth God so tie his presence to the water, as if where the Ministers A∣ction is, there God is also, and at the same time; for many have the signe, that never have the thing, as Simon Magus, Judas, &c. and some have the benefit of Baptisme long after, as Infants when they come to age: But none have the benefit of Bap∣tisme▪ but such as come by Faith to be∣hold Christ crucified in and through the outward signs, & so use the signs as means of applying Christ to their own souls for remission of sins. See Art. 27. of Ch. of Eng. Q What is it to be baptized in the Name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost? 1. Goes par- of the Co∣venant,A. Two things are meant by it: First, thereby is testified to the party Baptized, that he is received into the flock & family of God. [God doth avouch him for his child, God doth bind himselfe to us; and make over his Covenant to us. Gen. 17.7. Q. What secondly? 2. Our part.A. The party that receiveth Baptisme doth enter into an Oath and Covenant, to take the Lord for his God; thereby binding himelfs to believe, and serve that true
God who is Father, Sonne and Holy-Ghost. [We are then enrolled, and writ∣ten among the Sonnes of God, Gen. 17.1. Gal. 3.27. 1 Cor. 1.13.15. We avouch God to be our God.] Deut. 26.17, 18. Q. Is it thus with all that are baptized? Doe all receive those benefits? A. No, only they that have, or come to have faith to believe the promises, and re∣pentance to forsake sinne, Gal. 5.6. 1 Pet. 3.21. Acts 8.21, 23 Marke 16, 16. [In Scrip∣ture they are reputed aliens and strangers from the covenants of promise, who have not the sign of the Covenant: 2. And they that reject the signes are reputed to reject the Covenant it self, Eph. 2.11. Gen. 17.14. Luke 7.30. 3. So they that receive the signe of the Covenant, joyning them∣selves to the people of God, are in Scrip∣ture reputed to be of the houshold of faith, & Saints confederate with the Church of God, Esay 56.3. Heb. 9.13. 4 But really and effectually they only receive the bene∣fits which come to have the conditions of the Covenant, viz. Faith, and repentance. Act. 8.21, 23. 1 Cor. 10, 3, 5. Act. 3.26. 1 Pet. 3.21.The duties of them that be Baptized. The duty of all that be Baptized is reduced to three heads. 1. To Renounce The divell, the World, & the Flesh. 2. To
Believe in Jesus Christ, and to maintaine the Faith once delivered to the Saints a∣gainst all Sects and Heresies whatsoever. 3. We promise to walke obediently in all Gods Commandements. Q. Are the conditions of faith and re∣pentance required in all that are to be baptized? A. Yes, in all that be Baptized when they be of ripe age; but in little Children it is sufficient that they shew forth faith and repentance when they come to age. Q. May little Children be Baptized? 1. Practice.A. Yes: the Apostles did baptize whole housholds, in which number were their Children: [As Abraham & his houshold were circumcised (that is) He and his Children, for Ismael was but thirteen years old whē he was circumcised, Gen. 17.25. And there is reason for it; because there is the same relation frō the believing parents to the children already born, as to them that shall be born; and therefore if the chil∣dren of Stephanas and the Jaylor, which were borne after their conversion, ought to be baptized by vertue & priviledge of the parents faith, why not also the chil∣dren that were already born, seeing they are the children of believers: moreover
this practice of baptizing Infants by the Apostle is gathered frō that Phrase, Heb. 6.2. (laying on of hands) which was a ce∣remony used in prayer for them that had been-Baptized in their Infancy,See Calvin Inst. lib. 4. c. 16. § 4. de Confir∣matione. when they were Catechized in the doctrines to be known and believed by grown men that were admitted to Baptisme Calv on Heb. 6.2.] Acts 16 33. 1 Cor. 1.16 Gen. 17.25. Q. Why are Infants of believers to be Baptized? A. Because they belong to the covenant of grace,2. Promises. & Comman∣dement. and be of the number of Gods people, and are inheritors of the blessings which God promised to the seed of the faithfull. 1 Cor. 7.14. Rom: 11.16. Acts 2.39. Mark 10.13, 14, 15. Gen. 17.7, 9, 12, 14. with Gal. 3.16. Rom. 4.11, 12. In those Scriptures Note five things. 1. That In∣fant-membership, & Admission by an outward signe, is as Ancient as any visible Church recorded in Scripture.  2. That the Cove∣nant made with Abraham was the Gospel-Covenant, wherein Blessednesse was pro∣mised in & through Christ the Promised seed. Gal. 3.8. with Gen. 12.3. and that Covenant is to endure to the end of the World. Gal: 3.16, 17.  3. Note the persons with whom God made the Gospel-Co∣venant,
it was Abraham, and his Infant-seed & so with beleevers of all Nations, who have as much right to that promise, (I wil be thy God, & the God of thy seed) as Abraham had. 4. There is a command to marke the Infant-children of the Cove∣nant, Gen. 17 10, 12. The which com∣mand is no where reversed, but rather esta∣blished▪ Mat. 28.19. Baptize al; Infants are not excepted, but rather included in that Promise. Act 2.3. And though the signe of the Covenant be changed, yet neither is the Covenant it self, nor the commande∣ment, to Marke Infants, reversed. 5ly Note what Christ did, and the reason why he did it. 1. what Christ did, He sayd, forbid them not to come unto me—And albeit Infants did not knew what was done unto them. yet Christ gave them both his blessing & an outward signe of it, He layd his hands on them. 2. Next Christ gives a reason why he did this, because to them belongs the Kingdome of Heaven, and remission of sins. Now if Christ esteeme it a sufficient reason, why Infants should be admitted to the signes of his blessing, because the Kingdome of Heaven belongs to them, then who shall dare forbid them? or debarre them from baptisme, the first signe of the
Covenant of Grace? Q. What if the immediate parents be be∣lievers onely in shew, may their Children be baptized? A. Yes, for, First, the profession of the faith is sufficient: 2ly Children of profes∣sors have right to Baptisme by vertue of the first Covenant with Abraham, in whom we have as true an interest as the Jewes ever had, Acts 8.12, 13, 37. with Acts 10.47. Gal. 3.29. Rom. 11.17. [So that the wickednesse of the immediate parent doth not prejudice the right of the child: for then Hezekiah should not have been cir∣cumcised, because he had a wicked father. No covenant or condition of mans making must be set above the covenant & condi∣tions set by Christ, to make them void to beleevers.] Godly parents have some∣times gracelesse children, & Carnal Pa∣rens have sometimes gracious children. Q What can Baptisme profit Infants, seeing they have no faith? A. Very much: for as men by deed and seale convey lands to heirs that shall bee borne, as well as to them that be already born, so doth God by his Promise, which takes its effect in due time. [As Gods Pro¦mise that Abrahams seed should inheri-Canaan,
did not take effect till 430 years after, yet then it spake and failed not. And as our children are taken Tenants, and made members of some Manour or Lord∣ship by the delivery of a white wand, or the like ceremony, when they be little; the which Tenements they enioy when they come to age: so doth Gods covenant of peace and Grace made in Baptisme, take its effect in due time.] God is the great Landlord of Heaven, he puts our Chil∣drens life into that coppy, &c. Q. What if they doe not perform the condition when they come to age? A. Then they can have no good of their Baptisme, 1 Pet. 3.21. Neh. 5.13. [God will shake them out of his Church.] Rom. 2.28. As you put a childs life into a Li∣ving, when he is of age he enjoys it: But if he refuse to do Homage, or to pay the Lords rent, then he forfeits his Living: so &c.
CAP. LI. Of the Lords Supper. Q. WHat is the outward signe in the Lords Supper? A. Bread and Wine given and received as Christ hath ordained. Q What is the thing signified and re∣membred in, and by them? A. The death of Christ, when he offe∣red up his righteous soule a sacrifice for sin, [gave his body to be broken, and his bloud to be shed for sinners,] Esay 53.6, 8, 10. Luke 22.19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25, 26. Q. The Bread and Wine then are not turned into the very body and blood of Christ by the consecration of the Elements, as if Christ should be there bodily present? A. No, by no means:Against Transub∣stantiati- for the Heavens must containe his body till he come again for our full redemption. And it is as im∣possible for Christs body to be in Heaven and Earth, & in ten thousand places  at once, as it is for one of us. [This conceit of Papists is not only against our senses of sight, and taste, and feeling, but also a∣gainst an Article of Faith, namely, the
truenesse of Christs humane nature in his Incarnation; and against that Article of Christs sitting at the right hand of God; Gods Omnipotency doth not make a true body to be in many places at the same in∣stant of time.] Act. 3.20, 21. Luke 24.6. Q Shew some other reasons against Transubstantiation, and the reall presence of Christ in the Eucharist. A. The Bread which is broken in the Sa∣crament cannot be his very body, because his very body is whole, and the Sacrament sets forth Christ broken for us: [There∣fore it is a remembrance, not a transubstan∣tiation.] 1 Cor. 11.24. We set forth his death, we do not kill him again. Q. Shew a third reason. A. All that eat the flesh of Christ, and drink his bloud, in the Scripture sence are saved; But all that eate of the Masse are not saved: [Therefore the Masse and the Scripture-eating agree not.] Iohn 6.51, 53, 54, 57. Q. Shew a forth reason against the bo∣dily eating of Christ. A. Because. if one should eat a piece of his flesh, (as his finger, or foot, &c.) that would not profit, Ioh. 6.52, 61, 63. What if the Souldier that pierced him,
had tasted of the blood which came out of his side, could that have done him any good? surely no, for our redemption stands in the satisfaction which by his dy∣ing he made unto the Law: and the means by which we eat his Flesh and drink his Blood, is not with the Mouth and Teeth but Faith in the heart. Q Then Christ is not offered up a Sa∣crifice for the quick and dead in the Eucha∣rist, [as the Papists teach.] Catechismus Rom. part. 2. c. 4. A No: for as Christ cannot dye and suf∣fer often, so neither is he offerd often. But by one sacrifice of himself once offered, he hath put away sinne for ever. [He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctifi∣ed, by once dying, else were his sacrifice weak and imperfect, like the sacrifices of Aarons Priests. Our duty in the Sacrament is to receive him by faith, not to offer him in sacrifice to God. In the Sacrament God offers Christ to us: we do not offer him to God. Heb. 9.25, 26, 28. with Heb. 10 10, 11, 12, 14 Rom. 6.10. Ioh. 1.29. The offering of Christ once made, is a per∣fect redemption, propitiation, and satis∣faction for the sinnes of the whole World, both originall and Actuall, and
there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone, Art. 31. of Ch. Eng. Q. What followes hereof? A. Therefore the Masse is a very Idoll and they that use it,Papists be Idolaters. or adore it, or ascribe to it the vertue of Christs sacrifice, are very I∣dolaters. The sacrifice of Masses, in the which it was commonly said, that the Priests did offer Christ for the quick & dead, to have Remission of Paine and Guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceipts ibid. Q. What then is the meaning of these words; This is my body? A. Paul tells us, it is the Communion of the body & bloud of Christ; (that is) an ordinance wherein the faithfull have ex∣hibited to them a fellowship in the merits and vertue of the Sacrifice of Christs death,] 1 Cor. 10.16, 17. Exod. 24.8. [as the Cup is called the New Testament, & Christ is called our Passeover, 1 Cor. 5.7.] The Lords supper is a Sacrament of our redemption by Christs death, insomuch that to such as worthily, and with faith receive the same, the Bread which wee break, is a partaking of the body of Christ, and the Cup of blessing is a partaking of the bloud of Christ. Art.
28. of the Church of Eng. Q. What is the end and use of this Sa∣crament?The Ʋse of the Lords Sup¦per. 1. A. There be three especial uses of it. 1. By it as by a token or pledge from God the worthy Receiver is assured that he hath a part & share in Christs death. [The Lord Christ established the New Testament by his own death: all the good things contained in the New Covenant are made sure by the death of Christ the Promiser, & he bids us eat of that bread, & drink of that Cup, in remembrance of the same.] 1 Cor. 11.25, 26. There is a Sacramental U∣nion between the signes, and the things signified, such an union as is between a sealed will, and the Legacies bequeathed by the same: He that hath a Lease sealed knowes that he hath more then paper and wax: so it is in this businesse. Q. Doe all that come receive such a pledge of Gods favour? A. No, onely they that be worthy re∣ceivers; the rest receive meere bread and wine, and so prophane Gods ordinance, and procure judgments to themselves, 1 Cor. 11.27, 29. The Wicked and such as be void of a lively faith, are in no wise partakers of Christ, but rather to their
condemnation, doe eat and drink the signe or Sacrament of so great a thing: Art. 29. of Ch. of Eng. Q. What other end and use is there of this Sacrament? A. It is a badge of our Christian professi∣on, wherein we with believing and thank∣full hearts doe remember the love, and shew forth the vertu of Christs death: And also professe our selves to be the people of Christ, against all Atheists, Sects, Here∣ticks, misbelievers, & loose-livers what∣soever; we are hereby obliged to stand for Christ against all the world, 1 Cor. 10.20, 21. 1 Cor. 11.25, 26. 2 Cor. 6.15. Q. What third use is there of it? A. It is a Bond and Pledge of that Love which Christians ought to have one to another, and of their joynt-fellowship in Christ the Head. 1 Cor: 10.17. 1 Cor. 12.13, 14. 1 Cor. 11.18, 21, 22. Iohn 13.2, 4, 14, 34. CAP. LII. Of right participation of the Lords Supper. Q. WHo ought to be partakers of the Lords Supper? A. Only such as have bin Baptized, & are able to make profession of their faith, & to
examine themselves; that is, Such as are able to discerne the Lords body.] Exod: 12.43, 44, 48. 1 Cor. 11.28. Ezra: 6.21. Ezek: 44.7.] Q What must a man examine himself in? A. Whether he be a true Member of Christ or not;Of self-ex∣amination. [For none else can par∣take worthily of the Sacrament of Christ.] 2 Cor. 13.5. 1 Ioh 5.12. Eph. 5.23. Q. How may that be known? A. If I have a sound faith, and true b repentance, and am c quickned to newnesse of life and d love of the bre∣thren, I am assuredly a member of Christ, a Rom: 11.17, 20. b Gal 5.24. Mat. 3.8, 10. c 2 Cor: 5.17. John 15.4, 5. d 1 Pet 1.22. 1 Iohn 3.14. [For further trial of these graces I referre you to my other small Catechisme, entituled, An help for Young People, &c. Anno Dom. 1640. and it may be fitly bound with this.] Q. A Christian that hath these graces, may yet through carelesnesse come to the Lords table unworthily; for preventing wherof what must we do before we come?Before we come. A. We must stirre up those graces in us, and labour to see our a need of Christ, and to b clense our soules afresh from every new pollution wherewith we have
been defiled, a Math. 5.6. Luke 1.53. b 2 Chron. 30.17, 18. Matth 5 23 24. 1 Cor. 11.17, 18. Levit 15.31. Num: 9.6, 7, 10, 1 Renued faith & repentance is needfull. Q. How ought a Christian to behave himselfe in the act of receiving? 1. In the time of Recei∣ving.A He must discerne the Lords body (that is) he must not use thē as common bread & wine, but consider in them their spirituall relations, & so receive them as tokens of the covenant.Wax sea∣led, and set to a deed, though for substance it be Wax still, yet for use it is to you more then wax, & of more value then al the wax in the Mer¦chants shop: So this Bread and Wine by Christs institution are seals set to his Testament, & with them Christ gives us his Body and Blood for remission of sins, by whom as by Bread and Wine, our spirituall hunger is satisfied, our Graces strengthened, our spirituall Life pre¦served unto Life eternall. [We use our ordinary bread & wine for naturall uses, viz. to refresh and nourish our bodies, but this bread & wine for spirituall ends and uses.] 1 Cor: 11.12, 29, Levit: 10.3. In the use of this Sacra∣ment Bread & Wine, we must behold the love of the Father giving his Son to death, the love of Christ in laying down his life for his friends, & the merit, & al sufficiency of Christs blood to take away al our sins. Q. How may this be done? A I must see and consider in the signes the things signified, and apply both to my own soule in particular, giving thanks to
God for Christ, and for my redemption by him. [This particular application of faith is to eate Christ: Christ gives me to understand that his body was broken for me as the Bread is: and as certainly as I be∣hold the bread of the Lord broken to me, and the cup communicated to me, so we have a true right to him; and he is as truly ours as our meat and drink are ours.] Iohn 6.33, 35, 36. Heb. 9.20. Luke 22 20. Q. What must a Christian doe after re∣ceiving? A. We must pay our vowes, (that is) we must be carefull to performe our covenant which now we have renued with God in Jesus Christ,3. After Re∣ceiving. Psal. 50.14 2 Cor. 6.1. 2 Cor. 7.1. 2 Pet. 1.4. Rom. 2.25. Q. How may we find that we have made a right use of this Sacrament? A. When we are more refreshed with the feeling of Gods favour towards us, and doe grow in newnesse of life. [As the right use of food is to outgrow sicknesse, and ga∣ther strength for the better performance of actions of our naturall life; so when we are more lively and zealous, and get more strength against our corruptions, and Tentations, or any waies grow in the new creature, then have we not received in
vaine.] 2 Chro. 30.25, 26. with 2 Chro: 31.1. 1 Cor. 11.17. when we are bettered by it, then have we received aright. Q. There be some to whom this Sacra∣ment doth not at all belong, they have no interest in the matter; who be they? A. The ignorant & disobedient, that is, such as cannot give account of their faith, or by their wicked lives shew themselves utterly unworthy: [They come not within the judgment of charity.] Ezr 6.21 2 Chro: 30.17, 18. God had smitten them, &c. Ezek. 44.7. 1 Cor. 5.6, 13 Infants and naturall Fooles, and all persons that cannot exa∣mine thēselves, nor discern the Lords bo∣dy, as also all open impenitent sinners, all such persons must not meddle with the Lords Supper▪  Cor. 11.28, 29. 1 Cor. 5.7, 13. Q The least sinne that a man knows by himselfe unrepented, i a just cause to keep himselfe from the Sacrament; But are all the sinnes we knw by other men a just cause for us to keep them from the Lords Supper? A. Not only such offences as are openly known, and scandalous to the congregati∣on; [The rest doe professe with their mouthes, and if they do not believe with their hearts, and repent indeed, they are
no better then Judas, who seemed to be one of the rest, but was not. It is not our own private knowledg or suspicion of the parties unsoundnesse that must put him off, un∣lesse the party be accused and admoni∣shed of his sinne by them that have au∣thority in the name of Christ for the good of the party, and the satisfaction of the Congregation to restraine them; Christ knew Iudas from the beginning, yet &c.] Iohn 13.11, 18. 1 Cor. 5.1, 2. It is reported, &c. Mat. 22.2, 10, 11, 12. Mat. 18.15, 17. Q. Is not the rest of the congregation polluted by the mixture of unworthy per∣sons with them? A. No,The wicked doe not pol∣lute the Godly at the Lords Supper. unlesse they be consenting unto their wickednesse; for Iudas b did not defile Christ; The wicked among the Jews did not make the ordinances of Cir∣cumcision, of preaching in the chaire of Moses, of the Passeover, and of Sacrificing, uncleane unto the godly of those times; Christ himselfe held Communion with the Church of the Jewes, which at that time was marvilously corrupted both in Do∣ctrine and Discipline. a 1 Cor. 5.2, 6. with 2 Cor. 7.11. Cleare in this matter, els not, Luk. 2.22, 24. Luke 3.21. Iohn 2.13. 1 Sam. 2.16, 24. 1 Cor. 11.17, 29. to himselfe, &c.
b Mat. 26.20, 21. He sate down with the Twelve, Judas as he was imployed in the Apostleship with the rest, so he was admit¦ted also with the rest unto the fellowship of all divine worship and ordinances▪ to teach us, that neither is the Sacrament the worse, nor are the Comunicants polluted; albeit some unworthy and undiscovered Hypocrites be in company with them at the Lords table; the Pollution of the Sacra∣ment remained with Judas alone. The state of the visible Church is like to ten Vir∣gins, whereof some were wise and some foolish. Mat: 25.1. To a great house. 2 Tim: 2.20. 1 Cor. 11.33. with 1 Cor: 3.3. 1 Cor: 10.17, 21. Q. Then it is Christs will that evill li∣vers should be excomunicated, to the end they may be brought to shame and re∣pentance? Who to be Excom∣municatedA. It is so; scandalous persons if they o∣bey not the admonitions of the Church but remain obstinate, ought to be cast out and kept from the Lords Supper. Mat 18.18. Iohn 20.23. 1 Cor: 5, 3, 4, 5, 13. 1 Tim: 1.20. Wicked and obstinate persons are to be banishd from the fellowship of the faith∣full (1.) By the Authority (and in the name) of Jesus Christ. (2) Dispenced by
the office and judgement of the Ministers of the Gospel. (3) With the assistance and consent of the Congregation.1. Who to be admitted. 1. All that professe repentance toward God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, are to be admitted if they offer themselves, as Judas; Simon Magus, Ananias and Saphira, and those severall divided parties at Corinth. (which are for that cause called Carnall; 1 Cor. 3.3.) and surely they did judge one another unworthy,If a com∣pany of Men should a∣gree in some evill Action, & we joyne with them then we were parta∣kers of their evill; But when Christians Agree to serve the Lord Je∣sus, if some joyne that do it not as they ought, they joyne with us in our good, not we in their sin, or unworthinesse. and therefore did com∣municate apart. 1 Cor. 11.18, 21. Yet Paul bids them all that were divided into facti∣ons, to Tarry one for another. v. 34. that so their eating together might testifie and maintain their Christian charity and u∣nity in the body of Christ. Neither is there any danger to the Godly by the cō∣pany of them that doe thus professe Faith, Repentance, and new Obedience, though in deed and in truth they be not such as they professe; Because in such a mixt con∣gregation all doe joyne in an acknowlede∣ment that men are saved by Christs blood (and hat is true) 2. And we all joyne in profession of Christianity, and in a solemne
vow and promise of living holy and Chri∣stian lives for time to come [and that we may doe lawfully, and sincerely with them who are not sincere, but meer outside pro∣fessors.] And therefore such mixture of good and bad in that ordinance, can be no sufficient warrant and ground, either for the Minister to refuse to doe his office, or for the people to refuse to partake of this Ordinance.2. Who should for∣beare to come. 2. Howbeit all carnall persons who are conscious to themselves of their ig∣norance, or hypocrisy, that they are not in truth what they seem to be, or are privy to themselves of living in any sin, ought in good conscience to keep themselves back from the Lords table.3. Who must be kept back. 3. And all such Persons as are grosly ignorant of Christ, or else are guilty of grosse errors, and scandelous sins, inconsistent with Faith and Repentance, they ought to be kept back by the discipline of the Church. Q. Thus of the publicke; Are there any private helps of a Christians conversation and communion with God? A. Yes, Many, as private reading, pray∣er, self-examination, calling our waies to account, trials of the grounds of our hopes, private fasting and humiliation, holy medidation, of the worth of things
heavenly, & the vanity of things earthly, of the Attributes of God, of promises, &c. also private admonitions, & comforting one of another. Holy resolutions against the corruption of the times, of our own hearts, &c.
AN APPENDIX, Containing and Explication of certain The∣ologicall Terms & Phrase, frequently u∣sed in English Books & Sermons, & be either not mentioned, or not sufficiently ex∣plained in the foregoing Treatise. GRACE, signifieth in Scripture two things: 1. Gods free favour and love to man: 2. The effects thereof in us; thus faith is a grace, &c. Predestination, is the eternall purpose of God touching the everlasting state of men, wereby of his own free will he or∣daineth some to Salvation, and others to destruction. Election in the eternall purpose of God, whereby, according to the counsell of his own will, he chuseth some to salvation out of the corupted masse of Mankind; not because he foresaw they were or would be
better then otners, but because it so pleased him; to the praise of his rich grace. Reprobation is the like eternall purpose of God, whereby he leaveth others in their sinnes, to perish for ever; to the praise of his glorious justice. Vocation signifieth that work of grace whereby God calleth his elect out of their sins, to receive the Gospell, that is, unto faith and repentance. Conversion signifieth Gods turning of a sinner from darknesse to light, from sin to grace, from love of the world to love of God, from carelesnesse to conscience of pleasing God. Justification signifieth Gods gracious act accepting of a sinner into his favour, not imputing unto him his sinnes, in and for the righteousnesse and death of Christ: or it is Gods gracious act whereby he reconci∣leth an humbled sinner to himselfe, forgi∣ving his sins freeely & fully for Christs sake. Regeneration is the begetting of a spiri∣tuall life of grace in the soule, by the seed of Gods word received into the heart, and made effectuall by the holy Ghost, where∣by we are become new Creatures, to bring forth fruit unto God, the fruits of holy∣nesse and righteousnesse.
Sanctification signifieth the clensing of our Natures: & it is the grace of God infused into our hearts, whereby of unholy people we are made holy in our thoughts, words and actions. Adoption signifieth Gods making Sons of us that were not Sons before: or it is the translation of Sinners from a servile condition under sinne and Satan, to be the Sonnes of God, in and with Christ to enjoy the priviledges and inheritance of Sonnes. Glorification signifies the state of Gods children in heaven. Redemtion signifies Christs delivering of our Soules from sin & wrath by paying of a price, even the price of his bloud for us. Mediation signifieth that gracious work of Christ setting himselfe between God and us, makeing peace, & procuring our acceptance with his father, both of our persons and actions. Propitiation signifieth the removing of wrath, and making of God favourable to us in Christ. Christs active obedience signifieth his per∣fect fulfilling of the Law for us. Christs passive obedience is his suffering of death, and undergoing of the punishment
due to our sinnes: by both which he satis∣fied the justice of God in our behalfe, be∣ing put under the Law, that he might save them that were under the Law. By the Law is meant the covenant of Workes, the way and offer of salvation to them that perfectly fulfill the Law of God in their own persons. By the Gospel is meant the covenant of Grace, that is, Gods gracious purpose and promise of bringing men to salvati∣on by Jesus Christ. The Old Testament is the doctrine of salva∣tion through Christ, taught by Moses and the Prophets, and set forth under certain figures and ceremonies, shadowing forth the death of Christ, and the benefits of Christ, who was then to come. The New Testament is the same Doctrine of salvation by Christ, taught nakedly, without such figures & shadowes, shewing expresly the death and benefits of Christ already come, and exhibited in the flesh. Leveticall we meane any Ordinance a∣bout Gods publicke worship, delivered by Moses, till the Messias should come. By Legall we understand that which the Law of Moses doth require, as legall righ∣teousnesse is such a compleat righteousnes
in every circumstance as the Law doth re∣quire. By Evangelicall, we understand that which the Gospell doth require and accept: as Evangelicall righteousnesse is the righ∣teousnesse of the Mediator accepted on our behalfe. Legall perfection is to be free from sin in every kinde and degree thereof. Evangelicall perfection is to be free from guile and hypocrisie, when in uprightnesse of heart we frame our selves to the whole will of God. Legall repentance is a sorrow for sin ari∣sing from fear of wrath: such a sorrow the Law can work. Evangelicall repentance is such a sorrow for sin as ariseth from love of God, and hatred of sin, which the Spirit of Adoption begets in us, because we displease our Fa∣ther, and dishonour our God. By the Image of God in men, is meant, to be like God in holinesse and righteousnesse. By the fall of man is meant the first sin of Adam and Eve, whereby they fell from that state of holinesse, and happinesse, wherein they were at first created, and plunged themselves and their posterity into sin and misery.
By Flesh in Scripture is meant the unre∣generate heart of man, and that remainder of corruption which is found even in re∣generate persons, whereby they are hin∣dred from doing the good they would. By Spirit is meant the new Man, the re∣newed hert and soule of Man which op∣poseth it selfe against all sin. When we speak of a naturall Man & of the state of Nature, we doe not mean Heathens or Fooles, but all, even the best & wisest among Christians, that be not regenerate & effectually called; forasmuch as they be in no better case then Heathens. When we speak of a Spirituall Man, we meane one that is regenerate & led by the Spirit of God, minding Spirituall things in the first place, and temporall things in a spirituall manner. When we speake of a Carnall Man, we meane them that are led by Carnall and corrupt Principles and doe follow after Earthly things with greatest earnestnesse and delight; and Spirituall things in a formall and carelesse manner. A Sincere Christian is one that walketh with God and to God uprightly, making conscience of every duty, and of every sin, according to that measure of knowledge
which he hath received, and doth not hide his eyes from any part of Gods will, nei∣ther is willingly ignorant of any part of his duty. An Hypocrite, in Scripture, is not one that doth professe Religion, and separate him∣selfe from the sinnes of others; but it is a∣ny one that knoweth Truth, and doth not obey it sincerely and universally; but is partiall, and halting with God in points of obedience: approving himselfe to man, rather then to God. By Civill honesty, which we teach cannot bring men to heaven, we doe not condemne justice and honesty in mens dealings; But we mean meere civill honest men, that is, deluded, & formall Christians, who being free from grosse sins, and outwardly confor∣med to good orders, do flatter themselves in a morall righteousnesse without faith, or any assurance of their particular interest in Christ, or any endeavour to attaine thereunto. By Common Graces, we mean such gifts of Gods spirit as be common to the elect and reprobate, as gifts of Miracles, of Prophesying, and other abilities to spiri∣tuall duties. By Saving Graces we mean the speciall
worke and fruits of the renewing Spirit which whosoever hath received, is un∣doubtedly saved. By Restraining Grace we meane that power of Gods word on the conscience, whereby men do outwardly forbeare evill, though they doe not inwardly hate it. Humiliation is the wounding, and casting downe of the conscience with feare, in a sense & apprehension of the curse of God belonging to our sinfull state, all former hopes of being in Gods favour & in a good case; being now discovered to be utterly false and unsound. Self-deniall signifieth the renouncing of our own righteousnesse and worthinesse as also our own desires, reasons, wits, wills, and dearest contentments for Christs and the Gospells sake, that so we may pre∣serve faith & a good conscience according to the rule of the words whatsoever crosse shall happen to us in so doing. Spirituall Combat is the strugling between the flesh and the Spirit, between Grace & Corruption, in the same faculties of the soul of a regenerate person, our new nature incli∣ning us to good, and to please God, our corruption inclining to carnall content∣ments.
By the World, unto which we must be crucified, we mean the sinfull courses, opi∣nions, waies, and fashions of the world. Lust in any evill motion and inordinate desire of the soule after any thing; as af∣ter riches, honour, revenge, food, prefer∣ment; therefore covetousnesse is Lust, and so is pride, anger, and other motions of the flesh. Concupiscence signifies the habituall indi∣sposition of the heart to that whch is good and its pronenesse to that which is evill; as also every evill motion of the heart that swerves from the Law of God: All this is called evill Concupiscence. By Principles & Principled, we mean the rules and grounds wherewith men are sea∣soned & guided in their course; as carnall Principles are carnall grounds & rules; spi∣rituall Principles are spirituall considerati∣ons moving and guiding in a businesse. Heretick is one that departs from the true Faith; & obstinatly cleaves to error in Doctrine. Shismatick is one that unnecessarily makes or causeth others to make a seperation from any true and found Church to the disturbance of the outward established peace thereof.
By Wil-worship we meane any thing that is brought into Religion, and made mat∣ter of conscience by mans device or authori∣ty without warrant from the word of God By Superstition we meane the ascribing of Holynesse, or any spirituall and super∣naturall vertue, to any creature, gesture, place, day, words, or actions which is not given to the said creature by Creation or divine institution. When we commend Good workes we meane not onely the works of charity and outward pomp but the whole course of o∣bedience in our thoughts, words, and acti∣ons as the word of God requires of us. By Christian Liberty we meane not a li∣berty to sinne, as if we might sin more fre∣ly and safely because of Christs death; but we meane that liberty which Christ hath obtained to us against the bondage of the Law, condemning all that doe not fulfill it: And also our freedome from the ceremo∣nies of Moses Law, and from all human or∣dinances, so that they doe not bind, in con∣science. Perseverance signifies a constancy and cotinuance in faith and obedience to our end. Apectacy is a totall and finall departure
from the faith once professed. Back-sliding is a falling again into our old sinnes for a time, out of which we re∣cover through Gods grace, being renew∣ed againe by repentance. By Spirituall Desertions we meane that trouble of minde, which ariseth from losse of assurance, and feeling of Gods favour; occasioned usually by our backsliding in to some sinne or great carelessenesse and unevennesse in our walking with God. By Temptations we meane sometimes al∣lurements to sinne, and somtimes the exer∣cise of our faith, wherein Sathan labour∣eth to question our Son-ship and interest in Christ: This kind of Temptation is usu∣ally called distresse of minde. Dispaire is finally to doubt of Gods fa∣vour and mercy, refusing to rest on it. Presumption is a conceit that we are in good case when we have no solid grounds to thinke so; it is also a venturing to pra∣ctise this or that without warrant of Gods word. Assurance is the well grounded peace of conscience awakened and enlightned, and quieted upon good grounds that his sins be forgiven in Christ Jesus. When we pray that God would San∣ctifie
any of his dealings to us (as crosses, afflictions, preferments, deliverances, or any other outward mercy) we pray that God would give grace with outward mer∣cies, holy wisdome, and gracious hearts to make right use of them, that in all things we may be brought nearer to God in the exercise of faith, humi∣lity, thankfulnesse and better obedience for time to come. Laus Deo.
TO THE READER. THe foregoing TREATISE (Christian Reader) inti∣tuled Principles of Faith and good Conscience, is so called, because it doth containe, not only points of Faith, and positive Truths touching the chiefe Heads of Religion, but also the most materiall points of Practicall Divinity, (properly so called,) that is, to shew the work of Grace in the Conversion of a sinner, and in the hearts of them that be converted, and how a Christian may judge of his spirituall estate to God-ward.As in cap: 4. 5. 8. 13. 14. 18. &c. I have had some thoughts of publishing a just Treatise touch∣ing the state of Nature, and of Grace, the Translation of a sinner from the state of Na∣ture to the state of Grace, from death to life, together with the Causes, Order, and effects thererf; And this may be done, if God be
pleased to give me Life, Liberty, and Peace to the Church. In the mean time, Accept, and make use of this short Discourse inten∣ded for the good of the Ignorant, and the comfort of weake Christians, [The markes of Gods Children.] Blessed are the Pure in heart—Blessed is the man, in whose spirit there is no Guile, so saith the spirit, Psal. 32.2. and Mat. 5.8.
Markes of Gods children drawn out of Gods word. Of saving knowledge. Q. WHat is the first Marke of a Child of God? A. Saving knowledge is a marke whereby Gods Children may be known from all others. Iohn 17.3.1. Mark This is life eter∣nall to know thee, the only true God, and whom thou hast sent Jesus Christ. Q. What be the properties of saving knowledge? A. They be foure.The tri∣all of it. 1. Saving know∣ledge makes us to see our own Ignorances, and strayings. Prov. 9.10, 12. Eph. 5.8, 13. Rom. 7.9. Psal. 119.130. Pro. 20.27. Q. What is the second property of sa∣ving knowledge? A. It makes a man ashamed to doe e∣vill; and vile in his own eyes. Eph. 5.8, 12. 1 Thes. 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Rom. 6.21. Ier. 31.19.
Q. What's the third property of sa∣ving knowlege? A. It is a guiding light, especially in those things that belong to our own Peace and duty. Psal. 119.105. Rom. 2.20, 21. Mat. 7.5. Q. What's the fourth signe of saving knowledge? A. It is not an idle, but a working knowledge, making a man to abstaine from evill, and exercise himselfe in that which is good. 2 Pet. 2.20. Jer. 22.16. Ps. 119.104. Job. 28.28. Hos. 8.1, 2. Then it seemes that they which know much, and yet are not bettered by their knowledge in Holinesse & Christian life; Also they that by their knowledge can guide others, and yet doe not take to heart the thing that belong to their own peace & duty, their knowledge is but vaine: Rom. 2.20, 21. Rom. 1.18. 2 Tim. 3.5. Lastly all such persons as be in darknesse and per∣ceive it not; All such are blind, and mi∣serable, and wretched, and naked, and think that they have need of Nothing, when as indeed they have nothing of Grace or Heaven; All such people are without know∣ledge, and therefore without God in the world: Rev. 3.17. Gal. 6.3. Jer. 6.15.
Q. Whats's a second marke of Gods children?2. Mark. A. All Gods children are taught of God? Ioh. 6.45. Esay 54.13. Q. How doe you know your selfe taught of God? A. 1.The tri∣all▪ Because I am made to know things a above my Nature and to b love and imbrace things which be contra∣ry to my Nature a Mat. 13.11. 1 Cor. 1.21. with 1 Cor. 2.12. Eph. 1.17, 18. b Mar. 8.34, 35. Luck. 14.26, 27. Q. How secondly doe you know it? A. Because I have a new judgment of men and things, I can look upon sinne and duty, with such eies as Christ beholds them with, that is, I look upon sinne, as upon a Toad or Serpent to avoid it; And upon duty with a loving eye. Ezek. 11.19. Heb. 8.10, 11. Then it followeth, that they who know no more then Nature can teach them, and will believe no more then Rea∣son can comprehend: Also all such persons as doe erre in their hearts, and say with∣in themselves, I desire not to know my sin, or duty, I love not to obey. Heb. 3.10. Such as Hate to be reformed. Ps. 50.17. And love darkness rather then light. Joh. 3.
19. Such as have not Gods LaW written in their hearts. Heb. 8.10. Ier. 32, 40. They that are pleased with sin, and displeased with duty; All such persons are not as yet Taught of God. 1 Ioh. 5.3. Of the Love of God. Q. What's a third marke of Gods child. 3. Mark.A. All Gods children do love God with all their hearts; if any man love God, the same is loved and approved of God. 1 Cor: 8.3. Mat. 22.37. Q. How doe you know that you love God withall your heart? The tri∣all.A. By foure things. 1. When the heart is not divided between Two, he hath not Two to please: God hath the whole soule. Esay 8.12, 13. Luk 16 13. Num. 14.24. Q. How secondly may it be known that you love God with all your heart? A. When I love God above all men, & all things: All men and all things must be loved in God, and for God, but nothing against God, nor above God. Mat. 10.37. 1 Sam. 2.29. Num, 24.11. Exod. 32.32. Q How thirdly may it be known? A When I strive to Honour and serve Him to the very utmost and best I can, &
not as little as we can. 1 Chron. 13.8. 1 Chron. 29.17. Act. 20.24. 2 Kings 23.25. Mar. 12.42, 43, 44. Q. How Fourthly may this be known? A. This is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandements, and his Com∣mandments are not grievous unto us. 1 Joh. 5.3. Joh. 14.15, 21. Joh 15.24. 1 Joh. 3.4, 5. Then it followes, that they doe not love God with all their hearts, whose hears are divided between God & Men, betwen God and profit, between God and credit, or any other earthly thing: Much lesse doe they love God aright, who set up the love of men, the love of themselves, the love of riches, Honour, &c. above the love of God, above the will of God, above the Glory of God, or above the Commande∣ments of God. Lastly they doe not love God aright, who serve him as little as they can, something they will doe, just so much as they think will serve the turne, but their hearts are not lifted up in Gods service. 2 Chron. 17.6. They doe not stirre up themselves, nor lay on their Tallents to the honour of God: whereas we must be zealous for Gods cause against sinne and wickednesse, zealous for Gods Truth a∣gainst error Iud. v. 3. Earnestly contend for
the faith against Sects and Heresies what∣soever. A Christian must love God for Him∣selfe, for those excellencies and perfecti∣ons of Goodnesse, Mercy, Grace, Holiness Truth, &c. that be in God: We must not love God only for his gifts, or for our pro∣fits sake; But as a child loves his Father though he be but poore, and as a man loves his Wife, better then her Portion, so must we love God. Ps. 119.57. Psal. 4.6, 7. Psal. 73.25. There is none in Heaven or Earth that I desire in comparison of thee. Of Zeale for God. Q. Shew a fourth mark of Gods child? 4. Mark.A. Gods child is zealous for God, for his Truth, and Glory. Because thou art neither hot, nor cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth; Be zealus therefore and repent. Rev. 3.16, 19. 2 Cor. 7.11. Act. 17.16. 2 Pet. 2.8. Q. You have said that they that love God, must be zealous for God; Tell me what be properties of true zeale? A. They be three. 1. True zeale must be exercised alwaies in a good matter,The tri∣all. and without respect to the eye of man. Gal. 4.
18. 1 King. 9.10. Iud: v. 3. Luk. 13.15. Q. What secondly, is the property of true zeale? A. True zeale burnes inward, our own sins and corruptions first and most. Mat. 7.4. Q. What's the third property of true zeale? A. True zeale is accompanied with meek∣nesse, justice, mercy: and many other gra∣ces. Jam. 3.16. Luk. 9.54, 55: Luk. 13.15. Then it followes, that all such persons as in their zeale do forget to shew mercy, justice and Truth, as Saul did 2 Sam. 21.2. and as Paul did Act. 26.9, 11. And they which can be earnest against other mens sins, and favourable towards their own; as Rom. 2.1, 22. And lastly they that be earnest and zealous in a Trifle, or in a groundlesse cause, as the false teachers at Galatia were, Gal. 4.17. Such zeale does not commend them unto God? Of love to a Christian for Gods sake. Q. What is a fift Marke of Gods chil∣dren?5. Mark▪ A. By this shall all men know that yee are my Disciples, if you have love one to another: John 13.35. 1 Joh. 3.14. 1 Joh. 5.1.
Q. How may it appeare that you love a Christian because he is borne of God, or because he is a Disciple? A. By foure signes. 1. By this we know that we love the Children of God, when we love God,The tri∣all. and keep his Commande∣ments, 1 Iohn 5.2. That is, we love Gods children because we love God first: Our love to them must proceed from our lo∣ving of God, seeing we love them for Gods sake. Q. How Secondly may Christian love be discerned? A. When you love a Disciple, in the Name of a Disciple, and a righteous man, in the Name of a righteous man, that is, because they belong to God, and because of the Image of God in them: Mat. 10.41, 42. 2 Ioh. v. 1, 2. Q. How thirdly is Christian love evi∣denced? A. When you love a Christian more for the Image of God in him, then for Kind∣reds, or profits sake. Among your chil∣dren, or Neighbours, or Friends and ac∣quaintance, you will love them best and most, in whom you percieve the Grace of God to shine. Gal. 6.10. Q. How Fourthly.
A. If you have true love, you will doe righteous things to your Brother; But he that doth not righteousnesse, is not of God neither he that loveth not his brethren. 1 Joh. 3.10, 18. Then it followeth, that they which doe injury, & that to their Brethren 1 Cor: 6.8.) And they that do like their Children, or Neighbours, or Servants, or acquain∣tance, the worse for their goodness sake, And lastly they that are Partiall in their love, & will embrace only such of the Godly, as be of their own side & opinion, but can scorne & abuse others every jot as Godly, if they differ from them; then, I say, it ap∣peares, they do not love them in the Name of a Disciple, nor in the Name of a righ∣teous man; But they love themselves, their owne ends and Fancies in them, and not Christ in them, nor the Image of God in them. We must love where God loveth, God loves all his Children of what side soever they be, though not their sins and Failings, & so must we doe Luk. 9.49, 50. Rom: 14.3, 6. Mark: 9 38, 39. The weake and the strong Christian, they were both of them true fearers of God: Wick∣ed men that are yet in the flesh, they hate & dislike Godlinesse where ever they
see it, and he that is born after the spirit, loveth godlinesse where ever he sees it. Of Hungring and thirsting after Christ, and His Grace. Q. Shew a sixth marke of a child of God? A. They are blessed that hunger and thirst after Christ,6. Mark. and after the graces of his spirit. Mat. 5.6. Es. 55.1. Rev. 22.17. Q. What be the signes whereby spiri∣all desires after Christ may be discerned from naturall desires? A. They be foure. 1. If your soules do indeed hunger and thirst after Christ,The trial. and his righteousnesse, then you will desire him for spirituall ends and uses; as for Re∣conciliation with God, for sanctification, for spirituall Healing and cleansing of your soules; as your spirituall Physitian: Mat. 9.12. Mar. 1.10. Luk: 18.41. Ps. 51.1, 2, 9, 10. Carnall people can desire mer∣cy, but not Grace: they desire Happinesse, but care not for Holinesse; they can desire Christ as a Priest to save them, not as a King to Rule in them. Q. What is a second signe of spirituall
desires or hungering after Christ? A. If you doe indeed thirst after Christ, you will be restlesse and unsatisfied till you find him: Nothing but Christ can content the spirituall appetite and desires of the soule: Nothing but Christ can still the crie, and quiet the call of conscience. Give a hungering soule Gold, or preferment, or Pleasures &c. These things cannot satisfy a spirituall desire: the soule must have Christ, or nothing: spirituall desires are rest∣lesse desires, till they can enjoy the things they want: Ps. 143.6. Can. 5.4, 8. Ps. 42.1, 2. Q. What's a third signe of spirituall desire after Christ? A. Spirituall hunger and thirst is a con∣quering desire, it makes the soule to prize Jesus Christ upon any terms: the thirsty soul must have Christ, what ere it cost: As the Aegyptians said to Joseph, Buy us and our land for Bread (Gen. 47.19.) and we will be servants unto Pharaoh: so to the hungery soule, every bitter thing is sweet; Christ is welcome upon any terms. Mat. 16.25. Mat. 13.44, 46. Mat. 19.21, 22. Q. Wha'ts a Fourth signe of spirituall desire after Christ? A. Spirituall hunger and thirst is a la∣bouring desire; the Hungry soule will take
any paines for the bread and water of life. It doth not rest in wishing, but it will strive and seek, and knock: True desire puts forth it selfe in endeavourings Can. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. Psal. 63.1.2. Spirituall desires are not lazy, cold, heartlesse wishes. Then if you take little Paines to get Grace, and the assurance of Christs love, or if you prize any thing more then Christ and his Grace and favour, or if your minds be quieted without Christ, and cu∣red by false Remedies, as by worldly Counsels, worldly Pleasures, or by for∣getting your sins, &c. Lastly if you desire Christ for naturall ends, as for mercy, & not also for Grace and Holy Communi∣on with him, then I say you did never truly Hunger and Thirst after Christ, and his righteousnesse: you have had perhaps some light, vanishing wishes for Heaven, but never any sound, and setled desires. Luke 14.15, 18. Mat. 19.21, 22. Of Christ in us. Q. What is a Seaventh Mark of one that is the Child of God? A. If any one be Christs, then Christ is in you, and abideth in you: Rom. 8.9, 10.
2 Cor. 13.5. Eph. 3.17. Q. How will you know that Christ is in you? A. Two manner of waies. 1,The tri∣all. If Christ be in you, you will be fashioned like unto Christ, you will be Holy members of that holy Head, and living members of that li∣ving Head. Rom. 8.10. If Christ be in you the body of sin is dead, and the spirit is life because of righteousnesse; you cannot be dead members of a living head, nor un∣holy members of an holy head: A true Christian is the very Picture of Christ, Christ is fashioned in him. Gal. 4.19. Eph. 4.22, 24. Joh. 2.6. Q. Say the same in other words? A. If any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature, 2 Cor. 5 17. Q. How secondly, will you know whe∣ther Christ be in you or not? A. Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the spit which he hath given us. 1 Ioh 3.24. Then it followes, that if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. Rom. 8.9. Also If you be not like unto Christ if you walk contrary unto him, and his example in the Family, Church, or State, it is because Christ is not in you of
a Truth: for he that saieth, He abideth in him, ought himselfe also to walke, even as Christ walked. 1 Ioh. 2.6. 1 Pet. 1.15. Phil. 3.18. Of the spirit of Christ in us. Q. Shew an Eight marke of a child of God? 8. Mark.A. Because you are sons, God hath gi∣ven the spirit of his son into your hearts, whereby ye cry Abba, Father. Gal. 4.6. Rom, 8.9, 11. Q. But how will you know that you have the spirit of Christ in you? The trial.A. Three waies. 1. Because it is unto me a spirit of illumination: It begets in me spirituall senses, and understanding by which I know him that is True; it ena∣bleth me to discerne things that differ: As the Eare trieth words; and the Mouth tasteth meate, Iob. 12.11.  doth the spi∣rit of Christ give us a discerning taste, a dis∣cerning heart, & eare; It makes us able to discerne light from darknes, sweet from sow∣er; It makes us to Relish & savour the things that be of God. Iohn 10.4, 5, 27. with Ioh. 14.17. 1 Iohn 2.19, 20, 26, 27. 1 Cor. 2.14. Q. How secondly will you know it?
A. Because it is unto me a spirit of San∣ctificatiō; for the spirit of Adoption, where∣by we call God Father, is alwaies in us, and to us a spirit of sanctification, It is a spirit of Burning to consume Lusts, and a spirit of Quikning to newnesse of life. 1 Cor: 6.11. Gal: 5.24. Rom: 8.10, 13. Q. How, thirdly, will you know it? A. By the Fruits of the spirit, which are these, Love, Joy, Peace, Long suffer∣ing, Gentlnesse, Goodnesse, Faithfulnesse, Meeknesse, Temperance, &c. Gal: 5.22, 23. Eph: 5.9. Then it followes that all such persons as walk in the flesh, and shew forth the fruits of it, which are these, Adultery, for∣nication, uncleannesse, laciviousnesse, I∣dolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, e∣mulation, Wrath, seditions, heresies, en∣vyings, murthers, drunkennesse, revilings, &c. Also all such persons as have not re∣ceived the spirit of Christ to enlighten their Minds, make them wise to discerne precious from vile.—And to purify their earts and lives: All such persons as doe ot shew forth the fruits of the spirit in heir conversation▪ they are all of them without Christ because they be void of is spirit, and the fruits thereof.
Of Christ Ruling in us. Q Shew a Ninth marks of one that is the child of God? 6. Mark.A. All that have Christ for their Savi∣our, must take him also for their Lord and King to rule in their hearts: Christ is the King of Saints. Luk. 19.27. Rev. 15.3. Q. How doe you know your self to be a Subject of Christs Kingdome? A. 1. Every Subject of Christs King∣dome is a child of light, and he is carefull to walke in the light. 1 Joh: 1.6, 7. 1 Joh. 2.6. Satans Kingdome is a Kingdom of dark∣nesse; Christs Kingdome is a Kingdome of light. Q. How, secondly, may it be known? A. Every Subject of Christs Kingdom, will yeeld obedience to the Laws. & Mind of Christ. Job: 15.14. Mal: 1.6, 8. Q. How Thirdly may it be known? A. I know that Christ is my King, and I his Subject, by the Victory I have over my own sins; I also am made a spirituall King, I dare not hold up any spirituall wea¦pon against Christ, nor against his word, nor on the behalfe of any sin whatsoever, and in whomsoever. 2 Cor. 10.5. Rom. 6.17, 18.
Then they that be yet under the Power of darknesse, and under the com∣mand of sin, and they that doe not yeeld universall obedience and subjection to the Laws and will of Christ, all such persons doe not belong to Christs Kingdome of Grace, and therefore shall never reigne with him in glory. Of Being led by the Spirit of Christ. Q Give a tenth marke of a child of God? A. As Many as are led by the spirit of God,10. Mar. they are the sons of God. Rom. 8.14. Q. How will you know that you be led by the spirit of God? A. Three waies. 1. Because I am under the command of the spirit:The tri∣all. I will not grieve the spirit of God, but cherish it, and suf∣fer my selfe to be guided by it; as Souldiers are by their Captain, and Commanders, who say to one, doe this and he doth it, to another doe that, and he does it, so is the Christian under the Conduct and com∣mand of the spirit to follow it, even a∣gainst Nature, and Carnall reason; as for example, to love ones enemy, to pray for
them that dispightfully use us, to blesse them that curse us, &c. Eph. 4.30. Rom. 8.13. Q. How secondly will you know it? A. Because the Considerations and Mo∣tives which sway my judgement and choyce in any businesse, are spirituall: As (If I were to give my voice in the election of a Minister) if I cast about how I may pleasure a friend or kinsman, or what I shall get or loose by this or that way, then it is cleer, you are led by a carnall spirit be∣cause the consideration which sway, and prevaile with me are meerly polytick and worldly: But if you consider who is most likely to win soules to God, to advance his Truth and Gospell, &c. then are you in that businesse led by the spirt, because the considerations moving you, are spiritu∣all. When there is a conflict between Na∣ture & Grace, the spirit of God will sway you for gracious purposes against the plea∣dings of flesh and bloud. Gal. 1.16. Eph. 4.16. Heb. 11.24, 25. Q. How thirdly will you know it? A. Because I am led by a TrueGods spi∣rit does not lead us blindfold, but it shewes us, and leads us in the waies of God. light, & a straight rule, Gods spirit does never lead one blindly, nor by a false Rule▪ Gods spi∣rit is not like to an Ignis fatuus, to lead in∣to
by-pathes of error and mischiefe, Gods spirit it guides us in the path of Gods word, Gods spirit and Gods word are ever joy∣ned together. Es. 29.18. Ps. 25.5, 9. Ps. 27.11. Ps. 119.35. Ioh. 16.13. Esa. 59.21. Prov. .23. Then they that wander in by-paths of error, and in the broad paths of destructi∣on & unpapinesse, (following the waies of unrighteousnesse, Pride, Covetousnesse Envy, Murther, Lying, Covenant-brea∣kers, perjured persons, without naturall affection, implacable, unmercifull, mur∣therers of Fathers, Lawlesse, disobedient, &c.) and yet say that they are led by the spirit of God, This is the spirit of your Father the divell, and not the spirit of God. 1 Tim. 1.9, 10, Rom. 1.30, 31. 2 Tim. 3.2, 3, 4. Ioh. 8.44. Also they that are swayed by worldly considerations, by selfe-ends and interests, they that walke by cruked rules, and dark lights, and are not afraid to quench the spirit of God, and to check good mo∣tions of of the spirit, to follow their own Imaginations, &c. Such persons are not led by the spirit, of God, they are not un∣der the command & conduct of the ho∣ly spirit.
Of the spirit of Truth and Error. Q. Shew an eleventh marke of Gods children? A. Gods children are led by his spirit into all saving Truth,11. Mar. so that they cannot damnably erre, or be deceived. Joh. 16.18. Mat. 24.24. 2 Tim. 2.19. 1 Joh. 2.27. Q. How shall we know the spirit of Truth from the spirit of error? The tri∣all.A. By three things. 1. He that is of God Heareth us; He that is not of God, heareth us not, hereby know we the spirit of Truth, and the spirit of error. 1 Ioh. 4.6. with Iohn 8.47. He that is of God, heareth Gods words delivered by the mouth of his Ambassadors; hence it is cleare, that it is a false spirit, that saies, ye need not heare us, for my sheep heare my voice, speaking in my servants to the end of the world. Joh. 10.27. with Luk. 10.16. He that de∣spiseth you, despiseth me. The Spirit of God never perswades any man to forsake the publicke ordinances. Mat. 10.41. but to receive & honour a Prophet in the name of a Prophet. 1 Thes. 5.12, 13. Q. How Secondly, may the spirit of er∣rour, or a false Prophet be knowne?
A. You shall know them by their fruits, that is by the Fruite of their doctrine, for if their doctrines tend to loosnesse, or Liber∣tinisme, or to withdraw from duty, or to overthrow what God hath established, and to dissolve the Bonds of Order, Peace, Unity, Obedience to Lawfull Superiours, or to the overthrowing of the Common Rules of Right and Wrong which are e∣stablished by Scripture and wholsome Lawes, for certain such teachers are not of God; the reason is, because Gods spirit does never crosse it selfe, we must believe no spirit against the voice of the publicke spirit, which speaketh in the Scriptures. 2 Pet. 1.21. Mat. 7.15, 16. Q. How thirdly, may the spirit of Er∣rour be discerned? A. If their Doctrines and Teaching doe agree with the forme of sound words, and with the Principles of the Christian faith once delivered to the Saints (as with the Articles of the Creed, the Confessions of Faith of other reformed Churches, & the purest Ages) then is to be suspected for its Novelty and singularity, yea to be rejected as false; because Truth will still Agree with Truth, and Light with Light. But whatsoever is contrary to light, is dark∣nesse
2 Tim. 1.13. with 1 Tim. 6.3, 4. 2 Ioh. v. 10. 2 Cor. 11.4. Gal. 1.8. Iud. v. 3. 1 Cor. 14.32, 36, 37. Came the word of God from you? or to you only? Then they that hold strange opinions, and teach other doctrines, and consent not to wholsome words, or if the fruite of that Doctrine and Teaching be bitter, tending to Licentiousnesse, Rebellion, & Confu∣sion, if any Man shall turne you away from hearing the faithfull Ministers of Jesus Christ, this is from the spirit of Error, this favours not of the spirit of God. Of Mortification, or Crucifying the Lusts of the Flesh. Q. Give a twelveth marke of one that is a Child of God? 12. Mar.A. They that are Christs have Crucifi∣ed the flesh with the Affections and Lusts Gal. 5.24. Q. How know you that your Lusts are crucified? A. By three things. 1. If sin be cruci∣fied in you,The tri∣all. then your corruptions will be a burthen to you, and you will gladly be rid of them, As when the Foot or any o∣ther member of the Body is dead and
Gangrened, we are willing to have them cut off, though as long as they were sound and alive, we did cherist them: so though formerly you did cherish your Lusts, yet when they are mortified, and crucified, you will cut them off, and cast them from you, yea though it be a right hand, or eye. Mat. 5.29, 30. Rom. 7.24. Gal. 5.17. Q. How, Secondly, may this be known? A. If your Lusts be mortified, then you will take part with the word of God against your selves, against your dearest sins, you can welcome a reproofe, even when it cuts to the quick, and meets with your in∣most corruptions. Ps. 141.5. 2 Sam. 12.13. 1 Sam. 3.13, 18. Q. How; Thirdly, may this be known? A. If sin be dead, and the Flesh crucifi∣ed, then you will not minde the things of the flesh, nor obey it is the lustings and mo∣tions of it. Rom. 8.5. Rom. 6.12, 12, 13, 22. Rom. 13.14. Then they which give way to the flesh, and obey the Lustings of it, and doe make provision for the flesh to fulfill the lustings of it; Also such persons as are unwilling to part with their deer sins, yea fret at the word that reproves them and fall out with the Minister of God, insteed of failing out
with their own sins, All such persons have not as yet crucified the flesh with its affections. Of Obedience and Sanctification. Q. Shew a thirteenth marke of Gods Children? A. Sound, and sincere obedience is a marke whereby Gods people may be known from all others.13. Mar. Rom. 6.16, 17, 1. Joh. 3.9. 1 Pet 1.2. Ps. 15.2. 1 Chron. 26.17. Q. What be the signes and properties of a sincere and upright Christian? A. They be Five. 1. It is a signe of an upright heart,The tri∣all. when I make conscience of secret sins, & secret duties, Mat. 23.25, 26, 27, 28. Ps. 18.21, 22, 23. Q. What is a second signe of an upright heart? A. When I strive against Hypocrisy, I would not be an Hypocrite. Job. 34.32. Ps. 139 23, 24. Q. What's a third signe of sincere obe∣dience. A. When our obedience is Ʋniversall, and Regulated, making greatest Conscience of the greatest & waightiest matters of the Law and will of God: We must not stick
at lesser matters, and swallow greater. Mat. 23.23. Ps. 119.6, 104. Mat. 5.20. Q. Whats a fourth signe of an upright heart in point of obedience? A. The sincere heart will strive to doe all things, not as pleasing men but God, which trieth the heart: The servant of Christ must not be a Man pleaser. 2 Thes. 2.4. Ga. 1.10. Ioh. 8.29. Q. Yea but who is a man-pleaser? A, 1. If ye conferre with flesh and bloud, & consult with selfe ends and inte∣rest, when your duty lies before you, whether you were best to do it or not, then you are not upright before God: A sound Christian must be through for God, still approving our selves to God through good and ill report, through Plenty and want, through honour and dishonour, &c. 2 Cor. 6.4.8. Gal: 1.6. Q. What, Secondly, is a signe of an hyhocriticall Man-pleaser. A. If you feare more to offend a Man then to offend God, it is because the heart is not upright before God. Es. 15.7, 12, 13. Iob. 32.21, 22. Luk. 12.1, 2, 4, 6. Q. What is a Fifth and last signe of an upright heart? A. If you will be sincere, you must not
seek your own glory, but the glorly of him that sent you, and imployes you: Ioh: 3.29, 30. Ioh: 7.18. He that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is True. Then they that seeke their own glory, and the Pleasing of Men, they that so order and alter their opinions, and Principles, as may exalt themselves, and humour times, and serve Turnes—Also they that strain at a Gnat and swallow a Camell, that is, stick at a circumstance or Ceremony, & swallow greater matters of the Law, [To busy ones selfe; and strive to be expert and cunning in those truths which con∣cerne ceremony and matter of Church discipline, and yet neglect matters of Faith Repentance, Mortification, and new Obedience, is a shrewd signe of hy∣pocrisie.] Lastly, they that can take liberty to secret sins, and study to hide their sins, regarding more the eye of man, then the eye of God, such people are nor sound in their obedince. Of Sanctification, How it differs from civill Honesty. Q. Shew a fourteenth marke of Gods children?
A. All Gods elect are given to Christ as his peculiar ones to be Redeemed, San∣ctified, and fitted for Glory. Ioh. 17.6, 8. Col. 1.12, 13. 2 Thes. 2.13. Heb. 12.14. Ioh: 3.3. Iohn 13.8. Gal. 6.6. Q. Wherein does sanctification and the true change of a Christian consist? wherein does it excell the highest pitch of the best moralized Hypocrite, and formalist in the World?The triall. A. In Four things. 1. In the Change it selfe, Sanctification is not only an acciden∣tall outward change of the Actions (as of the Sow that is washed. Pet. 2.22.) But it is a change of the very frame and dispo∣sition of the heart, the very nature is chan∣ged, he is made a new Creatures, Ezek. 36.25, 26. A new heart will I give you, &c. A Swine that is washed, is a swine still, and his nature is to wallow in the mire; But a sanctified person, of a swine is made a sheep, and he hates to wallow in the mire. Q. Wherein Secondly, doth sanctifica∣tion excell morall honesty? A. In the root or seed of graces: The graces of sanctification have a root within us, even the spirit of life which is in Jesus Christ, Rom. 8.2. 1 Pet. 1.23, 24. 1 Ioh. 3.9. His seed remaineth in him, and our graces
are the fruits that spring up of that seed and root, Ioh. 15.16. But the seeming gra∣ces of unregenerate and meerly civilized people, they have no such root, but they are like the Corne upon the House top, which makes a faire shew, yet it hath nei∣ther root, by seed, nor fruit in the eare. Psa. 129.6, 7. Luk. 8.13. Q. Wherein, thirdly, does Sanctification excell morall Honesty? A. The true convert does receive the word in power, and in the Holy Ghost: he gives the word a divine power and au∣thority over his conscience, and over his actings: He receives the word with an ho∣nest heart, even with patience though it crosse and cast downe his contentments, and particular interests: you will not dare to resist any Truth that you heare, if you have true grace in you. 1 Thes. 1.5. Luk. 8.15. Ps. 119.161. Q. Wherein, fourtly, doth Sanctificati∣on goe beyond morall Honesty? A. In the motives to obedience: The sanctified person, whatsoever he does, he doth it out of duty pressing the conscience, & out of love inclining the Affection. This is the true ground, and motive of sound obedience to doe a duty out of a pure
Conscience of Love and faith unfained, this is acceptable in Gods sigh. 1 Tim. 1.5. Eph. 6.7. 1 Ioh. 5.2. whereas the Hypo∣crite hath ever an eye to himselfe: Self-ends and selfe respects doe usually keep up the course of his duties. Hereof it followes, that they are not truly sanctified which cannot give the word a divine preheminence in their souls to reforme their hearts and lives. Ezek. 33.30, 32.—Neither are they Truly con∣verted that can Hate one sin and allow ano∣ther. Es. 58.3. Rom. 2.22. Not they which outwardly are washed but are not inwardly changed & renewed. Nor lastly they which have some outward shews of goodnes with∣out a seed of Grace in their hearts; seeing all the good they doe, and all the evill they forbeare does proceed from restrain∣ing Grace, and outward respects moving and setting them on worke, all this does not amount to saving Grace. Observe this for a Truth, such Christians as have no better Principles of acting and performan∣ces then morall Education can furnish them with; Also such as content themselves with a Negative goodnesse, as to say, I am no Papist, nor Thiefe, nor Whoremonger,
&c. Also they that can stay in such duties of the first and second Table as may pre∣serve the credit and esteem of Moderate, well bred, civill honest men in the places where they live, yet are not equally careful and conscionable of the duties of Piety and Religion, but remaine all this while unacquainted with the grounds of Faith and pure worship of God, and so the good things they doe, they doe them without knowledge and conscience of, or respect unto their injunction in the word of God; All such persons are as yet but strangers to the life of Grace: they have not as yet exceeded, what a Pharisee, or a Heathen may doe. Of Restraining and Renewing Grace. Q. Shew farther, for conclusion, some differences betweene Restraining Grace, and Renewing Grace,15. Mar. for all Gods chil∣dren are renewed in the spirit of their minds,The tri∣all. Eph. 4.23. A. 1. Restraining grace, if it be only re∣straining, hath painfulnesse in it, and an in∣ward discontent as the Bridle that keeps them in: Gods word is as Cords & Bonds
to them Ps: 2.3. Mark: 6.20. Herod feared Iohn &c. But now the heart truly renew∣ed desireth to be restrained. Iob. 34.32. That which I see not, Teach thou me. Ps 19.13. Ps: 119.32. Q. How Secondly, may restraining Grace be known from Renewing Grace? A. Men Meerly restrained will stretch their liberty as farre as they can, and when Meanes of restraint be removed, they will grow loose and licentious: as Joash, did when Jehoiada was dead. 2 King. 12.2. with the 2 Cron: 24.17, 18. But the heart thats renewed and truely sanctified, will not doe all that he may, he will rather doe lesse, he will deny him∣selfe some things which he might doe, e∣specially if it be not expedient for time, & place. 1 Cor: 10.23. 1 Cor: 6.12. Q. What's a third difference between restraining, and renewing grace? A. Men meerly restrained doe abstaine from evill for feare of Wrath, or feare of Laws, and shame in the world; or perhaps one sin keeps in another, as the ambitious person, will avoid Drunkennesse, because men of a debaucht life are not fit for high places. So the presence of a Godly
grave man, does stop the mouth of a vain swearer, &c. But the heart that is renewed, eschews evill because it is displeasing unto God: He will oppose and resist sin, out of an inward Principle of Grace, and hatred of sin, the spirit of God in them, lusteth against the flesh: &c. Gal. 5.17.
Generall Rules of Holy life and Conversation. 1. EVery Christian may and ought to be assured of his own Salvation. 2 Pet. 1.5, 7. 2 Cor. 13.5. 2. No man can be assured thereof but by the word of God working spirituall and supernaturall effects, and changes in the understanding, in the Heart and affecti∣ons: By the which change our effectuall vocation & future salvation is witnessed and sealed to our consciences. Gal. 6.7, 8, 15. 1 Joh. 1.6, 7. 3. It is not enough for a Christian to be Baptized, to be bred up in the true Reli∣gion, to come to Church, to cry Lord, Lord, and to live civilly, unlesse thou have a sound Faith which worketh by love, unlesse thou be a New Creature: Outward
Profession will not serve the turne, nor stead thee to salvation unlesse thou finde inwardly those effects which the word & Sacraments expresse outwardly. Rom. 2.25, 28. Gal. 5.6. Jer. 9.26. 4 Repentance doth not stand only in an outward forbearance of sin, but there must be also an inward loathing & hatred of sin, together with a striving against the cor∣ruptions of our hearts, there must be a new frame of heart, and soul, making us to doe all things. 1. By new Principles of obedience, viz. Faith and Love 2. By new Rules, viz. the word of God: & 3d for new Ends, namely how God may be honoured, and our own finall and exter∣nall peace procured. 5. A Christian must look to find in him∣selfe some singular thing which cannot be found in an Hypocrite, nor in the best morall Man in the World. Mat. 5.47. And seeing there are but few that shall be sa∣ved, we must strive to go the narrow path that lead to life. Luk: 13.24, Luk: 6.33. 6. A singular love & affection is to be borne towards all that feare God, even
because they fear God and have Gods I∣mage on them. Mat: 10.41. 7. A speciall regard must be had of the Lords day, to spend the Lords day in the Lords work, and not in wordly plea∣sures or profits Es: 56.6. Es: 58.13. 8. A precise conscience must be made of the least sin by every one that desireth to stand in the favour of God, as of lesser Oaths (by ones Faith and Troth) and also of Idle words. Ps 119.6. Mat. 12.36. Jam. 2.10. Sins of Omission are to be avoided as being more dangerous then sins of Com∣mission: The heart is wonderfully hard∣ned and estranged from God by neglect and omission of good duties. 10. A Christian must exercise Justice Truth and Fidelity towards all men, even the worst, not daring to wrong any man in the least pin, or farthing. Luk: 16.10. Mat. 16.26. Ezek: 22.13, 14. Es: 63.8. 11. A Christian must make Conscience of doing good things in a good manner, that is with the spirit, and with the affe∣ctions
of the inward man, and unto spiri∣tuall ends, viz. to please God and edify his own soule. 12. A Christian must seperate from the sin∣full Manners, Customes, Courses, Fashi∣ons, and waies of the World: He must not fashion himselfe to the World: All familiar society with wicked men is to be avoided. Rom. 12.2. Es. 8.11, 12. Ier. 15.19. Ps. 1.1. Eph. 5.7, 11. Phil. 2.15. Ps. 26.4, 5. Mat. 24.49. 2 Cor. 6.17. 13. A Christian must neither feare nor please man against God, he must not feare their threats, nor their reproches, nor yet prize their favours, and so forget God his ma∣ker. Es. 3.22. Es. 51.7, 12. Luk. 1.26, 27. Heb. 12.4.Of Cal∣lings. 14. A Christian must live in some honest calling, and be conscionable therein, do∣ing the duties thereof, as the work which God sets him about, And not like the Oxe or Horse, who doe their worke, but not in knowledge nor obedience to God. we must doe the businesse of our callings faithfully and obediently as unto God, studying to honour him, and to adorne
our holy profession in that ranke and place wherein God hath set us. 15. A Christian in his calling must exercise the graces of the spirit, viz. Patience, Ju∣stice, Equity, Mercy, Truth, Faith, and Dependance on Gods promises & provi∣dence in all his waies: our generall call∣ing of Religion and Christianity, must be expressed in the use of our particular callings. He that is not Godly and good in his calling, is good no where: 16. A Christian must enter upon the duties of his calling with Prayer, craving Gods blessing and strength, his pardon for fail∣ings, his protection in our waies, And al∣so his grace to preserver us from those snares and Temptations unto which in our callings we are most subject, and ex∣posed, whether it be unto Idlenesse, fro∣wardnesse, uncheerfullnesse, disconten∣tednesse, distrustfulnesse, covetousnesse, vaine glory, &c. 17. A Christian should labour to see all things in God, and from God, the foun∣tain of Wisdome, Power, Goodnesse, and Mercy; we must labour to see and meet
God at every turne. Ps: 73.13. Ps: 22.17. 18. A Christian must never prosecute any earthly thing so as for perishing things to lose spirituall and eternall things Mat: 16:26. 19. Never be thou so passironately addicted to any cause, work, or end (be it never so good) as to carry it on by unlawfull means and waies, God is all sufficient in his own waies. And it is better to suffer any evill of affliction, then to doe any evill of sin: Resolve to stick to Gods waies what ever the issue may be. 20. Never meddle without a warrant or call∣ing, nor above thy strength. Ps. 131.1. Let it never be sayd to thee in reproach, who art thou? Who gave thee this Authority, or who required this at thy hand? 21. Doe the most necessary duties of thy calling first and most. 22. Never lock up thy comfort in the Creature, but let God be thy portion and thy exceeding greate reward: (Use the World, as if thou usedest it not.)
23. A Christians recreations must be. 1, Harmlesse and without offence to others, & without scrupulosity to our owne con∣sciences. 2. They must not master us nor overrule our affections, but our recreati∣ons must be such as we can use for refresh∣ments without losse of the graces, of Pa∣tience, Charity, justice, Truth, &c. & with∣out wasting of our pretious time, & E∣states: We must not exchange better things for sports. 24. God hath given us all things plentiful∣ly to enjoy, yet with moderation; a Chri∣stian must never eat nor drink to make the head heavy, nor the heart heavy. 25. A Christian must not be ashamed of God and Godlinesse here before men; Grace is a Christian crown. 26. A Christian must prepare to meet with crosses & reproaches in the World for a good conscience sake, and yet not be dis∣couraged thereby. Es: 8.18. Gal. 4.29. Ps. 14.10. Ps. 38.20. Pro: 29.27. Act. 28.22.
27. A Christian can never be sound in Re∣ligion that doth not prize and highly e∣steeme the Publicke Ordinances, and Mi∣nisters of God: We must delight to meet God in his Ordinances, & we must give up our hearts to be ruled and directed by them. FINIS.
