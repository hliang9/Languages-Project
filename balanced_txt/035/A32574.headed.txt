By the King. A PROCLAMATION, For the observation of the Nine and twentieth day of May instant, as a day of Pub∣lick Thanksgiving, according to the late Act of Parliament for that purpose. CHARLES R. WHereas by the Act made in Our late Parliament, held at Westminster in the Twelfth year of Our Reign, Entituled, An Act for a perpetual Anniversary Thanks∣giving on the Nine and twentieth day of May, reciting, That for as much as Almigh∣ty God, the King of Kings, and sole disposer of all earthly Crowns and King∣doms, had by his all-swaying Providence and Power, miraculously demonstrated in the view of all the World his transcendent Mercy, Love, and Graciousness to∣wards Us and all Our Loyal Subjects of this Our Kingdom of England, and the Dominions thereunto annexed, by Our most wonderful, glorious, peaceable, and joyful Restauration to the actual possession and exercise of Our undoubted Hereditary, Soveraign and Regal Authority over them (after sun∣dry years forced Extermination into Foreign parts, by the most Trayterous Conspiracies and armed Power of Usurping Tyrants, and execrable and perfideous Traytors) and that without the least op∣position or effusion of blood, thorow the Unanimous, Cordial, Loyal Uotes of the Lords and Commons in the said Parliament Assembled, and passionate desires of all other Our Subjects; which unexpres∣sible blessing (by Gods own most wonderful dispensation) was compleated on the Nine and twentieth day of May last past, being the most memorable Birth-day not onely of Us, both as Man and Prince, but likewise as an actual King, and of this and other Our Kingdoms, all in a great measure new-born and raised from the dead, on this most joyfull day, wherein many thousands of the Nobility, Gentry,
Gentry, Citizens, and other Our Lieges of this Our Realm, conducted Us unto Our Royal Cities of London and Westminster, with all possible expressions of their publick joy, and Loyal affections, in far greater Triumph then any of Our most Uictorious Predecessors, Kings of England, returned thither from their Foreign Conquests, and both Our then Houses of Parliament, with all dutifull and joyful de∣monstrations of their Allegiance publickly received, and cordially congratulated Our most happy Arri∣val and Investiture in Our Royal Throne at Our Palace at Whitehall; upon all which considerations, that being the day which the Lord had made, and crowned with so many publick blessings, and signal deliverances, both of Us and Our People, from all Our late most deplorable Confusions, Divisions, Wars, Devastations and Oppressions: To the end it might be kept in perpetual remembrance in all ages to come, and that We would with all Our Subjects of this Our Realm, and the Dominions there∣of, and Our Posterities after Us, might Annually celebrate the perpetual memory thereof, by sacri∣ficing their unfeigned hearty publick thanks thereon to Almighty God, with one heart and voice in a most devout and Christian maner, for all these publick benefits received and conferred on Us on that most joy∣ful day; It was therefore by Authority of the same Parliament Enacted, That all and singular Mi∣nisters of Gods Word and Sacraments, in every Church, Chappel, and other usual place of Divine Ser∣vice and publick Prayer, which then were, or then after should be within this Our Realm of England, and the respective Dominions thereof, and their Successors, should in all succéeding ages annually Celebrate the said Twenty ninth day of May, by rendring their hearty publick Praises and Thanksgivings unto Almighty God, for all the fore-mentioned extraordinary Mercies, Blessings and Deliverances received, and mighty Acts done thereon, and declare the same to all the people there assembled, and the generati∣ons then, and yet to come, that so they might for ever praise the Lord for the same, whose Name alone is Excellent, and his Glory above the Earth and Heavens. And it was further Enacted, That all and every person and persons inhabiting within this Our Kingdom, and the Dominions thereunto belonging, should upon the same day annually resort with di∣ligence and devotion, to some usual Church, Chappel, or place where such publick Thanksgivings and Praises to Gods most Divine Maiesty shall be rendred, and there orderly and devoutly abide during the said publick Thanksgiving, Prayers, Preaching, singing of Psalms, and other Service of God there to be used and ministred. And to the end that all persons might be put in minde of their duty thereon, and be the better pre∣pared to discharge the same with that Piety and Devotion as becomes them, It was further Enacted, That every Minister should give notice to his Parishoners publickly in the Church at Morning Prayer the Lords day next before every such Twenty ninth of May, for the due observation of the same day, and should then likewise publickly and distinctly read the same Act to the people, as by the same Act may more at lage appear. We being most sensible of the great and wonderful mercies and deliverances vouch∣safed by Almighty God, mentioned in the said Act, and holding Our Self highly obliged, and being most willing that the just tribute of praise and thanksgiving to Our great Soveraign, the King of Heaven and Earth, be returned by Us and all Our People for the same, according to the intent of the said Act, do straightly command and enjoyn all Our loving Subjects, of what degrée, quality, or condi∣tion soever, solemnly and chearfully to conform themselves, and give obedience to the said Act of Parlia∣ment,
and to set apart and observe the Nine and twentieth day of this instant May, and so from time to time every Nine and twentieth day of May in every year, as a day of publick Praise and Thanksgiving to Almighty God for his said wonderful Mercies, Blessings, and Deliverances vouchsafed to Us and Our People, as in the said Act is mentioned. And to that end We command all Archbishops, Bishops, Parsons, Uicars, Ministers, and all other Ecclesiastical persons in their several Charges, according to their several duties, to take care thereof, and to cause this Our Proclamation to be yearly read in all Churches and Chappels the Lords day before the said day of publick Praise and Thanksgiving is to be observed and celebrated as aforesaid. And We strictly command all persons whatsoever, for the better observation of the said day, to abstain from all servile works and business on that day, and chearfully and orderly to repair to the publick place of Gods Divine Worship, for the due performance of the Duties of that day, according to the good intentions of the said Act. And We declare, That such persons as shall be faulty herein, shall be estéemed by Us, contemners and infringers of Our Laws and Commands, and as prophane persons, shutting their eyes against such evident manifestations of mercy and goodness vouchsafed by Almighty God to Us and to Our People. Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Twentieth day of May, in the Thirteenth year of Our Reign, 1661. GOD SAVE THE KING.
