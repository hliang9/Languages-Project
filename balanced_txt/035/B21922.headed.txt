A Declaration of the Lords and Commons in Parliament. Die Martis 30. Maii, 1643: THe Lords and Commons in Parliament, having ta∣ken into their serious con∣sideration a Proclamation dated at Oxford the nine∣teenth of this instant May, for the hol∣ding and continuing of the Court of Chancery, and all proceedings therein, the receipt of his Maiesties Exchequer, and of the first Fruits and Tenths, the Court of the Dutchy of Lancaster, Court of Wards and Liveries, and Court of Requests, at the City of Oxford, for the whole Terme of Trinity then next ensu∣ing,
upon and from the second day of Iune next comming, untill and upon the 21. day of Iune aforesaid: And for adiourning the Courts of Kings bench common Pleas and Exchequer, from the said second day of Iune untill the Re∣turne of Quindena Trinitatis next ensuing, doe finde that it will much tend to the preiudice of the common-wealth to have the said Courts and Receipts held and continued at Oxford, where great part of an Army raised against the Parliament and the authority thereof, now resides: And the said Lords and Commons ap∣prehending and foreseeing the great in∣conveniences and mischiefes that neces∣sarily must happen to many of his Ma∣iesties most faithfull and best subiects, in case those Courts and Receipts be held at Oxford, where such of them as have occasion to attend cannot with any safety of their persons or estates repair to his Maiesty, having in effect decla∣red all persons that have contributed any thing in ayde or defense of the Par∣liament,
and the priviledges thereof, to be guilty of high Treason, and in pur∣suance thereof, by the force and power of the Army there remaining, have sei∣zed upon many of their persons, where they are detained prisoners, and some proceeded against as Traytors, having nothing layd to their charge, but their assisting the Parliament, and opposing that Army raised to destroy it and the Kingdome. And finding that divers, both Iudges and others, (whose atten∣dance upon the said Courts and Re∣ceipts will be necessary) are members or assistants to one or both Houses of Par∣liament, whose presence at this time can∣not be spared; and that if the Records necessary to be used in the said Courts should be removed from the usuall pla∣ces to Oxford, in a time when two Ar∣mies are residing neare thereabouts, it would endanger the miscarriage of them, which might ruine many of his Maiesties subiects, whose estates de∣pend thereupon; and that so farre a di∣stance
between the said Courts of Law and Equity, which have necessary de∣pendance one upon another, would prove exceeding preiudiciall to many: and finding as great cause to take care for preventing the said mischiefes and in∣conveniences as was in Easter Terme last, in that the said Army is still conti∣nuing: The said Lords and Commons doe therefore declare and order, that no Iudge, Minister, or other person belon∣ing to any of the said Courts or Receipts shall repaire to the said City of Oxford, or doe or execute any thing belonging to the said Offices and Imployments, but in the places usuall of the doing and executing thereof: and the said Lords and Commons doe enioyne the said se∣verall Iudges Officers, and Mini∣sters, to attend the execution of the said Offices at the usuall times and places for the execution thereof, and not else∣where; and that no member of, or assi∣stant to either of the two Houses of Parliament, that have any place, Of∣fice,
or imployment, about any of the said Courts or Receipts, shall presume to depart from their attendance upon the Parliament▪ without the speciall leave of that House whereof they are members or assistants; and that those departed doe teturne forthwith. And doe further order, that no person shall remove or cause to be removed any re∣cords or writings of any the said Courts or Receipts, to or towards the said City of Oxford: And the said Lords and Com∣mons do declare, that if any person shall disobey this Order, they will proceed against them as wilfull contemners of the authority of Parliament, and distur∣bers of the peace of the Kingdome: and it is further Declared and Ordered by the said Lords and Commons, that no Iudgement, Decree, Order or Procee∣dings whatsoever, that shall be given, made, or had, by, or in, any of the said Courts or receipts, out of the usuall pla∣ces where the said Courts and receipts, have bin accustomed to be held and kept,
shall bind any person that may be con∣cerned therein, without his owne vo∣luntary consent: and that all Iudges, Officers, and other persons, shall be pro∣tected and kept indempnified, from any dammage or inconvenience that may, or can happen to them, for yeelding obe∣dience to this Ordinance, or by the not prosecution of any iust suit or action in the said Courts at Oxford, or any of them. FINIS.
