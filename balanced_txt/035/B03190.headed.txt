An Excellent New SONG, Intituled, Valiant Iockie His LADIES Resolution. To be sung to its own proper Tune. VAliant Jockie,s march'd away, To fight a Battle with great Mackay; Leaving me poor Soul alas! forlorne, To curse the hour that ever I was born But I swear I'll follow too, And dearest Jockie,s Fate pursue; Near him be, to guard his precious Life, Never Scot had such a Loyal Wife. Sword I'le wear, I'le cut my hair; Tane my Cheeks that was so fair; In Souldiers weed to him I'le speed, Never such a Trooper crost the Tweide. Trumpet sound rhe victory, Sure I'le be kil'd, the nixt Dundee; Loves raging Fate doth all agree, To do some glorious act for me: Great Bellonia take my part, Fame and honour guard my Heart; That for poor old Scotlands good, Some brave Action may deserve my blood Nought shall appear, from all Fame I fear, Fighting by his side I lov'd so dear; All the World shal own that ne're was known Such a Loyal Lass this Thousand year. Now in Noble Armour bright, I with coragious Heart will fight; Fear of death shall ne're my courage stain, Our King's Right I will maintain: For the glory of our Sex, We all our Rebells shall perplex, And let them find that Women kind, Sometimes venture with a warlike mind, Age of old, our Fame has told, Therefore I shall never be controul'd; By Friend, or Foe, I'le freely go; Never was a Trooper Armed so. I shall a helmet then put on, Armed like a valiant warlike Man; Plats of steel shall guard my Back and Breast, Carabines and Pistols I'le protest, In my Hand, I'le cock and prime, Now and for ever is the time; While I am mounted thus Cappa pi; Warlike Thunder shall my Musick be: Let smoak arise and dim the Skies, While we pursue the warlik prize; Lauralls shall us crown, with true renown, The Victory, in City, Court and Town. Mars the God of war shall lead Our Army, that shall fight and Bleed; Or e're our Foes shall hope to win the day Therefore let us march with speed away Hark, I hear the Ttumpets sound, We shall be all with Conquests Crown'd; Let all my Foes brag and boast, Victory and Triumph shall ride through the Host Glory and Fame shall then proclaim The Actions of a warlik valiant Dame; If Foes draw nigh, I'le scorn't to Fly, But with my dearest Love I'le live and dye.
