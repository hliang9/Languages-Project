A BITTE To stay the Stomacks OF GOOD SVBIECTS. OR A suddaine and short Vindi∣cation of the Scotts Commissioners PAPERS INTITVLED The Answer of the Commissioners of the Kingdome of SCOTLAND, &c. from the Imputations laid upon them, In the Declaration of the Lords and Commons As∣sembled in Parliament, concerning the Papers of the Scotts Commissioners, &c. Martij 13. By A. H. Scoto-Britan. Printed Anno Dom. 1647.
HIstory informes us. That when a dumbe Sonne of Craesus King of Lydia, saw one ready to stab his father, he conquered the naturall im∣pediments of speech, and distinctly cry'd out Kill not the King That which wrought this Wonder, was the power of naturall affecti∣on by the operation of an extraordinary Sympathy: surely those are justly chargeable, with a more then bruitish, (even in∣sensate) want of affection, and Sympathy who wil not now use, what Nature ordinarily affords unto all; (Speech,) to rescue the father of their Country the Kings Majesty, from the kil∣ling wounds ready to be given unto him: This duty puts the Pen into my hands; and without the Paint of Apology, makes me (in the absence of an intrusted, and my farre more able coun∣tryman) to shew unto you, how dangerously the States Em∣petiques practise upon the body politique of Great Brittaine, and make it as the (Evill one) their worke to propogate the sinne of their Rebellion: unto all others, especially unto my dear Countrimen, and these poysonous pills, are guilded With the pretence of undeceiving the people of both Kingdomes: This worke begets in them, and delivers them of, A declaration of the Lords and commons assembled in Parliament, concerning the Papers of the Scots Commissioners, entituled the Answer of the Commissioners, &c. And horrid impiety that what men themselves wilfully reject, they should envie unto others; Re∣pentance, The Scots through misprison of zeale (as Paul did Christ) have persecuted their Soveraigne, but now are divinely
converted, and will no longer engage with the Parliament in this sin, as they have published unto the world in their Answer, upon the New propositions of peace, and the foure Bills sent unto his Majesty, full of Honor, and Honesty, cleare from all the cavills of these desperate contrivers, and the ripe consul∣tations of Men, of singular Iudgement, and exemplary integri∣ty: who sincerely represented the sence of their Nation; and therefore, (although they are burthened with forgetfulnesse of the worke about which they came, with interpositions in things concerned them not, and deviation from the trust of the King∣dome of Scotland) they received as the Guerdon of true Patri∣ots, and experienced States-men, before their departure from this city, a publique Instrument of thankefull approbation, from almost all the Nobles of Scotland, for their good carriage and wise conduct of the affaires of that Kingdomes heere: So that wherein they quarrel the proceedings of the Commissio∣ners they might have been pleased, (but it made not for them to intend the Kingdome of Scotland. That which is first noted by them to disgust the Scots, was the alteration of the Propositions sent to Newcastle from those of Oxford, in the management of the Militia of the three King∣domes, the War, of Ireland, the education and marriage of the Kings children, &c. The concluding peace or war with forrain Princes &c: As though these were not principall interests of the Kingdome of Scotland, as well as of England, and was the pro∣secuting these interests in the Kingdome of England, the Offen∣sive exercise of an Interest in that Kingdome; It were much to be wished this distinction, had beene offered, before the Scots Army left England: Surely these alterations the Post nai tells us, leaves them worse then you found them, and takes from them their birth-right of equall capacity with your Sectes joyne with you in your Rebellion at first, with much of your own, [as the Devill unto our Saviour] you tendred more then was your owne, and now your worke is done, will you deny unto them, what is their owne in a word the sence of your Re∣solution,
never to grant them the exercize of interest in this kingdome, is to recede from the Articles of the Treaty between both Kingdomes;  to debarre them of all places and Offices of trust, and profit in this Kingdome, and to reserve them for your selves and your confiding creatures, which is a right, and interest of the Kingdome of Scotland, will be further claimed, and disputed with you: Yet the waving these interests for the time, by the Scots, could not but be acknowledged to proceed from transparent inclinations unto peace; but now, because by the progresse of your unlimited Vsurpations upon his Majesties royall Rights, (in which the Interests of the Scotts are especi∣ally included) being better informed, they differ in Iudgement from your Propositions; This causes your wonder. Are further results of Judgement, upon further and more cleare Information no wayes to be permitted? This were to obstruct all passages, unto humare certainty of knowledge, which is perfected by experience, (the Child of time:) But these men (because they will compleat their sinnes with Obstinacy) will admit of no variation from their first principles (to unthrone the King!) and now much wonder that the Scots will not arrive with them at that point of Impiety: Be∣cause the Scots cannot grant that his Majesty▪ & royal successi∣on, should be devested of the power of the Militia, and conferring Titles of Honour, (the Essentiall rights of Regality) for which they liberally affoard them solid Reasons; the Parliament re∣trive nothing to procure further satisfaction; but blow them of with, that they are the transcript of the Kings Arguments a∣bout HVLL: which amounts unto this; That what comes from the King (how consistent soever with Reason,) cannot be of force, or worthy the Answering: It is no marvell the Kings reasons are no higher rated by them, when that the word of God, can have but that Authority, and Acceptation with them, it hath with the Devill; but wherein they can force it unto a specious (though false) Consistency, with their owne ends, and Interests: And it cannot certainely, without astonishment, and
Horror, he observed, with what slighting, and indignation they mention his sacred Majesty throughout the whole Series of their Declaration, as though they were resolved to lay him al∣together aside, as some monstrouse or accursed thing: How do they abhorre from a Personall Treaty, so often pressed by the Commissioners, as the only expedient of a safe, and well grounded Peace betweene his Majesty, and his people; In order whereunto when the disbanding of the Army was propounded by them, how they discover a Tyranny awed with continuall feare, and only supported by the power of an Army: Had Sir Thomas Fairfax his Army beene disbanded, then indeed (say they) they might have brought the King to London, whether the Parliament would or no, and have brought the Parliament un∣to a Personall Treaty with him, and therein unto what tearmes, he and they pleased: This is the greatest crime they charge the Scotts Commissioners, with: A Personall Treaty at London is first in their thoughts, and discourse: The most secret, and greivous sinne doth not more abominate light, and manifestati∣on, then Treason the sight of Regall Majesty abused by it; The presence of the King at London might give him opportunity (say they) to caiole the Citizens; i. e. to cozen and cheat them as themselves have done:) Their diligence employes it selfe, (with Achan) to hide the Goulden wedge, and goodly things they espied in this City, to convey it into their owne stuffe, and makes the riches thereof serve unto their own ends, with which, It can no wayes stand, to admit King Charles unto Loudon: No the undeceived Citisens, would have too many represen∣tations, in his Majesties presence, of their sufferings, occasioned by his absence. A Treaty there, say they (and contrary unto their custome most truely,) would treat us out of what wee have fought for, (i. e. the Soveraigne Dominion,) draw the whole guilt of this effusion of blood, upon our selves, and tend unto the Apparent destruction of the Persons, (i. e. them∣selves) that have engaged: This Proposition of the Scots Com∣missioners, is too much for the Advantage of his Majesty, and
indeed too honest for this pack't partie, the present partie-co¦lourd Parliament, to yeeld unto: And therefore, whilst he is at this distance of affection with them, (they say not of Judge∣ment,) for what good man can close with them? His locall absence is Necessary: But nothing more startles this Crue, then that the Scots, should now varie from that, wherein they formerly concurred with them: Or what Reasons they have thought on since, which they Iudge more effectuall then those, (formerly.) I will assigne them some few, of many; Naturall af∣fection and Loyalty, quickned by the word of God and consci∣ence informed; Honor, their owne Interest, and the perfidie and Irreligion of this present Parliament, All which, by a joynt and respective Influence upon them, now, powerfully dispose them unto their duty of Subjection, and Christian Obedience, wherein they are obli∣ged unto their Dread Soveraigne. They were formerly decoyed into this Kingdome, under those winning pretences, of Reformation of Religion corrupted, and the preservation of the just liberties of the sub∣ject encroached upon, and fearing the Inconveniences which flow from these, might reach unto themselves, they willingly engaged in this war: but now [contrary unto their Hope] fin∣ding the successes of their Armes, to have beene the fruitfull parents, of infinitely more corruptions, in church and common wealth, and that the intentions of these Reformers, (what ever they pretended) never aymed at or were directed unto these good ends, but at the subversion of Monarchy, and placing a su∣preame power in themselves, and the driving on of particular ends and interests of their own; and an Arbitrary Government; to support which, as they tollerate all Religions, and even the most damnable Herees; So they do all illegall practises; and the most unwarrantable, and violent actions of those who ad∣here unto them. These things visible (unto all who have eyes) appearing unto
the Scots, they do now, [not without just resentment] reflect u∣pon themselves, and are resolved no more to partake with these men, in their sins, but to do their first workes, returne unto their first love, and as [the Tribe of Judah did by King David,] being bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, they will [by Gods assistance] industriously endeavour to bring their natural King unto his owne house; and that with honor, safety, and free∣dome; maugre the opposers. Nor will his Majesty be ever pressed by them to take the Co∣venant, having so often protested his aversenesse thereunto, there being more reason herein [what they upraid the Commis∣sioners with,] to take the measure of their desires, from what may please the King; then what they (with Ieroboam) doe, to establish their owne throne, and new erected dominion, to set up so many Calves and Idolls, such multitudes of reidiculous teachers, and abominable Sects, and Heresies: For what else is it to conive at and tollerate them, yea to countenance them: yet this sect [forsooth] must be convinced by the word of God, with Gentlenesse, and Reason, and not beaten out of it by force: Thus must Anabaptists be dealt withall, yea pleaded for also, and supplyed with a better argument then ever they could find for themselves, That It is onely a difference in the circumstance of time, in the Administration of an Ordinance It is admirable that Moses could not hit upon this distinction, unto the Angell who was ready to kill him for his deferring the circumcision of his sonne Eleazar equipollent unto baptisme. Independents, also under which Notion, Antinomians, Libertines, Brownists, Seperatists, Arminians, Familists, Erastians; Seekers, Shakers) all the rable of Heretikes shelter themselves, must have indulgence granted unto rhem, yea, and the chiefe places, of Honor, trust, and profit, in Church and common wealthe, conferred upon them; [how ever we are borne in hand with the settlement of the Presbyteriall Government,] and yet be∣cause the Comissioners would have the King complyed with
and the conviction of his Iudgement, and satisfaction, expected: This must be in them a Coznage: Nor will such as have ad∣hered unto his Majesty in the late Warre, be [through the Scots procurement,] pressed unto the Covenant, which hath bin truely made an Hooke only to draw the Kings partie into danger. A meere Cobweb to catch flyes in, the weakned Kings par∣tie, whilst the stronger Reptilia (bred in their owne intralls) can breake through it when they list: Surely an equall respect is due (nay a farre greater) unto those of the Kings Judgement, for the antiquity of their Reformation, and uniformity, then unto your Independents, and Sectaries, so that (what you will not extend,) Indulgence, to tollerate unto them, the use of the Common Prayer, will bee left unto his Majesty to give unto them: It being much more (in the apprehension of the Scots) tollerable, that Prelacy▪ (some excercise of which Government, they have seene in other Kingdomes embraceing the Reforma∣tion) should be restored, then instead thereof such thick weeds of Heresies as now daiely spring up in the Church, and are rea∣dy to choak the seed of Gods word▪ be permitted a full growth. And herein they say much lesse, then that great Patron of Inde∣pendencie Mr. Iohn Goodwin, the Bellweather of that Flock doth,Sion Coll. visited.  who tells us, That there was more of the power, and truth of Religion in England, under the late Prelaticall Government, then in all the reformed Churches besides which (they say not in others) in this Church is most true: But this Parliament likes not, (as not likely to Thrive by it) uniformity in Religion, being certainely (for the greater part of them,) of Kinne unto that English man, our Countrey man Barkely speaks of, who seperating from his Neigbours, first placed the true Church in his owne family,Icon Ani. and having severall Sonnes, these afterwards being different in Judgement, there became at length, so many Churches and Religions, as there were persons in the House, from which many of the Grandees at Westminster, are pro∣bably
extracted. And as unto that grand exception taken against the Commissioners, for propounding that an act of oblivion, without any caution or limitation, should be passed in both King∣domes, whereby Delinquents shall be set upon an even flowre, with those that have engaged against them in that Cause: The Scots conceive themselves obliged in the strictest points of honour, to advance what they possibly may, the good of those high Noble and Loyall spirits, which no obliquity of worldly respect, no distortion of danger or weight of suffrings, hath beene able to divorce from his Majesties service: And as they acknowledge it their great unhappinesse, that they have not had the Honour to be sharers with them hitherto in this Glory; So now it is their ambition, to have part and fellow∣ship with them in this most noble worke, and just underta∣king, of re-establishing his Sacred Majestie into his unquesti∣onable Rights; In pursuance whereof, (what the Parlia∣ment object unto the Scots Commissioners, that through all these and many former Papers they plead the Cause of the King and his Partie) They will hence forward, urge that Cause with the most powerfull and now onely Arguments, the Parlia∣ment of England can yeild unto, gnash they never so much with their teeth; Such favorites are Delinquents now growne with them, as by their Reception at Edenburgh they may guesse. Nor can lesse be expected from the Scots, as on whom the Parliament of England, hath so notoriously imposed, as to have his Majestie left unto them, by them, upon such tearmes and assurances of high regard unto his Majesties Person and Royall Rights: The contrary whereof, in every point they have unto their eternall infamy) performed;  which assu∣rances though they evade and deny them, shall be justified un∣to the world, by the publication of the transactions, betweene the Commissioners of both Nations at New-castle, and also by the Overtures ever sithence: His Majesties Person and Royall Rights, being of equall concernment unto the Scots with the English, although the Parliament of England call these [exclusively] their owne rights—for which they hold it not fit to capitulate: And for this abuse of brotherly
confidence in the Houses, the Scots doubt not, in Gods mer∣cy to bring them unto such an account, as shall leave the whole reckoning of His Majesties unparalel'd sufferings upon themselves, who now seeme to have no way of Iustification left, but by further progresse in crimes: So that it is not to be marveiled at, they seeme so much to undervalue His Ma∣jesties Regall Power, of conferring titles of Honour, and la∣bour to render the Scots ridiculous, for that they are so ex∣treame thirsty, to drinke of the Fountaine of Honour, so they stile the King, say they, because indeed the Parliament of England (as to the over-ruling partie thereof, many being led aside by their fraud, and violence) have left off to be ho∣nest, Honour being but the proper seat, and stall of honestie: Neither can it be presumed that they desire to taste of this fountaine, when they make it their worke, to damme and fill it up with the rubbish of their new Government, and yet un∣shapen Tyranny, wholy trampling under their feet, all the Divine and Glorious prerogatives, and Royall Priviledges of Monarchy exercised in all ages by the Kings of England and Scotland (The Sunne in his greatest splendor, is not more manifest then this) By their endeavour to take away His Majesties Prerogative in the settlement of Religion, His Legislative power, the Negative voyce, the Militia, the dis∣posing of Offices, conferring of Honours, the disposing of his Children, the election of his Servants, with many other rights that append unto these; In which transcendent usurpations upon their owne borne King, should the Scots concurre, they should most justly render themselves the shame of all Nations, and the off-scouring of the world: The perfidie of the leading partie in the present Parliament, hath already gi∣ven too great a staine unto their Honour (by their dealing with His Majestie) which they will sooner wash off with pro∣digall streames of the dearest and best blood of Scotland, then they will suffer to remaine or rest longer upon them; And whereas they lay an heavy load upon the Commissioners of unthankfulnesse unto their Armie, who shewed such tender fel∣low-fling of their sufferings and their true-heartednesse towards them▪ The Armie might well pay them with words, for thy
many blowes they received, and with which they discharged their scores in Scotland, and saved their heads (with the losse of many thausand of their owne lives) in England; They no wayes being able to have matched, much lesse to have ma∣stred His Majesties party without their conjuncture; No English man all this while loosing one drop of blood for the Cause in Scotland; and as the Scots have very dearely earned their whole pay (had it beene more, and more truly paid) with the vast expence of their blood, the impoverishment of their County, and a bloody engagement against their owne bowells, so hath it cost them most, by incurring the forrain censure of disloyalty; Into which the Hypocrisie, and Ava∣rice of the Parliament of England principally led them, and to discharge themselves of this burthen, now become intolle∣rable, and to shew unto the world, that the present practises of the Parliament of England were not the motives of their advance into the Kingdome; they resolve (with Gods leave) to manifest the contrary, and speedily to come nearer unto them, to debateface to face the Royall Rights of His Majesty, and their joynt interests so eluded by them, with such demon∣strations (as by Gods helpe) will be of force manifestly to prove by their power, what by their Commissioners they have propounded in their Papers. Reader, take this for the first light skirmish of a reply unto the Declaration, untill the maine battell of more manifest De∣monstrations, for the truth of what is here set forth in the behalfe of the Answer of the Scots Commissioners, can be drawne up and rallied. FINIS.
