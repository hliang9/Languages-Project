To the Reverend Dr. Thomas Ken. Feb. 1. New Stile, 1680. SIR, IN or about October last, Mr. Oats represented Me to the King and Council for a Papist; Prance swore, that he saw me several times at Masse at Somerset-House, about two years before; But swore withall, that he never see me receive the Sacrament: I was Summoned, Heard, and Acquitted. Since that time, Some People (as I am inform'd) have Sworn, that they have seen me Receive too; wherein I think my self bound in Conscience and Common Prudence to clear my Self. Sir, By the Grace of God I purpose to Receive the Blessed Sacrament from your Hand, to morrow; May it be Life or Death to me as I speak true or false; May it be to me what the Sop was to Iudas, if either I am, or ever was, or ever pre∣tended to be of the Communion of the Church of Rome. I never Received the Sacrament from a Romish Priest in my Life; I never was under the Roof of a Popish Chappel in England, since the King was Restor'd in 1660. I have no Reserve, but intend by this Letter, as I desire you may un∣derstand it. Sir, I am with infinite Reverence for your Function and Esteem for your Friendship and Person, Your most affectionate humble Servant, Roger L'Estrange. L'Estrange Received the Sacrament accordingly, Sir Ga∣briel Sylvius, Mr. Plot, Mr. Sidney's Secretary, Mr. Bla∣grave Chaplain to the Princess, Received at the same time.
