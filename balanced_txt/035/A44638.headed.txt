A FEW Plain Words OF INSTRUCTION Given forth as moved of the Lord, for all people, whose minds and hearts are inclina∣ble after the way of peace and rest with the Lord, which the Leaders of the people in this age have caused them to erre from, and have forgotten their resting place. With a true Testimony for the Lord and his pow∣er which gathereth out of the World, and a∣gainst all gathered, and not by the true Jesus the Saviour of the soul, Gods Salvation, and Rock of Ages from everlasting to everlasting. And a Testimony against all blind guides, and foolish buil∣ders which would make the word of God (the word of faith in the heart and in the mouth) of no effect, by their own Imaginations, and so bringeth forth the Hypocrites hope, and so leaveth and people in Egypt and Sodom where they found them, where our Lord was and is crucified. And this is a true Testimony in righteousness, born unto all the World for the Truths sake (which is better then life it self) by him who is known to many by name. Luke Howard. LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons, at the Bull and Mouth neer Aldersgate, 1658.
ON the eleventh day of the third Moneth, 1658. as I stood at my labour in my outward calling, with my mind staid on the Lord, and my thoughts exercised in his Law which is light, the state and condition of the deceived, and the deceiving Preachers of these times, came into my mind, and their unrighte∣ousness was laid before me, (as it had been many a time before) by which the people have been and are deceived, and perisheth for want of knowledge, so I was moved of Lord in the clear spirit of truth, to propound these que∣ries for the seed sake, which is kept in bondage in all peo∣ple, which are led by such blind guides, to the making manifest some part of their unclean spirit, which ruleth in them, and in all people which are lead by them; which liveth out of the Truth, the which truth maketh free all which liveth in it; and therefore is their anger kindled against all which are made free by it, be∣cause they are in bondage to the spirit of this world, and so have a life in another thing then in the truth of the Lord God who made the World and all things therein, which dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, nei∣ther is he worshipped by mens hands, seeing he giveth life and breath unto all, for that end alone, that all should live unto him, and praise his great and glorious Name, which is known over all, as all stand in the Covenant of life and light with him in which they were created; And seeing that this God is very much professed, and little known, and lesse worshiped in the spirit and in the truth, although there be so many worshippers of him in words of all sorts, they all worshipping they know not what, being out of the Covenant wherein they were created, even of the light wherein the true knowledge and worship of God standeth; and therefore as one which hath obtained mercy, and by it brought into Covenant again, do I propound these Queries in love unto all to consider of, and let the witnesse of God in all consciences answer.
Quere. 1. WHether God be not all light, and in him is no darkness at all? And whe∣ther this were not and be not the message which the Saints and Ministers of Christ were and are now to preach according to the Scriptures? Quere 2. Whether Jesus Christ be not the light of the World, and hath not enlightened every one which cometh into the World? And whether all which be∣lieveth in his light shall not come out of darkness, and feel and witness the light of light according to the Scri∣ptures? Quere 3. Whether God and Christ in the light be not one according to the Scriptures? And although many may, and do say so, because it is left on Record by the spirit of Truth which dwelt in the Children of light, yet whether any can come unto the true know∣ledge of it, but by the mistery of faith held in a pure concience? And whether all men be not without that faith by nature, and whether any can come unto that faith until they believe in the light which shineth in the heart, to give the light of the knowledge of the glo∣ry of God in the face of Jesus Christ, which is eternal life, as it is abided in, according to the Scripture? Quere 4. Whether Christ Jesus, the Covenant of Light, doth not proceed from the Father and God of Light as a free gift of grace unto man, shining in his heart to make manifest with the Spirit of Truth the thoughts and intents of the heart, for to keep man from the committing of actions which are evil, which are first committed in the thoughts of the heart where the alie∣nation stands? And whether this be not the condem∣nation of all which are condemned, that they turn from the Covenant of God, and do not set to their seales by believing in it the Covenant of light? And whether this the Covenant of light be not the way of God for all to meet him in, and to work righteousness in, by casting off the workes and deeds of darknesse,
which by the light in the heart are made manifest? And whether all which doth joyn unto the light by believing in it, doth not joyne unto God in Christ Jesus in the new Covenant which God maketh with his people, which is written in the heart, and put into the inward parts, wherein the light shineth according to the Scripture? Quere 5 And whether all unrighteousnesse be not sin, and whether he which committeth sin be not of the Devil? and whether he which loveth so to do be not brought forth into the image of the Devil? and whether any which will not cast off what by the light is made manifest to be evil, doth not love their sins, and hate the light, and so joyning unto the evil, shut themselves out of Covenant with God in the light, and so remain∣eth in the Covenant of death and darknesse, and so un∣der the bond of iniquity? And whether any which there∣in stand be fit to preach unto others the way of God, which is life and light, and if any do presume to use their tongues to preach to others in that state, then whe∣ther all such be not hypocrites and vain talkers, intru∣ding into such things as they never saw from the Lord in the Covenant of light, but have learned it by nature and tradition, and so are vainly puft up in their fleshly mindes? and whether they are not those who shall ne∣ver profit the people at all, they having gotten as it were a form of Godlinesse, but denying the power there∣of (which standeth in the Covenant of light?) and whe∣ther all people which have been followers of such be not to turn away from them and to turn to Christ Jesus, Gods Covenant of light, which he hath freely given as a free gift of grace unto all men that will receive him to be their teacher, and to learn of him alone according to the Scripture? Quere 6. And whether all which love and live in sin and unrighteousnesse, and yet will presume to preach the words of righteousnesse recorded in the Scripture of truth, be not such as steal the words now, as the false Prophets did whom the Lord was against? And whether
the Lord be not against them now as ever he was? and whether they be not such as run when the Lord never sent them, and so shall never profit the people at all, no more then they did? And whether all such Preachers may not as well be known now, as in the days past, by their fruits? for can we gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles now any more than they could then? and may we not know them now by their fruits as they did then, which preacht for filthy lucres sake, and through feigned words and covetous practises makes merchandise of the people, every one looking for his gain from his quarter, that so he may feed himself with the fat, and cloath himself with the wool? but he starveth the flock; and if any for conscience sake cannot put into their mouths, they even prepare war against them now as they did then; and of this sort are all such preachers as rebell against the light, as the prophets Testimony of them is? And are we any more to uphold them now then the chil∣dren of light were then? or are we not to bear our publick Testimony against them now as they did then, according to the whole current of Scripture? Quere 7. Whether all which liveth in the practise of that horrible and filthy thing which was committed in the Land of Israel as it is now in the land of England, to the far exceeding of them, as the Priest preaching for hire, and the Prophets prophecying for money (and the peoples loving to have it so) be not as much now to be witnessed against, as it was then? And whether it be not as great an evil, and as much to be taken notice of by our God now as it was then, for his Witnesses to be evilly entreated now as they were then, to the great shame of the name of a Christian, who hath stole the name, and lost the nature, and so bringeth forth contrary fruit, even such as the Lord will repay with vengeance, accord∣ing to the words of his Son Jesus Christ the same yester∣day as to day and for ever, the Rock of Ages, and foun∣dation of all truth, according to the Scripture? Quere 8. And whether all which live in sin and love
so to do, which can run from Town to Town, and from Parish to Parish, and from Ship to Ship for gifts and re∣wards, and so preach as to get the peoples money by flat∣tery, and daubing of them up with untempered morter, in telling them they are that which the witnesse of God in their consciences telleth them they are not, and if they cannot so have the wages of unrighteousnesse (the peoples money) then they will take it by the force of a carnal pretended Law, which is without all grounds for it, but any way to have it will serve their turn? Whe∣ther all such be not Rebels against the power of the Lord Jesus, and against the Covenant of God, wherein the sure mercies of David are injoyed, and the glory of Israel is witnessed, even the free covenant of light, in which the true Prophets did and doth stand, which as a light unto the feet, and a lanthorn unto the pathes it compas∣seth the minds of all the Children of light, and so guideth them out from under the teachings of all such evil-min∣ded men and seducers, for they wax worse and worse through covetousnesse, so the one he buildeth up a wall, and the other he daubeth it with untempered mor∣ter, and so they keep up that alive which should be put to death, and put to death that which should be kept a∣live, and as the false Prophets ever did, whose damna∣tion slumbereth not according to the Scripture? Quere 9. Whether all which live in sin, and love so to do, and yet will presume to use their tongues to preach to others from the words of the Scriptures of truth, be not now as great theeves as the false Prophets of old were, who stole the true Prophets words, and said, Thus saith the Lord, when the Lord never spoke unto them, and though they spoke true words, yet they could not profit the people, because they stole them, and did not speak from the spirit of truth, the life of righteous∣nesse made manifest in them, and so although they did swear the Lord liveth, which was true words, yet they swore falsely, and how can that spirit now speak Truth, which could the speak nothing but false∣hood,
hood, although they did speak true words, for now for a man which liveth in sin, and loveth it, for him to preach to another of the true Ministers lives recorded in the Scriptures, because they lived according to their words, which are true words, that doth not make him righteous, neither doth his words reach to the witnesse of God which is righteous in every mans conscience which heareth him, and so none are able to learn righ∣teousnesse by him, because that spirit is head in him, and speaketh the words which hath a life in sin and un∣righteousnesse, as covetousnesse, pride, and what not? for from one root doth all sin proceed, and so the blind leadeth the blinde, and all must needs fall into the ditch, according to the Scripture? Quere 10 And so whether that which is given unto every man to profit withall, and to lead man out of sin up to God, be not by them murdered, and that which the Devil hath begotten in man, which is the seed of the Serpent, whose life is in sin (and therefore wil plead for it) be not by them nourished and kept alive, and this is just contrary the one unto the other, and unto the promises of God unto man, that the seed of the woman shall break the head of the Serpent, and this was and is all that ever the righteous Ministers of God ever travelled and laboured for, to bring forth the seed of the Woman, whose name is called the Word of God, to rule in the heart, by which the creature was and is made able to do the will of God; and here was and is the blessing of the promises felt as this birth is felt, but the Devil who was the murderer from the beginning of this birth, and abode not in the truth which is the light, and in all which are from the Covenant of light doth he rule, and labour to carry on his old work to keep people from believing in the light, the Covenant of God, wherein the ability standeth, and is received to destroy and overcome the power of hell and death which is his Kingdom, so can all the Children of light truly
say, greater is he which is in us, then he which is in the World, according to the Scripture? And thus have I in love unto the seed of God in all propounded these few Queries, to the opening of the opening of the understanding of all, which have not fully made shipwrack of faith and a good conscience, but feeleth something yet left which hungereth and thirst∣eth after righteousnesse, and unto it it the blessing is, which will not be, nor cannot be satisfied with the talk of the thing, but must have the thing it self, which is the substance, or else it dieth, which all which are co∣vered with the shadow of, are willing to set to their shoulders by words and actions to persecute, but if in a blind zeal they kill the body, and think they do God good service in so doing, that will not excuse them, but they fulfill the Scripture to their own destruction, for the servant is not greater then his Master, and our re∣ward is with Him, in whom I rest, in my measure, a friend unto all, and known unto the Lord in it and to the sons of men, by my name, as to man, Luke Howard. AND now a few words unto all you which call your selves Churches gathered out of the World, I mat∣ter not your names of distinction, for that cover will not not hide you, the nature and ground being stand∣ing which is all one, and with the light of Christ Jesus you are seen and made manifest, and unto the measure of the same light in you all (in whom it is not yet put out) I speak and write these lines for you to consider of, Whether you be gathered out of the World, yea or nay? or by what spirit or power you are gathered together? for this know, that it is not sufficient for you to gather in a heap together, and call your selves by the name of
the Church of Christ, and yet the fruits of the Sprit of Christ not to be found among you, but that ground standing which bringeth forth briers and thorns, both in you and your Leaders, and all such fruit is but for the fire and the wrath of the Lord, and therefore for you to pretend to practise such things, as the Saints in the dayes past did practise, by the leadings of the spirit of life which dwelt in them, and so left them on record for the learning of all which are lead by the same spirit which can read them and understand them, according as they live in the fulfilling of them, for they were the Sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and as many as are led the same Spirit of God they are the Sons of God now and none else, and therefore consider whether the pure Spirit of the Lord have led you to gather together, or your own spirits, the which yet hath fellow∣ship with the World, and can joyn thereto, and love the things thereof, and this is a true Testimony that the love of the Father is not in such, neither are they called out of the World. It is true, there was a cry once in the hearts of many of you after righteousnesse, and there was in your hearts and mindes an inclining to satisfie it, and that which cried after righteousnesse was the righteous spirit and seed of God, and the manifestation of it was given un∣to you for to profit withall, which cry was against un∣righteousnesse, for to have been separated indeed from under the burthen of it, which did oppresse it as a Cart is oppressed with sheaves, that so it might have enjoyed its freedom, with the Lord in righteousnesse which is its life; but now consider whether you have profited in this, which was given unto you to profit withall, or whether you have not profited and increased in your own spirit, and so have this murdered, and by your self-separation are grown harder and harder in sin and iniquity, and so through the strength and subtilty thereof have learn∣ed how to live in it and to cover it over, and to plead for it, but wo be to him which covereth his sin and hi∣deth
his transgression, for he shall not prosper, for the hand of the Lord will search out the hidden things of Esau; for now consider this in the fear of the Lord, that that which in the dayes past bore witnesse against sin, and cryed after righteousnesse hath not now changed its nature to become willing to live in sin, although its voyce may not be so much heard as in the dayes past, because the earth is grown thicker over it then it was, yet that which was humble in you and then called for humility and wrought some tendernesse in you is the same still as its hearkened unto, and is not now be∣come proud, but beareth witnesse against it still as its suffered to speak in you, and that which was righteous and wrought in you some tendernes in the days past, and cryed after righteousnes that it might have had a free life from under the bond of iniquitie, hath not now chan∣ged his nature to become unrighteous to live in cove∣tousnesse and pride, and according to the course of this world, to serve the times as oft as they do change, and to seek the honour and glory and profit of this world and to joyn thereto, but that spirit which can do these things is that which hath murdered this just one and slain the Lamb of God, now as ever it hath done, from the foundation of the world, and here read your selves all you time-serving Professors; And there∣fore as you prize your eternal peace consider of your latter end before it be too late when time shall be no more, for then such fruits will be bitter unto you, there∣fore whilst you have time prize it and answer the requir∣ings of the spirit of the Lord by obeying of it, and re∣bel not against it when these things are made manifest by it, and sell not your birth-right therein for vain and unprofitable things which in the day of the Lord you will be ashamed of. For this honestly consider of, whether a foolish cu∣stom of words or practises in action or fashions of apparel which riseth out of the carnal heart, be not vain and unprofitable, although the heart may be so much drawn
into the thing, that the eye can scarce see or look, or the ear hear, but the spirit lusteth after all it seeth or heareth and whether the living therein be not rebelling against the light, which sometimes checketh in secret for them, and whether Rebellion against that that checketh, be not as the sin of witch-craft, which maketh the heart harder and harder, and so much the harder, because you are covered with a profession of the Saints life, which you are out of, and so are in the liberty of the flesh; but wo be to him that covereth his sin, for he shall not prosper; therefore to the light which maketh all things in the heart manifest incline your ear, and hear, that your soules may live, and to it bow, and in it wait, that you may be compassed about therewith, and feel the righteous power of life which in it is made manifest, the tongue to bridle, and the whole man to govern, or else your profession is all in vain, and it is cursed, as is your pride and all unrighteousnesse; for now for a proud and covetous man in his proud and covetous mind to professe Religion, that doth not make him righ∣teous, nor change his heart, nor yet his looking into the Scriptures of Truth, and with that Spirit which leadeth out the mind to pride and covetousnesse; read them over, and imagine and think how the Saints in dayes past were separated from the World, and so catch∣eth up something in his carnal mind, which causeth him to get into some heap of people or other called a Church, and so remaineth still ignorant of that which changeth the heart; for that which changeth the heart, separa∣ted them from the World, and gathered them out of it, and caused them to bear a righteous Testimony against the World and is the condemnation of all which believ∣eth not in it, and the salvation of all which believeth in it, and profiteth by it, and answereth its requirings by obeying of it, and casting off every weight and bur∣then which doth so easily beset it, that it may arise, which will be made able through the power of him that rear∣eth
it to run with patience the race of righteousness set before it, which race cannot be seen, nor what is to be be cast off known, but as the mind is stayed in the light which maketh all things manifest that is reproveable by it. And therefore all you which love and serveth the unjust power which leadeth the heart and mind to sin, and keeps the just under suffering, under the power of iniquity, in captivity, to your lust, to you — I say, it seemeth but a small thing to you to blaspheme the light of Christ which shineth in the heart, and maketh all things manifest, which opposeth the seed of God, this you can call natural light, or natural conscience, as of∣ten as you please, as the dark power moveth in your minds, because your tongues are your own, but such names the Scriptures never called it by; so your blas∣phemy will rest upon to bear when the light must be your con∣demner and judge; but this I know, if you did not love your evil deeds, and hate the light as the Scripture saith, I am sure you would not so call it, neither could you so blaspheme it. For now consider this, that spi∣ritual wickednesse in the heart which maketh desolate the soul, & standeth where it ought not to stand, cannot be made manifest by a natural light, but that must of necessity be spiritual which maketh manifest spiritual wickednesse, and leadeth out of it, and this is the whole work of the power of darknesse to keep peoples hearts from believing in the light, and to place a prejudice in the mind against it, least it should make him manifest, and the ground in which his power standeth, and so his Kingdom should come to be destroyed, which will be as the light is believed in; and this Testimony I bear for the Lord unto his light against all the blasphemers of it, in the whole world. And therefore all you which are got into heaps, and call your selves the Church of Christ, and yet can plead against the light of Christ, which leadeth into the
Church of God, which is in Christ Jesus, the Rock of Ages, as he is the light of the World. Do not you manifest your selves to be gathered and separated onely in words, and by a wrong Spirit, and so by your fruits declare your selves but to be the Syna∣gogue of Satan, begotten by the prince of pride, and father of lies, who hath taught you to blaspheme, to call your selves Saints in saying you are separated from the World, and yet differ in your practise nothing from the World? except it be to exceed them in wickednesse; for to live in sin, and to be able to plead for it, the which many of them are ashamed to do, and so the Publican and Harlot may enter into the kingdom of God before yee. So upon a true search and weigh∣ing of you in the true ballance, and measuring of you by a just measure, I cannot finde you to be but the worst of men, and the greatest enemies to the Crosse of Jesus which are this day living, and not wrong you at all; And this Testimony I must needs give of the greatest part of you that ever I met with, that it is the greatest work you find to do, to plead for sin, and for to live in it as long as you live in the body, so you shew what Lord you serve, and whom you are willing to serve as long as you can serve him, and yet you say you hope to be glorified with the Saints in light, and to have an in∣heritance among them which are sanctified: Is not this the hope of the Hypocrite, and will it not pe∣rish? for where will you be sanctified? Not by im∣puted righteousnesse (as you call it) in your dark minds whilest you live in sin, and sinning against the light and power of him who is the true light and power to destroy and take away sin and the ground of it: And therefore this consider, how you will by your principles escape holding of a Purgatory when you are dead, let the wise in heart which live by faith judge; so of the worst of men in practise, and
one with the Papist in judgement I find you to be, and yet do you no wrong at all in so saying of you, neither do I write this to upbraid you, God is my wit∣nesse, but to make manifest your ignorance to the view of your understanding, that you may see you are not separated as you say you are from the World, but as the father of lies hath deceived your hearts, and so made you a perfect Synagogue for himself to dwell in and among; whilst he ruleth in the heart and guideth your tongues to plead against the perfect light of Christ Jesus, the true Saviour of the soul from sinne, and calleth it naturall, and so undervalueth it as a thing too low for you to walk by, and as if you had a higher light to walk by, when thousands can witnesse to the glory of the Lord and the praise of his grace, that the light which you call natural and low leadeth out of sin and gi∣veth victory over it, whereas that which you call a higher light and spiritual, you are forced to confess doth not so lead you out of sin, but that it leaveth a root for you to plead for and to remain un-cut up as long as you live; And whether yours be the Lords Axe which cuts up the corrupt tree by the root, let the pure witnesse of God in your consciences answer? And so whether that which you call spirital and high, or that which you call natural and low, be the true light of the Lord, which he hath given to be salva∣tion to the ends of the earth, let the Children of light judge, which by the Word of life which they have seen, tasted and handled of can judge righteous judgement? and so say in truth, greater is he which is in us, then he which is in the World, to the ful∣filling of the Scripture, which saith, The strong man armed keepeth the house untill the stronger then he comes which all the pleaders for sin are yet ignorant of, so are to be silent, and to the name of Jesus to bow, and in the light to wait, until they feel the
working of that power in them wch bindeth the strong man and spoileth his goods, and this is the power of God which saveth from sin, and so leadeth the mind and heart by its power to plead against all sin, and to plead for everlasting righteousnesse, and in it to dwell by believing in the light. And thus I have born my Testimony unto the light of the Lord, against the darknesse of the World, and to the righteousnesse of God, against the unrighteous∣nesse of the World, and all that plead for it, whether they he gathered together, and call themselves (though falsly) the Church of Christ, or not gathered together, for in the light they are seen to be all one, as well now as in the dayes past, who have stole the name but have lost the nature, and so are dead whilst they live. Luke Howard. AND now all my dear brethren which are re∣deemed from under the Idol shepherds, and gathered out of the false wayes and worships, (which are many in the World) which are dear and near unto me in the Lord, who hath visited us with the day-spring, or the springing of the day from on high, and by his eternal power in the word of life hath visited his own plant in us all, to the raising up of the Prisoner of hope, which can both patiently wait and hope for the Salvation of God. I say unto you all, dear friends, in the bowels of everlasting love and ten∣dernesse, and as you tender the glory of our God and your own eternal peace, dwell low in the fear of God, and keep unto that in and by which you have been vi∣sited, and forget it not by any means, but keep to it
that you may all be sensible in the feeling of a living principle of God, born up in your understanding, for to keep your minds alwayes staied on the Lord in the watch that the enemy enter not, so will you find the seed to grow and the Prisoner of hope to be brought forth, which comes to do the will of him that hath it begotten, and visited, and by the right hand of his power hath it brought forth, which cannot live out of the presence of that God of power and life which begot it and brought it forth, and this is the way of Gods salvation, wherein it is revealed to all that wait for it. And here all people and professors of all sorts come and try your hope, If it be not the hope of Gods elect it will not stand you in stead in the day of the Lord, when he appeareth to give to every man according to his faith, but will prove you to be but the hope of the Hypocrite and that will perish eternally, And therefore whilest you have time prize it and consi∣der from which seed your hope riseth, for that seed which can live out of the presence of God is not Gods elected one, but is that which is cursed eternally, and if that professe and hope, it hopes in vain, for it is re∣probated concerning the faith of Gods elect, and is cast out of Abrahams house, or the habitation of the faith∣ful for ever, for it is that which gendereth to bondage, and so to death, and endeth therein, and to the liberty or freedom of the seed of God it is a stranger, for now consider this that seed or spirit which can live in pride cannot live in humility, and that which can live in un∣righteousnes cannot live in righteousnesse, and that which can live in the service of the Devil cannot live in the service of God, and therefore all you which can live in sin and unrighteousnesse, in death and darkness and plead for it, and yet say you hope for salvation with the Lord, whose nature and being is in righteousnesse and purity, in the immortal light and glory, (for righte∣ousnesse is the girdle of his Loyns.) Are you not decei∣ved by the deceiver and father of lies? who will let you
be Hypocrites and let you leap into a profession and steal the name of Saints, and of being called out of the World so that he may keep his seed alive in you, which cannot live but in transgression, and therefore will plead against perfect freedom, for by this the Devil knowes that if he can but get men to love sinne and transgression, and to joyn thereto, as to covetousnesse, and pride and wan∣tonesse, and seeking honour one of another, or any un∣righteousnes for to serve him in, and yet make a profes∣sion too; then such a man is fit to make a Teacher and a Ruler in his Kingdom of darknesse, and to plead for it against the light, that so his work to murder the seed of God which is begotten in the light may go the more stronger on in the mysterie of iniquity, for if the ser∣pents seed in Cain which can imbrace this present World, should offer a Sacrifice, is it not from that ground which is cursed, and is it not an abomination to the Lord as his murder is? For if that seed or nature offer a sacrifice, or if it slay a man, is it not all one as to the Lord? yea assuredly, although by its sacrificing and profession it would seek to cover its sin and the ground from whence it proceedeth wherein its life lyeth which is nourished and kept alive by the dust threof, which is all cursed for its sake, he that readeth let him under∣stand. And therefore all people upon the face of the earth unto whom these lines may come, this is that I have to say unto you all in love unto the seed of God in you all, the Lord is my witnesse I lie not I say this unto you all, If you will have eternal peace with your Maker, bow down to that which may be known of God the light of Jesus Christ which is eternal, which is made manifest in you, and is daily shewen unto you, which light is the grace of God which appeareth unto you, and checketh you in secret when no eye seeth you, and discoverteh the thoughts and intents of your hearts unto you before they are brought forth into evil actions, the which if you re∣ceive
it, I am a witnesse for the Lord in this the day of his power, that it will teach you to deny all ungodlinesse, or that which is not like God which it reproves, and brings you into the image of God, or likenesse, which is righteousnesse and true holinesse which it justifies, but if you rebell against it, assuredly it will eternally condemn you from his presence, although you may say in your hearts you hope it will not, for now the grace of God is the light of Christ Jesus which sheweth to man sin and unrighteousnesse, for this end that all might be led out of it and to bring in everstaing righteousnesse, that the spirit thereof might rule and have the government upon his shoulders alone, whose habitation is onely in the light, and therefore if that spirit work in the mind and rule in the heart whose life is in darknesse and out of the bounds of the heart, bringing forth the deeds of dark∣nesse, and yet say, you have hope in God which is light and in him is no darknesse at all; is not this the hope of the Hypocrite to think you may live in Dives his nature all your life time, and yet have Lazarus his possession, when you can no longer live therein? For this consider wherefore you were created, but to glorifie your Crea∣tor in your spirits, and in and with your bodies which is but your reasonable service, and to live unto God in all things, and not unto your selves, and therefore be still and consider and let the witnesse of God in all concien∣ces answer before it be too late and there be no remedy, And if you sow to the flesh, how can you think you can reap the fruits of the spirit? and if you sow to your lust, how can you think you shall reap the fruits of chastity? and if you sow to the spirit of pride, can you hope to reap the fruits of humility? and if you sow to the spirit of this world, whose life is in the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, and covetousnesse, and all things which are not of God, and how can you say or think it possible you should reap the fruits of the Spirit of God by which he calleth and all the day long stretcheth
out his hand by it? that so he might have the heart, it to guide and rule to the bringing forth fruit to him and not to your selves, for herein is our heavenly Father glo∣rified when fruit to his spirit is brought forth, and all herein rare approved of with the Lord, and all such con∣demned already which believeth not in him which giveth the victory over the spirit of this World, which spirit cannot live if it be not fed with the fruit thereof, and therefore consider he which liveth in pleasure is dead whilst he lives, and he which liveth wantonly on the earth crucifieth the just, and he which is covetous is an Idola∣tour, and all such are shut out of the Kingdom of God, which the Spirit of Jesus the true light leadeth unto, and are amongst the dogs and swine in the devouring nature ready to quarrel both in words and actions, about the words and things of God, which are not theirs; and here may all Hypocrites read their portion, who can make a profession and plead for it, and with the same mind, and by the same spirit plead and quarrel against the Saints, and against the perfect righteousness of God to be in∣joyed in this life, and so opposeth the command of God, and the gift of God, and the work of God by Jesus Christ, which is to purchase unto himself a Church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, and so maketh as much as in them lies the Word of God of none effect by their own imaginations, which word is near in the heart, and in the mouth, and as it is believed in, it is ingrafted in the heart, and it is able to save the soul from sin and that is its effect to all which believe in it; for the Word of God is the life of God, and the life of God is the light of men, and the light of men is Jesus, the Saviour of all which be∣lieve in him, and his Name is called the Word of God, the entrance whereof giveth life, and he hath so appeared in this the day of his power, to be the word of life from the dead, a quickning spirit to many faithfull and true Witnesses of his resurrection and his life, even him who was dead and is a live, and behold he liveth for ever more
everlasting praises be unto him, and glory for ever and he will so appear unto all which wait for him, and ask the way to Zion with their faces thither-ward, and backs set to Aegypts Land never there to return again, but now here is a great talk at this day of Zion and the way there, and some presume to be Leaders to her, and builders of her waste places again, which the wild bore of the forest hath layed waste, but where among them all are they to be found, whose faces are set to Zion, and their backs to Aegypt, for the chief corner stone hath been and is neg∣lected by them all, even that on which all the building should stand, Christ Jesus the light of the World and Rock of Ages; and so although they have and may talk of the way to Zion, and of building up of her walls, yet their faces have been and now are much more then in the days past set to Aegypts land of darknesse and bondage wherein our Lord was and is Crucified; for now consider honestly this thing, whilst a man asketh the way to Zion that is to say, the place of Gods habitation, which the Lord hath chosen for his rest, and yet his face set to Egypt that is to say the place of the Devils habitation, with his mind and heart in pride and covetousnesse, or after any thing which is not of God, he is not like to come to Zion, al∣though he may talk of it in words, but it stands not in words, for the King and Law giver thereof his ap∣pearance is and will be dreadful to all such, the workers of iniquity, for the proud and all which do wickedly shall be unto him as stubble is unto the fire; and therefore this know plainly, that if you ask the way to Zion aright, your faces must be thither-ward, and your backs full set to Aegypt that is to say, your minds and hearts set against all the deeds of darknesse, which as you love the light, and so bring all your deeds unto it, you will come to see and feell the power of the Lord, you to lead out of the land of darknesse, into his mervellous light, for the gift of God, the light which shineth in the heart it shineth for this very end and purpose, to give the light
of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, Gods salvation from sin, which is so made unto all which believe in him, as he is the true light of the World, and the wisdom of God, and the power of God to keep in the daily crosse, which the wise builders have and do leave behind as a thing too low and mean for them to build in, and therefore have been and are ashamed of it: but to us it is the mighty power of God unto Salvati∣on, by which we are crucified unto the World, and the World unto us, so that we can say with the Saints which are gone before (everlastlasting praises be unto our God for ever) that we are not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the mighty power of God unto Salvation to eve∣ry one that believeth; for the Gospel is the power, and the Crosse is the power, and hereon and herein we build that which the gates of Hell and death cannot destroy, because it is founded on the Rock of Ages, Christ Jesus the light of the World, he that hath an ear to hear let him hear, and he that readeth let him understand, and he which can receive it let him. And thus in plain words have I born my testimony un∣to the World as a witnesse against all the foolish builders and deceivers, and blind guides, which therein live, and this of them I have to say yet not I but the Lord, that of all men in the World their condition is the most miserable, because there is very few of them, if any, which doth not sin against their knowledge, and so are desperate Hy∣pocrites for pieces of bread, and handfuls of barley, to maintain themselves, their Wives and Children in pride and idlenesse, and so murder in their way by consent, to the fulfilling of the Scriptures to their own destruction. And this is my Testimony to all men in righteousnesse for my God through Jesus Christ my Saviour, my righteous∣nesse, wisdom, sanctification and redemption, God over all, hell and death, blessed for ever. Luke Howard. THE END.
