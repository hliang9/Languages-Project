arms of James II HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT. BY THE KING JAMES R. VVHeres We have issued a Proclamation bearing date the fourteenth day of September one thousand six hundred eighty nine, declaring, That such as should bring any Wine or Brandy to Our Camp, should be exempted from the Duty pay∣able to VS out of such Wine and Brandy: Which Proclamation We have issued, to the end that great quantities of Wine and Brandy might be brought to Our Camp, and there sold at reasonable rates. And be∣ing now fully informed, that Our Troops have received no manner of advantage by Our said Declaration; but on the contrary, that the same was made use of by some particular persons, who taking advantage thereof, endeavour'd to ingrose into their own Hands all the Wine and Brandy they could find, in order to sell the same at high rates to Our Army, which they have done accordingly. And since the said Declara∣tion tends to diminish Our Revenue, without any advantage, but rather disadvantage to Our Troops, in whose favour it was published. We have therefore thought fit, from henceforth to revoke; And We do hereby revoke the said Declaration, as to so much thereof as relates to abate of the Duties due to Vs out of wine and Brandy, and make null and void the same, and all the matters therein contained, as far forth as it exempts any person or persons from paying the Duties of wine and Brandy. Given at Our Camp near Our Town of Atherdee the 8th day of October 1689. And in the Fifth Year of Our Reign. By His Majesties Command. RI. NAGLE. God Save The KING.
