TO THE Whole Flock of GOD EVERY WHERE, The Church of the First-born written in Heaven, and, to every Member thereof, whose God is the Lord, and whose Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; Grace Mercy, Peace, Truth and Love from the God of Peace and Love be multiplied amongst you, and to you all, AMEN. YOu are as a City that is set on an Hill, that cannot be hid, you chosen ones of the Lord God, who hath followed the Lamb in the regeneration, You hath God brought through many and great tribulations, and hath washed your garments in the blood of his Son, you hath he compassed about as with a Munition of Rocks, and hath redeemed you, and made you a purchased possssion unto himself; You hath he cloathed with strength and beauty, and hath made you as bold as Lyons, he hath gathered you by his Arm, and hath upheld you by his mighty power, and often hath he spread your Table in the sight of your enemies; he hath tried you as Gold is tried in the Furance, and he hath purified you by his Spirit of Judgement, and burning, that he might take away your drosse, and purge away your Tin; he hath suffered the wicked to plow long and deep surrows upon your backs, that he might try your faith and patience; And in all this you have not fainted, for your Bread hath been sure, and your refreshment hath not failed; He brought
you out of Egypt by a high hand, and thorow the Sea by his mighty Power; His wonders you have seen in the deep, and his marvellous acts among the Sons of men; He hath given you the necks of your Enemies to tread upon, Yea, he hath not withheld any good thing from you, whose wayes hath been di∣rected according to his Truth; Many hath been the hard-ships and difficulties which he hath led you thorow, and great hath been the deliverances which he hath wrought for you, many strong Oaks have bowed before you, because the Lord was ith you, and the shout of a King was amongst you; You have been smit∣ten, but not destroyed, you have been cast down, but not forsaken, the Lord hath been with you in all things, and hath not failed you, who have put your trust in him; Oh! let the high praises o the Lord be in your mouths, as a two edged sword in your hands, for strong is the Lord who pleadeth your cause, at his rebuke the Mountains of the Earth tremble, and the little Hills are moved; O! continue you stedfast in his power, and keep ye the Word of his pati∣ence unto the end, that you may be crowned with everlasting Dominion, over all your Enemies for ever. And now, Oh my dear brethren & sisters, who are called chos∣en and faithful, a peculiar people unto God, and zealous of good works, whom God hath known above all the families of the Earth; Dear is my love unto you, beyond what at present I can express, thorow the strength of which I cannot but express, and declare openly, what the Lord in secret hath shewed me; I have seen the Camp of the Lord in ENGLAND compassed about with many Enemies of several sorts, the Blwarks is laid round about, and a snare at every Corner is prepared, and laid by the enemies of ZIONS con∣verts, the Enemie as a roaring I you, is now going about seeking whom be may devour, for in great wrath he is with the woman who i cloathed with the Sun, and with th remant of her seed, who keep the Testimo∣ny of Jesus, and the Word of God; Mny hath he stirred up to betray the Innocent, who lies lurking in holes and corners, to catch their prey; Great mischief there is intended against the Lords chosen, now must the Beast exalt his horn as hih as the Host of Heaven, for the purging of the Sanctuary of the Lord; And now shall baits of divers colours be laid whereby to snare them whom God hath made free, and now will the Enemie of God mu∣ster up all his forces, that will bear a weapon for him, in hopes to overcome them that keep the Testimony o Jesus, and the Word of
God, but they shall turn against them one way, and flie before them seven wayes, for a total overthrow hath God decreed to come upon all who exalt themselves against him and his children, but first must their iniquiries come to a full growth, which is nigh at hand; Therefore my beloved, put on strength as a Garment, and courage as a Best-plate, and live out of mor∣tal terror, and beware unto whom you let forth your selve; for perillous times are come, wherein brother shall betray brother to death, and the murtherer shall walk in the twilight, who seeks for the precious life; Many false spirits are now abroad in the World, the reign of Antichrist draws near an end; And blessid are they who now watcheth and keepeth their Garments clean, for now must the beast be taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, and be cast together into the Lake of fire, for it is their portion from the Lord; The great whore must now be plagued, who hath long sitten as a Queen, and seen no sorrow, she now must be cast into a bed of endlesse torments, then shall JUDAH be saved, and ISRAEL shall dwell safely, for the Lord i in the midst of them, who feedeth them of the finest of the Wheat, and with honey out of the Rock; So all dear hearts, who are of the Camp of the Lord, go not forth least you be taken in the snares of the wicked, which they have prepared for you. Let neither their frowns nor fatteries overcome you, both of which you will be much assaulted with, and when the Enemy cannot overcome you one way, he will try another, for many will speak fair to your faces, which hath murder in their hearts towards you; and because iniquity doth abound, the love of ma∣ny shall decay, and turn into hatred, and then blessed are you who are not offended, but patiently waits for the salvation of God, which assaredly he will accomplish in his appointed time. And though the Seas rage and swell, and lift up themselves a∣gainst the banks, yet he that did decree that it should not passe its bounds, is the same to day to them who trust in him, and not a hair of your head shall fall to the ground without him; So be bold and valiant for Truth upon the Earth, that God in all things may be glorified, for he is now getting himself a Name in the Earth, and rearing up a Government that shall stand for ever, against which the gates of Hell shall not prevail; And though the
Mountains be cast into the midst of the Sea, yet his decree shall stand sure and firm, for his word is an everlasting Covenant, which who doth believe shall never be moved. Now therefore all you chosen ones of the Lord God, who are the Lords Host, be ye all wise as Serpents, and put on strength and courage, for the Lord is with us of a truth; and walk all cir∣cumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, for Wisdom is better then strength; In the Eternal Light of the Son of God, have I seen spies sent from far to behold your strength, and plottings among many how to invade you, and enter into your fenced City, that hath Salvation for its Wall; great courage hath the enemy taken to in∣vade you, because they see not your strength; but I have seen them as driven stubble before you, & as the wind scattereth the chaff, so the breath of the Lord scattereth them, never more to come together; But first, must you suffer many things by this Generation, whom God hath raised up for that end, that your utmost strength may be tryed, the tryal of which will be much more precious then Gold, to all them who are found faithful in that day which now approacheth near, where in the whole strength of Antichrist shall appear, and his last engagement very great and subtile, such as was not yet known; But the day is the Lords, and the conquest is by him alone, for his is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for evermore; Then shall Judgement be given to the Saints, and the Antient of dayes shall sit upon the wicked, and they shall eat the fruit of their doings; but the Lord shall be unto his Saints and Servants, an everlasting Light, and the dayes of their mourning shall come to an end. So all dear Brethren and Sisters, be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might, and put on the whole Armour of God, and give no place to the enemy in the particular nor in the general, let not the Multitude of Pharaohs host make you afraid, nor the strength of Antichrist cause you to fly, for though they turn against you one way they shall fly before you seven wayes, and though they flourish as a green Bay tree Winter & Summer, yet in a moment shall they be consumed from the Earth, and their glory be turned into everlasting contempt, the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it. And all dear hearts who are convinced of the Eternal truth, and are not yet come to feel deliverance from the bondage of
Corruption, but sees your enemies many within and without, and are as it were between hope and fear, trust you perfectly in the Name of the Lord by which you are called, that you may see him your Wall in the time of storm; for many will the assaults of the enemy be, to draw you back again into Egypt, and many dangers will he set before you, that he may overthrow your faith and patience, and he will seek by all means to vaile that which should let you see the Lords strength; and then will he bring in weakness and fears upon you, and cause you to stumble and stagger at the promises which are yea and Amen to the seed of God in you; for he will sift you as wheat, and fan you in the wind of his wrath; but the Lord will be with you in all these things, who will not suffer your feet to be moved, but will be a present help to all you who trusteth perfectly in his Name, by which you are called. And though he may suffer the wicked to triumph for a time, and to incompass his heritage as a flood, yet their root shll soon become rotten, and their blossom shall fly up as the dust, for Gods controversie is nigh to be Sealed against them (never more to be revoked,) who have hardned their hearts and stifned their necks against his Government, and they that will not that he should now rule over them, must now be slain by the word of his mouth. Therefore dearly beloved, be not soon moved from the hope of the Gospel in Christ Jesus, but remain stedfast in him, that your strength by him may be renewed, and be kindly affectionated one to another and bear one another burthens, that so you may be strengthened one in another, and be refreshed one by another, that so the Eternal Name of God by which you are called may be Adorned by you and in you; for God hath not called you to wrath, but to obtain Salvation thorow his Son Jesus Christ, who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, to whom be Glory an Im∣mortality for ever and ever, Amen. Again, all you plants of the Lord God who are Rooted in the Truth, wait upon the Lord that you may grow in the same, and let your moderation be known unto all men, For the Lord hath a Glorious work to accomplish through you, which few yet understands; and for that end is he now fitting you for himself, and giving you a heart to do his will, that he may abide with you for ever; for he
hath chosen you for his Portion and for his peculiar Treasure; Oh therefore be you Zealous for his Name and his Truth up∣on the Earth, and walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, edeem∣ing the time because the days are evil, not in chambering & wanton∣ness, not in strife and envy, but in truth and sincerity, be ye pat∣terns one to another in the way of life, that you may increase your strength in him, who hath all Power in his hand, who assuredly will now make a short work in the Earth, for his lect sake, which hath long cryed, How long Lord holy and true, &c. for this hath he remembred in the multitude of his mercies, and no∣thing shall be able to hinder him from relieving of it, for it is his own, and his delight is in it, and he will rebuke oppressors of it, and chasten them with his Iron Rod, and break them to pieces as a Potters vessel, and none shall be able to rescue them out of his hand; for he is jealous of his honour, and his renown will he not give to another, his Name shall be great in the Earth, and his truth among the sons of men, his glory is appearing as the morning without Clouds, and his brightness is going forth as the Noon-day, the whole Earth shall be filled with his glory, and the ends there∣of shall look unto to him for Salvation, which he is now accomplish∣ing for all who truly wait upon him, they shall say the Lord is our God alone, our strength alone, our deliverer alone, our Rock, our refuge, and there is none besides him in Heaven or Earth that is able to save or destroy, the Kingdom is his, the power is his, and the glory his for evermore. Then shall the Lord be known to be one, his Name one, and all the Gods of the Heathen shall be famished, and the Idols of the World shall come into everlasting contempt, and perpetual shame which shall never be blotted out, and the living God shall be the God of the whole Earth, and all Nations shall flow unto him, then shall a little Child play upon the hole of an Asp, and the weaned Child shall put his hand in the Cockatrice Den without any harm; for the destroyer shall be cast out, and there shall be none to hurt in all the Holy Mountain of the Lord, for it shall be restored into its former perfect Beauty; and the Earth shall be filled with the knowldge of the glory of God, as the waters cover the Sea; and many shall say come let us walk in the Light of the Lord, up unto the Mountain of the Lord, and he will teach us of his way, and we will walk therein, for the Lord is our God, and we are his people,
and the sheep of his Pasture, who will make mention of his Name in the deep, and his glory upon an Instrument of ten Strings; for the beauty of holiness is come to be seen, and the Image of the Heaven∣ly is fully renewed; This thing God is hastening to accomplish, and he will assuredly bring it to pass in his appointed time, for all who continues in patience and well-doing unto the end; for this is the reward of the Righteous whom the Lord is now bring∣ing thorew many Tribulations, in whose Mouths shall be the high praises of the Lord God for ever more. Then shall the Merchants of abylon be plagued with a fore destruction, for the reward of iniquity shall be given unto them, they shall howl for pain of heart, and rore for grief of spirit, and none shall pitty them, reprobate silver shall they be called, because God hath rejected them, for their manifold transgressions hath reached to Heaven which hath provoked the most high to wrath dayes wihout Number, Oh! that my head were as waters, and mine eyes a Fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the misery that is coming upon them; for thy have been treacherous both to God and man, and hath far overpassed the deeds of the wicked deceivers in the dayes of Old; what shall I say of them, they are fit objects for Gods eternal vengeance to be poured upon without mixure, wch will be their reward from the God of Heaven for ever; all the I mean King, Parli∣amnts and Pro∣tectr. Mountains wch from time to time they have cried unto to cover them, under which they have crept many ages shall not then hide them from the heavy stroke of the Almighty God, who is now a∣rising to plead with them by his sword and by fire; they shall not cumber the Earth very long, neither shall they grieve the Lord many years longer, but he will ease himself of them, in over-throwing them in his hot displeasure; for they have long slighted his mercy & often dispsed the offers of his grace, there∣fore will he laugh at their destruction, and mock when their fear cometh, which now hasteneth apace, out of which none shall be able to deliver them. So all my dear bretheren and Sisters in the Lord, and in his pretious truth, which shall abide for ever, let not your hearts be troubled, neither be ye dismayed, for the Lord will rstore Sion as at the first, and Jerusalm as at the beginning; and his Name shall be great among his Children, and his blessing shall rest upon
them for ever; therefore all prize his Eternal love, and walk all worthy of it in your particular places & callings, where the Lord hath set you, that you may blossom as the Rose, and spring as the Lilly in the field, and may send forth a sweet Savour to the Lord God in the Land of the Living; often are you in my re∣membrance, even in the night season, when deep sleep falls upon men, then do I enter into the Sanctuary of the Lord, and behold your beauty and comliness which my Heavenly Father hath a∣dorned you withall, with which my heart is ravished; and when I consider the unexpressible love and mercy of God to us-ward, I am even overcome therewith; So this I write unto you, being part of the overflowings of the Fathers love in me towards you, which runneth forth freely unto the elect of God every where, a∣mong whom I desire this may be read in their particular assemblies in Gods fear and wisdome, to the edifying, preserving, and strengthning of the whole flock of God, for which end it was given forth. Written in Hampton, the 8th. of the 10. Month, 1660.
