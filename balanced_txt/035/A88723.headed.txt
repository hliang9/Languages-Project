The last endeavour to preserve the Committee of Safety, pre∣sented to publick view, and censure; by a Member weary of sitting in DERBY-HOƲSE. HAving for these many daies laboured to reduce Colchester by violence, but in vaine, and used di∣vers artifices to as little purpose, to entangle the loyal Sea-men in a new engagement: It was at last resolved that the late Vice-Admiral Rainsborough have leave from Derby-house to steal away to the Navy, and there make publick acknowledgment of his errours, desiring those per∣sons, who were VVitnesses of his pernitious Opinions and Practises, may testifie his sorrow and repentance. This shall vote him a Traytor, and so occasion his entertainment and admittance into some place of Trust, which he must use to the best advantage of the Godly party. Towards the Redu∣cing of Colchester and Pembroke, it is resolved that the 2 blanks which were found in the Pocket of Master Coventry, signed by the Prince of VVALES, be filled up with letters to the loyall Parties in those places, advising them to resigne their se∣verall charges upon as good terms as they may, seeing the Subscriber of those Letters, (the Prince of Wales) is not in a condition to afford them any relief. Let no man slight this truth because the name of the di∣vulger is not affixed to this Paper, for let all men know he doth not fear to justifie thus much, with his life, but forbears yet, that he may be enabled to publish more of the like na∣ture: Thus much could not be concealed any longer with∣out manifest impiety, more may not yet be revealed without the imputation of indiscretion. FINIS.
