The Word of the Lord to the Inhabitants of LEEDS. OH Inhabitants of Leeds and the adjacent places belong∣ing, I am burdened in spirit till I write unto you, and you Rulers and Priests thereof especially shall know in the day of the Lords account, that I set not my hand to Paper till I was commanded of the Lord, the fire of whose jea∣lousie is kindled, though you are not yet come to the feeling of it, to burn and consume the house of Esau which is as stubble, that his Servant Jacob, (whom Esau for a time Lords over) may have the Inheriance in the purchased possession where none can make afraid, and to give his Israel rest and deliverance from under hard-hearted Pharaoh, in bringing him even all the Seed which is but one, into the Land of uprightnesse which flows with milk and hony, that their souls may be refreshed in the green pa∣stures of love, and every one have rest under their own vine, and rejoyce in the paths of holiness for evermore. And this is his work notwithwanding the hardnesse of your hearts, which in tears I expresse unto you, and the Lord rebuke that spirit which cannot believe in the spirit of Truth, which gives every particular who are obedient to feel after Gods Righteous∣nesse and worship in Spirit and Truth, in the true separation from the carnal, without which Friends you feel and enjoy, all Profession is but sandy, and building thereon; the time is hasting on a pace, that the overflowing Scourge must passe, and surely all thats not built upon the Rock Christ Jesus will be thrown down; Ther∣fore in plainness and in Gods Love I exhort you to consider your standing, and try what spirit you are of, and to what root you are grafted in, for such as the tree such is the fruit, if the Root be holy the branches are holy; And the visitation of Gods Love is yet to you that you may come to the feeling after him, that not any of you who as yet are in Ignorance may perish for want of the true Knowledge, But to you that yet sit in darkness and under the Regi∣on of the shadow of death light may spring up, according to the promise, to work this effect, as tis witnessed by all the Children of God, 2 Cor. 14. God who commanded light to shine out of darknesse hath shi∣ned
in our hearts, to give us the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; And this is that (the Light) which you must come as to a chief Corner-stone, which as yet is rejected by you who are of the World, as is manifest by your practise, and the day is come wherein the Lord abhors profession without the life and power of godlines, and his Sword of the Spirit is drawn to cut down that wch cumbers the ground, the briars and the Thorns, which tears the fleece of the sheep; and scarce would suffer them to live upon the earth. O People and unwise, do you not know that the Lord hath a controversie with you for these things, and you that are in the Iniquity shall not escape punishnent, though you joyn hand in hand, and make many covers from the Scriptures, and plead for the Traditions and Customs of the Fathers, who lived in Ignorance as well as you, and through the profession of a Law and the Scrip∣tures which was read every Sabbath day, crucified the just and did dispightfully unto the Spirit of Grace, for this I speak in the Truth, that your life is not according to the Scriptures nor the power of godlinesse; So wait, be patient and consider your errour, for in this it is partly demonstrated by your particular acting towards me who am a witnesse against your deeds. For thus it was to me, early in the morning upon the fourth day of the first month, the Word of the Lord came unto me, (mine eyes spiritually being on the Inhabitants of this place) Go speak unto them, You are a Peo∣ple fitted for destruction, because you believe not in that which mortifies the flesh, the Spirit of Truth is that which mortifies the flesh, and who be∣lieves not in this, and waits not in this, destruction is of themselves; and the Steeple-house sacrifice or service which is external, as the Priests manifests doth not work any thing unto this, the Redemption of the Soul; And when I came into the Steeple-house he who is called a Pastor or a Mini∣ster was expounding (as tis called) and after he had done, these words beforementioned came on me to speak, and before I had them all uttered, they manifested themselves not to be a Church but a Synagogue, according as tis Recorded in John 16. These things have I spoken unto you that you should not be offended, The time shall come when they shall cast you out of the Synagogue, so they did, & not on∣ly so, but cast me into prison; And thou who is called the Pastor was speaking to the people that though some did censure you, yet you were to be so charitable as not to be violent to them, as even to squeeze blood out of them, or the like, and then Imediately the little effect of thy words was seen, for as soon as I had got the words of Truth spoken, away
with me to prison; and where is your charity in this, and what is this but violence, and even to squeeze blood out of one, for what know you but by such dealings a tender body might be destroyed, as several of the Innocent witnesses of God hath been, for the Testimony to Truth bearing, in the Prisons of England. And also John Sayles thou gave forth this Doctrine to the people, to feed upon, viz. That the Ministers work is onely to meddle with the external things, as the Sacraments and the like, and to leave the work of the Spirit to Christ. O thou dark Antichristian Minister, which never was made a Minister by God, according to the Testimo∣ny wherein all the Ministers of Christ are, Acts 26.16. I have ap∣peared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a Minister and a witnesse of the things which thou hast seen, and of the things which shall appear un∣to thee, delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darknnsse to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive for∣givenesse of sins, and an Inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me; and John 19.19. As thou hast sent me into the World, even so have I also sent them into the World; Mind this Pastor and People, Christ Jesus was not sent carnally to meddle with external things, touching the Redemption of souls, but he was in God Reconciling the world unto himself, preaching deliverance unto those who was in captivity, and bringing the prisoner out of pri∣son, the seed from under the bondage and power of Satan, and saith he, as thou hast sent me into the world, so have I also sent them into the world, and he prayed that they all might be one as the Father was one in him and he in him, that they all may be one in us, that the world might believe that thou hast sent me; mark, here is one cause of the unity, that the World might be convinced and believe the Fa∣ther sent him, and in the same message is his Ministers; But who can be convinced and believe by such dark Pastours as thou art, and you Teachers of the World generally are, who do not wit∣nesse the unity with Christ and to be sent by him onely, to wit∣nesse the work in the eternal, and not in the external which is temporal? And so you are manifest here by this Doctrine, that you are of the earth and first man in old Adams Transgression; and so keeps people in the earth, in the letter and the corrupt, and this brings not people out of the darknesse into the light to sit together with Christ Jesus in the heavenly places, into the unity of the faith to be refreshed together in Gods Spiritual Worship, nor
your Ministry brings not out of prison but keeps in prison, con∣trary to Christs, to which end the gifts was given by him who ascended up on high, Eph. 4. and gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till all come to the unity of the Faith, which gives the victory over the World, so over sin, contrary to your dark Ministry; and to this end was the gifts given to be Pastors and Teachers, to perfect the Saints, which now all your carnal Sacraments and Rudiments cannot bring this to passe, viz. perfection in the Saints degree; Then come and let us reason with you, To what purpose is all your Ringing of Bells, dead prayers, dead Sermons, Bread and Wine, singing of Davids experiences, Baptizing with a little cold water, being all external things, which cannot bring to perfect the Saints. I say in the fear of the Lord consider, what is all these to purpose, and wherein doth God require these things at your hands, seeing you have excluded or separated your selves from Christs unity, and so your gifts are bought and sold with mony, and may you not well be called the Merchants of Babylon? Therefore O Royal Seed where ever thou art, turn away from these, who through covetousnesse make merchandize of souls, and are evidently separate by their life and Doctrine from the unity of Christ, and so from his Ministry, for I shew thee that first the pow∣er of the light of Christ working mightily in them, delivers them from a people that sits in darknesse and evil; And then in the time of his love gives the command to them as Ministers, as he did to Paul in the spirit, when he delivered him from the perse∣cuting state and dark condition, he sent him to this end, to open their eyes, and turn them from darknesse to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, &c. which now you Pastors and Ministers so called of Leeds, I charge you to give an account of this Testimony, viz. your deliverance from the evil, the pride, the covetousnesse, the envy, the drunkennesse, the lasciviousnesse, the feasting of the Rich, and neglecting the poor, the envy and the wrath that is in the hearts of people, with all the works of the flesh, and that you are Redeemed from these, and sent by God in the spirit to them to speak the mind of Christ, without coveting any mans gold or silver, or else be silent for shame, and come under the judgement, and first pluck the beam out of your own eye, and then you may see the evil that is in others, which bondages their souls, and so
be profitable to them and not hurtful, till which be witnessed you cannot fly from the judgement, but are the blind guides, and none but the blind are led by you; So I beseech you in the spi∣rit of love be warned, and let the light in your own particulars search you, Rent your hearts, and strip you of every false cover∣ing; This is a false covering, for you to be named Ministers of Christ, and your work onely external, This is a false covering for you to be called Presbyterians, to lay on hands for the work of the Ministery, and call Elders, when you never came yet to the babes estate, to desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby to become Elders in the Truth, whilst you have been taking the letter for the Word, the Baptizing with outward water for the Baptism of Christ, to give the name Christian, the Bread and Wine carnal for the Supper of Christ, and the Light of Christ which is able to save to the utmost all that come to God by him, the light, to be that of a natural conscience, for the Scripture Records these to be in the power of the Spirit; Therefore search the Scriptures and see whether these things be so, and you finding them thus, be a∣shamed of your forms, and come to Christ the Light who is the life of men, kisse him that judgeth, who is the Son of Righteous∣nesse, least his wrath kindle speedily against you, and you be con∣sumed from not being a people because of disobedience. And thou Martin Hyles who made this Prison much-what to put the witnesses of God in which testifie against deceit; Remember Hamans policy, wrath and envy against the upright-hearted Jew, and what did that avail him in the end, or was not he worse for that and not better? Take heed, in the dread of God I warn thee to Repentance of thy past actions against the upright-hear∣ted who worship God in Spirit and Truth, the Righteous Seed, and let thy rashnesse be turned into moderation, and thy spirit of fury into love and meeknesse. And if thou be a Magistrate, be glad to defend the Innocent, and let true Justice passe upon the workers of iniquity, for thats the Magistrates place, and this Greeting is to thee Martin Hyles from thy prison-house, And to you all Rulers and Priests in and about this Leeds, who live in the flesh, and worship not God in Spirit and Truth, lay aside all superfluity of naughtinesse, and let the time past be sufficient for you to have persecuted the Innocent, and cause the People of God by Creation to erre, who as yet sit in darknesse, by your lyes and lightnesse, pride and vanity, many are yet under your
and kept in the Land of darknesse, as sheep scattered in the darke and cloudy day, And your selves with the lust of your own hearts keep the witnesse under Deaths Dominion in the particular, And so may not the dispersed of Israel say what good can be expected from such Teachers and Leaders who themselves are in bondage to Satan the Prince of darknesse; may not a Lamentation be ta∣ken up in the true Prophesie concerning this people, They build up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity, the heads thereof judge for reward, and the Priests thereof teach for hire, the Prophets thereof Divine for money, yet will they lean upon the Lord and say, is not the Lord a∣mong us, none evil can come upon us, is not this your building, is not this your practise? O Leeds, England and New-England, there∣fore cease from this wherein ye provoke the Lord to wrath, and let your right eye be put out as concerning this, and your hand wither and become dead as touching this, for what will it avail you to strive against the stream; For the Lord to his People is be∣come a place of Broad Rivers and stream of water, and if ever you come to Redemption you must be plowed as a field, and separa∣ted with the Word of God from your blood-thirstinesse, pride, arrogancy and deceit, the workers of which cannot enter into the Kingdom of God: Therefore come to the feeling of the Just which tells you envy is of the Devil, pride and swelling words of vanity and the lust of the eye is of the World, and not of the Father, and if any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him, take counsel at the Spirit of God and weigh the thing, for this which expresseth unto thee in the love of the Fa∣ther would not have your souls to perish; So if you love your souls be obedient, and let not the enemy betray you through his wisdom in keeping you from the sence of the new Creature, and in that old Adams state imagines there can be no due order as to Government and Worship (in the generation chosen out from you) but the living wisdom is made manifest in the separation from the Worlds Idolatry, in which state our Officers shall be peace and our Exactors Righteousnesse, our Judges restored as at the first, and our Counsellors as at the beginning: So the li∣ving order of Gods Spirit is not run from but witnessed, And the Creature waits for the earnest expectation of the Son of God, to be freed from the bondage of iniquity, and he is the Son of God, the Light of the World, whom all the Kingdoms of the earth must become his, the Lord Jesus Christ who is of power, authority and wis∣dom
to Rule over all with a Rod of iron, and this is that I would bring you up into, out of the carnal and deceit, wherein is the strife, that in the obedience to the Just you may come into the enjoyment of Gods Righteousness; And if you here contenin or speak against this Government, the true sword of the Spirit may be turned against you; so try your wayes and come out of the pit of destruction, that the life of Innocency you may feel, to partake of the Lambs mercy. And you friends who are of the Seed, convinced with the Just in your own particulars, and in stilnesse, the light in your hearts discovers unto you the enmity of the unjust, and lets you see the evil of the World, the wickednesse of the times, so that whilest ye are mingled with the heathen which worship not God in spirit and Truth, you are wrong, and the wrong is unrighte∣ous which cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; Therefore O friends, joyn with the Righteous principle that discovers unto you the wrong, the unrighteous, and herein is the weight and the burthen felt which must be cast off, that lets for running the race of holinesse, and the command is grievous to the disobedi∣ent but rejoycing to the Just, he is near, the light, to give thee strength to come through the power of darkness in your own particulars, then the powers of darknesse without you will be as ashes under the feet of the pure, and the living faith through your steadfast love to the Truth will encrease to purfie the heart and cleanse your souls with the precious blood of the Lamb slain since the foundation of the World, and this friends the salvation of your souls is more precious than all the things of the earth; So in the love of God which would draw you unto him, and give you a mansion in his house, be faithful and valiant, and look not at the enemies advantages, which would draw from the least simplicity of the Gospel to uphold his kingdom which must be thrown down, and the pure Authority established, so fly not that which is to bring near into Gods love, the Crosse, the obedience unto Gods witnesse, who waits to lead thee up to the Land of the living, hear his voyce, the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world, and look not at names or Reproaches, but count them Riches, and all names whatsoeuer the persons being not in the nature of Christ, there is rottennesse in the bones, and not a sweet savour unto God, which except Christ the life be witnes∣sed in the mortal body, the soul is under Deaths dominion; So
come forth & partake with the sufferings that thou mayest Reign with him in the glorious state, Christ Iesus the Prince of peace, whose banner of love is stretched forth to Redeem the captives of Iudah, and re∣store the preserved of Israel, Glory, honour and everlasting pray∣ses be given unto him by all the seed in whom sin Reigns not in their mortal bodies, who are the saints of the most high God. Samuel Watson. THE END. LONDON: Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Sign of the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1660.
