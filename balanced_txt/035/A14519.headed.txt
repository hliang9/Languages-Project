BY HIS MAIESTIES Counseil for Virginia. A BRIEFE DE∣CLARATION OF the present state of things in Virginia, and of a Diuision to be now made, of some part of those Lands in our actuall possession, as well to all such as haue aduentured their monyes, as also to those that are Planters there. WHen first it pleased GOD to moue his MAIESTIES minde, at the humble suit of sundry his louing Sub∣iects, to yeeld vnto them his gracious Priuiledge for the Virginia Planta∣tion, it was a thing see∣ming strange and doubtfull in the eye of the World, that such and so few Vnder-takers should enterprise a charge of that waight, as
rather beseemed a whole State and Common∣wealth to take in hand. But such was the suc∣cesse of their sundry attempts, in the happy discouery of so goodly a Land, the Descrip∣tion of which, for the excellencie of the Cli∣mate and fertilitie thereof, had soone obtay∣ned to lay such an assured ground of future hope, in the sence and vnderstanding of all men rightly weighing it, that not long after, ther new Letters Patents, with more ample pri∣uiledges granted by his Maiestie, were almost filled with many hundred Names, both Ho∣nourable, and others of all sorts, that gaue their hands and consent to further and vphold that honourable action. Vpon which encouragement of so many worthy Patrons, the Companie very deepe∣ly engaged themselues, in sending Men and Ships, Cattle, and all kinde of prouisions, with Gouernours and Captaines for peace and war, insomuch as no earthly meanes seemed then wanting for the speedy reducing of that barba∣rous Nation, and sauage people, to a quiet Chri∣stian Common-wealth. But such was the will of Almighty God, as the world well knoweth, that this great hope and preparation, by many disasters on Sea and Land, too long to be here recited, was in a manner cleane defeated, and there onely remai∣ned a poore remnant of those Men and Wo∣men,
Cattle and prouisions, that escaped the danger and which are now remayning there to rayse and build vp that intended Colonie. Which when those Gentlemen th'aduenturers here saw, and that the expectance of so great a preparation brought nothing home but ad∣uerse successe and bad reports, they for the most part withdrew themselues, in despaire of the enterprize, and so gaue it ouer, not endu∣ring to repayre the ruines, nor to supply what themselues had vnderwritten, to discharge the deepe engagement, whereinto the Company was drawne by their encouragement. By whose vnconstancie and irresolution, the hope of that Plantation, together with the liues of our people there, had then vtterly perished, had not Gods secret purpose beene more strongly fixed to vphold the same, by stirring vp the mindes and vndaunted spirits of a very small remnant of constant Aduenturers, that with Sir Thomas Smith (their Treasurer and Go∣uernour from the beginning) in all that time of three yeares disaster, were neuer discouraged, nor withdrew themselues from weekely Courts and meetings, yeelding their purses, credit and counseil, from time to time, to make new sup∣plies, euen beyond their proportion, to vphold the Plantation. Insomuch as by the fauourable assistance of God, who in his owne wisdome doth oftentimes
effect the greatest ends by weakest meanes, it is now come to passe, that our English Colonie there, subsisteth in a very good and prosperous condition: They sow and reape their Corne in sufficient proportion, without want or impeach∣ment; their Kine multiply already to some hundreds, their Swine to many thousands, their Goates and Poultry in great numbers, euery man hath house and ground to his owne vse, and now being able to maintaine themselues with food, they are also prepared and ready, once hauing the meanes, to set vpon the Mine∣rals, whereof there are many sorts; as also to plant and sow such seuerall kindes of Seeds and Fruits, as may best befit the Soyle and Climate, to make the Land profitable to themselues and th'Aduenturers. This being a true Relation of the present state and hope of things in VIRGINIA, wee thought good in this short manner to mention it by the way, as well to giue those worthy Go∣uernours in VIRGINIA their deserued praise, for the vnspeakable paines and hazzard which they haue endured there, in framing the people and Plantation to so happy a forme, as also to with∣draw the despayring thoughts of such old rety∣red Aduenturers, that make no other reckon∣ing, but whatsoeuer hath beene spent vpon the name of VIRGINIA to be lost and cast away; the speciall purpose of this our Publication,
being to another end, which for the further satis∣fying of all reasonable minded, wee will now in few words deliuer. It was published to the world, about seauen yeares since, and the time is now expired, where∣in wee promised to cause a Diuident to be made of the Lands in Virginia, as well to euery mans person that went himselfe to the Plantation, as to euery particular man that had aduentured his money. And in as much as we are now by the Natiues liking and consent, in actuall possession of a great part of the Country, the other part not as yet freed from encomber of woods and trees, nor throughly suruayed, whereby to make a Diuident of the whole: yet of that part which is now fit for Plantation, we intend God wil∣ling to beginne a present Diuision by Lot to euery man that hath already aduentured his mony or person, for euery single share of twelue pound tenne shillings, fifty Acres of Land, till further opportunitie will afford to diuide the rest, which we doubt not will bring at least two hundred Acres to euery single share. This Diuision is intended to be done by a new Gouernour with Commissioners and Sur∣veyers to be sent from hence to ioyne with others that are there already, to giue euery man his Lot in due proportion, according to such
indifferent Directions as shall be giuen them in charge. And forasmuch as this course of sending a Gouernor with Commissioners and a Suruayor, with Men, Ships, and sundry prouisions, for for∣tifications and other occasions, as all men may conceiue, cannot bee effected without great charge and expence to the Company; it is there∣fore thought requisite, and determined, that so many Aduenturers as will partake of this first Diuident, shall present their Names, with their number of shares, into a Booke remayning at Sir Thomas Smiths for that purpose, before the 25. of Iune next. And they shall also promise vnder their hands, to contribute to the said charge, the summe of twelue pound ten shillings, to be paid with∣in one Moneth after Subscription, whether his shares be more or lesse, except any man shall be pleased to aduenture more, and for which twelue pound ten shillings (or more if hee will) he shall also haue a further Diuident of land in proportion, as for all other his monies formerly aduentured. But for such as are not able to lay downe present monie, if they shall desire fauour, it is agreed for them, that the Treasurer may receiue the one halfe of their said aduenture in present money, after their vnderwriting, to fur∣nish out the ships, and the other halfe at sixe Moneths after that.
And that no man may hereafter excuse him∣selfe by ignorance, nor taxe the Company for concealing their purpose, we declare to all men, that this present Diuision is to be onely in the Lands lying along the Kings Riuer on both sides, and all about the new Townes erected; in which so many as shall giue in their names as aforesaid, may haue their parts, and those that will not, may at their pleasure forbeare till here∣after, to take their Lot vpon the same tearmes in places more remote. The Names of all such as will partake of this Diuident, shall be giuen in writing to the Com∣missioners before they goe hence, at whose re∣turne they shall bring with them a perfect Map and Description of the said lands and ground diuided, that euery man may see and know in what condition and where his land lyeth, that accordingly he may dispose thereof at his plea∣sure, eyther by going himselfe in person to pos∣sesse it, or by sending families to manure it for yearely rent, or for halfe the cleare profits as many others doe. And furthermore, euery mans portion allot∣ted to him, shall be confirmed as state of inhe∣ritance to him and his heyres for euer, with bounds and limits vnder the Companies Seale, to be holden of his Maiestie, as of his Manour of East Greenwich, in Socage Tenure, and not in Capite, according to his Maiesties gracious Let∣ters
Patents already granted to the VIRGINIA Company in that behalfe. And notwithstanding, as we hope, the chiefe brunt and doubt of that Plantation is now ouer∣past, whereof to their great charge and hazzard the old Aduenturers haue endured the most dif∣ficult part, and might therefore iustly appropri∣ate this present Diuident to themselues, yet at the motion and desire of many Gentlemen and others, intending to be new aduenturers, it is re∣solued and granted by the Company, that all new Aduenturers, subscribing and performing the conditions before mentioned, for twelue pound tenne shillings, or more, shall partake in proportion as freely in this present Diuident, and in any other priuiledge and free∣dome in VIRGINIA, as if with the old Aduenturers they had been partakers from the beginning. ({inverted ⁂}) FINIS.
