To goodman Chappels supplication. HArry who ball harke, mast Camell hath yzeene Thy vengeance zory bill, and thompes the as I wene, And is by Christ full zad, that thou comest out zo late, Thou mightest haue had a place vor Pekehorn at his gate But vortune frended not, chote it very well, The more harde happe thou hadst, ich doo the plainly tell. Vor zure charde hym sweare, by gogs digne daintie bones, Thou shoods be newe ishod, to trample these olde stones, And westwardes shodst haue zit, for blearyng of thyn eies. Vor zommer nowe a teowes, will hurt the zore with flies, But he no nyggon is, a wyll vorde the a flappe, Thou shalt haue a voxtayle man, to put vpon thy cappe, And goddes benison to, tho Churcharde tye hym shorte, Churchard weares a bel ats tail to make his frendes sport, And Camell choppes holy water, for Churcharde & for the, Vor he wyll to you bothe, a holy chaplayn be. And if a vittin not, er twaie daies bee agoe, He wyll you sprinkle bothe, as varre as I doo knowe. Tis a vengeance beast, and bygge to beare you all, And if you zit not vast, bum faie, map to vall. Thomas Camell. Imprinted at London by Henry Sutton.
