FOR THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND, AND THEIRARMY SO CALLED. YOƲR day into darknesse is turned; the Sun is gone down over you; ye have had a large day, and power given unto you; to have done the will of God; But you have abused the power; and sleighted your day; and you have Refused to doe the Lords wrke and have sought to serve your selves; and not the Lord; Therefore in Justice and Righteousnesse is the day wherein you might have wrought for God; taken from you; and the thick dark night of Confusion is Come upon you; wherein you are groping and stumbling, and cannot worke, the decree is gone out, and sealed against you; and it Cannot be Recalled; you are not the men (as ye stand) in whome God will appeare to worke deliverance for his People, and Creatures; (and yet deliverance shall Come, but not according to mans Exspeciation) But as for you, yee have Rejected the Councell of the Lord; and greeved his spirit, and he hath long borne you; yea; you are de∣arted from the Lord, and his presence is departed from you; Indeed he hath hewed with you (and if you had been faithfull to the End, he would have honoured and prospered you, and have been your sufficient Reward) yee were his Ax, but you have bosted your selves against him; therefore as you have beaten, and hewed, and broken others, Even so must you be beaten, hewed and broken, for you have greevously provoked the Lord, and if be should now suffer that tree, which yee have Cut, to fall upon you; and to break part of you, it were Just. Oh ye Trecherous, willfull, proud, selfe-seeking people, who have despised the Counsell of the Lord, and would not take warning though he have sent his prophets and servants Early and Late among you, some of whome you have Imprisoned, and despitfully used; what will yee doe now, whom will you now flee unto for help; see∣ing yee are departed from the Lord, and are now Renting and tearing, biting and devouring one another, for proud ambissious selfe Ends; (Mark) if yee would now build againe, the thing that you once destroyed; that shall not be able to hide, or shelter you from the wrath of the Lambe; that way whereby you think to strengthen your selves, thereby shall you make your selves much weaker, and help forward your own destruction; you are now, but a Rod, Remember your End, which hastens greatly; And now Breach upon Breach, Insurrection upon Insurrection, Overturning upon Overturning, Heaps upon Heaps, Division upon Division shall there be; untill he Come to Raigne, whose Right it is; and all Nations must bow before him; Else he will break them with his Iron Rod. They that trust in, or leane upon you, for help; it is as if they leaned upon a broken Reed which is not able to help it selfe; nor others; indeed you have been made to doe many good things; but you would not goe through with the worke, which God will have accomplished; and therefore are these things come upon you; Therefore tremble and dread before the Lord, yee who have been as strong Oakes, and tall Sedars; for now shall your strength faile you and you shall be weake, even  the weakest of men, but if you would yet beleive in the light; and truely submit to Gods righteous judgements, many of you might come to witnesse your soules saved, in the day of the Lord; though many of your bodyes are to be throwne by (because of your greivous backslidings) as not counted worthy to be the Lords workmen. There is a small remnant yet among you (for whom my soule breaths) who may be winnowed out; and if they will owne the judgement of the Lord, and truly and throughly deny themselves, and follow his leadings, he will heale their backslidings; and purge them; that so they may be instruments in his hand: But they that will con∣tinue with you; in your sins; shall partake with you; of your judgements. 11th month (59) From one, who am made willing both to suffer, and to raigne with Christ; even to follow him whether soever he goeth. George Fox the younger. The Rod of the wicked, shall not alwayes rest upon the back of the righteous; yet even as gould is tryed; so shall they be; that they may be white, and without spot, before the Lambe: But God will avenge their cause; and woe then will be to their oppressors and then shall the majesty, and glory of the Lord, fill his people (who have long been troden under) and they shall be the dread of all Nations, the zeale of the Lord of Host shall performe it. Printed for M. W. 11th month, 1659.
