A True and Faithful Account of the intire Defeat of the Rebbel Dundee by Major General Maccay, with the Number of the Slain. With Allowance, June the 24th, 1689. SAtterday in the Afternoon an Express arriv'd from Scotland, and another Yesterday, both of which brought a succession of Glad-Tydings from that Kingdom of no less Import, then the Surrender of the Castle of Edenburgh to King William; for as that Condition draw'd the Consequence of future Success upon the Rebel Dundee, so the Defeat of that Incendiary will no doubt con∣tribute to the Re-establishing the Repose of that Country, which we find to be, viz. That Major General Maccay by his Wise Conduct brought the King's Forces into such advantageous Posts in the High-Lands, sur∣mounting all the difficulties which the Viscount endeavoured to bring upon him, by dogging him from Hill to Hill, Ensnared him at last in his own Politick Method, making such faint Marches and Counter-Marches, as to draw him into a Defile thro' which he could not so suddenly pass, but that it gave the opportunity to a Detach∣ment of the General's Forces, to oblige him to a Fight, which for some time was obstinately maintained by the Rebels, but within the space of Three Quarters of an Hour the Viscount with all his People was Intirely Defeated, One Hundred and Thirty being Kill∣ed upon the spot, besides divers made Prisoners, the Viscount him∣self narrowly escaping not with about Twenty Horse. The other Express says, That the Parliament after their Ad∣journment to the 17th Instant, met accordingly, to whom his Ex∣cellency, Duke Hamilton, his Majesties High Commissioner, made a most Excellent Speech, and had the Thanks of the House return'd him for it, they having gone thro' all the Preliminaries of taking the Oaths to King William and Queen Mary, Two Members only Declining, who were afterwards Expelled the House, and the Par∣liament affirmed all the Proceedings of the late Convention to be Legal and Binding. The Lord Hume being brought to Edenburgh as suspected to be going to Dundee, is Committed Prisoner to the Castle. And it further adds, That his Majesties Ship, the Jerusalem, Captain Bettwell Commander, with others in his company, Laden with Am∣munition and Provision from the City of Bristol, are safely arrived in London-Derry, (as by Letters out of the Place assures,) to the Inexpressible Joy of those People, the Irish not having then finish∣ed their Bomes across the Lough. Printed by John Wallis in White-Friars, 1689.
