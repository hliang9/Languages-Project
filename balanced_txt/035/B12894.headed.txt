depiction of England's coat of arms, 1625 HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT. ¶ By the King. ¶ A Proclamation to inhibite the Sale of Latine Bookes reprinted beyond the Seas, hauing been first Printed in Oxford or Cambridge. WHereas, for preuenting the common errors of the Presse, which haue heretofore happened in Printing the Bookes and Workes written in Latine, for the publike aduance∣ment of Religion, and Learning, in Our Vniuersities of Oxford and Cambridge, there hath been for many yeeres a speciall Printer allowed & authorised at either of Our said Vniuersities, that the Authors of those Bookes, being themselues at hand to take care of dieeing the Print, might send forth their Workes in their owne originall purity, with∣out corruptions and blemishes of misprinting; Wee are now informed by the humble Pe∣titions of the Chancellors, Masters, and Students of both Our sayd Vniuersities, That diuers Bookes of that kinde, after they haue been well and carefully first printed heere, in good Paper, and with good Letters, haue been afterwards in the parts beyond the Seas reprinted very erroneous, and sent backe from thence into this Our Kingdome of England, and Dominion of Wales, and vented here as true Copies, at lower Rates, in respect of the basenesse of the Paper and Print, then the Originals here can be afforded; whereby the Authors haue been enforced to disclaime their owne Workes so reprinted, the first Prin∣ters much impouerished, and Our owne people much abused in laying out their Moneys vpon falsified or erroneous Copies: The ill consequence whereof hath not onely discou∣raged many of Our louing Subiects, (good Schollers of both Vniuersities) from pub∣lishing in Print, diuers good and vsefull Bookes of Latine, by them prepared for aduance∣ment of good Letters, and the trueth of Religion; But hath also disabled the Printers to vndertake the charge of the Presse for publishing of the same, till some other course be taken for preuenting the like abuse in time to come.
Wee therefore, out of Our Princely care hereof, as of a matter concerning Our owne ho∣nour, and the publique good of Our Subiects, haue thought fit, (by, and with the aduice of Our Priuie Counsell) by this Our Proclamation, straitly to charge and command, that no person or persons, of what estate, degree, or condition soeuer hee be, doe presume from hence∣foorth to bring into any Our Dominions for sale, or vent, or put to sale, vpon any pretence whatsoeuer, any Latine Authours, Booke or Bookes, printed in any the parts beyond the Seas, which haue been, or shall be formerly and originally printed in either of Our sayd Vniuersities of Oxford or Cambridge, vpon paine of Our high indignation and displeasure, and confiscation of the Bookes so brought ouer, or offered to be put to sale, and of such fur∣ther penalties and punishments, as the contempt of this Our Royall commandement shal be found to demerit: And that no person or persons; vnder the like paines and penalties, doe presume to buy any such Booke or Bookes so reprinted in the parts beyond the Seas, so long as the said Booke or Bookes of the Print of either of Our said Vniuersities shall bee of ordinary sale. And to the end it may appeare what reprinted Bookes Wee intend by this Our Proclamation to prohibite the buying or sale of; Wee doe hereby require and command the Printers of both Our said Vniuersities, within one moneth next comming to cause Cer∣tificate to be made vnder the hands of the Vice-Chancellors of Our said Vniuersities respec∣tiuely, and deliuered to the Master and Wardens of the Company of Stationers London, for the time being, of all such Bookes originally printed at either of Our sayd Vniuersities al∣ready extant, and in ordinary sale; And to cause like monethly Certificate to be made of all such other Bookes, as shall be hereafter from time to time originally printed there. Giuen at Our Court at Saint Iames, the first day of April, in the first yeere of Our Reigne of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland. God saue the King. ¶ Printed at London by Bonham Norton and Iohn Bill, Printers to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. M.DC.XXV.
