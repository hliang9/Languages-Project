THE STONE ROLLED AWAY, AND LIFE more ABƲNDANT. JOHN 14.1, 2. Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Fathers house are ma∣ny Mansions. ROM. 10.17. Faith cometh by hear∣ing;The Intro∣duction. I dare not therefore distrust your attention; So, your hea∣venly Redeemer prepare for each of you a Mansion in his Fa∣thers house, as ever ye believe, that, where His Gospel is preached, there the Power of his Spirit is present to heal. Even so,
Lord Jesus; Time was when theDeut. 32.8. Dew, thePro. 16.21. Sweetness ofPro. 10.32. thy blessed lips, onceCan. 4.11. dropped, oncePsal. 45.2. graced, as well this Text of mine, as other thy Gospels: Oh, that now, (while it is called to day) the Inspirations, the Breathings of thy Holy Spirit, would vouchsafe to sanctifie, would vouchsafe to bless unto us, as well this Discourse of mine, as other thine Ordinances. Beloved,The Method. that the Sun of Righteousness may at this time delight to arise upon us with healing in his wings, it is at this time my Duty, therefore to explain these words, that I may profitably apply them. First,1. The Explica∣tion of the Text. then, Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God: believe also in me. In my Fathers house are many Mansions.The manner how delivered. Words all Gospel, and all Epistle, (I mean) full of Doctrines, and full of Ʋses too; Words full of Passion, and as full of Compassion; spoken to the heart, yea and from the heart too; unexpect∣edly ushered in, and as abruptly uttered forth. Let not your heart be troubled; A Reproof smiting friendly, a Reproof pouring out excellentPsal. 11.5. Oyl though soft & smooth, yet fetcheth out the poyson which lieth in the stomack. B. Reyo'ds in his Rich Mans Charge. p. 7. oyl. Ye believe in God, believe also in me; An Exhortation cloathed with Instruction, cloathed with Evangelical Instructions. In my Fathers house are many Mansions; A Consolation, a strong consolation, a strong consolation far fetched,
fetched even from the highest heavens. Beloved,The Party speaking. ye may know the man from his manner of Communication; Surely, the Hand, nay the Heart of Jesus is in all this? It is so. Compare this verse with that next above; The same Jesus which answereth there, Thou shalt deny me thrice; the same Jesus answereth here, Let not your heart be troubled. The Party speaking we know; Jesus we know;The Persons spoken to. but, Who are ye? (your heart?) Answ. Some Greek Copies prefix , He saith unto his Disciples; Imagine, that Varia lectio Apocryphal, admit it not the Dictate of the Holy Ghost, but the Annotation of some busie Transcriber: Nevertheless more then manifest it is,c. 13.22, 35. who The persons here spoken unto, are: They prove themselves to be Disci∣ples, Disciples of Christ, the chief of the Di∣sciples of Christ, all twelve of them, exceptingc. 13 30. Judas, one not worthy the looking after. The Disciples spoken to, we see; Jesus speaking, The occasion of Christs speak∣ing here.  we hear But, Ʋpon what occasion speaketh he? Answ. S. Chrysostom, and (from him) Theo∣phylact, they, therefore repute these former words one Argument of Christs divine nature, for that, then when his Disciples here stood si∣lent, He, of Himself, perfectly knew the se∣cret troubles of their heart. But (saving the esteem due unto so great Fathers) that Jesus Christ was as well God as man, the latter clause of this versePlscator in locum. better proveth; and, that Jesus knew all things, other Scriptures sufficient∣ly
declare; we need not to discompose this Text. Were no other causes manifest, yet one plain and visible reason, wherefore the hearts of the Disciples should be the less troubled, may beMaldonat. in locum. derived from Christs approaching Resurrection, or rather from his approaching A∣scension. That our Redeemer here looketh quite tho∣rough his Resurrection unto the hour of his ascending, I demonstrate from c. 13.33. from c. 13.1. and from this c. 14.1, 2. 1. From,1 Proof from c. 13.33. Whether I go, ye cannot come. They could drinkMat. 20.23. of Christs bitter cup, could be baptized, could be plunged into aPhil. 3.10. fellowship of his sufferings; but unto the Heavens whither he now went, they could not now come; neither their souls, while they abode in the flesh; nor their bodies, until the general resurrection. 2.2 Proof from c. 13.1. The hour was come wherein Jesus should go not only out of the world, but to the Father. All Di∣vines own a difference between that measure of joy which departed souls now receive, and that consummation of bliss, which they shall finally participate together with their glorified bodies: But some very learned Interpreters critically di∣stinguish between thatVide, sis Grotium in Lu∣cae 23.43. part of Heaven, wherein blessed souls do now abide, and that whereunto (say they) the same souls shall at the time of the Restitution of all things be everlast∣ingly exalted. They tell us, That S. Paul's2 Cor. 12.24. Paradise was inferiour to his third heaven; they affirm, That, during Christs death, Christs soul
was only (as the Jews call it) inLuke 23 43. Paradise; and (as others phrase it). ,Fuit dives quidem  sed sait  etiam Lazarus; nam & Para∣disus, & Ge∣henna, & Ely∣sin, & Taitara sunt . Grot. in Lucae 16.23. in some blest estate, but not in that third heaven where∣unto they yield that Jesus then ascended, when he went unto the Father. For my part, so often as I contemplate the FatherIsa. 57.15. inhabiting the highest heavens, the SonJoh. 14 28. ascending to the Fa∣ther, and S Paul, even at his3 Cor. 5.8. Phil. 1.23. dissolution, reckoning to be present with the Son, I can leave these great Authors sporting themselves,Job 41. Psal. 104.26. Leviathan-like, in their profound depths. Wherefore, I will not urge, that suppose Christ did indeed (Luke 23 43.) content himself with some lower part of heaven, yet he, John 13.1. climbed the highest heavens; no, I leave these Criticks unto their own Paradise. What I insist upon, is, That mention isJoh. 13.1. here made, not barely of Christs Departing out of this world, but expresly also of his going to his Father. JesusIbid. knowing that the hour was come wherein he should depart out of the world unto the Father, hec. 14.1. saith unto his Disciples, Let not your heart be troubled. 3.3 Proof from c. 14.1, 2, 3. That our compassionate Redeemer here eyeth his Ascension, we find within the Suburbs of my Text, while he saith, I go to prepare a place for you. True, Christs burial prepareth a place for us, maketh our graves a bed of rest, strew∣eth thisMrs. Rutter. Saints Bride-bed with roses, sweetneth her Sepulchre with spices: His Grave-cloaths may wellHerbert in his Temple: a Poem which Mrs. R. very much affected. wipe present tears from our eyes: but a blind man may here see, that our blessed Savi∣our
here reporteth himself not unto his going down unto the bowels of the earth, but unto his ascending up unto the Mansions of his Father, viz. Hereafter Christc. 14.3, 30. would not talk much with his Disciples; though he was not yetB. anarows Serm. on John 20.17. ascending, yet aB. anarows Serm. on John 13.33. little while, and he leaveth them; Wherefore, what he hath to say, that heB. anarows Serm. on John 14.2.16.1. speaketh before-hand: I say, so full of bowels are the loving kindnesses of Christ Jesus, that heMaldonat in c. 14.1. anticipateth his Disciples thoughtfulness; although with himself it was not as yet Good Friday, with them he maketh it Ascension day; He leadeth their troubles captive, Let not your heart be troubled. He prepareth for them the gift of Faith, Ye believe in God, believe also in me. He sendeth their thoughts on high, In my Fathers house are many Mansions. I should darken Counsel by words without knowledge,The Troubles spoken of. should I cite Christs determined Ascension as the only reason of this his Dehorta∣tion: whether we examine the subsequent, or preceding, the immediate, or remote Contexts, from all these clearVide, sis Erasm. Tin∣num, Malorat. &c. in locum. it is, That at what time our Saviour now spake, there were visible distracti∣ons; of which, some already did, others short∣ly would macerate these Disciples hearts: If I can guide you through them in mine Applicati∣on, well; loth I am to draw so many troubles upon you at this present. I proceede therefore to the next. The next Consolation is,The remedy proposed. Ye believe in God, believe also in me, .
Some read the former  not indicatively, Ye do believe; but imperatively, Believe ye; thus theM. Trostii praefat. ad N. T.

Ludovic. de Dieu,in locum. Cy∣ril, and others; but, in thus reading, they seem never the more happy Expositers: Such as read two Imperatives, double the command, but weaken the perswasion: Wherefore, with a very filial delight, I adhere to the same Translation which our judicious mother, the Church of England, here recommendeth unto us; She readeth this first , Ye believe; so doth the vulgar Latine; the like do the most, and the best of thoseRupertus, Beda, &c. in lo∣cum.

Now read it, Ye believe, and it bringeth with it, as well a Counsel, as a Command; as well an Instruction, as an Exhortation: quasi, Ye cannot believe in God, except ye believe in me, forAugust n. ubi supra. I am God; Ye believe in God, believe also in me. Ye believe in God, That heZech. 13.7. will smite the Shepherd; Believe also in me, that IIsa. 53.4, Mat. 26.31. am smitten for your Transgressions. Ye believe in God, that heExod. 14. requireth a Paschal Lamb, believe also in me, that I am1 Cor. 5.7. the Passover sacrificed for you. Ye believe in God, that heLuk. 19.10. sent me to save; believe also in me, that I amHeb. 7.25. able to save to the uttermost.
These Glosses are wholesome Truths, but wide of our Saviours Scope; they seem somewhat forced; natural they are not: Wheither ye abide v. 1. by the troubles; or whether ye step forward v. 2. to the Mansions; obvious it is, That, what Instruction is here given, is givenGorran. Be∣za, Jansen. &c. in locum. by way of consolation and supporrt, both from the nature of Faith, v. 1. and from the certainty of the reward, v. 2. quasi, Ye believe in God that heIsa 55.7. can abundantly pardon; believe also in me, that I1 Joh. 1.9. am faithful and just to forgive you your sins.

But here fall in divers Questions, several lit∣tle Stumbling-stones, which I would willingly roll away. Quest. If Mansions were now to be prepared,Dub. how sped the spirits of just men departed before this time? Answ.Solut. August. ibid. Heinsius in loc. The spirits of just men departed before Christs time, had their places preparted for them by vertue of Christs future prepara∣tion. Christ thereunto predestinated undertook for the security of Gods ElectMat. 25.34. before all worlds: And, what he undertook, that his Fa∣therIsa. 49.8. reputed as good as done; say Maldo∣nat what he please on Mat. 3.2. Quest.Dub. Why (of all times) must Christ go to prepare a place, now? Answ. Ever, Gods time is, of all times,Solut. the best: As there was a Fulness of time, wherein theGal. 4.4. Son of man should be made of a wo∣man: so there was a Fulness of time, wherein He, being made of a woman, should prepare a place for us; the fulness of which time now was; now was the appointed season. Quest. What needed any such preparation at all?Dub. Solut. Answ. Adam, by his sin, hadPerkins on the Creed. shut him∣self, and in himself us, much more out of the
Paradise of Heaven, then out of the Paradise of Eden. Quest.Dub. By what course did Christ prepare for us these Mansions? Answ.Solut. First, By way of purchase; next, by way of possession. First, By way of purchase: For his own part, The Son of God, being the Father of Hea∣vensJohn 1 14. only begotten, hathGal. 4.7. a right unto these Mansions, as he isHeb. 1.2. Heir of all things: But, as for us, our sins are aIsa. 59.2. wall of separa∣tion between us and our God: Wherefore, the Son of man dying, placeth himself as a door of hope within that wall. There were indeed Che∣rubims (terrible withJunius in Gen. 3.24. fire and sword) placed against us before Paradise; but, God hath by Christ, called back those Cherubims, and hath, in their stead, placed notJoh. 20.12. ar∣med, but gowned Angels, having not swords glit∣tering like fire, but the white colours of peace, and of free admission. Thus Christ, by his wounds, setteth wide open theHeb. 10.19. great gates of his Fathers house: When he overcame the sharpness of death, he opened the kingdom of Heaven to all Be∣lievers. Secondly, By way of Possession: even in this sense, by Christs fleshHeb. 10.20. is consecrated a way for us: His body, which theAct. 3.21. heavens receive, taketh Livery and SeizinHeb. 9.24. for us. Christ ascending, ascendeth, asPhil. 2 9. for himself, soHeb. 6.20. for us: In conceipt, weEph. 2.6. already sit together with him in heavenly places: Had
these Disciples, with thatLuk. 23.42. Saint-Thief, petioned Christ, Lord remember us when thou comest into thy kingdom; Christ might then have replied; Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me; In my Fathers house are many Mansions. . Quest. House? Mansions? many Mansions?Dub. Hitherto our Saviour spake plainly,Tota haec O∣ratio est parabo∣lica. Beza. Solut. why speak∣eth he now in Parables? Answ. This wise Master-builder will leave no stone unmoved: Where Elegancies may prevail, heHos. 12.10. spareth no Rhetorique. Of the Disciples here spoken to, the three chief, Peter, James and John found it good, being there where Christ was transfigured: so were they transported, that Peter would fain have built there three Tabernacles: Possibly, Christ here intimateth, that he would now prepare for them, not Tabernacles, but Mansions; not on mountMat. 17.1. in quem locum vide, sis, S. Hie∣ron. & Bedam. Tabor, but in his Fathers house. The Applicati∣on of the Text. WHether that Mount wereVideas Ti∣rinum in Mat. 17.1. Mount Tabor, Peculiar unto the Ministers of the Gospel. or whether the Lord Jesus doth here allude unto his Transfiguration upon that Mount, I need not to dispute, now: neither
need I to open unto you more of these Mansions, until I have first led you unto my Fathers house. It sufficeth, for the present, that placed with Moses upon Mount Nebo, we have gained a sight of the promised Rest; especially, seeing these few words do already multiply upon our atten∣tion; and [seeing they do already] grow up∣on us as exceedingPsal. 119.96. broad. Every sentence (here) is a Tree of life; every Tree of life (here,) hath several branches; every branch (here,) beareth much fruit, fruit which may abound unto your accompt. He is no good Oratour, who over-much raiseth expectation; but I (who am no Oratour) cannot raise your expectation enough. Chapter 10. Verse 10. Christ came that we might Have Life, and that we might have it more abundantly; just so he cometh in this begin∣ning of this 14th. Chapter. Luke 24.2. They found the stone rolled away from the Sepulchre; Christ, here rolleth away every stone. Whether Clergy, or Laity, we do every of us, (here) re∣ceive a Benjamins portion. Wherefore, that both Priest and People may, asSr. Edward Turner in his May 19. 1662. speech, p. 6. one ad∣viseth, like well squared stones in a well built Arch, each support the other, and grow closer and stronger thorough the weighty duties which God layeth upon us; I shall begin with our selves, the Ministers of Christ, that we may from Christ Jesus, the more effectually speak un∣to you the people of God. First,Observ. from the circum∣stance of the time. then, If there be in these our Duties, amidst our holy Function, any prophane Hophni,
any that lightly esteem God, any that feed them∣selves, and not their Flock; any too fat to be laborious; any studious more to gain Revenues and Dignities, then the souls committed unto their charge: As this Text soweth no Pillow un∣der such Elbows, so it wholly removeth their scandal from our present age and Church: For, even those very persons which are upon all occasions so forward to catch up every stone of offence against us, even they themselves can∣not say, as St. PaulSee Dr. Airay upon Phil. 2.21. did, All seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christs: If some do, a sore evil it is, but no new evil under the Sun: as in bodies Politique, so in Churches Militant; Perfection cannot reasonably be expected; Where much Wheat is, Tares there will be: Among many Labourers, some will wax idle: The Temple at Jerusalem could never be so ex∣actly repaired, but that some part of it or other would ever be amiss; Nor is Holiness inherent to the Levite: OneNum. 25.11. Phinehas is seldom so good, butSam. 4.4.2.17, 22. another is as bad. At this ve∣ry time, wherein Jesus now spake, as he had v. 22. his Judas Thaddeus, so he had c, 13.26. his JudasJohn 6.70. Iscariot too. 2. A second Stone is removed by the manner whereafter, the order wherein,Obser from the the manner, order and mat∣ter of the words. the matter whereof, the Wisdom of the Father doth here speak. 1. As I told you, what is here uttered, is delivered feelingly and pathetically: What pro∣ceedeth from Him, proceedeth as well from the
flowings of his love, as from the openings of his lips. 2. The Order of the words, maketh things tem∣poral, an occasion unto things spiritual; leadeth from Nature to Grace; from reason in the heart, to Faith in Christ; from troubles in the world, to Mansions in Heaven; bringeth us from out∣ward troubles, to inward duties; from inward duties, to the recompence of the reward; guideth us, through a world of troubles, into a kingdom of Grace; from a kingdom of Grace, unto a Crown of Glory. 3. The Matter here spoken of, is not some barren needless Punctilium, but matter worthy him that preacheth, viz. the great concernments of the soul; the property, and efficacy of faith; the means and certainty of Salvation. Which three circumstances twisted into one example, fully separate between the profitable, and unprofitable Teacher: For, while on the left hand, they explode that sleight of Oratory, which rejecteth Christs, but admirethStultissi∣mum credo ad imitandum non optima quae que proponere. Piin. lib. 1. E∣pist. 5. mans wisdom; on the right, they approve that whole∣some method which imitateth not man Inven∣tion, but Christs pattern, viz. On the right hand, this commendeth that great part of our English Clergy, which are in∣deed Stewards of the Mysteries of God; Stewards, as faithful, as able; Lights, as well burning, as shining; meek, lowly, gentle, patient, of a dove-like innocency, and of a willing compli∣ance; yet valiant for the Truth, zealous of good
works, bold to preach the Gospel1 Thes. 2.2. , and very zealous for their Lord of Hosts. In these, the Word dwelleth richly, and in all wisdom too; especially in thatProv. 11.30. choice Wis∣dom which winneth souls; TheseProv. 15.2. use their knowledge aright: exceeding learned they are, and are (because they are exceeding learned) mighty in the Scriptures. When these speak, they so speak as the Oracles of their God; when these minister, they so minister as of the ability which God giveth. Beloved, by the Word thus preached, what people upon earth is exalted so near heaven, as our Island is? What Nation under heaven can muster up so many Watchmen, which cry aloud, and spare not; so many Chari∣ots and Horsemen of Israel which fight the Lords battles, as England can? Blessed, yea blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ forO si vide∣am in vita mea ecclesiam talibus nixam columnis! O si Domini sponsam cerne∣rem tantae com∣missam fi, tan∣tae ce litam pu∣ritati quid me beatius? quid ve securius?

Copy of the Law is written upon these stones: These we erect, as aJosh 4.7. Memorial be∣fore the Lord for ever: Behold, These shallJosh 24.27. witness unto us, lest we deny the Lord. On the other hand, For Zions sake, I will not hold my peace: Alas, I cannot chuse but stum∣ble at too many, even of our English Divines, who make it their utmost endeavour, to preach, learnedly indeed, but, not unto Edification: ShouldJob 15 2, 3. a wise man utter vain knowledge? Should he reason with unprofitable Talk? or with
speech that can do no good? Away then, with that manner of preaching, which contriveth more to repeat Authours, or to boast languages, then to edifie souls. The Son of God abhorred Af∣fectation of Literature, yet spakeMat. 7.29. John 7.15. . He could have spoken with tongues more then us all, yet never did he make himself a1 Cor. 14.11, 19. Barbarian: He sought not to amuse, but to awaken. Away also, with that sort of preaching, whichId habent curae non quo∣modo Scriptu∣rarum medullas ebibant, sed quo∣modo aures po∣puli Declamato∣rum flosculis mulceant. S. Hieron. aimeth more to imitate an Oration of Tully, then a Narration of Christs. Away, away with these quaint modish Discourses, they have in them neitherJohn 6.63. spirit, nor life: Ser∣mons yield but1 Cor. 13.1. harsh Musique to the ear, if they afford neither method for the memorie, nor matter for the thirsty soul; nor do they ever make less impression upon the heart, then when they are delivered1 Cor. 2, 1.

All Scripture is2 Tim. 3.16. profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, &c. but there is a new found Rhetorique, now adaies, which stoop∣eth not so low as these. It is now the great Industry of many excellent Schollars, to wave the Demonstration of the Spirit, and to place their whole stress upon mans wisdom: I speak this toImperitis∣sim est scientia scire quid sens∣rint Philosophi, & nescire quid docuit Chrisius.

Or, is this Prudence, to exalt Rhetorick your hand-maid, above1 Cor. 2.5. Divinity her Mistress? yea, Is it good manners in you, to prefer your Mother-wit, before the sacred wisdom of God?

Honesty in you, to conceal your Gods praises, and to bespeak your own? Unto you, whoJoh. 5.42. had rather be reputed learned then religious, I speak: In this Text our Master ofJoh. 7.15, 42. eloquence, doth not so much mind his phrase, that he forgetteth his Auditors; He delivereth no airy stuff, but heavenly Truths; His endeavour is, not toPraeceptis Christi detrahit pondus Sacerdo∣tum levitas.

What shall I more say? Christ was aJoh. 1.18.3.2, 13. Teacher sent from God, and almost every word of his hath the efficacy of a coercive application; Behold, he hath given you anTanto ma∣jorem apud do∣ctos habere gra∣tiam debet, quanto mino em apud indoctos hab t. example: May, therefore, what was unto me a stumbling block, be unto you, betwixt you and your Jesus, as that Pillar was between Jacob and Laban, viz. a Mizpah, aGen. 31.45. Watch-tower: May your zeal, like Elijahs fire from the Lord, consume this1 King. 18.38. wood, this dust, this stone, this wooden
stuff, this dustie trash, this stone of Offence; so God, who is a consuming fire; God, who pardon∣eth the Iniquity of our holy things, will accept your sacrifice, as he did Elijahs, Fathers and Bre∣thren, let us be guided by this wise Master-buil∣der, let us imitate the workmanship of this preci∣ous, this chief Corner-stone, this Head-stone of us all; so shall we grow up not only as polished cor∣ners of His Temple, but also, as the supporting Pillars of his glorious Church. In the next place, for so much as the birds round about her,Observ. from the persons spoken to. are against theJer. 12.9. speckled bird; since every Jew will have a flingJoh. 8.59. at Jesus; because most persons stumble most at theJoh. 16.2.

Hos. 6.7. they cannot chuse but err like men, and may as soon shake off their dust, as their sinfulness: First then, If instead of double honour, we meet with undeserved contempt; if our Failings, if those infirmities of ours which humble our spi∣rits,
encourage any unadvised ones to become our accusers, the persons here spoken to may frame our replies. 1.I. Reply. Seeing the Purity of the Gospel requireth cleanJob 17.9. Psal. 24.4. 1.

Rom. 2.1. hearts too; since Pastors more especially should be examples unto Believers, since Holiness becometh Gods house for ever; far be it from us, to despise the admonitions of any sin∣cere Christian; Let not our heart be troubled for such benefits: but, if when our foot slippeth, ye magnifie your selves against us, ye do not well: Jesus Christ would not allow his Disciples frail∣ty to be a grief of heart unto them; and dare any of you delight to see our hearts troubled?

Our thoughts (for ought that ye know) save your tongues the labor: A Father telleth you,S. Chryso∣stom. Hom. 5. in 2. Tim. That it is impossible that the heart of him who continually receiveth the words of the heavenly Doctrine, should not be affected; I will not say it is impossible, but I am sure, it isPsal. 19.7. improbable.

us, it is (in us who daily consult the Scriptures) a daily, a repeated quenching of the Spirit. It is monstrous in a man of God, to give place unto the Devil. Can we supplicate for you, and forget that we our selves areGen. 18.27. Dum alium steo, meipsum desteo. Ambros. dust and ashes? Our consciences would be very much seared, should weRom. 2.1. complain of your faultiness, and cherish our own. The more we do search the holy Scriptures, the more we doRom. 7.9. prie into our own lives; I say, the better we think of the Law of God, the worse we think of our selves. Gospel-light helpeth us to see many a mote in ourMat. 5.29. 2 Cor. 4.6.10.5. right eye; then we make a progess in our studies, when the fear of the LordDeut. 17.19.

St. James was a second of these Apostles, he concealeth not that he sinned, and that tooJames 3.2. in many things. Nor fell these confessions from a levity of brain, but from an inward conviction of guilt: For instance, ye see a third of these Disciples bursting into tears at theLuke 22.61. very first look: he was the chief of the
eleven here spoken unto; and when Christ had onceLuke 5.8. revealed his power unto him, he stood off at a distance; prostrate, because snful. Ye, therefore, among all our Congregations, whoJoh. 8.7. take up the first stone against us, may do as our GodMc. 7.19. doth, ye mayJer. 51.63. cast your Book of Remembrance into the midst of Eu∣phrates. 3.III. Reply. It is not for you,Exod. 20.12. but for our God, and our Rulers to number our steps: To our own Masters we stand or fall. Be not manyJames 3.1. Ma∣sters, my Brethren; or, if yeJames 4.11, 12. will be our Judges, consider the Race that is set before us: if ye will needs weigh us, weigh us in an even ballance, take theGal. 6.1, 2. ballance of the Sanctu∣ary; give untoLam. 4.2. sons of Zion the allowance due to gold; compare our burden with your own; and if our duties be both greater, and more then (are) yours, can you blame us if our failings be so too? Examine dutiesPhil. 2.12, 15. 2 Pet. 1.10. personal; Is each of you bound to search out his fall in Adam? To pass from the death of nature to the life of grace; to grow in that grace, and in the knowledge of God? so is each of us: compareJam. 2.8. family and neighbourly offices, still ours are the same with yours, and more. Proceed now unto our distinct Vocations, we have here more, much1 Tim. 3.2, 14.6.10. 2 Tim. 6.8, v. 13, 14, c. 2.3, 4. v. 15, 22, v 24, 25. Tit. 1.6, 9.2.1, 8. 1 Cor. 9 22. more weight upon our shoulders then have ye: Our perso∣nal and relative Obligations match yours, and (as ours) overmatch yours; but the Obedi∣ences due from our Callings transcendeth what
is due from yours, and that by far: Ever, as is the Employment which is enjoyned, such is the Duty: By how much more publick our vocation is then is yours, by so much more extensive is our duty; and, by how much more sacred our Calling is then is yours, by so much the greater is the Task upon us incumbent. Consider, then, if your obediences be more then ye can per∣form; if your duties, your burdens be more then ye can weild, (and more then ye can weild they are) who is2 Cor. 2.16. sufficient for these of ours? You see now, that the persons her spoken to, must be allowed their failings, not only as men, but as Believers; not only as Believers, but as Disci∣ples; they are subjects, not of your Obloquie, but of your Compassion. Fitly are they, fitly are such as succeed them, comparedGal. 2 9. unto Pillars of the Church, since upon their narrow shoulders so great a part of Christs spiritu∣al building, as a heavy burden, is weightily placed. 4.IV. Reply. It is not so much our failing, as your obser∣vation: As we are more tasked, so we are more exposed to censure: I see more eyes upon this one Pulpit, then upon all the other Seats in this Church: As theMat. 5.14.

Levites linnen, else had the Levite seemed as spotless, as one of another Tribe. In his sufferings, hundreds of other followers de∣serted Christ; of them the Gospel is silent; it is not silent of the persons spoken to in my Text: The persons here spoken to, are chief Disciples, chosen Apostles; wherefore of their haltings, the Con∣text is full; It is noted of them, that hitherto, theyMat. 16.22. Took not up their cross; could notMat. 26.31, 40. watch with Christ one hour; mindedMat. 20.21. Mark 9.34. Luke 22.24. earthly things; hadMat. 16.8. Mark 9.34. very little faith; wereMat. 8.38. Mat. 26.74. ashamed, andMark 14.50. Rev. 21.8. afraid to own either Christ crucified, orGal. 2.12. the purity of His Gospel, nor, as yet, knew theyMark 9.32. John 20.9. V. Reply. the Scriptures. But herein alas, herein lieth the difference; That, these Apostles failings are so much noted, is the good∣ness of Gods spirit: That, our failings are so much noted, is the wickedness of mans Spi∣rit, But, Let not your heart be troubled, the thing is of God; It is forRom. 8.28. your sake, that God permitteth our sins toAct. 14.15. equal, if not to ex∣ceed

Gal. 2.19. not Angels, but men: The holy Ghost giveth unto you that1 Cor. 12.28. Ephes. 4.11. sort of gift, which is best for your profit. When Christ prayed that Peters fath. St. Chrysost in Lucae 22 32. might not fail him, he would not pray that PetersJohn 18.27. heart might not fail him. He could have made these Disciples here spoken to as Self-denying, as stout, as stedfast, as full of knowledge, as full of holiness, before his A∣scension, as after his Ascension, they were: he could so; but this (he knew) suited neither with his Spouses benefit, nor with his own1 Cor. 1.27. wisdom. Let this suffice you; That, whether he use SilverNumb. 10. Trumpets, or RamsJosh. 6.13. compared with 2 Sam. 5.24. horns, the Captain of your Salvation will bring forth Judgement unto Victory:Mat. 12.20. Phil. 1 6.

Insufficiencies notwith∣standing, he made them theMark 9.50. Salt of the earth, theMat. 5.14. light of the world, witnesses of1 John 1.1, 2, 3. saving truths, andJohn 15.16. chosen Disciples, &c. Why this? Answ. His glory he would not give unto others. He who revealeth his power in mans weakness, will have the glory of his grace ascribed, by you, not unto his (frail) Ministers, but unto Himself alone: Hence it was, that (as simple as they were) these very persons, heMat. 10.5. sent to publish the Gospel; these very persons,Luke 6.13. he ordained to be His Apostles and Embassadors.
6. Lastly,VI. Reply. BelieversLike Nico∣stratus in Aelian. have another eye to view such Pictures with, then disquiet spirits have. In this Text, very faulty our persons spoken unto are; their hearts are overcharged with care, they have little or no Faith in Christ, they sin against heaven; nevertheless, their Master (you see) harbourethCompare John 13.38. with Luke 22.16. and Mar. 16.7. against them no discontents, forgiveth all, maketh the best of all; yea, he here preventeth their trouble: He doth not despise, but pity; not reject, but assist their persons. So many of you as are followers of Christ, like dear Children, Let the sameEâ que n∣que ansâ pre∣hendas quâ commodè teneri potest. Epicte∣tus. mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus. If we your Ministers err like men, that is, like these Apostles, let this stir up in you, not your corruptions, but your Graces: Ye will not (therefore) dash your feet againstMat. 16.18. these stones. Happily, we your Ministers are there∣fore permitted to follow these persons, here spoken to, in their defects, that ye, our Congre∣gations, may have the praise of imitating the person here speaking, in His perfections: With joy may we drawIsa. 12.3. waters from these Wells of salvation, if ye thus roll away the stone from yourZech. 13.1. fountainsJer. 15.19.2.

shall never want for such as, unawares to themselves, second the gain-sayings of Corah. Let our Clergy mourn, or pipe, fast with the Baptist, or feast with their Lord, yet still as theIsa. 8.14. Master himself abideth a rock of offence to every unregenerate person, so abideth his Mini∣ster too. Before the Repairer of our breach hadSee Dr. Washburn his 1661. May 29. Serm. upon Isa. 58.12. prosperously disappointed them who took the Houses of God into their possession, the rock of offence then was, that the consecrated Le∣vite was, (and alas he was) made the very Off-scouring of his people. Now that great Mountain cannot stand before our Zerubbabel; the prejudice, the scandal now taken is, that the self same Levite is no longer continued the Scum and Off-scouring of his people, that is, theMal. 3.9. Deut. 12.19. Reproach and Guilt of his brethren. He is now envied as too great, or too rich, or both. Might some men prevail, the person here speak∣ing in this Text, should have been neither Mel∣chizedec, nor the son of David; no King of the Jews by birth, nor High-Priest by Calling: nor should his immediate servants, his immediate successors in the work of his Ministry, have re∣ceived either Dignity or Revenue: whereas, that ineffable felicity which we do all of us partake from our Head Christ Jesus, who (so often as he pleased) did (in the days of his flesh) in all holiness and wisdom exercise the power to him committed, may seem (unto me at least) to justifie unto the Ministers of his Gospel both Dignities and Revenues.
First, I see this holy Jesus, blessed for ever,1. In Dignities. anointed in the days of his fleshPsal. 45.7. above his fellows; yet, not ashamed to call them brethren: I see him owning aJoh. 10.16. Plurality; but, it is for the benefit of his Church: I see him receivingMat. 2.11.21.5. Homage, Presents and Triumphs, yet still he ceas∣eth not to deny himself: I see himHeb. 8.6. dignified, nayJoh. 13.31. glorified, mean while he taketh up his Cross; all power wasMat. 2.2.28.18. committed unto him; nevertheless, He so usedJoh. 18.36. Luke 9.58. this world, as though he used it not: AnHeb. 3.1. 1 Pet. 2.25. Arch, Bishop he is, and blessed be God, that he is such. A Rabbi heJoh. 1.38 was, and, therefore, aJoh. 3.2. Rabbi, because a Teacher sent from God; They called himJoh. 13.13. Lord, Lord; but, so far was he from lording it over Gods Inheritance, that (I advise you) learn of him, for he is meek. Ye see now that, a Samuel, a Jehoiadah, a Jesus, may be a good Priest; yet, a good Ruler too. Ye perceive, that, let a Preacher of Righteousness keep close unto theIn ea re∣gula incedimus, quam Ecclesia ab Apostolis, Apostoli à Chri∣sto, Christus à Deo accepit. Tertul. de Praes. c. 37. example of Christ Jesus, and make him rich, make him great, give him a Plurality, make him a Doctor, make him a Prelate, make him a Bishop, make him a Lord, Bishop, make him a Lord, Arch, Bishop, yet still the zeal of Gods house eateth him up. His feet still not only con∣tinue, but, appear beautiful upon the mountains; and He himself not only appeareth, but continueth a Pastour according untoProv. 22.11. his King, yea ac∣cording unto hisJer. 3.15.

Secondly,2. In Revenues. I need not entitle the person or persons in my Text, unto Church-Revenues; (where) methinketh they defend themselves, and have (methinketh) warrant so to do. 1. First, From the light of Nature. Ask a Heathen what heVideas quae Selden de Dits Syris Syatag. 1. c. 4 &c. 6. Syn∣tag 2. c. 17. Vi∣deas & Dan. 3. 1. Hos. 2.8.

Law of Moses; for my part, I cannot conceive that God, who requireth Faith, Purity and Sincerity as well under theIsa. 1.11. Law, as under the Gospel; God, whose Spirit and Truth is opposed, notMede on John 4.23. unto the Beauty, but2 Cor. 3 8, 11. unto the Ceremony of Levitical Rites; I say, I cannot conceive, that this wise God, who was so sumptuous in theHeb. 10.1. shadow, will have the substance lessGen. 14.20 2 Chro. 29.31. costly. Take (in the third place) Examples of good men; He harpeth on another string then2 Sam 7.2.24.24. 1 Kin. c. 5. c 6. c. 7. would David, he maketh himself wiser then was Solomon; who esteemeth any part of this worlds wealth, too excellent for Gods Temple. Fourthly, From EvangelicalIsa. 61.6. 60 6, 7, 9. Deut. 33.19. compared with Mat. 4.15.

1. As sufferers: We, while we preach, the truth of the Gospel, are, many ways, sufferers: our names suffer, our quiet suffereth, our estate suffereth, our health suffereth, &c. first, the haters of God speak evil of us, because we, as in duty bound, convince them of evil; we gall their consciences, and theyPraedicare nihil aliud est quam derivare in se furorem mundi. Luther. Rom 15.3. 2 Cor. 12.15. smite us with the tongue: secondly, since we cannot speak peace to their sins, they2 Chron. 36.16. endeavour our trouble: thirdly, while ye honestly set out our mainte∣nance, sons of Belial will rather rob God, then spare usChi. pota il tor cio, haesempre per costume a se far ombra & agli altri lume. Torriano. 2 Cor. 12.15. our own; and of what they steal not from us, little improvement can we make; yea, well is it, if, while we are wasting our selves in our duties, none of our servants waste our childrens bread: fourthly, where diseases are contagious, and that contagion is not yet dis∣covered, who visiteth the sick, and burieth the dead, seldom escapeth infection: how∣everStudy is a staff of cotton. ibid.

In stead of enjoying the sweets of some pleasant garden, the Chirurgeon tieth himself up unto his patients wound; dres∣seth bruises deep and putrified; sores, enough (one would think) at once, to affright, and poi∣son him; in this Chirurgeon ye regard, not only his art, but, his patience.

Omitting, then, what we suffer in our name, peace, wealth, and health, is any revenue or honour a suitable re∣quital for these our frequent, alas, our constant discomforts? If ye (Parents) have in your hearts any bowels of pity, over one childes ricated consumption, anothers angry blaines, a thirds bruised limbes, a fourth burnt in your fire, or other like calamities (from which God fore∣fend); ye have (then) a little turning, a little
of the melting of our bowels; a little taste of our inward bleedings; ye will (then) see us in the same Positure, as was the sister of that forlorn Moses, Exod. 2, 4 or, as was Hagar when she had eys, able to weep, but, not able toGen. 21.16. see the perishing of Ishmael; yea, in the same Positure as was Rachel, then, when she therefore wept for her Children, because theyJer. 31.15. were not. Beloved, He that could have with-heldProv. 31.6. wine from either Hagar or Rachel, deserved little him∣self: either take from us these waters of affliction, else, mix with these waters some wine of glad∣ness. Lay ye aside the hardness of your hearts, we will then be content to make Brick without Straw. Affright us no more with frequent Symp∣tomes of your everlasting death, and then debar us of what worldly shelters our earthly Taber∣nacles may justly demand; either preserve your precious souls from being lost, or grudge not our bodies the melancholick comfort of a mourning weed: But if our trembling hearts, therefore, die daily, because ye daily neglect to escape death, afford us (we beseech you) some of your weak Julips, for Cordials ye can give us none. Since we must suffer heaviness, because some of you repent not of your unbelief, allow us that liber∣ty, which was not denied unto the persons in my Text; The person here speaking was a manCompare Mat. 26.36. and Joh. 18.1. with Luke 22.39. of sorrows, ye, therefore, sometimes find him inIbid. a Garden of pleasures: Cause enough heCompare Mat. 13.34.19.41. Mat. 23.37. had to weep over Jerusalem; repine not if
heCompare Mat. 21.7. Luke 19.37. compared with Judg. 5.10. ride to it, asIbid. honourably as he can: Since thePsal. 69.9. Reproaches of his God fell so often upon him, blame him not, if heMat. 21.9. accept of Hosannas; since he dothLuke 22.15. not refuse to be crucified uponLuke 23.33. one Mount, grudge not to see himMat. 17.1, 2. transfigured upon another; if he disdain not aLuke 2.12. Manger, spare him your presents. As for the Persons here spoken to, they are likewise spoken to in the tenth Chapter of St. Mark; where for what they suffer in verse 29, they receive a hundred fold in verse 30.(21) Mat. 2.11. I con∣clude then, so long as the yerning of our bow∣els beggeth of you, Believe in God, believe in Christ; In your Fathers house are many Mansions: So long your Equity, if not your Bounty, will treat us, Let not your heart be troubled. 2. If our necessary Supplies part from you with an Evil Will, we then address our selves unto you all, not only as Sufferers through your default, but, as Messengers of your peace, viz. For so much as the Tidings which we bring are glad. Tidings, the just Lord hathLuke 10.7. Gal. 6 6. ordained, that we should live not upon the Courtesie, but upon the Duty of Christians; not upon their arbitrary Collation, but upon a Reward unto our Heavenly Message. The Lord of Hosts, that is, thePsal 84.1.68.24.134.1.

Salvation, his Reward was with him, as for us, so for Himself; and that not only when he ascended up on high, but likewise, when he rode into the holy City withMat. 21.7. Triumph. As for the Persons here spoken to, since they also published the Gospel, let St. Paul alone to1 Cor. 9.4, 5. plead their right. It is folly to expect Esteem from them who understand not Vertue; therefore un∣to the righteous man is PraisePsal. 111.10. 1 Pet. 2.14. assigned by his God; It is in vain for Evangelists to expect large gratuities from them who cherish a heart of un∣belief; therefore, God himselfGal 6.6. steppeth in, and allotteth unto these Messengers of his, () A1 Cor. 9.14. suitable Recompence, even, a1 Tim. 5.17. Double maintenance or Honour. If then the Revenues of our Church have been, either for. merly, or, of later days, an eye-sore unto any of you; if your Eye hath been evil, because your Lord and Masters eye is good; If any of you ex∣postulate, what need of all this cost? ye will no more be so heedless as to stumble at this stone;

Be it that they grudge not at your Reve∣nues, yet well may we stumble at your Hierarchy; For in what part of all the Holy Scriptures do we read of Arch-Bishops, Deans, Prebendaries, Arch-Deacons and Sim; set to lord it over Gods inheri∣tance? 1.1. Answ. Answ. If any that should rule well, do1 Pet. 5.3. over-rule, that blame lieth, not upon the Hie∣rarchy, but, upon the persons. 2.2. Answer. Answ. As for the Prince in whose favour the Hierarchy of EnglandProv. 19.12. findeth life, see∣ing he is The Vice-Gerent of the person speaking in my Text; He is (ye know) a Supreme Gover∣nour over all persons among us; as well over persons Ecclesiastical, as over persons Civil: If then, His sacred Majesties Royal Favour vouch∣safeth to extend it self, as well unto his Clergy, as, unto his Laity: Do not ye (I beseech you) clip the Kings Prerogative; neither let your eyes be evil, because his gratious Majesties are good. 3.3. Answer. Answ. As for the Names or Titles where∣with our most Reverend Arch-Bishops, our Reve∣rend Deans, Prebendaries, Arch-Deacons and Sim. are dignified, I suppose thou wilt not stum∣ble at them, until thou canst first produce out of Scripture, the honourable Titles of Lord chief
Justice, Serjeant at Law, Bencher, Barrister, At∣tornie, Solicitour, &c. 4. Answ.(1) Answer. As for the Legality of their Con∣stitution, there is the same Law of the Land for their Authority, as there is for the excellent Magistracy of this Realm: Now, If thou1 James 4 11. judgest the Law, thou art not a doer of the Law, but a Judge. Object. No part of the Laws of our Land,Object. ought to be contrary unto the Laws of our God. Answ.Answer. If any part of the Laws of our Land opposeth the Word of God, I humbly, I ear∣nesty wish it were repealed; for, of right, our Law-givers can2 Cor. 13.8. do nothing against the truth, but for the Truth: But, as for that part of our En∣glish Laws which establisheth Hierarchy, it in no wise opposeth the Holy Scriptures. Object.Object. It opposeth the Holy Scriptures in constituting an Hierarchy not enjoyned by Gods Words. Answ. Hierarchy is enjoyned by Gods Word,Answer. as it is an1 Pet. 2.13. Ordinance of man; viz. Our Law∣givers are themselves immediatelyProv. 8.15. Rom. 13.1, 2. Revel. 1.5. ordained of God; and, being ordained of God, they have an1 Pet. 2.14. Exod. 18. v. 23. compated with v. 24. Authority and Warrant, from Scripture, to ordain subordinate Powers. Object.Object. Holy Scriptures give us examples of sub∣ordinate powers among Magistrates asExod. 18.25. and Sim. Magi∣strates; but they give unto us no such Examples of subordinate powers among Ministers, as Mini∣sters. Answ.Answer. As holy Scriptures mention subordi∣nate
powers among the Magistrates under Mo∣ses and his Successors; so they do alsoExod. 28.1. Numb 18.2.3.6, 33. mention subordinate powers among the Levites under Aaron and his Successors. Object.Object. The subordinate power among those Le∣vites was by vertue of GodsIbid. express Com∣mand. Answ.Answer. So wereExod. 18.23. the subordinate powers among those Magistrates. Object.Object. Although in the old Testament, God ap∣pointed a Hierarchy among the Levites; In the new Testament, Christ appointed no such Hierarchy among his Ministers. 1.1. Answer. Answ. Although in the Old Testament God appointed aDeut. 17.15. Exod. 18.25. Josh. 1.2. 1 Sam. 10.15. 2 Sam. 7.13. Model of Magistracy for his people; yet in the new Testament Christ ap∣pointeth no such Model of Magistracy for them that shall believe his Gospel. 2. Answ. As the Model of our English Ma∣gistracy is acknowledged and provedProv. 8.15. Rom. 13.1, 2. 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. Rev. 1.5. law∣ful, though there be no Model of any Magistra∣cy at all in the New Testament, nor the same Model in the old Testament, as is in this, or in any other Kingdom under Heaven: So, the Model of our English Hierarchy may be proved lawfull, though there be no such Model of Hierarchy in the New Testament, &c.

While I commend unto thee these or other Books, better then these, wilt thou reply, Such Authors are therefore useless, because the ho∣ly Scriptures are able to make thee2 Tim. 3.15. wise unto Salvation? I trow not: Thou wilt rather say, These (or the like works) are therefore beneficial, because theyEccles. 12.11. consent unto the Truth of the holy Scriptures: Just so, must I answer thee. The Word of God giveth gene∣ral RulesRom. 13.1, 2. As at first God himself im ne∣diately, Exod. 33.14, 15, 16. 1 Sim. c. 8.7.12.12. ruled his people, so at first Christ also himself immediately ruled his peo∣ple, but after∣ward entrusted their Govern∣ment with Kings, and Ru∣lers successive∣ly, as God, had formerly done. for the well ordering of Gods chosen people; Now, while our Parliamentary Statutes do, in our State Affairs, establish among us at King as Supreme Head in all Causes temporal, and a Magistracy under that King; A King, as Supreme in all Causes spiritual, and a Hierar∣chy under that King; These our Paliamentary Statutes do manifestly prove beneficial unto the Churches of God, while they make particular Applications of Gods general Rules. 2.2. Answer. Answ. Suppose beforeJohn 13.13. Mat. 10.1. Luke 10.1. Christ ascend∣ed from earth to Heaven, He, his Twelve Apo∣stles, and his Seventy Disciples were, in that In∣fancy (that new-birth) of the Church, a suffi∣cient number of Church Governours: yet, as the Church encreased in the number of Believers after Christs Ascension; might not, after Christ ascended, other Church Governours be introduced consonant and subservient to these? 3.3. Answer. Answ. Certainly, as inDeu. 17.15 Ruth. 1.1. 1 Sam. 12.13. Kingdoms and in Common-wealths, soIsa. 49.23. Rom. 13.6. compared with Mat. 28.20. in Churches, such may be the form of Government; as the Law∣giver, for the time being, shall see most ex∣pedient
for the propagation of the Gospel. Christ hath1 Sam. 2.28 2 Cor. 3.61.6.4 his Ministery, and his Mi∣nistry hathMat. 16.19 18.18. The power of the keyes, just as his Magistracy hath theRom. 13.4. power of the sword; but ever, the modelling of this Magistracy, and of this Ministery, belongeth unto theExo. 18.19. Law∣giver. Moses, that is, God by Moses, may sin∣gle outExo. 28.1. Aaron and his Successors to be high-Priests; the Levites toNum. 18.5 serve at the Altar, toNum. 1.50.3 31. bear the Ark, &c. David may1 Chr. 15.11. -17. appoint Singers, &c. and Salomon2 Chr. 5.12. may re∣quire them to take their Courses in the Temple orderly like an Hoste. In his time, in answer to the heads of the twelve Tribes, Christ hadMat. 10.1 his twelve Apostles. In answer to the seventy Elders, he hadLuk. 10 1 his seventy Disciples: So after his Ascension, for the benefit of the Church, were addedAct. 6.5. Ephes. 4.11. Rom 12.6. 1 Cor. 12.28. Deacons, Evange∣lists, Pastors, Teachers and Bishops, and why not other such like, as the benefit of1 Tim. 5.9. Tit. 1.5. John 3.8. 2 Sam. 6.5. 1 Kings 8.64. 1 Chr. 15.12.16.4. 2 Chr. 29.30, 34. Ezra 6.16, 18. Nehem. 8.9.9.4. Christi∣an Kingdoms, and Chuches shall require? I conclude then, so far is our Hierarchy from being a rock of offence unto such as receive a love of the truth, that they are undeniably aEphes. 4.7, 11. gift of the holy Ghost, even1 Cor. 12.28. helps in Church-Government; for where these celebrate thy name, It isPsal. 68.25. well seen, O my God, how thou goest, how thou my God and King goest in the Sanctuary The next Scandal (if any) ariseth from our Function it self; and that, not so much unto others among us, as,The Function it self. unto the flourishing Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom: If these rule well,
may God have the Glory, and themselves the praises due; Nevertheless, since they have been, more for ruling like1 Sam. 7.15.12.4. Samuel, then for1 Sam. 2.18.3.20. ministring before the Lord like Samuel; since they have stumbled at holy Orders as somewhat below their quality and birth; with all humble∣ness and earnestness I beseech them (and others for them) to recollect how little weight there is in the Stone of Offence: For, 1.1. Not unwor∣thy the highest. Suppose not many mighty, not many noble receive the Saving Faith; Saving Faith is no whit the less precious: just so, be it that not many mighty, not many noble minister before the Lord, the Ministery of Reconciliation is no more whit dishonourable. 2.

Even among the Heathen which knew not the Majesty of God, Priest-hood wasRex Anius, Rex idm homi∣num, Phoebique Sacerdos. Virg. had in very high esteem: Unto Jupiters Priest the RomanesAlex. Gen. ier. l. 6 c. 12. permitted a stately Robe, a Curule Chair, as well as a Flama or Mitre; yea, the Caesars themselves, were, some of them, as well Pontifices, as Imperatores: Afore the Ro∣mans,
the Greeks entituled the same person to officiate as Priest, which. Aristot. Politic. ruled as Mo∣narch. Before the Greeks, the Epians had their precious. Isidor. c∣lsiotes. l. 2 Ep. 291. Crown of Priest-hood; placing their Priests the next. Diod. Sicul. unto their Princes. For my part, I am easily perswaded, that they did, as in other things, so in this particular, imi∣tate Gods chosen people, among whom Aaron was the next unto Moses, then when Moses was King in Jeshurum: Beside, we find Melchizedec aGen. 14.18 Priest, as well as King; David aAct. 2.30. Prophet, as well as a King; Salomon a Preacher, as well asEccles. 1.1. King. Oh, when will the No∣bility of England follow the example of these renowned Princes! May they consider, that Esai∣as was therefore the more honourable, because a Prophet. Jehoiada was more famous in being High-Priest, then in his affinity to the Diadem of Judah; nor was Joseph ever greater then when from him was theSee Juuius on Gen. 49.24. Shepherd, the Stone of Is∣rael. The person speaking in my Text did not de∣ny his kingly office, but in the fulfiling of his Prophetical and Priestly Offices he both lived and died. Of the Persons here spoken to, James and Jude his brother, James and John his brother wereCleophas called also Al∣pheus was bro∣ther of Joseph, the Virgin Ma∣ries husband; James and Tude were sons of that Cleophas; and James and John were sons of Salome, the daughter of that Cleophas. high born, yet gloryed more in being the Apostles of Jesus, then in being (as indeed they were) of the blood Royal. I have there∣fore no small hopes, that the Nobles of England who find it their Esteem to be Ministers of State, will so train up their excellent Children, that they may within few years, be partakers in that
Isa. 61.6. promise, and be deservedly called, The Ministers of our God. We have looked upon the Persons spoken to in my Text,2. Not injuri∣ous unto Lay persons. with both our eyes. We have noted in them, first, (that which we naturally espie in others, and over-see in our selves, viz.) great Failings: next, (that which we as natu∣rally covet for our selves, but envy in others, viz.) great Dignities. And [verily] God himself magnifieth their Office: their Letters credential are endited by the blessed spirit, and sealed, not with wax, but with blood; with blood, not of goats or lambs, but of a man; not of a man only, but ofAct. 10.28. a God. Their Embassie treateth concerning, not War, but Peace; not among petty Provinces, but large Kingdoms; on terms, not dishonourable, but (of all sorts) the most honourable, namely, that of a successful marriage. Authority they have to proclaim a1 Cor. 5.8. Isa. 25 6. Solemn Festival, and to espouse be∣lievers unto the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. Yea, lest the sons of men should not duly esteem the servants of the living God, lest the persons spoken unto in my Text, should otherwise want of a Reception answerable unto the Majesty of him whom they represent, the Lord of Glory vouch∣safeth to entitle them, not only his Ministers, but his Embassadours; not only his Embassadours, but his Angels. Mean while (such is, if not our Inheritance, our lot) from this accreaseth one more stumbling stone, a stone cast between Christians, as Clergy
and Laity: The Laity so called for discrimina∣tion sake, the Clergy so called for divers rea∣sons. One, the Priest-hood, once a part ofGen. 25.31. the birth-right of the first born, wasDeut. 10.8, 9. 1 Sam. 2.28, 29. afterward allotted unto a peculiar Tribe. Another, whereas Moses and Joshua divided the promised land among the other Tribes; God himselfNum. 18.20, 21. Josh. 13.33. Ezek. 44.48. allotted unto the Levites their Inheritance: A third, the firstAct. 1.26. Cleros autem vel Clericos hinc appellatos Docto∣res nostri dicunt, quia ut Matthias sorte clectus est; sic & om∣nes quos illis temporibus Ec∣clesiacum Prin∣cipes ordinabant, sorte eligebant. Isidor. de Offi∣ciis Eccles. l. 2 c. 1. Successors of these Apostles here spoken unto, were all of them chosen by casting of lots. A fourth, because God who still provideth for them, God who taketh pleasure in the prosperity of his servants, is still their. Deut. 10.9.

Ministers of Christ have fromFrom before. Anno Dom. 160. Platina. Primitive times been stiled the Clergy; nor is this practice more ancient then iu∣nocent: For, 1. The same God which separated theDeut. 10.8. Levites, separateth his Apostles toActs 13.2. Rom. 1.1. Gal. 1.15. minister unto him. 2. While Christ chuseth to himself a1 Cor. .1. Ministery, he1 Cor. 12.4, 28. Ephes. 4.11, 12. giveth it as a Help and Be∣nefit to his Church. 3. The Holiness of our Profession we deny not, but we claim unto our persons no other ho∣liness or heaven, then what the God of Grace in∣differently
vouchsafeth as well unto you as unto us; in the same sense, that there is neither bond nor free, neither Male nor Female; there is nei∣ther Clergy nor Laity; for we are all one in Christ Jesus: If while ye give diligence to walk worthy the Lord in your Callings, we in our Callings ne∣glect so to do; as St. Augustine (admiring An∣tonius) toldSurgunt in∣docti, & coelum rapiunt, & nos cum doctrinis nostris sine cor∣de, ecce ubi vo∣lutamur in car∣ne & sanguine. Alipius, We Clergy-men may perish in Hell, while ye no Clergy-men become Kings and Priests unto God in Heaven. 4. There is one God, one Saviour, one Maker and Father of us all, who is above us all, among us all, and in us all: As well Laity as Clergy, we have (all of us) one Lord, one Faith, one Bap∣tism, yea and oneSimul hoc sumimus, simul bibimus, quia si∣mul vivimus.

Lords Supper too. 5 Lastly, As we are bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh, so we are oneEphes 4.4. 1 Cor. 12.13. spirit: We have a spiritual Communion, Clergy with Lai∣ty, Laity with Clergy, both together making up that one Mystical body, whereof Christ is the head: so are we members one of another, that this discrimination of Clergy and Laity, like that (in our English Diadem) of the white and red Rose, causeth not difference but Ʋnion: I say, it doth but mind us of the Ʋnity of the Spirit, speaking not only our Peace, but our Happiness; While, what diversity, we have, like that of the corner
stones in the Temple, is therefore such, that it may the more strengthen the spiritual Building of God. Wherefore we (of the Clergy) beseech you (of the Laity) that there be no strife between you and us, for we are brethren. Our Lord and Ma∣ster is not ashamed to call you brethren, much less we his servants; yea, we your servants for his sake. We repute you not Ethnick or Heathen, but The Laity, the people of God; Examples we would be, Strangers we would not be unto Be∣lievers. And ye, brethren, as without holiness, ye cannot see God; so without Peace, ye cannot cherish Holiness: a body so fitly joyned together as thisEph. 4.16. Col. 2.19. body of Christ is, then best edifieth it self, when it most encreaseth in love. When in sincerity we pray, that God would save you his people; and ye petition, That God would bless us. His inheritance. When ye pray for us, That we may be indued with Righteousness; and we for you, That ye may be spiritually joyful; this is mutually a pledge to us all, that God would give unto us clean hearts, and will not with-hold his spirit from us. Beloved, It is our joy, that while we are a chosen Ministery, ye are a chosen Generation; Our joy, that while we are a royal Priest-hood, ye are a peculiar people. On the other side, unto so many of you as acknowledge a God of1 Cor. 14.33. Order, unto so many of you as seek1 Cor. 40. Decency, andCol. 2.5. Stedfastness, the received distinction of Clergy and Lay-men will become
not a Rock of Offence, but a1 Cor. 11.16. Jer. 18.15. compared with Jer. 6.16. Monument of Antiquity: Which Monument is such a founda∣tion of Order and of Peace, that I hope, we shallIsa. 54.11. lay this foundation with Saphires. If the word Clergy, or the word Laity have, through the Corruption abroad, been made offences, bles∣sed be God, such is our Reformation at home, that we shall lay these stones (formerly offences) nIbid. fair colours, whiles the discrimination it self, like the stone1 Sa. 20.19 Ezel sheweth us the way, viz.

Luke 9.62. 1 Cor. 9.16, 17. hu∣miliation, that we are the Clergy. Our true, our spiritual happiness consisteth in being such as every one of you ought to be, viz. sound be∣lievers, and zealous Followers of Christ Jesus our Lord. Consider the persons spoken unto in my Text, that they were chosen Disciples, called to be Apostles and Ministers, we have already understood; but withal, we may observe, that they had more troubles then the other Disciples had. We may further note, that although a chief part of their troubles arose from their of∣fice and Ministery, yet a chief part of their Re∣lief and Comfort arose unto them, not from their being peculiar Apostles, Disciples and Mi∣nisters of Christ, but from their being such as you (we trust) are, viz. followers of God in
Christ Jesus our Lord. When our blessed Savi∣our comforteth them, Let not your heart be trou∣bled, he doth not add, Ye have the credit of being chosen Ministers, ye have the honour of being great Apostles, but ye believe in God; He doth not bid them, remember their preheminencies, but, be∣lieve in me; neither doth he tell them, In the Ministry of the Gospel is no small honour, but, In my Fathers house are many Mansions. Now, Faith in God, Faith in Christ, the Mansions in hea∣ven, are not peculiar unto Gospel-Ministers, as Mi∣nisters,This one name Christian bindeth us a to∣gether, leadeth us all hand in hand toward Heaven. G. H. Serin. on Numb. 17.18. but common to Gospel-Profsessors, as Believers. Having therefore so fully considered the per∣sons here spoken unto, as they were called unto the Ministery of the Gospel; I shall, in the next place, review them under that Notion which much more concerneth their Everlasting peace. I shall consider them as called unto the Faith of the Gospel. And this ye may justy expect from my hands: For, we were only in the Con∣text when we found the persons here spoken unto chosen Ministers; we find them professed Be∣lievers in the Text it self. So many of you as believe in God, so many of you as believe in Christ, let not your heart be troubled; In my Fathers house are many Mansions, as well for you his Elect, as for his Apostles themselves.
PArtly because our Saviour had with so much ease conveighed himself from the Jews,Universal, unto the Professors of the Gospel.Joh. 5.16.7.30.8.20.11.8.10.31, 39.19.11. whensoever the Jews most malitiously attem∣pted to kill him: and partly because, when at last our Saviour did (notMat. 26.53, 54. escape, but) suffer death, the Traitors heart was so manifestlyMat. 27.3.5. overcome with sorrow, someJansea. Concord. Evan. cap. 140.

V. 8. compared with v. 14. re∣solved he would gain by his Treason. Secondly, What good affection aJohn 12.6. Thief had for an ho∣nest Master, I know not. Thirdly, The Trai∣tor could notMat. 16.21. be ignorant, that the same Jews which bought his Master, would with wicked hands crucifie him. Fourthly, as his covetous heart could not brook to see any cost go beside his bag; so neither could his Hypocritical heart brook it, that he wasJohn 6.70.13.26. Mat. 26.23, 24, 25. layed so open before his Fellow-Disciples. Fifthly, Of this I am sure, thePsal. 41.5, - 9.109.4, 5, 16. Scriptures concerning him, could not but be fulfilled. Sixthly, This ye will
all say,1 Cor. 16.22. If any man love not the Lord Jesus, let him be accursed. Judas he loved not the Lord Jesus, he wasJoh. 15.25 his adversary without a cause; HePsal. 41.9.109.5. rewarded him. evil for good; he lifted up his heels against hisJoh. 13.18. Head, he was a veryJoh. 6.70. Devil unto him: Therefore Judas was not ignorant, but malicious; not upright, but a Thief; not sincere, but a Hypocrite; not a Con∣vert, but a Caitiffe; he loved not the Lord Je∣sus, and was therefore aJoh. 17.12. son of Perdi∣tion. Now, in as much as Judas is found to be a son of perdition, he is utterly excluded from the comforts of this Text: When Christ saith, Let not your heart be troubled, he speaketh not to Ju∣das whoJoh. 13.30. left him, but unto the Disciples who abode with him: Here is therefore matter to be applied unto all of you, and unto none of you. First, Unto none of you, viz. Unto none of you in my Text; unto you that are none of Christs. Next, Ʋnto all of you, viz. Unto all of you in my Text; unto all of you who are true Disciples of Christ, unto all of you Disciples who faithfully continue sincere Followers of Christ. To proceede, then: The person here speaking in my Text, is one who is a Teacher sent from God;To Unbelie∣vers: whom it one who rightly divideth the Word of Truth; one who distributeth unto each his due portion; one who separateth between the goats and the sheep; between the chaff and the wheat; between the vile and the precious; as he will not break the bruised Reed, will not quench the smoaking flax, so neither will

On which see Hammond, and on Act. 1.18. burst again. Thus the same Gospel which publisheth glad Ti∣dings unto you, who continue Christs unfeigned Disciples, the same writteth bitter things against you that forsake your own Mercy. Methinketh the Genius of this present Text is much like un∣to that good Angel specifiedMat. 28.2. by S. Matthew; such as seek for Iesus, them itMat. 28.5. gratifieth, them it filleth with holyMat. 28.8. fear, them it filleth with greatMat. 28.8. joy.

because itGen. 4.7.19.15. 2 Sam. 12.13. Isa. 6.7.  signifieth the evil of sin; and fitly; for as the disunion of theJames 2 26 soul from the body, is the death of the body; so the dis∣union of good from the soul, is theGen. 2.17. death of the soul; wherefore impossible it is, that a reasonable Creature shouldPro 8.36.14.14. Gen. 20.3. Deut. 30 15. Numb. 32.23. chuse sin, and refuse death: yet thou, whoJoh. 8.24 1 Cor. 2.14. continuest a very natural, fain thou wouldest lay the blame of thy unbelief, not upon thine own unregenerate heart, but upon the permission of the holy God, even of that God who not onlyJosh. 24.15 leaveth thee unto thy free choice, but doth also by way ofProv. 8.1. &c. preventionJoh. 15.5. instruct, nay,Neh 9.13 Psal. 119.86.

He (earnesty endeavouring thy preservation) vehemently calleth out, WhyEzek: 18: 31 wilt thou die? for thy part, answerRom: 13: 9 thou him, if thou canst; Judas was indeed a son of perdition, but hisHos: 13: 9 3 Subterfuge shaken. perdi∣tion was from himself. 3. Now that the worm gnawing thine evil conscience, hath smitten this gourd also, guilt seemeth to turn bank-rupt, and so whispereth unto thee, as if thy sinfulness were now so be∣yond all pardon, that it were now to no pur∣pose to serve the Lord: Well, I will not ex∣tenuate thy guilt; for whatJoh 27: 8 is the bope of the Hypocrite? and what is tby strength that thouJoh 6: 11 9: 2, 3 shouldest hope? yet, say not thy sins are more then God can pardon; but (speak truth) say, thy sins are more then thou wilt part with. When IsraelJer: 2: 25 exclamed, There is no hope, God drew aside his Vizard, and called unto him, With-hold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: just so, thou, if thou un∣mask thy seeming despair, mayst find that thou art now, more theu ever, exalting thy heart against the great God; having wearied thy self in the greatness of thy ways, thou would∣est now lye down in thy shame: I therefore be∣seech thee (who so ever thou art that lyest un∣der this Temptation) see what an idle shift this of thine is: It is meerly a device to convert guilt into sloath; to add drunkenness unto thirst; to despise the long-suffering and goodness of a
patient God; to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath I to blow the coals of Juniper, and to heap those coals upon thyPsal: 68: 21 wounded head! He that is wicked, let him,Rev: 22: 11 if he dareth, be wicked still, saith God; it should seem thou darest! but, ere ever thou leap into the bot∣tomless pit, look a little; for, if Judas could not undergo the scrutiny of his own conscience, how canst thouPsal: 1.5 stand in judgement? if he were such a Coward that he could not find in his heart to break off sin by righteousness, how canst thou away with unquenchable flames? I tell thee, thatMat: 25: 26 servant had never been so wicked, had he not been so sloathful: Whether is easier, to pluck out thy right eye, to cut off thy right hand, and to exercise a godly sorrow for the present, or to endure weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth for ever? in one word, had Judas had the grace to have industriously followed S. Peters example in Repentance, he had not died in his sins, he had never been a Traitor unto himself, nor unto his Lord, the blessed Redemer of lost mankind. 2. This Scripture shaketh unbelievers for being so guilty. Ye that are none of you in my Text,2 For being so guilty. ye who have hitherto despised grace, ye who have professed your selves to have been Chri∣stians, who have thought your selves to have been Disciples, but have refused (unto this very day!) to follow Christ; the whole Genius of this Text doth shake you inside out; it shaketh you over and over.
1.1 In troubling their heart. Notwithstanding so many perplexities were hard at hand, might not these Disciples hearts be troubled? Then, woeIsa: 3: 11 to the wicked, it shall be ill with him: the wicked are like aIsa: 57: 20 troubled sea, choaked with their own mud: So long as Ahab sorsook Gods Com∣mandments, not Elijah,1 Kin: 18: 18 but he troubled Israel: When Achan stole the wedge of gold, it wasJosh: 7: 25 his own fault that he was troubled; he himselfPro: 15: 27 troubled his own soul: nor can there be found an excuse for thee, Oh thou vain man, who sufferest the death of sin to be ever gnawing upon thee; thy heart of unbelief pluck∣eth upon it self the worst of troubles; that ofGen: 4: 7 1 Sam: 25: 31 sin and guilt. While thou dost trouble thy self with every thing, except withLuk: 10: 42 Phil: 2: 12. what thou shouldest, thou dost take a course to bear thine iniquities. 2. This Scripture may make thee exceed∣ingly shake and tremble,2 In not be∣lieving God. for being so unworthy in thy dealing with the Majesty of God: thou canst lean to thine own understanding, but not unto Gods wisdom; thou canst give credit unto the father of lyes, yet refusest to believe thy God which cannotTit: 1: 2 lye; thou hastDeut: 32: 20 no faith for the God of Truth; he made thee, he preserveth thee, he provideth in a plentiful man∣ner for thee; he alone maintaineth thee, yet thou wilt not dread hisPro, 1: 29: Mic: 6: 9 Threats, thou wilt not believePsal: 119: 66 Isa: 56: 4: 65: 12 his command, thou wilt not2 Cor: 7: 1 3 In nor belie∣ving in Christ. trust to his promises. 3. The Instruction in my Text reproveth thee
as for not believing in God, so for not believing in Christ: This is the work of God, That yeJoh 6: 29 believe in him whom God hath sent; but thou art for no such work; thou valuest not his blood and wounds; he suffered death upon the Cross pur∣posely for thee: thou wilt not be at the pains to lookIsa: 45: 22 Zech: 12.10 up to him: Hear him, saithMat: 17: 5 God; Hear him not, saist thou: It isMat: 24: 35 decreed, That his words shall not pass away; for thy share, for ought that thou carest, they may all fall to the ground: He isJohn 14: 6 neither way, nor truth, nor life to thee; He is to thee1 Cor: 1: 30 neither Wisdom, nor Righteousness, nor Sanctifica∣tion. 4.

Psalm 8.3 born to behold the Moon, the Sun, and the Heavens; but thou (foolish Wretch) art for no such Philosophy; thou artJer: 2.12 encompassed about with the hea∣vens,

How is it, that ye can forsake these Mansions; yea, and God, and Jesus Christ also, forEccle: 1.14 mere vanity and vexa∣tion of spirit? Is this reasonable, to exchangeGal: 6: 16 Peace for trouble, trueLuk: 16: 11 riches for thatProv: 23: 5 which is not? To doat upon earth,Col: 3: 1 and for∣get heaven? Ah, how unthankful is that soul which would part with the Mansions of hea∣ven to purchase utter darkness? Again, where are your brains,Isa: 5: 13 57: 11. 54: 16, 17 Deut: 32.18 Jer: 5: 22: 2: 8 while ye trust the world more then God who made it? while ye exchange an Al-sufficient God for a Creature which cannot profit? Once more, is this common sense to re∣ject a mightyIsa: 63: 10 1.2. Redeemer, and to entertain that1 Pet: 5.8: roaring Lion, which at this very instant gap∣eth to devour you? ye trust the devil more then ye trust Jesus Christ who died for you. Thou, who forsakest thine own mercy, review my Text: Doth Christ, doth Jesus Christ use such bowels of affections? such affectionate reasonings? such impulsive insinuations? and all little enough to remove trouble from his most beloved Disciples heart? Tremble thou, then, at these two Questions.
1 Quest.1 Quest. If troubles were ready to swallow up these chosen disciples of Christ, can thyJer. 12.7.25.29.49.12. heart (thinkest thou?) escape untouched? If the1 Pet 4.18. righteous be scarcely preserved, can the ungodly be safe? There is no peace unto theEsa. 57.21. wic∣ked, saith my God. 2. Quest, What wilt thou do in the evil day,2 Quest. when troubles shall lyeIob. 14.17.21.6.13.26. heavy upon thee? When the unbelief and negligence of thy heart hath,Num. 32.23. at length, found thee out? When sin, guilt, death,Ps. 55.5.49.14. judgement, hell, and the De∣vil of hell look thee in thy pale face? when amid the horrour of thy ruefull estate thou hast no God to help thee, no Jesus to save thee, no mansi∣ons to hide thee? If at these two questions thy heartEsa. 66.2. Act. 24.25. trembleth not, thou art no Felix. 2. This Scripture evidently proveth that every unbeleever is a dead man.Maketh a dead man. Thou who didst never yet heartily follow Christ Jesus, if the two last questions shake thee not, thou art none of Christs; if thou art none of Christs, thou hast a heart of unbelief; if thou hast a heart of unbelief, thou art thenLuk. 9.60.

3. As this Scripture findeth thee a dead man, so it findeth a stone rolled upon thy heart;Findeth a stone rolled upon his heart. I say, rolled upon thy heart; for, when God first cre∣ated man, his fountain of natural life wasEccles. 7.29. free, and open unto all saving graces, un∣to all acceptable duties wherewith he abound∣ed: but, now that he is dead, and full of dead workes, it is a signe that he hath aEzek. 11.19 stonie heart, a heart like thatJob. 41.24 of the Leviathans, as past feeling as the nether milstone, a heart hard asZech. 7.12 the adamant.

This Scripture findeth this unweildy stone not only not rolled away from thy dead heart,Findeth this stone sealed at the corners. but there fixed; thou hast set to thy seal that
thou wouldest have it so; the several cor∣ners of thy corrupt heart are all of them sealed by thine own mis-doings. 1.1. Corner. Thou hast set to thy seal unto thine own natural insufficiencie: thou art so soaked, so dead-drunk in thy sinfulnesse, that, thou art not able to arise, and walk uprightly, ifRom. 7.18 thou wouldest: even these Disciples in my Text which abode still with Jesus, could not of themselves lay aside the troubles of their heart; Christ (ye see) was fain to help them; again, of themselves they had never believed in God; this wasJam. 1.17 Phil. 1.29 given unto them from above: in like manner, withoutJohn. 15.5 help from Christ they could not believe in Christ. As for the way unto Gods heavenly mansions, they could not know that neither, untillJohn. 14.8 Christ Jesus would first reveal it unto them. 2. As thou canst not stirr if thou wouldest,2. Corner. so (the more is thy guilt) thou wouldest not stirr if thou couldest; thou canst not2 Cor. 3.5 think of it; thou wilt not1 Cor. 2.14 hear with that ear; thyRom. 8.7 carnal mind holdeth an enmitie against God, thou wilt never be willing ifPhil. 2.13 God work not a will in thee: What draw neer unto the pure God? unto the sincere Christ? inhabite that house wherein the holy Father, the holy Jesus, the holy Spirit dwell? no minde, no maw to that (thou!) as for thee, thy delight is in loosness, and in2 Cor. 6.15, 16 prophaneness; as for God, his delight is in puritie, and in holiness; small lust hast thou to acquaint thy self with this God, or with this

Corner. A third seal sixing this stone upon thy dead heart, is this; namely, Hadst thou from within thy self a sufficiency, hadst thou from within thy self a good will too; neverthelesse, the evil which thou hast drawen upon thy self, createth thine own hinderance: thou hast contracted guilt, and this guilt hathPsal. 58.3 made it natural to thee to be a child ofEph. 2.3 wrath: a stonePro. 27.3 is heavy and sinketh downward, and just such is thy conscious heart; guilt findeth thee within aHos. 13.9 pit of destruction, within a deep pit of self-destruction, and there it keepeth thee: God is1 John 3.20 greater then thy heart, and knoweth all things; mean while thine own conscience condemneth thee over and over, and (loe!) the guilt of thine own conscience keepeth thee aloof from Gods presence: thou art rightly Adams brat; if God call thee, thouGen. 3.8, 10 hidest thy self. Thy heart re∣proveth thee for not believing theDeut. 7.9 faithfull God; thy heart reproveth thee for not receiving the Lords Christ; thy heart reproveth thee for not preferring the mansions of Heaven before the torments of Hell; and knowing so ill by thy self, thou playest least in sight; thou hast for∣feited
thine own peace, by troubling thine own soul, yet seekest not for peace in Christ! Yea, thou hast so dis-countenanced the Ministerie of reconciliation, so despised the Spirit, so negle∣cted thy Redeemer, and so defaced the Fathers image, that though (such is their goodnesse) the Trinitie of Persons would shew thee com∣passion, thou hast not confidence to look them in the face. Thou hast repeated contumelies, and obstinacies against Heaven, and mayest justly wonder that thou art not already in Hell. True heavenly mansions there are, but, thou fanciest them too neer the Lodgings of a provoked Governour: (couldest thou hope for mercie,) alas, thy titleNon est cen∣sendus haeres qui non festinat ad haereditatem. seemeth lost, thorough want of timely claim; grant thy claim to continue valid, thou canst not knock at heaven gates for pure shame; they indeed are open, but thy tardie heart blusheth to look toward them: this the third: see, now, the tri-angle in thy heart opposeth it self against the Trinitie in thy God: I mean, there is never a corner in thy stonie heart, whereon thou hast not sealed thine own doom, in despight of God, and of his free grace! 5. Hadst thou a power, hadst thou a will,Findeth this sealed stone. watched. hadst thou a face too to overtake God in Christ at the heavenly mansions, there yet remaineth one hinderance, which rendereth this stone of unbelief more unlikely to be rolled away from thy heart, then did all the three former cir∣cumstances together. Several of the inhabi∣tants

Isaac and his servants found. Thou who art dead and buried in trespasses, and sin, as verily as thou cherishest a heart of unbelief, so verily upon every sealed corner of that stonie heart of thine there is set a strict, a constant watch: look, how often thou attemp∣test to undeceive thine heart, to shake off thine unbelief, and to walk in newnesse of living; so often (though thou seest them no more then Elishaes servant2 King. 6.16, 17 saw his friends) so of∣ten thou meetest enemies, more then one, or two.

Alas (whether he will or no) he is shaken, he becommeth a dead man; a stone of unbelief lieth upon theMark 15 46 door of his heart, and that stone isMat. 27.66 set∣led, fixed, and sealed with insufficiencie, aversnesse, despaire; he wanteth a power, he wanteth a will, and saith within himself, There is no hope. We read of stones ofJob. 28.3. darknesse, of stones ofEzek. 28 14 fire, and ofEsa. 34.11 stones of emptinesse: and we find them all three in the heart of un∣belief. Wretch! the world circumventeth thee, the world permitteth thee not to mind that oneLuke 10.42 only thing which is necessary; the world hurleth stones of emptiness at thy head; the flesh, that1 Pet. 2.11 warreth against thy soul, that slingeth stones of fire against thee; the Devil he fooleth thee with delaies, he lulleth thee

Now, if the Lord hath a mind to destroy thee,Esa. 63.17 2 Chron. 25.20 Mat. 13.14, 15. Deut. 29.4. he will go on to hide from thee these sore evils: but, possibly, the power of the Word hath wrought upon thee: possibly, thou art afraid of Gods judgements: I trust, the Lord hath cau∣sed thee to tremble at his threats: I hope thy heart smiteth thee; I hope thou seekest for Jesus; If so, then (but not until then) be of good cheer, The Master calleth thee. I beseech thee therefore, (whosoever thou art) ponder thy life past; the hours, dayes, weeks, moneths, years which thou hast spent, not in service to, but in rebellion against, a God patient indeed, but just, andNahum 1.2. jealous: Consider again, and again, that thou canst not be at the same time in a state of unbelief, and in the state of salvation too; (it will cost more then so, to work out thy salvation:) wouldest thou know in this thy day the things which be∣long unto thy peace, thou wouldest (what pains soever it shall cost thee) watch and pray, and strive, and strive to make thy calling and election sure. Hell flames are about thine ears, wilt thou lye still and be burnt in thy bed? Art thou so foolish a Coward, that thou wilt wink while the Devil stabbeth thee? Is it more to∣lerable to endure torments in hell, then to exer∣cise repentance upon earth? Are unquencha∣ble flames more to be desired, then the Mansi∣ons in heaven? Is it safer to continue a Judas, then to approve thy self a sincere convert, and a sound beleever? Wilt thou still refuse eter∣nal

As sure as death, in the grave there is (as I just now told thee) no Redemption: when once sentence is passedEccle. 11.3 Mat. 25.46 upon examination had, there is then no repealing. so soon as ever thy farthingProv. 20.27 24 20 candle is burnt out, thy soul, if it sa∣voureth not sweet in heaven, it is cast into the

Swift was that (last) thought of thine; but, thy souls flight shall be swifter then was thy last thought. Man (for want of consideration) wasteth hours, and minutes; theDau. 7.9 ancient of days doth not so: Unto him, who inhabiteth eterni∣ty, every little time is so precious, that in less space then the space of one moment, he dispatcheth the soul from this prison of flesh, unto his high Court of Justice; and again from his high Court of Justice, unto the place of execution, or of glory, (as Justice shall give sentence:) I say, thy breath of life once expired, thy winged soul is allowed no time at all to look back, (no) it forthwith appeareth before the judgement2 Cor. 5.10 seat of God, and from thence forthwith unto the joys, or miseries, by order, appointed: Thy flesh indeed, that is dispensed with until the generalJohn 6.40 Assizes; but (her Proxie) thy spirit that giveth her appearance upon the very first day of the Term.

MOTIVE 7.Motive 7. A seventh Motive invite∣ing thy soul to hold fast that which is good, is thy natural insufficiency: At thy first Creation there was in thee the spiritGen. 1.26 of a God; the light of that spirit Adam quenched, and (in Adam) thou: In baptism, the same spirit entered into a Covenant with thee; the same spirit thou hast again grieved, and quenched: none of all his mighty workings have prevailed upon thy heart; carnally minded thou hast been, spiritually minded thou wouldest not be: Of all those graces which the holy Spirit of God may justy call for, thou canst not produce one! Consider now, thou hast failed ofFuror est post omnia per∣dere naulum. his saving gifts; wilt thou render the com∣mon gifts of that bountiful spirit useless too? the more ungrateful thou hast been in rejecting
the one, the more thankful thou shouldest be in making a benefit of the other; the greater want thou findest of that sufficiency which thou mightest have had from God, the greater rea∣son thou hast to plow up the fallow ground of thy heart, that thou mayest sow to the spirit; if thou hast been so unfaithful that God would not adventure with thee his ten talents; be so trusty, that God may not repent him of that one talent now in thy hands; or, if thou hast embesled that Talent, yet, at least, restore unto God his napkin: having robbed thy Ma∣ster of his moneys, do not keep from him his purses too: thou hast cut off thyJer. 10.23 legs, therefore usePsal. 25.12 Hos. 6.3 crutches; the more thou hast dulled thineEccl. 10.10 axe, the more pains thou must take in hewing; thou hast blunted the edge of the spirit: it concerneth thee to make the best use thou canst of thine affections, thy memory, and thine understanding; the more graceless thou appearest, the more thou art obliged to use all means of grace: the Word of God is two-edged; as I cannot hope for salva∣tion, without the help of Gods Spirit, so nei∣ther can IPro. 1.23 Luke 11.13.

MOTIVE VIII. Thy natural averseness. There is no such Trewant as the natural man;Motive 8. Judas will rather hang himself, then delight in his Masters pleasure: but, first, meer shame will reduce thee from this ingratitude: no love for thy father? nor love for thy Redeemer? nor love for thy preserver? fie! fie, for shame! the oxeIsa. 1, 3 knoweth his owner, and the dog, at thy heels, his master. Secondly, Let thy heart alone, and thou1 Cor. 2.14 wilt love thy God less next day, then thou wilt to morrow, and less to morrow then to day thou dost. Thirdly, Thou must not follow, butCol. 3.1 lead thine affections; we force our selves to delight in such diets, such exercises, such employments as most suit, not with our pleasure, but with our real good. Fourthly, What thanks is it, if we place our affections upon that whereunto we are of our selves addicted? but, herein we know that we love our God, if we denyMat. 16.24 our selves, that we may love him. Lastly, re∣move thine ignorance, and thy dis-affection is removed; once see the beauty of holiness,Exod. 15.11 and be out of love with it, if thou canst; thou wilt therefore love God, because God is glo∣rious in holiness, thy Lord most holy. MOTIVE IX.Motive 9. A ninth Motive which may stir up thy mind to follow God fully, is thy desperate guilt. The whole need not the Physiti∣an, but, thou dost: such a sinner as thou art, may well cry God mercy all the days of his life;
He that hath wallowed in so much mire as thou hast done, hath great reason to wishEzek. 36.25 for clean waters; who should thirst after sanctifi∣cation, if thine Aethiopian skin should not? the Leopards spots are white to thine: if the blood of the Lamb can make thy crimson sins whiter then snow, surely, thou hast cause suf∣ficient to bath in that warm blood! thou hast sin∣ned so prodigally against heaven, and against God, that, it is the best of thy skill to make benefit of Christ merits; Then, then the holy Angels willLuk. 15.7. rejoyce indeed, when they see such a lost creature as thou hast been, take the kingdom of heaven by violence, and main force. MOTIVE.Motive 10. X. A tenth particular which helpeth thine unwearied soul to take the king∣dom of heaven by violence, is the present evil world: viz. unless it were better then it is; thou wilt no moreJam. 1.27 dirty thy self with it; the cares thereof may choak such as love them, but thee they drive unto1 Pet. 4.19 thy faithful Creator; to him that endured temptations in the wilder∣ness, Canaan is sweet: pleasures upon earth may ensnare fools; they only mind thee of thy ma∣sters joys; thou translatest the whole book of na∣ture into a book of grace, well knowing, that the things which are seen are transitory; but the things which are not seen, are eternal. MOTIVE XI.Motive 11. The next particular ser∣ving to awaken thee unto righteousness, is the
corruption of thine old man: For, first, whileGal 5.17 thy flesh is contrary to thy spirit, his thouRom. 6.16 art unto whom thou yieldest obedience; and if it was thyRom. 8.6. death to be carnally minded; to be spiritually minded is a sign of life.

MOTIVE XII.Motive 12. The roaring lion at this instant seeking to devoure thee: Among too too many Ministers, who, during our late detestable rebellions, were most re∣proachfully tossed out of their livelyhoods; one I knew, whoMr. Vade of Odington in Glocester-shire would full often, with indignation enough, boast himself a person more beholding unto Committee-men then unto all the kinred which be had; his riddle was, while he kept house in his Parsonage, di∣seases, cares and debts grew upon him; but, so soon as the Committee had once for ever sequestred (from Him) his Parsonage, they, (from that time forward) eased him of his debts by disposing his fifths for their pay∣ment; they cured him of his disease, while want of a horse made him walk away his Gout;
and, withall, they freed him from his cares, for he had now no worldly thing to care for: (bear with me) the condition is thine; I may seriously affirme that, next unto God himself, thisMatt. 6.13 13.39. evil one is (although fullEsa. 10.7. sore against his will) the very best friend whom thou hast in the world; if thou hast but eyes of understanding in thy head, this I will clear unto thee in three particulars. The DevilEph. 6.12. 1 Pet. 5.8. befriendeth thee, first, By deter∣ring from sin; Ah, Sir, this Bug-bear at the gate will make thee1 Tim. 3.6 7. keep within dores; the saucer eyes of this spright will make thee look unto thy self; espie once his cloven foot, and adventureAct. 24.16. abroad if thou darest. Secondly, By Temptations; thou wilt not trust a reconciled enemy; The Devil is soEph. 6.11 2 Cor. 2.11 well known, that none of his chaff can catch old birds; if he begin to tempt, he will make thee glad to cling unto thy father; Thy fear of this Pursevants ArrestHeb. 4.16 will make thee take Sanctuary; the more stratagems this sub∣tle creature useth to2 Tim. 2.26 entice thee toward hell, the more thy holy jealousies will draw thee toward heaven; and all the while this Avenger lasheth thee1 Kin. 12.11 with Scorpions, heGal. 3.24 schooleth thee unto Christ. Thirdly,Ephes. 6.11 by wrestlings: carnal1 Pet. 2.11 lusts war against the soul; but we wrestle not against flesh and blood alone; these are no equal match for him thatPsal. 23.4 27.12 undertaketh to be strong in the Lord; that is aHeb. 22.4 Sine periculo seiget ludus. dull skirmish which hazardeth
no blood: Surely thou shalt see what thy servant can do, saith the1 Sam. 28.2 Warriour. As the Martyr Juliano kissed the step whereon he stood to suffer death; so thou, when valiant, wilt kiss the turf whereon thou standest to fight thy Lords battel. Glad is David, if he may be but allowed to deal with1 Sam. 17.32 a Goliah: if JetherJudg. 8.20 fear Zebah, and Zalmunna, it is because he is yet a youth; a Gideon will make make them hisJudg. 8.21 ornament. MOTIVE XIII. To omit many others,Motive 13. the last Motive which now presseth, why thou shouldest return: why, if thou return, thou shouldest return unto the Lord; and why, if thou return unto the Lord, thou shouldest return unto him with thy whole heart, is, Thecompare Ex. 7.13 with Job 23.16. Gen. 19 11. with 21.19. Numb. 22. v. 25 with  31. 2 King. 6.20, : 18 17. Luk. 24.16, 31 & John 20.14 with Dan. 3.25 Deut. 29.4. with 2 Tim. 2.21 Deut. 5.29 with Isa. 59.1, 2 & sim. 6.9. power of God. Whence was it, that, heretofore, what evil thou wert loth to commit in the sight of man, that thou couldest boldly perpetrate before the face of theGen. 16.13.39.9 ever-present God? Whence was it, that the very same affections of thine which have beenPhil. 3.19 so mindless of spiritual blessings, have been so inordinate un∣to vile lusts? or, that the same understanding of thine which is so wiseRom. 3.11, 18. in the things of this world, is so far to seek in the things of a better world? If thou knowest not whence this is, I will resolve thee; the thing is of God, viz. from the power of his justice: Now, the same God which can in justice leave thee to thy
foolishness so far as to make thee fearRom. 3.18 man, more then the face of the most holy: The same God can in mercy bring unto thee thy right sen∣ses, and make thee fear to do evil; if for mans sake, for GodsJohn 5.9 Jer. 5.22 sake much more: The same God which could suffer thine affections to go awhoring after their shame,Psal. 25.12 can place them upon the things above: and the same God which suffered thy brains to weary themselves in stu∣dying how to ensnare thy self in the world, the same God can, when he shall so please, make theePsal. 51.6 wise unto salvation. True,2 Cor. 3.5 were there not a power in God able to give unto thee, what he expecteth from thee, there were then some cloak for thy back-slidings: but the same God whichEzek. 18.32 biddeth thee turn, is ableJer. 31.18 Lam. 5 21 to turn thee; and therefore heProv. 1.23 reproveth thee to this end, that through his strength, thon mayest turn unto him. The same God which calleth thee unto2 Pet. 3.9 repentance, canAct. 5.31 give repentance, and therefore heHag. 1.5 Rev. 2.5 instructeth thee to consider thy ways, that thou mayest by his help gain repentance: The same God which requirethDeut. 28.58 thy fear, canJer. 32.40 put his fear into thine inward parts; and therefore heDeut. 4.10.17.19 Prov. 3.2 Psal. 19.7 directeth thee to the Scriptures, that thou, by them, mayest learn toHos. 3.5 fear the Lord and his goodness. The same God which commandeth1 Joh. 3.23 thee to believe; canPhil. 1.29 give thee a power to believe, and there∣foreRom. 10.14 instructeth thee, that faith cometh by hearing. The same God whichEph. 5.18

Let not thy heart be troubled, believe in God, believe also in me; in my Fathers house are many Mansions.

In stead of ascending to heaven after Christ, of rising to a lively hope in Christ, of crucifying it self with Christ, &c. the heart of Judas couldMat. 27.3 see Christ condemned, and soMat. 27.5 leave him. Wherefore, Christ will leave the name of Judas forIsa. 65.15 a curse unto his chosen. For, untoIsa. 65.11 such as forsake him, thusIsa. 65.13 saith the Lord, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold my servants shall rejoyce, but ye shall be ashamed: behold, theyIsa. 65.14 that for sake the Lord, shall cry for sorrow of heart, they shall howl for vexation of spirit: but, unto You in my Text, unto you his constant followers, he saith,

Which words, as they areVide, sis versionem Per∣sicam. all spoken in a breath, so they do all breath out one, and the same consolation. This Gospel is a kingdom of heaven in an unexpected sense.

The Tabernacles of God, the Son of God, the God and Father of Mercies, are all of them brought within this Text, pur∣posely to ease the Disciples hearts. Object.Object. Though it beIsa. 65.14 promised, My servants shall sing for joy of heart, even then when we expect thatIsa. 51.11 sorrow and mourning should flee away, we are forced to break forthJob 30.26 with Job, When I looked for good, then evil came; and when I waited for light, then came darkness.

Even the hearts of Christs Chosen Disciples are not exempted from troubles inDr. S bs ubi supra. this world. But, while, against these sorrows of this world, he enjoyneth, Let not your heart be trou∣bled; there ariseth another instruction which rolleth away the burden of the former: namely, this, DOCTRINE II. Even great afflictions may not trouble a chosen Disciples heart. 1. That, even, the hearts of Christs chosen Disciples are not exempted from troubles in this life, sad experience evinceth; oneMat. 6.34 day telleth another of this truth: our wholeJob 14.1 life, the wholeJoh. 16.33 world, constantly afford witnesses of this complaint. 2. On the other side, sinceHeb. 12.11 no chasten∣ing, for the present, seemeth joyous, but grievous; seeing, as aProv. 27.3 stone, so,1 Pet. 1.6 1 Sam. 25.37 affliction, is heavy; it shall be my care, to ease you of your griefs; and to remove, if not the stone it self, yet a great part of its heavinesse.
Wherefore, not questioning the former Doctrine, the Doctrine implied: I shall pro∣secute the later, the Doctrine expressed: while I First,The Method. State what Doctrine I would propose. Secondly, Prove the Doctrine which I state. Thirdly, Apply the Doctrine which I prove. There be many that say unto us,Psal. 4.6 who will shew us any good? but, Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. Beloved, let not my weaknesse be your discouragement: although I of my self2 Cor. 4.7 cannot turn your sorrow into joy, or your mourning into gladnesse, the good Angelin my Text now speaking by meRom. 10.17 can; Where the word is, the Word of a God, although the voice be the voice of a man, yet if that voice speak, dry bonesEzek. 37.4, 7. may live. Upon occasion, other Disciples as well as you once asked among themselves,Mar. 16.3, 4 Who shall roll away the stone from the Sepulchre? And when they looked, they saw the stone rolled away: the like may ye, if our God shall now vouchsafe to sanctifie unto you this Truth, namely, That even great afflictions may not trouble a believers heart. I say; DOCTRINE. Even great afflictions may not trouble a believers heart.The Doctrine stated. viz. Though, during this life, sound believers are not exempted from great afflictions, yet those great
afflictions may by no means trouble their heart. Object. At this we already stumble: What?Object. if the righteous perish, may we notIsa. 57.1 lay it to heart? When great afflictions befall us, may not we well be troubled? If the Lord strike, should notJer. 5.3 man grieve? Must we be stu∣pid, must we be Stoical when griefs are up∣on us? Answer. Questionless,Answer. weMic. 6.9 ought to hear as well the rod, as him who hath appointed it: this  forbiddeth no such laying to heart, it requireth no such heed∣lesness. I say, this Text prohibiteth, not a reasonable sense, but aRev. 21.8 distrustful fearfulnesse; not a moderate care, but an2 Cor. 7.10 unprofitable astonishment: Phil. 4.6 , Be careful for nothing: this  signifieth a carking care, a care not furthering, but hindering duties.

shall be established in our present truth, which is; DOCTRINE: Even great Afflictions should not perplex a believers heart. Not to repeat what ye receive fromDr. Donne his LXXIII.

Judge, therefore, By the mouth of no one of all his servants in the Old Testament: in the New Testament, nei∣ther by his servants, nor by himself, did the Lord Jesus, at any time, either expresly, or implicitly say, He would have great afflictions perplex believers hearts: Wherefore the con∣stant silence of the Lord Christ, calleth out aloud; and giving unto this truth his free assent, most undoubltedly assureth every one among us, that, in as much as Jesus Christ our Lord, requireth no suchIsa. 1.12 matter from our hands, No afflictions how great soever, may at all perplex a believers heart. Thats my first proof. My second Proof is from verse the first,Affirmatively. Let not;From verse first &c.

My Brethren, of the clearness of any truths whatsoever, greater evidence hath no man then this, the , the precept, the command, the testimony, the authority of (Him who is the wisdom and the truth; even of) Jesus Christ our Lord. Wherefore, I beseech you, be your tryals never so great, be the removal of a near friend never so afflicting, yet, remember the words which the Lord hath spoken unto you, Let not your heart be troubled. While ye draw nearMat. 28.1 toward the Sepulchre, (I beseech you) take notice, that theJohn 20.1 stone is taken away: take notice that it isMat. 28.2 rolled back by the good Angel in my Text: nay, cast an eye again, and havingLuk. 24.2 found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre, behold how this Angel sitteth upon thatMat. 28.2 stone. That is the next, viz. uponwhat ground, for what reason it is, that our most compassionate Redeemer will not here allow no not any afflictions, how great soever, to perplex his Disciples hearts.
The Reasons are seven-fold.From the whole Text. But, ere ever I can bring forth my Reasons, I must remove one more stone at which some few are (peradventure) willing to stumble. Quest.Dub. If I would have told you, standeth a most undeniable prohibition; then, what Sta∣tute-Law have you for Bowing at the name of Je∣sus; for Bowing towards the East, and (to in∣stance in no more) for placing Tapers upon the Altar? Answ. 1.Solut.

Answ. 2. Thou canst not say that they op∣pose Decency and Order: for, the most learned Fathers of our Church, to whom it appertainethTit. 1.5 1 Cor. 14.40 11.34 to determine what doth, and what doth not make for Dececcy and Order, do, if not enjoyn, yet allow them, especially in Cathe∣drals. Answ. 3 Thou canst not say, We haveTit. 1.16 no such custom neither the Churches of God; for, our learned Fathers receive these practices from Primitive Antiquity. Answ. 4. Suppose Genu-flection first arose from a mis-interpreting of Phil. 2.10. Sup∣pose bowing toward the East, proceeded from as gross a mistake of Zech. 6.12. Suppose wax
candles were originally placed upon the Lords Table in imitation of Jewish, yea of heathenish Rites. This notwithstanding, these customes being now received, may each of them have, at least, a blameless continuance: for, First, what evil is it, if a Christian (if a sincere Christian) bowEph. 3.14 his knees to the Lord Jesus so often as he pleaseth?A Simili∣tude used by way of illustra∣tion. solemnly in words at length, to petition God for a blessing every time throughout the day wherein thou occasionally drinkest, would probably not well consist with the duties of thy Calling: thou art therefore the more to be pardoned, nay, the more to be commended, if, (as a pledge of thy Thankfulness throughout the whole follow∣ing day) thou address thy self to the God of thy blessings, at the first time every day where∣in thou drinkest. Just so, sincere Christians which bow at the name of Jesus, have an equal reverence forSee learned Mede upon Mat. 6.9. viz. his Sanctification of Gods name. ever Attribute of God; but seeing they cannot so conveniently express this reverence every time any divine Attribute of God is mentioned. Look what reverence they would shew unto every name of their gracious God, that they signifie so of∣ten as the holy Jesus is named.

To the pure these are not only blameless, but profitable. Doth some one bow toward the Altar? Look thouEccles. 5.1 to thy feet when thou enterest the house of God. Do others bow at the name of Jesus?

Reason from the trou∣bles themselves. even great afflictions may not trouble thy heart, for these Reasons. Reason 1. From the nature of the troubles: Let not you heart be troubled; for your grievances are but1 Pet. 1.7.4.12 tryals. Afflictions ariseJob 5.6 not out of the dust; they are1 Chron. 29 14 Psal. 39.9. Amos 3.6 ordered from a∣bove, and their use is1 Cor. 3.21 Rom. 8.28 heavenly. A heaviness, I1 Pet. 1.6 grant, they have: and may, in that regard, be truly compared1 Sam. 25.37 unto

So is it with our tryals, as it is with our grave-stones: in the grave there isPsal. 6.5 no remembrance, upon the grave thereMemoriae sacrum. is: Double is the use of a tomb-stone; the corruption of the body, that itMat. 23.27 burieth, but the memory of the person, that itPro. 10.7 keepeth alive. Much af∣ter the same manner, these (great stones, these) heavy afflictione, are cast upon us for two distinct purposes: they shouldPsal. 119.67.71, 75 compared with 1 Cor. 9.27 keep under our corruptions, but they shouldPsal. 119.107 Heb. 12.11 James 1.12 advance our duties too; they are brought not to flatten, but to1 Pet. 5.10 quicken us: to our sins they areRom. 6.11 compared with Col. 3.5.

Reason 2.2. Reason from the heart. From theJer. 4.19 seat of these trou∣bles, the heart: Let not your heart be troubled, because a heart. Chirurgeons in their Ana∣tomies phrase such, and such a part a vessel: a vessel for the brains, a vessel for the urine, for the blood, &c. Now he that fashioned

I say, thePsal. 2.9 1 Thes. 4.4 whole man, much more theMat. 25.4 heart, is a vessel, a vessel appointed, like those of the Temple, forPro 23.26 Gods ser∣vice; wherefore the heart may not at all be taken upLuk. 21.34 with cares: fill a heart with theHos. 7.7 scalding waters of lust, or with thePhil. 3.19 muddy waters of an earthly mind, and whatHos. 4.11 room can there be in that heart, for either1 Joh. 3.3 purity, orMat. 6.21 heavenliness? So, fill a heart with bitter waters of2 Cor. 7.10 unreaso∣nable grief, or with the unwholesome waters ofIsa. 7.9 distrustful fears, and what room is there in that heart for the exercise of faith? waters of affliction are of aJob 33.16 Isa. 44.33 Hos. 5.15 cooling, 1.16 clen∣sing, Psal. 119.67 healing nature, and the heart should be a vessel prepared to receive them, asEccles. 7.3 such. Blessed are ye thatIsa. 32.20 sow unto the spirit besides all waters; for the Spirit of God de∣lighteth toPro 1.23 move upon these; and it con∣cerneth us that he findeth aEph. 4.30 quiet ha∣bitation. Let neitherJam. 1.4 impatiency, norMat. 8.26 distrust, norJob 33.16 compared with Pro. 15.32 21.11 insensibleness, neither quench, nor grieve in the least any motions of so holy a Spirit. If we would find our chastise∣ments, chastisements of peaee, let not the heart be troubled. That a second Reason; as the heart
is the seat of the vital spirits, so it should be the seat of spiritual graces too: It is (at lest it should be) a vessel2 Tim. 2.21 compared with Heb. 10.5 prepared for theCol. 2.12 operations of God: It should be filled not with carefulness, but with theEph 5 18 Spirit. Reason 3.3 Reason from You. From you (your heart) Let not the heart be troubled, because yours; because it is as a vessel, so aIsa. 66.20 consecraed vessel.

From these Mansions. There∣fore let not your heart be troubled, because in

Reason 7. The last Reason, why even great afflictions cannot greatly trouble a believers heart,7. Reason from the End why these Man∣sions are here urged. we spell from the ultimate end and cause for which these Mansions are here thus brought to remembrance. As I, pag. 6. told you, that various troubles were the oc∣casions of these words; so pag. 4, 5, 6. I cleared unto you, that the chief of all those troubles (if not fore-stalled) would be Christs approach∣ing Ascension. I may say of this Text, as one
A personis ad res ipsas transit, ut ma∣jus sit pomdus argumenti. Imo etiam à Christo ad Patrem ascendit, ut doceat in ipso etiam Christo, quatenus bomo est, non idclrco acquiescere, quia nos ad Patrem usque subvehit; sicut ipse Christus ubique testatur se missum à Patre, utsvinculo, cum ipso Deo unà omnes devinci∣amur. Beza in 1 Cor. 3.22. speaketh upon a like Scripture: for, (mark it) to comfort his Disciples, Christ doth not urge, AfterHos. 6.2 three days I will re∣vive you; but, In my Fathers house are many Mansions. These Disciples, soLuke 24.17, 21 deject∣ed at his death, soLuke 24.41 over-joyed at his Re∣surrection, how over-grieved had they been at his Ascension, had they been ignorant of the Mansions in my Fathers house? Jesus he fore-knew, that as with his crucified body all their joys would beMat. 26.56 buried, so with his raised body, all their former hopes wouldMat. 28.8 revive: Did I2 Kin. 4.28 desire a son ofIsa. 9.6 my Lord? Did I notLuk. 24.41 say, Do not deceive me? Less would be the trouble to their carnal, andMat. 20. worldly minds, would Christ crucified not rise again; then, if being risen; he frustrate their secure, their over-joyed hopes, by a mostActs 1.9 unexpected Ascension! What is, if this be not, an astonishing diseomfort? But, see (now) how the compassionate Jesus preventeth all this! Ere ever he thus unexpectedly ascendeth; nay, before his resurrection, nay, before his suffer∣ings, (he keepeth all well!) he here, before hand, timely informeth, Were there no Mansi∣ons in my Fathers house, ye would then sorrow most of all, when ye should, here on earth,

So, then, Against all our Miseries, a com∣fort it is, that, they are but Afflictions; that, there is a God that over-mastereth, a Christ that sweetneth, and Mansions which recom∣pence even these afflictions: but,Christus ipse est Joan. 4.10 do rum Dei pri∣marium & max∣ime principale: caetera omnia sunt taatum mo∣do accessoria: Ac∣cessorium autem sequ tur priaci∣pale. S. S. the prin∣cipal (and worthily the seventh) Reason why our hearts should not be troubled here, is, that when (a little while hence) we shall exchange a world of troubles for heavenly Man∣sions, we shall then ever, for ever, see this God who now moderateth our troubles; we shall then ever, for ever, enjoy that Jesus from whom we are now so loth to part; that Je∣sus who maketh our afflictions his Love-tokens! Oh my brethren! In my Fathers house are many Mansions! (The soul of thisMrs. Rutter.

TO THE SACRED MAJESTY Of our most GRACIOUS SOVERAIGN LORD, in all Causes, and over all Persons as well Ecclesiastical, as Civil, our Supreme Governour, CHARLES, second only to (that blessed Martyr, and glorious Saint) his royal Father; of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, KING, Defender of the Faith; and next unto God, and his Christ, the Prince of our Peace. My Lord, O King, LIve, like yourPsal. 112 6 Name, for e∣ver: livePsal. 61.6 and be The same you are, 2 Cor. 3.18.

Thus, thus IEzra 6.10 pray: But, let Applauses be, Suppress'd by others; and refus'd by me; Not as undue; nor, that a zealous praise, May too too much mans expe∣ctation raise: Nor, that words match not, though, when all is done, Ne're yet could pensil ful∣ly paint the Sun. But (loe!) Believers (Sir) should we display Your brighter beams, would (ra∣vish'd) sin for joy: Saw they your soul, they would sleight heav'n again, And doat on earth, because on earth you reign. I blame my fears! From Charles no evils spring; They walk with God, who fol∣low such a King: Next unto Christ, this Prince of our Peace may
(If Subjects please) roll ev'∣ry stone away: Next unto Christ, He doth our life appear; Good Subjects find life more abundant here! That Truth, that Peace, which with1 Tim. 2.2 Isa 49.23 His Throne consist, Lifts us from Earth to Heaven, from Charles to Christ.

O Our most Gracious Queen, Queen KATHERINE, In purity, in meeknesse, and in all other vertues, your SERENE MAJESTIE excelleth: Therefore, Kneeling down, and fal∣ling prostrate at your SACRED Feet, I am bold to appeal to your ROYAL Experi∣ence, whether many of those Ladies, whom your Majesty hath seen at COURT, be not (in some measure) beside themselves. Three Instances I give, why I suspect this: First, They procure Habits, and Ornaments of too great a value for their Qualities; Next, (as costly as they be) These Habits, these Or∣naments, theyThat shi∣ning star, Ful∣gentius, so over∣looked the fa∣shion of this world, that winter and summer he ware the self∣same Cloaths: for, said he, Christians should change, not their apparel, but their hearts: but some vain Ladies would imitate not Fulgentius, but Nero, who would never wear one raiment twice. lavish upon their waiting-Gentlewomen; Thirdly, (how gay soever their Trim-servants are) They themselves ap∣proach your Sacred Presence carelesly, and rudely attired: MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY, I do therefore conclude, that their Habits and Or∣naments are of too great value; because
these (if payed for) cost much more then what Revenues the Nobles, their Husbands pos∣sesse, can prudently expend: I complain, that, these costly vanities are wasted upon their At∣tendants; because Flesh and Blood are (at best) but the Souls hand-maidens: I likewise affirm, that they themselves abide carelesly and rudely attired; because these Ladies, how unreaso∣nable soever, areGen. 2.7. 1 Cor. 15.45. living souls; I say, li∣ving souls; although (alas, poor souls) some of them are but sluttishlyMe think∣eth A Jewel sparkling in (Pro. 11.22.) a bosome desti∣tute of grace, discovereth a delicate fair skin spread o∣ver a leprous conscience. 1 Pet. 3.3, 4.

By them, no Man∣sions above, no faith in God, noNo gar∣ment like unto the garment of Salvation; nor is any beauty like unto the beauty of Holinesse. Righte∣ousnesse from Christ, inwardly and spiritually thirsted after! (Good God!) Do these Court-Ladies ever dream of keeping Court in Heaven? Except, they, at length imitate the good example of their most Gracious Queen, surely their carelesse hearts cannot long continue untroubled. A Reverend Father of our Church, gravelyBishop Morley, Serm. at his Maje∣sties Coronati∣on, p. 55. adviseth that, once a week, Princes should peruse the hundred and first Psalm: Would some of our Ladies once a week read over the third Chapter of Esay, it would be both their benefit, and their wisdom. I professe for my share, I smell no harm in your perfumes, and other your sweetnesses, if they be not too
luxurious: Rather then put any Countesse to the blush, I will not once mention forraign paints, or home-madeLicitis pe∣rimus onns. Wherefore, let me advise you, not to be too presumptuous upon the lawfulness of these; but consider expedience, that so all may be done that God may be glorified, and your selves more and more edified in Christ: if you look not to this, that which is lawfull in it self, will be found unlawfull in you. Golden Topaz, p. 133. Patches: I will make the best construction I can of naked breasts, provided the Soul be not naked too. But, I fear lest, as Trajan was indulgent un∣to all his people, saving only unto such of his Subjects as were Christians; so some La∣dies are tender of every part about them, ex∣cepting their Souls. Ladies, were you once so wise, as to maintain, but not exceed your Quality, no Christians under Heaven would have lesse cause to trouble their heart, then you your selves would have. True; A woman and a glasse are ever in danger; but a woman and a Bible are ever in safety. It is said of that holy Martyr Polycarpus, that, while his bo∣dy was burning, his scorched flesh sent forth a smell fragrant as Frankinsence it self; just so, the exemplarinesse of that Lady who is crucified unto the world, hath a sweet winning influence upon all about Her; while the com∣linesse of her bodyGratiorest pulch-oveniens de corpore vir∣tus. adorneth the loveli∣nesse of her duties. Moreover, what the Christian Lady reserveth from excesse, that she improveth unto spiritual advantages: Shee
uponReade, if my Pen be more copious in this then in o∣ther places; Know, I am so ready a writer here, because here I fall up∣on a Descrip∣tion of a Lady now with God, viz. the Lady Anne Overbury; of a Lady now with us, the Lady Hester Overbury; of Mrs. Mary Whitlock, of Mrs. Hester Cressewick, and of others a∣mong us, unto every of whom—quod dedisti Viventi decus atque sentienti, Rarae, post ci∣neres, habent beatae; Yet, as they them∣selves seek the praise, which is not of men, but of God; So neither seek I to slatter, but to admonish: My scope is to have Their sight so shine among men, that they seeing their good works, and imitating their good examples may together with them glorifie Him, from whom alone cometh every good and perfect gift: and to whom alone belongeth the glory, and the praise. all opportunities, maketh friends of unrighteous Mammon: Shee disperseth to the poor, visiteth the sick, countenanceth the Gos∣pel, and furnisheth her Closet rather with re∣ligious Books then with fancy-full Toyes: Her very Sex maketh her tender-hearted; Hence it is, that shee is more zealous in love of the truth, in love toward Christians, and in love toward God, then holy persons of a masculine judgement are. Now, as she buyeth the truth, so she redeemeth the time: shee weareth her watch on purpose, because she would not confer more hours upon that body which must be co∣vered with wormes, then upon that Soul which is a companion for Angels; Chambering she loveth, but, it is for meditation-sake; Her Chamber is her Chappel; and herein she get∣teth the start of Students themselves; for, as she delighteth to improve her spare-hours, so she hath more hours to spart then any of any other profession whatsoever: she is so meek, so obliging, so courteous, so commanding over all her affections, that, if she were no Lady, you would call her one: It is not by chance, that, while we super-scribe Lords Honourable, and Knights Right-Worshipfull, we write their Ladies Vertuous; That person which walk∣eth
worthy the Lord, leadeth a life like a Lady, so naturally do a Ladies Vertues adorn the Gospel of Jesus Christ: If afflictions be the trials of a sanctified Lady, her sorrows exercise a godlinesse: if prosperity be her trial, she re∣maineth as good as prosperous: Such is her moderation in worldly affairs, that you will not find she aboundeth with Coin, otherwise then from her works of charity, of liberality, of hospitality, of bounty, of piety, and of mu∣nificence: So full of leasure she is, that you find her ever busied, but, it is in encreasing a spiritual knowledge, in conversing with Be∣lievers, in instructing Heir Families, and (to speak at once) in rejoycing in Heir God: Multitudes of Believers was St. Jerome throughly acquainted with, but among all his Acquaintance, he found no Christians so nearly resemble the Saints in heaven, as E∣lect Ladies did: In the holy Gospels, more Women then Men are noted for ministring of their substance unto the Lord; And, if the wisest of Kings, King Lemuel, do, at the last, undertake to recommend a vertuous woman, he runneth on in her praises unto the end of the Chapter, I had almost said, unto the end of the Book. I conclude then, that, wise La∣dies (like the wise Virgins) therefore keep their hearts from needlesse troubles, that they may take oyl in their Lamps; They resort so often to their Fathers house, that they are perfect Courtiers; for, they have their conver∣sation
in Heaven; they do with so much per∣severance believe in God, that they are ever cloathed (if I may so speak) with inherent Humility, and imputed Righteousnesse. Last∣ly, while they study mu to please most THE man Christ Jesus, Saints they seem, and Saints they are. 6.

Instead of minding their Books, and other their Duties, Chil∣dren scatter away their, Pindar. precious time upon idle toyes; and yet their Fathers, which mourn for them,like Her∣mogenes, who was among boys an aged man, among aged men a boy, Mag∣no conatu nugae. cherish the very same folly. The Child is pinning and un∣pinning baby-clouts; the mother doth the same in affected Apparrel; the child build∣eth Ovens with untempered morter in the streets; the Father is as vain in Housings

The Holy Ghost calleth unto children, as children, untoPsalm 148.12 1 John 2.12, 13, 14 young men, as young men, unto old men, as old men; but he nowhere singleth out mid∣dle aged men, as middle-aged. viz.

Alcib. that he rendred his In∣fancy, his youth, and his manly stature exqui∣sitely amiable and pleasant; may what was attributed unto his limbs, be due unto the vertues of a believers soul; yet, we shall not conclude such a one perfect, untill he hath also crowned his gray hairs with spiri∣tual wisdom: Alas, so doth timePsalm 144.4 un∣dermine us, that half our life is spent before we begin to live unto our God; and, if we are alive unto God,2 Pet. 1.8 it is a holy conversa∣tion which preserveth us as we are.

Verily, When the evill dayes areEccl 21.1 come, when the yeares are drawn nigh wherein ye complain ye have no pleasure, it is then our Duty to beseech you, Let not your heart be troubled. Hours are spent since your Sun was in the Zenith: yea, your Sun [O my Fathers] is not farre from setting now; the long shadowEccl. 6.12 which it doth now cast, wanteth but a lit∣tle

The observations of aged Christians are Treasures layed upPsal. 102.18 for Gene∣rations to come, more precious then those prepared by the Chinois against two or three hundred yeares hence; while our Fathers tell us what was done in their dayes, the trou∣bles which arrest their age they feel not; TheirProv. 16.31 hoary head is a crown of glo∣ry, if it be found in the way of righteous∣nesse.

Thus much they know, and thus much they will tell us, when weEccl. 7.4 Keep company with good men, and thou shalt be of their number. receive their instru∣ctions. The aged Believer is as full of So∣liloquies,Psal. 1.2 63.6.77.12.119.99. as of Solitudes.

In other parts of our fraile life, although we are so often called upon byMich. 6 9 Psal. 119 15 1 Cor. 11.32 aches, diseases, and manifold afflictions; allthough we are frequently foretold inMat. 24.42 44 the holy Scriptures that Christ will steal up∣on us unawares; allthough our Church-yardes openly convince us of this truth, while we weekely stumble over new graves, yet ourLuk. 24.25 slow, dull, backsliding souls will not timely remember their dissolution at hand: we design to make our calling and election sure; but, what we design, that we delay. Now, the happi∣nesse of the aged convert, is, that although other Christians (most unwarrantably) run the hazard of delayes, He (being so aged) dareth not: He wisely considereth, that First, As age groweth old. soPsal. 119 36 Heb. 13.5 covetousness groweth young: Usually, Head and shoulders stoop not towards the ground faster then the heart it self doth; DustHab. 2.6 would to dust: He considereth; wherefore, since he can car∣ry nothing out of the world, he bequeaths the

Reverend, and Belo∣ved, Let us not therefore pick quarrels at Jesus Christs garment, because it isJoh 19 23 seamlesse: Let us not beginGen. 45.24 to fall out by the way, because that Joseph hathGen. 45.22. given to all of us change of Rayment: Let usPro. 23.23 buy the truth with a requisite obedience, and not sell it forGal. 5.26 a popu∣lar ostentation: Love would hideProv. 10.12 a multitude of sins, would1 Cor. 13.7 bear all things, would believe all things, would hope all things, could we but striveEph. 4.3 once to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

Others there are of a long Robe too,Unto some Lawyers. who will not altogether escape reproof: Wo unto you Lawyers, if ye trouble your Clients hearts by rendring their defensive causesEsay 1.17 58.6. burdensome and destructive: Wo unto you Lawyers, if ye plead so long for your Glients Mansions, that ye your selvesMany a Lawyers house is built upon a fols bead. get into their Fathers house: (I might add) Wo unto you Lawyers, if, while ye gain Wealth by the Law, ye lose theMat. 6.33 16.26.13.22. benefit of the Gospel; I mean, if ye covet so much the honours and profits of this world, that ye allowLuke 8.14 1 Tim. 6.17 nor leisure unto your negle∣cted souls, to effectually believe in God the righteousHeb 12.23 judge of all men, and in Je∣sus Christ your only1 Joh. 2.1 Mediator and Ad∣vocate. The Trumpet soundeth1 Cor. 15.25 2 Cor. 5.10. in your eares. Thirdly, These words of my Text speak Reproof unto some Practitioners of Physick;Unto some Physitians. not for studying Galen, or Hippocrates, but for not studying the Word of Life. viz.
First, The house ofEccl. 7.2 mourning read∣eth frequent Divinity-Lectures, especially a∣gainst the flesh, and the world: Let Religio medici flatter her self how she pleaseth; He is not far from an Atheist, who, whileEccl. 7.4. he administreth Cordials unto dying bodies, receiveth no experience for living Souls. Secondly, Although Theology be indeed noCol. 3.16. part of the Physitians profession, yet it is a very requisite accomplishment: Be the other Ingredients, what Physick shall see cause to direct; godlinesse1 Tim. 4.8 should be ever be one of the prescriptions: True, it is not the Physitians errand to ease the heart from trouble, but itHeb 10.24 lyeth in his way (though:) He hath a constant opportunity to shew some spiritual kindnesse unto persons sick at the very heart; and, havingGal 9.10. opportunity, he should do as1 Sam. 10. occasion shall serve; he should lead his Patient, from the chastisementHeb. 12.11 of the body, unto the comforts of the soul. Thirdly, It is not the Practitioner of Phy∣sick, but the great God who disposeth of1 Chron. 16.12 King Asa: the sick bed is aRev. 2.22 summons to Repentance; We are chastened of the1 Cor, 11.32 Lord, that we may not dye in our sins; the Herb can bring no healing Vertue which she doth not firstMat. 4.4 borrow from her Creatour; in short, God is professedly
the God both of ourPsalm 103 3 health, and of1 Sam. 2.6 our life; every of which particulars sufficiently convince us, that the speediest mean to cure the body is to1 Sam. 41.4. Matth. 9 5. begin with the Soul; so speedy, so effectual a course is this, that every one who is a good practitioner in Physick, either is or should be like Saint LukeCol. 4.14 not only a Physitian, but an E∣vangelist. To conclude, By many Patients, the Phy∣sitian2 Chron. 16.12 is sooner thought off then the Parson; yea, full often, the Doctor of physick is admitted, while the Doctor of DivinityJam. 5.14 is shut out. Consider now, a word spoken in season,Prov. 15.23 how good is it? Pity, pity it is, that, the heart of him who gasp∣eth for life, shouldPsalm 73.26 be almost spent through want of Balm from Gilead: If the Minister cannot be, may not be, or is not in presence, careJam. 5.15 must neverthelesse be timely had, that, for him, who is just now giving up the ghost, prayer and intercession be tendered unto the Father of Spirits. Alas, no MedicinesPsalm 94.19 116.8.119.81.42.1, 2, 84.1.62.5. are healing unto a Soul thus troubled: There is no trust∣ing unto Physick at any time; a God, a Je∣sus Christ may, yea must be trusted in: The merit of the person1 Joh. 2.1 here speaking in my Text, drank off blood-warm, transcendeth all other Receipts that can possibly be thought upon: Where the Physitian feareth God, thereGen. 21.22 39.5. Psalm 1.3 God giveth a blessing for the
Physitians sake. Be it that the death of the PatientJob 7.1 Psalm 31.15 seem to upbraid, if not a want of skill, yet a want of successe in the Ar∣tist; yet, O Death1 Cor. 15.55 where is thy sting? the good Physitian findeth no reason at all why he should absent himself from his de∣ceasing Patient; he rather abideth, and con∣ducteth the departing soul toward the many Mansions in my Fathers House. Fourthly, The Mansions in my Fathers House, a faith in God,Unto Trades∣men, and such as buy and sell yea and these trou∣bles of heart, do reprove innumerable followers, not of Christ, but of the world, who most contentedly exchange godlinesse for gain. In Queen Maries dayes, so strong had nature made Sark-Island, thatSir Walter Raleighs Histo∣ry of the World, lib. 4. cap. 2. sect. 18. thirty French∣men could maintain it against all the Flemings in the world: This stratagem was used; Near unto the Isle, with one ship of a small burden anchoreth a Netherlander, pretendeth the death of a Merchant in that Vessel, be∣seecheth the thirty Frenchmen, that the dead body of their Merchant might be buried in hallowed ground, namely, in Sark-Chappel; unto a Request so charitable the secure French∣men yield; The Flemings bring into the Isle a Coffin filled, not with a dead body, but with murdering Harquebusses; then, entring the Chappel, they shut the door upon them∣selves, take their Weapons from out of the Coffin, slay every Frenchman in Sark, and
immediately possesse themselves of the whole Island: Many, many a covetous Trades∣man receiveth just suchProv. 1.19 5.22.11.1.22.23.23.4.13.11.

I told you,Matter of in∣struction. from thePage 2. beginning, that this seasonable Precept, Believe in God, believe also in me, was cloathed with Evan∣gelical instructions; It is so: Take the words (2) absolutely, and they are our instructi∣on; they teach us, that, believe in God, be∣lieve in Christ, we must: but, consider them as opposed against the distractions of the Disciples hearts, you will then learn, that This1 Joh. 5.4 is the victory which overcometh all our troubles, even our faith. How great a comfort faith is against the greatest troubles of mind, will appear from theSee page 6 various occasions of this Text.Occasion. One wasLuke 22.24 ambition disappointed: The hearts of these Disciples hab been trou∣bled with worldly interests: They hadLuke 24.21 Acts 1.6. dreamed hitherto, of glorious preferments up∣on earth: they had beenLuke 22.24 striving which of them should sit nearest unto their en∣throned
Lord; I say, these Disciples, al∣though theyMat. 16.16 John 6.69 knew Jesus as the Son of God,, yet (notMat. 20.9 knowing the Scrip∣tures) they aimed at worldly greatnesse; they, as yet fancied, that,Matth. 20.21 Mark 9.34 Acts 1.6 Surely Christ would, in good time, reign gloriously upon earth: To follow this (to themMat. 2.2 known, to othersMat. 27.11 unknown) King of the Jews, they hadMark 10.28, 30 forsaken all, and, in so do∣ing, they hadMat. 20.21 Luke 22.29 promised unto them∣selves no small advancement. Now, when theyJohn 13.31 learn that God would straight∣way glorifie their long attended Master, not with Thrones, but with Thornes; not with a royal Diadem, but by (12) sufferings: when they, in stead of seeing Christ restore the Kingdom unto Israel, hear himMat. 16.21 John 13.1.33 14.2. contriving his departure out of this world; when, instead of being exalted by their Lord, they must, by him, beMat. 13.36, 37 shortly left at a losse; this was unto them a consternation of spirit; the failing of this their long expe∣ctation made theirPro. 13.12 heart sick; this, this was one reason, why our Saviour mindeth them, to their comfort, ye believe in God. Secondly, Whereas these were they which,Occasion. of all men, hadLuke 22.28 continued with Christ in his Temptations; Christ now twitteth them; how, of them, one shouldJohn 13.21 betray him, another shouldJohn 13.38. deny him, all shouldMat. 36.31 forsake him; These wereMar. 8.38 Rev. 21.8 hard
sayings: Their meek Master had deserved no such uncomely neglects from them: And now, long at last, that He should passe so hard a censure upon them! full illMat 26.22 could their ingenuous spirits brook these black impu∣tations: this (you see) was another occasion of their sorrows; another cause why Jesus Christ encourageth them to believe, as in God, so, in Himself. Thirdly,Occasion. The Scene was nowErasm. Marlorat. Jansen. in lo∣cum. Tra∣grcal; a forsaking, a denying, a betraying of Christ could boad no good: What the is∣sue might be who could tell? if he who hath no Sword, is by the Patient Jesus,Luke 22.36 all∣armed to buy one, matters must necessarily threaten some evill; Jesus himself wasJohn 13.21 troubled in Spirit; well, therefore might his Disciples be affrighted: That a third reason of this consolation; Ye believe in God.Occasion. Fourthly,Leoatius, Elsthym. Theodor. Mop∣suest. &c. in lo∣cum. They were not nowJoh. 2.25 to learn, that, their Master could cer∣tainly divine; If Jesus spake it, they mightMat. 24.35 believe it: for a whileMat. 26.35. flat∣ter themselves they might, but, on second thoughts, their hearts might well mis-give them: Their eyes had already seen Judas turning himself intoJoh. 13.20 a Traytor: what wasMat. 20.23 foretold of Judas, that Judas was nowMar. 14.11 perpetrating; By the same rule, what wasMar. 14 16. presuged of them, that they
also shouldMat. 26.56 too soon be guilty of: Or be it, that Judas had aforetimeMat. 26.8. been false, Peter he had persevered; None moreJohn 6.68 zealous, yea none moreMat. 14.29 daring then was Peter; neverthelesse, Si∣mon Peter he had hisJohn 13.38 doom: Now, if Simon Peter could not stand, well might they expect to fall: The Devil had already been busie withLuke 22.32 Cephas; should Satan sift themLuke 22.31. as wheat too; they, alas, would soon appear butMat. 3.12 Jer. 23.28 chaffe. Fear whispered unto them, what dastards (for ought any courage they had) they would make of themselves: Guilt, shame, unmanlinesse, wereMark 14.50 John 13.28 18.8. already at their heels: That a fourth circumstance wherefore our Saviour here useth this supporting Instruction, As ye believe in God, believe also in me. In the next place,Occasion. if the young Prophets sought so unreasonably after2 Kings 2.17 the late Head of their Colledge; loth, very loth might these Disciples be, to think of part∣ing withGorran. Tirinus. Mal∣donat. Janse∣nius in locum. their dear Lord and Master: As yet, they walked more by sight, then by faith: although they knew Christ asJohn 6.69 a Son of God, they knew him after theMat. 16.22 flesh too: He had affectionatelyJohn 15.16 ga∣thered them under hisMat. 23.37 wings, and it was warmJohn 14.20 being there: A Master so meek, so mercifull, so tender-hearted, so endearing, so communicative, so infinitely knowing, so mi∣raculously
Powerfull; WoMat. 16.22 John 14.5. were it with them, should they part with such a Tea∣cher! No living for them, but, at the Son of GodsMat. 6.68. Acts 20.38 ell-bowe: Now to hear this their dear Lord talk thus of leaving of them, of going away, of going away they could notJohn 13.33, 36 14.5.8. imagine whether; This a fifth grief of mind; if the Bridegroom wasMat. 9.15 upon going, the children of the Bride-chamber could notGen. 42.36 chuse but mourn: they had no pa∣tience (they) to hear of Jesus Christs depar∣ture; This I reckon a fifth Argument why they were solaced: Believe in God, believe also in me. Again,Occasion. The hour was now almostJohn 13.1 Matth. 26.2 come, wherein the Son of Man must be crucifi∣ed: A long time had beenJohn 16.21. Mark 9.31 spent in preparing these Apostles for this tryal; It had been, as warily, as frequently hinted unto them, that Christ should suffer many things in Je∣rusalem, and should after that, suffer death it self: Wherefore, asJohn 16.33 anon he animateth them. Be of good chear (in the world ye shall find trouble, but, be of good chear,) so he now comforteth them, Let not your heart be trou∣bled: quasi,Bda, Au∣gust. &c. in locum. ye are already startled at late events; but, worse evils are yet to come: if malice be hotLuke 23.31 against a green tree, it will be set on fire against the dry branches: You my servants will be moreMat. 10.24 John 15.20. de∣spitefully persecuted then (am I) your Ma∣ster: whosoever killeth you, willMat. 16.2. think he
doth his God good service; but, even then when my sufferings shall portend yours, Let not your heart be troubled, neither be yeMat. 14.27. dismayed; but, believe in God, believe also in me. Lastly, When ye shall take more thought for me then for your selves;Occasion. When ye shallRupertus in locum, ut & G otius. see me delivered up into the hand ofMat. 26.45 sinners, viz. of inveterate, and most implacable Adversaries: when ye shall see me numbred among Transgressours, condemn∣edLuke 23.4, 14 contrary to Law; when ye shall see me nailedJohn 20.25 to the Crosse; lifted upJohn 3.14 upon the Crosse, and byActs 2.23 unjust handsPhil. 2 8 crucified, crucified even unto death; to a death asHeb. 12.2 reproachful as languishing, as languishing as painfull, then weepLuke 23.28 not for me, then let not your heart be trou∣bled, no not for my sake; but, let this be your refuge, Believe in God, believe also in me. Thus, from the seven-fold coherence of these words; from their foregoing and fol∣lowing Context, very evident it is, that, our greatest1 John 5.4 comfort against our greatest dis∣comforts; is, faith, Faith rolleth away every stone which presseth heavily upon us; to be∣lieve in God, to believe in Christ, this is life, life more abundant. Object. If it be so, why am I thus?Object. If Faith hath a power so soveraign to expell all
troubles, why? yea, why are believing hearts so often troubled? Answ. 1.Answ. 1. They are troubled on every side, but2 Cor. 4.8 not distressed; perplexed they are, but not altogether without help; cast down, but not forsaken. Answ. 2.Answ. 2. All men have not faith; Many Professors there are, but, few believers, I wiss: The faith of most Christians is a faith of their own forging, not this spirit2 Cor. 4.11, 13 of faith here in my Text, viz. That which guardeth every blow from off the heart, must be a1 Thes. 5.8 breast-plate of faith and love, and of this breast-plate, the generality of Believers, (for Believers they seem unto others, and Believers they seem unto themselves) I say, of this breast-plate of Salvation the genera∣lity of Believers are utterly frustrated; , , Most true is that of Saint Augustine, It seemeth good, saithSt. Augu∣stin. de Civitate dei. lib. 1. cap. 7. he, It seemeth good unto the Almighty Providence, to prepare such Blisse in the world to come, as the just only shall enjoy, and not the unjust; and such torments, as the unjust only shall feel, and not the just: but, as for things temporal, these the divine providence distributeth both to the just, and unjust;Mat. 5.45. viz. that temporal blessings may not be too vehemently desired: loe, even the wicked are sometimes happy in this world: again, that worldly evils may not be too much avoyded, e∣ven,
the dearest of Gods children are sometimes afflicted in this world. Beloved, hence, hence it is, thatEccl. 9.2 All things come alike to all; that, both adversity and prosperity seem promiscuously common to him thatibid. sa∣crificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not; to the clean, and to the unclean; to the righteous, and to the wicked: In the mean while, as I have alreadyviz. from page 57. for∣wards. argued at large; Look how much unbelief reigneth in the heart, so much the heart is troubled.

First, Comfort even for the heart of unbelief.Of Com∣fort. He that believeth not,Even for Un∣believers, viz. against their Unbelief. isJohn 3.18 condemned already, because he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God: yea, but [as desperate a sinner as thou art] this is thy comfort, that, the very circumstances of this one Text alone, mind thee, invite thee,
nay urge and constrain thee to believe in Jesus Christ as inEsay 55.7, 8, 9 Ezek. 18.21, 22 a Mediatour, ready to seek and save even thy lost Soul. Here are four circumstances, within the compasse of my Text, which do, in Christ his stead, beseech thee to be reconciled unto Him. 1 Circumstance. The main occasion of all these troubles,Circumstance. which thou seest thus tumbling in here upon these Disciples, viz. Jesus ChristsJohn 13.1 being made an offering for sin: His hour was come: and it wasMat. 16.21 compared with John 13.21, and 14.1 against the sad sight of his ineffable sufferings, that He here engageth his Disciples, Let not your heart be troubled. Sinner, Bethink thy self: Jesus Christ his sufferings1 John 22 are thy par∣don. Come unto him, thou that art heavy la∣denMar. 11.28 Christ will ease thee: Hate sin, that ChristAct. 26.18 may pardon it: Did the Lord Christ suffer the death of his body, and the fierce wrath of his own Father, all to keep thee from Hell, and wilt thou again pawn thy Soul unto the Devil1 Pet. 5.1 for some tri∣fling sin? Are fire and brimstoneMatth. 25.30 Jude 15. Esay 30.33 2.19. and everlasting darknesse such flea-bitings? Are Peace and Glory andRev. 21.7 everlasting Joy so contemptible, that, whatsoever the Son of God hath suffered, should not at all concern thy soul? Cast off thyDan 4.27 Esay 30.22 sins, thine unpro∣fitable sins: for, for Thee Christ dyed; Thy, Thy Soul, the Mercifull Jesus would pardon! Thirst,Dan 55.1 Revel. 22.17 thirst after Righteousnesse;
that Christ may impute it: Jesus Christ hathIsa. 53.4 born thine iniquities; and wilt thou pluck them from off His shoulders, to (a∣gain) place them upon thine own? Oh, ra∣ther, set thy face toward Heaven; and look, look up, uponZech. 12 10 Him, whom Thou hast pier∣ced: Let Christ but see onceEsay 53.11 of the travel of his Soul, and He shall be satisfied, and thou too. The Son of God dyed, and dyed to save thee from thy sins. That is one Inducement to forceFoelix est periculum ad Deum consuge e. thine heart of un∣belief, to seek the Lord while he may be found. 2. Circumstance. Although this was, or was near upon,Circumstance. the same night wherein he was betrayed, from the beginning of Chap. 13. unto the end of Chap. 17. Christ taketh much thought, not for his dying self, but for his sinfull Disciples. Sinner, it will not repent him that He layed down his life for thy sake, if, where He hath layed it down, there, thou wouldest take it up: for thy preservation he is solicitous, for his own he was not. 3. A third Circumstance. Three other E∣vangelists,Circumstance. three other faithfull Pen-men Je∣sus Christ had of his most holy Gospel; but, such a subject as this; This, the turning of his bowels, the unbosoming of his loving Kind∣nesses! so choyce a portion of the Gospel. as is this, He peculiarly reserveth for his fittest Pen man! His bosome Evangelist, his beloved
Disciple, his darling JOHN shall be the Author of this Evangelical Scripture; and (this) purposely, that, such a desperate Cai∣tiffe, as thou hast been, mayJohn 20.31 believe, and conceive hopes. 4 Circumstance. The tender compassion of Christ Jesus over the present troubles of these Disciples hearts.Circumstance. Sinner, The heart which melteth to see a wound lanced, will never have the power to see a Sword ripping up thine en∣trails: What troubles these Disciples here met with, were but only the troubles of this world; yet (see here) the swooning of Christs bowels! (Tell me) Would not Jesus Christ endure, that these should perplex their hearts; and will he take any pleasure in the eter∣nal torments of thy lost Soul? (Believe it) the merciful Jesus doth not willingly afflict. To, be gracious he waiteth; at thy death he aimeth not. Thy Spirit had long since failed be∣fore him, had not He forborn to strike; I tell thee, Thy case, thy state of unbelief, is so desperate, that, God deferreth his just anger unto the very last minute! He knoweth, should∣est Thou to Hell once, thou art (then) a lost man for ever: After death, no redemption. Thy sins are so great, that Christ would (if possible) forgive them; although thou ima∣ginest not so. He would, if thou wouldest assent, heal all thy back-slidings, lest other∣wise thy Soul, thy wretched Soul, should, unto
all eternity be tormented, miserably tormented in Hell, in the nethermost Hell. If the Disci∣ples afflictions move Christ unto compassion, know, the vengeance due unto thy sins pier∣ceth his heart; Shouldest thou to Goale once, thou wouldest be sure to be condemned and executed; wherefore, ere ever thou art questioned for thy life, Thy Jesus would pro∣cure for thee the Kings pardon: nay, He hath procured it, and willeth thee to accept it upon the Kings terms. Sinner, if thou hast grace to believe any one of these Cir∣cumstances, these Circumstances will be unto thee Life from the dead. Secondly, Life of comfort for Believers.For Be∣lievers.

What it was to be bereaved of so good a Master, you haveviz. p. 235. already seen; but This was not all: When Jesus had escaped death, wasLuke 24.21 beyond all hopes, raised from the Grave; was, be∣yond all hopes, restored unto them again, for his Disciples then again to lose Him, to lose Him whomCant. 3.4 their Soul had found, Him whoRevel. 1.18 was dead and is alive, and behold he liveth for evermore!

So dealeth the most li∣beral Lord God by us, as we deal by our little children; We finde employments for our very little children, not for any service which little Infants can do us, but, for that we do naturally delight to give them all possible encouragement: We do every minute put them upon duty, that we may every mi∣nute feed them with Rewards.

When these Disciples wereJohn 13.38 foretold, that [as well resolved as they were] they should forsake Christ; when they had heard, with∣in how small a space, Cephas should, thrice at once deny his Master; then there arose in their heart fears and jealousies, doubtings and despair; They then began to suspect, that they should fall more grievously then Peter; but, Jesus Christ doth (you see) support them.

Beloved, These three generals are the particular limits of my remaining Discourse; the which our God [the God of all grace and glory] so sanctifie unto us all, that his most blessed Name may be, by every one among us, more and more abundantly glorified. GOD is said to be glorified both by Himself, and by his Creatures: 1.In what sense God is said to be glorified. By Himself. If we cast into the Ocean one only spoon∣ful of water, nay,By himself. one only drop of a bucket, we thereunto add; because, although the Sea be great and wide, infinite it is not: but, unto Gods essential glory none can add; for his glory is, likeAcquaint thy self with God as be is described by B. ushers folio. Christian Relig∣on, Bishop Baily his Practice of Piety, Mo nay his Trunesse of Christian Religi∣on, Balls larger Catechism, or such others; for, It is life e∣ternal to know God. viz. Velun∣tas sequitur in∣tellectum. every other of his Attributes, every way infinite. It is more impossible, infinitely more impossible, for any, yea for all the Creatures in the world, to add either glory, or blessednesse (that I may not say delight, or content) un∣to the most infinite God, then it is for the darkest Dungeon to augment the brightnesse, or for the blackest coal to multiply the beams of the mid day Sun: There can be no accession unto his essential blessednesse, because he is
for ever most infinitely blessed! There can be no accession unto his glory, because His glory is eternally the same!

The great God who, from all never-be∣gun Eternity unto the beginning of time, took pleasure in forbearing to make any Creature at all, did not at lastGen. 1.1 John 1.1 Heb. 1.2 11.2 make the Heavens and the Earth, as repent∣ing himself of his eternity of leisure before; neither did his then Creation proceedSt. August. de civitate Dei. lib. 12. cap. 17.

these) only applyeth his eternal Will unto new workings: AsRom 11.36 of him, and through him, so to him are all things; yet, of all those things which he hath made, and doth govern, it is His Glory that hePsalm 50.12 Job 12.2, 3 need∣eth none.

Beloved, sincere friendship is inquisitive after the health of the body, butPhil. 1.19 more, far more, after the health of the soul: You that ask me, How I do, if my3 Joh. 2.4 2 John 4 soul prospereth, ye are glad of it: Oh then, whatEph. 6.18 sins ye would have most prayed against, enform me; as likewise, whatEph. 6.19. graces you have most need of. What devices of Satan you2 Cor. 2.11 have found out, what back-doors ye have disco∣vered in yourJer. 17.9 treacherous hearts, what2 Pet. 2.9 escapes from temptation, whatJer. 31.19 helps to Repentance, what2 Pet. 1.10 advantages towards Duty, whatPsalm 27.13 supports of faith, what2 Pet. 3.18 1.8. growth of grace ye have obser∣ved within your selves, that, cordially impart unto your bosome-friends. So many of you as understand what1 Tim. 6.18 Heb. 13.16 belongeth unto the neighbourhoods of Piety, engrosse not that experience unto your selves, which may be∣nefit others. Freely ye have received,Matth. 10.8 freely give. The Lord is with them thatPsalm 34.4 uphold my soul; Come and hearken all ye that fear God, I will declare what hePsalm 66.16 hath done for my soul. What ye believe, that en∣joy; ye believe the Communion of Saints; in such Communions our1 Thes 4.9 God is glo∣rified.
Thirdly, When in the worship of the most holy God our self-accusations, confes∣sions, complaints, intercessions, supplications, and petitions are, for the matter and form of them, Scripture-proof, and go not out ofPsalm 17.1 feigned lips; then doRom. 10.10 See Matth. 6.6 our words glorifie our God; and more, whenMatth. 18.20 jointly with others, then when separately by our selves a∣lone; more, when inGen. 18.19 Josh. 24.15 our open fami∣lies, then, in our retired closets; more, when in ourPsalm 107.32 26.12 publique congregations, then, when in our private families. I wasPsalm 122.1 glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. Object. That house of the Lord was erected by Gods immediate command, our Steeple∣houses not so. Answ. 1. That Command was2 Tim. 3.16 Rom. 15.4 writ∣ten for our learning. Answ. 2. As the Temple at Jerusalem was aEsay 56.7 House of prayer unto all Nations, viz. anEsay 62.10 Ensigne lifted up upon Mount Zion, to draw in all thePsalm 22.27 Esay 55.5 Zech. 2.11 Gentiles unto the then true worship of the only true God: So among us, Houses set apart for divine worship are1 Cor. 14.23, 24 10, 20, 21 11.19 Revel. 14.6 John 15.22 Cant. 1.8 Jer. 13.11 Gods witnesses, and Ensignes set up to leave inexcusable, may to reclaim Sectaries, Papists, Jewes, Turks, Pagans, and Atheists from the errour of their way, unto, pure wor∣ship of the God of truth.
Answ. 3. It is fully asActs 9.20 13.5 15.2 18.4 lawful for us to have our several Churches for the convenience of our several Villages, as it was for the Jewes to have theirPsal. 74.8 Matth. 4.23 9.35 Mark 1.21, 39 Luke 4.16 7.5 John 18.20 di∣vers Synagogues for the convenience of their divers Cities. Answ. 4. Compare Deut. c. 17.14. with c. 12.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. In 2 Sam. 7. compare v. 3, 7, 10, with v. 2. and v. 6. with Acts c. 1.13. and c. 2.1. Compare 1 Thes. 1.9.When the Temples of dumb Idols are like those Censers, Numb. 16.37, 38, 39, 40. con∣secrated unto the living God, they are unto us me∣morials of Thankfulnesse. with 1 Cor. 11, 17, 18, 22. compare Esay 66.1. with Hag. 1.4. and, although I know assuredly that the glory of the Gospel consisteth not in pomp, but in truth; not in things carnal, but in things spiritual; yet compare Hag. 1.4. Prov. 3.9. Luke 8, 3. Rom. 15.27. 1 Cor. 9.11. John 12.7. 2 Cor. 8.9, 12. Phil. 4.17. with Psalm 72.10, 15. and with 2 Cor. 3.9, 10, 11.

In the room of the Levitical Priesthood Jesus ChristMat. 10.1 Acts 1.8 Ephes. 4.11 1 Cor. 12.28 ordained a Mi∣nistery; in the stead of Circumcision, he brought inJohn. 4.2 Mark 16.16 Matth. 3.16 28.19 1 Pet. 3.21 Baptism; and, in the place of the1 Cor. 5.7, 8 11.24, 25. Passeover he instituted his Holy Supper; Now, those being required, it were super∣fluous to enjoyn time and place; these are naturally coincident: if God was solemnly magnified in the Messiah yet to come, the Messiah being already come, God must much
more be magnified. A Testament we still have, and thatHeb. 9.15 not the old, but a new one; If God take away the first, it is that he mayHeb. 10.9 establish the second: If old things are passed away,2 Cor. 5.17 new things doth he de∣clare. Object. That Christ ordained a Ministery, Baptism, and the Eucharist, we read; we read not that he appointed, Festivals, Meeting-places, no nor yet the Lords-day. A. This new Covenant, which the Lord now maketh, puts such lawes as theseHeb. 8.10, 11 into our inward parts; Should wePsalm 30 4 give thanks at the remembrance of his Holinesse, and not second Jewish rites with Christian Festi∣vals; the Sabbath celebrating the Creation, with our Lords day celebrating the Redemption; their Tabernacle, Temple and Synagogues, with our Churches set apart for divine worship, we should deny our gracious and merciful Lord the tribute ofRom. 12.1 1 Cor. 14.20, 37 Heb. 8.11 Esay 35.8, 10 our reasonable service. Object. Unto a publique worship we assent, but not unto set-forms.Dub. Answ. 1. Divine Worship without set-forms will scarcely deserve the name of a publique worship, so soon will it1 Cor. 14.26 Rom. 14.19 Phil. 2.4 crumble into private sects and factions.

Examine and you will find, Ʋn∣to that Congregation which joyneth with him in prayer, the extemporary prayer of the best gift∣ed Minister upon the whole earth, is aYea, what are those Psalmes, Hymns, and spiritual Songs, wherein we should Ephes. 5.19. speak unto our selves, but professedly set-forms? set form. Answ. 3. Such as condemn set-forms, do not consider, that, unto a heart intent upon spi∣ritual desires, it is one and the same thing to shape, cloath, and word thoseAs for God, he, Psalm 139.2, 4. knoweth our thougets be∣forehand, Matth. 6.8 spiritual desires in the foreknown phrase of a Liturgy; and in the new found phrase of an extemporary petition. In all his providences, the mighty GodActs 15.18 applyeth his eternal Decree unto new workings: in like manner, devout souls do, in the use of LiturgiesRom. 12.11, 12 1 Pet. 4.7 Col. 4.2 1 Cor. 14.15 Acts 1.14 Rom. 15.6 apply set and prepared formes unto fresh and new eja∣culations. Answ. 4. That thine heart may not be hasty to utter any thing before the dreadful God; be notEccl. 5.1, 2 rash with thy mouth; that thou mayest not be rash with thy mouth, let thy words be few; and, since few they must be, find outEccl. 12.10 Rom. 12.1 acceptable words, e∣ven words of truth; and such thou wilt find in the Liturgy of our English Church. Take with you words,Hos. 14.2 saith Hosea. Answ. 5. I have seen, indeed a cool DiscoursePrinted 1662. but . of, or rather against the Im∣position of Liturgies; but, while it seemeth
to plead for the glory of the Spirit in Gos∣pel-times, unto me it seemeth toRom. 16.17, 18 14.19 un∣dermine the glory of the Gospel, and of the Spirit too: for, First, Lamentable, andSo late as our last civil Wars. late expe∣rience evinceth, that, in Gospel-worship, a1 Cor. 14. v. 26. compa∣red with v. 1. & with c. 13.1. want of Ʋniformity disturbeth Gospel-peace: and we must needs know that a want of peace with the Gospel, eclipseth the1 Cor. 12. v. 25. compared with v. 31. See Hammond upon Revel. 19 6, 7, 8, 9 glory of the Gospel. Secondly, That, in these last dayes, God poureth out more of his Spirit then he did then, when [taking them by their armes] heHos. 11.3 taught Ephraim to go, is a truth:Acts 2.17 unquestionable: Neverthelesse, a lesser mea∣sure of Gods Spirit in the dayes of Temple∣worship, was2 Chion. 6 41 compared with Psalm 132.8 and with Num. 10.35, 36, &c. 6.24, 25, 26, 27. and with both the Psalms of degrees, and the Titles of divers other Psalmes. no reason at all of the set forms therein used: For under the Law, if notPsa. 106.30 1 Sam. 2.27 2 Kings 4.22 their Priests, (sure I am) their Prophets were endued with the holy Spirit in a greater measure, then since the Apostles dayes, ordinarily any of us Christians are: Wherefore, if the duty and ability of Gos∣pel-Ministers be a sufficient bar against set forms under the Gospel; then had the duty and ability ofGen. 20.2 compared with 1 Sam. 12 23 and with 1 Chron 25.1 all their Prophets, and of some of their Priests been a greater bar a∣gainst the imposition of Psalmes, and ofSee Mr. John Gregory upon 2 Sam. 1.13 other set forms in their Temple-worship.
Thirdly, Whether Primitive Churches did, or did not make use of Liturgies; we of this Age and Kingdome have seen what will again quickly befall us, if we do not all of us persist toPhil. 3.16 walk by the same Rule, to mind the same things, yea, and1 Cor. 1.10 to speak the same things too. I conclude: While those1 Cor. 12.28 compare 1 Tim. 3.1 with Eph. 4.8, 11, 12 helps, and governments which the good hand ofMatth. 28.20 Rom. 13.1 our God placethCompare Rom. 13.1, 2, 5, and Heb. 13.17. with Deut. 17.8-12 over us, have, in a forme of wholsome words, taught us how to pray, in so doing, they have imitated no worse an example then that of Saint John the Bap∣tist, yeaLuke 11.1, 2, and John Gregory upon Matth. 6.13 then that of Jesus Christ him∣self: and Christ (ye know) is as the Head of his Church, so the Mouth and Wisdome of his Father. Hitherto of glorifying God more remotely with our words: properly, and more immediate∣ly we glorify our God with our words, when we sacrifice unto him the calves of our lips; and then weHos. 14.2 sacrifice unto him the calves of our lips; 1. When we render thanks for the est gra∣tum se decla∣rare accepto beneficio, illad agnoscendo, & authorem ejus praedicaudo. Nam in hoc differt gratulatio religiosa à gratutatiobus civilibus. In bisce solemus fortaam vel industriam, vel prudentiam illorum belebrare quibus bonum aliquod mag∣aum obtisse laetamar: at gratulat a  aliud sunt quam simplices gra∣tiarum actiones, quibus celebrant benigaitatem Dei Patris qui doaavit hominibus bona spiritualia. Davenantius in Coloss. 1.3. great benefits which we have received at his hands. 2. When we set forth his most worthy praise: for, praise is the reflection of that which is praise-worthy.
3. When we tell of the Honour due unto his Name; for honour is more then praise: praise commendeth what is good, honour esteem∣eth what we commend. 4. When we blesse him as exalted above all blessings: for blessing is more then ho∣nour. Honour admireth that God whom we praise, blessing adoreth that God whom we ad∣mire. Men blesse men by their mutual pray∣ers; God blesseth man imperatively, he bles∣seth when he maketh blessed; Man blesseth God optatively; then man blesseth God, when he rejoyceth to know and make known how blessed a God God is. Thanksgiving may be a forced act of meer justice; Praise verbal comple∣ment; Honour the result of a generous mind; but blessing includeth these and more: Bles∣sing includeth an unfeigned thankfulnesse, a serious praising, a respectiful honouring, and a reverend acknowledgement. Praise may be mat∣ter of complement; Blessing is matter of de∣votion: ye that fear the Lord, blesse ye the Lord. But secondly, not ye who fear not the Lord.In works. He that is one ofPsalm 15.1, 2 this Quire, must be cloathed in white; for, Thanksgiving consisteth more in good works then in good words: Be∣twixt works and words theGen. 18.14  holy language putteth no difference at all; Thou, until thou depart from iniquity, hast2 Tim 2.19 no right at all to name the Name of Jesus Christ; So long as
thou hatest instruction, what hast thou to do toPsalm 50.16, 17 take his Covenant in thy mouth? Though thou sayestJer. 5.2 the Lord liveth, surely thou swearest falsly. Quest. Wherein? Answ. (It is a dis∣paragement to be well spoken of by an un∣worthy person;) if thou livest not unto him, little will the world believe, that thy God is a living God, As praise isPsalm 33.1 comely for the upright, soPro. 17.7  Nullus fatuus timet peccatum. excellent speech becom∣eth not a fool.

Ah, with whatJames 3.10 face can an unrighteous wretch speak good of the most righteous Lord? or, a cursed unbeliever of the blessed God? Know, that man whom the Lord setteth apart, for himself, isPsalm 4.3 the godly man: Wouldest thou, that salvation should be shewed unto thee? see, that thou orderest thy conversation aright; He, and only be, who offereth this sort of praisePsalm 50.23 glo∣rifieth God.
Thirdly, Nor canst thou thus order thy conversation,In heart. until thou keep thy heartPro. 4 23 first, . with all diligence; True, he that doeth righte∣ousnesse, is righteous even as he1 Joh. 3 7 3 John 11. is righ∣teous; but (loe) such a Righteousnesse must be the work of the sanctifying Spirt upon thine inward parts. Then will David sing and give praise when his heart isPsal. 57.7 prepared and fix∣ed. The God ofPsal. 109.1 thy praise is a God, not of the dead, butLuke 20.38 of the living; He is not forHeb. 6.1 dead works; He accepteth of no duty which is notHeb. 11.6 the fruit of faith; and of no faith which is not theRom. 8.9 fruit of the Spirit. The carcasses of good works take not at allEsay 1.11-19 with God: Therefore, when∣soever thou wouldest honour him with thy lips, or in thy deeds, let not then thyEsay 29.13 heart be far from him. They must be well affected that glorifie theEsay 1.19 Victo que vo∣lentes Per po∣pulos dal jura.

Thou [who, as becometh a dear child, followest hard after God] that, thy mouth may praise him withPsal. 5. joyfull lips, let thy soul, (I say) let thyPsal. 35.9 soul be joyfull in thy God. What thou dost▪ do it inEph. 6.5 singlenesse of heart, as unto Christ; do itCol. 3.17 heartily, as unto the Lord! Fear the Lord, andHos. 3 5 his goodnesse; When thou with thy

Thus, thus, O Christian, let us, let us daily give thanks unto that God, whoPsal. 68.19 daily loadeth us with his Benefits!Psal. 148.13 let us daily praise that God, whose Name alone isPsal. 104.1 excellent o∣ver all the world! let us daily honour that God, who is [33] cloathed with Majestie and Honour! and let us daily, daily let us bless that God, whom the Angels in heaven joy and delight toPsal. 103.20 Revel 5.11 15.2 reverence and a∣dore!
Thus, yea thus, O Christian, let us, now and ever, glorifie our God, thy God and mine; He that is Our God, is thePsalm 68.20 God of salvation! Who is so great a God as isPsalm 77.13 Our God? Let the Lord, in whose hand is our breath, and whose areDan. 5.23 all our wayes, let thePsalm 70.4 Lord be glorified. Blesse the Lord all ye his works, in all places of his Dominion;Psalm 103.22 blesse thou the Lord, O my soul. How the Lord must be by us glorified, we have seen: The next is, why.Wherefore God must be by us glorified. Beloved, To produce many Arguments wherefore we should all of us make it the whole businesse of our whole lives to glorifie this great and dreadfull Name, The Lord our God, were to question, whether we are indued with rea∣son, or no; To produce none, were, to de∣ny our affections: a few, then. First, Seeing he,Reason 1. who is the Father of us all, is a God, the only God; Why may he not be, by us, glorified? Might all men,From no rea∣son to the contrary. and, with them, all Angels, evil and good, lay all their forces together, they could not, if they would, produce one piece of an argu∣ment why the Lord our God may not be by us glorified. Seriously, then, let this be our first motive: Therefore, therefore let us glorifie our God, because there isEsay 41.21 no rea∣son in the world to the contrary.
A second reason,Reason 2. why the Father of all things must be by us glotified,From creatures void of reason. I deduce from all creatures void of reason. Reason is entrusted, not with them, but with us; neither can they, but by usSola pro∣secto actio De∣um in hac vi∣tâ glorificandi gloriosa nobis esse poterat co∣rona, quâ meri∣tum nostrum cumulatissimè remuneratum esse credere pos∣semus.

Large Volumns they are, and very learned in the ineffable Name of the Great JEHOVAH; but, as every other Volumn, so, this Book of the Creature is serviceable, not unto it self, but unto us; a very fair Edition it is, an Edition publish∣ed for the Authors immediate glory; but this glory the Author expecteth, not from the Book, but from the Reader; if from so in∣comparable a Work as this is, we, for whose sake alone it is published, will derive no glory unto the Author; the incensed Author will burn, first the Reader, then the Book. I say, the Sense, Life, Motion, and being of every Creature whatsoever, are only the materials of Gods praise and glory; the praise and glory, which God deserveth from them, he demandeth from us; for it, not they, but, we are accomptable; it is a fearfull sin to de∣fraud God of that which ever was, is (1) and will be his own; we betray our trust, if by us God be not glorified.

God isEsay 28.29 excellent in working, but (as the Apostle1 Cor. 9.6 pleadeth for himself) hath
he not a power to forbear working? Verily he hath. Yet loe, he made, he preserveth, he governeth the curious wheels of the worlds most. Arist. de Caelo. lib. 2. cap. 14. exquisite Fabrique!

In a word, without faith it is impossible to please God; for, whatsoever is not of faith, is sin; viz. notoriously short of that reasonable service which the pure God may justly expect from every person, since every person hath rea∣son enough to thirst after the holy Spirit of Christ Jesus. Sirs, from those that do, or may, understand, that such a Spirit is to be sought,
but seek it not, all the honour which the Lord procureth, isRom. 2.8 Job 21.30 Jude 15.

Object. To pant after the holy Spirit of the holy God, is a work of Regeneration; and we are no more able to regenerate our selves, then to beget our own substance in our mothers womb. Answ. To regenerate our selves, in our power it is not: we are meerly passive in our spiritual, as well as in our natural birth: It is thoUt letum Deo detur, h∣minis volunta∣tem boaa & praeparat adju∣vandam, & adjuvat prae∣paratam.

Would a lost sinner patiently wait, in the use of these appointed meanes, should he never receive the Holy Ghost; yet still he had done what in him lay, he had submitted unto Christs Scepter, he had glorified his God to his power, he had made the best of a lost condition: But, the Scri∣pture offereth more grace: He that is faithful in a little natural abilities, shall be entrusted withLuke 119.17, 16 16.10 gifts above nature: True,See Man∣to upon James 2.4 confound nature with grace, we may not; sin∣ful man may not justle the holy God; may not reckon himself a co-adjutor, in that, where∣in God will have theSee Bi∣shop Reynolds Joy in the Lord, in quarto, mihi pag. 24.

God is infinitely a free Agent; free as the wind which bloweth where it listeth; so, we are bound, with all possible gratitude to confesse, that this free Spirit hath tyed himself upDeus promit∣teado se facit debitorem. un∣to the truth of his Promises; wherefore, we dare not but expect toEsay 64.5 meet God in those wayes, wherein his free goodnesse hath ap∣pointed us to find him. Saith one,Mr. Tillian a Dately of Ban∣bury, in his New Birth, cap. 9. mihi, p. 103. God hath appointed certain things to be done by men, which, they that will not refuse to do, may do; and the which they that shall do, shall be Re∣generate: For [saithibid. Neverthelesse, Paedissequa, noa praevia, volan∣tas, saith St. Aug. Epist. 106. he] There is a com∣mon work of Illumination which so maketh way for Regeneration, that it putteth into man a power of doing that, which when he shall do, the Spi∣rit of God shall mightily work within him; pro∣vided alwayes, that he damp not the present motions of the Word and Spirit of God with pro∣crastinations and delayes. It is much-what in Regeneration by the Spirit, as it is in gene∣ration of the flesh; the fruit of Sarahs womb is expresly the gift of God, but, there was first a generation before a conception; As to ex∣pect the fruit of the womb without generation, so to expect the Regenerating Spirit without the use of meanes, were to tempt, nay, to contradict, and to controle the wise God. Object. The wind bloweth where it listeth. Answ. Most true it is, that the blessed Spirit sanctifiethJohn 3.8 them whom, and them alone whom, he listeth to sanctifie; but, as
true it is, that whosoeverGal. 6.8 soweth to this Spirit, shall of this Spirit reap life everlasting. Object. He that will sow to the Spirit, must think a good thought; but, it is not in us of our selves2 Cor. 3.5 to think a good thought. Answ. Neither is it of our selves, that weActs 17.28 live, move, and have a being: Our self-insufficiency is so far from beingPhil. 2.12, 13 a bar against Duty, that it should excite us un∣to the use of all meanes possible: The more we want breath, the more we gasp for it: I opened my mouth and panted, for, IPsalm 119.131 When Anaxar∣chus the Philo∣sopher told the Treasurer, the gist which he expected from Alexander, was no lesse then an bradred talents, Alexander was very well pleas∣ed for, said he, He understand∣eth me aright; he understandeth that I am both able and willing to give him [Luke 11.13] so great a gist.

He both does, and will, if thouActs 5.32 wilt not resist: Know, where God free∣ly vouchsafeth the ministration of his Gospel, thereActs 11.18 28.28 2 Cor. 3.8, 9 Velle & currere meum est; sed ipsum meum sine Dei auxilio non erit meum.

If so, I doubt not but God will sanctifie thee by his truth: He that will do the will of his God, shallJohn 7.17 know it; and he that coveteth Gods Spi∣rit for Gods sake, shallEsay 44.3 have what he co∣veteth. Beloved, Of free grace it is thatActs 10.45 2 Pet. 1.3 God causeth his Gospel to shine among us; of free grace it is, that now while it shineth, we re∣reive from it any light of knowledge at all;
of free grace it is, that any lght of knowledge raiseth in any of us any good desires;Habems nos aliqud Dei; sed ab ipso; non à nobis, sed ex gratiâ ipsius, non ex nostiâ propretate. Tertul. cntr. Hermog. of free grace it is, if in us, and from us, proceedeth any thought, word, or deed that good is; but then, so abundant is this free grace of his, that, if we resist not, his free Spirit will succour, strengthen, stablish us in a firm resolution and practice of glorifying our Lord God.2 Cor. 4.6 I pronounce therefore, [and what I pro∣nounce, I vehemently believe to be true, viz.] that, who so, throughTrahitur miris modis ut velit ab illo qui novit imus in ip∣sis hominum cor∣dibus operari, non ut homines, quod fieri non potest, nol ntes credan, sid ut volentes ex no∣lentibus siant.

God infinitely delighteth to communicate good, giveth us occasion to glorifie him, that thereby He Himself may take occasion, First, to relievePsalm 50.15 our necessities: Many cha∣ritable Christians fall to building, planting, mounding, & sim. for no other cause, but, that they may relieve the needy in finding work for them: just so, the liberal GodEsay 32.8 de∣viseth libera things.

Thirdly, To render us profitable unto our own souls: thus, we educate our Children to bet∣ter, not us, but them: thus, we place windows in our mansion-houses to give light, not unto the day, but unto our dwellings: and thus, God setteth eyes in our heads to enlighten, not the Sun, but our selves: Of what use are all those things which we see, unto the eyes of a blind person? so, of what profit is the

Sixthly, To delight us: A Child is highly pleased, if you suffer him to feed himself with the Nurses spoon; To a man a very great satisfaction it is to view a house of his own good contrivance, to taste fruit of his own plant∣ing, &c. Now God, who both does all for us, and can do all without us, therefore glo∣rifieth himself in our duties, that we may be unto our selves the instruments of our own com∣forts: Oh, what a delight must it necessa∣rily be unto a Christian, to have a hand in fulfilling the good pleasure of his Redeemer? and to be anUben A∣lexander saw his Father Philip conquer enemies so fast, he complained that his Father would leave him no work to do; For, said he, what will it comfort me that I possesse the whole world, if I have no world to conquer with mine own bands?

Oh, what an en∣couragement is this, that, suchEph. 5.1 infants as we are, may be allowed to walk with the Father of Lights! Be we holy, be we perfect, as our heavenly Father is holy and perfect. Eighthly, To honour us: It is a most un∣speakable honour unto the lost sons of Adam, that any of them may be at any timeMalim ego cum Christo ruere, quàm cum Caesare stare. Lutherus.

The meanest Office imaginable about his sacred Majesties person, is therefore ho∣nourable, because it relateth unte a King: They are Bishops and Nobles who stand before our Prince; and we are Priests and Kings, if we attend our God.

2. In regard of Himself. God hath all the reason in the world to re∣quire man to glorifie his most blessed Name: for First, Although from the first minute of A∣dams fall unto this very instant, we cannot bring unto God the tribute from us due; ne∣verthelesse, it is most just with God to de∣mandHomo cum sis, id fac semper memine∣ris; Si me arguat Deus, non re∣darguitur à me, sed ex me potius just ficabitur. bid. from us that perfection of prayse, which while our first Father stood, we were enabled to surrender. Secondly, Seeing then when Adam was found guilty of Treason, the LordRom. 2.14 seized not upon the whole forfeiture, but left in us remainders of conscience, of memory, of under∣standing and of good affections; most equal it is, that whatsoever he leaveth with us, should be,. Clem. Alex. Strom. l. 7. not at our, but at his sole pleasure and command. Thirdly, God hath vouchsafed unto us the blessings of the earth, and of the heavens; the precious truths of his Word, the rich graces of his Spirit, and those unsearchable Treasures given unto us his only Son, uponQui esse vult fibi, & non tibi, O Deus, incipit nihil esse intr omnia.

Fourthly, What wise man ever built a house forTrue, the Tree which cumbreth the ground, shall be burnt; but the Lord diggeth, &c. about it, that it may bring forth fruit, Luke 13.8, 9. no purpose at all? Who planteth a
Vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit? Who feedeth a flock, and drinketh not of the milk? If God be a Lord, where is his fear? If a Fa∣ther, where is his honour? &c. Lastly, Let a Souldier do what becometh a Souldier; and let a Soveraign do as beseem∣eth the Majesty of a Prince: When, upon Darius his large offers, Parmenio had said, Surely I would accept these offers, were I as Alex∣ander; said Alexander,Plut.

Think upon it Sinners: Ought Jehovah to be glorified as he is absolutely, a God? as he is relatively, a Lord? and, dare any of you continue a Vessel of dishonour? Be ye not as things without life, but as living Creatures; be not as bruits, but as creatures reasonable and well affected; Be not as they unto whom no Go∣spel is preached, but as Gospel-professors; O let not the Gospel of Jesus Christ be hid unto you; but, let it be unto you the ministra∣tion of the Spirit.

Just so, The Question is not, whether a natural man can discern the things of God; for we are all of us born spiritually blind; no nor yet whether the Lords Christ can give sight unto the blind; for, unto God all things are possible; but, whe∣ther clay and spittle, even earthen Vessels may not then help men to their sight, when Christ so ordaineth: Sure I am, in every Ordi∣nance of His, the power of hisLuke 5.17 Spirit is ready to heal.

Seeing it is unto us so great a glory, to glorifie this God; Seeing it is unto us heaven upon earth; seeing it is unto us, Life more a∣bundant, to laud, praise, and blesse the Name of our God; I beseech you, Friends, Let us no more absent our selves from the Liturgie of our Church; but, let the Lord God have the glory of our open, publick, and solemn Thanksgivings: Yea, let us watch alwayes over our conversations, words and hearts, that atPsalm 34.1 71.6, 8, 15 109.30 96.2.145.2, 7, 9, 10, 21 119.164, 97 25.5 89.16 Nihil mihi fuit optatius, quàm, ut primum abs Te-ipjo, deinde à caeteris omnibus quàm gratissimus erga Te esse cognoscerer.

Sir, I willingly promise my self this blessing; because it farreth with those good Christians who bury their Friends, as it doth with us Ministers when we are crucified with Christ: Espy us in the Town, you see us in black, mourning for the sinfulnesse of the World; but, meet us in the Temple, you finde us in white, rejoycing at the purity of the Gos∣pel; just so, when good Christians have bu∣ried their dead, if their thoughts reach no fur∣ther then this World, well may they cloath themselves in mourning; but let their thoughts follow their dead unto their Fathers House, and then their grief and sorrowes are swallowed up in Joy and Rejoycings. From my Study, April. 3d. 1662.
COnsider this dear and worthy Gentlewoman, first, as She was a part of this world; next, as She was a Member of the Church; and thirdly, as She is present with the Lord within the mansions in her Fathers House; In every of these you will see plentiful matter layed be∣fore you, for the prayses of Our God. First, In the things of this Life. It is the glory of our God, that, while hePsalm 17.14. giveth unto the wicked their portion only in this life; He is also in the things of this life, sometimes bountiful, as well unto theMatth. 5.45 just, as unto the unjust; thus, he was untoGen. 13.2, 6 Abraham, and thus he was unto thisGal. 3.7 Daughter of Abraham. From the Cradle which first danced at the voyce of her cryes, unto the grave which now bewaileth her silence; little, very little cause there was why Her heart should be troubled. For instance; The more loyal our affections be toward our most gracious Soveraign Lord the King, the
more honour we have for that Sexe which gave conception and birth unto his sacred Ma∣jesties sacred Person. Adam, heGen. 3.20 calleth his wives name Evah: Why? Answ. Because she was the Grandmother of Christ, in whom all are made alive. Beloved, Let not the com∣munity of a Blessing bury that Blessing in ob∣livion; The Friend of whom we now speak, was a Daughter in Israel, to wit, One of that Sexe, which had, both the Happinesse, and the Honour, to bring the Great Redeemer of all mankind into the World. As for her lineage I am no Herald: yet, this I can say, as by wedlock, she matched into aFor she was married unto Michael Rutter of Bur∣ton on the Hill, in the County of Glou.

King. long descent; so She her Self was no Filia terrae: It is of God, that while one Family is low and obscure, another is superiour and exalted; This Gentlewoman was of the later, and supe∣riour sort; She was the branch, the off-spring of a very Generous Stock; I shall utter more then in other words I can so well expresse, if I tell you she was aOf which Fa∣mily, see Dug∣dals Surveigh of Warwicksh. HALES, a HALES no way over-reached by any speci∣ous pretences of hypocritical Rebels. Whereas the honesty of some great Ones is rugged, and the seed of their goodnesse un∣formed, for want of an early education, it was not so with this Friend; she was highly civilized: Indeed, Her education was, as well became Her Eminent birth, very singu∣lar;
[Furthermore] it was as successeful-as exquisite. Her wealth was suitable unto her birth: The blessing of the Lord made her rich, and he ad∣ded no sorrow with it. Her body, that body which now sleepeth in Jesus, was, herein a picture of her soul, up∣right and graceful. In the natural endowments of her mind, she surpassed many of her equals: She had a te∣nacious memory, an elegant fancy; a piercing judgement, and a deep understanding. Her acquired parts were no lesse remark∣able: She read much, and much unto her bene∣fit: witnesse her language alwayes apposite; witnesse her habitual transcendent elocution; and, from that again, the law of kindnesse which was ever in her lips, together with that charity, and that piety which so often per∣fumed her familiar Discourse. Although she could not be born, but, she must beJob 14.1 born to know sorrow, surely, goodnesse and mercy followed her all the dayes of her life: Even, in all his Dispensations toward her, so favourable unto her, were the providences of her God, that, most usually, her sorrowes and mourning were recompenced with joy and gladnesse. True: She knew the losse of Children; but, she neverEsay 47.8 sat as a Widow: Bury some Kinred she did, bury some Kinred [if she her self would live] she must; but, the
God of our life, which removed from her some Friends, exalted other of her Kinred, as surviving blessings. The same God which suffered her to close the eyes of her dearest Parents; instead of her Parents hath given unto her. Eurip. in Oreste. children, hope∣ful Children! She lived to see the captivityDuring our late Wars. of our Zion; but, as Moses from Mount Nebo did before his death, behold the promised Canaan; so, neither did she depart this life, until having, withHeb. 2.1 the Prophet, watched to see what the Lord would say, She did, withPsal. 85.8 the Psal∣mist, hear him speak peace unto his people, and to his Saints. As she prayed for the peace of our Jerusalem, so she saw her prayers answered; She left not this transitory world, until she had first seen that Deliverance which the great God hath most mercifully, and most miracu∣lously brought unto us, his most unworthy peo∣ple. Hitherto, you have chiefly seen what prai∣ses we owe unto the divine Majesty, in the behalf of this dear Friend for common mer∣cies; Beloved, although the bountiful God scattereth these blessings of his left hand, as well upon the evil, as upon the good; yet, when these worldly favours are placed in, and imparted unto an elect Vessel, they then begin to be spiritual Blessings. Wherefore, as God hath had the glory of his Benefits unto this singular Friend of ours in the things of this
life; so, blesse we the Name of the Lord for that large portion of true Riches which she received in things appertaining unto a bet∣ter life. Concerning things appertaining unto the Gospel. God was very gracious unto this singular Gentlewoman, for she was exceeding happy in. prudent and religious Parents: By them, not out of custome, but, out of a re∣ligious choyce, she was consecrated in Baptism un∣to their God; By them she was brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord: By them she was trained up in the way she should walk in, which way of holinesse she kept unto the end. Hence it was, that she was so great a lo∣ver of good Books, of goodScias ip∣sum plurimis virtutibus abun∣dare, qui alie∣nas sic amat. Plin. lib. 1. Ep. 17. men, of Lords dayes, of holy Festivals, and of holy Ordi∣nances: But, over and above these outward privi∣ledges of the Gospel, as she walked uprightly, so, the Lord God Her Sun and Shield, hadPsalm 84.11 vouchsafed unto her his free grace. I say, over and above these outward priviledges, she had that one blessing which maketh all the rest such; for, the holy God withheld not from her his holy, his blessed Spirit. The most merciful and most gracious Father of Lights did, by his good Spirit, lead her in the way that she should walk in: He guided her
obedient soul by His Counsel, and hath now received her unto his glory. That is the last, In the life of Glory. Of this, what shall I report? Might her blessed soul descend hither unto us, She would now tell us things, which cannot be by me uttered. What Our eyes have not seen, what Our eares have not heard, what our hearts cannot conceive, that would Her glori∣fied Soul reveal unto us: We [I trust] shall go to Her: She [you know] shall not come to us: only This, This is our Comfort, that, As Solomon removed the Ark from the Taber∣nacle unto the Temple, so, the Son of David, even the person speaking in my Text, He hath translated the soul of this Saint from her earth∣ly Tabernacle unto the mansions in his Fathers house; For this also, it is our Duty to give much thanks unto our God. Quest. But, how shall we best expresse this our thankfulnesse? Answ. By endeavouring, as she endea∣voured, after a sanctified enjoyment of every of Gods blessings. This Gentlewoman, whose whole life was a continued thankfulnesse unto the God of her mercies, may be unto us both a Motive unto religious thanksgivings, and an Example.
A Motive; for,. that this righteous Gentlewoman shall be had in everlasting re∣membrance, assuring us, that the prayse of a Gospel-Conversation endureth for ever. An Example, because she could, and did shew us Her faith by Her works, viz. She made the Blessings of this World ser∣viceable unto the blessings of the Gospel; and, When at any time troubles arose in her heart, she believed in God, she believed also in Christ. The greatest part of her Conversation, I say, the greatest part of it, was, not only a Practice, but a Pattern of Piety. Look upon her self-denyals. She was as I told you, very well descend∣ed; But, did any of you ever hear her boast∣ing her Ancesters? She had Wealth at will; but, Did she make it an occasion unto pride? With plenty she possessed the right, the humble, the spiri∣tual enjoyment of plenty. Others make it their businesse to be, not Christian, but vainly Gentile: but she, in∣stead of drowning a Christian in a Gentlewo∣man, taught Gentility to adorn Christianity. Others are more for the broidering of the hair, then for the Ornament of a meek Spirit; Was she so? Others are more for the pride of life, then for the beauty of holinesse: Was she so?
She was none of that sort of Gentry, which, like S. Chrysostomes SchoolmasterWhen Li∣ban us, who had tought Chryso∣stome in Phi∣loo by, was asked, who should succeed him in teaching? Libanius an∣swered, No one but Chrysostom had not the Christians won him to them. Platina in vita Zosomi. repute Christs Ministers therefore contemptible be∣cause Christs Ministers. She was very well educated; but, was she more a Courtier then a Saint? Could any prophane Esau keep her by her Chimney-side, then, when health allowed her to attend Gods Ordinances in Gods House? She had good elocution: But, was guile found in her mouth? I speak this to her praise, She detested hypocrisie in another much, in her self more. On the other side: She was a lover of good persons, becauseUt de pi∣ctore, aut de sculptore nisi artisex judicare [non possit;] ita, nisi sapiens, non possit perspiccre sapientem. Plin. lib. 1.

As she never spake evil of the absent, so she never interpreted the praise of another to be a diminution unto her self. One thing I ever observed in this Gentle∣woman, which I can by no meanes conceal: She was an absolute Governesse of her passions: The empty fallacies of mirthRes severa est verum gan∣dium. Seneca. deluded not
Her soul: Ever chearful she was, but still sober, still modest. She was that person, whose passion never, no not in her most retired fa∣miliarity, dissolved into any excesse. No jollities could make Her frolique. She had so wonderful a command over her lively Spirit, that, her moderation could not but be known unto all that knew Her man∣ner of living. Free from exceptiousnesse she was: in truth, Her vertues had no weaknesses to be jealous of: Small cause had she to suspect the whispers, or fear the mis-reports of others, being con∣scious unto her self of nothing, except of com∣linesse and integrity. You could not provoke her unto revenge: A discerning spirit she had, could see a neg∣lect as well as another; She could see it, but would not see it: Or, if too too palpable it was, she was so far from being overcome of evil, that, she would most industriosly seek, I had almost said, steal opportunities to overcome that evil with good. You have heard some part of her self-de∣nials: But, She was in many other circum∣stances, anEgregia virtutis exem∣pla, veluti lu∣men in edito po∣nenda sunt ut omnibus praelu∣ceant; multosque ad sui aemulationem accendant. Erasm. ad Archiep. Tolet. Augustini operibus praefix. p. ult. example worthy the imitation of Believers. All along, She was Exem∣plary.
Exemplary, even from her Infancy: so pli∣ant, so obedient unto her Parents, so filial she was. Exemplary in her minority: Other Virgins marry, she was given in marriage: Her affe∣ctions followed her judgement, and her judge∣ment was led by her Parents. Exemplary as a Subject: Loyal even then, when Loyaltie was not only a ruine, but a seeming disgrace. An exemplary Friend, more then usually that Sexe can be: Her fidelity was, above the fi∣delity of women firm and judicious: for, although she enjoyed the soft vertues of a woman, she want∣ed not the perfections of a man. Unto Mistresses of families She was exem∣plary: How peaceable, how discreet, how bountifull a Mistresse she was, The sorrowes of her weeping Hand-maidens will best re∣solve you. I am not ignorant, that,Sir Tho. Overbury his Wife. Contiguous businesse much that Sexe befits. But a truth it is, She, in understanding was mas∣culine; as she never despised Martha for be∣ing busied about many things: so, she was e∣ver accompanying Mary in that better part which could not be taken from her. A notable exemplary Mother she was: For, She reformed her Children, not by re∣proofs, but by examples: Witnesse her Daugh∣terChristiana, a Christian. that, hitherto miracle of Children. Other Parents suffer their Children to be the Trouble of their Parents, and the shame of themselves; but, this Parent was so discreet,
that, Her severities were pleasantnesse, and her smiles, corrections. As a Wife, she was exceeding exempla∣ry: like The Beloved in theCant. 5.16 Canticles, not a Wife, but a Spouse; not a Spouse, but a Friend. Her love was even, saving that it was daily encreasing: Her privacies were, not fondnesse, but dearnesse: Such her conjugal Society, that the longer she lived, the more she was a Bride, a discreet one though! If ever Wife was a Help meet for her husband, This was she! She gave very great examples of liberality and bountifulnesse: There is thatPro. 11.24 scattereth, and yet encreaseth: She was such a one. Her liberal soul was made fat, and liberal things she devised. She was not alone in this Duty; but, in this Duty very exemplary she was. No Coine was so good sterling with Her, as that which testified her bountifulnesse: Ve∣rily, she was eminently generous: and gave so great encouragements unto the ministery of the Gospel, that, of her quality I have not known her second. Far from vain glory she was, but most singularly munificent. She did so heartily imitate the goodnesse of ourThe Lady Hester Over∣bury, the ver∣tuous wife of Sr. Thomas O∣verbury, Kt. present Lady; that, her pious Charity was no whit inferiour unto her [spe∣cified] generous liberality. It is the blessing of theseOf Burton on the Hill, and Morton in the Marsh. of Glou∣cestor shire. Villages, that God hath brought among us Christians very eminent for casting their bread upon many waters; Ladies ready to
distribute, Ladies ever lending unto the Lord: Such a one was this Gentlewoman: Under God I can attribute the lives of some Wi∣dowes in this Parish, unto that sustenance and relief which they received from this Gen∣tlewoman: in the mean space, Her right hand knew not what her left hand did. Very pitiful, very tender-hearted, very full of compassion she was: She took it as no small kindnesse, when at any time I enfor∣med her, who among us was in poverty, or any otherwise distressed. Let me speak it in the audience of this large Congregation, She professedly took more pleasure in visit∣ing the sick, the poor, the needy, then in visit∣ing the great, the rich, the prosperous: Forbear weeping, poor people: Yet [alas] were it not for theThe vertu∣ous Lady, the Lady Hester Overbury, and the good Lady, and someexcel∣lent Gentlewo∣m n, Mrs. Whit∣lock, Mrs Cres∣wick, &c. few others amongst us, what would your sick beds do, now, that you have no Mrs. RUTTER to stand by you? The Lord comfort you: Trust in Him, he will make your beds in your sicknesses. As were her fruits, such was her faith: Her heart was therefore exercised with such charitable practices, because so much exer∣cised unto godlinesse. She loved the Gospel in the purity of it: She was an example unto you all in fre∣quenting the Church: and no marvail, for she frequented the Church as the House of Her God.
She sat not down in her Pew to read some Historical Scripture, or some private Book; to talk of vanities, to tosse her heels against God, or to sleep in sin, &c. No, she was truly zea∣lous in her Devotions. Some sort of friends we have, which are a kind of Trencher-friends, which visit you more for your Table, then for your Society: In like manner, some sort of Gospel-professors we have, which [although the chief end of Sermons is, to fit us, that we may worship our God] come to Church for the food of a Sermom, not forInanis po∣tentia, quae non reducitur ad actum. the worship of their God. No Sermou, no worship with these; ex∣cept they may edifie their soules by a Sermon, they will not meet here to speak good of Gods Name, to give thanks for benefits received, to set forth the praises of their God, and to rejoyce in the open, publick, and solemn worship of their great and glorious Lord; I pity suchHos. 7.8 dow∣baked, such piece-meal Christians; alas, their own practices witnesse against them, that,It is our duty to love our soules; but, it is not our duty to love our soules more then our God. they assemble hither more in care of their soules, then in love and duty toward their God: I say, such are lovers of themselves more then lovers of God. This Christian, she sought to be edified by Sermons, had a care of her soul, and yet a reverence, a love for her God: I say, She came hither, not toPsalm 119. v. 161 please her self, but to worship andPsal. 30.4 31.23 52.9 84.1.42.1, 2.

For, in a sanctified person, set formes cannot pro∣voke customary flatnesse, seeing the soul of such a OneEph 6.18 watcheth unto prayer; neither can they cherish carelesse, roaving, wandering thoughts; forRom 12.12 the heart is fixed; much lesse do they limit, or quench the Spirit; for GodsRom 8.26, 27 Spirit maketh intercession for him with groanings which cannot be uttered. You may be sure it is for the edifying of the Church, if Christ himself impose a set form upon hisLuke 11.2 Disciples; and if God himself doth the like byNum. 6.23 Aaron, and his sonnes. Of all which this Saint had so perfect experi∣ence, that From the very first beginning unto the full end of our Divine Service, She was [most commonly She was] here present; present [not only with us] but with theWhereas Plus valent ex∣empla quàm praecepta; Here is an example worthy your imitation. Lord: She gave diligence to worship God reverently, to worship God as Her God; to wit, She ever kept her self ever intent upon every instant Duty, giving thanks heartily, as unto the Lord; praying fervently; singing chearfully; hearing heedfully; I speak this, as having been a con∣stant eye-witnesse of what I speak. Verily, I know not that person among you all, which
is more instant in prayer, or more watchful in every kind of Devotion, then constantly, this Gentlewoman was. As she rejoyced in the worship of her God, so she delighted to hear the joyful sound: She attentively hearkened unto Gods Word as well read, as preached; Nor did she rest here; she sought as well sanctification, as know∣ledge; evenWhat was spoken of Ori∣gen, may be related of her; Quemadmo∣dum vixit sic dixit; quemad∣modum dixit sic vixit. sanctification unto obedience; She was none of those who are given unto pleasure, and dwell carelesly, viz. She kept her heart with all diligence, endeavouring to adorn her Gospel-profession. You might know the abundance of her heart from the sweetnesse of her lips; inasmuch as Her most, and most fa∣miliar converse was principally of the things of God. Of this, Her sick bed shall be my witnesse: an evidence beyond expectation; a testimo∣nial worthy to be recorded!

not one; If we look no further then our selves, (31) Hell is our portion. Thus in [our lesser Mapp] Sins micro∣cosm, is found such a world of guilt, such a world of provocation, such aGen. 6 5, 6 Rom. 3.10,-20 Job 4.17 7.17, 18 9 2 11.11, 12 14, 10 15.14, 16 25.4, 6 34.15 lost world, that, [as he is now encentred in the midst of the Universe,] man [vain man] justly ap∣peareth a most inconsiderable spot; lesse [far lesse] then theGen. 32.10 least of thy mercies, O Lord!

O Lord our God, the moreRom. 5.20 undeserving sinful-we are [on the left hand, and on the right hand] the larger the globePsal. 84.5 of thine Ʋniverse, so much the greater prayses, blessings, and thanks∣givings are ever, from us, due unto thy dread∣ful Name, for all thy mercies. Whether to Unbelievers, or unto Believers. To Unbelievers whether already dead, or now living. To them who died in Ʋnbelief, It is the Lords mercy; First, How long since soever they were cast into Hell, that into Hell they were notRom. 9.20, 21 Esay 64.8 Prov. 16.4 sooner cast.
Secondly, How great soever the measure of their guilt and pain is, thatPsalm 145.9 103.10 greater it is not. Thirdly, That, the utmost measure of their punishment isJude 11. Matth. 16.27 deferred until the great and terrible day of the Lord. Fourthly, That their Carcasses which did sin, and shall suffer with their soules, are re∣spited from HellJohn 5.29 1 Thes. 4.16 until the general Resur∣rection. Fifthly, That both their soules and bodies had obtained everlasting mercies, had they notEccl. 7.29 Hos. 13.9 Job 34, 11 fallen from that perfection wherein they were created. To them who live in a state of Ʋnbelief, It is the Lords mercy, First, That they are notLam. 3.22 already hope∣lesse, and helplesse in Hell. Secondly, That the present troubles of their heart are notJohn 3.18 Gal. 3.10 worthy to be compared unto the severe judgements which they deserve. Thirdly, That, though they deserve no mercy at all, they havePsalm 17.14 Eccles. 9.1, 2 Matth. 5.45 Psalm 73.3 -7 so large a por∣tion in this life. Fourthly, For that the long-suffering andRev. 2.21 Rom. 2.4 1 Pet. 3.19 forbearance and goodnesse of their God, daily inviteth them to repentance.
As for the persons spoken unto in my Text, they finde Matter of thankfulnesse. First; For the Kingdom of this World. First, For their very being: for that, they [were] are any part of the Ʋniverse; Friends, It was, it is the Lords mercy that ever there were such creatures in the world as were these Disciples in my Text. There is one flesh1 Cor. 15.39 of men; And that is wonder, if we call to mind how, and against whom Adam trans∣gressed: Be it, that, rather then lessen the number of his several kinds of creatures, man∣kind God will continue; One would think, He would sooner raise up Childrenas Mat. 3 9 out of these stones under our feet, then, from out of the loines of our first Father: These stones never offended God as Adam [once theGen. 1.27 perfect image of his God!] did. That, the de∣terminate Counsel of God should before time was, decree his own Image; that, at the begin∣ning of time, he should say,Gen. 1.26 After our own Image let us make man: that, Having made man after his Image, God shouldPsal. 8.6 put all things under his feet; that, Having put all things under his feet, God shouldGen. 2.17 Nehem. 9.6 Job 7.20 Psalm 36.6 pre∣serve the nature of man, whoGen. 3.17 as 2 Sam. 12.8, 9. and Psalm 50.17 slighted all things! Verily, there is no motive, no ground at all for this; but meerly, the perpetual prayse of his great Name!
Next, For their not being in Hell: It is the Lords mercy that these Disciples [for as much as they also were the Sons of Adam] did not [only] just live to dye in Hell; that, instead of having their heart troubled in their body, their soul was not flaming in Tophet! ButRom. 9.15 God will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy: Although man unto this day dis∣regardeth his God; Unto this day, GodPsalm 8.4 regardeth man: Man quickly destroyed himself; God patiently continuethJob 7.20 mans Preser∣ver. Thirdly, For being under no more troubles of heart. You have heard of the calamity of Job; But, what was Jobs misery, in compa∣rison of thoseSee Deut. 28.15-68 bitter curses and fearful judgements unto which mans sinful nature is most justly exposed! Horrible was the an∣guish of Francis Spira; but, was His anguish equal unto that of damned soules? The fires whichAnno Dom. 1662. Decemb. 26. consumed de Launes House in Louth∣bury, London [Oh, how amazing! yet] were not to be complained of, if we call to mind Hell-flames. Feed a condemned person with bread of affliction and water of affliction all the yeares of his life, he will acknowledge it a favour, that the hour of his execution is de∣ferred; Sirs, the saddest and most forlorn condition upon earth, is a merciful estate unto him who deserveth everlasting burnings. De∣liver me not over unto the will of minePsal. 27.12 Matth. 13.39. e∣nemy, O God.
Fourthly, For temporal mercies. Nicanor had as hard thoughts of his Prince, as natural men have of their God; even and anon, like ma∣ny unthankful English Subjects, he would be de∣tractingPuarch. Apotheg. ubi supra. from his Soveraign; This his So∣veraign knew, yet, took occasion to relieve his wants; now that he had received Re∣lief,. ib. Nicanor was never so well, as then, when he was speaking well of this King; at which the King, See [said he] It is in my power, if I please, to hear or evil or well. Christians, the Lord doth not only deliver us from execution, but, furnish us with food and raiment: YeaVideas Bellarminum De Ascension mentis in delum per Scalas. A Book so useful that I am translating it into English. he frely giveth us all things appertaining unto life! Oh, set itPsal. 107.4 be in His power to make us speak well of him. The same Sun which stood still at theJosh. 10.13 com∣mand of Joshua, runneth a daily Race to give us light; That Moon which stood still 14, over the Valley of Ajalon, night by night at∣tendeh us while we steep: God calleth allPsalm 147.4 the starres by their names, and accompteth them all few enough to do us service: He hath placed us in the very middest of whole multitudes of blessings. His blessings do crowd upon us, as living creatures did upon Noah at the doorGen. 7.9 of the Ar; they throng upon us, as they did upon Adam at his,Gen. 2.19 first crea∣tion; they swarm about us like Bees, like Bee all honey, andSee Psal. 118.12 no sting. Solomon did well to write of Herbs from the Hysop to the1 Kings 4.33 Cedar; We want more Aristotles, more Pli∣nies,
more Philosophers, and more Secretaries of Nature to number up the good works of our God; With what plenty of water, woods, grasse, Cattle, fish, fowl, &c. doth God acco∣modate divers unknown RegionsPsal. 50.10, 11 104.30 Acts 17.26 Job 24.5 38.26, 27 of the World, as if his bounty would prepare a Table in the Wildernesse, against man come thi∣ther to inhabite his mercies? We, upon whom the latteras Jer. 23.20 and Hos 3.5 ends of the world are come, enjoy to our ease, the help, the benefit, the studies, the arts, the experience, and the laboursSee Gen. 4.20 Josh. 24.13 Prov. 8.12 Esay 28 23-29 Exod. 35.30-35 of all ages from the beginning of the Creation unto this more then fi thousandth year of the World! For which of all these common mercies can we neglect to give especial prayses unto our God? It is usual with persons great and Child∣lesse, to sttle their Inheritance upon some a∣dopted Kinsman, that so their Lands may be called after their name; butSee Gen. 21.12, 14 seldom do they give their goods and chattels too unto the same person whom they make their Heir; these they distribute [as Legacies] unto other of their Kinred: Beloved, that [we may not want matter for our thanksgivings, theSee Gen. 25.5, 6 Father of mercies bestoweth upon usRom. 8.32 land and goods too! We are unto Christ, not on∣ly Heirs, but Executors, and Administratours too. Oh let it be the prayse of our God, that, although the circumference be is wide as heaven, yetPsalm 115.16 1 Chron. 28.2 Esay 66.1 compare. Mat. 5.25. with Psalm 132.7 earth is the Centre; and although that be the Throne, yet this is the footstool.
The portion of the wicked isPsalm 17.14 only in this life; by the same method, the portion of the Righteous should be only in the next: but, herein is matter worthy Thanksgivings; that, although the Lord granteth unto us his Ephah, he grudgeth not hisExod. 16.36 Psalm 112.2, 3 homer too; that al∣though we partake of theProv. 3.16 blessings of his right hand, he imparteth likewise the blessings of his left hand: that, although he hath given us a possession in the south-field, he addeth alsoJosh. 15.19 water-springs; besides the upper-springs, nether springs too: A feather in the hand is worth a bird in the ayre; we have the bird in the ayre and the feather in the hand too; Though grace and glory be vouchsafed unto us, no good thing isPsalm 84.11 withheld from us; although there be set before us theMatth 6.33 Kingdom of Heaven and the righteousnesse there∣of, we are not disallowed theLuke 16 9 Mammon of unrighteousnesse. The heir so long as he is a childGal. 4.1 differ∣eth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all; Let it be the praise of our God, that, we here in our minority, are used more like children then servants; It sufficeth that we areJoh. 17.3 assured of life to come; neverthelesse [over and above that] we have the promise1 Tim. 4 8 2 Pet. 1.3 of this life too; Since ourPsal. 62.5 expecta∣tion is from God, we may well feed upon theCol. 1.5 hope that is set before us; [yet, see] while weEphes. 2.6 sit together with Christ in hea∣venly places, he hath given unto us thePsal. 115 16

Matter of Thankfulnesse. Secondly, For the Kingdom of Grace. Were there no Church of God extant un∣der the whole Heavens, yet, unto man de∣serving hell-flames, no small favour it is, if, instead of suffering torments in hell, he may live a while upon the face of the earth. So, were there no mansions in my Fathers House, yet, to man unworthy to live in this World, a very great mercy it is, if he be suffered to live, not in this world only, but within the pales also of theId agamus, ut omne tempus nostrum sit, quod esse non poterit, nisi nos esse ce∣nerimus. Seneca Eist. 72 O in∣sensati, delusi, & infatuati Philocosmi! holy Catholique Church. For, First, Were Religion meerly a forged in∣vention, were it as meer a device to over∣awe
fools, as Atheists would [vainly] have it; yet, since most men areHomo ho∣mini lupus. Prov. 30.14 Psalm 17.12 56.1, 2 Micah 7.2 Gen. 10.9 so greedy to de∣vour one another, the awe which accompanieth Religion must necessarily prevent very many and very great inconveniences among us. Next, All peopleMicah 4.5 will walk every one in the name of his god; rather then not ease his mind with one sort of Religion or other, man will delude his ignorant soul with some or other kind ofEx arbitrio, non ex imperio. Tertul. contra Psychic. cap. 13. will-worship. Thirdly, InPsal. 76.1 Judah is God known: I bow my knees to the Lord Jesus, giving thanks often for spiritual blessings by me received, while I was (long since) of the royal foun∣dation, as well at Westminster Colledge, as at Trinity Colledge in Cambridge: In which Tri∣nity Colledge, Unto mine acuteSir Hicks.

Fourthly, The excellence of knowledge, is, thatEccl. 7.12 wisdome giveth life unto them who have it.

Christians, what made Anaxagoras, and most other of the Philosophers so professedly despise this worlds goods? What made Cleanthes la∣bour hard night by night that he might pur∣chase leisure to study day times? What made Democritus, first waste his whole Estate in tra∣vails; and then, that he might be the better disposed for contemplation, deliberately, and wilfully put out his own eyes? Verily, their ultimate ayme in these their self-denials, was toSocrates erat Homo & corpore purissi∣mus, & anim optimus, & vi∣vendi raone pe fectissimus, & in dicendo suavissimus, qui p è cum Dco, & sanctè cum ho∣miaibus versa∣batur.

GIƲEN to suffer with Christ; a Talent which, into the future Kingdom of glory, we may in no wise carry with us! Once more: There isEsay 45.3 a promise of Treasures of darknesse: Oh Sirs, The dark grief for theEph. 4.18 darknesse of ignorance, the darknesse ofJer. 13.16 sorrow for sin, and every other darknesse ofLom. 3.6 affliction doth, in This kingdome of Heaven, bring forth Trea∣sures; which Treasures the holy Angels can∣not, but we sinnersPsalm 51.3, 17 32.5 2 Cor. 7.10, 12 Esay 57.15 66.20 Rom. 10.10 Dan. 9.10 Ezra 10.1 may and do dedi∣cate unto our God: Although they have in Heaven no such passions as anger, indigna∣tion, hatred, fear, & sim. of these Privi∣ledges We partake: In ourEph. 6.12 warfare a∣gainst sin and Satan, these passions, these spi∣ritual2 Cor. 10.4 weapons we use, and, for them blessed be our God.

Few there are whoRari suat qui Phlosophan∣tur.

As young as he was, that dying Prince of Loraine could sayO Domine Jesu, quem me∣ritò praecepisti mudi contemp∣tum! O Lord Jesu, most deservedly hast thou required our contempt of this world! And Philip the third of Spain,Nihil con∣fert regemesse, nisi ut in morte cruciet suisse. Mendoza in 1 Sam. Tom. 1. Page ult. protested, All the
sweet which I have found in being a King, on∣ly serves to embitter my death. Beloved, it fareth not so with the Kingdome of grace; To believe in God, to believe in his Christ, does as well in death as in life raise for us Matter of Thankfulnesse unto God, viz. First, ForPsalm 19.11 giving us toGen. 2.17 under∣stand ourRom. 7 8, 9 lost condition: WhoGen. 3.11 told us that we were naked? Children of wrath weEphes. 2.3 are by nature; but, who hath warned us toMatth. 3.7 flee from wrath? If God say unto Abimelech, Thou artEphes. 2.1 Gen. 20.3 a dead man, there is mercyEphes. 2.7 intended for Abimelech. Whe∣ther we heed it, or heed it not, Guilt dwel∣leth in us; It is (therefore) of thy free mer∣cy, O our God, that the Scripture hathGal. 3.22 concluded us all under sin. Secondly, For delivering us from so great a death: Gnashing of teeth, weeping, wail∣ing, This was our portion for ever. Ah who among us can abide darknesse which may be felt? perpetual darknesse? perpetual darknesse in a bottomlesse pit? in a bottomlesse pit streaming with brimstone, even with everlasting burnings? With everlasting burnings kindled by the breath of the Lord? by the breath of HimHorresco resereas.— unto whom vengeance belongeth? e∣ven of a provoked Judge! of an enraged Fa∣ther! in short, of a jealous, angry, furious God! O give thanks unto the Lord, for his mer∣cy endureth for ever!
Thirdly, For redeeming us not only from tor∣ment, but from damnation: Friends, though we must all appear before the judgement seat of God, yet, there isRom. 8.1 no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus. A Malefactor re∣prieved at the place of Execution escapeth death, yet was he in a peck of cares, in a bodily fright, he trembled every joint of him, then, when he held up his hand at the Bar; he looked as pale as that death which he feared, at what time sentence was pronouncing against him: But ye [Belo∣ved) give glory to the Father of mercies; Although the ungodlyPsalm 1.5 cannot, the righ∣teous shallPsalm 37.33 stand in judgement. That great and last day, terrible to unbelievers, to you shall be a day ofRevel. 12.10 absolution, a day ofEphes. 4.30 redemption, a day ofActs 3.21 restitution, a day ofLuke 21.28 exaltation, yea, of exultation, re∣joycing and triumph! Christians, you shall be so far from dreading judgement, that you your selves shall1 Cor. 6.2 judge the An∣gels. Fourthly, For preserving us (as in Judge∣ment, so) in death; Unto us death shall be, not our fear, but our hope; not our sting, but our gain; When we shall (like the PriestsLuke 1.8 in the Temple) have sinished our course, we shall thenRevel. 14.13 Heb. 4.9 rest from our labours; We shall not only rest, butPsalm 127.2 sleep; sleep weDan. 12.2 shall, and shall sleep1 Thes 4.14 in Jesus. Thanks be unto God for our life in death.
Fifthly, For begetting us unto a1 Pet. 3.1 live∣ly hope. We, whoEsay 48.8 from the tombe untoJohn 3.3 our new birth haveEsay 1.2 Jerem. 5.23 Ezek 2.7 fought againstPsalm 2.6 10.16 our King, had high cause to despair of obtaining mercy: Against our dread Sove∣raign [even then when He Himself stood at at the doorRev. 3.20 and knocked!] we have shut the door of our Imagination, which should e∣ver conceive of him, not evil, but good; the door of our Memory, which should ne∣ver let him go; the door of our Ʋnder∣standing, which should in all our wayes ac∣knowledge him; the door of our Affections, which should rejoyce in him above all that can be desired; the door of our Conscience, which should ever admit him a witnesse un∣to all our deeds, words, and thoughts; ThesePsalm 24.7 everlasting doores have we bolted a∣gainst him; wherefore most equal it is that he should shut against us everyHos. 2.15 Matth. 25.10 Prov. 1.26, 28 door of hope; yet (lo) before we call He answereth; yea, He expostulatethEzek. 18.31 Why will ye dye? He saith unto usEzek. 16.6 Live! What com∣passions he bare unto his Brethren, JosephGen. 42.17 concealed; How Esau would dealGen. 32.7 by Jacob, Jacob was not worthy to fore∣know; but, for the righteous, light isPsalm 97.11 sown: Our life, which is given us for a prey, is2 Tim. 1.10 brought to light, doth not hang in doubt before us!
Sixthly, For the exercise of godlinesse: When theSaper. King of Persia led about the RomanValeriames. Emperour captive, so often as he took Horse, he trod upon the back of this Emperour; the late Emperour of Rome was now made an Upping stock! Beloved, the King of Heaven doth not like that King of Persia; Upon us he trampleth not: His e∣nemies hePsalm 110.1 Esay 63.3 doth, his redeemed ones he doth not make his footstool: VVe are not handled, we are notJudges 1.7 thumbed as were those seventy Kings, whom Adoni-bezek u∣sed worse then dogs: God neither fetter∣eth, nor cageth us, as Tamerlan did Bajazet: He is not to his elect, as Justinian was to his (sometimes favorite) Belisarius; He is not so cruel to us, as Nebuchadnezzar wasJer. 39.7 unto Zedekiah; He dealeth not by us, as Naash1 Sam. 11.2 would have dealed by the men of Jubesh; He treateth us neither as JoshuaJosh. 9.21 served the Gibeonites, nor as the Phili∣stims1 Sam. 13.9 used the Israelites. Secure Davids Intelligencers2 Sam, 17.18, 19 though it be in a damp well, under ground corn; So you conveigh him down out at the WindowActs 9.25 let Paul, for once, be2 Cor. 11.33 Paul in a basket; and, so you bring him up out of the Dungeon, bol∣ster up Jeremiah withJer. 38.11 Old cast clouts, and with old rotten rags: Beloved, although God giveth us quarter, although he spareth our lives, yet should he deal with us as we deserve, he might justly continue us in this
life, servantswith Rom. 6.16 compare Matth. 1.21 and with 2 Tim. 2.26 1 Cor. 5.5 1 Tim. 1.20 Compare Acts 26.18 unto sin, captivesPsal. 103.10 unto Satan; He might make us like the Jews, wear yellow badges: Oh my Brethren, God hath not dealed with us (15) according to our sins, he hath not rewarded us according unto our iniquities! He hath2 Kings 6.20 brought us into the midst of Samaria, but2 Kings 6.23. he setteth bread and water before us: He crucifieth our old man, but, our inward man he2 Cor. 4.16 reneweth daily; He taketh from us our filthy garments, but giveth unto usEsay 61.10 robes of Righteousnesse; HeGal. 6.14 dis∣armeth us of our rebellious forces, but har∣nesseth us with theEph. 6.11 2 Cor. 10.4 whole armour of God; He dispossesseth us ofEph. 6.5. our strong holds; mean while, He Himself isPsal. 18.2 71.3 91.2 62.7 our strong habitation whereunto we may alwayes resort: O my dearly beloved Brethren, The mighty Captain of our salvation doth conquer us, but he conquereth us with kindnesse! Behold, He giveth us freeGal. 5.1, 13 liberty toEphes. 5.16 make the best of our time, of our abi∣lities, nay of his; what Talents we have, areMatth. 25.14 1 Cor. 4.7 James 1.17 his goods; with these he permitteth us to traffiqueMatth. 16.27 1 Cor. 15.58 Heb. 6.10 for our selves; He thenRom. 2.6, 7, 10 Phil. 2.13 1 Cor. 9.24 Revel. 3.5, 21.21.7 accompteth that we do him the most, and best service, when we work out our own salvation; he encourageth us to procure all the peace, all the vertue, all the godlinesse; all the graces, all the present prayse, and future glory we can. Blessed, blessed be the holy God, for that, while we abide here sin∣ners
upon earth, we are allowed to be spiri∣tually minded, to place our affections upon things above; to have our conversation in heaven; we are not forbid to use,With 1 John 2.27 compare Exod. 30.33 no not the most precious ointment of the Sanctuary! Seventhly, For bestowing upon us all things2 Pet. 1.3 appertaining to godlinesse. People who never yet head thePsalm 89.15 joyful found, mayPsalm 102.22 Revel. 11.15 be religious if they will, that is, if they can: I say, The Gentiles whichLuke 1.79 sit in darknesse, areActs 11.18 17.30 not prohibited light; but, light hath not yet shined unto them; Whereas the day-star from on high hath vi∣sited us; so that we walk (at least we should walk) as children of the light: YeaIt is with us, as Deut. 4.6, 7 Psalm 147.20 un∣to us of this age and kingdome, are given of Gospel-priviledges the best in every kinde: We, above all other the Churches of Christ have Matter of Thankfulnesse unto God. First, For his revealed will: Luther was no lesse worthy rehrehension forEpistola Jacobi, collata cum Evangelio Johannis, & ejus epistolâ, primâ & cum Episto∣lis Paulinis, imprimis quae ad Romanos, Galatas, & Ephesios scriptae sunt, verè straminea epistola est. See Brochmand, and Lu∣thers German Bible, printed 1528. term∣ing S. James his Epistle a strawy Epistle; then that plow-man was worthy to be praysed, who for one single leaf of it, gave a whole load of hay. Verily, if one Oration of Iso∣crates did costviz. if not an 133 l. yet 100 l. twenty talents of silver;
if for every verse which Oppianus presented, was given aviz—0 l. 16 s.-4 d. stater of gold, then is every word of our God morePsal. 119.72 to be desired then thousands of gold and silver. Sirs, every judgement denounced, every warning given, every truth related, every prediction and pro∣phesie, every precept, every command, every promise, &c. abundantly claim from us our studied thankfulnesse. A small portion of ho∣ly Writ the Pentateuch is, especially if it be compared unto all the other canonical Scrip∣tures; neverthelesse, great,Psal. 19.7 119. per totum. 1.2 138.2 very great, was the esteem given unto the word of God, even then when no word of God was extant, saving only those five books of Moses: Belo∣ved, blessed are your eyes, for they see those holy Scriptures, which neither Moses, nor David, nor any of the Patriarchs saw. Next, For this revealed will of Godwith Psalm 102.18 compare Hos. 8.12 written: By signes and wonders, and by several other meanes hath the God of truth given testimony unto the truth of his Word:See du Plessis & Grot. de veritate re∣lig. Christianae, and Dr. Ham∣mond his Rea∣sonablenesse of Christian Reli∣gion. Among which, this is not the least, name∣ly, the harmonious consent of various Copies in several Nations and Languages transcribed and preserved: And herein, let our God receive the prayse due from us; for, none of the Churches of Christ can equal their Bi∣bles unto that published by our English Cler∣gy even inVideas Praefat. ad Wal∣toni. Bibl. Poly∣glotta. perillous times!
Thirdly, For this written WordDeut. 28.49 1 Cor. 14.14 Revel. 14.16 translated, andGen. 40.8 Job 33.23 Prov. 1.6 1 Cor. 12.10 14.13 Esay 50.4 interpreted: Nor hath any Kingdome under Heaven so great cause to be thankful for the purity of Scripture-translations & interpretations, as England hath. Fourthly, For these truths of God whol∣somely applyed: In England every place is full of Manna; I mean, of religious Treatises almost in every kind. When the Reverend Prelacy of this English Church were silenced byThe Tribe of Levi. stand∣eth and falleth with the Tribe of Judah. a rebellious power, God gave them a heart and an ability to leave a Monument of truth in Bishop Waltons voluminous Bible. The Lord stir up the hearts of those Mini∣sters among us which now silence themselves, to improve their talents likewise; Whether in publishing their own corrected labours, or in advancing, revising, contracting, and di∣gesting the learned works of other men. Oh that I might seeLike unto the Hexapla written by An∣drew Willet. in English, Hexapla upon the whole Scriptures: Oh that some Evangelical RiveriusImitating Riverius his Practice of Physick. would, out of the best practical Divines, select the case and cure of every soul. Fifthly, ForSee Mr. William Dur∣ham his Epistle before his Ser∣mon upon James 5.9 the Gospel preached: What any Minister of Christ delivereth according to the simplicity of Gods holy Word, that, not so much the Minister, aswith Exod. 20.19. Job 33.6, 7. and 2 Cor. 4.7. compare Num. 16.5, ii. Deut. 18.19 Num. 17.10. 1 Sam. 8.7. Mat. 10.40. and Luke 10 16. So long as he keepeth to his Com∣missiom, and delivereth the Counsel of God, you cannot despise the work of your Minister, but you do therewithal despise the blood of your Saviour, Bishop Reynolds. pag. 46. of his Pastoral Office. Christ himself
speaketh; for Christ by His1 Cor. 12.28 Matth. 28.20 Eph. 4 11, 12 Ministry, nowHeb. 12.25 Ephes. 2.7 2. Cor. 5.20 speaketh from Heaven. O blessed Jesu, Thou didst not pray for thy Ministers alone, but forJohn 17.20 them also which shall be∣lieve on thee through THEIR word. Sixthly, For every other Ordinance of Christ administred among us: Compare the purity of our Church with the superstitions abroad; yea, confer2 Cor. 3.8, 9 Gospel worship with theGal. 4.9 beggarly rudiments of the Law; or the1 Pet. 3.21 la∣ver of Baptism with theCurtis Ja∣daeis. Pers. Gen. 17.11 unsightly cir∣cumcision of the foreskin of the flesh; or the1 Cor. 11.23 Supper of the Lord with theExod. 32 8 bitter herbs of the Passeover; nay, taste the Spirit and life of any Ordinance of Christ; you will thenPsal. 30.4 give thanks unto God at the re∣membrance of his holinesse. Seventhly, Let us and all the Churches be thankful, for that theJohn 6.29 1 John 3.23 whole duty of man is to believe in God and his Christ. When we hear and believe, read and believe, meditate and believe, then is our heart filled with joy, and our lips with prayses: I believed, there∣fore2 Cor. 4.13 have I spoken. TheJames 5.16 prayer of faith how doth it avail? TheHab. 2 4 just shall live by his faith, yetGal. 2.20 not he, but Christ li∣veth in him! Wisely toPsal 119.66 Matth. 13.56 believe, to cre∣dit, and to trust, is noble and heroique; then this generous duty, what duty can be more de∣sireable except to love which is butGal. 5.6 faith exercised? God he graciously entrusteth the
Believer with whatsoever conduceth unto his everlasting good. The believer, he [again] doth not only believe, butPsal. 62.8 Esay 7.9 30.15 Prov. 14.26 Ephes. 3.12 Heb. 3.6 trust his God: He resteth assured that the Almighty is so just, so true, that man may safely rely upon the faithful friendlinesse of every proceeding of his, and upon his bare word in whatsoever he speaketh; no wisdome, &c. like Gods wis∣dome, &c. Between learner and teacher, ser∣vant and master, man and wife, &c. there is a necessity of trusting; of these some or other may betray their trust; But, seldome will we mistrust a person of honour: and, as for the word of a King, that [ye know] is sacred a∣mong us: it were barbarism to give a Prince the lye: Oh then, where we have Gods word of truth for our warrant, and thatJoh. 17.3 warrant sealed unto us by Gods Spirit of truth, with what full assurance may weHeb. 4.16 repose a stedfast confidence upon our great and loving God? Most chearfully can the BelieverCredere Joan. 14.1. in Deum, est fidu∣ciam habere. Zegerus. trust his God for the pardon of all his sins, for the supply of all his wants, for the acceptance of his person and of his endeavours, for the reward promised unto e∣very duty, &c. Things temporal are not more visible to thine eye, thenHeb. 11.1 things spiri∣tual are to his faith. All haveRom. 3.23 sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Christi∣ans, wherein soever we sin, therein our faith faileth us, viz. We do notPsal. 111 7 119.66, 151, 86.172 believe the commandement [by us broken] to be so good
for us, so advantageous to us, asDeut. 6.24 10.13 in truth it is. There neither is nor can be any sin which is not accompanied with unbelief: On the other side, the greater our faith, the lesse we disobey, that is, the lesse we come short of the glory of God. Eighthly, If the life of faithHab. 2.4 be a life so desirable; what thanks is due from us unto our God for thatRom. 1.4 holy, that1 Pet. 4.14 blessed spirit of his by which2 Cor. 4.13 alone we are enabled to believe? By Him is sanctified the2 Thes. 2.13 use of all that is before us: OurMatth. 5.6 thirst after righteousnesse maketh us to rellish righteousnesse the better: The waters of sal∣vation which we draw, we draw withEsay 12.3 joy: The breasts which we suck, are breasts ofEsay 66.11 consolation: WeEsay 38.16 live, and the spiritual life which we lead, isRom. 8, 6 plea∣sant unto us: We have bread from heaven to feed upon, and aJer. 31.25 spiritual taste to de∣light us while we feed: We are a peoplePsa. 75.1 14.14 Rom. 13.11 near unto the Lord: We are not a∣mused as those Disciples wereLuke 9.33 Matth 17.6. before whom the person speaking in my Text was transfigured, (no) our eyes areNum. 24.3 Luke 24.31 open, wePhil. 3.12 apprehend that for which also we are apprehended: We are not layed in a trance, asActs 9.4 10.10 22.17 Saul was, then, when the Lord converted him: God doth not cast us intoGen. 2.20, 21 a dead sleep, as he did Adam, while he raiseth aPsalm 89.19 help meet for us; rather, he

This God1 John 4 8. of love is aWisdom 1.6 loving spirit; he leadeth us into hisProv. 3.17 wayes of pleasantnesse, he walketh with us in his garden walkes; he filleth us withPsalm 119 20 longings: he ravisheth our souls withPsalm 119 97 spiritual delights, heRom. 8.15 adopteth us chil∣dren, children of God, and heires of salvati∣on, he2 Pet. 1.4. maketh us partakers of the di∣vine

Ninthly, Ʋnto us aEsay 9.6 Son is given. As the Son imparteth unto usJohn 3.34 7.38 15.26 his own spi∣rit, so the FatherJohn 3.16 giveth unto us his own Son; his own Son1 John 1.2 Eph. 3.9, 11 manifest in the flesh! A mysterie, a great mysterie, aSee Bishop Andrews Serm. on 1 Tim. 3.16 See Ephe. 3.10 great mysterie almost swallowing up our medita∣tions, and making us (not so much thank∣ful, as) thankfulnesse it self! For, since this Son of God is bothActs 10.36 Lord andHeb. 1.2 heir of all things, giveRom. 8.32 HIM to us, and we will quickly lay our claim unto1 Cor. 3.22 what∣soever he hath: The work ofJohn 1.3 Col. 1.16 his hands, the worlds whichHeb. 1.2 he created, they arePs. 115.16 our goods and chattels; (OursMatth. 6.32 1 Tim. 4 8 Heb. 13.5 during our life, for1 Cor. 7.31 our use; His for ever, forPsalm 119 91 his glory:) What inhe∣ritance he holdeth byMat. 21.33 birthright, that, by hisHeb. 1.2 purchase isRem. 8.17 Tit. 3.7 Heb. 1.14 James 2.5. 1 Pet. 3.7. made ours: The price of his blood is1 Cor. 10.16.

But, though Jona∣than keepeth1 Sam. 18.14 his bow, his sword, and his robes to himself, David will love Jonathan for1 Sam. 18.3 Jonathans sake; True, of the ful∣nesse of Christ we allJohn 1.16 receive grace for grace; and whatsoever duties we owe unto God, them Jesus Christ performethEph. 5.2 Tit. 2.14 in our name and stead; but, did he neither se∣cure us from wrath, nor procure us benefits, yet still [Jesus is theMagni Parentis non minor filius. Chara Dei so∣bo'es magnum Jovis incre∣mentum. Or, as Aure∣lius Symmachus of Boethius, Illud pretiocij∣simum humani generis decus. gracious Son of a gracious Father] we should love Jesus both for his Fathers sake, and for his own sake. Mean while, He who spared not his own Son, but hathRom. 8.3 given him up to our nature, to our infirmities, to our sorrowes, to the wrath and death due to us; he that giveth to us, and thus giveth to us his Son, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things! Where∣fore, thanks be unto GodRom. 7.25 through Jesus Christ our Lord; yea, thandks be unto God for Jesus Christ our Lord.
The last matter of Thankfulnesse which I now propose [while we abide here within this kingdome of grace] is Gods love to mankind. The2 Cor. 4.6 face of Jesus Christ could never be so full of2 Cor. 3.18 smiles to us-ward; but that the God, and1 Pet. 1.3 father of our Lord Jesus Christ is toward us soJohn 3.16 Rom. 5.8 infinitely compassionate. WeMat. 18.3 1 John 4.4 John 13.33 little children, conscious of our demeritJer. 31.18 Zech 12.10 1 John 1.10 bemoan our selves, we cry, weMic. 4.9 cry out aloud, because we have doneRom. 3.23 a very great fault;Mc 5.5 Peace,Ephes. 2.10, 15, 17 peace, [saith the father of our mercies] wipeEsay 54.4, 6, 8 30.19 away all tears from your eyes; I will notJer. 31.34.33.8 punish you; you beEsay 43.12 44.22 blamelesse andEsay 40.2 55.7, 8 righteous, andEsay 53.11 John 1.29 perfect; You did notNum. 23.21 commit the offence, but, myIsa. 42.1 servant did; with you I am well pleased, I was angry, not with you, but with myIsa. 53.10 servant: [AhMar. 15.28. 2 Cor. 5.2 naughty servant,] I haveIsa. 53.3-10 beaten him; but you, beEph. 1.6 good children: Come, turnIsa. 51.11 your sorrow into gladnesse, and your mourn∣ing into joy; Love me1 Joh 4.19 John 14.15, 16 little children, I your1 Joh 3.16 father love you; kisse2 Sam. 14.33.

Other Kings whip their high-born sons up∣on their Pages back; this King of heaven and earth, he spareth his vilest servants, and scour∣geth them upon the shoulders of his most glorious Son! His justice against us, the avenging God

So God loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, thatJohn 3.16 whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life! God is ofHab. 1.13 purer eyes then to behold ourZech. 3.4 filthy garments; therefore heEsay 61.10 adorn∣etk us with the Robes of his only Son; He can∣not excuse us while we take our own courses; therefore heEph. 5.26, 27 Tit. 2.14. sanctifieth us by the Word and Spirit of his own Son; He cannot af∣fect us as we abideEzek. 16.6 polluted in our sins; therefore he taketh theRevel. 1.5 1 Pet. 1.19 1 John 1.9 2.2 heart-blood of his dear Son, and therewith washeth away our stains and guilt;Ephes. 1.4 He cannot exalt us while we abide strangers and enemies; therefore he

I challenge all the Poets among the Heathens to invent, nay, to imitate2 Pet. 1.16 either such a Tragedy, or such a Comedy as (in relation, as well unto us, as unto themselves) is divinely acted by the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, three per∣sons in one God for ever blessed. Let PharaohGen 41.43 make Joseph Ruler of his whole Kingdom, let NebuchadnezzarDan. 1.4 2.48 6.3 e∣ducate, and advance Daniel the best he can; untoEsther 3.1. 6.10 2.17 Haman, nay unto Mordecai, nay unto Esther, let Ahasuerus shew the utmost of his loving favours, yet none of these Hi∣stories are worthy to be borrowed [no not] as illustrations of that eternal love which the everlasting Father revealeth unto us in his Go∣spel of Jesus Christ.
Do [Ʋnbelievers] doat upon the trash of this world: squander away your health, your wits, your wealth, your time, your talents up∣on a1 John 5.19 world of folly, uponEccles. 1.2 empti∣nesse, upon nothing, upon1 Joh 3.4 Rom. 7.13 6.23 sin which is worse then nothing; while we, who are madeJames 2.5 Denizons of this kingdome of grace, bestowPsalm 1.2 104.34 119.97 Phil. 3.8 1 Tim. 4.15 our time, our thoughts, our continual stu∣dies upon the sacred mysteries of the glorious Gospel: We enjoy a fellowship which you (poor fools) are not well aware of; to wit, thePhil. 2.1 2 Cor. 13.14 fellowship of [that true Comforter!] the holy Ghost, thePhil. 3.10 fellowship of [that endearing Re∣deemer!] the Son of God, and the1 Joh. 1.3 4.16 fellowship of [him who is all in all unto us!] God the Father. In this Kingdome of grace, behold1 John. 1 what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should [here] be called the sons of God: Beloved,1 John. 2 now are we the sonnes of God, but it doth not yet appear what we shall be; But, this I know, we shall then be like him when we shall see him as he is; and, we shall most assuredly see him as he is; for
In my fathers house are many Mansions. HOw amiable are these Tabernacles of thinePsalm 84.1 O Lord of hosts? Blessed are they thatPsalm 84.4 dwell in thy house, they will still be praysing thee. One thing have I desired of the Lord which I willPsalm 27.4 seek after, name∣ly, that I may dwell in this house of the Lord all the endlesse dayes of mine everlasting life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple. My soulPsalm 84.2 longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord. Beloved, as there is no coming unto these Mansions in my fathers house until the kingdome of glory be first entred; so, there can never be wanting Matter of thankfulnesse unto God For the Kingdome of glory, A Kingdome indeed; a kingdome of the great God! a kingdome of the great glory of the great God! Prayse ye the Lord fromPsal. 148.1 the heavens.
Da Christia∣num & scit quod dico; but, Where no grace is, there the King of glory loseth his right.Christians, were there no temporal pu∣nishments, no death, no judgement, no hell to be escaped; no Satan to be trodden under foot, no sin to be subdued, no vertue to be desired, no Gospel-conversation to entertain us while we abide in the Church militant, no present grace to be the measure of future Re∣ward, no recompence of Reward at all; nay, were our life here upon earth a continual Hell, yet, theTit. 1.2 Gal. 5.5 2.3 3.7 Heb. 6.18 hope that is set before us, thePhil. 3.14 high price of our high calling may justly fill our mouth with the high prayses of our God. Here, I confesse, my tongue is not the Pen of a ready Writer: He needeth the tongue, not of men, but of Angels; the wing, not of an Eagle, but of a Cherub, that2 Cor. 12.4 undertakes to soar towards these mansions: My thoughts may, my tongue cannot ascend the heavens; It is for divine St. Augustine to write of the City of God. Eye hath1 Cor. 2.9 seen much, ear hath heard more then eye hath seen; mans heart concei∣veth more then his ear hath heard, yet all is too little, at the best: The visible world [large as it is] containeth not variety enough of creatures, to paint out in apposite colours, nay to shadow out without colours, nay, without the least shadow, to delineate an imperfect mapp of thisRevel. 21.2, 3, 11 most glorious kingdome. By the mansions in my Fathers house,Ex pede Hercu∣leme 1 Cor. 13.12 you may attempt some small conjecture of what
great thanks we owe unto our merciful God for the surpassing, infinite, and eternal peace, joy, blisse, and glory of this heavenly King∣dome. We finde here signified Matter of joy to us, andNam gaudio cogendi vis inest. Pan. ad Tra∣jan. of prayses to our God. First, in the Mansions. Object. Why Mansions? Answ. 1. Mansions intimate rest: Because I have saidJohn 16.6 these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart; but, let not your heart be troubled: When trouble is nigh, GodPsalm 22.11 91.15 is not far off: you believe in God, believe also in me; IJohn 14.2 go to prepare a place of rest for you. Beloved, all things under the Sun are like the Moon, full of defects and changes; yea, all things under the heavens are, like the Ayr, made up of vanity and commotions, but, verily Brethren,Heb. 4.9 there remaineth a rest for the Saints. Answ. 2. Mansions, as they promise rest, so, they intimateJoan. 14.2 Syrus habet vo∣cabulum quod significat locum pablicum, ut diversorium, sicut etiam Sue∣tonius Mansionis nomine pro diversorio & hospitio utitur. Gehard in Hist, Harm. E∣vangel rest after travel: By the sharpnesse of death I open the kingdome of heaven, (not for my self, for IJohn 6.38.3.13. came

Mansions, as they give rest af∣ter travel, so, theyOstendit Joan. 14.2 Apostolos hoc nomine Deo fidere debere quòd in domo patris sui variae sint paratae manjos: A transsugs sum∣pla Metaphora, quibus, magno solatio est habere varia Asyla ad consuglenda: quae promittit Christus, sive praesentem spectes vitam, sive futuram. Zegerns. yield refuge against danger: As there is no covert from a storm like ones well-built dwelling house, so, there is no shelter from trouble, like Gods dwelling house: In Gods house we at once, both escape a storm, and findePsalm 3.2, & 91.9. a God On Mount Zion shall be aEsay 4.6. shadow from heat, and a refuge from storm; I will be unto you aEzek. 11.16. little Sanctuary: Sirs, when Jesus Christs Disciples are persecuted upon earth, they take sanctuary in heaven. Answ. 4. Mansions, as they import pro∣tection, so they imply, quasi Stabiles mansio∣nes. continuance of that protection. Tents may be soon taken down, soon removed, Mansion-housesEsay 33.20 not so. Christians, Upon earth we are all of usJer. 35.7 Rechabites: we have hereHb. 13.14 no continuing City; the City of God [that] endureth for ever!
Answ. 5. Mansions serve, as well for con∣venience, as for continuance: The Jewish Temple which was soPsalm 15.1 Revel. 11.19 absolute a Type of the Temple of God in new Jerusalem, was, ifEzek. 40.44, 45, 46 duly considered, as well a Colledge, as a Temple: About it wereJer. 35.4 store of Chambers built for those Priests and Levites which ministred before the Lord: Friends, so many of us as wait upon the LordPsalm 23.4 need fear no night; no servant of this Lord shall want for lodging; so professedly are the man∣sions in my fathers house allotted unto the fol∣lowers of Jesus Christ, that, death shall onlyEsay 26.20 bring us unto our chambers. Answ, 6. Mansions comprehend, not only convenience, but delight; and that, first, in re∣gard of the building; next, in regard of the furniture. First, Our out-houses are meanly built, of hay, stubble, mud or such like: Our outward buildings are ordinarily neglected as are those vessels of dishonour which lumber them, or the cattle which we house in them; may they be warm for the cattle, necessary for businesse, or ser∣viceable for out-uses, all is passing well; not so withSee Revel. cap. 21. our mansion-house; that [if any] is of stone-work, if not of Marble, curiously hewen and carved. Next, as of the two, the faebrique is more excellent, so the furniture. We will hardly be at the charge of plaistering our barns or
hovils, much lesse do we either wainscot or hang them: But, if we have any Bed, Table, Stool, Candlestick, &c. let them be2 Kings 4.10 fur∣niture for the Prophets lodging-room; if the world hath any Purple, Needlework, Gold or Pearl, let them besee Exod. cap. 36. cap. 37. cap. 38. cap. 39. set apart for the dwelling place of the most High: Unto our Mansion-houses we bring our houshold-stuffe, our substance, our riches, our treasures, our plate, our furniture, our tapestry, &c. Our Mansion-houses we make and keep as neat, as pleasant, as delightful, as the condition of our private estates will permit. Beloved, these mansions in my Text are, all of them,Domum a∣pud patrem habo, cam ae vobis paratam, to, lodgè ocu∣lentissim n am∣plissimam, bo tis omnibus instru∣ctssiun. Jac. Capellus in Joan 14.2 fur∣nished, not according unto the lownesse of our mean condition, but, according unto the ma∣jesty and honour of the high and mighty Lord of all things; The royal Treasures, the Princely Ornaments of every mansion, within this Pa∣lace, speak their owner a great king, even aPsalm 24.7 king of glory. Therefore, as you will finde them glorious mansions, so you do finde them Many Mansions. Jesus Christ hadJohn 13.36 newly informed Ce∣phas, whither I go thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me hereafter; This the other Disciples, who then stood by,John 13.33 o∣ver-heard; over-hearing this, their hearts were troubled: Thought they,Vide in Joan. 14.1 Trinum Mol∣tm. Ja∣teni, concord. Even cap. 134 what shall be∣come of us? Peter, he shall follow Christ,
but poor we may be leftJohn 14.18 comfortlesse be∣hind; No [saith Jesus] IJohn 14.2 deal plainly with you, Were it so, I would have told you; but, in my Fathers house are many mansions, mansions enough for Peter, enough for my self, enough for you, and for thousands more besides you. Object. Many are called, butMatth. 20.16 few are chosen: Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, andMatth. 7.14 few there be who finde it. Answ. 1. Verily, this is one reason why I have openly endeavoured to roll every stone from your heart; Alas, the unbelief of many among us did never yet trouble their thoughts; They accept anQui Chri∣stiani nominis opus non agit, Christianus non esse videtur. Salvian. de Dei Gub. lib. 4.2 Tim. 2.19 3.5 Revel. 3.1 James 2.20 idle, fruitlesse, opiniona∣tive knowledge, instead of a firm belief in God and his Christ; They promise unto themselves these mansions in my Fathers house, whereas, except they repent, they shall neverHeb. 12.14 step toward them: They have a name that they live, but are dead. [By theirMatth. 7.20 fruits you may know it:] God will not put that into their heads, which they cast at their heels; if theyActs 13.46 judge themselves unworthy of ever∣lasting life, it is just with God, not toSee Dr. Selater upon 2 Thes. 1.5, 1 accompt them worthy of his calling. But, mine APOLOGIE in behalf of my God, is, that although few there be who work outPhil. 2.12 their Salvation, Christ2 Cor. 5.15 dyed for all;
Though few there be who finde that Jesus Christ is theJohn 14.6 only way which leadeth un∣to life, in Jesus Christ is everywhereJohn 10.10 offered Life more abundant. Answ. 2. Although in comparison of all them for whom1 John 2.2 Rom. 5.18 Jesus Christ dyed, they that perishMatth 7.13 are many; yet, in compari∣son of them whom Jesus Christ might justlyRom. 3.9, 23 1 Sam. 2.30 have rejected, they who belive unto sal∣vation, have need of many mansions, for they are many: Compare theJohn 10.16 flock of sheep with theMatth. 25.38 herd of goats, and aLuke 12.32 little flock it is; but, recollect how many of these sheep the1 Pet. 5.8 wolfe would have de∣voured, and you will then grant, that (over what it might have been) this little flock a∣bideth aJohn 10.16 Psalm 84.7 Revel. 7.9 great flock. There were in numerably more fishes left in the Sea, thenLuke 5.6 taken, yet theibid. Text saith, They enclosed a great multitude of fishes; Although more are without the pale of the Church then within it; yea, although more are in the Church then of it; yet multi udes of Believers there are, whom these Fishers of men convert. True, many are those unthankful wretches which will torment themselves in hell-flames; but, blessed be our Saviour, many [although not so many] are the Saints glorified in Hea∣ven.
Answ. 3. No marvail it is, if the mansi∣ons in my Fathers house be many, since the elect of God cannot be few: We finde from the East, and from the west,Matth. 8.11 many com∣ing to sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Ja∣cob, in the kingdome of heaven: Among the tribes of Israel, we see aRevel. 7.4 hundred forty four thousand sealed: In the beginning of the worldJude 14 ten thousand of the Saints were heard of: If you will allow the seed of Abra∣ham to be,Gen. 22.17 like that father of the faithful,Gal. 3.7, 8 true believers, you will, as soon number the stars of heaven, as them: For, although un∣to the great God, neitherPsalm 139.16 they, nor thePsalm 147.4 stars are innumerable, yet unto us finite creatures, they are aRevel. 7.9. great multi∣tude, which no man can number. Answ. 4. A multitude of the heavenly hostLuke 2.13 seconded one Angel; how great that multitude was, God alone knoweth; Every legion of Angels is computed six thousand six hundred sixty and six in number; of these you may observe twelve legions mentionedMatth. 26.53 like one single troop: We read ofDan. 7.10 thousand thousands spirits who ministred unto God, and of ten thousand times ten thousand who stood before him: and againRevel. 5.21 ten thou∣sand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands. Beloved, in my Fathers house, none of all these want their mansions.
Answ. 5. Many, viz. for theHos. 4.16 greater solace of these Disciples: Some conclude, that one of hell-torments shall be an oppres∣sing andEsay 22.5 over-crowding one another, tho∣rough the narrow scantnesse of that bottomlesse pit: If so, One of the pleasures of Heaven shall be aMark 14.15 Psalm 31.8 118.5 Matth. 13.30 spaciousnesse of room: God willEsay 54.2 enlarge our Tent.

So in heaven there be man∣sions one of a higher degree of glory then ano∣ther; Hereunto the person speaking in my Text principally alludeth: Saith he, This is the victory which overcometh your troubles, even your faith; wherefore believe in God, believe also in me; and, take this for your encou∣ragement; The greater your faith is, the greater your victory; and the greater your vi∣ctory is, the greater shall be your Reward; for, I will reward every one of you according unto his work of Faith; and that I may reward e∣very one of you according unto your work of Faith, In my Fathers house are many Man∣sions — are. It is not said they shall be, but they [al∣ready] are: Thi is yet one more incite∣ment unto a thankful glorifying of God as God, viz. theBeatitudo haec duo requi∣rit, frutionem. incommutabilis boni, & certi∣tudmem aeternae sruitionis. See Ephes. 2.6. Phil. 3.20, &c. full assurance, the live∣ly hope which is set before us: There2 Pet. 3.13. Revel. 21.1. shall be new heavens, nay, thereEsay 66.5 17.18. are. There are mansions, many mansions, many mansions of many degrees; of degrees already prepared to recompence the highest degree of
faith and love which any Disciple can pos∣sibly reach; wherefore, my beloved Brethren, be ye1 Cor. 15.58 stedfast, unmoveable, alwayes a∣bounding in the work of the Lord, for so much as you know, your labour is not in vain in the Lord: There are many mansion in my Fathers — house. Quest. Why is the kingdome of glory com∣pared to a house? Answ. For the same reason that you here see many mansions; not only mansions, but many mansions [as I told you]: The glory of the invisibleSee Bishop Reynolds. on Hos. 14. Serm. 5. Sect. 2. in The beauty of Lillies. infinitely transcendeth the glory of the visible world: Hence, as we are forced to use many letters to spell one long word, or, many words to compose one e∣loquent speech; so, by reason of our imper∣fect understanding, we are constrained to borrow many worldly excellencies to repre∣sent any1 Chron. 29.1 Revel. 21.2 one glory in heaven.

The windows must beEsay 54.12 Agates, the gates Carbuncle, the battlements pleasant∣nesse, and whatsoever else is precious; the pavement love, joy and glory. The azured fir∣mawent, which our eyes behold, is but as the rough rags, the made-earth, the unhewen, the lowest, the buried part, of the foundations of this House! The stars of the firmament are but as so many sandy dusts everywhere scatter∣ed within that azured, that clayie rubbish! The Moon and Sun, which seem so bright unto us, unto the inhabitants of this House in my Text, do indeed a little glizzen, but no otherwise then two shells of an Oyster o∣pened under our feet! If heaven be a house, it is a mansion-house; a glorious house, a ho∣ly house, the house of my God, and, that I may speak home, My Fathers house. God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, isExod. 15.11 glorious in holinesse, Fearful in prayses: What sort of1 Chron. 29.1 Palace! What kind of Temple must that be, which deser∣veth to be calledEsay 66.1 The House of God! And yet our rejoycing lyeth not so much in the fabrique, as in the builder; not so much in the builder, as in the owner of this house: The Owner of this House is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; This is My Fathers house First, in regard of God the-Father: Hea∣ven is God the Fathers home: He indeedJerem. 23.14 filleth all places; but, heaven is theLuke 16.9 Esay 57, 15 place of his habitation, thePalm 26.8 palace where his honour dwelleth; the1 Chron. 29.1 palace where he keepeth his Court; theEsay 62.9 Court where he exalteth his Throne, his power, and his glory. Next, in regard of God the Son: As to work out our Redemption, he came down from heaven; so, having finished that work, he as∣cended up on high: Oh, it was aJohn 20.17 com∣fort to the son of man, as man, to go unto his Father; for his Father isJohn 14 28 greater then he. Thirdly, in regard of us Believers. First, WeEsay 64.1 fancy great matters, might Jesus Christ here converse among us in the flesh: Sirs, God the father loveth Je∣sus
Christ as his only Son; Jesus Christ reci∣procally loveth him as his dear Father: If we love Jesus Christ more then we love our selves, weJohn 14.28 rejoyce because he is now at home with his own Father. Fools may prate that Fathers are good friends, but evil compa∣ny; it was never so with the Son of man; For theActs 3.21 7.55 Humane nature of Jesus Christ, there is no such company as the visible socie∣ty of his eternal Father. Shew him the father, andJohn 14.8 it sufficeth. Secondly, My Fathers house isMatth. 6.9 Our Fathers house: Doubtlesse thou art our Father was a high-strained faith, even then whenEsay 63.16 derived from Gods creation, at most, from Gods protection of us: But, the per∣son speaking in my Text hath now given us a nearer claime; he canJohn 20.17 send us word, I go to my Father, and your Father; there∣fore your Father, because my Father. Thirdly, Our Fathers house was never built for Spiders: God doth not, like some of our Gentry, first build a great house, and then, ever after, lay all hospitality aside. No, HeEsay 25.6 feasteth it, heRevel. 19.9 ever feasteth it, likeRevel. 19.17 Esther. 1 an Emperour: In the house of my Father, as none serve himRevel. 1.6 under Priests and Kings, so, all, who serve him, fare likeRevel. 3.20 Princes. Upon earth this is the infelicity of Kings that to maintain a requisite State, they
[most what] sit at Table alone; whereas, in heaven, although Kings we are, yet our meat doth us no good except we eat itHeb. 12.22, 23 with company. In our Fathers house, as our Supper is theRevel. 3.20 19.17 Supper of the Lord, so our society is theHeb. 12.22 communion of the Saints; In heavenly places we shall sitEphes. 2.6 together with Abra∣ham, Isaac and Jacob. Abel will there tell us what hard words and blowes heGen. 4.8 re∣ceived from Cain; We shall there see Job beholding his Redeemer with hisJob 19.27 own eyes: Charles theOf great Brittain, France and Ireland, King. First [the first since that hour wherein Jesus Christ was crucified] that ever dyed, and so dyed for the good of his people; Him we shall finde among, if not a∣bove the noble Army of Martyrs! Yea, we shall there converse with every glorified soul, with every soul glorified in its own order, in its own mansions, joying and rejoycing with its own peculiar degree of glory; The elect of God, which here upon earth were unto us Neighbours, Friends, Kinred, Brethren, Sisters, Children, Parents, Wives, or Husbands, with these we shall renew an acquaintance, an ac∣quaintance encreasing unto all eternity. Scholars, if ever you would save time in your studies, if ever you would be ex∣quisite Phisosophers, great Historians, or per∣fect

The Holy Ghost who gave us life, first natural, then spiritual; That good, thatNeminm unquam de∣misit tristem. loving spirit, which did, doth, and will con∣tinue our preserver, sanctifier and comforter, will, in Heaven, put life into us indeed! when he once entertaineth us in my fathers house, then we shall live! The person speaking in my Text, thorough whom the just God is so well pleased with us; He who came down from heaven to bring us thither; who underwent for us the reproaches of men, and the curse of God; who, for our sakes spake, and wrought, and suffered wonders; Him, who passed by the fallen Angels, and exalteth our nature above his elect Angels; Him, who did once give himself for us, and doth ever since give himself to us; Him un∣to whom God hath givenNec patior me quicquam nescire de co quem amew.

Ber∣nard. principally, my father himself; The Refuge, the Rest, the Reward, the Riches, the Inheritance, the Crown, The Mansions, the many Mansion, the many

Lastly, as here upon earth no one mercy can so much require our thankfulnesse as the communion betwixtDeus tuus totum tihi crit. S. Aug. in Psalm 26. Et quem scmper habeat, semper habere volunt. our spirit and the sanctifying spirit of our most holy God; so, neither can any thing in heaven more excite our prayses and thanksgiving unto him who sitteth upon the Throne, then the blessed Vision of our most glorious God, even of God the Fa∣ther, of God the Son, and of God the Holy Ghost, ever [for ever!] blessed and glorify∣ed! In His presence is fulnesse of everlasting joy! To him be the Kingdome, the power and the glory ever ascribed, Amen.
