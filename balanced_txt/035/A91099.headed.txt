The Lord fulfilling his PROMISES Declared by his Holy PROPHETS and APOSTLES, In these later Days. LONDON, Printed for Giles Calvert at the Black Spread Eagle neer the West end of Pauls. 1656.
A CALL OUT OF EGYPT, Where Death and darkness is, into the glorious Light and Liberty of the Sons of God where life and peace is, &c. GIve eare O ye heavens and I will speak: and hear O earth the words of my mouth: I will declare unto you the wonders of God: I will publish the name of the Lord, and the mighty operation of his power: he is the Rock and the sure Foundation: his work is perfect: all his ways are judg∣ment and righteousness; he is a God of Truth, and without in∣iquity; just and righteous is he, and all his wayes are just and equal: he is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity; his way is pure, and his Worship is likewise pure and spiritual, and he sits in his Throne of Righteousness, Justice, and Judgment, and the wicked cannot stand before him; they are and shall be like the chaffe which the winde driveth away, and cannot stand in the Judgement, nor the Sinners in the Congregation of the Righteous: Holy and Righteous is the Lord God of Hosts, and delights in purity; Holinesse becomes his house for
ever: The Temple of God is holy, where he dwells and inha∣bits, and where he is worshipped; and he dwells not in Tem∣ples made with hands, as it is written in the Prophets, The hea∣ven is my Throne, and the earth is my Footstool; where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest? for all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been saith the Lord: But to this man will I look, even to him that is of a meek and a contrite Spirit, and trembleth at my word. This is God, the living God, which the Prophets and Apostles, and all the Holy Men did bear witness unto, and declared of, even what they had seen and heard, and tasted of the Word of Life, which was in the beginning with God, and the Word was God, and shall endure for ever: The same God who at sundry times and in divers manners, spake in times past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last dayes spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath given for a Covenant of Light, to lead his peo∣ple out of death and darkness into righteousness and peace, to have fellowship with the Son, and to be Heirs, Joint-Heirs with the Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom also he made the world, & all that is therein, the Sun, the Moon the Stars and the Fowls of the air, the Earth and all the Beasts of the Field, and the creeping things upon the Earth, the Sea and all that is therein; who being the brightness of his Glory, and the expresse Image of his substance, upholding all things by the Word of his Power; which power is now manifested, which makes the earth to shake, and the Inhabitants thereof to trem∣ble at the wonderful work of our God which is began in this Nation of England. The dreadful God of Host is risen in his majesty & great power, & is bringing to passe his strange work, which makes the heathen rage, & bite and gnaw their tongues, and stand astonished at the strange work of the Lord: Behold ye despisers, and wonder and perish; for I work a work in your daies, which you shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you; and this is fulfilled upon this Generation, who will not believe the work of the Lord though it be declared unto them; but do set themselves in opposition against the work of God both Rulers and Magistrates, Priests and People, all join themselves together in battel against the Lamb, but they shall not prevail, all is vain, the Lamb shall get the Victory, and
hath gotten the victory; our eyes have seen and beheld it; praises to his Name for evermore, who hath fulfilled, and is dai∣ly fulfilling his promise more and more; gathering his scatte∣red sheep together, where they have been scattered abroad in this cloudy dark day, many yeers the Lords people have been made a prey upon, but the true shepherd Christ Jesus is risen, & is bringing deliverance to his people; gathering them from the mouths of the false Shepherds, and bringing them into the fold of rest and peace, where they shall eat and be satisfied with li∣ving Refreshments in the bosome of the Fathers love, and there shall be one sheepfold and one Shepherd: Praises to the Lord the day is come, the happy day, the day of glad tydings which we long looked and waited for; the day of our God which is a day of glad tydings to weary and imprisoned Souls, and a day of vengeance and recompence of the Adversaries of God, as it is declared in the Prophets, The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord hath annoynted me to preach good tydings unto the meek, he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted; to proclaim liberty to the CAPTIVES, and the opening of the PRISON to them that are bound; to pro∣claim the acceptable YEER of the LORD, and the DAY of VENGEANCE of our God; to comfort all that mourn, to appoint unto them that mourn in ZION, to give unto them Beauty for Ashes; the oyl of joy for mourning; the Garment of Praise for the Spirit of Heavinesse; that they might bee called Trees of Righteousness, the Planting of the LORD. And this is the Lord fulfilling in our days, he is planting a garden of pleasant Plants, and watering and dressing them, that they may be fruitful, and is plucking up all the wild and fruitlesse plants, and casting them into the fire of his wrath there to be burned, that so his people may bee a holy and a peculiar people, that he may bee glorified; for hee is come (who is pure) to look for FRUITS, and all fruitlesse TREES must bee cut downe, and cast into the fire; For the LORD hath looked downe from Heaven, and behold the Land is corrupted; The Garden of the Lord is overspread with weeds; briars & thorns doth the earth
bring forth: and the faithfull City is become an harlot, as faith the Prophet, It was full of judgment: righteousness lodg∣ed in it, but now murderers: thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixt with water: thy Princes are rebellious, and com∣panions of thieves, every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards. See if it be not so now: They judge not the fatherless, neither doth the Cause of the Widdow come before them: therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah! I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine e∣himies, and I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tinne, and I will restore thy Judges as at the first, and thy Counsellors as at the be∣ginning: afterwards thou shalt be called The City of righte∣ousness, the faithfull City, Sion shall be redeemed with judg∣ment, and her Converts with righteousness: And now is this day come that the righteous God is pleading his Cause with his Enemies, and purging them with the spirit of judgment and of burning. And Judgment is begun, according as the Apostle foretold: for the time is that Judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall be the end of them that obey not the Gospel of God? Woe and misery will be their portion, and the destruction of the Transgressors and of the Sinners shall be together: and they that forsake the Lord, shall be consumed: for he will be glorified in this his day of Righteousnesse and just Judgement, which is now set up in the earth, which makes the Inhabitants thereof to learn righteous∣nesse, according to the saying of the Prophet Isaiah, The way of the just is uprightnesse, thou most upright dost weigh the path of the just; yea in the way of thy judgements, O Lord, have we waited for thee: the desire of our soul is to to thy Name, and to the remembrance of thee: With my Soul have I I desired thee; in he might; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early; for when thy judgements are in the earth, the Inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness: Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness, in the Land of Uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold
the Majesty of the Lord, though he stretcheth forth his Hand and calls to come forth of the Land of Darkness, and waiteth to be gracious; yet all this will not move him, nor break his heart, but goes on carelesly to destruction; and because sentence against an evill work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the Sons of Men is fully set in them to do evill. But now the day of just Judgement is come, and woe unto the wicked, it shall go ill with them, they shall not prolong their Days, because they fear not before the Lord, the righte∣ous God of Heaven and Earth who loves Righteousnesse, and no unrighteous one can have union and fellowship with him. And this is he, the living, pure, holy, righteous God, which the holy men of God did bear Testimony of, and the same pure holy God do I bear Testimony of, which is Light, and in him is no darknesse at all; who created man, and made him in his own Image, and gave him Dominion over all other creatures: But all have gone astray, and turned aside from the holy Com∣mand of God, and so have falne from the pure living God, and lost his Image, and are become aliens and strangers to Him, their Maker; the God of the world having blinded their minds, and stolne away their hearts from the love of the Creator, in∣to the Creature, and so their love is in the Creature, and worships and serves that more then the Creator, and their Bodies, which was the Temples of God, and in which was his image and likeness, the same is become a habitation for the Devil and all unclean lusts; and so the image and likeness of the Devil, who hath gotten possession, and sits as ruler and king in the heart, and leads the Creature captive at his will, to do his work which is unrighteousness: And here is the first mans state, which is from below of the Earth earthly, and mindes Earthly things, careing for the things of this life, what to eat, what to drink, and what to put on, labouring and stri∣ving by all ways and means to get great possessions, and to become great in the Earth, and to have the honour of the World which is below and lies in wickedness: and in this state men and women are striving to come again unto the Tree of life, and by their Earthly wisdom which is sensual and di∣velish, goes about to comprehend the things of God, but ne∣ver
can: it is a mysterie hid and sealed from this wisdom, and never can be known there: for the World by wisdom knows not God. But good and full of love is the Lord the righteous God, and by his wisdom hath found out a way contrary to the wit, will and wisdom of man, and that is of himself: for he hath given his son, his only begotten son, who is the son of his love: him hath he freely given for a Covenant of light to bring back a∣gain fallen man, which is driven from God into the Earth: and to reconcile him to his Maker, and renew that Image of God again, which by his disobedience he hath lost: and there is no way but by the Son: none knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him: And this is he which the Prophets prophesied of, and which the Apostles wit∣nessed to be the Light of the world, as John testifies, who came for a Witness to bear witness of the Light, and saith he, that was the true Light which lightneth every man that cometh into the world: and the same do I bear testimony unto, he who is the life and light of men, which lightneth every one that com∣eth into the world: and this light is true and pure, and stands a witness for the true and pure God, against all sin and un∣righteousness, and all the deeds done in the body, though ne∣ver so closely acted or intended: this true light doth not con∣sent, but reproves in secret for the secret evils that are con∣ceived in the evil heart against God: And when this witness doth arise in the conscience, and trouble man for his sin, and brings him to some sense and feeling of his miserable condition, that he lies under the Curse and wrath of Almighty God, and gives him some wound for his sin, and: and so man comes to see his nakedness with the light of the Sun: then fearing the wrath of God, doth fly from his presence, to actsomething to pacify the wrath of God: and so Adam-like, makes garments of fig-leavs to cover his nakedness: And here is the ground of all the forms and professions of godliness, that stands not in the Light, but are turned from the Light and fled the judgment, and run to the Scriptures without them, and so reads and gets a no∣tion of words, decking and painting themselves with the sheeps cloathing, and so read, and pray, and sing, and goe to hear
Sermons, and cover themselves with a Covering like the Spirit; but is not the Spirit, and so Wo is their Portion who are cover∣ed and not with the Spirit of the Lord: All this will not hide them nor cover their nakedness in the day of the Lord; all this doth not cleanse the heart, nor reform the inside; all this which the world calls Worship and Service of God, as Reading, Pray∣ing, Singing and Preaching (as it is called) or whatever is done in that state, it is no more but a Garment of Fig-Leafs, or patching a piece of new cloth in an old Garment; it is a false cover which wil not stand in the Fiery day; and this was the state of the Scribes and Pharisees, who had the Scriptures, Moses and the Prophets words, and were painted over with good words, but had not the Word of God abiding in them; so they were strangers to the Life and Power of God, and they did not be∣lieve in the Light Jesus Christ, who was the sum of all that which they upheld, which were but types and shadows and figures of him who was the Substance; and therefore Christ the Light cry∣ed wo unto them, calling them Hypocrites, whited Walls, pain∣ted Sepulchres, Serpents, Generation of Vipers who shut up the kingdom of heaven against men neither going in themselvs nor suffers others: And these were of the great men of the world, and learned men, Doctors and chief Priests, and the learned Rabbies; yet for all this their learning they knew not Christ, but called him a blasphemer, and those that did believe on him were called a cursed people that knew not the Law. Thus in all Ages profession was blind, who were not guided by the Light of Christ; & as it was then, it is now; all the world, Professors, Priests and People who deny the Light of Christ, and are not guided by it, all their Prayers and Sacrifices is abo∣mination, and stincks in the Nostrils of the pure God, iniquity being found within and regarded in their hearts; this will be the Sentence from the Righteous God, Go ye Cursed Workers of Iniquity, depart from me into everlasting Fore preaed for the Devil and his Angels. And here lies the world in wickednesse; and though many have long been seeking after God, yet have not found him, because they have been seeking the living among the dead; and though many have long been talking of the name of God and of Christ, yet few there be that walk in
the living way, and live the pure life of Christ; but Iniquity doth daily abound in the Nation amongst those that professe God: and that Pride, and Envie, and Wrath, Strife and Debate, Co∣vetousnesse, Cruelty, Tyranny and Oppression Drunkennesse, Lying, foolish Jesting, vain Sporting and Pleasures, that the Lands mourns, and the whole Creation groans with the Bon∣dage of Corruption; and the Name of the Lord is daily disho∣nored by this wicked and untoward Generation of Professors, both Priests and People, all are out of the pure Path in the hy∣pocrisie making a shew of Godlinesse, and drawing neer to God with their lips and with their mouths, but their hearts are far from him; and their Sacrifices and Prayers are as Cains Sacri∣fice who murdered his Brother. So these who live in Envy and Wrath, and false Accusing, Back-biting, Slandering, and Persecuting and Reproaching the Innocent harmlesse Lambs of Christ, and so are found in the same nature with Cain, for saith the Apostle, He that hateth his Brother is a Murderer, and no Murderer hath Eternal Life abi∣ding in him. And here all who are not wilfully blind may see the National and Parish-Teachers in the nature of Cain, in envy, and so not accepted of God: and all that uphold them they are seen in the Light of the Lord Jesus to be blind and are led by the blind, and both are going into the Ditch, who have turned from the measure of God, the Light that did and doth convince and re∣prove for sin and evil; and are soared up in the air climbing up another way: But if ever you know God or true peace to your souls, back you must come to that which doth reprove and trou∣ble for sin, that must speak peace if ever you know peace; and that will not speak peace to any who lives in sin; but he that fears God and departs from Iniquity, and waiteth upon God shall finde Peace and Rest to his Soul. Therefore all people whatsoever who read these Lines, seri∣ously consider your wayes, and no longer follow the Parish-Priests who preach for hire and seek gain from their quarter, and through feigned words and covetousnesse make merchan∣dise of your souls; they were never sent of God, and therefore they shall not profit you: Cease from them all, and wait on
the Lord in the Light of his Son Jesus, and learn of him who is meek and low in Spirit, and you shall finde rest to your souls: But while you live in your sins there is no rest, as saith the Pro∣phet, There is no peace to the wicked; but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, for the Lord is come in power and great glory; and is fulfilling his promise made of old, pouring forth his spirit upon his Sons and Daughters, and they shall be all taught of God, ad in righteousness shall they be established, and shall be far from Opprrssion, and no worker of Iniquity, nor any unclean thing can enter into the Covenant of God for this is the Covenant of the Lord, I will write my Law in their hearts, and put my spi∣rit in their inward parts, and they shall no more teach every man his Neighbor, nor every man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the greatest, and I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more saith the Lord: And this is our God ful∣filling in these our dayes his own Glory; to whom be everlasting Honor and Dominion for evermore. Witnessed by a Servant of the Lord who is come out of Egypt and through the Red-Sea and the Wildernesse, and arri∣ved at the Land of Rest, whose Name is after the flesh called, ALEX. PARKER.
The Minister of Christ, his plea for PURITY against the Ministers of Antichrist, and all their Train who plead for sin. ALL you that plead for sin, whether Priests or People, of what sort soever, who make a profession of the name of God and of Christ, and yet live in sin and plead for sin, and sayes none can be free from sin, or perfect from sin while they live upon the earth; all your talking and outside customary wor∣ship is in vain, and is no more but your own self-righteousnesse which is filthy and abominable, and it will never bring peace to your souls, nor you can never be reconciled to God as long as you live in sin; that's the cause of seperation from God, your sins; your sins have separated between you and me saith the Lord; and as long as sin stands, the Partition wall stands, for it stands betwixt you and the Lord; and there is no Union nor Fellowship with God nor with his Son as long as you live in sin, but aliens you are, and strangers from the pure God and the life of his Son Jsus: And you that plead so strongly for sin, you plead for the Devil whose servants you are as long you live in sin; and you are the Antichrists that are against Christ & oppose him and you are against the end of his coming and be∣ing manifested in flesh; for he came to take awaysin, and so he is called the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world; for, for this purpose was the Son of God made manifest, that he might destroy the works of the Devil, and to dispos∣sesse and cast out the strong man, and so to purifie the heart, and purge the conscience from dead works, and make it a fit Temple for himself to dwell in and he hath promised to dwell in his people and where he dwells purity dwells, and sin can∣not dwell with him, for it defiles and pollutes his Temple and if any man defile the Temple of God him shall God destroy, for the Temple of God is holy, which Temple ye are (speaking to the Saints:) Now this I say, That all sin defiles, as Envy, Wrath, Malice, Pride, Lust, Covetousnesse, and the like; if these evils lodge in your hearts, it is evident and plainly mani∣fest
that the Devil the strong man lodgeth and is axalted above all that is called God in your hearts, and keeps possession there; for all these evils and abominations that are acted and done in the world, the Devil is the Author and Father of them, who hath begotten them into his Image and likenesse to do his will and works, which are works of darknesse; and so all you that live in sin, as pride, hatred, variance, debate, drunkennesse, swearing, lying, false accusing, cozening and cheating in your buyings and sellings, using false weights and measures, and say∣ing and unsaying, boasting of your Wares to be so, and so, when many times you know to the contrary; and so lie one to another to get dishonest gain, and make a prey of the simple, who have not so much of the subtle Serpents wisdom as your selves. All these are the works of the Devil, and as long as you live in these practises the Devil leads you, and so you become his Servants, for his Servants you are, to whom you yeild your selves servants to obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obe∣dience unto righteousnesse, for the wages of sin is death: and all who go in their sin, satisfying and fulfilling the lusts and de∣sires of the flesh, and going from God in the broad way that leads to destruction. But the Serpent is grown very subtle, and the better to hide and cover himself, he brings Scripture to up∣hold his Kingdom all that he can gather up as he conceives makes for his purpose, that he brings, and his Servants make use of to oppose the pure Doctrine of the Son of God, and his faithful and true Ministers, who are sent of God to open the blind eyes, to turn them from darkness unto Light, and from Satant pow∣er unto God, and to present them perfect in Christ Jesus: But saith the Serpent and the Ministers of Antichrist, It is not possible that ever any one should be free from sin while they live; did not David sin, and Peter sin? and did not Paul cry out of a body of sin? and are you better then the Apostles? Thus the carnal professors of our time plead for their Kingdom, being blinded by the God of the World, that the Light of the Glorious Gospel of JESUS CHRIST which makes free from sin, this they know not.
Now all people consider, and see what you do uphold and what you do plead for; will this Plea stand at the great and dreadful Day when the Lord calls you to an Account, to say that others were sinners, & bring that as a cloak to cover you? No, this will not cover you in that dreadful Day of Account; for though David did sin yet he repented, and had no peace till the Lord had pardoned his sin: He wept until his eyes grew dim and his flesh did fail of fatness; he watered his Couch with his tears. Is it so with you? Are you brought down as David was? and though David left these things upon Record, it was not to encourage others to go on in sin, but that all might take example not to do the like, lest the terror and wrath of God come upon them for their rebellion against so good a God: but you stil go on in your vile courses, and instead of being hum∣bled by the example of others that have sinned, you bring it to uphold you in your sins; and so goes on daily, treasuring up to your selves wrath against the day of Wrath, which none of them did that you bring the failings of; where did David sin again? or Peer? or Paul? but were made instrumental to turn many from their sins: So you being ignorant of the conditi∣ons of the Saints mentioned in Scripture, brings one condition to oppose another; for there was a time when they were dead in sins and trespasses, and were aliens and strangers from the Covenant of Promise; and there was a time when they were dead unto sin, and alive unto God; being reconciled unto God, havnig put off the body of the sin of the flesh, and had put on Christ, and were alive in him, and created in him unto good Works; and by the Son of God, the Covenant of the Father, they were made free from sin, and had passed from death unto life, and Christ lived in them, who had given them the Victory over their sin, and defaced and blotted out the image of the de∣vil, and renewed his own Image in them: and though Paul do speak of a warfare that was in his growth, and through patient waiting in the Crosse of Christ, he witnessed a victory and prai∣sed God who had given him the Victory; so he speaks of seve∣ral times and conditions, as a time without the Law, I was alive without the Law once, and he speaks of a time under the Law, and a time of being made free from the Law, which things you
must all know and witnesse manifested and fulfilled in you if e∣ver you know the truth in its purity; for through the same door that all the holy men of God did passe, must you passe, or else you cannot come to the same rest: And this door and this way is straight; you cannot enter in with your old Garments, you must be stripped of all, end become as a little child, or else you cannot enter; you must know the work of God within you, and the operation of his Power, and his Righteous Law set up with∣in you to kill sin in its rise and conception in your hearts, then will you know the war between the Beast and the Lamb, and the flesh lusting against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, that ye cannot do the things that ye would; and this was Paus time of crying out; for saith he When we were in the flesh the motions of sin that were by the Law, did work in our e∣bers to bring forth fruit unto death; but now we are delivered from the Law, that being dead unto which, we were hold that we should serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the Letter; for I was alive without the Law once, but when the Command∣ment came, sin revived and I died: When Paul came to know the Law of the new Covenant written in his heart, he then saw the body of sin, and the Law in his Members warring against the Law of his minde, which led him into captivity into the Law of sin and death, and made him wretched; but the Law was good, as the Apostle confesses, It is holy, just and good; the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin; for the good I would do, I do not; and the evil I would not do, that do I: Now all the carnal Professors would own Paul here, and bring these words to hide and cover them in their sins, and so are at ease in their sins, alive without the Law; but Paul had not peace in this condition, but groaned and travelled under the burden of sin; but through Christ he thanked God who had given him the Victory; and even at that time when he writ that Epistle to the Roman he was made free from sin, though he declares of such a condition, speaking to them that know the Law, for to them; that were under the Law he became as under the Law; For when we were in the flsh, the motions of sin that were by the Law did work in our member, &c but now we are delivered, now there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not
after the flesh but after the spirit; for the Law of the Spirit of  in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the Law of sin and death; (mark it well, hath mad me free; not will or shall, but he was then made free) for what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and by a Sacrifice for sin condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousnest of the Law might be fulfilled in us (mind you here, The righteousness of the Law fulfilled in us) who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit: So here you may see he speaks of a time without the Law, and a time under the Law, where the Law was fulfilled in him; and so passing through the Law, he became dead unto the Law, as he declares in another place, For I through the Law am dead unto the Law, that I might live unto God: I am crucified with Christ; yet nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: Come now and try your selves all you formal and carnal Professors, can you own Paul in this conditi∣on? are you crucified with Christ? or are you alive in your sins? are you crucified to the world and the world unto you? Answer, Paul was so: But are not you wallowing in your sins, living in the pleasures of the world, and no separation made from the world, but even with all your strength griping after the world, loving it, and seeking the honor and glory of the world, which Paul was crucified unto, though once he cried out of the body of sin; and so patiently waiting in the crosse of Christ, he wit∣nessed a Victory. And so as the eyes of your understandings comes to be ope∣ned, these things will be clear, and you will see the times, that Paul declareth and is left upon Record in the Scriptures of Truth; a time without the Law, and a time under the Law, and a time when he witnessed Christ Jesus the end of the Law: and whereas he saith in one place, I am carnal; he saith in another place, I am crucified; and this is plain to those who have expe∣rience of the workings of God; for that I which was carnal by the Law which was Spiritual, was crucified, and then no more I, but . And this was the mysterie that Paul preached, which was hid from Ages and generations but now is made ma∣nifest in his Saints, which Mystery is Christ in you the hope of glo∣ry, whom we preach, teaching and exhorting every man in all wis∣dom,
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. Now this I say, where Christ is manifested sin and iniquity is done a∣way, and the body of sin destroyed and dead; for if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; and if any be in Christ he is a new Creature, Old things are passed away, and behold all things are become new: and if all things are become new, then where is there room for sin, for that is of the old things which passeth away, and doth defile and enters not into the Kingdom of God which stands in righteousnesse; and this is your cry, VVhere were there any that was without sin? I Answer, They that were in Christ and did abide in him were without sin, and werenew creatures; and if you say that none were or are in Christ, then I shall bring the Scripture-Testimony against you, where they bear Testimony of the Son, For we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding to him that is true, and we are in him; [mark well, they were in him] that is true, even in his Son Christ Jesus: and here the Scripture de∣clares that some were in Christ, and if any be in Christ he is a new creature; and they that are Christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts; and if the affections and lusts be crucified, then where is the sin or the cause of sin, for lust is the ground of all sin; for as the Apostle saith, There is no man temp∣ted of God, but every man when he is tempted, he is drawn away of his lust, for the lust goes forth, and sin is conceived in the heart, and after it is cenceived it brings forth sin, and sin being finished brings forth death: So the rise of sin is from the lust, which is conceived in the deceitful and deceived heart; but where the life and power of Christ is manifested, and the devils works de∣stroyed, and the creature redeemed from the bondage of cor∣ruption into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, and is be∣come Christs, bought and redeemed by him, and hath crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts, then where is sin you so much plead for, which is a plant of your Father the Devil whose children and servants ye are as long as you are doing his work, and pleading to uphold that which Christ comes to destroy? but surely you are deceived by him, for none such Plants shall grow in my Fathers Garden; but they must all be plucked up and cast into the fire.
And again, the Enemies of pure Truth who are bent and set to oppose Christ, they bring another place of Scripture, and thinks they are strongly fenced here, where it is said, If we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us: This place is strongly pleaded by all sorts of people and Profes∣sors, who are not in the pure life of Christ; but praised for ever∣more be the righteous God, who hath hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to Babes: Now for the simple ones sake I shall speak and declare, that their minds may be informed, and that they may not be kept in blindnesse by the God of the world: The Apostle John was come to high attainments, and saw through the vail; he saw the first mans state where all are dead in sin; and he saw the second mans state which was born of God and could not sin: Now the natural man by all his wit & wisdom cannot comprehend these things; for as it is written, The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, for they are spiritually discerned: So it is the Spirit that reveales the deep and hidden things of God; and by the Spirit of God it is seen that the Apostle speaks to a condition before confession of sin; and whereas he saith we, many times they say we when they are passed from such conitions; as sames saith, speaking of the tongue, herewith bless we God, and there∣with curse we men: but was fames a curser? But read the fol∣lowing Verse, where John saith, But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to foroive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness; and if you say that John had not confessed his sin, I bear testimony, and the Scripture likewise testifie the same, that he had both confessed and forsaken his sins, for his fellow∣ship was with the Father and the Son; and you may see in the beginning of the Chapter, Truy saith he] our followship is with the Father and the Son: Now if John had been in the un∣regenerate state, and had not confessed his sin, then could he not have had Union and Fellowship with the Father; for God is Light, and in him is no darkness a all, if we say e have fellow∣ship with God and walk in darkness we lie, and do not the truth; but if we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, we have union and fellowship one with another; and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
cleanseth us from all sin, (mark well, he doth not say from part of your sins, but from all sin) and this is that testimony that we bear of Christ, That his blood cleanseth from all sin, and he sa∣veth to the utmost all that come unto God by him; so if the Son make you free, then are you free indeed: But we do not speak of any freedom but by the light, life and power of Jesus; for if any one say he hath no sin before he come to witnesse Repent∣ance, and the power of Christ not being manifested in him to destroy & take away his Sin, he doth deceive himself, & the wit∣nesse of God in his own conscience will testifie against him; for if we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar; but where the life and power of Christ is manifested, and the Devils works destroyed, and the heart purified, and the body made a temple of God, shall we deny the work of God? No; far be it from us, but to declare his Name abroad in the earth, that others may dread and fear before him, and pent of the evil of their ways; that so they might rejoice with us in the love of our God, and eat with us on the bread of life in our Fathers house, that they may be changed and renewed, and witness the birth which is from above, which except a man be born again he cannot see the Kingdom of God. Now this birth and this change hath long been talked of, but who are they that are changed and born again? Surely some there are, God hath some of his own begetting; and the Apo∣stle saith, He that is born of God sins not, for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God; but this the world and the children of darknesse cannot believe, nor endure to hear tell of; but ready to tear and rend if any one come to know and witnesse a change. And so all you that plead for sin, you may see whom you serve; even the devil the Prince of Darknesse, who leads you & guides you as long as you live in sin: But blessed be God the happy day is come, and the Lord hath many children who are begot∣ten by the eternal Spirit, and are kept by his power & strength that the wicked one cannot touch them according as the Apo∣stle testifieth, VVe know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not, but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself that the wicked one toucheth him not; let no man therefore deceive you with words, for
he that doth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous; and he that commits sin is of the Devil; hereby are the children of God manifest and the children of the Devil: So all you that live in Envy and Wrath, speaking evil of the things you know not, you manifest your selves to be of the devil who hath begotten you into his image and likeness to do his lusts: and so being af∣ter the flesh are found persecutors of them that are born after the Spirit, as it was in former ages and generations, the chil∣dren of God were ever hated and reproached by the world; but it is our joy, accounting it great riches that we are counted worthy to suffer for his Names sake; knowing this, that all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. A Paper, shewing who they are that are blessed, and who they are that are cursed. BLessed is the man that feareth the Lord, and walketh in his way: he shall be kept in peace when all the world is in trouble. And Misery and no peace unto them who be out of the fear of God, and out of the way of life, in the broad way that leads to destruction; following lusts, and pleasures, sport∣ing themselves in the day-time; you that live after the Course of this wicked world, not regenerated and born again of the Word of God, but live in your old, vain, wicked, ungodly and vile courses in the fallen state, bringing forth cursed fruits from the cursed ground, sowing to the flesh, and satisfying the lusts of it; living in lying, and swearing; and drunkennesse, spend∣ing the creatures of God upon your lusts; drinking one to ano∣ther, and tempting one another wit Ale and Beere until you
be overcome, and so like Swine wallowing in the Lusts of Un∣cleannesse; you bear the Image of your Father the Devil, whose children and servants you are while you continue in your sins and filthinesse, you are of the cursed Generation, and wo and misery is your portion. Wo, wo to all the Inhabitants of the earth, the Devil is come down amongst you, and he rageth and swells because he hath but a short time: The day draweth nigh, it hasteth greatly, wherein every one of your works must be tried by fire; and the Devil together with the false Prophets, and all you who bear his Mark must be cast into the Lake of Fire, there to be tormented for ever and ever, from the presence of the Lord and all his holy Angels and Saints; this will be your Sentence from the righteous God, Depart from me all ye workers of Iniquity. Consider of this in your life time you that are so full of rage and malice, scoffing and scorning, and reproaching the Servants and Messengers of the Lord, who are sent of God to give you warning, and to open your blind eyes, and to turn you from your sins and from darknesse unto Light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that you might receive forgivenesse of sins, and an Inheritance amongst the Saints in Light; and this freely as they are moved of the Lord from the bowels of tender love to your lost souls, without any self-end, not seeking for a gift or any reward from any of you; not seek∣ing yours, but you; yet notwithstanding all their care, labour and travel, see how you do reward them mocking and scoffing, and envying of them, haling them out of your Synagogues, and beating them, sending many to the Stocks, and haling o∣thers before Magistrates and so to Prison, and there the inno∣cent suffers under the hands of cruel men, many being beaten and cruelly used in the PRISONS by the cruel GOAL∣ERS, Witnesse the GOALER at LANCESTON, where many of the deare Servants of the LORD have been cast into PRISONS among THIEVES and MUR∣DERERS, and have been numbred amongst TRANS∣GRESSORS (as our LORD and MASTER was) and many of them have been cruelly beaten and most basely abused by the GOALER and his COMPA∣NIONS. And all this and much more is done
against the innocent, whom you cannot justly accuse of any evil nor wrong done to any man, but freely declaring against sin in Markets, Cities and Villages, and in your Idols-temple, where the Worship of the Beast is upheld, to call you from your false wayes and false Worships, into the true and living way, and pure and Spiritual Worship, to worship God in Spirit and in Truth, and to call you from off all your hireling-Priests and Parish-Teachers, who have long time led you in blindnesse and ignorance, and have not profited you, but made a prey up∣on your souls for dishonest gain, that so you may all be taught of God in Spirit according to the Fathers Promise; and all this is done unto you freely, without seeking any gain or reward from you; and yet notwithstanding all this love and tender care for your souls, you envy and hate them, and so manifest your selves to be of Cains Generation, and your Sacrifices are abo∣mination to God, and not accepted of him; for our God is pure, and there is nothing accepted of him but that which is offered up from a pure heart, for the pure in heart are blessed and shall see God, as it is written in the Scripture: but woe is the porti∣on of the wicked, they are of the cursed Generation, and all your Sacrifices, reading, singing, praying, preaching and ex∣pounding, and whatever you call a Worship, and all your pro∣fession and talking of God & Christ, it is all abomination while sin and iniquity lodgeth and is regarded in your hearts, it is no more but your own self-righteousnesse, acted in your own wills which is as filthy rags, and as menstruous clothes, and it will not abide the fire; nor stand in the day of trial: you are but pat∣ching a piece of new cloth in the old Garment, and the Rent will be worse: your gilded outside and fair pretences, your talk∣ing of the Scriptures and painting your selves over with the Saints words, it is but sowing of fig-leafs together to cover your nakednesse, and it will not hide you from the wrath of the Lamb, neither will it stand you in any stead where the life and power of Christ is wanting: you are stil out of the way of God, for though you professe much in words, and draw neer unto God with your lips and mouths, yet it is not saying Lord, Lord that will avail, but he that doth the will of my Father shall en∣ter into the Kingdom, for it is the heart which he requires,
and as long as the devil and sin lodgeth in your hearts, in vain is all your talking and going to hear Sermons: It is not your go∣ing one day in seven (or more) to hear a man speak a compa∣ny of words, and then all the week after to follow your own lusts and pleasures without yoke and bridle, no crosse nor limit to the carnal minde, but all is at liberty; you can speak your own words, and think your own thoughts, and do your own works, and sport your selves in your vanities, your tongues at liberty to speak vain words; this is not the worship of God, but a false worship, and a vain Religion, and wo is the end of it, as it was to the Scribes and Pharisee, who were high in notion, and professed much in words, yet notwithstanding all their out∣side cleansing and Scripture knowledge, they were strangers to the life of truth and crucified the Son of God; and their pro∣fession was but hypocrisie, and Christ cried wo unto them, cal∣ling them Whited wall, painted Sepulchres, who me cea the outside of the Cup and Platter, but the inside was not made clean. So all you now that talk of the Scriptures, and do not live in that pure life that they lived in that gave forth the Scrip∣tures, you are hypocrites, and your profession & outside clean∣sing is but Pharisaical, and except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharsees, you cannot enter into te Kingdom of God. Now search and try your selves, and see if your righteousnesse go any further then theirs did; (nay, doth it go so far? they made clean the outside, but are not you unclean both within and without? To that of God in all your Conferenc I speak and appeal, that with it you may try and ex∣amine, and see what you can witnesse of your return unto the Lord your God whar is cut down in you, or what change is wrought in your hearts, for there must the work of God be known if ever you know the truth in its purity; for with the whole heart will the Lord be served, for he calls for it, as it is written, My Son give me thy heart, and as long as sin lodgeth in the heart, the devil lodgeth, for all sin is of the devil, as it is declared, He that commits sin is of the devil and as long as the devils works are standing within you, your profession of Christ without you will not avail, until his life and power be witnes∣sed
within you to destroy the devils works; for for this end & pur∣pose was the Son of God made manifest, that he might destroy the works of the Devil; and all sin is a work of the devil: And sin is conceived in the heart which is deceitful, and there lodg∣eth in the heart, and defiles and pollutes the heart, as Envy, Wrath, Malice, Pride, Lust and Covetousnesse, Murders, Theft, evil surmisings, these and such like are works of the Devil, Plants of his planting, and these do defile a man, and separates him from his Maker: And as the Devils work is within in the heart, and pollutes the heart, so must the work of Christ be witnessed in the heart for the purifying and cleansing, and de∣stroying of the Devils works, and so to make the body a fit Temple for himself to dwell in. And this is the work of the Lord, and it is marvellous in our eyes; he is gathering his people into union and fellowship with himself, breaking the bond of iniquity, and letting the oppres∣sed go free purifying and purging them with the Spirit of Judg∣ment and of burning; trying them as gold and silver is tryed, that so his people may be a holy and a peculiar people; a people in whom he will be glorified by a pure and a godly conversati∣on, who shall bring forth much fruit to his glory, who hath re∣deemed them from the earth, and from their vain and ungodly conversation. We who were gone astray, and wandring as Sheep without a Shepherd, and were by nature the children of Wrath even as well as others, hath the Lord wonderfully wrought his own work in us, and called us out of death and darknesse into righ∣teousnesse and peace, to bring forth fruits of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse, meeknesse, temperance, sobernesse and vertue, and hath shed abroad his love in our hearts, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation, to Minister unto others who sit in the shadow of death, that you all may turn and repent, and come into the way of life, that your souls may live, in which way the ungod∣ly cannotwalk though it be a plain way, that fools shal not enter therein, yet the unclean cannot passe over it; and this is the new and living way that leads to life eternal, even Jesus Christ the onely begotten of the Father, who is given of the Father
freely for a Covenant of Light to enlighten the Gentiles, and to be the glory of his people; who is the alone way unto the Father as it is testified of him, I am the Way, the Truth ad the Life, and there is no man can come to the Father but by me. I am the door, and he that enters not in by the door is a thief and a Rob∣ber. Now people every where who professe your selves to be Chri∣stians, and Christ to be your way, see if your lives be answerable to your profession, for this I do declare from the Lord, that no ungodly one can walk in this way: Come and let us reason to∣gether, you will all confesse with me that Christ is pure, holy and righteous, and he is the way to the Father and no other way; then what way are the ungodly in; who live in pride and covetousnesse, envy, wrath and malice? you that live in the lusts of the flesh, and the pleasures and hope of the world, are you in Christ the way? surely no; you do but deceive your selves to think that you are in the way to salvation, when you are going on the broad way to condemnation; for Christ speaks of ano∣ther way, which all who live in sin are walking in, They en∣ter not in by the door, but are climbing up another way, building up Babel, a Tower to reach up to heaven, but the foundation is sandy and will not stand, who are sayers and not doers, and are in their sins alive, in their old cross and perverse nature, and so are one of Christ the way; for if any man be in Christ he is a new Creature, old things are passed away, and behold all thingt are become new; (Minde this well, all things are become new) it is not refor∣ming of some things and departing with some of your sins, but all the old lusts must be denied, all your old wayes, and your old vain heathenish customs; the old man must be wholly put off, and the new man Christ Jesus put on. Therefore cease from the evil of your wayes, and put away lying, and speak truth one to another, and leave off your pro∣phane Swearing, and let your yea be yea, and your nay nay; for whatsoever is more is evil, and out of the Doctrine of Christ; and lay aside all Envie and Malice, and all vain and needlesse Discourse which tends not to the Glory of God, nor to edifi∣cation of one another; and let your words be few, and in the fear of the Lord, and put off all your Pride, and lay down
your Crowns at the feet of Jesus, and learn humility and the fear of the Lord, that your feet may be guided out of the pathes of death, and from all unrighteousnesse and diso∣bedience; where the Curse of God is, that you may walk in the way of the Lord and in his pure fear, to stand in awe of him, that so your hearts may be purified, and your consciences pur∣ged from dead works, to serve the Lord in the new life, with a pure and a perfect heart, that into his Covenant of life and peace where the blessing is, you may all be led, and eat the Bread of Life at the Table of the Lord, that your souls may live and praise the Lord for evermore. Written in love to all Souls, that out of sin they may come, and worship God in Spirit. By a Ser∣vant of Chrict. Alex. Parker.
To all the Beloved Ones, who are of the Royal Seed, whose faces be turned tovvards Sion. Greeting, DEarly beloved Friends, you whom the Lord hath Visited in his Love, and hath called you out of darknesse and your former vain Conversation, into his marvelous Light and glori∣ous Liberty of the Sons of God, when many thousands are left in blindnesse and hardnesse of heart, ful of envie and rage, & shut up in darknesse, being alienated from the life of God, and stran∣gers from the Covenant of Promise. Oh prize his love unto you! a Remnant of despised ones, yet beloved of God, who hath called you with an holy Calling, and separated you from the world of ungodly men, that you may be a holy and a pecu∣liar people without spot or wrinckle, that you may be presented pure and perfect unto God. Now my dear friends be valiant for your Freedom, and stand in that Liberty wherein Christ hath set you free, and be not a∣gain entangled with the yoke of bondage, and the weak and beggarly Elements of the world; give not away your strength unto the Harlot; though Sinners entice you consent not to them; but stand in the counsel of God, and keep your habitati∣ons, dwelling in that which is pure which ye have received from God, waiting in patience for power from the Lord to give you a full deliverance over the world and the pollutions and lusts of it, that over it you may raign and all its fading Treasures, lay∣ing up to your selves Treasures which never sades away, dura∣ble riches, where the Rust and Moth cannot come. Dwell low in the pure fear of the Lord, for there is safety, that keeps the heart clean; and so the pure wisdom from above is received into the pure heart; and bring all your deeds to the Light, that so they may be proved and tried, whether or no they be wrought in God. Weigh your words and your Actions in the ballance of equi∣ty, and be upright and just in all your dealings amongst men in
your buyings and sellings, and whatsoever things you take in hand; let the Light of Jesus be your guide, that so your consci∣ences may be exercised towards God and man, that you may be kept blamelesse and harmlesse, as children of God amongst this wicked and untoward Generation of men, who daily watch with an evil eye for your halting, thereby to take occasion to blaspheme God and his pure Truth, which ye in a measure are growing up in; and in a good measure redeemed from the vile and filthie conversation of the world. Dear Friends, keep nothing back, but freely give up into the Will of God that which is for the Sword to the Sword, and that which is for the Famine to the Famine; and what is for the Fire to the Fire, that you may be thorowly cleansed and purifi∣ed, and tried as Gold and Silver is tried. Whatsoever the Light of Christ doth discover unto you to be evil and an enemy to your souls, cast it off, hide not the enemies of your peace in your own bosoms; for whatsoever you keep back will be as thorns in your sides, and as pricks in your eyes: Therefore cast off every weight and burden, that you may run with cheerful∣nesse the Race set before you, that through the trials and tribu∣lations you may come, and so enjoy the promised Land; for through many tribulations and fiery trials doth the children of God passe; for the children of Israel after they were come forth of Egypt, had many Enemies to war withall before they came to the promised Land, and many fainted in the way, and through unbelief fell in the Wildernesse; which things are written and left upon Record, that those that should come af∣ter might take warning, and not give way to the Tempter, least they fall as they did, and so come short of the eternal rest. Therefore every one of you take warning, and take heed least there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in depart∣ing from the living God: but abide in the measure of God which is pure and perfect, though but as a grain of Mustard-Seed; yet wait, and you will finde the growth of it. When tri∣als come be content; murmure not, but endure with patience the chastning of the Lord, for every child whom he loves he rebukes and chastens; for he that is not corrected and chastised of the Lord, is a Bastard and no Son.
And now is the time come, that Judgement is begun at the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what will become of the wicked and them that obey not the Gospel of God? Surely wo will be their portion, and condemnation and misery will be the end of ungodly men; but blessed are they that suffer tribulati∣on and persecution for righteousnesse sake, they shall inherit the Kingdom of Glory; he that overcomes and endures to the end shall be crowned with Victorie, and shall eat of the hidden Manna, and have right unto the Tree of Life, and shall have Vnion and Fellowship with the Father and the Son, and reign with the Lord God and the Lamb in the holy City for ever and ever. Therefore though you now be afflicted, be not cast down through unbelief, though you now weep and mourn, and be reproach∣ed and reyiled, yet your sorrow shall be turned into joy; it is but for a little moment of time, until the night and the stormy day be over, and then will come a calm; though sorrow and trouble may endure for a night, yet joy will come in the morn∣ing, when the Day-star doth arise, and the glorious day of the Lord doth dawn in your hearts, then shall darknesse be expel∣led, and sorrow and sighing flie away, and the presence of the Lord in the Light shall be seen, in whose presence there is glad∣nesse and great joy; and you all his faithful ones, who have pas∣sed through many tribulations, and have not loved your lives unto death, shall worship him in his holy Temple; and there∣shall be no need of light, of Sun, Moon or Candle; but the glo∣ry of the Lord shall fill the Temple, and shall be a Light conti∣nually for all his dear children to walk in. So all my dearlie beloved ones, who are in the time of trou∣ble and trial, with you I do partake, and bear part of your bur∣then, as being a Member of the same body; and if one Member suffer, all the Members suffers with it; and though you come to such a condition, trouble within and trouble without, on eve∣ry side Enemies, yet do not distrust God, neither look back in∣to the world of darknesse again, there is no help for you there; but as the Children of Israel in former time were incompassed about, Pharoah behinde and the Red Sea before, and on either side Mountains, they were even ready to faint and murmure;
but Moses the Servant of the Lord, who was chosen to be their Leader out of Egypt, he exhorted them to stand still and see the salvation of God: they were not to stand still in Egypt; but being come forth of Egypt, the Lord shewed his wonderful hand in preservin g of them. So I say unto you dear friends, who are come forth of the Egyptian darknesse, and are deliver∣ed from those grosse evils that the world lives in, and have a light born up in your understandings to lead you, but yet do finde many enemies warring against you, even they of your own house; so that you know not what to do nor which way to go to finde peace. I say unto you, will nothing, neither do you run before your guide, but stand still in the Light that dis∣covers your Enemies, and there wait in the will of God, and you will see salvation from the Lord by his living Power, bind∣ing and chaining, and subduing the strong Enemies which wars against your souls; and so a secret hope will be begotten in you (by the powerful Word of the Lord, which is night in your hearts) which doth purifie your hearts; and that which former∣lie you committed, imposlible, by Faith, in the Light which comes from the Son of God, you see to be possible; and the Lords perfect work being begun in you, you have a strong hope, and knows assuredlie, that he who hath begun a good work in you, he will perfect it to his own glorie: And he that hath this hope, purifies himself even as Christ is pure. And here is the patience and the Faith of Saints, which though never so little, if it be but as a grain of Mustard Seed, it removes the strong and high Mountains of Sin, and gives victorie over the the world and the lusts of it, and so purifies the heart. And this is the true and the living Faith, which the Saints of God were in, who were of one heart and one soul; and it is the same now as it was then; and all who are in this Faith, by it their hearts are purified, and so are led into purity and one-ness of minde and heart, to serve and worship one living and true God, in one living and pure way, which is in spirit and in truth, where there is no rent nor division, but pure love and union, written in one anothers hearts with the Spirit of the living God.
So in the light which from the Lord Jesus Christ doth come, who is the true Light which lighteth every one that cometh in∣to the world; which Light is but one in all, though thousand times ten thousands, this Light is pure and but one; and all who love it and believe in it, are led into onenesse and Unity of Spirit, In it every one wait and walk, that you may he led out of death and darknesse, and all the untoward wayes of the world, into the pure way of Righteousnesse and Peace to follow Christ in the narrow Path, which whosoever follows shall not walk in darknesse, but shall have the Light of Life. And dwell in love and union, watching over one another with a pure  and be tender over one another, as Members all of one , and if any be overtaken with a fault, you that are spiritual re∣store such a one in the Spirit of meeknesse, that shame and con∣demnation may come upon the transgressor, and the innocent may be set free; and let not the cursed thing lodge among you, but be ye holy in all manner of conversation, because the Lord our God is holy, and no unclean thing can dwell with him nor enter into his righteous Kingdom: Therefore be ye separate from the ungodly world, and touch no unclean thing, and the Lord will receive you, and will be to you as a Father, and you shall be his Sons and Daughters. Cast away all filthinesse from amongst you, and let no prejudice lodge nor rest within any of you, but forgive one another as God in Christ hath forgiven you; for if you do not forgive men their trespasses, no more will your heavenly Father forgive your trespasses; therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do you likewise unto them, for this is the Doctrine of Christ, and it is not the sayer, but he that both his Will shall know his Doc∣trine. So the Lord in pure Wisdom keep you and preserve you out of all strife and contention, that a daylie growth there may be amongst you, that you all may be established in the living truth, no more to be tossed to and fro with mens Doctrines which be changeable, but all wait upon God in the Light which never changes, that you may be all taught of God, and every parti∣cular may feed upon your own food, and have sufficient bread
in your own houses to feed upon that there be not a beggar in Israel, nor no Vagabond, but that all of you may have a habi∣tation in God, and grow up in him, that the Springs of life may be opened, and your souls may be fullie refreshed with the bread of life in my Fathers house. And all my beloved Friends keep your habitations, and stand upon your Watch, that you may hear the voice of your belo∣ved when he calls, and be obedient to his voice and do his will; and after you have done his will take heed of exaltation, but wait in patience that you may receive the Promise; for the same that is unwilling to obey the will of God when the will of God is obeyed, will get up into presumption; and that which doth presume in the time of trial will despair. Therefore every one be watchful, and keep the door of the house of the Lord, that the Enemie enter not to defile and pol∣lute his holie Temple. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left, but keep in the even and plain way. When joy and refresh∣ment comes take heed of exaltation: And again, when trou∣ble, and crosses and afflictions comes, do not fall into despara∣tion; but wait at Wisdoms Gate that you may be seasoned with Grace, having salt in your selves to savor withal, that you be not drawn away with the errors of the wicked; but that all of you may be daylie refreshed and grow up in strength until you come to a perfect man in Christ Jesus; the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, and establish you in the Truth. Written in love to your souls, by way of remem∣brance to stir up your pure mindes; by your dear Brother, who is a laborer in the Lords vineyard, ALEX. PAREER. For Friends in the Truth to be read at their meet∣tings when they are met together in the fear of the Lord. Corrnwal, 31. day of the 5th. Month, 1656.
The Night is far spent, and the Day is at hand, awake, arise from the dead, that Christ may give you Light: Cease from all the blinde Guides, they deceive you; try them, and by their fruits ye shall know them. BEware of false Prophets which come to you in Sheeps clo∣thing, but inwardlie they are ravening Wolves; ye shall know them by their fruits: Mat. 7.15. to the 21. &c. Do men gather Grapes of Thorns? or Figs of Thistles? even so everie good Tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit: A good Tree can∣not bring forth evil Fruit; neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit: Everie Tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire; wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Now all people everie where who have long been led by blind guides, and have been deceived by the false Prophets who have got the Sheeps clothing, and decked and painted themselves with the Saints words; but where is the fruit that is brought forth? it is their fruits that makes them manifest; the Lord looks for fruit; but here is nothing but leafs, here is fine Trees with flourishing leafs, but no fruit appears, much talk and pro∣fession of God and of Christ there hath been in this Nation of England; fair outsides, glorious words, but the life is wanting, there is no fruits, but all manner of unrighteousnesse doth a∣bound in the Nation: Doth not pride abound? and covetous∣nesse, drunkennesse, swearing, lying, and all manner of un∣righteousnesse? the Land is full of fruitlesse Trees, the boughs even sway and are readie to break down, they are so full of the evil fruit: pride is come to such a height that thepeople do scarce know how to walk, nor what to put on; it would even grieve a sober Spirit to see the vanitie of the times, both men and wo∣men painting themselves in their gorgeous attire, fashioning themselves according to the custom and course of this wicked vain world, the inventing mind which is estranged from God, inventing new things and new fashions to please the curious
minde, and so one fashion comes up (which is invented in the fallen wisdom) and the lust runs into it, and gets into that fa∣shion, and after a certain time grows wearie of it and it passeth away: And the same venting minde which is out of the truth invents another new Fashion, and the people of all sorts (as far as their money will reach) they get into that fashion, and after a little time it passeth away; and so the world passes away and the lusts of it, and the people spend their time according to the course of the world; yea, those who professe themselves Mini∣sters and Teachers in the Nation, who should be examples unto others, even these are as bad & as phantastick as the rest; they and their Wives go in as great height and pride as any people; nay do they not exceed many in pride and vanitie. The poor labouring man working in the sweat of his brows to get his li∣ving and to maintain his wife and Familie, the Priest or his A∣gent comes and he must have a part (yea and a great part too) of what the poor people have laboured hard for: and this the Priest and his Wife and Children spend upon their lusts, their Wives and their Children going in their Huds and Veils and changeable Suits of Apparel: even the sins of Sodom and Go∣morrah are found amongst them, Pride, fulnesse and abundance of idlenesse; and if any one refuse to give them money, then do they go to Law and compel them by force, which never any of the Lords true Ministers ever did, neither Prophets nor A∣postles: And let any of the Servants of the Lord come into their Assemblies and declare against their filthie and covetous practices, then their rage and envie arises against the Servants of the Lord, and some are beaten in their Synagogues, and some are haled forth, some stocked, some stoned, some sent to Prison: and they cry unto the people their Hearers, Beware of False Prophets: these be the False Prophets in Sheeps clothing, hearken not to them, take heed of going to them least you be deceived: when poor people are alreadie deceived, for they are in their sins both Priests and people, and they who live in sin are deceived. And this is the cry of the chief Priests and in their high pla∣es, Beware and take heed of False Prophets and such like: but (Friends) let us try them, no longer take their words, but try
them by their Fruits: if the Tree be evil the Fruit cannot be good: and here by the Scriptures you may try them; proud man or a covetous man are no Ministers of Christ, I know them by their Fruity: The Devil is the King of Pride, and covetousnesse is Idolatrr: and these two sins are much reigning among the Clergy-men (the black Coats) though they may get the Scriptures (the good words) which is the Sheeps clothing, for Jesus Christ is compared to a Shepherd, and the Saints and followers of him were compared to Sheep which were innocent and harmlesse creatures.) Now I say that a proud man or an envious man or a covetous man, or such like, they may get the Scriptures (the Declaration) and be full of them, and painted over with the good words and so with good words, and fair speeches, through covetousnesse makes mer∣chandise of their souls; this is but still the Sheeps clothing, a fair outside, but see what is within; please them and they willl speak peace; but crosse them in any thing, they are full of envie and rage & persecution; so here by their fruits they are known. A proud man, or a Drunkard, or a man that is a striker and gi∣ven to Wines, or an envious man, these and such like are marks of the false Prophets, though they may speak the good words, yet not being spoken from the pure life they do not profit the people, but are deceivers, having a form of Godlinesse, but wants the power, and so leads poor people captive, laden with sin, and led away with divers lusts, ever learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth: For (do but consider) can a proud man lead out of pride? Can a proud Priest with his Rings and his Ribans, and gaudie attire, can he lead out of Pride? he may speak against Pride, but speaking a∣gainst Pride and living in it, he is an hypocrite, and his preach∣ing is in vain. Or can a covetous man lead out of covetousnesse? or an envious man out of envie? or a drunken Priest can he lead from drunkennesse? or any other what ever they be that speak against any sin, and they themselves, be guilty of those sins? they do but condemn themselves, and all their Religion is vain, and their Faith is vain, for if they had stood in the cour∣sel of the Lord, they should have turned many from the evil of their ways,: but they run, and the Lord never sent them, and
therefore they shall not profit the people at all. But it may be some may say, Though they may be proud men, and covetous men (and such like) yet they are good men in the Pulpit, and speaks many good truths; and we are to do as they say, and not as they do: And this they speak, because Christ spoke such words concerning the Scribes and Pharisees, where he saith, Do as they say, but not as they do, for they say and do not. But here you must consider, that the Scribes and Pharisees had the commands of God, and the Law of God, which were to be observed and kept, for Christ came not to break the Law, but to fulfil the Law; but this was a time before Christ was sacrificed up; but when he was sacrificed up, and risen, those who prea∣ched Christ did not go to hear the Scribes and Pharises, neither were they to do as they said; but they declared against those things which the Pharisees upheld, which were but shadows, & preached Christ the substance, as the Scripture witnesseth: And Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in his Epistle 2 Tim. 3. chap. marks out the false Prophets so plain, that even he that runs may read; and he doth not exhort the people to follow or hear such, but turn from such as had the form but not the power. And so all people I do exhort you, as you tender the glory of God and the good of your own souls, to turn from all the Priests and the false Prophets of what sort, soever who have not the power of God, who say and do not, for they can never profit you at all; for it is not every one that faith Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven. Therefore weigh all things well, and try them, and by their fruit ye shall know them.
The Day of the Lord is coming upon all the ungodly, which shall burn and con∣sume the wicked as Fire consumes the Stubble. THe Lord God is risen in Power, and is making a separation between the precious and the vile, gathering the Wheat into the Garner, and will burn up the Chaff with unquencha∣ble Fire: The day is at hand, it hasteth greatly, a day of black∣nesse and darknesse, a day of weeping and bitter lamentation to all the Adversaries of God; a day that shall burn like an O∣ven, and all the proud and all that do wickedly shall be as Stub∣ble, and shall be consumed root and branch. Look upon the Stubble all you that live in your sins, there is your Figure. Look upon an Oven when it burns, there you may read your figure, the wicked shall be as stuble, and shall be consumed in the day of the Lords fierce indignation, which is kindled alreadie, and none shall be able to quench it. The sharp two edged Sword of the Almighty is drawn forth, it is furbushed ready for the slaughter; and wo to the wicked and ungodly who cast the Law of God behinde their backs and turns his Grace into wanton∣nesse, it will go ill with them, and they cannot hide themselves from the Wrath of the Lamb. Drunkard, thou canst not hide thy self, the Lord will finde thee out, and give thee thy portion in the Lake. Swearers, Ly∣ers Scoffers and Scorners, you cannot hide your selves, you are the Ungodly that turns the Grace of God into wantonnesse, and into condemnation you must come who hate the Light (that shews you sin and your evil deeds) and loves the dark∣nesse better then the Light; the Light is your condemnation. And all you that live in pride and vain glory (sporting your selves in the day time, nourishing your hearts as in a day of Slaughter) the Devil is your Father who hath begotten you in∣to
his image and likenesse; ye murder and kill the Just, and cru∣cifie Christ afresh; and wo is your portion, wo to the Crown of Pride, for the Devil is the King of Pride: And all you covetous cruel oppressors, who are heaping together the earthly treasures, who grinde the faces of the poor, weep and howle for the misery that shall come upon you; your riches are corrupted, your Gold and Silver is cankered, & the rust of them shall be a witness against you. Wo to you that live in envy and wrath, you are of Cains Generation and na∣ture who murdered his Brother, and all your Prayers and Sacrifi∣ces are abomination, and stinks in the nostrils of God. And all you that revie, scoff and scorn, backbite, slander, and falsly accuse the innocent and harmlesse Lambs of Christ, tearing and rending, hail∣ing them out of your Synagogues, and so to Prison, you manifest your selves to be the wolves that devour and make a prey of the Lambs; you are the fruitlesse Trees that cumber the ground, and must be hewn down and cast into the fire: The glory of the Lord is shining, and the day of the Lord is dawned, and the day∣star is risen in the hearts of the Lords people, and you are disco∣vered and made manifest, and seen to be the wolves, and the Scrip∣ture is fulfilled upon you which Christ spoke forth, Behold, I send you forth as Lambs in the midst of wolves; is not this so now? See what hailing and imprisoning and cruel usage is in this Nati∣on of England, of a poor despised harmless people, hailing them to Courts & Sessions for no other cause but for declaring of the truth, & witnessing against the deceit in Professors, Magistrates, Priests and people, and for this are the innocent hated and reviled, and suffer bonds and imprisonment, and some have been given up to death; and all this endured with patience, not seeking for revenge, but do follow our Lord and Master Christ, wo endured the con∣tradiction of sinners; and we finde his words to be trne, where he saith, Ye shall be hated of all mn for my names sake: but rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great shall be your reward, for if ye were of the world the world would love you; but because I have cho∣sen you out of the world, therefore doth the world hate you; but wo to the world and all wicked malicious persecuting spirits, better a Milstone had been hanged abou their necks, and they cast into the midst of the Sea, then to offend one of the little ones of Christ Haste, repent and amerd, least sudden destruction come upon you.
The wages of Sin is death, but the gift of God is life and peace. ALl you that live in sin and wickedness, as Envy Wrath, Malice, Pride, Lust, covetousness, Drun∣kenness, Swearing, Lying, Slandering, Backbiting, false Accusing, Scoffing and Scorning, Revilings, Re∣proachings, Mocking and Jeering, Oppression, Cruel∣ty, Tyranny, Murders, Theft, Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanness, Lasciviousness, Idolatry, Witcheraft, Variance, Emulation, Seditions, Heresies, Anger, Per∣verseness, Frowardness, Impatience and Unbelief, Co∣zening and Cheating, and defrauding one another in buying and selling, using false weights and measures, inventers of evil things, plotting mischief upon your beds, Covenant-breakers, without natural affection; implacable, unmercisul, living in vain sports and Plea∣sures, spending the good creatures of God, and devou∣ring the Creation upon your lusts, sporting your selves in the day time, foolish-jesting, idle and filthy communication, and laughter, which is madness: These (and such like) are works of the flesh, and they that act such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God; for which things sake comes the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience; and the curse of God re∣mains upon such who live in the flesh, fulfilling the lusts and desires of it, such cannot stand before the righteous God, neither can they enter into his righte∣ous Kingdome, but must be cast into utter darknesse, which is the portion of all the wicked; for to the wick∣ed
there is no peace, but wo and terror shall pursue them; upon the wicked, God will rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible Tempest, this shall be the portion of their cup from the just God, who is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity. Therefore all you workers of iniquity, fear and trem∣ble before the Lord, and deceive not your selves with a vain hope; search these Scriptures, and see your porti∣on, 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. Col. 3.5, 6. Ps. 9.17. Ps. 11.6. Mat. 7.23. and 25.30, 41. Rom. 1,29, 30, 31, 32. Rev. 21.8. and 22.15. read these Scriptures with seriousness, and then (with the light of Christ in your consciences) try and examine your selves whether you be acting and living in these sins above-mentioned, or any of them; and if upon search you be found guilty, then what will you plead or answer the Lord? or what promise is there due unto you as long as you live in sin? truly none, but all the curses, plagues and woes that are mentioned in the Scriptures, is your due and portion for your sin and disobedience, and all your applying of the Promises, and saying Christ dyed for you, and say you believe in Christ; yet all this will not avail nor speak peace to your souls (as long as you live in sin) but the witness of God in your own consciences will testifie against you, and be your condemnation; and your faith is vain who are yet in your sins. Therefore re∣pent and turn from your wickedness, cease to do evil and learn to do well, draw near unto God and he will draw near unto you; put away lying and swearing and all prophaneness, let no corrupt speeches proceed out of your mouthes; and hearken to the voice of Christ that your souls may live; spend not your money
for that which is not bread, nor your labor for that which doth not satisfie. But hearken with diligence to hear the voice of the beloved Son of God, who saith, Learn of me, I am meek and lowly in Spirit, and you shall finde rest to your souls; and that is it in you all which reproves for sin, and checks you when you do amiss, when no mortal eye sees you; minde this well, and wait to be guided by it, and it will lead you out of sin and evil up to God the Father, to have Unity with him and with his Son, and so to bring forth fruits of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, gentleness, meek∣ness, soberness, brotherly kindness, forbearing and forgiving one another: And this will be a present guid unto you (if you love it and bring your deeds to it to be tryed by it) at all times and in all companies to lead you to God; if sinners entice you, consent not to them, but fear the Lord and stand in awe and sin not: But if you hate this Light and live in your sins, and your old vain ungodly conversation, this Light will be your con∣demnation. Now while you have time prize it, and work while it is day, lest the dreadful night of darkness come upon you when none can work: Awake, awake, and arise from the dead, prepare your selves and make ready, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.
Come out of Babylon, partake not of her sins, lest ye partake of her plagues, and wait upon the Lord, that you may eat of the Bread of Life, which satisfies the Soul. ALl you that are breathing after God, who are Hungring and Thirsting after righteousness, which have long been wandring upon the mountains, as sheep without a shepherd; who have long been seeking after God, but have not sound him, and have many years been hearers and learners, and have spent much money and labor, and much precious time, but have sound no satisfaction nor refreshment to your hungry thirsting souls, but still there is a cry within for want of a Savior; something in your con∣sciences cries and is not satisfied; notwithstanding your many years professing and talking of God and Christ, and your running after this man and that man to hear Sermons (as they are called) yet still you are in your sins; and your own old vain ungodly conver∣sation, and crooked and perverse rebellious and disobe∣dient nature, upon which the wrath of God abides; and so there is no true peace, joy nor rest to your souls: I say unto all such simple hearts (who have been tossed to and fro many years with the windy doctrines of men, but have not found peace) return home to your Fathers house, seed no longer amongst the swine up∣on
the husks; you cannot fill your belly there, but come into my Fathers house, for there is bread enough: Seek not the living among the dead, but awake, awake all you that sleep, and arise from the dead, that Christ may give you light; turn your mindes inward, and seek the last groat in your own house, for the Lord is near; yea doubtless (Friends) the Lord is very nigh, for in him we live, and move, and have our being: For it is he that gives to all life and breath, and all things; and out of his love to fallen man-kinde, hath given his onely begotten Son for a Covenant of Light into the World, who doth enlighten every one that cometh into the World, that all men through him might be∣lieve: There is that light in every one of your con∣sciences, which if you love it, will teach you continu∣ally, and lead you out of sin and unrighteousness, into purity and holiness, to worship the living God in spirit and in truth, and so to be taught of him in spirit accord∣ing to his promise; I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and my sons and my daughters shall Prophesie; and I will make a new Covenant with them, I will write my law in their hearts, and put my spirit into their in∣to their inward parts; and they shall no more teach every one his Neighbor and Brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all shall know me from the least to the great∣est; and I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember o more; and this is the Lord fulfilling in our day, praises to his Name for evermore; he is gathering his scattered sheep together, where they have been scat cred abroad in this cloudy dark day, and is bringing them into the Fold, and there shall be one Sheepsold and one Shep∣heard?
this is the promise of the Father which he is now bringing to pass, establishing his own Kingdom in Righteousness, and uniting and joyning his people together, that they may all be of one heart and mind, that they may with one voice and one consent glo∣rifie and praise him in the Covenant of his Son, which he is now leading his people into, where no sin enters, but is all shut out of the Kingdom and Covenant of the righteous God. Therefore all people every where prize this precious time which the Lord doth give unto you, and trifle it not away in vanity and vain delights, but hearken to that which is pure, which convinces and reproves for sin in your consciences, and makes manifest the evil of your hearts, that is, The pure light of Christ, which did never consent unto sin, but stood against you, witnessing for God against sin, though never so secretly committed. This is the eye which a long time hath been vailed and blinded by the God of the World, but now is the Lord unvailing, and uncovering, and stripping of all the stollen garments, which the Serpent hath painted and decked himself withal, and the Devil can no longer hide himself, but by the light of Jesus Christ shining in the conscience, he is found out in all his Wiles and Temptations, whereby he goes about to ensnare and deceive the innocent: For as long as the Devil can keep peo∣ple from owning this light, he can lodge in the heart, and work his works in the heart; but when ever they come to own, and walk in the light, he cannot work, but by the light his works is seen; and by the
power and life of Christ within, the Devils works are destroyed, and the heart purifyed, and the con∣science purged from dead works, and so the body is made a Temple of God, which Temple is holy; and if any man defile the Temple of God, him shall God destroy. Therefore all people who love your souls, come out of your sins (which doth defile you and sepa∣rate you from God, and breaks your peace with God (and love and walk in the light of Christ, and bring your deeds to it: For every one that doth truth he loves the light, and bringeth his deeds to the light, that they may be proved and tryed whether or no they be wrought in God; and in the light you will have union and fellow∣ship one with another, and the Blood of Christ will cleanse you from all sin (walking in the light) for this light is pure and but one, and leads to purity and oneness, out of all Divisions, Strife and Contention; and from all the changeable Priests and changeable Doctrines, and changeable Worships, and changeable Laws, that stands in the will of Man in the fallen Wisdom, and will lead you unto Jesus Christ the unchangeable Priest, the alone Teacher of his People, who teacheth all his freely by his free spirit, and leads them out of Death and dead Works, into the pure way and path of life, that they may bring forth fruit unto God; and blessed are all they that fear the Lord and walk in his way: But the wicked must be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that for∣get
God, therefore let every one that nameth the Name of JESUS CHRIST, depart from ini∣quity. From a lover of your Souls, but a witness against all Sin. A. P. THE END.
