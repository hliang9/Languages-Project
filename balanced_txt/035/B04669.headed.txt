THE PENITENT SINNER Behold, O God, in Rivers of my tears I come to thee, bow down thy blessed ears To bear me wretch, and let my eyes that sleep, Yet never close, behold a sinner weep. Let not O God my God my faults though great And my poor soul bet vv een thy Mercies Seat. Lord remember hy If thou be I co me not Lord wit h any o the r merit, Then wh at I in my S a viour Ch rist inherit: Be th en his wound s my birth his ri se my bliss, My Crown his th orns, my dea t h be lo st in his: And th ou my bles t Redeemer, Sa viour, God, Quit my ac co unt, with h old thy ve ngeance rod, O beg for me my h o pes on t hee are set, And Chri st forgi v e, and willing, pay t h e debt. The linn in towel I f thou wear, O y ee I know, O but to thee, O whether s hould I go? All o t her helps a r e vain e grant then to me I am t hy cross, thy s aving hea l th must be: O hear k en then wh a t I by F aith implore, Lest S in and death sin k me for ever Â  more, Lastly, O G od, my way e s direct a nd guide, In d eath defe n d me that I n ever slide: And at the d om e let me be raise d then To liv e with the e sweet Jes us Christ, Amen.
