❧ By the King. ❧ A Proclamation giuing a further time for the amendment of defectiue Titles. THE Kings most Excellent Maiestie, continu∣ing still his Royall intention, to extend his grace to such of his louing Subiects as shall seeke the same, for confirmation of such Graunts, as haue bene passed to any of them, or their Ancestours from the Crowne, by which his Princely fauour, they and their posterity may be secured from the manifold dangers in which they stand, if by variety of time his Maiesties Title to their possessions should be set on foot, and pressed to their ouerthrow in succeeding ages: And hauing for that purpose lately published his Proclamation touching defectiue Titles, with a limitation of a day prefixed, which is now vpon the point to be expired, Doeth well perceiue by report of great numbers that doe craue the benefit thereof (which cannot conueniently be dispatched) that it was not any generall neglect of his Maiesties grace and fauour, that cau∣sed this late comming, but meerly the accident of time in most men, whereof the greatest part passed on in the long Vacation, during which space, the Commissioners did not sit, nor the Counsell learned remayned in Towne, and the chiefest time, whereupon most men did rest their expectation (which was after Michaelmas) was likewise by the doubtfulnesse & short∣nesse of the Terme much disappointed: His Maiestie is therefore pleased, for these and such like considerations, (by the aduise of his Priuy Counsell) to giue once more, a prolongation of the same vntill the sixt of February next ensuing, to the intent that all such as haue any desire to receiue this grace, may enioy the benefit of Confirmation of his Maiesties Grants of that nature by this Parliament, which is so immediatly to follow, as that oportunitie would not be neglected, which happeneth not but vpon other extraordinary and vrgent occasions. Giuen at Newmarket the last day of Nouember, in the seuenth yeere of our Reigne of Great Britaine, France and Ireland. God saue the King. ¶ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. ANNO 1609.
