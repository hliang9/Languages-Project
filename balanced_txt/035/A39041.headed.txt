THE EXECUTION OF Ed. Fitz-Harris, And OLIVER PLUNKET, Who was conveyed one from the Tower and the other from Newgate on the 1st of July. TO TYBURN Upon a SLEDG. And there Hang'd and Quartered for High-Treason. In Con∣spiring the Death of his most Sacred Majesty, to subvert the Government, by endeavouring to raise Rebellion, and to introduce an Army to establish Popery and Arbitrary Pow∣er, and destroy the Protestants. With the manner of his Be∣haviour in the Tower, and at the place of Execution. IT is seldome known, but one time or other, Justice meets with those men, who as it were sell themselves to do Mischief even when they think they are most secure, then their black Designs and hel∣lish practices are brought to Light, for what height or depth can abscond from the allseeing Eye; Darkness and Light to him are equal, and nothing can be done without his sufferance but these things. It is to be supposed, men that ventures upon all Treasonable and Villa∣nous Designs, as to depopulate Kingdoms, by horrid Massacres, to raise Rebellion, and set the Nations in a Flame, do not consider, or if they do, as the Prophet says, They put far away the evil day, and hope at last to escape due punishment, but most commonly are deceived, as here we shall instance in Edward Fitz-Harris, the son (as he saith) of Sir Edward Fitz-Harris, born in the Kingdom of Ireland, and there brought up in the Burnish Religion, so consequently the better quallified for such dia∣bolick practises and treasonable Designs, for which he is now justly brought to suffer death.
The sum of his most detestable Crime is, that he un∣dertaking to perfect what the bloudy Jesuites and the rest of the Popish-Locust had begun, came about the 21 of Eeb. last to the Chamber of Mr. Everard, one of the Discoverers and there began to tamper with him; first to try how he stood affected, and the more to iusinuate into his good Opinion of him, he began to comiserate his hard usage since he espoused the Protestant Interest, saying he lived far better in the French Kings Service, and if he would again come over to the Papists he should yet have not only a large reward, but also a yearly Pension. Then falling from that, enquired if he did not write a Paper, pretended to be an Answer to his Majesties most Gracious Declaration, the which as he said, he was informed he did, but Mr. Everard utterly denying it, he fell from that likewise, and debated about giving Birth to so notorious and Treasonable a Libel, that the like has not been known in any Age, Intituled The True English-mans speaking true English. In which he endeavoured not only to render the King odious to his Supjects, but likewilse to fix a notorious and false scandal upon his Royal Grandfather, and Father of ever Blessed Memory, of their designing during their Reigns to establish Popery and Arbitrary power: to lay a Blot on his Majesties Royal Posterity, to raise Rebellion and set the Nation in a Blaze, by stirring all sorts and conditions of people, unanimously to Rise and destroy each other, under prerence of securing their Liberties and properties, and whilst this was doing, as the end and scope of all, A French Army was to Land, and overflow us like a Deluge wasting with Fire and Sword, whilst they left not a Protestant remaining in the Land, then Popery was to be introduced, and established. This was the purport of his Hellish Design, and this he got Mr. Everard to put into a form for him, telling him for so doing, he should have 40 Guinies and that the French Embassadors Confessor was to manage the Affair, and that Mr, Everard should have some thousands of Crowns for his Service, and become a Pentioner to the French King. And that several hunderds of those dangerous Libels were to be Coppied out, and put into the Pockets of such Lords and Commons which were most adverse to their party and then to have Ruffians at hand to apprehend and swear against them This was no doubt the second part of Dangerfields Plot, and would have proved more satal, had it taken Effect;
For it was to have been managed under the name of the Noncon-formist, but as God would have it, Mr. Everard was more honest and tender-Conscienced, than to be any ways Instrumental in bringing so cruel a destruction upon his Native Country, and thereupon discovered the designe to several worthy Gentlemen, but in fine to Sir Walliam Waller, and Mr. Smith, one of the Discoverers, who at an appointed time came (but not both at once) and being placed by Mr. Everard so that they both see and hear what passed in the next Room, they were at several times Eve and Ear-witnesses to the Traytors Intentions, who little (at those times) dreamed that his Villany was so near detection, for these worth Gentlemen after sometime given to make the Discovery, that it might appear more plain to the World, caused him to be apprehended, who after some short Examination, (the Treason being made plain against him) was committed to Newgate, and then to the Tower, but in little time the Parliament sitting at Oxford, the House of Commons receiving his Examina∣tion thought fit to impeach him of High Treason, whereupon being brought to the Kings Bench Bar, in Order to his Tryal he pleaded to the Jurisdiction of the Court, but his Plea after long debate being over ruled he was on the 9th of June last brought from the Tower, and there received his Tryal, where the forementioned, and many more horrid Treasons were proved against him. So that after a short Debate, the Jury brought him in Guilty of High-treason, and on the 15th following, he with Oliver Plunket; Titular, Primate of Ireland, received Sentance of Death, which was to be conveyed to the places from whence they came, and from thence to the common place of Execu∣tion, there to hang'd by the Neck, and then cut down alive his Privy members to be cut off, his Bowels to be taken out and burnt before his Face, his Head to be severed form his Body, his four quarters to be divided, and to be disposed of as his Majesty shall think fit, after this dreadfull, but just Sentance, had passed upon him, he began to look sad, as altogether dispairing to optain Mercy from his Soveraign, whom he had so infinitely offended, then being conveyed to the Tower during the Respit, he behaveed himself as a Man sensible of his great and grievous Crimes, no doubt reflecting on what a Deluge of innocent Blood his wicked parctices were within few days to have shed if they had taken effect.
And shewing much seeming sorrow, that he had as he faith, by the ve∣ry Principles of his Religion, been perswaded to offend so good a King. During the respit in the Tower several worthy persons were to visit him, among which, were some Protestant Ministers, who gave him the best consolation they could, as to his eternal welfare, adjuring him that he would not in any wise add Guilt to Guilt, in accusing falsly any person, but that he would humble himself, and seek a pardon from God for his many great and grievous Crimes, and especially for those which had brought him under the hand of justice, for which, he was to suffer, and to render thanks to God that he had prevented him, in being instrumen∣tal to the shedding of so much innocent blood, as was intended, to which he answered, he had been a perverse Liver, and that by reason of his wicked Life, he concluded God had given him up to hearken to the evil Counsels of such men as had taught him to cast off all allegiance and duty to his Soveraign, and all pitty and compassion to his fellow Subjects, and though he could hope for no mercy from a Prince he had so infinitely abus'd, yet he hoped that God would at last take pitty on his Soul, desiring forgiveness of all he had offended, as he freely forgave all that had been the occasion of drawing him into the Crimes for which he suffered. The next Capital Traytor (whose wicked Designs had they taken ef∣fect, had inevitably ruined the Kingdom of Ireland, by reducing it to a far worse condition then when the bloody Papists triumphed over the Mas∣sacred Protestants) viz. Oliver Plunket whom the Pope had created Arch-Bishop of Dublin, as it is thought for no other end, then to carry on his Hellish Designs of Murther and subversion, for having the Popes Com∣mission, he was owned as head of the Conspirators, and endeavoured to bring in and establish Popery and Arbytrary power, in order to which, having levied vast sums of money, Treated with the French about Land∣ing an Army of 70000 men to joyn with such Papists as should be in rea∣diness, and to deliver up Carligan, and some other Seaport-Towns, for their more convenient landing, but e're these Traiterous Designs could take Birth, they were discovered by some of those Priests that he had intrusted with the hellish secret. For which being apprehended in Ire∣land, was brought over and tryed at the Kings-bench-Bar, where, upon full Testimony against him, he was cast and condemned, after which he was remanded to Newgate, when his Friends came to visit him, many perswaded him not to be daunted, but to continue obstinate in his own vindication, but notwithstanding, when he came to the place of Execution, he was very much dejected, and 'tis thought would have made some Confession, had he not seen so many weeping Catholicks pre∣sent. So after some private ejaculations to himself, the Executioner did his Office. LONDON, Printed by D. Mallet.
