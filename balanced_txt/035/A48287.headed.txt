A BRIEF CHARACTER OF ENGLANDS Destractions. SIR, HAppily amidst these our late Distractions here at London, you may expect some other News, either from hence or from abroad, which in all the, intercourses be∣tween us, you know I have evermore avoided, and left that to Diurnals, and such as delight to tell of Novelties; On∣ly to that, which is I presume long since known to you and all the three Nations; I send you this as it is, the grounds of the present, and late differences, between the Army Officers, and remnant of the old Legal Parliament; for so I stile it, in respect, that it was summoned by the late King. As to all the other Assembles, or rathe Conventickles, they both came together, and sate to little other purpose, than to as∣sume to themselves the name of a Parliament, without the Essence, Summons, and due form of our Antient geat Councels; The relicts of the long Parliament being fist put down by the Army, and of late sat up, and again shlerd by the power of the Sword: and likewise the Protector divested of his power, as a Partener, with the Parliament in the late estblished Government, upon this Reason and Ground, that the Grandees would nor admit of any single Person; as also, for that the Parliament as 'tis alleaged, acted irregularly, and not according to the humor of the Souldier. This is generally conceived to be the
ground of the present Destractions; in the mean time, judge you, where we are (the Legislative power being laid a side) and the Nation left without any Government, but that of the Sword. 'Tis true, it is in common discourse, that there is a Government in∣forming, but what that is, or will be, God knows; you know Kings, single Persons, Peers, and Parliaments, are not now in rerum natura, neither any Settlement in any of the Courts of Judicature, that may rightly, and legally, determine meum et tuum. Some there are, that say the Grandees will pitch on that frame, which hath been so happily established by the Hollanders; and in∣deed their case, and ours,  of so near a Kin, in discarding Kings and single Persons, that I confesse it may invite our great Masters to follow their pattern. Others there are, that propose a Government answerable to that of the Romans, on their putting down Tarquinius Superbus their last King, when as the Senate assumed the sole power of, Government to themselves, as the best and most dable, though this soft look not back to those interruptions which often befel them by the Tribunes of the people, their Censors, Dictators, and at last, that of their Armies, in the election of their Emperors without either the consent, or approbation of the Senate, to speak in tearms of truth, our case and theirs, are much alike. Others there are, that propose the Venetian Government, were their Duke as a single Person, rules no otherwise, than as their Grand Councel shall admit and approve. But the Major part of the people, are for Charls Stuarts Inte∣rest, hoping that these our Destractions, conduce to th bringing him in, though the wiser sort, would have him ty'd up to such con∣ditions that happily will neither become the propounders, or his acceptance, This sort not foreseeing the future, and that in case he comes in, otherwise it must necessarily be by the Swords of Stran∣gers, and a party here at home, then 'tis most perspicuous, that he wll come in with a revengeful heart, and then no man can ex∣pect from him other measure, than a reseisure of all the Crown Lands, the Royal Houses, with their rich Ornaments, the Rega∣li, and what not? that may right him, as well for the Crown Lands, a his Fathers Blood. Woe than to such purchasors, as have nriched themselves, by buying the Crown Lands at under rates; neither must such, as have not been guilty of getting those good bargains, beleive to escape scot-free, for all mens Estates, will be then liable to his conquering Sword, neither will this be the worst of such a turn of fortune for our Religion, Laws, and immuni∣ties, of every free born Subject, must vayl the Bonnet to that pre∣vailing power. All this is too plain and manifest, which necessarily will befall
the Universal Nation, wherein not only the Nocent but the Inno∣cent will be in a like condition. Now Sir, there's another sort, that say, we are too much English, in relation to the old Proverb (which you know) is, that an En∣glish man knows not when he is well, and that there was a Government set up by old Oliver, between him and a Parliament, as also that during his time they lived in peace and quietness, as also that the Laws and Justice had a free and o∣pen current, and many tedious sutes ended by his means by way of reference, and that he kept a Court, answerable to the State and ho∣nour of the English Nation, entertained all Ambassadours of forein Princes and Stares, with his Guards of Horse and Foot, with his Con∣troller, Stewards, Master of Requests, and Master of the Ceremo∣nies, and that he was courted and admired by most of the Princes and States of Europe; whereas now there is no Person, no place, where∣unto any Addresses are to be made from abroad, to the dishonour and scorn of the Nation; They farther say, and allege our blessed Savi∣ours. Oracles, ut emntem feceris ita ut metes, for that the same person was after his death vilified, and his Son shamefully disgraced, and set at nought, by those which the Souldiers so lately hath put down in re∣tribucion of the ingratitude shewed to him, whom the whole Nation knows was the prime instrument of reducing the three Nations to peace, and quietness, and that in a trise to the wonder of the world. The premises rightly considered, where are we now? otherwise than as Slaves of a new edition; But seting aside this our sad conditi∣on as it relates to our temporal estates, let us alittle look back to that of our spiritual condition, and the obliquies of the Church, where instead of Reformation, (of which God knows there was need enough, at the sitting down of the long Parliament) too many learned and Orthodox Ministers have been put out of their Livings, and me∣chanick, ignorant, and illiterate Sectaries prefer'd, and many Con∣gregations and Parishes both in Englnd and Wales, left without any pious or able Minister, either to read, pray, or preach, as it be∣comes one, that hath Cura animrum; Sectaries, and Scicks bearing the sway, and trampling on the Orthodox and true Potestant Reli∣gion, without any Reformation. Again, if we look back to our Na∣tional Laws, (as the case stands) who now shall eithr make new ones, or abolish old and useless ones, since Parliaments are set at nought and laid afide; Nay, where is now hat Authority that may Le∣gally Summon them, of enable the Mmbers to sit longer than the Souldier will suffer them. Hence you may behold the sad Condition wherein the Nati∣on stands, withut any due reformation in the Church, with∣out Laws, Government, Setlemnt, or Security, in any thing we have formerly enjoy'd; 'Tis consest the Nation can∣not
be secured (as the case stands) without our Armies both by Sea and Land, either from Invasions from abroad, or Insurrections at hme; but if our Armies shall or will be the first that will invade us, and assume to themselves, the Sole and absolute power of Government, doubtlesse then we are in a remedi∣lesse Condition, whn our Servants shall become our Masters. On the other side, in case our Parliaments, shall act alone and do what thy please, without any controule, then we are in the same Condition, as if the Army ruled alone without any other Partnership e Government. Me thinks our Gan Mstes of either side, should both of them have bethought themselves of sm one Mdium or other, rather than either of them, should assume to themselves the sole, and supreme pow∣er of Government; for that, wheresoever Soveraignty, or any other power of Government, shall act alone, and without any Partnership; it instantly turns into Tyrann: On this consideration, let them both lay this to heart, that when either Parliaments; or our wrongs shall assume to ct alone the natures of necessitie, will become Slaves, or no bet∣ter han so many Asses, assigned to bear the burthen, of that single and unruly power: for 'tis without dipute, that the most lasting, and best Government, is, and must be of a mixt nature or constitution; Its Bel∣larmins opinion, de Roman Pontfic, who after he had so much mignifi∣ed, absolute Monarchy; yet at last concludes Attamen, Monarchiam, mixtam, et temporatam, inter Aristcraciam, et Democraciam, semper me∣liorem esse puto; You may remember that the Lacedemonian Kings had their Ephori, that contrould them whensoever they took upon them, Transire and to go beyond the bounds of Lawfull Soveraignty. It was the grand Court of Aragon, (supprest by Ferdinand,) that kept their Kings for many hundred years from Tyranny, and the Natives from Slavery. To come nearer to the poynt, I do not conceive that either the late Protectors, Oliver and Richard as single persons, were absolute, for they had a Parliament, and in the intermissions of Parliaments, an able Councel of State, that carried on the affairs of the Common-wealth as joynt Copartners with them: If it be abjected that Oliver was the first, that dissolved the long Parliament, the answer to this, is soon made, for that they began to call into question the new Gover∣ment, under which the universall Natives, lived in peace, and securi∣ty, without any disturbance, which to preserve, the Protector, per∣ceiving the Ends, and Aims, dissolved them. You may remember how the late King made it his common practice to call Parliaments and Dissolve them, without their due Effects, at will and pleasure: Is it therefore of necessity; that some few of the Army Officers
should do the like as they have often done, and destroy the most Es∣sentiall part of the old English Government, the old security of all the free born Subjects, of this Nation, and that Court which in all Ages hath stopt the currant of the Incroachment of the Royal Prero∣gative, and prevented that Inundation which would have swallowed up all the Subjects, Freedoms and Liberties; But the report goes that they will resolve to call a Parliament speedily, if that be their resolution, In Gods name then let it be a Free and Legal one, an the Election of the Members left to the Free-holders and not too much tyed up to the rack of their wills and pleasures, otherwise, where will they be found that will sit, when they shall be chosen? since 'tis already in common discourse, and the question put, why should any either accept the Election, or sit, when as the Souldier at his will and pleasure shall send them home as wise as they came to the House? SIR, To conclude, without doubt there is somewhat if not much amisse, in the mannagery of this work of darknesse, (for so I call it) not pleasing to Almighty God; 'Tis most true, that all along our many sad and often changes, we have had frequent Fast∣ings, Prayers, and Preachings, but whither they have been rightly addrest, rests the doubt, the Apostle St. Jmes tels us we pray and ask but receive not, because we petition amiss, I fear me this is our case, and therefore let us all more fervently pray unto Almighty God, and heartily beseach him, that our Prayers and addresses may be more pleasing to him, who a∣lone must help and free us from these our Devisions, otherwise we are all lost; It is Unity and Concord, that must set us all aright, and in our right Wits. If a Kingdom, City, or House devided cannot stand, needs must our devisions ruine us, Con∣cordia res parvae crescunt, discordia dilabuntur. Therefore let our great Masters lay aside their Ambition and Self-ends, then by Gods good grace, the cure of these our sad distractions will be soon perfected; Therefore it behoves us all to pray unto God, that Unity and Concord may be preserved amongst us, for without it, the Nation cannot be in safety, since as now the case stands, we are all in the highway of Confusion, and never more subject and open to forraign Invasions, then at present; we wish that they which now sit at the Healm, will bethink them∣selves, and take it into their serious and timely consideration, that the new Amity and Friendship contracted between the two great∣est and neighbouring Princes of Christendome, presageth no good Omen to England; and that they will call to mimd the late passa∣ges and causes at Paris; as also to bethink themselves, that all things are not so safe at home as it should be, and might be remota causa tollitur effectus, then the cure will (by Gods good grace) be
soon perfected; but as now affairs are carried off, we can expect no other rate to befall us, than dissolation; The Armies divided a∣mongst themselves; the Ci and the Armies divided, and in Com∣bustion; no due settlement either in the Church or State, and the Courts of Indicature, but all in confusion; Sectaries and Scma∣ticks, suffered to discard the Peace of the Church nd State by the Pl of Jesuits; without any care of redresse. Th Sir, yu may see in what a d condition wee all stand, Gd in his great mercy look upon us, and give us all the grace of a true and hearty repentance, and avert those heavy Iudgements, which now threaten this sinfull Nation with utter Ruine and Defolation. Your very Loving And Constant Friend Tho. Le. Wh. From the Middle Tem∣ple this 15. of De∣cember, 1659. FINIS.
