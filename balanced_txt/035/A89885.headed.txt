The manifold PRACTISES And Attempts of the Hamiltons, And particularly of the present Duke of Hamilton Now Generall of the Scottish Army To get the Crown of SCOTLAND. Discovered in an intercepted LETTER WRITTEN From a Malignant here in London to his friend in SCOTLAND. The Letter is directed thus on the back, For the much Honoured, 21. 53. 7. 10. 19. 72. 67. 40. Printed at LONDON, in the year 1648.
The Practises and Attempts of the Hamiltons, particularly of Duke Hamilton now Generall of the Scot∣tish Army. SIR, THe newes of suppressing those Covenan∣ters, which were the first movers, and chief Authors of all our troubles these ten yeers past, the taking of Barwick and Carlisle, the forward proceedings of your Parliament, and the readinesse of an Army to advance into England for the Kings service, give great encouragement to all our friends here; But the report of Duke Hamiltons being made Generall, is like water to our wine, and afflicts us with fears. It is a wonder how the Kings friends have been induced to consent unto it, or what necessity could drive them to make use of so des∣perate a remedy, which for my own part I fear, wil prove a means to increase the disease, and (if God prevent not) fatall to the King and his posterity. For now the Hamil∣tons have not only the pen and the purse of Scotland, (the Dukes brother Lanerick being Secretary, and his brother in law, Treasurer) both which have great influence up∣on the Subject; But they have the sword setled in their hands by authority, and so whom favour will not draw
power will force to go along with their designes, for ob∣taining the Crown and Government of that Kingdome, which they have aimed at for one hundreth and twenty years and upward, as may be clearly instanced in many particulars, sufficiently known to all such as are acquaint∣ed with the State of affairs of Scotland in latter times. I shall briefly put you in minde of some, and leave the rest to your own observation. After the death of King Iames the fourth, Iohn Duke of Albany being chosen to governe the King in his mino∣rity. The Hamiltons made a conspiracy to thrust the Duke out of authority, and to take the custody of the King, and Governement of the Kingdome into their own hands, the better to accomplish their ends: In pur∣suance whereof they took the Castle of Glasgow, and made an Assembly of their faction. But the Duke of Al∣banies speedy comming with an Army, surprised them, dissolved that Assembly, and made the Earle of Arran, chiefe of that designe, to flee away. But here they rested not. For Sir Iames Hamilton, bastard sonne to the Earle of Arran, conspired the death of the King in his owne house at Holy-rude House; For which and other crimes after mentioned, divers years after, when the Plot was revealed, he was executed. When this failed, they used their endeavours that the King should not marry, that so he wanting issue, Hamilton might succeed to the Crown. They hindred the Kings meeting with his Vncle the King of England, who was willing to have married his only daughter to him, and made him King of England as well as Scotland after his death. The King going by sea to France, Sir Iames Hamilton
went with him to hinder his marriage; and the King being asleep in the ship, Sir Iames without any necessi∣ty from wind or weather, caused the mariners to turne saile from the West Coast of England, and to land in Galloway; which gave the King such cause of discontent, against Sir Iames, as he began to understand his unfaith∣full dealing, and at last he was executed for Treason. These practices discovered, made the King more ha∣sty to marry, that his succession might put the Hamil∣tons out of hope, and himselfe out of danger of their fur∣ther plots. The King dying, and leaving issue, only one daugh∣ter of six dayes old, The Hamiltons thought all their own; For they got the Earle of Arran to be named Governour by a private faction: But the Estates soone weary of his Government, discharged him of his of∣fice; wherefore his designe, to marry his sonne upon the Queen (whom he keeped rather like a prisoner, then a Princesse) was disappointed, though in the opinion of divers, it was once farre advanced; the Duke of Lenox and Earle of Angus, his principall opposer, one of them being by him banished, and the other imprisoned. After the Queen and her mother were rescued out of his hands, in hopes to gaine their favour, and so his ends he abjured his religion in Sterling, but without successe. When neither he could get the Queen out of the way, nor married as he desired, he consented to expose her to the stormes of the sea, and danger of enemies, and sold her to France, for which he was made Duke of Chastle∣rault. Having in manner thus sold their pretence to the Ti∣tle of the Crown, yet the Hamiltons were not quiet, but used many meanes, during the Queens being in
France, and after her return to get the Crown. In or∣der whereunto they conspired with the Earle of Bothu∣el, to kill the Earle of Murray, and when the Queen married to the house of Lennox, which to this day, they esteemed alwayes as their great enemy, they conspired with the Earle of Bothuel to murther the King, wherein particularly Bishop Hamilton Duke Hamilton of Chastle∣rault brother was very instrumentall. When the King was thus removed, and so the Crown brought a degree nearer to the house of Hamilton, it seemed to them ve∣ry probable (as it was indeed) that Bothuel should de∣stroy the young King, and not suffer him to live to re∣venge his fathers death, and prejudge the children of Bothuel with the Queen in the succession to the Crown, and if the King were destroyed, they hoped that the Queen and Bothuel would be so hatefull to the people, for the murther of her husband and her sonne, that they would have easie accesse to the Crown, or other∣wise then that they might kil Bothuel; in which case they were in hope the Queen should marry, John Hamilton the Dukes sonne, whom she entertained, often with merry looks and chearfull countenance. But the King being preserved and the Queen keeped in Loch-herm by command of the Parliament, the Hamiltons took ano∣ther course, which was to relieve the Queen, and em∣ploy all their power, to suppresse the King, and the no∣bilitie that adhered to him I might here make a large discourse of their base mur∣thering the Regent the Earle of Murray, their joyning in conspiracy with the Duke of Norfolk, and others in England against Queen Elizabeth, their pretending to have the Queen brought out of England, when they knew it was impossible, without the Queen of Eng∣lands
favour which they never sought but rejected, to the end they might in the meane time have the better opportunity, to follow out their designes against the King, and hinder him from being setled in the Go∣vernment (as now they pretend the rescuing of the King out of the Isle of Wight, and yet by their actions I am afraid shall render it impossible,) But I leave these and other remarkeable passages, that I may come near∣er our own times to speak of the designes of this Mar∣quesse, whom cunning policie and jugling carriage (se∣conded with the Craft and Courage of his brother La∣nerick) seemes to have fitted for such an enterprise, and who began very early to insist in the steps of his pre∣decessors, encouraged perhaps with that old Scotch Prophesie. When Kaidyow shall be King. Meikle woeshall be bring. His first Plot to get power into his hands was under pretext of that levie for Germanie about seventeene or eighteene yeeres agoe; whereof that you may have a true narration, I shall give you the chief heads of the depositions of the Lord Reay, Lord Ochilcree and others, as their examinations were taken by the Lord Coventry then keeper of this kingdome; treasurer VVeston, the Earles of Morton and Carlisle, by the Kings directi∣on. In anno 1630 three or foure considerable persons of the name of Hamilton of neere relation to the Mar∣quesse of Hamilton, not having served the King of Sweden one yeere, cashiered themselves from service, without any known cause to such as were their fellow
souldiers; the Lord Reay being in Stockholme at the same time, was informed by his Lievtenant Colonel, one Lindsey, who lodged in the same house with Sir James Hamilton that the reason was, their chiefe the Marquesse of Hamilton intended to be a souldier, and they resolved to take a share of his fortune whatsoever it should be, and that they had assigned their estates to others before their engagement, that they had offered him the said Lindsey a Regiment whereof he did ac∣cept, and that they shortly expected David Ramsey from England, who accordingly not many dayes after came to Sweden. In company one night, as the Lord Reay Colonel Alexander Hamilton, Sir James Hamilton and David Ramsey, were drinking, they did drinke the Marquesse of Hamiltons health by the name of James by the grace of God King of Scotland, and in discourse David Ramsey complained to him of the great abuses in the Court, and that Popery and Arminianisme exceedingly pre∣vailed to which the Lord Reay replying, that there was no remedy but patience, nay sayes David Ramsey (with a great oath) to use your own words my Lord, VVe must help God to amend it. Further said, that the Mar∣quesse was a good Protestant, and before it were long, he would let the world see his designe was for the de∣fence of his Religion, the Lord Reay answered that it would be small advantage to us to procure a free pas∣sage of the Gospel in Germany, if we lost it at home, to which David Ramsey said, there were many honest men at home, and that the Marquesse would make use of his Army to protect them, and that this was his onely aym. Whereupon the Lord Reay offered his service in that quarrell: David Ramsey said it was not needfull to im∣part
any more to him of the businesse, he must keepe his masters secret; but if there was any thing the Lord Reay desired to be done for him in England, he could do his Lordship service; Colonell Hamilton and Sir James being to go for England, the Lord Reay desired to have the reversion of Orkney, saying it were for the advantage of the Marquesse his ends to have a friend in that place; and on the morrow Colonel Alexander Hamilton and David Ramsey having given him great assurance of true friendship from their master the Mar∣quesse, if he would continue constant in resolution, they desired him to write a generall Letter to the Mar∣quesse with the two Colonels; which he did, and so they parted. In the Moneth of July, Master Robert Meldrum be∣ing come from the Marquesse in pursuance of that same designe, the Lord Reay met with him in Pomerland, and asked newes from England, to which Master Meldrum answered that matters became worse and worse, and the King did give greater way to Papists and Armi∣nians then before; then he asked the Lord Reay where his Cosen David Ramsey was, and what he had done; and the Lord Reay told him that he was gone for Hol∣land, and all things were done according to his mind, and particularly that he had taken care for Armes and Ammunition to be sent to the Marquesse from Sweden; at which newes Master Meldrum did throw his cap to the ground and jumped up, calling aloud, good newes, good newes, I am a happy man, I am happy and made up for ever, I thanke God my five yeeres paines are not lost; my good Lord Reay, is this true? To which the Lord Reay replying that it was true, and that he had a du∣plicat of the contract, and was engaged in the busines
to David Ramsey, and the two Colonels and to the Marquesse by Writ. Master Meldrum said, O my Lord, that was the worke of God, and not man, to inspire your Lordship to joyne with us. Further Master Meldrum told to Lindsay my Lord Reays Lieutenant Colonel, that six thousand trayned souldiers with their own Faction in the Countrey would be able to do the businesse. The day following at Colonel Leslies Tent, Ma∣ster Meldrum told the Lord Reay that King Charles was created for nothing but for desolation and undoing of kingdomes, Religion and people, and there was no way left, but to take him and immure him within a wall or Dungeon for ever. The Lord Reay demanded how that could be got done; Master Mel∣drum answered, that the way was easie; for after the men were levyed in Scotland they might take one moneth to traine them at Leith without any suspition, then they might seise on the Castles of Edinburgh Sterling and Dumbartan and the Town of Barwick in one night, and having fortifyed Leith, then to enter England by open force. Further, he told that the Lord Reay that he was wri∣ting a Declaration concerning the Marquesse his just and cleere title to the Crown, and touching the tyran∣nicall usage and sufferings of the Church under King James in his last dayes, and now worse, groaning un∣der his Son. Within a few dayes there came newes of the birth of the Prince, and the Lord Reay asked M. Meldrum whether this would coole the Marques his intentions, to which master Meldrum sighing, said, not, If the King and Queen of Bohemia would give their daughter to the Marquesse,
as they had promised; making no question or difficul∣ty about the Marquesse his divorcing from his present wife, which (as David Ramsey had affirmed) was a ve∣ry beast, and the King had forced him to marry her. Also Master Meldrum being in company drinking with Lieutenant Colonel Lindsay and on Henry Mus∣champ an English Gentleman, he did discover so much of that businesse, as the morrow after the Lieutenant Co∣lonel told the Lord Reay he thought Master Meldrum the worst Secretary in the world. Master Meldrum in discourse one day with the King of Swedens Secretary said, it were greatly for the ad∣vantage of the King of Sweden whose ambition was without limits, that the Marquesse did raise warre in Britaine; for if the King of sweden had a designe on Den∣marke, the King of Britain should not be able to help his Unckle; Whereunto the Secretary replyed, that they feared not the King of Britain; for he that would not help his owne Sister, would never helpe his Unckle. The Lord Reay asked Master Meldrum what they in∣tended to do with the Queene and Prince, he answe∣red, that they would shut up the child with his father, and send the Queen to her Mother, to be put into a Monastery. Mr. Meldrum further acquainted the Lord Reay, that the Marquesse would take pledges of all in Scotland who would not joyne with him, or make them prisoners, and that he the said Master Meldrum was to be Secreta∣ry of State. When the Lord Reay came to Holland in March 1631 he met with David Ramsey, who delivered him a Let∣ter from the Marquesse, of complement and thanks, and
told him that all went right with the Marquesse, that he had gotten from the King ten thousand pounds in En∣gland, and the Wine customes in Scotland for divers yeeres, which he would sell, and that all things pro∣ceeded without obstacle, only the stay was for Armes and Ammunition; afterwards he said he had ill newes to tell the Lord Reay, which was, that the Marquesse his wife was brought to bed of a child; but for the busines of Orkney, that the Lord Reay might have it cheaper then to pay the duties of it, and that when the Lord Reay met with the Marquesse, he would infuse that into him which he the said David Ramsey durst not. He said further, that the King had made a Peace with Spaine very prejudiciall to Holland, and that the Trea∣surer Cottington and others had muffled the King to bar the Hollanders from the fishing, which might fall out happily for them. When the Lord Reay came to England, the Lord Hamilton did give him many thanks, assuring him he would not want him, that he should have what con∣ditions he desired, and that he had written to the king of Sweden with Elphingstonn and Meldrum that he would detaine him, and if he would hazard with him the said Marquesse in this businesse, that it should be a tye for ever upon him and his posterity. In the beginning of May 1631, the Lord Reay, meet∣ing with the Lord Ochiltry at the Beare of the Bridge∣foot, he said to the Lord Ochiltry, your Lordship is bet∣ter acquainted with the Lawes of the Land then I, who am a souldier and have lived abroad; I do therefore de∣sire to know, what danger it is if a man should heare a∣broad any Plot against the king and state, and not re∣veale it; The Lord Ochiltry answered that it was the
losse of life and estate; and within eight or ten days after, upon promise of secrecy not to divulge it without his advise and direction, the Lord Reay communicated the whole businesse to the Lord Ochiltry. After revealing of it, they resolved first to acquaint the Lord Treasu∣rer of England therewith, that he might impart it to the king, and accordingly the Lord Ochiltry did acquaint the Lord Treasurer with it, and afterward upon the 18 of May, the Lord Reay delivered in a relation of all the particulars before mentioned, under his hand, which he offered likewise to seale with his blood. The Marquesse of Hamilton being then in Scotland upon secret advertisement from a friend at Court, came speedily to the king, who at first entertained him not with that familiarity he was wont; but by his cun∣ning policy, and subtile insinuations he prevailed over the kings good nature, perswading him to beleeve that all was done out of malice, and that these were aspersi∣ons and calumnies invented by the Lord Ochiltry, whom he caused the King to send to Scotland to be there tryed and censured, well knowing, that at such a distance from the King he could order the matter as he pleased. It is to be observed that the Lord Ochiltry, confer∣ring with the Treasurer of England, who was desirous to be informed of the Marquesse of Hamiltons power and strength in Scotland, with more forwardnesse and affection, then due consideration, did give in a list of the names of the friends of the Marquesse, whom he ap∣prehended would be most ready to joyne with the Marquesse, and that when the Marquesse returned from Scotland to Court, he suggested to the King that
there might be present danger to his person, by suffe∣ring the Marquesse, who was the prime Agent to come neer him. In these particulars it is true, that the Lord Ochiltry had no warrant from the Lord Reay, to deliver in a list of names to the Treasurer, nor to say to the King, that he was in present danger by the returne of the Marquesse from Scotland; But all the rest of the particulars the Lord Reay did acknowledge, and de∣liver in subscribed with his hand: yet the Lord Reay was not at all challenged for any information he had given, nor the Lord Ochiltry, for any thing he had said by warrant from the Lord Reay, but such was the pow∣er of the Marquesse, as the Lord Ochiltry was arraigned for delivering in that list of names, and suggesting to the king his feares of his Majesties danger, upon the Marquesse his returne; and his friends perceiving, after Ochiltry had pleaded for his own innocency, that the matter relished otherwise then was expected, found wayes to put off further Tryal, and to imprison him, first in Edinburgh, there after in the blacknesse that he might be out of the way, and at further distance from the King, who was then comming to Scotland; in which prison he lyeth still, the matter never yet being put to any legall tryal, nor he declared guilty or not guilty, notwithstanding his frequent petitions for the same. The Lord Reay in the meane time who was the chiefe informer, not at all to this day troubled or accu∣sed, which no question if the Marquesse had not been conscious to his own guiltinesse, could not have come to passe; however it is well known to some at Court, what power David Ramsey had over the Marquesse all his life; and that when he was reduced to any strait or want, if the Marquesse furnished him not readily, or ob∣tained
such suits from the King as he desired, he would vow and sweare to discover that the Marquesse was a Traitor, after which he hath been secretly brought in∣to the Marquesse his lodging, his desires granted, and they reconciled. And it is likewise well known, that Master Meldrum hath a pension from the Marquesse yearly. I might here adde the examinations, touching Ma∣ster Meldrum, and others about this businesse; but be∣cause I promised to be brief, I shall only adde the De∣position of one Master l. Borthwick, which he delive∣red to the King signed with his hand, that you may understand what sort of people these be; the words which he deposeth Meldrum to have said are these. 1. Domum Regis esse profluvium iniquitatis & foeti∣dum lupanar. 2. Reginam esse omnium mulierum salacissimam. 3. Flagellum dei inhaerere universae familiae & stirpi Jacobi Regis. The next attempt of the Marquesse to get power in∣to his hands was in the beginning of the troubles of Scotland, upon occasion whereof he procured to him∣selfe to go to that Kingdome, to settle all differences there; but if we may judge of his intentions by his actions and the issue, that was not his errand to Scot∣land, but to increase the differences; for when after ma∣ny juglings between King and subject, he put all over to the determination of the Nationall Synod at Glas∣gow, then within seven or eight dayes dissolved it, and returned to the King, whom he incensed against his Subjects of Scotland, as he had done them against their
King, hoping to fish in muddy waters. A war follow∣ed, and the Marquesse purchased to himselfe the com∣mand of the Navy, that whatsoever danger the King should be in, the Marquesse himselfe might be in safe∣ty, and look on as a spectator. When he came to the firh of Scotland, he acted his part at sea, as he had done in the land; None could discerne whether he was for the King or the Countrey; he did weare the Kings colours; but was very sparing of his men and ammuni∣tion, neither indeed was it safe for him to do otherwise; for the Covenanters sent some into the ships to him, to let him know that if he did any harme, they would dis∣cover and make good all the businesse, of which he was accused by the Lord Reay and Ochiltry; which no que∣stion they could very well have done, Master Meldrum being then a forward Covenanter. When a pacification was made betwixt the King and his subjects of Scotland, and the Scots entred this King∣dome the year following, the Marquesse still kept cor∣respondence with the chiefe Covenanters: and if some of the Scots Commissioners had not for Court ends stood his friends, in the beginning of this Parliament, he had suffered, for his abusing both King and people; for some Articles were once in preparation by the House of Commons for his counselling the King to the breach of pacification, for betraying the Kingdome to the Scots, for the multitude of his Monopolies, his ad∣vising the King to wracke Master Trew a member of the House of Commons, after the dissolution of the former Parliament, and diverse other things; But that accusation was laid aside, upou promise to perswade the King to passe an act for a trienniall Parliament, and not to dissolve this present Parliament without their own
consent, and the like good services to be done to the House of Commons. When the King went to Scotland, in Anno 1641. the Marquesse to ingratiate himselfe with the Coun∣trey, joyned with the Earle of Argile and that faction, and upon pretence of a Plot against him by some Cour∣tiers and souldiers, went from the Parliament of Edin∣burgh to the Countrey with Argile, at which time the King declared publickly in Parliament, that however now he seemed to comply with them, he was the only man that incensed him against that Kingdome; and up∣on the other part, it is well knowne that Hamilt on even when he was his Majesties Commissioner, often said in private to the chief Covenanters, that nothing would prevaile with the King but force and necessity. In the yeare 1643. when the King had very neer subdued all his opposers in England, and reduced the whole Kingdome to his obedience, except London and three or foure Garrisons, and there was no probable meanes left for those few members, who stiled them∣selves a Parliament, whereby to preserve themselves, or to oppose the King, but the calling in of the Sects, and when it was not possible, at the least very difficult for the Covenanters to afford any considerable assist∣ance to their Confederates in England, if those who professed themselves to be the Kings friends in Scot∣land, had faithfully acted their parts, then Hamilton thought it time for him to passe over from the Cove∣nanters and pretend for the King, that by having ac∣cesse to his Counsels, he might betray them, and disap∣point his designes. The Kings friends finding him thus enclined, procured great offers to be made to him from the King as to make him Duke, and give him in
marriage the Prince Electors sister, the Kings Neice, which he chearfully embraceth, and promiseth to do great services to the King. No sooner doth he heare that the Queen is landed at Berlington, but with all expedition he repairs to her Majestie, to congratulate her safe returne. The Noble Marquesse of Montrosse had before his comming ac∣quainted her Majestie what dangers were to be feared, from the Covenanters in Scotland, and that there was no way to prevent them, but that by authority from his Majestie, all the Kings friends should rise in Armes to oppose them. But Hamilton condemnes this as a ve∣ry rash counsell, and undertakes by faire meanes to hin∣der the raising an Army in Scotland, if the King would trust him with the managing of that businesse; and to make it the more plausible, he promised to do it with∣out any trouble or expence to the King; whereupon a good King easily cozened with the faire pretences of one so neer in bloud, and so much obliged unto him, gives him absolute trust. When he returns to Scotland, he makes as great pro∣fessions at home, as he had done abroad, & would gladly have seemed to be the most zealous man living for the King inerest; yet in al his actions crossed the advise and Resolution of the Kings friends. For the King being ad∣vertised, that the Covenanters had indicted a Conventi∣on of Estates without his knowledg, wrote a letter to the Duke, and those of the councell, to discharge the Con∣vention: but he concealing the letter, desired the Earle of Callendor, to speak with the Earle of Broxburgh, and some other Noble men best affected to his Majesty, and to crave their advice; they all in one voice answered, that it was their Iudgement the King should disclaime
the Convention, and declare it illegall; but the Duke sends them word by the Earle of Callendor, that it was the Kings minde to approve the Convention with some limitations; which though it made them to alter their advise, yet as it was related by the Duke, it was most false, the King never having had any such things in his thoughts, untill it was suggested to him by Hamilton, as the advice of his friends in Scotland, and that there were hopes to carry matters in the Convention for the kings advantage, or at least to hinder any assistance to be sent to England against him: thus the king and his faithfull ser∣vants in Scotland were deluded, and by Hamiltons policy, induced to countenance the Convention to the great prejudice of the kings affairs; but when they came there, yet the Duke and his brother Lanerks carriage in that convention, and after it, was no wayes according to what was promised in the conference with the Noble men that were affected to the king, of the truth whereof the Earle of Callendor and Mr. Murrey can particularly in∣forme you, and how he would neither joyne with the kings friends, in a course of opposition, nor give his ap∣probation, that they should do it themselves, without his personall appearance in the businesse, but on the con∣trary discouraged those, who were willing and ready to take their lives in their hands, and to adventure all that was dearest unto them for his Majesty. When he had thus disappointed the kings service, then he and his brother Lanerk wrote letters to the king to advertise him, that very speedily an Army was to come into England, and according to their promise, they had hindred them all summer, but could not hinder them any longer; shortly after these letters, the two bre∣thren began their Journey to Court, where they found
their Juglings discovered to the King, and a processe drawne against the Duke, wherein it was offered to be proved, that he was the occasion of all the troubles and evils that have befallen these Kingdomes; in particu∣lar, that he enticed the king to begin the War against Scotland, and in an underhand way, stirred up the peo∣ple against the king, by advising them not to yield, and bidding them insist, and they would get their will, for he was a very coward, and that if he got his will, he would prove a greater Tyrant then Nro; that he had mannaged all businesses wherewith the king had trusted him, to his Majesties disservice; particularly that he had given way to the present raising of an Army in Scotland against the king. There are divers other articles in that charge, some of them are coincident with what I have already written, though more largely expressed, and therefore I trust you will excuse me, that I have not sent you a Copy thereof. The king upon consideration of so hainous crimes, and treasonable practices, committed the Duke Priso∣ner to Pendennis, and shortly after his brother Lanerk escaped away from Oxford to London, where he was welcomed by the Scots Commissioners, and dispatched away to their Army by sea with letters of Recommen∣dation, and from the Army to Scotland, where he was instantly received to their Covenant, and admitted to their Counsels, and likewise to the Command of for∣ces. The Duke being prisoner, was not able, though wil∣ling enough, to practice more against his Majesty; yet Lanerk was not discouraged from prosecuting the old designe; for I do very well remember, that when the king was at New-castle, he was credibly informed, that
upon a serious Consultation amongst the Covenanters, what instructions to send to the Scots Commissioners at London, concerning the king, who (as they said) had been the Author of so much blood-shed in both king∣domes, the Earle of Lanerick dropped these words, We can never have peace as long as this king, or any of his race re∣mains; and upon another occasion, we can have no diffe∣rence about Monarchicall Government; all the difference will be who shall be king. It may be he expects the accomplish∣ment of his horoscope, whereof (as himselfe since rela∣ted) he had so great confidence, when he was thought to be in danger, before his escaping from Oxford, saying that he was sure he was not neere his death; for it was promised of him, that before he dyed, he should be a greater man, then it was safe for him to mention. When the Duke was relieved from his imprisonment, and come to London, as I am informed, he had some expres∣sions, which discovered his resenting his imprisonment; one expression so far as I remember, was to this purpose, wherefore should he go to the king, (then at New-castle:) for how could he ever trust that man, who when he was in power imprisoned him? When he came to New-castle, he and Lanerick did un∣dertake to the king to bring him to Scotland, which if they had done, it had been an easie matter for the king to have engaged this kingdome and their Army, for re∣storing his Majesty to his just rights in England; but it stood not with their designes▪ to have his Majesty perso∣nally present in Scotland; that would too much eclipse their greatnesse, and disappoint their ends, and therefore they kept of the king with faire pretences from coming to Scotland, and all other resolutions till a strict Guard was put about him; And within a few dayes he was
delivered over to the Parliaments Commissioners. I cannot forget also to mention, how in the Parliament of Scotland, they made a faire show in reasoning for the king; but when it came to the Vote concerning his de∣livery, the two brethren were in the negative them∣selves, but all their neerest friends and dependers, whose voice they use to command as much as their owne, were in the affirmative. It may be remembred likewise how they kept cor∣respondence with the Sectaries; for little good to his Majesty (I suppose) if all the truth were known. However I perceive, that they have juggled so betwixt the king and his people, as they have got into their hands the Government of one Kingdome, though they dare not take off the maske; you will see that they will manage both peace and war, so as to keep power in their own hands; they will agree with any party to obtaine their ends, and let them pretend what they will for restoring the king, they will really obstruct it: For let any rationall man judge, whether he that durst take the boldnesse in the dayes of his Majesties prospe∣rity to aspire to the Crowne, will not in his Majesties low condition, be ready to take the opportunity to prosecute the same designe. In the late declaration which you say is drawne by Lanerk, I see they pretend as faire for the Presbyterian Religion as for the king, when in reality, they are no further friends or enemies to any Religion, then may serve for their ends and strengthen their interest against the king and his poste∣rity, whereof there is no mention in that declaration; and let the Presbyterians think of them what they will, I make no question, but if the Duke could be king of Scotland, his tender conscience might without the
help of Divines, be perswaded to digest with a moderate Episcopacie, though we love not to buy it at that rate. How Absalom like do they court the people with pre∣tences for the good of Religion, king and Kingdomes; as if they intended nothing, but to performe their vows in Hebron? I conjure you by the dutie you owe to God, and the love you bear to the king and his posterity, that you care∣fully take heed to their serpentine wayes, and give no beleefe even to their sacrest professions or greatest oaths; for then least of all are they to be trusted, as I could easi∣ly cleare unto you from experience of their former dea∣lings. But I will not further weary you, and those doubting friends, to whom you are to communicate this letter, for whose cause I have been much larger, then I intended when I put pen to paper yesternight. Touching the State of affairs here, and what course shall be taken in relation to Hamilton and his party, so as the kings affairs may suffer least prejudice, I refer you to a letter from 123. and another from 271. And so rest. Your Faithfull Servant, London May 23. 1648. Postscript. I forgot to mention that one of Hamiltons predeces∣sors in king Iames the sixth his time, was forfeited by act of Parliament, for his aspiring to the Crowne. FINIS.
