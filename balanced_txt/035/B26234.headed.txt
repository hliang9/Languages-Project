THE French KINGS DECLARATION OF WAR Against The SPANIARD. By The KING. THe Sincere desire the King has had to maintain the Truce concluded in the Year 1684. put His Ma∣jesty upon winking at the Conduct of the Spanish Mini∣sters in the Gourts of all the Princes of Europe, where their only design has been to excite them to take up Arms against France, and the share they had in the Negotiation of the League of Ausbourge was not unknown to His Majesty. His Majesty has likewise been informed of the interest the Governors of the Spanish Netherlands had in the Prince of Orange's Enterprize against England; but not believing that his behaviour in that respect had been pre∣scribed him by the King his Master, who by so many reasons, of Religion, Consanguinity, and the general safe∣ty
of all Kings, found himself obliged to oppose such an Usurpation. His Majesty hoped to be able to bring the most Catholick King to joyn with Him in the reestablish∣ment of the Lawful King of England, and for the preser∣vation of the Catholick Religion against the Union of the Protestant Princes, or at least to keep an exact neu∣trality in ease the posture of the Spanish Affairs did not permit the Catholick King to undertake the like En∣gagements. (His Majesty has to this purpose ordered se∣veral different proposals to be made to him since Novem∣ber last, the which were well received whilst the success of the Prince of Orange's Enterprize appeared doubtful. But these favourable dispositions vanished, as soon as they knew at Madrid of the King of England's departure out of His Kingdom, and since, they discoursed of nothing but of War against France. His Majesty at the same time understood that the Spanish Ambassador in England saw the Prince of Orange daily, and pressed that the English should declare War against France; that the Governor of the Spanish Netherlands raised Troops with all diligence, that he promised the States General to joyn them to theirs in the beginning of the Campaign, and sollicited them as well as the Prince of Orange to march Troops into Flan∣ders, to put them in a condition of making War upon France. All these advices having made the King judge, that in prudence he ought to know what to depend upon, He gave order to the Count de Rebenack His Ambassador at Madrid, to demand a positive Answer from the Most Ca∣tholick King's Ministers, offering Him the continuance of Truce, Provided he wou'd oblige himself to an exact Neutralitie not to Succor directly or indirectly the Ene∣mies of His Majesty. But evil Councels having prevailed, His Majesty was informed that the Resolution was taken to favour, the Usurper of England, and to joyn with the Protestant Princes. His Majesty was also informed much a∣bout the same time that the Prince of Orange his Agents had received considerable Sums at Cadis and Madrid; That the Holland and Brandenbourgh Troops, were Entred the Principle places of the Spaniards in Flanders, and that the Catholick King his Governour of the Low Countries caused the States General to be solicited to advance their Army to
the Walls of Bruxels, all these advices joyned to the an∣swer that compte de Rabenack had received at Madrid, not leaving his Majesty any Room to doubt but that the in∣tention of the Catholick King was to joyn his Enemies: His Majesty believed he ought to loose no time to prevent his evil designes and resolved to Declare Warr against him, as well by Sea as Land, as his Majesty doth by these presents. And to this effect, His Majesty doth order and injoyn all his Subjects, Vassels and Servants to Attaque and fall up∣on the Spaniards, and most expressly forbids them to hold hereafter any Communication, Commerce, or Intelligence with them upon pain of death, and to this end his Ma∣jesty from henceforth hath revoked and doth revoke all Permits, Pasports, Safeguards and safe Conducts which might have been granted by his Majesty or by his Lieute∣nants Generals, and other his officers contrary to these presents, and hath Declared, and doth Declare them Null and of none effect and Force, and forbideth any whatso∣ever to have any regard for them. And his Majesty doth Command and ordain the Admiral, the Marishals of France, Governours and Lieutenants Generals, for his Ma∣jesty in his Provinces and Army's, Marishals of Gamps, Col∣lonels, Masters of Camps, Captains, Chiefs and Leaders of his Troops, as well Horse as Foot, French and Strangers, and all other his officers, whom it may concern; that the con∣tents of these presents they cause to be executed within the extent of each of them, his power and jurisdiction; for such is his Majesties will. And his Majesty willeth and ex∣pecteth that these presents should be published, and af∣fixed in all his Towns, as well Maritine as others, and in all his Harbours, Ports, and all other places of his Kingdom, and Countries under his obedience, where need shall be, so that no body may pretend Ignorance. Given at Versaill's  the 15th of April 1689.
