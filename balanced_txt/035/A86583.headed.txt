A Proposal for a Fund for Greenwich-Hospital and Registered Seamen. WHereas a great many Persons, Inhabitants in and about the Citties of London & Westminster, South∣wark and parts adjacent, and in other Cities and Towns in England, make use of the Ground fronting their Houses, and adjoyning thereunto, which they have no Right to, or Property in; and have made Vaults and Cellers un∣der the Streets, Lanes, Yards, Passages, Alleys and Courts, which prove of great Use and Advantage to them, and dan∣gerous to Carriages, Horses and Men, by often falling in. Wherefore it is humbly Proposed to the Wisdom of the Ho∣nourable House, that there be a Tax of One Penny for every Foot Square in the length and breadth yearly upon all Vaults and Cellars that are not directly under the Houses, And that the Cheif Officers of ever Parish & Precinct do take an Account of all such Vaults & Cellars aforesaid, and cause the same to be truly measured, & to return a true Account of the same un∣der their Hands with the Names of the Persons that pretend to own them or use them, that there may be regular Books made for that purpose. And to save the Charges of Collecting the Money Arising from every Vault and Cellar. That all the Persons be oblidged to bring their Money half yearly to such Place or Places, and to such Person or Persons as shall be ap∣pointed by Act of Parliament, under a penalty therein menti∣oned, to be Levyed by Distress or Attachment against the Person offending. And if any Person shall make any new Vaults or Cellars, that he shall give notice to the Receiver, that it may be measured and entred in the Book kept for that purpose aforesaid on a penalty by the said Act. Proposed by Tho. Hoskins Gent.
