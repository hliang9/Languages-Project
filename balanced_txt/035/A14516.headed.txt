By the Counsell of Virginea. SEeing it hath pleased God, after such hard successe, and the manifold impediments knowne to the world, that now by the wisdome and industry of the Lord Go∣uernour settled in Virginea, the state and businesse of the English Plantation there succeedeth with hope of a most prosperous euent, and that therefore it is resolued and almost in a readinesse, for the further benefit and better setling of the said Plantation, to make a new supply of men, and all necessarie prouisions, in a Fleet of good Ships, vnder the con∣duct of Sir Thomas Gates and Sir Thomas Dale Knights, and for that it is not intended any more to burden the action with vagrant and vnnecessarie persons: this is to giue notice to so many honest and industrious men, as Carpenters, Smiths, Coopers, Fishermen, Tanners, Shoomakers, Shipwrights, Brickmen, Gardeners, Husbandmen, and labouring men of all sorts, that if they repaire to the house of Sir Thomas Smith in Philpotlane in London, before the end of this present moneth of Ianuarie, the number not full, they shall be entertained for the Ʋoyage, vpon such termes as their qualitie and fitnesse shall deserue. Jmprinted at London for William Welby, 1611.
