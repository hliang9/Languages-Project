THE PROCEEDINGS To Execution of the Sentence Awarded against Captain Thomas Walcot, William Hone, and John Rouse; FOR High-Treason: Who were, on Fryday the 20th. of this Instant July, Drawn, Hang'd, & Quarter'd AT TYBURN, For Conspiring the Death of the KING, and to raise War and Rebellion; in order to subvert the Government, &c. Containing a Relation of what happened during their Imprisonment; As also their last Speech & Confession At the Place of EXECUTION. THomas Walcot, William Hone, and John Rouse, having been Accused to the King's most Honourable Privy Council, &c. by the Discoverer of the Plot, contrived, and carryed on against the Life of His Sacred Majesty; and upon Warrants issued ou for that purpose, Apprehended the were, and on the 12th. of this Instant July; brought  the Sessions-House in the Old-Bayly and there Arraigned upon an Indictment of High-Treason, found against them by the Grand Juy of London, for Conspiring, and Designing to compass th Death of the King, to raise Wa and Rebellion, and in order there to, procuring and providing Arms;  Muses, Blunderbuses, Pistols, &c. Whereupon they pleading not guilty, and putting themselves upon their Country, Thomas Walcot was ordered to look to his
Challenges, in excepting against such of the Panil of Jurors, as he thought fit, to the number of a peremptory Challenge, which is 35; when having made acceptions a∣gainst all such as any ways appertained to the Lieutenancy, at length a Jury of 12 Men were Sworn, and Charged with the Prisoner, to try the Issue between the King and him, in Case of his Life and Death. Whereupon Colonel John Rumsey, Mr. West, Mr. Keel∣ing, Mr. Bourn, and others, Swore him to be present at divers Conspiracies, Consults, and Trayterous Contrivances, and that he was to Command a Party, to destroy the Guards, whilst others of his Accomplices, Assassinated the KING and Duke of of York, &c. In February last, at what time they were to return from New-Market, and that a Consult was held to inquire into the day of their return, and that they differed about the particular time, though they afterwards came to a Result, but were frustrated in their Bloody Design, by the Fire that happened at the place aforesaid. These and such like Contrivances and Conspiracies Sworn against Walcot and Wil. Hone, on Fryday following being the 13th. Instant, together with John Rouse, were Tryed for the like Treason, in Conspiring against the Life of His Majesty, Him to Death and final De∣struction to put, &c. against whom the Kings Evidence deposed, First, that Hone had consented to be one of the intended Assassinates, and was to have a Sum of Money to buy him Furniture, as Horse and Arms, &c. and that he declared he was to be one that was to seize the Captain and Lieutenant; and at another time, That it would ne∣ver be well with England till the Black-Bird and Gold-finch were knocked on the head, and that he by those Mysterious Expressions meant the King and Duke of York, accor∣ding to his own Explanation. These and many more, were the Circumstances that occured upon this and the former Tryal; as also upon that of John Rouse, who was Tryed the same day upon an Indictment of High-Treason, in Conspiring against the Life of the King, &c. so that in the end they were after divers Arguments found Guilty, and the day following received Sentance to be Drawn, Hang'd, and Quarter'd, as the Law, in Case of Conviction for High-Treason, requires; when desiring their Friends might visit them, and time for Repentance be allowed, they were remanded to Prison, where, as Men sensible of the near approach of their dissolution, they continued, being often visited by their Friends and Relations, who came to condole and comfort them with seasonable admonitions to prepare for a future state, seeing their lives were forfeited to the Law, and that execution of the Sentence pronounced would not be long deferrd; forasmuch as all hopes of Pardon was vanished; and whether a Reprieve for longer life would be granted to them, remained doubtful, the former and the latter remaining at the pleasure of His Majesty, whom they had so highly offended. Whereupon take∣ing the cordial advice of those that regarded their happiness (as to the life to come) se∣riously considered in what state they remained, and what a large account they were shortly to give before the dreadful Tribunal of all their actions; insomuch that at times that they were not molested with Visitants, their serious thoughts were for the most part imployed in confessing their sins, and begging pardon of God for their offences: during their abode in Newgate, the Sherriffs of London and Middlesex came to Visit them, and to perswade them to confess the truth of the Conspiracy as far as their know∣ledge would permit, as likewise divers other loyal persons; but they seemed much reserved, saying, That they had been drawn into disgrace, and consequently to an un∣timely end by giving too much credit to the words of some persons; and that it was now too late to retrieve what was past, but earnestly begged pardon of those they had oftended: Captain Walcot seldom appeared publickly, but kept himself to his re∣tirement, either Reading or Conversing with such Friends as came to visit him. John Rouse was often observed in busie, as is supposed Writing, but to what Effect remains yet uncertain, unless a Petition to humbly beseech his Majesty; that his dead Body might be restored to his Wife. William Hone was the most dejected, the fear of death, having almost stupified him; so that he was hardly induced to answer to the Questions demanded of him, by such as came to Examine him. This and such like being their Behaviour, till they had notice that the▪ Warrant was Signed for their Execution, and that they must prepare to dye as this day, which heavy News they received with different passions, and continued as Men who expected no other than death, till the
morning, at which time being put into Sledges, they were drawn to the place of Ex∣ecution, attended by a strong Guard of the Sheriffs Men, Hamlets, and Warders. About 10 in the Morning, Thomas Walcot, John Rouse, and Willam Hone, were brought to Tyburn, the former in a Sledge by himself and the 2 latter in another Sledge, when being unbound, they were helped into the Cart prepared for that purpose, and there for a while conversed with the Ministers, who were Dr. Cartwrite and Mr. Ordinary, both of them perswading them to make an Ingenious Confession according to the best of their knowledge: whereupon Captain Walcot drew out two Papers and shewed them to the Ministers and those that were in the Cart, saying, That he had written them to Read publiquely, which when he was ordered to do, he, with a composed Countenance did Audibly; the first was in nature of a Confession of his Enormities to God, wherein he desired forgiveness of his Sins; declaring, that he been a great Sinner; and for that cause God had suffered him to fall into those Crimes that had ren∣dred him worthy of death; desiring God of his mercy to forgive him his manifold offences; and that all the world would forgive him whom he had offended, putting up divers Ejaculations, desiring that he might be an Example to warn others from daring to attempt any Treasonable Design or Conspiracy against the Life of the King: After which, another Paper he held in his hand, sometimes looking on it, and other times not, whilst he was speaking or making his Confession to the people, declaring that he was Guilty of the Conspiracy as to the knowledge thereof, and that he was drawn into the Conspiracy by people that promised him great things, but that now he plainly perceived there was no Faith in Man: As to the matter of the Assassina∣tion, he confessed to have knowledge of it, and that he had been incited thereto by Evil-affected Persons, whom he desired God to forgive, praying that his and his Fel∣lows present, might be the last Blood that might be shed upon the Occasion of the Conspiracy: He confessed he had been at divers Consults, and that once and no more, to his remembrance, he had been in the company of two Lords, naming divers of the Persons fled upon the Discovery of the Plot and Conspiracy, saying, They had drawn him unexpectedly into the mischief, he having not long been arrived in England, and that too late he was Conscious of his too much Credulity, which had brought him to his deserved, though shameful and unexpected end; desiring God to prosper and preserve the King, or to this purpose. He also said, That when the Conspiracy was discovered, he was promised by some, who had drawn him into it, to be safely conveyed into Holland; and that when they had taken him, and were conveying him to Prisonward, they told him they designed to Ship him, &c. And so continued with Penitential Tears, to bewail his Crimes, and unhappy end; but would not own that he was actually to kill the King; though he was to be as∣sisting therein; desiring the people to obey and in all Cordial sincerity in dear themselves to His Majesty, who well deserved the love and tenderest respect of his Subjects. This being the substance of Walcots Speech, John Rouse began to make his Confession, when having desired God to forgive him his Sins, he confessed that he had been at divers Consults, and that he was to have acted, but as to each particular he was igno∣rant; but that he had been privy to many Treasonable Discoveries, tending to an Insurrection or the like, desiring God to forgive him his many Sins, which he said had been multiplyed; but that he was above all, sorrowful for offending a∣gainst such great Light, saying, The crys of a Wife and Children were the chiefest Instigations to make him ingage in the Wicked Design, of which he heartily repented, and for which he had justly deserved to dye; declaring that he had been drawn into it by the Earl of Shaftsbury and others who were now fled; and that he did not, when first he entred into it, think the Design had any ways tended to the touching the Life of His Majesty, or that the Con∣spiracy would have arrived to the heigth it at last did; and continued to express his sorrow and Repentance for his being so long Conscious of so Notorious a Wickedness, and not revealing it; which he Attributed to the fear of his own safety, by reason he had for some time past, been under evil Circumstances, and been rendred Obnoxious to many persons of known Loyalty. And in fine, he confessed most of the Charge, Evidenced against him at his Tryal in the Old-Bayly, on the 13th. Instant, grie∣vously
complaining against those that had drawn him into the mischievous Conspiracy, begging forgiveness of all he offended in thought or deed, desiring God to continue the King's Life, and long Reign, &c. Hone spoke little as to particulars, but in general, confessed that he was guilty of the Conspiracy, and was to have been one of the number, that was to have Assassinated the King, in his return from New-Market; and that Good∣enough and others, had by many perswasions prevailed with him, to undertake what he did. He likewise confessed, he had told Mr. West, he had spoke with Goodenough, and related to him the measures that he was to take; saying, That he had agreed to be one in the Assassination, with divers other Circumstances, of which these are the most ma∣terial; though indeed his discourse was but short, in respect to the two former. The Confessions thus made, or as near as could be taken; thus, or to this Effect the Ministers prayed with them, and sung a Psalm, after which, they severally desired to say a Prayer of themselves, which was granted: Captain Walcot being first, who prayed fervently, as being throughly sensible of his Offence, desiring the prayers of all good men. Next, Hone made a prayer, and afterwards Rouse, each of them seeming greatly to bewail the greatness of their Offences, asking forgiveness, especially of His Majesty, against whom they had so highly offended; when being asked what further they had to say, they only desired that God would forgive them, and that all people would take Example by them, and not be inticed, or perswaded to enterprize so great a Wickedness, as had brought them to ruin; Temporal though as they hoped God would accept of their late Repentance, and those that heard them, and beheld their un∣timely end, would take warning thereby, and avoid the like Temptations. Thus, or to this Effect, they having confessed and declared, the Cart was drawn away, and after they had Hung three quarters of an hour, they were cut down, and Quarter∣red one by one, their Bowels burnt; &c. According to the Sentance pronounced a∣gainst them. FINIS. Printed for Langely Curtis, near Fleet-Bridges: 1683.
