HOUSE-HOLD OBSERVATIONS NECESSARY FOR THESE TIMES. IF thou, my Servant, wilt thy Master please, Thou must observe and keep such Lawes as these; BE true and trusty, let thy hands be cleare: And to purloyne thy Masters goods forbeare. I hate a Lyer, and a Saucie Knave: And in a Gaimster I no pleasure have. I Hate the Man that hath a vanting Vaine: And Him, that loves anothers fame to Staine. I like not Him, that is unapt to Learne: Nor Him, that Grudging, doth his wages Earne. The Churlish, and the Envious man I hate: And Him I love not, that doth sow Debate. Sly Knaves, that would my Secrets over-look: Proud Fools, nor talking Fools; I cannot brook. I trust not Him, that would with Fauning please: Nor Him, that loves his Belly and his Ease. The false, deceitfull man I hate as Hell: Only with Me the honest man shall dwell. Hee's Gentle, Faithfull, willing to Obey: And well deserves, to Rule another day. London, printed by T. Paine, and are to be sold by F. Coles in the Old-Baily, 1647.
