AN ALARUM Sounded forth from the Lord God of Vengeance unto England's Rulers, Mayors, Magistrates, and Unjust Judges, who are found Oppressors of the Seed and Heritage of God: For whose sakes the Lord God is risen to plead, and suddenly will bring Destruction on them all, if they repent not; and this I publish in God's Authority. HOwl, howl, howl, ye Inhabitants of the Earth; for the voice of God's thunders are gone forth against you, and the Lord God is risen in Jealousie to plead by the Sword of his Eternal Power, and all must know the fire of the Lord God's Indignation to pass over them, who are found this day opposing the work of the Lord God, who will work and none shall let him, who shall work and none shal hinder him; And blessed are all who are found clear of oppressing the work of the Lord; for verily on whom the Stone falls on, it shall grind him to powder; and whosoever falleth upon it shal be bro∣ken in pieces. And God hath determined the deliverance of his own Seed, which trusteth in his name; and for their sakes the Lord God, who is a consuming fire, will break forth sud∣denly, to the utter ruine and destruction of all his enemies, and all shal burn as an Oven; for God is kindling of a fire among the Briers and Brambles of the Earth, an utter consum∣ption is coming upon them all: As God brought the Flood in Noah's daies upon the world for the wickedness thereof, even so is the Lord bringing of an over-flowing scourge, which shal sweep away the Wicked by the Besom of his own destruction. Wo unto the World, and all that are found therein, Judgment is begun already at the House of God, and who shall abide the day of his coming, wherein he will set as with Fi∣ners fire; then shall the heavens pass away as a scrowl, with lightning, with thundering, and with earthquakes; then shall the elements melt with fervent heat; then shal every man's works be tried by fire; and this the Trumpet of the Lord of Hosts which is blown to you all, dread, fear and tremble before the terrible God, who will shake both heaven and earth, who removeth the foundations thereof; and verify the Lord God will roar out of Si∣on with a voice of terrible thunder, and at the sound thereof all the beasts of the field shall tremble; For this is the day of the Lord God, wherein he will shake the kingdoms of dark∣ness, and the powers thereof shal fall, and the Lord onely shal be exalted over all: and again will he dash the potshards of the earth to pieces; and this day is at hand wherein Overturn¦ing, Overturning shal come from the mighty hand of the Lord, and such a down fall is near, as never was the like in the Nation of England; this is the Lord's bringing to pass, that all may know, that onely he alone reigneth over all, who hath power to do whatsoever he will; then shal all know that God is in the midst of the most contemptible, despised remnant, who are not counted worthy to live upon the earth; but blessed are they from the Lord God, and they shal be blessed, although all the enchanters of Egypt study mischief against the Israel of God, yet their divinations shal not hurt Jacob, nor the enchantments prosper against Israel the called of God, none shal be like unto them; yea, they shal shine in glory, to the tormen∣ting of Egypts Dogs, who are barking and biting, who are like Wolves, tearing and renting the Lambs of the Fold of God's everlasting rest, but they cannot rent them from the rest, not pluck them from the Fold, neither can they take any of them out of the hands of the good Shepherd, who watcheth over his both night and day; for the Wolf cometh in the night, so the Wolves are in the night. The Dogs are in the darkness, and for mad they bite, being set on fire from hell, who are subjects of the Prince of Darkness, which is the Captain whom they follow, who is the King of the bottomless pit, who hath now sent forth his messengers, with all the wise men of Egypt, who are seeking for the Man-child to destroy it; but it is hidden from them all, so all that they shall slay and destroy is but the First-born of Egypt, which is the son of perdition, which is to be drawn in the gulf of misery. And this is the day when God's work doth prosper, and his truth shal spread and increase, and thousands shal be gathered unto it, and many shal come from the East and from the West, and shal walk in the Light of the Lord God, whose day shal be glorious, to the astonishment of the Nations, and never did the sons of Adam since the begining ever see the like glory which the Lord God is now revealing, shal shine over all, at whose bright appearance mountains shal fall, and the hills shal melt at the dreadful presence of the living God, whose glory shal burn through all the clouds, and the rising of the Sun shal make them all to vanish; so glorious, so excellent shal be the day of God, that none shal be able to abide it, but they that can dwel with ever∣lasting burnings; then shal Gods enemies fall, then shal his power and his glory shine over all; then shal his throne be established on the tops of the Mountains, and all shal cast down their Crowns before him; then shal the Kingdoms of the World become the Kingdoms of God, then shal Halelujahs be sung over all by the redeemed of the Lord; and now is the shout of a King gone forth, founding this Alarum unto all Englands Rulers, Mayors, and Magistrates, Justices and Judges, proclaiming the day of the Lord which is coming on them all: Fear, tremble and dread the living God from whom this is sent, and published By me Dorothy White.
