Jenneys Lamentation for the loss of Jocky OR, A New Song in the Play called the ROYALIST. TWa Bony Lads were Sawny & Jockey, But Jockey was Lo'd & Sawny unlucky; Yet Sawny was tall, well-favor'd & wity, But I's in my heart thought Jocky more prity; For when he view'd me, su'd me, woo'd me, never was Lad so like to undo me: Fie I cry'd, and almost di'd, least Jockey wou'd gang and come no mere to me. (2) Jockey would Love, but he would not Marry; And I'se have a Dread least I should miscarry: For his cunning Tongue with Wit was so guilded, That I was affraid my Heart would have yielded; Daily he prest Prest me, Blest me, Kist me; Lost was the Hour methought when he mist me; Crying, Denying, and Sighing I Woo'd him; But ah! much ado had I to get fro' him. (3) But Unlucky Fate rob'd me of this Jewel, For Sawney would make him Fight in a Duel; And down in a Dale with Cyprus surrounded, Oh! There to his Death poor Jockey was Wounded; But when he Thrill'd him, Fell'd him, Kill'd him, Who can express my Grief that beheld him? Raging, I tore my Hair for to bind him, And Vow'd and Swore I'de ne'r stay behind him. LONDON: Printed for A. BANKS.
