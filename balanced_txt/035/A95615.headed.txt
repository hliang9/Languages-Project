ORMONDS CVRTAIN DRAWN: In a short Discourse concerning Ireland; Wherein his Treasons, and the corruption of his Instruments are laid bare to the stroke of JUSTICE. CIVILIS, a person of reputation, having in London met with DECIUS (a Gentleman of Ireland, and former∣ly of his most intimate acquaintance) being not satisfied with one single sight of him, having long thought he had suffered with those many thousands of English that were destroyed by that bloody Rebellion; desired him if his lei∣sure would permit, to goe along with him to his house in Westminster, where he might learne of him, how it had fared with him, since he had last the happinesse to see him, and what occasions drew him into this Kingdome. DECIUS accepting of the invitation, and by the way as they went, accu∣sing his ill fortune that had brought him to the first sight of him by chance: And CIVILIS (according to his wonted manner) returning his civility with in∣terest; they arrived at the place which CIVILIS called his owne: And be∣ing entred, and having sate some while together, MARCUS a Gentleman of quality, and friend to CIVILIS, comes in to them; who (thinking they were private) would have as soon retired, had not his friend called to him, and invited him to sit downe by them, and then spake to him after this manner. This Gentleman pointing to Decius, being lately come out of Ire∣land,Civilis. and one whom (for the particular friendship between us) I thought I might be bold with: having done me the favour to come so far out of his way as to this house; I was curious to enquire of him the condition of affaires in that Kingdome: And having newly begun to informe me as you came in, I am sure I shall not wrong you, if I desire you to partake with me; and I hope I shall trespasse
as little upon my friend, in desiring him to proceed in his relation, seeing by your arrivall he shall have one witnesse more of his skill in Elocution. MARCUS thanking his friend CIVILIS for the favour he had done him: And both of them strengthning each others perswasions, that DECIUS would take that paines upon him: He spake to this purpose. Though my imperfections might in some measure excuse my dis∣obedience,Decius. and the sadnesse of those things I have both seen and suffe∣red, might affright me from the remembrance of them: I shall rea∣dily overlook my self, and apply me to fulfill your commands, where the pleasure I shall receive in obeying of you, may counterpoise all inconveniences whatsoever. You may remember CIVILIS (as this Gentleman came in to us) I was telling of you, How happily the English were every where seated in Ireland, how they were spread and sowne in all parts of the Kingdome; how the Irish were every day obliged and enriched by them, and brought by their converse with them to a greater degree of civility then they were thought capable of; and (to make the happinesse of the English seem compleat) what hopes they had conceived, and what sure grounds they had built their confidence upon, of a lastingnesse and stability in that their good condition: I doubt not but you will pardon me this fault, if (not to hold you long) I proceed wher I left off, and not go backward to the particulars I then mentioned. CIVILIS and MARCUS both con∣tent to ease him of so much trouble; DECIUS continued his speech as followeth. At the beginning of that bloody Massacre (which I hope for ever will be remembred, to the shame of those that were the Authors and contrivers of it, as well of the actors, and the glory of that God, who by sparing us a remnant, has kept us from being like Sodom, and being made like unto Gomorrah:) at the beginning (I say) of that most horrid Rebellion, I was at my owne house in the Country, some threescore miles from Dublin; where (I may say without boast∣ing) I enjoyed my share of the comfort which God bestowed upon me, in common with the rest of my brethren over the whole King∣dome. For seven or eight miles round the place where I lived, the Inha∣bitants were all English and good Protestants, so that that place might with more right then the other, have beene called the Eng∣lish Pale; me thought it was the onely place (if any) out of which Saint Patricke had banished all venomous creatures; for the rest of the Kingdome, we have found he onely took the poyson out of
the earth to plant it in the Natives (as our Saviour gave leave to the Devils (having cast them out of the man) to enter into the Swine.) Whilst we lived in this happy condition (as we esteemed it) my little fortune (as generally that of the whole English over all the Kingdome,) being never in so good a posture, and with Gods blessing, every day more then other encreasing upon our hands. On that never to be forgotten three and twentieth of October, when we were (as it were) buried in security, and thought of no ill, either of doing it to others, or receiving it from them, especially from the Irish, (who we thought were tyed too fast by the many favours and curtesies of the English, constantly and without wearinesse done to them) to cast those pleasant cords behind their backs, and to embrew their hands in the blood of those that had filled those same hands with so many and good deeds. Truly Sirs, as often as I think of it, I am almost out of my selfe, and stand amazed at the depth of that wickednesse, that reached deeper then hell it selfe, at which the very Prince of the Divels could not but be astonished, being out-done in his owne trade (though he were a murtherer even from the begin∣ning.) Whilst, I say, we were in this pleasant sleep, we were sudden∣ly awaked with the noyse of warre, or rather, with the hideous out∣cryes of our poor Neighbours, who in vaine poured out their breath to preserve their lives. Alas poore creatures, they thought they had to doe with such as themselves (whose eares were never shut to any that called to them in their misery) but they were in the pawes of Lyons and Tygars, or what is worse, they were in the hands of Wild Men (if I may call them men.) The flesh of the Protestants might possibly turne the edge of their swords and skeines, but it was im∣possible for their prayers or teares to turne their hearts. You have read of the Savage Canibals in the Indies, that having taken their enemies in battle, delight to besmeare their bodies and faces in their blood; and having eaten their flesh, carry about their armes and legs upon their shoulders in triumph: In that posture (having bar∣barously Ravaged up and downe the Country) and wearied, rather then satisfied themselves with killing) with their hands and weapons dropping wet in the blood (not of their enemies taken in battle, but of their neighbours and friends surprized asleep, or at their honest labour) they entred my house, and having sacrificed my two sonnes, who were the first they met with to their accursed fury, they ran∣sackt every corner at their pleasure without fear of resistance, having before slaine my men-servants in the field, when they expected no such wages: My Wife, three other children and my selfe, sought out a place to hide us in, but all in vaine, for we were soon found out,
and having stripped us as naked as by this time they had made every room in the house, they brought us into a field hard by, and joyned us to a great company of other afflicted soules, whom they had ser∣ved in the same barbarous manner, and (that there might be variety in their mischiefe) reserved for a more lingring end: It was then in the extremity of a winter, that for sharpnes and cold, had not its like in many yeers before in that Kingdome. I shall forbeare both for your sakes and my own, to set before you the lamentable complaints and the dying groanes of many a poore soule that (as we were hur∣ried up and downe to be witnesses of their barbarous cruelties infli∣cted upon many thousands) through the extremity of the weather, were starved to death; amongst whom, my three children (the eldest not above eight yeers old) gave up their last breath in the armes of their almost dying Mother. I have so sharp a feeling of the misery which you could not choose but suffer,Civilis. being in this condition, that I long impatiently to be freed from the torment I endure in your particular; I pray you therefore make what haste you can to bring me out of it, by letting us know how at length you escaped those so great dangers; for indeed I can hardly yet beleeve you are safe (though I see you here) unlesse you tell me you are so. I cannot but thank you for your fellow-feeling of my sufferings,Decius. and to free you from the torment you are pleased to say you endure, I shall passe over those monstrous, unheard of cruelties which I saw with these eyes, whilst I was carried about from place to place, with many hundreds more of my brethren, who drank all of the same cup with me: and I am induced the rather to doe it, in regard there are so many who have given large and true Relations of them, whose paines therein may appeare to after Ages, like so may Night pieces amongst the Monuments of this Nation: And I hope will be be∣leeved by all, though in themselves almost incredible; and though many doe their endeavour to cast a vaile over them. The evidences of their cruelties are so many and cleer,Marcus. that I think there is none so ignorant that is not acquainted with them, and none (I presume) will doubt of them, but such as inwardly wish they had been greater; and yet I confesse there are many even amongst our selves, that are not afraid to tinter their charity, so farre as to think they would not have done what they did but upon urging and pressing necessity:Bishop of ssory his dis∣covery of My∣steries. That they poor people for feare of their Religion and be∣ing driven our of the Kingdome were forced to doe what they did. That our adversaries should daub over the matter so,Decius. were a thing only to be admired, by such as think the action so glorious & beauti∣full
that it needs no art or paint to set it off; but that such as professe the Protestant Religion should make use of so monstrous and vile a colour, and labour to lay an imputation upon their friends to acquit their adversaries, is a thing not at first fight to be understood, and may very well stumble an honest man, did he not looke more neerly as well into the men as their doctrine, I shall not trouble my selfe or you to confute so malicious an imputation, being as sufficiently knowne to be false, as it renders the Authors corrupt and scan∣dalous. When I mentioned that saying of those men,Marcus. I did it not to ground any opinion of my owne upon it; when I first heard of it, (Ile assure you) it moved not so much my beliefe as my admiration, and thefore you may well spare your confutation of it, 'tis enough but to repeat it. I could not see in my weak reason what feare they could conceive of a designe to root out their Religion by force, when I knew the constant opinion of all Protestants in all Ages, abjured violence in matter of faith, as a thing worthy onely of the Whore of Rome, who shall be destroyed (if ever) by the breath of Gods mouth, that is, by the preaching of the Word, and not by drawing of the Sword: Besides this, I remembred it was a charge against the Gover∣nours of that Kingdome, that they connived too much at the exer∣cise and encrease of Popery there, so that they could have no cause of feare from any thing done against them at that time: And for the Parliament after, they never (before that Rebellion) desired more either here or there, then the execution of the Lawes which were al∣ready in force against them; from which they ought not to free themselves by the sword, or a generall Massacre: And for that other part of the excuse, or rather accusation concerning their estates, that they were forced to take that course, least they might have been rooted out: If there were any grievances by Ministers, the way for redresse was open, and they might have been their owne Judges; the Parliament then sitting at Dublin, wherein they themselves had the swaying vote, and might have done themselves the highest right that could be desired; so that I could not see how they had any thing to feare on this side either: Besides all this, I have heard that imme∣diately before the breaking out of the Rebellion, they had many graces afforded to them by the King, which might have secured them for ever from the thought of the least oppression. You say right Sir,Decius. there were many graces (as they called them) bestowed on them, and such, as (for their largenesse) were very much wondred at by all that wished well to the good of the English in that Kingdome. The Irish in those graces had neere upon a third part
of the Kingdome freely granted to them, and the English wholly ex∣cluded from having any Plantations therein: Which Lands (if they had been managed as was designed, and by right should have been) besides the security which thereby would have redounded to the English, being the best meanes under God to have setled that King∣dome in perpetuall Peace, Religion and Civility: His Majesties Re∣venues would have been bettered out of those lands by 90000lib. per Annum, and that upon a very moderate estimate, allowing about ten pence for every acre; those Territories being by admeasurement, knowne to be above two millions of acres, besides the casuall Reve∣nues which would ensue: This you may well say was a Princely gift indeed. But besides this, there were many other things granted to them at the same time; for what reason I will not say, but sure I am to the utter undoing of the English: Which (if they had but stayed nine dayes longer from the execution of their Treason, till the Par∣liament, according to the prorogation should have met againe at Dub∣lin) had been confirmed to them by a Law: but there was something more in the wind then their owne benefit, that made them hasten it so much. We understand your meaning,Civilis. and I for my part am very much of your mind: I have heard all the particulars of those graces, and doe not see how they could think of making better conditions to themselves by a warre, then they had therein already granted to them, supposing the fortune of the game should leane on their side: This being so, I cannot see what the least appearance of reason there can be in that colour, That the Irish were necessitated to doe what they did. I have alwayes thought upon what I have heard and read; that if there were at any time any fault in the government of that King∣dome, it was in the gentlenesse and remisnesse of it, in letting the cursed seed not onely live, but encrease, even to an hundred fold: The Irish according to my observation, are a people not to be ruled but with a rod of iron: Aut serviunt humiliter, aut superbe dominantur, was of old a good Character of their natures, which they have kept to this very day, being to be compared to nothing more fitly then to those two heady elements of fire and water, that are the best servants being kept within their own bounds; but once masters, lay all waste before them; this the Romans even of old observed very well of them, whenAgricol. in Tan. one of them undertook to maintaine that Kingdome in good subjection to the Roman Empire (which the English could ne∣ver yet compasse) Ʋna legione & modicis Auxiliis si Romana ubique Ar∣ma & libertas quasie conspectu Tolleretur: And I cannot find a greater cause of this (I hope the last) and of those many other insurrections
against the English upon all occasions, then the smoothing of all former Rebellions by Pardons upon fained submissions, whereby the Irish were en∣couraged to play childrens play, and runne in and out at their plea∣sure, and had still opportunity to better and mend their new trea∣sons in poynt of execution, as they found they were out, and failed in their old: As if the English, when they made but one or two of the principall actors examples, had cut off but so many Hidra's heads which alwayes multiplied upon their hands; they alwayes skin∣ned over the wound before they had searched and drawne it to the quick; so that the ill humour brake out continually, not long after in a worse manner: and that which at first was but the corruption of one inconsiderable part, for want of cutting that off, grew to a Gan∣green, that often heretofore, but never so apparently as at this day, endangered the whole body. CIVILIS had proceeded further, had not his friend MARCUS mer∣rily pulled him by the sleeve, and told him he forgot himselfe, since his Adver∣sary had long since laid downe the cudgell, and the onely ground of the digression was blowne away with the first breath: CIVILIS thanking his friend for his feasonable remembrance, desired DECIUS to take up his Relation where he left off: which he (being loth to deprive himselfe of the content he received in bearing of him on that subject) hardly consented to; but MARCUS interpo∣sing, he proceeded as followes. You left me in very ill company, and so you must find me:Decius. I and my Wife for many days together, having, as I told you, nothing to co∣ver our nakednesse, but what we could gather up in the way, and as little to fill our bellies; but (in the condition we were in) hunger was the least part of our torment, for we were so little used to meat, that we had hardly room to receive any. We were driven thus, for many dayes, from place to place, like sheep appointed for the slaugh∣ter; and they that had not the strength to goe as fast as those cruell villaines would have them, had the good fortune that many thou∣sand others wanted, to be buried in the next bogpit or ditch they met with: When they thought they had sufficiently loaden us with sor∣row, and indeed compleated their cruelties, being not able to doe any more (or rather God not suffering of them) they permitted us (in their more cruell mercy) to take our fortunes, beleeving we could not possibly escape the hands of other their companions, who would have been glad of such subjects for their cruelty to work on. Having thus cleered their hands of us, and, as they thought, decei∣ved the deceiver, we made what shift we could, and having lost much
of our company in the snow, who were able to goe no farther, and having overtaken many more that had set out from other parts, in the same sad journey with us, and not in any better condition: We at length, by Gods great mercy, arrived safe at the next strength to us, which at this time was possessed by the English: Where after we had refreshed our selves as well as the charity of wel-affected people would permit, being divided amongst so many as daily resorted thi∣ther in the like nessity: That place being too little to containe us, we set forward, not without great danger, to Dublin; where as soon as we were arrived, my Wife, by reason of the extremity of the cold she had taken, and the griefe she conceived for the losse of her chil∣dren, and what else could be deare to her in this world, fell sick and dyed, and multitudes more of those that got safe to Dublin, having not time, as it were, to dye before; or the varieties of deaths that stared them in the faces, being not able before now to agree, which should take possession of them. When they were come thither, and considered the great misfortunes, but more the heavy hand of God upon the English, their hearts brake in sunder, and I am confident the blood of many thousands who have dyed since, and will doe for these many yeers yet to come, in that and other places of that and this Kingdome, whether they fled for refuge and sanctuary, will be put upon the same score, and their number I think may amount to as many as fell by the sword. CIVILIS and MARCUS being both struck with amazement at the horridnesse of these things they had heard, could not readily find the use of their tongues to expresse the fulnesse of their hearts: At length CIVILLS having walked a turn or two in the room, and being returned to himself, as from a dream, first vented his thoughts in this manner. My good friend,Civilis. though I am unspeakably grieved for your great sufferings, your owne safety does not a little abate my sorrow: I never look upon that damned Master-piece of the Devil, but, that in my owne thoughts I am ready to excuse all the cursed trecheries that ever I heard or read of, compared to this, me thinks they look but like so many Piaefraudes, and the torments of all past ages may be thought to have proceeded more from the favourable mercies of men, then from their cruelty: I am confident that God that has so preserved you, has done it partly for this end, that your owne eyes might behold the Vyals of his wrath and vengeance which he has filled and laid up in store, plentifully poured out uon them: and I am perswaded if we can but with patience expect his owne time, the
time will come, and your eyes shall see it, when those tongues that cryed so loud in the day of Jerusalem, Race it, raee it, even to the founda∣tion, shall cry as loud (but all in vaine) to those same mountaines whereon you were scattered and hunted like Partridges, to fall and cover them; and those hands that have laine so heavy on the backs of so many thousands of you, shall strike as hard their owne brests, and cleave as fast to their owne loynes; and those feet that have been so swift to shed blood, shall not carry them away so fast, but that the fierce anger of the Lord shall overtake them. Though I cannot be so eloquent as my friend CIVILIS,Marcus. yet my Amen may very well stand at the end of his speech: So let thine ene∣mies perish, O Lord, and those that hate thee flee before thee. I perceive MARCUS that the sad Relation which you have new∣ly heard, has not wrought so kindly with you,Civilis. as it has done with me, since you can so soon abuse your friend; but I will beare it for once, if you promise me to be content with our company all this evening; and you DECIUS will be pleased (I hope) to beare part of his burden. Both being well satisfied, CIVILIS turning to DE∣CIUS, spake to this purpose. Since you have been pleased to trouble your selfe thus farre, give me leave to disturb you a little more, and to know how long you have been in this Kingdome, and what occasions brought you out of Ireland: I doubt not but you will excuse me, knowing how particu∣lar an interest my affection gives me in every thing that concernes you; and I know MARCUS will take it for the best part of his en∣tertainment in this house, to sit and heare you. MARCUS agree∣ing to what was said for him, he sate downe by CIVILIS, and DECIUS spake as followes. You cannot desire that of me which I shall not be ready to grant you; you must know then, that at my first coming to Dublin,Decius. I found the City in great perplexity, the English not knowing which they should feare first, either the Irish without, or those within amongst themselves; they were all, as it were, at their wits ends, and no bo∣dy almost knew which way to turne himselfe: The Rebels were in∣finite for numbers, and within the City, onely a poore company of raw ignorant Townsmen, that for their number could not be thought able to conquer so often as their enemies might be overcome: Not∣withstanding all these discouragements, though I saw palenesse in every mans face, each one accounting himselfe already (as it were) amongst the dead: I observed so much courage and resolution in those that then sate at the Helme, that I for my part could not at all
feare a shipwrack; and therefore at that time could not think of quitting the Kidgdome, though I saw many take that course as the safest, hazarding themselves in a storm at Sea in open Botes, to scape that they feared on Land, if they should stay behind: Those that onely attended the service, and were carefull to discharge their du∣ties, though with the apparent danger of their lives, by sitting con∣stantly at Counsell-Board, whither multitudes of such as were then secret, and afterwards professed Rebels, daily resorted, and might (if God had not stayed their hands) have put their plot in execution for many weeks after their three and twentieth of October, as well as they could have done at that day. Those, I say, that in al that foul weather (when the Heavens were all blackk about them, and not so much as one beame of comfort to be seen) stood still to their tackling, and plyed their work, without ever giving over, were onely the two Lords Justices, by name, Sir William Parions and Sir John Bortase, and Sir Adam Lofius, Vice-treasurer; Sir John Temple, Master of the Rolls, Sir Charles Coot, from the time that he arrived at Dublin, and when he was not abroad in the Field; and Sir Robert Meredith, Chancellour of the Exchequer: Those other blazing-starres and unlucky meteors that have since hung over our heads, and have had such ill influence on all the affaires of that Kingdome, and put all into combustion, being some of them at that time not exhaled from the earth, & as lit∣tle known by name of Privy-Counsellours as they deserved it; and others, some for feare, and some for dis-affection to the service, keep∣ing themselves at home, and seldome or never comming to Counsell or having fled into England. It was the great mercy of God,Civilis. that a that time of extream ha∣zard and necessity, sent you such men as were not afraid to stand for you, and to open their mouths in your defence, when yours and their enemies fists were ready to enclose them with a blow; and tru∣ly they ought to be had in everlasting remembrance: and those that absenced themselves in that time of pressing necessity (by my consent) should have had the Counsell-chamber-doores for ever shut in their faces & I can as little excuse those that kept themselves away through feare, as those others that did it through dis-affection, it being a breach of trust in both; and he that feares even his life, when his Religion and Country cals for, and requires his help, will to save his life, or perhaps a poorer commodity, betray both. We have found what you say very true, and could have wished that they that kept themselves then away, ahd done so still, and not to have come to doe the English the greatest mischiefe instead of ser∣vice. But if you please I shall proceed.
You will doe us a speciall favour in it.Civilis. Decius. Sir Charles Coot (by a speciall providence being sent to Dublin when the English stood in so much need of a man of his spirits (was imme∣diately made Governour of that City; how he carried himselfe in that charge, and what resolution and gallantry he shewed in the field against the Rebels, with that small handfull of men which the State put under his command: If I were able to expresse to you, I might very well be thought to speak a piece of a Romanse: It shall suffice that I tell you, that by his couragious execution, and the as faithfull contrivement of those that sate at Counsell-board (the bles∣sing of God accompanying their endeavours) whereas at first for the English (with all their strength) to march out of the City as farre as Clantarfe, a place not two miles from them,The Counsell onely. was looked upon as an attempt of great hazard and danger; in a very short time we were able to seek the Rebels in their owne holds, and beat them, as I may say, on their owue Dunghils. Not long after this, the Army that was sent from hence by the Parliament, arrived safe at Dublin, which put new life and spirit into our breasts, and as much terrified the Rebels, having its more then probable, some pre-assurance, that no∣thing should be done against them heer; thinking the troubles heere, being indeed a thread of the same spinning, would have followed their needle; but they were somewhat deceived in the time, though for the matter it fell out as was designed. The affaires of the Pro∣testants began now to smile upon them, and we perceived already the glimmerings of a more glorious day then ever we saw before (so that we were brought (if not to forget our former sufferings, yet) at least not to regard them, in comparison of those happy times we saw euery day drawing nearer and nearer to us; our Armies alwayes carried victory in their Van, and in their Reare, left the Country to the peaceable possession of the English, the Rebels running continual∣ly before us; five chasing a hundred, and ten putting a thousand to flight. The resolutions of the Counsell were apparently to the good of the English, and nothing to be seen amongst them that favoured of un∣just or selfith ends: As we enjoyed the benefits of their labours and watchings, so we did our endeavours that they might be the better for our prayers, wherein we were not wanting, nor in the prayses of our God for them, and the blessing, we daily received by their means that God that had compassion on us in our low estate, and when we were truly in our blood, said unto us, Live. CIVIL IS and MARCUS being both as much affected with joy by this last part of DECIUS his Relation, as before they were with sorrow; MAR∣CUS
being not able any longer to containe himselfe, interrupted DECIUS, as be was going on, and said: When I compare the first part of your Relation with this that you are now upon,Marcus. and consider that Chaos and confusion, that dark∣nesse that was upon the face of the whole Land, and now againe, this light that was divided from that darknesse; me thinks I see the hand of God, like that of a man in it, and writing, as it did once to Belshazzar, upon the wall; but mercy instead of judgement: Not as there,Dan. 5.  42.8. Thy Kingdome is divided, and given to the Meads and Persians; but this, My glory will I not give to another, nor my prayse to graven Images. Alas Sir,Decius. this evening and morning that you have seen, make but up the first day; there are six more behind, all dayes of labour and sorrow to the English, and no Sabbath of rest from their sufferings. You have seen us, like a ship tossed and driven to and fro in a dan∣gerous storme, our masts split, our sailes blowne away, our anchors lost, and in a word, left as men without hope in the world: you have seen us againe by the skilfull conduct of our Pilots, and the good providence of our great Master in Heaven, brought within sight of a safe harbour, and now you must behold us split upon the Bars mouth and every one like Pauls Passengers, some upon boards, and some upon broken pieces of the shippe, labouring to escape safely to Land. CIVILIS desiring him to let them partake with him both of the good and had, DECIUS continued his speech as followes. The first appearance, and (as I may say) the buds that have since blossomed and growne into such bitter and uncomfortable fruits, were seen after the death of that never to be forgotten, incomparable Commander, Sir Charles Coot; a death that was attended with as much sorrow, and prosecuted with as much misery to us, as it will be remembred with glory and honour to him. Wee in these parts were not a little sensible of your great losse in a man that was every way so fitted for those times (if it had been Gods will they should be mended) and though the manner of his fall (be∣ing,vilie. as is reported, by one of his Souldiers) did encrease the sorrow of some; for my part, that circumstance did not then work a greater griefe (seeing his enemies had not that happinesse they desired) as now (upon what you have told us) it has raised a suspition in me, that there was something more then faire play in the bu∣sinesse.
If it were so,Decius. God in the end will search it out; and when all those loud cryes of the Protestant blood in Ireland shall come before him, he will not turne away his eare from this: Whether it were so or no, I am sure the party that did the deed was never questioned or exami∣ned concerning the same; and there was so good use made of his death, as may make a man beleeve he was taken out of the way; that the Mystery of that Iniquity which had a secret working in his life time, might be more fully revealed after his death: From that time every thing began to look new, and the Counsell-Board to be silled with new Counsellours; men that had laine hid before like Swal∣lowes in winter; but now like Tares (sowne by the wicked one) suddenly over-top the good Corne; so that there was to be seen an universall change in all our Counsels: as before our Counsellours looked all like Cherubims, face to face, you might see them now like Sampons Foxes, drawing severall wayes: the former being too honest, to hold their tongues and suffer things, to run on quietly in disorder; and these latter too numerous, and false to be over-ruled, from whence arose a slack and unfaithfull prosecution of the Warre, so well begun against the Rebels; the countenancing of all manner of unheard of confusions, and the oppression of the small remainder of the almost heart-broken English, and the bold and open favouring of the most bloody wretches that ever the Sun beheld. The labours of this Party and their diligence was so great, that within a short time we were reduced to our first principles, and brought, as I may say, to a worse condition (notwithstanding the large and good sup∣plies sent from hence) then we were at the very beginning of the Re∣bellion, when we had nothing almost (God knowes) to support us. The place which God of his great mercy reserved for a City of re∣fuge for the English to find safety and comfort in, was open and free to the worst of their enemies, and they that had shed and poured out like waters, so much innocent blood in the Country, had the liberty to come thither, and professe not their repentance, but their sotrow that they did no more, though indeed that lay not in their power to commit greater villanies. As long as I lived in Dublin (I meane since the command of this Party) I could never learne that ever any true hearted protestant was relieved, or had even ordinary justice done him, if the case lay be∣tween him and an Irish man, or a Papist. The affliction of my bre∣thren being so great, and the tyranny under which they lived being so insupportable, I chose (rather then be a daily witnesse of it, and in some measure a sufferer, there being none, though never so poore, that could escape free) to quit all for the present, and bid adiew to
that Kingdome, till it should please God to look upon it in mercy, and settle justice and truth in the midst of it; and this, I am sure, was the thoughts and desires of many thousands English more, whose want of accommodation elswhere keeps them in that place, and en∣forces them to live in that intolerable slavery. And thus, with what brevity I could (fearing to be troublesome) I have satisfied you concerning the occasion of my comming into this Kingdome, where I have been these three moneths, most of which time I have spent in this City. We must acknowledge our selves much bound to you for the fa∣vour you have done us,Civilis. and I hope since your comming to this place you are lightned of a good part of your burden, finding us in a con∣dition, I presume, farre beyond what you could imagine when you were in that Kingdome, and in a good way to a happy end, which will be (under God) the onely meanes to set you streight againe in that Kingdme, whereof you are yet in capability: the Earle of Or∣mond having, notwithstanding his Majesties Letters, commanding him to conclude a peace there with the Rebels on any conditions; wisely to this day held off his hand, as it is thought, from the very beginning, with an intention to give it to the Parliament. MAR∣CUS observing some confusion in DECIUS his face upon this speech, told his friend, that he feared he had spoken something distatefull, and therefore that it concerned him, before be proceeded any further, to give DECIUS satis∣faction, who he saw was suddenly moved with something that fell from him. CIVILIS thanking his friend, and desiring DECIUS to be free with him, and to set him straight, if he had failed, as he confessed he might very easi∣ly doe, being not so well acquainted with the particulars of that Kingdome: DECIUS expressing some unwillingnesse, and a kind of anger against him∣selfe, that his countenance had betrayed him, spake to this purpose. I should be very 10th CIVILIS to discent from you in any thing but on necessary grounds,Decius. especially in such a businesse as this that we are now fallen upon, which concernes a particular person, having, as you might have observed from the beginning of this Con∣ference, baulkt the mentioning of any person, as the actors in a mi∣sery, more then in the generall, knowing how subject it is (if we speak sharply, though accordin gto truth, in every particular) to the judgment and doome of passion, rancor and invectivenesse; yet fince a speciall providence has brought the Earle of Ormond and laid him crosse my way, I cannot passe him by without labouring to unde∣ceive you in the opinion you have conceived of him, and so farre am I from any private spleen or interest to draw me aside to an obliquity
in what I shall lay before you; that I protest I heartily with I could with truth give my selfe the lye in what I shall say concerning him; I perceive by that little you have said of him, how much you will wonder when I shall tell you, he has been the chiefe instrument of all the misery that at this day the Protestants of that Kingdome groane under, and the most faithfull servant to the Irish that ever they had, wherein I must say, he has done but what his blood and nature re∣quired of him; his Family having long since degenerated into Irish, and for himselfe in his owne inclination, one as much addicted to their wayes (having all his kinred and friends amongst them) as he that knowes the least either of Religion or humanity: And for that particular of keeping back the peace, I can assure you they deceive themselves very much, that the Earle of Ormond would leave any thing undone that might tend to the perfecting of that work he has alwayes so vigorously pursued: Beleeve it Sir, that the peace there was not long since concluded (though I cannot positively say it is not at this day) was not because the Earle of Ormond was unwilling to consent to whatever the Rebels could demand of him, the con∣trary plainly appearing by those Articles formerly consented unto by him, (which I doubt not you have seen in print) wherein the Re∣bels have all they can desire, both toleration of Religion, suspention of Poynings Act, and all other Lawes made for the good of the Prote∣stants: But in truth, the obstruction was still on the Rebels side, they being unwilling) however they pretended otherwise) to accept of, or adventure on a peace; knowing how little (in the condition the King was) it could availe them, but also how thereby they should be engaged to maintaine an Army here in England, whereby their owne Country might be left to the power of the Protestants (being consi∣derable in divers parts of the Kingdome;) and besides, I doe verily beleeve they were conscious to themelves of their owne inability to afford the King such considerable assistance, as (after such large con∣ditions afforded to them) they would have been strictly tyed unto, and his Majesty might expect from them: However the Earle of Or∣mond and their other friends have represented them unto him as able to doe great matters. I cannot but much wonder indeed at what you tell us concerning the Earle of Ormond;Civilis. I doe remember him here in England under the care of Abbot Archbishop of Canterbury, and (for what I could discerne in his younger yeers) there appeared in him the hopes of better per∣formances; and truly sir, I will not dissemble with you, I have heard from many that are come from Dublin, and are still in this Ci∣ty, and on whom the Parliament has bestowed some other marks of
of their favour, besides admitting of them to reside here; that he has carried himselfe from the beginning with all respect and good con∣science to the English, and as one firmly rooted and resolved in the protestant Religion. I doe not doubt but that you have met with many,Decius. who for seve∣rall ends are engaged to speak the best of him: Since my comming to this place, I happened more then once to be a witnesse of some high expressions in his behalfe, but Ile assure you Sir, they came only from such (as upon good grounds I was assured) were imployed over hither by the Earle of Ormond, to work the people into a mode∣rate good opinion of him, that so he might continue his wicked practises against the English, and that if at length the Protestant par∣ty should prevaile in both Kingdomes (when there were no other re∣medy to preserve his estate, and to be able in time to come to doe further mischiefe) he may on easier tearmes be accepted and make his peace: and I am perswaded to this beliefe of these men, not onely by the falsnesse of what ine very place they declaime, but also by the favour, I know, they are in with the Earle of Ormond, and the pro∣tection he still vouchsafes their commands, offices and interests there, notwithstanding their residing heere, on pretences; which, if true, would render them extreamly odious to him: For the matter of what they give out, to hinder a harsher judgement of him concern∣iyg his education, and his firmnesse in the Protestant Religion, I shall onely say this; that if you consider the perversnesse of the na∣tures of Irish, and more especially of such as have degenerated into them, Notwithstanding the carefullest education, it will not seem impossible to you, though the Earle of Ormond, notwithstanding his breed under Bishop Abbot, should follow his kind, and prove as no∣torious as any. The Irish of all people on the earth, are they that abhorre most to be reformed, in whose very being it is to love bar∣barisme; and though sometimes by peace, and the English dwelling amongst them, they have seemed to cast off their old skins, and put on some kind of civility upon the least occasion offered, they have run, like hogs, greedily againe to their vomits, and, like swine, have whet their tusks against such as would onely have kept them from returning to wallow in the mire; and this is the reason that five or six hundred yeers have wrought so little upon them, and that the English have reaped onely the fruit of their labours, namely, the experience (and a very sad one) how impossible a thing it is to make an unwilling Nation happy. And againe, if we look from the na∣ture of the Irish into the effects of it, and consider this unnaturall Rebellion, we shall find that none are more cruelly bent against the
English, and thirst more after their blood, then such as have the same blood, though corrupted in their vaines, and none more eager fol∣lowers of their barbarous customes, then such as have had the good fortune and misery at once to know better, and were bred up with all possible care in our Schooles and Universities, and in the Prote∣stant Religion: Nay, so farre has the corruption proceeded, that many of those Commanders that were sent from hence, have turned their backs to the English, and have been made the instruments to undoe and ruine them, for whose sakes, they were employed into that Kingdome; (as if the whole earth had the property that some of its waters have, to turne all that is cast into it, into stone.) By this time, I beleeve, it will be so farre from seeming impossible, that the Earle of Ormond should follow those courses, that it will not in any measure seem strange, since the very English themselves, who have wanted those allurements of blood and friendship, temptations which could never be out of the Earle of Ormonds sight, have been made supporters to the Irish, for whose destruction they were sent thither. For what other part concerning the E. of Ormonds religion, though there might be much said of that subject, touching the gentlenesse & moderation of it (if it were my intention to meddle wth his person) I shall only say thus much, That it was the greatest misfortune to the English, that he made profession of the same religion wth them, know∣ing very well how little he would have been able to do for his coun∣try men, had he not put on sheeps cloathing: By this meanes he was a thiefe within the house, and had the keyes committed into his hand to dispose of all at his pleasure: not to hold you long, I shall give you this short, but truest character of him. He is one whose heart has been as red in the blood of the Protestants, as any of his Country mens hands; without whom the English in that Kingdome might have been in a condition, not onely to have cleered all at home, but also to have required you here: whereas by the trechery of this man htey have been betrayed into that misery, which at this day makes them the objects of pitty in all, but such as have assisted in his cour∣ses, and resolve still to lay more and more weight upon them, till they have cast them downe, never to rise againe; which they will not faile to compasse, if God doe not speedily put to his almighty hand and make him fall into the pit which he has digged so deep for them. I have knowne you too long Decius,Civilis. to think you would say any thing but on very good grounds, especially in a businesse of this na∣ture, where the honour and life of any is concerned; for (
you Sir) if what you say be true, as upon the confidence I have in you, I shall suspend my beliefe of any thing I have heard to the con∣trary; he deserved so little the thoughts of the Parliament to accept of him, should he now at last submit to them, that were I to be one of his Judges, I should not be able to satisfie my conscience in the per∣formance of the duty I owe both to my Country and Religion, did I not give my vote to make him the severest example for after Ages, to judge the greatnesse and hainousnesse of his treason by. I desire for our better satisfaction, that you would be pleased to give us the knowledge of some particulars concerning him, that being convin∣ced our selves, we may be able upon occasion to stop the mouths of such as open them in his commendation. Seeing I shall have my share in the pleasure of your Relation,Marcus. I should in no wise deserve it, did I not adde my prayers to those of my friend Civilis, that you would be pleased to proceed in it, though I think my desires will be but superfluous; the subject (being such as concernes the good of the Publick, wherof I beleeve you suffici∣ently carefull) being argument more then enough to induce you to it: I shall rather trouble you with a request of my owne, which I know was in Civilis his mind to have remembred you of; however his impatience till he heard you speak made him omit it: But because I perceive it is contrary to your disposition, I shall be afraid to pro∣pound it to you, unlesse Civilis also make use of his power with you to perswade you to consent to it. Civilis undertaking for Decius, that he should consent to whatever was re∣sonable, whereof if they pleased, he would be judge between them. Decius and Marcus being both content to cast themselves upon him, Marcus continued. You remember Civilis (for we must speak to our judge) how not long since, you gave a wrong judgement of the Earle of Ormond, (I for my part may call it so already) and yet though the fault were yours, the blame must be Decius his; seeing his good nature (in his relation of the misery of the Protestants in Ireland) forbore to name the authors of it, which if he had done, I suppose, you Civilis, had not run into that error: now to prevent the like hereafter, my desire is, that Decius (if while he speaks of the Earle of Ormond, the occasi∣on shall draw him upon others) that he would not be sparing of their names, that we may know and mark such as have walkt disordered∣ly, and not according to a streight and just rule: This I suppose is but equall, which if Decius assent unto, he will oblige us both, if he observe it in his following relation. Civilis casting the cause upon Marcus his side (notwithstanding all that
Decius could bring to exempt himselfe from so envious a work; he having tyed himselfe to submit to what Civilis should detormine, proceeded on as followes. You may judge (by my readinesse to obey you) what power your commands have over me,Decius. seeing they unavoidably put me upon the remembrance of what I cannot think of without the greatest anger and indignation that is possible; with this encouragement however, that therein I doubt not, but before I have done, you will both bear your shares with me; and that I may observe some kind of order in what I shall say, I will begin with the confidence the Rebels from the beginning reposed in the Earle of Ormond (which were argument sufficient to prove him false) and then I shall shew you how faithful∣ly (if I may misuse that good word) he answered that trust of theirs in every particular. To prove both which, I shall not need to squeeze conclusions out of conjectures or probabilities, but shall give you the naked fact, which sufficiently discovers it selfe, and his own speeches, and the results of his owne made Counsell, from the mouths of those of his owne party, who were not ashamed to publish what they had done in the chamber upon the house top. Civilis and Marcus approving of the Division be had made, and the way he promised to take in handling of the parts, he went on in this manner. The first thing that I propounded to cleer to you, is the great trust and confidence the Rebels from the beginning reposed in him. To make good which, though there be many more then probabilities to induce a reasonable man to beleeve he was acquainted with the first designe and plot of the Rebellion, and there be some (that when time serves) can tell what advice and conncell he gave for the execution of it; having resolved with my selfe to bring nothing be∣fore you but what carries the light of the Sun along with it: I shall give you as pregnant a proofe as can be desired. In the beginning of November next after the Rebellion brake out, the Parliament, according to the prorogation, met againe at Dublin, whither many who were chief plotters and contrivers of that bloody Treason, though at that time the Castle of Dublis, by Gods great mercy, being secured, they had not declared thēselves; boldly resorted the Lords of the Pale and some others (who were all, it is well known) the first in that transgression, in whose heads the businesse was carri∣ed long before it came into the others hands) had the faces to come and sit in the upper House, to advise forsooth for the safety of the English, whom before they had voted to destruction. Amongst many other good motions, it was thought fit by the aforesaid House of
Lords, the Earle of Ormond concurring, that the Lord Costelogh Dillon should be sent to his Majesty into England, with such propositions as they thought expedient for the setling of peace againe in that King∣dome; and accordingly he was dispatched away with private Instru∣ctions, how he should carry himselfe, and what chiefly he was to in∣sist on: and though the honest party at Counsell-board (being at that time in power) had in their Letters to Court, given a large cha∣racter of the man and his errand, and expressed their dislike of both in order to his Majesties honour and the good of the Protestants; being taken prisoner here after his escape, you may perhaps have heard how he was entertained at Oxford: but it being out of our way, I passe it by. The maine of his Instructions was to work with the King, that the quieting of the Rebellion might be left wholly to the Parliament there, and that no forces might be sent over out of England to make the breach wider, instead of closing of it; and to compleat all, he was to procure the Earle of Ormond to be made Lord Licutenant of Ireland. Behold Sirs, the same men that would have no assistance from hence, without which the English (in all humain probability) would have perished, as the next thing they thought could worke to the Rebels advantage, sue that the Earle of Or∣mond might be made Governour: And least the name of a Parlia∣ment held at Dublin may stumble you, and make you beleeve these Lords were honest at that time, and at the drawing of those Instru∣ctions had not engaged themselves to the Rebels party: You must know (after their going into Rebellion) they still owned the Lord Dillon as their Agent, and it was ordered at a full Counsell of the Rebels at Kilkenny, that the profits of the said Lord Dillons Lands should be secured to him, forasmuch as he was employed to his Ma∣jesty by them, for the good of the Catholick Cause. Truly Decius,Civilis. I think you have put your best strength in the Van, for I cannot see what could prove your first poynt more cleerly, and in the last place, you have fully answered an objection I was then going to propound to you; that order of the Counsell of Kilkenny cuts on both sides, and like Janus his face, looks two severall wayes. But I wrong my friend Marcus, I pray you therefore say on. In January 1642.Decius. when the Rebels were now a formed body, and licked into a State, upon a Petition of the chiefe Lords and Gentle∣men of the Rebels sent to the Earle of Ormond, and by him kindly transmitted to his Majesty, his Majesty did by his Letters, sent by Master Thomas Bourke, an arch-papist and a chiefe Rebell, require the Lords Justices to give power to the said Earle to give a meeting to the chiefest of the Rebels, and to send to his Majesty such grievances
and desires as they should think fit to present to him by his Lordships hands. Amongst many other grievances and other goodly demands which, no doubt, you have seen in print (though they were kept dose from the Justices and Counsell by the Earle of Ormond) for ma∣ny moneths after, they were published by the Rebels in forraigne Kingdomes; and when the Book was commonly sold amongst us, it was not suffered to be answered, but all motions made to that purpose in Parliament, slighted by Sir Morice Eustace, Speaker of the House of Commons there, an Irish man (to say no worse of him, and one of the Earle of Ormonds Cabinet counsell.) Amongst many other, I say, strange desires, at that time, transmitted by the Earle of Ormond to his Majesty, one was this;The Rebels Remonstrance at Trym. That his Maje∣sty would be pleased to grant that they might be governed by one of their owne Nation, a man of estate and repute amongst them.] This you may easily perceive was the same with the former, contained in the Lord Dillons Instructiions, though (his Majesty being sufficiently already acquain∣ted with their meaning, and perhaps the Earle of Ormond himselfe) the English being now more formidable, was not willing to be named as before, but his name was left to be understood. Upon these de∣sires of the Rebels, no doubt the Earle of Ormond (from the very be∣ginning) had strong assurances of being made Lord Lieutenant, and that the Earle of Leicester should not stand in his way, who was pur∣posely long detained at Court; and having at length obtained his dispatch, and being as farre as Chester on his way, was unexpectedly recalled; and the carriage of the Earle of Ormond towards the Earle of Leceister, and those that belonged to him, is argument enough to prove, that he well knew he should never come to any super-inten∣dency over him, to overlook or check his proceedings. I doe make haste from this first poynt, because the next is that that will hold me longer; and by this that you have already heard, you may easily judge of the truth of what I promised in the first place to prove to you, namely, the considence the Rebels had in him, which I may boldly sweare, they never intended should prove for the good of the English. It remaines, that I declare to you, how he has not failed in poynt of gratitude to the Irish that relyed so much upon him: This gene∣rall head will fall into sundry particular Treasons and misdemea∣nours, altogether tending to this onely end, namely, to save and protect his beloved Country-men from the just revengefull armes of the English; (and that he might compasse that) to bring the English into that condition, that they might not be able to prosecute a war, but he glad to accept of such termes of cessation or peace, as he and
the Rebels (I am forced for distinction sake to sever them) should be pleased to afford them; and when there should be now no more use of the Army in Ireland, to bring them (with the Rebels, who from the beginning still boasted they would come over into England) to turne their swords against the Parliament here, that had imployed, payed and entrusted them: And here Sirs, I doubt not but to make it ap∣peare to you, that the necessity (we here so much talk of) was so farre from being a cause of that bloody cessation, that the Earle of Ormonds designe to secure his Country-men by that cessation was the onely cause of that necessity; which (notwithstanding all his pernicious endeavours to bring it upon us) was not, by Gods mercy, so great, but that the Army might very well have subsisted, and that the world might see through it, that the safety of the Protestants was onely pretended by him, when nothing but utter ruine was really intended. There was nothing had that power over me,Marcus. to perswade me to a charitable opinion of that cessation, as the word Necessity; and (to confeste ingeniously to you) I could not tell what to say, when in the Kings Declaration touching that businesse, I found necessity so much complained of in the Letters from your owne Counsell, which I thought they would not have done if it had been onely fictitious, and not reall. Truly Marcus you have prevented me,Civilis. for I was just then thinking of the same thing; those Letters having (in many mens apprehensi∣ons) done that work to the full, for which they were inserted in that Declaration, which was the justification of the proceedings in that cessation. I shall anon acquaint you at lage with the occasion of those Let∣ters,Decius. onely for the present to remove them somewhat out of our way (in generall) I shall tell you, that part of them wch expressed the dispairing condition of the state, was written alwayes, as you shall plainly see by and by, by reason of the Earle of Ormonds violent stick∣ling for it, and by the over-ruling vote of his complices at the Board, and contrary to the opinion and advice of the honest Party who knew the contary, and that the Army might very well have subsisted by the meanes even of those small supplies sent from hence; yea though they had been lesse, had not the Earle of Ormond used all the art and power he could to prevent and hinder it: This Sirs, since I am first fallen upon it, I shall labour to cleere unto you. Civilis and Marcus expressing their desire to be informed by him, be conti∣nued his speech as followes.
The first and best meanes that could be used to bring the Army to necessity and want, was to keep it idle at home in our own quarters; The Earle of Ormond had heard of that maxime, nihil difficilius est quam exercitum otiosum alere; and therefore having the sole command of the Army, he alwayes kept it in, and about the City of Dublin, a place thirty or forty miles most wayes from any considerable enemy; so that there was at all times five or six thousand men fed upon the publick stores of that place, who might have been sent abroad and lived in the enemies Country; and there were sometimes eight or nine thousand men maintained out of the Magazine at Dublin, and most commonly there was victuals delivered out for more men by one third part, then were really to be found in the Towne; and not∣withstanding all that the honest party (at Counsell-board) could doe, his Lordship would never be brought to take a view of the Ar∣my to discover the true strength of it; but when (upon the impor∣tunity of the honest Privy Counsellours) the men were once carried into the Field to take the right number of them, he found out an oc∣casion to dismisse them, and also the businesse was disappointed; though (which is observable) when upon the cessation he saw the English would expect that the Army should be supplied by the con∣tribution of the Rebels (which the Earle of Ormond had talkt much of, to induce the English to consent to that cessation;) he of himself could then give strict order therein, that the Rebels might not be burdened above what was necessary in the least measure. This particular of keeping so many men continually in Dublin,Civilis. I conceive is that which cannot be answered, if there were any possibi∣lity of maintaining them abroad to doe service against the Rebels: I desire therefore to be satisfied in that poynt which is all that can be thought of to justifie that action. Your desire is indeed very materiall,Decius. but I shall easily satisfie you in it; for you must know, the Earle of Ormond did this, not onely contrary to many Remonstrances of the honest party at Counsell-Board (declaring the evill consequences thereof) but also to the overtures and motions of severall Commanders in the Army, who undertook to maintaine the Army abroad, and make them subsist upon the Rebels, if the Earle of Ormond would suffer it:Sir Arthur Loftus his Ex∣amination. Sir Arthur Loftus Governour of the Naas, undertook to maintaine there a thou∣sand men, without charge to the State, if the Earle of Ormond would also send him two or three Troops of horse which lay idle about Dublin:Sir Charles Coot his Exa∣mination. Sir Charles Coote long solicited the Earle of Ormond for a thousand Foot and two or three Troops to carry into Conogh, where he undertook to maintaine them upon the Rebels during the Warre.
And many the like propositions were made by others, but the Earle of Ormond knew too well how much it would have prejudiced his Country-men and his designe, to save them by a peace or cessation, to consent to any of them; but they were all slighted by him, and not∣withstanding he had still the face to complaine of the necessity of the Army, & to the great disturbance of all debates at Counsel-board for the good of the English, and the promoting of the Service, to presse and cry continually for Letters to be writ to his Majesty; declaring their lamentable condition, and how they were not possibly able to subsist, no not for a few dayes, whereby the Officers and Soulders were encouraged to all manner of mutinous disorders, being most of them already wrought to a wearinesse of the service, and to a desire to come into England to gaine the spoile of the same, whereof his Lordship and his instruments had given them assurance. The Lord Lisle being sensible of the Earl of Ormonds proceedings, and how he laboured all that he could on pretence of necessity, to gaine for the Rebels what they desired, to the ruine of the English; to wipe away that colour of necessity, and that it might cleerly ap∣peare where the fault lay, that the Protestants were not in a better condition, undertook about January 1642. a designe for the carrying out a great part of our Army to live abroad in the Country, and doe good service against the Rebels; the proposition (as it deserved) was much magnified by all, being so much for the good of the Eng∣lish, that indeed it was the onely meanes for their preservation: The Earle of Ormond upon the Lords Justices and honest Privy-Counsel∣lours motion, gave consent unto it; whereupon all things were pre∣pared, Iron Mils and other necessaries, not without great charge, were provided, and all things being now in a readinesse for the Lord Lisle to march: The Earle of Ormond (fore-seeing how much this would ruine his plot, and fearing that he intended for the County of Kilkenny, a place which he alwayes kept untouched, being the chiefe seat of the Rebellion, where their supreame Counsell resided) declared, he would goe out himselfe in person, and (contrary to the will of the Justices, and the advice of the honest party at Counsell-Board, saying, he had power of himselfe without them, to carry out the Army when and whither he pleased) he overthrew the Lord Lisles motion, having no other designe then to thwart his, which looked too severely (he thought) upon the Rebels his beloved Country-men: Sometimes he declared he would goe into the Coun∣ty of Wesimeath, other times into the County of Longford, but at length (having taken new Counsels, and caused the State to furnish him with a treble proportion of mony to what the Lord Lisle desired
for his expedition, which the Parliament Commissioners then at Dublin were forced to take up in that necessity upon their own word, otherwise he and some of his Minions of the Counsell of warre, pro∣testing they were the cause of the disappointment of that so impor∣tant a service, and having upon his owne motion a generall War∣rant granted him from the Lords Justices, to command all the ship∣ing upon the coast of the whole Kingdome, a thing which before was never given out of the hands of the chiefe Governour for the time, and having a Warrant likewise for the putting of the whole Country, where-ever he came, to contribution; and full power gi∣ven him to protect them, otherwise saying, he could not be able to keepe the Army abroad, as he pretended he would doe, for three moneths; he marched out of Dublin with about 4000. foot, and four or five hundred horse. In their martch through the County of Kildare, they took in three or four Castles, namely, Timelin, Tullow and Castle-Martin, and there∣in such quantities of corne, as would have been sufficient to have fed the Army three moneths; but the Earl of Ormond suffered it to be con∣sumed and wasted, and no use made of it to their benefit: That which was taken in Timelin, was left most of it in the same condition it was found: and after the Earle of Ormond was martched away, the Rebels came and possessed themselves againe of it, which will be made good by Colonel Monk and by the parties that surveyed the corne in those Castles: By which it may appeare, he never had any intention to maintaine the Army abroad, or that he took those places to any other end, then to waste the ammunition and provision which he carried out with him, and which (he knew) was all the store: Castle Martin, and some other places taken by him, being not long after sold, and delivered up to the Rebels, and that at very low rates: Castle Martin was sold to the Rebels by Colonel Hunkes, whose com∣pany had the possession of it, and no notice taken of it by the Earle of Ormond in publick; but what thanks he gave in private for it, we may guesse (presuming it was done by his owne order.) I cannot but admire (Decius) at what you have told me,Civilis. seeing how much hitherto the Earl of Ormonds carriage disagrees from those expressions I have heard some give of him, upon whom hereafter I shall looke as enemies to the Common-wealth, and as such as deserve to partake in the severest of his punishments; and truly (by what I have already heard from you, and some other Relations which I have received of the carriage of the Earle of Thomond and some others in Munster) I begin plainly to understand the vanity of imploying any of the Irish in considerable command in that service,
if we ever intend to have the work carried on throughly and faithful∣ly, and not partially and by halves. I have ever in my owne thoughts embraced that opinion as the most certaine and safest vvay for the English,Decius. and indeed suppo∣sing there were such of that Nation as could so farre overcome their owne natures, as willingly to undertake so contrary a work, I sup∣posed it a poynt of cruelty in man (if there were no more in it) to put humain nature to so hard a taske, as to embrue his hands in the blood of those neerest to him, which was thought by God a suffici∣ent tryall even for such a faith as Abrahams: But besides this, I ever esteemed it a poynt of the greatest indiscretion, to expose the English to the mercy of so many temptations as daily beset such men, and it being a certaine rule, that no man ever hated his owne flesh, though some would be beleeved, to have attained to that perfection; but if you please to give me leave, I shall begin where I left off in my Re∣lation. Civilis praying him to doe so, be continued his speech in this manner. After the taking of those Castles (as you have heard) the Earle of Ormond carried the Army before the Towne of Rose, through a coun∣try which he knew could afford them nothing but streights and wants, whereas if he had gone ten miles on the other hand into an open Country, he might have been in the heart of a place untouched by any enemy, where the Army might have subsisted upon the Rebels as long as they pleased; but the Earle of Ormond had not for that end preserved that Country from spoyle, to be now wasted; And where∣as before the Earle of Ormonds advance towards Rosse, the Rebels might have been at a losse, not knowing which way our Forces would bend, being equally neer Kilkenny, Wexford and Rosse, to cleer them of that doubt, and to free them from the danger of a surprize, which (if the whole Army' or a party of Foot, with some Horse, had speedily martched up to either of those places) might easily have been performed: He commanded the Lord Lisle with some Horse, without either Foot or Dragoons, to martch before to Rosse, which gave the Country an allarum, and the body of Foot came up so slowly after, that the Towne had time to prepare it selfe, and to take in more Forces; whereas if there had been Foot sent up with the Horse, it might without all question have been taken; they within being so secure, that some of the Lord Lisles Horse at their first com∣ing found the gates wide open, whereat they entred, but for want of Voot to make it good, they were forced to retire. When the Earle of Ormond supposed the Rebels were prepared to
receive him, the Army was brought before the Towne (though he had prepared nothing fit for a siege, and that it was contrary to the intention of the State, that he should engage before any place of that strength, till they had first beaten the Rebels out of the field, being sent abroad meerly to live and maintaine themselves, which could not but be knowne impossible, lying in the midst of an enemies Country before a Towne, the Rebels having a strong Army on foot to cut off all provision, and forrage as they pleased. You may remember I told you before, how that the Earle of Ormond, before he would stirre out of Dublin, must have the command of all the shiping on the coast of the Kingdome, and (to make some good use of this power (he cals up two ships that lay neer the Fort of Duncannon, and on pretence to hinder supplies from coming to the Towne over the River from Munster side, they were commanded by him into such a place, that they were both taken, to the great losse of the owners, and the encouragement of his Country-men; and having, with the expence almost of all his ammunition, made a breach in the wall, wide enough for twenty men to enter a brest, having thereby let the world see what he could have done, he rises from before it, and sets his face homewards towards Dublin, and in his way brings the Ar∣my upon the Rebels Forces, commanded be Preston add Cullin; where if Gods mercy had not overcome his wickednesse, the losse of those men had been in humain reason the ruine of the English through the whole Kingdome. The Rebels, contrary to their usuall manner (being spurred on with other assurances then they could receive from their owne cowardly dispositions) at this time charged very resolutely, on our side the Earle of Ormond gave out no orders for the ordering or managing of the battle, but rid up and downe carelesly with one Colonel Barry an Irish Papist, and one very well knowne by the Rebels, as if he had not been conterned in the businesse in hand: by which meanes for want of direction, the Rebels had at first gotten advantage over us, which the Earle of Ormond had a speciall care to impute to such as he knew most forward and zealous against his Country-men, and particularly to the Lord Lisle, who in truth behaved himself: that day very gallantly, to his great honour and the advantage of the service. It pleased God, notwithstanding all the Earle of Ormonds wishes and endeavours, to give the English the day, with the losse of many of the Rebels Gentry, and divers taken prisoners, amongst whom was Cullin, their Lieutenant generall, and some more of their princi∣pall Officers, who were brought to Dublin in such state, that one
would have thought they had rid in triumph after their owne victo∣ry, and not been prisoners of ours: And when the honest party at Counsell-board spoke of committing them as Traytors, the Earle of Ormond took it very hainously, and said, he would be bound for them himselfe, and the Lord Chancellour one Sir Richard Bolton, a rotten-hearted man, and one of the Earle of Ormonds honest instru∣ments on all occasions, desired it might be considered how the King used the Parliament prisoners here, that so they might follow that president; to which the Earle of Ormond added, that they in England were as great Rebels as those in Ireland, though Sir Henry Tich∣borne (another faithfull Gentleman, whom we shall have occasion anon to mention more at large) upon another occasion went a note higher, and would prove the Parliament here the worse Rebels of the two, for these (said he, meaning the Rebels) fight for the substance of their Religion, but the Parliament meerly for cere∣monies. It pleased GOD to bestow upon the FORCES of the Prote∣stants there,Marcus. very many admirable Victories, and neverthelesse (which seemed very strange to us, not knowing to what cause to im∣pute it) the affaires of the English were (so far as I could understand) still in the same condition, and not in any degree bettered, or neerer to an end. You say very true Sir,Decius. for though God had put many happy op∣portunities into our hands, there was never any use made of any of them, but our Armies having beaten the Rebels abroad, were pre∣sently brought home to feed upon, and indeed devoure our selves at home: I know Sirs, you expect a fter this last victory to heare of a pursuit, but the E. of Ormond had a care not to break his old custome; whereas if he had pursued this defeat, as a Generall ought, and an honest man would have done, he might have gone either back againe to Rosse or to Kilkenny, and had either or both delivered unto him, or at least he might have commanded the open field, and maintained the Army upon the country without danger as long as he pleased: The Lord Esmond (after the battle) offering to bring the Army into the old English Baronies neer Wexford, a place plentifully stored with corne and cattle, and all manner of provision for them to subsist on: The motion was rejected by the Earle of Ormond, and as if he had undertaken this, as a journey onely to visit some friends, within a little more then three weeks he returnes to Dublin; the money he re∣ceived for this expedition (besides what he had in provision) being sufficient to have fed that proportion of men in Towne for three moneths; and least the honest party at counsell-board might have
disposed otherwise of those Forces, he never gave the State notice of his intentions till the Army was far advanced into our owne Quar∣ters, and were come within some few miles of the City, and then he writ, that he could not keep the men abroad any longer unlesse he had provisions sent to him, but never stayed for an answer; so that before what provisions were to be gotten could be dispatched away to him, he was come with the men to the Town's end; and this he did when he knew there was not three dayes subsistence for them in the stores, but they were all billeted upon the City; of which burden the Irish Papists had the least share: by the Earle of Ormonds Order many able Irish in and about the City being wholly spared, and their load laid upon the shoulders of the poore English families, who had hardly bread for their owne mouths, but they must be brought to the extreamest misery that was possible, that they might be the better fitted and prepared willingly to accept of whatsoever he should be pleased to doe with them: and notwithstanding all this, none seem∣ed more sensible of the misery of the English then himselfe: the burden of his song was continually, Necessity, Necessity, that the Parliament had utterly forsaken us, and converted the money raised for us to their owne uses, and that it behooved us to provide what way we could for our owne safeties, since it was impossible any longer to hold out a warre: All his work at Counsell-board was, to cry like the two daughters of the Horse leech, Give, Give, and to presse the Counsell to write dispairing Letters to his Majesty, that so his Majesty might have grounds to command him to conclude a Cessation (as his Ma∣jesty has since made use of those Letters to justifie himselfe therein (as you Marcus observed very righty in the beginning.) I had almost forgot one passage which fals in with this place, and may be worth your hearing. The Lord Lisle having notice (after the Battle) that one of our Souldiers (being taken by the Rebels upon quarter) was afterwards in cold blood hanged by them, desired the Earle of Ormond (to terrifie them from committing the like villany upon the rest, if peradventure they had or should have any more in their hands) that some of their men taken by us at that time, might be used in the same manner: To which the Earle of Ormond scorn∣fully replyed, that if they were barbarours, he would not be barba∣rous too: Upon this confidence that the Rebels had in the Earle of Ormond (though there were many more prisoners of theirs in our power, then they had of ours, which might have made them hold their hands) they never failed to execute the worst of their cruelties, Captaine Bret taken by the Rebels, after quarter given, was in cold blood shot to death by them; Captaine Chambers, taken neer Carelowe
upon quarter, was afterwards delivered by Preston to one Harpoole at Kilkenny, and by him most barbarously murdered; one young Cor∣net to the Lord Lisle taken neer Dublin (after long imprisonment) was afterwards hanged; Captaine Treswell (who commanded the Lord Lisles Troop) petitioned the Earle of Ormond for reparation for Young, and an examination upon oath concerning Captaine Cham∣bers, of the inhumain cruelties executed upon him, was presented to the Earle of Ormond and he moved to require satisfaction, but his Lordship was angry, and nothing was done in either; and yet though his Lordship were so much out of love with that barbarous vertue of justice, he delighted as much on the other side in mercy, and therefore when there was a plot discovered, that a whole company of Irish men conspired together to runne from their Garrison at Rings End to the Rebels, and but one of them was picked out to suffer for example (the Earle of Ormond being unwilling that any one should dye for so good a work, whilest he had power to hinder it,) he was reprieved by him, and afterwards saved, and an Irish Cutler in Dublin being condemned for furnishing the Rebels with armes, was by the Earle of Ormonds earnest solicitation afterwards acquit∣ted; and there are so many other particular instances of his affection to spare his Country-men, that (having so many things to acquaint you with after this taste that I have already given you) to repeat them would be as unnecessary as tedious to you. After this that you have already told us,Civilis. I doe not see what can be further added to make his disaffection and naughtinesse more evi∣dent, you have given us in this one businesse of the disappointment of the Lord Lisles proposition, and the Earle of Ormonds pursuit of it; so compleat a series and chain of mischief, that I cannot tell how you will be able to adde one link to it. What you have heard,Decius. is but a piece of one Act, one scene onely of that Tragedy which to this day is ours, but in the end (I doubt not) but will prove the authors, if our sinnes doe not keep back his punishment. Notwithstanding these and many such like carriages of the Earle of Ormond, and what might have been apprehended by the Parlia∣ment, of greatest disaffection in them; such was their zeale to the ser∣vice of Ireland, and their preservation of the remaining English there, and so much care did they expresse therin, as in the very height of the distempers of this Kingdome, when all was little enough for them∣selves, and though they saw how much of the provisions made for Ireland was intercepted in its way thither (as at Chester and other places) they continued still doing good to us, and furnished us,
though not so plentifully as was desired, yet (considering their condition) in such measure, as we had no cause to complaine of them, or despaire of our selves; if there had been that use made of those supplies as might have been, had not the Earle of Ormond hin∣dred it, who (by this goodnesse of the Parliament towards the Pro∣testants) was so farre from being raisen to the least joy or thankful∣nesse, that it was the griefe of his soule, that (by shewing any care of us) they put back the work he had in hand to our ruine; and therefore he used all meanes that could be invented to waste and squander away what we received from them, and so to disoblige them, that for the future they might be drawne to desist from send∣ing any more money or provisions to an army they saw so adverse to them. About the beginning of July 1643. Captaine Thomas Bartlet was sent into Ireland with his Ship laden with corne and other provisi∣ous, and another Ship stored with three hundred barrels of powder and a great proportion of match; both which arrived at Dublin about two moneths before the cessation; at which time the Earle of Ormond thought the English were reduced to such necessity, that it was impossible for them to subsist without the cessation; but by the arrivall of this supply, finding himselfe disappointed, he was not a little troubled, but he soon found out a way to piece his work up againe; and to empty the stores once more (as he had done often be∣fore to as little purpose) he pretends a journey in all haste towards Castle Jordon, and thereupon hurries up to Dublin most of the For∣ces that were garrisoned in Drogheda, alias, Tredagh, Trym and Don∣dalke, where they remained feeding upon the stores of that place ma∣ny dayes before his Lordship could be ready to martch out; and having at length sent out the Lord Lambert before him with a party of the Army (who either through the Earle of Ormonds command or his owne cowardize, durst not advance further then twelve miles from the City, but kept his men there, feeding upon what they car∣ried abroad with them;) he himselfe at last martched out to him, his whole strength consisting of about five thousand, besides Horse and a great traine of Artillery; and having kept the men abroad till they had consumed their provision, he brought them home againe, without doing any manner of service against the Rebels, onely he took in an ordinary dwelling house, unfortified, possessed by some fevv of the Rebels: yet before his Lordship could be ready to martch out and doe these brave exploits, all the money that could be raked from the Excise, and what could be torne from the poor English, and almost all the provision that Captaine Bartlet had brought in was
consumed; and of what remained, part was privately sold to seve∣rall Bakers and others in the City of Dublin, and part concealed and removed into private Granaries till after the cessation, that it might not appeare to hinder it,Sir Philip Per∣civel was Com¦missary of the Victuals in Ireland at that time. Sir Philip Per∣civel was im∣ployed as Clarke or Se∣cretary to write all the passages at the making of the cessation on the Lord of Ormonds part. and then some of it was sold, and the mo∣ney converted to private uses, and the rest, instead of being usefull to send out the Army to fight against the Rebels, was made into Bisquet, to victuall the Regiments sent into England (to fight against the Parliament) in Captaine Weaks Ships: The wayes the Earle of Ormond took to consume our provisions to no purpose, were so many and so apparent, that the Parliament Commissioners then at Dublin were bold to tell him plainly, That were the Parliament Masters of the wealth of the Indies, as things were carried there, it would be all spent, and yet the English not any thing the better for it. By this taste that I have already given you, you may see how he laboured all that he could to consume what was sent from hence, or to dispose of it so, that it might not stand in the way between him and his de∣signe, for the preservation of his Country-men, by necessitating the English to accept of his cessation or peace. The next thing which I shall labour to cleere to you, is the course the Earle of Ormond took to alienate the Parliament of England from sending any more supplies to us, knowing to how little purpose it would be, to dry up the water in the streames, unlesse he could stop it at the spring-head: But I beleeve this will be a work to overcome your patience, having (I presume) wearied it alrerdy. Civilis and Marcus protesting they received the greatest contentment and satisfaction in hearing of him, he went on in this manner. The Earle of Ormond having been very succesfull in the first part of his game, and drawne us to the bottome, bethinks himselfe at the same time, how to free himselfe of the Parliament, whom he found more forward to assist us, then would stand with the work he had in hand, and therefore labours to disoblige them so, that the English being left wholly to themselves, he might the easier make his hand of them. From hence arose those many reviling speeches utte∣red by himselfe and his instruments upon all occasions against this Parliament and Kingdome: himselfe alwayes having a speciall care not onely to equall them with his Country-men, but to put the Par∣liament above them (as if the Rebellion and Massacre there were a businesse to be excused in comparison of their proceedings here) say∣ing, that those fought onely (at the worst) against his Majesties sub∣jects, but these against his person, and that the Parliament here was the cause of all the misery of that Kingdom; and therefore in the pre∣ample
