THE Protestant's Companion: OR, AN IMPARTIAL SURVEY AND COMPARISON OF THE Protestant Religion, As by LAW Established; With the main Doctrines of Popery: Wherein is shewn, That Popery is contrary to Scripture, Primitive Fathers and Councils; and that proved from Holy Writ, the Writings of the Ancient Fathers for several Hundred Years, and the Confession of the most Learned Papists themselves. Whereby the Papists vain pretence to Antiquity, and their reproaching the Protestant Doctrines with Novelty, is wholly overthrown.

THE PREFACE TO THE Protestant Reader. AS we have immortal Souls of infinite more value than all transient glories and sub∣lunary advantages; so ought we both in obedience to the tender and compassionate advice of our blessed Redeemer (who purchased them with his own dear Blood,) and out of a true concern for our Eternal Welfare, to live such lives here as we may be happy hereafter. Pur∣suant to this excellent design, We
ought carefully attend to that Holy Religion we have so long professed, which teaches no Doctrines that are not agreeable to the Holy Scriptures, and to the practice of the best and purest Ages of Christianity. A Religion, which neither robs God of his Honour, nor the King of his due; a Religion, whose venerable Rites keep a just medium betwixt vain Popish Pomp, and Fanatical In∣decency; a Religion that not only teaches us how to be good, but obliges us so to be, that is, a Reli∣gion truly Christian, and a Copy of that perfect Original which our Lord and Saviour hath left us for our direction. And therefore as no∣thing ought to be dearer to us; so we cannot be sufficiently thankful to his Sacred Majesty (whom God pre∣serve) for the Gracious assurance he
has given, that he will support it, and defend us in the profession of it. A King whose Royal Progenitors of Immortal Memory for above 100 years, have not only been the Orna∣ments but the Supports too of the Protestant Religion; His fam'd Grandfather King Iames Learnedly defending it by his Pen, and thereby justly meriting the glorious Title of its Defender; His Excellent For so doth Mons. Militere, in his Epistle to His late Majesty, confess. Fa∣ther dying a Glorious Martyr, and his late dearly beloved Brother being a long time Exile for our Reformed Religion. Let us then strive to shew that we are not unworthy of so Illustrious and Valiant a Protector, by our Loyalty to him; not un∣worthy of such a Religion, by our conformity to its Principles, in Ho∣liness, Sobriety and Charity, and a stedfast adherence to it, in opposi∣tion
to any other that will destroy that which our Church hath built upon so sure a Foundation. And that we may rightly understand what this Religion is, and the difference betwixt that which is established in our Church, and what is owned in the Church of Rome, I have made the following Collection; wherein is demonstrated how contrary the Po∣pish Religion is to our Church, and how inconsistent with Scripture, the practice of the Primitive and best Ages of Christianity, and that prov'd, not only from the Writings of the Apostles, and choice Records of Antiquity, but even granted to be so by the most Vives de Instrumentis probab▪ learned and no less impartial Papists themselves; which as it is the testimony of one Friend against another, is lookt up∣on as an undenyable Evidence.
Before I conclude, I must admo∣nish the Reader, that I have not rendered the Authors at large, but so quoted them, that the Learned may examine them, nor have I drawn Arguments (as usually) from them, because that would have made this Book (design'd for a Pocket∣companion) to have swell'd into a great Volume; yet to make re∣quital for that just omission, I have, at the conclusion of each Section, directed the Reader to o∣ther Writers of our Religion, which treat of that particular Controversie at large. May then the All-wise God, by whose Divine permission thus much hath been perform'd, so bless this poor labour of his unworthy Servant, that
it may be instrumental to the good of his Church, and the confirming of all our weak Brethren in our most Holy Faith; which was the principal design of its publication.
THE INTRODUCTION. THE Church of Rome, though she talk aloud of the Antiquity of, and an uni∣versal consent in her Doctrines, is so far from either, That therein she will be tied to no Rule, nor observe any Law, as if she would verifie that Remarque of Crantzius Metropol. 7. 45. Crantzius upon her in another Case, Nunc ad se omnium Ecclesiarum jura traxit Romana Eccle∣sia, That she hath engrossed to her self all the privi∣ledges or rights of other Churches. Her greatest Bellarmin de verbo dei, l. 4. c. 4.—Pighi∣us Eccles. Hie∣rarch. l. 3. c. 3. Pool de prima∣tu Romanae Ec∣clesiae, fol. 92. defendants reject the Scripture, though given forth by 2 Tim. 3. 16. Divine Inspiration, and do say it is no more to be believed, in saying it is from God, than Ma∣homet's Alcoran, &c. And good reason why, Concil. de stabilienda Rom. sede, p. 6. because her Doctrines are repugnant to the Holy Scri∣ptures. What then will she trust to? Tradition: that she equals with Concil. Trident. Sess. 4. decret. 1. the Scriptures themselves. And yet her great Annalist, Cardinal Baronius, who was once, as it were, a living Library, while he kept the Vatican Dr Iames his Corrupti∣on of the Fa∣thers, Part 4. p. 26. Anno 44. Sect. 42. confesseth, That he despaired to find out the truth even in those matters which true Writers have recorded: because there was nothing which remained sincere and incorrupted. This blow
given by so skilful an Artist, dashes all the Characters wherein the defence of Oral Tradition should be legi∣ble. And, if Tradition in true Writers be so diffi∣cult to preserve, how can it be expected to be safe from spurious ones, or without any Writers at all? However, though the Papists do not grant, that this ruins their Tradition, I am sure, it cuts off that definition of it, by Bellar. de Tradit. cap. 9. Cardinal Bellarmin, who af∣firms, that to be a true Tradition which all former Doctors (mind that! or then will the Fathers come in for a share) have successively in their Ages acknowledged to come from the Apostles, and by their Doctrine or Practices have approved, and which the Universal Church owns as such. Moreover Bellarmin's Definition of Tradition gives us this encouragement and liberty to try Anti∣quity by Fathers, Councils and Papal Decrees. For the Fathers, I hope, the Romanists, who boast so much of their being on their party, will not refuse to be try'd by them, when Coster En∣chirid. Con∣trovers. cap. 2. Constat mani∣feste, &c. Cam∣pian rat. 3 Se∣culis omnino quindecim, &c. & rat. 10. Te∣stes resomnes. Coster and o∣thers make such a fine flourish in their pretensions to Antiquity. No, the Fathers shall not be Iudges of the Papists: the Romanists will not be controlled by the Fathers. For Cardinal Baronius ad  34. Baronius saith, The Catholick Church (and this they would have you to believe, is their own Church; but against all Reason and Sense) doth not in all things follow the interpretation of the Fathers. This is a fair but modest Confession. But Cardinal Bellarmin de Concil. au∣torit. l. 2 c. 12. Sect. Re∣spondeo. Bellarmin goes further, The Writings of the Fathers (saith he) are not rules to us, nor have the Authority to bind us. This is an How the Papists con∣temn and condemn the Fathers, See Dr. Iames's Corruption of the Fathers, part 4. home thrust: and yet Salmeron in Ep. ad Rom. cap. 5. disp. 51. p. 468. Salmeron
is more incivil with those Ancient Doctors, when he saith, That the latter Doctors are sharper-sighted than they, and therefore pronounces of many of them at once, That we must not follow a multitude to deviate from the Truth. I am afraid he gave his own Church a rude blow there; for we may turn that Argument of his against the Church of Rome, which ever and anon is pleading her great number of Professors. To which let us add, what another Romanist saith in this point. And Corn. Muss. Episc. Bitont. in Rom. 14. p. 468. he tells you, That he believes the Pope in matters of Faith, before a thousand Augu∣stines, Jeroms or Gregories. This indeed is plain dealing, and no mincing of the matter! But then again it is wholly opposite to their vain Pleas for Antiquity, and wholly different from the modest procedure of Apolog. adv. Rufin. l. 2. p. 219. tom. 2. S. Jerome, who thinks it great rashness and irreverence, presently to charge the Antients with heresie for a few obnoxious terms; since, when they erred, they erred perhaps with a simple and honest mind, or wrote things in another sense than they were (afterwards) taken. But, if this be all the esteem the Papists have for the Ancient Doctors, then adieu to the Authority of the Fathers in the Church of Rome. Moreover, even the Councils fare no better in the Papists hands: For it is usual in their Editions of the Councils, to have some printed with this Title, Reprobatum (or disallowed) others Ex parte Ap∣probatum, Vid. Bin. not. ad 2. Con∣cil. Constant. tom. 1. part. 1. p. 541. Item not. ad Concil. Chalced. tom. 2. par. 1. p. 410. accordingly as they agree or disagree with their Opinions and Interest at Rome. Which verifies that Lud. Vives in Aug. de civit. Dei, l. 20. c. 36. smart censure of Ludovicus Vives, That those are accounted Decrees and Councils,
which make for their purpose, and all others are no more valued by them than the meetings of some tatling Women in a Weaving Shop, or at the Baths. But although they reject both Fathers and Councils, (when they are pressed by the Protestants with their Authorities) yet, to take away all testimonies of the Fathers from us, the politick Council of Trent set up their Indices Expurgatorii, which they referred to Pope Pius IV. whose Bull for that end bore date March 24. 1564. See Dr. Iumes's Cor∣ruption of the Scriptures, Fathers and Councils, Printed 1611. Part 4. And in these Tables they set down, what Books were by them forbidden, and in which to be purged, and what places ought to be left out. Thus design'd they, that both Fathers and Councils should lisp their Language. But, though it be contrary to that Rule, by which Joh. 5. 31. Christ himself was willing to be tried, If I bear witness of my self, my witnes is not true; and contra∣ry to all equity and the old Capitul. Carol. Mag. c. 88. Laws, viz. That they which are brought out of our own House, ought not to be witnesses for us; yet, since they have disowned (when pressed with strength of Reason, and oppressed with Truth) the Scriptures, the Fathers and Coun∣cils, We will pursue them to their last fort; to wit, to the Decrees of their Popes, which they so much adore. If they gain-say these, then Conclamatum est, their Case is desperate. Well, then it must be so; for they have rejected the Traditions of old Popes for those of new ones: One would have thought, that old Friends and old Di∣vines had been the surest and soundest; but it is not so at Rome. For they have slighted and contradicted that De∣cree of Anaclet. Epist. ap. Bin. Tom. 1. Part. 1. p. 43. Anacletus: That all, who are present at
Mass, shall communicate; That of Gelas. decr. de Con∣fec. dist. 2. cap. 12. Pope Gelasi∣us of not taking the Bread alone, which (honest-man) he called Sacrilege; and Binius in notis Tom. 1. part 1. p. 64. That of Alexander 11. of celebrating but one. Mass in one day. Which abo∣minable practice of the Roman Church make good that saying of their own Pope P. Gelas. Ep. 4. Gelasius, Quaero ab his judicium quod praetendunt ubinam possint agitari, an apud ipsos, ut iidem sint inimici, testes & Ju∣dices? Which signifies in short, that they would be both Enemies, Witnesses and Iudges in their own Cause; as being Conscious to themselves of such Er∣rors as will not bear the test, nor can be defended without such foul play. Who then can safely trust the conduct of his Salvation to that Church, (of Rome) which refuseth to be tried by the Word of God, by the Ancient Fathers, by General Councils, and even by the Decrees of her (pretended) Spiritu∣al Heads? But because in the following Book I have produced the Testimonies of the Fathers voting against Popish Doctrines, it will not (I judge) be unnecessary to subjoyn, That, although we highly esteem and respect the Fathers, and especially those of the first Three hundred years after Christ, and make use of their Wri∣tings, as explaining the sense of the Scriptures, and handing to us the Opinions of the Ages they liv'd in; yet we never receive any of them with the same respect and esteem that we do the Word of God: And that with good reason: For though they were learned and pious men; yet they were but men, and consequently were lyable to error as well as other men.
And herein the Advite of S. Austin is to be fol∣lowed, to wit, to follow Nemi∣nem velim sic  mea omnia, ut me sequatur, nisi in eis, quibus me non erta∣re perspexe∣rit: August. de persever. Sanct. cap. 21. tom. 27. Solis eis Scripturarum libris qui jam Canonic appellantur didici hunc timorem honorem{que} de erre. ut nullum eorum autorem Scribendo aliquid errasse firmissime credam, August. Epist. 19. him (and such as him∣self) no further than they follow Truth and Holy Scri∣pture, which ought still to be preferred before them: And yet S. Augustin was neither the worst nor the meanest of those Christian Hero's. Thus do we re∣verence but do not idolize them, and only prefer the Scriptures before them; whereas the Papists value their late Papal Decrees before the Primitive Doctors. These things being premised, I shall renew that five∣fold Challenge about the Popes Supremacy, formerly propounded by a Reverend and Learned Bishop of our Church; which the Papists ought first to answer, be∣fore they can justly obtain what they in vain pretend to as Consequences of that Supremacy. For, they failing to prove this, (which, I think, they will never be able to do) their Attempts in the points depending thereon must needs be fruitless and ineffectual. The Challenge is this: 1. Whether our Saviour before his Ascension did constitute S. Peter his Vicar, and gave him a monarchi∣cal Supremacy over the Apostles and the whole Church? 2. Whether the Papists can prove, that S. Peter, while he lived, exercised such Power and Supreme Iu∣risdiction, even over the Apostles? In such Cases as these, Idem est non esse & non apparere. 3. Whether, if S. Peter exercised any such Autho∣rity, it was not temporary, and ceased with his Per∣son, as the Apostleship did?
4. Whether (if all these were true, as they are wholly the contrary) they can make it appear, That the Bishop of Rome was the Successor of S. Peter, and not the Bishop of Antioch? and whether ever he was at Rome or no? 5. Whether they can make it appear, That our Bles∣sed Saviour, when on Earth, exercised such a temporal Monarchy as the Pope now challengeth? Confessions of the Popish Doctors in this Case. To the first and second Queries it is Confessed by Cusan. de Concil. Cath. 2. 3. Cardinal Cusanus, That S. Peter received no more Authority (and then he could not exercise any Authority over his Fellows) than the rest of the A∣postles. To the third and fourth Queries it is Confessed by Aen. Syl∣vius de gestis Concil. Basil. Aeneas Sylvius (afterwards Pope, by then ame of Pius II.) That the Pope's Succession is not revea∣led in Scripture; and then it cannot be proved jure divino positivo. And by Bellarmin,De Rom. Pont. l. 4 c. 4. That neither Scripture nor Tradition (habet) allows (then farewell Papal Supremacy) That the Apostoliok Seat (or Chair) was so fixed at Rome, (which I really believe as well as he) that it could not be taken from thence. And then why might it not be at Antioch or Jerusalom as well as Rome? Confessed by himIdem de Pontif. l. 2. c. 29. further, That as long as the Emperors were Heathen, the Pope was subject to them in all civil Causes,
And That for above One thousand years, his Id. de Rom. Pont. l. 4. c. 2. Sect. Secunda Opi∣nio. Judg∣ment was not esteemed Infallible, nor Idem de Concil. l. 2. cap. 13. his Au∣thority above that of a General Council. Where was then the exercise or acknowledgment of this Supremacy and Infallibility of the Popes? Was all the World a-sleep, or ignorant so long of this Power which they now challenge to themselves Jure Divino? No, but the Pope (I warrant you) had not yet the opportunity to usurp and challenge it, as he hath done since. To four of these, you see, they have plainly yielded: and the last, they can never make good, either from Scripture or Ecclesiastical History. Add to these the Confession of that Learned Papist, Barns's Catholico-Ro∣manus Pacifi∣cus MS. Sect. 31. Father Barns, That allowing the Bishop of Rome to have Supre∣macy elsewhere; yet the Pope hath no Supremacy in Britain. Insula autem Britanniae gavisa est olim privilegio Cyprio, ut nullius Patriarchae Legibus subderetur. And afterwards, Videtur pacis ergô retineri debere sine dispendio Catholicismi & abs{que} Schismatis ullius notâ. What can the Papists say to this so plain an acknowledgment? But not design∣ing to treat at large upon the Pope's Supremacy, I have not (as in the following subjects) produced the Testimonies of Fathers and Councils against this Do∣ctrine of Rome, but shall advise the Reader to con∣sult herein Bishop Jewel against Harding, Article 4. Archbishop Bramhall's Schism Guarded against Will. Serjeant. Dr. Barrow of the Pope's Supremacy, and the Bishop of Lincoln's Brutum Fulmen, who will give him full satisfaction in that point.

THE Protestant's Companion. SECTION I. THE Protestant Church of England, our Holy Mother, admits of no other Rule for Faith and practice than the Articles of the Church of England published Ann. Dom. 1562. for the avoi∣ding of diversities of opinions, and for the establishing of consent touching true Re∣ligion, Article 6, & 20. 2d Book of Homilies, Hom. 2. Ho∣ly Scriptures, which according to 2. Tim. 3. 15. the Apostles are able to make us wise unto Salva∣tion. The Church of Rome doth equal unwritten Concil. Trident. Sess. 4. Decret. 1. Traditions with the Holy Scriptures: whom Pighius Eccles. Hie∣rarch. l. 3. c. 3. some of that Church do call a nose of Wax: Bellarmine de verbo Dei, l. 4. c. 4. Another, and that no less Man than a Cardi∣nal, affirms, That the Scripture is no more to be believed in saying that it comes from God than Mahomet's Alcoran, because that saith so too. A∣nother Pool de Primatu Ro∣manae Eccle∣siae, sol. 92. Cardinal saith, That the Scriptures have no authority but for the Decree of the Church; (they mean the Roman Church) by whom
itCaranza Controvers. 1. And no mar∣vel, when an∣other affirm∣eth that the Scripture hath no more authority than Aesop's Fa∣bles: V. Bail∣ly Tract. 1. 9. 17. ought to be regulated, and not the Church be regulated by it: and the reason is, because (as it isPeter Sutor Translat. Bibl. c. 22. confess'd) that the people would easily be drawn away from observing the Church's (i. e. Ro∣mish) InstitutionsConsul. de Stabilienda Rom. sede, p. 6. And though the Papists do cashier the publick use of the Holy Scriptures, and fly to (as they pretend) an Infallible Judge▪ yet are they not agreed among themselves, who that should be. These Learned Romanists following contend, that the priviledge of In∣fallibility belongs only to the whole Church militant, and neither to the Pope, nor General Council, nor to the Body of the Clergy: Occam Dial. p. 1. l. 5. c. 25, 29, 3., when they should perceive, That they are not contained in the Law of Christ, and that their (i. e. Popish) Doctrines are not only different from, but repugnant to the Holy Scriptures. Hence doth the ChurchCusanus Concord. Ca∣thol. l. 2. c. 3. Antoninus Sum. Summarum, p. 3. Tit. 23. c. 2. §. 6.

Reg. 4. first Ages of Christianity was a crimeHence comes it to pass that not only the Po∣pish Laity, but even the Priests themselves are very ignorant in the Holy Scriptures, so that once a Schoolman in the last Age, being to preach at Paris, where the famous Melancthon was his Auditor, took a Text (for want, I suppose, of a better Book) out of Aristotle's Ethicks, Sixtinus Amama Orat. de Barbarie ex Melancth. next door to Apostasie. Which act doth not only imply, That the Popish Church refuseth to be try'd by the Test of God's Word, but is diametrically opposite to the practice of the Primitive Christians, as appears in the following Quotations.

That Invocation of Saints was not so much begun by any Law as by Custom. This is to the purpose! But yet further, Wicelius Via Re∣gia de Invocat. Sanct. saith, That the Invocation of Saints is to be cast out of the Church, because it ascribes God's Honour and Attributes to his Creatures, and derogates from the Office and Glory of Christ, by making Saints Me∣diators and Intercessors. What Protestant could have opposed this vain Doctrine with greater strength of Reason and Ar∣gument than these Papists have done? Truth will Conquer. The Romish Church Concil. Trident. Sess. 25. Bulla Pii 4. super forma Iuramenti ad calcem Concil. Trid.

If this be not Ido∣latry, I know not what can be such! And yet, that nothing might be wanting in their Worship, to make up the measure of iniquity, They deny Index Expurgatorius Madri. 1612. in indice librorum expurgatorum, p. 39. dele—Solus Deus adorandus. That God alone is to be worshipped. I suppose, they mean, he must have sharers with him in that Honour; for otherwise it cannot be sence: I am sure, however, it is Blasphemy.
Image Worship is Contrary to Scripture, Exod 20. 4, 5. Hence do the Papists often leave the Second Commandment out of their Cate∣chisms, as in Vaux's Catechism, Ledesma's Catechism, & Officium B. Mariae, Pii 5. Pont. jussu editum Ant∣werp. A. D. 1590.

S. 3. c. 14. S. 8. SECT. IV. OUR Church contends for and embraces that faith, which was Jude 3. once delivered to the Saints, and admits and professes that same, which all true Christians have made the badge of their Holy Profession, which Articles, and Iewel's Apology. is briefly compre∣hended in the Apostles Creed, and explain'd in those others call'd the Nicene and Athanasian, which may be prov'd by the Scriptures, and have been approved by the Universal Church, by the De∣crees of the first General Councils and Writings of the Fathers. The Popish Church, especially that part of it which is called the Court of Rome, obtrudes and imposes new Articles of Faith,
making Bellar. de Eccles. l. 3. the Bishop of Rome the Infallible Judge and Arbitrator of all Doctrines, enjoyning an implicit faith and blind obedience to his Di∣ctates; wherein we must renounce M. Cres∣sie in his Ap∣pendix c 7. Sect. 8. saith, That the Wits and Judg∣ments of Ca∣tholicks (he means Pa∣pists) is to renounce their Judg∣ment and de∣pose their own wit.

And this knack of making new Creeds is very agreeable to that fancy of Salmeron, Non omnibus omnia dedit Deus, ut quaelibet aetas suis gaudeat verita∣tibus, quas prior aetas ignoravit, Dis. 57. in Ep. ad Rom. they say) the power of making new Creeds, Contrary to Scripture, Gal. 1. 8, 9. Contrary to S. Augustin de Unit. Eccles. contr. Epist. Petil. c. 3. and all the Fathers who shew an esteem for the Scripture.

Popes Judgment was not esteemed Infallible, nor his Id. de Concil. lib. 2. c. 13. Authority above that of a General Council; much less then is it above that of the Holy Scriptures. Hence must it necessarily follow, That it is a new Article of the Creed, to believe that the Pope can make new Creeds. Consult Dr. Stillingfleet's Discourse concerning the Idolatry practised in the Church of Rome, Chap. 4.
SECT. V. OUR Church useth the same Article 25. Sacraments, which our Saviour Christ left in his Mat. 28. 19. Luk. 22. 19, 20.

They certainly had confidence enough, but nei∣ther too much Reason nor too much Religion, who durst disannul what our Blessed Saviour had en∣joyn'd, and what carried his Seal to that very day.

SECT. VI. WE do not believe that the Elements of Bread and Wine Article 28, & 29. after Consecration become the very Body and Blood of Christ, though the worthy Receiver partakes of both in a spiritual manner by faith; because we herein have all the testimony we are capable of; viz. that of our Rea∣sons and of our Senses, to believe, That there is not a real Transubstantiation or a change of the Elements of Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of our Saviour: which is an absurd tenet, and hath occasioned many Superstitions. The Church of Rome holds, that there Concil. Trident. Sess. 13. c. 4. is a conversion of the whole substance of Bread and Wine into the substance of Christ's Body and Blood by Consecration.

Mary's days, insisted upon against the Papists, and demanded what it was that was burned? one answered, That it was either the Body of Christ, or the substance of Bread put there by miracle; at which he smil'd, and said, a Reply was needless: and I think so too.

And yet this was the bloody Test in Queen Ma∣ry's days, by which so many Glorious Martyrs changed Earth for Heaven. SECT. VII. OUR Church acknowledges no Purgatory Article 22, & 18. or Propitiation for our sins, but that which was made once for all Article 31. Heb. 10. 10. by our Blessed Saviour; and that upon the condition of Faith and Repentance. We Article 22. disown all Pardons and Indulgences as grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God; since we are told that we have nothing 1 Cor. 4. 7. but what we have received. We own that good works Article 12. are the fruits of Faith, and follow af∣ter Justification, but that they cannot put away sins, and endure the severity of God's Judgment, much less for the sins of others: nor can Article 14. we perform works over and above God's Commands, call'd by the Papists works of Supererogation: to say which, is the highest arrogance. For when
we have done all we are commanded, Christ en∣joyns us to say, We are unprofitable Servants. And we look upon our selves as righteous before God for the Article 11, & 13. merit of our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own works and deserts. The Romish Church owns a Purgatory Concil. Trident. Sess. ult. Hence doth Bellar∣mine threaten us, saying, that whosoever be∣lieves not Pur∣gatory, shall be tormented iu Hell, de Purgat. l. 1. c. ult. And yet this same Cardinal (for∣getting what he had before affirm'd (for herein he doth not only contradict himself, but all Popish pre∣tensions for Purgatory, when he) grants that Souls in Pur∣gatory do not merit.

To what end then are they sent to Purgatory? for sins pardoned, so that there still remains a guilt of temporal punishment to be paid, either in this life or hereafter in Purgatory.

SECT. IX. AS our Church employs such persons in the Ministry of God's Worship and Sacraments, and in feeding and governing the Flock of Christ, as are Article 36. Book of Ordination.

Discourse 6. lawfully called to their Office and Mi∣nistry, and are Consecrated and Ordained accor∣ding to the Scriptures and Canons of the Univer∣sal Church, and of whose Bishops we can shew Which the Roman Church, not∣withstanding its big pre∣tences to con∣stant successi∣on, cannot justly chal∣lenge: and that both from its five vacancies, making up almost Nine years, when Rome had no Bishop at all, and the many Schisms, by some Chronologers reckoned up to be Twen∣ty nine (a fair number indeed!) by Onuphrius to be Thirty, and by Bellarmin him∣self to be Twenty six: Whereof the Twentieth Schism lasted Twenty years, and the 21st. lasted 36 years; during which time the Church of Rome had two Popes, which excommunicated each other; the 26th continued, saith Genebrard (Chron. l. 4.) An. Dom. 1378. from Urban VI. till the Council of Constance, which was at least Thirty five years. Baronius (ad Annum 1044. Sect. 5. Tom. 11.) calls the three Popes who then contended for the Papal Chair, a Beast with Three heads ascending out of the bottomless Pit. Add to these the Seventy years stay of the Popes at Avignion, which quite joints their boasted Succession. For during these times, where was the true Successor of S. Peter? Or was the Church (in their sense) so long without an Head? a Succession to the Apostles of our Saviour as fully as any other Church at this day can do: so do we leave all Article 32. Ecclesiasticks, whether Bishops, Priests, or Deacons, to Marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness; since Heb. 13. 4. Marriage is honourable in all, and not forbid, but permited, and, in Cases so requiring, enjoyned by God's Law, and practised as well as taught by persons of the same function (i. e. Priests) in the best and purest Ages of the Church, as may be seen in the following Quotations.
The Church of Rome Bellar∣min. lib. 1. de Cleric. c. 20. Sect. Respon∣deo. Id. de ma∣trim. l. 1. c. 21. denies Marriage to the Clergy, but permits (I suppose, by way of re∣quital to) them Concubines Hence did Aeneas Sylvius (after∣wards Pope, by the name of Pius 11.) mention how Ulric bishop of Ausburg reprov'd the Pope concern∣ing Concu∣bines, Aeneas Sylvius de morib. Germaniae.: For so doth Dist. 82. Can. Presbyter in Glossa. Cardinal Campegius observe, and Pighius teach, which doth not only give great cause of scan∣dal to Iews and Infidels, but in 1 Tim. 4. 1. 3. the Holy Apostles judgment is the Doctrine of Devils. And the Reason of Concubinage may be easily in∣ferr'd, when some Coster. Enchiridion de coelibat. prop. 9. Durandus sent. l. 4. dist. 33. Martinus de Magistris lib. de temp. qu. 2. de luxuria. 3. Qu. 7. Lata Extravag. de bigamis Quia circa. Communiter dicitur, Quod Clericus pro simplici fornicatione deponi non debet. dist. 81. Maximianus glossa in Gratian. of their most Learned Men will scarce allow Fornication to be a Sin; however preferring it in Ecclesiasticks before law∣ful Wedlock. The forbidding of Marriage is Contrary to Scripture, Levit. 21. 13. 1 Tim. 3, 2. 12. Hebr. 13. 4. 1 Cor. 7. 2, 9. That the Apostles were Married, except S. Iohn, is Confessed by these Fathers, Ignatius ad Philadelph, Clemens Stromat. lib. 7. Euseb. Histor. Eccles. lib. 3. c. 30. who report that S. Paul was Married; and S. Ambrose in 2 Cor. c. 11. who acknowledges, that all the Apostles ex∣cept S. Iohn were Married.
Fathers that were Married themselves and yet were either Bishops or Priests, &c. Tertullian, as appears by his Two Books to his Wife, and yet he was a Priest, as appears from S. Ierome, do Eccles. Script. Gregory Nazianzen was the Son of a Bishop: see Greg. Nazianz. in carmine de vitâ suâ, & Elias Cre∣tensis in Orat. Greg. Nazianz. S. Hilary, Bishop of Poictiers, was Married, as is evident from his Epistle written to his Daugh∣ter, Abrae, &c.

Marriage of the Clergy was not absolutely for∣bidden by the Greeks in the last Age, as ap∣pears by the Patriarch Hieremias's Letter to the Tubing Divines, dated May 15. 1576. Pri∣mum Patriar. Resp. apud Chytrae. de statu Ec∣cles. Orient. p. 149. This Heretical Doctrine of forced Celibate in Ecclesiasticks, was first established at Rome by Pope Gregory the 7th. aliàs Hildebrand, termed An∣tichrist by Aventinus Anual Boiorum, l. 5. who tells us, That Hil∣debrand con∣fessed, when he was dying, that it was by the instigation of the Devil that he made so great a di∣sturbance in the Christian World. A fit Man then was he (whom the Papists still cry up so much) to introduce unchaste Celibate, and banish Holy Matrimony! See also Cardinal Benno (who knew him) in vita & gesta Hildebrandi. Matth. Westmonast. Anno Dom. 1074. who saith, That Hildebrand expell'd Married Priests (Mark what follows) contra Sanctorum Patrum sententias, against the opinions of the Holy Fathers. See also Sigebert ad Annum 1074. & Matth. Paris ad Annum 1074. Ancient Historians about A. D. 1074. and was first put in practice to purpose by Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury Henry Hunting∣ton p. 378. and by Ioranal. Histor. The Constitutions of this Synod may be seen in Archbishop Parker's Antiq. Britan. Ed. 2. p. 118, 119. here in England, about A. D. 1105. Dr. Burnet's Abridgment of the History of the Reformation l. 2. p. 70, &c. though some will have his Predecessor Lanfranc to have impo∣sed it upon the Prebendaries and Clergy that li∣ved in Towns, but not without great reluctan∣cy. For what complaints, what Tragedies, what lascivious pranks this Devillish Doctrine occa∣sioned, the Historians declare at large; particular∣ly that Comical Story of the Italian Cardinal Iohn de Crema, Recorded by Ancient Roger Hovedon, Henry Huntington. Popish Hi∣storians, who, after he had entertained the En∣glish Clergy with a fine Discourse against Marri∣age,
was the same night caught in Bed with a Harlot in London; as if he would only com∣mend Virginity to others, and practise the contrary himself. That the Reader may know, what an Age this was, wherein the Celibate of the Clergy was established, let him hear Cardinal Bellarmin de∣scribing and characterizing it in his Chronology. In these times (saith he) wherein the Roman Bi∣shops did degenerate from the Piety of the Ancients (mark that!) the secular Princes flourished in Ho∣liness. You therefore see, that Priests Marriage was forbidden by impious Popes. And about the beginning of this contention, (viz. about An. Dom. 860.) the Pope got a round check from Udalricus or Ulric. Udalri∣cus (mention∣ed by Aeneas Sylvius de mo∣ribus Germa∣niae) de Coeli∣batu Clerici. Nunquid enim merito communi omnium sapien∣tum judicio haec est violen∣tia, &c. a Bishop of that time, who told him, That in the judgment of all wise Men, it was to be accounted violence, when, any Man against Evangelical Institution (mind that!) and the charge of the Holy Ghost, is constrained to the execution of private Decrees. The Lord in the old Law appointed Marriage to his Priest, which he is never read afterwards to have forbidden. But not to insist upon this clear testimony for the Doctrine and Practice of our Church, nor to mention the many other ill consequences of a Celi∣bate in the Clergy (which occasion in other Coun∣tries, where Popish Religion is publickly professed, that Satyrical Proverb to be Fils de Prestre) by some of the most eminent Men in the Roman Church, and those too of a late date.
It is Confessed, That Priesthood doth not dissolve Marriage; so Cardinal Cajetan, Tom. 1. Tract. 27. Nor That it is of the essence (or being) of a Priest to keep single; so Dominicus Soto l. 7. de Iure Qu. 4. Moreover that upstart practice in the Roman Church of Auricular Confession, wherein Concil. Trident. Sess. 14. de poeni∣tenti▪ i. eve∣ry Christian is bound under pain of Damnation, to confess to a Priest all his mortal Sins, which af∣ter a diligent examination he can possibly remem∣ber; yea, even his most secret sins, his very thoughts, yea, and all the circumstances of them which are of any moment, is a slavery as great as groundless. Then not to mention its ill aspect upon Government, as being made an engine of State, and a Picklock of the Cabinets of Princes, sealing up all things from the notice of the Ma∣gistrate, but in requital of that, making a liberal discovery of what is against him to others. A pregnant instance of which horrid consequence was that damnable Treason designed by Gun∣powder against the Person of King Iames the First (of blessed Memory) and the two Houses of Parliament, to which the Pope himself, as we Delrio disq. Magic. l. 6. c. 1. are credibly informed, was not only pri∣vy, but its director too. Pursuant thereof, that Pope (Clement VIII.) a little before that time gave order, that no Priest should discover any
thing that came to his Knowledge in Confession, to the benefit of the Secular Government. I think there needs no better evidence of the Pope's good intentions towards the Secular Go∣vernment, nor what ill effects the practice of this sort of Confession can and may produce than this. And, that it still may be used as an Instru∣ment in procuring the ruine of Princes, and sub∣version of Kingdoms, Let us hear their (i. e. the Popish) Doctors opinion of its virtue and use. One of them (then) tell us, That the Seal of Auricular Confession (which they hold to be of Divine institution) is so Sacred, that it may not be broken open to save Tolet. Instruct. Sa∣cerd. l. 3. c. 16. the Lives of Princes, or of the whole Commonwealth. Another Henri∣quez. de poenit. l. 2. c. 19. n. 5. goes further, and saith, That the Seal of Con∣fession is not to be broken; no, not to save all the World. Here the Reader may see, (for this is not on∣ly the opinion of one or two private Men, but runs with the stream of their See Eudaemon▪ Io∣annes in his Apology for Garnet, Binet, Suarez, &c. Writers) what may be expected from the Charity of their Popish Priests; what an unlucky tool Auricular Confession is in And yet they can say, that it is of Divine Right, see Biel l. 4. dist. 17. Q. 1. & Scotus ibid. & Bonaventure ibid. n. 72. which if it had been, the Fathers would never have writ against it, nor would it have been disannull'd: For private Confession of crimes was abrogated about Anno Dom. 396. upon the Discovery of a Whoredom committed be∣twixt a Deacon and a Noble Woman, Histor. Tripartit. l. 9. c. 35. And, though it was practised several years before, yet was it not enjoyn'd as a necessary act of Salvation before the Council of Lateran, An. Dom. 1215. under Pope Innocent III. and therefore ar from true Antiquity! their hands. Besides, to
how great an awe of, and respect for their Con∣fessor; (to whom they are bound, as I have al∣ready said, to discover all their Sins under pain of Eternal Damnation) To what Pride and Inso∣lence, to what Lust and Revenge, to what Ava∣rice and Rapine are not only the meanest Men, but even Persons that make the greatest figure, exposed unto, by Auricular Confession in Popish Churches! It is a slavery so great and intollera∣ble, that the Israelitish Tasks in Egypt were a pleasure, or (at least) a divertisement in compa∣rison of it. Auricular Confession to a Priest under point of Salvation and Damnation, and that Peo∣ple cannot be saved without it, is Contrary to Scripture, Isai. 55. 7. Acts 2. 38. & c. 3. 19. & c. 16. 30, 31. Rom. 10. 3. Contrary to the Fathers, (who when they did speak of the necessity of Confession, generally meant Confession before God only, or a publick acknowledgment of some pub∣lick crimes incurring the censure of Excommuni∣cation, and that in an Ecclesiastical Assembly.) Origen in Psal. 37. Hom. 2. Cyprian de lapsis Serm. 5. Chrysostom Hom. 4. de Lazaro. Id. Hom. 2. in Psal. 50. Homil. 31. in Epist. ad Hebraeos.
Hom. 5. de incomprehensibili nat. Dei. Hom. 8. de poen. Hom. de poenit. & Confessione. Augustin. Con∣fession. l. 10. c. 3. Auricular Confession acknowledged not to have been Instituted by our Saviour, and that it is not of Divine Institution by these Learned Papists. Cardinal Cajetan in Ioh. 20. Scotus in sent. 4. dist. 17. Q. 1. Maldon. in summa Qu. 18. Art. 4. Bell. de poenit. l. 1. c. 4. Acknowledged by others, That it is better to say, that it was Instituted rather by the Tradition of the Universal Church, than by the Authority of the Old and New Testa∣ment; And yet it is denyed, That this Tradition is Universal, and that it is not necessary amongst the Greeks, because this Custom (i. e. of private Confession) sprung not up among them, de poenit. dist. 5. in principio Gloss.
Again it is Confessed, That the Fathers scarce speak of it as a thing commanded, by Rhenanus in admonitione de Tertullian. Dogmat. Lastly, It is Confessed, That we may obtain Pardon though our Mouths be silent, (then we do not confess.) And our Lord doth shew, that a Sinner is not cleansed by the Judgment of the Priest; but by the Bounty of Divine Grace. Gratian▪ dist. 1. cap. Convertimini. What clashing and enterfering is here? Is this the pretended solid Union of the Popish Church in matters of Salvation, and which she enjoyns under pain of Damnation? Have they no bet∣ter Grounds for their Articles of Faith than these? Can Auricular Confession be of Divine In∣stitution, and yet neither be Instituted by our Blessed Saviour, nor mentioned by the Fathers as a Divine Precept, nor imposed by an Uni∣versal Tradition of the Church? And lastly, can it be necessary to Salvation, and yet we can obtain pardon of Sins without the use of it? Let any Papist reconcile me these, & erit mihi magnus Apollo.
Consult herein Bishop Taylor's Disswasive, Part 1. Ch. 2. Sect. 2. F. White against Jesuite Fisher, p. 189. Concerning the Marriage of the Clergy, see Bi∣shop Iewel's Defence of the Apology of the Church of England, Part 2. p. 180. and Part 5. p. 456. Bishop Hall's Honour of the married Clergy. SECT. X. AS I have all along shewed the vast difference in Doctrines betwixt the Protestant Church of England and the Church of Rome: so will I put a Period to this Discourse, after I have done the like in that of Obedience: Which I shall not (as I have hitherto) argue from the Articles and Homilies of our Church, the Decrees of their Church, the Writings of the Fathers, and from Ancient Councils, because that hath been suffi∣ciently canvassed of late years; but only subjoyn the undenyable Testimonies of King Iames I. and King Charles the Martyr, of ever-blessed Memo∣ries (and the Royal Grandfather and Father of our present Gracious Sovereign) to determin the Case of
Protestant's Loyalty and Popish Rebellion. King Charles I. in his Excellent Book, entitu∣led ' chap. 27. to our late Gracious King (and then Prince of Wales) saith, The best Profession of Religion, I have ever esteemed that of the Church of England in which you have been educated. Yea it was but two days before his death, that he told the Princess Eli∣zabeth, That he should dye for maintaining the true Pro∣testant Religi∣on. In this I charge you to per∣severe, as coming nearest to God's Word for Do∣ctrine, and to the Pri∣mitive Example for Go∣vernment. I tell you, I have tried it, and af∣ter much search, and many disputes, have con∣cluded it to be the best in the World: keeping the middle way between the pomp of Supersti∣tious Tyranny, and the meanness of Fantastick Anarchy. King Iames I. in His Works, p. 504. saith, As on one part, many honest Men, seduced with some Errors of Popery, may yet remain good and faithful Sub∣jects; so on the other part, none of those that truly know and believe the whole grounds and School-conclusions of their Doctrines, can ever either prove good Chri∣stians or good Subjects.
Ibid. Scarce any one who hath been a beginner or prosecutor of this late War against the Church, the Laws and Me, was, or is a true Lover, Em∣bracer or Practiser of the Protestant Religion esta∣blished in England. To which I add (So∣latii ergô) that excellent Expression in His Maje∣sty's first and most Gra∣cious Speech to His Pri∣vy Council: I know the Principles of the Church of England are for Mo∣narchy, and the Mem∣bers of it have shewed themselves good and faithful Subjects, there∣fore shall I always take care to defend and sup∣port it. King Charles I. in his Solemn Declaration, Octo∣ber 23. 1642. saith, That there was a grea∣ter number of Papists in the Rebels Army than in His. To which may be ad∣ded, That then they are guilty of this mortal Sin of Obedience to a Pro∣testant Prince, when they are not strong enough to manage a Rebellion, Watson's Quodlibets, p. 255. These words deserve to be written in Letters of Gold; however they are written in large Cha∣racters in good Protestants Hearts.
Now, Unto Him who is able to keep us fromJude 24, 25. falling, and to present us faultless before the presence of his Glory with exceed∣ing Ioy, To the only Wise God our Sa∣viour, be Glory and Majesty, Domini∣on and Power, both now and ever, Amen. FINIS.
