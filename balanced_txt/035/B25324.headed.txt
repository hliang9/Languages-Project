The Translator to the Reader. INgenious Reader, this carping age I know expects an Apology, though I have done nothing worthy there of, yet lest I should infringe the Prescript of custome, (which parallel in prevalency with na∣ture) which is to premise something like a Preludium to entertaine my Rea∣der, I must render those Adamantine attractives which gave being to this me∣tamorphisis. History (not to fall into common places thereof) is a more la∣sting pillar then that of Absolon; for sure we had never heard of that pillar, had it not bin upheld by the sacred pil∣lar: It perpetuates the memory in the leaves of eternity, rescuing old age from the jawes of oblivion, adorning youth
with gray haires of experience, so that we may well say, Nos jam jam a pueris illico nascimur senes. This induced my eyes to wander a∣mongst the tombs of our fore-fathers, where besides a Catalogue of those rare vertues which enriched the celestiall sparkles, their souls, there was black E∣pithites of vice, which more depressed others fame, then the Marble did their bodies. The first, I supposed, writ for invitation to imitate, the second to stand like an Index anchoralis, or sea∣marke, lest posterity should collide up∣on the same rocke. But to draw my self into a lesser circle, finding the History of Scotland to be a stranger unto us, of the same Isle: especially that of our late King James, whose checkered fortune may run equipage with the most Poten∣tates. I fixed by the propitious diety, my eyes upon this production of Master Robert Johnstons, where having fed my memory with a sufficient banquet, I could do no lesse, being conscious, that omne bonum est diffusinum, then force him to leave his exoticke, and appear in our own language, but dulcius ex ipso fonte bibunturaquae. Water is best at the spring head, I know it, and desire that such
whose ingenuity can, will read him in his owne Character, as for others, give them leave to tast at second hand: but the Author loseth his lustre, I confesse it, yet so farre as the propriety of our speech, and my weak intellect can reach I will be carefull thereof; If some criti∣call Grammarians thinke that I wander too far from home, pray let them know I am not reading a verball translation, yet dare presume the sence of the Au∣thor is no wayes invarted, and who knows not that we have Anglisismes as well as the Latine have their proprie∣ties; remember that sage and learned speech. Nec verbum verbo reddere cures. For the Translation I say no more, then that it was the work of one, who could say in part with Seneca, non vaco somno, sed succumbo et oculos vigilia fatiga∣tos, Sen. Ep. 8 cauentes{que} in dolore detineo. If my pen seeme sometime to play the wanton, know it was used in a liscencious time, and take but an inch where it might have an ell. Thus I am ingenious in confession (and so no Antinomian) be as ingenious in remitting, so thou wilt be a true Christian. The Author who hath paid nature
her due having no Issue descended from his loynes, well knew the maxime libri sunt liberi, which caused him be so pro∣fuse in giving life to 22. booke, a con∣carination of the memorable passages in this our Isle, and our neighbour of Ireland with some exotickes from the year 1571. to the year 1629. two wher∣of only saw light, the rest running the same hazard which abortives doe, are involved in a Scotch mist. I have entirely transcribed the Histo∣ry of Scotland, so far as is extant, know∣ing that Master Cambden (who now speakes English) will supply the rest for our own Nation, that the Author had no other end then free himselfe from that tye, wherewith he stood engaged to his Countrey, may appear in all his actions an abreviation whereof it writ in these, or the like Characters over E∣denborough Colledge gate. Master Robert Johnston Doctor of the Civill and Canon Law, expended up∣on this Ʋniversity eight Fellowships, the disbursments concerning which, amoun∣ted to twelve thousand pounds; he enri∣ched the Library with many volumes; commanded John Joffy to errect these
foure chambers, and by his last will hee left 40000 pound to be distributed in pi∣ous uses for the City, with many other deeds of his bountiful minde, he left them as eternal monuments of his piety in the yeare of our Lord 1639. If my infant quil shall faile in its en∣terprize, and by blotting these few sheets, blot the Authors candor, & per∣spicuity: let me desire thee, by that which is the desires of thy soule, to take off those imputations from the Au∣thor by a Metamorphosis of thy owne; thus I shall be perpetually engaged to thee in condiscending to my poore re∣quests, and the world to me, in that I have engaged thy quill. Carpere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua. Mart. Thine if favorable, T. M.
The Author to the Reader. IF I who have taken upon me to handle, and let Posterity know those memo∣rable Acts of Queen Elizabeth and King James; having herein given de∣monstrations of greater diligence, and fidelity, then eloquence of Phrase, can by these my Intel∣lectualls, and willing endeavours, adde any sparkle to the beauty of this our Britaine, I shall account it a super aboundant fruit of my labours: and as I dare not invite your pallat to any excellent, or egregious banquet, having taken an account of my owne strength, where I finde nothing save a great burthen, and perhaps a dangerouus under∣taking. The integrity of my conscience, the wisedome and humanity of my Readers, who will deigne to foster, I doubt not, these my lucubrati∣ons, gave life to my resolves in displaying those heroick performances of the fore-named Poten∣tates to the open view of all. Beleeve it, my faith is not mercinary, nor pinned upon any mans favour. I have brought forth no abortive, the product of my braine I sacrifice to your censures, so I am full of hopes my labours shall not be in∣gratefull. And now Gentlemen, I supplicate upon the knees of ardency, that you adhibite such equity in reading, as you desire me to do in writing: I look for no other reward of my en∣deavours then this, of a good report, and per∣mnent memory when I have satisfied nature.
I value not much what breath every man is plea∣sed to blow upon this Infant, knowing that there is not any thing sublunary so exquisite, which will retish in the Critical pallats of our Sciolists, who suppose themselves the Censurers of elegan∣cy. My language is not in that Character, that an ingenuous Reader may give it an ambiguous Interpretation, or call any thing into question; seeing that naturally benevolent and under∣standing men are courteous, and so humane, as to give every man his due, not eying so nearely the ornaments of speech as the truth thereof: whereas maligning, base, harsh, detracting, en∣vious spirits put all things well spoken upon the Rack of a sinister Interpretation, depraving the whole structure of the building, erecting strong Batteries of malice against others. If the bolts of these men are shot from the bowes of levity, or rashnesse, I matter not: if from the vulgar ignorance, I despise it: if of malice, I forgive them: But I tremble at, nay rather adore, and admire the others gravitie, prudencie, authority. It lyes not in the verge of any mortall to compose a Ditty delightfull to every eare, seeing some delight to wallow in the mire of obsolete words; while others set their repose in grave and sage sentences: others take pleasure in Laconical brevity, and are over∣joyed with a concise and subtile pen; others, as if offended with brevity and over accutenesse, labours after a dilated and sublime language; it's the folly now in fashion amongst our writers, to effect Caesars sublime eloquence, Cato or Sa∣lusts brevity, Tacirus pompe, Livies Eagle-soa∣ring, and sweetly moving speech. This producti∣on I ingeniously confesse, hath not any indument above the vulgar: expect only to see her pres
you with Brittains actions, barely invested with cloathes of necessity, devoyd of Fucus, imbro∣dering insinuation, or inveterate heart-burning. Might my trembling pen adde any tittle of ho∣nour to their late Illustrious Majesties: or muzle the blacke mouthes of detraction then my de∣sires arrive at the haven of repose. Lastly, ha∣ving sequestred my thoughts from gaping after vaine breath of praise, and popular applause. I send not this forth as an Herald of my inge∣nuity, but rather an Index of labour, which will say my end of intention was not glory, but desire of truth, and a good report in after ages. I matter not what calumnies the ignorant, or Criticks do cast, or the obliterations of such, who personating Consorers, metamorphose many things according to the dictate of their owne will, bothing up some few depraved additions, or else op off seeming exuberances, who sup∣pose no Author worthy their perusall which speaks not with a refined Ciceronian tongue, supposing to compose a Garland of glory for their owne browes, by descauting on Letters or Syl∣lables, if by a bare conjecture they can restore lustre to any one word, they are presently eleva∣ted with a superstoicall arrogancy: Mistake me not, for as I cannot embrace the confidence of these men, so by no means do I derogate any thing from the various prelections of the lear∣ned, from their corrections, observations (which are collected with fidelity, and modesty, both in opinion and conjecture) upon the obscure and depraved places of Authors. But me thinks I heare some say, What a Candle at noon day, Mr. Cambden being every way a superlative scholar hath compiled Annalls both true, naked, comely, and delectable, of such Acts as Queen Elizabeths
Raigne produced, which might deter any other from writing thereof. Surely, that rare Au∣thor weighes as sad in the ballance of my under∣standing as in any others: and by how much he exceeds in modesty, so much the more he attracts me to light my candle at his Luminary: nor can I memorize him without a congratulation, in that he would accommodate others whose minds were bent upon compiling an History, with conve∣nient matterialls, as he candidly attests in his Preface to the Reader: If so, I hope my candid and impartiall Judges (who have the authority to adjudg of my imbecility & rash attempts) wil acquit these my imbicile endeavours, after so ex∣quisite an Author, not to be altogether foolish, nor my undertakings rash: however, I know they will absolve me as innocent, pardon me if nocent. To draw to a haven, if any Popeling shall brand me for seeming to elevate the Queen of England above the sphere of her deserts, let him know, truth speaks not the commemoration of any benefit I enjoyed, or the hope of future advancement; it was the Chariot of those An∣gelicall vertues adorning her soule, which moun∣ted her so high, for which that wicked brood in vaine envyed her; and as infamous Rebells (who had divested themselves of all allegiance and fi∣delity to Prince or Countrey, barked against her in their Pulpits, against whom the wicked Jesu∣ites inveighed, those whom neither fear nor mo∣desty, nor religion could deter from machinating the most wicked of Plots, robbing by the high way without being punished, amplifying their fortunes so far as either their violence or de∣ceit could extend; hatching plots to ruinate the Nobility, disturbing the Kingdom by their te∣merity and madnesse, and faster the ignorant
multitude with frenzy, that they alone like Wolves or Lyons might dominier in the Church. For my part, I suppose every Writer is engaged to resist and delineate their rash attempts, and perfideous practises, who strive to overthrow their Countrey; being Authors and Archie∣tectors of every molestation. And now Readers let me tell you in this Tract, it will be no lesse apparent than if writ with a beam from the fun, how zealous I have prosecuted what ever might be materiall to the truth of History, to excite my Readers minds to embrace vertue, honesty, and wisedome. If in the least degee I hold cor∣respondency with your Expectatns, and execute my Office, (a faithfull Historian) my Exultations will be abundant, if my judgement, (which surely is very little) may have your approbati∣ons, your often perusall of these my endeavours will invite me so much the more to perfect, and put a period to my begun purposes: so that I shall be at your command, ready to give life to some other birth of my brain?
THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND, During the Minority of King IAMES. Anno Domini. 1572. THe Diadem of Scotland adorned King Iames the sixth, ere his head was wel out of its Cradle, his Mother consenting thereto: but the disparity betwixt his age and rule, cau∣sed him govern by proxie: so that while a guardian sate at the sterne of the Com∣mon-wealth, he enjoyed the Soveraign∣ty and Title of King: His childe-hood was placed in the hazards of extreame danger, tossed by the strivings of for∣tune; Hee was bereaved of his Father, while the Cradle was the place of his re∣pose; The horrid tempests of bosome Jars and civill distempers, hurried the
Queen Mother (having devested her selfe of Majesticall robes) into exile. Nor was the period set here, for he was well nigh overwhelmed by the floods of sedi∣tion, and buslings of the Nobility a∣bout regency in the Weale publique, which molested his inward quiet. The slaughter of the Earles of Murrey and Linnox, Protectors (added more fuell to the fire of disturbance) the Earle of Mar, a man exhibiting no small lustre of equi∣ty and prudence in time of his regencie, was swallowed up by I know not what sodaine death: thereupon succeeded the Nobles Election of the Earl of Morton to be Regent: the residue of the Kings mi∣nority was obscured by quotidiā whirl∣winds, storms, and tempests. These o∣minous passages of his Fathers bitter fu∣nerall, Mothers flight and banishment, the most execrable murther of his Gran∣father, no sooner had their exits, then the smiling face of Heaven caused af∣faires to succeed more prosperously, so that in future, he did as it were compose mirrors of felicity and vertue, for his Successors to behold themselves in; such may we nominate the almost lavish ex∣pence and pompe he manifested in so∣lemnizing his Mothers Funerall, cau∣sing
the Law revenge his Grandfathers quarrell, the sword his Fathers. In the midst of domestick disconsola∣tions, and the State publique perturba∣tions, Morton being elected to steer the Common-wealth, the transferring of which power, converted his thoughts to the Republique, so that he by his autho∣rity summoned the Nobility to hold a Parliament at Edenburough, in which was enacted divers Laws, profitable for the defence of the reformed Religion, the Kingdomes tranquility, and His Maje∣sties safety; He likewise with the con∣sent of the Parliament, decreed that such as refused the reformed Churches Communion (unlesse after warning ex∣hibited) they repented of their supersti∣tious madnesse, should be branded with the note of Infamy, not worthy to beare office in the State, or be advanced to any dignity. Secondly, that such as were contumaciously averse to the Protestant Religion, should lose the priviledge of Subjects. Thirdly, those whom the Church did excommunicate, to be held Rebels; Lastly, all Subjects should be bound to defend the received Protestant profession with their persons and estates, against all such Potentates
as sided with the Counsell of Trent, to the destruction of Protestants. And there issued forth a Proclamation in the Kings name, to make all Popish Bishops uncapable of bearing any office or pub∣like employment, whether they were of Ecclesiasticall or Civil Jurisdiction, un∣lesse according to the solemne forme of abjuration, they renounced publiquely their erroneous tenents: but the aunci∣ent Protestant Ministers who detested the dregs of popish superstition, were not to expect any diminution of honor or Jurisdiction. And it was further declared, that forthwith all Massemon∣gers should be devested, and stript of their functions and Ecclesiasticall reve∣nues. These things thus established, many who were solely addicted to the Ro∣mish religion, yet being seazed on by fear of losing their estates, did not only sweare to the Protestant Religion, but also confirmed the same by subscription. Let not here be matter of wonder admi∣nistred, that the Religion within so many precedentages, had by the three runged ladder; of mans authority, cove∣tousnesse, and popish tyranny, attained to an incredible altitude, should now
at once, by the hearing of mans threat∣nings and feare of loosing estates, fall flat to the ground. But to make our progresse in the In∣fancy of the Churches reformarion, cer∣taine men were elected Ephori, or as o∣thers call them, Superintendents, who were invested with authority to ordain, chastise, or displace Ministers: these men not differing from others either in ha∣bite or dignity, governed Nationall, Provinciall, and Presbyteriall Synods, according to the dictates of their owne will, every man being attentive to the opinion of Superintendents. This institution had its rise from the downfall of the Romish, and restaura∣tion of the Protestant Religion, on which depends the Kings splendor, the Kingdomes security. The Regent Mor∣ton conceived the Function of Prelates to be no lesse necessary then commodi∣ous, yet he desired that it might be ena∣cted that Orthodox Bishops in Scot∣land should be regulated according to the Church of Englands rule, that such Bishops as were blinded with the mists of Popery might be ejected, wishing withall those who were to enjoy the title and revenue of the Bishops, should
be men of quiet natures, and that they might freely give their Votes in Parlia∣ment, be abridged of exercising autho∣rity over other Ministers, wholy abstai∣ning from that part of their Office: so great, so free was the power of Synods, Presbyters, and moderate Presidents in that tempest. Religion thus setled, and the Princes safety so observed, Morton had time to take a view of Civill and private af∣faires; he had a vigilancie, least any thing obnoxious to that obligation of Queen Elizabeths amity might enter∣vene the education and conservation of His Majestie: He conferred on Alex∣ander Eskine, the Earle of Marr being as yet rather fit to be educated then to e∣ducate, he constituted George Beuchanan (a man ascended to no little height of same by the scale of learning) his Tutor which with exquisite care and diligence in teaching him piety to God, and ju∣stice to men he performed. These things being in agitation, Iames Hamilton, Duke of Castle-herauld, the Earles of Arguile and Huntly, Hume, Seton, Haris, auncient Barons of the Kingdome, withsome others who mo∣ved in no inferiour sphaere, seeing Infan∣cy
adorned with Majestie, and the Re∣gency of the State in the hands of a pro∣tector under a childs domination, be∣gun to murmur against the Vice-royes government, and withstand him, by leaning to the French faction, least o∣therwise his authority might be corro∣borated: But to overturne a governe∣ment established by Parliament, was of more difficulty to effect, for the Prote∣ctor being by these blasts and combina∣tions awakened, became daily more cautelons, and fortified himselfe against such attempts by the forts of the Citi∣zens love, prudent deportment in go∣verning, and renowne of his friends; yet hee would not bee adverse to any counsell, tending to tranquility, if such a happy Star might appeare in that horizon. Much about this time Iohn Knox, ve∣ry famous for being a Temple Incendi∣ary, and an imitator of the Vandalls de∣vastations, under the pretence of Reli∣gion, ruinates the monuments of our Ancestors piety, suffering not so much as Church bells or leads to scape his sa∣criligious raving hands, a beaken apt to have put the whole Kingdome in a po∣sture of war.
These things thus upon the Stage, Morton extinguished the lustre of repute he had already lighted, and that he ho∣ped in the future to kindle, by the ob∣loquie of one infamous fact, which was thus: The Earles of Northumberland and Westmerland adjudging their case despe∣rate at home, fled privately into Scot∣land, that so they might either by flight or private lives divert the currant of pu∣nishment; Charles Nevill Earle of West∣merland sojourned at the house of Carr Farnihurst, or Buckclough, untill fearing the English Army under the conduct of the Earle of Sussex, he made his escape into Flanders, there spending the residue of his days in indigency. As for Thomas Piercy Earl of Northumberland (a man of auncient Family) the Lady Fortune (whose will is her law to rule by) gave him the ignoble and forsaken woods of Harcley for habitation, and his com∣rades were the Grames, infamous for robberies, who had a greater eye to per∣petrate wickednesse, then to keep their promise, they nefariously deliver this banished Earle lurking in Cottages, to Murrey the Protector, who least hee should be thought to desert his office or trust, dreaded to deliver him to be swal∣lowed
up of his enemies. But after that Morton being placed on the pinacle of honour, falling either by the errour of his minde, or longing after money, spontaneously delivered Northumberland (whom honour had made great, and to whom he stood engaged by the tyes of demerit) into the hands of Henry Cary, Baron Hunsdon governour of Barwicke, for some reward promised; But Nor∣thumberland (a branch of that great stock of Piercies) not long after was lopped off with the fatall Axe at Yorke: the fruit of so ungratefull wickednesse, the Protector received in the ultimum of his life, as if God punished such a fact. The knife of envy ere this had parted the Kingdome into two unnaturall fa∣ctions of Son and Mother, King, and captivated Queene; In this dissention many of the Nobility displaying the Banner of publique good, strove to ad∣vance their owne honour and potency; England and France were not wanting in frequent Missions to attract the oppo∣sites to accord, and lay downe their armes: But the French K. sent Monsieur Viriac Embassadour into Scotland, to see in what condition the Kingdome stood in and to supplant peace, if it lay with∣in
the virge of his effecting, which part he exquisitely performed for the Vizor of his Embassage permitted him not on∣ly to stand as spectator, but to act the somenter of War against the Viceroy. Queen Elizabeth on the other side per∣ceiving the plot was as diligent to coun∣termine him, which Shee did by dispat∣ching Henry Killegrew Embassadour in∣to Scotland, that he might do his ulti∣mate devoir in resisting Viriac by clea∣ving to the Protestants. The Protector delighting more in the pleasant streames of peace, then in the bloody waters of war, endeavoured in a long Oration made to the Nobles, to induce to concord, conjuring them by their fidelity and allegiance to bury in oblivion all private injuries, so to era∣dicate the thoughts of war, as that they should be had no more in remembrance, to remember the forgetting of all con∣troversies and discords, nor try the last of refuges; For which prudent mode∣ration, those who had not tasted of the bitter roote of affliction, congratu∣lated his endeavours, and desired God prosper him in this buisinesse. Killegrew the English Embassadour gave sincere de∣monstrations of his desires to reduce the
Kingdome into the haven of tranquilli∣ty: but Monsieur Viriac the French Ora∣tor, or rather the Guises Embassa∣dour, strives to launch her forth into the deepe of Civill broyles by his allu∣ring the Chiefes of Scotland to restore Popery, and violently re-establish the Queen of Scots in her Throne, assuring those of the French Faction (if their re∣solutions hold firme) should be assured of aide ere Long. After this many conferences of com∣posure were betwixt the ringleaders of either party, at last Truce was taken, and Perth appointed the place of conve∣ning: the love of peace and quiet, and loathing of war, are principles which nature hath endued us with: the time of consultation was not to be till the tenth of February, and till that day of con∣vening was come, all acts of hostility were to surcease, and so continuing till the Treaty ended. Neverthelesse William Kircade Lord of Grange, Governour of Edenburough Castle, whose fiery genius made a dis∣cord in this sweete harmony of civill concord: The Nobility of both Parties desired him not to be so averse in so
happy an opportunity for the Common∣nalty, nor to set the State upon the rack of discord, under pretence of siding with either Faction: but this wholsom counsell could not any wayes demoove him from his more desperate progresse: whether it were that hee was excited thereto by his confidence in that inex∣pugnable place, against which hee sup∣posed neither force nor art could so far prevaile as enter or demolish, it being provided with Ammunition and Victu∣all for a long siege. The Castle hath the advantage of an high rock inacces∣sable on every part, and fortified by a Fen or lake on the side, and a moate which surrounds it. It may be likewise supposed his courage was sharpned by the whetstone of hope which he fixed on the French Forces ready to come, whom he supposed would free him from all exigencies, in that he had sent his brother Iames Kircade not many dayes before into France to make knowne their condition, and implore them to send men and money; But how closely soever this crafty counsell was kept, yet it arived at the Regents eares, who knowing the Castle of Blacknesse sea∣ed on the banks of Forth, to be the
most safe and convenient receptacle for Kircade, covertly complyes with Alex∣ander Stuart the Governour thereof, who wanted  behaviour (though of the adverse party) and by faire pro∣mises, which were seconded with gifts, he drew him to serve his King, to stay Kircade, and seaze on the money at his returne, and the conclusion of this plot gave a just correspondency to the pre∣misses, for Iames Kircad returning from France with some 1000. crowns of gold to elevate the spirits of the Queenes party, sailed to Blacknesse, not having a thought of the Governours deserting their party, since hee had not long be∣fore solemnly vowed never to renounce it: thus did he throw himselfe headlong into the snare, where he was caught, and the treasure seazed on; Whereupon the Governour posts to Edenburough, that hee might acquaint the Viceroy with the successe. Now accurate Kircade knowing well that he was circumvented, and at the E∣nemies disposall, corrupted his keepers and watch with those few crownes hee had reserved, so that by the sodaine change of Fortunes wheele, and souldi∣ers perfidiousnesse who were on the
watch of a prisoner, he was metamor∣phised into a president, the keyes and custody being delivered him, thus he re∣payed the fraudulent man in his owne coyne. The Sunne had not twice runne his course ere Stuart with his unarmed com∣pany, not harbouring the least suspition entered, and by the souldiers whom Kircade had suborned for the betraying, was presently cast into prison: where having a guard set over him, was kept in fetters; But the tediousnesse of im∣prisonment caused him study revenge, and opportunity of alienating his Kee∣pers, and the souldiers affection from Kircade, so that he might entangle his adversary in the same net which so late∣ly caught him, he being dressed in the garbe of squalour and sorrow, made the indignity of his condition the subject of a dolefull story to fill some of the souldiers eares, entreating them by all those old tyes of souldiers fidelity, by those many hard-ships whereof he par∣ticipated with them, to commiserate his case, and repaire the breach of trust made by them or their Comrades, by ef∣fecting some noble exploit of trust; Lastly, to wipe off by some officions
performance, when opportunity might be their owne, those blots of disgrace injected upon that quondam Governour, the very deformity of their so closely circumvented, & depressed Governour, and the remembrance of his former dig∣nity, caused the common souldiers melt with pitty and compassion, and in this nick of time, Fortune presented a pat op∣portunity to the souldiers acceptance for innovation of their condition, and thus it happened: Kircade to demon∣strate himselfe a loving Husband, would with his maeniall servants accompany his Wife, departing from him out of the Castle: but he was no sooner forth, then hastily shot out by the combined souldiers, who brake open the prison doores, and caused a sequestration passe twixt the fetters and Alexander Stuarts leggs, setting him gently at liberty. He (Fortune delighting to play the Chame∣lions part) of a President became a priso∣ner, of a captive is become a Captaine, and the Castle (as if willing) to shew it selfe a changeling to day, it favoured this, yesterday the other party. While frequent betrayings, Peers re∣volting, & Regents murthers, infested the Kingdome, the most emminent of
either party wearied with the sustenta∣tion of so long and grievous dissentions upon the forementioned 10th. of Febru∣ary met at Perth, to consult about the reducing of the Kingdome to its former quiet. The Viceroy accompanied with others of the Nobility of the Kings par∣ty appeared; for the Queens party, there was present the Earle of Huntly the Queenes Vicepresident for the North parts of Scotland, with the chiefe of the Hamiltons, and the rest whose affections were conglutinated to her, there it was concluded by the interposition of Qu: Elizabeths power; After long debates had about the conjunction of King and Queen in Regency, that there should be a cessation from armes on both sides, and an act of perpetuall oblivion upon all offences committed, except the mur∣thering of the King, Murrey, and Lenox, Protectors: private wrongs were to be forgotten, least concord should be in∣fringed, and private and publique inju∣ries were to have their pardons, al mer∣cenary souldiers to be disbanded, save foure companies which the Regent was to keep on foote so long as the Parlia∣ment might conceive any profit accru∣ing thence to the Kingdome; all should
embrace the Religion professed in Scot∣land, acknowledge the Kings Primacy, and Supremacy, as well in Jurisdiction as Authority: that whatsoever should bee enterprized after the publication thereof in the Queens name, to be null, and of no validity, whether publiquely or privately acted. To fulfill these Ar∣ticles, both parties were bound by oath, delivering of Hostages, and other pled∣ges, so that civill dissentions grew slee∣py, and Peace was obtained by the Pro∣tectors speciall vigilancy and care: un∣till that the Lord Grange (a man rather blowing tempests then commodious breath) both despising the King and Viceroyes authority, not desiring the security of his Countrey, sought more for the opportunity of fomenting War, being fed with the maine hope of aid from France and Flanders. For no sooner was the Truce expi∣red, but he thundered with a minancing kind of noyse upon the City of Eden∣burough, infesting the Citizens with con∣tinuall excursions, making their houses sacrifices, by throwing granadoes and scalding pitch thereon; Hee sent such thundring Nuncios into the most fa∣mous streets in the City, as that scarce
any passed without extreame danger of his life. Nor was the Edenburgians much short of him in rage, after they had once taken up armes in defence of their City, For being set downe before the Castle, they cast up a slight worke, not ceasing night and day to raise Forts in such convenient places as might hinder the Castillians excursions, so that their City was not so much exposed to the fury of the merciles fire, although their houses were shot thorow, yet they walk in more security: to conclude, they turne the edge of Granges violence & fu∣ry, they divert the waters course, that in stead thereof, affliction might run in∣to the Castle: the diverting of which, and the mingling lime with the water in standing pools, caused many slight skir∣mishes; At the foot of the rock sweetly issued forth a fountaine of very pleasant water: to defend which, the besieged sallied out at a postern, erecting a bul∣work that might scouretheir water: & such as were wont to go up and down for water, the besiegert on the contra∣ry strove to cut them off from it, thus no day passed, wherein Mars did not display his bloody colours. A great slaughter there was of the common soul∣diers:
and one Captain, whose quarters was neare Cuthberts Church. Achison a Commander, while hee in the night carelesly walking the round, was over∣taken by a bullet, which summoned him and five more of the common sort to apeare at Deaths Court: The besie∣ged threw Granadoes, shot wild-fire, which lighting upon poore thatched Cottages, burnt them, and not far from the Westgate, many stately buildings with Ware-houses full of rich Merchan∣dize run the same hazard. The Citizens were surrounded with feare and care, supposing the City but fuell for Grge's ,  did pendent danger or timidity so much affright them, the fire being alwayes extingui∣shed by the care of their servants: or did the daily terrors trouble them so much, as did the urgent waves of care torture the Regents breasts: for though he had besieged the Castle, yet there was a fa∣mine of Engines offensive in his Camp. The Protector (least he should spend his time to no purpose) sent divers convenient men to divert the Gover∣nour from the Queenes party, and to embrace peace, and to this end proffers him very reasonable conditions? While
things were in a reasonable posture these instructions being given, the men whom Morton had selected to treat, set forward to meet, and treate with Peta∣row the Lord Grange's Nephew, betwixt Leith and Edenburough, where they mani∣fested the Regents great desire to avoid effusion of blood, desiring withall that they would surrender themselves, bee obedient to the Protector, acknowledge the Kings authority. But these Propo∣sitions had no other answer of the cou∣ragious young Gallant, then an obsti∣nate denyall and refusall, nor would he transact the negotiation of peace; The Treaty breaking off, both parties depar∣ted in great rage. The Scots being trained up in the Ac∣cademy of Mars, least (through idlenes at home, they should prove ill Profici∣ents) travelled into Holland, Swethland, & France: there giving many demonstra∣tions of valour, following Pallas close at the heeles. But while Edenburough was the stage of Warre, Mr. Iohn Knox, as if inspired by heaven, in a most eloquent Sermon, gives a prediction of the assaulting of the Castle, which as it was a goodly act, so it should want no lesse successe,
and that mad man Grange should come over the walls, and rubbish in a rope to treat, which succeeded according to his words. The French King sent Monsreur Crone to understand how affaires stood, who writ backe that Scotland & England were united by League, that his propositions of conjoyning the King and Queen in government, or tolleration of the Po∣pish Religion, would be null, besides it could not be effected without the High Court of Parliament, who had already removed her from the Throne, and ex∣tirpated Popery roote and branch, and that the Viceroy with the consent of the Councell, had sent the Queene and Roman religion into perpetuall banish∣ment. Queene Mary (a Lady of an undaun∣ted spirit) hearing hereof, excites all Princes to send aid, even of his Holinesse himselfe, and she privately covenants with the Guises to set her at liberty. Anno Domini 1573. Morton seeing the fiege prolonged, the Governours audacity, and the slow progresse in besieging, produced more to the befiegers, then to the besieged; withall considering that his
small forces were not potent enough to enter for a place every way fortified, sent to implore of England men and ammu∣nition, which was condiscended unto, upon these conditions, that the Viceroy should not make any composition with the besieged, without the Queens con∣sent, that he should not receive, protect, or succour any English Fugitives; and if the Castle should be surrendred, that what ever was in it, should be free boo∣ty for the besiegers, save what was the Kings Utensalls or precious Orna∣ments. The Protector being great with de∣sire to obtaine the Castle, grants all the Propositions. Not long after, the Eng∣lish Navy laden with Cannon, Engines of all sorts, powder and iron bullet, & other ammunition, rid at anchor in the Haven of Leith neer Forth, where the Sea stretcheth forth one of her armes to em∣brace the floods? Besides, William Dru∣ry Marshall of Barwick, marched into Scotland by land with 1500. Foot, who declared Her Majesties of England sincere love and ardent affection to Her Neigh∣bours of Scotland, and that they might give a candid manifestation thereof. This exployt was undertaken, the grea∣test
part of which charge and trouble Shee sustained her selfe, that they might restore them to their former freedome and peace: which ere they would not effect, their owne freedome and peace should run the same hazard, all which Shee hoped they would not forget to remember. The English and Scots having joyned Forces ere they mounted their Canon, sought by all meanes possible to have the Castle surrendred: but the Canons of treaty not making any breach in their breasts, they begin furiously to assault the Castle, so that 4. of the Castle Tow∣ers begin to tumble for fear: then moale like they undermined and raysed Tren∣ches upon the sharpe side of the hill. Since nature had prohibited the sur∣rounding it, Drury supplyed what e∣ver was desicient for opposing, so that no man might passe in or out of the Ca∣stle. That performed, hee mounts 30. brasse pieces, with which he batters the walls for foure dayes together without any intermission, so that in fine Davids Tower receiving many wounds, yeelds it selfe captive to ruine, and with an hi∣deous noyse layes its airy head on the ground, leaving the Defendant naked
to the ecemies fury: the first day when as yet there was scarce hope left of resi∣sting, while their bodies were not defa∣tigated, they valiantly received the charge, and maintained the breach, sen∣ding ever and anon Embassadours to death, or the Chirurgions, to tell them that the Messengers had shewed more of tumult then valour in entring the wals, art countermined art, and force was an∣swered with force, having hitherto en∣dured what cruelty could afflict. At last they begin to dispaire of their strength, either in that the Cannons sent such shours of lead (which watered their bo∣dies with drops of blood) or that the rocke brake, or their houses fell, or in that the number of their slaine and wounded were many, or that Captain Trotter was fallen, who while hee lived, made good the breach with his owne sword. The English perceiving their courage to be queld, filling the ayre with their cryes, sets ladders to the lower walls halfe ruinated, getting over, some few resisting, and those few ill armed for re∣sistance being already conquered with griefe, were beaten down; The souldi∣ers in the lower tower seeing themselves
not able to resist the insulting English, re∣tire into the upper, but no sooner there then assaulted with the distrust of their owne and the places debility, for they were dtiven into great straits by reason of the penury of water, which caused such debility of body, as they could not endare any more hardship. All was re∣solved now to yeeld, a parley was desi∣red, the next day Truce was taken, Hen∣ry Ley an English man, and George Fleck a Scot, Morton's Sisters son, were delive∣red as Hostages. The Lord Grange, Ro∣bert Melvine, and Petarow climing over the walls, for the gates were obstructed, (Knox his prophesie in this being ac∣complished) came to treat with Drury: Their demands were to enjoy life and security, but could obtaine nothing, save to yeeld themselves and all they had to the Queene of Englands mercy: In this pittifull plight and deplorable condition (seeing the laws of necessity must be obeyed) they yeeld themselves up the Conquerours pleasure, and the Queen of Englands mercy: the com∣mon souldiers laying down their arms were safely dismissed. After the Castle was surrendred, many considerable per∣sons were taken prisoners: among o∣thers
these were of speciall note, Alex∣ander Hume being the flower of his Fa∣mily, and in the flower of his strength, the Lord Grange a man couragious and valiant, Secretary Matlain renowned a∣mong strangers, and adored by such as knew him for his valour, with John his Brother, who afterwards was Chancel∣lour, whose youth was decked with sin∣gular vertue and excellency in Arts, es∣pecially with the immitation of his Brother, Petarow one of great authori∣ty and estimation amongst those of his owne Faction, Robert Melvine whose accurate ingenuity could sustaine the most weighty affaires; besides Cockman and Mosney two rich Citizens of Eden∣burough, and the renowned Countesse of Arguile, the late wife of James the fifth, who was the daughter of an Harlot. Thus skill and valour of the English in besieging, caused the Castle and 200. souldiers to surrender themselves in the space of 33. dayes; as for Matlaine, hee lay long under the tyranny of the gout and crampe, which ceased upon his wholebody. Natures candle being come to a snuffe, which was extinct by the breaking in of that vast Ocean of sor∣row and sicknesse while hee was in pri∣son
at Leith, or else he dyed voluntarily to avoid the enemies severity: he was a man whom nature had adorned with the accoutrements of accuratenesse and prudence, and would have exhibited the same, if Fortune (the over-swaier of humane counsells) had not delighted to make him like her selfe, blinde with publique calamities, but mortals are not cautelous enough to withstand Fortunes fury. It was reported that Matlain poi∣soned himselfe: after the Castles surren∣der, George Douglas the Regents Brother with a guard was sent to receive the treasure, guns, and the Kings Utensels, the souldiers according to the agree∣ment having the goods and treasure gi∣ven them for pillage, which the Citi∣zens had sent thither as to a most safe treasury. Not many dayes after, Queen Elizabeths pleasure was exhibited and made known, the Lord Grange and his Brother James were executed by the common Hang-man in the Marketplace of Edenburough, where the people dis∣played his gallantry in its colours, re∣lating how great & how many gulphs of dangers he had shut for the publique liberty, what attempts he had underta∣ken against the French and English, for
the safety and honour of his Countrey, when he was even ready to suffer death, no tongue suffered his former renown to be forgotten, notwithstanding all this, the sad remembrance of their City burning, being fresh in their memorie, cryed so loud in their eares, as they sought revenge by seeing him suffer: Mosney and Cockran, both Gold-smiths, took their journeys into another world from the Gallows, Queene Elizabeth obtaining of the Protector that the lives and estates of Hume, Petarow, and Melvin should bee preserved with the rest, onely their per∣sons shonld be imprisoned: by this act of clemency she became admired for mansuetude and mercy, Thus the English seting a period to those disasters, they came to quiet, (co∣ming thither by invitation of the Pro∣tector, and compulsion of Grange his rashnesse) leaves Scotland in tranquility, and with the losse of a few men retur∣ned with their prize to Barwicke. The raging stormes of civill war be∣ing overblown, the heate of killing, fi∣ring and spoyling were allaid. And now Morton to induce the bloody minded & warriors, to embrace peace, quiet, and
humanity, with great diligence educa∣cated the noble young branches in the liberall sciences, that the publique safe∣ty and Kingdomes tranquility might have firme foundation; he did not give any manifestation of grudge against the Hamiltons, who were in those days no lesse potent in power then allies, but rather labors to compose such differen∣ces as kept the Nobility disunited; & to this end calls a Parliament at Edenbu∣rough, in which, for the publique good, he suppresseth divorces, adulteries, pil∣laging, murthers, rapine, burning, rob∣bing, and luxurie, besides many acts he passed against cosenage in bargaining, and out of the rest selects a chiefe num∣ber (whom long experience had endu∣ed with knowledg fit for such underta∣kings) to consult about State affaires. Hee made all Malignants to become As∣pen leaves, austerely punishing such as had contaminated their hands in the late Kings blood, or were any wayes conscious thereof: he constituted Sir John Carmichell a gallant spirit, War∣den of the Marches, gave him an annu∣all stipend, and the command of so ma∣ny souldiers as might prohibite those violaters of humane institutions, who
casting off all obedience to the league, made incursions and wasted the borders of England: not to expatiate, he brought forth many hopefull blossomes for fu∣ture government, being of an honou∣rable presence, to receive the popular applause, in that he trod in the steps of moderation, not satiating or thirsting after blood, but with the sword of Ju∣stice cut away all corrupt matter where ever it was. This weather was too faire to conti∣nue long, for seeing himselfe to be in∣vested with command, hee lets loose the raines, riding after lust and cove∣tousnesse, making incursions into the Subjects coffers, & under the pretext of Justice, makes the Law denounce seve∣rity, that hee might the sooner fill the jawes of his greedy avarice. This so∣daine commutation exhibited as sodain rumors, for Fame now began to blast, rather then blazen his name. He called the Court Officers to such a strict ac∣counpt, as that they did not without some misery performe: having exhau∣sted their treasures, they were then to informe the Judges selected for that purpose, of all that had eaten flesh in Lent, who were commanded to appear:
and if they could not free themselves thereof by oath, the Judges pronoun∣ced them guilty of the breach of the Law, and inflicted punishment accor∣ding to the Statute, which the Prote∣ctor seldome or never remitted: but when he perceived the Commonwealth impoverished, he supposed it safer to in∣hance privately the Kings coine, then publiquely to gape after the Citizens e∣states. And now being Lord of an am∣ple fortune, he maintained his retinue with the dignity of moderation in food and aparrell, converting both publique and private riches to honour & magnifi∣cence, erecting that Palace of Dalkeith to his no small charge, adorning it with Tapestry and incomparable pieces of art, so that its splendor almost soars to a Majesticall statelinesse; he caused rich pieces of silver and gold to be coyned which to this day is hoarded up in U∣surers coffers: on the one side the gold bore King James the sixts Portraicture, with the inscription of In utram{que} para∣tus on the one side: on the other side was a Lyon rampant, Mars in a double tressure counter flowred, being the roy∣all Arms of Scotland within this inscip∣tion, Partere subjectos, et debellare super∣bos:
The silver pieces bore two swords with Trajans Motto, which hee to∣gether with the sword delivered to the Major of the City. Pro me si mereor, si non, in me. He was the first that brought the de∣triment of brazen coine to the Com∣mon-wealth: for the Scots before this had nothing currant but gold and silver, which now was corrupted both at home & in the Netherlands by the Merchants, who being slaves to their unjust gaine, transported the starling money into for∣raign parts. These his exactions were observed by an ingenious foole of his, Patricke Bovy, who used ever and anon to rub his Masters soares, as may candidly ap∣peare by this subsequent story. It so fortuning that some importunate beg∣gers beseeched the Viceroy to relieve their poverty: which being over-heard of the Foole, it was as earnestly begged to have these importunate fellows bur∣ned, which moved the Regent extream∣ly, so that he told him he was an un∣charitable man, not to shew mercy to those that so ardently sought it: here∣upon the Foole instantly replyed, what and if ye commit these as fuell to the
flames to day, ere the Sun shall run his course, to morrow you can make as ma∣ny rich men beggers, intimating there∣by that his rapacity being conjoyned to covetousnesse, eate up the Citizens fortunes. But in conclusion, having reduced the Kings coffers to a little purse, hee sets upon the Clergie, purposing to make them a bit to stay his hungry sto∣mack; Such Benefices as were vacant, the revenue being small, he bestowed upon any Protestant Ministers: but those of a greater' value were conditio∣nally given to Court Preachers that his clyents and favourites might have some annuall fruit of their labour; His spu∣rious brats were the enjoyers of Recto∣ries and other Church Beneficies which were no lesse faire then profitable; In this storme these were the barnes into which the spirituall mens harvests were gathered. But be pleased to go retrograde with me in observing the Churches Ataxy e∣ven from the beginning, for it is worth your review. Upon the Protestants de∣sire to Queen Mary for the sustentation of their Ministers, seeing all the spiritu∣alls were in the possessions of Papists:
Shee assembled the High Priests, the Prelates, and such of the Popish Cler∣gy as were of especiall note, admonish∣ing rather then entreating them, be∣cause reliefe could be no otherwise ob∣tained for the Protestant Ministers to put to their assisting hands: Shee was confident there was not any in that great Convention who would ether re∣fuse to relieve or excuse the Ministers poverty, which Shee desired might bee done willingly, in that the diminution of their fruits could not be done with∣out injury. The issue of the meeting was a setting a part of the thirds of Spi∣ritualties, with which her Majestie was to relieve the Orthodox Ministers, as if it were a meere donative; But the conclusion seemed to either party a col∣lusion. The Popish faction grievously complained that their wings were clip∣ped, the Protestants suppose themselves not at all sublevated by that affected munificence. After this a Remonsteance of the Mi∣nisters stipends is drawn up to the Pro∣tector Morton, which he seemes to take into serious consideration, promising to cut the Popelings avarice, and with if all cause of strife, dclaring that hee
would not be deficient in any thing ad∣vantagious to the Church, and that e∣very Minister whose life and doctrine were inculpable, should be supplyed with a competency of estate annually, if that the thirds might be granted His Majestie: The Clergie was induced by this pollicitation to subscribe to the compact, obliging them irrevocably to performance. The Viceroy catching the fish he angled for, knowing he wanted ability to perform what was promised, hee supposed it the best way (as the case stood) to commit the cure of 3 or four parishes to one man, that out of the reliques of the thirds might arise a great treasure: this he conceived to be the best gaine those times would af∣ford. But the Church (although in vaine) exclaimes that the convenant was infrin∣ged while hee made all fish that came to his net, the Ministers were instant and urgent with the Protector, declaring that to appoint Ministers for every Church, and more ample stipends ac∣cording to the agreement for every mi∣nister, was a matter no lesse requisite then of absolute necessity: he with great reluctancy after much debate, refers the
businesse to the Cuncel-table, to whom the Clergy exhibited their bill of com∣plaint against the Viceroy (men of pre∣valency in the State) declared their sence therein, but nothing was obtained of the Viceroy save delayes; the griefe of this repulse stuck so fast in the Clergies breasts, as that twixt them and the Re∣gent there was a cessation of friendship, which instigated them perpetually, and openly to chastise his libidinosity, dissect his avarice, and aggravate the matter by invectives: but all this winde would shak no corne, for their thun∣dring words was so far from terrifying of him, as that hee did not so much as stop their mouths. Much about this time (after a long perigrination) Andrew Melvine returnes to his native soyle (if my judgment fail me not) in the thre tongues, and other polite learning, was not inferiour to many, so exquisite in the Pulpit and lists, as the Andrepolitan Divines could not goe equipage: and in Saint An∣drews, both his doctrine and authority were more prevalent then any other mans, he being seasoned with the Ge∣vevian discipline, drew some young heads to embrace his opinions, of re∣orming
the Church of Scotland, accor∣ding to the Idea of Geneva, which hee prosecuted with such vehemency, as that his spleene begun to rise at the propo∣sall of any other Discipline, then that which he prosecuted, not at all calling to minde, that the Government of a Ci∣ty is different from the government of a Kingdome. But he supposed that if this Discipline should be established, he with some others of his associates, might steere the Ship of the Church of Scot∣land as they pleased; to effect which, he inveighes against the office of of Bishops openly in the Pulpit, defaming them so that they might be depressed, with what envy could inflict; hee professed that there was a parity in the ministery, and that Ministers were not inferiour to Bishops: and those Tenets were no soo∣ner broached then there were two sorts of men to drink it up; one was Laicks, supposing this the direct way to obtain Spiritualities into their own disposing; the other was Clergy, who by the slip of ambition grew higher in the desire of honour: these men inflamed the al∣ready incited people by their hot dis∣putes, and state-medling Sermons, which caused an unbridled and indomi∣table
licentiousnesse of tumults; a great part of Scotland had their affections conglutinated to erect the Geneva Di∣scipline, and extirpate Episcopall au∣thority and dignity: these vapours a∣rising caused a cruell tempest, which tossed the Arke of the Church. In this storme the Arch-Bishop of St. Andrewes and Glascow laboured with a strong hand against Melvine, administring such things as that season required. Adam∣son Arch-bishop of St. Andrewes, made his ingenuity shoot poynt blank at the Geneva Discipline, accurately confu∣ting it in the Pulpit, wounding Mel∣vin, and his Independentiall Tribe even to the soule, by the sword of his preaching: but the dissentions after long exagitation flew as high as the Vice-Royes eares; hee being a man without all controversie, who knew to fish in such molested puddles, was not much grieved at the Clergies clashing, supposing that in the future all Bils of complaints henceforth would arise from the Clergy: so that he by blow∣ing and fanning the fire of debate, ra∣ther forgeth destruction for them, then laboured to extinguish it; when as it became him to have fought against
these bold men by the dint of reason or chastisements, not to have permit∣ted their Antagonists to have beene blemished with bitter railings in the Pulpits, and freely to divest them of all the plumes of honour and dignity in the Convocation. The Orthodox party being afflicted by diuturnall mollestations, made pitti∣ous complaints of the injuries and con∣tumelies wherewith they were opprest, desiring the Protectors Auxiliatory hand against the Church disturbers; he by this time being defatigated with cōnivency, labours to take up the quarrell, putting them in minde of the assemble at Leith, where hee exhorted them to follow peace amongst themselves, not to raise any uproares under the pretence of dis∣cipline, not to innovate any thing in the reformed Religion, so long as the King was in his minority: for the Vice-Roy was not ignorant of the animosity and violence of these Disci∣plinarian Innovators: the Nobility plots, and the Clergies Pleibeian spi∣rits, determining so long as the least spark of composing their dissentions did but appeare, to endure all things: but his patience and former connivency
gave such fuell to the flames of the Ze∣lots fire, as that neither riches, autho∣rity, or counsell could extinguish; so that it had beene farre better never to have given them a sword, then after∣wards to have resisted them being so prevalent. Anno Domini. 1574. While these sparks of intestine dis∣sentions were rather raked up in em∣bers than dead: the Papists and such of the Nobility as were blinded by French presents, consulted more like so many Franticks then Counsellours to seize upon the Princes person, and so to carry him into France, and to disrobe the Vice-Roy Morton of his authority; But the Protector was not difficient in wit or prudence to divert those furious streames and imminent dangers: for as from the beginning he had protected the English party, so had he kept the French under his girdle; withall repo∣sing his whole confidence, and the kingdomes safety in Queen Elizabeth, as in a sure refuge, desirous to sift out what opinion those who were about his Majesties person had of him, re∣taining very harmlesse followers, who by their sugered and oratoricall expres∣sions,
even enchanted all tender eares. Now lest a gap might be left open to ambition, and his enemies hatred, he was vigilent over the Churches tran∣quility, the Cities safety, the king∣domes incolumnity, and his Majesties honour, and when the poore could find no redresse in their miseries from the Judges Tribunals, he constituted others to heare their complaints. Great was the respect he exhibited to George Bucha∣nan, one whom the Muses had adorned with their influences, more than any of his contemporanians, whose fame was augmented, by the speciall care demonstrated in educating King James, with all politick learning, and wisdom: nor did his respects rest solely in Bu∣chanan, but it extended it selfe to every good Tutor. But now you must be∣hold the Scene altered; for Morton heretofore intentive on publike af∣faires, now whether by human frailty or by the destiny of ruling became infla∣med with lust and avarice, polluting the secret Chambers of the pallace by the foule blast of adultery, and deflowring of Virgins, thinking thus to wax strong in pleasure, became
weake in body and authority: for hee was a frequenter of unseasonable riot∣ings, baths, and such places which art or nature had made delicate: and pre∣tending the insupportable ponderosity of the weale publike, he invents exqui∣site and nimble wayes of poling the Commons, and seeing that there was not any subject for him to exercise his sword upon, he pretended to lay Bark∣leyes wood equall with the ground, in that it was a receptacle of Theeves: and when the earth called for weapons, into whose hands she may pay her Tribute, hee called for all men who were able to beare Armes to march after him against this great Forrest, and all to be in readinesse at the sound of a Trumpet: but there being a fru∣stration of divers musterings, he gave over the expedition, disbanding such as were content to pay for their ab∣sence: but the rest continued in armes. Read the Bishop of Orkney disposing his whole estate upon pious uses, and maintenance of Students, was frustrate of his desire by the Vice-Roy, who made his Testament null and of no validity: (as if hee had authority to dispose of mens fortunes) threat∣ning
to inflict punishment upon the Executors if they should eudeavour to fulfill his Will and Testament: nor did he stay here, for in a most ravenous manner he invaded Houses, Lands and Treasure, confiscating the richest Mer∣chants estates, as if guilty of most hai∣nous crimes, defrauding them of their most proper goods. Nor did his rapacity onely catch flies, but he soared for great Fowles, such of the Nobility as were descended from ancient Progenitors, he oblitte∣rated with some blot or other of their Ancestors, which hee had collected from the leaves of Antiquity, exacting of them vast summes of money, which were as so many additions to enlarge his fortunes: but recollecting himselfe, supposing that the Nobilities love and mutuall amity were materiall props to uphold his sliding power, he begun to foment enmity, jealousie, hatred, and injuries amongst them, that so matter of offence (which consequently indu∣ceth punishment might be administred.) But although they were affronted by whole troops of contumelies, charged with multitudes of injuries; yet they deferred to seek revenge until opportu∣nity
was theirs, making temperance and wisedome their guides in this tem∣pestuous night. Lastly, this horse-leech exhausted so much treasure out of the veines of the body of Scotland, as his Coffers could well containe, stretching him∣selfe forth to embrace covetousnesse, and avarice, and this was all under the pretence of publike service: which not onely enriched himselfe, but also his favourites patrimony: also he sup∣posed that England might be within the line of his avarice; for he desired that some annuall stipend might be assigned to him, and those of his party: but Qu. Elizabeth was adverse to his desires, be∣ing seconded by her counsell; which denyall had the taste of an injury in Mortons pallet, so that hee laid it to heart. Anno Domini. 1575. Whilst domestick dissentions took a little rest, the Vice-Roy Morton begun to cast an eye upon the Publike, forti∣fying Castles, performing many good acts, according to the Counsels, desires, the beautifying of the Kingdome with inward and outward Ornaments of Market places, Regall structures, pal∣laces
Courts, finishing with Majesticall magnificence his building at Dalkeith; moreover he subdued that part of Scot∣land which is adjacent to Ireland, & re∣ducing the Aebudans to yeeld obedi∣ence to the Queen of England, he stops likewise all excursions into Ʋlster, ad∣monishing the Islanders to forbeare all acts of hostility against her Majesties subjects, or to intermeddle with the English government in Ireland. After this he summoned the Law∣yers in Scotland to assemble, (under the specious pretence, about the restriction of robbing on the Borders) but the event was to consiscate mens esrates, notwithstanding all other pretences: but the discovery augmented his ha∣tred, and diminution of authority. Thus whilst the Protector became vil∣lified for his avarice, a suddain accident happened, which administred cause of complaint to the English, and had well nigh been a Leak to let in whole floods of warre into the State: which was thus. Sir John Carmichel, the va∣lient Governour of Lidsdale, Sir John Foster, Governour of the middle bor∣ders; with the Governour of Barwick, Francis Russell, eldest sonne of the Earle
of Bedford, Sir George Heron, Cuthbert Collinwood, Henry Fennick; as also o∣thers of the Gentry in Northumber∣land, meeting on Redsquire hill in Ridsdale, on the confines of Scotland, where Sir John Foster there commander, begun to expatiate himselfe in the de∣triments which were incident to the English by the Scots, as that their goods were made booties: and after complaints made, there was not restitu∣tion; he insisted likewise on the deli∣vering of all Fugitives. But Carmigell retorts his arguments on him, layes o∣pen the grievances which the English had brought into the Borders by dis∣quicting them with plundering and spoyling. When these sharpe soares were in dressing, (haughty spirits not brooking a haughty word) 'twixt chi∣ding and striving arose a tumultuous hubbub amongst the Borderers, who had encompassed the Governours: in the dispute Carmichel was made Cap∣tive; Victory residing on the English brow; so that they tooke that oppor∣tunity to pillage the Scots of such things as were brought thither for sale; but while they gazed too much on plunder, and were hurried with te∣merity,
the Scots surprised the victo∣ry: for they raising the Countrey by their clamours, as they runne through Townes and Fields, gathered them∣selves into a body at Jedburgh; from whence marching towards the English, they made fury, and the sword hew a way through the sides of their enemies, to regaine their prey: the number of the slaine on the English part were ma∣ny, amongst the rest Sir George Heron, Knight, Carmichell espying the defeat, made his escape to the Scots, whom he encouraged to charge home: the flying English, lest that they should make a safe and faire retreat. The Governour Foster, Francis Russell his sonne in law, Cuthbert Collinwood, Henry Fennicke, and divers others perceiving an escape im∣possible, accepted of quarter, who were carried to the Regent at Delkeith; He received them with all courtesie, and after they had entred Bond to appeare at a certain day in Scotland, he sent them home with a safe convoy. But this disaster was no sooner ar∣rived at the Court, by the wings of Fame, beiug secouded by letters from the Governours own hands, then the Queens minde was lifted off the hinge
of patience, and hurried away by the violence of anger: nor did Carmichell's fact so much incense her, as the Prote∣ctors ambition, or rather negligence, besides the Scots, (whom shee had next under God) reduced to their pristine liberty, dignity, and safe tranquility, should against all law or right in time of Treaty fall upon the English; and to lead away in a triumphing manner Sir John Foster, with that hopefull and il∣lustrious noble youth Francis Russell, who sought onely to escape out of deaths jawes: Nay after all this to the contumely of the English Nation, force a subscription, and delivery of pledges for their returne, these were as so ma∣ny goads to drive forward her already incensed minde: the transaction here∣of put both the borders in a posture of warre, which were ready almost to joyne battle: but Morton shewed his ex∣perimentall prudence in accusing the English heady Governour, who caused the multitude run into this offence, in beseeching her Majestie not to condemn him, ere she heard him answer for him∣selfe, desiring her Highnesse remember his ancient demerits, and what great fires of trouble would have their being
from this spark of dissention, and how it might stand with her Majesties ho∣nour to raise a warre, which must be maintained with the blood of many of her loyall Subjects, and all for the of∣fence of a few: but if Shee would not lend an eare to his humble desires, then lastly let her but looke upon the com∣mon cause, which begs a defence of the peace betwixt the two Kingdomes, lest that Scotland having a deficiency of En∣glands ayd, might be necessitated to call in the French, that the hand of her be∣nevolence towards Scotland might not be contracted by reason of this sodaine tumult; he likewise declared that there was not any thing done by publique consent, but 'twas the fact of the Com∣manders and souldiers as imprudence or fury had precipitated, after the re∣ceipt of a dammage: besides it should be very perspicuous to her Majestie, that ere time was grown much elder, he would doe such good offices for her State, as might countervaile those in∣conveniences already happened, and as for questioning the Governour in Scot∣land, he answered that the President in Henry the 7ths Reign, was his apology: for when expiation of Sir Robert Carr
(that noble Knight and governour of the Middleborders) death was sought af∣ter, it was concluded that there should be a meeting held in Scotland, where the Governours had power to enquire after all misdemeanours, plundering, pillaging, and spoyling, and that to be performed without any dram of ha∣tred or envy. But the producing of such a hoary headed instance, rather stimu∣lated then repressed the Queens anger; for Shee supposed that this act of pre∣scribing a place of convening, was a staine cast upon her honour, and that it rather flowed from the Regents arro∣gancy of minde then otherwise; and to remedy these injuries, Shee askes advice of the Councell-Table which way shee should stear her course: some aggravates the complaints more then the rest, but all make such cruell and ingratefull in∣dignities as were done to her Majesties faithfull Subjects by the Scots, the sub∣ject of their exclamations; others again insisted upon the Regents haughtinesse, in deciding the controversie in Scotland, but all of them concluded, that so so∣daine a tumult (not worthy the menti∣oning) was to slight a cause for wage∣ing war. The Queen being overcome by
the authority of such reasons tending to peace, as her counsell exhibited, like∣wise perceiving that a great storm might fall upon Brittaine, arising from these fogs of dissention, Shee remitted the crime, and was reconciled, only requi∣ring that Carmichell might bee sent into ENGLAND, according to the Ar∣ticles before agreed upon. This though not without a certaine reluctancy of griefe, yet by a necessary compulsion was condiscended unto. The Viceroy seeing hopes of quiet were not within a kenning by any other ways, then con∣discention, went to the Boundrod in the confines of Scotland to the Queenes Substitute the Ea: of Huntington, where in most ample manner declaring the tu∣mults great crime, freeing the State from any such act, and denying that the League made betwixt the two King∣doms did oblige him to deliver up Car∣michel, notwithstanding lest he should be thought author of effusiō of so much blood, and raising so great troubles, he would deliver him according as the Privy-councell had advised, lest hee of himselfe might do any thing prejudici∣all to the State. Carmichell was guar∣ded to Yorke, where he rather tasted the
entertainment of a guest then of a pri∣soner, being afterwards dismissed with large rewards, and his return brought a return of his former honours, with an addition of Regency over the whole Marshes; the reinvesture caused him with a vigilant eye to overlooke the Con∣sines, rewarding all freebooters & peace∣disturbers with an halter for their la∣bour, the rest being terrified by the pu∣nishing of offenders, left their trade of ng, stealing, and theeving. The English entirely affected the Viceroy for restraining limitanean robbers. In this yeare the Preciscians forget∣ting their Ministeriall modesty, raging because no redresse was had about their stipends, were so presumptuous as to utter what ever their fancy dictated, or act what they adjudged convenient, but the Regents remembrance of the Trea∣ty at Leith, which was that there should not be any innovation in Religion, the King being in his Minority, stopt their mouths. In this yeare dyed James Hamilton Earl of Arran, and Duke of Castle-he∣rould in Poitier, a Prince descended of the Royall line, Grandchild to James the second of Scotland, after the death
of James the 5th. which was in the vi∣gor of his age, and Mary his daughter succeeding him in his Throne, had for her Protector; This James who was declared to bee Heire apparant to the Crown, a man he was of a milde and tractable disposition, who was ready to embrace tranquiilty and avoid trou∣ble, if that turbulent spirits and faw∣ning friends had not dimoved his mind from its naturall hinges, who more re∣garding their owne ambition then his honour, drew him from his retyred life to undergoe the publique government after his transvection of Mary Qu: of Scots into France, there to be espoused to the Dolphine, where he was created Duke of Castle-herault, and Captain o∣ver a troop of Horse, armed cap-apee: but after he had laid down the Scepter of his authority he tooke, was reinve∣vested with his former nature, being far removed from Courtly ambition: He was every way happy, so that hee began to doate on the sweete running streams of Glott, and peaceably passing over the remainder of his dayes in the company of his friends and Favourites at his owne house: but the boysterous Kingdoms disturbing blasts would not
suffer him to enjoy his rest and quiet, for he that was of unblameable repute, of the Royall blood, and renowned Ancestors, as much as in him lay de∣fended the life and fame of Queen Ma∣ry against her rebelling Nobles: al∣though George Buchanan the most re∣nowned writer of Scottish affairs (whe∣ther his instigations were from his owne malice or others I know not) in∣terpreted this his milde disposition in a contrary sense, upbraiding him with imbecillity and sloth. From this root proceeded foure branches male, James Earle of Arran, John Claud, and David, whereof three (being infected with an hereditary disease derived from their Mother) became frantick, John was adorned with mildnesse, and mu∣nificence left behind him a young twig, which excelled in inward and outward habiliments. Claud being the staffe and hope of his Familie, ere that madnesse had seized on him, was fruitfull in the production of many tender branches. Anno Domini 1576. The angry Commons and incensed Nobilities fulminations, nothing ter∣rified the hated Vice-Roy from his mo∣ney-getting way, but that he will make
the receivers be account ant to a Boddel for the customes: his avarice was not locked up in the Exchequer, or Reve∣nues; for setting the Citizens affecti∣ons to sale; and trampling upon his owne fame, he caused intermission of Commerce by reason of his immoderate exactions, and perpetuall troubles. But lest hee might appeare secure, he set his thoughts on the Publike, expelling the Grames beyond the River Eske, and brought into subjection other Brambles which cumbred the king∣dome; as for such Border-robbers which stole onely to satisfie Nature with ne∣cessaries, or such as were fostered up in idlenesse and sloath, being nourished by the hopes of plunder, he labours to reduce those by the manuall Trades of Husbandry, or other imployments: and in all parts of the Kingdome in∣flicted punishment upon offenders, re∣straining others from the like misde∣meanours by the magnitude of punish∣ment; he placed Garrisons on the Mar∣ches for the restraint of incursiōs, which the Borderers made, and robbing of tra∣vellers; he placed likewise Garrisons on the Frontiers next England, for the restraint of any sudden commotion:
constituting Archibald Douglas Earle of Angus, the top branch of that family, (whose youth was condecorated by the sweetnesse of his Genius) Governour over the Marches, who lest hee should be branded with remissenes, marched straight way to Dumfreis, hindering the Annandailes Incursions, compelling the ring-leaders to sweare obedience and fidelity after that they had delive∣red pledges, he receiued them into fa∣vour, so that he setled peace, and ma∣naged the rest by delicates while he re∣turned to the Protector: the long tract of secure peace had so mollified the turbulent and disquiet spirits, as that they either betooke themselves to exe∣cute civill affaires, or feast themselves with the banquet of peace. Whilst these things were in agitation, his bosome friends, and the Earle of Angus, whom modest ingenuity and innate comity adorned, denounced ap∣parent ruine, heavens vengeance, and ingruent dangers to the Regent, un∣lesse he would exonerate the commu∣nalty and Nobility of those insuppor∣table exactions, which would bee an unspeakable comfort to all, whose continuance would be cause of Civill
warre: but he being hitherto dandled in Fortunes lap, madly neglected their desire, answering the Nobility with en∣vy, the Commons with contradiction, seeming not to feare the Moon-like face of variable Fortune, who never gives kingdomes of felicity, without Empires of envy. Morton whom pow∣er, wealth, and honour had made sublime, yet was set out as a white for malice to shoot her arrowes at, by the inconstancy of fortune, whose recrea∣tion it is to tumble the highest stones lowest: or by his owne negligence who had metamorphosed a moderate go∣vernment into pride, and avarice: e∣very mans mouth now is expanded in defamations, as against one who had practised unlawfull pleasures, fornica∣tion, adultery; nay in one word to say all, all kinde of wickednesse: his lust brought forth the childe of covetous∣nesse, which gaped, and with an ar∣dent longing after the Citizens estates, he called an assembly of Lawyers, which rather had an eye to the greatnesse of the Fee, then the goodnesse of the cause, so that you might have heard more men condolling for the extracti∣on of their estates, then of their bloud.
I will not commemorate the many ex∣actions of money, which were impo∣sed by the rigour of Law, the more prudent were alwayes against such gaine, because they produced hatred; but whatsoever Fame may pratle, 'tis evident as the Sunne in his length, that he was more servile to his avarice then anger, that the most rich were his prey, that his judgement was more directed by the heapes of gold, then heinousnesse of Delinquents crimes; that the least offences many times bore the greatest punishments; that he faith∣fully observed the League with Eng∣land; that hee caused money of the greatest value to be coyned; that hee adjudged 'twixt opposites with all e∣quity, and that hee honoured Justice, and Piety: those things he performed for the publike good; other things were acted as private malice dictated, which made demurres in his magnifi∣cent performances: his eyes sparkled with anger against the whole race of Hamiltons, whether innocent, or no∣cent, besides that hereditary hatred they bore to the Douglasses, he dreaded them as fatall enemies to him, accor∣ding to the warning given him by an
old Propheticall Rhime, admonishing him to take heed of the Earle of Arran, which dignity long continued in the flourishing family of the Hamiltons: but he supposed that danger was pri∣vately denounced by the Hamiltons, the major part whereof he banished, who stepped aside into England; but his hu∣mane machinations would not divert the punishment so divinely revealed, for he being by James Stuart Earle of Ar∣ran accused of high Treason, was be∣headed, as shall be apparent in the se∣quell: he summoned Calen Cambell of the Noble Family of Arguile, a man of a sharp wit, to appear on such a day; upon which he not appearing, adjudged him to be proclaimed Rebell: Arguile affirmed the judgement was illegall, since neither the place or day appointed stood with his safety in appearing, nei∣ther did it appertaine to the Vice-Roy to adjudge of such matters: this in∣cited Arguile to let loose the reines of his anger, supposing he had now got opportunity to suppresse the Regents pernicious and intollerable power. He therefore with the Earles of Atholl and Montrosse, who were of a combined so∣ciety, accompanied with a great retinue
went unto the King at Sterlin, where finding him with a small number of at∣tendants, they drew up a Remonstrance of such grievances as the Vice-Roy had imposed, to the diminution of the Kings power, painting them forth in contumelious colours; they were secon∣ded by such friends, and fit instruments as were then resident at Court, few of Mortons Favourites were present, nor those who were present could excuse such hainous criminations and blots as had been objected: all rather dissimula∣ting his vertues, commemorating his delayes, and iniquities, his multitudes of exquisite delapidating arts, and his defatigating the Countrey by Taxes; but the more prudent Nobility perswa∣ded them not to disturb the kingdome by taking up Armes, since such things might be redressed more conveniently by treaty. But Arguile would not cease to inculcate, and that with great li∣our and malignity Mortons accusati∣ons, for waxing proud by reason of the trust he was invested in. The King with a childs modesty answered, that neither hee nor his Counsell could judge of a cause, until they had heard the matter agitated; and to that end he
dispatcheth Letters 'twixt ambiguous feare and anger unto Morton, that he should with all speed repaire to the Court, there to answer such things as should be objected against him, con∣cerning the managing of the Kingdoms affaires. Morton considering that there was no safety in going alone, did there∣fore a long while protract his appea∣rance by various delayes, calling his friends to Counsell, which was the best way for him to steere his course; divers were their opinions, according to the diversities of his Favourites in∣genuity: some, as if feare had taught them language, desiring him to have respect unto his owne security, lest his Regency, which he could not long re∣taine: others againe; seeing the dis∣ssention 'twixt him and Arguile was ci∣vill, that it might be by some reason∣able conditions accorded, which if it could be effected, they proposed it as a more safe way: this opinion was ge∣nerally received of them; as that mode∣rate men were imployed to make up the breach 'twixt the Vice-Roy and the Earle; they importnately importuned Arguile to desist from further accusing, and to betake himselfe to his former
friendship, but he was deaf on that eare, unlesse that Morton would voluntarily resigne up the Regency; the Protector perceiving the hatred of Arguile to be inexpiable, and that the matter was not to be transacted by friends, he seperates himselfe from his enemies power, pon∣dering with himselfe how great a fall it was to have a cadency from Majesti∣call magistracy, to live a private life. In this boysterous tempest the Preci∣scians, whose pursuite was alwaies after innovation, knowing that the Vice∣royes authority was daily villified, they publiquely anatomized his words, acts, and counsels. He commanded the Arch-Bishops of Glascow and St. Andrews not to shew obedience to the Synods de∣cretalls: against which command the whole body of the Clergy (as I may so speake) bent their forces, exagitating in the Pulpit his avarice, luxury, and lust, which were very delightfull to the Auditors eares: hence arise an alie∣nation of the Commons and Nobles affections from him, who had admi∣nistred cause of offence to many of them. The men that stood up in his de∣fence, were only the Ea: of Angus (who
was allyed to him by blood) the most renowned of the Douglases, and Carmi∣michell with his armed troops, who ex∣horted the Protector valiantly to sub∣due the Commons to his authority, for the establishing of Religion, pre∣servation of his dignity, and reteining of his posterity: thus Carmichell seemed to foment war, detesting in most op∣probrious manner the pride and arro∣gancy of Arguile, as the sole disturber of the publique tranquility, unlesse Morton would divest himselfe of that most envied title of Viceroy. But the Protector could not condi∣scend to Carmichell in this, least that a∣ny cause of a war might be administred, telling him that he reposed more con∣fidence in his innocency then in magi∣stracy, to reverberate the poyson'd darts of his accusators: and withal said, how that it even pierced his reines to heare that his magistracy and authority was contaminated by the tongues of men so prevalent in the Pulpit and Con∣vention, seeing he had exhibited him∣selfe a most strong defender of Religi∣on and Ecclesiastical Order, that it was his whole endeavour to establish Reli∣gion in that forme which the Primitive
times had used, to elevate men as their learning and piety required, to have the word of God sincerely taught by able men, to cause unity flourish in the Church: but these disturbances threw all off the hinges in Scotland. Anno Domini, 1577. King James being defatigated by the quotidian complaints and suppli∣cations of Arguile (yet lest he might be thought to enterprize th least matter without the Nobles advice, or which had not presidence) called a Parlia∣ment, summoning the Peers to appeare at Sterlin upon the 10th. of Mrch, where he proposed the injuries & com∣plaints of Arguile to be examined: but the Viceroy in that he had not potency to swim against the streame of his ene∣mies faction, determined to be as sent both from Parliament and City, that so the State might not be molested, nor this meeting produce tumults, and to this purpose sent Archibald Douglas Ea: of Angus, John Glame Chancellour, William Ruthen Treasurer, and John Harris Barron, with Instructions to de∣molish such structures of criminations as his enemies had erected. Those of the more prudent Clafis
bent their whole endeavours to reduce the factions, to embrace concord, and couserve the Viceroys dignity the high flown disposition and fierce hope of Arguile, could not descend to the matter propounded, so that the way of Treaty could not reconcile so potent Antagonists. Arguile in a full House of Lords and Commons, commemorates the Prote∣ctors unpresidented decree against him, appealing therein to His Majestie and Nobles, defiring them to divest Morton of his office, proceed against him as a publique disturber, and cause of all these distractions. He no sooner had sate down, then Angus whom indignation had incensed, prostrating himselfe at the Kings feete, humbly desired His Majestie to give him leave for speaking in the defence of the absent Protector: hereupon His Majestie conferred with the State, com∣manded him answer what he could; he then undantedly complained that Mor∣ton (a man every way deserving of the weale publique) was opposed by an ar∣my of calumnies, which speak in no o∣ther language then untruths and envy, next hee exposed to their view, how
much of danger was eminent if Arguil's haughty contumacy went scotfree, who had so often contemned His Ma∣jestie and the Regents authority, who was either ringleader or confederate in many civil commotions, in those parts of Scotland adjacent to Ireland: he like∣wise requested the Honourable houses not to be too credulous in any matter against the upright innocent Protector, nor yet suffer defamations, or any un∣just criminations which maligning spi∣rits might produce to his harm, but ra∣ther counterballance them with those his many and inestimable demerits (whereof they all could attest) for which the Common-wealth stood en∣gaged to him. The deprecators & Nobility of the adverse party were more prevalent with the King, then the objected crimi∣nations; amongst other things it was voted to have him deposed: hereupon the Chancellour Glaymes desires the sufferages of all the House, and in fine, he declares that by Vote Morton was to relinquish both Magistracy and Juris∣diction: thus the fortune of one houre overturned the felicity of many yeares. After this the Nobility then present
(lest by procrastinations new uproars might arise) desired His Majestie to write to Morton how that he might be as advantagious now to his own secu∣rity, publique tranquility, and the No∣bilities request as heretofore, when he was invested with full Jurisdiction and Regency, dispatching the Chancellor Glaymes, the Treasurer Ruthen, and the Lord Harris to the Regent, for the ob∣taining a voluntary resignation of his Protectorship which might appease the emulators fury, who could not brook the altitude of his potency; and upon his abdication of Regency, the King promised to discharge him of all ac∣counts concerning the Protectorship: the alternate letters of His Majestie and the Viceroy are extant. Morton expending his own potency, and the power of ingruent fortune, fea∣ring lest an addition of contumely should be incident with the amission of his estate, to the no lesse envied then la∣borious title of Regent, desiring to spend his hoary age in private security and quiet, having got his quietus est, of so well a governed Common-wealth, the publique faith being by His Majesty interposed for security, which he wold
confirm at his arrivall at 21. yeares of age: He delivers up his Regency in the presence of Glayme, Ruthen, and Har∣rais Councellours, withall delivering the Crown, Scepter, and the other Re∣gall Vestments to the Earl of Angus, with command of a presentation ther∣of to his Majesties own hands, which was performed in a great convention of the Nobles, who with an univocall cry professed his sidelity, and being au∣thorized by Morton, and the rest of the Nobility, invested his Majestie there∣with, who having not yet attained to the years of youth in this turbulent & miserable season, took upon him to sway the Scepter, proclaiming that the solemnity of his Coronation shonld be celebrated at Edenburough, which was most welcome news to the people, and joy to the whole State: In this concourse Morton by his pleasant smiles, filled the Edenburgians hearts with ineffable joy, protesting that he did not relinquish his authority which was conferred by act of Parliament for any imbecillity of minde, or his adver∣saries potency, but he spontaneously had delivered it up with all fidelity, & obsequiousnesse, for the publique quiet,
after his resignation, 500. Gentlemen, with a multitude of others guarded him home, who extolled his care of the publique good; thus Mortons authori∣ty was extinct by the overpowring hand of his adversaries. The Nobles assembling at Court, do institute Trimestriall Councellours, who were to propose to the Councell-Table whatsoever his Majesty was to negotiate, and these men were to be elected by the Parliament, alwayes to be ready at Court to direct and protect his Majestie in all consultations and authority, for the King did not do any thing either publike or private, but such things as these assistant Nobles, who as Tutors, should approve of; such as were chosen enter upon their Office at Sterlin, and Clientwise they execute their quotidian Offices, being probationers of the young Kings be∣haviour, indoctrinating him how hee ought to demonstrate himselfe a Prince and Patriot to his country; the three months of their function being at an exit, others of the Nobility, whom prudence and vertue had given Supre∣macy over the rest, were constituted Guardians, with the like authority as was granted to the former.
In the interim Morton devoid of dig∣nity, began to wallow in the myre of pleasure, sometimes reposing himselfe at Dalkeith, other whiles enjoying such delights as the banks of Bodotry or Fife produced, where he was accompanied with young spirits of noble extract, o∣ver whose Nonage he had constituted Guardians. The above mentioned Commissio∣ners were again sent unto Morton, who had the fruition of a more tranquill & solitary living in his retirement at Dal∣keith, where they declared His Maje∣sties and Councells pleasure to him, not once dreaming thereof, that he should deliver up the Castle of Edenburough with all the Appurtenances which he had received, and also the stamps for the coynage of money; he upon the hearing re-delivered the stamps: in the businesse of delivering the Castle, he was backward; the Delegates no soo∣ner perceived Mortons procrastnations then they declared that the place was not for tergiversations against Princes; withall desiring him to beware of an∣ger and impetuosity, and to cast his an∣chor of hope rather in the equity of his cause then in armes.
But the Commissioners receiving no answer correspondent to their desires, departed, commanding the Edenburgi∣ans to do their endeavour in preserving the city from detriment, in looking to their own and childrens safeties; here∣upon the Citizens set a most strict guard with a prohibition of publike and pri∣vate reliefe to be allowed for the Gar∣rison souldiers. Hence issued a greater flood of division twixt the Castillians and Citizens then before: this grew to a tumult, in which were slain some few of either side, but many wounded, be∣cause the uproar was without any lea∣ders: at that time it so fortunately hap∣ned that George Douglas was both Go∣vernour of the Castle and Provost of the City, so that he with the four Bai∣liffs at length appeased the people for that time, untill the memory of the slaughtered was a whetstone to set a sharpe edge upon the Edenburgians, so that they surrounded the Castle. The State being put into this turbu∣lent posture, Andrew Earl of Rothese, Ruthen Tresurer, and the Lord Harris were sent with instructions to Morton from the King and Councell, to admo∣nish him to relinquish his pertinacy,
and that his too much confidence repo∣sed in one Cale should not incite∣him to runne the hazard of a dubious and unnecessary wr which might cause the common peoples affections to be e∣stranged, and their hearts ebulliate en∣vy against him; whereupon he consults with some of his friends about the de∣livering up of the castle: but the Com∣missioners returning to Sterlin, related to His Majestie what had beene inci∣dent. Much about this time David Lindsey Ea: of Crawford, and John Leon Earle of Glaymes, Chancellor (men whose birth made them move in an high Sphaere) were Dissonants, not Consonants: the discord arised from a controversie a∣bout their bounds, and fostered by en∣vy, and abitter emulation twixt their followers, insomuch that they were at deadly feud. Glaymes for his paciferous wayes, mercifull judicature in the civil Law, prudency and moderation, was held in great repute; the other being nervous by his strong affinities of noble descent, and great atchievements, his e∣legancy of behaviour, magnificence, & riches, advanced him to the title of Craford; but as his life was inquinated
with luxurie, so Glayms his dayes were adorned many, and those egregious ho∣nours being a pattern of gravity and dignity. It so fortuned that an unhap∣py altercation was incident at Sterlin twixt their Followers, which came to that height that a hubbub was made, in which Glayms was slaine by a bullet: He no sooner was dead then the dignity of Chancellour was translated upon Athol, one as he succeeded in place so according to the common account in vertue and prudency; the atrocity of Glaymes death, excited the mindes of most well minded men: but above the rest Thomas Leon was a most eager young gallant to revenge his Uncles death, o∣ver whom was constituted a Tutor, who strove to make fire and sword avenge his and his Families injuries, making many devastations into the Lindseyes countrey, nor lesse bitter was the en∣deavours by the adverse party. These depopulations arriving at Court, caused the King by the autho∣rity of his Councell to dismisse Dele∣gates, which might declare a cessation from further acts of hostility, so long as the matter might be descided by law. In conclusion Craford being apprehen∣ded,
was cast into prison for the death of Glayms; yet by the earnest and ardent de∣sires of the Nobility, not long after was safely dismissed as he returned through Angus, the Inhabitants congratulated his Freedome: this was like a new fuell to inflame Glayms Tutor unto so vehe∣hement anger, as that Craford all his life was glad to stand in a souldiers posture. The deposing of Morton exalted the precisian hopes, in erecting the Gene∣vian Discipline, and diruating the Epis∣copall wealth, so that Pastors, Deanes, and Superintendents should rule; these mens endeavours had been furstraneous by the procrastinations and delayes of the Viceroy, while the King was under his protection. Upon this a Synod was held, wherein the cherishing of faction was more agitated, to the prejudice of his Royall Majestie, then matters of divine Worship: there the Ministers de∣creed that the Regency of Ecclesiasticall affaires should be managed by Superin∣tendents, declaring that Bishops ought only to take care of one Church, not execute Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction, re∣linquish Episcopacy, and omit the dis∣pensation of divine duties. The King by the interposition of his
Councells-authority, withstood the Synods decree, by revokeing the busi∣nesse to his own breast. In the conflict about the Prelaticall Jurisdiction, the Arch-Bishop of Saint Andrews was the valiant Champion to defend their cause and dignity, besee∣ching with more then fiery zeale, that the dignity whose institution was di∣vine, whose power for so many ages together had stood inviolated in the Church, might not now suffer ship∣wrack by this precise party. But the adverse cause had for their Captaine Andrew Melvin, a man famous for Divinity, yet give me leave to say his precipitate minde and anger over∣swayed his prudency: he vindicated an equality in the Ministeriall function, and liberty in the Church, admonishing the Bishops to be of humble and meeke spirits, neglect riches, not to follow the streame of the times, hungring af∣ter wealth and power, nor let pride or arrogancy domineer: for Religion and the true Worship of God would bee shipwrackt unlesse men tooke downe their top-sailes of pride, insolency, arrogancy, unlesse they would cast o∣verboard their lugga of riches, pow∣er,
and honours; remembring that na∣ked they came into the world. But his Majesty could not away with Melvins proceedings, because he withstood the Prelaticall dignity, and arrogantly en∣deavoured to pluck the Plumes of the Churches ancient authority, seeking to erect a Statue of honour from the ruines of the Bishops disgrace. Thus sick and ill disposed was the Churches estate; and although the pre∣cisians were prevalent in number, yet there was not wanting Nobles who stood as pillars to uphold Episcopacy; the King having communicated the bu∣sinesse to his Counsell, and hearing their determinations, made answer to the Antiepiscopall men, that hee would himselfe governe the fainting Church; that they ought to infuse and instill piety and subjection into the peoples heares, abstaine from innovating any thing, to follow peace and concord, re∣verence Bishops, and not be authors of dissention in these tempestuous dayes: this answer being given, there was not any to whom it was not conspicuous, that the Authority of Episcopacie would rather be augmented, then de∣minished whilst his Majesty was at un∣der age.
Thus the matter was crushed by a hand of moderation for the present, so that no other remedy was to bee had but patience, when all hopes of redu∣cing the Clergy to accord was relinqui∣shed: it seemed good to the King, and his most renowned Nobles to declare their determinations about these pre∣sent distractions, and admonish the Clergy not to make any further pro∣gresse in the division: the Episcopall party answered, that they were ready to submit to his Majesties command, but their Antagonists were altogether re∣fractory; continually after in a furious manner ensulting over the Bishops in their pulpits, as if they arrogantly more eyed their own commodity and profits, then their sheeps safety: an arrogant act of ministers: for what can be more ar∣rogant, then for an ordinary Clergy∣man, to teach the Bishops in matters of Religion. Thus you see many and vehement were the Contentions 'twixt Melvin, and the Arch-bishop of St. Andrewes; the Arch-Bishop answered Melvin, (who contumaciously and haughtily railed against Bishops in the open Schooles) with such an ex tempore elo∣quence,
fervency, and gravity, defending the honour and dignity of Prelates, as that hee easily attained the applause: Melvin after this neither would, neither was able to encounter with the Arch∣bishop in publike, in that he saw him∣selfe overcome by eloquence, but stri∣ved to contaminate his life by a Satyri∣call Epigramatizing, stirring up the peoples hatred against him, omitting nothing which might any ways diru∣ate the Bishops authority. This bit∣ter way of preaching, excited the tem∣pest to that boysterousnesse, as the Church of Scotland was almost over∣whelmed in the Kings Minority; for it laid a gap open for all dissentions to enter in. Anno Domini. 1578. George Duglas, base brother to the Earle of Morton, being denudated of all aid which might manage the Castle of Edenburough, knowing likewise that there was an irreconcileable hatred fo∣stred in the Edenburgians against him, he begun to feare, least that the sight of the Garrison souldiers should rake up the coals of revenge in the Citizens hearts, and cause them burne to the height of a Plebeian commotion, to avoyd which
he dismissed his men by a devious po∣sterne; after that delivering up the Ca∣stle, with the Ammunition, Furniture, Pearles, Jewel, and Robes unto A∣lexander Erskin of Gogaran, whom the King (in that he saw modesty, hone∣sty, and fortitude advanced in his soul) made to be Lieutenant of the same: he both for his owne memory, and others satisfaction, took an Inventory of such things as were left in the presence of Ruthen, Treasure, the Lord Lindsey, and Alexander Hay publique Notary. The government of the state being a burthen too sad for the Kings tender shoulders, caused a Convention of the Nobles to be summoned, to consult a∣bout the administratiō of the kingdoms affaires, which was put into the hands of the most renowned, the Earls of Ar∣guile, Atholl, Montrosse, Catnesse, the Lord Lindsey and Harris; to whom were adjoyned an equall number of the most eminent Clergy, and men of espe∣ciall note about the Court, Ruthen Lord Treasurer, the Abbot of Dumferlein, Se∣cretary, George Buchnan, Keeper of the Privy Seal, Murrey of Tilliberdine Comp∣trouler of the Kings house, James Ma∣gill Master of the Rolls; and they were
to continue in their places untill his Majesty arrived at maturity of age: these men as skilfull Pilots steered with such art the Common-wealth, as that for a while matters succeeded with more serenity: their eares were open to heare the complaints of the poore, whose faces were grinded by the tyrannous oppression of the mighty, and under their wings they shrouded themselves: many other Lawes were made as pillars to confirme the state of the kingdome, amongst the rest, whatsoever Grants, Charters, Letters Patents, Immuni∣ties issued from his Majesty, not ha∣ving approbation of six of his Coun∣sell, and the Subscription of the Lord Chancellour, were to bee of no va∣lidity. In these tempestuous blasts appeared that preheminent vigilancy and indu∣strie, which Atholl Lord Chancellor had over the weale Publique; the execution of the Lawes were his exercitations, his Princes safety, created him watch∣full; and he gave many demonstrations of an egregious and faithfull Counsel∣lour; and that the rather because the Earle of Morton, who having eased his shoulders of the burden of the King∣domes
affaires, not swimming against the streames of envy and fortune be∣took him to his retirement at Dalkeith, where hee disburdened his body from labour, his minde from perturbation, being no wayes molested by any Court ambition, affirming that the admini∣stration of the state matters, and do∣mination over terrene businesses was an Atlantian imposition: and these were no Claudestine speeches: yet the sting of his injuries still yeelded so much puru∣lant matter, as that his machinations were privately to foment and foster su∣spitions amongst those of noble extra∣ction, making their divisions his gain; and to accomplish his ends, he encoun∣ters with that thrice noble and famous young gallant John Earle of Marr, with no superficiall craft; for hee told him that his Unckle Alexander Erskin, (who was growne great by the additions of Fortune, and the Princes Education) did exclude him from all hope of ho∣nour, so that it stood him in hand to be no more a Dor-mouse, but as the top branch of that noble Family, to awa∣ken, lest these priviledges purchased by his Ancestors hands should be depo∣sited in his Uncle, a thing inconsistant
with his felicity: the words of Morton, who for his singular prudency was e∣steemed both by the Commonalty, No∣bility, and Clergy an Oracle, were pre∣valent over the novice spirits of this young Nobleman, (who had a Geni∣us ingenuous, above the ordinary le∣vell) so that he became incensed against his Uncle Alexander Erskin, because he had without any respect shewed to the Earle of Marr, behaved himselfe as the chiefe of that Family, and usurped the Princes Tutelage: this active gal∣lant takes his way towards Sterlin with a traine of friends and servants of no small number, not at all declaring whither his intentions tended; but presently possesseth himselfe of the Ca∣stle, apprehends his Uncle Alexander, who either was taken at unawares, else betrayed by some of his followers; so he laid downe his Office of governing the Castle, and Prince at once. The Earle of Marr likewise acting rather by force than Counsell, detrudes Arguile from his Trimestriall observancy, and to those of his servants who were super∣lative faithfull hee committed the Castle: in this Commotion there set a starre, (I would have said) the gallant
and illustrious sonne of Alexander Ers∣kin, falling into a violent Fever; or if the conjectures of others may be of au∣thority, the resentment of his fathers calamities penetrated his soule so deep∣ly, that he departed this pilgrimage. This subitaneous and boysterous disaster being carryed abroad by the wings of Fame, caused the Nobility & Counsell to meet in a hostile manner at Sterlin, where foure dayes were spent in deliberating about the publike quiet, and the Kings safety, whose age de∣livered him into the hands of others to be ruled. Arguile as Plaintiffe layes his Bill of injuries done by Marr, (who onely was Mortons instrument) hereupon Marr was summoned to answer such crimes as were objected against him; but his noble descent and demerrit of Progeni∣tors did purge away this act of green impudency; the King and the Counsell prevailed so farre with him, as that he studied to preserve the publike tranqui∣lity, as also to quash all occasions of intestine discord, and civil broyles; the Counsell strive to reconcile Atholl, Arguile, and Morton, Marre, and his Uncle Alexander, appoynting twelve
men, chosen by both parties to deter∣mine the controversie, the Commissio∣ners composing the differences were men of more than ordinary authority, who met at Edenbrough, there to define and decide the variance according to the rules of Law. These disputes 'twixt Uncle and Ne∣phew were laid aside by the determina∣tion of the Arbitrators, which was, that the young Earle of Marr should be held the most noble of that Fami∣ly, should solely bee Governour of the Castle of Sterlin, and Guardian to the Prince, according as his Ance∣stors had beene: but if hee should goe to his grave, not leaving any issue, then the honor to be translated unto his Uncle: for the present, Alexander was to keep his Regency in the Castle of Edenbrough: as for Morton (although he was dejected, and involved into mi∣sery by the precipitate fury of Arguile and Atbol) yet he would have condis∣cended to any reasonable conditions of concord. Thomas Randolph, whose many Lega∣tions had made him exquisite, was re∣ceived into Scotland with the smiling face of the Kingdome: his Embassage
was a congratulation of those rare and various ornaments of so miraculous ingenuity which were conspicuous in the King at such an age, hee comme∣morated the many endeavours and fa∣vours issuing from his Princesse the Queen of England, withall he demon∣strated to Atholl, Arguile, and Morton, how that nothing was more desireable then concord and publike tranquility nothing worthier detestation then dis∣cords and dissentions, which by deva∣stations and solitude, swallowed up the beauty of alliances, families, townes, kingdomes: he did therefore by a more then superlative ardency beseech them to let all these private grudges arising from hatred and envy to run the race of oblivion: his last request was, that Arguile would restraine the Islanders from sublevating the Irish with further aid, provision, and ammunition: but this last desire appeared in the species of an unjust request, because Agnus and James his brother, Lord of the Isles; and Sur∣ly Boy, or Charles, who from a marke in his body was sirnamed Yellow, being discended from the Mach-Onales, were wafted over with a great strength of their followers into Ireland, and pos∣sest
themselves of that part of Clande∣bois, adjacent to the Isle of Racline, which they supposed to belong unto their ancestors and the Family of Mac-Donalds; they performed many valiant atchievements, and bloudy disputes a∣gainst the inroders in Ireland; but Shan O Neale slaying Agnus and James, so excited the Family of Mac-Coneales, as nothing but the bloud of Shan O Neale could quench the flames; Donell & Ag∣nus of the same Line, reassumed Arms, and sieze upon Clandeboy, as an heri∣tage for them and their posterity, cau∣sing their swords enter controversie with the English, not without cadave∣rous and ambiguous events; nor did they sheath their swords untill her Ma∣jestie of England assured them of their possessions in Ireland: this caused Ar∣guile send aide privately and furnish the Irish with all conveniences to pro∣secute the warre against the English. In the interim the Deligates consult with his Majesty, for a reuniting of the Nobility (if by any meanes it might be affected) the result of their consultations was, that the day insu∣ing, the Antagonists should convene in the middle way 'twixt Dalkeith and
Edenbrough, where when both parties came, Monton with a guard of his friends, Aholl and Arguile, with three hundred expert horse-men, after sa∣lutations ended, they all went at the entreaty of Morton to Dalkeith to din∣ner, the next day brought them to Sterlin: in the way they were met by a conflux of people, which came from the neighbouring townes, to congra∣tulate their amity; nor was the Court imitating his Majesty, inferiour, in re∣joycing at their entertainment, and while they were yet comming, thanks flew into their breasts, the heavens be∣ing filled with acclamations of alacrity. Mortons prudent behaviour and sweet moderation was an attractive to draw the Kings approbation: so he had him in more high esteem: nay the Commons, as if treading in the Kings steps, adorned his brow with the wreath of praise. He in the interim being not ignorant how turbulent a storme of envy appro∣ched, ingendred from those ruines of malice, harboured in the Nobilities hearts, did what in him lay to attract unto his faction by the Load-stone of favours, riches, potency, by conferring
Court offices, and publique prefer∣ments on divers persons, his haughti∣nesse was grown to the height, that he could no longer dissemble it, but abo∣lished the trimestriall vicisitude of ru∣ling, and now hee will trample upon the neck of his adversaries, foaming with anger, rusheth headlong to his own ruine; thus hee added fuell to the sparkles of malice which was not de∣funct, but rather raked over with ashes in the breasts of Arguile, Atholl, & Mon∣trosse: He challenged the second place after the King to be due to him at Ster∣lin, usurped or rather monopolized the steering of all things; This irritated the leaders of the adverse party so far, as to draw up a most bitter satyrical com∣plaint against Morton. How that in administration of affairs hee had behaved himselfe like a libidi∣nous, proud, covetous creature: that hee who because hee sold himselfe over to avarice, was degraded from Regen∣cy, now by Serpentine windings strives to obtain a continued Magistracy, that hee usurped his Majesties authority by Act of Parliament taken from him, swayed the Scepter in the interim, abo∣lishing the constitution of serving the
Prince by course, enervating the autho∣rity of publique counsell, that his breast might bee the Oracle on which the Prince might solely depend for counsel and authority: they proceede likewise to let the Privy Councel and select No∣bility understand how that his arro∣gance and violence were inconsistent with legitimate magistracy, desiring not to suffer such unjust power to sway: but if hee should contemne the Kings minority and Councels authori∣ty, then they would be propugnators of such wrongs; But in conclusion the Citizens were desired to take armes for the bringing to condigne punishment such as strive to enervate the force of Parliaments, which was the Subjects freedome, against such as had demoli∣shed the trimestriall vicissitude of giving counsel, and solely usurped authority over the Kings Majestie. His Highnesse was at a stand, not knowing to what this swelling would ptove, however his royall resolutions were fixed on a meeting to be held in July following, which He divulged by letters, summoning the Peeres and the Antagonists to appear in Parliament, where they should expect Justice. The
place for convention was Edenburough, where many of the Noble Order were assembled, who secretly enter Cove∣nant one with another: this arriving at Mortons knowledge, he determined to make fractions of that whole Parlia∣ment at Edenb. which derived its autho∣rity from the weak age, & constitution of the Prince, affirming that the place was destitute of pleasures and health, that Sterlin was a place more commo∣dious. Arguile, Atholl, and Montrosse the Innovators, proposed the contrary, that such of the Nobility as assembled at Sterlin did not legally congregate, that Edenburough the place appointed was pat for the busines in agitation, that the meeting at Sterlin where the Earles of Morton and Marre recided at Court, were full of armed souldiers, that the concourse of people might open a gap to their enemies, so that there could not be any security for life or free agi∣tation, when surrounded with fears of an overawing power: besides this was an offront offered to the major part of the Nobility, who had chosen Patrick Lord Lindsey as a Commissioner to let his Majestie know thereof. The Kings answer to their Remon∣strance
was, that hee would take care of the Nobilities security if they came to Sterlin, by putting the Citizens in a defensive posture against any subitani∣ous commotions or accidentall vio∣lence, so that jealousies of an overaw∣ing power should be taken away. But the time for meeting grew neer, and according to their wonted course the Peeres were summoned to give their Votes in the Court of the Castle at Sterlin, not in the Common hall accor∣ding to the usual course, al there present accorded without reluctancy in mat∣ters of Religion, and the true worship of God: there deliberations were una∣nimous and univocall in affaires of State. The Edenburgian Nobles decreed to declare by their Commissioners Montres and Lindsey, that the convention had in the castle of Sterlin was against the fun∣damentall Laws and auncient prescript, nor was it legall, withall protesting that what ever was there acted, to bee illegall, disorderly, and of no validity, seeing the major part of Peers was ab∣sent for feare of death. The Delegates comming to Sterlin caused a sodaine and frequent convening of the Nobility
to heare what Propositions were brought: where the Kings Highnesse being adorned with his purple robes, Scepter, and other Majesticall Orna∣ments, answered that it was not mate∣riall in what part of the city they met, in that care was had of his safety against any approaching ruine, that the Court was ready to entertain any, exclude none, that their not convening in the common hall should be no prescript to posterity, that none went about to pro∣hibite his moderate Tutelage, but hee enjoyed the same liberty, which was granted to his Ancestors: that it was his sole desire not to innovate any thing against his Predecessors lawes or institutes, nor enervate the authority of Parliaments, nor yet revoke the houses suffrages, that which the Parlia∣ment had proposed to his Majesty, or which the States ordered, the same ought to be established; that it was un∣just to suppose the opinions of some few should countervail the votes of the whole house, for no other cause then inane Jealousies which their guilty consciences dictated; Lastly, he demon∣strated that all Acts had passed legally and rightly, approving the Parliaments
authority by open proclamation, and commanded that Montrosse and Lindsey should be under free custody, separated from the commerce of all, to impede colloqution and negotiation of coun∣cels twixt them: but Montrosse made his escape by the Keepers fraudulency (not∣withstanding divers horsemen) were sent to prosecute and bring him back. Hee upon Eagles wings posting to Edenburough, where in the convention of the Nobles, he declared their eminent dangers if prevention were not had, & force resist force, so that such injuries should not be unrevenged. The fomen∣tors of these stirres put themselves in a posture of war, the Families of Humes and Cars siding with them. Having consulted what was to be a∣cted, they rayse forces, and imploring aid of their Allies, Attendants and friends, they march forward with some troops of horse and foote, promising them pay, declaring that their taking up armes was to set the King at liber∣ty, restore the Nobilities dignity, and the Kingdomes safety and liberty. The Kings Majestie although begirt with this sodain commotion, yet un∣dauntedly declared by Mortons advice,
that unlesse the Chiefes of that faction would lay downe their armes before such a day, let them expect to be dealt withall as common enemies to the State. These as cracklings of thunder no∣thing amazed them, who couragiously prosecuted their enterprize, villifing an Herald sent to them and his message, rending the Princes letters, so that they make a commixture of divine & human things. On the contrary, Angus, Marr, and Morton doe the same for their own de∣fence at Sterlin, besides many of the Nobility come thither upon the consi∣deration of their Princes safety, and their owne affection with a great Con∣course of the Commonalty. Athol, Ar∣guile, Montrosse▪ and their friends with 10000. armed men, pressed in their march many High-land men or moun∣tainers associating, pitched their tents in an open field nigh the Chappel Na∣ry. The next day Kennedy the chiefe of that Family, and Berganie, with 400. gallant horsemen conjoyne themselves, the Nobility would not move further, having greater hopes in the besieging of Sterlin, then in its oppugnation.
But Angus in whom was deposited the chief strength of the Kingdom, marched before with a party of 500. horse to scout out and take all straglers and pil∣lagers, thence arise a light skirmish twixt the horse, while Mar and Morton leading up the Army, consisting of a promiscuous multitude, encamp them∣selves in the fields adjacent to Sterlin, obstructing all passages, and keeping strict watch: this done, the troopes re∣treated. One thing is memorable, Wil∣liam Tait a fierce man of Tevidale, desi∣rous of honour, challenged James Johnston servant to the Lord Glayms, a man whose valour was found true upon the touch-stone of experience, who em∣braceth the challenge, causing his spurs give an alarm to his horse, couching his launce in his rest, rage was so pre∣valent in the encounter, that either shea∣thed their lance in the others body: Tait being Deaths prisoner, fell from his horse, the launce (as if detaining that his Masters Antagonists should survive) being fastned to Johnstons thigh nigh the horse, overturned him. While this tragedy was on the stage, Sir Robert Bowes the English Embassa∣dour intermitted no time to mediate
a peace by his progresse and regresse twixt the opposites, sometimes beseech∣ing the Nobles to commiserate their own fortunes, and looke backe to His Majesties incolumnity; after a long time spent in debate, it was concluded by this intercession lest fraudulency might issue from the fomentors, or lest the ar∣mies might forrage, both parties were to disband, only some few horse were to be kept on foote for restraining the Borderers from plundering: Arguile, Montrosse, and Lindsey, were selected Pri∣vy Councellours, and eight men were appointed Commissioners to determine the controversie amongst the Nobility, to nominate the Governours of Eden∣burough and Dumbarton Castles, to re∣duce the Nobility to their lustre, and to preserve the laws and customes of the Kingdome. Thus when the armies were ready to drown each other in blood, peace as the common good for all Scotland (in her white robes) appeared, but its con∣tinuance was momentary, notwith∣standing the promulgation thereof by proclamation in the City Royall: the Nobles hereupon take their journy to Edenburough, that their faction might be
confirmed in strength, by the accesse of the Families of Gordones, Lindseys, and Barons in Fife, the High-land men de∣part home. In the interim His Majesty, whose desire was publique serenity, bends his news to pacification, admo∣nishing the Chiefes of either party that jars and dissention were ill beseeming Privy Councellours: and to consum∣mate the discord, He proposed these Lords to be Moderators, Lindsey, Har∣ris, Ogilby, Innernesse, for Arguile, Ro∣thesse, Buchan, Ruthen, and Bode for Mor∣ton. The Commissioners neither seeking excuse or delay goe about the conjun∣ction: after a long debate held at Ster∣lin, it was concluded, seeing dissenti∣ons were obnoxious to the Nobility, mortiferous to the Crown and State: on the contrary peace was the onely safety of the Kingdome: The Nobles were not only to extirpate dissention, but consummate the Warre, so that in stead of malitious enemies, they should become friends, and in stead of mortall enmity there should be immortall friendship. And although there was not omission of any thing advantagi∣ous to concord, yet the breach could not be repaired, for Arguile knowing
Morton's insinuations was so obstinate as no conditions would be embraced, unlesse the other was debarred of all commerce with his Highnesse; Where∣upon Morton perceiving himselfe unable to grapple with the Nobilities envy, and defatigated by the procrastinations of these present troubles; having taken his farewell of the King, departed the next day, many of his friends bringing him to Dalkeith. Afterwards he allayed the furious animosities of his adversa∣ries by the lenitives of prudency, and moderation, asswaging that execrable hatred with vertue and observancy. The matter now was in that posture, as that the supporters of this contro∣versie were become friends, and their Retinue even sought opportunities to congratulate each other, ten men were select for further conference, the Earle of Montrosse, the Abbot of Newbottell, Sir James Balfour Knight: Thomas Ken∣nedy of Bergany and Peter Hay were con∣stituted for the Earles of Atholl and Ar∣guile: for Morton were the Earle of Bu∣chan, the Abbot of Dumferlin, the Lord Boyde, Sir John Gordon of Lothenwar, Knight, and James Halliburton of Dun∣dy. The place for Convention was at
the Church of Innernes, the time was likewise agreed upon: after some days the Delegates met in the adjourned place, where they were invironed with a great multitude of their friends and followers; the next day they returned to Liberton, (in that it was conceived placentious) where the day was consu∣med in deliberating, but yet they could reach no harbour; the next adjourne was to Newbottell, where at last they struck anchor in the haven of Concord but because the principall parties were absent, there could be no transaction to the full: It was concluded that Mor∣ton, Atholl, and Arguile should meete at Leith without any weapons, where af∣ter an enterview there passed a most be∣nigne and humane congratulation, ha∣ving obliterated all dissention caused from diuturnall jars, they communica∣ted themselves each to other at a pub∣lique banquet, an act producing an un∣speakable gladnesse of the Commons, and no lesse joy of his Majestie, who having his Kingdome once againe in tranquility, called a Convention of the Nobles at Sterlin, where He con∣gratulates those who had been studious to cause domesticke dissentions and in∣testine
factions to acquiesse; This roy∣all act of thanksgiving inflamed those noble spirits to discusse what ere might be commodious for his Majestyes safety, authority, and dignity, his families magnificence▪ and splendor. The Lord of the Privie Councell to sublevate the indigency of the Kings coffers, declared by Proclamation that the Kings Coyne should bee of greater value, this was overbitter a potion for the Citizens to digest, who had learned in the Schoole of experience that the augmentation of price on silver, indu∣ced the augmention of price on victual, and vendible commodities, besides grea∣ter detriments would ensue to the Kings revenues, Exchequer and patrimony; but the Lords threatned to imprison such as refused obedience, yet the feares of prison could not deterre them from obstinate contumacy, upon the neck of this Proclamation issued forth another to Proclaime them Traytors which re∣fused, the terror hereof caused obedi∣ence, this austere course was fathered upon Morton, in that hee had tryed all waies to raise monies. The precisians would not suffer their plea to fall this yeare, being inve∣sted
with a perpetuall and constant de∣sire of overturning the Prelates, for the Bishops had not prevalency either in authority, or favour to withstand so numerous opposites, according to the desires of these precise men the Parlia∣ment first handled Religion, enacting that all his Majesties subjects should professe the reformed religion, & wholy extirpate Popery; and the Statutes made in the Protectors regency for its establishment were decreed to stand in force. This year Margaret Douglas yeelded her selfe to the coacting lawes of con∣traries, a woman of a Princely Majestie, in the 63. yeare of her age, descended from Henry the seventh, for Margaret his elder daughter was assigned for the Im∣periall Crown of Great Brittain, and by the applause of the Nobles and Com∣mons betrothed to James the fourth, of whom sprung James the fifth. After the candle of James the fourths life was extinct, Margaret who was his espoused, tooke to husband Archibald Douglas Earl of Angus the flower of the Scots Nobili∣ty, by whom shee had Margaret Douglas at Harbotell in Northumberland, Matthew Earl of Lenox married this Margaret, he
was a man of renowned Progenitors, who having left France, came into Eng∣land, where Henry the 8. adorned him with unparalleld honour, for besides the large possessions hee invested him with in Yorkshire, he obtained for him Margaret Douglas his Sisters Daughter; from the conjunction of these two great Stars, Henry Stuart Lord Derly issued: this Henry tooke to wife Mary Stuart Queen of Scots, allyed by consangui∣nity before, which Mary brought into the world James the sixt King of Great Brittain; this most zealous and thrice noble Lady had the checkers of good and bad fortune, which posterie wil me∣morize for externall lineaments and in∣ternall ornaments egregious; Her de∣scent was regall, the fruit of her womb and their numerosity was no lesse. While King Edward wore the Crowne in honour, but novercating Fortune (lest this Lady should be oblivious of mortality) overshadowed her fair hea∣ven of prosperity, with many incon∣veniences of humane frailty: Shee was Supervisor to 8. of her Children thrice imprisoned for affecting Loves, not for any crime against the Crown or State: the first was with Thomas Howard the
Duke of Norfolks son, whose ardency in love was so violent, as that he wan∣ted ability to allay the perturbations of his minde: the next cause of restraint was, that her Sonne Henry Lord Derly, had entered a conjugall tye with Mary Queen of Scots, the last was by reason of the marriage consummated twixt Charles her younger son, and Elizabeth Candish Mother of Arbella; thus the chaste and legitimate law of Matrimony contruded this most faithfull woman into prison (where shee was more sensi∣ble of the adversities then prosperous e∣state incident to her owne Family) this act of imprisonment was rather suppo∣sed to proceede from the indignation then dignity of Queene Elizabeth: yet after the perpetration of her Sons mur∣ther, the Lady Margaret enjoyed her li∣berty: but the repute which had risen from vertue was permanent, not that which was daub'd over by infelicity. Shee was invested with supream honour, her exequies were solemnized at West∣minster, where her bones were entomb'd amongst the Kings of England, an elabo∣rate Sepulchre, an Heroicall Elogium erected; Shee left behind her a Nephew and a Neece, James the 6. and Arbella.
About this time His Majestie sent the Abbot of Dumberlin to congratulate her Majestie of England for her mutuall affe∣ction towards him, for her desire of peace and concord: after the congratulation was ended, he desired Her Highnesse to reestablish the league of Edenborough, to cohibite the tumults upon the con∣fines, to compresse all machinations a∣gainst Religion, to make restitution of such goods as had beene violently taken by the Bordering robbers, to perpetuate the amity between the two Kingdomes, and if it were possible to connect them in a more restringent tye of Covenant. Lastly he desired as heir apparant the an∣cient patrimony of the house of Lenox in England. The Queen answered Shee was ready to grant any mutual league for the tran∣quility of either Kingdome, and securi∣ty of Religion: but as for the patrimo∣ny of the Earl of Lenox, it was of more difficulty then to expedite in so short a space, besides it was a matter fit for con∣sultation; seeing the Embassadour had demonstrated by many arguments▪ and historicall examples, that the King of Scots was Heir by an undoubted title to his Ancestors patrimony, and that was
the proper patrimony of his Majestie, which was a sustentation for his nego∣tiations; whereupon hee earnestly sup∣plicated Her Highnesse that the estate conferred upon the Kings Ancestors in the County of Huntington, successively by the Kings of England, should not be denyed his Majestie which was her neere Kinsman. After a long debate Queene Elizabeth remitted the businesse to Her Councell, they to divert the Embassa∣dour from it, required the States of Scot∣land to give assurances that the K. while He was in His Minority should not enter or renew league with any without the Queenes knowledge thereof, or solem∣nize matrimony, or be transmitted out of Scotland; to these proposalls the Embassadour gave response, that his Commission reached not so far, but the patrimony for the present was not re∣stored, yet her Majesty put him in hope of reaping the profit. Anno Domini 1579. The Earl of Atholl Lord Chancellor in the Infancy of his yeares, by reason his disease augmented its vigour at Kin∣carn, was deteined in a Village belong∣ing to Montrosse, where not long after he yeelded nature her due, the anxiety of
his minde brought him to his exit, or a delaying and consuming poyson took him hence, according to the supposition of some (which I rather credit) in that all the symptomes and paths of poyson were apparant in his cadaverous bulke; the obsequies were celebrated by a con∣vention of tears, multitudes, and a ban∣quet at Edenburough in Saint Giles Church, where all the ceremonies con∣ducing to honour, were executed: upon the Tomb stood the Effigies of a Pelli∣can delacerating her breast with her beake to give the young sucke, intima∣ting that hee was ready to sacrifice his blood in defence of the Kingdome: the suspition had of Atholls death fell sad upon his Corrivall Morton. Hence was it that after the solemnization was con∣summated, grievous contumelies were injected upon him, and Athols Lady even wearied with a more tedious sorrow, sends forth sad complaints, in fine an apparition of reconciliation appeared twixt his accusers and him. Arguile one who suspected and abhominated the thoughts of his friends death, succeeded him in the place of being Chancellour. The King although milde towards his Nobility, yet was inflamed both by
instigations of Morton, and his own an∣ger against the Hamiltons for the slaugh∣ter of his Grandfather Linox, and Earle of Murry Regents, as also for other no∣torious crimes abolished in the yeare 1573. This much honoured Familie Morton determined, since they were di∣moved from Court, to follow them with fire and sword; and now that Mor∣ton saw his Corrivall Atholl to be re-en∣tered into the earths womb, he began to dilate his malice in remembring af∣fronts, and seeking to revenge them; and as it became him, sought to secure himselfe, opposing in an hostile manner the grand enemies of Lenox. John & Claud the most glorious Stars of the Hamiltons perceiving that the e∣nemy surpassed them in number, deter∣mined to secure themselves in strong holds, but remembring that a sodaine irruption might circumvent them, they desisted, choosing rather to trust unto flight and nocturnall shades. The Earls of Mar, Angus, and Morton marched with their allies, retinue, and souldiers into the Hamiltons possessions, the rest of the Nobility and Citizens ac∣cording to the Councels decree, were to send aide▪ the Earles sent forth parties
of horse, to give the Hamiltons an a∣larm, and so provoke them to fight, but they durst not so much as fall upon the straglers; hereupon they laid the parts adjacent to Glot wast, burning houses and plundering the Countrey, approa∣ching close to the Castle of Hamilton, planting their pieces, & stopping up all passages, the place was fortified both by its naturall site, and strong Garrison: but yet the Defenders being impatient to endure a siege, desire pardon, and onely leave to depart with their lives: the Abbot of Driburg was presently dis∣patched to his Majesty at Sterlin, who answered him that it became him not to treat with men who by treachery, unhumanly butchered his Grand-fa∣ther Lenox: but they ought to be estee∣med as men already condemned for guilty, and begging life upon the de∣livery of his Majesties answer to the besieged, there arose a great strife a∣bout the delivery up of the Castle be∣twixt the guilty and innocent: but while they disagreed within, Sir James Hamilton, surprized the Castle of Dref∣son, putting to the sword all such as withstood him; and the Earle of Glen∣earnes sonne, cutting of the watch,
possessed himselfe of Paslet: thus the race of Hamiltons was circumvented, sub-planted, and put to the sword by the treachery of inhabitants, and do∣mestick dissentions: for these losses drives them into such straights, that seeing their deploreable condition, the guilty desire to surrender themselves up to his Majesties mercy, who onely caused some of those that were actors in the parracide to be executed, and their goods confiscated, the residue were pardoned: thus the King shewed himselfe equally mercifull and just: he kept Garrison in the Castle to suppresse any insurrection. In the interim, John and Claude, the sonnes of the Duke of Castlebraull, seeing no safety to consist in Armes, and the Kings forces to be in severall places, fled forth of Scotland for fear of Anguse, Marr, and Morton: when they had reached a place of refuge, they take counsell whether it were better to try the mercy of the French or English, although Queen Elizabeth was great with anger against the Hamiltons, for siding with the French Faction; yet the sublunary vicissitude, and renown of their Progenitors, excited her Ma∣jesty
to give them an harbour and re∣fuge for the weather-beaten Boat of their fortunes: and she sent Master Er∣rington unto his Majesty; earnestly to intercede for them. Tell me, did he ever come forth of his mothers womb who to behold those miserable objects of a most strange fortune, with their deare wives, and sweet children fol∣lowing them, would not have burst forth into commiseration? and were they not the more to be pittied, in that they rather chose thus to bee afflicted then raise Civill warre in their Coun∣trey, which surely they might have done. Much about this time, did Mary Queen of Scots, being now an Exile, desire her Majesty of ENGLAND in some convenient time, to take into consideration her miserable condition; and if neither consanguinity, or her being borne a free Prince, although bea∣ten out of her Kingdome by a dete∣stable Rebellion of Subjects, could not move her, yet let pitty prevaile to suffer her reigne together with her son, which she supposed would be an unpar∣ralleld act of clemency. But these her petitious, and humble obsecrations,
could not revoke Queen Elizabeth to lenity and commiseration, in that ha∣ving consulted with the Scots, they made answer, her liberty would in∣volve their Nation into a most sad and destructive warre; for she would labour to revenge the injuries done her, di∣minish the young Kings authority, and change the State and Religion. The Queen of Scots being commo∣ved by the greefe falling from such hopes, earnestly intreated the Kings of France and Spaine not to suffer her who was allyed to them by Consan∣guinity, Nobility and degree to pe∣rish in prison: but to revenge these in∣dignities, late Rebellions, and plunde∣ring of her Subjects; these motives were prevalent with the Kings, who fostered a hope of restoring her to liber∣ty and former dignity. Secretary Nay a French-man, was immediately dispat∣ched into Scotland with Letters, and private Mandates from Queen Mary, where he arriving, required to have ad∣mittance into the Kings presence, to consult about the state, and condition of his mother: his Majesties Counsell having read the Title, running thus: Queen Mary to James the sixt Prince
of that Name, stormed vehemently thereat; insomuch as they would nei∣ther entertaine those haughty Letters, nor messenger; both because that instead of writing to the King, she had writ to the Prince, as in diminution to his au∣thority, especially seeing the King was lawfully enthroned by her consent. The Messenger notwithstanding perti∣naciously assevered that the power of Regency was in the Queen Mothers hands: the Privy Counsel therefore de∣termined to remit him answerlesse, un∣lesse the Queene would Rectifie that fault, and write to the King of Scots; which if she denyed to performe, shee might surcease in hoping to receive her desires. The Monsieur being hereupon irritated, incon tinently departed: The Queen of Scots understanding by him, how there was no way to impetrate a∣ny thing, unlesse shee renounced her Title, subscribing not onely to her son but also to his Majesty. The Court was spread over with no∣torious Libells, which spoke some∣times Poetically, otherwhiles Orato∣rically, besprinkling Morton, and o∣ther Illustrious Nobles with Obliquie. The Authors of these spurious brats
were one Turniball, and one sirnamed Scot, who after judgement past on them, were executed in the Market∣place of Sterlin, after an unusuall manner; for the custome was to pu∣nish Libellers, either with temporall banishment, or confiscation of their estates. Morton by vindicating his quarrell in this more severe manner, be∣came odious. These things thus in agitation, there came into Scotland Amys Stewart, Lord Obigny, so called from Aubigny, a vil∣lage in Aquitaine, who was lineally descended from Lenox, being the sonne of John Stewart, brother to Matthew Earle of Lenox, who in the Kings mi∣nority was Regent: this Amys Stewart was supposed to have beene sent over by his neare allyes, the Guises, to sub∣vert Religion: or as others thought, Montrosse and Arguite sent for him to overturne Mortons authority: or at least to break the Truce 'twixt England and Scotland; he arrived at Leith, where his Majesty commanded that he should be received with especiall honour, and so in great state he was carryed to Eden∣borough; from thence to his Majesty at Sterlin, where comming into the Pre∣sence
Chamber, he prostrated himselfe, desiring the King of Heaven to blesse his Majesty with perpetuall felicity: No sooner did the young King see him, but in that hee was so neare allyed in bloud, of so renowned a Family, emi∣nent ornaments of body and minde, tooke him up and embraced him in a most amorous manner, conferred on him presently a rich inheritance; and that he might be imployed in state-af∣fairs, elected him one of his honourable Privy Counsell, Gentleman of his Bed∣chamber, and Governour of Dumbar∣ton Castle. But this Trumpet of Fame being heard over all Britaine begat envy, e∣specially because Obegny attracted the Scots to the French amity, and attemp∣ted to revoke Thomas Carr of Farni∣hurst, a faithfull servant to the exil'd Queen from banishment: You may be pleased to look back to the Originall and discent of Lenox in France, John Stewart of the same Line, in the reigne of Charles the seventh, when open war was proclaimed 'twixt England and France, transported an Army over for their ayd; for which hee was created Master of the Horse, in a conflict at
Bauge overthrew the English, so that he wonne a possession in Barry or Burges: in the reigne of Charles the eighth. Ber∣nard of the same house was held in great repute for Prowesse shewed in the Neo∣politane warre, subduing Italy, and vanquishing Alphonsus King of Arragon. Indeed hath any Historian sufficiently collauded the worth of this man? but he having no issue, he conferred his estate in France upon John Stewart his cousin: after him were John and Amys, both valiant, if their times had called for proofe thereof; both tooke their re∣pose in the Civill warre. This man was of a milde Genius, if the Chariot of his minde had not been driven by violent perswasion, he was ready to relinquish troubles: his fidelity to his Soveraigne, was vnblemished, love to the Nobles great, Fortunes darling for three yeares, afterwards the subject of hatred and domestick troubles: to say no more, he shewed himselfe worthy of his Progenitors, and family of Lenox. His Majesty summoned a Parliament to be held at Edenburough the thirteenth of October, where he resolved not∣withstanding all mutations of wea∣ther to be in person; nor indeed could
the raine, stormes, hideous blasts, and lowring heavens dimove him from un∣dertaking this necessary journey: upon the way from Sterlin to Edenborough, he with his Nobles and followers were so weather-beaten, that it was night ere they came to Limnough, where lod∣ging that night, the next day they came to Edenborough. And on the first day of the Parliament, hee being invested with his regall Bobes, bravely moun∣ted, rid in great state through the Ci∣ty to the Parliament house, the Nobility and Clergy according to their degree going before: thus was his Majesties en∣trance into the Principality solemnized with great splendor, the Imperiall orna∣ments were supported by Archibald Doug∣las, Earl of Angusse, Collen Cambell Earl of Arguile, Robert Steuart, Earle of Lenox. After these came his Majesty adorned with the rayes of Imperiall glory, his Retinue, and servants waiting upon him: This rare spectacle was an at∣tractive to draw the multitudes eyes af∣ter it; so that they follow the King with clapping of hands, venerations, and prosperous wishes: ascending his Tribunall, in few words he briefely de∣clared to the Lords, having taken their
places, that this concourse of the States, elevated his soule on the wings of alacrity, seeing it tended to the e∣stablishing of the Common-wealth, that he was conscious how his Nonage administred occasion of Commotions, that he reposed his chiefe hope of tran∣quility, peace and concord in their wis∣domes. Lastly, he calls God to attest that his intentions aymed onely at the preservation of Religion, Subjects safety, and Kingdomes security. The Parliament first cast their eyes upon Religion, enacting that those sole∣ly should bee esteemed Members of the true Church, who professed that forme of Confession agreed upon in Parlia∣ment, 1567. And agree to the Prescript of administring the Sacraments in act and will; that no Religion was to be e∣steemed Orthodoxall in Doctrine and Discipline, save that the Scots embraced, in the present. The Nobility were not to transmit their Sonnes into forraigne Countreyes, unlesse having a warrant from his Majesty: which obtained, the Travellers were to oblige themselves both by oath, and subscription, that they would observe inviolably the Do∣ctrine and Canons of the Church of
the Church of Scotland; that every Fa∣mily should have and retaine a Scottish Bible. The power of Ministers was likewise confirmed to preach the Go∣spell, administer the Sacraments, to censure mens behaviours, and chastise Delinquents, the Discipline erected publikely by Bishops and the Super-in∣tendents suered diminution, although as yet no Synodicall act had passed for their abolition. The next thing agita∣ted was that of the Hamiltons; many of the Nobility demonstrated the equity of their punishment, returning his Ma∣jesty thanks and praise for his care had therein, John and Claud Hamilton whose veines flowed with Noble bloud, and other fifteen of especiall note in that fa∣mily, upon the discovery of the mur∣ther, by a generall Vote were held Re∣bels, for the death of Murrey and Lenox Regents, to have their Estates confisca∣ted, which were no lesse delicious then fructiferous booties. The next Scene which came upon the Stage was the do∣nation of Paslet to Obigny, and Arboth to Marr: There were not wanting some, who even burning with anger and re∣venge, excited his Majesty utterly to abolish the name of Hamiltons and the
chiefe of these men was Morton: but the King having more respect to his ho∣nour then their fury, would in no wise condiscend to this unheard of cru∣elty, supposing it rather fit to apply such Remedies as the Lawes prescri∣bed. There was a Remonstrance delivered to the House concerning corrupt Judi∣catures, depraved Judges, favour, bribe∣ry, covetousnesse, that the Lawes were invalid; nor indeed could they suppose any use of Law, seeing that the chiefe Judges had their judgement in their owne breasts, and the Lawes exten∣ded not to the punishing of Wives or Servants corrupted with gifts. The Parliament to augment his Ma∣jesties Treasure, revoked all annuall pensions, which were conferred on divers persons in the Kings Minority. The Donation of the Earledome of Le∣nox translated to his Uncle Charles Stewart was revoked, and by Act of Par∣liament conferred upon Robert Stewart, brother to his Grandfather who wil∣lingly resigned it to Obegny, being after∣wards Earle of March: Obegney was first created Earle of Lenox, afterwards ascen∣ded to the honour of Duke.
The State thus constituted, the Ha¦miltons repressed and condemned both by Law and Act of Parliament, the King at his comming to the Crowne, won the hearts of his Subjects by his Religious behaviour, strict Oecono∣my, faithfull followers, and rewar∣ding of carefull Guardians; so that with great Festivity hee returned to Sterlin to recreate himselfe, where Lenox begun to be very remarkable, in that hee received into especiall favour James Stewart of Okeltry, who had shewed himselfe in Holland a very ven∣trous Commander, although of a vio∣lent Genius; and William Stewart that valiant Field Marshall, whom I have mentioned in another place. He like∣wife obtained a Pardon for Carr of Farnihurst, although Morton strived earnestly to hinder it; who comming back was not unmindfull of Lenox his late favours, and Mortons inveterate injuries, beginning to fanne up ve∣ry cunningly the sparkes of Dis∣cord. But now while Lenox ingratiated himselfe into the Kings favours, his enemies privately endeavoured by vul∣gar rumours, and Plebeian malice to
make him odious, reporting that hee machinated the destruction of the Pro∣testant Religion, subtilly promoved Popery, weakning the Kings faith: nay, some popular men were so bold as to say in open Pulpit, that he was sent by the Guises to overthrow Gods wor∣ship, foster the French Faction, and disturbe the Kingdome. These hide∣ous complaints, that the Court harbou∣red upstarts, who were ready to sacri∣fice the Kingdome, and Religion: in the Kings unexperienced yeares, so mo∣ved his Majesty, that after consultation with the most of the eminent Clergy, he selected some few of them to instruct Lenox in the true Religion, conjuring them by their Allegiance and fidellty to lay aside all private grudges, and un∣feignedly endeavour his Conversion. They returning his Majesty humble thanks fortheir election, ascertained the K. that they would endeavour what in them lay to performe his highnesse de∣sire; and Lenox promised himselfe to be ready to heare them. Their congresse was daily at Edenborough for conference; the Controversies fled to the Scripture for authority: the Conclusion was, that Lenox, whose soule more hungred
after truth then contention, yeelded to their perswasions; so that in presence of the City Magistrates, and prime of the Ministery, besides a great conflux of people, he changed his faith, renoun∣cing the Papall superstition, and em∣braced the Reformed Religion, con∣fessing his former errors; and for this Religion he would fight; for this he would exhaust his veines: nay for it he would lay downe his life. Although this act was pleasing to his Majestie, and major part of the Nobility, yet blind envy, the dayly companion of fortune, eased not to detract from his vertues, corrupt his honours; and blot him with dissimulation. Hereupon his Majesty was more moved, so that he was carefull to declare his in∣tegrity & confession of Faith; to which afterwards he and his meniall servants, and those of his Nobility, whom bloud had advanced to great dignity subscribed, that the more confidence might bee reposed in his officers. In the Interim Obigny taking his jour∣ney towards his Majestie, residing in Sterlin, spent some few dayes sporting∣ly in quiet and rest, besprinkling the
Kings carriage, disposition, and inge∣nuity with the French garbe, instructing him in field exercitarions of horse and foot, so that the King rides the great horse to the delight of all. Much about this time Ruthen marri∣ed his Daughter Jane to the branch of hope the Earle of Atholl, many of the Nobility solemnized the nuptialls at Perth: their celebration in banquetting almost arrived at prodigality, the har∣mony of voyces, sound of Flutes and Trumpets made all the City eccho, the eyes were delighted with pictures, the eares with delightfull songs. The vul∣gar beheld the detriments of vice, masques, sights, and elegancy of ban∣quets: thus was the old nationall par∣cimony changed insonsibly into ry∣ot and attyre; externall luxurious∣nesse creeping in the shape of hu∣manity. Anno Domini. 1580. While Scotland took her rest, a blast of Fame from an unknowne mouth was noysed abroad, that Morton Machinated to draw His Majestie into England; Hee being bespotted with these sad desama∣tions, strives to assoile himselfe at Ster∣lin, harbouring an implacable hatred
against his enemies, presenting his Ma∣jestie and the chiefe of his Nobility with a grievous complaint, as that being cir∣cumvented by forged calumnies, hee must take his leave of the Court for a time, not because of any guilt in him, but lest the redintegration of contenti∣on might flame forth into publique de∣struction. The author who had laid those snares he knew not: yet this hee knew, that who ere he was, he was no o∣ther then a lyar, (a word as bad as a dart to a Noble-man.) His Majestie being molested with these doloreferous com∣plaints and devious rumours, strives to compose the matter, lest that sedition might get head, imputing all fault to the rude multitude; withall, telling Morton that he ought not to be troubled at such an idle and improbable report: besides hee was not suspected of the least fraudulency or attempt. When Morton was almost appeased, Argaile his ancient emulator began to reblazon this report, intimating to the Councel-Table this bold enterprize of transmitting his Ma∣jestie into England: but this weak asser∣tion having no other staffe for support then his word, was overthrown by the bare denyall, which he durst not prose∣cute
for feare of incurring an ignomi∣nious taint, so that hee desisted from any further progresse, having already received a checke for his malevolency and hatred. Queen Elizabeth hearing that Lenox, Mar, and Athol were elected Privie Coun∣cellours, was much troubled, especially that Lenox who was knowne to be a de∣voted vassall to the French King, and borne in Aquitaine, should be a Privie Councellour, which made Her feare the ation in Religion, and disunion twixt the two Nations. The tempest had now been turbulent a long time, and those whom Her Maje∣stie of England had sent to acquaint Her how affairs stood, spread grievous re∣ports. Peaceable Lenox (whose sweete disposition I have mentioned else where) seemed to employ his wit in promoting James Stuart to be Guardian to the Earl of Arran, who had now been 15. yeares mad, and likewise to be Captaine of his Majesties guard: his desires were not frustrate, for he was made Guardian o∣ver Arran, and Captain of the Guard, which no sooner obtained, but then he possessed himselfe of the Isle and Castle Arran and Kinvell, and othet riches be∣longing
to that Family, committing many and turbulent outrages without all law or custome; To give you a short Character of him, he was a lewd, ambitious, harsh, and indiscreet man▪ composed even by industry for terrour and astonishment, insolent, immane▪ and haughty, he could not brook a free word or look, by nature fiery, of a soul∣diers constitutiō, being more imperious then the turbulent spirits of the Scots could endure, he would have a nger in every thing, causing his tenants subject themselves to his cruelty, libidinosity, and avarice, hee assailed the Nobility with no lesse livor and malignity hee was odious both to them and the Gen∣try, daily augmenting their anger by the imerity of his Genius, and violence of judgment: he would often among his intimates threaten destruction to some of the Nobility, retaining a catalogue of their names who were designed to death or exile: when hee distrusted the Nobles fidelity, then he kept a guard a∣bout himselfe, placing every where in the fields parties of horse: he questioned many men of good ranke by interroga∣tories concerning their life, fortunes, reputes, after an unusuall manner of
proceeding. And now being secure by reason of the turbulency and heartbur∣nings amongst the Nobility, hee laid a foundation for his potency, converting all his care and cogitations to enrich his treasure and set his estate in order, but yet he durst not ascend to the height of his designe before he had supplanted Morton; When the Common-wealth was in so great an amazement, and tot∣tering condition, all things being stee∣red by James Stuart of Okeltry, the Mi∣nisters beseech and invoke God (the re∣venger of pride and cruelty) to raine downe imminent judgements upon him. Morton being of a bitter & fiery nature, was not able to brook the haugty domi∣neering, and unlimited power of this ye∣sterday ambitious creature, in a free Kingdome. He began therefore to see if by any means he could circumvent him; but in that he had not sufficient strength to divert the fury of discord, he only for the present excited the Nobility, reposi∣ting his indignation for a time; but the fire of domesticall discord could not be hid: for one who was privy to Mor∣tons designe, hasted to James Stuart, who no sooner heard him up with the
constitution of his Genius being pride, then he began to feare, lest he might be reducted into order, leaves no way un∣attempted for the prevention of Mortons plot: nor was it long after that James Balfour, one whose nurtriture was dis∣cord and sedition, and a cunning sower of debates among men, returned into Scotland, being not more desirous to ac∣cuse Morton for injuries past, then for his exile. Hee produced a schedule which was subscribed by the Kings Parracides, and signed by Morton: and as he rashly brought this to light, the light glimme∣rings of these rumours shone to her Ma∣jestie of England, who feared that Reli∣gion might bee eclipsed in Scotland, and so by consequence the Nationall league would be broke, and an occasion of put∣ting the Kingdom in a military posture. Shee therefore could have desired to have seene Lenox (being one that was no Favourite of her Faction) lesse in authority, favour & potency at Court, and her womanish feares being aug∣mented by the report of Mortons depres∣sing, and the low ebb those that favou∣red the English were at: besides Balfour was made Governour of that invincible Castle of Dumberton, which stood neere
an arme of the Sea upon the bankes of Glot, a very commodious Haven for the French to land: which was probable since Balfour came to transport the King into France; Upon these and the like considerations Shee sent Sir Robert Bowes Treasurer of Barwicke presently to acquaint her Majestie therewith, in what condition the Kingdome stood, and how the Scots were affected to the English, to accuse Lenox as one who had done his whole endeavour, to deliver▪ the King, Kingdome, and the Subjects of Scotlands liberty into the hands of their enemies: That he had solicited his Majestie, (contaminating his greene yeares with ill counsell) to alienate his affection from the Queen of England. Sir Robert Bowes being admitted to the Councell-table, where shewing his let∣ters of trust to the King and Councell, refused to expostulate any further con∣cerning the purport of his Embassage in the presence of that knowne Favourite of the Guises Obigny: and lest delayes might be obnoxious to publique procee∣dings, hee desired that he might be re∣moved, whose presence would hinder any free consultation. But the Councel answered that his
demands were unjust, and his desires to put out one of the Privie Councell, without the least specification of any crime, was a thing not to be embraced. They desire further to see his Commis∣sion, if he had any such direction from Her Majestie of England, which he refu∣sed to shew; whereupon he was dismis∣sed by the votes of the whole Councel Table, as an Embassadour without In∣structions, nor could His Majestie be in∣duced to do otherwise, although coun∣selled by some few, because the whole Councell had so datermined. Sir Robert Bowes aggravated the not harkning to Her Majesties salutiferous councel, tending to the peace, concord, and common good of both Kingdome, and omitting his duty in taking leave of his Majestie, departed out of Scotland. But his sodaine and precipitate regresse was seconded by a progresse of Alexan∣der Humes of North-barricke, who was sent Embassadour into England to excuse the matter to Her Highnesse, and not ndeservedly to returne the contumacy of violating her Embassadours office up∣on the head of Bowes, who upon the de∣mand of seeing his Instructions, & that at the Covncel-Table, denyed to do it.
The Queene being highly displeased at the great neglect of Her Majestie, and her dignity, and the contempt offered to Her Embassadour: that Shee might repay like for like, remitted Hume alrea∣dy fretting thereat, unto the Lord Bur∣ley, who at that time was not only of her Councell, but one on whose poles of fidelity and industry, the dignity and honour of England was moved: the Lord Burley gave him to understand how unhonourably Bowes in his Embassage had been used, a gap being laid open to discord, that the most sacred law of Na∣tions was contemned and violated: with a great sence and sorrow prosecutes the contempt of Majestie, removing the blame from off the young King, who was steered more by others then his own judgment, and imputes it only & who∣ly to those his evill Councellours, un∣skilfull in the law of Embassage: who to curry favour with the common ene∣mies to both Kingdomes, neglected e∣quity and justice, their old duties, the Covenant and league established, but ra∣ther made breaches of amity twixt the two Princes, fostering them with hopes of new friendship, casting themselves headlong againe into the French servi∣tude;
by name he accused Lenox and Ja: Stuart, as desirous to extinguish her Majesties favour with the King; besides he expostulated of the daily incursions of robbers from Scotland, which mole∣sted the borders, and in the last place a∣dorned Sir Robert Bows the English Em∣bassadour with what Encomeans, Words, or prayse could speak. Hume on the contrary attested with great ardency, that for his owne person he had alwayes beene most desirous of a perpetuall peace and accord twixt the two Kingdomes, having observed what fidelity or diligence could expect, all those offices of humanity; That her Majestie had denyed him audience or congresse, which was an indignity not only offered to himself, but to the King his Soveraigne: Withal he admonished Burley to remember as that he was ele∣cted a Councellor and faithfull adviser of Her Majestie, so those Councellours of their neighbouring King was not unskilfull, but ought likewise to be e∣steemed faithfull and Wel-wishers to his Majesty. The residue of his speech was complaints of the ravenous English borderers, and calumnies of the Eng∣lish Embassadour.
Much about this time were the nup∣tialls of John Earle of Mar, and the Si∣ster to the Lord Drumond solemnly ce∣lebrated with a great confluence of friends: he for authority, grace, of∣spring, riches, and potency, was so prevalent, that no Earl in Scotland could run paralled, nor was his hopes of po∣sterity lesse then himselfe. A secret fire of contention was kin∣led in the bosome of Ruthen Lord Trea∣surer, descended from the height of ho∣nour, and of no lesse potency in his re∣tinue, and of the young Lord Oliphant, whose dignity and love run equipage with his opposites. This altercation a∣risse from over licentiousnesse of lan∣guage which past twixt their Follow∣ers: the dispute began to be so hot, as one of Ruthens servants was slain, & he hereupon fled from the imminent slaughter. This accident put the Coun∣cell-Table into a posture of great care, lest that they should assemble their friends and Followers sodainly to bang it out bravely, which made them take the controversie into consideration; they found that the tumult arisse from both parties. Oliphant and his Followers being contaminated for the
fact, and frighted by the feare of pu∣nishment, betaketh themselves unto flight, sending their advocates to desire his Majesties pardon: many of the No∣bility interposed their authority, lest by these unhappy distempers the Com∣mon-wealth should be disjoyned: but the fire was not so soone quenched, and to augment it, Mortons more favoured his kinsman Oliphant then Ruthen, his most intimate friend; hereupon grew that envy and hatred which was mor∣tiferous to both. But let us looke backe upon James Stuart Guardian to Arran, who domi∣neered over the lives and fortunes of very upright men, supposing that there was now nothing to establish his po∣tency, save the eversion of Morton: and having knowledge of that tacite heart∣burning which was betwixt him and Ruthen, he added flax to his sire by dis∣junction and subtile practises, offering himselfe to bee at Ruthens command: thus by dissimulation he catched him in his net, who stood him in good steed, for hereby wrestling with these distempers grew enraged: and ere hee had well premeditated what to object, upon his entrance into the Court at
Holyrude house, with a dolefull coun∣tenance, affirming before the Coun∣sell in the presence of his Majesty, and chiefe of the Nobiliy, that Morton was worthy of death, as being guilty of Treason, insatiable Covetousnesse, and of murthering his late Majestie. Hee likewise accused Archibald Douglas of Wittingham, as an actor therein. Upon this accusation Morton was commanded to be diligently kept in the Palace: others were sent forthwith to apprehend Archibald Douglas, but he well knowing in what condition hee stood, and afrighted by the feare of the times, or of punishment, took the op∣portunity of that night to fly from his owne house to England. Morton being guarded with a great multitude of followers, was led priso∣ner, first to Edenborough, then to Dum∣berton, where he was attended on by di∣vers troopes, and men of espeiall note, as the Earle of Glencarne, the Lord Seton, Robert Stewart of Orkney, the Tutors of Cassill, Bargany, Lochenwar, Coldinknowles, and Manderston. The day of his Triall approaching, the Family of the Douglasses were great with rage, that so Noble a spirit
should be oppressed by one of a dayes production: the Earle of Angusse, Mor∣tons intimate friend, and kinsman was grieved at his deteining, he with five hundred horse, leaving nothing unat∣tempted, (laid in ambush to intercept him in his journey, and threatned Le∣nox with fire, destruction, sword, and banishment, if any greater punishment should afflict Morton. To prevent all plots hatched by the Douglasses his journey was hastened, but Morton would in no wayes condescend to their endeavours, rather restraining their tempestuous designes, as one who confides more to his owne innocency, and the Kings clemency, then their pre∣cipitate courses. Those Subjects that had behaved themselves valiantly and untaintedly towards their Countrey, were mindfull of Mortons demerits; and deplored their present condition, which proceeded from immoderate li∣berty kept at home: others there were, and those not a few, whose Natures abhorred peace and quietnesse, either being effected with some injuries done them by the Protector, or with his con∣demnation, or other tempestuous stormes, hoped that this new forme of
Soveraignty would effect somtthing to satisfie their desires of revenge, or exalt them to some higher Dignity: James Balfour, who was either Enge∣nier, or actor in all the Scottish trou∣bles, Thomas Carr of Fernihurst, and Manderson, exited by the Banishment of the Humes of Coldinknowlls, and by other private injuries, proffer them∣selves as adjutors to the Guardian of Arrane, whom they admire, accompa∣ny, obey. But few there were of Illu∣strious extract, who voluntarily came in unto him, or any of a good re∣pute, which did not tremble at, dread and fly from him as from some savage, and inhumane creature, because he ex∣ercised his imbred severity upon the poore, or such who did not effect his money-racking way to manage his af∣faires. In these black mists, the Jesuites, and Popish Priests stole into Scotland, labouring of intestine sorrowes, that they might promote Popery, re-erect and confirme by their presence the drooping spirits of such as were Po∣pishly affected, and endeavour to inno∣vate matters in the State: the ring-lea∣der of this crew was John Dury, who
undertooke to be a shield in defence of Edward Campian, that English Jesuite, against those stroakes of John Whitaber, who gave occasion to the Ministers of England to enter the lists in matters of Faith, as shall bee conspicuous when wee come to speake thereof in its place. But to returne; her Majesty of Eng∣land sent Thomas Randolph, Post-master Generall, Ambassadour into Scotland, to divert, if either wisedome or pru∣dency could effect it, the Cloud of de∣struction hanging over Church and State; and to solicite for Morton, whose life and repute was in very great dan∣ger, to send away the Duke of Lenox, an Antagonist of the English Favou∣rites, and elevate the mindes of such whose affections were concentricall with them. Randolph shewes his Com∣mission from the Queen to his Maje∣sty and Counsell, making splended recitall of those many demirrits done to King and Kingdome, even when FRANCE sacrificed her whole strength for her destruction; but the Kingdome of Scotland by Gods bles∣sing upon the English Forces, had pul∣led her feet out from the French ty∣ranny,
and was at liberty; he insisted, likewise, that those tyes of Consan∣guinity and Religion, were sufficient Motives why she should strive to pre∣serve him; for all which merits she desires that Obegny, the endeavourer to subvert the Reformed Religion, ruine of ancient Families, the private and publike object of hatred; and as it was apparent by the intercepted Letters of the Bishop of ; that he onely stay∣ed for opportunity to innovate matters of State, should be exterminated the Kingdome, that Morian who was ac∣cused for the Kings death, should bee tryed after the usuall manner, that Archibald Douglas might be questioned without racking, that Jewes Balfoure, lately returned into his Countrey, be∣ing guilty of murthering the late King, and for many yeares had been a fomen∣ter of all uproares, might be impriso∣ned; and he accused Lenox of the same crimes. To which his Majesty gave answer, that for his Kinsman, in whom he had not found any crime; he was ready to satisfie the Law when ere he should be brought to his Triall; but it stood not with his honour to condemne a Noble
man without suffering him to plead his defence, or giving audience: but thus he seemed to question the liberty of the kingdom of Scotland, more then the re∣ports or deeds of Obigny; as for Morton he need not fear any punishment, before that he should be tried by his Peers, con∣cerning the crime whereof he was accu∣sed; and Archibald Douglas, who had set at nought the vigour of Judge∣ment by absenting himselfe, should have liberty to free himselfe from those most foule blots; but as for a prescription for future punishing, he could no ways condiscend thereto. Lastly it was un∣knowne to his Majesty, that James Bal∣foure was actor of so many out-ranges in his Dominions: And having thus said, Randolph earnestly desires the No∣bles to begge Mortons life of his Ma∣jesty: but being denyed, when he saw Prayers would not prevail, he menaced open warre. But the Ambassadours fulminations did not at all deterre his Majesties gene∣rous and sweet minde, who answered, that the fortune of a battle was incer∣taine, and he was ready to defend his owne Coasts. Hereupon Randolph grew more enraged, as if he had been inci∣ted
by the spurre of envy, determines rather to involve the State into further trouble, then according to his Com∣mission apply remedies to the present distractions, making Clandestine com∣binations with Lenox Competitors and Mortons friends; to whom he commi∣serated the deplorable condition of the times, that the King was fallen into the hands of a French-man, an enemy to the English, whose wicked desires aymed to reduce the ancient Families in Scotland into oblivion, bring the K. & Religion into danger; he declares how that there was only one doore left to escape out of, to free their Prince from the hands of a stranger, them∣selves from externall violence, and force: which if they would doe, he promiseth that the Queen of Eng∣land would furnish them with all con∣veniences. But this rash Counsell was presently made knowne to his Majesty: Ran∣dolph being conscientious of his viola∣ting of Embassage, got him privately to Barwick, and adviseth his accom∣plices Angusse and Marr to provide for their owne security. The King upon Lenox and Arrans
motion commanded the Earle of An∣gusse to retire himselfe beyond the river Spea, and to render up the Castles of Tencall and Douglasse. If hee executed his Majesties Mandates, there was some sparkles of pardon yet remaining; but if these Conditions should be rejected, let him look to be Proclaimed Rebell; but he knowing that there was nothing safe or sure from that wicked Guardi∣ans hands, fled into the Asylum Eng∣land, and Mar trade in his steps, being accompanyed with a great strength of his Faction, avoyded further dan∣ger by flight. Mens mindes begun to stagger by reason of the suddaine departure of the Embassadour, some striving to pal∣liate the foulenesse of flight, but the most supposed sad and turbulent blasts of distruction to approach. The English proclaime open warre, and yet the Scots were not long after them in preparing for common de∣fence, lest that some suddaine danger might bee brought upon them by the Exiles. Her Majosty of England sent downedivers Commanders with a great Army into Northumbrland: The King of Scotland, lest he should not be fitted
to embrace their threats, dispatched John Graham, Earle of Montrosse his Lieutenant, with a considerable strength of five hundred horse, & two thousand foot into the Borders of Scotland, to re∣straine any depopulations, if the war should be prosecuted; and by the com∣ming of the Lieutenant Generall Gra∣ham, the English were at a ne plus ultra, so that they did not any thing of note, unlesse it were to denounce, rather then prosecute warre. The Families of Humes, Carrs, and Scots, kept Garrison in the middle borders, Johnstons and Maxwells in the west, having a great Army of the Countrey people, who by keeping their watch and ward kept the Countrey in quiet. His Majesty had for his personall Guard ten foot Companyes, and some Troops of horse to defray their charges, he called a Par∣liament, and desired a Subsidy for to pay them: But the English disbanding their Army, gave the King occasion to dismisse his Guard. Arrans Guardian, who hating all that had reference to Morton, reassu∣med his fury against George Fleck, Mor∣tons sisters sonne, and Alexander Lawson, his intimate friend, whom hee brought
to the racke, to confesse such questions as were objected; he distorted Fleck with his Brazen rack and grim countenance for a long time, that he might extort from him those falshoods, that Atholl dyed insensibly of poyson given by Morton: but this was not of violence sufficient to draw the least syllable which might prejudice Morton: Lawson being of a cowardly degenerate spirit, at the very sight of the Tormentor, confessed the most secret intentions of his Patron, where his Treasure was, the feigned conspiracy, and a long Ca∣talogue of offences; but sooner would the Rack have divorced the soule from the body, then fidelity from the soule of Fleck: for when hee was brought back to the Torment, hee seemed to racke both the Racker, and Racke it selfe: It was not binding or buffetting, no nor yet the cruelty of those unmer∣cilesse men, which could induce him to betray Morton▪ Thus it appeared, that torments doe not moderate every mans Nature: the like cruelty hee exercised on the chiefe of the Douglasses; Thomas Douglas of Loghleven was accused of things concerning life, who answering by his Advocate, was removed into the
North of Scotland, James Douglas▪ and Archibald, the naturall sonnes of Morton, George their Bastard brother, Malcolme, Lord of Many, Sir John Gar∣michel, his intimate friend & kinseman were banished; and it was likewise pro∣claimed that none should harbour or relieve them with money, victuall, or other necessaries. To summe up all, he who was Guardian to Arran, is created Earle of Arrane, ascending by the steps of cruelty, and inhuma∣nity of nature to a greater degree of ha∣tred and malice in the eyes of all good men. Anno Domini 1581. The suddaine departure of Randolph so moved his Majesty, as that he sent without intermission, Sir John Seton Ambassadour into England to represent unto her Highnesse, his candor, with∣all to complaine of Thomas Randolph, who had rather beene a fomenter, then allayes of the hot flames, holding cor∣respondency with Angusse, Marr, and other Nobles in matters no lesse peril∣lous and cunning, then pernicious to the Kingdome of Scotland. Seton in that he was a friend of Lenox was com∣manded to stay at Barwicke, till the
Queens pleasure was further knowne, Where after some few dayes abode, without any entertainments of honour, returned home. Whereupon his Ma∣jesty grew incenced, and wholly dedi∣cated to anger, expostulated by Let∣ters that grievous affront offered to his Ambassadours, first to Alexander Hume, now to Sir John Seton, he grie∣vously accused Randolph for his flight out of Scotland, complained that Ar∣chibald Douglas of Whitingham impea∣ched for the the Kings death, his con∣science bearing him witnesse of the guilt, was resident publikely in the Court of England, desiring that hee might be apprehended and delivered ac∣cording to the League. The Queens Highnesse to wash away all the dirt of these criminations, answe∣red, that Randolph was one of an un∣stained fame, whose fidelity was per∣spicuous in every action▪ that hee was desirous of publike quiet in Scotland, having often both by hand and brain, action and Counsell beene their adju∣tor, and now he was ready to render an account of his ill-managed Embas∣sage before her Counsell, if any thing were objected. As for Archibald Douglas,
suspected for the late Conspiracy, his abode in the Court was only untill en∣quiry was made after those injected crimes; but in the future he should have no estimate of honour or imployment, although he remained in England, be∣ing of great use to the Queen & Coun∣sell, carrying himselfe as Ambassadour from the King of Scots, without any Mandate or Letters of trust, he set his wits to disturbe the weale-publike▪ of Scotland. Much about this time James Steuart constituted Guardian over the Earle of Arrane, by reason of his impoten∣cy of minde, (which I commemorated before) being not satiated with the title of Guardian, and enjoying many commodities thereby, he was, (as if led by a Deity) created Earle of Arrane, and confirmed by an Act of Parlia∣ment to the ruine of that Family, con∣trary to the Lawes and customes of their Predecessors: And this Omen Morton applyes to his owne ruine, re∣membring the old Prophesie, that hee must take heed of the Earle of Arrane; nor was his supposition meere Chime∣raes, for the first act of this new Earle was the death of Morton: and here we
may contemplate the variety of casual∣ties incident to him, as also the sports of fortune on him, now smiling, pre∣sently frowning, so that hee seemed to be tossed twixt the Rackets of honour and disgrace. Morton being conducted speedily by the Earles of Arrane and Montross, with a great traine of armed men, and two Troops of Horse unto Edenborough, there to be tryed before the Peers, who were assembled to heare him plead the matter, the day of his tryall appea∣ring, and according to the ancient custome of the Kingdome: there was a place of Judicature constituted, where Arguile Chancellour, Montrosse chiefe Justice for that day, and divers others of the Nobility, sate upon the Bench; the prisoner being produced from custo∣dy, excepted against Arguile, in that he was no competent Judge, by reason of enmity, and irreconcible hatred, against the Lord Seton, by reason of inveterate envy, and against Vaughton, for suspe∣cted pretences against the King and State. But exceptions against Judges were not granted. Morton openly pro∣fessed, that the proceedings were disor∣derly, and without president of Pre∣decessors.
The Earle of Arrane and Robert Chreton his Majesties Advocate, even to the height of envy prosecuted the crime of Regicide against him ve∣hemently, because he had consented to the murthering of the King, and subscribed to the crime in love to Both∣well; But besides these bitter and many percunctations of Arrane, the Kings Advocate violently urgeth a Manifest signed by Mortons owne hand, ur∣ging likewise the hatred hee bore the State after his relinquishing the Re∣gency. Morton after a large commemoration of his Offices for the publique, proceeds to wash his hands of that most horrid murther, not palliating it with fraudu∣lency: for seeing hee could not deny the proofes against him, that hee was privy to the murther revealed by Both∣well, being conscious of the detestable parracide: hee was condemned by the suffrages of the Nobility, and judge∣ment was denounced against him by Montrosse, who was invested with su∣pream authority for that time: because as the accuser pertinaciously affirmed he did not prosecute the Law against Ar∣chibald Douglas of Wittingham, his Fa∣vourite,
and that being conscious to that detestable fact revealed by Bothwell to him, he kept in silence, he was remo∣ved to prison, having a guard set over him, who were receivers of his words, fighs, and lookes, in that he was con∣demned he kept silence, his expectation of his last houre was firme: so that ha∣ving received that celestiall Manna of the Sacrament, his thoughts were con∣versant about eternity and immortall life. Those Ministers that were there present, desired him to give his soul the wings of courage, seeing that death was not to be lamented, whose conse∣quence was immortality. He not at all daunted, knowing the lease of his life was almost expired, detests those sublu∣naries, fixing his anchor of hope upon the shore of eternall safety: In the inte∣rim, the Earl of Arran inhumanely de∣nounceth his last necessity to approach, and desires him that ere he departed out of this pilgrimage, to subscribe a con∣fession of his criminations: but Mortons conversation being with heaven, having detruded all secular disturbances, ex∣claimed that he was interrupted by in∣humane & wicked words. He was atten∣tive to the Ministers admonitions go∣ing
undauntedly to the Market-place of Edenborough where he was to suffer; great was the concourse of people: and he not to be moved by the present feare of death, affected candor of speech and countenance, that his innocence in this paracide neither yet would he deny or dissemble, that Bothwel had solicited him for subscription to that truculent fact, but it was alwayes a Bug-beare and terrour to his thoughts: as for that hee did not give light to the crime, it was because hee was overswayed by feare of Bothwell's strong hand: and from fur∣ther progresse herein, he converted his speech to his God in meditated and composed prayers, not being unmind∣full of his Majesties fafety, the King∣domes tranquility, and the peoples in∣calumnity: having implored the most mercifull Fathers mercy, he shut up his prayers, desiring the Executioner to do his office. While he valiantly laid down his neck upon the fatall blocke, to the unspeakable sorrow of all; his head was parted from his body in the presence of that greedy spectator his enemy Farni∣hurst: the head in steed of its body was exalted to stand upon the common hal; his body was interred without any so∣lemnity
of funerall. Thus you have the last end of Mor∣ton, the last Prorex of Scotland: He had been for naturall prudency, moderati∣on, integrity, and industry, celebrated by the trumpet of Fame, if his extor∣ting of money had not stained his Ma∣gistracie, and that act of delivering up for a sum of money Piercy Earl of Nor∣thumberland who fled into Scotland, as if he had thirsted for his blood. Cruell Arran, not satiated with the punishment of so great a Peer, bended his nerves to eradicate the splendor of the Douglases, that his power might be established, he exterminated the Earl of Angus into England, and hayled many servants (whose fidelity to their Lords were permanent) unto punishment and torture; the consequencies of Mortons death were domestical dissentions, clan∣destine grudges, and calamities: In sine the death of the author of his death, the Earl of Arran. The next day John Bine one of Archibald Douglas servants was delivered to the truculency of a rope, in that hee participated in the Kings death; Dalkeith and Aberdower (the late Palaces and possessions of the Earle of Morton) unfortunate gifts were confer∣red
upon Lenox, nor with much better successe John Maxwell had the honour and title of Earl of Morton, in that it continued not long in that Family. And now that turbulent Earl of Ar∣ran seeing his corrivall removed, and the opposite faction laid in the dust, as∣cended from avarice & cruelty to wal∣low in the mire of lust, contracting himselfe in a filthy marriage with Eli∣zabeth Stuart the daughter of the Earl of Athol, who in her childish yeares be∣ing conjoyned in a nuptiall tye to the Earl of March, debased her selfe by a∣dultery with this new Earl for hope of domination, who did more fragrantly and constantly lust after her then her Husband did. And now seeing hee was Fortunes Favourite, nothing lesse would satisfie her, then to be his Wife and fellow ruler, striving to obtaine of the Ecclesiasticall Judges a divorce un∣der the pretext of impotency. No time was intermitted for the divorce, nor many days had not appeared in the hea∣vens ere the strife was determined, and the just and legitimate matrimony was dissolved. Thus shee that was the late bedfellow of Lenox, being divorst from his most noble sheets; her belly decla∣ring
her pregnancy, without delay took upon her the title of Countesse of Arran, a very bad president; thus Arran was in one and the same day Husband and Father of an Infant begot by an a∣dulterous act, in anothers matrymony, borne in his own: hence arise all those vulgar clamours of her immodesty, wantonnesse, luxury, and lascivious be∣haviour, not so much as her Followers but detested her incivility and his inso∣lency, desiring her to consider this un∣presidented act, from whom she had di∣vorst her selfe; was it not from one of the blood Royall, and his Majesties in∣timate? and was shee not branded ther∣by with dishonesty? But her heart was so obdurate to relent into teares, the woman being of an insolent and proud spirit, desirous of a potent Husband, passed without those bounds nature had prefixed, her sex requireth, and cu∣stome approves of: shee frequented vaulting flowers, usurped mens exerci∣tations. But I must stay my pen, lest these narrations intended for the pub∣lique good, may occasion private con∣tumelies, by reason of the similitude of cafualties. When the State was thus overclou∣ded,
a Parliament was summoned to appear at Edenborough for the admini∣stration of publique affairs, where O∣begny, whom Nobility, fame, and au∣thority had made great, ascended to the highest seat of favour & honour, and his creation of Duke of Lenox was confir∣med by the Parliament: He was arrived at that height of potency, as to govern things by his word: William Ruthen Treasurer was created Earl of Gowre, James Stuart Earl of Arran, John Max∣wel Earl of Morton, and Robert Stuart Earl of Orkney: it was likewise adjudg∣ed that the Douglasses should be proclai∣med Rebels, banished, and their goods confiscated; thus that Family who had deserved well of their Countrey, was detruded, and cut downe by the anger and hatred of this new erected man: their enemies set their inventions to coyne against them, and their tongues to threaten, that this popular name might become odious to the vulgar. The King seeing his Exchequer at an ebb, and the Kingdome in poverty, according to an act of Parliament then made, revoked the donations of his patrimony, seized on the confiscations
of mens estates, and reaped the first fruits, appointing limits for immo∣derate donations and graunts. He esta∣blished many Lawes commodious for the publique, and composed those pri∣vate dissentions twixt the Cordones and Forbosses, which arose about their bounders. The tenths and thirds of Ec∣clesiasticall Livings were employed for the sustentation of the Ministry, and o∣ther pious offices, the revenues of the Monasteries were confiscated, and the rents brought into the Exchequer to support the publique treasury. By this time behold the Earle of Ar∣ran ready to burst with the too much indulgency of Lady Fortune, nay dege∣nerating even from civility, so that hee rejected the Duke of Lenox society, ben∣ding his strength to undermine him, an act not a little offensive to the Prince, the first alination of affections arose from an affront offered unto one of the Dukes retinue by the Lord Seton and his son John. His Majestie beholding what a Charibdis his Kinsman the Duke sayled in, was so far enraged as to dimove Arran from being Captaine of the guard, commanding him not to approach the Court or the Kings pre∣sence,
nor think of being received into favor, unles he first submitted: he depar∣ted from the Court to Kennel and there enjoyed the pleasures of his possessiōs, untill some happy mediators stood in the gap to make a reconciliation. Thus after a short divorce, the Dukes minde by the intercession of friends was allay∣ed, and an act of oblivion signed by both parties, and a reconciliation of fa∣vour made, which from that day was inviolably observed, both endeavouring with an equall vertuous impetuosity to lay low their Antagonists strength, both associated ther heads to keep their withstanders under. The young noble Earl of Mar who was suspected to be a Favourite of the Douglasses, was remo∣ved from the Court, but his return was obtained by his Mother, who had ob∣tained the crowne of many gray haires, and a continued power with his Maje∣sty, both by her grave behaviour, and great care had over his childe-hood, which shee transacted with all the fide∣lity of an honest breast. The King well knowing that Reli∣gion was in her waine, that the title and honour of King was at a lesse com∣mand, enjoyned John Crage his Maje∣jesties
Chaplain, to set forth a confessi∣on of faith in the English tongue, which contained the doctrines of Christian Religion, concerning God, the Creati∣on, Originall sin, the Law, grace, the Incarnation of the Word, the hyposta∣ticall union, Christs passion, Resurre∣rection, ascencion, the holy Ghost, the Church, Scriptures, Fathers, Counsels, Sacraments, and controverted questions in Divinity. The King established it by Parliament, who having concorded in a forme of administring the Sacraments, all subscribed to the doctrine and disci∣pline of the Church of Scotland, prote∣sting that they would observe and de∣fend it with all their endeavours against oppositions. The King and his Follow∣ers first subscribed; next he desired the Nobles and Citizens to subscribe, with all exhorting them to embrace the true Religion, relieve the Poor, have an eye to the succourlesse and fatherlesse: Hee admonished the Ministry not to inter∣medle with State affaires, but to preach the Gospell, administer the Sacraments, instruct the ignorant, call back the wic∣ked from their wayes of errour, and the scandalous from their wallowing in filthinesse, to draw the people from
luxrious living and licentiousnesse un∣to continency, and observation of the Churches discipline, to make up the breaches of civill dissention amongst the Nobility, and to be carefull of the Churches peace, dignity, and safety. And lastly to excite the people if no o∣ther wayes, yet by a strict discipline to follow vertue and obedience. The authority of the Ministerial fun∣ction was unanimously consented to by Parliament, and that no other govern∣ment Ecclesiasticall should be set up in Scotland, save such as they agreed upon; and that all those dayes whom antiqui∣ty had set apart for holy remembrances, were not to be kept holy, or any cele∣bration in apparel or solemn rites, were to be used thereon. The Ministers having got such a large Commission into their hands, be∣gun to attempt greater matters, as to pull downe the Prelaticall dignity. For in the Synod held at Glasgow, where Ro∣bert Ponton was Prolocutor, the Episco∣pall authority was abrogated, Patricke Adamson Arch-Bishop of Saint Andrews, James Bode Arch-Bishop of Glasgow, David Cunningham Bishop of Aberdeen. Nigell Cambell who was the pearl of that
Function, Bishop of Arg. & many other Superintendents, whose vertue & lear∣ning had given them the lustre of fame: these were stiffe defenders of the Pre∣lates cause and dignity, 'gainst the facti∣on and potency of such Ministers, who sought by their maliciousnesse towards Episcopacy to get applause, labouring with wind and tide to root out Bishops. These men in a full house by suffrages and favour prevailed, so that it was concluded by Votes to abrogate the Prelates authority, which David Lind∣sey afterwards installed Bishop of Rosse, desired to adjourn to the next Conven∣tion, his desires were frustrate, and him∣selve reviled by many, who protested his words were intollerable burthens to their consciences, and himself not wor∣thy to beare any Ecclesiasticall Office▪ who patronized the most corrupt Prela∣ticall Function: many there were, who est they might seeme to strive against the streame, went downe with their tide to eradicate the Prelaticall splen∣dor. Fame slept not till she had acquain∣ted his Majestie with the Synods pro∣ceedings herein, and Lindseyes interces∣sion, the King having first consulted
with his Counsell, (who hee knew were most emminent both for wise∣dome and favour with the peo∣ple) what would be most convenient to the Kingdomes present condition, and being displeased at the affronts and injuries offered to the Bishops, decla∣red by a Messenger, that their procee∣dings were every way displeasing unto him, and that he would apply a medica∣ment in due time. But they absolutely denyed, that they were ready to embrace any change in their opinions, declaring that the Regency of Church-affaires by the Sy∣nods Decree was at their disposall; and they having finished their work, begged of his Majesty, to let his Proclama∣tions issue forth concerning the Dis∣cipline of the Church, giving his Roy∣all assent to the Synods determinati∣ons. But the King crushed their desires by a denyall; because he fore-saw a great cloud of troubles to come from that act of Abrogating Episcopacy, and erecting by his command the Presby∣teriall Discipline: he therefore hoped that they would, nay admonished them to desist from prosecuting their intem∣pestuous desires, and not to abuse the
power put into their hands to the Kingdomes destruction, by framing things after the modell of their wills, or strive the diruating the Prelates au∣thority. Thus the established Discipline of the Church runne with a more powerfull streame amongst the Nobility, Magi∣stracy, and ignorant vulgar, though lesse favour with the King, by reason of their pride and arrogancy, who had not onely by his power put life into their semi-mortified Authority, but also established their potency over the people. But whilst these things were upon the Stage, his Majesty ceased not to adde vertue and knowledge to those his naturall Dowries, adorning the Cabi∣net of his breast with true Orientall Pearle, sporting himselfe with riding the great Horse, Tilting, and Hun∣ting. The yeare drawing to a period, tur∣bulent Horiferous even wel-nigh over∣turned the Arke of the Church, for James Boyd, having taken up his resi∣dence with the wormes, resigned his Chaire of Glascow to his Successor; the strife thereabout was so vehement, that
it had almost brought the Kingdome into a fit of distraction: in conclusion, Robert Montgomery Preacher at Sterlin, who was both an eye-soare to the Cler∣gy and Commons, ascended to the E∣piscopall chaire, by the Duke of Lenox ayde: yet at the instigation of some friends, more looking upon their own utility then his dignity, lent him his hand to get the Mitre, upon the Con∣tract, that the Title and 1000 pounds annually should be involved upon him, not looking to reap any further fruit of his Benefice: The report hereof tooke the wings of the winde, and arrived at the ignorant multitude, and at the eares of some young Grammarians, who by their Orations blew up those Coales of Contention to a great flame of envy amongst the Nobles and Commons. Whereupon the Episcopall Antagonists take courage to spit infamous Grana∣does from the Pulpit in the face of Montgomery, contaminating his whole life, as if unworthy ro beare rule in the Church. But the Privy Counsell calling these men to an account, reproved them with great bitternesse of speech, giving them to understand, that an Election having
the Kings consent, ought to be obeyed, and that for the good and profit of the weale-publike: Likewise they declared, that Montgomery was commanded to succeed by that authority devolved up∣on his Majesty: they therefore gave warning from any further Processe in such mollestations, but quietly to ac∣knowledge them their Diocesians whom his Majesty should assigne. Thus did the State stand for the present: but the fiery Spirits of the Ministers could not be extinguished: what the issue will be, the next yeare will declare. FINIS.
