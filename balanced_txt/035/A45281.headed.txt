An Account OF THE Famous Prince GIOLO, &c. THis famous Prince that has been so often seen by the curious with a great deal of admiration, though they could behold nothing but his outside; so taking was the rarity and niceness of the figures printed on his body: But it troubled some of the more sensible that for want of an interpreter none could consider him within, both as to know from his own mouth the fortunes he had run through, and what his sentiments were of his present conditi∣on from whence they might make a probable Guess, whether he were really a Man of that Birth, which those that were new proprietors of his person gave out, or else some mea∣ner slave, who gain'd the Reputation of a Prince in his easy Captivity for his masters advantage: Some few weeks since a Dutch Merchant that had resided sometime at the Dutch factory, in the Isle of Celebes, which is the next Island to the West of Gilolo, the place of the Nativity of this Prince, happen'd to go with some other friends, and acquaintance of his to see him, and had the good fortune to have a perfecti∣on in the language of the Celebeans, which the Prince also understood, having been Captive there some years before he was Transported for England: This accident was not a little satisfaction to a Gentleman of my acquaintance, who was by chance to see him at the same time, and therefore it be∣ing toward evening, and the last time he should be shown that night, my friend profer'd the Dutch Merchant, his friends and those that showed the Prince, a Collation, that they might make some enquiry into the truth of his story; which
motion being accepted by all parties, the rest of the Specta∣tors being now gone, and having a Room to themselves, they proceeded to ask him some questions: So soon as the Prince perceiv'd one that he could understand, he seem'd a little sa∣tisfy'd for a while, but then presently something Melancho∣ly, and sighed very much; which the Dutch Merchant en∣quiring into; He returned him this answer: I was I confess something pleas'd after so long a Consinement of my mind, as well as person, to meet with one that understood me; but when I thought to unbosome my thoughts and griefs to you, I reflected it was but a fruitless happiness to discover that to one that had not the will to hear me for any thing, but the Satisfaction of his own Curiosity, without any desire for my redress: Which stopt the Current of what I had to say, and added to my former griefs, that though I had now sound one that understood me, yet I could not to any purpose discover my secret sorrows to him with any hopes of Relief, and for a wise man to do an unprofitable action, levels him to the Capacity of Women that little consider the consequence of their Words or Actions. As soon as he had said this he held his Tongue, and sigh∣ed several times, with a great deal of Ardour; and before the Merchant had interpreted this to the company he inter∣rupted him, and ask'd what part of his World he had been in, that he spoke the language of his Enemies the Celebeans, and how long he had been from thence? He answered him, near five years. Ah then return'd the Prince, you can't tell me any thing of my unhappy Princess of Tominec, nor how she bears the loss of her wretched Giolo? The Dutch Mer∣chant having not that tender sympathy for the misfortunes of a lover, as this discover'd the Prince to be, had much ado to forbear laughing aloud, but fearing that might hinder him from what he desir'd, he check'd his unreasonable mirth, and told him he had never been at Tominec, having resided all his time in Gioan on the West-side of the Island, whereas Tominec was on the East, which is now call'd Sion since the King of that part was a Christian; but was sorry he could not give him some information about that he ask'd. As soon as he had given the Company an account of this, my friend desir'd him
to assure him he would take care to send to the Dutch Factory on that Island, to make an enquiry about it to his satisfaction, on condition he would gratify the Company by him, with the Relation of his Birth, and Fortunes, and the Religion, and Manners of his Native Country. Though it be no comfort to me to refresh my Memory with the thoughts of what I was (reply'd the Prince) which I ought rather for my own satisfaction to endeavour to forget in my present Circumstances, yet in hopes of so great a reward as to hear from my Adorable Princess, I will make all my wounds bleed afresh, nay and my heart too, if that would satisfy you. The Place of my Nativity, you must know then, was Moangis a City in the Noble Island ofThis Island is in the Indi∣an Ocean un∣der the Equi∣noctial Line in 152 Degrees, & 30 Minutes of Longitude. It's something of the Form of an Anchor, & contains seve∣ral Towns; the Chief of which are Gilolo, Cuma, Atongo, Moangis. To West it has the Famous Island of BORNEO, which is remarkable for being governd by a Queen, and not a King; who has the liberty of what Men she pleases, and the Children are distinguished by the Name of the Mother, not the Father, because they would be sure to have a True Heir to the Crown, which cannot fail by this Measure. Between this Island of Borneo (which is the biggest in the World, some affirming that 'tis three months Sail about) and Gilolo, lies te Island of Celebes, near five times as big as Gilolo, and governed by several Kings. Gilolo is said to be half as big as Italy, and has to the North the Isle of Mindanao, to the South Ceram, to the East betwixt it and New Guinea, lies the Land of Papeus. Gilolo; King of which, was my Father: I had but one Brother, nam'd Moraballo, who (by being ill) escap'd the Misfortune that befel my Royal Father and my self. This Isle of Gilolo, call'd also Batachina and Moangis, from the three Kingdoms which it formerly contain'd, till my Fa∣thers Predecessors subdu'd that of Moangis, and joyn'd it to Gilolo. It is of large extent, being much bigger than Zilon: It abounds with a delicious Food call'd Rice, and Wild Hens; and on the Sea-coasts we find a sort of Shell-fish, which in tast much resembles your English Mutton. We have a Tree too of great use and beauty, which affords us Bread and Drink; for of the pith we make our Bread, and of the juice we make a most delicious Liquor, much beyond any I have tasted since my loss of my own Country; the Name of this Tree is Saga. Our People are tall and proportionable, at least in our eyes; our Women are the most beautiful in the world, except the Prin∣cess
of Tominec, the Mistress of my Soul. You Christians have a Factory in the Town of Batchame, with a Fort to de∣fend it. As for the Religion we profess, 'tis of late years something vary'd from what it was of old, when our progenitors a∣dor'd many Gods; but now we have receiv'd a new Prophet, that brought us to the Knowledge of one God, which in∣deed, tho an innovation in our Belief and Custom, bore so much of Reason, that it easily gain'd admittance with the wiser sort; for domestick experience gave us some know∣ledge how inconvenient it would be in Heaven to have many commanders, since our own Isle had suffer'd so much under Civil divisions by having more than one (and at that time it had a great many) from this new Prophet we have this Tra∣dition of the Creation of the World (which we knew no∣thing of before) that God proceeding from himself, for his own satisfaction and Glory, Created certain Spirits call'd Angels, in number thirty three; their names were, 1 Bhamun, 2 Aeudibehest, 3 Sheherever, 4 Asfendemud, 5 Khordaad, 6 Mur∣daad, 7 Depaader, 8 Azer, 9 Abaau, 10 Chorshead, 11 Mah, 12 Fire, 13 Gosh, 14 Depmeher, 15 Mehur, 16 Rusuij, 17 Shoroth or Gabuel, 18 Sonaurdien, 19 Plyraad, 20 Baam, 21 Goijadd, 22 Deapdein, 23 Dein, 24 Arshasung, 25 Austaad, 26 Asmaan, 27 Zemyaad, 28 Meherusfund, 29 Ahueraan, 30 Vumudsittur, 31 Homazed, 32 Berzeezed, 33 Raagdust. To each of these Angels we assign an office; the first and greatest being Bhamun, to him is delivered the charge of all living Creatures, man excepted: The next to him in esteem is Aeu∣dibehest, who has the charge of fire; to the third, all sorts of Metals are Committed; the fourth has the charge of the earth, and ground; the fifth is Lord of all the Watry World both sweet, and salt, Rivers Fountains, and Sea; the sixth is the preserver of Trees. Man, and the charge of all mankind, God has reserv'd for himself: The seventh is a servant to God, the 8th is an as∣sistant of Aeudibehests, the 9th is assistant to Chordaad; the 10th has charge of the Sun, as the 11th has of the Moon; the 12th is companion to Chordaad, the 13th is servant to Bhamun, the 14th is an Attendant on God, the 15th Me∣hur
has the charge to stand on a great bridge call'd Chawood Pulseraunt, over which the souls of all that dye are to pass, but when they came there this Angel stops them, and calls them to an account for the Transactions of their lives, and with a pair of scales in his hand weighs their good deeds a∣gainst their bad; if the good out-weigh the bad one hair of of the Eye lid, he sends them to Heaven, for 'tis hard that a man should be condemn'd to punishment, who in his life has done more good than harm; but if their evil deeds be more ponderous, he sends them to Hell. The Rewards for their good Actions are divided into se∣ven distinct Mansions of Heav'n, and the Torments of Hell have the same number of divisions; this Angel has the as∣sistance of the 16th by name Rusuii, to whose charge the scales are deliver'd, and Mehur sits as Judge of the weight. Gabuel the 17th has Commission to over-see the whole World, and the Actions thereof; to take a peculiar care of what God has created, and to preserve them from the devil; the 18th is an assistant to Cherdaad, 19th assistant to Aeudibehest, the 20th an obedient servant to Bhamun, the 21st servant to Khordaad, 22d servant to God Almighty, 23d servant to As∣fendemud, 24th Lord of Knowledge, and servant to Asfen∣daamud, whose business 'tis to provide for the necessities of the living Creatures of Gods infinite Store-house, which is com∣mitted to his charge; the 25th is an assistant to Murdaad, the 26th to Sheherever, 27th to Murdaad, the 28th servant to Asfendaamud, the 29th servant to Sheherever; the 30th Vamudsittur, is Lord of the seven Hells, and appoints punish∣ments proportionable to their sins, and rebukes the fury, and envy of the devil, who would otherwise Tyrannize over sinful Souls beyond their appointed Torments; the 31st is Lord of the Sea, being companion of Khordaad, the 32d is servant to the former; the 33d is servant to Gabuel. After God had created the Angels, he employ'd them in the Creation of the Heavens, which were finished in forty - five Dayes: After which, a terrible Darkness appear'd 96000Each Fur∣long is Three Miles. Fur∣longs distant from God; which when he perceived, he consi∣dered with himself, that some Enemy of his was produc'd, and that he was very strong; which prov'd to be the Devil. Where∣fore
he commanded Aeudibehest, Azer, Shoroth, and Rhy-Rhaam to Fight with him, and bind and bring him prisoner. The Divel was produc'd from himself, and in imitation of God, created Angels, or Evil Spirits; whose Names are 1 Gojusta-gonahmino-minedate servant to the Devil, 2 Ashmogh, 3 Kendorkha, 4 Duria Atkoman: These four Devils have com∣mand to make Wars, Distractions, Confusions, and Enmities in the World. The 5 Durca-zimstaen-seezud, 6 Asbaackcheez, 7 Asfogegger: These three Devils have charge of cold Winds, Snow, Rain, and have order to destroy all that God has on the Earth. The 8 Boosyath-tereth, 9 Okadrooge, 10 Askaanesh∣drooge, 11 Aasenethdrooge: These four Devils are ordered to destroy Mettals, and to eat them up with Rust, which God hath created. 12 Oosola, 13 Goaud, 14 Dosfrayum: These are charg'd to attend Schools, where Children are brought up, to prevent them, and entice them from learning good Lit∣terature, and seduce them to all Evil Wayes. 15 Aaen, 16 Taazeechden, 17 Zaazeethden: These have order to infuse unlawful Lusts and Desires, and covetous longings after what is not our own; to tempt men to sin by Uncleanness, Rapine, Murder, &c. 18 Tosoos, 19 Peliarii, 20 Turdoom-Vashour, 21 Fraage-Gurnad: These Devils have order to destroy the Fruit of the Trees, Earth, and all that tends to the Nourish∣ment of Man. 22 Heshun, whose charge is when men dye, to take their Souls out of their Bodies: He has twenty hands, and is very Terrible; his Title is Melick Almud, The King of Death. The Devil having prepar'd this Army, 'twas time for God to look about him: Whereas I have said, he sent the four Angels to Fight him; who after a sharp Battle took the great Devil Asemau prisoner, and brought him to Heaven, from whence he broke prison, and run away. Upon which another sharp War ensued, wherein the Devil was brought to terms of extremity. He desired Quarter, and yielded himself up to the Mercy of the Conqueror. Upon which God considered with himself, That if he should utterly destroy the Devil, and all his generation, his own Glory and Mercy would not so evi∣dently appear, as it would if he suffered the Devils darkness and cruelty to have a being; else that there could be no di∣stinction
between Good and Bad, Vice and Vertue. On these considerations God did not utterly destroy the Devil, but suf∣fered him to have a being in the world, on this Account, That whatsoever Good should fall out, or be done in the world, should be attributed to God; and whatsoever Evil, should be charged on the Devil. Then, as for the time of the continuance of the World, and the Devil, we hold, that it was ordered by God, the World from the first Creation, should continue twelve thousand Years; three thousand then being expired at the Conquest of the Devil and his Angels; the remaining nine thousand Years, God di∣vided into three parts, and holding up three of his Fingers, ordered the Devil to choose which he would. The meaning was, what time he would choose to exercise his cruelty in a∣gainst Mankind. The Devil, after a seeming pause, chose the middle finger of the Three, and consequently the middle Time. Wherefore, by the fatal necessity of this decree, all humane affairs are subject to inconstancy; nor can there be any settled state of things for any long duration. In the first time, Justice, Moderation, Temperance and Piety to God; and man flourished, when the world enjoyed Peace and Tranqui∣lity. From which, by the temptation of the Devil, through Fase, Peace, and Pride, falling and rebelling against God, the Devil is permitted to infect and disturb the world with Vices, contrary to those former Vertues; as Injustice, Violence, Pride, Lust, and Avarice: And all manner of Impieties, both to God and Man, swell to the greatest exorbitancies; and consequent∣ly the effects thereof, Wars, Distractions, and the other scourges of God, as Famine, Pestilence, and Desolation: Which God, out of his infinite mercy and pity to Mankind, and the World, will not suffer to rage for ever; but bridles the fury and malicious envy of the Devil, and interposes a breathing time of happiness and tranquility. Of the twelve thousand Years first decreed for the duration of the World, nine hun∣dred sixty-two remain, when we expect a day of Judgement of all Mankind, and the dissolution of the World. And then as soon as all the dead shall have risen, and received their doom, the Righteous shall immediately enjoy the Heavenly Vision of God, and be placed in glorious mansions, proportionable to
their good deeds and merits on earth; and the Wicked having in their souls received condign punishment for their Sins, in those several torments which were appointed them by the Angels Mehur, and Vumudsittur, shall at the day of Judge∣ment also rise, and their sins, by the infinite mercy of God, be pardoned, and themselves be admitted into certain outward mansions, where they shall at a distance, be blessed with the Heavenly Vision; only they shall be distinguished from the Just, by certain Spots, which shall be mark't in their Foreheads. At the day of Judgement, the Devil and all his Angels, shall be Judged, and their Kingdom utterly destroyed. The World was created in this order: The Heavens in forty five dayes; The Water in sixty; The Earth in seventy five; The Trees in thirty; The Creatures in eighty; Man in se∣venty five dayes. Yaxatend was the Name of our Prophet, from whose death we begin our Aera, which is now 1052. Years. We Believe also, That to do any Injury to another, is a hainous crime, and not to be pardoned without an equivolent Reparation; That Ingratitude out-weighs at Pul , al∣most all ones good Works; especially if we presevere in it till our death. We Believe a private sin against another more hainous than a publick one; And that he that betrayes under the name of a Friend, is certainly damn'd to the lowest of the seven Hells I have mentioned. For our duty to God, we are not oblig'd to many Prayers; only that we make all our Actions such: Fine words are not likely to prevail with God, when the actions contradict his pleasure. Praises we are bound to thrice every day, for the benefits of preservation; The past night for Food, and Preservation the past day. Priests we have but three in the Island, one to each Kingdom; who is employ'd continually in Praising the God of Heaven and Earth, without any regard to the goods of this Life; and when any publick benefit accrues to the whole Kingdom, then this Minister appears in a pompous and solemn manner, and returns (in the presence of the chief of the Nation) Thanks as publick as the favour Receiv'd. As for other occasions, we are every one his own Priest: And our Parents are obliged under pain of death, to instruct us in the Law of our Prophet;
so that when we appear before the Judges of the Country, we may be able to give a full account of all its parts. We are of Opinion, that as Ingratitude weighs heavier than an abundance of good Works; so Generosity, and the doing good to those in distress, will countervail all the ill Actions of our Life, provided they be not injurious to our Neigh∣bours, in wronging them in their Estates, Possessions, and Reputations. 'Tis an offence against our Laws, also (for the same are the Laws of our Religion as of our State) for any Parent for any interest whatever to force the Inclinati∣ons of their Children; that so as they have no other bond but Love, the Husbands and Wives might continue together during their Life with Pleasure and Content, and beget Children that should inherit the Virtues and Beauties of their Parents, who are led to Generation by the Dictates of Love, not Duty. Dissimulation in Love is accounted an un∣pardionable fault, and which by our Laws is Punishable when discovered, which after possession cannot well be hid. Parents are obliged to give Satisfaction for all the Crimes their Children commit till they die; because if they gave them a severe and virtuous Education, they would not be sub∣ject to such extravagances; and Masters that are cruel to their Servants, are obliged to be publick Slaves for a propor∣tionable time, till they are better instructed in the chances of Human Life. Servants that are refractory and disobedi∣ent, are put to death, as are all Rebels without any Tryal; every Man being free to destroy such disturbers of the Pub∣lick Peace. Thus Sir, I have given you an account of the State, and my Birth and Place of Nativity, and wish you cou'd dispense with a more particular account of my Life, because it will set before my eyes the remembrance of what I have been, and render my present Captivity the more insupportable. The Merchant gave the Company a particular account of all the Prince had said, which my Friend took in Short-hand, and then begged him to press Giolo to give them an account of his Life and adventures, since by his unwillingness to re∣late them, made them suppose contain'd something extraor∣dinary and surprizing. The Dutch-man, tho' not so desirous
of hearing any more as the rest, was yet prevailed upon to soli∣cite the common satisfaction, which with some importunities he obtained. And thus the Prince begun. I have already informed you, that the Isle of Gilolo is di∣vided into three parts, which were once three distinct King∣doms, and that my Fathers Predecessors had subdued one of the other two; in the third, that is called Batachina, Verg∣had, an Old Warlike Prince, that had lost all his fourteen Sons in the Wars and incursions that had been made into his Country by the Kings of , who had formerly great part of that Kingdom in their Possessions; but by the Prowess of this Prince were driven out, and after many attempts to recover their sooting there, finding it to no purpose, gave it over; tho' in those long Wars he had lost his Sons, yet he had two Daughters, one very Beautiful, whom in the begin∣ning of his resolution of casting off the Forreign Yoak, was Married to my Father, to joyn him to his interests, whose power was sufficient to obstruct all his desires of freedom: She bore my self, and another Brother, that I hope lives still to keep up the Honour of our Kingdom, and one Daughter Beautiful as her self had been, but not so sweet and candid a humour, being too much a lover of her self, and revengeful, not easily forgetting what she thought an injury done to her Father and my self, as the sequel of my Story will make evident. By that time we were grown up to Men and Wo∣mens estate, the King of Batachina, our Grandfather by my Mother, had lost all his Sons in the Wars I have mentioned, who had left no Issue among them all but one Daughter; so that in all probability that Kingdom would fall to my Father in the right of his Wife, upon the Death of his Father-in-Law Giolo (for that was his Name, and for his sake, had it conferr'd upon me) who was now very Old; and his other Daughter died for grief of the loss of so many of her Brothers, whom she tenderly loved. But the Old King finding he had no Issue Male to succeed him (and unwilling to have his Family and Name bury in another that was a Stranger, only by the Marriage of his Daughter, which Match he had not consented to, had it not then been necessa∣ry for his Interest so to have done) resolved to Marry a∣gain,
to see if he could get a Son of his own in his Old Age to inherit his Name, and that Kingdom he had re∣deemed by the loss of so much of his own and Childrens Blood from the hands of insulting Forreigners. He Mar∣ries therefore a young Beautiful Lady of but a mean extraction, for the Bed of a Prince; by her had none but Girls, and those of a very short Life: Therefore finding Fate had so Ordained it, that my Father should infallibly suc∣ceed him in his Crown (his Grand daughter, and all being now dead) he seat to have him remove to his City of re∣sidence, called Batachina, as the whole Kingdom was, that he might in his Life-time make him acquainted with, and easie to the People. The time of our departure being come, my Brother was to be left Vice-Roy of his Kingdoms, tho' he included he also should go with him at this time to pay his respects to his Grand-father; but God ordered it for his happiness, that the day that we were to go, he was ta∣ken ill, and obliged by that to stay behind; therefore my Sister and I were to accompany my Father and Mother by Sea in a small Vessel, in which being invited by the calmness of the Weather, he was resolved to coast along the shore to Batachina, secure of any danger in the midst of so great an attendance as went along with him in several other small Boats. But after the first dayes Journey, when it grew to∣wards Night, my Father commanded the Master of the Vessel to steer farther out to Sea, and so cut off a great nook that bent in several Miles into the Land; and so before it was very late hoped to reach the Cape where he intended to go ashore, and pass some days till he had dispatched some Messengers before to the Court of Giolo, to inform him of his coming; and if the Weather altered, designed to go from thence by Land. But so it was, that the Heavens had decreed my misfortune; and in that my Fathers, Mothers, tho' not my Sisters. Night came farther on than the King my Father imagined; and that which hapned, was the rising of the Clouds, and with them a Wind and Storm, which bore our Vessels out to Sea farther than we desired, and by the next Morning, after, with a great deal of pains and difficulty, we had kept the Royal Vessel above Water all Night, we
found our selves far from any shoar, and out of sight of any Land, all alone without any Boat near us to bring us any relief, if we should be attacqued by any Pyrate, which happened soon after we began to fear it; for those of the Isle of Celebes being great Pyrates, happened to have a Ves∣sel of theirs come in sight of us, by the first approach of day, whether driven that way by the force of the Storm, or by their own uncertain rowings in search of Prize, I know not; but in short, made up to us, and soon took us, and with us sail'd home to Tominec, of which City they were. And being come thither, by the ornaments of our Flesh they perceived we were of the Royal Family, and therefore pre∣sented us to the King, who being a haughty proud Man, had no regard to our Birth and Quality, but despising us in our present misfortune, used us like Slaves; but he had cast an Eye of regard on my Sister, whose Beauty indeed was extraordinary, and daily solicited her to yield to his embra∣ces, which with some little opportunities she yielded to, and was delivered from the troubles of a Captivity to live a Queen, as she was born a Princess. But now, neither Na∣ture nor Honour made her remember her Parents or Bro∣ther, preferring a little pet she had taken against us, to all the duties of a Child and Sister; she rather contributed to our Misery, than sought us any relief, which soon broke the heart of her Father and Mother, to whom I took care with my own hands to give a Decent, tho' not Royal Burial. But before I proceed to tell you the misfortunes of my Love, it would be some ease to me to breath a little, and to give you some account of the place of my Captivity, where I was not confin'd, as I am here from sight of the Country. Tominec therefore is the Name of a City and Kingdom in the Isle ofThis Island is very large, at least fourty times as big as Gilolo, and go∣verned by ma∣n Kings; three of which are said of late to be Converted to the Christian Religion, and for that cause much hated by their Heathenish Subjects, who thereupon Rebelled against them. It is Scituate West of the Molucca, and has therein a Town called Sion. Honoured with the abode of one of their Christian Kings, so called since his Conversion; having before that, the Name of Cian, or Gioan. It has other Cities, as Nivon in the South. Finiltio, Durate, Fedlti and Botbol on the North. On the East, Tominec, Gape, Tubuco, Buta. To the West, the Chief City Celebes, which gives Name to the Island and Origni, Moritan, Gioan afore∣said, Telto, Eaxta, Macassar. Celebes, which Island is very large and
rich, the Soil thereof exceeding fertile, the People tall and comely, of a curious Ruddy Colour much given to Piracy. The whole Island is Governed by many Kings, and with as many Gods, which is the cause of much Contention, and many Quarrels. The People of the Kingdom of Tominec have very little notion of a Deity, so that you will find no tract of Religion among them, Sacrifices and Prayers they know not. They say the Earth is their Indulgent Mother, who furnishes them with all things necessary for Life, yet they are not contented with that, but seek the increase of their Wealth, as Slaves by Piracy. If any one discourse to them about a God and the Mysteries of Religion; they answer, as if they thought it a Jest, Friend thou art very eloquent and sub∣tile, I wish I could talk as well as thee: Nay, they say some∣times, that if they should be perswaded by such Discourses, their Neighbours would laugh at them; yet for all this, they have a Natural sentiment of some Divinity or Superior Power that hath its residence in Heaven, which they say is content to enjoy quietly the delights of his own Felicity, without being offended at the ill actions of Men, and is endued with so great goodness, as not to take any Revenge even of his Ene∣mies, which makes them render Heaven neither Honour nor Adoration; interpreting its literality, and long sufferings as an effect of its weakness or indifference towards Mankind; be∣lieving, that there are a number of good and evil Spirits; the good being their Gods, and every one imagines, that he has one designed for his conduct, yet will not acknowledg them the Creators of the World; and when I have told them, that I adore that God which made Heaven and Earth, and causeth the Earth to bring forth Fruits and Herbs for our Nourishment, and binds the Divel from doing us too much harm, they will only laugh at me for my pains. When they recover from any Disease, they set a little Table, and upon one end of it their Offerings, but without the least Adora∣tions or Prayers; yet sometimes they invocate their Gods; but by proxy, that is by their Priests, and that upon four occasions; to demand Revenge; to be healed of Diseases; to know the event of their Warrs; and to invocate them to drive away their great Devil, for they never Pray to him:
His Invocation is by singing some Words, and burning some herbs, the scent of which is so pleasant, that it makes this Devil appear: And as their several Priests invocate their several Gods at one time, these Gods or rather Devils, rail, quarrel, and seem to sight with each other. These Devils suffer themselves sometimes to see bones of dead men taken out of the Graves, and wrapt in Cotton, and thereby give O∣racles, saying 'tis the Soul of the deceased Person; they make use of them to bewitch their Enemies, the Sorcerer wrapping up these bones, with something that belongs to the Enemy. These Devils do sometimes too enter into the bodies of Wo∣men, and speak by them, clearly answering all Questions de∣manded: After the Boy or Priest is retired, the Devil stirs the Vessels, and makes a Noise with his Jaws, as if he were eating and drinking the presents prepared for him; but the next day they find he has not meddled with any thing: These poor Wretches complain, that sometimes the Devil beats them, and shew on their bodies the visible marks of the blows they have received; sometimes they make horri∣ble Complaints of his Cruelty. You must not expect any great Morals from them that have so ill a Guide as the Devil. Rapine, Injustice, and Treache∣ry, are the Ingredients that compose them: The Nobler sort of Women are very beautiful, particularly the Princess of Terhenahete Sister to the King of Tominec, whose Slave it was my fortune to be, not only by the will of that King, who presented me to her, but also by Love, which had added a great deal to my Captivity. I know not how it came to pass, but this lovely Princess, after I had served her some time, begun to shew me a more favourable aspect than usually, and would often make me tell the Adventures of my Life, and the unlucky Accident of my Fathers Royal Voyage, which he seem'd, as I did my self, both to pity and rejoyce at; the more she admitted me to her Converse, the more I was ena∣mour'd of her Perfections, and forgetting the condition For∣tune had now reduc'd me to, thought I might have the Pri∣viledge to discover my Passion to her; which being over-heard by one of my Fellow Slaves, was immediately carry'd to the King, who finding his Sisters Inclinations not much averse to
me, storm'd not a little, and immediately caus'd her to be remov'd into the Country to a solitary Castle of his, and order'd none but Women to be about her: He separated me from her, and dispos'd of me to a Favourite of his, who us'd me with all the severity imaginable, which made me resolve to venture at my Escape, at least into the Neighbouring King∣dom, where, if I gain'd not my Liberty, I was in hopes I should much lighten my Captivity: I furnish'd my self there∣fore with what Weapons I could get, and when I found an Opportunity, I got a small Boat, and put to Sea, which by the Morning drove my Boat upon a Rock, and broke it all to pieces near the shoar, whither with my Arms I swam; and coming to Land, I found my self on a great large Heath or Wilderness, on which I travell'd as Chance directed me, till I began now to be faint for want of Food, and Night apace coming on, but no sight of any house to shelter my self in, till it now being dusky, I spy'd to the East a small Cottage, whither I made with all my Force, lest I should lose it by the hastning darkness: But the speed of the Night was nimbler than mine; however, by the great earnestness, with which I made toward this Cottage, I had imprinted in my mind the place of its scituation so sure, that guided by that, or Chance, or some Diviner Power, I at last came to it, and from one of the Loop-holes spying a small Light, I thought it convenient to peep in first, and see if with safety I might venture in, or whether it were the by-retreat of some Robbers: But the Object that presented it self to my eyes, did not a little sur∣prize me, when I saw my beautiful Princess in danger, and struggling with the mighty Onsets of a bold Ravisher, whilst an old Hagg sat hard by without bringing her any Relief: I staid no longer to consider, but immediately burst into the place with my Weapon in my hand; they expecting no such bold Intrusion, had not fastned the door, and were not a little surpriz'd to find their designs prevented: I gave the Villain no time of Consideration, but stuck him to the heart, and made him fall at the feet of my beloved Terhenahete, with his Life to attone for his sacrilegious intentions. I had no sooner dispatched him, but I found another Enemy call'd in by the old Hagg I mention'd, who made at me with a long Fork
he us'd about his Employments, but leaping on one side, he run it into the Wall with such a force, that it stuck there beyond his power to pull it out if he attempted it; at the same time I wounded him, but not effectually enough to deprive him of doing us any further Mischief; for quickly disengaging himself, he run to the Window, under which lay an Ax, with which he us'd to fell Wood in the Forrest; and at the same time the old limping Hagg had got another small Hatchet, and with it was making toward my adoreable Fair One; here distracted betwixt both, I knew not which to prevent, till soon perceiving the danger nearer her, (the other now begin∣ing to stagger, and come on but slowly with his new acquir'd Weapon) I with all my force struck at her Legs, unwilling to kill a Woman, in any shape; so that I cut off one of her Legs with the vehemence of the Blow, which made her tumble down, cursing both me and the gods too; and I over-reach∣ing my self, with that Ardour (my Foot hitching in the Cloaths of the Villain I had slain) fell down too; before I could get up, the other Rogue was come to me, and lift∣ing up his Axe, with all the force he had, let it fall; but by good luck, I had so much time as to clap my Sword betwixt it and my Body, so obliquely, that it carryed his stroak from me to the old Hagg, and slit her Wind-pipe, piercing part of my shoulder as far as the Bone; before he could recover his blow, I was got upon my knees, and thrust him into the heart, as he was going to lift up his Arms to mend his Errour; but death seiz'd him before he could effect it. Thus having delivered my fair Princess from an odious im∣pending fate, I was going to offer her my farther service to wait on her that night, and from thence conduct her to what place she pleased: But I saw that which did not a little dash my satisfaction for my Victory; for she lay stretcht out upon the floor as if dead: I staid not long contemplating, but with all the hast imaginable ran to her, and catch'd her up into my arms, and with a thousand soft sayings pressed her to my bosom, steal∣ing then one gentle kiss from her dear lips; when at that in∣stant I found she began to revive, I bended her a little forward, and so at last she came perfectly to her self. I question'd her if she had received any hurt during the encounter, that had
caused this Swound I found her in? She answered, not that she knew; but that seeing me down, and the Villains Ax just ready to fall on me, she fainted away, as giving both her self and me too for gone. Having removed her from this place, I took the bodies of the dead, and carryed them out of the house, that so unpleasant a sight should not offend her; which when I had done, I return'd into the Cottage to my Princess; I then be∣gan to find my self something faint, for I had bled all that time; so I begg'd her to lend me something to bind my Wound close, the piece not being cut off from the rest; but she observing me very pale, made me sit down, and with her fair hand bound it up: And I remember I felt some drops fall on my shoulder, as she was doing it, which I perceived were Tears shed from her dear precious Eyes: which I observing, Madam (said I) Let not your being alone with me trouble you, for I have not deliver'd you from these Villains, to offer any injury to you my self: No, the Heavenly powers forbid I should give way to the least dishonourable thought in so sacred a concern as my Love. No Madam, my passion for you is above being brib'd by its Violence, and despair to attempt its satisfaction against your will; I aspire to the Name of your Husband, and not to the Infamy of your Ravisher: which since I find I shall not be so happy as to obtain, I am now in my way from this unlucky Country, to some remote place, where the name of Giolo is more a stranger, there to wear out my Life in mourn∣ful sighs for my unhappy Fate that gave me so much love, and so little power to make it successful. And I will now ask no other favour of you, than what I am sure you may and will grant, and that is, That you permit me to guard you here this Night, and conduct you to your Abode to morrow, where having seen you safe, I'll only beg something that belongs to you, to keep that lit∣tle time that fleeting Life remains, which I am sensible will not be long, since that which should nourish it, is denyed me: And that is, your Smiles. Giolo, (return'd she and sigh'd) I did little think I should ever have been thus much oblig'd to you, or that I should ever have had cause to think I could use you too severely for pretending Love to me; but since the just Gods have so order'd it, that I must owe my Life, and what is dearer to me, my Honour, to you, let me intreat you not to desert this Country for my sake; for tho'
I must own, that I have hitherto had a great aversion to any thoughts of Love, yet rather than be guilty of so great an Ingratitude, as to make him a wandring unhappy wretch, that has serv'd me with this hazard of his Life, I will promise you thus much, that I will no more fly you, but give you all the Opportunity to win my heart that you can desire; for I confess you deserve it, though I cannot yet prevail with my self to give it you; and if I can at all pre∣vail with you, let me conjure you not to leave Tominec without me. I would contribute to your Liberty, but I think the safest way is to follow my Advice: I have an Vnckle retir'd from Court, that loves me well, and much resented your hard usage, thi∣ther we will go, and there provide for our further Escape, whose abode is something more secure than that where I have been sent by my Brother; for the Opportunity of this neighbouring Desart to that, gave rise to theun happy Adventures of yesterday; for on the farther end of this Forrest, near ten miles, as well as I can guess, from hence, is the Castle whither my Brother sent me from your Addresses. You may better imagine, than I declare in Words, the tran∣sports that seiz'd me, at these unexpected Words of Comfort, which rais'd me from the depth of despair, to the height of cer∣tain happiness, and made me for the present lose all thoughts of a farther Escape: 'Twould be too much to tell you all the passionate Vows and Protestations I made to her that Night, which as long as she was able to watch, was spent in Addresses of that nature, without giving my self leisure to ask her what brought her into these unlucky Circumstances I found her in: At last, overcome with sleep, I saw her shut her eyes, and so I drew nearer, and plac'd my self close to her, and gently laid her head into my lap, and soon after fell my self into a slum∣ber, in which I had this pleasant dream: Methought the King of Tominec, and my Sister, consented to our Marriage; which done, they withdrew and left me alone with her, and methought with a modest down look, she press'd my hand, and said, In∣deed, my dear Giolo, I never intended it should come to this; with that, impatient for my coming Bliss, I grasp'd her in my long∣ing Arms, when she with equal Ardour sir'd, clasp'd me so close, methought I wanted breath: And so I wak'd, and found my dream thus far certify'd, That I had my Arms about her,
and she hers about me: I would not wake her from that en∣dearing Posture, and yet I would fain have had the content to have her find her self so: I had not long enjoy'd my self thus, but some body fell a rapping at the door, as if they would have beat it down, which made her start out from her loving posture, and soon wake; I jump'd up, and caught hold of my sword, fearing some more of the Gang was coming in upon me; but by good luck, we had so fallen'd the door, that no body could get in to us. I therefore demanded who was there, when one answered, that he was a poor Traveller that had lost his way in the Forrest, and had wandered about it all the Night till then, and desir'd that he might only come in to rest his wearyed Limbs. The Princess hearing his Voice, knew him to be one of her Servants that were lately restor'd her, and therefore desired me to let him in, which in obedi∣ence to her Commands, I did: But when the poor slave came in, and saw his Mistriss there, and with me, he could not tell what to say or do; but she inform'd him, that by my help she was alive, which satisfying him, he fell at her feet for joy to see her safe, and could not be got away from that humble posture, thanking the Gods and me, for her delivery, till day now began to peep, and she unwilling to stay any lon∣ger in that dismal place, we set forward: On the Way she ask'd him how he came thither at that time of night: he in∣form'd her, that after she went out the day before, and that her Maids had escap'd home to tell the Servants of what had befel her, several of them came out in pursuit of the bold Ravisher, but as they were searching about, they saw him float∣ing on the River, and making to Land as fast as he could, be∣ing almost spent; that they, not out of any Love to him, but only to know what was become of their Lady, dragg'd him a∣shore, and upon Examination, had learn'd the truth of the Transaction betwixt them; and then flung him as far as they could into the River again, and saw the stream bear him away out of their sight; so they dispersed themselves several ways in the search of her, appointing to meet all at her Ca∣stle again, and that he wandring till night about the Forrest, unwilling to go out on't till he had found her, was benighted, and so at last happened accidentally to light upon that Hut,
where he so happy to find her: In this, and some other dis∣course, we arriv'd in sight of her Unckles, and when we were come within a quarter of mile, we sent the Slave before to inform her Unckle privately of our coming: And being come to the House, the Old Prince was amaz'd to see me lead in my Princess, of whose Escape he had already heard; and re∣ceiv'd me with that respect that was due to my quality, as the Son of a King, not a Slave: As soon as we were enter'd, he had not patience to stay till we had repos'd our selves, but im∣mediately enquir'd into our Adventure. As far as I knew of it, I told him; but desir'd, before he put the Lady to the Trou∣ble, that she might be conducted to a Chamber, and there a little refresh'd, having had but a very bad Nights Lodging last Night; which being accordingly done, and the Prince ad∣mitting me with himself, she thus began: Yesterday morning (being a very inviting day) I took a walk with two of my Maids, into the Grove which you know is adjoyning to my Castle, designing not to spend above a quarter of an hour there; when we had reached the lower end of the walk, which is but short, there rusht a fellow out upon us; the Maids frighted, ran one, one way into the Wood; and the other, another: the Villain made im∣mediately to me, and seized me before I could make many steps away from him. Looking upon him, I found it was young Teyas, Prince of Tabuco, that had formerly made Love to me; but being denyed, and forbid our Kingdom, now hearing I had retreated to that lone abode, so near the frontiers, secure of a safe retreat, watched there∣about for this opportunity, which I suspect was given him by one of my Maids, that put me mind of taking that Walk. He had no sooner seized me, but he forced me away from my Castle towards the Forrest, and putting a Dagger to my Bosom, swore by all the Gods, that he would before we parted, Murder me, or Enjoy me. Surpriz'd at so sudden an accident, and the impending danger, I was at a stand to think how to escape both of these Evils; the least of them [Death] being terrible enough to a Woman, at last remem∣bring, that a little further there was a narrow Bridge that crossed a very rappid Stream; and therefore he having dragg'd me so far, I told him, if he would not be so rude, I did not know what I might conclude in his favour; that gifts of that nature were better bestow'd on Kind words, than Threats, and fear of Death; that I could go
more peaceably with him, if he would go my pace. With words tem∣pered like these, I got liberty to go leisurely along, till we came to that Bridge. I desired him to lead me over it, which he very readi∣ly did; but he was no sooner upon it, but I gave him a little twirle (the wood being slippery with some rain that had fallen in the night) and his feet slipt; and endeavouring to save himself, he plunged farther into the River; but I staid not to see what became of him, but took to my heels, and ran as fast as I could towards my Castle. I had not run a furlong, but I found my self very weary; and fear∣ing he might get out (the River being but narrow, tho swift) I begg'd a Country fellow that at that distance came by, to take me up behind him; instead of going thither, he gallopped away with me into the Forrest, to that little Hutt where you Giolo found me; all I could do, could not get away from him he held me so fast: But being come to this little Cottage in the midst of the Forrest, he took me off, and the old Hagg came out to him with her Rogue, and forced me in; when I was there, it being day-time, they carryed me into a little Hole within their Room, and having gagg'd me, they made me remain till night; when that was come, and there was now no more fear of Travellers to interrupt them in their design, they took out the Gagg and treated me a little more civilly, and the deformed Monster that brought me there, took me by the hand, and told the old Witch I was his Wife, and that he must bed me there that night, having newly Marryed me; which she seem'd to believe, and therefore wish't him Joy: I did what I could to undeceive her, asking her if it were a likely matter that I should marry such a Beast as he; Yes marry Mrs. Flirt, said she, why not? Why not so proper and well-built a Man as he? I told her who I was, and promised her I would give her a better House, and a good Reward too, if she would deliver me from the Clutches of that Villain; but all was in vain, they either would not trust to my promises, or believed his, who assured them of great mat∣ters, swearing all the while he was Married to me, and that they should see him injoy me before their Faces, and presently began to be very rude with me, endeavouring to gain a Kiss from me; but I struggling so strongly, it was more than he could effect at the first On-set; but fearing to be overcome by his robustuous strength▪ I began to, speak him fair, and argue the ease with him and them, sometimes assuring them I was not his Wife, other times begging him
to defer his cruelty, if he would not wholly give it over. In the midst of my entreaties which would do no good, he endeavoured again to ravish a kiss from me, and I had quite spent my self with strug∣gling when you burst in upon us, and by his death delivered me from him. I suppose his design was to have ravished and murde∣red me, else to have sold me for a Slave, when he had obtained his desire, if he had not been prevented by you. The rest you have heard (concluded she) from the mouth of the Prince Giolo. I was extreamly pleased to find her give me the Title due to my Birth and Quality, since that shewed she enter∣tained some esteem for me. Now it being high time to leave her to her repose, we retired. The next day ha∣ving free access to her, I pressed my cause to her with all the Ardour I could. Nor did she deny, but that gratitude obliged her to yield to my desires, but only fear of my safety, made her oppose my eagerness; she therefore only asked time to bring my content about, without hazarding her self or me any farther. She informed me that she was of opinion, that the Prince her Uncle was too much disgusted by her Brother; that he would contribute all he could to the furthering of my escape, and that he would perhaps be brought to go with me, for he was very much my Friend, as indeed I soon found. For one day taking me aside, he said, Prince Giolo, I am not ignorant of your former pretentions to my Neice, who I believe is not wholly averse to you. I know also upon this account she was sent away from Court to the remotest part of this Kingdom, to prevent your coming near her, but your escape before this time is known all over Tominec, which will I suppose make the King send for her back: Nor will it be safe for you to remain here, for tho' I believe you are not known personally to any one of my Slaves, yet those that belong to the Princess are well enough acquainted with you, and may for all't we know make their escape to the City, and inform against you. I would therefore have you think of perfecting your delivery, and out of hand endea∣vour to make away to your own Country, from whence you may demand the Princess in Marriage, or revenge your in∣juries received here: I promise you the assistance of a Ves∣sel to convey you home:
Ah Sir, returned I, I cannot go and leave my Princess be∣hind, and if she will be obstinate, and still resist my passion, I must stay and perish; for till she is mine, I am resolved not to go from this Country what danger soever attends me. You may, return'd the Prince, tempt your fate too far, and lose this happy minute it has allowed you to gain your liberty. But since you are resolved not to go without her, I will still contribute to your happiness, and since by so doing, I shall incur the greatest danger my self; I will al∣so accompany you in your slight, for the cruelty of the King has made me abhor the sight of him. Go you therefore, and see what you can prevail with the Princess to do, and I will second your endeavours. I returned him a thousand acknowledgments for the unexpected civility, in a place where I had met with the greatest Barbarity in the World; and according to his directions, I went to the Princesses Ap∣partment; and being admitted, I after some other precious discourse, said to her: I bless my good fortune, that has thus after so many sighs, and tedious days, and anxious nights, brought me into your presence once more, and I thank your condescending goodness, that has so far forgiven the boldness of my Tongue, in repeating the tale of my Love as often as I see you; but so it is, that I cannot but trans∣gress the same way again, and once more lay open to your gene∣rous Compassion, the truest, and most violent flame, that ever reigned in a poor Lovers breast. I confess, I cannot plead any other Merit, than the reality of my Love, especially in the cir∣cumstances I am in at present; nor do I desire to gain you on any other account; all my actions proceeding from that alone, as a due Homage to her that commands my Soul: That, that alone is my all, and my only hopes, for in that I excel all Mankind. There may be greater Princes, and there are more Fortunate that make their Addresses to you, but there can't be a greater Lover; for should I find an absolute and fatal repulse, Death would soon put a Period to my Misery, and rob your generosity of my relief. Speak, thou Fairest, speak, and let me here know my Doom, from those dear Lips, which sure are more in love with Mercy, than to utter any destroying Sentence. Speak, that I may no longer dubt or hope, but end the tortures of a Wretch, whom only fan∣cied
and imaginary bliss have thus long kept alive; Methinks those lovely eyes against your will, confess approaching pitty. I would have gon on, but that the Princess (whose Love now could be no longer disguised) thus interrupted me, more out of custom, than doubt of the reality of my Affections. Ah! Giolo, said she, why should you strive to gain a heart, which I fear you value chiefly for the benefit it may bring you, in restoring you to the Favour of my Brother, and your own Kingdom. But Oh! If that be all your aim, and that you make my heart but the medium of your fortune, let me tell you, it is too Noble a Prize, and cannot brook after slightings, no more than hear such Words, and so much seeming Truth, without com∣passion. I have given you the freedom to pursue my heart; but do it fairly, and with a just regard, or as you love your own repose and mine, press on my fall no farther. Ah, Sweet Princess! returned I, (and sent out a sigh, as if my Soul would have parted from my Body) You wrong my honest Soul: By those bright Eyes you do, to think me guilty of such slavish double-dealing Arts. My Fortune has not changed my mind. That still is free, and think, what a Prince should. I have no respect to any by advantage that your Love may bring. No, by all the Sacred Powers above, mine is a Noble Flame un∣mingled with Self-interest. If my Words will not convince you of the truth of this, my Death shall— As I was going to proceed, I was interrupted by the en∣trance of the Prince, who had over-heard all that had now past betwixt us, and observing that all this contest proceed∣ed from her unwillingness to own her Love, stopt me in the carrier of my Passion; and with all the grave Authority of his Person and Speech, assured her, that what I said, he durst be pledge, I meant: and that therefore she might be∣lieve me without so much unnecessary caution; and by con∣sequence, as Generosity, Gratitude and Justice required, put an end to my sufferings, by complying with my desires, since without a favourable Answer he would certainly die, which would bring too great a scandal on their Country, to have the Cruelty of the Women, perfect the Misery, the Barba∣rity that the Men had began—No, let him live (said she, and stopt as ashamed of what she had said, and directing
the discourse to the Old Prince, she thus replied) But why Sir do you thus force me to discover my own weakness, and con∣fessing Love after so many resolutions I have made to the con∣trary? You who ought to have propt my sinking Virtue: Could it not suffice to have gathered it from my treacherous Eyes, but that he must hear it too from my Tongue?—Blush not (re∣turned the Prince) for why should you be ashamed to own a Pas∣sion for the Son of a Greater King than your own Father! There∣fore let me give you immediately to him (for that is the Custom of that Country). Here, take from me this hand, Giolo, (said he to me) if I thought thee not Honourable and Brave, I would not bestow this gift on thee else. And Terhenahete, I dare engage to you, you'll not repent your choice. With these words, he seized her hand, and gave it to me; who parting as it were out of a Trance into which these unexpected Joys had cast me, I eagerly caught hold on't, and after ten thousand kis∣ses which I gave it, I thus cryed out; Thanks Noble Prince, all your Gods has not such another Gift to bestow.—Ah dea∣rest Princess! if you would but confirm, I were entirely blest. Well, I must yield (said she, and blushed) but use your con∣quest with moderation, and shew by your after-Love, that what you have said, is true. My Vncle has too much Authority over me, for me to dislike his Choice. Thanks my Dear Princess (returned I with all the eagerness of Love and Success): And thanks ye Heavenly Powers; Thanks to you Renowned Prince; And by my Charming Fair, I here, if fate so prosper us to carry us safe into Gilolo, I'll ever honour you as my Father: Nay what's more, as the Father of my Terhenahete. After this, we passed that Night in all the Joyes of Love, and I forgot that I was in an Enemies Country, where I was in danger of being discovered to Death, or perpetual Slave∣ry. In the mean time the Prince, by some he could confide in, had ordered a Vessel to be got ready; but all these Af∣fairs could not be carried on with that secrecy, but some of the Slaves had knowledge of it, which was confirmed, when the next day but one, Two of them were missing. The Prince came to us with surprize, and informed us of the whole matter; on which we resolved to go upon our intended Voyage immediately; for tho' he had not laid in those Pro∣visions
he intended, nor got that strength of Men he hoped by his Agents to have procured in a few days, yet we thought it safer to venture away without them, than expect a cer∣tain ruine there, by a farther delay; but it was now too late to think of going that Night, nor did we think we should have any come to prevent our escape so soon as the next day. But the Slaves wied with hopes of reward for their disco∣very, had made such had that by that time the Morning came,  came for the Princess immediately to re∣pair to the Court, and the Prince to yield himself a Priso∣ner: And for me, to bind me; if▪ resisted, to kill me. But with this Messenger (who was not able to do all himself) were sent about thirty more; but he had out-gon them all, which made us bind him first, and immediately make hast to our Ship, into which we had scarce got, when we saw them that were in pursuit of us come to the shoar; we hoist our Sailes, and got clear of all the Ships there, so out to Sea, and had it not been for the Treachery or Ignorance of the Seamen, had been by the next Morning, safe out of danger. We got out of sight by Noon, so fare a Wind we had; and then I began to think again of Love, and would not lose any hours I could spend in the injoyment of my dea∣rest Princess; little thinking how little a time I was to be so happy: For resolving to sail all Night for the greater speed; the Pilot, or by chance, or design, steer'd back di∣rectly to the place from whence we came; so that when we waked in the Morning, we were surprized to behold the Land and Place from whence we came. The Old Prince suspecting Treason, immediately slew the Pilot, and had him hoisted over board; and tacked about again, but to no purpose; nor Wind nor Tide assisted us; and to add to our Affliction we saw two of the biggest Ships make to us; but resolving not to be taken lamely, we made resistance, till the Poor Old Prince was slain, and I extremely wounded; upon which we were both carried ashore, and the Princess ravished from my Arms, with scarce leisure to wish me well, or give a part∣ing look; and I was by another party carried away to Buta, and sold there to a Forreign Merchant, I know not of what place; with whom I was  to another Country I was
ignorant of, and by my New Master sold, I suppose to those that brought me hither. Having thus repeated my Misfortunes to you Sir, I hope you will be so just to your word, as to make enquiry, what became of my Princess? Whether she out-lived it? Or has at last forgot her Giolo? The Dutch Merchant was now quite tired with the Nar∣rative, and could not be prevailed with to give an account of it to the Company, but told my Friend, that if he would go with him to his Lodgings, he would over a Bowl of Punch, by parcels, give him the whole Narrative, which he did, unwilling to lose any part of so admirable a Story of so Unfortunate as Prince. As to the particular description of his Body, the Pictures that are Published of him, give a large account of that: But to compleat the History of his Life, I will add something of that nature. This Prince is about the Age of Thirty, Grace∣ful and well proportioned in all his Limbs, extreamly Modest and Civil; and, as this account shews, of a very good Sense. He is all over curiously Painted both before and behind, a par∣ticular demonstration of his Quality. Those Nations who use that Art, never permitting the inferior sort to see any regular forms in their Bodies. FINIS.
