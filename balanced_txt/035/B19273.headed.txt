depiction of a crown CHARLES REX. HIS MAJESTYES Declaration, to all HIS loving Subjects of His KINGDOM of England and Dominion of Wales. WEE Shall not rype vp the CAUSES of the vnhappy Differences, betwixt OUR ROYALL Father, and the Two Houses of PARLIAMENT; IT shall be our Study, that they be for ever buried: AND that our Subjects of ENGLAND may returne to the Obedience they owe Us, as their lawfull KING: And to the Ancient and happy Governement of the Kingdom, by King, Lords, & Commons (Wherein they and their Ancestors have lived so long so happily) Without the Effusion of more Blood. WITH these Thoughts wee are now returning vnto our Kingdom of ENGLAND, with an Army by the blessing of GOD, able to protect our Loyall Subjects, who shall joyne with vs and assist vs in doing Iustice vpon Murtherers of our Royall Father: And to defend vs from the Violence of such as will continue the exclusion of Us from Our just RIGHTS, the subversion of the lawfull Governement of the Kingdom, and the oppression of our good Subjects by Armies & exorbitant impositions. And before wee enter the Kingdom; Wee have thought fitt by this short DECLARATION to let our good Subjects there know, that our desyres are not more to be restored to our own Rights, than to procure and mantayn to them their Fredom; And as wee have given full and inteere Satisfaction to Our subjects of SCOTLAND, both in what might concerne Religion, and their Lawes, and Libertyes (Which GOD willing wee shall inviolably preserve to them) So it shall be our Study, and would bee our greatest joy, that wee might attayne the same happieness in ENGLAND: And because wee do think our selves bound in Duety to look more at the Glory of GOD, than Our own interest. VVee do in the First Place Declare; That wee shall faythfullie endeavour in Our STATION and CALLING, as Wee are bound by the CO∣VENANT, to setle Religion in Doctrine, Worship, Disciplene, and Governement; according to the WORD of GOD, and example of the best Reformed Churches. VVee shall also endeavour; That Parliaments may bee restored to their Freedome, and Priviledges, by whose advyse We do declare Our Resolutions are to governe, and to setle all Differences and distempers; That our people may enjoy their Libertie, and Propertie free from Armyes, Quarterings, or illegall impositions. These being our cleare Intentions and Resolutions; Wee do exspect and invite all our good subjects of ENGLAND, to concurre with, and asist vs according to their Duety & alleadgence; and such as are in Arms eyther in SCOTLAND or ENGLAND, vnder Oliver Cromwell present∣lie after knowledge heereof, to lay them down, or to come in, and joyne with vs in our Army, where they shall receive protection and full assurance of Satisfaction in their Arreires. AND to evidence how farr we are from Revenge, or continueing the vnhappy Differences betwixt vs and our subjects; Wee do declare and engage our Selves to give our consent to a full Act of Oblivion, and indemnity for the Securitie of all our Subjects of ENGLAND in their persons, fredomes, and estates for all things don by them: relateing to the Warres, these eleaveenth years past: And that they shall never bee called in question by vs for any of them; Provyding that immediatly after knowledge of this gracious Offer and DECLARATION, they desist from assisting the vsurped Authoritie of the pretended Common-wealth of ENGLAND, and returne to their Obedience to Us, excepting only from this Our gracious offer; Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton, Iohn Breadshaw, Iohn Cooke, their pretended solicitor, and all others who did actuallie sitt & vote in the Murther, of Our Royall Father. AND seing in this Service; Wee have made vse of the affection, and assistance of our Loyall Subjects of our Kingdome of SCOTLAND, who cannot possiblie mantayn their whole Army in ENGLAND; Wee do requyre some of quality or authoritie in each Countie where wee shall march to come to Us, that necessary provisions may be regularlie brought in to the Army. And wee do declare that the Counties, from whom such shall come, shall receive no other prejudice, except such of them as shall oppose vs, or drive away their cattell or provisions from vs. And because it shall be our mayne endeavour that our subjects of ENGLAND may bee safe in their persons, free in their goods, and as little burthened as is possible: As we are resolved to permitt no plundering or raping, or taking any mans person (who is not in actuall opposition of Us:) Which wee shall not with all severi∣tie punish: So if our army shall bee forced to be more burdensome to some places and persons, than to others; It shall be our endeavour that as soone as is possible they may receive proportionable satisfaction, and the Burthen be made equall. AND lastly; Wee do declare, that the service being done: The SCOTS Army shall quietly retiere; That so all Armyes may bee disbanded And an lasting peace setled with Religion and Righteousnes. GIVEN at Our Royall Campe, at Woodhouss the 5 of August 1651. ABERDENE Printed by James Brown, the 20 of August 1651.
