A Special VVarrant Given forth (from the SPIRIT of GOD (Who is Lord over all Lords, and King above all Kings) against the Spirit of Envy and Persecution, who hath been, is, and will be the Greatest Enemy to God and Godliness, and to all People. ALSO, Some Descriptions set down how this unsufferable Enemy (the Spirit of Persecution) may be known, and what he is, and from whence he came, and where he lodgeth in the Night, and what Weapons people may be armed with a∣gainst him when they go to take him, that he may not hurt them, that so they may bring him to Judgment, and Sen∣tence may be past upon him. Sathan shall go forth to deceive the Nations, and Gog and Ma∣gog shall appeare together, for the stirring up of an Army to Battel against the Saints, the Number of whom is as the Sand of the Sea; and they went upon the breadth of the Earth, and compassed the Camp of the Saints about, and the Beloved City, and fire came down from God out of Heaven and de∣voured them, as in Rev. 20. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall o∣vercome them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,  Rev. 17. 14. Written by Joseph Fuce. LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1663,
A Special VVarrant Given forth from the Spirit of God. A Special Warrant given forth from the Spi∣rit of God (who is Lord over all Lords, and King above all Kings) against the Spi∣rit of Envy and Persecution, which hath, is, and will be the Greatest Enemy a∣gainst God and Godlinesse, to Kings and Kingdomes, Nobles and Nobility, Neighbours and Neighbourhood; and therefore would the God of the Spirits of all flesh have both Kings and Nobles, and all other People, in all parts of his Creation, and that more especially in those Parts where Kings, and Nobles, and People of all sorts professe to owne God, and his Christ, to be awakened, and moved to stirre and stand up, and to set unto their helping hand, and to lend their best as∣sistance for the stopping, apprehending, and taking this Great and Notorious Enemy to God and all Mankind, from the very Highest to the Lowest of all in the Cre∣ation, and to True Religion it selfe: With some De∣scriptions what this Insufferable Enemy is, and from whence he came, and where he Lodgeth in the Night, and how he may be knowne and taken, and what Peo∣ple of all sorts are to be Armed with against this Thief that cometh in the Night, so that they may not be hurt by him, nor hurt one another about taking him,
and bringing him to Judgement and Condemnation; for they that profest themselves to be Religious people that have gone forth heretosore, and have not beene Ar∣med with the True Armour, nor led by the True Leader, they have Struck at this Enemy and missed him, and Wounded and Killed one another, and Taken and Imprisoned one another, and let him goe at Liberty in every Nation and Country, City and Towne like a roar∣ing Lyon to devoure, to the great Griefe of the Spi∣rit of God, who created: Mankind, and would have them all to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth, as the Scripture saith; and then how peaceable people of all sorts may live, and how in Life and Spirit they may Serve and Worship their Creator, and in Love serve and doe one for another as Brethren and Friends and Neighbours, and so every one may come to sit downe under his owne Vine, and none shall make him afraid. First, What this Great Enemy unto God and Godlinesse, and all Mankind is, against whom this Special Warrant from the Spirit of God goes sorth? This Great Enemy to all Mankind is that Old Envi∣ous Spirit of Persecution that got into Cain, and mov∣ed and stirred him up against his Righteous Brother A∣bels, (Gen. 4, 5, 8.) So he made Cain his Servant to Murther or Kill his Righteous Brother Abel, and brought misery and sorrow and Everlasting Torment upon him∣selfe, who then became a Vagabond from God to wan∣der with a Burthen too heavy for him to beare; and al∣though he built a City to make himselfe an Habitation, yet his Punishment: was Greater than he could beare, because he had done the Murthering Spirits Worke (in Slaying his Brother) and so became worthy of Everla∣sting Punishment, like unto him that was a Murtherer from the Beginning: And the same Envious, Persecu∣ting and Murthering Spirit was in Pharaoh, who burdened and grievously Oppressed and Afflicted the Lords Peo∣ple
for a long time, (Exod. 3. 7.) which grieved the Lords Spirit, who heard the Groanings of his People in Egypt, (Exod. 5, to the 14.) And this Envious Spirit made Pharaoh the King do so Wickedly against the minde of God as to provoke the Holy One of Israel to bring the Plagues on the Kings owne selfe, and the whole Land of Egypt; and yet this Great Enemy to the King and King∣dome would not let the King be quiet, but made him to oppresse them more than before, and at last to pursue the Lords People with a Great Army of Horse-men and Char∣riots, intending to Destroy those whom the Lord had Chosen to himselfe to be his People; and by so doing the King brought everlasting destruction upon himselfe and all his Host, who were destroyed by water in the Red Sea; and that was the worke of the Envious Spirit to bring to everlasting destruction. And the same Ene∣my was in Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazar, and in the Pre∣sidents and Princes, and in Haman, and in all the rest of the envious Enemies of God and his People in those Generations. (Esther 7.) And oh how did that great Enemy, the Spirit of Persecution, betray Haman even to the Gallows to be Hanged for devising mischief against poore Mordecai, and all the Jewes, which were the Lords People? And also how was the great King Ne∣buchadnezzar deceived by the same Deceitful Spirit of Envy and Persecution, that stirred him up to Persecute the Lords Holy Children, and to exalt himselfe in the Pride of his heart, until his Kingdome was taken, and he drove our from amongst men to eat Grasse like an Oxe, and his Body to be wet with the Dew, until his Haires were growne like Eagles Feathers, and his Nailes like Birdes Clawes, (Dan. 4. 33.) And he humbled himselfe, and looked up to Heaven, and his Understand∣ing returned to him, (Dan. 5.) by which he spake, to the great Praise of God and his Kingdome, and Wayes, and Judgements; and he confest, that they that walk in Pride, he is able to abase, and he knew it was the Most
High that Ruled in the Kingdome of Men, and that he appointeth over it whosoever he will. And then after Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazar was King, and Reigned, (Dan. 5.) and he made a great Feast to a thousand of his Lords, and drunk Wine before them, and then he sent for the Vessels, that his Father had taken out of the Temple at Jerusalem, and he, and his Wives, and Nobles drank wine in them; and in the same Houre came forth Fingers of a Mans Hand, and wrote upon the Wall of the Kings Palace (for a signe against the King,), and the King saw the part of the Hand that Wrote, and his Countenance was then chang∣ed, and his Thoughts troubled him, so that he cryed to bring in the Astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the Southsayers, which were the Wise Men of Babylon, to see if they could read the Writing, and tell the King the Interpretation thereof, which none of them could doe; then the King and his Nobles were sore troubled and astonished: and in that time of trouble the Queen remembred Daniel the Lords Servant, in whom was sound the Spirit of Light and Wisdome, who read the Writing, and told the King the Interpretation, which was, that God had numbred thy Kingdome, and finish∣ed it, and he told him, Thou art Weighed in the Bal∣lance, and art found wanting, and thy Kingdome is divi∣ded, and given to the Medes and Persians. And the King advanced and honoured Daniel to be the Ruler in the Kingdome, although that Night Belshazar was slain, and his Kingdome tooke from him by Darius; and then it pleased Darius to set over the Kingdome an Hundred and Twenty Princes, (Dan. 6. to the end,) that should be over the whole Kingdome, and over three Presi∣dents, of whom this Daniel was first, and he was a∣bove the other, and they were to give accounts unto him, and then the King should have no Damage, be∣cause there was an excellent Spirit in Daniel; and there∣fore the King thought to set him over the whole Realme,
and so both the King and Princes, and all, were like to doe well, and be in peace, because of that excellent Spirit in Daniel, who would let the King have no Dam∣age; for the Damage, dishonour, confusion; overthrow, and utter destruction came upon the Kings and their King∣domes, by reason of their following the Proud, Envious, Darkning Spirit of Errour, that was known by his Per∣secution and Enmity; but when the Excellent Spirit of Light and Wisdome, that was found in Daniel the Lords servant, was hearkned unto, then the King was lyable to have no Damage, although Daniels way of Worshipping of God was altogether contrary both to King and Prin∣ces, yet all was well towards the King and Kingdome and Princes and Presidents, because of that Excellent Spirits leading Daniel. But then the Old Serpent, which is the Devil, the King of Pride, and the greatest be∣trayer of mans Soul and Body, which is and ever was the chiefe in doing mischiefe, the Persecutor and Mur∣therer of Gods People, I say, this subtle Serpent see∣ing the Spirit of God and of Wisdome (that was found in Daniel) bearing Rule so in the King, and over the Princes, that there was like to be no Damage to the King, nor Daniel, nor Princes, nor Presidents, so that all was well and in Peace, and his Kingdome of Enmi∣ty, Pride and Darknesse lay wast, then marke, how sub∣tilly he gets in amongst the Princes, and begets them into Pride and Discontent, because of Daniel's being set above them, for that Excellent Spirits sake that no evil might besall the King or Kingdome; and when this proud Envious Spirit was got up, in and among the Princes and Presidents, he exalted them into Pride and Discon∣tentednesse with their places, and then they began to watch for evill against honest harmlesse Daniel the Lords Servant, and knowing they could find nothing against him, except it were concerning the Worship and Service of his God, which was differing from all their Wor∣ship and Services; yet all was well, and no Damage
was against the King or Princes by Faithful-Daniels Worshipping and Serving his God, though differing from them all, because of that Excellent Spirit of Light and Wisdome that was found in Daniel: And then this Serpent led the Presidents and Princes subtilly to goe to the King, and to stir up the King to make a Law and Decree for Conformity, to make all Bow and Con∣forme to their way of Worship, or to be cast into the Lyons Den, intending this mischiefe against poore Da∣niel, because he was confirmed and stedfast in the Wor∣ship and Service of his God, and also Faithful to man in what he could doe for Conscience sake, or in what∣ever he undertooke whomsoever bare Rule, because there was in him an Excellent Spirit; and the King Darius being innocent of their intent, and not foreseeing their Plot they laid against Daniel, in stirring him up and pressing him to make a Law, or Seale a Decree about Service and Worship, that none might ask a Petition of any, God or Man, for thirty Dayes, save thee O King, so for all to Consorme at such a time, or to be cast into the Lyons Den: And this Wicked Cunning Ser∣pent he stirred up the Princes, and Presidents, and Go∣vernours, &c. of the Kingdome, to Assemble together and vehemently to urge the King to Signe their mis∣chievous Decree, that it might be unalterable; and when he had perswaded the King, and he had Sealed the Sta∣tute or Decree, then they Assembled themselves and tooke Daniel Praying before his God, as he did afore∣time, then they came neere and spake before the King of his Decree, and of Daniel, who could not for Con∣science sake leave the Worship and Service of his God, although the Decree was Sealed against him; but when the King did see, how it reflected upon his True and Faithfull Subject Daniel, he was sore displeased with himselfe, and set his heart on Daniel to Deliver him, and he laboured till the going downe of the Sun to De∣liver him; and then those men pressed upon the King
to have the Decree executed upon Daniel, who was brought according to the Decree, that was contrived in the Envy of their hearts, and cast into the Den of Lyons, and the King Believed, and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, will Deliver thee; then the King went to his Palace, and passed the Night past∣ing, neither were Instruments of Musick brought before him, and his Sleep went from him: But oh how glad was he in the Morning, when he saw how that Daniel was saved by his God, and that because of his Faithful∣nesse and Innocency that was found before the Lord, and who had wronged no man; and then the King in the exceeding Joy and Gladnesse of his Heart, caus∣ed Daniel to be taken up out of the Den; when they had ta∣ken him up, no manner of hurt was sound about him, because he believed in his God; and the King commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them, and their wives and children into the Lyons Den, and they were destroyed; And thus were they blinded by the spirit of darkness and envy, and betrayed even unto death, and that was the fruit and work of the envious spirit of persecuti∣on, to stir up to destroy the most honest and upright in the sight of God and man, from off the earth, or else, to stir up, and lead such destroyers to be destroyed, and that more espe∣cially, about and concerning Religion and Worship; and if I were led to speak of what I see of this soul-betraying spirit of envy and persecution, and of his fruit, surely it would sill a larg volume, but the Spirit of the Lord (who hath made men wise in this Generation) leads me briefly to hint of some of the fruits of the old spirit of persecution, in this special War∣rant to all sorts of people in Christendom, so called, who up∣on consideration with the Light of Christ in their Consciences, may see those things to be true, & that so much the more plain∣ly, because the Lord in the largness of his love hath spoken so plainly, and called unto man so often in this age by his Spirit, through many of his chosen vessels, who have suffered deeply by all the Powers that have born rule, ever since we depar∣ted from evil, and by the voyce of the spirit (through the
Lords chosen vessels) have many minds been turned from darkness to light in their own Consciences, which hath made this Generation wiser than many Generations heretofore in the Apostacy; besides the great and marvelous works that God hath brought to pass in the sight of this Generation of men, in overturning, and changing, and converting thousands from darkness to light, and from evil to good, and from envy to true love; besides the overturning of Governours and Governments and Armies, and that at the last, without fighting or shedding of blood, which is enough to awaken this Generation, into a consideration of things past, present, and to come. And thus did the old Serpent work before the days of Christ's coming in the flesh, to end the Jews worship in out-side things, and their Law, and to set up the everlasting worship of God in the Spirit. And now take notice, how the old Dragon got in among the Jews, who had Moses and the Prophets writings, who had been great sufferers, and who had known by writings how their fore-fathers were scattered, and led into Babilon, after God by a mighty hand had brought them through the Red Sea and Wilderness; and these professing Jews said, if they had been in the days of their fathers, they would not have persecuted the Prophets; but while they were in their Zeal, worshipping in outward things, the envious spirit of persecu∣tion got into them, and blinded their minds, and hardned their hearts; and in those days, this spirit of envy and murther and persecution, began to work in Herod against Christ, for he sent forth, and slew all the male children in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, thinking to destroy Christ, (Acts 13.) And after John was beheaded: And see what the spirit brought Herod to at the last, he was eaten with Worms: And because the Envious▪ Jews did not look for the Messiah or Christ to come in so low a degree, as to be born in Bethlehem, and laid in a Manger, they knew him not: And although their fore∣fathers had suffered persecution and great affliction, and they had said they would not have persecuted the Prophets, whose words they had, which prophesied of Christ, who wrought wonders and miracles among them, yet they Crucified the
Prince of life; and these were they that worshipped in Tem∣ples and Synagogues together with their Priests and Rulers, that were stirred up by this persecuting spirit, mostly through the Chief Priests, against Christ and his Disciples, who went up and down preaching the truth, and doing good, and wrong∣ing no man; yet they cryed vehemently, Let him be Crucified: And as they Crucified Christ, so they persecuted his Disci∣ples, and put many of them to death, and provoked the Lord against them, until he gave them up to be scattered, and to be a hissing to all the Nations, as the natural seed of those Jews are at this day, so were they blinded and hardned, and then be∣trayed to utter ruine, as the persecutors had been before by the old Serpent, the spirit of envy and persecution; and then when he had done his worst against Christ and Christians, in and through the Heathen, Jews, Rulers, Priests and people of all sorts, then he got in amongst them that were called Chri∣stians, that did not watch in the Light, and low meekness of spirit, which were such as had the Sheeps cloathing, but in∣wardly were ravening Wolves, the ravening, wolvish, doggish, envious spirit of persecution made them so, and such in that nature had a form of godliness, but denyed the power there∣of, and from such the true Christians were to turn away, who were in the meek Spirit, and harmlesse innocent nature of Christ, that kept them always ready to do good, and to receive wrong, rather than to do any wrong, to Jew, or Gentile, or the false Brethren, that were false like the Jews; and then this envious persecuting spirit led the deceivers that came to the Saints in Sheeps cloathing, but inwardly were ravening Wolvs, out into the world, and they that were of the world went after them into a profession of Christ, and yet of the worlds nature, and they got a form of godliness, but denyed the power there∣of, and from such the Saints were to turn away, and so there was a difference in the nature of them that professed Christ, for some were of the Lambs nature, and others of the worlds nature, yet all professed God and Christ, and from that, they had all the names of Christians, but all were not of the divine nature of Christ; and this was in the latter days, or last times, of the Apostles age, as John said, Little Children, it is the last
time, as ye have heard that Anti-christ shall come, even now there are many Anti-christs; whereby they knew that they were the last times, and the Anti-christs went out from the A∣postles into the world, and the world went after them, and so the Apostacy came in, and then they dayly encreased in the er∣rour & degeneration, from the (leader) pitiful, meek, suffering and saving spirit; so darkness, ignorance, hardness of heart, and envy encreased among them that had the name of Chri∣stians, but had lost the nature of Christ, and the spirit of envy and persecution began to appear to be chief among them; then the Beast rose up out of them, that were like the Sea, who re∣ceived this imposing power from the old Dragon, that stirred up the Jews to Crucisie the Lord of life; and so the Beast set up an Image, and caused the people to worship his Image; and the Saints of the most High that would not worship the Image of the Beast, nor receive his Mark in their foreheads, or in their right hands, were to be stain, such was their imposition for their imagined way of worship, and they made war with the Saints of the most High, and overcame them, and killed both small and great, that would not worship the Beast and his Image; and the man▪ child Christ Jesus was caught up to God, and the woman sled into the wilderness, where she hath been nourished in the time of Apostacy, and blindness of peoples minds; and oh what havock hath this soul-betraying spirit of envy and persecution made, with and among the Christians, so called in the Apostacy? & how hath he set Kings, & Princes, and Nations, and Kingdomes, and Priests, and people, one a∣gainst another about Religion and Worship? and how griev∣ously have people been enslaved through Christendome by this spirit of persecution, to martyr and murther one another, the Papists against the Protestants, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and other Sects, and the Lutherans, Protestants, Presbyterians, and others, against the Papists, and all about Religion, and all called Christians, and all lyable to suffer (as often they have done) by the Heathen; so mischievous and treche∣rous hath this persecuting spirit betrayed people to death, about their form of Worship, that hath stood in outward things, and all hath been without the spirit of love unfeigned,
and out of natures affection; and they were the persecuters that had the powers of the earth on their sides, and were up∣permost; and so they have rowled to and fro, and tumbled up and down like the Sea, and broke one another like the waves thereof, and destroyed and devoured one another like the fishes of the Sea, and beasts of the field, and all about Service and Worship, and every one counting his own way right, and all others wrong, while all their hands have been full of blood, and all are out of the Spirit that teaches to love enemies, and to forgive enemies, and so to overcome the evil with the good spirit of love and forgiveness; and so they have been all wrong in persecuting one another, and revenging one upon another, and seeking to overcome one another with the evil spirit of cruelty and persecuting, and so the very name Chri∣stian is abhorred among the Heathen, Turks, and Indians, and Jewes also, by reason of this devilish spirit of envy and perse∣cution, which hath made slaves of whole Nations of people called Christians, who hath done or fulfilled the lusts of the Old Dragon, from whence all these Wars and Jars, and kil∣ling one another about Religion and Service, did first arise in this long Night of Apostacy, which Christ, the true Pro∣phet, said should come, wherein no man should work, &c. And now take notice how this great enemy hath wrought in this Age in which we live, after that it pleased God to en∣lighten mens understandings somwhat more than in some A∣ges past, and to awaken the Consciences of some to seek af∣ter God more strictly than before: Then they began to re∣form from some Idolatry, as they counted it, and to learn some of the Traditions of their fore∣fathers, which were almost all Papists, about a hundred years ago, and many were zealous for godliness; but then this spirit began to work afresh among people in this our native Country of England; and af∣ter some reformation inwardly, the enemy got up among them, and led many into new inventions, and Traditions of their own; and then the envious spirit of persecution got up, and then they that were in the old Traditions and Invented
wayes of Service and Worship, and they that imagined and invented new Inventions, and set up other Traditions, rose up one against another in the spirit of envy and persecution. And oh what a work hath been within this 20 years, which may never be forgotten. First, what killing and slaying one another, and throwing down others Traditions, and slighting their Way and Ministers, and setting up others that had stol∣len more of the good words and fair Speeches, whereby they so much the more deceived the hearts of the simple? And oh how lovly were the Reformed Ministry and people! and how did they crow over others that did not reform, while they had a dunghil to stand upon? and then what hunting was there among the best reformed Ministers for great Bene∣fices, and sometimes laying two or three little ones together, and then they mounted into the chief Seats in their Temples called Churches, and there they cryed against the Church of Rome, and against the Common-Prayer, and Organs, and Singing Boyes, and the like, and yet would take Tythes, which was the Romish wages and hire, although they refused to do the Romish Service; and so that hath stood, notwithstanding their changing; and that was not enough to serve some, but they would run and complain to the Powers that then were to get Augmentations: And notwithstanding their good words and fair speeches, their hearts went after their covetousness. And as the Priests did, so did many Rulers: Oh how they sought after Lordships, and others Estates, and so threw down others, and exalted themselves, notwithstanding their Reformation, so full of Pride, Covetousness, and Envy, was their hearts: And when the Presbiterians, Independents, and Baptists, and the like, who pretended for Liberty of Consci∣ence, were at the highest, and had the Rule among them, and the Papist and Episcopal were very low in England (which one would think were enough to make them remember a poor low, and afflicted people, throughout their Generation) I say their Liberty of Conscience was but to themselves, for it nei∣ther reached back to the Common-Prayer men, nor the Pa∣pist: Then the Lord would try them a little further with a
poor, despised, low and humble people, whom he chose out from among them all; some from the Common-Prayer men, and some from the Presbiterians, and some from the Indepen∣dants, and some from the Baptists, and the like; and when the Lord had called us, and begun to break our hearts in pieces by the power of his living Word, that was as a hammer in us, and thereby were we made to fear, tremble, shake and quake, and weep and mourn, like the holy men of God in Ages past: And when the Lord was thus fitting us for his own service, to sound sorth his praises, then the Professors they stood and wondred; scoffed and mocked at us, calling us Quakers, both Rulers, Priests, and people; and although they pretended Li∣berty of Conscience, yet we were haled out of our Meetings, and put in the Stocks, and beaten and abused, and imprisoned (for declaring the Truth) and our Goods made havock of, because we could not uphold such covetous hypocrites, as these Priests were: And much more did we suffer, notwith∣standing their talk of Liberty of Conscience; and then in the power of God we were made to cry out against deceit and hypocrisie, for which we suffered by the hands of the unrea∣sonable; and this wicked, envious, persecuting spirit, was the Author of all that mischief: And we were so mortified in our minds, and humbled in our spirits, by the opperation of the power of our God, which we received in his eternal Light, that we could do them no evil, but good for evil; and there∣by were we made both able and willing to do, or to suffer, whatsoever we were called unto for his Names sake; and waiting in his true Light, we have seen how this wicked soul∣betraying spirit of envy and persecution, hath betrayed and took Captive, and then made slaves of the sons and daughters of men, both souls and bodies, who were Gods people by Cre∣ation, but the Devil, he stole their hearts and minds from God, and out of the true Liberty of the sons of men, as men; and in that wretched and deplorable state were all Mankind in, we as well as others, before the new Creation, or being Regenerated, and Ransomed, and created again in Christ Je∣sus unto good works; by his living Word; and then the love of
God the Father, which he hath shed abroad in our hearts, did abound towards all Mankind upon the face of the whole earth, insomuch that our hearts were made sad, and heavy, and our souls did mourn in secret for them, and on their behalf, to see their bondage and slavery, and how this unreasonable, en∣vious, persecuting spirit, ruled over them, and made them unwilling to hearken unto the counsel of God their Creator, who sent many of us in his love and pity, to call them to re∣pentance, that they might receive the remission of sins, &c. and embrace the love and mercy that God held forth unto them-wards, not only in these neer Nations, out also to them that are afar of; but they have required us evilly for our good∣will, and true love towards them, both soul and body, even because we have told them the Truth, and spoke against, and struck at their greatest Enemy, the soul-betraying spirit of en∣vy and persecution; and they would not hear and consider, nor lay those things to heart, which most concerned their peace, and everlasting welfare of body and soul, but went on in hardness of heart, very contrary to the Light of Christ in their own Consciences, until they had filled up their mea∣sures of iniquity, and provoked the Holy One of Israel utterly to overturn them, and cast them out to be made a prey upon by the old betrayer of Persecuters to be destroyed and cut off as others have been before in Ages past, and that is the persecuting spirits work, to lead to destroy, and then to bring destroyers to destruction also, as all may see, that reads these lines with a good understanding. And this is a true and brief Description of this greatest and most destructive enemy of Mankind in the whole Creation, and how he hath betrayed Kings and Princes, and Kingdoms, and Nations of Jewes, Hea∣then, and Christians, so called, and also how he may be known and apprehended by a special Warrant. And further, be it known unto all that reads and under∣stands, that God, the Creator of Mankind, hath wholly and firmly decreed the taking and binding of this old Serpent, which is the Devil, shortly, and to cast him into the bottom∣less pit, and to shut and seal him down, that he may deceive
the Nations no more; and God will also cast them into the Lake, to be tormented with the Devil and his Angels for ever, that will not return to the Lord in the time while he calleth unto them, and striveth by his Light and Spirit with them, and waiteth to be good, and merciful, and gracious un∣to them; and this old Dragon is in a great rage, because his Kingdome and Reign draws towards an end, and he hath but a short time, as it is written in Rev. 12. And then shall those words of God be fulfilled, which he spake by the mouth of his Prophet Isaiah, For out of Zion shall go forth-the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem; and he shall judg among the Nations, and rebuke many people; and they shall beat their Swords into Plow-shares, and their Spears into Pruing hocks; and Nation shall not lift up Sword against Nation, neither shall they learn war any more, and they shall rejoyce together in love, and cry, Come let us walk in the light of the Lord, and go up unto the house of God that made us; for he shall teach us of his wayes: And then shall the people sing a new Song unto the Lord, and his people shall praise him from the ends of the earth, and they that were as a barren Wilderness shall lift up their voyce unto the most High, and shout for joy of heart, to see the Dra∣gon, that old Serpent, which is the Devil, that betrayed them into the curse and bitterness, and enmity one against another, taken and bound, and cast out into the bottomless pit, and sealed down, that he no more can deceive them; and then all may dwell together in love safely, and their souls greatly to rejoyce in the Lord of Hosts, and be exceeding joyful in God their Saviour, who cloaths his with the Robe of righteousness, and covereth them round about with the garment of salvation; And the Wolf and the Lamb shall feed together, and the Lyon shall eat straw like the Bullock, and they shall not hurt, nor de∣stroy in all my holy Mountain, saith the Lord. And we the people, whom God hath called, and chosen, and made faithful and acceptable to himself, through the work of his Son. Jesus Christ in us, and for us, who are thereby made the first fruits unto God, in this Age, after the long Night of Apostacy (into the grosse darkness, and great igno∣rance) from the true Light and Spirit of God, and Christ, that
reveals and gives the knowledge of the things of God; and from the first of our true convincement of sin and evill, by the Light in our Consciences; and from that very day in which God began to work in this great work of conversion out of the evil envious nature, into true love and humility, and out of the flesh into the Spirit, and to be of the new Birth, being born of the blessed womb of love, and to be translated out of the Kingdome of darkness and Satan, into the Kingdome of the Dear Son of God: I say, even from the very beginning unto this day, have we been hated, rejected, vilified, despised and reproached, and greatly afflicted and persecuted, and op∣pressed beyond measure; and all hath been for the exercise of our Conscience in the Service of God, and in love and good will towards men. And thus have they sought to weaken and break us, and scatter us into division, like themselves, and so to wear us out; and none of all the Powers of the earth that hath reigned in their time, hath been for us, but against us: But the Lord God Almighty, who raised us up out of the Dust, he hath been with us, and among us all along, and his right hand hath upheld us, and his outstretched arm hath sustain'd us, and they of us that had used carnal weapons heretofore, some in the for∣mer Kings Army, and some in the Parliaments Army, when they came to seel the stroak of the Sword of the Spirit of God upon that nature that led to draw the Sword; then he fell and perished by the Sword of the Spirit, that led to draw the car∣nal Sword, as Christ said it should be; and notwithstanding the great occasions, and provocations without number, that hath been given us, we have been kept (by the power of God, and through Faith in Christ) from putting forth a hand or a finger, to take up a carnal Sword, or other weapon, for, or against any creature any more, notwithstanding the tumults, changes, overturnings & strivings, & buffettings, that hath been among the sons of men, since the Lord, in the infiniteness of his love, hath called us out from amongst them, into peace with God on earth, and love to all Man-kind, who are his creatures. But many of us have been moved of the Lord to break our Swords in pieces, and other Instruments that were prepared against creatures, so that they might do no hurt; and this was as a sig∣nal
testimony that we should war no more, as we hope whole Nations will do in due time, when God hath slain the enmity that is in and among them by the power of his love, which is stronger than Death, as he hath done in us, Glory and Honour be given to our God, who lives for evermore, who hath brought us to stand witnesses for him, and of his works, as a Pattern to all Mankind upon the face of the whole earth; and as Christ said, By this shall all men know that you are my Disciples, if you have love one towards another: And through Faith and Pati∣ence, and Long-suffering, with love & goodness have we been made instruments to overcome the hearts and minds of many which hath been turned to the Light in their own Consciences, and to the Grace of God given unto them; and it is given un∣to us, and remaineth in our hearts, to continue in love to our very enemies, in the Faith and Patience, unto the finishing our course, for the Name and Glory of God, whether it be by life or death; for we have full assurance, how that it is better to dye in the Lord, than to live in sin. But let all spiritual Israel know assuredly, that the rod of the wicked shall not alwayes be upon the backs of the the righteous; for God will remove the yoak from off their necks, and wipe away all tears from their eyes, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away, although some may, as some hath finished their testimony in being slain for the Word of God, and are received into the Kingdome of everlasting peace, and Glory for ever; and our warfare is spiritual, and our weapons are not carnal, but mighty, through God, to the pul∣ling down of strong holds, and to the cutting down of every thing that riseth up against Christ within, that all may be insub∣jection unto him, whose right it is to reign; and so our victory is spiritual, and we do give thanks unto God, who hath given us victory over sin and death, hell, and the grave, and over the tempting spirit of envy & persecution in our own particulars, through faith in Christ Jesus, who is the great Shepherd and Bishop of our souls; and we do not at all desire victory over mens persons, as they do, who strive and fight with carnal wea∣pons, but our striving, and smiting, and fighting with our spi∣ritual weapons is against sin, and he that tempts to sin and, evil, which is the greatest enemy to mans everlasting peace, who is
the Devil and Dragon, and in the power of the meek spirit and Lambs nature, our-stroke is and shall be against him, in all his appearances within and without, as it hath been in the pure love of God the Father, Ʋnto whom be honour and glory, now and for evermore. And now all you that do own this Special Warrant from God, and his Law and Command from him, which is Light in every Conscience, and that which it requires, and are awake∣ned and stirred up thereby, against the spirit of envy and per∣secution, and in whose hearts it is to joyn with the Lamb, to make war with the Dragon, lend your ears to wisdomes voyce in you, and so far as these lines are according to the same, even so be instructed, how, and with what to arm your selves, so that you may not be overcome with this persecuting spirit, nor do any hurt to any of the Sons or Daughters of men, for as the Scripture saith, Wisdome is better than strength, or weapons of war in this work, and the lips of knowledge is a precious Jewel, and every purpose (herein) is established by Counsel; and with good advice make war, for I, saith the Lords Spirit, will make the soul-betraying spirit of persecu∣tion feel the stroak, and woe, and misery, and plagues, and Vials double filled of the wrath of the Almighty shall come upon the head and crown of thee thou subtle Serpent; but I have pity and bowels of mercy towards all mankind whom I have Created, saith the Lord, and I will wait yet a little longer for the return of the captivated ones, that I may shew mercy unto them, that do look unto me from the ends of the earth and be saved, and that I may shew compassion unto ten thousand times ten thousands of those that do return at my re∣proof, and come unto me by true and unseigned repentance, yea, a numberlesse number, that I may be exceeding good, and gracious unto them, as I have been unto thousands, that are already come home unto me by my true and everlasting Light, saith the Creator of mankind. And now all you that do own, and obey Gods Special War∣rant, the Light which he hath sent forth into your own hearts and consciences, you are all required to wait low in it, to see what you are to be armed with, and then to receive it in the
Light, and put it on, then you are still to wait, and to keep low, to hear the voyce of the meek soul-saving Spirit, and then to obey, and meekly to follow him, who is the Captain of our salvation, and then you will see how you are to war, and fight against the foes of your own house in every particu∣lar, and that not without hope of overcoming; and so, as you put off the works of darknesse, put on hope for an Helmet, and faith and love for your brest-plate and your shield, and let righteousnesse be your covering, and keep low in the patience, and let your feet be shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace; and put on therefore (as the Elect of God) bowels of mer∣cy, kindnesse, humblenesse of mind, meeknesse, long-suffering, for∣bearing one another, & forgiving one another: If any man hath a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye; and above all these things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfe∣ction; and so take unto you the whole Armour of God, and hold fast the sword of the Spirit, which is the power and word of God, that so you may be able to quenoh the fiery darts of the enemy; and through the strength of your Armour, and sharpnesse of your weapons, and through the word of God, and his grace, and the word of patience, or the opperation of his power to effect the work in you, you may be made victorious in the end of the Lambs war with the Dragon▪ in your particulars, that you may enjoy the presence and peace of God to your own souls, and then will you be for peace among men; and verily, this, thousands of your own selves cannot be ignorant of, how that there hath been many thousands, that have gone forth against the old Serpent in several Sects since the Apo∣stles dayes in the Apostacy, and for want of the inward spi∣ritual Armour, and weapons, and love, and wisdome to or∣der them, and to beat the enemy out of their own hearts first, they have armed themselves with outward Armour, and car∣nal weapons, and so in the ignorance have rose up one against another, and smote and killed one another about Religion and Worship, and what grievous havock hath been made about service of God in killing one another, and so the Devil hath escaped, and creatures hath suffered, and this hath been in the night, &c. Even as a great mans servants, although their Lord
and master was very patient and exceeding loving, and kind to them all, and though they all did amiss, and contrary to his will, yet he continued his goodness to them all, to see if they would learne to doe as he would have them, and be quiet one with another, and if they would not, but continue in naughtinesse, and rebellion against him, and one against another, then at the last he would reward them according to their doings; but those servants after they had done evil against their Lord and master, they would not agree together, but find fault one of anothers service, and then fight and beat one another impatiently about their masters service, and so provoke one another the more, till the enmity become so great that they began to kill one another, and then blood that toucheth blood, and so some destroyed others; and when he that was Lord over all saw that, he called them to an ac∣count that had killed their fellow servants, and required their blood at their hands; so they that had killed without mercy, they must dye without mercy; and that hath been, and will be the end that the persecuting spirit hath and will bring perse∣cuters to, that will not return at the Lords reproof. But they that have been armed with the Armour of Light and love, they through the faith, and power, and patience thereof overcome the envious persecuting spirit in themselvs first; and they are the called, and chosen, and faithful ones, that are with the Lamb, who have been exercised in the war∣fare within, against the Devil, and all the fleshly lusts, that have warred against the soul, first, before they came forth into the field, to joyn with Christ their Captain against his ene∣mies, or else the enemy within would make them turn to the enemy without, and so they in the faith and patience follow the Lamb, that taketh away the sin in the regeneration within, before they come to joyn with him in open proclaimed wars against the Dragon and old Serpent, and Gog and Magog, and all others that rise up against the holy Seed Christ the Lamb, who is the leader of all the whole Camp of God, and the Captain of their salvation. And now all you great and smal, high and low people, even from the Kings and Princes to the middle sort, and from them
to the meanest or least degree of all, to whom this Informa∣tion doth happen, you have a description of your greatest ad∣versary, the spirit of envy and persecution, which you are all required (and that by Special Warrant from your God that made you) to agree together, and stand up with one consent, and with all your strength of love, joyn your selves to the no∣ble Principle of God in every particular, in order to the find∣ing out, stopping, apprehending, and taking of this insufferable enemy to mans peace on earth, and good will towards one an∣other, that Christ the Prince of peace may be chief among you all, to bring your souls into everlasting peace with the father, in his everlasting Kingdom. For of a truth, the Lord of Hosts and his Son is arising in power and great glory from on High, to destroy the grosse darknesse, and great City Babylon and Confusion, which hath reigned over the Kings of the earth, and set them one against another to destroy one another: And this Author of confu∣sion and strife, which is the spirit of pride and persecution hath no place in Heaven, but is cast out, and thrown down to the earth, and hath been, and still is in a great rage, because▪ he hath but a short time to reign there, and woe hath been, and still is to the inhabitants of the earth, as it is said in the Revela∣tion: And the Devil upon earth, and in the hearts of the children of disobedience hath stirred many Kings one against another, and Nations, and all hath through ignorance rose up against the Light and Lamb of God, but all they have and may do, and Gog and Magog together may rise up, and joyn in battel against the Lamb, and his chosen ones the Saints of the Most High, yet as it is said, The Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, Rev. 17. 14. And they that are with him that over comes, are called, and chosen, and faithful; and when Gog and Magog, and their Ar∣mies, hath made themselves in number as the sand of the Sea, and hath spread themselves on the bredth of the earth, and compassed the Camp of the Saints about, and the Beloved City; then shall fire come down from God out of Heaven, and devour them, and the Devil that deceived them, shall be cast into the Lake, where the
Fire never goeth out, as it is in Revelations the 20. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear; and the meek shall eat, and he satisfied, they shall praise the Lord that seek him, your hearts shall live for ever, that draw neer unto him. Oh let all the ends of the world remember, and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds and Nations shall worship before thee, that obey thy voyce, and their peace shall be as a flood, and their righteousnesse as the waves of the Sea, and they that through faith and patience, and by the power of the word of God do overcome, they shall inherit all things in the Kingdome of God and his Christ, and they shall sit down at the right hand of the Son of everlasting life and glory, even as he overcame, and is sate downe at the right hand of God, where is joy and pleasure for evermore, Amen. THE END.
