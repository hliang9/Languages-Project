ACHILLES SHIELD. Translated as the other seuen Bookes of Homer, out of his eighteenth booke of Iliades. By George Chapman Gent. LONDON Imprinted by Iohn Windet, and are to be sold at Paules Wharfe, at the signe of the Crosse Keyes. 1598.
To the most honored Earle, Earle Marshall. SPondanus, one of the most desertfull Com∣mentars of Homer, cals all sorts of all men learned to be iudicial beholders of this more then Artificiall and no lesse then Diuine Rapture; then which nothing can be ima∣gined more full of soule and humaine extra∣ction: for what is here prefigurde by our mi∣raculous Artist, but the vniuersall world, which being so spati∣ous and almost vnmeasurable, one circlet of a Shield representes and imbraceth? In it heauen turnes, the starres shine, the earth is enflowred, the sea swelles and rageth, Citties are built: one in the happinesse and sweetnesse of peace, the other in open warre & the terrors of ambush &c. And all these so liuely proposde, as not without reason many in times past haue belieued, that all these thinges haue in them a kind of voluntarie motion: euen as those Tripods of Vulcan, and that Dedalian Venus ; nor can I be resolu'd that their opinions be sufficiently refuted by Aristonicus, for so are all things here described, by our diuinest Poet, as if they consisted not of hard and solid mettals, but of a truely, liuing, and mouing soule: The ground of his inuention he shews out of Eustathius: intending by the Orbiguitie of the Shield, the roundnesse of the world: by the foure mettalles, the foure elementes: viz. by gold fire: by brasse earth for the hard∣nes: by Tinne water, for the softnes, and inclination to fluxure:
by siluer, Aire, for the grosnes & obscuritie of the mettal before it be refind. That which he cals , he vnder∣stands the Zodiack, which is said to be triple for the latitude it cō∣tains, & shining by reason of the perpetual course of the Sun made in that circle, by  the Axletree, about which heauē hath his motion &c. Nor do I deny (saith Spondanus) E∣neas arms to be forged, with an exceeding height of wit by Virgil, but comparde with these of Homer, they are nothing. And this is it (most honorde) that maketh me thus sodainely translate this Shield of Achilles, for since my publication of the other seuen bookes, comparison hath beene made betweene Virgill and Ho∣mer: who can be comparde in nothing with more decysall & cut∣ting of all argument, then in these two Shieldes; and whosoeuer shall reade Homer throughly and worthily, will know the que∣stion comes from a superficiall and too vnripe a reader: for Ho∣mers Poems were writ from a free furie, an absolute & full soule: Virgils out of a courtly, laborious, and altogether imitatorie spi∣rit: not a Simile hee hath but is Homers: not an inuention, person, or disposition, but is wholly or originally built vpon Ho∣mericall foundations, and in many places hath the verie wordes Homer vseth: besides, where Virgill hath had no more plen∣tifull and liberall a wit, then to frame twelue imperfect bookes of the troubles and trauailes of Aeneas: Homer hath of as little subiect finisht eight & fortie perfect: and that the triuiall obiecti∣on may be answerd, that not the number of bookes, but the nature and excellence of the worke commends it: All Homers bookes are such as haue beene presidents euer since of all sortes of Poems: imitating none, nor euer worthily imitated of any: yet would I not be thought so ill created as to bee a malicious detracter of so admired a Poet as Virgill, but a true iustifier of Homer, who must not bee read for a few lynes with leaues turned ouer capri∣chiously in dismembred fractions, but throughout; the whole
drift, weight & height of his workes set before the apprehsiue eyes of his iudge. The maiestie he enthrones and the spirit he infuseth into the scope of his worke so farre outshining Virgill, that his skirmishes are but meere scramblings of boyes to Homers; the silken body of Virgils muse curiously arest in guilt and embrode∣red siluer, but Homers in plaine massie and vnualued gold: not onely all learning, gouernment, and wisedome being deduc't as from a bottomlesse fountaine from him; but all wit, elegancie, dis∣position and iudgement.  &c. Homer (saith Plato) was the Prince and maister of all pray∣ses and vertues: the Emperour of wise men: an host of men a∣gainst any deprauer in any principle he held. All the ancient and lately learned haue had him in equall estimation. And for anie to be now contrarilie affected, it must needes proceed from a meere want onnesse of witte: an Idle vnthriftie spirit: wilfull because they may choose whether they will think otherwise or not, & haue power and fortune enough to liue like true men without truth, or els they must presume of puritanicall inspiration, to haue that with delicacie & squemishnes, which others with as good means, ten times more time, and ten thousand times more labour could neuer conceiue. But some will conuey their imperfections vnder his Greeke Shield, and from thence bestowe bitter arrowes a∣gainst the traduction, affirming their want of admiration grows from defect of our language, not able to expresse the coppie and elegancie of the originall: but this easie and traditionall pre∣text hides them not enough: for how full of height and round∣nesse soeuer Greeke be aboue English, yet is there no depth of con∣conceipt triumphing in it, but as in a meere admirer it may bee imagined; so in a sufficient translator it may be exprest. And Ho∣mer that hath his chiefe holinesse of estimation, for matter and instruction, would scorne to haue his supreame worthinesse glo∣sing in his courtshippe and priuiledge of tongue. And if Italian,
French & Spanish, haue not made it daintie, nor thought it any presumption to turne him into their languages, but a fit and ho∣norable labour and (in respect of their countries profit and their poesies credit) ost necessarie, what curious, proud, and poore shamefastnesse should let an English muse to traduce him, when the language she workes withall is more conformable, fluent, and expressiue; which I would your Lordship would commaunde mee to proue against all our whippers of their owne complement in their countries dialect. O what peeuish ingratitude and most vnreasonable scorne of our selues we commit, to bee so extrauagant and forreignely wit∣ted, to honour and imitate that in a strange tongue, which wee condemne and contemne in our natiue? for if the substance of the Poets will be exprest and his sentence and sence rendred with truth and elocution, hee that takes iudiciall pleasure in him in Greeke, cannot beare so rough a browe to him in English, to en∣tombe his acceptance in austeritie. But thou soule-blind Scalliger, that neuer hadst any thing but place, time and termes, to paint thy proficiencie in learning, nor euer writest any thing of thine owne impotent braine, but thy onely impalsied diminution of Homer (which I may sweare was the absolute inspiration of thine owne ridiculous Genius) neuer didst thou more palpably damn thy drossy spirit in al thy all coun∣tries-exploded filcheries, which are so grossely illiterate, that no man will vouchsafe their refutation, then in thy sencelesse repre∣hensions of Homer; whose spirit flew asmuch aboue thy groue∣ling capacitie, as heauen moues aboue Barathrum: but as none will vouchsafe repetition nor answere of thy other vnmanly foo∣leries: no more will I of these, my Epistle being too tedious to your Lo: besides, and no mans iudgement seruing better, (if your high affaires could admit their diligent perusall) then your Lo: to refute and reiect him. But alas Homer is not now to bee lift
vp by my weake arme, more then he is now deprest by more fee∣ble oppositions, if any feele not their conceiptes so rauisht with the eminent beauties of his ascentiall muse, as the greatest men of all sorts and of all ages haue beene. Their most modest course is, (vn∣lesse they will be powerfully insolent) to ascribe the defect to their apprehension, because they read him but sleightly, not in his sur∣mised frugalitie of obiect, that really and most feastfully powres out himselfe in right diuine occasion. But the chiefe and vnan∣swerable meane to his generall and iust acceptance, must be your Lo. high and of all men expected president, without which hee must like a poore snayle, pull in his English hornes, that out of all other languages (in regard of the countries affection, and royal∣tie of his Patrones) hath appeard like an Angell from a clowde, or the world out of Chaos. When no language can make compari∣son of him with ours if he be worthily conuerted; wherein before he should haue beene borne so lame and defectiue, as the French midwife hath brought him forth, he had neuer made questiō how your Lo. would accept him: and yet haue two of their Kings, em∣braced him, as a wealthy ornament to their studies, and the main battayle of their armies. If then your bountie would do me but the grace to conferre my vnhappie labours with theirs so successefull & commended (your iudgement seruing you much better then your leysure & yet your leisure in thinges honourable being to bee inforced by your iudge∣ment) no malitious & dishonorable whisperer, that comes armed with an army of authority and state against harmeles & armeles vertue, could wrest your wonted impression so much from it self, to reiect (with imitation of tiranous contempt any affection so zea∣lous & able in this kind to honor your estate as mine. Onely kings & princes haue been Homers Patrones, amongst whom Ptolo∣mie wold say, he that had sleight handes to entertayne Homer, had as sleight braines to rule his common wealth. And an vsuall
seueritie he vsed, but a most rationall (how precise and ridiculous soeuer it may seeme to men made of ridiculous matter) that in reuerence of the pietie and perfect humanitie he taught; whosoe∣uer writ or committed any proud detraction against Homer (as euen so much a man wanted not his malitious deprauers) hee put him with torments to extreamest death. O high and magically raysed prospect, from whence a true eye may see meanes to the ab∣solute redresse, or much to be wished extenuation, of all the vn∣manly degeneracies now tyranysing amongst vs: for if that which teacheth happinesse and hath vnpainefull corosiues in it, (being entertayned and obserued) to eate out the hart of that raging vl∣cer, which like a Lernean Fen of corruption furnaceth the v∣niuersall sighes and complaintes, of this transposed world; were seriously, and as with armed garrisons defended and hartned; that which engenders & disperseth, that wilfull pestilence, would bee purged and extirpate: but that which teacheth, being ouerturned, that which is taught is consequently subiect to euersion: and if the honour, happinesse and preseruation of true humanitie consist in obseruing the lawes fit for mans dignitie; and that the elaborate prescription of those lawes must of necessitie be authorised, fauou∣red and defended before any obseruation can succeed: is it vnrea∣sonable, to punish the contempt of that mouing prescription with one mans death, when at the heeles of it followes common neglect of obseruation, and in the necke of it, an vniuersall ruine? This my Lord I enforce only to interrupt in others that may reade this vnsauorie stuffe, the too open mouthd damnation of royall & ver∣tuous Ptolomies seueritie. For to digest, transforme and sweat a mans soule into rules and attractions to societie; such as are fa∣shiond and temperd with her exact and long laborde contention of studie; in which she tosseth with her impertiall discourse before her, all cause of fantasticall obiections and reproofes; and without which she were as wise as the greatest number of detractors that
shall presume to censure her; and yet by their flash and insolent ca∣stigations to bee sleighted and turnde ouer their miserably vaine tongues in an instant; is an iniurie worthy no lesse penaltie then Ptolomie inflicted. To take away the heeles of which running prophanation. I hope your Lo. honourable countenance will be as the Vnicorns horne, to leade the way to English Homers yet poy∣soned fountaine: for till that fauour be vouchsafed, the herde will neuer drinke, since the venemous galles of some of their fellowes haue infected it, whom alas I pittie. Thus confidently affirming your name and dignities shall neuer bee more honored in a poore booke then in English Homer, I cease to afflict your Lordshippe with my tedious dedicatories, and to still sacred Homers spirit through a language so fitte and so fauourles; humbly presenting your Achilleian vertues with Achilles Shield; wishing as it is much more admirable and diuine, so it were as many times more rich, then the Shield the Cardinall pawnd at Anwerp. By him that wisheth all the degrees of iudgement, and honour, to attend your deserts to the highest, George Chapman.
To the vnderstander. YOu are not euery bodie, to you (as to one of my very few friends) I may be bold to vtter my minde, nor is it more empaire to an honest and ab∣solute mans sufficiencie to haue few friendes, then to an Homericall Po∣eme to haue few commenders; for neyther doe common dispositions keepe fitte or plausible consort with iudiciall and simple honestie, nor are idle capacities comprehensible of an e∣laborate Poeme. My Epistle dedicatorie before my seuen bookes, is accounted darke and too much laboured: for the darkenes there is nothing good or bad, hard or softe, darke or perspicuous but in respect, & in respect of mens light, sleight, or enuious perusalles (to whose loose capa∣cities any worke worthily composde is knit with a riddle) & that the stile is materiall flowing, & not ranke, it may perhaps seeme darke, to ranke riders or readers, that haue no more soules then burbolts: but to your comprehensi∣on & in it selfe, I know it is not. For the affected labour be∣stowed in it, I protest two morninges both ended it and the Readers Epistle: but the truth is, my desire & strange disposition in all thinges I write, is to set downe vncom∣mon, and most profitable coherents for the time: yet fur∣ther remoued from abhorde affectation, then from the most popular and cold disgestion. And I euer imagine
that as Italian & French Poems to our studious linguistes, win much of their discountryed affection, as well because the vnderstanding of forreigne tongues is sweete to their apprehension, as that the matter & inuention is pleasing, so my farre fetcht, and as it were beyond sea manner of writing, if they would take as much paines for their poore countrimen as for a proud stranger when they once vn∣derstand it, should be much more gracious to their choice conceiptes, then a discourse that fals naked before them, and hath nothing but what mixeth it selfe with ordinarie table talke. For my varietie of new wordes, I haue none Inckepot I am sure you know, but such as I giue pasport with such authoritie, so significant and not ill sounding, that if my countrey language were an vsurer, or a man of this age speaking it, hee would thanke mee for enriching him: Why alas will my young mayster the reader affect nothing common, and yet like nothing extraordinarie? Swaggering is a new worde amongst them, and rounde headed custome giues it priuiledge with much imitation, being created as it were by a naturall Prosopopeia without etimologie or deriuation; and why may not an elegancie authentically deriued, & as I may say of the vpper house, bee entertayned as well in their lower consultation with authoritie of Arte, as their owne forgeries lickt vp by na∣ture? All tongues haue inricht themselues from their o∣riginall (onely the Hebrew & Greeke which are not spo∣ken amongst vs) with good neighbourly borrowing, and as with infusion of fresh ayre, and nourishment of newe blood in their still growing bodies, & why may not ours? Chaucer (by whom we will needes authorise our true en∣glish) had more newe wordes for his time then any man needes to deuise now. And therefore for currant wits to
crie from standing braines, like a broode of Frogs from a ditch, to haue the ceaselesse flowing riuer of our tongue turnde into their Frogpoole, is a song farre from their ar∣rogation of sweetnes, & a sin wold soone bring the plague of barbarisme amongst vs; which in faith needes not bee hastned with defences of his ignorant furtherers, since it comes with mealemouth'd toleration too sauagely vpon vs. To be short; since I had the reward of my labours in their consummation, and the chiefe pleasure of them in mine owne profit, no young preiudicate or castigatorie braine hath reason to thinke I stande trembling vnder the ayry stroke of his feuerie censure, or that I did euer expect any flowing applause from his drie fingers; but the satis∣faction and delight that might probably redound to eue∣rie true louer of vertue I set in the seat of mine owne pro∣fit and contentment; and if there be any one in whome this successe is enflowred, a few sprigges of it shall bee my garland. Since then this neuer equald Poet is to bee vn∣derstood, and so full of gouernment and direction to all estates; sterne anger and the affrights of warre, bearing the mayne face of his subiect; soldiers shall neuer spende their idle howres more profitablie, then with his studious and industrious perusall; in whose honors his deserts are infinite: Counsellors haue neuer better oracles then his lines: fathers haue no morales so profitable for their chil∣dren, as his counsailes: nor shal they euer giue them more honord iniunctions, then to learne Homer without book, that being continually conuersant in him, his height may descend to their capacities, and his substance proue their worthiest riches. Husbands, wiues, louers, friends, and allies, hauing in him mirrors for all their duties; all sortes of which concourse and societie in other more happy a∣ges,
haue in steed of sonnets & lasciuious ballades, sung his Iliades. Let the length of the verse neuer discourage your endeuours: for talke our quidditicall Italianistes of what proportion soeuer their strooting lips affect; vnlesse it be in these coopplets, into which I haue hastely translated this Shield, they shall neuer doe Homer so much right, in any octaues, canzons, canzonets, or with whatsoeuer fustian Epigraphes they shall entitle their measures. Onely the extreame false printing troubles my conscience, for feare of your deserued discouragement in the empaire of our Poets sweetnes; whose generall diuinitie of spirit, clad in my willing labours (enuious of none nor detracting any) I commit to your good nature and solid capacitie.
ACHILLES SHJELD. BRight footed Thetis did the Spheare aspire, (Amongst th' Immortals) of the God of fire, Starrie, incorruptible, and had frame Of ruddie brasse, right shaped by the lame. She found him at his swelling bellowes swea∣ting And twenty Tripods seriously beating, To stand and beautifie his royall hall, For chaires of honour, round about the wall, And to the feet he fixt of euerie one Wheeles of man-making gold to runne alone To the Gods Temples; to the which they were Religious ornaments, when standing there Till sacrifice were done, they would retyre To Vulcans house, which all eyes did admire: Yet the Dedalean handles to hold by Were vnimposde, which straite he did apply. These while he fashiond with miraculous Art, The fayre white-footed dame appearde apart To Charis with the rich-attyred head, Whose heauenly beauties strowd the nuptiall bed Of that illustrate Smith: she tooke her hand And entertained her with this kind demand, What makes the Goddesse with the ample traine,
(Reuerend and friendly Thetis) entertaine Conceipt to honour vs with her repaire, That neuer yet was kind in that affaire? But enter further, that so wisht a guest May be receiu'd with hospitable feast. Thus led she Thetis to a chaire of state, Rich and exceedingly elaborate, And set a footstoole at her siluer feet; Then cald her famous Smith; Vulcan my sweet, Thetis in some vse needes thy fierie hand: He answerd, Thetis hath a strong command Of all my powers; who gaue my life defence, Cast by my mothers wilfull impudence Out of Olimpus; who would haue obscur'd My natiue lamenes; then had I endurde Vnhelped griefes, if on her shining brest, Hospitious Thetis had not let me rest, And bright Eurinome, my Guardian, Faire daughter of the labouring Ocean, With whom nine yeares I wrought vp diuers thinges Buttons and bracelets, whistles, chaines, and rings, In concluse of a Caue; and ouer vs, The swelling waues of old Oceanus, With fomie murmure flowd, and not a God, Nor any mortall knew my close abode, But Thetis and diuine Eurinome, Who succord me; and now from gulphy sea To our steepe house hath Thetis made ascent, To whom requitall more then competent, It fits me much my safetie should repay; Charis do thou some sumptuous feast puruay, Whiles I my ayrie bellowes may lay by,
And all my tooles of heauenly ferrarie. Thus from his anuile the huge monster rose, And with distorted knees he limping goes To a bright chest, of siluer Ore composde, Where all his wonder-working tooles were closde, And tooke his sighing bellows from the fire; Then with a spunge, his breast with hayres like wire, His brawned necke, his hard handes and his face He clensde; put on his robe, assumde his mace, And halted forth, and on his steps attended Handmaides of gold that with stronge paces wended, Like dames in flowre of life; in whom were mindes Furnisht with wisedome, knowing all the kinds Of the Gods powers; from whom did voyces flie, In whom were strengthes, and motions voluntary. These at his elbow euer ministred: And these (drawing after him his legges) he led To Thetis seated in a shining throne, Whose hand he shooke and askt this question. What wisht occasion brings the seas bright Queen To Vulcans house, that euer yet hath beene So great a stranger? shew thy reuerend will, Which mine of choyce commands me to fulfill, If in the reach of all mine Arte it lie, Or it be possible to satisfie? Thetis powrd out this sadreply in teares: O Vulcan is there any Goddesse beares (Of all the deities that decke the skie) So much of mortall wretchednes as I, Whom Ioue past all depriues of heauenly peace? My selfe of all the blew Nereides, He hath subiected to a mortals bed,
Which I against my will haue suffered To Peleus surnamed Aeacides, Who in his court lies slaine with the disease Of wofull age; and now with new infortunes He all my ioyes to discontents importunes In giuing me a sonne, chiefe in renowne Of all Heroes; who hath palme-like growne, Set in a fruitfull soyle; and when my care Had nurst him to a forme so singulare, I sent him in the Grecians crooke-sternd fleete To Ilion, with the swiftnes of his feete, And dreadfull strength, that his choyce lims indude To fight against the Troian fortitude: And him I neuer shall receyue retirde, To Peleus court; but while he liues inspirde With humaine breath, and sees the Suns cleare light. He must liue sad and moodie as the night. Nor can I cheer him, since his valures price Resignde by all the Grecians comprimise, Atrides forst into his fortunes part For which, Consumption tires vppon his hart: Yet since the Troians, all the Greekes conclude Within theyr forte, the Peeres of Greece haue sude With worthynes of gifts and humble prayers, To winne his hand to harten their affayres Which he denyde: but to appease theyr harmes, He deckt his dear Patroclus in his armes And sent him with his bandes to those debates: All daye they fought before the Scaean gates And well might haue expugnde, by that black light, The Ilian Cittie, if Appollos spight, Thirsting the blood of good Menetius sonnes
Had not in face of all the fight foredone His faultlesse life; and authord the renowne On Hectors prowesse, making th' act his owne: Since therefore, to reuenge the timelesse death Of his true friend, my sonne determineth T'embrue the field; for want whereof he lies Buried in dust, and drownde in miseries: Hereat thy knees I sue, that the short date Prefixt his life by power of enuious fate Thou wilt with heauenly armes grace and maintaine Since his are lost with his Patroclus slaine. He answerd, be assurde, nor let the care Of these desires thy firmest hopes empaire: Would God as farre from lamentable death, When heauie fates shall see it with his breath, I could reserue him, as vnequald armes, Shal be found neere t'auert all instant harmes, Such armes as all worlds shall for art admire, That by their eyes their excellence aspire. This said, the smith did to his bellowes goe, Set them to fire, and made his Cyclops blow: Full twentie paire breathd through his furnace holes All sorts of blastes t'enflame his temperd coles, Now blusterd hard, and now did contrarise, As Vulcan would, and as his exercise Might with perfection serue the dames desire. Hard brasse and tinne he cast into the fire, High-prised gold and siluer, and did set Within the stocke, an anuile bright and great: His massie hammer then his right hand held, His other hand his gaspingtongues compeld. And first he forgde a huge and solid Shield,
may  varant artship yeeld, three ambitious circles cast, and refulgent; and without he plac't A siluer handle; fiuefold proofe it was, And in it many thinges with speciall grace, And passing arteficiall pompe were grauen; In it was earthes greene globe, the sea and heauen, Th'vnwearied Sunne; the Moone exactly round, And all the starres with which the skie is crownd, The Pleyades, the Hyads, and the force Of great Orion; and the Beare, whose course Turnes her about his Sphere obseruing him Surnam'de the Chariot, and doth neuer swimme Vpon the vnmeasur'de Oceans marble face, Of all the flames that heauens blew vayle enchace. In it two beautious Citties he did build Of diuers languag'd men; the one was fild With sacred nuptialles and with solemne feastes, And through the streetes the faire officious guests, Lead from their brydall chambers their faire brides With golden torches burning by their sides. Hymens sweet triumphes were abundant there, Of youthes and damzels dauncing in a Sphere; Amongst whom masking flutes & harps were heard, And all the matrones in their dores appearde, Admiring their enamored braueries; Amongst the rest busie contention flies About a slaughter; and to solemne Court The Cittizens were drawne in thicke resort, Where two contended for a penaltie: The one due satisfaction did deny, At th'others hands for slaughter of his friend,
The other did the contrarie defend: At last by arbitration both desirde, To haue their long and costly suit expirde, The friends cast sounds confusde on eyther side, Whose tumult straight the Herraldes pacifide. In holy circle and on polisht stones, The reuerend Iudges made their sessions, The voycefull Herralds awfull scepters holding, And their graue doomes on eyther side vnfolding. In middest two golden talents were proposde For his rich see by whom should be disclosde The most applausiue sentence: th'other towne Two hoste besiegde, to haue it ouerthrown, Or in two parts to share the wealthy spoyle, And this must all the Cittizens assoyle. They yeeld to neyther but with close alarme, To sallies and to ambuscados arme, Their wiues and children on their walles did stand, With whom and with the old men they were mand. The other issude; Mars and Pallas went, Propitious Captaaines to their braue intent. Both golden did in golden garments shine Ample and faire, and seemde indeede diuine. The soldiers were in humbler habites deckt. When they had found a valley most select, To couch their ambush, (at a riuers brinke Where all their heards had vsuall place to drinke) There (clad in shining steele) they close did lie, And set farre off two sentinels to spie, When all their flocks and crooke-hancht heards came neere Which soone succeeded and they followed were By two poore heardsmen that on bagpipes plaid,
Doubtlesse of any ambuscados laid: The sentinels gaue word, and in they flew, Tooke heards and flockes, and both their keepers slew. The enemie hearing such a strange vprore About their cattell; being set before In solemne counsell, instantly tooke horse, Pursude and at the flood, with mutuall force, The conflict ioynd; betwixt them flew debate, Disorderd Tumult, and exitial Fate; Here was one taken with wounds bleeding greene, And here one pale, and yeelding, no wound seene: Another slaine; drawne by the strengthles heeles From the red slaughter of the ruthles steeles, And he that slew him on his shoulders wearing His bloodieweedes as trophies of his daring. Like men aliue they did conuerse in fight, And tyrde on death with mutuall appetite. He carude besides a soft and fruitfull field, Brode and thrice new tild in that heauenly shield, Where many plowmen turnd vp here and there The earth in furrowes, and their soueraigne neere They striu'd to worke; and euery furrow ended A bowle of sweetest wine hee still extended To him that first had done; then turnde they hand, Desirous to dispatch that peece of land, Deep and new earde; black grew the plow with mould Which lookt like blackish earth though forgd of gold. And this he did with miracle adorne. Then made he grow a field of high-sprung corne, In which did reapers sharpned sickles plie: Others, their handfulles falne confusedly Laid on the ridge together; others bound
Their gatherd handfulles to sheaues hard and round Three binders were appointed for the place, And at their heeles did children gleane apace, Whole armefulles to the binders ministring. Amongst all these all silent stood their king, Vpon a balke, his Scepter in his hand, Glad at his heart to see his yeeldie land. The herraldes then the haruest feast prepare, Beneath an Oke far off, and for their fare, A mightie Oxe was slaine, and women drest Store of white cakes, and mixt the labourers feast. In it besides a vine yee might behold Loded with grapes, the leaues were all of gold, The bunches blacke and thicke did through it growe, And siluer props sustainde them from below: About the vine an azure dike was wrought, And about it a hedge of tinne he brought. One path went through it, through the which did passe The vintagers, when ripe their vintage was. The virgines then and youthes (childishly wise) For the sweet fruit did painted cuppes deuise, And in a circle bore them dauncing round, In midst whereof a boy did sweetly sound His siluer harpe, and with a piercing voyce, Sung a sweete song; when each youth with his choice Triumphing ouer earth, quicke daunces treades. A heard of Oxen thrusting out their heades And bellowing, from their stalles rushing to feed Neere a swift flood, raging and crownd with reed, In gold and tinne he carued next the vine, Foure golden heardsemen following; heard-dogsni. Waiting on them; in head of all the heard,
To my admired and soule-loued friend Mayster of all essentiall and true knowledge, M. Harriots. TO you whose depth of soule measures the height, And all dimensions of all workes of weight, Reason being ground, structure and ornament, To all inuentions, graue and permanent, And your cleare eyes the Spheres where Reason moues; This Artizan, this God of rationall loues Blind Homer; in this shield, and in the rest Of his seuen bookes, which my hard hand hath drest, In rough integuments I send for censure, That my long time and labours deepe extensure Spent to conduct him to our enuious light, In your allowance may receiue some right To their endeuours; and take vertuous heart From your applause, crownd with their owne desert. Such crownes suffice the free and royall mind, But these subiected hangbyes of our kind, These children that will neuer stand alone, But must be nourisht with corruption, Which are our bodies; that are traitors borne, To their owne crownes their soules: betraid to scorne, To gaudie insolence and ignorance: By their base fleshes frailties, that must daunce, Prophane attendance at their states and birth,
That are meere seruants to this seruile earth, These must haue other crownes for meedes then merits, Or sterue themselues, and quench their fierie spirits. Thus as the soule vpon the flesh depends, Vertue must wait on wealth; we must make friends, Of the vnrighteous Mammon, and our sleights, Must beare the formes of fooles or Parasites. Rich mine of knowledge, ô that my strange muse Without this bodies nourishment could vse, Her zealous faculties, onely t'aspire, Instructiue light from your whole Sphere of fire: But woe is me, what zeale or power soeuer My free soule hath, my body will be neuer Able t'attend: neuer shal I enioy, Th'end of my happles birth: neuer employ That smotherd feruour that in lothed embers, Lyes swept from light, and no cleare howre remembers. O had your perfect eye Organs to pierce Into that Chaos whence this stiffled verse By violence breakes: where Gloweworme like doth shine In nights of sorrow, this hid soule of mine: And how her genuine formes struggle for birth, Vnder the clawes of this fowle Panther earth. Then vnder all those formes you should discerne My loue to you, in my desire to learne Skill and the loue of skill do euer kisse. No band of loue so stronge as knowledge is: Which who is he that may not learne of you, Whom learning doth with his lights throne endow? What learned fields pay not their flowers t'adorne Your odorous wreathe? compact, put on and worne, By apt and Adamantine industrie,
Proposing still demonstrate veritie, For your great obiect, farre from plodding gaine, Or thirst of glorie; when absurd and vayne, Most students in their whole instruction are, But in traditions meere particular: Leaning like rotten howses, on out beames, And with true light fade in themselues like dreames. True learning hath a body absolute, That in apparant sence it selfe can suite, Not hid in ayrie termes as if it were Like spirits fantastike that put men in feare, And are but bugs form'd in their fowle conceites, Nor made forsale glas'd with sophistique sleights; But wrought for all times proofe, strong to bide prease, And shiuer ignorants like Hercules, On their owne dunghils; but our formall Clearkes Blowne for profession, spend their soules in sparkes, Fram'de of dismembred parts that make most show, And like to broken limmes of knowledge goe. When thy true wisedome by thy learning wonne Shall honour learning while there shines a Sunne; And thine owne name in merite; farre aboue, Their Timpanies of state that armes of loue, Fortune or blood shall lift to dignitie; Whome though you reuerence and your emperie, Of spirit and soule, be seruitude they thinke And but a beame of light broke through a chink To all their watrish splendor: and much more To the great Sunne, and all thinges they adore, In staring ignorance: yet your selfe shall shine Aboue all this in knowledge most diuine, And all shall homage to your true-worth owe,
You comprehending all, that all, not you And when thy writings that now errors Night Chokes earth with mistes, breake forth like easterne light, Showing to euery comprehensiue eye, High sectious brawles becalmde by vnitie, Nature made all transparent, and her hart Gripte in thy hand, crushing digested Art In flames vnmeasurde, measurde out of it, On whose head for her crowne thy soule shall sitte. Crownd with Heauens inward brightnes shewing cleare, What true man is, and how like gnats appeare. O fortune-glossed Pompists, and proud Misers, That are of Arts such impudent despisers; Then past anticipating doomes and skornes, Which for selfe grace ech ignorant subornes, Their glowing and amazed eyes shall see How short of thy soules strength my weake words be, And that I do not like our Poets preferre For profit, praise and keepe a squeaking stirre With cald on muses to vnchilde their braines Of winde and vapor: lying still in paynes, Of worthy issue; but as one profest In nought but truthes deare loue the soules true rest. Continue then your sweet iudiciall kindnesse, To your true friend, that though this lumpe of blindnes, This skornefull, this despisde, inuerted world, Whose head is furie-like with Adders curlde, And all her bulke a poysoned Porcupine, Her stings and quilles darting at worthes deuine, Keepe vnder my estate with all contempt, And make me liue euen from my selfe exempt, Yet if you see some gleames of wrastling fire, Breake from my spirits oppression, shewing desire
To become worthy to pertake your skill, (Since vertues first and chiefe steppe is to will) Comfort me with it and proue you affect me, Though all the rotten spawne of earth reiect me. For though I now consume in poesie, Yet Homer being my roote I can not die. But lest to vse all Poesie in the sight, Of graue philosophie shew braines too light To comprehend her depth of misterie, I vow t'is onely strong necessitie Gouernes my paines herein, which yet may vse A mans whole life without the least abuse. And though to rime and giue a verse smooth feet, Vttering to vulgar pallattes passions sweet Chaunce often in such weake capriccious spirits, As in nought else haue tollerable merits, Yet where high Poesies natiue habite shines, From whose reflections flow eternall lines: Philosophy retirde to darkest caues She can discouer: and the proud worldes braues Answere in any thing but impudence. With circle of her general excellence For ample instance Homer more then serueth, And what his graue and learned Muse deserueth, Since it is made a Courtly question now, His competent and partles iudge be you; If these vaine lines and his deserts arise To the high serches of your serious eyes As he is English: and I could not chuse But to your Name this short inscription vse, As well assurde you would approue my payne In my traduction; and besides this vayne
Excuse my thoughts as bent to others ames Might my will rule me, and when any flames Of my prest soule break forth to their own show Thinke they must hold engrauen regard of you. Of you in whom the worth of all the Graces, Due to the mindes giftes, might embrew the faces Of such as skorne them, and with tiranous eye Contemne the sweat of vertuous industrie. But as ill lines new fild with incke vndryed, An empty Pen with their owne stuffe applied Can blot them out: so shall their wealth-burst wombes Be made with emptie Penne their honours tombes. FINIS.
