SIR EDWARD HVNGERFORDS Vindication, for the surren∣dring of Malmsbury in Wiltshire to the Kings forces, after it was taken by Sir William VValler. SIR, I Have not heard that either the let∣ter subscribed by Sir William Waller, Sir Arthur Haslerigge, and my selfe at Malmsbury, to certifie the Parlia∣ment of the taking of that towne, or mine, (within a few dayes after) relating the ha∣sty deserting of that towne unto the enemy; was e∣ver read, or came to the view of either House of Par∣liament, Wherefore to avoid mistakes or mis-un∣derstandings, that may happen by Common fame, I
shal breifly give you the true relation both of tak∣ing and deserting of the said Towne. Vpon the Tus∣day senight before Easter, about one of the clock in the afternoone, Sir VVilliam VValler came before it, and at the fist onset tooke the Suburbs, but the Towne held out longer, being fiercely assaulted by our men, all that afternoone, till about ten of the clock at night, and aswell defended by the Enemy within then being weary on both sides there was a pawse for a few houres, after which our drums bea∣ting an Allarum, the enemy began to treat, and up∣on Wednesday by seaven of the Clock in the mor∣ning, Sir William did peaceably enter the Towne, where besides three hundred prisoners that was ta∣ken, there was an Iron Saker, some Musquets, and some Pikes, and some few horses taken, but little or no ammunition. I was apointed to take the charge of that Towne and accordingly expected to have it left withall things for defence, but much businesse happening, and Sir William Waller hastening out of Towne up∣on his designe towards Gloucester, before any con∣sultation, could be had concerning the settlement thereof, upon Thursday I went out of Malmesbury to wards Tedbury, with Sir William Waller at what time the Town was left with more Prisoners then Soul∣diers, without Ammunition and money, and by the way mentioning to Sir William Waller, the danger∣ous condition of that Towne if he left not there a very considerable party, especially in case he remov∣ed to any remote place, without forceing the enemy first from Cirencester, who was there at that time ve∣ry
strong both in horse and foote, whereupon Sir William Waller did that evening at Tedbury order 3. Barrells of Pouder to be presently sent unto Mal∣mesbury, and appointed Major Clyfton to repaire thi∣ther, to joyne with Major Trayle, in the ordering of the forces there, that Captain Talbot with his Troop should presently go thither, to guard the Prisoners from thence the next day to Bath and Captaine Wal∣don with his parcell of Dragooners, neare upon 20. to remaine at Malmesbury, I conceiving that the said Serjeant Major Clifton sent thither by Sir Wil∣liam Waller was a Commander able and fit to give direction and secure the Towne, I left all my forces with him at Malmesbury, and went my selfe to Bath attended onely with my owne servants, spee∣dily to send more Ammunition Men and Horse, whereof there was not at Malmesbury a sufficient number for Scouts, as also to get money for the payment of the Garison at Malmesbury, whilst I was about this worke, had gotten my horses together, made up two companies ready on their march to∣wards Malmesbury, with Ammunition which was wanting there, for Ordnance, and a supply of other Ammunition, newes was brought that Malmesbury was abandoned, (and for ought I could understand) rather upon the conceipt then sight of an enemy, the cause of this conceived to be, from an appre∣hension of the power of an enemy neare them; the smale force they had then in the Towne (not ex∣ceeding one hundred and Twentie Souldiers) to make resistance, the backwardens of the Country to come in to beare Armes or to assist with money
who seemed very forward whilest Sir William Waller was present but altered their minds so soone as they did see him with his Army, to be departed from them, my Souldiers generally discontented, that they had not Pillage as others who tooke lesse paines (as they thought) and lost no blood, over bur∣thened with duties, being but a few in number, and howerly raised with Allarumes. The Captaines at odds amongst themselves, Ma∣jor Trayle that should have reconciled all, not so carefull as he ought, Major Clifton that was sent to joyne with him, gone away from thence to Bath, these two being the able Commanders, especially trusted for the defence of the Towne, One of the Officers also amongst them, did much increase their feares, and seeing false Alarumes, and after as their number decreased, did helpe to disarme the remain∣der; also two of the Captaines that should have en∣couraged them, told them that they were all but dead men, if they did not flie forth presently, they being the first that shewed them the way by their example; after this the souldiers could not be stay∣ed, butein spit of their Captaine & Officers which were left, who sought to keepe them in, they ranne away so that within a houre or two, there were scarce tenne souldiers left in the Towne, thus was Malmsebury left at eleven of the Clock upon Sat∣terday at night, no enemy entring until seven of the clock next morning being Sunday. At this present the enemie hath in Garrison there, foure hundred foot, and Curston his Troope of Horse, Collonell Bawfeild, is appointed Gover∣nour
thereof, and this is the true relation of the winning and loosing of that Towne, within lesse then the space of a weeke, (as will be testified by many of very good credit) wherewith I shall en∣treate you to acquaint the House, that they may not suffer their servants in the Countrey to undergoe an ill oppinion, who have not deserved the same, which is all that I have at this time, to recommend unto you, but that I am. Bath. 28. Aprill 1643. Your humble Servant. Edward Hungerford. FJNJS.
