THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOULE: The Excellencie of CHRIST JESVS, treated on. Wherein the faithfull people of God may finde comfort for their Souls. By T. H. Published according to Order. LONDON, Printed in the yeer 1645.
THE IMMORTALITY OF The SOƲLE. What will it profit a man to win the whole world and to lose his own soule?Mat. 16.26. saith our glorious Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus, the soule of man is a spirituall, immortall,Psal. 31.8. substance which did flow from God,Eccles. 22.7. and cannot die with the body, but returne to God that gave it, unlesse it rebell a∣gainst his Father and Maker, his laws and true Church, and hath no true lively faith to save himselfe by applying Christs righteous∣nesse to himselfe by a lively faith; then these souls must die the ever∣living death of torment, but God made the soule of man righte∣ous, but he hath sought to himselfe many inventions: the bodies of all men must turn to dust again untill the day of the Lord come, and then shall the dead heare the voice of the Sonne of God,Luke 23.43. and shall stand up in more strength and spirituall power, and meet our Lord Jesus to be judged, every one according to our faith and workes. The body of man hath five senses, seeing hearing, smel∣ling, tasting and feeling; the living and immortall soule hath in him understanding and knowledge, the will and the remembrance, imaginptions, the affections and wisdome to rule the senses of the body and the evill lusts of the soule, which joyne with the body to sinfull actions, but let wisdome, and grace and knowledge look hp to God for help and strength to withstand them, and as the body hath hands and feet, so hath the living soule in him many faculties: Faith is a vertue of the soule, unbeliefe is a vice, humi∣lity as a vertue of the soule, pride is a vice, the love of God and his
Saints a vertue of the soule, hatred a vice, zeal for Gods glory and true worship a vertue of the soule, coldesse a vice,  a vertue lying a vice there i a vertue, nely a vice  a vere of the soule, envie a vice, thankfulnesse a vertue of the soule, un∣thankfulnesse a vice, bounty and freenesse of minde of the gifts which we have received of God, riches or knowledge are both of them a vertue of the soule, covetousnesse, and hiding Gods talems in the earth, avice spealing honourably of God, and of the word of God, a vertue of the soule: swearing cursing, blasphemie, and mocking of the word of God, great vices of the soule: wit, policy, valour, sound judgement and discerning of spirits are Gods good gifts, and should be used well: ths the soule, the spirituall sub∣stance, the immortall soule, the holy Image of God before mans fall, which God did breath into man and made him righteous and excellent in knowledge, but now the children of wrath by Adams fall and originall sin, but the soules of the faithfull are renewed by Jesus Christ our glorious Lord and Saviour, and shall be made perfect in heaven for ever more: For the soules of the Saints shall sodainly come from heaven again to the body in love and peace, saying, as it were, Arise, my loving friend and dear companion, the day of Christ our King is come, the darke winter of trouble and sorrow persecution, sicknesse, poverty and death it selfe is gons, come see thy glorious Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus which redeemed thee, with all his holy companion of Saints and Angels, come lift up thy head and receive thy acquistance from all thy sins, and live in glory for ever. But ungodly, faithlesse men which have done ill, griefe, the worme of conscience shall bite them, saying, who shall hide us from the wrath of the Judge? but the godly redeemer shall comfort them saying Come yee blessed of my Father, receive and eternall Kingdome, and enter into jour Masters joy: All Glory, and thanks, and prayse be unto God, for all his free mercie and gifts, both now and for ever more.
The excellencie of CHRIST JESVS. THe soule of man is a noble spirituall creature, created of God to obey him, as was Adam and Evah in Paradice, but the Devill by temptations, quickly spoyled his innocent righteous soul, defaced Gods Image, and then his shining body became miserable and naked, his perfect soul became miserable, sinfull and ignorant; then were their souls and bodies to dye the death naturall and e∣ternall for ever: but then the mercy and love of God appeared and promised, that the seed of the woman should breake the Serpents head; this was our glorious Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus which came in due time to restore Gods Image, and to destroy the works of the Devill, to suffer and satisfie Gods justice for the sins of all the believing world, which lay hold on him by a lively faith, to in graft them into himselfe to adopt and make them his beloved children and heires of the Kingdome of heaven: for Christ Jesus our glorious Lord and Saviour is the only Son of God, in whom alone he is well pleased; he is the naturall son of God begotten be∣gotten before the stars appeared, hee is the graven form of God, the brightnesse of the glory, the Image of the invisible God, the first begotten Son of God; begotten before all worlds, God of Gods very God of very God eeuall with the Father & with the holy Ghost, he is the head of the Church, and in him all fulnesse dwelleth; thy sent, a Christ! endureth for ever: the scepter of thy Kingdome doth mayt am righteousnesse. The Lord said unto my Lord, sit on my right hand, untill I make thy foes a stool whereon thy feet may stand: Christ Jesus is the mighty Lion of the tribe of Ju∣dah, which overcame the roaring and devouring Lion the Devill; He is the Lambe of God which was slain for our sins, and taketh away the sins of the world, hee is the mighty God, the Prince of peace, which trod the winepresse of the wrath of God alone, and con∣quered
death, hell, and the grave, and the infernall spirits, and hee arose and sustained himself by his own power and strength, and sits at the right hand of the glory of God for ever. Christ Jesus was promised to Adam and Evah, to Abraham and to David, he was prophesied by Enoch Jacob, Moses, Esay Jeremiah, Daniell Za∣chariah, by all the Prophets; and hee was typed out by Isaak, Samson, Salomon Jonah, and the brazen Serpent in the Wilder∣nesse, Christ Jesus out Lord and Saviour was wayted and looked for of all the faithfull from the beginning of the World: and when he was come all his Apostles beare witnesse of him both in life, death and writing; the Angels from Heaven bring joyfull tydings, and beare witnesse of him: Christs wondrous works beare wit∣nesse of him, God the Father from Heaven beare witnesse of him, his workes beare witnesse of him, and shall judge men at the last day; thousands of Martyrs have shed their deerest bloud in defence of this truth, Christs Preachers by the holy Ghost preach his Word, and him the innocent bloud of the children which Herod slue were Martyrs for him, Christ and his Apostles and Deacons, great works and miracles beare witnes of him; Five hundred Brethren at once saw him risen again, the Angels beare witnesse of his resurrection. Christs Apostles beare witnesse of him, and did eat and drink with him after he was ri∣sen. Againe, before that Mary saw him, and cryeth out, Master, and Thomas felt his hands and his sides, and cryeth out, My Lord, and God; and after hee had beene seene of them the space of forty days, he gathered together his Apostles, and promised them to send the holy Ghost to comfort them, and then hee ascends to Heaven before their faces, where he sits at the right hand of God in glo∣ry untill he come again, to render vengeance to his enemies, which persecute and wrong his Saints, and will not obey the Gospell of our Lord Jesus Christ; and then will Christ Jesus gather his Saints and faithfull people from the East to West, and from all pla∣ces, with thousands of might, quick and strong Angels, and bring to rest in Heaven for ever: Christ Jesus our Lord and Saviour was also shadowed out by thousands of burnt offerings of Bullocks, Goats, Lambes and fruits for sin-offerings and peace-offerings in all ages from the beginning of the World before Christs comming, whose bloud and the blould of the paschall Lambe which were
slain by hundred thousands every yeere, was a shadow and a finger of the precious bloud of our glorious Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which willingly offered up himself once for all, whose bloud is a sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the whole World, if they had the grace to lay hold on him by a lively faith, but his death and merits shall save none of them but the faithfull, and condemne the wicked Rebels because Christ was offered, and they would not regard him: Christ our High Priest is entred into Heaven, and maketh daily intercession for us: Now wee need not to offer the bloud of Buls, Goats and Lambs. Now since Christ is risen, this is the Sacrifice God requireth at our hands to have his Laws writ∣ten in our hearts, to obey him, to love him, to honour him with our souls and bodies, in our holy Assemblies, and to keep his Sab∣baths, to give him prayse for his love unto us, to trust in him to pray unto him upon all occasions, to love mercy and to doe right, and justly, and to speak truth out of an honest heart: for the in∣crease of Christs Kingdome of grace upon earth, and for the right of the innocent, poore and fatherlesse children and widdows, and oppressed people, and to pray unto God for all good things, in the name of Jesus Christ, and for his sake alone to forgive us our sins; these sacrifices are more pleasing unto God then thousand rivers of Oile or the bloud of all the cattle on a thousand hils. For now see∣ing Christ Jesus our High Priest is entred into heaven there re∣mayneth no more bloud to be shed for sins, for Christ Jesus the e∣ternall Son of God hath once shed his precious bloud for the sins of all that lay hold on him by a lively faith, and maketh dayly in∣tercession for he is the only Mediatour between God and man, for peace and salvation; for he loves us, and will give eternall life to all that with faith labour to keep his commandements: Christ Jesus our glorious Lord and Saviour is the way to Heaven, hee is the truth and the light, No man can come to the Father but by him, he hath God the Father sealed, and in him stands the covenant and the right to the faithfull which love him, even the Kingdome of Heaven, and all good things which hee sees needfull for them by sure promises of the mighty God which cannot be broken: and if God cast gold and silver, corne, wine and Oile, and government, and the use of all the creatures, upon Turkes, Infidels and
unfaithfull Christians, because hee made them reasonable men: Yet it is not blest unto them without the word of God, and prayer in the name of Christ Jesus, wheresoever Christ hath been preached unto them, for they must give account for government, for their riches, for their honour, for all their wrong and blasphe∣mous words, for all their abused knowledge of conjuring, witch∣craft and for their abuse of their knowledge of sea and land, the Sun, Moon and Stars, and all Gods works of order and mercie, and his providence unto them and the light of their conscience, all these shall witnesse against heathen people, which will not follow the light of conscience, which they have written in their hearts, and give honour thanks, and worship to the great God of heaven and earth that gave them their being but they will wor∣ship vain Idols stocks stones, and dumb creatures kill and de∣voure one another, such heathen people shall be turned into hell with all that forget God: Such Popish Christians as confesse Christ Jesus our Lord and Saviour, to be the onely Sonne of God, and yet if they doe deny him to be the onely mediator between God and man, and pray to Saints departed, and trust to their own merits, and their own righteousnesse and good works, and consi∣der not the Law of God to be holy and pure, so right and strait that no mortall man can wholy keep without the help of Christ Jesus who was God and man, he keepeth Law perfectly, and did good all his life, and was obedient to God his Father, unto the very death: he hath aboundance of grace and good workes, he loveth righteousnesse and hateth iniquity, but mortall man is weak and sinfull. The opening of the Law by our Saviour Christ Iesus in the fifth, sixth and seventh chapters of Saint Matthew's Gospell, shewing mans weaknesse plainly, when we have done all the good we can, we must say we are unprofitable servants we must repent of the ill workes we have done, and desire with teares and sorrow Christ Jesus to wash them away with his precious bloud, and with a lively fayth, desire him to accept of our good works, and to cover them with his good works, and then they will please God, and he will have delight in us; but if Popish Christians hide Gods Word, the bread of life from many milli∣ons of men and women, which for want of true knowledge perish,
and cannot come to drinke of the water of life freely the spirituall stock Christ Jesus as they should doe, this is an evill worke, and if they persecute and murther harmlesse people for their holy and spirituall worshipping of God, which deny their own righteous∣nesse, and desire with teares, faith and joy, to be cloathed with the righteousnesse of Christ Jesus, then this is an evill wicked work also: For Christ Jesus fulfilled the Law of God in every¦thing wholy, for the faithfull men and women which love him, and obey him, for in Christ Jesus the holy Trinity, and blessed unity of God immortall and onely wise is well pleased, and his justice satisfied for the sins of all the faithfull which love him with an upright heart, and God will not give the glory of his spirituall worship of mankinde to Saints or Angels not yet the adoration of her bodies to dumb Images, for God is a jealous God of his glory and true worship, and will visit the sins of all idolaters without repentance, with eternall death and punishment in hell fire. But O England! and all Reformed Churches which have the Word of God to read in, which have faithfull Preachers to preach Christ and amendment of life unto us, which have wholsome and  Books to read in, which have the Lords day kept and mayn∣tayned amongst us, which have the Sacraments the Seals of Christ Jesus love, giving unto us which have godly and needfull Prayers, Confssions, and Thanksgivings appointed and set out in the name of Christ Jesus for to help the weak and confirme the strong, which have had the example of many Martyrs in times of persecutions under Bishops and learned Doctours men and women of all con∣ditions and estates; which have had godly Kings and Queenes, which have bin nursing Fathers and nursng Mothers unto Christ Jesus true Church milnt hereupon earth and have defended the true faith with the Word of God, with the sword of God, and mayntayned true vertue, and punished vice O England! how mrcifull is God unto us? if we will embrace his mercy, and know them  times of his visitation and love unto us: the name of the Lord God of Heaven and earth be praysed, honou∣red, and sanctified for evermore. Which hath sent his mighty Word, the glad tydings of his Gospell unto us, and caused it to be
made more playnly read and preached in our own language; so that men and women need not sit in darknesse, not walk in dark∣nesse, except they suffer their understanding to be blinded with the Devill, and so become wilfull sinners, worse than Turkes, or Po∣pish ignorant Christians, and some wee have which are larger in their opinions then the Word of God, or the Church of God teacheth them, and so cause the Lord to chastize them with tempo∣rall punishment and sin, are too curious and nice, not contented with the wholsome and pure doctrine of Christ Jesus, which is preached in most places; but take offence at every trifle, and som∣time at that which is very good through their ignorance, or else their pride and self-conceitednesse, and so make more divisions and rents then need: these our brethren cause the Lord God to cha∣stize them with temporall punishment also: and some doe what they can to serve the Lord God with an upright heart, and to main∣tayn the true worship of God peaceably, and so of weak and strong the Lord God be praysed: we doubt not, but that wee have hun∣dred thousands of faithfull Christians in these Northwest parts of the World; yea, CHRIST JESUS loving∣ly calleth all men to his Marriage and Noble Banquet, for ever to be betrothed to him in faith and love, here in this world militant to obey him, and to trust unto him, and to receive all things needfull from him, who knows our wants better then we, and after this short life to be spiritually marryed to him in heaven for ever. But alas, unbelieving, ungodly men and women, have out of their foolishnesse desired excuses, they love this world and the vain things thereof, of short continuance, better then everla∣sting Christ Jesus full of all riches and glorious excellent dignity: One hath marryed a wife and cannot come, another hath bought a farme and cannot come, another hath bought oxen and cannot come, poor silly excuses all these things they have received of God for Jesus Christ his sake and they should be helps for them to trust in Christ, who having received good things from him already, but blinde foolish worldlings content themselves so they may have mammon and worldly vanities rather then they will obey Christ Iesus and trust to him for everlasting glorious possessions and so such foolish men and women shall never be married to Christ
which will not believe his word and obey him here, but they shall be divorced from him for ever, and sent to eternall misery, but yet the name of the Lord God of heaven and earth be praised and glorified for his own gracious promise, who hath promised that many shall come from the East and from the West, from the North and from the South, and shall sit down in the Kingdome of heaven with Abraham, Isaack and Iacob, yea, many thou∣sands of men and women are very joyfull, glad and willing to come and prepare themselves with faith and amendment of life, for God hath chosen them, and those whom CHRIST JESUS hath chosen, and giving a lively faith, which worketh by love in him, there shall neither men nor devils be ever able to pull them out of Christ hands for as many as believed in him to them hee gave power to be the Sonnes of God, and Christ Jesus will not lose one of them, but will glorifie them all in their tentations and infirmities, their slips and falls shall not pull them out of Christ Jesus his hands, God the Father gave them to him, and he is stranger then all: and in this world he will make them willing to come to Christ Jesus by faith and re∣pentance.
Of the Joyes of HEAVEN. GOD will give an eternall Kingdome of glory in heaven for ever, where there shall be rest, love, joy, peace, riches, ho∣nour, plenty and great knowledge, health, strength, beauty, and fulnesse of pleasure for evermore; and God will wipe away all teares from their eyes, and place them in blisfull plight in heaven∣ly and glorious Mansions, where we shall behold our glorious, ex∣cellent and mighty God and Father and his eternall love in Iesus Christ shining upon us to our everlasting joy and comfort, and there we shall behold thousand thousand millions of men women and children changed like Angels, shining as bright as the Sun in their Fathers Kingdom all the good works and godly fruits all the Prayers, Humiliations Fastings and Teares which which we have shed for our sins, and for the sins of others; and in prayers for grace for others in obedience to Christ Iesus Commandements, shall be rewarded in Heaven with eternall crownes of glory: all the good works of almesdeeds, charity and love, which wee have done in giving to the poore, and in giving for the increase of Christ Iesus Kingdome of grace here upon earth by our good example shall be rewarded in Heaven with eternall crowns of glory, all the contending and striving for Gods true worship and godly truth, and studying for cuity mercy, true justice and judgment in men that are called thereto,Mal. 3.16. all the good works that men do through faith in obedience to Christ Iesus, shall be rewarded in Heaven with eternall crowns of glory, all that have beene faithfull unto
death will God give a crown of life for ever;Rev, 2.10. Be thou faithfull unto death, and I will give thee a crown of  every mn accord∣ing to his works; all our patient sufferings reproofs slnders for Christ Iesus sake; allour godly meeknesse and peace-making in o∣bedience to Christ Iesus Laws shall be rewarded in Heaven with glorious crowns of hapnesse all the little good works which we have done in obedience to Christ Iesus Lawes through faith and love in Christ Iesus, w make them all well pleasing to God, and he will reward them with exceeding great rewards: never did man imagine, nor his tongue able sufficiently to speak of the joys which God hath prepared for them that love him; there shall all the godly Kings and Qeenes come which have mayntayned Gods true worship, and loved the right; and have peace and rest, and satisfying joys with full content, in beholding the glorious vi∣sion of God Almighty for ever: there shall the godly Priests and Ministers come which have preached Christ Iesus, and his Lawes purely with an upright heart, and shine as bright as the Stars in Heaven: there shall godly Magistrates which have prayed to God, and studied to find out the truth and so proceed in justice or mer∣cy according to Gods Laws; for Christ Iesus sake finde rest and joy for ever, there shall the rich, bountifull men which have clo∣thed Christ poore, miserable and distressed members hereupon earth; and giving meat to them that wanted for Christ Iesus sake, they shall receive treasure in Heaven, plenty for ever, there shall the poore man which hath been patient in his poverty, and prayed to God to supply his wants and trusted in Gods providence, and used the means that God hath appointed, and served God with an upright heart in Heaven, hee shall have rches, plenty and ho∣nour enough; unto that City shall ll faithfull married people come, and chast vertuous single people which have loved Christ Iesus, and his excellent righteousnesse to Heaven, also shall thou∣sands of innocent children come by Gods mercy which knew not their right hand from their left, by the meritorious humble works of Christ Jesus the means to be used, baptizing; and God re∣quireh the faithfull prayers of the parents; yea, many of all Na∣tions shall come from the East, and from the West, and from the
North and from the South; and shall sit downe in the King∣dome of Heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the rest of the Saints in that great and excellent City of our God, the heavenly Jerusalem so large, beautifull and great, that some of the Learned have said, the wombe of the mother is not so strait for the child, in respect of this large World, as is the Kingdome of Heaven in greatnesse and excellency above this World: and others affirme, that some of the Stars are greater then all the earth, the description of the heavenly Jerusalem,Revel. 21.16. in the Revelation of Saint John sayth that it is twelve thousand frlongs long, and twelve thousand furlongs broad, and twelve thousand furlongs high; which maketh fifteen hundred miles every way: yet this place of Scripture doth not deny but that it may be infinite larger. O feare Jerusalem, how fair and beautifull is the City of our God? heaven is his throne, and earth is his footstool heaven is his house wherein are many mansions for dwelling places for the sonnes and daughters of men in pleasure and joy for ever more. There would be much joy among a ship load of men, which at sea were almost drowned with stormes and tempests, in want of all good things should presently come to an Haven where they should have all entertainment with joy and hearty courtesie of the King, Prin∣ces and Nobles of the Country, and have gold and silver, and lands given them for ever: but a thousand times more joy will it be, when the wandring sonnes of men in the sea of this world, have almost been drowned with temptations, the waves of dis∣pair, the rocks of pride, the number of vain desires and worldly lusts, and yet though the love of God and their faith in Jesus Christ shall not be cast away, but shall come to the haven of hea∣ven, where they shall be entertained with all joy, the Lord God himself will entertain them saying Come ye blessed of my Father, receive the Kingdome prepared for you, the heavenly Angels will be very joyfull to see heavie sinfull flesh and bloud to have pased this mortall death and trouble, and now changed so royally, and come to dwell with them in joy for ever, exceeding great joy will there be among the Saints when they shall see one mother there, yea, their deerest friends and acqaintance: O the love, joy and
hearty good will that there will be when wee shall see Abra∣ham, Isaack and Jacob, and all the Prophets and Martyrs, Adam and Evah, and all our ancient predecessors, and our children and successors which have lived godly, and trusted in Jesus Christ; exceeding great joy and comfort will there be when all the Saints from the beginning of the world to the ending of the same are all come together to this heavenly Jerusalem which is above, to see their glorious, excellent, great and beautifull Lord God, and their redeemer and sanctifier, the glorious vision of almighty God, and his love unto them shall give them such joy, that they shall praise him with delight for ever, and love one another most deerly for ever, because they shall all be loved of God, and drinke of the full torrent and ocean of pleasure for ever, the pure river of water of life is there ever flowing, the pleasant tree of life is there ever growing, and yielding alwayes forth pleasant fruit, the gate, and walls of that City of diamonds, pearles, and precious stones,Revel, 21. the houses and streets of that City, more pure then gold; all the cities of this heavenly Jerusalem more glorious then Kings: but into that Citie shall no unclean person come no murderers, nor adulte∣rers nor idolators nor covetous nor thieves, nor enviers of good∣nesse nor slanderers, nor such as love lies, nor carelesse people of Gods true worship, except they be washed clean by faith and re∣pentance in the bloud of Christ Jesus our Lord and Saviour. But O Lord, for Jesus Christ his sake, give us grace to love, fear and honour thy holy name, that we may enter into thy holy Kingdom there to praise thy holy name for ever more Amen.
The pain of losse and suffering. BUt yet, alas, with sorrow I am forced to mourn in this world when I see wicked and ungodly men to run headlong to hel, and destruction: for hell is prepared for wilfull rebellious sinners; assure as Heaven is prepared for faithfull repenting sinners; our Sa∣viour, the Prophets and the Apostles, proves it plainly, the fearfull punishment and torment which our Lord and Saviour Christ Ie∣sus hath foretold shall come to ungodly, unfaithfull, and obstinate sinners, should make them feare and repent, and seeke for mercy, while they are in this world before that fearfull day of judgement to come when there shall be no more mercy for them that would not seeke it in this life, but the foolish worldlings of this world will not repent, The foole hath said in his heart there is no God, the fool hath said that the Al-seeing God doth not see all his bad works, and the evill thoughts of his heart he will not repent; the foole hath denied in his heart Gods power, will and justice; hee thinks God will not rayse up the dead bodies of mankind spiritu∣ally restored in more strength and nimblenesse, the good and faith∣full to be partakers of his mercy in Heaven for ever; and the un∣faithfull, the fearfull, the adulterers, the slanderers, the murderers, the covetous the envious the Idolaters, the unthankfull, the care∣lesse people of Gods true worship, and such like to be punished in hell torments for ever, except they repent and amend their lives, and rn to God for mercy in the name of Christ Iesus his well be∣loved Son and then will Christ Iesus gather them as the Hen ga∣thereth her chickins under her wings, and save them from the wrath of God and from the power and envy of the Devill: and Christ Iesus will wash away their sins in his precious bloud, and
make them as white as snow and wooll, beloved to God for ever: bet if rugodly men will not repent their sins and returne to God for mercy and judge themselves worthy to dye for their sins, then those wofull threatnings and cursins which are written in the word of God must needs fall upon them, Go you cursed into ever∣lasting hell fire prepared for the Devill and his angels, and take the unprofitable servant, and cast him into utter darknesse, where shall be weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth. And againe, take the man which had not on the wedding garment of faith and re∣pentance or the righteousnesse of Christ Iesus, binde him hand and foot and cast him into utter darknesse, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth: It is better for thee to pull out thy right eye, and to cast it from thee, that is thy dearest, darling and best be∣lovedst sins that will offend and displease thee: then having thy sins to be cast into hell fire, where the worme dyeth not, and the fire never goethout. And again, Tophet is prepared of old for ungodly, faithlesse men, the burning of it is great, and the wrath f the Lord like a river of brimstone shall kindle it. And again Hell be∣neath is moved to meet thee, and the wicked people go down to Hell: and all the people that forget God; and God will wound the hoary scalp of him that goeth on in his wickednesse, and upon the ungodly God will rain snares of fire and brimstore, storme and tempest; this is their  to drinke, and tribulations horrour and anguish shall be upon the head of every one that doth evill: Hell is a darke pri∣son large and great, and the wrath of the Lord doth afflict divers torments upon them, besides the pain of losse, whereof commeth the wme of conscience, which grief is as great as the other when they shall remember the losse of Heaven that large, great and glo∣rious place of pleasure and refreshing, which they justly and madly have lost by their greedy sins, and have sold their birth∣right to Heaven for trifles, if they world have trusted in Christ and have loved his laws, and now they know all is gone, because they loved lying vanities and loose behaviour: now all hope is gone for ever too late repentance will doe them no good, at this remembrance grief the worme of conscience will byte them, and they will curse themselves, and curse their wicked acquaintance
which drew them on to sins in this world, and wish that their torment might make an end of them, but that is impossible they must lye in prison for ever: Death gnaweth upon them for ever; the second death of body and soul: so strait was Dives in Hell, that he asked but for a drop of water to coole his tongue, and could not have it, whose fare in this world was delicious, and his drinke of the best wine: also The Lord Iesus will come from Heaven in flaming fire, rendring vengeance to them that obey not his Gospell: and another grief followeth to the damned, God and his Angels, and his Saints shall laugh them to scorne; for in this world they grieved the good spirit of the holy ghost which put Gods thoughts in their hearts, and they gave place to the Devill and his evill mo∣tions, they grieved the good Angels with their sins in this world, and they grieved and vexed the Saints in this world, the godly Ministers that taught them the word of God, wept and prayed for them, they vexed their godly Neighbours and godly friends, which gave them good counsell, and mourned for them in this world: but when the day of judgment came, and when the An∣gell of the covenant hath sworne that that time shall be no more, then the Saints and Angels shall all rejoyce at Gods righteous judgments: For in Heaven is no mourning, although they see their brothers, sisters, fathers, sonnes and acquaintance sent to hell by Gods justice, but they shall say; Just and true are thy judgments, ô Lord God, King of Saints! for their destruction is from them∣selves, they have made themselves the children of the Devill: but while time lasteth in this world, wisdome stretcheth out her hand all the day long, saying, Turne yee from your evill ways, Why will yee die,Prov. 1.20, 21, 22, 23. ô ye sons of men, The Lord desires not the death of a sinner, but that he should turn from his evill ways, and lay fast hold on the promises of his Son Christ Jesus, and if thou wilt turn away from thy evill works, and love all Gods laws with an upright heart, thou shalt surely live, and have all thy sins forgiven thee; for the Lord Iesus suffered most cruell torments, and shed his most precious bloud for those people which are truly humbled be∣fore him, and which do see their sins and confesse them to God, and are weary of them, and desire God for Jesus Christ sake, his
only son to forgive them all, and pray to God for help and grace, to stand in his feare and love to all those people, the Lord Iesus our Seviour hath made most great and precious promises, wherein stands our very life and comfort, and an assured hope of eternall life and salvation, if we take heed unto them, then be not fearfull to obey Christ Jesus commandements, ô doubtfull soul, For he cal∣leth all those that be weary and heavy laden with their sins, and hee will refresh them: and again, Fear not little flock, it is your Fa∣thers will to give you a Kingdome: and again, If the Son of God shall make you free, you shall be free indeed: and again, The houre commeth when all that are in the graves shall heare the voyce of the Son of God, and they shall arise, the good that have done good to the resurrection of life eternall, the bad that have done evill to the re∣surrection of condemnation: and again, I goe the Father to pre∣pare a place for you, that where I am, there you may be also: and a∣gain, I am the living bread which came down from Heaven, if any man eat of this bread with the spirit of faith, he shall live for ever: and again, I am the good shepherd, the good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep, and I give unto them eternall life, and they shall never perish, nether shall any man pluck them out of my hand, the Father which gave them to me is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand: and again, Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you, not as the World giveth, give I unto you: Let not your hearts be troubled, neyther let them be afraid, as my Father hath loved me, so have I loved you, continue you in my love if you keep my commandments, yee shall abide in my love, these things I command you, that you love one another: and Saint Peter sayth, Give all diligence to make your calling and election sure, add to your faith vertue, and to your vertue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godlinesse,2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7. and to godlinesse brotherly kindnesse, and to brotherly kindnesse cha∣rity, for if these things be in you, and abound, they will make you that you shall not be barren nor unfifull in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. But hee that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that hee was purged from his old sins: Wherefore, Brethren, give all diligence
to make your calling and election sure: for if you doe these things yee shall never fall, for so an entrance shall be ministred unto you abundantly into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ; and Saint Paul sayth, That the fruits of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentlenesse, goodness, faith, godly meeknesse, temperance; against such there is no law, the more men have of these graces in faith, in Christ Jesus, the more the holy Ghost doth witnesse unto us our assured hope of eternall salvation; God in mercy will bring also to Heaven many innocent children born within the covenent of grace by the vertue of Christ Iesus meritorious workes; and many men and women of all Nations, whose graces were but few, and their faith but small; If their faith were true, and if they used their small knowledge, or two ta∣lents well, Christ Iesus will have them enter into their Masters joy, yet Christ Iesus sayth. Not every one which , Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven, and many will say in that day unto Christ Iesus, We have done great work in thy name, but he will say unto them,Matth. 7 21, 22. Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, your workes were vain, counterfeit and false; depart from me, I know you not: but, ô Lord for Iesus Christ sake grant us true humble hearts, up∣right before thee, that when the Bridegroome Christ Iesus shall come with thousands of Angels, that wee with the rest of his Church;Matth. 25. the Bride may enter in with him: where wee may behold his most glorious Majesty,Psal. 17. to prayse and magnifie his holy blessed and name for evermore. Amen.
A PRAYER. O Most high and ever-living and everlasting God, beyond all thoughts most high and mighty Lord God, which dwellest in pure brightnesse and excel∣lent Majesty, all glorious in thy selfe, and hast no need of the glory of any of thy creatures, but they receive their glo∣ry and excellent parts from thee: What then are men or women in themselves before thee or the sons of men, that thou shouldst regard them, for they are weak and sinfull? but thou, ô Lord! art holy and mighty, righteous, just and mercifull, and giving unto mankind just and righteous laws which are good for themselves: and thou, ô merci∣full Lord God hast made mercifull, temporall promises unto the sons of men, and keepest them sure and constant, in preserving, the whole World, in keeping it from firing and drowning in restraining the rage and fury of wicked men, and evill spirits that would destroy it, thy mercy is seen, ô Lord! also mightily in sending food and raiment sufficient for the whole World, fit for their habitation: so that if there be any want, it is commonly the cruelty or foo∣lishnesse of man. In mercy, ô Lord! thou sendest Summer and Winter, day and night, Seed-time and Harvest, the ebbing flowing and of the Seas, the fish abiding and com∣ming to severall Countries in their season! thy mercy is seen, ô Lord! in blessing the fowls of the aire, and the beasts of the field unto mankind, the corn, flowers, grasse,
herbs, with the fruits of the trees: so in mercy, ô Lord! thou sendest Gold, Silver, Brasse, Iron, and all metals for the use and benefit of man: Silk from Wormes, Wooll from Sheep, Leather and Furs from beasts great and small, Diamonds and all kind of Pearles from Sea and Land: for the seating of mankind in their severall degrees, not to puff them up with pride, to abuse their brethren, but rather to raise up their thoughts to praise their Creatour, and to de∣sire with humility the grace to serve God here in this world, that they may come to the glorious everlasting place, which God hath prepared for his people, ô Lord God! thou art our Creatour, there is no good to be had but from thee and thy providence: we were nothing, ô Lord God, and thou madest us men and women, we fell from thee, and became worse then nothing: and thou ô holy and blessed Trinity tookst pity on us: and thou, ô mercifull Jesus, becammest a loving and mercifull Saviour unto us, thy mercy, ô glo∣rious and excellent sweet Jesus is more greater in redee∣ming mankind, then any men are Abel: to expresse ô glo∣rious heavenly Father, thou hast made us thy children, thy holy Son Jesus will make us holy: ô holy and blessed spirit, thou sanctifiest thy people, and teachest them the way and the truth: and thou ô blessed spirit makest them strong and valiant to hold out in thy feare, and serves to the end of our lives, ô holy, holy, holy, and blessed Trinity, and Lord God, high and Almighty, to thee be all glory forever. All thy works praise thee, ô Lord God, and magnifie thy holy name for ever: and now, ô most holy and everliving God and most mercifull Father in Jesus Christ, we humbly be∣seech thee for Jesus Christ sake to give us grace to live godly, soberby, lovingly, and zealous of Gods true worship,
and glory. And grant, ô Lord! for Jesus Christ sake that wee may bring forth godly and charitable fruit in Christ Jesus; to the honour and glory of thy name: and make us, ô Lord, for Jesus Christ truly thankfull unto thee, for the free and true preaching of thy word in all these North-west parts of the World. And wee beseech thee, ô Lord God, for Jesus Christ sake, in thy goodtime, to send againe thy true, plain and lively word to be preached, to be believed and mayntained in the other parts of the World, that they and we may at the last through thy exceeding great and wonderfull mercy in Jesus Christ, come to thy Kingdom to praise thy Name with joy for evermore: Amen. All glory, praise and thanks be given unto thee, ô eternall, and everliving Almighty Lord God, both now and for evermore, World without end. Amen. FINIS.
