THE TREE OF GOOD AND EVILL: OR A Profitable and Familiar Exposition of the Commandements, directing vs in the whole course of our life, according to the Rule of Gods Word, whereby we must bee iudged at the last day. By THOMSS GRANGER Preacher of Gods Word. DEVT. 30. 19. I call heauen and earth to record this day against you, that I haue set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore chuse life that both thou and thy seed may liue. LONDON, Printed by N. O. for SAMVEL MAN, and are to bee sold at his Shop in Pauls Church-yard at the Signe of the Ball. 1616.
TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL SIR IOHN LEVENTHORP, KNIGHT, and to the most wise and vertuous Lady IOANE his wife, Grace and Peace from God the Father, and our Lord Iesus Christ, bee multiplied. MANY causes there were (Right Worshipfull) that mo∣ued mee to penne this Ex∣position on the Comman∣dements, but especially these following. The first cause was, the hindering at least of Satans busie working, euen in our reformed Church, who as in the times of darknesse hee murthered mul∣titudes of soules through Idolatrous Deuotions, and the false imagination of
meritorious workes: euen so doth hee now in the cleere light of the Gospell, slay a great number through a liuelesse faith, and outward empty profession: Yet in both times hath there been a cer∣taine number, whose workes were faith∣full, and whose faith is fruitfull: There∣fore to the end that they who through selfe-loue, and ignorance of Gods lawes seeme to bee somewhat, may see what sinnes they daily commit, and what ver∣tues they continually omit, that they (I say) who seeme to themselues beautifull and rich enough, may see themselues to bee but wretched, miserable, poore, blind, and naked, Reu. 3. 17. For their be∣nefite and good, I first attempted this short Treatise. A second reason was, because I saw very many, yet so ignorant, as that they thinke they can keepe the whole Law, grossely, and Pharisaically, examining themselues by the outward letter of the tenne Words, or Commandements, euen which notwithstanding they make small conscience continually to breake,
because God is mercifull: so that with them, as with carnall Gospellers, the commandements are quite growne out of request. A third reason like to this was, be∣cause that many euen on their death∣beds, doe comfort themselues onely in their owne righteousnesse, which stan∣deth in this, that they haue alwaies paid euery man his owne; That they neuer hurt their neighbour by word or deed; That they haue euer carryed a good meaning whatsoeuer they said, or did; That they haue giuen almes to the poore, whereupon some, being exhor∣ted by their Minister to repent, and to call vpon God for mercy in Iesus Christ, haue answered, that they knew no sinne they had. Others againe, being more then wontedly sick, haue maruelled that God should so vndeseruedly punish them. A fourth reason was, because that ma∣ny not willing to buy a larger Expositi∣on, partly for the cost, partly for the length thereof (as they thinke, who are
cumbred with Martha about many things) might bee induced, and allured to buy, and reade this short Exposition, both for the little price, for the plaine∣nesse, and for the many proofes, and bre∣uitie thereof. A fifth reason was, that children and yong folkes, hauing learned by heart the Principles of Christian Religion, might be instructed further in the Law, which is the end of vertuous and godly life, both that they may vnderstand Sermons the better, when they heare that whereof they haue already a fundamentall know∣ledge (which must needes stirre vp in them, a desire to heare and know further therein, whereof commeth dilligent at∣tention) and also, that knowing when they do well, and when they do ill, not onely in deed, but in word and thought, they may bee brought to make consci∣ence of euery sinne, which the ignorant cannot do; that their mindes and con∣sciences being possessed with the lawes of God in euery particular, in their yong age, the head of sinne may be sup∣pressed,
and kept vnder; that they may truely repent of their sinnes, which they that know not sinne, cannot do; and that they may know to what commandement euery vertue and sinne is referred. And lastly, the reasons why I was bold to offer so small a present to your Wor∣ship, of whom I haue receiued so many kindnesses, and am indeed for sundry respects for euer obliged vnto you, are. First because I haue alwaies knowne you to be a sincere louer of learning, simply for it selfe without by-respects, which plainely appeareth in this; that you haue not onely beene alwaies a speciall fauo∣rer and Patron of the learned, but also separating your selfe from the world, as much as your place and calling will per∣mit, haue euer deuoted your selfe to all good learning. Moreouer the inward and sincere loue and affection in the Lord, that I haue alwaies heeretofore, at this present, and euer shall beare vnto you, and your good Lady, for these ex∣cellent and most amiable vertues, wise∣dome, truth, vprightnesse, kindnesse,
compassion tender-heartednesse, haue enforced mee to shew forth my hid and smothered loue, wherein I am able, and wherein it could finde passage: There∣fore I desire your Worships both in one, whom coniugall and Christian loue, and vnanimity, haue made one, to accept this little gift, which I am bold to cast into the treasury of Gods Church, vnder your Worships protection. The Lord continue still his fauoura∣ble kindnesse, goodnesse, and mercy to∣wards you, in powring downe still his manifold blessings vpon your ancient and honoured Family, from generation to generation for euer: Botterwike in Holland neere Bosten in Lincoln. 1616. Your Worships In all duties to command. THOMAS GRANGER.
To the Reader. COurteous Reader, the Lord forbad our first Parents to eate of the Tree of Know∣ledge of good and euill with denunciation of an euerla∣sting curse vpon their disobedience. Againe, the same Lord commandeth vs to eate of the Tree of good, and euill, as a prepara∣tiue to an euerlasting and perfect remedy: For as the eating thereof was the begin∣ning of all euill, so the eating thereof is the beginning of all good. For as the desire of the knowledge of good and euill brought ignorance, and death, euen so the know∣ledge of good and euill maketh wise vnto life. But heerein wee shew out of what root wee are growne, and out of what rocke wee are hewne, namely, to be alwaies against the Lord. For as our first parents being forbid∣den to eate of that one Tree, did first of all eate of that Tree; so wee being commanded
to eate of this one Tree of the Garden with promise of blessing, had rather eate of any other Tree of the Forrest, though the fruits thereof be present death: which obseruation of our froward hearts caused the Heathen Poet to say, Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupi∣musque negata. Englished thus: To things forbidden wee chiefly doe aspire. And things denyed wee most of all desire. Now seeing that the onely good and wise God hath turned this curse into a bles∣sing that both the knowledge of our sinne and misery, and also of perfect holinesse and righteousnesse should come by the Law, that so working guilt of sinne, feare of iudge∣ment, and vtter despaire of life in the con∣science, wee might bee inforced to flie to Christ for succour and reliefe in this di∣stressed estate, and that being in Christ, the sting of death which is sin, and the strength of sinne which is the rigour of the Law îs abolished, and is become the rule of Christi∣an
life, and a Tree of life to them that eate thereof; seeing I say, it is thus, let vs desire to eate of this Tree, for the fruites thereof are not grieuous; yea, they are pleasant, de∣lightfull, and more sweet then hony and the hony combe, to the sanctified taste, reuiuing, and quickning the soule to eternall life. For these causes did the Lord so strictly charge the Israelites to exercise themselues in his Lawes continually: And that they might haue them in perfect remembrance aboue all things, hee commandeth them to rehearse them continually to their children, to write them vpon the posts of their houses, and vpon their gates, Deut. 11. 18. 19. and to weare fringes couered with a riband of blew silke on the borders of their garments for the same end, Numb. 18. 9. that in all things, in all places, and at all times, they might, as an holy and peculiar people do the will of God, and not their owne lusts as the Gentiles do, Deut. 26. 17. 18. 19. Now although these, and such like cere∣monies be abolished, yet the Law is euerla∣sting, and giueth no more liberty of sinning to vs, then vnto them; yea hauing receiued
greater measure of the Spirit of Adoption, wee should more ioyfully and cheerefully performe all obedience, then they that had but the spirit of bondage, viz. who like children were held in awe with temporall threatnings, and sharper outward punish∣ments: Let vs therefore which haue recei∣ued the promises (which they saw a farre of) freely without constraint, ingenuously and willingly as adopted sons reade, heare, talke, and meditate in the Law continually, and in steed of Iewish fringes, ribands, and Phylacteries, fitter for children then men of perfect age, let vs carry the Law ingrauen in the fleshy tables of our hearts. And because the Law maketh but shal∣low impression in our stony hearts, and is therefore quickly defaced, and worne out with the rust of corruption, wee haue need of daily meanes to cleanse, purge, and correct those furring vessels, and so much the more because wee haue also corrupters and temp∣ters without vs and about vs, the world and the deuill that old deceitfull cauiller withdrawing and mis-leading vs in euery action and thought of the mind, from the
will of God to their owne lusts. Now for thy more distinct knowledge, and more spirituall and true vnderstan∣ding of the Law, for thy better direction in all matters, and for thy furtherance in godlinesse and vertue in these latter euill daies, wherein that wicked one, 1. Ioh. 2. 14. so wonderfully hardneth the hearts of most men, 2. Tim. 3. 1. I haue drawne an Expo∣sition of the Commandements, in such a forme and order, with such breuity and ful∣nesse, and with so many & manifest proofes, as that any man, learned or vnlearned, may reape great benefite thereby. And seeing that it is easie for the price, waighty for the matter, and light for the carriage, either in pocket, or in thy bosome, or in thy handes: thinke it I pray thee no more trouble to thee then Fringes and Phy∣lacteries Mat. 23. 5. were to the Iewes, then Crosses and Crucifixes to the Papists, who think hereby to scarre away deuils, whereas indeed the deuils know where to take vp their Iunes and Lodgings by these whorish tokens & markes. Contrarily, here thou hast God speaking plainely to thee, and louingly
instructing thee, and informing thee as a father doth his sonne. Thou hast heere a powerfull weapon, euen the voyce of God, to scarre away deuils, and to reproue the wic∣ked in all their vniust dealings: Whatso∣euer men say, iudge, or do, and howsoeuer the world swaggeth and reeleth, as the spirit of the aire that worketh in the children of disobedience hales it from iniquity to iniqui∣ty: Heere thou hast a firme Foundation and vnmoueable Rocke; cleaue to this Rocke con∣fidently, and build therevpon without wa∣uering, so shalt thou abide for euer, 1. Ioh. 2. 17. when others with their wisedomes shall come to naught, 1. Cor. 2. 6. and with their vnfruitfull workes of darkenesse shall perish euerlastingly: For they that haue done good, as the Law of God informeth them, shall go into life euerlasting, and they that haue done euill shall go into euerlasting fire. Thine in the Lord, T. G.
To the Christian Reader Grace and Peace. GOOD Reader, thou hast heere a small Treatise, penned by a learned Diuine, wherein is plainely laid downe the sense and meaning of euery Com∣mandement, both in the Negatiue and Affirmatiue part, as well of Graces com∣manded, as of sinnes forbidden, confirmed with many pregnant proofes of Scripture, wherein much is expressed in few words: Which Treatise I haue pervsed, and doe esteeme it very profitable, especially for the vnlearned which desire knowledge, and the rather because I know none that hath ope∣ned the Commandements so fully in this manner. I commend it to thy diligent rea∣ding,
continuall remembrance, and care∣full practise, and thee to the Grace of God, and to his fauour in Christ, Thine in the Lord, Neuill Drant.
A Profitable and Familiar Exposition of the Com∣mandements. THE FIRST COMMANDEMENT. Thou shalt haue none other Gods but mee. THe occasion of this Comman∣dement is our lusting after false Gods.

THe occasion of the second Commande∣ment is our aptnesse to carnall worship,
whereby we falsely imagine that wee can de∣uise a right manner of worship to God. The worship of God is either inward in minde, or outward in body, Ioh. 4. 23. chap. 9. 38.

Vnprofitable Preaching, which is by séeking vaine-glorie and flattering. 1. Cor. 1. 18. 1. Cor. 2. 1. Lam. 2. 14. XIII. Contempt, or refusing to heare the Word, Ier. 11. 10. Ier. 11. 8. 1. Ioh. 4. 6. XIIII. Vnprofitable hearing, which commeth, 1 For lacke of preparation, Eccles. 4. 17. 2 Through vnbeleefe, Heb. 4. 2. 3 Through coldnesse of affection, and an earthly heart, which may be called dead-hear∣tednesse, Reu. 3. 15. 16. & ver. 1. 4 Through forgetfulnesse, Iam. 1. 22, &c.

Fearefull swearing by the names and properties of God.
XIII. Vaine and idle swearing among ignorant people, Math. 5. 33. 34. Iam. 5. 12. XIIII. Superstitious swearing, Iosh. 23. 7. Zeph. 1. 5. Ier. 5. 7. XV.

Vaine and wicked Lots casting. Prou. 16. 33. Actes 1. 26. XIX. Mocking, ieasting, and speaking vn∣reuerently of the workes of God. XX. Superstition. Vertues commanded.

Gal. 4. 18. Fiue signes of true Zeale. 1 It beginnes at our selues. 2 It is suspitious of our owne secret euils. 3 It is constant, not hote by fits. 4 It causeth vs to reioyce in the prospe∣rity of the Church, though our selues bee in affliction. 5 It is earnest in matters of godlinesse, but cold in worldly things. Seuenthly, Sanctification of Gods gifts and ordinances; they are sanctified by two meanes. 1 By the Word, that teacheth the holy and right vse of them, Psal. 119. 24. 2 By prayer, whereby wee obtaine the assistance of Gods grace to vse them rightly: and whereby we magnifie and blesse God for giuing them to vs, and giuing vs grace to glorifie him in them.
The fourth Commandement. Remember that thou keepe holy the Sa∣both day: Sixe daies thou shalt la∣bour, and do all that thou hast to do; But the seuenth day is the Sabaoth of the Lord thy God; In it thou shalt do no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-seruant, and thy maid-seruant, thy cattell, and the stranger that is within thy gates: For in sixe daies the Lord made hea∣uen and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seuenth day; Wherefore the Lord blessed the seuenth day and hallowed it. THe occasion of this Commandement, is our readinesse to fall away from God, vnlesse daily meanes bee vsed. Vertues commanded.

on the Saboaths morning, Exod. 32. 6. Ex. 19. 14. 15. Secondly, preparation of mind, by fréeing it from worldly thoughts and cares.

Fifthly, Sanctification of the Saboath, that is, the separating of it to Gods worship onely, as the second commandement requi∣reth, Esay 58. 13. Sixthly, visiting of the sicke. Seuenthly, relieuing of the poore, 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2. Neh. 8. 12. Eightly, instruction of our Families, Deut. 11. 19.

A Prayer for any priuate Person. MOST mighty God, and in Iesus Christ my most louing Father, and mercifull Sauiour, I being one of the meanest of thy ser∣uants, and vnworthy of the least of all thy mercies, do ac∣knowledge and confesse thy great goodnesse and bounty towards mee, in that thou hast from my birth till this present, powerfully preserued mee, graciously susteyned mee, and mercifully prouided all things needfull for my soule and body, as well as for thy deerest children. Thou mightst haue made mee a ser∣pent, hatefull and loathsome to all thy crea∣tures. Thou mightst haue vtterly taken from mee the spirit of wisedome, vnderstanding,
and knowledge, and giuen me vp into a repro∣bate minde, and into a foolish and corrupt iudgement, to hate the truth and to beleeue lies. Thou mightst haue taken from me health, strength, and soundnesse of body, and conti∣nually haue tormented mee with paines, sicke∣nesses, and diseases, and haue fastened all the sharpe arrowes of thy wrathfull indignation in my head, heart, liuer, lungs, and other mem∣bers of my body: Thou mightst haue depri∣ued me of all the meanes of necessary mainte∣nance, and made mee a common reproach and by-word to the most abiect and basest people; Yea, thou mightst with-draw thy presence from mee, and cause the fretting worme of feare, and despaire, to gnaw on my heart day and night, giuing mee my portion heere with the wicked, and after death with the damned in hell for euermore. But (louing Fathert) y mercy hath beene endlesse towards mee a wretched sinner, thou hast not with-drawne thy louing kindnesse from mee, but alwaies comforted, and refreshed mee both in soule and body, with all things needfull; thou hast reioyced my heart with the riches of thy grace; thou hast measurably corrected mee, louingly instructed mee, and plentifully offe∣red the meanes of saluation vnto mee. And now, most gracious God, least I forget those fearefull iudgements oft-time inflicted on thy
deerest children, and despise these heauenly graces, and tender mercies, through the de∣ceitfulnesse of sinne, sathan, and this euill world, thou that openest mine eyes from bo∣dily sleepe of the night, open I beseech thee also the eyes of my minde, enlighten me with the sauing knowledge of thee, thy blessed will and holy waies, that I sleepe not in death, lighten the heauinesse of my wordly heart, waken the drowsinesse of my dul & dead spirit, reforme and set in order my sensuall and earth∣ly affections, take from me this hardnesse of heart, rebellion of will, foolish thoughts, vaine imaginations, selfe-loue, pride, froward∣nesse; take from me the way of lying, dissem∣bling, double-dealing, treachery, flattery, worldly craftinesse, and all vnlawfull getting. Conuert, ô Lord, and strengthen my vn∣beleeuing, fearefull, and distrustfull heart, that trusting in thee the liuing God, and rely∣ing wholly on thy gracious prouidence in the lawfull vse of such meanes as thou daily offe∣rest to mee, I may escape the snares of the de∣uill, and auoid a sea of euils, whereinto the men of this world doe plunge themselues to eternall perdition. O Lord incline my heart to thy Word, and not to couetousnesse, cause mee to valew the worth thereof aboue gold and siluer, and to humble my selfe to my Spiri∣tuall Pastors and Teachers, whom thou hast
sent to call mee out of the darkenesse of this world into thy maruellous light. Giue mee power and strength to redresse my waies ac∣cording to thy Word, and let not those com∣mon sinnes of presumption, and carnall secu∣rity get the dominion ouer mee: Inable mee in some good measure to discerne the spirits of men, and the vaine fashion of this transitory world, that I turne not aside with the multi∣tude to do euill, but that I may delight in the Saints heere on earth, and such as excell in vertue. And whereas Satan and his instruments are enemies to Christian loue and fellowship, giue me wisedome, strength, and constancie, that I neither giue offence vnto them, whereby they should withdraw themselues from my compa∣ny, neither yet take offence at their infirmi∣ties and imperfections, that I should with∣draw my affections from them, to sort my selfe with such as know not thee, feare not thee, and condemne the generation of thy children. Giue me grace to walke warily in these latter euill daies; preserue my going out and comming in this day and euermore, and send thy good Angell to guide and protect mee in all my waies. And as, ô Lord, I grow elder in yeares, and euery day draw neerer to my graue; so grant that I may grow in know∣ledge, faith, hope, loue and all vertue, that
when it shall please thee to call me to giue vp an account of my Stewardship, I may enter into thine euerlasting ioy. Vouchsafe, ô Lord, to bestow and encrease these graces in me, for thy deerely beloued Sons sake, Christ Iesus my Sauiour, in whom onely thou art well pleased, to whom with Thee, and the holy Spirit, bee giuen all honour, glory, praise, and thankes∣giuing, now and for euer. Thankes-giuing before Meate. VVEe thank thée, O heauenly Father, for all thy mercies, and blessings heretofore bestowed vpon vs, and still con∣tinued and renewed vnto vs, and especially at this time for these thy good creatures, that of thine owne goodnesse and bounty thou hast ordained and prouided for the mainte∣nance of our bodies, giue them vertue and power to nourish vs, that thereby our strengths being renued, wee may bee made the more fit and able to serue thee in the du∣ties of our Callings, to thy honour and glo∣rie, and to the comfort of our owne soules and consciences, through Iesus Christ our Lord: Amen.
Thankes-giuing after Meate. THe God of all glory, and power, who hath created, redéemed, and presently ed vs, hee blessed and praised, now and for euermore, Amen. God preserue his Church, our King, his Realmes and Dominions, increase in vs a true and liuely faith, continuall peace of consci∣ence, and the comfortable ioy of the Holy Ghost, through Iesus Christ our Lord, Amen.
