BY THE SVPREAME COVNCELL OF THE CONFEDERATE CATHOLICQVES OF IRELAND VVEE the supreame Councell of the said Confederate Catholickes, hauing of a long tyme, with dee∣pe sense of the sufferings of the people, and the wayes taken to heape miseries on this afflicted. Kingdome, beene equally distracted betweene the care wee were oblidged to haue taken of the safetie and wel∣fare of the Confederate Catholickes, and the respect which was due from vs, and hath beene aboundantly ex∣pressed by vs to the Lord Archbishopp of Firmo, his Hollynes extraordinary Nuntio in Ireland, wee finding his Grace (by the suggestions of a few persons, for their priuate ends averse to subiection, and disaffected to any meane, by which a settlement (how advantagious and secure soeuer for Catholick Religion) might be intro∣duced) to insist on such wayes as may bring evident destruction vpon this Nation; when neither by reason or earnest sollicitation, wee could diuert such proceedings, wee are at leinght enforced to admonish the Con∣federate Catholickes (Whose lyues and fortunes are entrusted with vs) that henceforth by any such groundles pretentions and suggestions, or any act grounded there, vpon, they be not withdrawen from that obedience they owe vnto our Commaundes, least they should expose themselues to that confusion, and the Kingdome, to that distraction, wich might be fatall vnto both. The Coppy of a late declaration against the Cessation, made by a few Bisshopps conuened before his Grace, and opposed by others of them, of exemplar life and emin∣ent learning, (albeit submitting in obedience to the Maior vote of that meeting they subscribed thereunto) this day affixed by order of the lord Nuntio, the Lord Bishopp of Clogher, the Lord Bishopp of Rosse, and the Lord Bishopp of Cork, hath draweu vs (much against our will) by this our publique declaration to vindi∣cate the honor of the Kingdome, and betymes to forewarne the Confederate Catholickes, of the mischeefes wich may be fall them, since now wee play nely see, that contrary to his Hollynes pious affections, for the propa∣gation of the Catholick Religion, the obseruance of due allegeance to his Majestie, and the preseruation of vnion among the Confederate Catholickes (these being the scope of the Lord Nuntio his mission,) all wayes are attempted to introduce the miserie of distraction vppon vs, otherwise it could not be, that vse should now bee made of that declaration, after wee had, in concluding the articles of that Cessation, fully prouided for the free exercise of our Religion and Function, and the possessions of our Cleargie, and after the Lord Nuntio had sent vnto vs, by Patrick Bryan and Geffrey Barron Esquiers, (as a meane to make the Cessation conscionable) propositions meerely Temporall, Whereunto Wee haue giuen ample satisfaction, as by the said propositions and answeares now printed may appeare. Now therefore, that Wee see noe end of the afflictions, vnder which the people doe groane, Wee doe protest, that Wee may not giue Way to haue the Gouernment of the Kingdome entrusted With vs, cast downe, and throd vpon, nor permitt that all affayres, of what nature soever, shall (in ordine ad spiritualia) deuolue to a Spirituall tribunall, which must follow, if wee may not (without lycence first had) either conclude Cessation, regulate Armyes, nominate Officers, appoint Commissioners, or dispose of places of trust in the Ciuill list. And having resolued to represent vnto his Hollynes our condition, and humbly to begg, (as wee doe hereby) that he would be pleased to giue remedie vnto these distractions (in which wee find ourselues inuolued) by assuming vnto himselfe the judgment of the matter of Conscience, pretended in the transactions of this Cessation, as the most powerfull, pro∣per, and indifferent Iudge, to whose sacred throne, in the behalfe of the said Confederate Catholickes, wee doe therein appeale, Wee doe premonish all and every the Consederat Catholickes, that nothing proceeding from the Lord Nuntio, vpon this or the like subiect, doe lessen the obedience, wich by oath, and otherwise they are oblidged to beare vnto our Comaunds. Giuen at Kilkenny the 27 day of May 1648. Mountgarett, Athunry, Alex:Mac. Donnell, Lucas Dillon, Rob. Linch, Phelim o Neil, Richard Bellings, Gerrald▪ Fennell, Patrick Brian, Robert Deuereux.
