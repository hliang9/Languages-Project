THE PREFACE. 'TIS not barely my Obligation to Cu∣stom, that has prevail'd with me to present the courteous Reader with a Preface to the following Essay, but rather the necessity and usefulness thereof in a Work of this nature, that he might not be surpriz'd, when, after having read the Title, he should fall foul upon what is promised therein, without any Instructions so to do. In the first place therefore, I desire the Rea∣der to take notice of the Method. I. Of its Division into three Heads. The first, Of Common Names. The second, Of such Proper Names as are of a German Original. The third, Of Proper Names derived from the Latin, Greek, or Hebrew, with their signi∣fication. All done by way of Alphabet; so that any Word desired, may be quickly found.
II. Observe that all along, through the Book, that Word is set next the English, from which I have judged it most likely to be derived; and the Synonymous Words of the other European Languages follow: Which shews, I have left it to the Opinion of the Reader, to draw it from which he pleases. Moreover, by a curious reading here∣of, any of the European Languages may be indif∣ferently well learned. III. Note, that very many of the Words being of a British or Saxon Original, have their Ex∣plication set down. The chief Reason why I busied my self here∣in, was, to save my Time from being worse em∣ployed: And, I did imagine (as, questionless, these most indefatigable and ingenious Persons did, viz. Kilian, Vossius, Salmasius, Martinius, Spelman, Bochart, Junius, Menagius and Skin∣ner, from whom I took my Pattern) I could not spend it more commendably, or profitably, than in searching into the Original of my Na∣tive Language; which is so strangely corrupted through Time, that when I look'd an hundred, or an hundred and fifty Years only behind me, I could scarce imagine it ever to have been the Language of my Ancestors, or even of the Coun∣try I was born in, 'tis so chang'd through Com∣merce,
Correspondence, Travellers, and such like Accidents: Much more may you imagine it to be alter'd in a thousand, or two thousand Years, by Conquests, Invasions, Transmigra∣tions of Government, &c. which have been very frequent over, and in this Isle, above others: So that though this my native Country might, at its first Settlement, have a Language peculiar to it self; yet, as is said before, by Conquest, Commerce, Travelling, Transmigra∣tions of the Government, &c. it is brought to what we now find it, even a Composition of most, if not all the Languages of Europe; especially of the Belgick or Low-Dutch, Saxon, Teuto∣nick or High-Dutch, Cambro-British or Welsh, French, Spanish, Italian, and Latin; and now and then of the Old and Modern Danish, and Ancient High-Dutch; also of the Greek, He∣brew, Arabick, Chaldee, Syriack and Turcick. But I have forbore, as much as possible, the setting down such as are purely of a Latin Ori∣ginal, lest the Book should exceed the quantity of Sheets design'd, and so possibly the Price of the Buyer; it having been the only Fault of those that have hitherto writ upon this Subject, to be both voluminous, high-pric'd, and in Latin; so that many Well-wishers to their Mother-Tongue could neither reach the Value nor Knowledge thereof: All which I hope I have remedied, by
doing this in English, and in a small Volume, fitted to a small Price. I have (that the Reader might not be at a loss in such Words as are purely from the Latin) prefix'd a few easie Rules, whereby ma∣ny thousand English Words coming therefrom may most easily be known, and made Latin again, usual∣ly, by the Addition, Cutting off, or Changing of a Letter The Confusion of Languages at Babel (for before it, all the then World spoke one and the same Dialect, supposed to be Hebrew) gave Rise to all the several Languages in the Ʋni∣verse; of which, the primitive Language of this Nation was one; and, had it not been corrupted, perhaps as good and intelligible as the best; but being so alter'd by the aforesaid Accidents, it has quite lost its primitive Glo∣ry, as well as that of the French, and other Nations. It may be justly wonder'd at, why we have no more Words than we have from the Old British, now the Welsh (which, no doubt, was the Primitive Language of this Nation:) But if we again consider how imperiously the Saxons enter'd and subdued this Land, our Wonder will in a great measure abate; for they did not,
as Conquerors usually do, mix the Britains with themselves, after they had yielded to, or were not any ways able to resist the Conqueror; but put all to the Sword that they met withal; on∣ly some few, to shelter themselves from their Rage, betook themselves to the Mountains of Wales and Cornwall; which being inaccessable to the Conquerors, for want of use, were suf∣ficient Security to the distressed Britains, against them; which Quarter they do still live in, and retain their own Language, for the most part, within themselves, as if they were another Na∣tion; only by Commerce and Intercourse, there has happen'd some Commutation of Language like∣wise. So that our Language, in the main, is composed of the Old English-Saxon, Dutch and Normandy-French; but of the first principally, for that the last did only in part subdue, not destroy this Nation, which the former did endea∣vour, and almost effect. I might have added the Italian, because of its Affinity to the French; as also because of the great and frequent Communication there was, in former Times, between England and Italy, when this Nation was subject to the Pope of Rome: For then all Ecclesiastical Controversies, Confirmations of Priests, Abbots and Bishops, in their several Benefices, were to be solemnized and ratified by Rome's spi∣ritual
Trader, the Pope: And, on the other hand, the Pope sent hither many of his Crea∣tures, Italians, for the better collecting of his Peter's Pence; as also for their Preferment to Bishopricks, Vicarages, &c. Though the Danes did, in some part sub∣due England, yet we are little beholding to them for the Corruption we now labour under, except it be in the North and West of England; which they subdued almost two hundred Years before the rest of the Nation came in to their Obedience; and when they had it, they did not possess it above forty Years before the Normans disturb'd them in their Enjoyments. In a Word, All Words almost (except such as come from the French and Latin, with their Ad∣herents) owe their Original to the English-Saxon and Low-Dutch, Dialects of the ancient Ger∣man; for Spain did very little contribute there∣to, except that some few Words have crept in by Commerce, which are only useful to such as trade thither. Now, lest any one, more ignorant, should not be perswaded of the vast Alterations, and sometimes total Changes that have been made in our Language, since this Isle was first discover'd, let him read some of our
Chronicles of England, and he will be con∣vinc'd of the necessity thereof; for the Saxons did endeavour the total Destruction of the Inhabitants, and did effect it, saving some few that fled to the Mountains of Wales and Cornwall, as is said before: And then is it not reasonable to conjecture, that the Language, the Ancient British (save what was preserv'd as before, who, by a Law of the Conqueror, were prohibited Intercourse with the Saxons) must die with the People; and a new one, namely the Saxon, be introduced in its stead? I have many things to alledge in defence of the Weakness and Inequality of this Perfor∣mance; as namely, its being collected at di∣vers times, and in haste, because of my other more necessary Business; as also, its being prin∣ted from a foul Copy, and the like; which first may have alter'd the Style, and the two last let many things pass Muster, which, upon more mature deliberation, would not: But I hope the discreet Reader will pass by such Failures, without carping at them (as considering that no Man is infallible;) and as for the Igno∣rant and Envious, I value not their Censures; but, with Martial, In invidum, count them un∣fit for Humane Society.
Qui ducis vultus, & non legis ista libenter, Omnibus invideas, invide; nemo tibi. I have nothing more to beg, but the kind Reader's Charity for the Faults of the Press, which, I hope, may consist chiefly in Literals, and so may be the more easily mended with a Pen; and that he would not be offended at the unpleasantness of the Style, but rather consider what the Subject will bear.
Rules whereby to know when a Word is derived from the Latin, and how it may be made Latin again; composed to prevent the Book's growing to too great a Bulk. 1. MOst Words in English, ending in nee, or cy, are derived from the Latin, ending in tia; as, Temperantia, Clementia; Tem∣perance, Clemency, &c. 2. Words ending in ion in English, are made Latin by casting away n; as, Question, Quaestio; Religion, Religio, &c. 3. Words ending in ty, are made Latin, by changing ty into tas; as, Liberty, Libertas; Charity, Charitas, &c. 4. Words ending in ude, are derived from the Latin, by changing o into e; as, Fortitude, For∣titudo; Gratitude, Gratitudo, &c. 5. Words ending in d, denoting the order or manner of a thing, the said Words being Ad∣jectives, are made Latin, by adding us; as Ri∣gid, Putrid; Rigidus, Putridus, &c.
6. Words having t, n, or r, in the end, be∣tween two Vowels, are made Latin, by changing the last Vowel into us, being Adjectives; as, Mute, Obscene, Obscure; Mutus, Obscoenus, Ob∣scurus. 7. Most Words ending in nt, are made Latin, by changing nt into ns; as, Latent, Latens; Vigilant, Vigilans, &c. 8. Many English Words ending in al, by ad∣ding is, are made Latin Adjectives; as, Liberal, Liberalis; Substantial, Substantialis, &c.

THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE English Tongue. A A, is a Vowel that is often superfluous in the be∣ginning of words; as in Arise, abide, abate, &c. Abaisance; which we falsly write Obeisance, as if it came from the French Obeisance, when really it comes from Abbaisser, which signifies, to depress, or make an humble inclination of the body; as we do, when we do Abaisance. Abandon, from the French A∣bandonner, or the Ital. Aban∣donare; if it may not better, and likelier be drawn from the Anglo-saxonick Abannan, that is, publickly to dis-inhe∣rit: Or, which is most likely, from our own word Bann, or the Belgick Bannen, that is, to lie under a Curse, the A Otiosa, or superfluous, being added. Abase, from the Fr. Abbaisser, the Ital. Abbassare, or the Span. Abaxar; to lessen, to keep under. Abash, from the Fr. Esbahir, to affrighten; which comes from the Lat. Expaveo: lt be not likelier from the Spanish Abaxar, to keep under; be∣cause Inferiours are usually abash'd, when suddainly ac∣costed by Superiors. Abate, from the Fr. Abbattre, abatre, the Ital. Abattere, or the Spanish Abatir; which in one sence, signifie, to beat down; in another, to sub∣stract, as in Arithmetick. The reverend Dr. Honywood de∣rives it from the Privative A,
and the Belgick Baete; which signifies Profit, or Interest; because by diminishing a thing, it becomes less profitable. Let the Curious judge, which is best to follow. Abbot, Anglo-saxonick Abbud, abbod, and abbad, Belg. Abd, abt, Teutonick Abt, Fr. Abbe, Ital. Abbate, Spanish Abad, Lat. Abbas. It may seem to be deduced from the Heb. Ab, or Syr. Abba, Father; which an Abbot properly is: But, to be sure, we have it, by a small corruption, from the English-Saxon Abbod, which signifies the same. Abbridge, from the Fr. Abbre∣ger, and that from the Lat. Abbreviare, to curtail, or make shorter. Abet, which, I think, may not incommodiously come from the Lat. Praep. Ad to, and bet; which, in composition, signi∣fies, to stand by one, or bet on ones side; and therefore should seem to be right spell'd Abbet; If it may not be de∣duced from a priv. and the Belg. Barten, to profit. Abide, from the AS. Abidan, Bidan, Belg. Beyden, Ital. Badare, to subsist, stay, or tarry; which may all of them, perhaps, come from the AS. Byan, to inhabit, or dwell. The word metaphorically sig∣nifies, to endure or suffer any hardship. Above, from the AS. Bufan, Belg. Boven, and the super∣fluous, particle a, and both again from the AS. Ufan. About, from the AS. Abutan, which is compounded of ab, from, and utan, without, abroad, the last, or extremi∣ty; from whence comes the Belg. Buyten, which signifies the same. Abroad, from the superfluous Par∣ticle a, and bload: which see. Abstain, from the Teut. Abste∣hen, Belg. Af-stain; which signifie; to stand off from: If it may not more commodi∣ously be drawn from the Lat. Abstineo; which I incline to. Abuct, from the Fr. Aboutir; which signifies, to oppose, or confront. Accompany, v. Company, Accomplish, from the Fr. Accom∣plir, Ital. Accompire; if it may not be better done from the Decomposit Lat. Adcom∣plere, thoroughly to finish. Accompt, or Account, from the Fr. Accompter, or the Lat. Adcomputare. Accold, from the Fr. Accorder, the Ital. and Spanish Noun Accordo, the Lat. Accordare; which all signifie, to agree, or consent: But I think it is bet∣ter deduced from the Lat. Praep. ad, and Chorda, the string of a musical Instru∣ment, because they ought to agree or accord in harmony:
And this is easily done, by ta∣king away h in chorda, and changing ad into ac, as is fre∣quent in Composition. Hence come our According, and Ac∣cordingly. Accost, from the Fr. Accoster, Ital. Accostare, to draw near one: It may not inelegantly be fetch'd from the Lat. praep. Ad, and Costa a rib; which, by a Synecdoche partis pro to∣to, may signifie the whole side; as Wrestlers do accost one another, by joining side to side. Account, from the obsolete Fr. Acconter, the Ital. Accontare, to tell, declare, or shew. See Accompt, and Recount. Accouter, from the Fr. Accou∣trer, to cloath, or apparel; q. d. Lat. Adconsutare, to tack on together. Accrew, from the Fr. Noun Ac∣crue, an increase, or addition; if you cannot, by the help of a figure or two, deduce it from the Lat. Accrescere, to abound, or increase. Accurse, v. Curse. Accustom, v. Custom. Acc, from the Fr. Az; if you cannot draw it from the bar∣barous Greek , which signifies a Dy. Ach, Ake. from the AS. Ace, Ece, grief, or pain; which may be easily derived from , that signifies the same thing. I think it may most truly be drawn from the Ache bone, that part being ve∣ry much subject to a distem∣per called Ischias, or Hip-Gout; which we corruptly enough call Sciatica. Acknowledge, from the praep. Ad, the AS. Cnaƿ, a con∣tract of Cnaƿan, to know, or Knowledge it self, and Le∣gan, to put; that is, to put into my knowledge or under∣standing. Acorn, from the AS. Aac, an Oak, and Cern, grane, or fruit; from whence flow the Belg. Aker, Aecker, Eeckel; and the Teut. Eychel, Ecker, which all signifie an Acorn. Acquaint, from the Fr. Accoin∣ter, to acquire one's friend∣ship. Acquest, profit, or gain; from the Fr. Acquest, the Ital. Ac∣quisto, and all of them from the Lat. Acquisitum, ab Ac∣quiro. Acquit, to absolve, or free; from the Fr. Acquitter, q. d. Lat. Adquietare, to make quiet: So our A quittance, from Ital. Acquittanza, q. d. Adquie∣tantia, or a quieting. Adamant, from the Greek , which comes from the Privative α and , to tame, by reason of its insupe∣rable hardness. Adder, from the AS. Aetter, Belg. Adder, Teut. Matter, C. Br. Meidr, Dan Eder; which all signifie the same thing.
An Addle Egg, AS. Adel, a disease, Adlian, to be sick, q. d. a sick, or rotten Egg. Address, Fr. Addresser, Ital. Ad∣drizzare, q. d. Lat. Addire∣ctare; because all our prayers and arguments are directed to some particular thing or per∣son. Adieu, Fr. Adieu, Ital. Adio, Hisp. Adios, farewel: q. d. Ad Deum te commendo, I commend you to God. Adjourn, from the Praep. Ad, and the Fr. Jour, the Ital. Giorno, a day; which, not unlikely, comes from the Lat. Diur∣num, daily. Adjoining, from the Fr. Adjoin∣dre, Lat. Adjungere, to join to. Adjudge, v. Iudge. Adjust or Make even Accounts; from the Fr. Adjuster, to ac∣commodate, or fit to; q. d. Lat. Adjustare, to make even Accounts. Admiral, from the Arabick E∣mir, a Lord, or Commander, and the Greek , belong∣ing to the Sea; q. d. Prince of the Sea: It may, not un∣likely, be drawn from the Teut. Ampt, mer, al; Office, Sea, whole; q. d. one that hath the sole Command of the Sea. Minsevus takes it from Aen, inter al; above, Sea, the whole; q. d. over the whole Sea. Ao. with much ado; from the Verb do. or act, and the ini∣tial Particle A. Advance, Fr. Avancer, Ital. A∣vanzare, to move profit, or go forward; from ab and an∣te; i. e. from what one was before; q. d. from an inferior degree to an higher. Advantage, from the Fr. Avan∣tage, profit, or help. To adventure, q. d. Lat. Adven∣turare; as Adventura, or E∣ventura, understand Fortuna, or Hora. Advertise, from the Lat. Adver∣tere, to admonish, teach tho∣roughly, or make sure of. Advice, or Advise, from the Fr. Advis, or the Ital. Aviso, Counsel, or Opinion. Affair, from the Fr. Affaire, Ital. Affare, a business, or employ; q. d. Lat. Adfacere, tied to do a thing that lies upon me to be done. Affiance, from the Fr. Affiance, faith, or trust. Afford, from the Teut. Furdern, Fordern: It may be also brought from the Particle A, or rather, the Praep. Ad, and the AS. Bord, a table; q. d. to allow victuals for the table. Affraid, or Afraid, from the Fr. Effrayer, Effroyer, to scare, or terrifie. I could willingly deduce it from the Lat. Praep. Ad, and our English word Fear, or Fear'd. Affranchise, v. Enfranchise. Affright, from our initial Par∣ticle A, and Fright; which see.
Affront, Fr. Affront, Ital. Af∣fronto, Hisp. Afrenta, all sig∣nifying the same thing; as if one should say in Lat. Adfrontare, i. e. set front against front, or oppose one to the face. Afore, v. Before. Afresh, from the initial A, and Fresh; which see. Aft, and Abaft, Sea-terms, from the AS. Aeftan, behind, or after; that is, the hinder part of the Ship. Somnerus useth the word Baeftan in the same sence; a contract, as I suppose, of Abaeftan, to which, by taking of the two last Letters, we owe the Ori∣ginal of our Abaft. After, from the AS. Eft, Aefter, Aeftan, after; Belg. Achter, after; Run and Dan. Efter, the ancient Teut. After. Dr. Mer. Cas. ingeni∣ously fetches it from the Greek , Caeterùm. Again, from the AS. Agen, again; and both ours and the AS. from the AS. Eac, or Aec, again, and Ana, toge∣ther, q. d. one after another immediately. Against, from the AS. Agen, Ongean, opposite to. Agast, from the superfluous Par∣ticle A, and the AS. Gast, a Spirit, Spectre, or Shadow; q. d. frighted with the sight of some, Spectre, or Ghost. It may not unlikely be drawn from the Gr. . to wonder with horrour. Agate-stone, from the Gr. . Agnail: Somnerus does ingeni∣ously derive it from the AS. Ange vexed, and Naegle a Nail; q. d. a pained Nail. It may very well be drawn from Ad to, and our English Nail, because it grows by the nails of one's feet; q. d. a nail to a nail. Ago, as we say, long ago, is ma∣nifestly derived from A, and go; which see. There is an AS. word, which signifies, By-past, viz. Agan, from which it possibly may come. Agony, from the Gr. , whose root signifies, a stri∣ving, or conflict, as people in an Agony have. Agree, from the Fr. Aggreer; but I think, more likely from the Lat. Ad and Gratum; q. d. grateful, or acceptable to. Aggrieve, v. Grieve. Ague, from the Fr. Aigu, sharp; because an Ague, at least, in the Paroxism, is sharp. Ah, from the Lat. Oh; or, as all other Interjections, from the sound that by natural instinct, one in misery puts forth. Aid, from the Fr. Aider, Ital. Aiutare, and both of them from the Lat. Adjutare, to help. Aim, from the Fr. Esme, a scope, or mark; though not unlike∣ly, from the Lat. Aestimare,
i. e. diligently to take heed, as those that shoot at a Mark do Air, from the Fr. Air, which again comes from the Lat. Aer, and the Gr. , the Air. Ake, v. Ach. Aker, from the AS. Acere, Aecer, Aeccer, Belg. and Teut. Acker, Fr. Norm. Acre, a field, ground; also a mea∣sure of ground; commonly deduced from the Lat. Ager, and that from the Gr. . Right spell'd, Acre. Aarm, from the Fr. G. Alarme, or the Ital. Alarma, signify∣ing the same thing. Alas, from the Lat Lassus wea∣ry, or the Ital. Lastare to re∣linquish, and the idle Particle A; q. d. Oh me lassum vel derelictum! O me, weary or forsaken! Alate, from the idle Particle A, and Late; q. d. Of late: Which see. Albeit, q. d. be it all so. Alburn-colour, from the Lat Al∣bus white, and the Ital. Bur∣no, by a Metathesis for Bruno, brown; q. d. a white Brown. V. Brown. Alchymy, from the Lat. Alchy∣mia, and that from the Arab. Al, and the Gr. , or , to pour. Alcoran, from the Arab. Al, and Koiran, he read, or collected; q. d. a Lecture, or Collection of Precepts. Alderman, from the AS. Eal∣derman, and that from Ael∣dor, Ealdor, or Aldor, older, and Man man. Ale, from the AS. Eale, Run. Dan. and Dan. rec. Oll. It may posibly be drawn from the Gr. , heat. Alegar, a word in use in Lincoln∣shire, q. d. Ale-eager, i. e. Sour Ale. Alemb ck, from the Arab. Alam∣bic, by an easie Transmuta∣tion. Alight, v. Light. Alike, v. Like. Alive, v. Live. All, from the AS. Ael, Eal, Ealle, Alle, Run. Dan. Dan. rec. & C Br. Oll, All, Belg. Al, Teut. and Belg Alle, the whole, all; all of them from the Gr. . Allay, to mitigate, or lenifie, ei∣ther from the Fr. G. Allier, to bind, i. e. to fasten, or re∣strain; or from Alleger, to alleviate. Allegiance, or the Faith that we owe to the King; no doubt, from the Lat. Alligare to bind; q. d. a tying, or binding; i. e. the Bond of Faith due from Subjects to Princes. Alley, from the Fr. G. Allée a narrow Street. An Ally, from the Fr. G. Allie, a Relation; q. d. Lat. Adli∣gatus, bound to. Alliance, from the Fr. G. Alli∣ance; which signifies, a con∣federacy, or compact.
To Allot, from Ad and Lot; which see. Allow, from the Fr. G. Alloüer, to approve. Alloy, or Allay, from the Fr. G. Aloy, a mixture of the coursest of any thing with the best. Allure, or intice, from the Lat. Ad, and the Eng. Lure; which see. Almanack, from the Arab. Al, and Manach, to number ori∣ginally; though possibly, we may have it from the Fr. Al∣manach: Some derive it from the Belg. Al-maen-achte, i. e. the Observation of all the Months. Alms, from the AS. Aelmes, Aelmesse, and that from the Gr. , pity, or compassion; of which, Alms are the effect. Almighty, v. Mighty. Almond, from the Fr. G. A∣mande, Ital. Amandola, Hisp. Almendra; all of which come from the Lat. and Gr. Amygda∣lium, , which sig∣nifie the same. Almoner, from the Fr. G. Au∣mosne, an Alms. Almost, from the Belg Al-meest, for the most part, chiefly, especially: It may be drawn from our own words, All and Most; q. d. most part of all. Aoft, from the Belg. Al-heft, all elevate, or sublime: But I think it may, without offence, be taken from the Northern word Loft, now in use, signi∣fying, a Room above Stairs, the initial Particle A being added; which they not unlikely retain from the Danish words, Loff∣ter, Loffter-op, and Oploffter, to elevate, or lift up. Alone, from the Belg. Al-een, Teut. Alloin, q. d. only one. See All, and One. Along, from our initial A, and Long; which see. Alooff, q. d. All-off. See All, and Off. Aloud, v. Loud.

Amatu, from the idle Particle A and the AS. Maegen power; q. d. with all his force. Amass, from the Fr. G. Amasser to heap together; q. d. Lat. Admassare, idem.
Amaze, q. d. to put one in a Maze or Labyrinth, from the idle Particle A, and Maze; which see. Amber, from the Fr. G. Ambre, the Ital. and barbarous Lat. Ambra; or if you please, from the Arab. Ambar, which sig∣nifies the same. Amber-griese, from the Fr. G. Ambre gris, or the Ital. Am∣bra grigia. Amble, from the Fr. G. Ambler, and this from the Lat. Ambu∣lare, which by contraction is Amblare. Ambry, or as North-Country∣men now speak it, Anry, an old-fashion'd kind of Cup∣boards; possibly, from the Fr. G. Aumoire, the same. Ambury, a disease in Horses legs; perhaps from the AS.
