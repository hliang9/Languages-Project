AN Epistle from the holy Spirit of the Lord Je∣sus Christ the eternal Father, written by the Lords two last witnesses and prophets, that e∣ver shall declare the mind of God the man Jesus, that was crucified without the gates of Jeru∣salem: the Lord Jesus by us his poor despised messengers hath sent this Writing unto the Christian world so called. Wherefore we declare by vertue of our Commission, given unto us by voice of words from the holy Spirit of the Lord Jesus from the throne of his glory, to make known his preroga∣tive will and pleasure both to the elect world, and reprobate world, a little before his glorious coming to separate between the two worlds, that whosoever despiseth this Writing, whe∣ther he be a King, or a Beggar▪ by calling it blasphemy, or he∣resie, or delusion, or a lye, or speaking evil of it in any kind whatsoever; in so doing they have committed that unpardon∣able sin against the holy Ghost, or spirit that sent us, Where∣fore in obedience to our Commission from the Lord Jesus Christ, whom they have despised, and not us, we pronounce them cursed both soule and body from the presence of the Lord Jesus, elect men, and Angels, to all eternity. John Reeve and Lodowick Muggleton, the Lords two last true Witnesses and Prophets, spoken of in the ele∣venth of the Revelation, a little before the coming of him that sent us, who is the Judge of both quick and dead.
FEbruary the 3.4 and 5. 1651. three mornings together, much about an houre, the Lord Jesus, the only wise God, whose glorious person is re∣fident above or beyond the stars, I declare from the spirit of truth, that this Jesus from the throne of his glory, by voice of words, spake unto me John Reeve, saying; I have given thee understanding of my mind in the Scriptures, above all men in the world. The next words the Lord spake unto me, were these, saying; Look into thy own body, there thou shalt see the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Kingdom of Hell: the Lord spake these words unto me twice together. Again, the Lord spake unto me these words, saying; I have chosen thee my last messenger for a great work, unto this bloudy unbeleeving world. And I have given thee Lodowick Mug∣gleton to be thy mouth: at that very moment the holy spi∣rit brought inot my mind that Scripture of Aaron given un∣to Moses. Again, the Lord spake unto me these words, say∣ing; I have put the two-edged sword of my spirit into thy mouth, that whoever I pronounce blessed, through thy mouth, is blessed to eternity; and whoever I pronounce cur∣sed through thy mouth, is cursed to eternity. When I heard these words, my spirit desired the Lord, that I might not be his dreadfull messenger. For indeed I thought upon the de∣livering of so sad an unexpected message unto men, I should immediately have been torn to pieces. Again, the Lord spake unto me these words, saying; If thou dost not obey my voyce, and go where ever I send thee to deliver my message, thy body shall be thy hell, and thy spirit shall be the devill that shall torment thee to eternity; then for a moment I saw this hell within me, which caused me to answer the Lord these words, saying; Lord, I will go wherever thou sendest me, only be with me. These were the Lords words spoken unto me the first morning, and my answer unto my God; I being as perfectly awaked when he spake unto me, the Lord is my witnesse, a I was at the writing hereof. Again, the next morning the Lord spake unto me, saying;
Go thou unto Lodowick Muggleton, and with him go unto Thomas Turner, and he shall bring you to one John Tane, and do thou deliver my message when thou comest there; and if Lodowick Muggleton deny to go with thee, then do thou from me pronounce him cursed to eternity. These words the ord spake unto me the second morning, and no more. The third and last morning, the Lord spake unto me these words, saying; Goe thou unto Lodowick Muggle∣ton, and take such a woman along with thee; and then go thou unto one John Robins, a Prisoner in new Bridewell, and do thou deliver my message to him when thou comest there. These were the Lords words the third and last mor∣ning, and all the words in the Commission of the Lord spo∣ken unto me; only this message of the Lod extends in general to the whole world; because the elect Jewes and Gentiles are mixt in marriages through all parts of this Earth, for whose sakes only we are sent. But as for those natural unbeleeving Jewes, that deny that God is come in flesh, those Jews shall never come to the faith of Jesus, we are not sent unto these. The holy Spirit beareth witnesse in my spirit of the truth of that which I shall write unto you, that the first words that the Lord spake into me, the words speaking came into my spirit and body, with such an excee∣ding bright burning glory of God like Majesty, that I did not well know whether I was a mortal man, or an immortal God; so glorious are the words of the immortal God, that the tongues of Men nor Angels can never expresse it; my body also was changed at that time for a season in a most dreadful manner to behold, of the which there be many can bear witness at this time. Again, for your information that are spirituall, the Lord opened the understanding of my fellow witnesse, and made him obedient with me in the mes∣sages of the Lord, as Aaron understanding was opened, to make him obedient with Moses in the messages of the Lord at that time; and the Lord hath given him as glorious te∣stimonies by Revelation from his holy spirit many a time of the full assurance of this Commission to be from the Lord, as ever the Lord gave to Aaron to assure him, that Moses
Commission was from the Lord; onely Moses Commission (he being the Lords first Commissioner unto men) was ma∣nifested by natural signes visiby upon the bodies of men and women: and on the contrary; we being the Lords last Commissioners, our Commission is manifested by spiritual signes, upon the invisible spirits of men and women▪ because our message is all spiritual, concerning men and womens eternal weal or woe in the life to come. II. A Gaine, That you that are elected unto eternall Glory, may understand some thing of John Robins aforesaid; I declare from the holy Spirit, that this John Robins was that last great Antichrist, or man of sin, or son of perdition, spoken of by Paul the Apostle in the Thessalouians, who (as it is written) opposeth, and exalteth himselfe above all that is called God; so that he as God, sitteth in the Temple of God, shewing himselfe that he is God: This is he that was to appeare in this last Age, a lit∣tle before the personall visible coming of the Lord Jesus in the Clouds, with his ten thousands of Saints in power and great glory, to separate between the persons of the true Christians, whose weapons are spiritual Faith, that worke by love and patience, with all other such like heavenly vertues, from the persons of all lying Hypocrites, who call themselves Christians, but they are indeed far worse then Heathens, by killing their Neighbours with the sword of steele; therefore their damnation will be far greater then the Heathens, in the day of the Lords vengeance. Againe, it would be too tedious to write unot you, wherein this John Robins did appear to be the man of sin as before-said; so that the Pope is not the man of sin, as men blindly ima∣gine, for want of the spirit of the Scriptures: but on the contrary, I declare from the spirit of the Lord Jesus, that all men that call themselves Christians, and yet make use of the sword of steel, in any case whatsoever, the Pope and those men are both Christians alike; therefore to be an An∣tichrist, or a man of sin to oppose God, as before said, I de∣clare from the holy Spirit, that is, when a man doth exalt
himself in the place or person of God, and doth set up a worship seemingly, far more pure then the simple plain wor∣ship of God, and to manage his design, he doth shew many great lying signs and wonders, as this John Riobns did, to the amazement of many deceived by him. It was a spiritual op∣posing of Jesus, which is the only God, by shewing of seem∣ing spiritual lying signes and wonders, as this John Robins did, yea, he shewed such signs as the Popes could never shew, nor never shall shew: wherefore that you that are the elect, may no longer remain in the dark, concerning the last great spiritual Antichrist, I declare from the Lord Jesus that this Jo. Robins did attribute to himself the titles of the only God: first he called himself Adam, Melchizedeek: again, he call'd himselfe the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Also, he held forth a Trinity of Persons; as namely, Adam, Abel, and Cain: Again, he call'd himself the first Adam, saying, after he had been five thousand six hundred and odd years in the dust, he was risen from the dead to deliver his people; then he said, that Abel was his Son Jesus, the se∣cond person of his Trinity: then he called Cain the Holy Ghost, and this was his third Person of his Trinity. This Cain that was the seed of the Serpent, or son of the Devil, this was his Holy Ghost. I could write very much of his Trinity concerning his Wife Eve so called by him, and of a Jesus he said should be born of her of his begetting, and of a Disciple of his that he called Cain, to make up his coun∣terfeit Trinity, but that it would hinder things of more va∣lue: again, he declared, that he knew all Angels, their names, and their natures; also he said, he had a power over all voyces; also he said, that he knew what the spirits of men spake that were in the dust: againe, he said, that he was Judge both of quick and dead; again he said, that the Lord Jesus was a weak and an imperfect Saviour, and afraid of death; but he said, that he had no fear of death in him at all; but this Cain hath proved himself an old lyar, since his great blasphemy against the Lord Jesus: a∣gain, this John Robins did declare, that he was to gather the Jews in all Nation, and to lead them into their own Land
unto Jerusalem; with many more such like things declared by him. A for his lying spiritual signes and wonders, they were these and such like, unto some that were deceived by him, he did present the form of his person riding, upon the wings of the Wind like unto a flame of fire; also he did present unto some in their beds a great light, like unto a flame of fire over all the Room, that they have been compell'd to hide their faces in their beds, fearing they should be burn'd; but when they hid their faces in their bed, the light did ap∣pear more brighter then before: also he would present unto them half Moons and Stars, and sometimes thick darknesse, darker then any natural darknesse whatsoever: also he did present his head only in the day time without a body, to a Gentlewoman that I know in her Chamber; also presenting unto her to deceive her, the forms of strance beasts, as namely Dragons, and such like. Again, I de∣clare from the Lord, that this John Robins did present the form of his face, looking me in the face in my bed, the most part of a night, insomuch that I cryed in my spirit unto the Lord, and the Lord by his Spirit revealed this great Antichrist unto me, to my exceeding joy, and his everlasting praise. Much more might be spoken of his deceits in this kind; but now I shall declare the manner of his being worshipped as a God, by those deceived by him: they prayd unto him, and they fell flat on their faces and worshipped him, calling him their Lord and their God; also he gave commandment to some of them, that they should not make mention of any other God, but him ony: also he gave authority unto some of his Disciples, both unto men, and women▪ to change their wives and their husbands, telling them that they were not united to their own bone. This cursed Cain changed his own wife first, for an example, and called her name Eve, telling his Disciples, that she should bring forth his Son Jesus, and it should be caught up into Heaven; many of his Disciples following of his cursed example, to their utter ruine, in this life and that to come: a so he commanded his Disciples to abstain from meats
and drinks, promising them that they should in a short time be fed with Manna from Heaven, until many, a poor soul was almost starved under his dyet, yea and some were ab∣solutely starved to death, whose bodies could not bear his diet; for those that believed on him indeed, they brought in their whole estates unto him; so that then he had full power over their souls, and bodies, and estates, and he did plague their spirits and bodies at his pleasure, in a most dreadful manner, if they were not obedient to his com∣mands, of the which I my self was an eye-witnesse. I could speak more of this Prince of Devils, in this last age; but I know I have written enough, for a spiritual Chrian to discern something of this great Deceiver in what I have written: when his wickednesse was at the full, the Lord Jesus sent me as beforesaid unto this John Robins to declare his wickednesse unto him, and immediately to pronounce him cursed in soul and body, from the presence of the Lord Jesus, to all eternity; unto the which I with my fellow witnesse were made obedient; then about two months af∣ter this sentence of the Lord Jesus, this John Robins wrote a Recantation of all his seeming great matters declared by him, and sent the writing to General Cromwell, and so ob∣tained his liberty, when he was out of prison, he gave all his disciples about London the slip, and with what silver stead of building of Cities, he went into his own Country, and repurchased his Land, but it was re-bought with the innocent blood of many poor innocent souls, in the highest nature, that ever any man gained such a sum of silver as he did. III. A Gain, I declare from the Lord Jesus, that all those that bear the name of Christians, and yet make use of the sword of steel to slay men, who are the image of God, they are utterly ignorant of the true God, and man Jesus, and enemies to his Gospel, that commands men to love their enemies; therefore their fleshly reason∣ing causeth them to forsake the Gospel of suffering the Grosse of Christ, and they apply themselves to the Law of Moses, to prove it lawful to kill the Gospel of Jesus, instead
of yielding obedience unto it. Unto you that are chosen to work righteousnesse, I declare by revelation from the Holy Spirit, that no spiritual Christian hath any thing to do to meddle with any Scripture from the Law, given by the hand of Moses, to prove it lawful to warre with the sword of steel, because it was lawful for the Nation of the Jews on∣ly, by commission from the Lord, to warre against all the Heathen Gentiles that rose up against the Jews, because they worshipped the God of Israel, who was contrary to the Heathen Idol-gods; and this war of the Jews was law∣ful until God the Father became flesh, to reconcile both Jew and Gentile into that one faith, in the body of his flesh, and no longer: Therefore since God became flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bone, sinne only excepted, I declare from the Lord Jesus, that they that are Christians in∣deed, they are not under the Law of Moses, that is a Sword of steel, but they are under Grace, or the Gospel of Jesus, that is the sword of the Holy Spirit, that makes all true Christians to understand, that in this work their portions is to suffer all kind of wrong from all men, and to return mer∣cy and forgivenesse unto all men, yea and to forgive those that would kill them, because they know all vengeance is the Lords, and he will repay it; therefore they dare not rob God of his glory. Again when the Lord Jesus gave that new Law of love unto all his elect believers, where he saith it was said of old, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth; but I say unto you, love your enemies, blesse them that curse you, do good to them that hate you. These be those Christians indeed that may be called perfect; as their heavenly Father was perfect; the Lord Jesus, who did all good, and suffered all wrong, yea, and laid down his life for that whole world of his Elect, when they were all become his enemies. Again, I declare from the Lord Jesus, that they that are new born by the Holy Spirit, they are so farre from killing, or consenting to the killing of any man, offen∣sively, or defensively, in their own behalfe, or in the behalfe of any other man, that they are afraid of their own evill thoughts, and much more of evil words or deeds, against
God or men; because they know nothing but pure righte∣ousnesse, pure love without envy, and pure innocency shall raign in eternall glory with the only eternal Father, the Lord Jesus; And on the contrary, they know all man-slay∣ers, under what pretence sover, and all Govertous, Idolaters, Drunkards, Swearers, Lyers, Sorcerers, Whoremongers, and all those that vindicate unrighteousnesse, through the love of silver, in opposing of that pure Law of love, that com∣mands all Christians not to do as they are done unto, that is the hypocrits righteousnesse: But on the contrary, to do unto all men, as you would they should do unto you; this is the righteousnesse of pure faith, which is the righteous∣nesse of God, which makes men to fulfil all righteousnesse, for want of this, those unrighteous persons beforesaid must all perish to eternity. Again, I declare from the Lord Je∣sus, that all those that hate to yield obedience to this pure peaceable Law of love, proceeding from the pure spirit of the Lord Jesus; I say in the great and notable day of the Lord, by his decree, or by a word speaking from his mouth, they shall every one of them rise out of the dust together; not with the same bodies they died, or fell asleep in, because there was somewhat of God in those bodies, whilest they lived, which perisheth with them indeath; but the bodies which they shall have, shall be in forme of their former bo∣dies, but they shall be fiery bodies, of spiritual darknesse, yea bodies of all unrighteousnesse, having all the inwicked deeds of their former bodies conveyed into these bodiers, as fewell to kindle the fire of new sorrows: In these bodies of Hell and utter darknesse, and their spirits in their bodies shall be all fiery Devils; so their bodies shall be their King∣dome of Hell, and their proud spirits, that had pleasure in unrighteousnesse, shall be the Devils, that shall be barr'd in close prisoners within their bodies, from all motioning or thinking of any former comforts, either spiritual, or na∣turall, to give them any ease at all, because all time is past; then as beforesaid shall their spirits and bodies burn toge∣ther like a flame of fire, that is all as dark as pitch, they never stirring from the place of their resurrection, nor ne∣ver
seeing one anothers face more, much lesse shall they see the face of God, just men, or Angels, to all eternity, and the place of their eternall torment shall be upon this earth, where they acted all their bloodshed, and all other unrighteousness. Then shall the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and all other natural lights in this lower creation or world; va∣nish or go out like the snuff of a candle, giving no more light to eternity: then shall this fruitful pleasant earth be like unto dry burning sand, the seas and all rivers or springs of water being dryed up for evermore, as if they ne∣ver had any being: this whole creation being turned into a chaos of confusion, without forme, and void of all light or sap, either natural or spiritual, to all eternity, as be∣foresaid. Again, I declare by Revelation from the Holy spirit, what was from Eternity, before any creature was formed, that had any sensible life, either in heaven above, or in this eth beneath; there were these two uncreated substances of earth and water, with the uncreated spiritual person of God the Creator, in whose glorious prefence these senseless substances of earth and water were eternally resident, that the creator might create or forme by his infinite wisedome out of those dead substances, all variety of sensible living creatures in his own time, for the setting forth of his visible glory to eternity. Again, I declare by Revelation from the holy spirit, that the earth and the water were both dark substances, having no light or sensible life at all in them, but the person of the creator was infinitely full of all glorious lights and sensible life to himself, both within and without. Thus it is clear there was death from eternity, only it was not in a sensible forme, as well as there was sensible life, light, and glory, in forme from eternity. Again, eternall life or God, was a substantial forme from eternity, but eter∣nall death or darknesse of earth and water was substance without forme, void of all spirit or life, so that life or spirit only is all substantiall forme, and death or darknesse only, is all substance without forme; so that life and death from e∣cernity are not bare words, as blind hypocrites imagine, but
the invisible creator of all life or spirits, was a God of a glorious substance, a spirituall body, in the form or likenesse of a man from all eternity. Again, I declare from the Lord Jesus, that the glorious sensible life or light in the person of the Creator, could not possibly be known by Men or Angels, but by his creating or forming of some creatures to live sensibly in death and darknesse, shame and misery, and by his creating other creatures in opposition sensibly to live in life and light, joy and glory. Again, the infinite glorious prerogative power of the Creator, could not possibly be known to any of his creatures, to make a distinction between the glory of eternal life, and the misery of eternal death; but by his forming of creatures of the same lump to be vessels of honour and vessels of dishonour to eternity: but of the contrary, if the Creator without distinction had formed his creatures to be all eternally glorious like himself, then the glory of his prerogative power of infinite love or mercy, and infinite justice or wrath, and all his infinite new wisdom increasing or flowing in his glorious person as a fountain of living waters must in a manner have been shut prisoner in his own person, and the creatures must have been all as Gods, instead of creatures, and so the Creator would have had no glory in his Creation at all of the prerogative power of his Godhead. Wherefore I declare by vertue of my Commission from the only wise God and everlasting Father, the man Jesus in glory, that all those that are made to yield obedience in love to the prerogative power of God, are his Elect ones appointed for bles∣sednesse to all Eternity; but on the contrary, all those that are offended at the prerogative power of the Creator, and love to dispute against it, are all Reprobates, and appointed to be cursed to all Eter∣nity.
IV. AGain, for your Information I declare from the holy spirit, that the Creation above or beyond the starre of the holy Angels, who are spiritual bodies, in their persons formed like men, and all other crea∣tures that God hath made in the heavens above, of that substance of earth and water aforesaid, that was from all E∣ternity, in the presence of his eternal spiritual person, I declare from the Lord Jesus, that God the Creator hath made that creation in the heavens above, as visible to be seen, as this creation is seen in this earth beneath. Again, I declare from the holy Spirit, that the glorious person of the onely wise God and eternal Father the Lord Jesus, is as visibly seen of the creatures, where his person is resident, as a man is visibly seen of the creatures in this earth beneath where his person resides: as for this cre∣ation in the heavens above, it is to set forth the glory of his immortal person, that all the creatures in his presence visi∣bly beholding the glorious person of their Creator, both ho∣ly Angels, and other creatures according to their wisdom or understanding, might give him the glory of their eter∣nal happinesse of this their creation: and on the contrary, if the Creator were not visibly seen by the eyes of his crea∣tures, then no creatures could possibly know him to return any praise or glory unto him at all, for the happiness of their condition. Therefore it is a cursed lying imagination for a∣ny man to think that the glorious person of God is not as visibly seen of his creatures in the heavens above, as the per∣son of man, who is the image of God, is visibly seen of the creatures in this earth beneath. Again, you must not think after a fleshly manner, that the creatures above the starrs are male and female for natural generation, as they are in this creation beneath the starrs: for a woman had never been made but for generation, that the immortal God might have a womans womb in this world, to cloath himself with flesh, and that the Reprobate Angel, which is the Devil, might have the womb of a woman to cloath himself with flesh also, to bring forth Gods glorious design, between the
seed of the Woman, and the seed of the Serpent; wherefore I declare from the holy Spirit, that the holy Angels, and all other Creatures that are in the presence of God in the Crea∣tion beyond the stars, are all spiritual male creatures, never encreasing in their numbers, not being fleshly, desiring gene∣ration, but their spirits or natures, instead of fleshly pleasures in generation, are full of spiritual and heavenly joyes, of a more transcendent glorious content within themselves, and visible glorious contents in their beholding of the glorious face of God; and the faces of one another, and the glory of that place they enjoy, the which exceeding glory shineth forth through that heavenly Kingdom, from the bright burn∣ing glorious person of God the Creator, the Lord Jesus Christ, who alone hath all the glory of his Creation in the Heavens above, wherein dwelleth nothing but righteousnesse in Glory. Again, I declare from the Lord Jesus, that no man can un∣derstand, or know any thing of these things that are invisible unto our natural eyes, but by the Spirit of Revelation; there∣fore it is written, that faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen: again, it is written, through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God; so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear; so that in the Letter of the Scripture, it is clear to you that see by the eye of Faith, that God hath made or framed two Worlds, or two Creations which is all one; for you know to frame a thing, or to make a thing is all one. Again, unto you it is clear, there are spi∣ritual visible things, in that world above or beyond the stars, as well as here are natural visible things in this world beneath the stars; because you may understand that this world, and the things that are visible therein, were made or created out of that world which is invisible to us, who are in mortality, but visible to those who are above in glory; so that now, you that are appointed to enter with spiritual bodies into that glorious Creation, or world beyond the stars, may understand a little clearer of your inheritance in that Kingdome made without hands, or City eternal in the Heavens, where you
shall visibly see with your eyes the face of God, Men, Angels, and all Creatures, in that creation above the stars, as you see the face of man, and all other creatures in this creation be∣neath the stars, with glorious new Songs of spiritual and heavenly praises unto a glorious God, to all eternity. This proves the truth of these Scriptures, where it is written, My kingdom is not of this world: and of this saying, Lord remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdom: and of that saying, In my Fathers House, or Kingdom, are many mansi∣ons: and of that saying, For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory for ever: and of that saying, The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ: this world was the Heavens above; and of that saying, neverthelesse, we look for a new Heaven and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousnesse, and of that saying, He hath made us Kings and Priests unto God, and we shall reign with him upon the Earth. This is that glorious new Heaven, and new Earth in the presence of God, above or beyond the stars; but blind carnal hypocrites imagine, that Gods reigning with his Elect ones, will be upon this bloody Earth, because they have no spiritual Eyes to see or know that new Heaven or new Earth, above or beyond the stars, where nothing but pure righteousness reigneth in glory for everlasting, or world without end, Amen. 5. AGain, concerning that Serpent before-said, so cal∣led of the Lord for his subtilty; I declare by Re∣velation from the holy Spirit, that God created his spiri∣tual person more glorious then the persons of all the holy Angels that are in the presence of God in Heaven, because this mighty Angel, by the wisdom and secret Counsel of God, was to be as a God, to bring forth his seed, or genera∣ration of wise, and prudent, subtile Serpent men, and wo∣men to oppose the Creator, and his innocent seed, or gene∣ration of simple plain-hearted men and women, that are of the spirit of faith and pure love, with all other heavenly vertues; for the nature or Spirit of God, is faith and love, and all other divine vertues, infinitely living in his glorious
Person, the which faith is all power of righteous actings, naturally flowing from his pure spirit, as from a pure over∣flowing fountain of living waters: but on the contrary, the nature or spirit of this God-like Angel, and all the rest of the holy Angels in their Creation, were pure reason, from whence naturally flows no good at all, but what comes into them continually by Revelation from that pure spirit of Faith, in the person of God their Creator; and this is that spiritual Manna that keeps the holy Angels natures or spi∣rits pure in the presence of God; for it is the nature of that pure reason in the holy Angels continually to desire the knowledge of that spirit of wisdom in the Creator that made them, and the overflowings of that new wisdom in the spirit of the Creator by the decree of God, it is that spiritual food that keeps the holy Angels pure in their glo∣ry, or else not one of them could stand upright in the pre∣sence of God, not one moment, but they would all become serpent-Devils, and fall down into this earth, as that great Angel did, presently after the Lord withheld the revelation of his glorious wisdom from him; then this Angel for want of his spiritual food of revelation, that kept his spirit in obe∣dience to his Creator, presently his spirit began proudly to imagine and think high and lofty thoughts concerning his own person, and great wisdom of spirit within him, where∣fore secretly he was lifted up in his spirit to disdain the per∣sons and wisdom of all the holy Angels, in comparison of the glory both of his person and wisdom, pride being begun in him, Lucipher-like he soared higher in his pride, for he thought both his person and wisdom to be as glorious, if not more glorious, then the person and wisdom of the Crea∣tor, wherefore he being very proud of his own wisdom, he imagined that if he had been the Creator, he would by a word speaking have created Angels, and all other creatures with∣out Earth▪ or Water, as God made all things of; for his proud spirit thought he could by a word speaking have crea∣ted all creatures of nothing at all, therefore he counted his wisdom, rather greater, and of a more higher nature to have formed all things for a greater glory to himself, if he had
been the Creator, then the Creators wisdom in the things or Creatures formed by him; so imagining his wisdom a∣bove the Creators, he thought himself more fit to reign over the holy Angels, and all other creatures then the Creator; he being wise in his own conceit, became an absolute Fool: for out of nothing comes nothing, and out of nothing comes no form, or nothing can be formed; for to create or make a living form or creature out of senslesse matter or substance, of Earth or Water, by a word speaking, of what nature or form the Creator pleaseth, whether contra∣ry to his own nature and form, of his own nature and form, this is the power and wisdom of my Creator, the Lord Jesus; for he by his infinite glorious wisdom, by a word speaking did create all living creatures in the two Creations or Worlds, of unsensible Earth and Water, that was with∣out his person from all eternity in his presence with him, because his eternal glorious person you know, must have a place of residence, therefore reason it self cannot deny the eternity of Earth and Waters, and the person of the Creator; let it imagine never so much, nor never so long: again, as beforesaid, when the time of this proud and lofty Angels glory was by the decree of the Creator, expired in the Heavens above, to the exceeding joy of all the holy An∣gels, unto whom the Lord revealed his exceeding pride, the Lord then cast down this Angelical wise Serpent into the Earth; therefore it is written, wo be to the Inhabiters of the Earth, for the Devil is come down amongst you, this Angel that was cast into the Earth, is that Devil beforesaid, and his nature or spirit of pride and envy, and all other wickednesse being changed, his names or titles are changed according to the uncleannesse of his nature, and now instead of the name of an Angel of light, he is called an Angel of darknesse, as in Jude; yea he is called a Serpent, a Dragon, a Devil, Satan, or an unclean spirit, or that wicked one, suitable to his cursed nature; but the Lord changed not the form or person of this Reprobate lost Angel at all, but his names or titles only as beforesaid, according to his nature.
Again, I declare by Revelation from the Holy Spirit, that that Serpent spoken of in the Scripture that tempted the Virgin Wife Eve, he was a spiritual body in the form of his person like unto a man; yea, I say from the Lord, that this Angel-Serpent was more amiable or glorious in the form of his person to the outward appearance of Eves eyes, then the Person of the man Adam was; wherefore, by the prerogative power, and secret wisdom and Counsel of God, to bring forth his glorious design, it was the outward com∣linesse of the Serpents person, and his seeming wise and glo∣rious God-like counsel, by the decree of God, became a snare to deceive and overcome the innocent Virgin VVife Eve, as many a poor innocent Virgin in these dayes are de∣ceived and overcome, by the outwad comlinesse of mens persons, through their Serpent-counsels, and cursed temp∣tations; wherefore it is written, the woman was deceived, and not the man. Again, I declare by Revelation from the holy Spirit, that when this Angel-Serpent, by hi seeming wise God-like Counsel, had overcome innocent Eve, as before-said; the very person of this spiritual Serpent Reprobate Angel, en∣tred into the body or womb of innocent l ve, and there he dyed, or was changed from his spirituality, and immediate∣ly he quickned in her pure undefiled seed, or nature all ser∣pentine lust of all natural uncleannesse; wherefore, she be∣ing now naked from her former pure created Virginity, presently she i full of natural lust after her innocent Hus∣band, that had no desire to a woman at all, therefore it is written, and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat; then were they both naked, from that pure spiritual life of their virgin creation of God-lke content within their own spirits, and in the room thereof they are both full of all natural lusts whatsoever; they being both defiled with the spirit of the Serpent-Angel of unclean reason and wicked imagination▪ and this was that cursed effect of their becom∣ing as Gods, knowing both good an evil, until they were both born again by the spirit of Faith, to the full assurance of a more glorious Inheritance then that which was lost
through the eternal love of God to his lost Image. Again, I declare from the Lord Jesus, that, that Cain that was the first born of Eve, he was the very seed or spirit of that reprobate Serpent angel in the body of Eve, and the first born child or son of the Devil, and so he became, and none but he alone, that Belzebub, the Prince of Devils, and the only father of all those Angels of darknesse spoken of in the Epistle of Jude, that are kept or reserved in chains of darknesse, of unbelief, unto the Judgment of the Great Day. Therefore, where it is written of the warfare between Michael and his Angels, and the Dragon and his Angels, that Michael is the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, in his Angeli∣cal believers, whose spiritual weapons are faith, and love, and patience, and such like, unto the death, because they see a crown of Life, in yielding obedience to the crosse of Christ. The Dragon, that is the spirit of cursed Cain in his persecuting believers, whose carnal weapons are swords and guns, and all kinds of murdering weapons whatsoever, flow∣ing from ignorance, cursed covetousnesse, and vain-glorious envy, selling their eternal birthright for a messe of pottage, because the Lord Jesus hath no delight in their persons. A∣gain, it is written, and the Dragon was cast out, that old Ser∣pent called the Devil and Satan, he was cast out into the earth, and his Angels were cast out with him; that Cain before-said was that Serpent Dragon Angel, and his Angels are that fleshly seed of his, or off-spring or generation of serpent, wise, prudent men and women that mind earthly things▪ These are those Serpent reprobate Angels, that go upon the bellies of their spirits, and lick up the dust of the earth all the dayes of their lives: that is, their spirits lick up the gold and silver, and put it into a bag, for their gene∣rations, and this is the food of their souls, and such like all their dayes. This is that spirit of unclean reason and wicked imagination that was in Cain, and now is in all his Angels, who are the Lords of this world, whose spirits wholly thirst after things that perish, and they are never in their proper center, but when the thoughts of their spirits are
feeding upon riches, or honours, or friends, or fleshly de∣lights, or long life, and such like. This was the food of that Serpent Cain, that slew his brother Abel, because he was more righteous then he; and this is the food and no other of all those Serpent angelical men and women, both great and small, that are the very sons and daughters of cursed Cain, hating all spiritual righteousnesse in all spiritual Abels as he did. Therefore as beforesaid, cursed together with that Serpent Reprobate Devil their father Cain, from the presence of the Lord, just men and Angels, to all Eter∣nity. VI. AGain, for your Information, in whose persons the Lord by his holy Spirit delights to dwell: I declare by Revelation from the holy Spirit of the Lord Jesus, a little of that wonderful unspeakable mystery of God the Father, cloathing himself, or manifesting him∣self in flesh: it is written, she was found with child by the Holy Ghost Again, it is written, for that which is con∣ceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost; and the Word became flesh; and behold a Virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emanuel, which being interpreted, is God with us. Again, it is written, For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be on his shoulders, and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace; of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end: From these Scriptures, it is very clear in the bare Letter, unto you that see God by the eye of Faith, that that holy Child Je∣sus, that was born of the Virgin-Wife Mary, he is the only God and alone eternal Father unto you that have faith in a personal God, or a God of one distinct person, and no more unto you alone, for whom is prepared a Crown of immortal glory. I declare by Revelation from the Holy Spirit of the Lord Jesus, that the Holy Ghost beforesaid, was the Glorious Person of that one only Wise God, and Everlasting Father, and Creator of all things, that entred
into the Virgins womb, and dyed, or changed his immor∣tality or spirituality in the body or womb of the Virgin, and immediately quickned or conceived himself of the very nature or seed of the Virgin; a pure natural child or son, in whom, as it is written, the fulnesse of the God-head lived bodily; so that as the Serpet-angel beforesaid, en∣tred into the womb of the Virgin-VVife Eve, and defiled her pure nature, or seed throughout, and dyed in her womb from his spirituality, and quickned in mortality, and brought forth himself the first born child or son of the Devil, and so he became the father of an innume∣rable company of Serpent reprobate Devils of men and women; so in opposition of that reprobate Angel, and Prince of Devils beforesaid, the glorious person of the eternal God entred into the womb of the Virgin-Wife Mary, and dyed in her womb from his immortality, and purified her nature or seed throughout, that was unclean before, and quickned himself in pure mortality, and brought forth himself the first born son of God, and the only eternal Father of an innumerable company of elect sons and daughters purchased by his own precious blood: Thus immortality dyed and quickned in morta∣lity, and this pure mortality dyed and quickned in immorta∣lity and glory again, in that very same flesh or person that dyed, and now reigneth in glory in the highest Hea∣vens, and the lowest hearts, God alone blessed to all eterni∣ty. Thus Eternity became Time, and Time is become eter∣nity again; for there is nothing but an eternal immortal God, that is the Creator of all life, that can by his own power, live and dye, and live again: But on the contrary, no creature hath any power at all, neither to live, nor to dye, but by the decree of the Creator alone, the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus you that see by that single eye of Faith, may understand in some measure the difference between the seed of the woman, and the seed of the Serpent; for ever since the Angel-Serpent, by his wise cursed Counsel, took pos∣session of the Garden of God, the bodies of our first parents.
I declare from the Holy Spirit, that there is no Devil at all without the body of man or woman, but what dwells within the bodies of men and women; so that, that Devil so frequently spoken of in the letter of the Scripture, that tempts men and women to all unrighteousnesse, it is mans spirit of unclean reason, and cursed imagination, that un∣satiably lusteth after things that perish; until the Holy Spirit of faith enters into the man, and purifies his unclean spirit, and reveals unto his dark understanding spiritual and glorious durable things, and that makes a man trample this perishing world, and all its vain-glory, under the feet of his spirit as dung, as it is, in comparison of the glory that is to come, in that world above the stars that remains to all eternity. VII. AGain, it is written, a woman shall compasse a man: that woman was the Virgin Mary, and that man was God the Father. Again, it is written, a woman cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve Stars: this woman was the Virgin Mary beforesaid, and the Sun that she was cloath∣ed withal, was the only begotten Son of God, the eternal Father in the Virgins womb; and the Moon under her feet, that was the worship of th Law of Moses; for she being cloathed with the Sun, she was filled with the Reve∣lation of the everlasting Gospel of that Son within her, which was of a more transcendent glory, than that of the Law: and that Crown of twelve Stars upon her head, that was the twelve Apostles that sprang from her head Jesus, to preach the everlasting Gospel of Truth and Peace unto his Elect: thus that saying, that every seed shall have his own body, is a little more clear unto you that have faith, in a personal God, then it was before: you may understand that God the Father was a spiritual man from eternity, and that in time his righteous spiritual body brought forth a righteous natural body, that the Father to shew forth his
infinite love and humility, and to bring forth a new trans∣cendent glory to himself, might become a son, yea and a servant unto his creatures, in the very condition of a crea∣ture for a season, that he might exalt his elect creatures in∣to the same condition of the Creator, in his glory in the highest Heavens to all eternity, when the curtains of this lower Heavens are drawn and vanisht like smoak never more to be, time being past. Again, it is written, he that hath seēn me hath seen the Father, and the Father liveth in me, and I live in him, and I and the Father are one: the only mean∣ing or mind of the Lord Jesus in those words is this; his Spirit living within his body that was the Father, and his visible body that was the Son, both God and man in one person, and so but one personal God, the man Christ Je∣sus, he perfectly knowing himself to be the only God, he said unto the Jews, except ye eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no life in you: again he said, except ye believe that I am he, ye shall dye in your sins: his very mind in those words was this, except they did believe, that that very person of his, of flesh, blood, and bone that spake unto them, was the only God and eternal Father, and alone Sa∣viour of all that were to be saved, and that there was no salvation to mankind, but thus spiritually eating of his flesh, and drinking of his blood, except they did thus own his person, to be their Lord and only Saviour, they must all die in their sins, and perish to all eternity, because there is nothing but the precious blood of a God, can pos∣sibly clense the spirit of man from the power of sin; therefore if the very Godhead had not died; that is, if the very soul of Christ (which is the eternal Father) had not died in the body, or with the body, to quiet or satisfie the cry of the guilt of sin in mens spirits, all men would have perisht to eternity; because the spirit of unclean rea∣son the Devil in man, whose nature is all sin, did reign in the very bodies of the Elect, as their Lord and King, and they were free from the power of righteousnesse, until the precious blood of a God, by the Holy Spirit of Faith, was sprinkled in their consciences, that by the pure life or spi∣ritual
love to God and man, they might break the Ser∣pents head of sin, of reigning any longer in them: but on the contrary, they that have no faith given them, in the precious blood of God to clense their spirits from the power of that Devil sin in them; their sins will be their Lord and King, and they must perish together eter∣nally as beforesaid; Again, by this time it is very clear to you that have the faith of Jesus, that the Serpent Angel beforesaid was a spiritual body or person in the form of a man, before he entred into the womb of Eve, by that seed or son of his called Cain: Thus every seed or spirit by the decree of God, brings forth his own body according to its nature or kind; God the Father being a spiritual man from all eternity, in time begot and brought forth himself a manchild in mortality, of all pure righteous∣nesse, therefore he was called the expresse Image of the Fa∣ther, because he was indeed the very Father, and that made him say, be thought it no robbery to be equal with God; and that was the cause that made him say, that all power was given unto him both in heaven and in earth, because he knew perfectly that there was no other God but himself to possesse all power; and this made the Prophet Isaiah to attribute the chief titles of the everlasting Father, unto the Son, that was to be made of a Woman, or of a Virgin; because the Prophet knew very well, that the Father and the Son was but one unseparable person in immortal glo∣ry from all eternity, and so he knew they were to become in time, one unseparable Person of all purity, in mortali∣ty: and I with him know from the same spirits that re∣vealed it to the Prophet long before God became flesh, that that pure mortality, both spirit and body that died toge∣ther, they did both immediately quicken together, a new life in death, or out of death, and they unseparably, both Father and Son in one person, did ascend together, into that immortal glory that they possesse together from all Eternity, and so they now enjoy it again, in one trans∣cendent glorious person, both God and man to all Eter∣nity.
This proves the truth of these sayings, Glorifie me with the same glory I had with thee before the world was; and of that saying, My glory I will not give to another; and of that saying, Before Abraham was, I am; accord∣ing to that saying of God to Moses, when he bade Moses tell Pharaoh that I am sent him; and of that saying. He thought it no robbery to be equal with God; and of that say∣ing, I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever; and of that saying, This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die; and of that saying, For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world; and of that saying, I am that bread of life; Again, Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Fa∣ther; and of that saying, What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before; and of that full say∣ing that proves Jesus to be the Father, He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not; and of that saying, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, the same was in the beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. Whoso∣ever is not stark blind, by this Scripture must needs un∣derstand that there is no Creator nor Father, but the man Jesus only, the Lord of life and glorie; and where it is said, through faith we understand that the worlds were fra∣med by the word of God, so that the things that are visible or seen, were not made of things that do appear; and of that saying, I am Alpha and Omega, I am the first and the last, and behold, I create all things new; and of that saying, I am he that was dead, and an alive, and behold I live for e∣vermore. This was the man Jesus that sate upon the Throne of the Father, with many other Scriptures too tedious to relate, that prove clearly to all that are ap∣pointed to eternal glorie, that the Lord Jesus Christ that died without the gates of Jerusalem, is the only God, and everlasting Father, and alone Creator of all things
that were made, both in heaven and in earth; There∣fore I declare from the Holie Spirit of the Lord Jesus that sent us, that whosoever prayes in his spirit or tongue unto any other God or Spirit, but unto my God the man Jesus, that sent me, he prayes unto a Devil of his own imagination, instead of a God; for that man Jesus then to come, was Davids only God and Saviour: therefore he said, The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool. And this Jesus was all the true Prophets God in the time of the Law, and this Jesus was the holy Apostles God, and all the Christians God in the time of the Apostles Commission, or Dispensation, or Administration, that lasted about three hundred years; and this glorious man Jesus, is my God alone, and the God of all spiritual Christians in this last age, until he comes in his glorie. VIII. AGain, but some may say, if Jesus Christ be the only God and eternal Father, who was that Father that he spake so much of when he was in mortalitie, where he said, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me; and Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit, and such like; To this I answer, by Revela∣tion from the Holy Spirit, that Eliah spoken of in the Law, that was taken up bodily by a VVhirlwind into Heaven, where the likenesse of a Chariot and Horses of fire appeared to Elisha at his departure: I say from the Lord, that the body or person of that Eliah was taken up and glorified in the Heavens by the Creator for that very purpose that he might represent the person of God the Father for that time or season, whilst God the Fa∣ther went that journey in flesh as aforesaid: Again, it is written, he shall give his Angels charge over thee; those Angels were Moses and Eliah, who being both glori∣fied, they did both represent the Person of the Father, in the Heavens above the Stars, as they did represent the Person of the Son and of the Father, when they were in earth beneath the Stars; when Moses was upon this
earth, he represented the Person of God the Son that Lamb Jesus, that was then to come in flesh; in these things, first Moses was called the Meekest man upon the face of the earth. Again, he was a great Type of Christ in this, in offering up himself to be blotted out of the Book of Life for the salvation of Israel, as the Lord Jesus be∣came a Curse for his elect Israel; likewise; Moses was a great sufferer at the hands of Israel with much patience; as the Lord Jesus suffered with all patience at the hands of his own People or Nation. Again, Moses was made an An∣gel of the Covenant of the Law unto all Israel, as the Lord Jesus was made or became an Angel of the Covenant of Grace or the Gospel unto all the elect Israel; so, that who∣soever despised the Law of Moses, was to dye a natural death without mercy; as a Tye of the eternal death of all those that despise the Grace or Gospel of Jesus; and in this he was a great Type of the Lord Jesus, when he said, God should raise up a Prophet unto you like unto me, him shall you hear: much more might be spoken of Moses representing of the Person of God the son, but I suppose it is sufficient for any moderate man. Again, when Elias was in this World, he did represent the Person of God the Father, in these things▪ first in a God-like manner by commanding fire to come down from Heaven to destroy his enemies, and it was so again by his commanding like unto a God all the Priests of Baal, that were the National false Priests to be put to death, for drawing the hearts of Israel from worship∣ping of the true God, and that was a Type of the eter∣nal perishing of all the National Priests of Baal in the World at this time; who are Ministers of the letter on∣ly, but call themselves Ministers of the Spirit, and yet the Lord Jesus sent them not: These are those croaking Frogs that keep the people in darknesse, unto whom the people give their silver for nought. Again, Elias by his asking of Elisha in a God-like man∣ner, what he should do for him before he was taken up from him, with his granting of Elisha a double portion of his Spirit, if Elisha saw his departure from him.
Again, Eliah spake in the Authority of the Father, when he told King Ahab to his face, that it was he, and his Fathers house that were the troublers of Israel, by their departing from the living God, with more such like actings of his, after a God-like manner, shewing clearly his representing the person of God the Father when he was upon this earth; which was but a Type of his repre∣senting the person of God the Father in the Heavens after∣wards; but some may say, it seems very strange, the Lord having so many glorious Angels in his presence, that he should passe them by, and take up a mortal man, or a sin∣person of God the Father, as beforesaid: To this I answer from the Holy Spirit; all the Counsels of my God the man Jesus are quite contrary to mans unclean reason; yea, and contrary to the pure reason of the holy Angels also, that God alone may have all the glory, of the revelation of his unsearchable Counsels of wisdom from his Elect men and Angels. Again, I declare by Revelation from the Holy Spi∣rit, that the man Adam in his Creation, was of the very na∣ture of spirit of Faith, with all divine vertues of pure love, patience, meeknesse, and such like spiritual vertues in his spirit or person, which were the very same divine vertues that lived in the spirit or person of God his Creator; only in the person of God every spiritual vertue in him, was in∣finite above all measure, but in the person of the man A∣dam, although they were the very same heavenly vertues, yet in him they were in measure: thus man in his Spirit was created like unto the Creator, of the very same Divine Na∣ture; only they differed in this, for the body or person of God was all spiritual or heavenly, not subject to mortality; but the body or person of the man Adam was natural or earthly, subject to mortality at the pleasure of the Crea∣tor; for, if the body or person of the man Adam had been spiritual in his creation, as his spirit was, then there would have been no difference between the person of the Crea∣tor, and the person of the creature: Thus the man Adam was made like unto God, a pure natural person, of all
righteousnesse in mortality, like unto the spiritual person person of God, which is all righteousnesse in glory. Again, it is written, the first Adam of the Earth earth∣ly; the second Adam, the Lord from Heaven heavenly: Thus you that see by that single Eye of Faith, you may know, that God became flesh or a man, as well as Adam, who was called the Image of God, because God was a spiri∣tual man from Eternity, as abundantly beforesaid: Now you must understand the reason why Jesus the only God was called the second Adam, was this; because the body or person of the Lord Jesus was a pure natural body of all righteousnesse in mortality, just like unto the body or per∣son of the first Adam before his fall; only Christ the se∣cond Adam had the spirit of Faith in him above measure, and the first Adam had the spirit of Faith in him by mea∣sure, as beforesaid: again, the second Adam differed from the first Adam in this, he being made a man of sor∣rows, but the first Adam knew no sorrows before his fall; and why did he become a man of sorrows? it was to re∣deem the Elect seed of the Spirit of Faith overcome in his image the first Adam, by the Reprobate Angel-Serpent, as beforesaid. Again, as for the natures or spirits of the holy Angels in their Creation, they were pure Reason, quite con∣trary to the nature or spirit of Faith in God their Creator; only in their bodies or persons they were spiritual or swift of motion, like unto the spiritual person of God their Creator: but if the nature or spirit of the holy Angels had been of of the spirit of pure Faith, as they were of pure Reason, then there would have been no difference between the per∣son of God their Creator, and the persons of the holy An∣gels in their Creation, who are but creatures as well as men; wherefore not the holy Angels, for they are not of the nature of God, as it is written, he took not upon him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham: but Elias as beforesaid, by the secret wisdom and counsel, and love of God unto man, above Angels, was exalted upon the throne of glory for a moment, to represent the person of God the Father, and he was made the protector of my God, when
God became a child; and it was Elias by vertue of his Commission, as a faithful spiritual Steward upon the throne of glory, that filled the Lord Jesus with those great Re∣velations of his former glory, that he possest in the Hea∣vens, when he was the immortal Father; and it was Elias that spake those words from heaven, saying▪ this is my belo∣ved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear him again when Christ was transfigured upon the Mount, that his garment glittered with the glory of his transfiguration: it was the visible glorious appearance of the persons of Moses and E∣lias talking with him, that were the instrumental Commis∣sioners of that visible glory of the Lord Jesus unto his Disci∣ples, who said, Master, it is good for us to be here: for that glory was so great, that they would have been building of Tabernacles for a continuance in it. Again, I declare from the Lord, that Elias by vertue of his Commission did fill E∣lect men and Angels also with Revelation to keep them in obedience until the Lord Jesus was upon the Throne of his glory again; so that when the Lord Jesus (who was an ab∣solute creature, cryed in his agony unto his Father, & when he prayed unto his Father, that that Cup might passe from him, if it were possible; it being a dreadful Cup for his inno∣cent flesh and blood to drink, he being as sensible of pain in his body, as we are in our bodies: and when he cryed out, saying, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? and, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: I say again from the Lord, that Elias by Commission from this man Jesus, was that Father that he thus cryed unto in his mortality, E∣lias being then in glory; and the chief ground of all those actions, and sufferings, and cryings out of the Lord Jesus in the condition of a creature, unto a Father or a Creator, was to fulfil the Scriptures foretold by his Prophets in the time of the Law: therefore he said, Heaven and Earth shall pass, away, but my word shall not pass away: again, but you may say unto me, did God the third day rise from the dead by his own power, or by the power of his Deputy Elias? to which I answer, he by his own decree, and spiritual compact with Elias, and by that spirit of Faith in his innocent body,
the which Faith died in his pure body, and quickned immedi∣ately and brought forth at the appointed time, that natural innocent body out of the grave a pure spiritual body, which naturally (at the time appointed) ascended into glory; for, it was impossible for God by death to be held in the grave; because his person being pure, his pure spirit and death could not remain together, because there was no sympathy or a∣greement or union between them; yea, they were so con∣trary, it was impossible for them to be together, except one of them were absolutely extinguished; wherefore death be∣ing too weak, the Lord Jesus, who is the only God of all crea∣ted life, brake through death, and hell, and the grave, and through all the sins of his Elect, by the shedding of his most precious blood, and so entred into his eternal glory, that all those that have Faith in his glorious person may be delivered at the appointed time, from sin, hell, death, and the grave, and enter into eternal glory with him when he comes in the clouds of Heaven. Again, the reason why mens bodies in death, or after death, do rot or stink in the grave, and come to dust, is, because there was sin in their bodies whilst they lived, the which sin and death had a sympathy, and as it were a sweet communion together, whereby death had full power as Lord and King to keep the spirits and bodies in the dust, until the time appoin∣ted of the Lord of life: but on the contrary, if men had no sin in their natures or bodies, they might life, and die, and na∣turally rise again, by their own power, in their own time, as the Lord of life did, whose body was too pure to see cor∣ruption. Thus unto you that have Faith in the Lord Jesus, it is not strange, that Elias should represent the person of God the Father, until the Lord Jesus ascended into the right hand of all power and glory of his Father Elias again: then when Jesus was set down in the Throne of the glory of the Father again▪ Elias then as a glorified creature, did return all praise and glory unto the Lord Jesus his Creator: so that now it is the Lord Jesus alone, by his holy Spirit, that revealeth all spi∣ritual and heavenly wisdom to elect men and Angels; Elias having now with exceeding joy, surrendred up his spiritual
and glorious stewardship of representing the person of God the Father, unto the right owner, and sole Heir of Heaven, and Earth, and all therein is, the Lord Jesus Christ, the eter∣nal Father, God alone, blessed to all eternity: I know I have spoken enough to the spiritual Christian of this Truth. IX. AGain, I declare by Revelation from the Holy Spirit, that about this fourteen hundred years there hath not been one true Prophet nor Minister, sent with a Com∣mission from the Lord Jesus, to declare, or write, or preach the everlasting Gospel of truth and peace unto his Elect: Wherefore I declare (by vertue of my Commission, received by voyce of words from the Lord Jesus) that all the Mi∣nistry in this world, whether Prophetical or Ministerial, with all the worship taught by them, whether invisible or visible to the people, it is all a lye, and an abomination unto the Lord; both the Ministry and their worship are as acceptable unto my God, the man Jesus that sent me, as the cutting off of a dogs neck. Now unto you that discern truth from the Lord, I shall give you light into this truth: first I declare, that all the true Commissionated Prophets of the Lord, in the time of the Law from Moses unto John the Baptist, with all the true commissionated Apostles and Ministers of the Lord Ie∣sus, in the Gospel, they had every one of them in their Com∣mission a power given them, to set life and death before men, or to declare blessing or cursing unto men, which is all one, according to their administrations received from the Lord. A∣gain, I declare from the Holy Spirit, that the Lord Iesus did purpose within himself, to send his Messengers three times to the world, & but three times to this bloody unbelieving world, and no more, for a witnesse or testimony unto them, and to make known unto his Elect, that he alone is the only God and everlasting Father; wherefore you shall find it written, there are three bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and these three are one: again, it is written, there are three bear witnesse in Earth, the Water, the Blood, and the Spi∣rit, and these three agree in one. Again, I declare from the Holy Spirit, that those three in earth are the Lords three di∣spensations given to his Prophets or Messengers beforesaid;
the Water was the Commissions of Moses, and the Prophet under the Law; the Blood was the Commission of the A∣postles, and those Ministers of the Gospel chosen by appoint∣ment from the Lord; the Spirit, which is the third and last Witnesse, by Commission from the Lord, are those two Wit∣nesses spoken of in the Revelation, prophesied of by John the beloved Disciple of Iesus, that were to come in the last age, whose Message, or Ministery, or Prophesie, is all invisible and spiritual, cutting off, or condemning all flesh∣ly formal worshipping of an invisible spiritual personal God, taken up by vain-glorious men from the Letter of the Scrip∣ture, which were the Prophets and Apostles Commissions, because they want a Commission from the Lord. Again, I declare from the Holy Spirit, the Lord spake by voyce of word, unto his three Commissioners that he hath sent unto the VVorld; yea, I know God the Father spake unto Moses as a man speaks unto his friend, as it is written; and I know, that God spake unto the Apostles in the person of the Son, as it is written, because I know the Lord Iesus spake unto me in the person of the Holy Ghost, or Spirit, as beforesaid; only, the two former Wit∣nesses saw the person of God in part visibly, but I saw the glory of his person invisibly, or within me, because I am the Messenger of the Holy invisible Spirit. Again, Concerning those three bearing Record in Hea∣ven beforesaid; the meaning of those words are this, God from Heaven, in a three-fold name or title bear witnesse by Signes and VVonders, unto his three Commissioners, ac∣cording to their several administrations given unto them, unto Moses and the Prophets; this personal God bare wit∣nesse in the name or title of the Father; unto the holy A∣postles God bare witnesse in the name or title of the Son; and unto us his third last Messengers, God beareth witnesse, in the name or title of the Holy-Spirit, because our Com∣mission is all spiritual, we have to do only with the in∣visible spirits of men, concerning the eternal estates of men and womens persons, in the great and notable eternal Day of the Lords account; therefore instead of natural signes upon the bodies or persons of men and women, as
in the two former Commssions of the Prophets and the Apo∣stles; the Lord Iesus beareth witnesse, that he hath sent us, by spiritual Signs or Wonders, upon the spirits of those that are sealed up through our mouthes, unto eternal life and unto e∣ternal death, as many do bear witnesse, whose eyes are open∣ed at this day in England, in this great City of London. Again, This is a true testimony unto you that have faith in the Lord Iesus, that he hath sent us by his Holy Spirit, because there is none upon this earth that beareth witnesse unto that man Jesus that was crucified at Jerusalem, to be the only God and everlasting Father, but we only; as Moses, the Prophets and the Apostles bare witnesse in their times unto this Jesus, to be the only God, and alone eternal Father: but on the contrary, there is hardly a Minister in the world that con∣fesseth an invisible God, but they preach unto the people ei∣ther a God of two Persons, or a God of three Persons, that is a Monster, instead of one true personal God; or else they teach the People to worship an infinite Spirit, that is every where, without a Body or Person; but he is fain to borrow his creatures bodies to live in; that is a God of words only without any form or substance, or an infinite nothing, that never can be comprehended nor apprehended in the least by any formed creature, a cursed lying imaginary God from mans own unclean blind reason, which occasioneth all kind of blood and cruelty to be committed in this wicked world be∣tween man and man; for if men understood indeed, that there is but one only wise God, and that this God is a distinct body or person, then would men understand, that all those that are led by the voyce of the Holy Spirit of God, the man Je∣sus, to work righteousnesse in their bodies, they lived in, they only shall appear with bodies of all righteousnesse, like unto their God the man Jesus, visibly to behold face to face the glorious body of the God of all Righteousnesse for ever∣lasting world without end. Thus it is clear to the understanding of all those that are appointed to know the true God, the man Jesus unto life E∣ternal, that there is no true Ministry in the World, because they teach not the true God unto the people; therefore as it is written, they are blind leaders of the blind, there∣fore
they must needs both fall into the Ditch; Oh! it is an eternal Ditch: These are those Merchants of the Letter of the Scripture, that make the blind Nations their prey; these are those ravening Wolves that come in sheeps cloath∣ing; these are those dumb dogs in spiritual things, that bark a true Prophecy and heavenly revelation that a man d∣clares by Commission from the Lord Jesus; these are those that the Apostle Paul complained on in his time, that be∣witched the people to turn from the spiritual Gospel to the legal form, who began by the Apostle in the spirit, but were deluded by false Hypocrites to be made perfect in the flesh; these were of those Hypocrites that were in Christs time, who under pretence of long prayers devour Widows houses; these are those hypocrites that are always teaching of God what he should do for his own glory, when indeed it is their own glory, (in lusting after things that perish) they desire, when they thus pray, or preach, or prate; these are those bloody hypocrites, and workers of iniquity, that the Lord Jesus will never own, because he never sent them. X. AGain, I declare by revelation from the Holy Spi∣rit, that there is no Magistrate in this world, that bears the name of Christian, that hath any Authority or Commission from the Lord Jesus to set up any visible form of Worship whatsoever, to compel the spirits or consciences of men to how down to his image, that he had set up for his own glory, because ever since the Lord Jesus ascended into his glory, he alone is the Teacher of all his Elect by his Holy Spirit; it is truth, in the time of the Law, before God became flesh, there were many Magistrates and Priests commissionated from the Lord, to set up, and to declare the true Worship of God unto all Israel, and it was death by the command of the Lord, if the people despised to yield o∣bedience unto it, because it was the Lords Worship and no mans worship, set up from his own lying imagination, that would be a God, but he is a devil; for his creating of a Wor∣ship to deceive the people without a Commission from the Lord, and by taking the prerogative power and glory of
God to himself, who will not give his glory to another, as it is written; therefore in the Revelation, the Dragon there spoken of, is the imagination of the Beast, and the Beast is the body of the Magistrate, wherein that Dragon imagination liveth; and the false prophet there spoken of, is the Magistrates Priest, and the Image of the Beast, is that false worship set up by the imagination of the Magistrate, and the serpent-counsel of his false prophet or Priest, to deceive themselves and the people with them; therefore it is written, And all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the Book of life, of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the World: that is, all Reprobates, both rich and poor, shall bow down unto that false, idolatrous worship, set up by Heathen Magistrates, and their Heathen false prophets, the National Priests, who call themselves Christian Magistrates, and Christian Ministers, and are blindly called so by the people also: and yet both of these Devils together persecute with the sword of steel all spiri∣tual Christians under the name or title of Blasphemers, Se∣ducers, Heresie, Deceivers of the people, and such like; be∣cause the spiritual Christian cannot bow down unto that carnal Antichristian formal worship, set up by those carnal Magistrates, and their carnal Ministers beforesaid, who be∣ing both lovers of the glory of this world, loving to be honoured as gods, for that cursed heathenish idol-worship from their own invention set up to deceive themselves and those appointed to damnation with them; wherefore the Dragon Magistrate, and the false Prophet his Serpent-Mini∣sters, that committed spiritual fornication together, and all those of their own spirits, shall every one of them, in the day of the Lords vengeance burn in their spirits and bodies together as a lake of fire: those spirits and bodies that they shall appear with in the Resurrection, shall be that lake of spiritual fire and brimstone, that by the decree of the Lord Jesus shall burn together to all eternity; this is that giving her own blood to drink, who eat up the innocent as bread, and thought they did God good service, in shedding of the blood of the Lambs of Jesus, as their forefathers did; then will these Scriptures be fulfilled, And those mine enemies
that would not that I should reign over them, bring them and slay them before me: And, Go ye cursed into everlasting fire; And the Carcasses of the Rebels shall be cast out, where the worm never dies, and the fire never goes out; And To∣phet is ordained of old for the King; That Tophet is the body of man, and that King is the spirit of unclean reason in man, for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an Oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hostes, and ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet, in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of Hosts; Fill yee up the measure f your Fathers, ye Serpents, ye generation of Vi∣pers; how can ye escape the damnation of Hell? for he shall have Judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy; but the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and Murtherers, Whore∣mongers, and Sorcerers, or Astrologers, and Idolaters, and all ly∣ars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. Again, the bloody per∣secutors beforesaid, instead of feeding and cloathing the hungry Saint, quite contrary, they do not only take away the food and rayment of the Lord Jesus, in his Elect innocent Lambs; but they crucifie the Lord of life afresh, in the shed∣ding of the blood of his Believers, because they yield obedi∣ence to the spiritual Law of faith and love, or command of the Lord Jesus, either by Prophecying or writing, or speaking the Truth by command from the man Jesus, who is the only spiritual Magistrate and Minister unto all that are appointed unto eternal glory with him, in that glorious Creation of that new Heaven and new Earth above the stars, when this crea∣tion beneath the stars is utterly destroyed, and fitted only for persecuting Dragon-Serpent-Devils to lament, howl, and weep to all eternity, upon this earth, where the Saints by them were put to grief for a moment. XI. BUt some may say unto me, do you not allow of the ci∣vil Magistrate to govern the rude people? To this I answer; The Magistrate is very needful in every inhabited Land, for the government of the People in all civil things, to do equal justice between man and man: if such a Magistrate could
be found, it would be a rare thing. Again, I declare from the Holy Spirit, although the Magistrate be but a heathen Ruler, as he is; wherefore Christ said of this Magistrate, unto his Apostles, the Kings or Princes of the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them, and they that exercise Authority upon them, are called Benefactors, but ye shall not be so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger: yet I say from the Lord, the Ma∣gistrate beareth not the Sword in vain, but he is a type of the true spiritual Magistrate, that can do nothing but equal Justice between the just and the unjust the Lord Jesus Christ. Where∣fore, all men ought to yield obedience to the civil Laws of the Magistrate, either by executing of his Lawes, or patiently by bearing the curse of the Law upon their own persons, leaving all vengeance unto God, or else they rebel against God, and they are in danger of an eternal curse, because the govern∣ment of this world and the glory thereof belongs only unto the wise and prudent heathen Magistrates in this Earth, who are the very sons of Cain, that old Serpent-Dragon-Devil, that slew his righteous Brother Abel, that he and his Seed that are of his own spirit, might be the Lords and Rulers of this world for ever; because Cain thought, and his dark An∣gels thinks that there is no world at all, but this only; they have purchased the Lordship of this perishing world at a dear rate, for it was the price of the innocent blood of righteous Abel, it is their only heaven. Therefore let us that have re∣ceived faith to believe in the glorious person of the Lord Je∣sus, by his power patiently suffer the cursed spirit of Cain in his heathen Magistrates, to shed all our innocent blood, if our God will have it so, that they may fill up the measure of their fathers sins, from the blood of righteous Abel and the holy Prophets, to the precious blood of the Lord Iesus, and the holy Apostles, that our blood that are the two last Wit∣nesses and Prophets of the Lord Iesus, may make the last per∣secutors of Christians compleat Devils, with their Father Cain, who was the first bloody persecutor of the first suffer∣ing Christian; therefore it is written, that Christ was a Lamb slain from the beginning of the world, he being slain in be∣lieving Abel. I say from the Lord, by the power of his Holy Spirit, patiently let us yield up our lives with our God, unto
those perishing gods beforesaid; because we that suffer with him are appointed to enter into an eternal Kingdom of glory in another world, hid from the wise and prudent Rulers of this vanishing world, therefore it is written, which of the Rulrs have believed in him? again, as it is written, Why do the heathen then so furiously rage together, the Kings of the earth stand up, and the Rulers take Counsel together, against the Lord and against his anointed, or against his Christ. A∣gain, as it is written by Paul, howbeit, we speak wisdom a∣mong them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the Princes of this world, that come to nought. Again, it is written, which none of the Princes of this world knew; for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. Again, that world that we are to reign in▪ after we have suf∣fered, it was purchased also by blood, but it was the price of the precious unvaluable undefiled blood of our God the man Jesus, who by his Holy Spirit that sent us only, maketh us willing to taste a little of his Cup that he so deeply drank of: the servant is not greater then the Master, because we are to sit down with him upon his eternal Throne of glory, to be∣hold his face, in the presence of all his holy Angels; then these Scriptures will be fulfilled, Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousnesse sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Again, Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you false∣ly for my sake, rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven; for so persecuted they the Prophet which were before you. Again, Then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Again, For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his An∣gels, and then he shall reward every man according to his works. Again, Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: Again then shall he say unto them on the left hand, Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.
XII. AGain, I declare by Revelation from the Holy Spi∣rit, that since the fall of our first Parents, that the spirit and body of man are both mortal, and that by the De∣cree of the Creator, the soul and body of man are both pro∣created or begot together, and they are both of one nature, and so both but one Creature; for it is the invisible spirit that liveth in the seed and nature of man, that by the Decree of God creates or begets that form of flesh in the person of a man or woman according to their kind: and thus it is with this whole Creation, every seed or spirit naturally, by the wisdom of the Creator brings forth their own bodies or kind, whether Man, Beast, Fish, or Fowl, and all things else that grows, naturally brings forth in their season according to their natures: because the Creator by his secret Counsel and Wisdom decreed within his glorious Person, before any thing was created or formed by him, that all things or Crea∣tures that should be created or formed by his infinite Wis∣dom, should bring forth their own bodies or kind only, and no other for ever: therefore, when men and beasts seeds, are unnaturally mixt together, contrary to their kind the Lord discovers them both to their destruction, and his glory. Wherefore, I declare from the Lord Jesus, and it is a cursed Imagination in any man to think when men die, their spirits may go into other forms and bodies, contrary to their own natures or kind; as many a cursed lying Atheist prates, that denyes the Resurrection of mens bodies, through the love of some dark fleshly lust they live in: They are in spiritual darknesse, understanding nothing of the power of God, and so erring, not knowing the Scriptures, as it is written, nor the power of God; therefore, it is a common thing for these blind Atheists in their discourse, to say, when men die, their spirits may, or do go into a Horse, or into a Root, or into a Flower, with many more such like cursed expressions, they being more ignorant, if it be possible, of the Lord Jesus, through the love of fleshly pleasures, then the brute beasts; therefore they reason against their own reason, and say, this Creation or VVorld had never any beginning, nor never shall have any ending, two cursed lyes.
Again, They call perishing nature God, or Creator, say∣ing, God is all things, and all things is God: Thus these blaspheming Devils, liken the incorruptible Spirit of God the man Jesus, not only uto the unclean spirit and cursed imagination living in the body of corr pt man, but unto the spirits of unclean beast, and creeping things, as those Atheists in the time of Paul: These are those who received the truth to prate of it only, but not in the love of it having pleasure in unrighteousnesse, therefore given up to strong delusions to believe a lie, that they might all the damned, then these Scriptures will be fulfilled, He made all things for his own glory, and the wicked for the day of wrath. Again, He shall come in flaming fire to render vengeance upon them that know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus hrist: Again, But these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things they understand not, and shall utterly perish in their own corruption: Again, Haing eyes full of adul∣tery, and that cannot cease from sin, beguiling unstable souls, an heart they have exercised with covetous pactises, cursed children, which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousnesse: Again, Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame, wandring stars, to whom is re∣served the blacknesse of darknesse for ever: Again, And also Enoch the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, be∣hold, the Lord cometh with ten Thousands of his Saints, to exe∣cute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungod∣lily committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sin∣ners have spoken against him. XIII. AGain, Unto you that see by the Eye of Faith, from the Lord, I shall shew you that general Error amongst men, concerning the spirit of man in death; some say the spirit dyeth not at all, but immediately goeth into Heaven or into Hell and the body goes to the dust only; others say, the spirit dyeth not, but goeth into another form either of man, or some other creature as beforesaid; others say, or think all mens spirits go into a Hell or Purgatory when
they die for a season; others blasphemously say, that the spi∣rit of man is God, and that the body only dies and turn to dust; these say also, God is an infinite Spirit, and all spi∣rits came from his Spirit, and so return into his spirit again; others say, the spirit and body, or think it turns to dust for ever: indeed, almost all men are in darknesse, because they walk by thinking only about things of eternity; but about things that perish, they think them hardly ever sure enough unto them: wherefore unto you, whose bodies are the Tem∣ples of the Holy Ghost; from the Lord Jesus, I shall declare unto you the truth of this secret; you may know, that the spirit is nothing at all without a body, and a body is nothing at all without a spirit; neither of them can live or have a be∣ing without the other: you may know it is the spirit only in the body of man, that lies, and speaks, and walks, and works, and eats, and drinks, and dies; for the spirit is a natural fire of Reason, which is that life of light, heat, or motion, that as a re kindleth life and strength through all the flesh or body of man; only the principal part of the understanding of this natural fire of the spirit of Reason, liveth in the head of man; because that is the glory of the man; so that the spirit or soul is the man, although it cannot possibly be without the form or body: wherefore when man dies, and turns to his dust, it is that natural spirit of the fire of Rea∣son, that was the life or spirit of the body that dyeth, or is quenched, and goeth out within the body, as fire goeth out in an Oven that is closed; so doth the spirit of man die with∣in his body from all sensible life, heart, or motion, until the vi∣sible coming of the Lord of life in the Clouds of Heaven at the last day: therefore it is written, Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return, when the Lord spake those words, he did not speak to the flesh or outward form or body of the man, but he spake to the inward spirit or soul that understands the words of a spirit: again, it is written, in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt dye the death: that is, if thou through dis∣obedience to my command, dost forfeit the image of thy Cre∣ation, then thou shalt see mortality or death within thy own body both spiritual and natural, and the fear of eternal death also. Thus it is clear to you that believe in the Lord Jesus, that
the spirit of man dies and turns to dust within the body; be∣cause nothing can possibly die, but it must first live; so like∣wise, nothing can possibly quicken or live again, but that which is absolutely dead, or dust, or asleep, void of all motion, heat, life, light, or sense being utterly annihilated to its self, and all other creatures, only being alive in the memory of God, that God alone the man Jesus might have all the Glory in the new creating of Mankind at the last out of dust, as he had in crea∣ting of man at the first out of dust, according to that saying in the Revelation; Behold, I create all things new, in answer to that Creation in Genesis: Thus it is with the grain or body of Wheat, except it dies, it never comes to perfection, but abides alone in the dust for ever: But on the contrary, if the spirit of life which is in the body of Wheat doth absolutely die within its body, then by the decree of God, it quickens out of death unto a new life immediately, and brings orth a glorious Re∣surrection in due season, of many bodies in the same form, like unto that which died, of the very same nature: Thus it is by the decree of the Lord Jesus, with the natural spirits of all the Elect; first they are dead in sins and Trespasses, before they are capable by the spirit or truth to live in righteousness; so likewise, the spirits of men and women must be absolutely dead, when they fall asleep in the dust, or else they were ne∣ver capable to rise again, neither in glory nor in shame; so that by the decree of God, all life, both spiritual and natu∣ral, must first enter into death, that through death, or in death, they may quicken a new life of a glorious encrease, both spiritual and natural; so that death in its place is as use∣ful for the Creators raising of glory to himself as life is in its place; this proves the truth of these Scriptures, He pour∣ed out his soul unto death: again, The soul that sins shall die: again, He cyed with a loud voyce, and gave up the ghost: a∣gain, In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt die the death: again, His soul was made an offering for sin: again, He was put to death in thy flesh, and quicked in the spirit. I know I have written enough to satisfie (in the proof of this truth) all spiritual Christians.
XIV. AGain, it is written, and those that sleep in Jesus shall rise first; that is, those that fell asleep in the believing of the visible coming of the glorious person of the Lord Jesus in the clouds of Heaven in power and great glory, their bodies shall be raised first out of the sleep of death, be∣cause they were united by faith unto the person of their Lord Jesus, who was the first that ever rose from the dead by his own power, who raised life in death or out of death; there∣fore he was called the first fruits of the resurrection, or of life from death: again, you that see by faith my understand, that not the same bodie that died or fell asleep shall appear any more at all, then the body of wheat doth as beforesaid, which Paul fitly compareth together in their resurrection, where it is written, but God giveth it a body as it pleaseth him, and to every seed his wn body, that is as beforesaid, that grain or body of wheat that died, quickened a new life out of death, and brought forth in a glorious manner in due season, many bodies of the same form of that that dyed, and yet that body that died appeared no more: so likewise it shall be with all that died in the faith of Jesus, not the same bodies or persons they lived in, and died in, shall appear again any more, but that spirit of faith mixt with pure love, and all other spiri∣tual vertues, that were in their former bodies, by the which they died unto the power of sin, and lived unto the power of righteousnesse, that divine seed of faith sowed in the former body died with the first body, & immediately quickned a new life out of death by the decree of the Lord Jesus; for you know there is no time now unto God, nor unto them that are dead, and so brought forth a spiritual body in its orm like unto that in the dust; yea of a body of pure righteous∣ness, the same nature of that holy spiritual faith, that raised it out of death; yea, a glorious body, brighter then the Sun in its strength, and as swift as thought, yea, bodies of such a bright burning glory, that no persecuting Canaanites can behold and live, because our spirits and bodies according to our faith, and shall be made like unto the glorious body of God the man, Jesus, the which no man in mortality with his natural eye, can behold and live: then shall all the Elect in
the twinkling of an eye, both those that slept in the dust, and those that are alive at that time, whose bodies also shall be changed like unto those that slept; then I say, they shall all ascend together as one body, to meet their Head, the Lord Jesus in the Aire; and with their King they shall enter into his Kingdom of eternal glory, where that new Heaven and new Earth are beforesaid, there with holy Angels to behold the glorious face of the only wise God, and everlasting Fa∣ther, the Lord Jesus Christ, with new glorious songs and praises unto their Redeemers that was dead, as it is written, to redeem us by his precious blood from eternal death; and now behold be liveth for evermore, therefore we eternally live with him. XV. AGain, I declare by revelation from the Holy Spi∣rit, that when the Elect are thus glorified, they are absolutely of the very same glorious nature both in spirit and body as God is; as God and they were both of one na∣ture in mortality, sin only excepted: wherefore as the spirit of faith and love, infinitely in the glorious person of God, overfloweth as a fountain, continually with revelation of new Heavenly wisedom, from whence flows new joys and glory to himself, and the holy Angels; so shall every Belie∣ver according to his degree in glory, be as a Well springing up unto everlasting life, of revelation of new wisedom, from whence flows new joys and glory within his own person, like unto his God; only they shall naturally returne the glory and praise unto their fountain the Lord Jesus, for this their exaltation upon the glorious Throne of his own likenesse; for it is the righteous actings and sufferings that was in the innocent body of the Lord Jesus when the was in mortality, that by his infinite wisedom is made naturally that glorious fire to kindle new Revelation of Heavenly wisdom with in his body, for the increase of his glory to all eternity as before∣said; so likewise all those righteous actings and sufferings for truth sake, that were acted and suffered in our former bodies, by the appointment of our God, shall be conveyed into our new spritual bodies, that are like unto our God, and shall be that glorious fire naturally to kindle revelation of new
wisedom, from whence flows glorious new songs and prai∣ses unto our Redeemer the fountain of all our glory, for e∣verlasting world without end, as abundantly beforesaid; then shall these Scriptures be fulfilled, to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne: Again, and he that over∣cometh and keepeth my words unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations, and be shall rule them with a Rod of iron, as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers▪ even as I re∣ceived of my Father; and I will give him the morning star: Again, him that overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he shall go no more out, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the City of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God, and I will write up∣on him my new name: Again, he that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son: Again, hence∣forth I will not drink of this fruit of the Vine, until that day I drink it new with you in my fathers Kingdom: Again, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witnesse, and the first begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth: Unto him that hath loved us, as washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his Fa∣ther, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen. XVI. AGain, from the holy Spirit, I shall shew you the difference between elect men and Angels in glory: the Angels natures or spirits being pure Reason, they must always be supplyed by Revelation from the spirit of faith in the person of God, to keep their spirits in pure obedience unto their Creator: but on the contrary, the Be∣lievers Spirits being of the very same divine nature of God, they are but one voice or spirit, speaking all pure obedience within themselves unto their Redeemer, to whom alone be all Glory and praise from my Spirit, with his Elect men and Angels to all eternity. FINIS.
A Letter presented unto Alderman Fouke, Lord Mayor of London, from the two Witnesses and Prisoners of Jesus Christ, in New gate, as an eternal witness unto him; with a Declaration unto the Recorder Steel, and the Lord Chief Justice Rowles, with the whole Bench and Jury; and in general unto all Civil Ma∣gistrates and Juries in the World. Iohn Reeve, and Lodowick Muggleton, the two last Spiritual Wit∣nesses, and true Prophets, and only Ministers of the e∣verlasting gospel, by Commission from the holy Spirit of the true God, the Lord Jesus Christ, God and man, in one Person, blessed to all Eternity. BY vertue of our Commission received by voyce of words from the glorious mouth of the onely true God upon the Throne of Glo∣ry the Lord Iesus Christ; we shall make mani∣fest unto men, what the foundation is of the power of the Civil Magistrate, and that he ought not to meddle with spiritual things, which God hath re∣served himself, not allowing any man to touch them upon pain of eternal death, but those onely by him anointed for that purpose: First, we de∣clare that the Scriptures were given by Inspiration of the Holy Spirit; therefore except the Mag∣strates were inspired with the same Spirit as those that speak the Scriptures, they ought not to judge any man by them, but ought rather to yield obedi∣ence themselves unto. Holy Writ, or they must pe∣rish to eternity. Again, we declare from the Ho∣ly
Spirit, that since God became flesh, no Civil Magistrate hath any Authority from above to bee the Judge of any mans faith, because it is a spiri∣tual invisible gift from God, that gives a man assu∣rance of everlasting life; but the Magistrates Au∣thority is to judge the Civil Lawes of the Land, which is grounded onely upon Reason; but the things of Eternity are from God, who is from Eter∣nity to Eternity, therefore Faith is the Evidence of things hoped for, and reason is judge of things that are visible: As for you that are skilful in the Law of Reason, as soon as you hear an Action to be a breach of the Law, you understand presently what punishment belongs to the Fact; therefore the A∣postle saith, the Magistrate is the Minister of God for good to them that do well, and a terrour to the evil doer: Again, wee declare from the Lord▪ that no Magistrate by his power from the Law of Reason, ought to usurp the Law of Faith into his Authority, because the Law of Reason is utter ignorant of the Law of Faith, the one being carnal, and the other being spiritual; therefore what Ma∣gistrate soever takes upon him to be the judge of us, who are the Messengers of Faith in the true God, they are enemies to the Lord Jesus Christ, and shall surely perish to eternity: Again, from the Lord Jesus wee forewarn you that are Magi∣strates, before it is too late, that you tread not in the Lord Mayors steps, presumptuously to take up∣on you to judge this Commission of the two edged sword of God put into our mouths, which if you are left so to do, it will cut you in sunder from the
presence of our God to all eternity; for our God is a consuming fire, who did pronounce us cursed to eternity, had we not obeyed his voyce; therefore we perfectly know who ever is left great or small to speak evil of this Commission, which God hath put unto us, by calling it blasphemy, delusion, a devil, or lie, in so doing, they have sinned against the Holy Ghost, and must perish soul and body from the presence of our God, Elect men, and An∣gels, to all eternity; for God hath chosen us two onely, and hath put the two edged sword of his Spirit into our mouths, as beforesaid, that whom we are made to pronounce blessed, are blessed to eternity, and whom we are made to pronounce cursed, are cursed to eternity, and this power no mortal can take out of our hands, neither will out God any more give such power unto men whilst this World endures: Therefore you that are Judg∣es of this Earth, be wise and learned and meddle with those things which you know in this World onely, and call not your God to account at your bar; for who ever arraigneth a Prophet at his Judgement Seat, it is all one as arraigning his God, for a Prophet commeth in the name and power of his God; therefore he that despiseth the Prophet, despiseth him that sent him. Again, we declare from the Lord Jesus, if any Magistrate pre∣tends to be a Preacher of the Gospel, he having no Commission from our God so to do; if he preach any more after we forbid him, then we have full power to pronounce the sentence of eternal death upon him, and it is so unrevocable: Again, we
declare from the Lord Jesus, that the cause why so many Magistrates and Ministers must suffer the vengeance of eternal death, is because with one consent they fight against the true Messengers of God, with the temporal Law invested upon them by men: Again, woe would have been unto U  wee had come in our own name; but wee know that God sent us, as sure as he sent Mo∣ses, the Prophets, and the Apostles, and that great Authority, as to be Judges of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, wee onely are invested withal: Wherefore you Magistrates that are not yet under this sentence of eternal death from the Lord Jesus, our counsel is, if you desire blessedness in the life to come, that you would not meddle to be the Judges of spiritual things, knowing you have no Commission from the Lord; remember the coun∣sel of Caiphas the High Priest, if it be possible, and prevent the Lord Mayors eternal curse. SIR, THe 15. of September, 1653. you may re∣member by vertue of your Warrant wee were brought before you, not being guilty of the breach of any civil Law, the man Jesus our onely God, elect men and Angels, will beare us witness too: but we being accused of words only in relation to a Commission received from our God by voice from Heaven; it was your pleasure to commit us unto Newgate, as the only offenders in this world, notwithstanding I gave you a full ac∣count of the Lord Jesus speaking unto me by voice
of words, three morning together, commanding me to deliver this his wonderful and strange mes∣sage unto Magistrates, Ministers, and people, con∣cerning his blessing or cursing them to eternity, ac∣cording to their obedience or disobedience unto this dreadful message of the Lord: and Sir, you may remember that I told you, that  desired the Lord Iesus that I might not be his messenger of such sharp tiding unto men; and but for this my desire the Lord Iesus by voyce of words did say, that my body should be my hell, and my spirit should be the Devil that should torment to eterni∣ty, if I did not obey his command, in declaring his pleasure unto men: and who was I, poor mortal clay, that I should withstand the great and glorious Potter of Heaven and Earth, the Lord Iesus Christ my God alone blessed to all eternity? Again, Sir, You may remember, you did aske us divers questions concerning our God, and our answer unto some of your questions were judged as blasphemy; but we told you that you had no Commission from our God to be the judge of spi∣ritual things, that are eternal in the world to come; but you by Commission from men are the judge of temporal things, onely in this perishing world: and we onely are the judges, of spiritual things, that are eternal in the world to come, by a Commis∣sion from the Throne of Glory, from the glorious mouth of our Lord Iesus Christ. Sir, if there were any sparke of heavenly light shining in your understanding from the Holy Spirit of Christ Iesus, then you should know in due time
that what I have been made to write in this paper, is as true as God is Truth; but now it is too late, your time is past, because my God hath no delight in your person, therefore he hath left you, as he did King Saul, to commit that unpardonable sinne against the Holy Ghost, or Spirit that sent us: First, by your denying the Lord Jesus to be the only God: Secondly, you may remember, like a cursed Blas∣phemer against the Lord Jesus Christ, God and Man in one person blessed to eternity, you denyed that ever the eternal God became flesh, man, or creature, or that God is in the person of a man at this time in Heaven or Glory. Again, Sir, you may remember when you were questioned by us, what your God was; your an∣swer was, that he is an infinite Spirit▪ but you could not describe him to be in any essential form or person: Truly I doe not marvel at your igno∣rance, because you are the seed of the Serpent Re∣probate Angel that was cast out of Heaven, reser∣ved in Chaines of darkness or unbeliefe, that you may worship a God of words onely, instead of the true personal God, untill the Judgement of the great Day: my God, the Man Iesus in glory hath given you your portion already, the penny of this world, your soules chiefe delight: make your life that is put a moment as pleasant as possible you can, seeing it is all the Heaven you are like to enjoy, as sure as there is a God. Again, Sir, this I know, by revelation from the Holy Spirit, that in the world to come, you shall never see the glorious face of our God the Man
Iesus: because before many Witnesses you said that God hath no face at all. Sir, once more unto your own person, because you have blasphemed against the glorious person of our onely wise God the Man Iesus, and against the Sacred Scriptures that renders all glory from elect men and Angles to him alone, both in Heaven and in Earth, and against the Holy Spirit that sent us, and for your unjust committing of us unto your prison of Hell, to satisfie the malice of cursed accusers of your spi∣rit, that you might prevent (if it were possible) the very purpose of God: Wherefore in obedience un∣to our Commission received from the Holy Spirit, from the presence of our only wise God and ever∣lasting Father, the Man Iesus, elect men and Angels, we pronounce you cursed and dammed soul and body to eternity: this is a seale unto you from the Lord Iesus, and a warning unto all persecuting spi∣rits; until the great and notable Day of the eternal vengeance of my God, then shall your own body by your prison of Hell, and your Angelical proud and envious spirit shall be the Divel that shall burn within your body more intolerable then any natu∣ral fire in this World, and your body shall burn more fiery then any natural brimstone; your spi∣rit and body being barr'd close prisoners together in utter darkness, never seeing the face of God, men, or Angels, nor your own face or person, for everlasting, as aforesaid. FINIS.
