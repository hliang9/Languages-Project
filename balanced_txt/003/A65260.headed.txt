MEMOIRES OF THE FAMILY OF THE Stuarts. And the Remarkable Providences of GOD towards them; IN An Historical Account OF THE LIVES Of those His MAJESTY's Progenitors of that Name, that were KINGS of SCOTLAND. Fallitur egregio quisquis sub principe credit Servitium: Nusquam libertas gratior extat Quam sub rege pio— Claudianus. LONDON, Printed by J. Wallis for Walter Kettleby, at the Bishop's-Head in St. Paul's Church-yard, 1683.
THE PREFACE. THough by the Providence of him by whom Kings reign, the most Ancient and Un∣conquer'd Crown of Scotland hath continued by Succession (maugre all Opposition) in the Heirs of the Royal Fergus, the first King of Scotland; whose Inauguration was about 330 Years before the Incarnation of the Blessed Jesus: Yet some Translations there have
been, for want of Heirs Male; and by inter-marriages some later Families of their Ancient and War-like Nobility have been graf∣ted into that Royal Stock, and have thereby grown up to bear that Virgin Crown. The STƲARTS were the last that were Honour'd in this kind, of whom there have not been many Kings, yet all of them so Good, so Vertuous and Wise, that no History whether Sacred or Civil, can paralel the Succes∣sion. The Various Dispensations of
God towards them (especially in their Dangers and Deliverances,) may in a great measure be seen in this ensuing Mirrour. As for the Occurrences in Po∣litical Affairs, since the day of our happy Union of Crowns; in James the Sixth of undying Me∣mory, though it be true, we may in them be furnish'd with more Instances of signal Preservations than from former Ages; and tho' God in our late miraculous Re∣volutions, as also in those extra∣ordinary Qualifications conferr'd upon our Kings, adequate to the weight of a Prince's Crown, hath
evidenc'd a special regard to, and approbation of Kingly Govern∣ment: Yet in regard our English Histories do abound with the Remarks and Memoirs of those times to supply the Defects of our Memories, it would appear an over-acted Design to lanch fur∣ther into other Mens Labours, than what I have here offer'd to View, and would rather seem to Encumber than Accommodate the Age we live in. If it shall appear strange to any that these Posthumous Sheets, She-Orphan-like be expos'd in the World without the Reputa∣tion
or Protection of some Ho∣nourable Patron. It is not for want of Persons that would willingly and could truly have Dignified the Endeavours of our Deceased Authour by suffering their Names to be prefixed hereto; but because the Design having relation only to the Ancestors of our King, I feared an alienation of its Dedi∣cation might look injuriously up∣on the Royalty of his Sacred Majesty, to whom alone, with his most Illustrious Brother, I ima∣gine the Right of Patronage doth belong: But so little is my esteem of my Self, and so great my Veneration for Royal Majesty,
that I dare not think my self worthy to offer any thing, (tho' the best I have) at his Feet: Which Consideration alone hath diverted me from the thoughts of a Dedication. Yet I hope, in recommenda∣tion of the Work, I may tell the World that the Author was a Native of Scotland, and so may be thought no Stranger to the History of his own Countrey: His early Merits advanced him at the Age of Twenty Three, to be Preacher at the Cannigate in Edenburgh, about the Year 1636. that by no worse interest than
that of the Learned Spotswood: Here he continued not long, be∣fore the Scottish Covenant (so Fatal to all Loyal and Religious Men) forc'd him for the secu∣rity of his Life and Loyalty, to retire from that Honourable and Advantageous Imployment, to Lon∣don, whither the Storm pursu∣ed him; The Presbyterian Facti∣on so Embroiling the Affairs of that Blessed Prince, Charles the First, (whose Memory is too great and too good to be in∣termixt with the common Histo∣ry of the Age) that they soon reduc'd him from his Princely Estate, wherein he was always
ready and willing to afford Pro∣tection to his Friends, to so Low a fortune, that he, the best of Kings, could in his Three King∣doms find no place of Safety or Defence for himself. All that our Author could then acquire, was a presentation to a small Vicarage in Norfolk, as I suppose, in the King's hands, Sir Thomas Corbet, a Young Gen∣tleman of an Ancient and Honour∣able Family the Patron of it, be∣ing then a Minor and his Maje∣sty's Ward. Here he lived in Repute with
all good Men for his Eminency in Learning, Loyalty, and Reli∣gion, until the exrraordinary re∣spects and affections of the honest and loyal Gentry provok'd the malice of the Rebellious Committee against him, and that place could afford him no longer security. Then by the favourable Recom∣mendation of Lieutenant-Colonel Bendish, one of his Majesty's Deputy Lieutenants, and Alder∣man of Norwich, a great lover of Loyalty, Religion, and Learning; (to whom greater Acknowledge∣ments are due,) he was remov'd to Kirkby Cane, a Rectory in the same
County, in the Gift of Richard Cateline Esq; a Gentleman whose Sufferings were too severe Testi∣monials of his Fidelity to his Prince, and his whole Life a Contexture of great Prudence, Piety, and Charity: Amongst the many blessings that attended his Life, it was not his least happiness that he was the Father of the present Sir Nevil Cateline, who was his Eldest Son that surviv'd the Calamity of the Civil War; a Gentleman he is whose Vertues are sufficient Indications of his Birth, he Inheriting not only the outward fortune, but also the in∣ternal Noble and Generous Qua∣lifications
of his Parents Minds; and though he may seem to have stept before some of his Ance∣stors in Titles of Eminency, yet none that rightly knows him, can think his Titles keep equal pace with his Merit. Here he spent a dozen Years and upwards in a Retir'd and Pious Solitude, (living in great Regard and Esteem with his good Patron, and is not yet dead in the memory of his Son) until the happy Restauration of His Sacred MAJESTY, when True Religion and Loyalty might un∣mask themselves, and with their
Primitive Confidence look into the World: Then having wea∣ther'd out the Storm, at the first appearance of the Long-benighted Sun, he resorted to London to Congratulate the Joyful Change in National Affairs; he had the Honour to kiss His Majesty's Hand, and receive some further assurances of his Bounty; but returning in a Pleonasm of Joy, he expir'd in the Extasie without any more marks of Royal Favour upon him. He left these loose and unpolish'd Papers behind him, doubtless design'd, tho' not perfected, to be offer'd to His Majesty, as a Congratulation
of his Return to his Three King∣doms: But that opportunity be∣ing lost, I have since thought them no better than Useless Pa∣pers, until lately perusing of them, and Reflecting upon the Scepti∣cism of some Polititians, and the Incredulity of all disaffected and discontented Minds, not to be convinc'd of Day-light by the brightest Beams that ever darted from the Sun; I was induc'd to believe that the Idiome and Ex∣uberance of the matter and Phrase being a little corrected, an Epi∣tome might be extracted not un∣delightful nor unuseful for the
present Age: Being an Age wherein great Attempts have been made against the Succession so long uninterrupted; and the Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, though never so Sacred, have all been disputed, by Men of so loose and disloyal Principles; that could they effect their Designs upon those Supports to an Hereditary Crown; would not easily be per∣suaded to give over attempting till they have Extirpated, not only the Royal Line, but Royal∣ty and Monarchy it self; Nor can the most Christian Charity think otherwise, when we see ma∣ny
of those very Men to be great Sticklers, and all of their per∣suasion to be great Favourers of the Design; who thought they had once effectually done it be∣fore, and now by the Terrors of a guilty Conscience, are Stimula∣ted to repent the Wickedness, not thinking themselves easie or safe under the protection of a Family which they have so Barbarously and so Inhumanly Affronted, tho' perhaps the greatest instance of Royal Clemency and Mercy that History affords: And certainly that single act of Barbarity committed against the Sacred Person of our
late Martyr'd Sovereign, were there nothing else in their whole practice, is enough to sully the fairest Fucus to confute their best Arguments for the support of their pretended Zeal, and to render their very Principles Odious and Abominable to all reasonable Men in future Ages. The Perusal of these few Re∣marks or Historical Observations, (full of Loyalty and Impartia∣lity) together with a Reflection, not only upon the Restauration of His Majesty to the Honours and Dignities of His Three Crowns, but also upon those Deliverances
which bear a later Date and are fresh Instances of Mens Disloyalty, of our King's great Wisdom, and God's peculiar Providence over him: These things (I say) taken into Serious Consideration, may afford Men a Convincing prospect of the Folly as well as the Im∣piety of all Attempts against a Throne of Divine Establishment, and that attested by so many mi∣raculous Deliverances and Preser∣vations: All that the People do is but to imagine a vain Thing. That God who hath set the Crown upon his Head will enable him to break all their Bonds asunder, and to
cast away their Cords from him: Yea, he that dwelleth in Heaven shall laugh them to scorn, the Lord shall have them in derision. THE PRAYER. COntinue, O gracious God, to be thus Propitious to thine Anointed, our Sovereign Lord King CHARLES the Second, and grant that there may never want One
of that Royal Family to set upon his Throne so long as the Sun and the Moon endure.
THE LIFE OF ROBERT II THE FIRST Of the Royal Family of Stuarts Kings of Scotland. RObert the Second of that Name, descen∣ded of Walter High Stewart of Scotland in the days of King Malcolme, came in the Right of his Mother (Sister to King David, and Daughter to King Robert Bruce to Sway the Scottish Scepter, and was the First of the Stuarts on whose head that unravished C was Set, about the Year 1371. and the 55th of his Age. In the beginning of his Reign a French Am∣bassadour sent by Charks the Fifth of France, arriveth in Scotland to Congratulate his coming
to the Crown, and to renew the Antient League between the two Crowns of France and Scotland, and to invite the Scots in persuance of an Article in the same League, to raise an Army against England, of purpose to force home some or most of the English Forces then making War in France, the Antient League is without scruple renewed; and the Scots soon prevailed withal to raise an Army against the English, being pro∣voked by denyal of Justice on the Murtherer of a Scottish Gentleman, contrary to the Laws Esta∣blished for preservation of Peace amongst the Borderers; and being much more incensed by divers depredations, especially by the inroad made by the Earl Percy the Year immediately preceed∣ing, contrary to the Articles of Peace concluded for fourteen Years between the two Kingdoms. To preface the Scottish Expedition into England, Alexander Ramsey with forty choice Gentlemen, surpriseth Berwick Castle, Henry Percy Earl of Northumberland immediately Besiegeth them with 10000 well Armed men, after some few days valiant defence, the Castle is stormed, the Gar∣rison wholly put to the Sword, Ramsey the Captain in Chief only preserved. By this time the Scottish Army advanceth, and under the Conduct of James Earl Dowglass, en∣treth England by the way of Carlile, they plun∣der Penreth in the Fair time, and return very richly laden with Spoil, and with their Spoil carry home with them the Plague of Pestilence, which raged all the Kingdom over for two Years together, more furiously than ever in that Nation before.
To avenge this mischief done, Fifteen Thou∣sand English under the Conduct of General Talbot, are sent into Scotland, they spoil and plunder at pleasure, but returning laden with Booty, and Encamping nigh the Borders in a strait Valley, secure and expecting no Enemy, are suddenly surprised by 500 Scottish Horse, who giving them a Fierce Charge, put all in Confusion, some kill'd, divers taken Prisoners, the rest provide for their Safety by flight, leaving their Spoil behind them. The English finding the Wars against both Kingdoms of France and Scotland, a Burden too heavie, resolve, if possible, to make Peace with Scotland, to which effect John Duke of Lancaster, Uncle to the English King Richard the Second, is sent Ambassadour to Scotland, is honourably re∣ceived and entertained by King Robert, James Earl Dowglas is appointed Commissioner to Treat with him; a Cessation of Arms is concluded for three Years, which King Robert caused inviolably to be observed, notwithstanding of a great Ad∣vantage given him, by a dangerous Rebellion then broke out in England by the instigation of one Ball a Priest, upon occasion of a four penny Poll imposed on the People. King Robert Commandeth his Commissioner Earl Dowglass, to tender a Noble Entertainment to the Duke, the English Ambassadour, if it plea∣sed him to reside in Scotland during the said Re∣bellion, or if it pleased him, in such a dangerous Storm to return to England, to tender to him the Service of a strong Guard of 2000 men
then ready to attend him, Dowglass tendereth both: the Duke Acknowledging with all Thank∣fulness the Nobleness of the Scottish King, re∣fuseth both and sets out for England: the Gover∣nour of Berwick, I know not why, denieth him Enterance, the Duke returneth to Edenburgh, re∣sideth there, and is very Honourably Enter∣tained, with frequent Expressions of far greater Civilities than could be expected. The Three Years Truce determined in the Year 1384. Archibald Dowglass Earl of Galloway, Accompanied with James Earl Dowglass, George Earl of Merse or Marches besieges Maban Castle and after Nine Days Siege in the Cold of Win∣ter, the Castle is delivered: the Earl of Dunbar likewise surpriseth a great Booty nigh Piggin, which he conveyed to be secured in Roxborrow, then in the hands of the English. King Richard having Notice of the Scottish Stirs and Success, sendeth down a Potent Army both by Sea and Land, under the Command of the Duke of Lancaster, they spoil all to the very Gates of Edenburgh, they Enter the City, and in their Fury resolve to set it on Fire; but the Duke remembring that it had been a Sanctuary to himself in a late Danger, Nobly preserveth it, and returneth with his Army. His Army returned, Earl Dowglass immedi∣ately marcheth with an Army, and regaineth all the Castles in the English Power, Roxborrow only excepted, for which he put very fair, but that a Burning Feaver of which he Dyed, pre∣vented him.
In the mean while a Peace is Concluded in France between all the Three Kingdoms of France, England and Scotland, the French undertake to pub∣lish this Peace forthwith in Scotland, but are Ne∣gligent in it, until the News of a great havock done in Scotland after the Conclusion of the Peace, by an Army of 10000 English Horsemen, and 6000 Bowmen, under the Earl of Northumberland and Notingham, the Scots sensible of this Abuse refuse to hearken to Terms of Peace, notwith∣standing the earnest desire of their King to em∣brace them; Dowglass, Lindsey, and Dunbar, pri∣vately withdraw from Court, raise an Army, and flying rather than marching, into England, consume all with fire and sword even to the Gates of New-Castle, return laden with Spoil, and proclaim the Peace. In the Year following, the French Admiral Jean de Vienna, landeth in Scotland with about some Two Thousand Auxiliary Foot, and an Hundred Curasiers, with Six Months Pay. King Richard of England having Notice hereof, and withal Intelligence of great Preparations making against him in France by Charles the Sixth the French King (which soon evaporated into Smoak, by the delays of the Duke of Bury) suddenly raiseth an Army of Sixty Thousand Foot, and Eight Thousand Horse, some say One Hundred Thousand Foot, and Ten Thou∣sand Horse, some Three Hundred Thousand of both, and in great Fury marcheth into Scotland, burneth and killeth all along Forty Miles, with∣out respect of Place or Person: Edenburgh and
Melrose, both Consumed by Fire, King Robert thinking it no way safe to give Battel to so great an Army, sendeth an Army into Cumberland, where they freely Wast and Spoil all. King Richard not daring to march beyond the Scottish Frith, as the Duke of Lancaster Advised him, (whom he therefore Suspected of a Trai∣terous Design against him) nor to leave the Sea Coast (having all his Stores of Provision from his Navy then attending him on the Frith) and the Winter then drawing on, re∣solveth rather to return home by the way of Berwick, than with the hazard of all, by reason of Cold and Hunger, to Pursue the Scots in Cumberland: which the Scots perceiving, with∣draw their Army at their own convenience, and return no less laden with Spoil than the great Army of the English; thus two Armies great enough are raised, invade other Nati∣ons, and return without sight one of another, the People (the common sufferers in such broils) sustaining the loss. King Robert knowing that the English could not return in the Winter Season, sendeth his Army to reduce Roxborrough, then in the hands of the English, strongly Fortified and well Gar∣rison'd, the Siege being formed, the French crave the Possession and Government of the Town, when regained, (the Scots peremptorily refuse, telling them plainly, their Service deserved no such Reward as so strong a Garrison; the Pos∣session whereof should enable them to become at pleasure, Arbitrators both of War and Peace:
the Siege breaketh up in discontent, the Scots weary of the Insolence and grievous Plunder∣ings of the French, send them fairly home, re∣taining the Commander in Chief until reaso∣nable Satisfaction made for the wast done by his Souldiers. King Richard of England now returned home, and his great Army disbanded, behold a Cloud appeareth, which breaketh out into such a storm as in the end proved his Ruin. Whilst all things are in confusion in England, the Scottish Nobility unwilling to loose the oppor∣tunity, cry out for a Vindictive Army to be raised to revenge King Richard's last years in∣human Cruelty, the good King touched with a fellow-feeling of King Richard's Sufferings, choosing rather to bear the wrong done, than to wound the afflicted; sheweth himself very averse to the Counsels of his Nobility; which his Nobles perceiving, resent it more than well beseeming them, and privately contrive an Army, without the knowledge of their King, with which they march into England: one part of their Army marcheth by the way of Carlile, under the Conduct of two of the King's Younger Sons, the Earls of Fife and Straern, the other by the way of Berwick, under the Command of James Earl Dowglass. The first Army spoileth the Countrey with∣out opposition, and returneth with Spoil enough, bought at a cheap rate.
The second hath not the like fortune, tho' it marched with such hast and secresie, that the smoak it raised in the Conflagration of Towns and Villages was its first Discovery; having spoiled the Bishoprick of Durham, Earl Dowglass resolveth to Attempt New-Castle, the Percies (in those days the most Valiant Family England had) draw their Forces thither for its Defence; some light Skirmishing there was for three days together, the two Commanders in Chief, Dow∣glass and Piercy think it worthy of their Fame to try their single Valour in view of both Armies, which accordingly they did, with incredible Gallantry on both sides, Percy is at last dismoun∣ted, Dowglass who Thirsted not after Blood but Honour, as a Noble Cavalier, doth not offer one blow to his dismounted Enemy, layeth only hold on his Spear Saying, My Lord your Spear shall home with me as the Trophee of this Noble En∣counter: and with these words Retreateth to the Van of his Army. Next day after, Dowglass draweth off the Field, and marcheth to Ottur∣burn some Eight Miles from New-Castle, where contrary to the Advice of his Council, (his Army being inferiour in number by one half to the English) he stayeth some three days attending Earl Percy his rescue of his Spear; Percy to regain his Honour, resolveth to Fight him, contrary to the Advice of all his Council too: who pre∣sumed (as they had reason) that Dowglas so Discreet and Wary a Souldier, would not hazard to give Battel to an Army so much exceeding his Number as two to one, unless he had some
considerable Forces laid in Ambush to insnare them. The two Armies the one not above Five Thousand, the other not under Ten Thou∣sand, joyn Battel in the Evening, and with va∣rious and doubtful Success, coutinued Fight almost the whole Night, by the benefit of the Light they had from the Full Moon: at last the Scots gave ground, which by the Valour of two Heburnes both Patrick by Name, was quickly re∣gained, Dowglass Chargeth so desperately with two Attendants only, Hart and Glendimung, that having evidenced incredible strength both of Spirit and Body, he falleth under the burden of many wounds, before his Forces were able to take him off, his Body is rescued when it was too late: and being ready to breath out his last when they found him, some of his dearest Friends Ask him how he did, to whom he An∣swered with marvellous good chear: I am well and in a good condition, I now Dye as almost all my Ancestors have done, in the Bed of Honour, some things only I Crave of you my Noble and Dear Friends, which I desire to be performed as you Love and Honour me; First, That my Death be no Discouragement to you. Secondly, That you Conceal my Death, during the time of the Battel both from Friends and Foes. Thirdly, That you suffer not my Standard to be overthrown. And Lastly, That you would Avenge my Death. These things if you perform I have my desire, and in hope thereof I bear all other things, and my present Fate with a good heart. With these words (wherein he shewed himself a Souldier) he takes leave of them, and they of him, and having covered
his Body from the sight of the Souldiers; they advance his Standard, and Charge with the greater Fury, crying out A Dowglass! A Dowglass! the English are forthwith put into great disorder, the Earl Percy is taken Prisoner, and in the same Charge his Valiant Son too, being dangerously wounded: some Nineteen hundred English are slain, some Fourteen hundred are Prisoners whereof most wounded, and to the Scots it was not a dry Victory. The next day the Bishop of Durham coming up with some Auxiliaries, the English Rally again, and resolve to give Battel, the Army being again made up Ten Thousand Men, the Scots making vertue of necessity (there being no possible safety for them to endeavour an Escape) resolve to stand to it, under the Command of the Earl of Murray. The Bishop advancing Murray (having first taken an Oath of all the Prisoners that they should remain true Prisoners, though their friends should rescue them by strength of Arms) is ready to receive him, and commandeth the Soldiers to wind their Horns (each Soldier having about his Neck an Horn larger than our ordinary Harvest Horns, the Noise whereof was so great, and the View of the dead Corps slain over Night so terrible, that the Hearts of the raw and new raised Soldiers began to fail, the Bishop is forced as his Safest course, to re∣treat into their Quarters from whence they came without attempting any thing; the Scots are no less glad (being sufficiently wasted and weary, to look homeward.
Murray dismisseth Percy the Younger upon his Parole, above One Thousand Common Soldi∣ers are set at Liberty, the Earl himself and about Four Hundred of the Chief are carried Priso∣ners into Scotland. The Joy the Scots had in this Victory which happen'd July 19. 1390. was wholly swallow'd up in the Death of the dougheir Dowglass, a very noble Cavalier indeed, whose Body was Interred at Melross with the greatest Evidences of Sorrow that could be. Soon after Dyed in Peace the Good and Peace∣able King Robert (a general Peace being concluded in France, England and Scotland, for certain Years) the Seventy Fourth Year of his Age, and Nine∣teenth of his Reign, a good Man, and a good King, a great Justiciary, an Encourager of Ver∣tue, a Suppressor of Vice, especially of Theft and Robery, stedfast in his Word, fortunate in his Wars, tho' by reason of his Age and Natural Averseness to War, he seldom or never En∣gaged in Person. He had two Wives, the one Elizabeth Daugh∣ter to Sir Adam More, by whom he had three Sons, John Earl of Carist, Robert Earl of Say, Alexander Earl of Buchan and Badgenoch: the other Enfence Daughter to Hugh Earl of Ross, by whom he had two Sons, Walter Earl of Straherne, and David Earl of Athol, and one Daughter Enfence, given in Marriage to James Lord Dowglass, Son to William Earl of Dowglass.
THE LIFE OF ROBERT III. JOHN son to King Robert, Succeeded his Father, and began his Reign Anno 1390. who immediately changed his Name, choosing to be called by the Name Robert, as an Auspicious Name, the former two Roberts Kings of that Nation, being men eminent in Vertue, and prosperous in Atchievements. He came to his Crown in a time free of Wars from abroad, but full of Jars at home, by the unquiet and ravenous disposition of his Nephew Duncan, Son to Alexander Earl of Buchan, who having Abased himself to be Captain of a Re∣bellious Rout of Robers, spoyling and plunder∣ing divers Places, especially in Angus, was at last, not without some Blood shed, Suppressed by the industry of the Earl of Craford.
Soon after a dangerous fend fell out between two Great and Populous Families in the North, for Reducing of whom, were sent Thomas Dunbar Earl of Murray, and James Earl of Craford, who perceiving the great mischief likely to attend their Endeavours of a forcible Reducement, con∣trived a more subtle way to quiet them, after a representation made to the Heads of those Clans, a part of the danger of their mutual Fewds, and of the Kings Wrath against both, they Ad∣vise them to conclude their Fewds as the Horatii and Cariatii did at Rome, by the Choice not of three, but of three hundred on each side, to Fight, Armed with Swords only, in the sight of the King and his Nobles; whereby the Victor should gain Honour, the Vanquished safety from further Punishment, and both re∣gain his Majesties Favour, whereof they gave them full assurance; the Proposition is embraced on both sides of St. John's Town, Mounts raised, and Galleries made for the accommodation of the Spectators, the Combatants are chosen, and on the day appointed, together with a multitude of beholders, all of them appear on the place, only one through fear, privately withdrew himself, this putteth some delay to the Encounter, the one party looking upon it as a dishonour to Fight with the other wanting one of their Number: the other Party not finding one who would Engage himself to make up their Number, de∣sire one of the Three Hundred to be put aside, but of all that Number, not one could be in∣duced to withdraw, accounting it an indelible
disgrace to be shuffled out of such a choice Com∣pany of Valorous men; at last an ordinary Tradesman tendereth his Service, desiring no greater Reward than one single piece of Gold in hand, as an honourable badge of his Valour, and an Annuity of a small Sum for Life, should he survive the Conflict, his Demands are soon granted, and immediately beginneth the Conflict with as much Fury as the height of Wrath, the insatiable desire of honour, and the fear of shame more than death could produce, to the horrour and amazement of the Spectators, whose hearts trembled within them to see (as indeed it was an horrid Sight to behold) such a rueful Sight of Furious men butchering one another, and ob∣served it was by all, that of all the Combatants none shewed more, shall I call it Valour, than the Tradesman did, who had the good Fate to survive that dismal day, and on the Conquering side too, whereof only ten besides himself out∣lived that hour, to partake with many ghastly wounds the honour of the day, the vanquished are killed on the place, all to one, who per∣ceiving himself left alone, and being without wounds, he skippeth into the River, by which means none of the surviving Victors being able to follow him by reason of their wounds, he maketh a fair Escape with his Life, thus the Heads and most turbulent of both Clans cut off, their retainers are soon perswaded to Peace, and for many Years after live quiet enough; this Fight hapned in the Year 1396.
In the Year 1398. King Robert Created his Son David at the Eighteenth Year of his Age, Duke of Rothesay, and his Brother Robert Duke of Albany, the first Honour of this kind bestowed in that Kingdom. The same Year he esta∣blished his Son Robert Governour of the whole Kingdom, preferring the quiet of a private Life to the daily Troubles which attend a publick Employment, tho' sweetned with many honours and outward respects. The Year following being the First Year of the Reign of Henry the Fourth of England, some unhappy seeds of Jarrs between the two King∣doms were scattered by George Dunbar Earl of Merse: the Daughter of the said Earl being espoused to the Duke of Rothesay, and a great part of her Dowry payed; Archibald Earl of Dowglass Excepteth in Parliament against the Espousals, as done without Consent of the Three Estates, and propounded in Parliament the Mar∣riage of his own Daughter, and with her a greater Dowry, the Parliament approveth well of the Match: and Robert Duke of Albany pre∣vaileth with the King to make void the first Espousal, and to accept the tender made by the Earl of Dowglass, both which being accor∣dingly done, the Marriage of the Earl Dowglass his Daughter to the Young Duke is Solemnised by consent of Parliament. The Earl George resenteth this as a wrong done to his Family, expostulateth the matter with the King, and remanded his Daughters Dowry, whereunto present Satisfaction not being made,
the Earl withdraweth from Court, breathing out Revenge, and immediately flyeth into Eng∣land, where he entereth into league with Earl Percy, Dowglass his sworn Enemy; and with some Force obtained from him, he returneth into Scotland and spoileth all the Lands in the Meuse belonging to Earl Dowglass; King Robert, provoked with Indignation, proclaimeth him Traitor, and dispatcheth an Herald to King Henry the 4th. of England, to require the deli∣very up of the fugitive Earl to Justice: King Henry pretendeth faith given to the Earl for Pro∣tection, and upon that account refuseth King Robert his demand; King Robert resenteth this as a breach of the Peace concluded for seven years in the days of King Richard, not yet ex∣pired; and accordingly his Council declareth it, and for this and many outrages and detestations committed by Henry Percy the younger, and by the fugitive Earl, proclaimeth War against King Henry. King Henry thinks it his wisest course to pre∣vent him, and forthwith marcheth into Scotland with a very potent Army of Horse and Foot, entereth the City of Edenburgh and layeth Siege to the Castle; Duke Robert then Governor of Scotland, prepareth for its relief, but so slowly, that every man suspected him to have some sinister design in it; King Henry finding the Castle impregnable, being garrisoned with men of honour and integrity (to whom the Macedonian Ass could have no access, though some not long since could receive his lea∣ding)
raised his Siege and returned to Eng∣land. Henry Percy and the fugitive Earl continue their plundering incursions, for repressing of whom several small Parties were sent, to small purpose; at last by the command of the Go∣vernor, Archibald Earl of Dowglass (Son to the late Earl of the same Name, so much renowned) marcheth in person against them, accompanied with divers of the Nobility, and advanceth with his Army to the very Gates of New-Castle; Percy the younger, and the fugitive Earl draw up their Army against him, and give him bat∣tel nigh Hemeldon; the Earl Dowglass after a most furious conflict, is at last overthrown, divers of the Scottish Nobility are slain, many taken Prisoners, and with them the Earl him∣self with the loss of one of his Eyes; Percy per∣sueth his Victory, entereth Scotland, and ha∣ving done some spoyl in Tiviodale, returneth to England, and prepareth for a Rebellion against King Henry: the Earl Dowglass is earnestly sol∣licited by him to joyn with him in his design, with promise of freedom; Dowglass embraceth the motion, and with some others of the Scot∣tish Prisoners performeth most gallant service at Shrewsbury battel; contemning all others; he bend∣eth himself against the person of the King only, he dismounteth first one, then another, then a third, and all in the habit of the King; (King Henry having clothed some gallant men in his own habit of purpose to encourage his Soldiers at the sight of their brave deportment) Dowglass
admiring from whence so many Kings should come, rusheth himself into the midst of his enemies, behaving himself with incredible bravery; but at last the victory falling to the King, Dowglass grievously wounded is taken Prisoner, the King very nobly taketh care of him, causeth his wounds to be cured by the best of his Chirurgions, admitteth him to his presence, highly commendeth his valour, ac∣cepteth of his ransom, and granteth him li∣berty to return to his Country where he was received with no small Joy. This storm over, Duke Robert wholly bends himself to make away the whole off-spring of his Brother the King, of purpose to make way for his own to come to the Crown: a fair op∣portunity offering it self to begin his work, Da∣vid the elder of the King's Sons giveth up him∣elfs wholly to his lusts, ravishing both Virgins and others, contemning all admonitions of his good Father, would not be reclaimed: The good King much afflicted by the dissolute life of his Son, committeth him to the counsel and care of Duke Robert the Governor; who very glad of the opportunity to commence his Trai∣terous design, chearfully snatcheth his prey into his Clutches and resolving to take a short course to reform his manners by the ruine of the man, carrieth him along with himself to St. An∣drews, from thence to Faulkland, where he coops him up in a loathsom Dungeon with a design to destroy him, by the cruel pinches of hunger; which had been speedily done, but that his mi∣serable
Life Was preserved for a Season by the compassion of two tender-hearted Women; the one a Virgin, Daughter to the Governor of the Castle, who as she came into the Gar∣den, privately conveyed under the covert of her Apron, some thin Oaten Cakes, which she gave him through a Cranny, the only convey∣ance of light into the Dungeon: The other a poor neighbouring Woman, who gave Suck, and by her Breast-milk milked into his mouth, refreshed him a little. The Duke, his merciless Uncle admiring that he heard no tidings of his death, appointed a secret Watch about him, the good Women are discovered, apprehended and punished, the poor Prince now left with∣out all manner of relief or hope of refreshment, having eat much of his own Flesh and many of his Members, miserably perished in the extremity of Hunger; a great evidence indeed of God's anger against his Lustful youth, but no less evidence of a cruel and barbarous heart in the merciless and inhuman Uncle. This Cruelty is for a time concealed from the good King, at last Time revealeth it, not without some indignation of the Author: The Duke is questioned, but by a cowardly, if not traiterous Jury pack'd by himself, acquitted; the poor distressed King, praying to Heaven for a Vengeance upon them and all their Po∣sterity who were guilty of that horrid Mur∣ther; the Duke to gloss all the better, draggeth some to Prison, Flagitious men indeed, but al∣together innocent of this Crime, condemneth
and executeth them as Murtherers of the Prince, palliating one wickedness with another, as ma∣ny other wicked men have done: The good King solicitous for his onely Son now remaining, resolveth for his greater safety, to send him over to France, to be educated in the Court of Charles the Sixth, the French King, and com∣mendeth him to the safe conduct and oversight of Lord Henry Sinclare Earl of Orkney; he setteth Sail from the Basse, and passing by Flamborrowe-head, a Storm ariseth and forceth the Ship into Harbour; the Prince afflicted with Sea-sickness, goeth on Shore, is apprehended by the English, and sent Prisoner to King Henry of England, who notwithstanding of the Mournful Letters of the afflicted King his Father (sent up of purpose some weeks before, to prevent the obstruction of his Journey,) and contrary to the Advice of the most of his Council, pleading for his Li∣berty, detaineth him Prisoner. This hard mea∣sure is in great measure recompenced by the li∣beral Education he gave him, whereby he be∣came the most Learned Prince of his time; the sad news of his Imprisonment brought to his still afflicted Father (for the loss of his eldest Son) as he sat at Supper, cut him to the Heart, and oppressed with Grief, he falleth down dead, his Company about him in vain seeking to re∣cover Life in him, they carry him to his Cham∣ber, where his Spirits revive a little; but ab∣staining from all manner of nourishment, after three days abstinence he departeth this Life, op∣prest with two cruel tyrants, Hunger and Grief,
in the 16th. Year of his Reign, April the First, 1406: A Prince of a very proper and propor∣tionable Person, a Good man and a Meek, not furnished indeed with Austerity, and such like qualities as might have rendered him more fit, than in truth he was, to Govern a People so un∣like himself in Conditions.
THE LIFE OF JAMESI. KIng Robert departed this Life, his Son James, Prisoner in England, is Proclai∣med King of Scotland, and his Uncle Robert Duke of Albany, continued by Act of Parliament in his Government; at this time a sweet calm of Peace continued between the two Kingdoms above twelve years together, a great blessing to both Nations. In the mean while, a black Cloud appeareth in the North of Scotland, Donald Lord of the Isles pretending the recovery of his Lands in Ross, which the Governor kept from him by a a trick of Law, Invadeth Ross, from thence marcheth into Murray, from thence into Bu∣chan and so to Aberdeen, doing much Mischief
all along as he went. To stop this Current, Alexander Earl of Marre, and others of the No∣bility, advance against him with such Forces as could be raised on the sudden, both Armies Encounter at Harlaw, a fierce Battel continueth for many hours, with such slaughter on both sides, that at Night, the darkness whereof was the first commander of Cessation, each Army thought it self overcome; no man appearing next day morning to claim the glory of the Vi∣ctory, onely the poor Village Harlaw, where the Battel was, is famous from it to this day. This Rebellion over, the Dauphine of France sendeth an Ambassadour to Scotland to demand Assistance against the English (according to their ancient League) then warring in France, decla∣ring with a sad Narrative, that himself was dis∣inherited, and the English King Henry the 5th. Married to his Sister the Lady Catharine, declared Regent of France in present, and Heir apparent to the Crown; with whom likewise the Duke of Burgundy had joyned his whole Force; this pitiful Letter soon quickened the Scottish No∣bility, dreading the effects of King Henry his Greatness, an Army of 7000 resolute and stout men are sent immediately over into France, un∣der the Conduct of John Earl of Buchan, Archi∣bald Earl of Wigton Son to Archibald Earl Dowglas, with whom were divers Persons of Quality; all safely arrive, and are immediately sent by the Dauphine towards Turon; the Duke of Clarence Brother to the English King, well high surpriseth them in their way, they take the Alarm nigh
Bergie, and on Easter-Eve they give Battel to the English, fought with great valour and various fortune on both sides, at last the Duke of Cla∣rence is dismounted, his whole Army routed, 2000 slain on the spot, amongst whom were the Duke of Clarence, the Earl of Kime, the Lords, Gray and Ross. Many Prisoners likewise taken, whereof di∣vers Persons of Quality, as the Earls of Hun∣tington and Somerset, and others. The Earl of Salisbury, a man of singular vertue and valour, endeavoureth to repay this loss, but could effect nothing save the recovery of the dead Body of the Duke of Clarence, which he afterwards sent over into England. After this Victory the Dauphine createth Buchan Constable of France, one of the highest Prefer∣ments in that Kingdom. In the same Year 1420, Robert Duke of Al∣bany departed this Life, and his Son Mordake established in his place, Buchan returneth from France, and is immediately recalled; he arriveth at Rochett, accompanied with Archibald Earl of Dowglas, and Five thousand Auxiliary Foot; the Dauphine much cheared up at their arrival, receiveth them with ample Gratulation, John Duke of Bedford, is sent over from England, much about the same time, with 4000 Horse and 10000 Foot, and soon after King Henry himself arriveth, and with him James King of Scotland, of purpose, by his presence to withdraw the Scots from the Dauphine, or at least to render them the more suspected to him: but he is disap∣pointed
in both, the Scots unanimously decla∣ring that they could not render whilst a Priso∣ner, the Obedience, otherwise due to him. Soon after both the French and English King depart this Life, Henry the Sixth of England about Eights Months old, is Proclaimed King of Eng∣land and France, John Duke of Bedford appointed Regent of France. The Dauphine at the same time Proclaimed by his Adherents, King of France, by the Name of Charles the 7th. The Regent advanceth against him with a powerful Army, the Duke of Alenson encounter∣eth him. Charles himself is with general con∣sent and unanimous request of all his Friends desired to withdraw, and not to hazard his Per∣son, the miscarriage whereof was an apparent ruine of them all, and giveth him Battel not far from Vornoil. The Fight continued very fierce for some hours, at last the English obtain the Victory, 4000 French and Scots killed, a∣mongst whom were John Earl of Buchan, Archi∣bald Earl Dowglas his Son, the Earl Wigton, and divers other eminent Persons; the Duke of Alen∣son and many great ones are taken Prisoners: a great Victory, and bought at a great price, the lives of above 2000 English lost on the place. The Scottish Parliament thinketh it now more than high time to endeavour the Liberty of their King; Ambasladors are sent to that end, and are honourably Entertained by the Duke of Glocester then Governing all in England, in the Non-age of his Nephew.
The Scots demand their King, the Duke ad∣viseth the English Council to Treat with them: A great Ransom is demanded: The Scots ha∣ving no other remedy, consent to Engage for it, in lieu of one Moiety the Dowry of the Scottish Queen (Joan Daughter to the Earl of Somerset, a woman of singular Vertue and Beau∣ty, taken to Wife by the Scottish King at the earnest desire of the Duke of Glocester) was de∣tained: and for the other, certain Noble Men are sent Pledges; an hard measure to an Infant Prisoner, who it seems paid Dear for his School∣gate. And thus after his Years Imprisonment, King James returneth Anno 1423; a Parliament is im∣mediately called, the King and Queen Crowned, an Act passed for the payment of the 20th. part of every man's Personal Estate, for discharging the other Moiety of the King's Ransom. Com∣missioners appointed to Collect it, the People every where repine against it, as unaccustomed to such Impositions, some Great ones hunting after the vanity of Popular Applause, cherish their Discontent, which the good King percei∣ving, remitted the Tax, finding out another Expedient to discharge his Ransom. In the same Parliament divers of the Nobi∣lity are Imprisoned for high Misdemeanors: The King immediately releaseth them; only Mordake Duke of Albany his two Sons, and his Father in Law the Earl of Lenox remained un∣der restraint; and by Sentence of their Peers (the usual manner of Trying Great ones in
that Nation) are adjudged to Death for their manifold Treasons, and were accordingly, not without the vigorous influence of Atholl, their Uncle, Beheaded on the Castle hill at Sterlin. The same Year came Ambassadors from France to renew the Antient League, and to crave in Marriage Margaret Daughter to King James, for the Dauphine of France Lodovick Son to Charles the 7th. both propositions are chearfully assented unto, and the Ambassadors after much honourable Entertainment return satisfied; the King forthwith bendeth himself to a Reforma∣tion, and great need there was, for as once in Israel, so now in Scotland, when there was no King, every man did what seemed good in his own Eyes, whereby the Kingdom groaned un∣der the greatest Confusions and Disorders that could be; the Civil Estate after much pain and trouble, is at last reduced into some tolerable Condition: Heads of Rebellious Factions men, some taken off, some Imprisoned, some in hope of amendment pardoned; Oppressions suppres∣sed, Roberies restrained, and promising foun∣dations laid to prevent such Insolence in time to come. Amongst those pardoned in hope of Amend∣ment, Alexander Lord of the Isles was one, a Great man and of a restless Spirit, no sooner enlarged, than he beginneth to meditate Re∣venge for his Imprisonment, as short as it was: He raiseth an Army of 10000 men, falleth down to Ennerness, burneth the Town to the ground and layeth Seige to the Castle; the King
sendeth an Army against him, he raiseth his Siege, flyeth to the Mountains, maketh a stand about Lough Aber, resolving to run the hazard of a Battel in those places of advantage; two great Clanns, Clan-Chaton, and Clan-Chameron, revolt from him, many others are suspected by him; in this fear he disbandeth his Army, and with a few Attendants he flyeth into the Isles: from thence he sendeth his Orators to the King, to implore his Pardon; nothing could be obtained, though the Messengers were gra∣cious enough to their Sovereign, Alexander him∣self is required to appear in Person before the King, committing himself wholly to his Maje∣sty's mercy: the Rebel conscious of his own Guilt, is much perplexed, nevertheless consider∣ing his present condition how desperate it was, resolveth to fly to Mercy; and privately re∣paireth to Edenburg, where then his Majesty was: On Easter-day Morning he Addresseth himself to Court, covered with a Flaxen Frock, he prostrateth himself before the King as he past to Divine Service, with a most humble and penitent Oration he beggeth Pardon and Restoration to his Majesty's Favour, and that for his sake, whose restoring to Life they that day Celebrated: The Time, the Place, the Habit, his mournful Oration move at present to Com∣passion, especially the Queen, who became a most earnest Mediatrix on his behalf; the King delayeth his Answer to the end of Divine Ser∣vice, which being performed, his Majesty re∣solving neither absolutely to Pardon, nor con∣dignly
to Punish, for security of the Peace Alex∣ander is sent Prisoner to Tamtalion, and his Mo∣ther, as the great Instrument of all his Pernicious ways, is sent to St. Colmes. In revenge of this Imprisonment, Donald Maloc, a Great man in the Isles, breaketh out in a new Rebellion, for Suppressing of whom the Earls of Marre and Caithnes are sent; Donald Surpriseth them, and putteth Caithnes and most of his Army to the Sword, Marre happily escaping: puft up with this Success, Donald marcheth to Loughaber; the King goeth out in Person against him; Donald having done much Mischief in the Countrey, flyeth into the Isles: Divers Heads of Clannes undertake to Suppress him; notice whereof being given to that Arch∣Rebel, he privately conveyeth himself into Ire∣land, many of his Associates are killed, 300 of them taken Prisoners, are sent to the King, all without exception of any, deservedly Hanged, which exemplary Justice proved happily, to preserve those Barbarous places in Peace for a longer time than could be expected. As his Majesty shewed his Justice in the Case I now mentioned, about the same time he gave a manifest of his Mercy, in enlarging two no∣table Robbers, Duffe and Murray; being enlarg∣ed, they quarrel one with another, Cull toge∣ther their Retainers, maintained on the Spoils of the People, and being 1200 on each side, furiously Engage in a bloody Conflict, such Ex∣ecution done on both sides, that not above to on the one, and 9 on the other side escape alive.
Notwithstanding all which Disasters, Mr. Do∣nald a notorious Robber, breaketh out into an open Rebellion; after some Mischief done, Mr. Donald is apprehended, himself Beheaded, and twelve of his Associates Hanged. Before his Execution the Law of Retaliation is by the King's special Command executed upon him. A poor Widdow pillaged by him, threateneth him with resolution to repair to the King for Re∣dress; and I will fit thee for thy Journey, said the Rogue; he calleth for a Black-Smith, and commands him to Nail to her Feet two Horse∣Shooes; go on saith he, now these will preserve thy Feet from bruising: the poor Woman dissembleth her resolution, and is dismissed: Mr. Donald being afterwards apprehended, the Widdow repaireth to his Majesty, reporteth and proveth this Insolent Trick; Mr. Donald is called for out of Prison, Horse-shooes are clap'd on himself and twelve of his Companions, and commanded to march through the Streets of Edenburgh, an Officer publishing the Cause of this strange Punishment; their tedious Journey ended, all of them are put to Death, as before mentioned: King James hearing that Maloc was under the Power of an Irish Lord, sendeth a Messenger to Ireland, to require the Lord to de∣liver him; the Irish Lord fearing his Escape, and the Anger of so War-like a Prince, resol∣veth to make all sure by cutting off the Rebel's Head, which was accordingly done and sent over to the King. The publick Robberies thus Suppressed, many good Laws are Established
for the good, and to the Joy of all the Peo∣ple. And as an addition to the Joy, two Popu∣lar Lords of the Nobility, Dowglas and Cassils; are enlarged from Prison, and received into his Majesty's favour. And for the Complement of all their Joy, the Queen is safely brought to Bed of two Sons, October 14th. 1430. The Civil Estate thus happily regulated, his Majesty thinketh of a Reformation of the Clergy, but to small purpose; they being then and in those days within the Verge of the Pope his Jurisdiction, Secular Princes durst not exer∣cise their Regal Power over them; all this good King could do, was to plant the Schools and Universities, Seminaries of good Learning, with Pious and Learned men, to whom he gave so many Encouragements, that the fruits of so good a Project were soon seen and perceived by all, to the great Joy of all good Men, and the immortal Praise of so good a Prince. Neither did this good King rest in the encou∣ragement of the Liberal Sciences, but resolving to advance all Mechanick Trades (wholly de∣cayed by the tediousness, misery of an 150 Years War) sendeth over to Flanders, and from thence conduceth most exquisite Artificers of all sorts, to whom he gave great Rewards and large Im∣munities; by which Princely Munificence, Trades of all sorts thrive and flourish, the Poor set to Work, and many Enriched; every man acknowledging the happiness of that Peo∣ple
who live under the sweet and liberal Dews of a vertuous and munificent Prince. Soon after arrived Ambassadors from France to demand the young Lady formerly Espoused to the Dauphine, to be sent over for the Con∣summation of the Marriage. Ambassadors likewise come at the same time from England, with full purpose at once to break not only this Matrimonial, but also that An∣tient National League between the two King∣doms of France and Scotland: to which end they propound a League Offensive and De∣fensive, with a Tender of Berwick and Roxbor∣row to be Restored forthwith; many other things likewise were Tendered, promising ve∣ry fairly to the Good of both Kingdoms, if as fully performed as freely promised. King James remitteth this great Business to the Advice of his Parliament: The Parliament af∣ter much Debate, resolve to keep unviolably their Antient League with France, and accor∣ding to the desire of the French Ambassador, to send over the young Lady without fur∣ther delay. The English Ambassadors resent this Denial, as a Dishonour, and immediately denounce War against the Scots; threatning withal, by their Navy to Way-lay the Princess in her passage to France. The Princess is sent over forthwith under the guard of a very stately Navy, the English Na∣vy attempting nothing, her Highness safely Ar∣riveth, and her Marriage to the Dauphine, with
the greatest expressions of Joy solemnized at Turon. About the same time Earl Percy entreth into Scotland with 4000, rather to spoil than fight: Dowglass Earl of Anyus is sent against him with the like number, Percy is overthrown, a few slain on either side; of the English 1500 taken Pri∣soners. King James thus provoked by Way-laying the young Lady by Sea, and by this Inroad by Land; raiseth a great Army, with purpose to Invade Northumberland: in this way he layeth Siege to Roxborrow, then in the hands of the English, expecting in few days the Delivering of it into his hands. In the mean while cometh the Queen into his Camp discovering to him a most horrid Trea∣son intended by his own nighest Kindred, against both his Person and Posterity. His Majesty perceiving that her Relation proceeded not from Womanish fear, but from such real Grounds as were not to be slighted, raiseth his Siege, and without Advice of any, Disbandeth his Army, to the no less Astonish∣ment than Discontent of most about him; being Strangers to the cause of this sudden and unexpected Change: His Majesty posteth to St. John's Town (as a Bird into a Snare) of purpose to make a fuller Discovery, of that horrible Plot. The Treason being ripe, and ready for Exe∣cution, the Traitors privately repair thither, with a small hand of Conspirators: The Cap∣tains
of that Traiterous Band, Athol and his Cousin Graham, knowing the Weakness of the King's Guard, enter privately into the Mona∣stery where his Majesty lay, and by Conduct of one of his Houshold Servants, debauched into the Conspiracy, they come to the Stairs which led to the Royal Chamber: The Cup∣bearer at the same time coming down, per∣ceiving them in Arms, Crieth out with a loud Voice, Treason; him they forthwith Murder, and make hast to the Door, made fast by no stronger bar (the Iron Bolt being stolen away by the Traiterous Servant in Conspiracy with them) than the Tender wrest of a young Gen∣tleman, which quickly broke; the Assassinates furiously rush in, and run towards his Majesty, which the Queen perceiving, casteth her self upon the King, endeavouring poor Lady to preserve him, they drag her from him, not without some dangerous Wounds; and forgetting all fear of God and Man, thrust their Swords above Forty times through the Heart and Body of the most Excellent Prince. The cause of this horrid Assassination, was that old Mother of much Mischief, Ambition: Athold, the King's old Uncle, having already by his Hellish Subtlety, brought some of his nighest Kinsmen, who lay in his way to the Crown, to untimely Ends, resolveth at last to strike at the main Rub, the King himself; for accom∣plishing whereof he snatcheth the advantage of the Discontent of Robert Graham Tutor of Stra∣herne, to whom he propoundeth his Design,
craveth his Conjunction therein, with assurance not only of Protection but of ample Rewards, and great Preferments when he comes to his Kingdom. Graham graspes at all, and joyneth in the Traiterous Design with him. To this Combination Athol calleth his own Grandchild, Robert, a Youth nimble both in Head and Hand, whom he likewise debaucheth into this Treasonable Plot. The Treason thus Craftily contrived, is Cunningly carried on, and at last cruelly Executed, as before. This was a sad Day in Scotland, a day of Mourning and great Lamentation for the loss of such an Incomparable Prince; the Nobility filled with Grief and Indignation, breath out Revenge; post out Parties into every Corner of the Kingdom, to apprehend the Assassinates and their Complices; which they performed with such care and diligence, that within less than Forty days all of them are Apprehended, Arraigned, Condemned, and Hanged; only the Earl himself, his Grand-child Robert, and his Cousin Graham, are more severely proceeded against, to the terror of all Traitors, the Exe∣cutioners were to spend some part of three days in the Execution of Athol, himself, being the Contriver of the whole Villany: The first day he was drawn in a Cart to the place of Execu∣tion, a Crane was set up, and his Body hailed up by a Pully to a great height, is suddenly let fall, almost to the Ground, most of his Mem∣bers at once miserably disjoynted; then is he set on a Pillar in the view of the People, a
Crown of burning Iron set on his Head, with this Inscription; Here stands the King of all Trai∣tors: (whereby came to pass the Delusion of a Sooth-sayer, who told him (which withal was a spur to his Ambition) that in a publick place he should be Crowned King: The se∣cond day he is tied on an Hurdle and dragged by Horse through the Great Street in Edenburgh: The thrid day he was brought again to the place of Execution, and laid along a Plank, his Bowels are pulled out and cast into Fire prepared for them, his Traiterous Heart is like∣wise pulled out and cast into the same Fire, his Head cut off and set upon a Pole in a publick place of the City, as a Spectacle to all Men; his Body divided into four Quarters, is sent out to four other chief Cities in the Kingdom, and in publick places hanged up, to the terror of all Traitors. His Grand-child Robert being a Youth only, and Seduced by the wicked Counsel of his Grand-father, is more mildly dealt with∣all, being first Strangled to death and then Quartered; his Quarters are set as Spectacles in certain publick places of the Kingdom. Gra∣han is more roughly used, being, though not the chief Contriver, the grand Executioner of that dreadful Murther; he was first dragged through the City in a Cart backward, then his Hands being fastned in Iron Hooks fixed in the same Cart, his Flesh all his Body over is Seared with hot Irons, even to the very Bones; this done, his Body is cut in Quarters, and disposed on as were the former.
A severe piece of Justice, and well deserved; What could recompence the loss of that Good King, worthy to be reckoned amongst the best of Kings, a Man of a low Stature, but of a marvellous strength of Body, far exceeding all his Contemporaries; of such a vigorous Wit, that he was eminently learned in all the liberal Sciences; in Poetry and Musick he far exceeded the decorum of a King: a prudent Lawgiver, a singular Justiciary, a Merciful Prince: an in∣comparable Maecenas to all Learning: in all his Relations, and their respective duties, no King, no Man ever better; and yet for all these, it pleased God to suffer him to fall under the Cruel hands of wicked and bloody Men, for what cause, whether his own or his Peoples Sins, is best known to him from whom no Secret thing is hid. His Murther hapened to the inexpressi∣ble Grief of all good Men, the 20th. day of February, 1437. the 18th. Year of his Reign, and the 44th. of his Age.
THE LIFE OF JAMES II. JAMES the Second, only Son to James the First, was Crowned at Halyrude-House in the 7th Year of his Age: at the same time Sir Alexander Leviston is chosen Vice-Roy, and Sir William Chrichton continued Chancellor. The Nobility are no sooner returned home to the places of their ordinary Residence, when behold all things fall into a most Pernicious Confusion: Archibald Earl of Dowglas, concei∣ving himself neglected in the publick Admini∣stration, refuseth notwithstanding the Letters both of the Vice-Roy and Chancellor, direct∣ed to him to that effect; to Restrain the In∣solent Robberies committed by his own Vassals, all Anandale over; commanding them withal to deny Obedience to the Edicts and Proclama∣tions
of the Chancellor or Vice-Roy, preten∣ding a Regal Power Legally invested in him∣self over all those who lived within the Con∣fines of his peculiar Jurisdiction. The same Divel of Division playeth his Prancks between the Vice-Roy and Chancel∣lor: the Vice-Roy dischargeth by publick Proclamation all Obedience to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor by the like Proclamation, all Obedience to the Vice-Roy: The People thus perplexed between contrary Commands, are reduced by their Opposite Powers in cases of necessary Disobedience to the one or other, into a most woful Plight: The Vice-Roy and the Queen stay at Sterlin: The King the Tui∣tion of the Chancellor, abideth at Edenburgh Castle: the Queen with a design to rescue the King out of the hands of the Chancellor, re∣paireth to Edenburgh, pretending a desire only to see her Royal Son the young King. The Chancellor Entertaineth her Majesty civily and Princely; which civil Entertainment the Queen very Graciously accepteth; and by her fair and plausible Discourses concerning the State of publick Affairs, the happy Education of the young King her Son, and the earnest desire she had of an happy Union between the two grand Ministers of State; She so far Insinuateth her self into the good opinion of the Chancellor, that at all times she hath free access to the King's Person: Her Retinue being such too, as it was so small and of such mean Persons, that no matter or Jealousie could arise from them.
In the mean while she secretly persuadeth the Child to suffer himself to be conveyed away by her, and finding her opportunity, overnight she very civilly and in a Courteous fashion ta∣keth her leave of the Chancellor, pretending a Journey early next day morning to Whit-Kirk to perform some Vows and Religious-Offices: by break of Day she taketh her Journey, and with her the young King her Son, locked up in the Trunk in which her own Linnen lay; both take Shipping at Leith, and safely Arrive that Afternoon at Sterlin, where they were re∣ceived with much Joy. The Chancellor ama∣zed and ashamed to see himself so handsomly cheated, perplexeth himself to little purpose. The Vice-Roy forthwith advanceth with an Army to Besiege the Castle of Edenburgh, where the Chancellor lay: who immediately dispatch∣eth a Messenger to Earl Dowglas to crave Aid and Relief; who returneth Answer with as lit∣tle Wit as Fear; saying, That he knew they were both Knaves, contending not for Publick Good, but their own private Interests; so that wherever the Blow fell, it was not lost; and should they both Perish, it were the more happy for the whole Kingdom; as to himself he should not be sorry to see the Ruine of them both. This In∣discreet Answer, proveth as so much Soder to Cement the two grand Contenders: either by perceiving the Earl his common Enmity against both, resolve to make Peace one with another; which after a private and personal Conference, was accordingly done, both re∣maining in their respective places of Govern∣ment:
Being thus Reconciled, they bear a keen Edge towards Dowglas, but Death struck more sharp than their Sword, cutteth the thread of his Life, in a Fit of a burning Feaver; which notwithstanding cutteth not off the current of their Malice, which unhappily found a more advantageous passage, by the imprudent De∣portment of William the young Earl, his Son, a Youth not exceeding fourteen Years of Age, who living in a Princely garb, creating Knights, Counsellors, and other Officers; and always guarded with a Guard of Two Thousand Horse, is suspected and feared of all, and as an addition to his Envy as well as Greatness, he sendeth to France, and craveth the Title of his Grand-father, which was forthwith granted to him, and is immediately declared Duke of Tyron; and which added more to all Mens fear and jealousie, the Queen and the Lord James Stuart her Husband, and his Brother William, are suspected to be Engaged in Dowglas his Fa∣ction: The Vice-Roy glad to snatch any op∣portunity against the Queen, whom now he Suspected to be none of his Friend, secureth her Person; and not contented to secure her Husband and his Brother in a strong Prison, he layeth them both fast in Iron Fetters, where they remained until they found sufficient Sure∣ties for the Peace, engaging withal that they should not bear any publick Office without con∣sent of the Vice-Roy. The Vice-Roy now not a little puft up, ru∣leth all things at pleasure, contemning the
Chancellor and all other Officers of State: the Chancellor not able to bear this Insolence, withdraweth from Court, then at Sterlin, and retireth himself to the Castle of Edenburgh, the Government whereof he had Confirmed to him at their last Agreement: who meditating with himself what might be done to give Check to the Vice-Roy, resolveth to surprize the Person of the King, who he knew used to follow his sport in Hunting, with a small Retinue; to which end he marcheth out in the Night, and lodgeth himself and a Band of his most trusty Friends amongst Thickets in a Wood, whi∣ther the King came next day morning in course: the Chancellor forthwith Surprizeth him, beseeching his Majesty to be of good Chear, and to rest assured that no other thing save his Highness Service and Safety was intend∣ed by him, telling him that it was now high time for him to take the Government upon himself, in order whereunto he came to Rescue him out of the hands of the Vice-Roy, in which he lived not much on this side Slavery: and withal, with great shews of Respect and Duty, he tendereth to his Highness a Guard of Four Thousand Horse: The King seemeth not much displeased, putteth on a chearful Coun∣renance, and guarded with those Four Thou∣sand Horse, he cometh along with the Chan∣cellor to the City of Edenburgh, where he was re∣ceived with extraordinary Acclamations of Joy. The Vice-Roy no less confounded at this Surprisal than was the Chancellor at the Queen's
lately mentioned, is extremely perplexed: In Council, after many Self-debates, he resolveth at last, not daring to trust himself to the Earl Dowglas, upon all hazards to hast to Edenburgh with a small Retinue, to try whether by stoop∣ing so low, the Storm might pass over him: to Edenburgh he repaireth, and by mediation of the Bishops of Aberdeen and Murray, Men Learn∣ed, Pious, and Prudent; a Personal Confer∣ence is obtained with the Chancellor: The Vice-Roy with a sad Countenance, deploreth their unhappy Divisions, declaimeth against them as Dangerous to the Publick, and De∣structive to their own private Interests: he im∣ploreth an happy Union between them, with∣out which they must both Perish; promising on his part an Oblivion of all things past, and all fair Respect in time to come. The Chancellor well knowing that Destruction to both must needs be the Issue of the Divisions between them, chearfully hearkneth to the proposition of Peace, they presently accord, and an Union is now the second time concluded between them; and notwithstanding Distress enough to the People, and Danger more than enough to the young King, flowing from their divided Go∣vernment, these two cunning Catchers accord to continue still in their respective. Trusts and places in Government upon this agreement a Parliament is called at Edenburgh, for the better setling of the miserable distracted Conditon of the King∣dom. To this Parliament Dowglas is Invited; and by the advice of the Vice-Roy and Chan∣cellor
(his inveterate Enemies now contriving his Ruine) publick Letters are sent him Sealed by the King, and divers of the prime Nobi∣lity, inviting him with many Arguments of Love and Respect, to assist in Parliament, and in the publick Administration; assuring him not only of Safety, but tendering to him what Place he should desire in the management of publick Affairs. The Earl moved by the publick Faith thus ingaged, and by the specious Promises so So∣lemnly made, repaireth to Edenburgh without Fear or Jealousie: The Chancellor meeteth him before he came within ten Miles of the City, and inviteth him to his Castle at Chrichton, where he Entertaineth him magnificently, in all his Discourse so highly commending the No∣ble Family of the Dowglasses, their worthy Acts and high Deserts both of King and Country, and so fully declaring the great hopes himself con∣ceived of the young Earl himself, that the Wi∣ser of Dowglas his Retainers began to suspect some Mischief to lurk under the covert of those specious Words, which they knew were no less unusual in him, than unbeseeming his Place and Authority. They dissuade their Lord with all Earnestness from his Journey towards the City, intreating his return to his own House as he loved himself, and if he must needs go, they ad∣jure him by all the love he bear to his Family, and by all that reverence and obedience he owed to the Commands of his Wise Father, who charged him on his Death-bed, never to
trust his whole Family under the hazard of one Blow, that he would not carry along with him his dear and only Brother; but all in vain, his Destiny drives him no faster than he is willing to run to his own Ruine; he entereth the City, and is by the Chancellor attended to the Castle, whither the Vice-Roy likewise re∣paireth, and entertaineth him with all Civility; yea, and to Honour him the more, he is ad∣mitted to the King's own Table, and feasted with no small Solemnity: But behold, amidst all their Chear and great Mirth, a Band of Armed Men enters the Dining Chamber, and a Bull's Head is clap'd on the Table (a cer∣tain Token, in those days, of an appointed and approaching Death) the Earl is too late stricken with Fear, and endeavouring to rise, the Armed Men lay hold on him, drag him down Stairs, and without Doors immediately cut off his Head; his Brother David and Malcombe Fleming his dearest Friend, are at the same time, and in the same manner Cut off. The young King no less amazed than abused, and stricken with immediate Sorrow, weepeth as a Child, though now grown well upward towards the years of a Man: the Chancellor perceiving him, Chides him very sharply for his unseasonable Tears (as he was pleased to call them) for the Death of a Dangerous Trai∣tour. The Earl thus destroyed, and without Issue his Cousin James succeedeth him in the Rights and Honours of the Earldom, his Sister Beatrice
enjoying whatsoever was not Entailed to the Heir Male; James dyeth soon after: his Son William Succeedeth, and Marrieth his Cousin Bea∣trice, to the great encrease of his Wealth and Power, with which increased Pride and Inso∣lence, and with both, Envy and Fear; which the Earl perceiving, resolveth to satisfie the People whom he had deeply Oppressed, and to pacifie the King (now come to Age) whom he had highly displeased: to this end he repaireth to Court, submitting himself to the King, whose Pardon he craved, promising Amend∣ment in all things done amiss: the King recei∣veth him into Favour, in hope of better things, and indeed such was his Reformation, that he was admired of all, and dreaded of some, especially the Vice-Roy and Chancellor, know∣ing Guil and Fear, being always inseparable Companions, who suspecting and expecting the result of all his Counsels to be their Ruine: they withdraw from Court, laying down their Places in publick Affairs; the Vice-Roy to his House in the Countrey, the Chancellor to Eden∣burgh-Castle: Earl Dowglas takes the opportu∣nity of their Absence, and by his Counsel espe∣cially, both are Summoned to appear before his Majesty and great Council, to give an Ac∣count of their publick Imployments: both make shew of a great desire to obey, but at present excuse their Non-appearance, pretending Dan∣ger by reason of Earl Dowglas his Power and Enmity against them: by Influence of the Earl his Counsel, they are declared Traitours, and
their Estates confiscate; Costersine a Retainer to the Earl is sent with Commission to levy their Personal Estates, and to return them to the Ex∣chequer, which was accordingly done. In revenge of all which, the Chancellor rai∣seth some Forces, first pillageth, and then burneth Costersine his Estate, and many Lands belonging to Dowglas himself. This Quarrel occasioneth many Stirs in divers places in the Countrey: At last Dowglas Besiegeth the Chan∣cellor in the Castle of Edenburgh: After nine Months Siege, the Castle for want of Provi∣sions is forced to surrender upon Articles; of which this was the Chief: A general Act of Obli∣vion to be past by the King in Parliament in behalf of the Chancellor and his Friends; and leave to be granted to him to live in peace at his own House with∣out Molestation of him or his: This over, Dowglas bendeth himself against the Levistons, many of them are cited before the Parliament at Eden∣burgh; all accused of Treason, divers found Guilty, Condemned and Executed. Soon after Chrichton is reconciled to the King, and by him made Chancellor again, and sent Ambassador to France to renew the old League, and to demand some Princess of the Blood in Marriage to the young King. Mary, Daughter to the Duke of Geldria by the Duke of Burgundy his Sister, is forthwith Espoused, and next Year after Arriveth in Scot∣land, is Married to the King, and Crowned Queen at Halyrude-House, Anno 1449.
By this time the Truce between the two Kingdoms, England and Scotland, determineth: new Stirs begin, and after some Depredations on both sides, the Truce is renewed and conti∣nued for Seven Years; but to very little pur∣pose; restless Men soon break the Peace; the English break into Scotland, spoil and plunder many places; the Scots do the like in England; the English raise a great Army to Invade the Scots, under the Command of the Earl of Nor∣thumberland, and one Magnus a Knight, a Man of great Valour and Experience in War-like affairs. The Scots likewise raise an Army under the Command of George Earl of Ormond, Brother to the Earl Dowglas: the two Armies joyn Battel between Anand and Eske in Scotland; Magnus, too daring a Man, adventureth too far, and falleth by his own rashness; his Fall is the Ruine of all, the whole Army runneth, and is put to a satal Rout; Three Thousand English killed, and divers Prisoners of Quality; a Rich Plun∣der obtained by the Scots, with the Loss of 600 of their Men. This Overthrow enrageth the English; a new Army is appointed to be Levied: Civil Wars in England cross all: An Ambassador is sent to Scotland to desire Peace, Peace could not be obtained: A Cessation of Arms only con∣cluded, and that with much ado, for three Years. Earl Dowglas next Year following, de∣sirous to see the Papal Jubilee, travelleth through France, with a Princely Retinue to Rome. No
sooner gone, than whole troops of People, Oppressed by him, have their recourse to the King, praying instantly and incessantly for Re∣paration of wrong done by him. His Majesty is in a strait, the Petitions being such, as could not in Justice be refused; and the Earl not being present, could not in Justice be Condemned: in the mean time the Earl his Proctor is called, for to get in what Answer he could; who refusing to appear, is commit∣ted to Prison: Many counsel harder things against him, as guilty of high Contempt of Royal Majesty: the King inclining to Modera∣tion, calleth for him out of Restraint, and Commandeth him to Plead for his Lord freely and without Fear, which the Proctor, thus en∣couraged, accordingly performed: His Ma∣jesty having patiently heard all that possibly could be said, adjudgeth reasonable Satisfaction to be made to the Oppressed: The Proctor craveth respite till the return of his Lord; The King adjudgeth present Satisfaction; and to that end Lord William Sinclare Earl of Orkney, and at that time Lord Chancellor, is sent into Galloway and Dowglasdale, to Commissionate Col∣lectors to Levy my Lord's Retinue for Satisfa∣ction of the Sums adjudged; the Collectors all slighted, and continued, return home, having done just nothing. This inrageth his Majesty; the chief Obstru∣ctors are sent for, who refusing to appear, are all denounced Rebels, and Forces sent to re∣duce them to Order; they fly to strong Holds,
against which the Party sent, could do no∣thing; the King marcheth in Person against them; Maban Castle immediately Yieldeth; Dowglas Castle reduced, not without some loss to the King, is laid level to the ground; all the Faction at length submitteth, and payeth out of Dowglas his Estate, the Sums adjudged. The Earl having notice of all these Trou∣bles, returneth from Rome much perplexed, making a Pause in England, until by his Bro∣ther he understood the King's gracious Affection towards him; in the assurance whereof he Ad∣dresseth himself to his Majesty, craving his Pardon for all former Miscarriages, and pro∣mising all dutiful Obedience for the future; is not only received into Favour, but soon af∣ter declared Vice-Roy. This extraordinary Grace is as soon forgot, made use on to none other purpose save to ad∣vance his own Ambitious Designs, whereof all Men were the more Jealous, by his private withdrawing into England, where he entertain∣ed a Clandestine Conference with the English King; of which giving none other Reason save the Petition of some Plundred Goods, the Scot∣tish King is no less Enraged against him, than Jealous of him; and which the Earl under∣standing, and knowing his Majesty's Clemency, craveth his Pardon with shew of great Humili∣ty; which by the mediation of the Queen is soon obtained: The King resolving notwithstand∣ing, to trust him no more in that height of Power in Government, committeth the chief
management of all Publick Affairs to the Earl of Orkney, and to Chrichton the old Chancellor: Dowglas reckoning this a Note of Disgrace, rageth against the whole Court, Vowing the Destruction of Chrichton, which he well nigh made good by an Ambush laid for him, as he pasled from Edenburgh to his House at Chrichton: A Troop of Armed Men all on the sudden compass him round, he forceth his Paslage, and escapeth the Snare, not without some dan∣gerous Wounds; his Wounds are Cured, he returneth to Edenburgh: Earl Dowglas fearing the King's displeasure, withdraweth from the City, still resolving Revenge; for accomplish∣ing whereof he entereth a League Offensive and Defensive with the Earls of Craford, and Ross; in the strength whereof he presumeth so much, as to contemn all Opposition; the King himself is Despised in his Eyes: Harris and Mr. Lennan, two Galloway Knights, both of An∣tient Families, are put to Death by him, under pretence of Justice, in despight of all the King could do or say: Rumours are likewise every where cast out, of his aspiring to the Crown; At last his Majesty sendeth for him, forthwith to repair to his Court at Sterlin; the Earl re∣fuseth, pretending Danger from the Power of his Enemies then at Court. Divers of the No∣bles send their Letters of Assurance to him, and move the King to Seal a Paper in the na∣ture of a Pass; which the Earl receiving, co∣meth to Court, confiding in the often experi∣enced Clemency of the King; his Majesty re∣ceiveth
him Graciously, and Inviteth him to Supper; after Supper the King, with some of his most Intimate Counsellors, withdraw, and with them the Earl, into a Withdrawing-Room: In the presence of those his Counsel∣lors he Expostulateth with the Earl his strange Deportment towards him, mentioning the bounty of the Crown to his Family, and his own Extraordinary Grace to himself; not only his Pardon more than once granted, but sin∣gular Pledges of his Favour frequently Con∣ferred, and all most strangely abused: Not∣withstanding all which, his Majesty once again tenders to him the assurance of his Fa∣vour and Grace, in hope of amendment; re∣pairing, nay, rather requesting the Cancelling of that odious League with Craford and Ross, so dangerous and dishonourable to his Majesty: Dowglas answereth Dimisly enough to all, save in the point of the League, wherein he desires to be Excused: The King presseth him with all Earnestness, to persist no longer in it; which the Earl peremptorily refusing, the King is moved into an extraordinary Passion, breaking out into these words; If thou wilt not break it, by God I will; and then before his Counsellors were aware, he thrusteth his Ponyard into his Heart. This unhappy Accident casteth all into Con∣sussion. Dowglas his four Brothers then in Town, raise a Dangerous Tumult; and with much ado, are appeased: Immediately they fly into their own Countrey, and break out into open Re∣bellion,
dragging the King's Pass and the No∣ble Mens Letter to the late Earl, at their Horse Heels, with words of Disgrace, not fit to be mentioned: They Pillage, Burn, and Slay all they suspected bare any Favour to the King. The King calleth a Parliament at Edenburgh, before which they are Summoned to appear; all Con∣temptuously refusing, are proclaimed Traitors; with the Countess Dowager, Wife to the late Earl; and with her, the Earl of Craford. James, the eldest Brother, and now Earl, to preserve the Wealth of his Family, Marrieth his Brother's Wife, craveth the Pope his Dispensa∣tion; which being refused, he allureth as many into his Faction as possibly he could, far more siding with him than possibly could be expect∣ed; insomuch that the whole Kingdom for two Years together, became a very Stage of Murther and Rapine; Famine, and the Pesti∣lence threatning Ruine to all. Divers of Dowglas his Wiser Friends being touched with the Sense of these Calamities, counsel him to cast himself upon the King's mercy; he scorneth the Motion, declaiming against them as Pusillaminous, declaring rather to Dye, than to Submit. Earl Craford taketh another and wiser course, choosing rather to Submit; he casteth himself in his Majesty's way passing through Angus; and like a Penitent indeed, he comes Bare-footed into his Royal Presence, and prostrateth himself before Him with Tears in his Eyes, and the greatest expressions of Sorrow that could be
made, craving in a most Penitent Oration, his Majesty's Pardon. The King, and all then and there present, are touched with Compassion towards him; his Pardon is forthwith granted; the Earl sen∣sible of his Grace, tendereth his Service to his Majesty; which being accepted, he behaveth himself as a gallant Man, and a good Subject, to his Dying day. Dowglas sendeth Hammilton to the English King, to crave Assistance from him, which could not be obtained unless Dowglas should declare himself a Subject to the Crown of England; a Condi∣tion so unreasonable, even in his Judgment, though sufficiently Rebellious against his na∣tive Prince, that he choosed rather to Perish than to Embrace it. Hammilton therefore re∣turning without hope of English Help, persua∣deth Dowglas to put all to the hazard of a Bat∣tel, which accordingly was resolved on: his Army marcheth, and advanceth towards the King's, then Besieging Abercorne Castle: The two Armies in view one of another, Dowglas proveth two slow; his Army is thereby much discouraged; which Hammilton perceiving, with∣draweth, goeth over to the King, craves his Pardon, and obtaineth it. Dowglas retreateth, and deserted almost of all, flyeth into England. The Castle is taken by Storm, and the Garrison put to the Sword; the Ruines of that stately Ca∣stle remaining as a Monument of that Victory.
Dowglas soon after returneth into Anandale, giveth Battel to some of the King's Forces there, and receiveth the Foil; his Brother Ar∣chilbald is Killed on the place, his Brother George Wounded, and taken Prisoner, is sent to the King, and Beheaded. A Parliament is again called to Assemble at Edenburgh, 1455: Dowglas and his Adherents are again declared Traitors, and their Estates Confiscated: Dowglas flyeth into the Hebrides, and entereth into League with Donald Lord of the Isles: They fall down into the main Coun∣trey, where they Pillage and consume all with Fire and Sword wheresoever they came, laying wast divers Counties. Beatrice, Wife to both Earls of Dowglas, and both Brethren; casteth her self at the King's feet, craveth his Pardon, pretending that she was forced to the Marriage of her Lord's Bro∣ther by fear of present Destruction: She de∣clareth her self as willing to submit to the King's Justice, as to accept of his Mercy, whereof she acknowledgeth her self most un∣worthy; she receiveth Pardon, and is beyond all Mens expectation, received into Favour; yea, and Donald Lord of the Isles, sendeth his Orators to his Majesty, to crave his Pardon; all that could be obtained, was a Command to to make Satisfaction to the People for the Mis∣chief done by him; which being done, a Pro∣mise is made to assure him of Pardon.
Earl Dowglas passeth over into England, cra∣veth Assistance of Henry Earl of Northumberland, which was no sooner asked than obtained: Forces are raised, and under the Conduct of the two Earls they make an Incursion into the Meuse in Scotland, wasting and pillaging all: the Earl of Angus is sent to give some Check to the violent Current; which was done to good purpose, being soundly beaten, they are forced to retreat, leaving their Spoil behind them. King James not satisfied with this Victory, resolveth to revenge the manifold Incursions made into Scotland, by an Expedition into Eng∣land, provoked the more by the Entertainment and Assistance given to the Earl Dowglas, a Pro∣claimed Traitor. In the mean while Agents are sent to him by some of the English Nobility, the Duke of York, the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick, and others then in Arms against King Henry; to crave some Auxiliary Forces from his Majesty, in recom∣pence whereof they promise, in case of Success, the Rendition of all the Scottish Towns, Forts, and Castles in the English Possession. King James, though unwilling to meddle in this Quarrel; yet being glad of an Opportunity to regain his Towns, and having formerly concluded a War for reparation of Wrongs done, declareth to the English Commissioners, that he would hasten his Expedition into Eng∣land, which he doubted not would be much to the advantage of the Lords in Arms; and therefore expected, that in case of Success, the
Proposition now made touching his Towns, should then be performed. The English Commissioners return satisfied; the Scottish Army forthwith advanceth, which had not marched many Miles, when behold an Impostor, and with him a Cozening Monk presenteth himself to the King, pretending himself to be the Pope's Legate, but sent in∣deed by King Henry of England: This Jugler informeth his Majesty, that his Holiness intend∣ed to settle, if possible, a general Peace in Chri∣stendom, in order to a War against the Turk, the Enemy of Christians; and therefore in his Holiness his Name, he requireth his Majesty to retreat, assuring him, that in case of Disobe∣dience, he had Command given to him to de∣nounce the Pope's Curse against him; which in those days was so Dreadful, that no Man durst be so desperate as to incur the danger thereof: King James therefore obeycth, retreateth, and Disbandeth his Army. This Cheat is soon discovered; the King en∣raged, recalleth his Army, and forthwith ad∣vanceth; and in his way Stormeth the Town of Roxburgh, then Garrison'd by the English; the Castle refusing to yield, is closely Besieged; in the interim Messengers come from the English Lords to give notice to his Majesty of King Henry his Overthrow, and return him thanks for his Royal care of their Safety, intreating him to desist from the Siege, lest the English, be∣ing provoked thereby, send down an Army, contrary to their minds, against him. King
James much moved at this last Passage, demand∣eth of the Messengers what Instructions they had from their Lords concerning the Promise of Surrendering into his hands all his Towns, Forts and Castles, in the English power; they acknowledge none: The King bids them tell their Lords, That not their Words, but their Swords, must raise him from the Siege. The Siege conti∣nueth, and is reinforced by additional Forces under Earl Hantkey and Donald Lord of the Isles, who to ingratiate himself the more to his Ma∣jesty, tendereth himself and his Forces as a Forlorn Hope, in what Design or Service so∣ever it shall please his Majesty to command him. In the midst of all this Preparation, behold the Fatal hour approacheth; the King being himself very skilful in discharging of great Ordnance, draweth nigh to see the Cannoneer discharge a great Cannon called the Lion, newly sent to him from beyond Sea; the Cannon dis∣charged, flyeth in pieces, a Wedge whereof pierceth the King's body, and immediately he dyeth. Such of his Courtiers and Commanders as were by, though astonished at this sad Specta∣cle, yet are so present in mind, as to cover his Body from the view of the Souldiers, lest all should turn to Confusion. The Queen, who that very morning came into the Camp, with a chearful Countenance, wisely consealing the great grief of her heart, exhorteth the Nobility to go on with Resolu∣tion,
notwithstanding that sad disaster: and for their further encouragement produceth her young Son the Prince, a Child of seven Years old, they salute him King; and being much animated by this couragious Deportment of the Queen, the Siege goeth on more furiously than before. The English within, spent with much labout and continual watchings, Sound a Parley, ob∣tain Articles of Surrender; march out honour∣ably, with freedom to Transport into England whatsoever belonged to the Garrison: the Ca∣stle Surrendered, is forthwith Demolished. Thus Dyed James the Second about the 11th. of September 1460, in the 22th. Year of his Reign, and the 29th. of his Age; he lived in a most desperate time, and Rebellious Age; but disposed with such a well composed Mind, that Prosperity and Adversity were equally enter∣tained by him (the Death of Earl Dowglas the only instance of his Impotency,) a Man of sin∣gular Courage, and no less Clemency; muni∣ficent to his Friend, and merciful to his Foe: In a sad time he fell, leaving Sorrow enough behind him, and a sad People for so great a loss.
THE LIFE OF JAMES III. JAMES the Third entereth his Reign at Kelso the 7th. Year of his Age, Anno 1460. The Peers having done the Homage, the King repaireth to Edenburgh-Castle, to re∣main there, under the Tuition of the Queen, until a Parliament could conveniently be cal∣led, for setling the Affairs of the King and Kingdom. In the mean while King Henry the Sixth of England, after various Fortune of War, is at last, after the fatal Blow he received at Towton, nigh Ferrybridges (where died 35091 English) forced to fly with the Queen and Prince into Scotland for Relief; where he is Honourably received and entertained; the Scottish King's
Sister Margaret, is given in Marriage to his Son Prince Edward. Some considerable Forces are raised for his Assistance, to recover his Crown, having delivered Berwick to King James, as part or his Antient Inheritance before the days of King Edward the First. King Henry marcheth with his Army into England, and is overthrown in Battel by Edward the 4th. nigh Hexham; escapeth to Berwick; Edward returneth to Lon∣don. Queen Margaret procures some Forces from France; all Cast away in the Holy Island by di∣stress of Weather; such as escaped the Sea, are either Slain or Imprisoned. King Henry now desperate of Relief, resolveth to try the Affecti∣ons of his Friends in England, and to that end putteth himself into a Disguise, and coming Southward, is discovered, apprehended, car∣ried to London, and laid up in the Tower. By this time the Scots are at leisure to meet in Parlia∣ment; great Contention there was, into whose hands the Government should be committed, during the King's Minority; the Queen claim∣eth it; Kennedie Arch-bishop of St. Andrews, and George Dowglas Earl of Angus, Heads of a con∣trary Faction, Oppose her: great Justling be∣tween the two Factions, even unto Blood, had not the Wisdom of the Bishops interposed. In fine, It was agreed that two of each Faction should be intrusted with the Tuition of the young King, and the Government of the whole King∣dom: of the Queens Faction, were James Gro∣ham and Robert Boid, then Lord Chancellor: of the other Robert Earl of Orkney, and John Kennedy, chief of that Clan.
To these were added the Bishops of Glasco, and Dunkell, Men of great Learning and Inte∣grity; the Queen her self only permitted to have some inspection into the King's Educa∣tion, without medling in the publick Admini∣stration: The younger Children are wholly committed to her Tuiton, which were Alexander Duke of Albany, John Earl of Marre, and two Daughters. These things happily Established in Parlia∣ment, Audience is given to the English Ambas∣sadors, their business was for Peace, and ac∣cordingly a Peace for Fifteen Years is con∣cluded. Next Year after the Queen Mother dieth; Alexander the King's Brother, returning from France, is taken Prisoner by the English: The Scots complaining of it, as a breach of Peace; the Child is immediately set at Liberty. Things now quiet abroad, new Stirs arise at home by the restless and rebellious Spirit of Do∣nald Lord of the Isles, who falleth down into the lower Countries with an Army, surpriseth Enner∣ness, and Proclaimeth himself King of the Isles, and advanceth into Athol, with a very power∣ful Army: The Earl of Athol, not prepared to oppose so great a Power, flyeth to the Sanctu∣ary of St. Brigit; never at any time Violated before by the most barbarous of Men: The rich Booty of the place was of more price to that barbarous Raven, than the esteem of its San∣ctity: he barbarously entereth into the Sanctu∣ary, taking the Earl and his Lady, and divers
others, Prisoners; putteth most of the Priests to the Sword; and having Pillaged what he could, sets the Sacred place on Fire; and ma∣king much hast home with his Booty, the wrath of God pursueth him; his Ships are cast away, his Men most of them drowned, him∣self reserved to a greater Judgment, runneth Mad, and remaineth so in a great height to his dying-day: Such of his Fellows as escaped the present Judgment, are stricken with such Inward Horrour, that they voluntarily per∣formed Penance with very great expressions of Remorse, going Bare-footed in Sackcloath to the place they so much Contemned, satisfying to the utmost of their power, for the Expiation of their Offence. This Storm over, a Calm continued for a Season; but all is soon overclouded, by the malignant Spirit of Ambition and Envy. The Boids labour to get all into their hands, to which end Thomas, Brother to the Lord Boyd (appointed to Instruct the King in Martial Dis∣cipline and Exercises) endeavoureth by evil Counsel, to Alienate his Majesty's affections from all those Nobles, to whose Tuition he was committed; and watching his opportunity, the King following his Sport with a small Re∣tinue nigh Luilithquo, is forcibly snatched out of the hands of Kennedie Earl Casles, by the fore∣said Thomas, not without some Violence offered to the Person of the old Earl.
And now begins the Devil of Deadly Fewd to work, the Boydes bring the King to Edenburgh: Kennedie, and divers others repair to their several homes, watching opportunity of re∣venge: the Boyds observing the Nobility to keep from Court, procure a Parliament to be called, in which Robert the Chief of the Boydes upon his bended knees, complaineth of the hard Construction put upon the King's remove from Linligtheuo, beseeching his Majesty to declare his sense and pleasure in that business, whether he or any of his had therein offended his High∣ness: the young King, what through the fear of their Power, and afraid of their flattering words, with which they had seasoned him, declareth, that What they did was good Service done, deserving rather a Reward, than any Punish∣ment: this Declaration was Recorded in the Books of Parliament, and an instrument to this effect given the Lord Boyd under the Broad∣Seal, and the same day he is declared Vice∣Roy, until his Majesty should happily arrive at the age of One and Twenty: and as an addition to all his Greatness, Mary, the King's eldest Sister is given in Marriage to Thomas Son to the said Robert Lord Boyd. And now such Foun∣dations being laid, they promise themselves security, in this great Pomp and Prosperity. But behold the vanity of the World, the envy of the People, the emulation of the Peers, and the alienation of the King's mind suddenly over∣throw all.
About this time the Lord Chancellor is sent to Denmark, to demand Margaret, Daughter to the Danish King, in Marriage to James King of Scotland; he safely arrived, is honourably en∣tertained, and the Marriage immediately con∣cluded. Denmark's Interest in Shitland and Ork∣ney given in lieu of her Dower. The happy Issue of this Embassage being signified to the King, an Ambassadour, with a Train of young Noble Men and Gentlemen, is appointed to be sent over into Denmark, to attend the young Queen into Scotland: the young Lord Boyd Earl of Aran, and now Bro∣ther in Law to the King, is on all hands thought the fittest Man for this Service, the young Lord accepts of his Honourable Imployment, and with a very stately Train sets Sail about the end of August; no sooner is he gone than a Par∣liament is called to Assemble November 22d. in which the Boydes are all accused of High-Trea∣son: Robert the Chief flyeth into England, Alex∣ander his Brother appeareth and Pleadeth for himself, is adjudged Guilty, Condemned and Beheaded: the Treason charged on both, was Violence offered to the King's Person when they forcibly pulled him out of the Arms of the old Earl of Kennedy Miclinlithquo; Behold the Uncertainty of humane Judgments, the same Fact declared Good Service in one Parliament, is in another judged High-Treason. The next Spring the Danish Fleet arriveth with the young Queen; after her Reception with very great expressions of Joy, the Mar∣riage
is Solemnized in a great Concourse of the Nobility. The Lord Boyd hearing of the Disasters of his Family, dares not Land to par∣take of this Solemnity, but goeth a solitary Man beyond the Seas, and is entertained by the Duke of Burgundy, by whom he was Ho∣noured above all others for his gallant Ser∣vice in War; but in Scotland another account is made of him, where he is declared Traitor, and his Lands confiscated; and to add to his Calamity the King recalleth His Sister, Married to the Earl; and being encouraged by some of the Nobility, with hopes of a Reconcilia∣tion between the King and her Lord, by her presence to intercede, over she comes in obe∣dience to the King's Command; being arrived, a Divorce from her Husband is presently pro∣pounded, in order whereunto publick Sum∣mons are given at his House in Kilmernock, and at the chief Sea-ports in the Kingdom, requi∣ring his return within Sixty days, according to the Law; which he not performing (not da∣ring indeed to perform) by reason of his non∣adherence, a Divorce issueth out, and the for∣mer Marriage declared Null. The Divorce published, the young Lady is Married, not without her great grief and re∣luctancy, at the King's special and peremptory Command, to James Earl Hammilton, (the issue of which unhappy Marriage proved in most after-Generations, an unhappy Annoyance to the Crown, by whom she had James and Mar∣garet.
The Lord Boyd out-lives not this Disaster, dy∣eth with Grief at Antwerp, where the Duke of Burgundy erected for him a most stately Tomb; thus in a trice, fell the flourishing Family of the Boydes, a real Instance of the instability and vanity of the World. These Stirs over, the Peace is renewed with England, and at home Disturbances not many nor great: But this Calm lasted not long, Fears and Jealousies, the bane of all States, disturb all, and like an evil Spirit, divide between the King and the Nobility; Affairs standing thus, his Majesty useth the Counsels of some Knights and Gentlemen, in whose wisdom and integri∣ty he confided much; this enrageth the No∣bility yet more: and as if this had not been afflictious enough, his younger Brother John, conspireth his Death, by the means of wicked Sorcerers, for which Treason he is condemned to Dye by the opening of a Vein, which ac∣cordingly was executed: Alexander the other Brother suspected conscious to this Treason, is Committed to Edenburgh Castle; from thence he Escapeth, and Saileth into France, where he takes to Wife the Daughter of the Earl of Bo∣nonia. Ambassadours are again sent from England to renew the Peace, and to Ratifie the same by a new Affinity of an inter-marriage between James, Son to King James, and the Lady Cicilie, Daughter to King Edward, to be Solemnized so soon as both come to age fit for Marriage; in the mean while a part of the Dowry to be
paid down, and in case the Marriage happened not to be Consummated, the same to be re∣paired to the English. These things were all happily concluded; but the more was the pity, not very long ob∣served: Dowglas an old Exile, and Alexander the King's Brother, (by this time come over to England) perswade King Edward to War against the Scots; and on the other hand King Lewis of France, incites King James against the English: King Edward levieth Twenty thousand Men, pretending to vindicate some Wrongs done by some late Inroads made by the Scots; and un∣der the Command of the Duke of Glocester, ac∣companied with divers Noble Men, amongst whom was Alexander Duke of Albany, they March Northward; King James prepareth an Army for defence, advanceth to Lawder, not far from the Borders, where the discontent of some of the Nobility breaketh out into Vio∣lence against the King's Counsellors; they Sur∣prize them in the Night, and drag most of them from the King's presence, and are all by special influence of the Earl of Angus (Sir John Ramsey only except) immediately hanged in the view of the Army; their great Crime (save that some of them were advanced to the dig∣nity of Noble Men) was the Coyning of Brass Money, in use many days before, and continu∣eth in that Kingdom to this day: The truth is, the King's Favour to them, and their Faith to the King, was their greatest Treason.
After this Disaster the Army dissolveth, the King returneth to Edenburgh, with no less Fear than Grief and Indignation. The Duke of Glocester advanceth to the Gates of Edenburgh, leaving Four thousand of his Army to Besiege the Castle of Berwick: the Nobility in this distraction raiseth an Army to stop this Current; Alexander Duke of Albany, with the consent of the Duke of Glocester, goeth over into the Scots Army, where the Command in chief (so handsomely was the Game played) is immediately transferred to him; a Treaty immediately set on foot; by agreement Berwick is immediately surrendered; the Duke returns to England, and a Truce for certain Years ap∣pointed. King Edward having seen so many late strange Mutations in England, and fearing the like fate to King James which had happened to some of the English Kings, viz. the ruine of his Fa∣mily; sendeth an Herald to Scotland, and at Edenburgh proclaimeth the late contract of Mar∣riage between the two young Princesses to be void, demanding the repayment of that part of the Dowry paid: King James being now at more liberty than before, repayeth the Money not without some Indignation. Duke Alexander perceiving that his Majesty's Eye was upon him, and that his traiterous De∣sign to compass the Crown was discovered; fly∣eth privately into England and betrayeth the Castle of Dunbar to King Edward; the Parlin∣ment declareth him Traitor, pardoning all his
Associates: after pardon granted, Chrichton Son to the late Chancellor, keepeth Correspondence with the Duke; is summoned to answer, dis∣obeyeth, and is Banished. The Duke and Earl Dowglas both Exiles, re∣solve to try their Fortune and Favour of the People, return to Scotland with Five hundred Horse; the Country riseth against them; after a bloody Conflict nigh Lough Maban, the Duke is overthrown, and escapeth: Dowglas is appre∣hended and sent Prisoner to Lindores. By this time King Edward of England dieth, and committeth his Son Edward the Fifth, to the Tuiton of his Brother Richard Duke of Glo∣cester, the Duke impiously Murdereth his two Nephews, and setteth himself on the Throne. Immediately he sendeth his Ambassadors to Scotland, to treat for Peace. King James in de∣testation of their Master, refuseth them Au∣dience; at last with much ado Audience is granted; no Peace could be obtained, a Truce only for three Years concluded, by reason of the King's own unsetled condition. Soon after this Truce King Richard is killed at Bosworth Field: Henry the Seventh obtaineth the Crown and cometh in Person to Newcastle, from whence he sendeth his Ambassadors to Scotland, Richard Fox Bishop of Exeter, and Sir Richard Edgcombe; they are Honourably received; their Master and the matter of their Embassy, which was Peace, both indear them to King James, who very freely told them that there was no∣thing he desired more than Peace, though he
durst not promise a lasting Peace with England, by reason of the restless and unquiet Spirits of his Nobility, which he heartily bemoaned to them, adjuring them to conceal from his No∣bles, the carnest desire he had of Peace, from which he knew they would be the more averse, finding him bent towards it: and in fine, he prayeth them to rest satisfied with a Truce for Seven Years, promising that before the deter∣mination thereof, he on his part should be ready to renew it Seven Years more, as one passionately desirous to live in peace with the English all his Life. This Answer is returned to King Henry, and a Truce accordingly for Seven Years concluded. In the mean while Alexander Duke of Albany dieth in France, leaving behind him two Sons, Alexander and John, afterwards Vice-Roy in Scotland: King James now promiseth himself some quiet, (the Original of all his troubles removed) and in order thereunto, he Pro∣claims a general Pardon, receiveth his Enemies into Favour, Honoureth some, Inricheth many, and admitteth others into his most Secret Coun∣sels. But all this cannot serve his turn, their Guilt, they thought, was greater than could be forgi∣ven; this Gangreen'd in their thoughts every day, so deadly an enemy is Guilt and Fear, being always companions, and come to that height, that the King's Life and their Safety cannot con∣sist; his Ruine is therefore contrived and re∣solved on, the want of a Popular Leader is a
main Rub, in their way: The Prince himself is thought the fittest to countenance this horrid Design: His Keepers are corrupted: The young and unwary Prince seduced, and to their Proposi∣tion he must yeild, otherwise they deal plainly with him, to tell him that he and the Regal Power both, must be delivered into the Hands of King Henry of England: Thus the young Prince is frighted from all Duty and Loyalty to his Dearest Father, to countenance as Commander in chief, a most Traiterous Combination of perverse and seditious Men: An Army is forth∣with raised in pursuance of their Design. The King prepareth for Defence; useth all ho∣nourable means for Peace, and by mediation of the Earl of Athol his Uncle, soliciteth for it; the Rebels return an Answer, telling him, That unless he resign his Crown to his Son, and depart the Kingdom, there could be no Peace. This Answer the King dispatcheth to his Am∣basladors in France, and England, requiring them to request the Assistance of both King's, in this common cause, wherein all Kings are concerned; who accordingly send their Ambassadors to the Scots, declaring their proceedings against their King to be Wicked and Pernicious, and not to be endured by Christian Princes so much con∣cerned in such a dangerous Example: The Pope is likewise sent to, to interpose his Ghostly and Paternal Power; who accordingly sendeth to his Legate, Adrian de Castello an Italian, the great Restorer of the Latine Tongue, then in England, forthwith to apply himself to Compose the
Scottish troubles; but all in vain, as being too late; the Rebels Army presseth towards the King's, Incamped by Blackness: and to make all sure they Assail him as well by Fraud as Force: Some of his Council about him are corrupted, so are likewise some of his Commanders in Martial Affairs, especially the Governor of Sterlin; the Key of the Kingdom, the corrupt Council about him, with fair pretences, per∣swade him to appear on the head of his Army, and to forsake the Castle of Edenburgh (where he resolved to secure himself until he heard the result of Foreign Counsels) assuring him that Sterlin then in the Rere of his Army, and in the hands of Faithful Men, was a place of no less security for his Person, than was Edenburgh Castle, and of far greater advantage to receive Recruits, and all other accommodations for his Army, having the benefit of the Countrey behind him, and his Navy not far from him. This Counsel was so fair and promising, that even such as were faithful to him, perswade him to it; and according to this advice the King repaireth to Sterlin; the Governor, Sey, perceiving the Rebels Army pressing after the King's, Traiterously refuseth Entrance to him. The poor King is now in a Pound, and with his small Army is forced to Fight; his Majesty behaveth himself very gallantly, and routeth the Van of his Enemies: but their Reserve re∣gains all; the King's Army is overthrown, himself dismounted and wounded; privately flyeth into a Mill, hoping to get into his Navy,
but the fatal hour approacheth, some of the Rebels discovering him, pursue after him, and impiously Murther him and all the faithful remnant of his Servants about him. Thus died King James the Third, a good and peaceable Man, every way well disposed, but plagued by the Ambition of restless and un∣quiet Spirits, who Traiterously sought and wrought his Ruine. The Battel over and no news of the King, the Rebels supposing that he had gained his Navy, send to Sir Andrew Wood, chief Captain of the Ships, Seton and Fleming being left Hostages in the Navy, Sir Andrew appeareth before the Chief of them, called the Prince his Council, being demanded whether, his Majesty was aboard the Navy, and what those Boats were that passed to and fro, before and after the Bat∣tel? Stoutly replyed that his Majesty was not aboard, for which he was the more sorrowful; and as to the Boats, they transported himself, and other faithful Subjects to the King's assi∣stance, conformable to the duty of their Alle∣geance, whom alone they were resolved to serve, were he alive to be benefited by their service; but now being Slain in Battel by some barbarous Rebels, they resolved to avenge his Death to the last drop of their Blood: having sufficiently declaimed against the wickedness of that horrid Rebellion, and all engaged in it; he is remitted safely to his Navy by reason of the Hostages given in pledge for him.
The Rebels retreat to Edenburgh, where no∣tice is given to them of the King's death; the news whereof pierces the heart and soul of the young Prince, now, when too late, sensible of his Error, and sadly resenting his great unhap∣piness, and above that his deadly sin, in being accessary to the misfortune of his dearest Fa∣ther, causeth a stately Funeral to be solemnized for him at Kammiskeneth, an Abby nigh Sterlin, where his Corps were Interred; and for him∣self he prepared an Iron Chain, with which he begirt himself, wearing it all the days of his Life about his middle close to his Skin, in testi∣mony of the deep sense he had of his sin, add∣ing yearly one Ring thereunto, not so much to enlarge it as to remember the sad occasion of it.
THE LIFE OF JAMES IV. JAMES the Third thus unhappily fallen under the hands of merciless Men, his Son James Succeedeth, and entreth his Reign, Anno 1488, who sorrowful enough (if in such a case any sorrow can be enough) for his Father's Fall, which could not be recovered; laboureth to compose all Differences, and to reunite the two grand Factions, in order to a peaceable Reign, to which end having the Castles of Edenburgh and Sterlin Surrendered to him, a Messenger is sent to Sir Andrew Wood Captain of the Ships, to call him to attend his Majesty's pleasure; the publick Faith being pledged for his safety, the Captain repaireth to Court: the King, with inexpressible sorrow
and immoderate grief, regretting what was past, and representing the present dangers of the State by the unhappy Divisions of the King∣dom, he prevaileth with the Captain to sub∣mit to him, and to take Commission from him to reduce five English Ships, roving and robbing all along the Coast; which with small loss and trouble he performed, assisted only with two Ships, the English Ships are brought from Dunbar (where the Conflict was) to Leith, and their Captain presented to King James, who munificently rewarded Sir Andrew for this gal∣lant piece of Service. In the mean while the Nobility, who were Loyal to the late King, send their Messengers to their Friends, adjuring all such as had any sense of their present oppressions, not to be so stupid as to endure the Usurped Power of those Men, who breaking through all the Laws of God and Man, Murthered the last King, detaining upon the matter this present King under the bondage of their own Wills, which tyranny was so much the rather not to be endured, because they arrogated to themselves to be called the Restorers and Preservers of the Scottish Liber∣ties, when indeed they exercised a most cruel and unsupportable Tyranny, keeping their fellow Subjects in Slavery, and abusing the King's Authority, to the final destruction of all those who were faithful to his Father, and to inflame the affections of the People the more, Alexander Forbese, chief of that Family carrieth on the point of a Spear, through Aberdeen, and
all the cheif Towns, and Cities in the North, the King's Shirt, torn in divers pieces, and all bloody by the Wounds his Majesty received; inviting all Men who had any sense of Huma∣nity or Religion, to avenge that horrid Mur∣ther: the Earl of Lennox bestirring himself on this side Forth, to the same purpose, an Army in this Popular fury rolleth together as in a mo∣ment; marcheth to Sterlin, where finding the Bridge Fortified, resolve to Foard over some Miles above, where they that night Encamped without Order, or Watch, or any persons de∣signed for the exercise of Military Discipline: This looseness is bewrayed to the Enemy, who advanceth, Surpriseth all, Killeth many, and Imprisoneth more, some of whom, were af∣terwards put to death: Thus was this tumul∣tuary Army as suddenly ruined as raised. This Tumult over, King Henry of England in∣raged at the disaster of his five Ships, and look∣ing upon it as a publick dishonour, propound∣eth great Rewards to all such as would under∣take to bring to him Wood the Scotch Captain, dead or alive; Sir Stephen Bull undertaketh the Service, and with three choice Ships of the English Navy, setteth Sail, casts Anchor at the May, where he attends Captain Wood then re∣turning from Holland: in few days Wood appear∣eth; the Ships draw up, and give Fire, Fight∣ing bitterly all that day; next day morning the Conflict is renewed, they Grapple, and fasten by Iron Hooks their Ships one to another, fighting with that eagerness, that none of them perceiving
the motion of the Tide, all are carried over to the Mouth of Tay, where the Water being shallow, and the English Ships great, and in dan∣ger of the Sands, the English are forced to yield; the Ships are brought to Dundee, 10. August, 1490. Sir Stephen Bull, and other the most emi∣nent Officers and Gentlemen are brought to King James, by whom they were Nobly en∣tertained; after much commendation of their Valour, he grants them their Liberty, desiring them to return with their Ships, with a tender of his Royal Respects to their Master, King Henry. King Henry much pleased, returneth thanks to King James, declaring the great Esteem and honourable Respect he bare to him for his Royal and extraordinary Munificence. By this time a Parliament is called in Eden∣burgh, where his Majesty endeavoured by all possible means, a Composure of the grand Di∣visions of the Kingdom; some Laws are enact∣ed for preservation of the Peace, and the late unhappy Battel nigh Sterlin, where the King was Slain, is so hudled up, that the business of that Day should never after be remembred to the Prejudice of either Parties; a very strange Close, considering that this Convention was composed most of such as opposed the former King: The moderation and discretion of the young King, not yet arrived at the Fifteenth Year of his Age, was such, that a Concord is made up far above all means, hope or expecta∣tion, every man had a dutiful regard to so hopeful a Prince.
Being thus setled the reflections of his Grace appear daily more evidently towards his Fa∣thers Friends; two of his own Cousins, Daugh∣ters to his Aunt Mary, he bestows in Marriage to two Eminent Men amongst them; the one (Daughter to the Lord Boyd) to the Lord Forbese, the other, (Daughter to Earl Hamilton) to Ma∣thew Earl of Lennox. And to Manifest the deep sense he had of his Father's Fall, he begirt himself with an Iron Chain, as I have mentioned before; which galled the hearts of the Rebellious Fa∣ction, his pretended Friends, more than it did his own Flesh, though it made impressions therein deep enough; insomuch that Fear more than Love restrained them from breaking out against him. About this time a strange Monster was born in Scotland, a Male Child, which from the Navel downward differed nothing from the common form of other Men, but from the Navel upward there were two distinct Truncks of the Body, with Head, Arms, and all other Members as to two several individual Persons: the Faces were one towards another, what the one did was by the advice and consent of the other, and if either transgress'd this Rule, Strife arose between them, and peradventure Blows, oftentimes Scratching, Nipping, and Pricking one another; if they received a Punch or Blow, below the Navel, both were sensi∣ble, but if above, where their Members were distinct only, he was sensible whose parts were
touched: This Monster King James carefully educated, and caused them to be instituted in the knowledg of Letters, wherein they marvel∣lously profited, especially in the knowledge of diverse Tongues; they were most exquisite in Musick, and both admired for the sweetness of their voices; they lived some twenty eight years; the one died before the other some three or four Months; by the smell of the defunct body, the survivor was much annoyed, and daily languished until the hour of his death. And about the same time too, a Monstrous Cheat came into Scotland, and much cherished by the King too, Peter Werbeck, who pretending himself to be Son to King Edward the Fourth of England, happily escaped from the cruel Claws of his Uncle Richard, had admittance to King James his presence, who behaved himself with a behaviour so beseeming his condition, and in a most elocuent Oration did so pathetically de∣liver himself, touching the distress of his Fa∣mily, and his own marvellous preservation, that the King and most of his Council, though not without the reluctancy of some of the wiser, took compassion of him, and resenting his con∣dition as the common interest of all Princes, with incredible, in consideration, promise him assistance towards the regaining of his just Rights; provoked, the rather, as was pretend∣ed, to satisfie such as opposed Peter's design, by the breach of Truce made by the English Ships whilst Scotland was gasping under the confusion of a Civil War, indeed the late horrid Rebel∣lion
in which James the Third perished: Peter is highly honoured, and exposed to the People by the Title of the Duke of York: a most ver∣tuous and beautiful Lady Katherine, Daughter to Earl Huntley, one of the chief Peers of that Nation, is given to him in Marriage; an Army is likewise levied, and marcheth into England; passeth quietly through Northumberland, no ad∣verse Army appearing, nay, nor any one Man coming in to own Peter the pretended Prince: King James admiring that no man would own him, persuading himself that it was not only Love to their own rest and quiet, but likewise dislike of his Claim and Title, returneth home with his Army, and Winter drawing on, Disband∣eth it: This sudden change smites Peter's Soul with sorrow; but such was his cunning that he pretends to be well pleased, devoutly professing rather never to come to his Crown, than to make his way through the blood of his People. King Henry hearing of the Scots return, re∣solveth for all that, to avenge himself; to which end he commandeth a powerful Army to be raised under the Conduct of the Lord Dawbeny: The Spring drawing on, and the Army ready to March, a Rebellion breaketh out in Cornwall, and diverteth all; King Henry is forced to wave his Northern Expedition, and to apply his Forces to Suppress the Western Insurrection.
The Scots hearing of an Army prepared against them, forthwith roll together some con∣siderable Forces, and with an Army of some Thousands of Horse and Foot, advance to the Borders of England; but such was the Wisdom of Richard Fox Bishop of Durham, and the Vi∣gilance of the Earl of Surrey, that the Scots soon return, no great harm done; the English follow soon after them, take, and demolish, the Laird of Aton his House, fome four Miles from Ber∣wick, and forthwith retreat. King Henry sendeth the Spanish Ambassador Peter Hialus (then lying at London, to treat of a Marriage between a Daughter of Spain, and Arthur, Son to King Henry) to Scotland, to use his best endeavours to compose the Differences between the two Kingdoms; King James yieldeth such a willing and ready ear to the Ambassador, that he forthwith sendeth to King Henry, to desire some English Commissioners to be sent down to expedite the Treaty so fairly begun: the King commandeth the Bishop of Durham to joyn with the Ambassador; the Commissio∣ners on both sides meet at Jedburgh: The English press the delivering of Werbeck to their King's Justice; the Scots desire to be excused, their Publick Faith being engaged for his Safety, which in no case must be violated. This blasts all hopes of Peace; yet such was the Wisdom of the Commissioners, that a Truce for some few Months was agreed on.
The Treaty dissolved, King James fairly dis∣misseth his chargeable Guest, Werbeck, with a very plentiful Viaticum, Werbeck Landeth in Ire∣land, thence Wafteth himself over into Eng∣land, and joyneth with the Remnants of the Cornish Rebels; is at last carch'd; confesseth the whole Cheat, and is Hanged: his Wife is by all much pitied, and honourably entertained by King Henry, from whom she received such a liberal Pention as honourably maintained her all her Life. New Stirs fall out between the Borders, by reason of some Wrongs done by the English Garison at Norham. King James complaineth, and required satisfaction of King Henry, who very fairly promised it; to which end the Bi∣shop of Durham is sent into Scotland, who by his wisdom very speedily composeth all things. At their Conferences, which was at Melcoss, King James makes known to the Bishop, the earnest desire he had to have Margaret, eldest Daughter to King Henry, given him in Mar∣riage, as a Pledge to assure a mutual Peace between the two Kingdoms; and craveth the Bishop's assistance in so good a work: The Bishop cherishes his desires, and chearfully pro∣miseth his assistance: To which purpose he presently posteth to London, and acquainteth his Majesty of England with the desires of the Scotch King. King Henry is well pleased with the proposition; whereof the Bishop gives speedy notice to King James: The Arch-Bishop of Glascow, and the Earl Bothwell, are dispatched
Ambassadors to demand the Lady in Marri∣age to their King; the Marriage is concluded in a very short time; the Espousals published at Paul's Cross; the Earl Bothwell Espoused her in the Name of King James: Next summer the Lady is sent into Scotland, attended by the Earls of Surrey and Northumberland: King James received her, attended by the cheif of his No∣bility at St. Lambert's Church in Lamermoore in Scotland, and the Year following Solemnly Married her at Edenburgh; for some Years following enjoying a sweet calm of Peace, they lived very happily: The King buildeth divers fair Edifices, as his Castle at Sterlin (which if he had lived to finish it in pro∣portion to its beginning, had been a most stupendious work) his Pallace at Falkeland, and some others: and divers Ships likewise he commanded to be built, such and so great, as in those days no Christian King had; but amidst all this prosperity and joy, the Iron Chain pincheth him, and his Father's untimely Death (to which he ever thought himself accessary, because by his Presence he countenanced and strengthned those Cruel hands which impiously Murdered him) lyeth heavy upon his Spirit. In this anguish of Spirit he resolveth, ac∣cording to the Superstition of those Days, to Travel to Jerusalem, there to Mourn away some part of his time, and to do such Acts of Penance as might expiate his Crimes; his Navy is prepared, his Attendants appointed,
neighbouring Princes acquainted with his de∣sign for his more safe and free passage; in the mean while, Wars break out between Spain and France, and by the earnest entreaty of the Spaniard; the English King sends over an Army to Invade the Kingdom of France; ma∣ny other Princes likewise combine against the French: King James perceiving such extraordi∣nary stirs, and not knowing what might be the issue of them, is perswaded by his Coun∣cil to lay aside his Journey for a season. The French King in this strait, earnestly soli∣cites him, according to their Ancient League, to make a diversive War against England; the Scottish Clergy put him on what may be, but all in vain, he resolves not to stir, having indeed no just nor honourable Quarrel, only with much ado he was at last wrought on to grant the sending out of his Navy for the guard of the French Seas, which proved the ruine of those gallant Ships before mentioned. James Hamilton Earl of Aran is sent Admi∣ral in this Naval Expedition, who, willingly it should seem, mistaking his way, arriveth at Knock-Forgus in Ireland, pillageth and burneth the Town; and as if he had performed a gallant and acceptable piece of Service, re∣turneth to Aire in Scotland; King James adver∣tised of this exploit and of his return, is highly inraged, gives Commission to Arehibald Earl of Dowglas, to take Command of the Navy, and Summons Hamilton to answer for the unsufferable wrong done to his Friend and
Ally: who having notice of the King's wrath, setteth Sail, and arriveth in France, disposing of his Tackling and all his War-like Instru∣ments, as seemed good to himself, he lay∣eth up his Navy in Brest, where it consumed to nothing. The restless Borderers soon weary of Peace, fall to their old trade of Depredation, mutual Inroads are made, and mischief enough done on both sides: and at this time two Scottish Merchants Ships are unhappily taken by the English Admiral: The Scottish King is much discontented, which the French Ambassador Lamote, layeth hold on as the fittest opportu∣nity to work him into a War against the English; his pernitious perswasions, seconded with the daily solicitations of the Scottish Cler∣gy, especially Foreman Bishop of Murray, his Ambassador then in France, prevail too much, and overcome him at last to denounce by his Herald War against King Henry then in France, who answered the Herald with expressions of the greatest disdain that could be; Arms are raised on both sides, the Scots under the Com∣mand of their King, the English under the Conduct of the Earl of Surrey: Both Armies advance, and at last joyn Battel at Flodden in Northumberland; the Battel is exceedingly furi∣ous, and continueth some hours within Night, the darkness whereof commandeth at last a Cessation of Arms: No man knowing on whose side the Victory lay, each Army think∣ing it self worsted: The Earl of Hume, who
traiterously refused to joyn in Battel; with his Brigade enricheth himself with the Spoil of the Field, and departeth by break of day: at which instant the Lord Dacres came into Field, and finding the Scotch Carriages without Guard and the Camp not wholly Pillaged, dispatcheth a Messenger to the Earl of Surrey forthwith to Rally, and to return, which was with marvellous Expedition performed; no Enemy appearing, and now the Day be∣ing up, the English Celebrate the Victory with great Joy. This Overthrow is reckoned by the Scots the greatest that ever befel them, not so much for the Number, as the Quality of the Slain, many of the Nobility and Gentry, be∣sides Five thousand common Souldiers were killed on the place; King James himself ne∣ver after appeared, what to determine of him, I know not; the English contend that he was killed in the Battel, his Body found and exposed to publick View; the Scots as∣sert, that the Corps so exposed, were the Re∣licts of Sir Alexander Elphinston, in Habit, Sta∣ture and Figure, resembling their King, as some others did that day, the better to en∣courage the Army: Some contend that he escaped into Scotland after the Battel, and was traiterously Murdered by the Retainers of the Earl of Hume nigh Kelso, to avoid his wrath for their Treachery on the day of Battel: and some there are who are bold enough to assert, that the King perceiving the huge Slaughter of the
Nobility and Gentry, privately withdrew him∣self, and in an obscure habit travelled as a Pilgrim to Jerusalem, to make good his former Vow, where he spent the remnant of his days in Sorrow: however it was, certain it is, That after the Battel he never appeared to the World: A Prince of a most comely Person, and of that moderation and temper, that no provocation could force from him any the least intemperate word, and yet a man of an undaunted, and indeed too resolute a Spirit, very much inclined to Mercy, never executing Penal Justice with∣out grief and sorrow of Heart. I leave him with that Epitaph he had bestowed upon him for his wanting of a Tomb. Fama orbem replet, mortem sors occulit at tu Desine scrutari, quod tegit, ossa solum. Si mihi dent animo non impar fata sepulchrum Augusta est tumulo terra Britanna meo.
THE LIFE OF JAMES V. JAMES the Fourth thus lost, his Son James, a Child of two years of Age is Proclaim∣ed King; the Queen his Mother (con∣formable to the last Will of the King, published before his last Expedition towards England, in which it was provided, that the Queen should have the Supreme Power du∣ring the time of her Widowhood, and the King his Minority) hath the Supreme Go∣vernment committed to her, and as a tender Mother, writeth with all earnestness to her Brother, King Henry the Eighth of England, imploring his Royal and Fraternal favour, particularly that he would be pleased out of his tender regard to her and her young Son,
to abstain from War against the Scots; King Henry very nobly returneth Answer, that the Scots should be choosers of War or Peace: this gladded the heart of the Scottish Queen, who assuredly by her discreet Government, had proved a Nursing Mother to that Nation, but that within one year she was pleased to Marry herself to Archibald Dowglas Earl of Angus, by which Marriage her Government determined; and immediately Divisions break out amongst the Nobility, touching the choice of a Vice-Roy: The Dowglasses wholly for the Queen; the Earl of Hume, a Person then of great Power and Authority, opposeth her, contending for a free Choice to be made of one of the Nobility; after much Debate, it was at last concluded that the Duke of Al∣bany (John, Son to Robert, Brother to James the Third) should be declared Vice-Roy; which being done, Letters are dispatched to him, then an Exile in France: The Duke ac∣cepteth the Honour and Charge, and arriveth at Dunbarton about the 8th. of May, 1515; forthwith in Parliament is the Duke restored to his Patrimony, and declared Vice-Roy. The Vice-Roy beginneth his Government in a Progress all the Kingdom over, endea∣vouring to establish Peace among all. The Earl of Hume, the great Instrument of the Vice-Roy his advancement, finding him∣self much neglected, repenteth him of his Ser∣vice done to him, and tenders the same to the Queen, whom he formerly opposed, suggest∣ing
to her the danger of the young King now in the hands of such a Vice-Roy; whose Fa∣ther for his traiterous Conspiring against the King, and his ambitious aspiring the Crown, was Exiled to his dying day, the present Vice-Roy his Son, born and brought up likewise in Exile, appearing a man of no less Ambition than his Father; the young King the only Rub in his way to the Crown, must needs there∣fore be in great danger, if some extraordi∣nary Expedient be not found out for his Safety; and in order hereunto he adviseth her, to withdraw herself and her Son into England, under the Protection of her Brother, who so largely the other day declared his Royal affection and favour towards her: All is soon and secretly bewrayed to the Vice-Roy, who immediately surpriseth the King and his Mother the Queen in the Castle of Sterlin: The Queen and all Dowglas his Faction, are re∣moved from the King, the Tuition of whom he commits to the care of three Noble Men, besides the Lord Areskin Governour of the Ca∣stle: The Lord Hume and his Brother with∣drew to England; the Queen and the Earl of Angus her Husband soon follow after; the Vice-Roy sendeth his Agents after them, and complaineth of their Causeless departure: All of them are by their Friends perswaded to return, the Queen only, being heavy with Child, is advised to stay, where soon after she was brought to Bed of a Daughter, Named Margaret.
The Earl of Hume Summoned to appear be∣fore the Vice-Roy in a publick Convention, is Condemned, and his Estate confiscate because of non-appearance: Ten thousand Horse and Foot are raised to reduce him; which the Earl perceiving, he casteth himself upon the Faith and Favour of the Vice-Roy; by whose com∣mand Hume is committed to the Custody of James Hammilton Earl of Aran, engaging the Earl under pain of Treason for his Security. Hume glad of so favourable a Keeper, per∣swades Hammilton to withdraw with him, and to take upon himself the Supreme Govern∣ment, as being equal in Propinquity of Blood to the King, (though by a Sister) with the Vice-Roy himself; Hammilton hearkneth to him; the Earl of Lennox, Hammilton his Ne∣phew, joyneth with them; after a few Stirs they return next Spring to Court, are pardoned and reconciled. The Vice-Roy retireth to Faulkland, and af∣ter some Months, returneth to Edenburgh, and thither inviteth Hume and his Brother, who contrary to the advice of all his Friends, obeyeth: A Convention of his Peers is cal∣led: Hume and his Brother without objection of any Crime not formerly pardoned, are Condemned, and Beheaded at Edenburgh, their Heads likewise set up in the two most publick places of the City. The Vice-Roy next Winter passeth over in∣to France, leaving his Charge in the hands of Angus, Aran and Arguile, the Arch-Bishops
of St. Andrews and Glascow, to whom he ad∣joyned Darsie, Governour of Dunbar, a French∣man, assigning to each of them his Province; soon after Darsie is killed by the Humes, having, as they conceived, a chief influence in the Death of the late Earl; this Mur∣ther much troubled the rest intrusted with the publick Affairs; a Messenger is dispatched to the Vice-Roy to desire his return. After five Years absence, and much Confu∣sion all the Kingdom over by the Feuds, especially of Dowglas and Hammilton, the Vice-Roy returneth October 28th. 1521; Dowglas is Banished to France: an Army is raised to divert the English, then Warring in France, and marcheth towards the Borders of England: the Nobility refuse to March out of Scotland; the Vice-Roy much perplexed, sendeth to the Lord Dacres, Governour of the English Borders, and desireth a Conference with him; Dacres, the publick Faith being ingaged for his Safety, cometh into the Scots Camp, and after some Debate, a Truce for some Years is concluded. The Vice-Roy goeth again to France: King Henry notwithstanding of the Lord Dacres his Truce, sendeth an Army into Scotland, under the Conduct of Thomas Howard Earl of Surrey; af∣ter some waste done in Merse and Tividale, the Earl retreats; for revenge whereof the Scotch Borderers make Inroads into England, which provoketh the Earl to return into Scotland to set on Fire the Town of Jedburgh; which
done, he retreats the second time without sight of an Enemy. The Queen Mother, now returned from England, endeavours a Peace between the two Nations: King Henry (with a design to break off the Ancient League between the Scots and the French) tendereth a fair proposition of Marriage of his Daughter Mary to James the King of Scots: Some heartily embrace his Mo∣tion, pleading for a solemn League and Co∣venant with England, declaring the great Be∣nefits, which should redound, from such an Union, to both Nations; some again strange∣ly oppose it, pretending that the League with France, of the benefits whereof they have had so long experience, could neither in Policy nor Honesty be Violated; as for a Cove∣nant with England, though it be possible that some good may come of it; Yet, knowing that as Covenants, ratified by solemn Oaths, with hands lifted up to God, are amongst good Men the strongest of all Obligations; so by some others they are only made use on as Snares to entrap and Engines to catch the Credulous to their destruction, which done, then are Covenants laid aside as Almanacks out of date; Therefore, said they, Let us not be so fond as to relinquish our experienced God, for that which is in Hope only, and may possibly, ay, and probably too, deceive us. By this time the Vice-Roy landeth in the West with Three thousand Foot, and an Hundred Curasiers; at Glascow, divers new levied Forces
Rendezvouz with them; the Vice-Roy cometh himself to Edenburgh, calleth a Council of the Nobility, commendeth their Fidelity and Sta∣bility to the French, assureth them of the reci∣procal affection and constancy of the French to them and their Nation; and in fine, with all earnestness he inciteth them to an Expedition against England: This last motion takes not well, the Nobility attending him only to the English Borders, protest against an Invasion; the Vice-Roy is forced to abate of his vigour against England, yet the French must be sent to try their valour against Wark Castle, where being soundly banged, they return with hast enough to the Scotch quarters: King Henry vigilant enough towards his affairs, raiseth an Army of Forty Thousand Horse and Foot, marcheth towards Scotland, the Scots re∣treat to Lawder, a bitter Winter comes on, huge storms of Snow fall, all action inter∣cepted, and both Armies Disbanded. Next Spring the Vice-Roy passeth again over into France; the Queen, the Earls of Aran, Lennox, Crafurd and some others, take the opportunity of his absence, and accom∣pany the young King, not yet come to Age, to Holyrude House, where a Council of the Peers being called, by their advice the King takes the Government upon him, the No∣bility swear Fealty to him, and all Officers of State receive new Commissions from him.
The Earl of Angus hearing of this Mutation, returneth from France; Lennox and Arguile, neg∣lected in the publick Administration, receive him with much joy, in hope of some Mu∣tation of Affairs: to the Queen (now estranged from him in her affection) his return is no way pleasing; much less to Hammilton; (who then ruled all) his deadly enemy the Devil of Division begins now to Reign: the Queen and Hammilton abide at Edenburgh Castle as a place of greatest Safety: the Discontented Facti∣on assembleth at Glasow, advanceth towards Edenburgh, the Castle unprovided of all things needful for a Siege, yieldeth it self; they with∣in have liberty to march whither they please, the King only reserved and committed to the tuition of Angus, Arguile and Lennox, who were by course to attend him, every man his four Months, Angus Monopolizeth all Power into his own hands, this produceth Envy and Emulation; Arguile withdraweth, refusing to meddle; Lennox continueth at Court, but med∣leth not neither; both shew their dislike of Angus his Usurpation: A design is forthwith set on foot, by the King's own desire, to Res∣cue him out of the hands of the Dowglasses: The Scots a powerful Family in the South, attempt it; to that end they appear at Melrose with some Forces, a bitter Conflict falls out between them and Dowglas; the King himself and Lennox Spectators of the Fight, Dowglas had the Day, the chief and most of the Scots killed on the place, July 20. 1526.
Dowglas perceiving now plainly that Lennox was his enemy, by his indifferency in this Conflict, thought it high time to reconcile himself to the Hammiltons; the Agreement is made, Hammilton shares with him in the Go∣vernment; Lennox repaireth to Sterlin, sends to divers of the Nobility, consulteth with them touching the Rescue of the King; all resolve, and unanimously Assistance is promised accor∣dingly against a day appointed, before the day comes Lennox thought it necessary, if pos∣sible, to prevent the Conjunction of Dowglas and Hammilton; to that end he advanceth to Linlithquo, where the Hammiltons were drawn together; Dowglas then at Edenburgh, marcheth with all possible expedition, bringing along with him to countenance his affairs, the person of the King, who all along retardeth the journey, accounting Lennox more his Friend than those with him, pretending indisposition of Body, ever and anon dismounteth, ma∣king shew to pay some necessary office to Na∣ture; Dowglas frets, and in vain, spending many entreaties for expedition; at length George Dowglas, Brother to the Earl, is so pe∣remptory with him, as in most Rebellious terms to tell him, That rather than their Enemies should get possession of his Person, they would rend him in pieces, and divide him in halves between them: This Traiterous word made an indelible im∣pression on the heart of the King, though at present silence was his best and only return: At last the Armies joyn, Lennox and his Patty are
put to the rout, many slain, the Earl himself killed, bewailed of all; Hammilton and Dowglas both mourn for him; above all, the King is afflicted; the remnant of his Party with sor∣row and grief enough submit, and are all forced to compound for their Treasons, as was pretended, in bearing Arms against the King; the Earl of Cassils refusing to submit, was way∣laid and killed by one Hugh Campbell. Lennox his Death divulged, maketh a very deep impression in the hearts of most men, especially his own Retainers: one of his Ser∣vants resolveth with himself to avenge his Lord's death, on the Person of the Bastard Hammilton, by whom Lennox was killed: To that end he repairs to Edenburgh, and on his way meeting with one of his Fellow-servants, he asked him, saying, Didst thou see Hammil∣ton the Bastard, Yea said he, I saw him; and hast thou not killed him, unthankful Wretch, who mur∣thered our Dear Lord and Master? said the Fellow, Go and be hang'd, thou art not worthy to live; and with these words he pass'd on in his way, and came streight to Holyrude House, where in the Pallace-Yard stood Two thousand Armed men, all Retainers to Dowglas and Hammilton; there the Fellow walks, full of Re∣venge, and waiting the opportunity to execute the desire of his heart, Hammilton unawares, comes in his way without Arms, the Fellow falls upon him in the Penthouse under the Porters-Lodge, and wounds him in six seve∣ral places of his Body; the Armed men are
all presently in confusion, and well nigh in one anothers blood: The Hammiltons suspecting this bold attempt to be done by the Dowg∣lasses (newly only reconciled to them) to avenge some old Quarrels: The Fellow is at last apprehended (who had opportunity fair enough, had he attempted it, to escape with his Sword in his hand, still smoaking with Hammilton's blood; he is forthwith hur∣ried to Tolbnith, boldly professing that what he did, was to revenge the death of his Dear Lord, declaring with inexpressible confidence, that he was sorry for nothing, but that he was disappointed of his design so bravely be∣gun by him; he is put to Torture for the discovery of such as animated him to that bold attempt; his Flesh is seared with burn∣ing Irons, which he endured with such cou∣rage and resolution, as no man could spy either by his words or by his countenance, or otherwise, any the least sense of pain in him; at last his Right Hand was cut off, which he endured without shrinking, calling out to such as stood by, That unhappy Hand well de∣served this punishment, which executed not the design of a Resolute mind. The Dowglasses think themselves now secure enough, no man daring to oppose them in any thing: But in the midst of their securi∣ty, the King makes an escape from Faulkland to Sterlin, there the Nobility from most parts of the Kingdom fly to him, by whose advice his Majesty issueth out an Edict inhibiting
the Dowglasses any further medling in publick Affairs, discharging them or any of their re∣tainers under pain of Death, to come within Twelve Miles of the Court; this Edict being served on the Earl in his Journey towards Sterlin, he retreats to Edenburgh, and prepa∣reth Forces for his defence. A Proclamation issueth from the King to call a Parliament to Assemble November the 3d. in the interim his Army advanceth towards the City, Dowlas withdraws: The King peace∣ably entreth the City: Terms of Peace are offered to the Dowlasses, (viz.) That the Earl himself should confine himself on the North of Tay, his Brother George and his Ʋncle Archibald to the Castle of Edenburgh: The Conditions are refused; they are Summoned to appear be∣fore the Parliament, they disobey; the Earl himself, his Brother George, his Uncle Archi∣bald, and his dear Friend Alexander Drumond of Carnock, all by sentence of Parliament Ba∣nished: all People charged under pain of Treason not to relieve them; the Dowlasses break out into open Violence; Arguile is sent to reduce them to order, whose advance they prevented by flight into England. The King spendeth some time with great care and charge, in suppressing the Depre∣dations then very great on the Borders; which Expedition over, he establisheth the Court of Sessions (formerly indeed set on foot by the Vice-Roy, the Duke of Albany) Con∣stituted of Fifteen Judges of the most learned
of the Law, impowred to hear and deter∣mine all Civil Causes: a very grave Court, continuing in great Honour and deserved Re∣spect in that Nation to this day. About this time King Henry of England pre∣pareth for War against the Scots, irritated thereunto by the Scotch Exiles and Refuges in England; King James having Constituted the Earl of Murray his Vice-Roy, prepareth for Defence; by Mediation of the French, then a common Friend to both, Peace is con∣cluded. King James sends Ambassadors to France to treat concerning his Marriage to a Daugh∣ter of France: The King of England to pre∣vent it, sends the Bishop of St. Davids, and William Hrward Brother to the Duke of Norfolk, Ambassadors into Scotland, to invite King James to a Personal Conference with him∣self, whereunto he is soon persuaded by the great Promises they made of Marriage to Mary the King's eldest Daughter, if all other things succeeded well in the Treaty: The Scotch Council, especially the Clergy, fearing Inno∣vations in Religion then set on foot by King Henry, are much troubled that his Majesty had consented to this Conference; they ply him with continual surmises of Ruine to Himself, to the State, to Religion, should this Conference hold; the King is over-ruled and observeth not the day appointed, but forthwith Saileth into France, and is imme∣diately espoused to Magdalen, Daughter to
Francis King of France, the Marriage solemni∣zed on New-years Day, 1537, and both arrive in Scotland about the end of May following; within six Weeks after the young Queen Dyeth, to the inexpressible grief of all; the Nobles put on Mourning Apparel, not be∣fore that time in use in that Kingdom. Immediately after David Beton Cardinal, and Robert Maxwel, are sent to France to de∣mand Mary of the Family of the Guise, Wid∣dow of the late Duke of Longoville, in Marri∣age to King James; the Marriage is agreed to; the Year following she arriveth in Scot∣land, and the Marriage solemnized at St. An∣drews, 1538. This Year exemplary Justice was done up∣on divers Persons of Quality, conspiring the Death of the King; some the Year follow∣ing were Burnt, some Banished for embra∣cing the Protestant Doctrine Preached in Ger∣many by Luther and others. James Hammilton the Bastard accused of High-Treason, is sentenced to Death, his Head and Quarters affixed to publick places in Edenburgh: the King soon after thought in his Dream, that Hammilton cut off first his right and then his left Arm, threatning withal to appear again to take his own Life; the King awaking, is very much troubled with thoughts of this Dream, and revolving with himself what might be the meaning of it, a Messenger comes to him with the sad News of the Death of both his Sons at the same time,
the one at Sterlin, the other at St. Andrews. King Henry of England sendeth the second time to invite King James to a Conference at York; the Scotch Clergy still oppose it, and the Conference again refused: King Henry in great Indignation against his Nephew for re∣fusal of Conference with him, resolveth to talk with him in harder Terms, and to that end he raiseth an Army and sendeth it into Scotland, and under the Command of the Duke of Norfolk. The Scottish Ambassadors in vain, intreating a Cessation, King James pre∣pares a considerable Army for defence; the English enter into Scotland, and after some mis∣chief done, at the approach of the Scotch Army, they retreat; the Lord Gordon march∣eth before the main body with Ten thousand Men, doing much hurt and annoyance to the Rear of the English Army. King James with all earnestness presseth an Engagement with the English, the Nobility peremptorily oppose him in it; the King enraged, upbraid∣eth them with Cowardise unworthy to be owned as Sons of their Noble Ancestors, vowing that though they should all desert him, himself and his own Family alone should give the Enemy Battel: The Lord Maxwell, to pacify the King, tendereth his Service to lead into Cumberland Ten thousand Men, thereby to divert the Enemy: The King accepteth his Service, but being enraged against the whole Nobility, he resolves that none of them should have the Honour of any thing done
in that Expedition, and for the cause, giveth a Dormant Commission to Oliver Sinclare, Bro∣ther to the Lord Roslin. Having entred Cum∣berland, and now in view of Five hundred En∣glish Horse, Sinclare produceth his Commission, it is read at the head of the Army; Max∣well is thereby inraged, the whole Army fal∣leth in Mutiny, and in such a confusion that they become a Prey to the Five hun∣dred English Horse; divers of the Nobility and the new General Sinclare are sent Priso∣ners to the Tower of London: this dishonour∣able Disaster, which hapned at Solway, strikes the Valorous King with such grief and sor∣row that he never after joyed, but soon after departed this Life, having first made Peace with King Henry, at whose request he recalled Archibald Earl of Angus. Thus dyed King James the Fifth, a Prince of singular Endowments, most patient of Cold, Hunger, and Travel, sometimes setting on Horseback Twenty Four hours, when the ne∣cessity of his affairs required it; a great Justi∣tiary, and a person of singular Foresight and Wisdom.
THE LIFE OF QUEEN MARY. QUeen Mary was the only Child James the Fifth, her Father, left to Inherit the Crown, born to him not above eight days before his death. James Ham∣milton Earl of Aran is therefore chosen Vice-Roy, to whom King Henry of England sent his Ambassador, Sir Radolph Sadler, to pro∣cure Peace between the two Kingdoms, and to demand Mary in Marriage to his Son, by the influence of the late Prisoners in England, especially the Exiled Dowglasses (whom King Henry had wrought much to his Service by his Royal Favours) whose Counsels were now very prevalent in the management of pub∣lick affairs; both were assented, the Con∣tract
of Marriage Signed, and Pledges pro∣mised for better performance of all Condi∣tions agreed upon, notwithstanding of the Opposition of the Queen and Cardinal, who fearing the Subversion of Popery (still esta∣blished in that Kingdom) by this agreement, en∣deavour what they can to cross all: Tumults are stirred against the English Ambassador, and daily Affronts put upon his Attendants, in the Streets; the Ambassador complaineth, and demandeth the Pledges promised for con∣firmation of the Agreement lately made; exemplary Justice is executed upon the chief movers in the Tumults in answer to this Complaint; but the Cardinal, by the influ∣ence of his power, had so obstructed the matter of his demand, that not one of the Nobility would yield up himself voluntarily a Pledge to the English, and to such a busi∣ness none could be compelled. King Henry hereby provoked, seiseth all the Scottish Ships in the English Havens and Harbours, and proclaimeth War against the Scots, in the mean while the Queen Mother sendeth to France, to entreat the French King to send home Matthew Earl of Lennox, to strengthen her against the English Faction, otherwise Religion and the French League were like to come to nothing. Lennox is sent home, and forthwith levieth Four Thou∣sand men, and with this strong guard co∣meth to the Queen; the Vice-Roy inferior in Power, sends Commissions to treat for
Peace, by agreement the young Queen is com∣mitted to the Education of Four Indifferent Noble Men ingaged in neither Faction (viz.) the Lords Graham, Areskin, Lindsay, and Leviston; and accordingly they take charge of her at Sterlin, where all the Nobility do Homage to her: The Vice-Roy joyneth himself wholly to the Cardinal, which Conjunction so in∣rageth Lennox, that immediately he flyeth to Arms, raiseth an Army, marcheth to Leith, and provoketh the Cardinal to Fight; the Cardinal keeps himself close in Edenburgh Ca∣stle. Lennox through want of Provisions is forced to withdraw, and to put himself in a posture of Defence in and about Glascow. King Henry hearing of these Stirs, sends into Scotland to demand the custody of the young Queen until she came to years fit for Mar∣riage. The French Faction now prevailing, his Demands are refused: An Army is therefore forthwith sent into Scotland, under the Con∣duct of the Earl of Hereford, and a great Navy of Two hundred Sail, under the Command of Viscount Lisle as Admiral. The English enter the City of Edenburgh without resistance, first they Pillage and then they Fire it, and divers other Towns and Villages about it; the like fate befel the Town of Leith, and forthwith they return to England, laden with Spoil.
The Queen Mother writeth to the French King, and layeth all these mischiefs at Lennox his door, as the only enemy of their Peace and Union, by reason of his private Feud against the Vice-Roy for the death of his Father. At her Request Lennox is recalled to France, but finding the French King provoked against him, he still keeps to his posture of Defence: The Vice-Roy marcheth against him, and after some small bickerings, Lennox retireth into England, and is honourably entertained by King Henry, to whom he tenders his Service in op∣position to the French Faction then prevailing in Scotland, of which his Majesty so well ac∣cepted, that he gave to him in Marriage his Neice, the Lady Margaret Dowglas, Daughter to Margaret his own Sister (and Wife to James the Fourth) by her second Husband the Earl of Angus. Lennox and his Friends most of them have their Estates confiscate. The English re-enter Scotland, Fire Jeeburgh and Kelso, waste most of the Countrey thereabout, and leaving a Garrison at Coldingham, they return home with their Booty. The Vice-Roy in the depth of Winter lay∣eth Siege to Coldingham, and all on the sud∣den retireth to Dunbar, leaving his Army, in which he durst not confide, at the Siege: by this unexpected desertion, the Army falls into Confusion; by the wisdom and valour of the Earl of Angus, the Cannon and all other things belonging to the Army, are safely brought off and carried to Dunbar.
Next Spring Thomas Duke of Norfolk, is sent down with an Army to joyn with that on the Borders, with a design to reduce all on this side forth to the Obedience of the English: The Vice-Roy by the incouragement of Angus, marcheth toward the Borders, and at An∣cram, obtaineth a Victory over the English; which Disaster much inraging the English King, the Vice-Roy sends to France to crave assistance, Three thousand Foot and Five hundred Horse are granted, and sent under the Command of Sir James Montgomery, by whose assistance the Vice-Roy marcheth in a Plundering Ex∣pedition within the English Borders, and soon after Disbandeth his Army; next Winter Montgommery returneth to France. And now some Stirs begin by such as endea∣voured some Mutations and Reformation of Religion. George Wisheart having fallen away from Popery and embracing the Reforma∣tion begun, in Germany is apprehended, and at a Council of Bishops and some others, held at St. Andrews, is Condemned as guilty of He∣resie: The Cardinal sendeth to the Vice-Roy to desire the Law to be executed against him, who wisheth the Cardinal not to be too hasty, but to forbear a little, which distasted the Cardinal not a little; at whose command forthwith Execution is done upon him at Saint Andrews, the Cardinal beholding the Tragedy from his Windows, not without some Pomp; which Wisheart perceiving, said to the Governour of the Castle standing by
him, He who now insulteth over me, shall in few days be tumbled over the same Window, with more disgrace than now he setteth with state: At the ut∣tering of which words he is strangled to death, and his Body burnt to ashes. This fact of the Cardinal and the manner of his proceeding without the Authority of the Vice-Roy, gave distast to many; at last his Death is contrived and perpetrated by Norman Lisle, Son to the Earl of Rothuse, whose discontent arose from the refusal of a private grant, which the Cardinal conceived not fit to be yielded to him: Lisle calls some sixteen Con∣sorts together, to whom he discovered his intent, craving their concurrence, all was agreed unto, the time and manner is appoint∣ed for execution; over Night, they come pri∣vately to St. Andrews, and lodge severally in divers Inns to render themselves the less su∣spected: next Day morning by break of day, two of the Conspirators come to the Castle, and being known Men, the Porter openeth to them, they enter, and the rest follow streight; the Porter is laid fast, and all the Cardinal's Servants secured, threatning them with Death if once they whispered: which done, they repair to the Cardinal his Cham∣ber, they knock; the Cardinal admiring what this should mean, that Strangers, and none of his Servants, should at such a season come to his Chamber-door, refuseth to open; Norman Lisle well known to him and a man much favoured by him, protested they minded him
no hurt at all, but that they had a matter of great Importance to Communicate to him, the dispatch of which required that their unseasonable coming to his Chamber; the Cardinal trusting their Protestations, openeth his Door, they enter, fall forthwith upon him, and barbarously Murther him: By this time News are carried into the City of the Surprisal of the Castle: The Cardinal his Friends and Retainers immediately Arm, beset the Castle, threatning the death of all within if the Cardinal were not preserved alive: the Murtherers told them it was too late, and therewith cast his dead Body, bar∣barously cut, over the same Window from whence he beheld the Tragedy of the late mentioned Martyr George Wisheart, which ad∣ded not a little to the high Opinion the Peo∣ple had of Wisheart, remembring the last words he spake concerning the Cardinal. This Impious Murther highly provok'd the Court; the Vice-Roy Summoneth the Murtherers to appear before him, they re∣fuse, and are declared Traitors: but they ha∣ving seised the Cardinal his Treasure, and having in their power the Vice-Roy his Son, who then remained with the Cardinal, and confiding in the strength of the Castle, stand upon their guard: The Vice-Roy layeth Siege to the Castle, and after some four Months Siege in vain, he withdraws his Force, and returneth to Edenburgh to be present at Parliament then ready to Assemble: and
now behold the Judgment of God upon those Barbarous Murtherers, they being for∣merly Men in all outward deportment, not only Civil, but Religious, and reputed Men of tender Consciences, give themselves now over to all manner of wickedness, Murthers, profane Swearing, drinking to Excess, and Whoring, were things of course with them, their wickedness came to this height: The Vice-Roy, too slow in avenging so much Wickedness, layeth again Siege to the Castle, assisted with some French Forces, after much Battery, they are content to deliver them∣selves to the French Admiral, Monsieur Stro∣zius; upon Quarter for Life, they are set on the French Shoar, and disperse themselves; all of them living ever after in great Misery, are in their several turns pursued by the wrath of God, to violent and untimely Ends. About this time the Duke of Sommerset (now after the Death of King Henry) the Lord Protector of England Invadeth Scotland with a powerful Army, the Vice-Roy all on the sudden rolleth together Thirty thou∣sand Horse and Foot, to whom the English Protector sendeth a very fair Letter, requi∣ring their young Queen may be assured in Marriage to the young King of England, ac∣cording to former Agreement; and for their better Security, he demands the said Princess may be Educated not in any Foreign Country, but at home, until she come to such years as
might inable her to make her own Choice: Further desiring, that in the interim there might be Peace between the two Nations, and no treaty of Marriage admitted with any other Prince: All which being granted, the Protector promiseth, not only to with∣draw his Army, but likewise, to make rea∣sonable satisfaction for all the hurt he had done; to all which Proposals the Scottish Vice-Roy returns no Answer: The two Ar∣mies appearing in view one of another, the Earl of Huntley sendeth an Herald to the Pro∣tector, offering Combat, either single, or Ten to Ten, or Twenty to Twenty, for the de∣termination of the Quarrel, and for avoiding the effusion of Christian Blood: the Protector inraged, by the slight of his last Letter, slight∣eth the Challenge: both Armies Engage in Pinkey Field nigh Musselbraugh; in a bitter Con∣flict the Victory at first on-set inclineth to the Scots, many English slain, their Horse put to Rout, the Scots pursue; and having spent their Shot, return to the main of their Army in some Confusion, the Main observing in what Disorder that strong Party returned, supposed the English to be on their Rear; all on the sudden, possessed with a Panick fear, they cast down their Arms, and run; the English Rally, and pursue with no small Execution: divers, both of the Gentry and Clergy, are killed; many Prisoners of all sorts; one of the Scottish Lords a Prisoner, being demanded how he liked the Marriage
of the Scotch Queen to the English King; I always liked the Marriage, saith he, but upon my Faith, I fancy not the Wooing, by Fire and Sword. After this Victory which happened to the English, April 10. 1547, Louthian is most burnt and wasted by them, the Islands of Inchkeeth and Inchcolme, and the Castle of Brochty, Fast Castle, Hume Castle, Lauder and Roxbrough, all Garrisoned by the English, the rest of the Army returneth into England. The Scottish Nobility Assemble at Sterlin, to consult what to do in such an Exigent as then the Affairs of that Nation stood in: the young Queen is safely conveyed into France; Ambassadors are likewise dispatch'd thither to crave Assistance according to their League: Six thousand Men are granted, and arrive at Leith, under the Command of Monsieur Dessins; by whose assistance the Vice-Roy layeth Siege to Hadington, which proving too tedious a business, Dessins march∣eth into Tividale, and from thence maketh divers Incursions into England. Dessins is cal∣led home, and Monsieur Termins is sent over to Command the French: They again pre∣pare to lay Siege to Hadington, which the English understanding their Stores being spent, they Fire the Town, and withdraw; some other of their Garrisons are likewise deserted, and some surprised by the Scots, and all on the sudden the English are wholly voided out of Scotland, and in May following, the French return into France.
Next Year, 1552, The Queen Mother Sail∣eth into France, whither likewise the Vice-Roy sent the Lord Carnegi Ambassador, to render thanks for their Seasonable Assistance: He is honourably received and entertained: The French King earnestly desires that the Vice-Roy would deliver up his Government in∣to the hands of the Queen Mother: The Ambassador ingageth himself to imploy all his interest that his Majesty's desire may be satisfied; and forthwith returneth, accompa∣nied with the Bishop of Ross, then Legier in France: Both move the Vice-Roy to satisfie the desire of the French King; the Vice-Roy, with much ado, yields his assent, he being first discharged in Parliament of all Accompts which ought to be made by him as Vice-Roy, which accordingly was done, and no other thing required of him, save that he should promise upon Oath to deliver what∣ever he had in present possession belonging to the late King. The Queen Mother returneth into Scot∣land, accompanied with one Monsieur de Oy∣sell, appointed to assist her in Council, and in a Parliament held at Edenburgh, the Vice-Roy delivereth up the Regalia into the hands of Monsieur d' Oysell, who received them in the Name of the Queen, and deli∣vered them to her by consent of Parliament, by the Title of Queen Regent, Anno 1555. These things exceedingly please the French King: The Vice-Roy is created Duke of
Chastellhe-Roy, and Twelve thousand Livres given him in a Yearly Pension, and he declared in the Scotch Parliament, Heir to the Crown, should the young Queen dye without Issue: The Queen Regent gives the first Essay of her Government, against the stubborn Red-Shankes, amongst whom were many Notorious Robbers, all reduced into Obedience by the Queen Regent, with little noise, and admired success. After this Highland Expedition, a design was set on foot by the French Council about the Queen Regent, to conduce a certain num∣ber of Mercinary Souldiers, as a standing Army, for the Defence of the Kingdom, for maintenance whereof, a certain Monthly Rate was to be setled on all the Real and Personal Estates, proportionably through the whole Kingdom: This design is deeply Re∣sented by the whole Nobility and Gentry: Two are sent, the Lords, Calder and Weems, to declare their dislike of this design, and to represent to the Queen Regent, that this design, as it was without Precedent in that Kingdom, so it could not be endured, be∣ing not only Dishonourable to the whole Nobility, whose Ancestors, from whose worth they were not yet degenerated, have been a sufficient Guard against the strongest Invasions, and most desperate Insurrections that ever were, but likewise most Dange∣rous to the whole Nation, in regard that the boundless Lusts of such men, so impow∣red,
were like enough to break out into such Exorbitances as might confound all, and into such Insolences, as their very Masters and Maintainers might sooner mourn for, than mend; and that it could not in reason be supposed that Men of mean or no fortunes should be more tender of the welfare of the Kingdom, than such who by their Estates and Fortunes were interessed in the Com∣mon good, and that it could not be ex∣pected, that such Fellows, who had no∣thing to lose, could be so faithful and va∣liant in defence of other Mens Estates, as they whose large Fortunes and Families do engage them to assert the Liberty and Welfare of the Nation; and that it could not be apprehended that such Mercinary Men would be so tame, as willingly to lay down their Arms, when at once they must therewith relinquish their living at ease in the Cream of other Mens Estates, and re∣turn to their former painful and Mechanick Occupations: This Remonstrance was so lively represented to her Majesty, that she utterly disclaimed and cried out upon the Design, declaring the deep sense she had of all those Mischiefs which were so discreetly and timely represented to her. Soon after the young Queen Mary growing on towards years fit for Marriage, being of sin∣gular Beauty, and adorned with such rare and admirable Parts both for Vertue and Wis∣dom: the French King, Henry the Second (at
whose Court, whither she was conveyed soon after the Battel at Muslebrugh, she had such Royal Education as well became her Birth) very earnestly desired to Marry her to his Eldest Son, the Dauphine of France; to which purpose he writeth to the Queen Regent, desiring that the Scotch Nobility might de∣clare their Assent to this so much desired Mar∣riage, and forthwith to send over certain Commissioners to be present at the Nuptials: A Parliament is called at Edenburgh, the French King's Letters are read; three of the Nobi∣lity, the Earls' of Cassils, Rothus, and Cumber∣land; three of the Clergy, the Arch-Bishop of Glascow, the Bishop of Orkney, the Pryor of St. Andrews; two of the Commons, the Pro∣vost of Edenburgh, and the Provost of Montross are sent; they safely arrive and are honour∣ably entertained at the French Court, the Marriage solemnized April 24. 1558. in great State in the Church of Nostra Dama in Paris: the Scotch Commissioners, the chief days of the Solemnity being past, prepare to return to their own Countrey, abundantly satisfied, not so much by beholding the incredible Magnificence of the French Entertainment, as by observing the admired deportment of their most Gracious and Illustrious Queen. Be∣fore their departure, an unhappy dash of Discontent was given; the Chancellor of France is sent to them, to move, That the Crown of Scotland may be sent over into France for Coronation of the Dauphine, after
the custom and manner of the Kings of Scotland. The Commissioners refuse the motion, and soon after take their Leave of the Court, and return home: In their return, the Earl of Cassils, the Earl of Rothus, the Bishop of Orkney, and the Lord Cumberland, depart this Life. And now began the great Stirs touching Reformation of Religion, which we shall briefly touch: Certain Lords (assisted by some Knights and Gentlemen) who afterwards were termed the Lords of the Congregation, knowing the Heart-burnings of the People, occasioned by the Death of George Wisheart and Walter Mill, both lately Burnt for Reli∣gion; send privately their Scrolls all the King∣dom over, to receive the Subscriptions of all who favoured the Reformation of Religion; which being done, Propositions are sent to the Queen Regent by the hands of Sir James Sandelands, Lord Caulder (viz.) That all Popish Priests be forthwith removed, and Godly Ministers chosen by the People, established in their places; and that all publick Prayers may be said in the Vulgar Tongue. The Popish Bishops, though much inraged, yet make a motion and a fair offer, to refer all to publick Dispute; the Lords of the Congregation refuse all Dispute, whilst the Popish Bishops are their Judges: The Bishops make a second Tender; That if the Mass, Invocation of Saints, Prayers for the Dead, were continued in due esteem, together with the be∣lief of Purgatory; that then it should de lawful for them to use the Scottish Tongue in their publick
Prayers and Ministration of Baptism, and the Lord's Supper: This is likewise rejected by the Lords of the Congregation, who peremptorily ad∣here to their first Proposals, requiring the Queen Regent to hearken thereunto: Her Majesty yields to them, That it shall be lawful for them to use their Vulgar Tongue in their publick Prayers, provided all other Rights be duly observed, and none of their Preachers appear in the Pulpits of Edenburgh. They of the Congregation finding themselves discountenanced, and un∣satisfied; send John Ariskin of Dunne, a well learned Man, to Solicit the Parliament in their behalf, but with no success. In May following, another Parliament is called at Sterlin; thither Commissioners are sent, (viz.) Alexander Cuningham, Earl of Glen∣carne, and Sir Hugh Camphell Provost of Aire, to pacific the Queen Regent, provok'd by some Popular Tumults, and to pray that nothing might be denied through the occa∣sion of the said Tumults, which was former∣ly granted to them: The Queen Regent in much wrath, threameth the Banishment of their Ministers, as main Incendiaries. The Commissioners urge the remembrance and performance of her Promises, which she re∣susing, they peremptory, threaten and protest to renounce all Obedience to her, beseeching her in time to consider what Mischiefs were like to ensue thereupon.
In the interim the Ministers of the Con∣gregation, get into the Pulpits at St. John's Town: A Messenger is dispatched to Patrick Ruthuen Provost of the place, to Suppress them, and the Stirs made by them; the Provost refuseth the Service: A Messenger is likewise sent to Dundee to demand the Person of Paul Messan, a Popular Preacher, who pri∣vately withdraweth, and escapeth: A Gene∣ral Proclamation is likewise made, requiring the Celebration of Easter after the accustom∣ed manner: The whole Ministers of the Con∣gregation, disobey, who are therefore cited to Sterlin, May the 10th. to answer their Con∣tempt, for countenancing of whom a great Confluence rush thither from all parts of the Kingdom. The Queen Regent calls to her Areskin of Dunne, a Popular Man, and Re∣quests him to persuade the Multitude to re∣turn peaceably to their several homes, assuring him that nothing should be done against any of their Sect: by his means some return, more stay; whereby the Queen is highly provoked: such of the Ministers as were Summoned, and appeared not, are Banished to no pur∣pose. John Knox Preacheth at St. Johnston, and inflameth all; the Multitude forthwith brake down the Altar and all the Images in the Church, do violence to the Person of the Priest then attending to say Mass; into immedi∣ately after they rush into the Monasteries of the Franciscans and Dominioans, and by as∣sistance of the Souldiery then and there in
Arms, they spoil and plunder, and in two days lay all those stately Buildings level to to the ground; at Cowper of Fyfe, they do the very like. The Queen Regent, being informed of all these detestable Outrages, sendeth to the Earls of Arguile, Hammilton and Athol, to attend her with all their Retainers, which they forth∣with did, and advance to St. Johnston, May the 18. the Queen perceiving their Forces both greater and more resolute to Fight than her own, dispatcheth Commissioners, (viz.) the Earl of Arguile and James Stuart, Bastard Son to the late King, (who remained with the Regent on purpose to discover all her Counsels and Resolutions to that Adverse Fa∣ction) to the Lords of the Congregation to treat with them for Accommodation: Alex∣ander Cunningham, and John Areskin, above-na∣med, are appointed by the Lords to treat with them: Articles are agreed upon that the Forces on both sides should be Disbanded: The Queen, and the Nobility with her, en∣ter the Town for their refreshment, during their pleasure, without Damage to be done by any, the French not to approach within Three Miles of the Town: all other mat∣ters of Difference referr'd to the next Parlia∣ment. The Armies accordingly dismissed, the Queen Regent, and those of the Nobi∣lity, with her, are received into the Towns: Arguile, with James Stuart, abovenamed, with∣draw to St. Andrews: The Queen Regent,
jealous of them, and seeing no hopes of a lasting Peace, setleth new Magistrates; and having restored the Mass, leaves a Garrison at St. Johnston's, and returns to Sterlin, from thence sends threatning Letters to Arguile and James Stuart, to return to her, but all in vain, they now both publiquely joyn (with whom they were before in private ingaged) to the Lords of the Congregation: New Forces are levied on both sides, those of the Congregation assemble in great num∣bers, Vowing the Destruction of the Ad∣verse Party, enter St. Andrews (having De∣faced the Church at Carell, plunder, spoil and level to the ground the two Monasteries of the Dominicans and Franciscans, the Arch-Bi∣shop scarce escaping to Faulkland, where the Queen Regents Army lay) but the Queen understanding their approach, sendeth from Faulkland, where her self lay, and requireth Hammilton Duke of Casteaulroy, the Comman∣der in chief, to send Commission to Treat: Three of the most Popular Nobility are sent, yet could not prevail for any terms of Peace, all that would be granted, was the agreement to a Truce for eight Days, Pro∣vided that the Queens Army remove into Louthian, Whilst another Treaty may be had at St. Andrews; which accordingly her Army did: and imme∣diately Hammilton and James Stuart advance to St. Johnston, lay Siege to the Town, which in few days yielded to them: They proceed to Scone, which they consume with Fire; and
from thence to Sterlin, where all the Religi∣ous houses are pillaged and laid level to the ground, then advancing to Lithquo, the like is done there: then entring Edenburgh, they find business enough there to stay them for some days to demolish Religious houses, to purge the Churches from Images and beau∣tiful Sculptures, and to establish Zealous Preachers of the Reformation in them. The Queen having retreated to Dunbar, returned towards Edenburgh: when the Armies were ready to engage, by the Negotiation of the Duke of Casteaulroy, and the Earl of Morton, a Cessation of Arms was at last agreed on from July the 24th. to January the 10th. next following. In the mean time there was an universal toleration of Religion, and no Man com∣pelled to the use of any Rites or Ceremo∣nies therein; there was no Garrison to be placed at Edenburgh; the Priests were peace∣ably to enjoy the Tithes of the Church for that Year; no more Religious Houses were to be demolished or alienated: the Pallace-Royal at Holyrude House, with all there be∣longing to the Crown, were to be restored to the Regent: This Truce was firmly enough observed on both sides. But about this time Henry the Second of France, being forewarn'd of the Danger of that Day, was strangely killed in a Tilt, by the Earl of Montgomerry the now French King; and the Queen of Scots advertised of the design of James
Stuart, Prior of St. Andrews, to aspire to the Crown; writ Letters to him, adjuring him not only by common Duty, but likewise by the special Favours received, to return to his Obedience by deserting the Faction, in which he had engaged himself: where∣unto James Stuart returned his Protestations of all due respects to the King and Queen; but withal, peremptorily declaring, to ad∣here to those of the Congregation in de∣spite of all Opposition. This Answer is high∣ly resented, and a Garison of French is forth∣with sent into Leith; the Earl of Aran, Son to Hammilton, privately withdraweth from the French Court and comes into Scotland, where he joyns with those of the Congregation, with whom he likewise persuades his Father, the Duke, forthwith to joyn, and they im∣mediately attempt the Besiege of Leith, which the French reinforce with Two Thousand Men, sent over under Monsieur de la Broche, with whom came the Bishop of Ameans and three Doctors of Sorbon, to dispute, if Occa∣sion offered, the Points of Religion then in controversie. De la Broche, in capacity of an Ambassador, designed a Conference with the Lords of the Congregation, which they refused, requiring the return of the French into France, and the dismantling of Leith, otherwise no Treaty could be admitted.
The Queen Regent sendeth Forman, the King at Arms, to them, adjuring them to return to their former Obedience to their King and Queen, and to the known Laws of the Land, assuring them, that if they will promise to Disband their Army then at Edenburgh, her Forces at Leith (who had never been sent over, but that their re∣peated Insurrections necessitated their Ma∣jesties to do it) should soon be returned, notwithstanding the great Contempt offered to the French Ambassadors, to whom they would not so much as vouchsafe a Con∣ference, Protesting withal, that nothing should be wanting in her, to condescend to any thing, not inconsistent with Piety to∣wards God, and Loyalty towards their Ma∣jesties: In fine, She requires the Duke, his Son, and all others of the Nobility and Gentry, forthwith to withdraw from all such as were resolved still to disturb the Peace, under the pain of High — Treason. The Lords receiving this Message, are en∣raged, and in answered thereunto, return her a Suspension from her Government, and in the King and Queens Name, re∣quire her to forbear all exercise of Power under the pretence of any Title of Regent; assuring her that against all Hazards they resolved to regain the Town of Leith out of the hands of the French, and therefore out of the respect they had to her as their Queens Mother, they requested her to with∣draw
out of the Town during the time of the Siege; the like request they sent to the French Ambassadors and all their Souldiers, out of the respect they bare to the French: the day following they send their Commands,  requiring all Scotch Men, then in Leith, to forsake the Town; then the Besiege, or ra∣ther Blocking up of the Town began; some Skirmishes there were in which the Besie∣gers had still the worst of it, and in all Attempts were repulsed with loss; and what added to their Calamity, they begin to be jealous one of another; the common Soul∣diers began to Mutiny for want of Pay, whereupon they intended to mint their Plate, but wanted Tools to do it: in their streights they address to the English, to whom John Cockhurne is dispatched to Sir Ralph Sadler and Sir James Crofts, Governors of Barwick and the places adjacent, to supply their pre∣sent necessity with relief: some Money is granted, but Cockburne in his return is sur∣prised by the Earl of Bothwell, and sent Pri∣soner to the Queen. The Besieged frequent∣ly make their Sallies out of the Town to the great prejudice of the Besiegers, in so much, that at last they are forced to retire to Sterlin, where a Council was called to consider what was to be done in this Exi∣gency: John Knox Preached before the Coun∣cil; and persuading to a further action, and a constant prosecution of the work begun, be assures them of Success: The result of the
Meeting was, to send a Message to Queen Elizabeth, and crave her Assistance: William Mettelane is dispatched, and finds Friendly en∣tertainment in the English Court: He soli∣cites her Majesty's aid in the common cause of Religion and Liberty: Many of the Queen's Council dislike the Proposal, and declare, That help in this cause of Sub∣jects against Sovereign Authority, would be a President of most pernicious and dange∣rous consequence; others of her Council think and speak more favourably of it: At length the Queen's Zeal for Religion, and Enmity against the French, prevail with her, and hopes of Assistance is given; at Barwick Commissioners meet to sign Articles of Agree∣ment, which was, That in case any Fo∣reigner should Invade either Kingdoms, mutual assistance is promised the Queen to pay the English Auxiliaries in Scotland, and the Scottish Auxiliaries in England; and whatever. Spoils were taken from the Ene∣my, to be converted to the Queen's use; the Scots to receive and exercise the same Religion professed and used in the Church of England, and to send Pledges into Eng∣land, to remain there as Hostages during the Marriage of the French King and the Scots Queen, and one Year after. All Sealed and Ratified at Barwick, the 27th. of February 1560. Six thousand Foot and Two thousand Horse Auxiliaries, are
sent down under the Command of the Lord Grey, unto whom the Lords of the Con∣gregation joyn their Army at Hadington, and in this conjunction they march towards Leith, lay Siege to it both by Sea and Land, an English Navy lying then in the Road, many bloody Skirmishes there were on both sides: The French Bishop cometh into the Scots Camp, and from thence he went to the Castle at Edenburgh, to speak with the Queen Regent, retired thither for her safety and protection, and earnestly endeavours a Peace, but all in vain, the Scots not hearkning to any, unless the French were all in the first place sent home, which could not be yield∣ed to: at this time a great Fire happened in Lieth, which put the Besieged into a great Consternation; the English likewise fired the two Mills belonging to the Garrison, and assault the Town by Storm, but are repul∣sed with loss, the French quickly repairing the Breaches the English made; who at length begin to think the work tedious and full of trouble, they send to Queen Elizabeth, to know her pleasure; the Duke of Norfolk en∣courageth them much by sending them new Supplies, no less than Two thousand well appointed men, Assuring them that nei∣ther Men nor Money should be wanting so long as it was in his power to supply them; promising, if need were, his own presence; in the mean time he sendeth his Tent, and adviseth them to set it up in the
view of the Town: This gives Life to the business again, the Siege is renewed, and the Queen of England sends Sir William Cecil, one of the Privy Counsellors and Se∣cretary of State, and Doctor Wootton, Dean of York, one also of the Council, to treat with the French in order to a Peace; a meeting is appointed in July following, but in the interim the Queen Regent wasted with care and grief, dyeth at Edenburgh Castle; a Woman of singular wisdom and vertue, honoured by most of the worst of her ene∣mies, and her Death much lamented by all; after her death Commissioners are ap∣pointed and meet, to treat of an Accommo∣dation, which had then been agreed upon, but that the French insisted upon a freedom to carry home whatsoever Booty, Bag or Paggage they had got, whereof they had store by their Winters plundering of Fife, which would not be granted by the Scots; and therefore Acts of Hostility, Sallies and Onsets are made with various fortune and success: At last both Parties sufficiently weary and straitned in Provisions, the Treaty is re∣newed, and Articles agreed on, (viz.) That neither the French King, nor his Queen of Scotland, should thenceforth, use the Arms or Titles of England; and all Letters Sealed with those Arms should be called in within six Months space; that the French transport themselves with their Booties, Bag and Baggage, within twenty days, and that the
English supply them with such Ships as they should want, they leaving Pledges with the English until the safe return of their Ships: That Leith be delivered up to the Scots and Dismantled: That the Forts built by the French at Dunbar, be demolished: That the English immediately after the performance of Articles, do return into England: That the French should still keep a Garrison at Inch-Keeth, and Dunbar Castle: That an Act of Oblivion first past by the Queen and the French King her Husband, be af∣terwards Confirmed by their Authority in the ensuing Parliament to be held in August: On these Terms Peace was Pro∣claimed. Soon after the French King Francis dyeth; the Queen heavily afflicted with grief for the death of her Husband, and much per∣plexed by the turbulent condition of the state of France, resolveth to return into Scot∣land, and fearing the English Navy, by rea∣son of an Offence given to Queen Elizabeth, by placing the English Arms in the Scots Coat, she privately goes aboard a small Ves∣sel (which none would suspect to be Fraught with so rich a Cargo) and safely arriveth in Scotland; immediately before her arrival, her base Brother James procured a Commis∣sion from her to hold a Parliament, which was accordingly done: The French Ambassa∣dor moveth, That the French League may
be renewed, and that which the English lately made may be broke off, and that the Revenues of Ecclesiastick Persons may be restored to them: But the Scots Parlia∣ment (now wholly constituted of such as pretend to the Reformation of Religion) an∣swered, That the French League should be continued, but that with the English could not be broken without the greatest Disho∣nour and Ingratitude in the world: The Restauration of the Revenue of the Ecclesiasticks was wholly rejected, and an Act passed for the demolishing all the Abbies and Priories in the Kingdom, which was immediately put in execution. The sorrowful Queen being arrived, had no better remedy than Silence and Conve∣nience, and was forced to condescend, That the state of Religion, as it was lately re∣newed and established by the Lords of the Congregation, should not by her nor her Authority, suffer any Change or Alterati∣on; no Mass to be said publiquely any where except in her Majesty's Chappel, which was all the indulgence the Lords would afford her. The Ministers (moved both by their own Zeal, and the Instigation of the Earl of Arran) Cry out and Thunder in their Pulpits against this Permission, and Ad∣monish the Lords of their Duty, to reduce her, to order a submission to, and a suscep∣tion of the Directory for publick Worshin:
The Nobility, notwithstanding all these over∣loud Clamours, encroach not upon the Queen's privilege, for which the Ministers turn the edge of their Tongues as sharp as Swords against them, crying out of their Apostacy and lukewarmness in the Cause of God. William Mettelane is sent Ambassadour to England, to tender to Queen Elizabeth, the great Respects of the Scottish Queen towards her; and with this Message the Lords sent also their Letters to the Queen, humbly thanking her for her late Seasonable Assi∣stance, and requesting her to continue her Princely Favour towards their Queen, and a firmer establishment of Union between both Kingdoms, as an Expedient thereunto, they propound to her Majesty, That she would be pleased to pass an Act of Parliament, Declaring, That in case her self should dye without Issue, the Queen of Scots to be her rightful Heir and lawful Successor to her Crown. This last motion highly displeased Queen Elizabeth, saying, That it was most unreasonable to require her to Sew her Winding-Sheet with her own hands, and to expose it every day to her own view. After much Debate, it was at last agreed upon, First, That the Scots Queen should forbear the English Arms and Title of the Queen of England and Ireland, during
the Life of Queen Elizabeth. Secondly, That the Queen of England or her Heirs of her Body, if such should happen, should not do any thing to the prejudice of the Queen of Scotlands Title to the Crown of England. Thirdly, That a mutual Care may be had to preserve the Peace and Union of both Kingdoms. These things happily concluded, there was a fair prospect of a flourishing State, had not the heart-burnings and emulations of the Religi∣oso's of Scotland fermented, and by the restless Tongues of their Preachers, discomposed all their Settlement, they who swell the least punctilio's, that are disgustful to them, into Enormous Crimes, did not whisper but cry aloud that the Queens designs were all to re∣induce Idolatry and Superstition, the Earl of Arran contriving withal to get the Queens Per∣son into his Power and Disposal (the safety of her Person being the only rub in his way to the Crown. But the Queen having timely Notice of all these Projects, appointed a good Guard to At∣tend her Person, which was maliciously inter∣cepted by Adversaries as a Foundation prepa∣ratory to a Tyrannical and Arbitrary Govern∣ment. The Winter following the Queen know∣ing what influence her Base-Brother James had in the Affections of the People, and Popular Ministers, whose grand Patron he was, and
not Ignorant of his own Ambition is soon moved to Create him Earl of Marr, and soon after Earl of Murray, which highly displeased the Earl of Huntley the greatest Peer in the North, conceiving himself and his Jurisdiction thereby prejudiced, and proved the grounds of a great and lasting feud between them. More∣over Anne Keith the Earl Martials Daughter is given him in Marriage, his Greatness is not only Envied by the Gourdons, but also by the Hamiltons, who look upon him as a dangerous Competitor to the Crown, mutual contrivances there are to Ruin each other, the Hamiltons as it was suggested, Conspiring the Death of Murray, by the Wisdom of the Queen their Feuds are kept from breaking out into open Hostility, only in the North a Skirmish hapned between Huntley and Murray, in which Huntley himself was taken Prisoner, and immediately dyed, not so much with the Wounds in his Body as in his Mind, his two Sons John and Adan are likewise taken Prisoners, and carryed to Aberdeen: John is there beheaded, whose un∣timely death was much bewailed by the Queen, Adam being very young is pardoned, the Eldest Son George flies to Hamilton his Father in Law, for Sanctuary, who begs his Pardon of the Queen, but by the prevailing Power of Murray (who then over-ruled all) young Huntley must be delivered up, and is sent Prisoner to Dunbar, from thence he is called to Edenburgh, and there Condemned for Treason, and returned a Prisoner to Dunbar.
In May following the Queen is Crowned in great State at Edenburgh, and about Michaelmas after by the Queens favour and approbation, Matthew Stuart Duke of Lennox, after 22. Years absence returns to Scotland, and hath his whole Estate restored to him to the great con∣tent of the Queen: the next Spring his Son Henry the Lord Darnly also arrives, a man of a very comely and proper Person, and behaves himself in the Court with such Civility and Prudence that the Queen with small Arguments was induced to cast her Affections upon him, and to accept him for her Husband, in order whereunto he is first Created Duke of Rothesay, and Earl of Ross, and at last (in despight of all the opposition that Murray could make by the instigation of Queen Elizabeth against it, who to prevent the Marriage sent Sir Nicholas Throgmorten to Require Lennox and Darnly to return to England upon pain of Confiscation of their Estates) the Marriage is Solemnized at Edenburgh July, 28. with consent of most of the Nobility, and by the publick Herauld, Henry and Mary are Proclaimed King and Queen of Scotland, this Marriage uniteth Hamilton and Murray, who with Arguile, Glencarne, Rothes and others, Com∣bine against the present Proceeding, and upon the Summons to return to their former Obe∣dience, they all refuse, and are Proclaimed Traitors: the King and Queen advance to Glascow with an Army of 4000 men and up∣wards, the Rebels stay at Paisley, not wholly Unanimous in their Counsels, Hamilton's Advice
tending to no less than the destruction of the King and Queen, ever inculcating in the Ears of his Complices, 'That howsoever private Feuds might be otherwise compromised, yet the Enmity of Kings could not any other way be extinguished but by their Death; the rest of the Nobility knowing this to be an Hellish De∣sign of his own, out of the Ruin of the Queen to raise himself to the Throne of Scotland, divide from Hamilton and retire towards Dumfreis, and from thence they Fly into England. About this time some Discontents unhappily arise between the King and the Queen, and by the occasion of the ambitious and malitious surmises of ill disposed men, the King is En∣raged  Seigneur David a French man, the Secreta, as an Instrument of Mischief between him and the Queen, their Wicked Design to make the Breach greater between them not being discerned by the King, he (as being naturally too flexible and credulous) is wrought upon to joyn with them in the De∣struction of the Secretary. On the Night ap∣pointed for that horrid work of darkness, the King took with him the Earls of Morton, Linsay and Ruthen, besides five or six more Armed Men, himself first entring the Queens Chamber, and Ruthen following him, he finds the Secre∣tary set at Supper with the Queen, and spying them he arose, and the Queen offering to in∣terpose, he clasps fast hold about her wast, who not knowing the Design, cryes out, but the
King forcing David from his hold, pacified her assuring her That there was no hurt intended her, only the destruction of one Villain that was about her, whom he runs through with his Sword, and then they all drag his wounded Body into an outward Room, and striving who should give him most wounds they cut his Body all to pieces. The City of Edenburgh hearing of a Tumult at Court, but altogether Ignorant what the matter might be, put themselves suddenly in∣to Arms, and forthwith march to Holy-rood-house, the Kings Pallace and the Guard being full of Armed men, the King calleth to them out of a Window, that there was no danger attending them, himself and the Queen being in health and safety, he thanked them for their Care and Readiness, and advised them for the present to return home peaceably to their Houses. The Day following the Noble men who lately fled into England appear (according to a late Summons they had received) to An∣swer what should be objected against them, no Judge, Accuser nor Witness, appearing against them, they there protest their readi∣ness judicially to Answer all things chargeable upon them, every one returns in Peace to his own Lodging.
The Queen Accompanied with the King, retireth to Dunbar, and admitteth Murray and Arguile into her Favour, and Consult the raising of some Forces to avenge the Death of the Secretary Murther'd in her own presence, the chief of the Murderers were fled into England, others into the Mountains, and of the meaner sort some were Fined, some Imprisoned, and some Executed. Her Majesty soon after upon the 29th. of June is brought to bed of a Young Son our Second Solomon, James the Sixth, and great State and Solemnity there was at the Christning, where were present Three Ambassadors, One from England, and another from France, and a Third from the Duke of Savoy: but the King being out of the Queens Favour, was not ad∣mitted to the Solemnity, but repairing to his Fathers house fell Sick on the way, not with∣out suspition of Poyson, there he continued languishing until the January following, when the Queen went to visit him, and all differ∣ences being made up, he resolved though not well, to return with her to Edenburgh, where Lodgings remote from the Noise of the Pallace, for Quiet, Privacy, and such like Convenience, (as it was said) were provided for him, but he had not stayed here above a Formight be∣fore his Lodgings were blown up with Cun∣powder, though it was supposed that he was Murther'd before in his Bed, his Body being found in a little Garden by his Lodging in the
Kirk-field within the City of Edenburgh, Cloathed with nothing but his Shirt, his other Cloaths and Slippers laid by him, but not a Bone of him broken, no bruise nor blackness was seen upon him, nor any alteration of that kind appeared in his Body, which was also free from all smell of Fire or Powder. The News of this Murther amazed all, and astonished the Afflicted Queen almost to Death, then lying at Holy-rood-house, and there was nothing but Sadness to be seen in the Faces of all men, every one crying out upon Murray and Morton, as the Contrivers of this Horrid Murther, which Murray perceiving, cunningly endeavoureth to transfer the Guilt upon Bothwell, by the secret surmises of some (whereof there were a great many) of his Emissaries, and causeth Papers to be scattered about the City for that purpose, not without some Reflections on the Queen. Bothwell sensible of the weight of this Burden thrown upon him; earnestly Laboureth with Arguile the Justice-General of the Kingdom to Discover if it were possible, both the Contri∣vers and Actors of the Horrible Murder, all imaginable Enquity was made, but nothing found. Lennox at the instigation of Murray, pres∣seth the Queen to bring Bothwell to Tryal, Bothwell receives Commands from the Queens Majesty to appear before the Justice General, and a Jury of his Peers are appointed in
Order to his Tryal upon the Twelfth of April, the High Court of Justice meets, and all Persons concern'd have due and timely Notice given them. Bothwell is Empannelled, and not∣withstanding Lennox his Protestation against the hasty Proceedings of the Court, alledging he had not time to prepare his Evidence, Bothwell is Acquitted by his Peers, but this Acquittance did not so much disburden him of the King's Murther, as it loaded him with his Enemies Malice. His Ruin and the Queens too, are still con∣triving, and as a more Politick Method than that of Slander, Bothwell is Advanced in his Reputation, and cryed up not so much by his Friends as his Enemies, for a man of the greatest Gallantry in the Nation, and in the Court he is Exalted to the Skies, though amongst the Popularity by the same Authors debased to Hell. The Queen her self made sensible of his Worth, and the many Extraor∣dinary Services he had done her, begins to shew him more than ordinary Favour, Murray tells the Queen That there was a Necessity for her to Marry, and that to some Peer of the Realm, of Worth and Valour, Times being so Tumultuous and Stubborn that they could not bear the Government of a Woman, far less of a Stranger, and therefore she must not think of a Foreigner, nay some Report, that Murray himself whispers her in the Ear, That Bothwell was the fittest, the only Man indeed
to make her an Husband, Bothwell in the mean time put on by perfidious perswasions on all hands to attempt this Royal Match, is much perplexed between Ambition and Fear, durst not listen to it, most of the Nobility subscribe an Instrument in which they declare their Desires and Assent to the Marriage with the Queen, Protesting that they would maintain him in it, with their Lives and Estares in despight of all who should oppose it, and assuring him that the Queen her self would approve of what they had done. This Instrument gave more Spirit to his Pride, and his Ambition suggested to him that the Queen designed her Favours as Indications of her Love, and Invitations to his belief of it, whereupon he resolves with him∣self being now Divorced from his Lady, to At∣tempt the Marriage of the Queen, to that end he Seiseth on her Person in her return from Sterling to Edenburgh, and with a Guard of 500 Horse, carrieth her to Dunbar, the Queen En∣raged with his Rudeness, Check'd him with all the Favours Conferred on him, chargeth him with the highest Ingratitude and Disloyalty. Bothwell with all Submission acknowledgeth his Offence; beseeching her that nothing could have moved him to forget that Obedience and Reverence due to her Sacred Majesty save the Force and Impulse of Love, not lightly begun but kindled and kindly Cherished by Sage Counsels, and Desires of most of the Loyal Nobility.
The Queen more suddenly now surprized than before, Expresseth her dislike of the Mo∣tion, though with some abatement of her Wrath, she being now under his Power from whence she knew not how to be delivered at present, the Earl produceth the Instrument sub∣scribed by the Noblemen, declaring their de∣sires and assents to the Marriage, then the Queen thirsting after her Liberty with a more serene Aspect, told him that nothing could be done in a matter of that Concernment unless she had her wonted Freedom, and the Nobi∣lity Liberty of Access to her, Bothwell perceiving that this was all that could be obtained of her, takes off his Guard, and honourably at∣tends her to Edenburgh, and the Queen peaceably resorts with a very Noble Train to the Coun∣cil Chamber, where most of the Nobility Advise her to listen to Bothwell, whereunto when she had given her Consent by vertue of their Counsels, and fastned her Affections upon him, every where by the underhand dealings of its Contrivers, the People are suborned and en∣couraged to Cry out against the Match, but notwithstanding the Clamors of the People, and the forwardness of John Craig Minister of the Parish, who refused to publish the Banns, and Protested against the Marriage; it was Celebrated upon the Fifteenth of May, in the Pallace of Holy-rood-house, by Adam Bishop of Orkney, after the manner of the Reformed Church.
And now their Enemies begin to appear more open Fac'd, for the prevention of their designed Mischiefs, the Queen desired the No∣bility to renew their Engagement which they had formerly Subscribed, the King and Queen promising the Restipulation of their Protection, which was accordingly done, Murray only re∣fuses to Subscribe the Bond, and gets leave to go into France, having first set some on work again to Embroyl the State, and to Blow up the Coals of Rebellion, the chief of them were the Earls of Arguile, Morton, Marre, Athol, Glencarne, and the Lords Lindsey and Boyd, but Arguile Repents him of the Confederacy, re∣turns to his Obedience and discovers the whole Design to the Queen: The others adjoyning to themselves the Lord Hume and others of the South, on the sudden they raise an Army of Two Thousand Horse, and closely Besieged the Castle of Borthwick, wherein the King and Queen lay, who next day happily Escaped, the Queen putting her self under the disguise of mans habit, came to Dunbar, where they Se∣cured themselves in the Castle, and thither re∣sorted divers of the Loyal Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty, for the Safety of the Queen, who resolves to Advance with her Forces towards Leith to disturb her Enemies then ranting at Edenburgh. They hearing of the Queens measures, forth∣with March, and nigh Musselburgh came in sight of the Queens Forces. The Armies lying in
View of each other and ready to joyn in Battel, the French Ambassadour interposeth himself, and endeavours a Pacification, assuring the Lords of the Queens Gracious Inclinations to them, and that she was ready to Pardon and Pass an Act of Oblivion for all that was past. They Insolently Replyed, That they came not to Crave her Favour, Nor (said Glencarn) to Ask Pardon, but rather to give it. The French Ambassador seeing no hopes of an Accom∣modation, retires to Edenburgh: the Queens Army begins to Divide and grow Mutinous, the Queen sends a Messenger to the Conspira∣tors, desiring them to send William Kircady the Laird of Grange; to whom she purposed to make some Overtures of Peace, and in the mean while no Acts of Hostility were to be offer'd, Kircady is sent, and the Cessation Agreed to, Bothwell returns to Dunbar, and the Queen offers to come into the Adverse Army, assurance being given her, That her Army should March off and Return without Molestation to their several Homes or respective Habita∣tions. They Accord to this, and the deserted Queen very debasingly Attir'd comes into the Rebels Quarter, where she was entertained with such Scorn and Contempt, with such Vile and Op∣probrious Language from the Soldiers, as is neither Tolerable not Fit to be mentioned. One Banner they had Contrived with the Picture of
the Dead King, and the Infant King James by him, with this Inscription, Judge and Revenge my Cause O Lord! This they carried upon Two Spears before her wherever she went, until at last her Spirits over-burdened with Grief, sank under it and she dyed away, and being revived and refreshed, they renewed their Insolencies towards her, and in Triumph carried her into Edenburgh, all bespattered with Gore and Re∣proach, and her Face so bedaubed with Dust and her own Tears which she had plentifully shed, that she was indeed a most rueful and deplorable Spectacle to behold, and all who had any sparks of Loyalty or Sense of Duty in them, are much Afflicted at the Sight; that Night she was sent to Craigmillars Lodgings, who was then Provost of the Town, the next day she is Conveyed by Ruthen and Lindsey to Lochlevix Castle, a Place Encompassed with waters on every side for nigh well a Mile. Bothwell during the time of the Queens Dis∣course with Kircady, makes his Escape first into Orkney, and from thence into Scotland. The Conspirators send to the Imprisoned Queen, and require her to Resign the Crown in Favour of her Son, and to name Guardians for him during his Minority, the distressed Queen is forced to yield to all that they had Confidence to De∣mand; She was through Fear and Flattery in∣duced to a Resignation of the Crown under her Hand, subscribing the Writ with Tears flowing from her Eyes, the Tuition of her
Young Son is Committed to James Earl of Murray, John Duke of Castle-Roy, to the Earls of Lennox, Arguile, Athol, Morton, Glencarn and Marre, James Earl of Murray is by this time returned from his Retirement in France, and by these Lords he is Chosen Vice-Roy, and the Young King now Two Years of Age, is Crowned at Sterlin. Murray is Confirmed in his Government as Vice-Roy in a Parliament Assembled, August 25. and the first Essay of his Power is against Bothwell, who now lay lurking with some few Ships about Orkney: Kircady is sent against him, who upon Intelligence fled into Denmark, and there miserably ended his Days, but with his last Breath Cleared the Queen of all Consent, Privity, or Knowledge of the King's Death, as did also Hephorn, Paris, Daglish, and other Servants of Bothwell, that were put to Death by Murray for the Murder, who upon the Gallows charged it upon Murray and Morton, as the Con∣spirators with Bothwell. Some Ambassadors arrive in Scotland from England and France, and desire Admittance to the Queen, but are peremptorily denyed it by the Vice-Roy, the hard Usage of the Queen, and the Insolence of that Ill Woman the Mother of the Vice-Roy was such, that many even of her Enemies who knew the Truth of it, were bowed into a Compassion towards her, and began to contrive some
Expedient for her Liberty, which the Queen her self not long after by her own Wisdom and Prudence, brought to pass. Guarded and Watched she was by the Vice-Roy's nearest Allies and trustiest Servants, his Mother and Three Brothers, which were of another Father, had the Charge of her, in a Place impregna∣ble, and out of which an Escape had been impossible considering the breadth of the Lake that encompassed it, had not God turned the hearts of some of her Enemies towards her, such was her Deportment in that grievous Re∣straint, and her Meek and Chearful entertain∣ment of all Affronts put upon her by the Vice-Roy's Mother, That one of the Sons, Half-Brother to the Vice-Roy, endued with some Principles of Ingenuity, and in whom were some Remains of Loyalty: out of a sense of Duty towards the Queen, begs her Pardon for all past, and her Favour for the future, promising his Service in order to her Freedom. A Boat is forthwith prepared, and with a few that were made privy to the Honest Design, the Queen escapeth April 5. 1568. the Guard in vain endeavour to pursue after her, all other Boats about the Castle, being by the Con∣trivers of the Escape made unserviceable, the Queen safely Arrives on the Shore, where Lord Seaton with some few Horse were ready to re∣ceive her, the first Night she is Lodged privately at Nudrie in West-Lothian, and from thence the next day she goes to Hamilton, where a considera∣ble Number of the Nobility and Gentry meets
her in Arms, and a great many of her Enemies Revolt from the Vice-Roy, and return to their Obedience. The Vice-Roy forth with Advanceth with an Army against her, and in a Battel at Landside near Glascow, the Queens Forces are overthrown, her self for Safety is forced to fly into England to shelter her self under the Protection of Queen Elizabeth, her nearest Cousin. The Regent or Vice-Roy, after his Victory packeth a Parliament, wherein divers of the Queens Friends and Adherents are declared Traytors, and their Estates Confiscate. Him∣self Marcheth into divers Places of the King∣dom, spoils and lays wast, and demollisheth the Houses and Castles of such as continued in their Loyalty. Queen Elizabeth hearing of the Scotch Queens Refuge into England, Commanded her by a Condoling Letter to stay at the Lord Scroops House until she had further Order from her, and in the interim writeth to the Vice-Roy of the danger of the Example, in which all the Kings and Crowns of the World were con∣cern'd, and desiring some Commissioners might be sent to her to give her a full Account of all their Proceedings against their Queen.
The Vice-Roy having the French King his Enemy already, durst not run the hazard of Offending the Queen of England too, whereas now his Friend, in whose displeasure he might plainly read his own Destruction, he resolveth to gratifie the Queen of England, and to send Commissioners to shew her the best Prospect of the Story: but the Nobility ashamed of the thing, refuse to be sent upon so Unworthy and Dishonourable a Message, or to be Em∣ployed in a matter so detestable, he resolves himself to undertake it, which accordingly he did, Accompanied with one or two of the Rebellious Nobility, and George Buchanan a de∣voted Slave to the Vice-Roy, whose heart did as much thirst after the Blood of the Queen, as ever his Venomous Pen had Surfeited it self in the pollution of her Sacred Name, which so wounded his gangered Conscience, when it was too late, That he Craved of God no longer time to Live, than he might be able to Cure those Sores, and Salve those Wounds which himself had made in the Fame and Re∣putation of that Good and Vertuous Queen. The Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Sussex, and Sir Ralph Sadler, Commissioners for the Queen of England, give them a Meeting at York, whither likewise repaired some Agents for the Exiled Queen, who gave their Audience, Pro∣testing that they did not appear there before the English Commissioners as competent Judges to determine or give Sentence in the Affairs of
their Soveraign Lady; but rather as in the pre∣sence of Friends and Neighbours to convince them of the unparalle'ld Wrongs and Injuries done to the Person and Honour of their Queen, (through whose sides they had wounded all the Kings and Supream Magistrates in the World) and to Crave the Assistance of the English Queen, her nighest Kinswoman in the World, either to persuade her Rebellious Sub∣jects to receive her again as their Sovereign, and restore her to all the Rights and Privi∣ledges of her Crown; or that failing, to grant her so considerable Forces as might be able to reduce them to Order and Obedience, which would be a Concession no less Honourable to the Queen of England, than Profitable to the Queen of Scotland. As a Counterpoize to this Protestation, the English Commissioners do also Protest, That they allowed not of that Protestation to the Prejudice of the Superiority that the Kings of England had always Claimed over the Kings of Scotland, which now belonged to the Queen their Mistress in the Right of the Crown of England. Then they proceeded to the Business; the Commissioners for the Exiled Queen first laid open all the Grievances and Wrongs that were thrown upon her, and under which she now laboured in a Languishing Exile. The Commissioners for the Young King (in whose Name the Commission ran) recrimi∣nate and highly Charge the Queen (no
ways Accountable to them) supposing or hoping the English Commissioners to have Power to pass Sentence against their Queen, in case they could by any means make them believe her Guilty of those things they Charge her withal. But being frustrate in these Hopes, and hearing every Article of the Charge distinctly and fully Answered by their Queens Commis∣sioners, the Vice-Roy contends, That nothing was done, which in the like Cases had not been done by their Predecessors, and their late proceedings being Confirmed by Act of Par∣liament, they were now past recall, and could not be Abrogated by any private person what∣soever, whereby he imagined that he had pre∣vented all Arguments that might be offered for a Peaceable Reception of the Queen to her Rights, which were now alienated by Act of Parliament. But the English Commissioners not satisfied with these things; they urge That the true Causes of such rigorous Proceedings with their Queen might be produced; the knowledge whereof was the end of their present Meeting. The Vice-Roy having nothing else to offer, de∣sired that first, the Queen of England would Engage for the Tuition of their Young King, Letters are sent to Acquaint the Queen with this motion: Her Majesty desires two Commissio∣ners of the Vice-Roy's Faction to be sent to her to London, to inform her more clearly in the whole matter. Two Commissioners are accor∣dingly
sent Metellane and Mackgill: but the Queen upon second Thoughts judgeth it necessary that the Regent himself be there, who repairs to London, where after much Debate before the Queen and the Council, at last the Commissioners are dismissed, and no more Determined at London than at York. The Vice-Roy returns home, and not long after the Lord Boyd brings Letters from both Queens to the Scots Parliament, wherein the Queen of England makes a Threefold Overture in behalf of Queen Mary: First, That she might be restored to her former Government, or this not Granted, That in the second place she might be admitted to Reign in Title only, in Conjunction with her Son, and the Exer∣cise of the Regal Power to rest still in the Vice-Roy until the Young King came to Seventeen Years of Age, and if they would not do that, in the third place, She might have free Liberty to return safely into her own Countrey (if it should seem good to her) and to Live a Retir'd and Private Life, having an Honourable Maintenance allowed her. The former Two were peremptorily De∣nied, and the Last had never been yielded to, but that they were well assured that the Queen would never Accept of it. The Queen of Scotland's Proposals were likewise Read, desiring them to Appoint
certain Judges to take her Marriage with Bothwell into Cognisance, That if it did appear Unlawful, that it might be accordingly ad∣judged and annulled. The Letter is Debated, but no Answer returned, only this Concluded, That the Queen of England be first Advertised, with a Suggestion, that this Motion tended only to make way for her Marriage to the Duke of Norfolk, wherein her Majesty of England was indeed much concerned. A Mes∣senger is dispatched with the Parliaments Re∣solves concerning both Letters: at his Arrival the Queen of England was Offended that they should send so mean and inconsiderable a Person to Treat with Her of so great and important Affairs as the Rights of Princes, he being one Wood a Domestick of the Re∣gents: He returning in a disgust another is sent, Pitcarne Abbot of Dunsterling, no sooner was he entred the English Court, but the Duke of Norfolk was sent to the Tower, and all the Intrigue of Marriage with the Queen of Scotland discovered, Pitcarne is respectfully Treated, and freely heard in behalf of the Regent, and at last is sent home with Thanks for many Offices done, and Assurance of all Favour and Assistance to the Vice-Roy. Which Success of their Message so puffed up the Faction and so animated Murray, that the Government became intolerable, and so uneasie to some, that Exasperated with Fear, Rage and Re∣venge, resolved upon the Ruin of the Regent whatever were the result of the Attempt:
and accordingly as the Vice-Roy road through Linlithquo, in his Expedition to the Borders with some few Troops of Horse, one James Hamilton discharges a Pistol upon him, and lodging a Bullet in his Bowels in some few Hours it put a period to his Life, Hamilton safely Escaping by a Postern Dore. The Vice-Roy thus surprised with Death, put all things into a new Confusion, the Queens Party begin to stir, but to little purpose, they being Awed and Checked, and the Adverse Party Encouraged and Strengthened by the Assistance of the Earl of Sussex, and Sir William Drury, Commanders in Chief for Queen Eliza∣beth, upon the Borders of England. So that the Queens Friends dare not put her Affairs to the Issue of a Battel; in the mean time the French and Spanish Embassadors press Queen Elizabeth to be more Kind and Favourable to her Cousin the Queen of Scotland, whom now she had made a Close Prisoner. The Imprisoned Queen no less incessantly and importunately prayeth for her Self by her Letters in Writing (wherein she had a most Excellent Faculty, as those Copies do make undeniably evi∣dent) the grand matter of her Request was for a fair hearing before her own Person. Queen Elizabeth sendeth to Scotland, giving the Adverse Faction Notice that she had pro∣mised a Conference for Composing, if possible, all Differences, upon condition that the Queens
Party should not stir nor endeavour a forceable restitution, withal wishing them not to choose a Vice-roy or Regent, until her pleasure was further made known unto them. They not daring to displease Queen Elizabeth, on whose favour and relief they depended, and finding the necessity of their Affairs to require a Man in Supream Power and Authority, by a knack of their own invention they choose an Inter-Roy, Matthew Earl of Lennox, the same in Power, though not in Name with Vice-Roy: Queen Elizabeth soon after adviseth them to con∣stitute him Vice-Roy accordingly as they had formerly done to Murray. Which being effected, the New Vice-Roy sendeth the Earl of Morton, Pitcarne, and Mack gill; to the Conference appointed by Queen Eliza∣beth, with the French, and Spanish Ambassadors. In this Conference Queen Elizabeth, had the parience (to the astonishment of all wise and ho∣nest men) to hear the rights of the Crown of Scotland (pretended by Morton to be Elective) and her nighest Kinswoman infinitely defamed and callumniated; that tender priviledge of all Prin∣ces, or Supream Magistrates, (viz.) the immu∣nity of their Sacred Persons from Capital Cen∣sures by Courts of their own Subjects, not only disputed but enveighed against and condemned: a Topick doubtless very ungrateful to her, as being equally concerned in it, had her English Subjects been then of the same Rebellions tem∣per
that the Scots were: at the conclusion of this Conference the Queen declared that she had received no satisfaction either in the general Ar∣gument, or in the particular Case of their Queen, and therefore desired that they would hearken to an accommodation of all differences between them and their Queen. This was peremptorily refused by them as not being impowred by their Commission, and the matter it self being a Subject proper for the General Council of the Kingdom, after much debate, and some overtures made by the Queen for a Reconciliation, the Commissioners retur∣ned home; nothing at all being effected for the distressed Queen, whom in truth Queen Eliza∣beth thought it not safe to enlarge. This nullity of proceedings left all things in confusion, the English Embassador Sir William Drury, labouring for a Cessation of Arms between both parties who had had many bikerings and skirmishes to the effusion of much blood, until at last the Regent is killed in a surprize at Sterlin, by a Par∣ty of the Lord Hamiltons, and in his stead the Earl of Marre is chosen Vice-roy, who by his single Valour defended the Castle of Sterlin, Repulsed the Enemy, and Rescued the Priso∣ners that Hamilton was carrying away, in which Rescue Morton was Killed by a Bullet that had pierced his Bowels, in the midst of this general Combustion, which filled all places with fears and dangers. Gods Providence preserved the Young King now lodged in the Castle at Ster∣lin,
the Scene of the present Warlike transa∣ction. About this time the Duke of Norfolk that had been quitted the Tower upon his Confession and Submission, and charging Leicester with unfaith∣fulness in the matter, relapsing into the same misdemeanors, was remanded to the Tower: Arraigned before his Peers, proved guilty of Treason, and Executed; who upon his death bewailed his breach of promise to the Queen, that had before graciously Pardoned him, and contrary to his word, had again without the privity or leave of his Soveraign dealt with Queen Mary about Marriage, and such weighty fairs, but disowned all kindness for the Romish Religion, and declared himself to die a Son of the Church of England. The death of the Duke (when the distressed Queen in all her Letters to Queen Elizabeth, had endeavoured to excuse) was no small aggrava∣tion of her sorrow, and for his sake or his Af∣fection to her she fears the worse, and is now more closely imprisoned than before: and by her confinement her Health is daily more impaired, of which she sends many sad accounts to the Queen; but to no purpose. But to consummate her misery, after all this one Ballard an English Priest with divers Gentle∣men, Conspire the death of Queen Elizabeth, and the enlargement of Queen Mary, Babington
a Gentleman of exceeding good Parts, writes to Queen Mary a full account of the design they had, the Letter came safe to the hands of her two Secretaries Man and Curle; who knowing the averseness of their Lady the Queen to such wicked and detestable designs dare do no other∣wise than conceal the Letter from her, and them∣selves return an Answer to it, wherein they give all the life and encouragement to the pro∣ject imaginable and to this they counterfeit the Queens Majesties Name. Babington presuming it was the Queens Hand, sheweth the Letter to divers whom he supposed he might trust, and at last he commits that and all other their Papers to the trust of one Gifford, who immediately carried them all to Walsingham, Queen Elizabeths Secretary, who upon the perusal of them dis∣covers the whole Plot; the Letter supposed to be Queen Maries own, he Communicates it to Queen Elizabeth and her Council, who imme∣diately issue out Warrants for the apprehend∣ing of the Conspirators, amongst the first of these was Babington taken, and being examined touching his intercourse with Queen Mary, con∣fessed that he had treated on that unhappy sub∣ject with her, which falsehood he supposed in∣deed to be truth, being imposed upon by the Forgery of her Secretaries. After Examinati∣tion and Conviction, they are all Condemned, and Executed as Traytors. Upon this discovery Queen Mary is still more closely imprisoned in Fotheringham Castle, and
the Guards set upon her are doubled, her Se∣cretaries taken from her and imprisoned, and Queen Elizabeth herself by Letter gave her no∣tice, that she had given Commission to her Council of State to hear her in Judgment upon the Fact, with which she was accused; the same day Thomas Bromeley, Knight, Lord Chancellor, and William Lord Burleigh, Lord Treasurer of England, came to her and declared what Power they had given them in their Commission, and desired her that she would calmly hear her Accusation, and what were the Facts where∣with she was Charged, otherwise they both could and would proceed against her for Con∣tempt: to which she made Answer, That she was no Subject, and that she would choose rather to Dye a thousand times than by such an Acknowledgment bring a Prejudice upon her Royal Majesty. The Commissioners do still insist upon the Tenor of their Commission; She demanded by what Law Civil or Canon, they would proceed against her? they said, By the Law of England. Which you have made (said she) on purpose to Trap and Ensnare me, to which I am not subject, nor bound to submit. Hatton the Queens Vice-Chamberlain pressed her still to Plead for her self, and to remove the supposed Guilt, assuring her no∣thing could be matter of greater Joy to Queen Elizabeth, than that she should Clear her Self of that Horrid Conspiracy, whereof she stood Accused. Queen Mary proposes an Appeal to a Parliament, promising to Answer there to
the whole Charge, knowing (as she said) that their Commission was only designed as a Net to Catch her in, and Entrap her Innocence. Then said the Treasurer we will proceed to the Contempt, if you do (replyed the Queen) Examine your own Consciences, and provide for your Honours, so God render to you and your Children, as you shall proceed against me in this Judgement. The next Morning she sent for one of the Commissioners to know if her Protestation against their Power or Authority to Try her (she being no Subject but a Free and Absolute Prince) were Recorded, if it were she could then Justifie her self without any Prejudice to Royal Dignity, or the Crown of Scotland, in particular; hereupon the Commissioners all do Assemble (but Shrewsbury and Warwick, who were Sick) in the Chamber of Presence, where was the Seat-Royal under a Cloth of State to represent the Majesty of Queen E. za∣beth, and upon the one side of it a Chair of Crimson Velvet for Queen Mary: after a Speech made by Bromley the Lord Chancellor, her Charge is Read, wherein she is Accused of Conspiring the Death of Queen Elizabeth, the Destruction of the Realm, and the Subversion of the Establish'd Religion. This done the Queens Lawyers do most furiously Charge her with all imaginable Aggravations of the Crime: but of all that they produced against her to Convince her of the Crimes charged
upon her, nothing stuck upon her or pinched her save the Letter to Babington, whereunto her hand was set; Babington upon his Examination acknowledged his Correspondence with her, and that he had received that Letter from her. Man and Curle her Secretaries did Depose, That she dictated it unto them, and with her own Hand had Subscribed it. To what Babington had Deposed she Protested in the Presence of the great God, that she never received any Letter from, nor writ any Letter to the said Babington, neither ever was she made privy to, or knew of any written to or from him. As to the Deposition of the Secretaries, if any such Deposition be made by them, it is said she, in the Presence of God, a most Traiterous and Wicked Calumny in them, who being my Secreraries are therefore of all men the most perfidious in the World: I de∣sire my Secretaries who are now Witnesses against me, may be brought into my Presence where I am Confident, that they dare not Ad∣here to any such Deposition pretended to be made by them. Her Secretaries (who in the Judgment of most unbiass'd men were corrupted with Money) were never produced nor brought into her Presence, Emanuensi∣um qui pre∣tio Corrupti videbantur, testimonio, oppressa est. Camb. p. 493. yet under the weight of their Testimonies was this Illustrious Princess crush'd a pieces: upon their Testimonies did the Com∣missioners proceed to give Sentence against her, and accordingly after long Debates and Con∣sultations, Sentence was pronounced; which
was immediately carried to Queen Elizabeth, and presented to the Parliament then sitting at Westminster, for publication of it, where the Sentence of Death was Confirmed, and Beal after some demurr upon it, was sent by Queen Elizabeth to Acquaint the Condemned Queen with the Mournful Sentence of her Death, and to tell her, That the Estates of the Realm met in Parliament had Approved and Confirmed it, and demanded speedy Execution of the Sentence for Justice, Security and Necessity; which sad News she received with more than a Masculine Courage or Greatness of Mind, Praising God for all his Dispensations towards her, and Acknowledging his Favours, she de∣sired a Priest to Administer the Sacrament unto her, and in all things to Assist her for a due Preparation, and Christian Dispose to Dye. The Cloth of State in her Chamber is beaten down by her Guard, and all Marks of Royalty are taken from her: but the Execution of the Sentence is for a time delayed by Queen Eliza∣beth. In the mean time the Condemned Queen writes to Queen Elizabeth, Requesting Three Things of her, First, That she being Dead, her Body might be Transported into France to be Buried there nigh the Ashes of her dear Mother. Secondly, That she might not suffer clancularly, but in the presence of her Servants. And Lastly, That they might all peaceably Enjoy those small Legacies, which her Poor and Exiled Condition was capable of Bequeathing them.
Neither was King James all this time remiss in his Endeavours to procure his Mothers De∣liverance, both by Persuasions and Commu∣nications if any way it might be Effected, to whom the French King joyned Endeavours, urging it with Reasons of greatest Mo∣ment. That it was a Business so detestable, that it was without Example to put an Anointed Sovereign into the hands of the Common Hangman; that it was an Example of Dangerous Consequence, thus to Prostitute Sovereignty to the Wills of Rebels: That the Condemned Queen was not only her nearest Kinswoman, but her Guest, invited by her with Promise of Protection, and in Assurance of it had taken Shelter under her Scepter: neither would it have been denyed her by any Christian Prince. That the Crime com∣mitted was done by her Secretaries and not by her, and therefore Injustice not to be Charged upon her, but them. That if this Sentence were Executed, all Christian Kings would be∣lieve all their Honours and Rights wounded in that blow: and would accordingly resent it and Avenge it. That her only Son King James, could never in Honour or Duty set down quiet under such an Affront. And in fine, That Heaven it self must needs Arm against so Bloody a Design: and therefore they adjure her by all the Love she bears unto her self, by all the Respects she bears to her own People the Nation of England, that she forbear the Execution. And if she feared any Evil by
her Life, to preserve her under the Power of strong Guards, of which she could not want plenty in England, if she would not accept of their Security for her Peaceable behaviour. But as an over-pressing Argument to all these the Enemies of Queen Mary, that were continually present with Queen Elizabeth, beat it into her Ears, that the Lives of Elizabeth and Mary were things incompatible, and for the Safety of one, it was necessary to take away the other, which otherwise would be a per∣petual Sting to her, Sed mortua non mordet, the Grave was the securest Prison she could be com∣mitted unto. Queen Elizabeth at last Signs the Warrant for Execution, which being past the Broad-Seal, She next day sends Killigrew to Davison to forbid the Command of Execution, telling him she would go another way to work, but the Lords of the Council being Acquainted with it, they without the Consent of the Queen wrested it from Davison, and sent Beale their Clark with the Mandate, and Letters to the Earls of Shrewsbury, Kent, Derby, and Cumberland, to see the same performed, which was the only thing that Queen Elizabeth had to offer in her own Excuse to King James, Protesting that it was done without her Knowledge, and quite contrary to her Intent, having, as she said, told Davison her Secretary, her Resolution of taking New Measures, and that the Warrant was to have remained in his hand without Execution, unless a Foreign Invasion or Do∣mestick
broyls, which Queen Mary's Enemies always suggested were daily designed, should render it necessary. Davison for his Diso∣bedience, was Committed, and cast out of Favour. Ʋpon the News of Signing the Warrant for Execution, King James Commanded the Ministers to remember the Queen Mother in their Prayers, which they generally refused to do, tho' the Form prescribed them, was Pious and Christian, being after this manner: That it may please God to illuminate Her with the Light of his Truth, and to Save her from the apparent danger wherein she was cast. No sooner came the Order to the hands of the Noblemen,  than they repaired to Fother∣ingham Castle, the Prison where the Queen lay, and raising, her out of her Bed in the Morning, they read their Commission to her, Advertising her That next day Morning she was to Dye, which Order she receiv'd without any discomposure of Mind or change of Countenance, saying, She did not think that her Sister Queen Elizabeth would have brought her to that Extremity: but seeing it was her pleasure she was willing to submit, Appealing to Heaven and Earth, to witness her Innocence, adding that it was her Comfort that she dyed for and in the Religion of her Fore-fathers, beseeching God to increase her Constancy and Courage to the Measure of her Afflictions. After these words she besought the Commissioners that she might be permitted to Confer with her Confessor, which was denied her, tendring unto her in his stead the Bishop or Dean of Peterborough, whom she refused,
saying, God shall be my Comforter. One of the Commissioners, the Earl of Kent, told her, your life will be the death, and your death the life of our Religion: I thank you, said she, that I am thought worthy to dye for my Religion. After that the Commissioners were rerired, she commanded her servants that Supper should be dispatched, and according to her usual custom she Supped soberly, and discoursed to such as were about her with a marvellous calmness and tranquillity of mind; at the end of Supper she drank to all her servants with a grave and modest chearfulness, at which they all fell upon their knees, mingling floods of Tears with their Wine, so soon as they were able to speak, having a little digested their sorrow, they craved her pardon for their remissness in those duties and services her Majesty had deserved at their hands, and she desired them likewise to forget all her defects and failings towards them, comforting them, with an invincible courage; and com∣manded them to wipe away their Tears, and to rejoyce with her for that she was now to be delivered from an abyss of misery. After Supper she wrote three Letters, one to the King of France, another to the Duke of Guise, and a third to her Confessor: this done she took a review of her Last Will, which she had before committed to writing, and caused an Inventory of her Goods to be Read; and wrote down the names of those to whom she had bestowed her Wardrobe; she also distribu∣ted mony to some with her own hand, after∣wards
she retired herself, and being refreshed with a little sleep, she spent the rest of the night in Watching and Prayer. The next morning being the eighth of Fe∣bruary,  she drest and adorned herself with such of Apparel and Ornaments as she usually wore on Festival days, and having again assembled her servants, she caused her Will again to be Read to them, desiring them to take in good part those poor Legacies she had bequeathed to them, the condition of her Estate not permit∣ting her to give them any greater: She took her last farewel of them to fear God, to love one another, and to be stedfast in the Faith, and to Pray for her Soul: she kissed the women, and permitted the men to kiss her hand: and then returned to her Oratory, where she con∣tinued to Prayer, until Thomas Andrews the Lieu∣tenant of the County signified unto her that her hour was come, and it was time to come forth, which she soon obeyed, and in a posture full of Majesty, and a Countenance very joyful, the Commissioners received her in a Gallery, where they did attend her, there likewise Melvin her Steward did present himself before her, and weeping fell on his knees to receive her last com∣mands: Melvin, said she, weep not, but rather re∣joyce, for this day you shall see Mary Stuart de∣livered from all her sorrows, and I adjure you to tell my Son, that I have always lived, and now I dye a Catholick, and that I exhort him to preserve the Faith of his Ancestors, to love
Justice, and to maintain his people in Peace, and to Enterprize nothing against the Queen of England. I have committed nothing against the Kingdom of Scotland, and I always loved France, God forgive them who have thirsted after my blood: then turning to the Lords she requested that her servants after her death might be civily used, suffered to attend her person in the time of her death, and then to enjoy peaceably those poor Legacies she had bequeathed them: the Earl of Kent opposed her servants Attendance, yet the passionate desires of the poor Queen, prevailed with the rest of the Lords to permit six of them to wait on her to the Scaffold, with this train came she into the Hall hung with black, and ascended the Scaffold covered with black also: and sat her down in a Chair prepared for her. Beal read the Warrant for Execution, which she heard very Patiently, the Dean of Peter∣borough endeavoured to persuade her, at last to relinquish the Roman, and embrace the Reformed Religion, for the Eternal good of her Soul: She besought him to forbear, being Resolved to Dye in the Faith of the Roman Church. Then turning to the People she Protested before God that she had not Attempted any thing against the Life of Queen Elizabeth, nor any other thing deserving Death: after some sew words more touching Religion, her Eyes gushed full of Tears, which were sympatheti∣cally
Answer'd with Tears by all that beheld the Tragedy, Three or Four only in all that Concourse that could be Excepted. The Executioner desired her Pardon; I Par∣don thee (said she) and all my Persecutors, after she had kneeled down, and Prayed with extream fervency, concluding her Devotions in these words: As thy Arms Lord Jesus were stretched out upon the Gross, so receive me O Jesus into the stretched forth Arms of thy Mercy. And after this she disposed her self for the Block, her Maids having undressed her, she laid open the most Beautiful Neck that ever received so merciless a Blow; then she signed her At∣tendants with the Sign of the Cross, and having kissed them all, she smilingly bids them farewell, at which they poor Souls weep most bitterly, with Sighs and Tears inexpres∣sible, for which she meekly reproved them, saying, Nay what do you mean, do you suffer your selves to be Transported with Grief, not∣withstanding you know I am going to Exchange a Temporal Kingdom full of Misery, for an Everlasting Empire filled with all Felicity. After this she covered her Face, and laid her Neck on the Block, saying in te Domine speravi, and having repeated once and again, in manus tuas Domine. The Executioner gave a Blow, and with it made a dreadful wound in the hinder part of her head, and at two more the Inhuman Butcher severed her head from her Shoulders, saying, Long Live Queen Eliza∣beth,
and so let the Enemies of the Gospel perish. Her poor Heart-broken Servants drew nigh to do their last Office for her, in divesting her Body, and disposing of it for Burial. But the Earl of Kent commanded them to be gone, and ordered her Body to be conveyed to a Chamber in the Castle, where it was locked up. After Nineteen Years Imprisonment, thus Unfortunately Dyed the most Beautiful, the most Magnanimous, the most Wise, and most Religious Queen Mary. Her Body was first Buried in the Cathedral Church in Peterborough, and after many Years in the Reign of her Son taken up and buried amongst her An∣cestors in Westminster, and by an unknown Author had this Inscription set upon her Tomb in Peterborough. MARIA Scotorum Regina, regis Filia, regis Gallorum vidua, reginae Angliae agnata & heres proxima, ver∣tutibus regiis, & animo regio ornata, Jure regio frustra saepius Implorato, barbara & tyrannica crudelitate, or∣namentum nostri seculi & lumen vere regium extinguitur; eodemque nefario Judicio, & Maria Scotorum Regina,
morte naturali, & omnes superstites reges plebeii facti morte mulctantur hic extat. Cum Sacris enim vive Mariae cineribus, omnium Regum at{que} principium violatam atque prostratam Majestatem hic jacere scito, & quia tacitum regale satis super que reges sui officii monet, plura non addo vi∣ater. Translated thus: Mary Queen of Scotland, the Daughter of a King, the Widow of the King of France, the near Kinswoman and next Heir to the Queen of England, endued with Princely Vertues, and a Royal Mind; having often, but in vain, implor'd her Regal Right, at length the great Ornament of our Age and the most Sovereign Light of the World is Extinguish'd by a most Barbarous and Tyrannical Cruelty, and by the
same pernicious Sentence, Mary the Queen of Scotland is punish'd with a Natural Death, and all surviving Mo∣narchs made common Persons, and render'd lyable to the punishment of a Civil Death, a very strange and un∣accountable kind of Grave, in which the Living lye Interr'd with the Dead, for with the Ashes of this Blessed Mary, know thou that the Majesty of all Crowned Heads lies here depressed and basely violated, But because the Reasons of State do admonish all Kings what is best to do, O Traveller I say no more. FINIS.
