THE RUDIMENTS OF GRAMMAR. The Rules Composed in English Verse, FOR The greater Benefit and de∣light of young Beginners. By James Shirley. Ʋtile dulci. LONDON, Printed by J. Macock for R. Lownds, and are to be sold at his shop at the white Lyon Paul's Church-yard, 1656.
Letters in Latine. Capital. A B C D E F G H J Consonant. J I Vowel. I L M N O P Q R S T V Consonant V U Vowel. U X Y Z. These are used at the beginning of every Proper name, the beginning of Sentences and Verses. Small Letters. a b c d e f g h j i l m n o p q r s t v u x y z. [c] before [e, or i,] soundeth like an [s,] as cedo, cito; Before other Vowels like the English [k] as cado, colo, cuprum. H. is by some held rather a note of Aspiration, then a Letter. L. is never double at the latter end of a Latine word, Pugil. After q. is alwaies written u. as qui, quoniam. Vowels. a. e. i. o. u. and y. which is only used in Greek Words, as Inlytus. All other Letters are Consonants.
Consonants. J and V before other vowels, when they lose their sound are reputed consonants, as in Justus. Volo. Where j sounds like a melting g, and v like a dry f. X and Z are double consonants, and J between two vowels, as major. L M N R are liquids, all the rest are mutes. Dipthongs five. a. as Musae. ae and oe are pronounced like e. au. as Aurum. ae and oe are pronounced like e. ei as Hei. ae and oe are pronounced like e. eu as Euge. ae and oe are pronounced like e. oe as Coelum. ae and oe are pronounced like e. Of Letters are made sillables. si-[ti] when a vowel immediately followeth, is pro∣nounced like [si] except in 1 Tiara. 2 Infinitives Paragogical. Mittier, borrowed words, as 3 Politia. And when s goeth before it, as 4 justior, robustior. ti-o. Of sillables are made words. Of Words are made parts of speech. Accents three. Acute ´ Grave ` Circumflex ^ These are not in use among the Latines, but for distinction and difference of words which are written alike. Multò much, from the Adjective multo. To note a long, sound before inclytical conjunctions, as itáne, adésdum.
Or to shew a sillable long by nature or contraction of vowels, as amaverunt, quîs for qucis. Points. A note of Diaeresis ¨ as aër A note of a vowel cut off called apostrophus, ' Audistn' Parenthesis is when a word or more (not of essence to the speech) are shut up in two semi-circles, () A note of Interrogation ? Of Exclamation, Admiration, or Sorrow ! A note of long quantity - A note of short quantity ˘ Comma, or note of pausing , Semicolon, of longer pause ; Colon : Period, or full point .
The Argument. EIght Parts, two Numbers, Cases six, to these Three Genders, five Declensions, three Degrees. Pronouns nineteen, four kind of Verbs, and they Three Persons through both Numbers do convey: Four Conjugations perfect Verbs receive, On which four Moods attend, and Tenses five. From race of Verbs four Participles flow. Three Gerunds we admit, and Supines two. These things well laid, three Concoras raise at last A structure, and the toyl of Grammar's past.
Rudiments. Grammar is the Art of speaking rightly. The Parts are, Etymologie, and Syntax. ETymologie is that part of Grammar which teach∣eth the Proprieties of several words, especially in the difference of Terminations; and considereth all parts of speech. Eight Parts of Speech. EIght only Parts the wise Grammarians teach, Because in them we comprehend all Speech. Noun, decli∣ned, Pronoun, decli∣ned, Verb, decli∣ned, Participle, decli∣ned, Adverb, undecli∣ned. Conjunction, undecli∣ned. Preposition, undecli∣ned. Interjection, undecli∣ned. To all these Parts belong Species which is Form, and Figura Figure. Form is when a word is either Original, and called Primitive, as Scio to know; or come from another, and called Derivative, as Scientia knowledge, deriv'd from Scio. Figure is when a word is either sim∣ple, as just us just; or compounded, as injust us unjust, compounded of in and just us.
Two kinds of Nouns, Substantive, and Adjective. NOuns Substantives the names of things declare, But Adjectives what kind of things they are. The Substantives are known by [a] or [the] The Adjectives alone imperfect be. A Noun Substantive is the name of a thing that may be seen, felt, heard, or understood; it signifies without time, and is known by the signes, a, an, or the before it. Domus a House, Pomum an Apple, Judex the Judge. To every Adjective you may joyn man or thing, and it maketh no distinct sense without a Substantive. Antiqua Domus, an ancient House, Dulce Pomum, a sweet Apple. Nouns Proper are all proper Names, which are referred to one, as Thamesis the Thames. Common are appli∣ed to all of the same kind, as Fluvius a River. Numbers Two. ONe is the Number Singular, but all Above, we must the Plural Number call. Homo a man. Homines Men. Some nouns in the singular signifie many, as Po∣pulus a people, Grex a flock: These are called Collectives, yet these are the singular Number, as being consider'd, one people, one flock.
Cases Six. THe Nom'native before the Verb doth go, [Of] shews the Genitive, the Dative [to] The Accusative after the Verb is plac'd, The Fift calls, Prepositions rule the Last. The Nominative, the Genitive, the Dative, the Ac∣cusative, the Vocative, the Ablative. The Nominative and Vocative are alike in both Numbers, so the Dative and Ablative plural in every Declension. Genders three. MAle Female, Neuter, perfect Genders be, All others are compounded of these three, A Noun of the Male or Masculine Gender, as Hic Vir this man. A Noun of the Female or Feminine Gender, as Haes Mulier this Woman. A Noun of the Neuter Gender, as Hoc Saxum this Stone. Nouns that belong to both Sexes, are of the Mas∣culine and Feminine, as Parens a Father or Mo∣ther. The Masculine Gender is more worthy then the Fe∣minine, and the Feminine more worthy then the Neuter. ALL Nouns the Male or Female Gender have, As nature first to Things the Sexes gave. Frater a Brother. Equus a Horse. Soror a Sister. Equa a Mare. Gender is the difference of Sex by Nature, as they are Male or Female; But by Institution and Art, words may
be of the Male or Female gender, and yet have no relation to Sex: as Lapis a stone, m. Musa a Song, Fem. ALL Nouns in [um] declin'd with Neuter be, Ʋnless they signifie a He, or She. Londinum, The City London. Cuprum Copper ANd upon Nouns we do the Neuter place That are declin'd These are called Nouns Aptotes, or Invariable, be∣cause they change their Termination in no case. The Substantives of these are Neuters, the Adjectives are of all Genders. alike in every Case. Nihil Nothing. Genio a Knee. THe Proper Names of Rivers, every Wind, And Months, are with the Masculine declin'd. Thamesis the Thames. Januarius the Moneth January. Eurus the East-wind. TRees, Countries, Cities, Islands, as they were Of Woman-race, the Female Gender bear. Cerasus a Cherry tree. Mona the Isle of Man. Anglia England. Oxonia Oxford. VVOrds of one Syllable we entertain Except some few, under the Female train. Declensions five. HIs true Declension every Noun will give From Termination of his Genitive. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. In ae. in i. in is. in us. in ei. As Musa. Viri. Crinis. Manus. Rei.

Three Degrees of Comparison. THe Positive declares without excess, With the sign [more] Comparatives increase, By [most] the bold Superlatives are known, Beyond which, there is no comparison. Pos.

The Comparative and Superlative are formed of the first case of their Positive that endeth in i, by putting to it or and us; as from duri, the Genitive of durus, by ad∣ding or, and us; are made the Comparative durior, and durius; and by adding [si] and [simus] to duri, is made durissimus, the Superlative; and this is the regular for∣mation or Comparisons.
Irregular Comparisons. ADjectives in [er] form their Superlative of the Nominative by putting to it rimus, as Pulcher, Pulchrior, Pulcherrimus Pulchra Pulchrior, Pulcherrima, Pulchrum Pulchrius Pulcherrimum. Adjectives that end with a vowel before us, have no formation or change at all, but make their Comparative by magis more, and maximè most, as Pius, Godly. Magis Pius, more Godly, Maximè Pius, most Godly. ADjectives that are compounded of dico, facio, volo, loquor, change us in entior, and entissimus, as Maledicus, Maledicentior, Maledicentissimus. So Magnificus, Benevolus, Magniloquus, &c. ADjectives compounded with per, are compared like the sim∣ple Nouns, but before the Comparative, are put the Ad∣verbs multò, or longè, and before the Superlative, the particle quam.

VErbs that have Persons, we do Personall call, And such as want we call Impersonal. Persons three. 1. Ego I. Nos We. 2. Tu Thou. Vos Ye. 3. Ille He. Illi They. Sing. Plur. Ego amo I love, Nos amamus We love, Tu amas thou lovest, Vos amatis ye love, Ille amat He loveth. Illi amant they love. Ego is only the first person, which speaketh of himself.

The first person is more worthy then the second, and the second more worthy then the third.
Of Verbs Personal there be four kinds. Active, Neuter, Passive, Deponent. THe Active and the Neuter end in [o] And both alike do signifie to do, Amo I love. Curro I run. A Verb Active endeth in [o] and is known by any of these signs, do, did, have, had, shall or will, as amo I do love, and this may be changed into a Passive by ta∣king r, as amor, I am loved. A Verb Neuter also endeth in [o] and signifieth do∣ing, with the same signs of a Verb Active, but rarely doth admit of a passive English or Signe, and therefore cannot take [r] to be made a verb Passive personal, as Curro I run, dormio I sleep; some few, as vapulo I am beaten, veneo I am sold, exulo I am banished, signifie pas∣sively, and are called Neuter Passives. IN [or] both Passive and Deponent run, To do, Deponent; Passive, to be done. Amor I am loved. Loquor I do speak. A verb passive endeth in [or] and hath for his signs in, is, are, art, was, and other Englishes of the verb Sum, as moneor, I am advised; and is derived from his active Moneo.
A verb Deponent endeth in [or] but signifieth doing, like a verb Active, with the same signes, do, did, have, &c. Moods four. INdicatives without a signe declare. The moods Imperative commanding are. Amat he loveth. Ama love thou. The Indicative mood doth plainly declare or shew. The Imperative biddeth, commandeth, or exhorteth to do a thing; as Lege, read thou, legite, read ye, or with the signe let, as legito ille, let him read. This Impera∣tive mood wanteth the first persons, and therefore lega∣mus let us read, and the like, is not properly the Impera∣tive, but the Subjunctive mood, whose present tense is elegantly used for the Imperative in all persons. MAy might, would, should, make the Subjunctive known Somtimes an Adverb, or Conjunction. Si faciam, if I do, ut videam, that I may see, non ne∣garem, I would or should not deny, utinam fecisset, would he had done it. The signs of the Subjunctive mood are made often in Latine by Possum, Volo, Debeo, and then the latter verb will be the Infinitive mood, as possum facere, I can per∣form it.
INfinitives which [to] before them use, Number and Person in their Mood refuse. Amare to love. Amari to be loved. Discere to learn. Doceri to be taught. Gerunds three. Supines two. IN di, do, dum, the several Gerunds close, [um] the first Supine. [u] the latter shows. Amandi of loving. Amando in loving. Amandum to love. Amatum to love. Amatu to be loved. Tenses five. FIve Tenses which their Signes discover still, I do, I did, I have, had, shall, or will. These, are both the signes of Verbs, and signs of Tenses, which signifie time present, past, to come. Present tense Do Amo I do love. Preter Imperfect did amabam I did Preter Perfect have amavi I have Preter Pluperfect. had amaveram I had Future tense. shall or will. amabo I shall or will
Passive Signs. Present Tense am, is, are, art amor I am loved Imperf. was, were, wert, amabar I was Perfect have been amatus sum vel fui Pluperf. had been amatus cram vel fueram Future shall or will be. amabor I shall. But if these signes come not before verbs, then they are verbs of themselves. I do facio I did faciebam or feci, &c. I have habeo I had habui I will volo I would volebam, velim, vel∣lem. I will not nolo I would not nolebam, nolui, nolim, nollem. I can Possum. I could potui. I might possem. I ought Debeo. Debui Deberem. I am Sum. I was eram. I have been sui. I had been fueram, fuissem. I shall be cro, fuero, &c. Verbs Impersonal. IMpersonal Verbs by their signe [it] we find In the third Person singular declin'd. Placet it pleaseth. Ind. Placet, placebat, placuit, placuerat, placebit. Sub. Placeat, placeret, placuerit, placuisset, placuerit. Itur the Impersonal Passive. Ind. Itur, ibatur, itum est vel fuit, itum erat vel fuerat, ibitur.
Sub. Eatur, iretur, itum sit vel fuerit, itum esset vel fuisset, itum erit vel fuerit. Inf. Iri. The Participle joyned with the auxiliar verb [est] in the Impersonal Passives, is alwaies used Neuter. Verbs Neuter may be Impersonal Passives, and answer to all persons by understanding an Ablative with a Pre∣position a or ab. Itur ame, te, illo, id est, eo, is, it is gone by me, thee, him, that is, I go, thou goest, he goeth, &c. when a deed is signified to be done of many, the neuter Impersonal is elegant, as curritur, i.e. omnes concurrunt, they all run. Participles four. DEriv'd from Verbs declin'd like Nouns are all Those parts of Speech we Participles call. Participles are so called, of taking part of a Noun, and part of a Verb: they differ not from Adjectives in na∣ture, but that they signifie with time present, past, or to come, as amans loving, hath relation to the present time, &c. A Participle of the present Tense Hath [ing] in English, Latine ans or ens. Amans loving. Legens reading. Monens teaching. Audiens hearing.
Participles of the present tense are declined like Felix. If the word ending in [ing] have [a] or [the] before it, it is a Noun Substantive, as lectio a reading. BY d t n the perfect tense is known, In tus, sus, xus all the Latines run. Loved, Amatus, seen, Visus, knit. Nexus. TO do, the Future signifies in rus, And to be done, the future tense in dus. Amaturus to love. Amandus to be loved. All Participles that end in us; are declined like bonus, amatus, amaturus, amandus a. um. Conjugations four. THe first hath â long before re and ris, E long the second Conjugation is. 1. As Amare to love; Amaris vel amare, thou art loved. 2. Monêre to advise. Monêris vel monere, thou art advised. E short is of the third a perfect signe, But with i long, io the fourth decline.

Present, and Preterimperfect tense, Amâre to love. Preterperfect, and Preterpluperfect tense. Amavisse to have or had loved. Although the Infinitives in [rum] as amaturum, moniturum, and the like, were anciently used (when they answered without altering their termination) to every number and gender, as credo inimicos meos hoc dicturum, I believe that my enemies will say this; yet they are not now in use with the best Au∣thors, who supply this tense by the Participle in rus, alterable both in gender and number (of which infinitive Verbs are not capable) before esse or fore, as when we would say, I promise that I will satisfie, we say elegantly, promitto me satisfacturum, and so in the plural, nos, vos, aut illos satisfacturos esse pollicemur, we promise that we, ye, or they shal satisfie; Illae dixerunt se emptu∣ras, the Women said they would buy; and so in the neuter, by altering the gender to agree with the substantive. The like may be said for the future of the passive infinitive verb, by the parti∣ciple in dus. Gerunds. Amandi of loving, amando in loving, amandum to love.

Some general Rules for the Preterperfect Tense, and Supines of VERBS. AS in the first avi, and atum makes, Amo, amas, amavi, amatum. ES uï forms whose Supine itum takes. Moneo, Mones, Monui, Monitum. VErbs of the fourth their various endings shew. Lego, legis, legi, lectum. FRom the fourth io, ivi, itum flow. Audio, audis, audivi, auditum. Some words of the fourth end in eo, as veneo to be sold, and eo to go, queo to be able, with their compounds.
THe Compound Perfect tense and Supines are The same which in the simple Verbs they were. Voco, vocavi, vocatum, to call. Provoco, provocavi, provocatum, to provoke. The Compound Verb doth commonly follow the Pre∣ter perfect tense, and Supine of the simple Verb. Exception. IN Composition rarely Verbs dispense With gemination in the Perfect tense. Respondeo respondi responsum. Spondeo spospondi sponsum. If the simple Verb double the first syllable of the Preterperfect Tense, the compound doth not: There∣fore Respondeo makes Respondi, not Respospondi: The Compounds of Sto, Disco, Posco, retain gemi∣nation. The Preterperfect Tenses and Supines are not al∣waies certain; but the exceptions are at large in the Latine Grammar, to which the Scholar must be re∣ferred.
Adverbs. ADverbs are parts of speech which must be joyn'd In Construing, next to Verbs, to shew their mind. Some be of Time, as Nunc Now Tunc then Intere in the mean time Pridie the day before Postridie the day after Postea afterwards. Some be of Place, as Ubi Where Ubinam in what place Usquam any where Nusquam no where Eò thither Longè far Quò whither Ubivis where you will. Some be of Quantity. Parum a little Satis enough Abunde sufficiently Affatim pentifully Partim partly.
Conjunctions. COnjunctions may be call'd the chains of sense, And some do couple Cases, Moods, and Tense. Some be Copulatives. & and que and ac and atque and quoque also nec nor neque neither tum both tum also Enclytical. que, ne, ve.   Prepositions. ALL Praepositions have their natural place Before, and must be construed with their Case. These govern the Accusative. Ad to ante before adversus against adversum apud at Cis on this side citra without circum about circa circiter
extra without erga toward intra within infra beneath inter between juxta near in into, upon, for until, against. ob for, by reason of per by, or through ponè behind penes in the power of praeter beside propter for prope nigh post after supra above sub before, about super beyond, above secundum after, next to secus by trans over, beyond versus towards usque until, to ultra beyond. These govern an Ablative. A, ab, abs from, after, since absque without coram before in presence of cum with de, e, ex concerning, of, from in among, in. pro for, instead of, be∣fore prae above, by reason of sine without sub under, in, at. super of, upon, touch∣ing tenus up to, even to These govern Accusative and Ablative in the same English. Clam privately, without the knowledge of. Subter under.
Interjections. IMperfect voices Interjections are, Which sudden Passions of the mind declare. Apage hence, be gone at, at ha. ah ahime alas ah me au peace, hist. eheu hei alas. euge, eja well done. eho, heus hark. Ehem, hem here, hum evax, io. heida oh ohe proh. oh alas malum with a mis∣chief vah, hui, phi pish, fie vae alack, wo to.
Concords three. Conc. I. VErbs that are called Personal, must receive Number and Person from their Nominative. Princes rule. Prîncipes dominantur. It is fit that aelyar be mindful. Oportet ut mendax sit memor. N. B. When you have the English word [that] in a sentence, which may be turned into the English [which] it is made by the Relative qui, quae, quod, &c. otherwise it is a Conjunction, which in Latine is quod or ut. I rejoyce that you are well. Gaudeo quod tu bene vales. But this Conjunction may for elegance be put away, if you change the Nominative following into the Accu∣sative, and the Verb into the Infinitive mood, as Gaudeo te valuisse. A verb Impersonal hath no Nominative case before it. If in the English it seem to have a Nominative before it, that word that seemeth to be the Nominative, shall be such case as the verb Impersonal will govern, as me oportet, I must. Tibi licet, thou mayst.
Conc. II. THe Adjectives with Substantives agree, Whose number, case, and gender equal be. an ingenious Boy. a weak memory. a good * thing. Ingeniosus Puer. Fragilis memoria. Bona res. N. B. When thing is the Substantive to the Adje∣ctive, you may leave out Res the Latine Substantive, and put the Adjective alone in the Neuter gender, which in all respects supplies the place of a Substantive, as Bonum, a good thing. Conc. III. ALL Antecedents their own Number give Gender and Person to their Relative. Qui operatur, meretur stipendium. The man that worketh, deserveth a reward. Non sunt amici quos amas. They are not friends whom you love. N. B. The Relative (of what case soever) is alwaies construed in the place where you find him in a sentence, if it do immediately come before the Verb, it will be the Nominative to the Verb, by the first Concord; but if any word come between the Relative and the Verb in that sentence, then the Relative is governed of the Verb,
or Noun which followeth in construction. Ille and illi,  and ea, when they are Antecedents, are oftentimes, and not inelegantly understood. So ego, tu, ille, nos, vos, illi, when they come before a Verb. THe guiding part in every Concord's that Which answereth to the question Who or What: This sometimes proves to be no word of case, But made an Aptote doth supply the place. Whatsoever answers to the question Who or What, is the Nominative case to the Verb, the Substantive to the Adjective and Antecedent to the Relative, whether it be a single word, or more, and if it happen to be no casual word, yet because it supplies the place of a Noun, it is to be declined there, like a Noun invariable. To lie is not my duty. Mentiri non est meum. THe Antecedent or the Substantive, Are often shut up in the Possessive. Exaudi vocem mei clamantis ad te, Hear my Prayer calling to thee. Miror stultitiam vestri qui Ae thiopem lavatis: I wonder at your folly who wash an Ethiop. The Genitive case of a Pronoun Primitive included in the Possessive, is sometime the Substantive to an Adje∣ctive, and Antecedent to a Relative: As [my prayer] in the example above, is put for the prayer of me; and [your folly] for the folly of you.
NOuns Singular when they conjoined stand, May Plural Verbs or Adjectives command: But if their Persons, or their Numbers be Ʋnlike, these with the worthiest shall agree. A friend and Gold are to be tried in fire. Amicus & Aurum ignibus sunt probandi. I and my affair are well. Ego & res mea valemus. Two or more Substantives singular joined with a Con∣junction, may require a Verb, or Adjective plural. But if the Substantives be of divers Persons or Genders, then the Verb or Adjective shall be put in the more wor∣thy Person or Gender. N. B. If the Substantives of divers genders singular signifie things without life, then the Adjective or Rela∣tive is put in the Neuter Gender, as if it answer'd to Things. Water and Fire are inexorable. Aqua & Ignis sunt inexorabilia. VErbs may between two Nominatives, that be Of divers Numbers, with the last agree, Thus Adjectives or Relatives, when plac'd Between two different Genders chuse the last. Conscience is a thousand Witnesses. Conscientia mille sunt Testes. All Errour is not to be called folly. Non omnis Error stultitia est dicenda. Let no man take away the stone, which is called a Boun∣der. Nemo tollat saxum, qui limes pnitur.
A Verb between two Nominative cases of divers Numbers; so Adjectives or Relatives between two Sub∣stantives of divers Genders may agree with the last. THe Case and Tense which doth the question frame In every answer ought to be the same. Q. R. E. Quod est tibi nomen? Jacobus What is your name? Cujus nominis es? Jacobi Of what name are you?

Some necessary Rules of Syntax in English, for young Com∣posers. Substantives. [Of] before the latter Substantive, sign of a Genitive. WHen [of] between two Substantives doth come The latter doth the genitive assume. The Fables of old women. Anicularum Fabulae. When two Substantives come together signifying divers things, the latter shall be the Genitive case, with the signe [of] before it. [Of] in praise or dispraise genitive or ablative. BƲt when it speaks to credit or disgrace, We use it in the sixt or second case. A maid of an excellent shape. A man of a clean Nosthril. Virgo egregiâ formâ. Vir emunctae Naris.
This latter Substantive of praise or dispraise, hath al∣waies an adjective joyn'd, signifying the quality, and is put into the genitive case or ablative. Substantives together without a Signe. WHen many come together, and declare The same thing, all their Cases equal are. Oh man, a bubble, why art thou proud. Hmo, Bulla, quid superbis? When two or more Substantives come together, and sig∣nifie the same thing, they shall be put in the same case. Adjectives with the signe [of] govern a Genitive. OF] or [among] when they immediate are After Nouns Adjectives that do compare, Or numeral Nouns or Interrogative, They'r tokens of a following Genitive. The fairest of the Apes is deformed. Simiarum pulcherrima est deformis, pro Simia pulcherrima. Nouns Partitive, Interrogative, Comparative, Super∣lative, and Nouns of Number, govern a Genitive.
A Partitive is that which signifies a part of a multitude or many severally, as aliquis, alius, alter, uterque, neu∣ter, nullus, solus, quisque, quisquis, quidam, quilibet, quicunque, unusquisque, pauci, omnes, nemo. Their La∣tine is often varied by Prepositions, e, de, ex, inter, ante, as for Simia pulcherrima, is made Simiarum pulcherrima, ex Simiis pulcherrima inter Simias pulcherrima. Adjectives and Verbs of Plenty or Want, a Genitive or Ablative. IF want or plenty Nouns or Verbs conspire, They Genitive or Ablative require. A man full of chinks Homo rimarum plenus. A man void of counsel doth fall to ruine. Vir consilii expers mole ruit. Nouns Adjectives, and Verbs that signifie plenty or want will have a Genitive or an Ablative case. [Then] after Comparatives a sign of the Ablative. COmparatives with the sign [then] do give Ʋnto the following Noun an Ablative. Learning is better then riches. Doctrina praestantior divitiis, vel quàm divitiae.
Adjectives of the Comparaive degree, having the sign [then] after them may govern an ablative case, if [then] be not made by [quàm] in Latine: but if [quàm] be ex∣prest, then the word following is put in the same case that goes before. [To] and [For] after Verbs and Adje∣ctive, signes of a Dative. BOth after Verbs and Adjectives we place [To] and [For what] signes of a Dative case. He promiseth to me golden Mountains. Pollicetur mihi aureos Montes. All Verbs and Nouns Adjectives may govern a Dative, with the signs [to] or [for] and cuja after them. Vebs that have a Nominative after them. EXisto, Forem, Fio, Sum, receive Before and after them a Nominative. So Neuters, which we Verbs of gesture name, With Passive Verbs of calling do the same. A woman is the safety of a house. Mulier sa us est domûs. No man is born an Artist. Nemo nascitur Artifex. N. B. Not only these, but all other Verbs personal, may have before and after them a Nominative case belong∣ing to the same thing, Boni moriuntur laeti.
[VVhom] or [VVhat] signs of an Accu∣sative after Verbs. VErbs Transitive the fourth case rule of that Which answereth to the question [whom, or what. He holds an Eel by the tayl. Tenet anguillam caudâ. All manner of Verbs will have an Accusative case after them, which answereth to the question [whom or what.] Except. 1. Interest refert, which govern a genitive case of all words but meâ, tuâ, sua, nostra, vestra, & satago, misereor, miseresco, a genitive. Misereor and miseresco somtime a Dative. Potior, utor, fungoe, fruor, an Ablative. Except. 2. TO trust, to profit, aid, obey, and please, Have Datives, so the contrary to these. Trust not Beauty too much. Nimium ne crede colori. Verbs that signifie profit or disprofit, trust or despair, help or hinderance, obedience or disobedience, pleasing or dis∣pleasing, govern a Dative. Except. 3. DAtives will follow Verbs whose English, are To be angry, threaten, to command or spare.
A wise man shall command the stars. Sapiens dominabitur astris. Verbs that signifie anger, threatning, command, or par∣don, will have a Dative case. Except. 4. AND many Verbs when they compounded be With Prepositions, ob, in, ante, prae, Sub, inter, super, with ad, post, and con, Do rule a Dative of the following Noun. Vice creeps upon us under the name of Virtue. Vitia obrepunt nobis sub nomine Virtutum. Verbs compounded with these Prepositions, ob, in, ante, prae, sub, inter, super, ad, post, con, do commonly govern a Dative. Some Verbs in the same signification have a Dative and an Accusative, as allatro, antecedo, condono, illudo, occumbo, praeo, praesto, praestolor, &c Some Verbs have a Dative and Accusative with ad, con∣fero, conduco, accedo, incumbo, applico, confert sanitati, vel ad sanitatem. These are excepted which govern an Accusative plainly, Aspicio, admiror, alloquor, adjuro, adjuvo, adeo, invenio, invado, obeo, praeverto, subeo. Participles, Gerunds, &c. WOrds that do come from verbs, or nouns arrest Those cases, which their Primitives possest. Horses drawing the Mill. Equi Molam trahentes.
Participles, Gerunds, Supines, and somtimes Adverbs, do govern the case of those words from whence they are derived. Measure and Space, Accusative or Ablative. LEngth, bredth, height thickness, depth, and space of place, We measure in the fourth, or the sixt case The walls of Babylon two hundred foot high Muri Babilonis ducentos pedes alti. Do not go back a Nails bredth. Ne latum unguem recedas. Nouns that signifie the measure of any thing, or the space or distance of place, are used generally in the Accusative or Ablative case. Manner, Cause, Instrument, Ablative. THe manner, cause, and Instrument, we place Next the signs [by] or [with] in the sixt case. Pleasure by continuance breeds a distaste. Voluptas assiduicate fastidium parit. Every Noun that signifies the manner, cause, or instrument with the signs [by] or [with] are put alwaies in the Abla∣tive case. Price, Ablative. ALL words of Price are Ablative, but we Do use some Genitives Adverbially. What did it cost? Ten shillings. Quarti constitit? Decm solidis.
All words signifying the price of any thing, are put in the Ablative case, except these genitives, tanti, quanti, pluris, minoris, plurimi, flocci, nauci, nihili, pili, assis, terunti, which are used adverbially. An Ablative absolute. AN ablative put absolute, is that On which a Participle still doth wait; With the Sign [being] it depends on none, But is made plain by some Conjunction, The Tree being fallen, men gather sticks. Dejectâ arbore, ligna colligunt. An Ablative absolute hath commonly a Participle joyn∣ed to it, either expressed, or understood [existente] it dependeth upon nothing before, nor coming after it, and may be made plain by some of these Conjunctions, dum, cum, si, qaundo, post∣quam, ubi, as dejecta arbore, the Tree being thrown down, i.e. ubi quando, cum, postquam, arbor dejicitur. Time. Quando, when. Ablative. Quamdiu, how long. Accusative. THe term of Time, that doth to [When] reply, In the Ablative is used commonly. The word of Time, that to [how long] doth make An answer, the Accusative may take.
No man is not wise at all hours, though an hundred years old. Nemo omnibus horis sapit, licet centum annos natus. The time that answereth to the question [When] is put in the Ablative. The time that answers to the question [How long] is most commonly put in the Accusative case, and sometime in the Ablative, and both these times are often used with prepositions, in diem for a day. Place in, or at which, Genitive or Ablative. When in, or at a place is meant the name, If proper in the Genitive we frame: But if it Plural be, and we decline it, After the third to Ablative confine it. Born at London, Natus Londini. The Oracles cease at Delphos, Oracula cessant Delphis. The proper name of a place, that answers to the questi∣on Ubi where, is put in the Genitive case, but if it be of the third Declension, or wanteth the singular number, it is put into the Ablative case: Humi, militiae, belli, are used like proper names. Place to which, Accusative, In the fourth Case, we use the Places name, To which, we move, when we the Latine frame. They carry Owls to Athens, Noctuas Athenas portant. The proper name of a place that answers to Quò, whe∣ther, is put in the Accusative case without a preposition.
Place from, or by which, Ablative. If [From] or [By] precede the names of place, The proper names are put in the sixt Case. He return'd from Oxford, Rediit Oxoniâ. He went by Cambridge, Profectus Cantabrigia, vel per Cantabrigiam. Proper names of places, that answer to Unde from whence, or quâ which way, are put in the Ablative case without prepositions. N. B. The proper names of great places, as Anglia, In∣dia, and the like, and all common names of places, as City, &c. are used with prepositions, whether at, to, from, or by which. N.B. Rus and domus, though common names, are used in the cases of poper names, in their several declension. Use of the Participle in rus and dus. When am, is, are the Englishes of Sum, Before the Infinitive Mood, Active come, The Latine is made elegant by rus, But if before the Passive Mood in dus. I am to write, Scripturus Sum. Learned men are to be honoured, Eruditi sunt honorandi. When any of the Englishes of the Verb Sum, am, is, are, art, &c come before the Infinitive mood active, they may elegantly be made in Latine by the Participle in rus; but if they come before an Infinitive Passive in English, the Latine is made by the Participle in dus.
Use of the Gerunds di and dum. When the Infinitive English is exprest, After Nouns, [di] or [dum] make Latine best. When the English of the Infinitive mood (which some∣times is varied by the English of the Participle of the Pre∣sent tense) cometh after a Noun Substantive immaterial, such as, studium, causa, tempus, spes, locus, amor, gratia, modus, ratio, &c. it is made by the Gerund in di; as a love to write, or of writing, amor scribendi. And sometimes by the Gerund in dum, with the prepo∣sition ad, as a place to act in, locus ad agendum. The Rule of Construing. The Vocative must lead; if there be none, The Nominative begins Construction With his relations, then the Verb, and what Is govern'd, or dependeth upon that: The Accusative doth challenge the next place, And then in order, every other Case. The Relative doth break this rule, which will Be construed where you find him, and doth still Precede the word that governs him this right Claim Nouns of asking and Indefinite. The Vocative is the first Case to be construed with his interjection, and what depends upon it, or is govern'd of it. Then the Nominative and the Verb with which it agreeth. After the Verb commonly followeth the Accu∣sative Case, unless there be an infinitive mood, which must be construed next to the Verb.
After the Accusative, the other Cases in their order, as the Genitive, Dative or Ablative, if there shall be so many. This order is interrupted by the Relative, which must be construed where it is placed, whether it come before a Verb, or be governed of any word which is place after it. Interrogatives, and indefinites follow this priviledge of the Relatives. The Preposition must be alwaies Construed together with his Case. The Nominative Case is to be also construed with hi Verb, unlesse it govern a case, and so must the adjective with the substantive, if the adjective govern no other word. FINIS.
