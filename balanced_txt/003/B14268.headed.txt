SIGILVM REGIS MAGNAE BRITANIAE FRANCIAE HIBERNIAE PRO CONSILIO SVO VIRGINIAE I R THE NEW LIFE of Virginea: DECLARING THE FORMER SVCCESSE AND PRE∣sent estate of that plantation, being the second part of Noua Britannia. Published by the authoritie of his Maiesties Counsell of Virginea. LONDON, Imprinted by Felix Kyngston for William Welby, dwelling at the signe of the Swan in Pauls Churchyard. 1612.
TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL AND WORTHIE KNIGHT SIR THOMAS SMITH of London, Gouernour of the Moscouia and East Indie Companies, one of his Maiesties Counsell for Virginea, and Treasurer for the Colony: Peace and health in Christ. IT is come to passe (right VVorshipfull) with the businesse and plantation of Virginea, as it is com∣monly seene in the attempt and progresse of all other most excellent things, (which is) to be accompa∣nied with manifold difficulties, crosses and dis∣asters, being such as are appointed by the highest prouidence, as an exercise of patience and other vertues, and to make more wise thereby the ma∣nagers
thereof: by which occasion not only the ignorant and simple minded are much discou∣raged, but the malitious and looser sort (being accompanied with the licentious vaine of stage Poets) haue whet their tongues with scornfull taunts against the action it selfe, in so much as there is no common speech nor publike name of any thing this day, (except it be the name of God) which is more vildly depraued, traduced and derided by such vnhallowed lips, then the name of Virginea. For which cause (right noble Knight) J haue set my self to publish this briefe apollogie to the sight and view of all men, not to answer any such in their particular folly, but to free the name it selfe from the iniu∣rious scoffer, and this commendable enterprise from the scorne and derision of any such, as by ignorance or malice haue sought the way to wrong it. VVhich albeit J am well assured will no way auaile to admonish or amend the incor∣rigible loosenes of such vntamed tongues, yet shall I hold mine endeuours well acquited, if J may but free your selfe, and so many right no∣ble, and well affected gentlemen (touching the
former ill successe) from wrongfull imputation, as also satisfie the despairing thoughts, and quicken the zeale of such friends and louers to this businesse, as in their remote and forraine residence, by the spreading of rumours and false reports, doe rest vnsatisfied. VVherein (as J hope) not to exceed the bounds of modestie and truth, so for orders sake J haue set it downe in a briefe method of three parts. The first is no∣thing else but a briefe relating of things alrea∣die done and past: The second, of the present estate of the businesse: And the third doth tend as a premonition to the planters and aduentu∣rers for the time to come. And this J offer to the patronage of your VVorship alone, being the chiefest patron of this and of many moe worthie seruices: where∣in J presume not any way to counsell or direct your wisedome in your further proceedings, whom long experience in Common-wealth af∣faires (besides that abilitie and wisedome of minde infused by God) hath made most able and sufficient of your selfe to direct many o∣thers, but as wishing heereby (if J might in
some measure) to ease the burthen of your mind, vnder the wise and painfull managing of your many publike actions: for which J pray that God will please, to continue still your health and strength of body, with answerable successe, to your honest, wise, and most approued desires. R. I.
THE NEW LIFE OF VIRGINEA. IN that most sacred hi∣storie penned by the Prophet Moses, (the first historian that euer wrote, and left his wri∣tings to posteritie) it is recorded, that when the pride of earthlie men, in the race and progenie of Noah, began to aspire and sought to clime the Celestiall throne; it so highly prouoked the Maiestie of God, that consulting with the Deitie, and comming downe by his word and almightie power, he subuerted their deuices and proud attempt, infatua∣ting their vnderstanding by confounding their tongues, and leauing each one to his seuerall waies, to follow the pronesse and follie of his owne heart, so that from this
scattering and casting them out like vn∣profitable seed vpon the dust of the earth, did spring vp (as weeds in solitarie places) such a barbarous and vnfruitfull race of mankinde, that euen to this day (as is very probable) many huge and spatious Coun∣tries and corners of the world vnknowne, doe still swarme and abound with the in∣numerable languages of this dispersed crue, with their inhumane behauiour and brutish conditions, and howsoeuer God laying this heauie curse and punishment vpon them, that for the space of three thousand yeares and more, did neuer vouchsafe the hand of the weeder, to clense and giue redresse to so desolate and outgrowne wildernesse of humaine na∣ture, yet such is his eternall purpose, who in his owne appointed time, doth reskue the brand from burning, and the prey from the Lions teeth, that like as we our selues and our forefathers (the first fruites of the Gentiles, who were all guilty of that great conspiracie) which were strangers frō the Common wealth of Israel, and liued long
time without God in the world, were yet at length reduced home to that familie of saints and sonnes of God, so now appea∣reth the same grace, which God out of his secret counsell begins to extend and giue to the remnants of those scattered Gen∣tiles, our kinsmen and younger brethren (as I may say) the sundrie nations of Ame∣rica: which as they consist of infinite con∣fused tongues and people, that sacrifice their children to serue the diuel, Leuit. 20.2. as those heathens did their sonnes and daughters to Molech: yet who can doubt or say, but euen amongst these, God may haue his speciall numbers, from whose neckes hee will now remoue that heauie yoake of bondage; and to that end it is to be obser∣ued, when after that great apostacie fore∣told by the spirit of God, and which for many hundred yeares had almost drow∣ned the christian world in superstition and Idolatrie; God that raised vp her Maie∣stie, our late Soueraigne, and put into her heart, by wholesome lawes to wipe away that mist of popish dimnes from our eyes,
whereby we saw the light more cleare, did likewise moue her Princely mind to prof∣fer that light to this blinde and miserable people, in giuing the first incouragement by our English Colonies to make planta∣tion there, and according to her selfe, and the condition of her sexe, she named the Countrey Ʋirginea: which mee thinkes should enforce from them that loue the monuments of her neuer dying memo∣rie, a feruent bond of zeale to that name and worke of God, the ground whereof was laid by her, the happinesse of whose raigne was our vnspeakable ioy, and will be deriued to our posteritie. And howsoeuer God pleased not to suffer the performance of that excellent worke in her daies (as hee likewise denied King Dauid, whose purpose and prepara∣tion was to haue built a Temple for the Lord) yet hee raised vp (like Salomon) the best and wisest among the sonnes of men to be our King, and hath bent his royall disposition, by many gratious priuileges, and giuing his customes freely, to build
this Temple for the Lord, yea many liuing temples for the honour of his name. What shall wee then say, when thus the powers of heauen and earth encouraged the enterprize, and stirred vp the spirits of worthie men, not the basest, but of the best and most honorable minded in the king∣dome, to engage themselues to solicite their friends to assemble and consult ad∣uisedly how to replant this vnnatural vine to make it fruitfull, when they looked to heauen they saw a promise, and looking to earthward they saw a blessing. And al∣beit in that infancie their numbers were but small, yet their willing resolution sup∣plying that want, they made out 3. shippes with Captaine Newport, for a discouerie, who within few monethes returned with relation of a countrie discouered and sea∣ted like that pleasant land described by Moses, the stones whereof were brasse and iron, whose mountaines, vallies & streams did all attend some good employment, that they saw a poore people liuing there in the shadow of death, without light or
sense of their own miserie, and that there wanted nothing but industrie and art to adde to nature. Vpon which encouragement new sup∣plies were made; with expedition some few hundreds of our men were left there by Captaine Newport, with al kind of pro∣uisions and directions for the ground and foundation of a Common-wealth. Their barbarous king Powhatan entertai∣ned them louingly, and admitted them a large countrie to inhabit, the poore Sa∣uages brought them such reliefe as they had; our owne people wrote letters home in praise of the countrie, and labored their friends to come thither, they began to fortifie where they saw conuenient, they built a Church and many houses toge∣ther, which they named James Towne, they nourished their swine, hens, and other pro∣uisions they caried out of England, which plentifully encreased: they cut downe wood for wanscot, blacke walnut tree, Spruce, Cedar & Deale, they got rich furs, dying stuffe, minerals and iron ore (which
made excellent good iron) they planted orange trees, corne, and sundrie kindes of seeds, they made Sope ashes and Tar, with some Sturgeon and Caueare, and of each of these they sent vs small quantities, with store of Sassafrasse, and some wine of those countrie grapes for a triall: all which be∣ing the worke but of a small number, not fully settled, gaue sufficient testimony what might bee effected there by settling good gouernmēt, and sending more sup∣plies of men, and meanes to plant the soile and make discoueries. This happy proceeding caused the acti∣on to be accounted as wonne, and caused so many willing minds to aduenture their monies, that there wanted not sufficient meanes, to furnish out a fleet of 9. good ships, with the better part of fiue hundred men to inhabit there. Sir Thomas Gates being Lieutenant generall, and Sir George Sommers Admirall of Ʋirginea, both of them appointed by commission to reside in the countrie to gouerne the Colonie, which together set saile and departed the
coast of England with a faire wind the first of Iune 1609. But who can withstand the counsell of God that sits in the stearne of all acti∣ons, and so directed this present fleet, that before they came neere the coast of Ʋir∣ginea, the ship named the Sea Venture, be∣ing also Admiral of the fleet, wherin were shipped the two Knights before named, and Captaine Newport with an hundred and fiftie persons, was violently taken and carried with the rage of tempestuous stormes, without hope or likelihood of life at least an hundred leagues to the sowthward, till they arriued vpon the desperate shore of the Ilands of Bermudus, where betweene two rockes the ship split in peeces, and yet by the miraculous hand of God and industrie of the Captaines, all the people escaped safe to land and not a man perished, Of whose long abode and preseruation in these broken deserts, & of their strange and wonderfull deliuerie thence, it is al∣ready related and published by Sir Thomas
Gates, and so I returne to the other eight ships which escaping the danger of seas a∣riued at the port, and landed their men in Ʋirginea. By which meanes the body of the plan∣tation, was now augmented with such numbers of irregular persons, that it soone became as so many members without a head, who as they were bad and euill affe∣cted for the most part before they went hence; so now being landed, and wanting restraint, they displaied their condition in al kind of loosenes, those chiefe and wisest guides among them (whereof there were not many) did nothing but bitterly con∣tend who should be first to command the rest, the common sort, as is euer seene in such cases, grew factious and disordered out of measure, in so much as the poore Colonie seemed (like the Colledge of English fugitiues in Rome) as a hostile Campe within it selfe: Parsons letter in the Quod∣libets. in which distemper that enuious man stept in, sowing plenti∣full tares in the hearts of all, which grew to such speedie confusion, that in few mo∣neths,
Ambition, sloth and idlenes had de∣uoured the fruits of former labours, plan∣ting and sowing were cleane giuen ouer, the houses decaied, the Church fell to ru∣ine, the store was spent, the cattell consu∣med, our people starued, and the poore Indians by wrongs & iniuries were made our enemies, two of the ships returning home perished vpon the point of Ʋshant, the rest of the fleet came ship after ship, la∣den with nothing but bad reports and let∣ters of discouragement: and which added the more to our crosse, they brought vs newes that the Admirall ship, with the two Knights and Captaine Newport were mis∣sing, seuered in a mightie storme outward, and could not be heard of, which we ther∣fore yeelded as lost for many moneths to∣gether, and so that Virgine voyage (as I may tearme it) which went out smiling on her louers with pleasant lookes, after her wearie trauailes, did thus returne with a rent and disfigured face: for which how iustly her friends tooke occasion of sor∣row, and others to insult and scoffe, let
men of reason iudge. And as for those wicked Impes that put themselues a ship∣boord, not knowing otherwise how to liue in England; or those vngratious sons that dailie vexed their fathers hearts at home, and were therefore thrust vpon the voyage, which either writing thence, or being returned back, to couer their owne leaudnes doe fill mens eares with false re∣ports of their miserable and perilous life in Ʋirginea, let the imputation of miserie be to their idlenes, and the blood that was spilt vpon their owne heads that caused it. And howsoeuer it is true, that vpon these euents many aduenturers which had formerly well affected the businesse, when they saw such vnexpected tragedies, with∣drew themselues and their monies from aduenture. Notwithstanding it lessened much the preparation, yet it hindred not the resolution of that honourable Lord (appointed Lord Gouernour) to goe in his owne person, The Lord la Warre. who together with the rest of the aduenturers assisting his setting
forth, hauing in their wisedomes rightlie weighed, that to the desired end of all good actions in this life, the way doth lie as well, with rough and craggie steps as smooth and easie paths, did presently set on with three good ships, wherin the Lord Gouernour, attended with Sir Ferdinando VVainman & sundry others, set saile from the coast of England, in the beginning of Aprill 1610, and on the 9. of Iune arriued safely at the disfortified fort in Ʋirginea, where his Lordship finding their despe∣rate condition so poore and meane, and so cleere a consumption of all former em∣ploiments, that scarsely appeared the steps or print of twenty hundred groats disbur∣sed, which had truly cost the Aduenturers here aboue twentie thousand pounds. And thus wee stood in state of Mar∣chants that had aduentured much and lost all: in which case we might now make an∣swere with King Alexander (hauing giuen away al to his Captaines) we had nothing left but hope, and this hope of ours wee fixed much (if not too much) vpon that ho∣nourable
Lord Gouernour, then landed in Ʋirginea, who as the world & our selues knew right well to be religious and wise, of a strong bodie and valerous minde, and vnder his wings so confidently repo∣sed the shield of our businesse, that God minding to make vs know that our arme was yet but flesh, euen in the front of his enterprize ouerthrew the Nobleman by laying such a heauie hand of sicknesse and diseases vpon him, that vnable to weld and support the state of his owne bodie, much lesse the affaires of the Colonie, he was forced with griefe of heart, through the anguish and dolor of his maladie, and for remedie to saue his life, after eight mo∣neths sicknesse to returne for England a∣gaine: which when the Aduenturers saw that the expectance of such a preparation came to nothing, how great a dampe of coldnesse it wrought in the hearts of all, may easily be deemed. And yet had we left one sparke of hope vnquencht, for before wee knew any such thing of his Lordships weaknesse, or once
imagined his returning home, we had fur∣nisht out Sir Thomas Dale with a good sup∣plie of three ships, men, cattell, and many prouisions: all which ariued safe at the Colonie the 10. of May 1611. And notwith∣standing the Knight at his landing there, found the Lord Gouernour to bee gone, whereof he wrote vs home most dolefull letters, as also of the fewnesse, idlenesse and weake estate wherein hee found the Colony; yet decyphered he the country in diuers of his letters with admirable praise, giuing vs notice of his proceeding to for∣tifie, to build, to plant, and that the health of our men was now recouered by setting them to labour, assuring the aduenturers so long as he remained there, their ships should neuer returne emptie; his words are these: The words of Sir Thomas Dales letter to the Commit∣ties. But if any thing otherwise then well betide me in this businesse, let me commend vnto your carefulnesse, the pursuite and dig∣nitie of this businesse, then which your purses and endeuours will neuer open nor trauell in a more acceptable and meritorious enterprize, take foure of the best kingdomes in Christen∣dome,
and put them all together, they may no way compare with this countrie, either for com∣modities or goodnesse of soile. And this sparke (I say) so kindled in the hearts of those constant aduenturers, that in the greatest disasters neuer fainted, which hauing past ouer so many foule and wearie steps, and seeing now so faire a way before them, bent all their wits and consultations how to second this good beginning of such a setled gouernment. And after many mee∣tings, when they could resolue vpon no great supplie for want of meanes, the dis∣couragement of many being such by for∣mer ill successe, yet in fine it was resolued; through the importunate zeale and for∣wardnesse of some, against the opinion of many, without delay to furnish our Sir Thomas Gates with sixe shippes, three hun∣dred men and an hundred kine, with other cattell, munition and prouisions of all sorts, which notwithstanding it grew so deepe an engagement of our purses and credits, that for the present wee knew not how to discharge it, yet assuredly it hath
proued (as wee hope) the most fortunate and happie steppe that euer our businesse tooke, Lord Generall Cecill, Sir Ro∣bert Mansell and some o∣thers. and hath highly approued the wis∣dome and resolution of those worthy gen∣tlemen that were the causers of it: and so at this period, as with a cleare euening to a cloudie day, I will put an end to this my first part of relating things already done and past. The second part ensueth of the present estate of the businesse, vpon which point I know that all mens eares are now most at∣tent, for which I must be sparing to speake so much as might bee said, for surely men will not beleeue (though nature daily shew it in other courses) that in this case yet, so great a tide of flowing should suddenly ensue so great an ebbe of want, in last De∣cember Captaine Newport in the Starre, and since that fiue other shippes are ari∣ued heere from the Colonie, by which we know that Sir Thomas Gates with his sixe shippes, men and cattell, safelie ariued at James Towne, about the fine of August last, the suddaine approach of such an vn∣looked
for supplie, did so amaze our peo∣ple, when the Fort had first descried the Fleete, and gaue it out for enemies, that so so one as the newes went vp the riuer to Sir Thomas Dale, he being a warlike and reso∣lute Captaine, prepared him instantly and all the rest for an encounter, which by how much the suddaine apprehension perplex∣ed their minds for the present, yet so much the more exceeded their comfort, when they knew them to be friends. When they had all things well landed, and giuen thankes to God, the Knights and Captaines now began to frame the Colonie to a new conformitie, whereof the Lord Gouernour at his being there, most carefullie had more then laide the ground before, their first and chiefest care was shewed in setling Lawes diuine and morall, for the honour and seruice of God, for daily frequenting the Church, the house of prayer, at the toling of the bell, for preaching, catechizing, and the reli∣gious obseruation of the Sabbath day, for due reuerence to the Ministers of the
Word, and to all superiours, for peace and loue among themselues, and enforcing the idle to paines and honest labours, against blasphemie, contempt and dishonour of God, against breach of the Sabbath by ga∣ming: and otherwise against adulterie, sa∣criledge and felonie; and in a word, against all wrongfull dealing amongst themselues, or iniurious violence against the Indians. Good are these beginnings wherein God is thus before, good are these lawes, and long may they stand in their due executi∣on. But what is this (will some obiect) if wholesome lodging, cloathing for the backe and bodilie foode be wanting, the bellie pincht with hunger cannot heare, though your charme be otherwise neuer so sweet. All this was true, we haue alrea∣die confest it, when there was nothing but a confused troope that sought their owne consumption, tempora mutantur. You shall know that our Colonie con∣sisteth now of seuen hundred men at least, of sundrie arts and professions, some more or lesse, they stand in health, and few sicke,
at the ships comming thence, hauing left the fort at Cape Henry, fortified and kept by Captaine Dauies, and the keeping of James towne to that noble and well deser∣uing Gentleman Master George Percie. He went thi∣ther fiue yeeres since in the first ship. The Colonie is remoued vp the riuer foure∣score miles further beyond James towne to a place of higher ground, strong and defencible by nature, a good aire, whole∣some and cleere (vnlike the marish seate at James towne) with fresh and plentie of wa∣ter springs, much faire and open grounds freed from woods, and wood enough at hand. Being thus inuited, here they pitch, the spade men fell to digging, the brickmen burnt their bricks, the company cut down wood, the Carpenters fell to squaring out, the Sawyers to sawing, the Souldier to fortifying, and euery man to somewhat. And to answer the first obiection for hole∣some lodging, here they haue built com∣petent and decent houses, the first storie all of bricks, that euery man may haue his lodging and dwelling place apart by him∣selfe,
with a sufficient quantitie of ground alotted thereto for his orchard and gar∣den to plant at his pleasure, and for his own vse. Here they were building also an Hos∣pitall with fourescore lodgings (and beds alreadie sent to furnish them) for the sicke and lame, with keepers to attend them for their comfort and recouerie. And as for their clothing, first of wollen (whereof they haue least need, because the countrie is very warme) it is and must be alwaies supplied from hēce, to the benefit of Eng∣lish clothing: but for linnen, which they shall most need, without doubt by small and easie industrie there may amount a great increase from thence, to furnish by way of merchandise, for England, not on∣ly by planting Hemp and Flax, which that climate maketh farre surpassing ours, both in growth and goodnesse, but by a new found stuffe of a certaine sedge or water∣flagge (reuealed vnto them by an Indian) which groweth there naturally in endlesse abundance, and with little paines of boy∣ling, it being gathered, yeeldeth great
quantitie of sundrie sorts of skeines of good strength and length, some like silke, and some like flax, and some a courser sort, as hempe: whereof the last ships brought hither for a triall about two hundred pound waight; which being put to triall heere (as many can witnesse which haue seene it) wil make cordage, linnen, and fine stuffes both for strength and beautie, such as no vse nor seruice can finde the like of any other kinde. And for the last and maine obiection of food, it cannot be denied by any one of reason, but with their now diligent plan∣ting and sowing of corne (whereof they haue two haruests in a sommer) the plen∣tifull fishing there, the store of fowles and fruits of the earth, their present prouision sent from hence at euery shipping, toge∣ther with the speedy increase of those sun∣drie sorts of tame Poultry, Conies, Goats, Swine and Kine landed there aboue a yere agoe with Sir Thomas Dale, and since a∣gaine by Sir Thomas Gates, that this obie∣ction too, this maine obiection of wan∣ting
food is vtterly remooued: so that I cannot see, nor any man else can iudge in truth, but that ill and odious wound of Ʋirginea, which setled so deepe a scarre in the mindes of many, is so sufficiently reco∣uered, as it may now encourage not such alone (as heretofore) which cannot liue at home, nor lay their bones to labour, but those of honest minds and better sort, which get their bread but meanly heere, may seeke to mend it there. Captaine Sa∣muel Argoll, a Gentleman of good seruice, is readie with two ships. The Lord Gouernour himselfe is now preparing to goe in his owne person, and sundrie other Knights and Gentlemen, with ships and men, so farre as our meanes will extend to furnish: and for preuenting that wrong, Sir W. S. Sir R. W. which some Masters and Ste∣wards haue formerly done to their pas∣sengers at sea, in shortening their allow∣ance, for their owne priuate lucar, it is or∣dered that euery ship vpon her mast shall haue it written, what ought to be euerie daies allowance, that euery one may see
it, and no man be defrauded. And thus much briefly for the present condition of this plantation. It followes now to conclude with the third and last diuision directed to the Co∣lonie: And first to you the heads & guides of that plantation, it cannot be doubted, but as you are wise and prouident men you tooke this worke in hand, forecasting wisely that the price thereof might be no lesse then the care of your mindes, the la∣bour of your bodies, and perill of your liues. And seeing you are sure of nothing more then the extremest lots, which either the barren coldnesse of such a naked acti∣on in the infancie thereof, or the malice of diuellish men can cast vpon you, arme your selues therefore against all impedi∣ments, to effect those honorable ends that were first intended to be put vpon our King, vpon our nation, and Christian religion, by that plantation. If the work be more hard and difficult then you took it for, and that you must like Hannibal (piercing the stony Alpes) make cleare the way to your desi∣red
ends with fire and vineger; will not your honour be the greater, and your ser∣uice more acceptable in the performance of it? Nay, if losse of life befall you by this seruice (which God forbid) yet in this case too, wee doubt not but you are resolued with cōstant courage, like that noble King Henry the fift, before his triumphant vi∣ctorie in the fields of Agincourt, where see∣ing the fewnesse of his own, and multitude of enemies, like a valiant Champion to stir vp his little Armie, against that great con∣flict; Be cheered my hearts (said he) and let vs fight like English men, all England prayeth for vs: if here we dye, let this be our comfort, our cause is good, and wee haue fathers, bro∣thers, friends and countrimen that wil reuenge our deaths. Your first conflict is from your sauage enemies the natiues of the Countrie, who as you know are neither strong nor ma∣ny; their strongest forces are sleights and trecherie, more to bee warily preuented then much to be feared. But as for those your other friends, which challenge it all
as theirs by deed of gift, not from Alexan∣der the Great King of Macedonia, but from Alexander of Rome, Viceroy of that great Prince, which offered at once the whole world to haue himselfe adored, which (as is said) doe brute it out in all mens eares to pull you out of possession; you know they are but men, Their wisdome is such as they will offer you no wrong. and such as your selues can well remember, that in all attempts a∣gainst our late Soueraigne, God defeated their-purposes, and brought them to no∣thing. But howsoeuer it fared then, (God in mercy shielding that gratious Queene, that no attempt could touch her little fin∣ger, nor worke her least dishonour) yet I am no Prophet to warrant now, but God (for causes knowne to him) may giue you as a prey into the hands of the weakest, yet herein rest assured, and it cannot possiblie bee otherwise, but that the zeale of this action hath discouered such and so many worthie spirits of all degrees in England to be vpholders of it, as for their credits sake and reputation, will neuer leaue you without conuenient meanes to make de∣fence,
not your least indignitie by sauage foes or ciuill friends will suffer vnrequi∣ted. There is laid vpon you in this worke a threefold labour to be done vpon your selues, vpon your English, and vpon the poore Indians. And first vpon your selues; for all mens eares and eyes are so fixed vpon Kings and Rulers, that they keepe a register in minde of what euer they doe or speake, the better sort of loue to imitate their goodnes, & the looser sort of flatte∣rie to applaud their wickednes and sooth them in their vices: when your wholesom lawes shall haue no execution, when you shall publish and pretend for the honour of God, and good of the publike weale, and yet shall care for neither of both, but be loose in your own course of life, giuing way to ambition, idlenesse, and all vnbrid∣led appetite, to your tongues in swearing, to your bodies in vnchastity, making your owne Courts and houses cages of proud, vncleane and all disordered persons, en∣forcing the good to pine away with grief, and aduancing men of bad deserts, ac∣counting
it happie to doe what you list, when no man dares reproue you; miserie and confusion will be the end of this, and you shal leaue for your monuments shame and dishonour behinde you to all poste∣ritie. But if, like wise and prudent guides, as we do rightly esteeme you, in rearing this great frame, you shall lay the foundation in your owne steps, and by your owne ex∣ample shall teach your inferiours the feare of God, and by your modest recreations, and commendable labours shall leade thē on to doe the like, especially in that most wholesome, profitable and pleasant work of planting, in which it pleased God him∣selfe to set the first man and most excel∣lent creature Adam in his innocencie, to which the best Kings of Israel were most addicted, and by which so many kingdoms are much inriched, and for which the no∣ble King Cirus that great Monarch is so much commended, whose glorie was to all Ambassadors and forraine States (not∣withstanding his being a Souldier and a
Conquerour of great employment) in shewing the comelie order of his owne handie worke. When thus your light shall guide their feete, sweete will that harmo∣nie be betweene the head and members of the bodie, then may sleepe the rigour of your lawes, and you shal resemble the best and wisest sort of Kings, which by the in∣fluence of their grace and loue doe dailie cure consumptions, melancholies and euil affected mindes, as also make their hearts more honest and vpright, and then that worke (though burnt as stubble hereto∣fore) yet being thus grounded shal abide, you shall liue in honour, and die in peace; the suceeding ages of those conuerted In∣fidels shall count you happy, and that pre∣tious seed which you haue sowne in teares, shalbe as blessed sheaues vpon your heads for euer. The next is dutie towards your Colo∣nie (the common sort of English) and that in few words, let them liue as free English men, vnder the gouernment of iust and equall lawes, and not as slaues after the
will and lust of any superiour: discourage them not in growing religious, nor in ga∣thering riches, two especiall bonds (whe∣ther seuered or conioyned) to keepe them in obedience, the one for conscience sake, the other for feare of losing what they haue gotten: without the first they are prophane, without the second desperate, and apt for euery factious plot to bee in∣struments of mischiefe. Such haue alwaies bin the beggarly, ignorant and superstiti∣ous sort of Irish, & no better were we our English (and Scottish nation too) euer vn∣quiet, neuer constant, readie for insurre∣ctions and murther, to depose their Kings, and maintaine rebellion, before the daies of that renowned Deborah our late Soue∣raigne, that shining starre, the splendour of whose brightnesse, darkned the glorie of all other Princes in her time (as euen popish historians of sundrie forraine Na∣tions tearme her) who brought vs to that light, whereby wee liue as men of know∣ledge in due subiection, enioying honour, peace and wealth, the handmaids of reli∣gion.
We must confesse as yet you are but poore, your companie few, and your meanes vnable to effect those ends in any great measure. For which sort of men we wish we had better content to giue them, or they were more willing for the seruice. But for the first steppe, you haue some Preachers there alreadie, and more wee intend to send you so soone as they may be prouided. And for the second, the land is before you to dispose to euerie man for his house and ground, wherein to employ himselfe for his owne benefit, that no man may liue idle nor vnprofita∣ble. And for their better incouragement in doing well, aduance all such of best dis∣posed life, and none but such: and though your preferments be not great, nor your Common-wealth setled, yet now is most need of these admonitions: for in the be∣ginning & prime of your businesse, whiles you are but young and few, those succee∣ding enormities of briberie, drunkennesse and disordered life, may sooner be pre∣uented, then hauing once got habite and footing amongst you they can be redres∣sed: for if in laying now the ground work of your businesse, you suffer it to be smo∣thered
vp together with impunitie of vi∣ces, (as feeds and roots of noisome weeds) they will soone spring vp to such corrup∣tion in all degrees as can neuer bee wee∣ded out. And for the poore Indians what shall I say, but God that hath many waies shewed mercie to you, make you shew mercie to them and theirs. And howsoeuer they may seeme vnto you so intollerable wic∣ked and rooted in mischiefe, that they can∣not be moued, yet consider rightly and be not discouraged, they are no worse then the nature of Gentiles, and euen of those Gentiles so hainouslie decyphered by S. Paul to bee full of wickednesse, Rom. 1. haters of God, doers of wrong, such as could neuer be appeased, and yet himselfe did liue to see, that by the fruits of his owne labours, many thousands euen of them became true beleeuing Christians, and of whose race and ofspring consisteth (well neere) the whole Church of God at this day. This is the worke that wee first intended, and haue publisht to the world to be chiefe in
our thoughts, to bring those infidell peo∣ple from the worship of Diuels to the ser∣uice of God. And this is the knot that you must vntie, or cut asunder, before you can conquer those sundrie impediments, that will surely hinder all other proceedings, if this be not first preferred. Take their children and traine them vp with gentlenesse, teach them our Eng∣lish tongue, and the principles of religion; winne the elder sort by wisedome and dis∣cretion, make them equal with your Eng∣lish in case of protection wealth and habi∣tation, doing iustice on such as shall doe them wrong. Weapons of warre are need∣full, I grant, but for defence only, and not in this case. If you seeke to gaine this vi∣ctorie vpon them by stratagems of warre, you shall vtterly lose it, and neuer come neere it, but shall make your names odi∣ous to all their posteritie. In steed of Iron and steele you must haue patiēce and hu∣manitie to manage their crooked nature to your forme of ciuilitie: for as our pro∣uerbe is, Looke how you winne them, so
you must we are them: if by way of peace and gentlenesse, then shall you alwaies range them in loue to you wards, and in peace with your English people; and by proceeding in that way, shall open the springs of earthly benefits to them both, and of safetie to your selues. Imitating the steppes of your wise and prudent. Soueraigne, and preparing the way of peace (so much as lies in you) be∣fore the second comming of that King of peace, at whose first comming into this earthly region the world was all in peace, vnder the peaceable regiment of Augustus Caesar, who though an vnbeleeuing Hea∣then, yet of such excellent morall vertues, as might set to schoole many Christian Kings and Rulers, whose care and studie for the safety, peace and Common-wealth of his Empire, gat him such honour in his life, and loue of all his subiects, that being dead, his losse was so lamented with ex∣cesse of griefe and sorrow, but most a∣mongst the Romanes, that they wisht to God hee had neuer been borne, or being
borne, hee might neuer haue died. And so I come to you that be the Ad∣uenturers here in England: with which I will conclude, it is not much aboue an hundred yeeres agoe, that these Aduentu∣res for discoueries were first vndertaken by the Southerne parts of Christendome, but especially so seconded and followed by the Spanish nation both to the East and West Indies, that Mendoza (their coun∣triman) in his treatise of Warre, extolleth King Philip and the Spanish nation aboue the skies, for seeking in such fort to in∣large their bounds by sea and land, see∣ming (as it were) with a secret scorne to set out the baseneste of our English and other nations in this, that they neuer intend any such attempts, but with a kind of sluggish contentment, doe account it their happi∣nesse to keepe that poore little which they possesse. Indeed wee must acknowledge it, with praise to God, that when some of theirs had cast an euill eye vpon our pos∣sessions, Ireland. it was our happinesse to preuent their longing, and to send them emptie
home. But for that other part of inlar∣ging their bounds, in truth their praise is duly giuen, and well deserued: and it may iustly serue to stirre vs vp by all our means to put off such reprochfull censures; and seeing when time did offer it, our nation lost the first opportunity of hauing all, yet now to make good that common speech, that English men are best at imitation, and doe soone excell their teachers. It is knowne well enough to you, what need we haue in this case, to stirre vp (if it were possible) our whole nation: for not∣withstanding wee haue in our Letters Patents, the names of many Lords and Knights, Gentlemen, Marchants and o∣thers, able in truth to performe a greater matter then this, if we were al of one mind; but as they are many, so I may diuide them as thus into three equall parts: The one third part are such, as tooke liking of the plantation, and brought in one aduen∣ture, expecting a while till they saw some disasters to accompanie the businesse, whereas they looked for present gaine,
and so they gaue it ouer, bidding it adiew, and neuer lookt after it more. Another third part are such as came in, and with their own hands did vnderwrite to furnish three aduentures in three yeeres: whereof some few of them haue paid the first pai∣ment, but refuse to pay the rest; yet most of them, notwithstanding they are tied by their owne handwriting, (whereby a very great charge was vndertaken by the Com∣panie) doe vtterly refuse to make any pai∣ment at all: which if it proceeded out of their pouertie it were not so much to bee blamed; for wee presse no man out of his inability to wrong himselfe: but these are of the greater sort, such as would scorne to haue it said they offer wrong in hazar∣ding the losse of all, and the liues of many men. I doubt not but some reasonable course will be taken by your honourable wisedomes to make them see their error: in the meane time, I know not how to call this kinde of dealing. But I remember of one that takes vpon him to describe King Richard vsurper, and comming to his vi∣sage,
he saith it was sterne, such as in Kings wee call warlike, but in meaner men crab∣bed. Surely if this kinde of fast and loose were plaid by men of meaner sort, I could soone tell how to tearme it: but if you will needes haue it warlike, in respect of their sterne refusall, yet let it be crabbed too, because of their sower lookes when they see the Collectors come for mony. So that of all our Aduenturers, I may well say there is but one third part, which (to their praise) from the first vndertaking to this day, haue not ceased to giue their counsels, spend their times, and lay downe their monies, omitting no occasion to ex∣presse their zeale for effecting (if it may be possible) so great a worke for their King and Countries honour, as our nation ne∣uer tooke the like in hand. And for this cause, the burthen being heauier then may well be borne by the shoulders of so few willing mindes, wee doe still prouoke our priuate friends, and haue now obtained the helpe of publike Lotteries to main∣taine the same. Which though it bee no
vsuall course in England, yet very com∣mon in diuers neighbour countries, for the publike seruice of most commenda∣ble actions, wherein no man being com∣pelled to aduenture lots further then his owne liking, and being assured of direct and currant dealing, though all his lots come blanke; yet if his minde be vpright, he rests content in this, that his money go∣eth to a publike work, wherein he hath his part of benefit, though he, neuer so meane and remote in his dwelling. And if any man aske, what benefit can this plantation be to them that be no Ad∣uenturers therein, but only in the Lottery? First, we say, (setting aside their possibilitie of prize) what man so simple that doth not see the necessitie of employment for our multitude of people? which though they be our florishing fruits of peace & health, yet be they no longer good and holesome in themselues, then either our domesticke or forraine actions can make them profi∣table, or not hurtfull to the Common∣wealth.
And as it is vnpossible without this course of sending out the ofspring of our families, in so great a bodie of many mil∣lions, which yeerely doe increase amongst vs, to preuent their manifold diseases of pouertie, corruption of minde, and pesti∣lent infection, so the burthen thereof in some proportion is felt by euery man in his priuate calling, either in the taxe of their maintenance and daily reliefe, or in the taint of their vices and bodily plagues. And by this meanes only it may soone be eased, to the sensible good of euery man, as in the greater safetie and freedom from infection, so in the price and plentie of all outward and necessarie things. And besides the example of our neigh∣bour countries, (that hauing laid their armes aside, and dwelling now in peace, to shunne the harmes of idlenesse at home, doe send out fleetes and hosts of men to seeke abroad) experience teacheth vs, what need we haue to feeke some world of new employment, for so great a part of our strength, which not otherwise know∣ing
how to liue, doe daily runne out to robberies at home, and piracies abroad, arming and seruing with Turkes and Infi∣dels against Christians, to the generall da∣mage and spoile of Merchants, the scan∣dall of our nation, and reproch of Chri∣stian name. As also for the wits of Eng∣land, whereof so many of vnsetled braines betake themselues to plots & stratagems at home, or else to wander from coast to coast, from England to Spaine, to Jtaly, to Rome, and to wheresoeuer they may learne and practise any thing else but goodnesse, pulling a world of temptations vpon their bad dispositions, sorting so farre with that inchanting sorts of serpents, and yeelding to their lure, till getting the marke and stampe in their forehead, they become de∣sperate and despitefull fugitiues abroad, or else returning neutrals in religion, are neuer good for Church nor Common∣wealth. Let the words of that learned Master Ascham witnesse in this case, who aboue twentie yeeres agone, hauing farre lesse
cause of complaint then wee haue now, did publish his censure of those English I∣talionate trauellers in these words: 24. page of teaching the bringing vp of youth. For re∣ligion, they get Papistrie, or worse: for learning, lesse commonly then they carried out: for poli∣cie, a factious heart, a discoursing head, a minde to meddle in all mens matters: for experience, plenty of new mischiefes, neuer knowne in Eng∣land before: for manners, varietie of vanities, and change of filthie liuing. These be the in∣chantments of Circes, brought out of Italie to marre English mens manners, much by example of ill life, but more by precepts of fond bookes of late translated out of Italian into English, sold in euery shop in London, commended by honest titles, the sooner to corrupt honest manners, de∣dicated ouer boldly to vertuous and bonor able personages, the easier to beguile simple and in∣nocent wits. Tenne Sermons at Pauls Crosse doe not so much good for mouing men to true doctrine, as one of those bookes doe harme with inticing men to ill liuing: yea, I say further, those bookes tend not so much to corrupt honest liuing, as they do to subuert true religion; more Papists made by the merrie bookes of Italie,
then by the earnest bookes of Louaine. These and many moe are the flowing euils of those noisome streames, that may bee stopped, or turned from vs (though not altogether (which is vnpossible) yet in some proportion, for the common good of euery man) by these new discoueries, in∣to so great a world, neuer yet knowne, nor inhabited by Christian men: and though that part of Ʋirginea, wherein we seate, be nothing to the rest, not yet discouered, yet it is enough to men of sense rightly consi∣dering, to make them confesse so much as I haue said. If any shall obiect, want of meanes, or inabilitie for the subiects of our King, to vndertake so great a worke in those re∣mote and desert countries, it were too in∣iurious: For first it hath been done by o∣thers, to whom wee are no way inferiour for multitude, strength and meanes to doe the like: and secondly, our prouocations are now more then euer they were. For touching our multitude of men, as I re∣member, and I assure my selfe I did see the
note, and am not mistaken, in that great yeere of 88, here was billed for the first, se∣cond and third seruice of the Queene (if need had required) of able persons, thirtie hundred thousand of English, Welsh, and Cornish men; since which time it cannot otherwise be thought, and the great in∣largement of townes and buildings shew that we haue much increased; besides that happie addition since of an entire king∣dome, being a warlike, wise, and a stout na∣tion, that were then no members of vs. And for strength of shipping, skilfull men and meanes to furnish greater attempts then this, the world can witnesse (to the griefe of some) that England hath no want at all. And for our prouocations, what can bee greater then from the highest? from God that hath giuen vs the light of his word, that wee might enlighten this blind people: that did prouide (when we despai∣red greatly and feared who should weld the Scepter) a King (with peerlesse bran∣ches) to sit ouer vs in peace, whom the world cannot match, that hath bent his
royall minde, and of his princely ofspring, to forward and aduance the best and most approoued actions, In Scotland and England too. at home and abroad, that hath giuen him to set his feete vpon his enemies necks, and hath made the poy∣son of their infected The powder men. hearts to work their owne confusion, and the most bitter hear∣ted aduersarie to die for sorrow to see his prosperitie: Parsons, &c. by which we are assured, that God doth reserue him to many excellent ends, and by whose wisedome we are dai∣ly inuited vnder the shadow of our owne vine, to repose our selues in peace and rest. How are they thus deiected then in their honourable thoughts, so many both English men and Scottish, which seeme not like thēselues, that to so infinit good ends, and notwithstanding the forcible inticements and powerfull meanes to ef∣fect the same, will yet sit still, and neither helpe on this, nor any like publike action, with their persons, purse nor counsell? How far is this vnlike their ancient guise in former times, when for the name of
Christ, and honour of their nations, they aduentured thorow the world to winne it with the sword? Well, if they will needs so much forget themselues, let this suffice to conclude them as vnprofitable members, emptying and keeping drie the fountaine at home, when with others they might seek to fill it from abroad: suffering the wealth of the world, of this new world, which is knowne to abound in treasure, if not to sleepe in the dust, yet to slide away, and there to settle; where it reuiueth the spirit of that viprous brood, The English Iesuits, and others. which seek to heale againe that wounded head of Rome, by instigating therewith, and anointing the hornes of such, as when time shall serue, will seeke to pearce our hearts. And if it be asked, what benefit shall any man reape, in liew of his disbursements, by that barren countrie, which hath so consu∣med all our employments? It hath been alreadie declared to the world in sundrie discourses, containing sufficient encou∣ragement to men of vnderstanding, and therefore not needfull heere to lay out
againe, the vndoubted certaintie of mine∣rals, the rich and commodious meanes for shipping, and other materials of great vse, which if they were not alreadie publisht, wee would vtterly forbeare to name, till (after the plantation setled) the effects and fruits should shew themselues. And besides al which things, that Nature hath already seated there, the soile and climate is so apt and fit for industrious mindes, to make plantation of so many pretious plants (as hath been likewise shewed in particular) for the vse of mankind and trade of mer∣chandise, as to the sense and reason of such as haue seene it, no Countrie vnder heauen can goe beyond it. And so to end with this that hath been said, which if it may suffice to satisfie the ignorant, to stop the mouthes of cauil∣lers, and to stirre vp more assistance to this enterprise, it is enough: if not, I doe not doubt, but God who effecteth oft the greatest ends by smallest meanes, and hath so farre blest those few hands as to pro∣cure this birth, will likewise still assist the
same to bring it vp with honour. Proceed therefore you noble Lords, and you wise religious gentlemen, in your constant re∣solution, and in your dailie prayers re∣member it, for this worke is of such conse∣quence, as for many important reasons it must neuer be forsaken. And as you haue not shrunke away, (with many such of worse conditiō, which before they see it effected by others, will neuer aduenture any thing) but (like that worthie Romane Scipio, preseruer of his Countrie, which when all the Romanes in that sudden feare of Hannibals approch, threw off their armes to take themselues to flight, drew out his sword, and staied their running out, and ruine of the citie) haue in your own persons with exceeding paines, aduentured in the most desperate condition thereof, to keep the work from ruine, and haue set it in that hopefull way to subsist of it selfe, as whether you liue or no, to see the fruites thereof on earth, yet your reward shall be with God: and for example to posteritie, in being the first
props and pillars of the work, the records of time shall publish your praise; not stai∣ned with lies as the Legends of Saints, but as those renowned deedes of your noble ancestors, truly set out in our English sto∣ries, still liuing (as it were) and reaching out the hand, speaking to them that fol∣low after, and telling to such as shall succeed, This is the way for the ho∣nour of your King, and your Countries good. FINIS.
