MALIGNANTS Remember Rochell: OR A Warning to the Protestants OF ENGLAND. printer's or publisher's device LONDON Printed by J. M. and are to be sold by M. S. June 20th 1645.
Remember Rochel. NOt long after our Kings Match with France, there was a designe in that Realme to extirpate the Protestants, and surprize all their fortified Townes in that Kingdome, whereof Rochell was the princi∣pall; which being a maritaine Towne, fur∣nished with a good Fleet of Ships, able to make good their Harbour, and furnish themselves with provisions and supplies from all their Pro∣testant friends, maugre all the Sea-forces of the French King; thereupon the French Cardinall Richelieu and his confederates taking the ad∣vantage of their new interest in the King of England, by reason of this marriage; import∣uned him to lend his Brother of France the Vaunt-guard, one of the Vessels of his royall Navy, and seven Merchant-men of warre, to be imployed in his service by sea: which the King condescending to, sent the said Ships un∣der the command of Captaine Pennington into France, to be imployed as the French King and
his Counsell should prescribe. Who designing them for service against Rochell, to surprize their Ships, blockt up their Haven, and intercept their trade and reliefe, contrary to their expect∣ation; the Captaines, Masters and Mariners of the Ships were so much discontented, that they were designed against the Rochelers, who were not onely their friends, but the chiefe pro∣fessors and maintainers of the Protestant Religi∣on in those parts, and that they should be made the instruments of their ruine, and draw the guilt of their innocent Protestant blood upon their soules, that they all unanimously resolved, they would rather dye, sinke, or be hanged up at the Masts of their Ships, then stirre one jot, or weigh anchor for such an unchristian detest∣able imployment. Captaine Pennington their Admirall, and the French used all the rhetorick and perswasions they could to alter this their heroick and most Christian resolution but they continued inflexible, and would neither by al∣lurements, rewards, nor threats be drawne to such an unworthy action, resolving rather to sink then stirre therein. Whereupon Captaine Pennington acquainted his Majesty and the Duke of Buckingham by Letters with this their peremptory resolution, and desires their di∣rection
herein? the King (I know not by whose ill advice) returns him this answer both by word of mouth and this ensuing Warrant. CHARLES. R. Pennington, THese are to charge & require you uppon sight hereof; that without all difficulty and delay, you put our former Commande∣ment in execution for the consigning of the ship under your charge, cal'd the Vaunt∣guard, into the hands of the Marquesse de Effort, with all her Equipage, Artille∣ry, and Ammunition, assuring the Officers of the said Ship whom it may concern, that we will provide for their indemnity; and We further charge and command you that you also require the seven merchants ships in Our Name, to put themselves into the service of Our dear Brother the French King, according to the promise made unto him: and in case of back-wardnesse or re∣fusall, We command you to use all forcible means in your power to compell them ther∣to, even to their sinking; and in these seve∣rall
charges see you fail not, as you will an∣swer the contrary at your utmost perill; and this shall be your sufficient Warrant. Given at Our Court at Richmond, the 28. of July 1625. To Our Trusty and Wel∣beloved, John Penning∣ton, Captain of Our Ship called the Vaunt-guard. UPon receit of this Warrant Captain Pen∣nington (as we have been certainly infor∣med from very credible persons of note, privy to the transactions of this businesse) threat∣ned to shoot and sink the Ships, and hang up the Mariners that refused to yeeld obedience, and serve against Rochell; but they all unani∣mously declined the service, bidding him doe his pleasure with them; for goe against the Rochelers they would never; but if they were commanded upon any other service not against the Protestants, they would obey: Whereupon those who refused to serve in this expedition, were commanded to quit the Ships and returne into England; which all did but two, (who soone after came to desperate ends, the one be∣ing blowne up with Gun-powder, the other drowned or slaine.) Upon this, the English Ships were according to this direction, delive∣red to the French, manned with French-men &
other Forreigners, and joyning with some more Vessels of the French King, destroyed the Ro∣chell Fleet, blocked up their Haven, & ruined that famous Protestant City, with most of the Protestants in it; which after a long and sharp siege by sea and land, was through famine sur∣rendred into the Papist hands; the losse where∣of was generally, if not justly imputed to our ill Counsellers; who after they had been instru∣ments to destroy their Ships, the principall meanes of their safety, support, and preserva∣tion, by an unfortunate voyage of the Duke of Buckingham to the isle of Ree (to what end but to ruine Rochell and the Protestant party in France, or to revenge the disappointment of his lust, as many muttered, is yet unknowne to the world) exhausted their Ammunition, Victuals, provisions, men, to supply our necessi∣ties at Ree, and after our departure thence, left our sicke and maimed souldiers there to help devour the residue of their empty stores, and then suffe∣red them to be blocked up at Sea: when we had thus engaged them on our behalf, neglecting to send them timely supplies of Victuall, Amuniti∣on, shipping, men (which was strangely delayed from time to time contrary to promise) and when
our ships went at last, they gave over the designe of re∣lieving it as desperate, before ever they assayed whether it was feasible (as Master Henry now Lord Iermin, and some others in that unfortunate expedition informed me) & then making onely a Bravado towards the Barracado, as if they meant to force it with their fireships, and en∣gines made with great stones (brought to London to re∣paire Pauls & so unlikely to do any good service for Ro∣chell) they discharged their Ordnance very valiantly a∣bove a league or two from the Workes they were to force, and with-out adventuring neerer or attempting to force the Barre, returned prefently with infinite dis∣honour for England, leaving all their fireships and En∣gines in them to the French in a most unwarlike man∣ner: but in their returne homewards many of these Ships were wrecked, drowned in a tempest, who would not ad∣venture sinking in a fight, and the whole Navy shattered. Soone after which, poor Rochell (thus deserted and be∣traid, was surrendred into the French Kings & Cardi∣nals possession, and all the Protestant Townes in France surprized, yeelded, pillage,, dismantled; so as they have since no Town or Fort of strength to retire unto, to preserve themselves from the force or massacres of their bloody Adversaries, to whose mercilesse cruelties they are now wholly exposed upon all occasions by our meanes. I pray God this treachery against them, and the blood of those many thousand Protestants then shed in France by our occasion, be not one principall cause why God (by way of retaliation) hath permitted the Papists in Ireland and England to shed so much Prote∣stant blood in these Realms as they have done of late, for our refusing or neglecting to avenge their blood upon those romanized Conspirators, who were the occasion of this their irrepairable losse and bloodshed.
