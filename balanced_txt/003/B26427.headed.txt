TO THE LADY MARQƲISE OF DOUGLAS. MADAM, I Have presumed to offer Your Ladyship this litle Work, such as it is, a small fruit of my Stu∣dy; which as it concerns all Bearing Women (for convenien∣cy of the Matter treated therein, their Welfare to wit, and Safety in that Condition: A more commodious Birth also, and safer propagation of the Fruit of their Womb) so chiefly the more Noble and Honourable, as be∣ing more Excellent, more Tender and Delicate, and readily more opprest with the Symptoms: To be the Mothers be∣side
of Hero's, or a more worthy and illustrious Off-spring, the Quin∣tessence of Mankind, these visible gods, which must propogate and support the Splendor and Dignities of the World. It is most fit then, decent and necessar, that such understand the state of Preg∣nancy and its Accidents: Of Bearing also and Child bed, to Govern and Pre∣serve, or Relieve themselves, through the manifold Calamities and Perils thereof. To Order likewise, Nourish and Preserve, or yet Cure and Releive their Noble and Delicate Infants, in the manifold Maladies attends that Age, from the very first entry of Life, whereby it oftimes languishes and is ruined; that Health may be got fixed in∣to their tender Bodies, which else re∣mains unserviceable: And hence also their Minds degenerous. Suffer me therefore, most Noble Lady, with that Humility and Submis∣sion as is meet, to depositate the same at Your Feet, as a small Token of my Af∣festion,
Respect and Observance, and of a Mind perpetually confecrated to Your Service; which if I shall understand not to be inacceptible (and of Old, nei∣ther hithertil, are Paper Presents un∣usual, nor yet despised) and that You vouchsafe me good Will and Favour, I have wherein to be glad as no small Re∣ward of my Labour. Nor would I but chuse Your Illustrious Name, being ver∣tuous Consort to the Noble Marques of Douglas, whose most obsequious Vassal and Client I am, as for other Causes, so by vertue of my Native Soyl: To build that Noble House also. A Lady beside of Noble generous Birth and Education: Of all exquisit Vertues: An absolut Pat∣tern of true Piety & Prudence: Of grea∣test Elegancy, adorning and sincerity of Life, of upright, chast, entire Behaviour and unstained Fame: And tho High, yet admirably Affable, Modest and Cour∣teous. But I will not offend Your Ears with a heap of Elogies, however most true▪ Only let me hope Your candid and
favourable Acceptance of this Dedica∣tion, as it proceeds from me with Affe∣ction and Observance: Your Pardon also, if I be thought Impudent and Rash, for so mean and small a Gift, and I be∣ing hitherto unknown to Your Ladiship. Yet however I must not cease wishing to Your Ladiship all Welfare and Hap∣piness (with Your Noble Lord and Earl of Angus) the Blessing of a happy Off∣spring: And such an Increase to the Po∣sterity of Douglasses (a Race so Ancient and Renouned) as fabulous Antiquity attributes to the Golden Tree, that one Twig being pluckt off from that Noble House, another Golden Branch may never be wanting, which may still flou∣rish with the same Mettal. From him who craves nothing save to be, MADAM, Your most Humble, and most Devoted Servant, JAMES McMATH.
TO THE READER ESPECIALLY Bearing WOMEN AND Mid-wives. HAving much Observed, the manifold Mise∣ries and Tragical Disasters of Bearing Women, both during Pregnancy, the time of Labour, and in Child-bed: The grievous Calamities also of their tender Fruit, in the Womb, in Bearing also, and some while after: And how both are oft then miserably Lost, and haply through Mistakes and ill Guiding: I could not for∣bear (from my Love and Pity to both) to Write this small Manual (having more perfect Knowledge of the Matter, through a long Exercise, and diligent Observation of what hath then Well or Ill befallen them) for their better Government, and more hap∣py Preservation from these Evills; as containing Di∣rections to Women with Child, for steering the saf∣est Course to their Port: Instructions also to Mid-wifes (and by what appears, the Best needs daily be Learning, else they are so much too Proud, or
then too Wicked) for laying them with such Ease and Safety, as they may be joyful Moters of Chil∣dren: With such Rules beside of Dyet and Tending in Child-bed, as may make it Chearful and Short, give a happy Close and Issue thereof: And for right ordering of new-born Infants in Health. With Cures likewise for diverse Diseases of both. For, The Impregnat Woman, embarques upon a Voy∣age so long and perilous, through such rough and rocky Seas (that Sickness of 9 Months, which can more justly be called the cause of 600 or innumera∣ble Calamities, than the Womb it self) that she needs all careful Conduct, to save and recover her from these Rocks, upon which else, she either lyes miserably Split (especially if more britle and heavy Laden, whom the smallest Blast and Shake easily Shipwracks, sometimes most suddenly, yea, whiles also near the Harbor) or then made hence to cast her Birth untimely and Miscarry, a Case so very un∣happy to Women, as they had better Bear 10 times, than Part once, through these many hard and wrack∣ful Symptoms, usually accompany and ensue; in some to a languishing Decay and Death it self. But, The chief Concern and Care, is about her right Unloading or Delivery, that being brought safe to Port, she and the Child be well, with safety and con∣venient speed parted▪ As to which, it is most worthy of Remark, That the due season for a natural and happy Delivery (for the Wrong also and Unnatural, which must never wait longer, nor Floodings and Convul∣sions so long, requiring present dispatch) is the break∣ing of the right Waters, or these within the Bag with the Child: And tho all come not then, nor alike soon after, yet the longer after the worse, both Mother and Infant growing weaker, the way more dry and close, the Labour very hard, and both put in great
peril, through lack thereof; so notable is their use. to lubrify the Womb, smooth the Passage, and fa∣cilitate the Delivery: So necessar therefore to be expede, at least in some 6, 10, or 12 Hours after: And tho some have been longer after, ere Pains came, or yet the Mid-wife called: Yea, some have also been safely Dilivered, in a right Labour, 24 Hours after breaking of the Waters, 2 Days and longer, yet that is a Venture and great Hazard, especially of the Child, which hardly escapes. It is as necessar to know, that as this Natural La∣bour, where all goes right and naturally, is the pro∣per work of the Mid-wife, and which she alone most easily performs aright, being only to sit and attend Nature's pace and progress, receive the Child in her Lap, bring away the Burden, cut and tye the String, and perform some other things of smaller moment, which Physicians gave Mid-wifes to do, as unneces∣sar and indecent for them, and for the Matronal chastity (tho some of Old absurdly assigned them more, and made it also their Office, to help the De∣livery, and not by Medicaments only and Others. but Inchantments also) so in all Cases and Circum∣stances whatsomever, of Birth or After-Birth, that are Unnatural, Strange and Unusual, of any Diffi∣culty and Danger, she needs, and should timely crave, the Advice and Help of some Physician, skilled and expert in the Matter, where it may be had (for other∣wise she is obliged to do her best according to In∣structions herein given) and especially in all wrong postures whatsomever, with, or without Pains (tho Mid-wifes stands not at the Feet and Buttocks) all Convulsions and Floodings with Clods, tho little or no pain, whether at full Time or not: Most 1st. La∣bours, and chiefly of Old Virgins, or yet too Young: Labours also of these more Delicate, Tender, Feeble,
under any Indisposition, Disease or natural Weak∣ness: Yea, even where the Labour is right, but be∣comes lingering with slack pains, especially after the breaking (or yet a full gathering) of the Waters, and the Child not following in 6, 10 or 12 Hours after. Where also the Burden sticks, the String breaks, the Woman floods, or faints: And all other more grievous and painful Symptoms. As to the Mid-wife, she is surely the most glorious, who (beside that she be Diligent, Painful, Sober, Modest, Cleanly, not Wrathful, not Rash, Head-strong and Turbulent, not Covetous, not Arrogant and the rest excells in Prudence, Knowledgc, Skill and Dexterity in her Art, long Use and Exerclse: Experience withal of that condition in her self (and none of Old was admitted, till after they had Born many Children, yea had left Bearing, and become Barren, meerly through Age, and not by Nature or Disease, and then had much Authority and Deference) who so hath Eyes in her Head, and never, or most rarely Errs, in her Presage or Prognostick of the E∣vent or Success of Labour: And then either waits with Patience and Confidence, makes sure, cleanly and com∣fortable Work, or wisely forsees the Danger, the Cause and Occasion thereof, and timely provides a∣gainst it, by calling Advice and Help, in what she finds Hard and Infeasible; and the sooner the safer: Whence many sad Evils are prevented, and the Lives saved, which now are lost, through Ignorance and Timidity of some, but after a mischieful Boldness, Presumption & bad Example of Others, who through a vain conceit of Skill beyond all the rest, or any per∣son else, crave no Advice or Assistance, even in the hardest of Cases, and where the best may be had, but tugs on alone (a most pernicious practice) till they can do no more. and all run to a desperate Extremity.
that either Mother or Child, or both falls under their Hands, or then the Chirurgeon comes at length with his Instruments to finish the Tragedy, and puts both out of pine, and makes a separation, that the Infant may not be buried in its Mothers Womb: For thus it happens, that where the Man comes, one or both must necessarly die, for that he is not called, till the one or both be certainly dead or just dying, and still both pleads innocent: Which Abuses are prevented else where, by obliging Mid-wifes to a Tryal of their due Qualifications before they practise, where also they are called in question, yea and for their Lives, if thus guilty of any rash presumption. However let none discourage or blame such Mid-wifes, who re not slack to crave Advice in ticklish Cases, it being both Skill and Conscience, nor put them to do what they cannot, lest they thus pay for it, and epent too late, there being too many over bold, who arro∣gate and please themselves too much, ready to tam∣per with Lives, too much Wedded to their own In∣terest, and more nice of their imaginary Reputation, than Patients Welfare: Holding enough done for their part, if they work the Woman once two-some, well or ill, or get her through the Month, tho they use her so ill, as she lives miserably a long time after. But seing Women are now hereby so instructed, in the circumstances of a Travailing condition, may understand their Difficulty and Danger, and when their Case craves Advice, they need not be imposed upon by any, but must blame themselves for what Mischief and Wrong befals them for want hereof. Great need was there beside of Directions for a happy Child-bed, against the many acute Diseases, grievous Symptoms, Signs and others, readily seizes Women therein, as Fevers, Fluxes, Floodings, sup∣pression of the Cleansings, sore Breasts, and the rest
which rush in, partly after a sore unhappy Labour, partly through their own Imprudence and Rashness, partly also from unskilful Tending and Government: Some hid Mischance also, or Fatality sometimes atten∣ding: An unhappy Season likewise Whence many, who had happily past all perills of Pregnancy, been laid as comfortably as Heart could wish, yea been some while upon a fair Recovery, have yet suffered great Mutations, sad Back-casts and Languishing, yea Death oftimes. As necessar also was Advice and Directions, for preservation and welfare of New-born Infants: For obvious it is, that Man of all Living, is Born pollu∣ted and most miserable, feeble and infirm, quite helpless of himself, and who must quickly perish, without the Care and Aid of others, to order him right, affoord his Sustenance, and secure him against the manifold Ways and Means of his Ruine, which otherways soon carries him off: So great is the dan∣ger of Innocent Babes, and so much is their Health exposed. These Things being the Subject and End of this Treatise, it will be found of notable Use and Service to all Women, who are tender of their own, or others Safety and Comfort in this Condition: To all Mid-wifes also, or any else who puts hand to this Work, who if they act after the Instructions hereof, shall ever find praise and credit of the same: But more especially to these in the Countrey and far from bet∣ter Help, being hereby enabled, rightly to manage and prosper this Affair, and help to save themselves, when ill trysted, or made to serve with Mid-wifes who are none of the best. I have of purpose omitted a Description of the Parts in a Woman destined to Generation, not being absolutly necessar to this purpose, and lest it might
seem execrable to the more chast and shamefast, through Baudiness and Impurity of Words: And have here also endeavoured to keep all Modesty, and a due Reverence to Nature: Nor am I of the mind with some, as to think there is no Debauchery in the thing, except it may be in the abuse; for these parts, which even sinful Nature would be vailed, who may uncover by Word or Deed and be guiltless: For tho they have been created Marvellous and also Honest, yet are now become obscene with Sin: Whatever al∣lowance Physicians may still have, to speak or act in this Matter, whose sacred Right it is, to perlustrate any part of the Humane Frame, and cure the Mala∣dies thereof. Wherefore no body without a fault, can object this Subject as a fault, no part of Medi∣cine being more glorious and necessar. And the Best, yea most Sacred Things, may be, and have been most wickedly abused. I have studied beside, all plainness of Speech, and the most easy simple Wo∣manly Terms, and Words they could best under∣stand. I have not inserted the engraven Figures of the In∣fants in their various Postures, and some Others, ha∣ving especially so clearly represented all by word: Nor yet any Figures of the Instruments proper to this Art, of which the Ancients had great variety: For that albeit the use thereof hath universally hitherto prevailed, and that I have also shewn the best and se∣curest way of using the same in all Operations, yet they may, and ought to be abandoned, for their per∣nicious Effects upon both Women and Children: And tho some Physicians at London, have by industry attained to, and now keeps it as their horrible Se∣cret from all the World beside, to extract Children, or expede all difficult Deliveries without them; yet why not other knowing and industrious Physicians
also, whoply the Study and Improvement of this: Or ra∣ther Mid-wifes, by their Advice or Counsel, whose Hands are less terrible, more easie▪ adapted and expert: So that they seem continued from a dull Custom, to the sad Hurt and Ruine of many Women and Infants, more than any necessi∣ty: For even the Cases wherein they are held necessar, as a separated Head, a Dropsy of the Head, Breast, or Belly, or other monstrosity of a Child coming Right (for in wrong Postures they are not needed) most rarely ever occurr. not∣withstanding of their so frequent use. I have not troubled the Reader with the Formality of ma∣ny long Receipts, which soon swell a Book, and make it less portible: But have mentioned the chief Medical provi∣sion only, or the most proper, safe and effectual Medica∣ments; the Prescription being easy and safe, or the Quanti∣ty, Quality, Time, and Manner of Using, while the Tempe∣rament of a Patient and the Disease is clear; so that chiefly they fit their Case and Constitution, and please the Pallate. Beside that a right Dyet, or good Guiding, does best for such Patients. And all Difficulties needs Physicans. For brevity also and fear of Offence, I have forborn the Account might have been given, of several Catastrophe's hath befallen Bearing Women in this place, for several Years past, how the Tragedies were acted, the Actors also, and upon whom: But considering wirhal, that too much of any Stock was not to be put in one Bottom, these and some others I choosed to deferr, haply for another opportunity. And now to conclude, let me Admonish and Exhort all Mid-wifes, to know and keep by their proper Work: And study a prudent, wary and religious Performance thereof, acting in their Office so advisedly and surely, as no Evil may hap∣pen through them: But that by a right presage and progno∣stick of the Event, the most worthy and admirable part of their Art, and as it were next to Divination, they may pre∣serve entire, the Dignity of their Name and Office, so an∣cient and venerable: And by the Deed and Work it self, de∣monstrate that they are truly Intelligent, and Conscientious also, preferring their Patients Welfare to all: Omitting no∣thing makes thereto: And chiefly in every Difficulty and Danger, they timely call the Advice and Assistance of Phy∣sicians (for rarely will one Mid-wife communicate here with another, the Case also being of huge danger, and Lives in the play, requires greatest prudence and government) a more accomplisht and industrious Society whereof for all Cases cannot be had nor desired than is upon the plce:
And so may prove such wise Pils, who merits far greater Praise, by saving their Passengers in a vehement Storm and manifest peril of Perdion, than plucking them out of the raging Waves, having now suffered a most dangerous Ship∣wrak. Neither can Mid-wifes take this sincere Admoni∣tion ill, nor hold themselves, or the Office any ways hereby disparaged, the Faults and Errors only being blamed, and these more dangerous, which they that fear God and are in∣genuous will see to and amend, and such who are otherwise minded and persist, ought to be avoided by all who mind the preservation and welfare of themselves and their Babes. Farewel, JAMES McMATH. One thing I must subjoin as to the Title of Doctor I as∣sume, lest I be thought impudently and falsely to arrogate it to my self, having appeared so long in a subordinate sta. tion, that however so lately declared, yet I rightly and law∣fully obtained the Degree of Doctor-ship, and the most No∣ble Honours and Priviledges in Medicine, with a Patent also in publick Testimony & Assureance thereof, at the University of Rhems in April 1677, and that after a considerable time spent in sedulous Labour and Studies ar Leyden, and a much longer after at Paris; beside an Apprentis-ship first of all in Chirurgery and Pharmacy: And tho for a good many Years after my Return, I traded with Drugs and the Apothecars Shop, yet that could be no disparagement nor prejudice thereto, but for a greater Improvement and Experience, and for a safer Practice, having so long withal made proof of Receipts, from most Physicians in the place. So that whatever I may lake of Ingine, good Luck, or Fortune in the Matter, I come nothing behind for Diligence and Industty.
This also I had reason  add. anent the Imputation of Papist, some unprofitable Scyba of the Rable kind (who cruelly envy my Vertue and Prosperity) have maliciously laid upon me, industriously insinuated, and made to pass with the more credulous silly people, to make me suffer, that as I have served Patients of all sorts, so some Papists also, and tho none of greater Humanity, Candor and Generosity; yet I cn Swear (and upon peril of all if falsly) rhat never one of them hitherto thought me a Papist, and never found any thing like it in me, nor ever had me present in any place, or at the least Act of Religious Service Worship, or Devotion (save Grace at Mear, for I have eaten with them) nay never fell to speak of Religion, but in a biggot opposition; which may confound that Aspersion, and shew it is of the Devil.
The First BOOK: Of Various Diseases and Indispositions of Wo∣men with Child, from Their Conception to the full Term of Labour. WE mind not here a tedious Treatise, of all the mise∣rable Maladies arises in Women from their Womb, to wit, as Virgins, Barren, or Fruitful through Con∣gress; But only, the Principal of these, more incident to the Fertile (far more excellent, and the Blessed among Women) in their Breed∣ing, Bearing, and Lying in: Which accord∣ingly
Indicates some Speciality in the Cure, and shall be expede, with all possible bre∣vity. Before we begin at Womens Breeding, or Conception, it is fit to treat a little of their Fertility, and Sterility, or Fitness, and Incapacity for it; being by them mostly made, or marred: As obliged to af∣ford (beside a joynt proportion of good Seed to the mans, which is all sought of him) a right disposed Womb, as good ground, where both must be Conserved, warmly Cherished, and altered, into an Infant or Bud: With what else is requisite to its Increment, and Maturity: Hence the vile Imputation of Barrenness, rests almost, solely upon them. CHAP. I. Of the Fertility and Steri∣lity of Women. BY that is meant their Aptitude to Engen∣der by Congress: by this, their Incapaci∣ty from any default whatsomever. The
prime Signs, or Conditions reckoned to Fruitfulness, are a right Frame and Confor∣mation of the Womb, with all its Parts and Pendicles, the due Disposition, and Tempe∣rature thereof (as also of the whole, seeing none but the Sound, and Healthy should Marry) a Just Age withall, made com∣monly, from 12, or 14 years to 50: Better from 18, or 20, to 40, or 45. Or rather during the Monthly Courses (called there∣fore their Flowers, as Indicating Fruitfulness) which as they have a gradual encrease with the Age to a Stans, and a like decrease till they cease, so their prime time is held the prime for Marriage, for plenty of most Vi∣gorous and Elegant Children; securest from A∣bortion, from Difficult or Deadly Labour. Yet some are found Fertile before Courses, and o∣thers who never saw any: whence some deny them to be any Sign, or Cause of Fecundity, or special Provision of Nature, more than other things: Or yet to nourish the In∣fant. The Blood of the Courses they make good, and laudable (though many have believed it Venemous, and the Infant con∣ceived at that time badly Constitute, and to die soon: Yea have attributed Monstruous
Effects to its touch and Vapour: Making Cocatrices of Women, dispersing their Poi∣son through the Air like them) alike almost with the rest in the whole Body, and (when right) of a florid bright colour, and smel∣ling like Marigolds: Which yet haply ever recedes from its Natural State, during that Menstruous Fermentation, differing much, from what is before, and after, and gets whiles also a most noisom Smell, from a mixture of Putrid Humours, its too long Stagnation, or then the Taint of the Pass, whence any Malignity it hath. Its Evacuation beside must be Regular, breaking out once a Month, and mostly a∣bout the presence of the Moon, (which some make the Cause of this Periodick ap∣pearance, as others the Providence of Nature, a Plethory, or Fermentation from an Occult Quality) whence its name of Lunatick Disease, both in young Virgins, and elder Women: And likely when fuller, all things being then more turgid: yet the Ancients held the new Moon to purge Virgins, the old, the more aged mostly, but some of both purge every day indifferently, It must then also continue (distilling from the Womb by drops, or leasure∣ly,
without interruption) for two or three dayes mostly, yet whiles four, in some also six, yea in some even to the eighth: though yet this Evacuation may, and does return ofter, or more seldom: continue thus, longer, or shorter time: Vent in less or larger Dose: Break out also, and end differently: for the different Climate, Temperament, Dyet, Exereise and the like. But enough of this for the purpose in hand. The Vent of Perfumes up through the Womb, to the Mouth and Nostrils, is made a sure Sign of Fecundity: And shews a right Disposition of these Parts, and their due Commerce with the Head, by Nerves and Animal Spirits. Hence, Sterility must proceed, from a vicious Conformation (or the Organick Faults) of the Genitals; as the Astriction, Obstruction, Co∣alescence, total or partial Closure of the Sheath, or inner Orifice, by any Viscid Hu∣mour, Tumor, Excrescence, Erosion, Cal∣losity, Cicatrice, Membrane and the like: Their Obliquity also, Distortion, Compres∣sion, or what else marrs the free and thorough Perforation of the Yard, and direct Evibration of the Seed into the Cavity of the Womb.
From their Intemperature also, as when too Hot and Dry, but chiefly too Cold and Moist, in a Soft, Lax, Pituituous Constitution of the whole Body, by Nature, or any wise adventitious. In Cacochymick, Pituitous, Serous Diseases also: Spaits of Whites, or other Filth, discharged therein, as the common Sink of the Body (so oft observed with Barrenness, and the most frequent cause thereof) which does so Moisten, Re∣lax, and Lubrify its Inner Orifice, that it cannot retain the injected Seed, or (being irritated by the annoyance of such Stuff) must quickly open, and let all pass. The like happens, when the Womb is Infirm, Soft, Lax in its Natural Constitution, or rendered so by a too lavage use, Abortion, or painful Labour. Sterility arises moreover, from an uni∣versal Intemperature, as in Hydropick, Le∣prous, Hectick, Pocky, Scrofulous, and o∣thers the like Cachectick, Plagueful, Ruinous Constitutions, and so much the rather, as the more noble Parts are Impressed, and Vitiated. By one, or other of these, are some long time made Barren, who at length Bear: The Fault being mended, the Impediment
removed, a finer Health and Temperament recovered; by Age, a better Government, and other Industry: though it were the In∣terest of a Common-wealth, men did re∣frain such Matches, or any else, seen other∣wise notably Faultish: Whence comes no Off-spring, or such as is very Worthless, Crooked, Dwarfish, Feeble, Sickly, unfit for all use, and service. But the Love of Money is the root of all Evil. Sterility happens likewise, from the Wo∣mans Disgust, and Satiety of the Venereal Embrace; or her dulness, and insensibility therein: Whence the Orifice bides shut a∣gainst the Yard: Which else (while eager upon it, strenuously and naturally Tickled, and Rou∣sed therein) applyes to it, delightfully opens, and raveningly attracts the mans Seed (which is then sufficiently darted into the Recesses of the Womb) emits also her own: Whence Con∣ception readily follows long Abstinence, in case the charges be not doubled. These are held the prime Natural Causes of Womens Barrenness, for of Divine we speak not (which yet may haply oft times take place) nor yet of Diabolick, or other hid Causes. The Cure lyes in removing these Causes,
as every Obstruction of the entry chiefly: and thus separation, or apertion is to be made of any Coalescence or Closure of the Genitals, (outward or inward) by Incision, Potential Cauters, or Corrosives: The Wound after kept open with Tents armed with Ci∣catrizing Medicines. The Tumors in these parts must be resol∣ved, and discussed: Or else suppurated, and dressed, according to their nature, and Situation: Chiefly careful against Cor∣ruption, or Cancer may readily ensue there∣upon. If the Sheath happen naturally more strait, a Blade would be matched accordingly; (for some are more big, such, men of lesser Stature are said to have, as these with a big Nose, well hained, the Dull, Stupid, Fatu∣ous;) means may also be used for its dilata∣tion: But this proves rare, only in young Girles, and they enlarge in time; or these of small Stature, bad Conformation; Or the El∣der, and is incurable: otherwise the Geni∣tils conforms to any Yard. The Compression, Distortion, Obliquity, or Dislocation of the parts, can only be helped, by the Womans apt Posture in the Congress. The natural Laxity of the Womb, is
Cured by Medicines gently Astringent, Aromatick, and Warming (chiefly extern, in any Form) as is that also, from excess of Venery, returning withall by degrees to a Moderation. When its Laxity and Softness arises from a Pituitous, Cacochymick, (or otherwise de∣praved) Constitution of the Body, there must be Evacuations, Purgations (as well for the whole Body as these parts) with a pro∣per Regimen, and what Remedies else are effectual, to alter, correct and quite root out that Dyscrasy or Intemperature. The other Indispositions also, Causes and Impediments, must likewise be applyed to for amendment, or removal: And accord∣ing to their different Natures, and Indica∣tions, and to all due Intentions: Still adding the Ʋterin Medicines. CHAP. II. Of Conception. IT follows Fertility upon Venerial Embrace of Man and Woman, the Emission, or Immission, and special Commixture, of both
their Seeds, into the Womb (although some instance Conceptions without it) whence springs the same in Kind, which holds with Intemperature, and Defect of Nature. That the Woman hath Seed (though much controverted with some the Learnedst Physicians, and Philosophers, who allow her neither a liquid Seed nor the Egg, but would have her as the Field only, into which the Mans Seed is committed, and takes growth: Just as the Plants and Herbs) is clear from her Testicles, Seminary Vessels, and Organs, every way framed, and fitly disposed, for preparing thereof. From the Fellowship also, of the Womb, and Spermatick parts, with the other principal parts of the Body, by Nerves, Arteries, Veins, whence is brought plenty of Seminal matter (Confluences also, and Combinations of the Spirits) and stored up in these Vessels: And found also elaborate into a white Liquor, or Seed in their Testicles: and which they feel emitted in Coition, with a most pleasureful Tickle and Delight (for the most part more then Men) haply even in the first Congress (scarce without some Annoyance) and without which no Wo∣man could ever Conceive, whatever some pretend of being forced, and made with
Child, without any Oblectation or discharge of Seed: beside that gelded Female Bruits (for it were ugly and Cruel, to Geld Wo∣men which some are said to have done) are ever incapable of Conception. Women get moreover, the very same Symptoms with men, after Coition, as Sadness, Lassitude, trouble of Sight, Dulness, Submission, Sa∣tiety, or Cessation of Lust, and the rest. There is added, the express Image of some Mothers in their Infants (which yet some make to depend solely from the Imagination) a mixture beside of Members from both the Males and Females, where diverse Kinds Copulate: the Scripture also speaks of the Womans Seed as a thing chiefly necessar to Generation. The Mans Seed likely, far excels in active Principles, Vertue, and Force of Pro∣creation; being far finer, and more Spiri∣tuous: as appears from its more perfect Elaboration, more powerful Ejaculation, brighter Colour, a more vehement Action, Emission, and Discharge: The mans war∣mer and most Vivace Constitution. From Commixtures however of both Seeds (justly coapted in Quality and Quan∣tity, warmly Bedded in a well disposed
Womb, closely Conserved and Cherished there∣in) arises a most noble Fecundity, excellent Crasis and Contemperation into one Spirituous Body, (the too great Aquosity, and cold∣ness of the Womans, being excellently com∣pensed, by the too great heat and Spirituo∣sity of the Mans) towards Prolification and Efformation of an happy Embryo (chiefly a Male) the marvellous Structure of so many parts, and consummate Habitation of the Soul: And that partly, by means of the innate Warmth, and Spirits (the Animal be∣fore others, the far more Noble and Nume∣rous whence the Seed is chiefly Foecundat) and partly by the benign dewy Warmth, Moisture, and vivid Ferment of the Womb: Partly also, by the adventitious, irradiant, or Influent Spirits, like the warm Rayes of Heaven; whereby the Ferment of the Womb, is far more Vigorously exalted. There are (beside this true Conception) Aequivocations of the Womb, False and Monstruous Conceptions, as Wind, (which some have discharged copiously from the Womb with marvellous noise after a full reckoning, and some time of Travel, and sharp Pains, in great expectation and appearance also of a Child, and no small work about the Delive∣ry)
store also of Water, whiles mixture of both, (called Dropsies of the Womb) bags full of Corrupt Matter, Moles, Fishes, Mice, Frogs, Worms, Brute Animals, and other Monstruous and Anomolous Brood conceived and enclosed in the Womb: Varioùs Examples of which are found with Physitians, Writers of Observati∣tions, here and there also with Historians. Among these comes Natures Transgressions, or By-works, which are either Monsters in sex, as Hermophradites: Or in Conforma∣tion, and that either as to Figure, having the Face of a Dog, Ape, Swine; or ill set Parts, as when the Eyes are in the middle front, the Ears behind, the Nostrils on the side: and in Number Redundant, as double Bodies, Hands, Arms, Feet, Fingers, 6, 7, three Testicles (to which may be added the plenteous Number of Births at once) Or then Deficient, wanting Arms, Fingers, Feet, Nose, Tongue, Ears, or other Mem∣bers: Yea, a Marvel, but the Birth shall be pitifully overgone, with one or other He∣reditary Disease, and that either as to its Similar Constitution, and Intemperature, Scor∣butick, Scrofulous, Goutish, Hectick, Cachectick, and the like (which some impute to Co∣pulation the time of the Courses) or its
Organick, and Conformation: the Deaf, Dumb, Blind, Mutilous, produceing the like, (though such must also have been born so, else they beget Children perfect as others) all which proceeds according to Causes, and Principles of Nature (heologues hold them remarkable Instances of Divine Vengance, or Manifestati∣ons of the Works of God) partly, from a Vicious seminal Matter, Or, the Ineptitude, In∣sufficiency, and Imperfection, of its Particles, Principles, Spirits, Vertues; an injust Pro∣portion also, bad Figuration, incongruous Adaptation, or Disposure: and partly from a bad Disposition of the Womb, the Apposition of depraved Impure Juyces, Courses, Whites, or other vile Excrements; whereby the Ge∣niture is altered, and spoiled, the true Conception marred, or then (in place of Nu∣trition, or Food of Life) the Embryo receives the aliment of its Intemperature, Monstrosity, and Ruine: Partly likewise (and principal∣ly) from the Ineptitude, Defect, or Excess, Inordination and Errata's of the Influent, or Animal Spirits: through the Irradiations al∣so of which, their inusual Emotions, and Determinations, from Mothers most strong Imaginations (which works wonders in them, not only at the moment of Conception, but
after when big, yea not long before the Labour) the Impressive force is made highly conspicuous, marvelously altering the Infant (now already formed) and mark∣ing upon it, (as it were Wax) this and the other Form, Figure or Sculpture (blemishes also or Spots) as of Figs, Straw-Berries, Cherries (in their proper, and vive Colours, yea flourishing in their Seasons) or other things she tossed in her mind, vehemently greened for, and obtained in her Fancy only; the Idaa's, or Representations, being assumed by a greedy Fancy, or Imagination, exactly re∣presented in the Brain, and impressed upon the Animal Spirits, and Arterious Blood, and therewith convoyed to the Womb, and upon the Young, and directed on in the Circulation toward this, or that particular part (yea the very same part of it was touched in the Mother with any thing) which being ten∣der and soft, easily receives: And should make big Women wary of entertaining, or musing more deeply, such Imaginations, or fixedly beholding ugly Pictures, Images, Monstruous, or Frightful things, either with pleasure or abomination, the time of Con∣ception, or Gravidation: Whence Whites are said to have born Blacks: some entire Parents
also Mutilous Children: yea some, horrid Monsters. CHAP. III. Signs of Conception. ASsurance of Conception from the begin∣nig, though necessar, is hard, be∣caue of the different Conditions, both of one Woman in this Case from another, and of the same Woman at different times: The likeness also, of many of the Signs, to these may attend the Simple Suppression of the Courses, and some their other maladies: whence the boldest guessers are oft times most shamefully mistaken, who made them∣selves and others full sure of the matter. We shall however recite the Signs held most Es∣sential, and Common: some whereof may be presently perceived, and while the Conception is in making; others, some while after, and when it is already made: Which (if they concur in the Woman, and succeed to o∣thers accordingly in order, after Congress, and with the Signs of Fertility) readily holds. As her great Itch and Lust to Coition
her most grateful and Voluptuous Tickle therein, without which Women does not so readily and easily conceive: A light Shive∣ring of the Body after, as after Pissing: retention of the Geniture: And this ever gave all Bearing Women who observed it a certainty of their Conception, and ever also the exact time, while they felt their Ge∣nitals dry after Congress, and nothing flow from them: Whence also such never missed of their Reckoning, who otherwise compu∣ting from the first stop of their Courses, have gone very far wrong. There is beside, a close firm Connivance, (though others speak of some light one only) and most exact closure of the inner Orifice, at least the first Months. There is also, a Constriction, or solid Contraction of the Womb (to the same Constitution almost as when empty) for a near, and most close Comprehension, and warm Embracure of the Geniture: whence is felt a kind of Contraction, like a Convulsive motion, or Cramp in the Vulvâ, and bottom of the Belly, with a pain hereof when pressed: a starting also of the Navel There succeeds (instantly also in some) various Vexing Symptoms (more gentle whiles at the first, sorer afterwards, when the Con∣ception
likely hath taken a Seat in the Womb) as great Litherness, Hebetude and Drousiness, Heart-burnings, Yexings, Belchings, Yaunings, Reachings, long Spittings, Vomitings long time, sorest in the Morning: She turns Duamish, loses her Appetite, Cares not for Venery, Nauseats and abhors some particular Meats she loved, Greens for things strange, absurd, and noxious: Takes Tooth-ach, Head-ach, Giddiness, Dimness of Sight, Pains in the roots of her Eyes, Palpitations of the Heart, Swoonings (yea some have Convulsions, Epi∣lepsies, Ravings) her Courses also stop, which before were orderly: Her Breasts extube∣rate, turn hard and painful (chiefly about the return of her Courses) the Niples are very dark coloured, more large and tumid, the Circle Brownish: She hath pains in her Loyns and Thighs; her Belly flatts, she becomes slender, thin, of an ugly Complexion, a lean Ghastly Visage, all Mouth and Eyes: Turns Blea beneath the Eyes, which are Hollow, Turbid, and Dull, with large Yellowish Whites, the Veins very spectable, (chiefly un∣der the inferior Eye-lid) And other Ca∣chectick like Symptoms, which yet likely must befall the Cacochymick mostly, the more de∣licate, or these of a more Inordinate Dyet:
Being hard if Nature should allow no big Women her Health, which she hath not denyed to the very Beasts: And some have that their most Healthful time. Some take a sure Signe from an unusual wratkfulness, fa∣miliar to them at that time, and their mar∣velous proclivity to Anger. No Signe or conjecture can be had from Ʋrins however constitute; sith that, they touch not the parts which serve to Generation, nor hath any Communion with them; though some glory not a little in this, whom yet Expe∣rience does shamefully confound. Many o∣ther Signs and Experiments are brought but seem vain and fabulous. Great Prudence, and Caution is necessar to such Prognosticks, for many Abortions have been procured, Women and Infants have suf∣fered through Mistakes and Rashness; espe∣cially in drugging the Belly big with Child, as if Hydropick, Tumid through Stagnating Courses, or otherwise False: Nor must Wo∣men be still trusted in the matter, some being Feigned and False; many very uncertain. The distinctive Signs of Conception, and sup∣pressed Courses are, that here (otherwise then with the Conception) the longer they stop, the worse dayly grows the Symptoms: The
Women most part are Sad, and Pensive: Of a far worse Complexion: The Tumor also is Soft, Oedomatous, Equal; and hath not In∣fant-like Situation, Circumscription, or any Motion: Neither feels the inner Orifice so exactly shut, but rather hard, contracted, and some wise painful. CHAP. IV. Of the Infants Formation. NAture greedy of Immortality, hath given all things a desire, and power to per∣petuate themselves, which they effect in Propagation of Kinds, and Forms, (Indivi∣duals quickly perishing) and perfect Ani∣mals, by an uninterrupted Series of succeed∣ing Generations. Although this be a marter of most hard Explication, so that our great Creator seems to have reserved this Mystery to himself a∣lone, and would not, proud man should dive into the most small beginnings of his work: Yet we shall briefly Narrat, what Authors (who Studies anent the Principles of this Noble Fabrick) have delivered as agree∣ing to Truth.
To the Generation of Mankind (here only intended) Diversity of Sex is held necessar: A Male who (being of most Vivace Consti∣tution, and more accurate Fabrick of Vessels) gives the Principal (if not the Sole) Impression, and Efficiency: Or Plastick Force and Vertue. And Female, who affords a well disposed Faecund Womb, for a safe warm Conservation, and Cherish of both their Prolifick Seeds, into a Bud: Due Nutriment also unto Maturity. Their Genial Embrace is likewise necessar, or a truly Venereous Congress: To which they haste, from this Love of their Like (some from Plenty and Stimulation of Seed, an unsatiable Sting also of Lust) but chiefly, from that signal Delite, and enchanting Pleasure found therein; some Solace of Mi∣series (though empty and moment any, Sad∣ness and Drouping coming instantly after, yea even during the Pleasure of this Dance) without which scarce one would ever use it, and Mankind would soon wear out: For else how could man, so noble a Crea∣ture, make any attrectation of these Obscoene parts, which (for being so Foulsome, are turn∣ed down into the Vilest Room, in a manner the Sink of the Body) much less court, ac∣cept, or indulge to this Embrace, so filthy
a Fact; some even to a sad decay and waste. What Woman also, would else impair her Health, Strength, Ease, Beauty, undergo a world of Miseries (yea even lose the Life) in Breeding, Bearing and bringing up of Chil∣dren, if not bewitched to this incredible pleasure excited in Coition from the most ex∣quisite Sense and Tickle affects the Genitals. They will have also, both Seeds present in the Womb, as the Generant Prolifick Principles, their fit mixture into one Mass: From which Fermented together, arises a Spirituous Bud, through which and of which is the Delineation of all, both being endued with a Plastick Vertue, or formative Force; made the Vegetative Spirit of the Seed, the Vital or Vegetant Mortal Soul, which imparts Or∣der, Efformation, Figures, Situation, Num∣ber, and Quantity to the little Membranes and Members of the Embryo by means (as is said before) of the Congeneous Par∣ticles of the Seed, (things of the same kind being sorted, disposed, and ordered from these of a different) the well tempered, Im∣planted Spirits abounding therein: The In∣fluent also and Imagination: the Congenit Heat and Ferment of the Womb: The Divine Hand concurring.
Some make the Mans Seed alone, the first, and immediate Matter, and sole Effi∣cient of the Work: The Womans, a Ferment only, necessar for its Colliquation and Disso∣lution; for Eductìon also, of the Finest, most Subtile, and Spirituous part, and Coagula∣tion hereof into a most clear Buble, like Crystal Liquor (which it also Cherishes, as a convenient prepared Warm Moisture about it) containing the Idaea's of all the Parts, in which alone, the first Efformation of the whole Infant is begun, and of which the most fine, tender, and small Threads of all its Members are delineated and quickly also expede, the several Apitudes, Powers and Faculties reposed herein, being now thus extricate or set loose, and so instantly pro∣moved in Act for Figuring, or Conforming the Parts, and arraying the same with all kind of Perfection: which is nourished at first, grows in bigness, and amplifies by the resi∣due of the Seminal Matter about it: And after Consumption hereof with Blood and Chyl, flowing copiously thither, of which afterwards. Others say just Contrariwise to this, and makes the Womans Seed the first Matter, and sole Effective Principle of the Infant: Yet injustly, being the less perfect,
yea doubted by many if it can well, and truly be called Seed, and Infants therefore commonly never Named from the Mother. Some reject this Plastick Force, or Soul of the Seed, and will have the Formation of the Infant caused, through the heat, both of the Womb, and Seeds; whereby the Parti∣cles hereof, being gently agitated, and mov∣ed in the Womb, for their diverse Magnitudes, and Figures, necessarily turns into the per∣fect Bud of an Infant; all the Parts whereof they will have conformed and finished by little and little, and all things done in the Body in a Mechanick manner, without any Idaea, Phantasy, or Archaeus of a Soul, or other Faculty. But this Glorious Fabrick, is of a more Regular, Constant and Cunning Arti∣fice then all this can come to. Some, will not have ought of the Seed enter the Womb in Coition, or then to flow all soon out again, or some way evanish: Yet the Generation to hold (the Genitor's, Idaea, or Species remaining only in the Womb, to the sole Contagion of which it is ascribed) and so to be unnecessar, and quite useless thereto; making the Womb the Principal Cause of the Formation, while (by means of the Formative Faculty as its Instrument) it
Impresses upon its Work the Species conceiv∣ed by it. And these will have the Conception made, not so much in the Cavity of the Womb, as in the Pores of its inner Mem∣branes: And by reception of an Immaterial Species: Giving the Woman thus to do more then the Man, in propogating the Kind. Some of late make Women have Eggs bred in their Testicles, and will have the Genera∣tion of man constitute at first of the same, laid into the Womb, and on the same wise usual in Hens and other Fouls, and Oviparous Ani∣mals; and the Spirit of the Mans Seed, to be the true Efficient, and Formator: Some part whereof arrives at the Testicles, and Egg-Bed and Faecundats the Egg: But there coming no Prerogative from the Egg, this their Observation is of no worth: Being uncertain beside, whether it be made in the Egg-Bed, or wrought in the Womb by Fer∣mentation: The Womb being the same in Women what the Egg-Bed is in Fouls. But to be short, The order of the Infants Efformation is re∣duced to four Seasons. In the first, nothing appears, save the Seeds coagulate within a thin Crust or Membrane: till the 7th. day. In the 2d. this Mass becomes clearly as it
were more Fleshy, and Conglobat; in nine dayes: And may be discerned in three little Gutts, and Globes, or several little Bladders; called the shineing Bubles: Held to be the Rudiments of the principal Parts, or a Repre∣sentation of the Natural Animal, and Vital Constitutions. Yet some will have but one only Buble alwayes, of which the whole In∣fant is formed: Most rarely more, except where more Children are to be formed toge∣ther. In the 3d. is the Embryo: And this Time the Threads, or first rude Draughts of all the Spermatick parts brightly appear in the Liquor: From the 15 day to the 27. when the Heart like a little point, the Bowels, the Parenchymata, little Bones, Joynts, Back∣bone may be plainly perceived: The Mem∣branes covering the Brain, and the rest of the Body like the Keel of a Ship, and the Ribs standing up, (yea the two Membranes en∣wraps it) And seems to be Delineat, or Portrayed equally at once (so great, and so necessar being the Harmony thereof, that they cannot Subsist, nor Act but together) though some will have its Heart first formed, some its Liver, others the Brain: Some these three together, and after the Intestins, Lungs, and the rest. Some will have the
Bones first, the Basis as it were, and ne∣cessar Ground-work of the Body. But how each part is produced, and one after another, what first, what last, (and all so right, and in such trim order) God only knows who Created all things in the beginning, first and alone; whose marvellous Skill in this Curious Cut of the Infant (these fair Draughts also, and Frames of Nature, never enough to be ad∣mired) though diligently sought out, yet never will to Perfection. In the last, to the 45 day, all joyntly grows together into a compleat Child, an entire perfect System of the whole, and so many parts (though yet very small and tender, made not longer then a Finger, and little bigger than a larger Em∣mot) in their pretty Figure, most convenient tye, Marvellous Structure, extream (yet whol∣ly concording) Diversity of Functions and Ʋses; finished and trimmed up by the most Skilful Hands of our great Creator (much like the Painter, who first draws the Lines, then layes his Colours: Or the Carpenter, who first founds the Keel of his Ship, then raises the Sides, and Stern almost covered) remain∣ing a consummat Domicil for the Rational Soul, which is believed to be Created (though some make it Traduced of the Seed, and Propoga∣ted
by Generation, no less then the Body it self) and infused thereinto (the fit Time and Minute none knows exactly, but God alone its Creator) by which the Motions of the Corporeal Soul, are thenceforth determined, ruled and tempered: And all the Constitu∣tions, Concoctions and Elaborations of the Body, fixed as by Gods own Hand, and doing. All these being rightly considered, we must grant so much, Wisdom to Shine in this work of Generation, or Frame of the Em∣bryo, And all the Fabricks, Families, Fa∣culties, Elaborations. and Actions of the In∣fant to be so Divine, as must very far surpass the Power, and Vertue not only of the Seed, but haply even of any Soul: And can speak no less, nor be fitly applyed to ought else, save the Finger of God, or Divine Power, the first Efficient Cause of all things, per∣fective as it were of the Plastick Faculty, and and others ascribed to the Seed, Nature's Operation, or the Parents to whom very little is due on this head, who produce only a certain bulk, consisting of Flesh, Bones, Membranes, Nerves, and the rest disposed and figured in a certain manner, but give nothing to the Production of the Soul; nay nor to its union with the Body.
CHAP. V. Of a True, and False big Belly, and their Signs. THe one is caused by a Child in the Womb; the Other by some Empty, marred, or Monstruous Conception therein, beguiling the Woman, and the World about: Happening mostly (say some) through disorders of the Courses, and the time chiefly they usually turn so, to wit, from 35 years to 40. and forwards. The sure Signs of the True, are the right Closure of the inner Orifice, its just Bigness according to the time, an Infant like Situa∣tion (which acuminates towards the Navel, and is Lank on each side: While the False rises equally and plain all over) and Cir∣cumscription with the Womb: But chiefly right Stir, and Motion: True Milk also in the Breasts at the usual Season, or time of Life. The Infant Lives and Moves manifestly in the 3d. or 4th. Month mostly, some much sooner, others far later (scarce in the 5th.) as they have been more, or less Mirrily
Begotten, are more or less Strong, Vigorous, or Spirity, the Females, as soon as Males, (though some will have these later in Anima∣tion, and Motion, as also in Formation: Who yet come alike perfect, and mature to the usual Term, and are observed to wax faster when Born, yea to flourish faster, and fail also in Age: Chiefly they who have Born ofter: And some have also found them stir soonest. Its Motions at first, are found very Small, Soft, Easie, yet still encrease, and sharpen with its Bigness, and Strength, till in end they be so Hard, and Painful, as to irritate the Womb to open, and work hard its Pro∣trusion: Being ready else, to break at the Broad-side. It removes whiles its whole Body from one part of the Womb to another, and whiles Sprauls out this, or its other part only, Swiming and Tumbling lightly in the Waters as in a Bath; yet without turning over and over as some Women fancy. In the Hysterick Passion, the Womb is said to ascend, to move it self, and range every way through the the lower Belly, making thus a sort of Total, yet no Partial Motion: But these In∣flations, and Motions are ever very painful,
with Suffocation (yea in some Convulsive) and said to proceed from irritation of some Ma∣lignant sharp Vapor arises from the Womb (which some deny can make any such Spon∣taneous Motion) or her Testicles whence, the the Intestins are contracted (the Midriff, also, Muscles of the Jaws, and other parts, if it ascend higher) and this Evil produced, while thus bitten and pricked thereby. The Mole moves only with the Womb, falling with Weight, and Pain, upon the Side the Woman turn to. Agitated Waters, makes a Bubling and Murmur in the Womb. Wind in the Womb makes Motions, most like these of the Infant, and may long resemble a true Gra∣vidation: Which yet must oft make greater Distention, Hardness and Pain. When she is over half gone, that the Infant stirs more vive, the Paps begin to swell (very oft and for the most part) and more and more augment, from Milk rising therein, which may be pressed, out first a more Waterish, after a Thicker, usually a most certain Sign of a true Belly as the want thereof of a Mole, (which, as it hath no Animal Life, receives no Animal or Milky Aliment) the Infants Commotion exciting great desire and thought of its Lactation: And though Lascivious Vir∣gins,
and Widows wholly intent to Lustful Cogitations, and much in thinking of Breasts, Milk, and their Sucking, wantonly rubbing, tickling, or Sucking thereof, may have got Milk in them (yea thus some men also) especially with a Suppression of Courses, yet that is most rare, and it is but a Crude Ichorous sort of Milk, or rather a Serous Milky like Liquor, or Humour. At that time the Circle of the Niples amplify, the Niples also before contracted, become now laxer and more tumid. It is of great import to discern the False big Belly from a True (though hard, the Symp∣toms being usually so like in both) for this must be industruously cherished, corrobo∣rated and preserved to a full time, the other indicates a speedy Expulsion: For the longer false Conceptions are in the Womb, a fuller Nourishment they receive, and bigger still they grow, more solid and fleshy: Sticks also more fast, and so worse to be expelled: Raising then almost ever perilous Floodings and after two Months turn sit-fast Moles.
CHAP. VI. How to know the different Times, and a true Term of Pregnancy. AS it is fit to know a Woman is truly Conceived, so also how for she is gone; for if she be made to Miscarry, or her Fruit made go from her, while only a new Conceived Embryo, the punishment must be lighter, then after its Perfect Orga∣nization, when ready trimmed for the Soul, the Inspiration of which makes it all Justice and Equity, that Life go for Life without re∣spect of Persons. Hereby also is understood when Pains come at full time, and to be urged on, or arrive before, and must ever by all means then be appeased, and the La∣bour hindered; except in Vehement Floodings, Convulsions, and other Desperate Cases where a speedy Delivery is the only Hope. Some compute from Stop of their Courses, or the Quickning, which yet are Ʋncertain and Vary, Others judge it by the Bigness, but this fails also, caused greater at sometimes by
half then at others.. In the Beginning, it is tryed by the abovesaid Signs of Conception. Some make it best known by the different Constitution of the Inner-Orifice in the Preg∣nancy, which from the Beginning, or in the the first Months, feels somewhat long, and transverse like the hole in the top of the Yard, or the Muzzle of a Puppy new Pupped, most strait, and closely conjoyned, hard also and Dense, especially in the first Child, tho' in in these who have born ofter, it is more big and Inaequal. In her hindmost Months, this Orifice turns Soft, and Pulpy, more Lax also and Tumid (as are the Lips of the Privi∣ties) and by little and little as the Labour ap∣approacheth, (chiefly after the Child is turn∣ed and falls lower) it so distends and am∣plifies (as also the Inner neck) that it turns quite flat, and almost plain with the Glob of the Womb, opens, and dilates, grows Orbicular and Round, like a Circle, Crown or Spreading-Rose, as if Nature were preparing a way for the Childs breaking out; being much helped herein, by its greater Weight, and more sturdy Stirring. Its Lips are then more Thick and Slippery, Fungous also like a Spunge. In the last 3, or 4, Weeks it is moist∣ned, and soaked with a Glutinous Viscid Hu∣mour,
or Slime filling almost the Short Neck, that it may be more fax, stretch and widen (as it does in a stupendous manner) with less Violence, and afford the Infant a freer passage at Labour. Nature's usual, most frequent, and statute Term of compleating this great Generation, and of a Legittimat Birth is the 9th. Month entire, as the 10th was held of old: Or the end of the 9th. or beginning of the 10th. and what is made much over is a Cheat of Women, or a Mistake in their Reckoning, where∣in very oft they are grievously beguiled: Whatever also truly prevents it, is Praeter-natural, moved by some Morbifick or valid injuring Cause: And the sooner cast, more rarely kept in Life (as in the 5th. or 6th. Month, being so feeble and delicate, though some such are said to have come to a Lively Age) but the later, the more Ripe and Strong: Whence 8th. Months Births must needs be more Natural, and Vital then the 7th. which some deny, making the 7th: Month the First Term of a Lively Birth. Most Physicians, will have this Term tho' fixed to Bruits, yet Variable and Ʋncertain to Women, through Diversity of Places, Times, Dyet, Passions of Mind, Temperament of the
Woman, of the Seed and Womb: Whence the Infants heat increases whiles more quick∣ly whiles slower, its Maturity is expede sooner, or later: And the Term prevent∣ed, or put off: Hence at this day, it is maintained as a most Firm Rule, that some Infants may, and have been Legittimatly Born (and pronounced such) in the 12th. 13th. 14th. Month (not to mention the Double, or Triple) and that for the Sickness, and Weakness of the Infant, or Mother, Cold∣ness of the Womb, Scarcity of Aliment, or the like: Though yet such late Births are very justly suspected and observed almost ever in such Widows only, who for love of a dead Husbands Fortune, playes an after Game, and pretends him the Father of ano∣ther mans Child: A Trick so frequent, as to make Clamorous, Debates among all Courts of Justice every where: and most rarely or never in Women with whom their Husbands live and Bed, who are found (by dayly Ex∣perience and in every Constitution and Cir∣cumstance) to keep this Statute Term some few Dayes only in or over, without putting off to one, much less several Months. The Infant having by this time, its due Maturity, and now finding great Ʋnease, and
Anxiety in the Womb (which is Commonly ascribed to Straitness of the Place, Scarcity of Aliment, as also its Impurity, and Corruption: And Some hold the Redundancy of Excre∣ments within the Infant, and Necessity of their Discharge: Others its need of the Air and Respiration: And some the Wise Disposal of the Great Creator) tosses and wrests it self every way, and Spurns sharply to break through the Gate with Violence, and get out of that Obscure, Sordid, Pinched Goal (and a wonder, how it could be kept, live and move therein so long) Whence great Pains are wakened and redoubled, the Membranes wherein it is wrapt are split, the Waters therein flow out, the Womb is grievously irritated to its Expulsion; for which the Mothers Muscles, Tendons, Nerves are forth∣with copiously filled, and inflate with an Ʋniversal Influx, and Vehement Force of the Animal Spirits; chiefly the Constrictory Fibres of the Womb, and Muscles of the lower Belly, which with Joynt and Full Force makes frequent and hard Efforts, and Strong Compressions of the Infant: And so a Valid and Speedy Protrusion thereof.
CHAP. VII. If Woman go with Boy or Girle, and if she have more than One. SOme are fond to know (which yet con∣verts not the Sex, however some Wo∣men are said to turn suddenly Men in their time) if they go with a Boy, or Girle (tho' there is no Difference in the beginning of Generation, and the Girle is held the Male only inverted, or Marr'd) of which some Guesses are made (a Certainty being Impos∣sible, whatever some Vainly Boast) which we may recite, and refer to the Comers to consider, and crack upon, yet believe as they list: As that Women in their Flourish, have mostly Males: These also who have them are more Cheery, Jocound, of a more entire Health, suffer less Stress of Symp∣toms, and haply of a far more Elegant, Vive Complexion, Florid, Rosy Colour: Goes lighter, carries them without trouble, or notable Weight, finds them Stir sooner
and more Sharply, have Milk sooner in their Breasts, which are also more replete of a Thicker, not Waterish Milk; chiefly the Right Breast which is firmer. The Niples are more Coloured, more tumid, erect, and turned upwards. Males also, are said to possess the Right Side of the Womb mostly (though Some make Infants keep mostly that side rather the Womb enclines to, be it Right or Left) and all the Right-side Parts to be more Lively, Warm, Ro∣bust, Agil, Prompt, and readily first moved, and used: to wit, If she sate, kneeled, or stood upright, she would lift her Right-foot first, rather then her Left. As these are held Signs of Boys, so the contrary of Girls, for whom some have no Sign more sure and stable, then if the Woman suffer great La∣bour and Sickness in the last Months, yet keep. all which if true, the Prognostick is easie. Some beside, make the Males begotten of the Right Testicle as Warmer, and more Varicous while the Provision of the Right Artery may come wholly from the Aorta and more Warm Spirit: But that the Left contains mostly a more Serous and Weaker Seed: While we may believe the Matter to be sent from the Emul∣gent; though some wanting either Testicle,
have yet begotten a Number of both Sex in∣differently, the Seed being generated alike good in the one, as the other. They will also have Males conceived in the waxing of the Moon, Females in the waining: But both being daily brought forth Indifferently, must be daily also Indifferently Conceived. Beside, that many justly doubt any Action or Rule of the Stars upon things below. Some pretend to know it by the Ʋrin, some by the Milk, by other Signs, and Experiments also, which yet seem obscure and ridiculous. We need not mention Authors, Fabulous Stories and Examples of numerous Litters at once, as 10, 15, 24, 36. and many more, yea 364, or 5. one for each day in the year (all surely very small and unshaped) brought forth by the Countess of Holland in the 42 year of her Age, and all Baptized. One is most usual over all: Twins oftimes: Whiles Three, which only may live: Sometimes four, yet live not: Both which is more rare and looks Monstruous, while Nature hath given two Paps only to Women, yet some have had two Niples to one Breast yeilding Milk. The Signs of Twins (which live, even though of different Sex, contair to some)
are the painful, extraordinary Bigness, and Swelling of the Belly (yet this appears not the First Months) its ample Distention, and Protuberancy to the Sides, with an extern Midle Line a little depressed: Diverse and more frequent Motions (though some make Twins move little in the last Months for want of room) Swelling of the Legs, and Thighs, sometimes also the Lips of the Privities, and all the share: A very uneasie and painful State of the whole Body. But seeing all these are found with one single Infant, no certain Sign can be had hereof. CHAP. VIII. Of Superfoetation. IT sayes Conception upon Conception, or a Woman already with Young, by renew∣ed Congress conceiving again. Monsters are rare, more rare a Superfoetation; yea so rare as by most made impossible (though Some also have observed it Epidemick) the Mans Seed being quite debarred the Womb, by the most strait and firm Closure of its Inner Orifice in∣stantly after Conception, which also abides
still, so exactly Sealed, as nothing can flow out, nor yet be got in that way. Neither hath the Womans Seed any possible access to the Womb, these Conduits in the Bottom, through which it slides into its Cavity in the Congress, being then also firmly contracted, and stopt: And is therefore discharged in after Coitions (as also the superfluous Blood in Some Ptethorick Women, and other Trash) through Dark Wayes, or Extremities of Vessels, ending as well upon the Womb, as its Neck and the Sheath; not entring within to hurt the Infant. Superfoetations, however rare, are asserted, both by the Antients, and many O∣thers: Yea occur in Experience, and said to happen in the Fervour of a very Libidinous Tickling Congress, and a most ravening Action of the Womb for Generating; whence the Womans Seed may (in this Warmth, and Ve∣hemency) Impetuously penetrate these Passes, and spring into the Womb (the Secundine ad∣hearing to one part only) and the Orifice also (the Womb being thus wildly incited in this Lustful Fervor) may yet open in the Sport (as it does more often at certain Intervals, to vent some noisome Stuff) for admitting the Mans Seed, which being darted thither, and both retained, must form this new
Conception therein (some hold it formed also without the Womb) against which let Women keep free of Congress their First Months, these chiefly who have still the Terms, and held subject to Conceive again. Authors afford Instances hereof, with the various times of their Conception, and Pro∣duction. Some several dayes only between. Others Weeks, some, Months. And are are held caseble, from the time on∣ly the first Geniture is involved in the Me∣mbrane, and so secured against Elarse, or Mixture; till the 3d. or 4th. Month though some are found yet later) that the Distenti∣on of the growing Womb marrs Reception, and Comprehension of more Seeds, and this new Conception: Its different Motions in Congress, and greed of Conceiving affording that while, to open, admit and enclose the last Seeds, yet securely retain the Conception: At least if there be a Healthy Mother, a robust Embryo al∣ready formed, being then firmly tyed to the Womb, neither yet making any stir to be out. If the Superfoetation happen near the Con∣ception, it may be Perfected, and Born as if it were a Twin, if long time after, it will still be Small and Misthriven, and prove Abortive, through penury of Aliment; the
most part thereof being derived to the First, as more Perfect and Strong. Twins, or more be∣ing Begotten in the same Coition from the a∣bundance of Seed (the Partitions, or Cells of the Womb say some) come almost ever of alike Bigness, and Maturity, are Born, as well as Conceived without any Distance of Dayes, have one and the same After-birth mostly, which the Superfoetation hath distinct, as also the Bag and Waters, Distant Terms likewise of Birth, and is of inequal Bigness and Perfection. There is said to be a Corrupt and Mon∣struous Super Impregnation in many Places, of diverse Shapes and Similitudes: But these some place among the Kinds of Moles: CHAP. IX. Of a Mole. THe true Mole, is a fleshy Tumor, or rude indigested Mass (whence its Name) without Bones, Bowels, right Disposure or Order of Parts, and Members, or any Em∣bryo, Figure, or Shape (though whiles there be a Rudiment of some Form) Soul or true Life: Engendered in the Womb by Congress,
and of both Seeds, which are Commonly held as necessary thereto, as to the ttue Concep∣tion. Some admit it possible of the Womans Seed alone, though most usually of both. Others again, will have them rather arise from abundance of Womens Seed, breaking out in Congress of wanton Lustful Girles with Old Men (whom therefore they should re∣fuse, and marry their like) or in Lascivious Converse, or then by Veneteous Dreams (as to some with singular delectation) Coagu∣lated, and perfited, by the Heat of the Womb, augmented by access, and Collecti∣on of the Courses, or Humours which serve the Conception: And so be Generated the same way, as any other sort of Flesh: caseable also to Widows and Virgins, (the more Salacious, or Lustful chiefly) and meerly from a Fancied or Imaginary Venery, without knowing Man: And whereof they may make Abortion also. This Seed how∣soever of the Mole seems vitiated in its true Specifick requisite Constitution, being Cor∣rupt, Languid, Diseased, or of Crude earthy Vegetant Principles only, and destitute of the more Active, or Formal Principles of an Embryo, the Plastick Vertue, or Forming fer∣tile Spirits, or hath them (as also the Heat
and Ferment of the Womb) extinct, or great∣ly suppressed, and smoothered with such crude humid Principles, abounding Courses, Whites or other vile Trash in the Womb; from which Nature not being able to rid it self, nor separate the precious from the vile as it ever intends, and so frustrate of its Scope, all is spoiled and marred, and so runs into this ugly rough Mass, never or most rarely found, save in Women, against which, they best forbear Coition, when the Courses are near, or the time thereof, and not be too ardent after Conception ere the Infant be formed. Moles are of various Figures and Colour: And some are more soft and Fleshy, some more firm, and Membranous, some most dense, and Nervous: some also Schirrous, Gristly, yea hardned like a Stone. There be also bigger, and less, and that according to their Disposition the supply of Nourriture (whence some become quickly more large, others augment flower, and keep small) the Temperature also of the Womb, and their Stay therein: With some many years, whiles all their Life, a painful pinching weight, toughly glewed to the Womb, which is still big thereof, keeping the Woman un∣der
Decay and daily Peril of her Life: Of Killing her miserably at length through its huge Bulk, and Ponderosity: Which yet some have carried about without great trouble or danger of Life. There is usually but One, yet sometimes more, which hath less peril. They, most part adhering more slightly, fall away, the 3d. or 4th. Month, not yet come to their just Magnitude: If they elapse be∣fore the 2d. Month, they are called False Conceptions, if they sit after, they grow Fleshy Moles, yet sometimes become Mem∣branous, full of many clear watry Bubles, and with a Fetid Sanious Matter often. If they exceed 12 Months, they are Incureable and abides many years, and mostly the Dropsy follows. Some are called Vital, because of some Sensible Motion: Others without Life, who have no such Motion: Though they all live a Vegetal Life, being nourished from the Vessels of the Womb, to which they im∣mediatly adhere, without Burden, or String, yet are entirely separated from it in their proper Substance. Albeit there be likeness in the Signs of a true Conception, and Mole, yet here the Tu∣mour is harder, more round and plain all over, yeilds to the touch, but returns when
the hand is removed: Is more grievously burdensome, hangs from the womb at the Share and Groyns, like a dead weight, hav∣ing no support of VVaters, pinches her lower Belly, Loyns, and Haunches, causes a weariness of her Legs and Thighs, whiles also a Suppression of Ʋrin: Moves not but with the VVomb, and then tumbles as a Ston upon the Side she turns to; Moving thus sooner, and with a greater Motion then the Infant: And if any Motion, appear to the touch, it is pant∣ing only. The Womans Face also is pale and almost dead colured, her Joints, and Cheeks Crine, her Body withers and decays, her Feet are very soft, her Breasts are lank, hath only a little Milk and that Crude and Ichorous or haply no Milk, breeds in the Breasts in a Mole, for that it lives no Animal life, it enjoys no Animal or Milky Aliment, after the Animal way, or by the Mouth; whence neither the Milky Vessels in the Breasts, nor VVomb are opened. She hath also the Symptoms off Pregnancy sorer, and the rest. Some add the waxing of the Belly with the Moon: But the bigness remaining after the reckoning is out, clears all. There are false Moles, as the Windy, a wa∣try also (tho some refer this to its Dropsy)
and sometimes these are complicated. Some mention a bloody Mole, from plenty, or a Congregation of Blood: A Mole likewise of a gross Plegmatick Humour. Moles are while alone in the Womb, and whiles together with the Infant; To which also they some∣times adhere, causing its Monstrosity, or Ruine according to the Part it Joyns, and its Im∣pression thereon: Yea, some have got the In∣fant enclosed therein. Of its Remedies and Extraction afterward. CHAP. X. Of a right Government in Pregnancy, against bad Accidents. PRegnancy though natural, is a Neuter State at best, and to many very painful, Diseased, and Unhappy, by reason of these Sore (yea sometimes Fatal) Evils occur, while they are not careful as to the Causes from without, or live not Regular in their Dyet, or use of the Six Non-natural things, or Necessars of Life, according to their Tem∣perament,
Custom, and Condition: Whence such Sorrows may else be happily shunned (at least more or less, according to their Dis∣position, and Course of Life) her welfare se∣cured, as also the Infant's (for as she is, so is it: Yea, what but lightly afflicts the Mo∣ther. may soon kill her Child) all future Health being rooted in the Right Ʋse of These, as is all Intemperature in their Faults, and Disorders, the many and Various Diseases also, it never claws off till Death. The Air about her, must be free, calm, pure, serene, finely tempered, (or fitted to her Temperature) without any Exceeding Quality, the too Hot enfeebles much, makes Feavers and Abortions: The too Cold, Moist, Corrupt, Stuffs her with Sharp, Serous Humours, causes Rheums, and Coughs. She must shun its Tem∣pests, Wind, Rain, Thunder, Lightenings: The pu∣trid Vapours also of faetid Stanks, Lakes, Ditches, Carion, Dunghills, Fumes of Sulphur, Charcoal, Candles extinct, and all its other Pollutions and Corruption: And some must be as wary of Smells more fragrant. She must keep moderate in Dyet, but take enough to her need and Appetite, yet rather little and oft, when once her Belly is more big, wholesome well readied Vittals, of
good easie Digestion, fine Juyce and Tempera∣ture; Proper, and Convenient, which are made of Beef, Veal, Kid, Mutton, Pullets, Partridges, Phatsins, Doves, Fresh, Fish (chiefly of runing Waters) new laid Eggs and the rest. In Or∣der also, and Time convenient. Abstaining Meats more Hot, vehemently Warming and too Generous Liquors, Spirits, Spiceries: Meats also too Cold (a middle matter being secure∣est) what is Course likewise, of hard or ill Digestion, may oppress, or grieve the Sto∣mach, generate Crudities, Flatuosities, Ob∣structions Cumulate Excrements: All things beside Bitter, Sharp, Diuretick (which yet are less dangerous, carrying off the Serosi∣ty only) Cathartick (which operate more strongly) Diaphoretick: what moves the Courses also, excites Loathing, Vomiting, Cough, or yet Sneezing, in which all are most vehement. She may for all that, take good Claret at Meat, now and then a Glass of Seck also, Mal∣ligo, Alicant, or other generous Calorifick Liquor: Some share beside of any Meat kind else she vehemently longs for, least the In∣fant suffer: And to prevent or Cure her Longings, for what cannot be got, is absurd also, or noxious (for which some have an extream, and stupendous desire and Appe∣tite,
and Eats in great plenty, a Malady fa∣miliar to the fairer Women (and from the 4th. day almost of Conception, even till the 3d. Month) and who go with fair Children, some say Girles, live idlely, and keep no good Dyet) there must be no mention nor re∣membrance of such things: Let her Ima∣gination beside (from the Error of which alone, Some makes it proceed, as Others from the fault of Humours gathered about the Mouth of the Stomach) be averted to other Thoughts: Present her oft quietly good Meat, that she may never be Hungry, being then usually thus molested. There may also be given her, a Gut Oyl of Cinamon, Nut∣meg, Oranges, with a little Sugar, Honey, Syrup of Corral, Citrons, Quinces, Cinamon, or some other Aromatick Cordial Water, or Elixir: And have applyed to her Sto∣mach, a Crust of Bread with Mallago, and and whiles the Countesses Oyntment with Tincture of Saffon and Mint. Her Sleep may be more free, to 8, 9, or 10 Hours for her Custom, the Temperament and Constitution of her Body: And may be procured if needful, with Almonds, Almond Milk with Sugar, and the like Temperat, and Humectant things: Yea with little Baths, Po∣pular
Oyntment rubbed on the Nostrils: Or a little Julep at Bed time, of Syrup of Poppies, some Theriac, or Diascordium, and Lettice or Poppy Water: For as Immoderate Watchings exhausts the Spirits, impedes the Concoctions, introduces a Fervid Intemperature and Acri∣mony, are most Infense to all Natures full and fasting: Moderate Sleep restores, renews, Comforts, and revives all to due Elaborations: Makes not only to the Infants Nutrition, but Conformation. Yet immoderate Sleep turns the Body a sink of Filth, and Nursery of the many and Chronick Diseases. Her Motion and Exercise must be more Curious, especially as she grows bigger: With due Mediocrity, and in time conve∣nient: It is best which exercises all the Parts of her Body equally, Paceing, Walking and the rest: Still shuning any painful, strain∣ing Exercise, as all inequal, hard, violent, or sud∣den Motions, Agitations, Concussions, Stretches or Wrings of the Body, all danger of Fall, as also Congress (which according to the Custom, and Opinion of Women must be more fre∣quent while the Labour approaches, for moi∣stening, and dilating the Parts to an easier Labour) And chiefly Women more delicate, of crazy Constitutions, Slippery, or miscarry∣ing
Wombs, who have big and lumpish Chil∣dren; to whom such uneasie Joggs swings the Burden of the Womb, may cause Aborti∣on, raise desperate Floodings, stretch or make ruption of the Ligaments, sink the Womb so low in the Hypogastres, that the Infant gets not turned, but must come by the Feet, a Cross, or in other ill Posture. Some will have Exercise omitted in the 1st. Month, in the 2d Month to be seldom, and slow, in the 3 d. more brisk, in the 5t. 6th. and be∣ginning of the 7th. more frequent, in the latter end of the 7th. the 8th. unto the middle of the 9th. abated, and after that more strong and frequent. She must live mirrily, be kept calm, and tranquill within, free from perturbation of more immoderate Passions, or Affections: Chiefly these vehement Commotions, Concus∣sions, and Vexations of Mind from great An∣ger, Fear, Sadness (Joy also) Lamentations, sudden and doolful News of dear Relations, or other amazing dismal Surprizes, Spectacles, Apprehensions: Whence sometimes great Loosings, Ecstatick Stupors, Catalepsies, and other vehement Alterations: Yea Abortions in the very instant, and Death it self oft superveens.
Let there be also, a due dejection of Ex∣crements, chiefly the last Months (seeing then the Belly is bound, from Compression of the big Womb) using Dyet more Moist, Emol∣lient, and moderatly Laxating: Little easie Glysters also if needful, or rather Stewed Pruns with a little Senna, Manna with Broth, or some other Lenitive. Some moreover, to make her keep the better to the time, order Bleeding when half gone, and in the 7th. Month (yet in choice should be rather the First Months, the Embryo being small, and the Blood more abundant, tho' then also the Burden is but little, and adheres not firmly) and is safe enough, due Circumstances being pondered: yea expedient, in case the Woman be Fleshy, and the Blood exuperant towards the Womb, to evite the danger by its Quantity (as in case of fault, or peril from its bad Quality, an Issue in her Arm or Thigh is spe∣cially useful) in opening the Vessels therein, choaking the Child, or yet giving it such a Growth, as would cause a painful, perillous Labour, or even make it come Abortive: Hence some have parted with 3 or 4 in end, who at last have kept, while frequently Bled: Yea so great, and frequent is this Plethory in
Some, as without repeated Bleeding, even in the last Months they could not keep: And Some such have had then both Courses, and Haemorrhoids, without hurt: And Others such also, through neglect to Bleed, or by Stop of some Evacuation, have after Labour been miserably Suffocated, or Cruelly kil∣led with Epileptick Fitts, or turned highly Fea∣verish; Especially while their Cleansings have not vented duely: Yet must however be mo∣derated to the Exigency, or her Plethory, San∣guine Nature, way of Living, Custom, Time, Place, and the like. Bleeding also is administred in their great and Acute Diseases (yea to Some very largely without any hurt) according to the Nature, Causes and Vehemency there∣of, the constancy and firmness of Strength. Bleeding (for all that) of pregnant Women in any case, must ever be as seldom, and spare as possible: And only at the Arm, in the ut∣ter and middle Veins say Some, as having least Consent with the Womb: and may be supplyed where it must not come, with Hu∣mid Cuping-Glasses, or Leeches. Catharticks also are allowed to Women with Child (if the matter wax turgid) from the 4th. Month to the 7th. without disturbing
the Embryo in the First Months, or when more young and too tender, or yet the Child in the Last, when Elder and too ripe, requir∣ing Roborant Nourriture, and Medicaments: And may before also, or in the 2d. in case of ne∣cessity, or where greater Peril Impends from the Cacochymy, then the Purging, by vi∣tiating the Blood, opening the Orifices of the Veins, moistening the Womb, relaxing the Tyes, loosening the Infant, and especially while Nature may concur to the Effect: Yet with the more Benign, and Lenient Purgatives only, as Reubarb, Cassia, Manna, Senna, Aga∣rick, Syrup of Roses, of Violets, Whey, Tamar∣rinds, Polypod, Lenitive, or Catholicon Electuary, and the rest (which yet are held not free of hurt) rightly corrected, and prepared a∣gainst Grips: And with regard to Diseases Causes, Bodies, Seasons, and Condition of Months, some of which are far more perilsom then others to Part in, for both Mother and In∣fant: Forbearing however Aloetick Medi∣dicines (by reason all Bitter things are suspect for the Infant) and others more Violent, the Impetuous Force of which it is not able to abide. Yet Some, either through Mistake, or for good Reason, have frequently given not
only the strongest Purgatives, but things also which provoke the Courses, Sudorificks and the rest, without doing hurt to Mother or Infant: Yea whiles to their Profit; and even in the 2d. 3d. and Sixth Months, and later: So that there is no so great fear at least in giving Diureticks, and Purgatives, as is commonly made, though it is better to be too Cautious, then Confident. Neither yet may Bleeding and Purging be used, to provoke Abortion, being so hard to do with some, and more dangerous then the Disease or Applications. She must the while slack her Dress by de∣grees, and go easie, for full skope to her Breasts, and the waxing Belly; for else be∣ing pressed, and hard pinched about with stiff and strait laced Busks, the Infant is marred of its Ease, and just Growth, made Mishapen, and forced away before due time: And her Belly withall, being hereby thrust only downwards, remains much Wrinkly, and Bagging after Labour. Now follows the prin∣cipal Indispositions usually attend this state of Pregnancy.
CHAP. XI. Of Vomitings. MOst Women use to have (instantly, or a little after Conceiving) an utter A∣version, and Abhorrence of some their won∣ted Meats, together with an Implacable Loathing, Sickness, and Vomitings, which vexes them sore, chiefly in the Mornings, and oftest the First Months only, yet Some their whole time, though a little easier: And is held (with the stop of their Courses) a prime Sign of Impregnation. This Alteration is said to arise from Cor∣rupt Humours in the Stomach, through Stop of the Courses: Or a Stain of the whole Blood (the Spittle also and Ferment of the Stomach) by Commixture of a more gross Blood, and corrupted in stagnating about the Womb. Sharp Vapors also, arising from Corruption nested below, and communicated to the Sto∣mach; excites Vomitings, while they prick and irritate its Expulsive Faculty more sharply, and Loathings only while more light∣ly. Some make it proceed from the Stomach's Sympathy with a dolorous Sense that while in
the Womb, and that through similitude of theit Membranes, and continuity of the same little Nerves and Vessels; as in Labour and Nephritick Pains, Hysterick Passions, and Lae∣sions of the Brain, or its Membranes. Some will have it introduced from the Spirit of the Mans Seed. They are not much cared for at first▪ while Moderate, as it were Spontaneous, and easily born: Yea by some held Wholesome, the Crudities remaining in the Bowels (while the Infant draws the Purer and more Subtile Matter) being by Nature's special care tran∣slated to the Stomach, and thus ejected: And such are said to have the Fairest Chil∣dren: And so must either be suffered, or by degrees corrected with a most Strict Dyet only. They readily mend after the 2d. 3d. or 4th. Month, or with the Quickning: Such Superfluities being by that time much cast off, and diminished by the Vomitings, and Concocted also, the Woman eating little this this while: Or now consumed by the In∣fant, which being bigger, stronger, and of more confirmed Bowels, draws a more co∣pious Aliment, and so a part of this Super∣fluity: The Womb withall taking better with
its Distention: So that what was Inusual, becomes now Natural and gives no Altera∣tion. If they persevere (as with Some to the very Labour) be more vehement, painful, and with great strainings, and if what she takes be instantly cast up, as Some (though others long after) there is great danger of Miscar∣riage (especially where the Womb is less Firm, the Infant more Feeble, her Time more near, and she any way else disposed to Abortion) by reason of these hard and sore Compres∣sions, Agitations and Concussions made hereby. Through this Subversion of the Stomach also, and Ejection of the Aliment, both must fail for want. For some relief to her in the case (for it is most rare to be quite freed beside her Dyet as already directed, (which would be de∣licious to the Taste, actually more Cold, and in such quantity as her Stomach may easily contain) Juyce of Lemmons, of Oranges, or Rose Vinegar, are very good with her Meat: As are all things moderatly Acid (unless her Stomach be of more Exquisite sense) pleasantly Auster, and Astringent, more Saltish also: With such Spiceries beside, as are more grate∣ful to Women (unless she have Heart Scaldings,
Yet she best abstain Fat Meats, Fat and Sugar'd Sauces, and other stuff of hard, or ill Dige∣stion. Her Drink may be good old Claret with water, well fermented middle Ale, tincture of Roses, brisk Sider, Perry, Goos-berry Wine and the like, she Loves or may come at. After Meals she may eat a little Mar∣malat of Quinces, Gelly of Goos berries, or Rizars; a sharp Pear, some Constringent or Digestive Powder or Tablet. Many things else she may use at times to Comfort, firm, and settle her Stomach (for she is not a subject for every Medicine) cor∣rect its Crudity and Softness, dissolve and expel Wind, excite Appetite, help to contain and concoct the Food: As preserved green Ginger, candied Nutmegs, Myrabolans, Orange, and Citron Peel, Elacampan, Prunella's, Con∣serve of Mint, of Sage Flowers, Rosemary, Betony, Roses Vitriolated: Confection Alker∣mes, of Hyacinth, Aromaticum Rosatum, Ca∣ryophyllatum, Species Diambrae, Dianthûs, Powder of Corral, of Pearl, Crabs-Eyes, Ma∣stick: Syrup of Quinces, [of Myrtles, Mint, Wormwood, Corral, sharp Pomegranats, Juyce of Citrons, of Dry Roses: Salt of Mint, of Wormwood; Spirit of Vitriol, and many others, such as the Cause and Occasion requires chiefly
that smelleth sweet) with their other Pre∣parations also, of Waters, Wines, Tinctures, Quintessences, Spirits, Oyls: Of which there may be Compositions to the foresaid Intents. There are outward applications for the Stomach, as distilled Oyls of Mace, Nutmeg, Mint, Mastick, Wormwood, Oyls of Myrtles, Quinces, Roses, the Countesses Oyntment with Tincture of Saffron, and Mint: The Mastick Plaister, Plaister of Crust of Bread, a Crust steeped in some generous Wine, Rose-Vinegar, Juyce of Quinces, or Mint; with Astrin∣gents and Spices thereon: Sharp Leaven steept in Vinegar, and Juyce of Mint: A Stoma∣cher also of things more Fragrant, and Sweet: In Winter, the Skin of a Hare, or Catt, or of rapacious Fouls. Some for all that Vomit still, even when over half Term, and to such little easie Purges are tryed, of Senna, Rubarb, Syrup of Cichory with Rubarb, of Roses Solutiv with Senna, and the like as Sutes her Condition, and the peccant Humour: Yet some choose Bleeding rather, being caused by the Blood retained, and seen aggravated by Purges, but much relieved by Bleeding, yea wholly re∣moved, if repeated Monthly till it cease. In end, when nothing avails, large Cup∣ping
Glasses are to be applyed to the Stomach: Yea Opiats and Narcoticks also are used when Vehemently urgent, and afflicting, to temper the Acrimony of the Humours, bridle their vicious Effervescence, and dull the Sense Some Bellies swell big and high, does so compress and straiten the Stomach, that the Vomitings continue, yea shill wax worse the nearer Labour, and Cures only by Delivery. CHAP. XII. Of Pains in the Back, Reins, Hips and Groyns. THey proceed from the ample Distention, and sore Weight of the big Womb, and the painful Compression it makes, in bearing upon the parts about, very grievous to the more delicate and infirm: From a Vehement Stretch also, of its Ligaments, which suffer greater stress and pain in the First Child, and a very big Womb then ever after, coming still more easily to their first Stint. The Ligaments though valid, soft, lax, yet are easily rent and broken, when thus high∣ly
extended by the appending Load of such a big Womb, and that upon any stumble, inequal or false step, hard wring, stretch of the Body, rude stir or external Violence, and brings vehement Pains, Vomitings, Fea∣vers, and other pernicious Accidents: Yea Abortion readily, especially if there be Losings or Bloody Excretions from the Womb, for then it certainly begins to open: And now she must Bleed in the Am, have Anod Strengthening Cordials, astringent Plaisters and others, such Symptoms require. And for prevention hereof, she must be very Curi∣ous of her Sin and Exercise with this big Belly, and beware of Suddenties: Take all the Ease, and Quiet she can, in Bed, or o∣therwise: And if she cannot sustain the grievous Weight thereof, she may lighten it, by hanging the same to her Neck, and Shoulders in a convenient Swath. These prove Nephratick or Gravel pains in Some subject thereto, who may use Oyl of Almonds alone, or with sugar Candy, Syrup of Althaea, Limons, white Wine▪ a deco∣ction of Liquirish, and Cicers: Broths also of Mallows, Althaea, Netles, gray Pease, with much Butter, and a litle Salt: The Water, or Decoction of Winter Cherries, Grass roots, Rest∣harrow:
Powder of Burr-dock seed in Posset, and the like, to open, relax, enlarge and make Slippery the Passages, gently move the Matter, and ease the Pain: Burnt Egg shells in white Wine, to expell more strongly, if the Pain continue: Or the Infusion of Millepedes in Reenish or white Wine: Or dulcified Spirit of Niter: Spirit of Salt, Sal pru∣nella, Perficary water and the rest: Outward∣ly also Fomentations, Ʋnctions. The Belly this while must be kept soluble. CHAP. XIII. Of pains of the Breasts. WOmens Breasts become a litle mor hard, and swell somewhat after Con¦ceiving, a Sign thereof to some: and is said to hap¦pen, by the Stop of their Courses, much Bloo breeding daily, and but litle converted to th young Embryo; whence its redundancy in th vessels, and Exoneration to the Breasts, a aptest to receive it, which being imbibe into their Spungy and hollow Kernels, pain¦fully Swell and hardens them, and more o less for their Repletion, which becomes th
greater as they have pain. The like may happen in a simple Suppression of the Courses. At first, She may only keep them warm, and easy, secured against any outward hurt, may Cause Inflammation and Abscess: Yet if after the 3d or 4th Month, the Pain re∣main, the Solidity also and Bigness growing dayly to a hight, as almost to the end of the 8th Month, she may Bleed if Plethorick, and use a small, spare, cooling Dyet. For these being most light Symptoms, admits few things, and Topicks do nought, unless they grow ex∣tream hard, which then must molify and digest, lest haply they fall into most Vehe∣ment Pains, or some Praeternatural Tumor, which most quickly turn into Suppuration. CHAP. IV. Of Incontinency and diffi∣culty of Ʋrin. THey both proceed of the big distended Womb, compressing the Badder plac∣ed upon, and adhering to it: For while it greatly compresses the Bottom thereof, t,
marrs the Reception of a due Quantity of Ʋ∣rin, and Retention a just time (tho this may come from Resolution of the Sphincter) whence the bigger she grows, the ofter she Pisses: And compressing the Neck thereof (as happens the first Months, to these who have the Womb fallen, and in the last, after the Child is turned, and falls lower) it marrs its Egress and makes a Laborious Pissing. The Acrimony beside of her Ʋrin, may irritat its Premature Exclusion, as may the Heat and Scal∣ding thereof, inflaming the Neck of the Blad∣der, or Ʋrinacy Passages, cause a Suppression, or this Difficulty. A Stone also striking against the Neck of the Bladder in Pissing. And whiles some drops of Ʋrin remaining after Pissing, in folds of the Neck of the Bladder (which are greatly pressed, and plyed down∣ward the last Months) and turning sharp through stay theren, smarts and provokes to this frequent Pissing, and with great La∣bour, and no less Pain, then she had a Stone or Ʋlcer. They are very Irksome and Hurtful for the big Womb, which must needs loosen, and bear much down, in a long continuance of these frequent Endeavours, Vehement forcings down∣ward, and trouble in Pissing: Yea may be urg∣ed
(the Annoyance remaining) to cast the Fruit untimely. If the turgid Womb be the cause hereof, as oftest, she may ly along before she make Water, and when it is to come, raise up the Bottom of her Belly with both hands: She may also carry it up in a Swath, or then keep Bed. When they proceed from Acrimony, and heat of the Ʋrin, she must use a Cool, Leen Humectant Dyet (especially what is made of Baley) as what else may contemper that Hea, and Sharpness of the Humours, Cool, and Cleanse the Ʋrinary ways: As waters of Mal∣lows, Red Poppies, Puslane, Lettice, with Syrup of Violets, Red Poppies, Jujubes, Sal∣prunellae: Or the Decoction of Cold Seeds: Or yet Whey therewith: Emulsions also of Almonds, the Cold Seeds, and of White Pop∣pies, with Barley-Broth: Or made of Ches∣nuts, with the Decoction of Liquirish and Lettice Seeds: Or large Draughts of new milked Milk: Small Ale, Ptisan also, or Barley Water, wherein Liquirish is Boiled; or with Syrup of Violets: Forbearing things Acrimonious, Acid, Salt, strong Liquors, Spi∣ceries, strong Purges: And it thus she ease not, Bleeding is ordered: Cooling and Emol∣lent
Applications for the outward entry of the Neck of her Bladder: with the like Injecti∣ons thereinto: Half Baths also in extremity. And if yet the Woman cannot make Water, it must at last be brought away with a Cathe∣ter, softly introduced into the Hollow of the Bladder, or a Wx Candle anointed with Oyl of Roses; which serves also to remove back the Stone, if it stop the Neck of the Bladder: and is all can then be done with a Big One, though endeavours may be made for ex∣tracting the Smaller. CHAP. XV. Of the Cough and difficult Breathing. NOthing so much hastens the Labour, or excites Abortion, as a sore; long conti∣nual Cough: because of such great Concussi∣ons, and sudden, vehement Convulsions of the Body, in these violent, and momentany Ex∣cussions of the inclosed Air, with which the Lungs are much extended: Whence such forcible Depressions of the big Womb, as may
elax its Ligaments, separat the 2din, raise loodings, or make her come before the Time. Besides other cruel Symptoms it rings, as loss of Appetite, Vomitings, Drouth, atcings, Feavers, Suffocations, hard Breath∣g, pains of the Head, Hypocondres, and the est: Yea a Wast, and Weakness of the whole Body in the progress. And that also which s from a sharp Matter, easily procures Ero∣ion of the Lungs, and spitting of Blood. The Cough is raised, by whatever may penetrat, prick, or any way irritat, and mo∣est the Wind-pipe, Lungs, and other Instru∣ments of Respiration: Be it External, chiefly n Intemperate Season: Or Fluxions thereon from the Head, of Pituitous, Serous Humours, Salt, or Acrimonious, and the rest: The like lso abounding in the Blood in Cacechymick Persons, and carried thither: Or yet some noisome biting Vapour. It is much promov∣ed in the Last Months▪ as is her difficult Breathing by the turgent Womb (the Parts and Bowels of the Abdomen, being thereby driven upwards so close to the Midrif, as to marr its free Motion) by her Plethory also. And Some have difficult Breathing from a gross Catarrah, lying about the Entry, and marring the Access of Air to the Lungs, or
possessing the Pipes, and Cells thereof, so as the Air cannot extend them. If her Cough proceed from a common Cause, she must keep warm, use a good, light, lenient Dyet, yet very spare and sober, of Rosted Meat (or rather no Flesh) fresh Eggs, Barley, Rice, Currans, Raisins, Figs, Apples, Almonds, Panado's also, Water Gruels, Bread boiled with Milk, or Ale, Sugar Candy, or Butter, which is very pectoral, and Others, as the Occasion directs. Abstaining Wines, Fishes, what is of hard or ill Digestion, is Acid, Salt, Spiced, or other pricking Quality. Things actually too Cold, or too Hot. Avoiding also all Tempests, Inclemency, Fogs or Cor∣ruption of the Air, chiefly at Night. Many Pectorals beside are directed, and Others proper for relief hereof, to moderate, or take away its Vehemency; prepared of Roots, Herbs, Flowers, Seeds, and Others in Ptisans, Decoctions, Apozems, Syrups, Lochohs, Lozenges and the rest; so contempered as may best alter, correct, and qualify the Humour, facilitate its Expectoration, lenify and smooth the Parts, shut the Pores, and preserve from Illapse of the Fluxion, Com∣fort and Cleanse the Lungs, and the rest: And be thus best adapted to the Disease, its Cau∣ses,
and Symptoms, according to the various Indications, and to all due ntentions: Chu∣sing ever such as do not much move the Courses. And so, for a Gross Matter, Syrup of Hyssop is used, of Hdge Mustard, Jeru∣salem-Oak, Oyl of Anis, Flowers of Sulpur with Sugar Candy, Balsome of Sulphur Ani∣sat, and the like: For a Thin, Syrup of Juju∣bes, of Violets, Red Poppies, Diatragacanthum Frigidum, Sugar of Roses, Pectoral Roul, and the rest. Lochoh Sanum beside, is used in a Cugh, Lochoh of Colworts, of Colts, foot, Syrup of Maiden Hair, of Liquiish, of Sugar-Candy, of Colts-Foot: Oyl of Sweet Almonds, Dia∣codium Solidum, Extract of Ecacmpan, Spa∣nish Juyce of Liquirist, and the rest. Though in a dry Cough, where no matter is to come up, they are to no purpose. Hypnoticks also are proper, Rheums and and Catarrhs, being digested, lenified, and stayed by Sleep, the Powers of the Head for∣tified: Such as Syrup of Poppies, Pills of Hounds-Tongue, of Styrax, Theriac, Diascor∣dium, yea Laudanum, in case the Breast be free, and not quite stufft, with Gross, Tough, Piuit. Easie Glysters also: Gentle Purges of Manna, Cassia, Polypod, Syrup of Roses, Whey: So as she may have daily Passage, by Art or Na∣ture:
Bleeding beside in a Plethory, or Sur∣charge of Blood in the Lungs. Vesicators, Issues, and other particular Evacuations: Perfumes, and Spiced Ceps, to dry and robo∣rate the Head. The Breast and Stomach may be rubbed with Oyl of Mace, and Ants, and kept warm with a Swans, or Catts Skin, or things equivalent. Oyl of Anis, Fennel, and Carraway eeds, may be used, if the trouble proceed of Wind or Vapors. If it happen from a close Compression the Womb makes up∣ward, where the Child sits high, or its huge Tumor and Distention being Shok full, the Bur∣den ready to be emitted, and the Womb still shut, whence some go near to expire (these otherwise Strait or Anhelous) or have all split. Such must keep easie, and in slack Dress, move softly, use Ʋnctions, Eat and Drink very Spare, nothing Vscous or Windy, of hard or ill Digestion, shun Passion, Fear chiefly, and Anger, which hurls the Blood upon the Lungs and Heart in too great abun∣dance, and overcharge of its Ventricles.
CHAP. XVI. Of the Swelling and Pains of Thighs and Leggs. THe Circulation turning here more slow, chiefly towards Labour, through grossness of the Blood: Its Ascent also, or free Afflux to the Heart, being ob∣structed by the Compression the big Womb makes of the Iliach Veins, These below must greatly distend and tumify with plenty thereof, as in all hard Compressions and Tyes, which bursting out into the Substance, and Coverings of the Parts, thus swells them: And hereby whiles the Coats of the Veins in the whole Limb, are so much relaxed (their Fibres being split through this vehement Distention) as they can never be Contracted again to their Natural State, and Varices rise thereon, through a Dilatation the Blood makes (yea, or Ruption in full Veins of Sanguine Women upon a fall, Violence, or rude Stir) of the Valvules (sometimes so great as to endanger external Ruption) being long
stagnant therein, whence also it may alter and corrupt, cause great pain and inflammation. The Woman now best keep Bed, where lying Warm, and equal, the Humours be∣come more fluid, their Intestin Motion ad∣vanced: Hence the Swelling usually falls a∣gainst Morning. The Varices also may have Astringent Applications, a firm Compress and Bandage seeing they cannot be cut out) to intercept the Blood, or set it on in its progres∣sive Motion, and prevent their further Di∣latation: She may Bled also in case of a Ple∣thory. Some Legs swell, and turn Oedematous, meerly from Weakness and want of Natural heat, after some former trouble, and by rea∣son of their Scituation under the Burden, and such distance from the Fountain of Heat: Or from some Excrementitious Serosity or Pi∣tuit discharged thereon, collected, and con∣gealed by little and little, and not expelled, or through ill Disposition of the Lymphae-aucts. The Woman in this Case (which is said to be most frequently with Girles) must use a good Dyet, which somewhat Warm and Dry, Meats of easy Fermentation, rather Rosted than Boiled: drink clear, throughly boiled Ale, a litle more strong, a Glass also of good Wine
before and after Dinner, make moderat Exercise, a due Dejection of Excrements, keep Merry, and the rest. The Applications, when needed, must open the Pores, attenuate, dissolve and dry up the Matter: With Repellents in the beginning, not too Astringent: As Fomentations of Elder-Flower Water, with Spirit of Wine: Or De∣coction of Wormwood, Centroy, Sage, Suthern∣wood, Time; Flowers of Rosemary, Chame∣mel, Elder, Lavender, Roses: Seeds of Cu∣men, Gith, Bay Berries, Junipers, and o∣thers, which warm and comfort the Parts: And may be Boiled also afterwards for their Corroboration in strong red Wine, adding Balausts, Cupress Nutts, Mastich, Alom and the like: or be fomented with Spirit of Wine, or Treacle Water; Compresses, or raw Linnen, being wet therein, expressed, applyed warm, and frequently renewed. They may also be well Anointed, at a Fire with Oyntment of Rue, Martiatum, Althaea with Adstringens, or the Countesses Oyntment: With Nard Oyl also, or Oyl of Dill, Worms, Marjoram, Mastick: and have Plaisters of Diachulon, Oxycrocum, red Lead, Mastick. But this usually being a light Swelling, arising mostly from the 4th. Month, after the other Symptoms cease, through the
weight of her Tument Womb, and falls i the Night, and if withall she be otherwise well, it may be committed to Nature only, and remitted to the Delivery, which she must wait with all Quiet and Ease, when such Superfluities (as these also of the whole Ha∣bit) are cast off by a copious Cleansing, the afflicted Parts relieved and strengthned. Yet if it arise of Cacochymy, the Tumor be great, fall not in the Night, vex her from the Be∣ginning of Pregnancy, with fear of Inflamation, or Ʋlcer, Cachexcy or Dropsy, as may be ga∣thered from her Complexion and state of the Natural Functions, a greater Provision is re∣quisite in a proper Dyet, Purging, Sweating, and the rest: With such Applications as the occasion shall direct. Any Disease beside of the Bowels, or noble Parts it may depend upon, must be seen to and removed. CHAP. XVII. Of Haemmoroids. MAny big Women are sore annoyed here∣with: Proceeding from plenty of Blood, and Humours gathering upon the Ex∣tremities
of these Vessels without vent: whence they lengthen, bunch out, and distend into Tumers: Some Hard like Warts, Some Soft like Mulberries, and sometimes of a Purple Colour like Grapes. Some are Bind, which send forth little or no Blood, Some Open and Bleeds much. Some are Less, and the Pain more remiss, Some swell monstrously Big with Inflammation Heat, and a most atrocious Pain according to their distention. Some are Internal, Some External. They are oftimes caused, exas∣perated also, and encreased by her hard straining to discharge her Costive Blly. The swelling ones are seldom dangerous, unless so Inflamed as to threaten a Gangreen: Yet are sometimes so Tormenting, as to give much adoe for Ease and Cure. If they come to Suppuration or Ʋlcer, they oftimes leave a Fistula for the most part incurable. If they be yet small, and the Pain more remiss, the Fluxion must be diminished, in∣tercepted, averted: Their Encrease prevented. The Big and Painful indicates a Mitigation (else the Malady exasperates) by Bleeding, if there be Pithory: Gysters (if they come or augment by hardened Excrements great∣ly distending the Fundament) Emollient only, as of fat Broths, Emollient Decoction,
or Milk with a litle Honey to keep the Belly, fluid: For which she may use Cassia, Tama∣rinds, W: keeing a slender, Cool Incrassant Det, more Humi and Laxant: As boyled Mat, Barley Boths with pott Herbs, or prun, stewed Barley with Currans, Broths of Poury, or Veal, Panado's and the like: And best keep bed this while. The Topick are made Cooling, Emollient and Anod e without great Astriction: As Li∣niments Unguents of Oyl of Linseed, Eggs, Roses, Chamemel, Flaxweed, Almonds, white Poppies, Galens cooling Oyntment, Oyntment of Poplar, of Tobcco, Butter, Hogs or Hens Greas: Balsom of Sulphur, Oyl of Box-wood, Sugar of Lead, yea opium in Vehement Pain. Oyntments of Toadflax, and of Pilewort are Specificks. Fomentations also of Althaea, Mal∣lows, Pellitory of the Wall, Flaxweed, flowers of Chamemel, Melilot, Dill, Mullein, Linseed, Fenogrek, and the rest, Boiled in Broth of Sheeps Entrails, sweet or churned Milk. Cataplasms moreover, of these, or of white Bread Boyled in Milk, adding Yolks of Eggs, Safron Camphor and Oyl of Roses: Or made of Onions Rosted, Rosted Leek Roots, or sweet Aples, mixt with Butter or Lard. Contused Purslane also is applyed for ease, Leavs of
green-Elder, Linnen dipt in Painters Vervice, a Fomentation of Cold Water, or of Rose-wa∣ter and Sugar of Lead: Some extol Ashes of Cork with Capons Greese: Ʋnctions also, with Oyl of Amber alone, or with equal parts of Oyl of Almonds: And many more such like, Simple or more Compound, as the Pain and In∣flammation must be eased, the Tumor exsic∣cated and discussed: And if These still con∣tinue, they must at length be opened with Leeches, or a Lancet if Soft, and Bleed to 2 or 3 Ounces. When they opn of them∣selves (as whiles by the plenty and force of Blood distending the Vessels too much) the Pain lessens, the sharp saltish Blood being thus evacuated. If they Bleed moderatly, they alleviat in a Plethory. In Some they bleed oft, and much, in place also of the Courses; yet without any hurt to Mother, or Child: Yea have been worse when stop'd. If they flow too abun∣dant, and long, the Thighs grow weak, the Hips feel a heavy Pain, the Complexion alters, they bring Coldness, Cachexy, Atrophy, Drop∣sy, by voiding a Blood too subtile and spi∣rituous, the Treasure of Life, and Foment of the whole Body. For Stop, or Moderation, there are inward
Lenients, Incrassators, Astringents, Dryers, such mentioned in Floodings: With outward A∣stringents also, as a Fomentation of Mullein in Smiths Water, or astringent Wine: Or a Fomentation of Acorns and Oak Leaves: Ca∣taplasims of Dragons blood, sealed Earth, Bole, Acacia, Spiders-webs, the hairs of a Hare burnt, and the rest mixt with the Whites of Eggs, or Juyce of Plantain: Applyed to the Vein if it appear, or softly thrust up in form of a Suppositor into the Fundament: Into which Injections may be made. Gentle Purga∣tion is used of Rubarb, Myrabolans, Tamarinds. Bleeding also, with the other means of Re∣vulsion; and what else may conduce for Cure. CHAP. XVIII. Of pregnant Womens Belly Fluxes. THey may have a Lientery, where the Aliments pass Crude not changed soon after they have been taken: A Diarrhy or or∣dinary Flux, a more speedy frequent and copious Excretion of Excrements and Humors
than is meet or usual, yet without any strong sense of Pain: A Dysentery also, or Flux of bloody Matter, with dolorous Grips, from Exesion and Exulceration of the Gutts. Any of which, when Vehement and Lasting easily brings Abortion (Decay also, or deadly Con∣sumption) by substraction of the Aliment, Dissi∣pation and Wast of the Spirits and Strength; chiefly the Dysentery, with a Tenesm, hav∣ing such gnawing Pains, and constant Sti∣mulations, to a perpetual (almost) Desire, and Necessity of going to Stool, without avoiding Excrements, from an Acid biting Humor stic∣king about the Fundament. Beside, that by this Depression of all in the Abdomen, the Womb is strongly compressed, and forced downwards, its Ligaments relaxed (for the same Muscles which serve to expel the Ex∣crements, are imployed for Delivery) and the Infant poysoned with the stink of continually dejected Excrements. Some Women however have had a Belly Flux this While, yet safely laid at full Time, and the Child well: But if it cease not at Labour, in a very short time af∣ter she dies. A Flux happens to Big Women, mostly from the Cold Humid Distemper of the Sto∣mach, the Weakness of its retentive Faculty, a
dull Ferment and bad Concoction, so exceed∣ingly advanced by degrees, through their va∣rious and absurd Desires, unruly Dyet, and frequent Vomitings, that the Aliment passes quite unaltered, or else converts into a Cor∣rupt Acrimonious Chyl, provocking to this praemature, frequent, and torminous Excre∣tion. It may arise also from Phlegm, or sharp Humors irritating the Expulsive Faculty. As to Cure, the Means against her Vomi∣tings are proper in a Lientery, where the Sto∣mach being thus extreamly debilitated, tur∣ned Flaccid and lax in its Membranes, is best corroborated with Aromaticks a little Auster, mixt with generous Wine, or its Spirit: With things also pleasantly Acid: By drinking Spirituous, but little Drink, good Claret, Spanish Wine, Canary Hippocras, Worm∣wood Wine: Abstaining things very Waterish, actually Cold, or Chill: Catharticks also, where the trouble comes of Weakness only. There may be outward Applications of things Aro∣matick, Warming, and Astringent. If it be only a gentle Flux of Excrements, with some superfluous Humors, it needs no speedy Co∣hibition, but only be moderated by a pro∣per Dyet; yet where it looks to last, the peccant Humor in the Gutts, which may Fo∣ment
it, must be purged off by an easie Infu∣sion of Senna and Reubarb with Syrup of Ci∣chory: By Catholicon also, or Lenitive, with powder of Rubarb: Using after heriac, Di∣ascordium, Confection of Hyacinth, steeled Wa∣ter, or Milk, the white Decoction, Decoction of Tormentìl Roots, or Oak Leaves. Ali∣ments more solid, Styptick, and of a pleasant Austerity, which incrassat and dry. If it turn a Dysentery, or bloody Flux, its Cure must be wrought by due Expurgation of the vicious Matter, with Potions of Ru∣barb, Myrobotans, Tamarinds, Santals, Leaves and Seeds of Plantain, infused in Cichory, En∣dive or Purslane Water, adding Almonds, Barley, Liquirish, Cassia, Raisins, or the like, which may together temper, and allay the Humors: Using it as frequently as the Pa∣tient can bear. Powder of Rubarb is usual∣ly given, first Raw, then Torrified: Infusion, or Powder of Mechoacan, is also commended. Glysters, beside are used (tho if the trou∣ble be in the upper Gutts, there must be none, or few: And then also it proves deadly for the most part, the Stomach being brought by consent to Vomitting and Hiccough) first Anodin, of Milk, with yolks of Eggs, Turpen∣tine, Oyl of Almonds: Or of Milk boyled
with Althaea Roots: Or with red Roses, Cha∣memel and Melilot flowers: Or then made of Mutton, Chicken or Capon Broth: Or de∣coction of the Intestins and Extremities of Veal or Mutton: Adding Narcoticks in ex∣tremity. These Detergent are next, of com∣mon Decoction with Honey, or Sugar of Ro∣ses: Or the Decoction of Roses, Bran with brown Sugar: Or Turpentin with the White of an Egg. Glysters in end, of things Vulnera∣ry and Astringent, which may dry, consoli∣date and bind: As Juyce of Plantain alone, or with Milk or Barley Water: Or Gum A∣rabick, or Tragacanth, or Sarcacol, or Frank∣incense, or Mastick in Plantain Water: Tho it is fit Cleansers be still intermixt; yet usual∣ly all these Jndications and more are Answe∣red in one and the same Glyster. While these are giving, things of the same nature may be taken by the Mouth, which incrassat, a∣strict the Wayes, sist the Fluent Cause, quite stop the Flux, and strengthen the Part: As Gelly of Harts-horn, Broths of glewing Extre∣mities, with Sorrel, Purslain, Endive: Or with Gum Arabick, or Tragacanth: Or made of the fat Gutts of a Sheep, with some Oyl: Steeled, or Rice Milk and Sugar, with Yolks of Eggs: Milk Pottage of fine Bread:
Bread made of Barley Flower, with Yolks of Eggs, and eaten with Milk and Sugar: Or Cows Milk with Conserve of Roses, or boiled with Yolks of Eggs: Or Crums of fine Bread tosted, in brisk Claret, Styptick, and Astrin∣gent: Or a Nutmeg tosted in Embers taken therein, if there be no Fever: Or the Wine alone, with which she may be the ofter (tho sparingly) refreshed. Drinking also Water with Conserve of Roses: Tincture of Roses: Decoction of Oak Leaves, or of Ma∣stick, with Syrup of Corral, Quinces, Myrtles, dry Roses. Proceeding to things stronger, in case of Vehemency and great wast of Strength: As Broths with Roots of Bistort, Tormentil, Comfrey: Leaves of Plantain, Pim∣pinell, Horse-tail, Ladies Mantle, and the rest. Opiats of old Conserve of Roses, Conserve of Quinces, of Comfrey, Diascordium, Confe∣ction of Hyacinth, Alkermes: Pouders of Cor∣ral, Pearl, sealed Earth, burnt Harts-horn, Bole, Blood Stone, Dragons Blood, Mastick, Gum Arabick, Tragacanth. Juleps also may be frequently given of Astringent Waters, or Decoctions, Syrups, Pouders with Narcoticks, beside, chiefly Laudanum. Cautious howe∣ver of a too sudden, or too great Astriction before the bad Humors be quite purged out:
So that in case too much Binding do hurt one must Purge again, then Bind, and after Purge again. There are Extern Applications to the Stomach, and Belly, Anodin, Astringent and Strengthening: Such chiefly mentioned in Vomiting: For the Stomach being corrobo∣rated, all Fluxes soon stop. CHAP. XIX. Of Courses, of Flooding, and Whites. THo the Courses most naturally neither do, nor ought to flow in pregnant Wo∣men: Yet Some (but the fewest of all, and the case is very rare) have them duely (tho in less Quantity, and Some say of a pale Colour, and alwayes shew ill Dyet; which therefore Nature casts off as unfit for the Childs nou∣rishment) till the 4th or 5th Month: Yea Some more Plethorick, all their Time, dis∣charging that Redundancy (more or less, for their Disposition and Plenitude) with the Moon, or at the usual time, by Vessels which ter∣minate in the outer Neck of the Womb, and
Sheath lest flowing through the Womb, the Infant be therewith overwhelmed, and made Abortive (tho Some make it come by the Infant in plenty enough, without doing it hurt, being closs wrapt in the Membranes, and pass trough the Womb) destilling from the Vessels by drops, and in small Quantity: Without any Morbifick procuring Cause, Pain, Weaknes, or other Trouble to the Mother or Infant as in Flooding: and may therefore be committed to Nature, with a convenient Dy∣et only, being beneficial for the small Em∣bryo proceeding thus of abundance meerly, and would need Bleeding if unduly stopt. If she Bleed in greater plenty, and through the Heat, Acrimony, Thinness, Motion, or other Fault of the Blood it self, the Laxity, or Apertion of the Vessels, or External Cause (there being no signs of Plethory) and if Pains in the Loyns accompany, Grips in the Belly, Swoonings, Imbecillity of Mother, and Infant, it must be carefully seen to, the Blood tem∣pered and stopt for fear of Parting, the Vessels Roborated and healed, by a Cool Lenient Dy∣et, Incrassating and astringent: And the other Remedies Intern and Extern mentioned for a Dysentery and Floodings with what else may comfort, Cherish, and Roborat the Belly,
or Embryo ever hereby weakly: Avoiding all things may sharpen, heat, and move the Blood: chiefly Choler which agitates, inflames, disperses, and troubles all the Spirits and Mass of Blood. Yet this Course is only proper, while the Bleeding is moderat, and continues not, the Child is alive, and any Hope to prevent its A∣bortion: For if it prove a real Flooding, or torrent of florid Blood springing through the Womb, almost on a sudden, from a violent Cause, inces∣sant, with great Pains, Faintings, Swoonings Con∣vulsions, nothing avails (however it happen) but a present Delivery, and riddance of eve∣ry thing in the Womb: Be it a false Concep∣tion, or Mole (Whence it usually arises when young with Child, while the Womb works to void it) a true One or Child: At any time of the Reckoning: And without waiting Pains and Throws as in the Labour (unless they continue more strong and quick) or a due Dilatation of the Womb, or breaking of the Membranes: Which now for dispatch must be broken with the Hand, the Case being urgent, where Some have died in 7 Hours Some in 4: And the rather, if there be any Loosening or separation of the Burden, as af∣ter a Blow, Stumble, Violence, or other Hurt
which can never more joyn, or fasten, and so neither the Vessels close, nor the Bleeding cease, till the Womb be quite cleared of the Child (which must now be brought by the Feet what ever other Part offer, unless the Head be direct in the Birth) and whatever else it contains: That by Contracting it felf, as it does presently after, and returning to its former Hardness and Solidity, the Vessels are Compressed; the Bleeding stopped, and the the Woman saved, if the Delivery have been got opportunely dispatched: Which should therefore be hastened. Usiing such Means in the time against her Fainting, Weakness and Vehemency of the Bleeding, as are for Floodings after Labour, that she may preserve Strength to come through the Operation, and recover after. This Flooding may proceed in Some from a Cleft or Rent of the substance of the Womb, through its too great Distention (tho Some hold it to grow still the thicker, the more it is distended) any Violence, Hurt, or consi∣derable Contusion; yet cannot be known but by Dissection after Death: And is ever incur∣able, even after Delivery, whither she bring forth of her self, or by hands: While there can be no Reunion of its Substance, nor can it
make that solid Contraction of it self, or Com∣pression of the Vessels, as when it is entire. Be∣side that then an Inflammation must alwayes follow which ever kills her. Flooding with a Mole, or false Conception is nothing so dangerous, as with the true One or Child, none being found to die of That, and rarely any escapes of This, unless the De∣liver: be more quick, especially the nearer she is her Time, the Labour being then the more difficult, the Vessels also of the Womb so hugely Tumid and Distent with Blood. Some Cacohymick Women have then also (and more readily then at other Times) a Flux of Whites, from pituitous Humors con∣gested in the Vessels and Substance of the Womb: And haply through the whole Body, taking its greater Encrease from Crudities of the first Concoctions: But the Crud Filth comes from the Womb, either White, or Wa∣terish, or Livid and Sanious. And when long Vehement and Acrimonious, brings Cachexy, Swoonings, Weakness, Swelling of the Legs; Gnawing Pains of the Reins, Decay, Abortion, Relaxation, Descent, Yea Exulceration or Ʋl∣cers of the Womb; which may in end convert into Cancers, as happens where they have a Malignity.
In this case they must use a wholsome light dry Dyet, Rosted meat rather than Boy∣led: Abstaining Fish, Milk, Herbs, green Fruits, or other Humid Excrementitious Stuff, too much Sleep or Sloth, too much Drink, or without eating: Coition also: Must now and then gently Purge, and use Dyet Drink, of Sarsaparilla, Guajac, Mastick-wood, Sasafras and the rest: according to her Temperament. Astringent Wine also, and many other Astring∣ents outward and inward: As Roots of Com∣fry, Plantain, of Salomons Seal, of Dropwort, flowers of the white dead Netle, Theri∣ac, Mithridat and Others mentioned in Flooding: And such as may comfort strengthen and dry the Womb, and Stomach, better the Concoction, and mend that Intempe∣rature. But among all things Some praise Red Corral, and its Preparations: As Others the White, which they will have alwayes taken for repressing this Flux. She may have Issues also in her Thighs or Legs for a more firm Diversion: And for Revulsion, Cuping-Glasses to the Shoulders and Back: Frictìons and Ligatures: yet no Bleeding, neither Injections nor Suffumigations.
CHAP. XX. Of the Weight or bearing down of the Womb. THe Distention of the Big Womb hinders its Prolapse: Yea, hath Cured it in Some when far out, being then gradually drawn up: It does however slip and bear much down in Some, whiles so far as to in∣commode their Walking, and Coition, and which they have found so weighty at the Bottom of their Belly, as to fear all ready to fall out: Causing also (chiefly towards the Rec∣koning) a Numness and Sleeping in the Hips and Thighs, difficulty of Stool and Ʋrin. And then putting a Finger into the Sheath, the Womb and its inner Orifice is felt there, fallen very near the Water-gate, chiefly while the Woman stands upright. This proceeds from great Stretch, Relaxa∣tion, or Solution of the Ʋnity of its Ligaments, chiefly the flat Ones, whereby it hangs su∣spended on each side to the Loins, and that either from the appending Weight, and hea∣vy
Carrìage of the Burden, and so much the more the bigger it is: Or if then there hap∣pen Stumble, Fall, any Shake or Concussion thereof: From Violence also, and Stress in the preceeding Labour: And very oft from a redundancy of Humors moistening and re∣laxing the same, in Women Phlegmatick, or troubled with Whites. These Ligaments are easier fortified, and the Trouble Cured after Delivery, when eased of that Weight, and Pessaries got kept there∣in, to stay it up in its natural Seat. Her best in the time is to keep Bed, or must stir litle, and softly: Keep slack in her Cloaths, and may bear up the weight of her Burden in a fit Swath: Must avoid Coition, all Com∣pressions and Shakes of her big Belly: Or whatever may occasion violent Expulsion. And in the case of abounding Humors, use a drying Dyet, good Food of Meats roasted rather than boiled. And above all, she must be so skilfully laid, as neither her forcing downwards to exclude the Child, nor Ex∣traction thereof, or of the After-Birth, procure its praecipitation, which easily may, and oft does in this Case.
CHAP. XXI. Of the Dropsy of the Womb and Oedematous Swelling of the Lips of the Privi∣ties. SOme Women go all the time with their Belly distended, and full of waters only, gradually collected, and inclosed into the Womb. which in end they have plentifully voided, in place of a Child they expected. And this is made the Dropsy of the Womb, mostly incident in Pituitous, Cacochymick, Hydropick, and Serous Diseases. If these Waters flow into the Capacity of the Womb (as in Some) by fault of the Sto∣mach, Liver or Spleen, the danger is greater, and ruine is thereby threatned to the whole Body. They are then kept in by the Clo∣sure of the Inner Orifice, and run off of their own accord, when it begins to open, where∣by the Sick sometimes recover.
If they breed in the Womb (as often) and mostly then after Copulation, through fault of the Seed, or of the Womb, especially when too Cold, or drowned with a too great Flux, or yet Suppression of Courses, Whites, or other trash it wont to discharge: As also when weakned by manifold Miscarriages, or violent Labour. They are then oft contained within its Membranes, or little Bladders: Yea, Some are big with several little Bladders full thereof: and is then worse to be Cured, making stay in the Womb, as long, and whiles longer than the Child, deceiving all with false Hopes thereof. The Distinctive Signes of this from a true Conception (for here the Courses stop, and the Belly swell) are Softness, and Extenuation of the Breasts, their want of Milk, the want of Infant stir also (a Fluctuation of Waters only being perceived) the greater Pain and Weight of the Belly (living Things being still lightest) which is also more Soft, equal∣ly extended, and depressed in Circumference. The Oedomatous Swelling of the Parts about, the Thighs and Legs. Moisture sometimes of the Privities: a worse Complexion, and continued worse Health. As these Waters may be alone in the Womb, so may whiles be in plenty together with the
Infant (For tho an Infant cannot be generat∣ed in an Hydropick Womb, yet this Dropsy may well succeed a true Generation) swelling some hugely: And makes great hazard of Abortion, by corrupting the Child, and de∣frauding it of Nutriment, a great part of the same resolving thereinto: Some void store of Waters long before La∣bour, which yet cannot be these enclosed in the Membrane with the Infant, else there behooved to be Pains, and the Infant to come therewith, that being the right Time: beside that they are entire at Labour, break and yeeld a full Fore-spring. Yet must have been kept in a peculiar Membrane. When this Dropsy is alone, sufficient Purgation is ordered to its Cure; and then things Aperient Diuretick, Emmenagogick: Af∣ter the taking of which, strong Exercise, Vo∣miting, Sudorificks, Clysters also, Injestions in∣to the Womb, Pessaries, Issues and the rest; to evacuate, and bring away the Humour from the Womb, discuss, or make a Revul∣sion or Derivation thereof: Yet when an Infant is therewith, the Woman most only use a good Dyet, moderatly Warming and Dry, abstaining Sweet things, and Liquid also, un∣less they may be easily distributed, for re∣maining
in the Body, they may augment the Evil. These Waters in Some disperse upon the Lips of the Privìties, and blows them whiles so wholly up, as they cannot bring their Thighs together, nor walk but with Pain: The Swelling is then Livid, and looks as it were Shining; but hath no danger, if meerly Oedematous, almost without Pain and Fea∣ver: Yet seeing they must straiten the pass, and marr the Infants Egress at Labour, Sca∣rifications are ordered along the place, for Evacuation of the Humour, big or little as one please: to be kept open also, so long as is fit and necessar (preferred therefore to Leeches, where the Orifices soon close) and must have Compresses applyed thereto in end, dipt in Aro∣matick and Astringent Wine to Fortify the Parts against Relapse: Using the while an Anti-hydropick Dyet. If there happen Inflam∣mation also, which hath ever a Feaver, and be communicated withall from an Inflamma∣tion of the Womb, it rarely Cures, but soon kills her after Delivery. Any other Swelling, or Tumor, Inflammation, or Abicess may arise upon these Parts, can make no danger, while it comes not from, nor communicates with the Womb.
CHAP. XXII. Of the Venereal Disease in Pregnant Women. IF the Mother be Pocky, so must her fruit, being constitute of polluted Principles, getting also a vile Acrimonious Nutri∣ment, which converting into its Substance breeds these Pustuls, Scabs, Byles, Spots, and Ʋl∣cers, which the Infants of such bring with them from the Womb, or appears soon after; making the greater Impression and Havock of their soft Bodys as they are Weaker, or the Mothers stain the greater: especially if she have Ʋlcers, exulcerat Chops or Clefts about the Genitals, which soon impart the Venom to the Child in the Womb. This being a Virulent pernicious Malady, with a Train of most dreadful rageing Symp∣toms, making speedy Havock of all (the Malignant Contagion being dispersed through the whole Body) needs a most skilfull, speedy and thorow Cure; which Some place in Salivation only, which yet if her time be
near, is best forborn till after Delivery: Else the Labour coming on the time of the Cure, might kill her and the Infant. If her Pox beside be Recent, Gentle and with easie Symp∣toms, this Cure must also be deferred till af∣ter Child-bed, using the while Gentle Purges, Sudorificks, Alexipharmicks, through the con∣stant use of which this Pocky Habit in Some, hath been throughly altered, a new Salubri∣ous Habit produced. Yet if this Pox afflict her when young with Child, in the highest Degree, with the worst of Symptoms, be rebellious, and stuborn, this Cure must be plyed, if strength admit: Being her safest Course; seeing the Disease, and its pernici∣ous Symptms still augmenting more and more, must in continuance certainly kill her. Beside, that Some suffer more by Remedies for other Acute Diseases in their Pregnancy, yet are safe. This Flux or Salivation is raised by Intern Medicaments, Suffumigation, or then Ʋnctions with Ʋnguentum Neopolitanum▪ or other Mer∣curial Oyntment: which last is securest in her Case: yet must be of her upper Parts only, as the Palms of her Hands, Wrists, El∣bows, Shoulders, alongst the Back-bone also, if it rise slow: And to be managed with all Se∣curity,
Care and Caution, that the Evacuati∣on be rather by little at a time, and the longer then too copious and suddain: Proceeding in the Quantity, and Reiteration to her Strength, and Facility of the Flux: Sure to be still Masters thereof. So if she be strong, anoint once every Morning for the first two Dayes: Morning and Evening for the third and fourth: Afterwards but once a day, till the Flux appear: If it come easily, once every Morning: If she be weak once every other Day. After the Ʋnctions she is to keep warm in Bed for an Hour or two, and Sweat mo∣derately. She must the while be kept warm: Her Regimen also ought to be strict: Chief∣ly careful, no Loosness or belly Flux arise. The rest as occasion shall direct, and are suf∣ficiently known. CHAP. XXIII. Of Abortion. SO oft do Women miscarry, and upon such small Occasions, as there are near as many Ʋntimely as Full Births: Especially if every Slip or Parting be reckoned; there being so
many even while taken for a praemature Ex∣clusion of an Immature Infant, whether liv∣ing or dead. The Causes are Extern and Intern: in the Mother, and Infant: And she in respect of both Body and Mind. And thus every acute Disease in general, killing the Infant by In∣fection, or through the Mothers Imbecility. All the particular Accidents above-mention∣ed, as sore Vomiting, a Violent Cough, great Cholicks, pains in the Rems, Strangury, Gra∣vel: Every great Evacuation, but that from the Womb chiefly, happening through Ruption of the Vessels and Separation of the Burden: Large Phlebotomy also (especially while the Child is bigger) strong sharp Purges, immo∣derate Watchings (Sleep also) severe long Fastings, want, or badness of Provision: too much Plethory also, through riotous use of fine Meats, Spiceries, rich Liquors, Spirits: want of things longed for, which makes pre∣sent Abortion to Some: every more vehe∣ment Agitation, Commotion, Stretch or Contor∣sion of the Body, Compression, or Concussion of the Womb by violent Exercise, Leaping, Danc∣ing, Runing, hard Riding, Falls especially upon the Belly or Loyns, going in Wagon or Coach, lifting or carrying of a heavy Burden,
vehement Motion of the Arms, in Stretching, Drawing any thing strongly, turning at Wheel, and the like: Loud Crying also, strong Sneezing, profuse Laughter, petulant Venery, especially when near her time: surprizing Noises, Faetid Smells, a certain Disposition of the Season, as when a dry nipping Spring suc∣ceeds a Rainy Moist Winter: the vehement Heat thereof, and every thing else may com∣move, precipitate, or kill the Infant, relax, or dissolve the Tyes, or move the Courses: All more vehement Passions, and Commo∣tions of mind have great force (in dayly Ex∣perience) to Abortion; chiefly Anger, Fear and great Terrour, sad News of Dear and Near Relations (too much Joy also) which dislocates and shakes off the Infant most quickly from the Womb, because of that rapid, inordinate and valid Commotion of the Spirits and Hu∣mours: causing ecstatick Stupers, Convulsions, Epilepsies, deep Swoonings and Abortions in the very Instant, or the same Day, for if she keep till the 3d. or 4th. there is less fear. Abortion happens through fault of the Womb (a vicious Conformation also of the Bel∣ly) being much moistened, and cold (too dry also and warm.) slippery and relaxed with abounding Pituit, Whites, or other
Filth: Or hath a Dropsy: Whence the Bur∣den is dissolved, the Fruit extinguished: and such are said to miscarry in the middle Months chiefly. When little, strait, dense, callous (large also and smooth) incapable and marred of a sufficient Dilatation (yet Some holds this to marr its Growth, but not to cause its Abortion) that the Infant being strait∣ned of room, must come Abortive; being thus as it were expressed out: Hence Some part at a fixt Time, and chiefly in the last Months: Tho' this may happen also through Compression of the Womb, or while the Belly is pinched with stiff and strait laced Busks: and may come through the Infant also, being too big for the Mother, as in little Women, and very Young, especially if married to bigger Men: or when some Praeternatural Thing grows up therewith. When Monstruous also, or when more are together, turn turbulent, and tor∣menting in an unnatural Scituation: Whence a strong Expulsion thereof. When the String also is too short. Abortion is foreknown, when upon Some or Other of these, the Breasts extenuate and flag, there is little Milk therein, and that thin or depauperate: If her Sides and up∣per Belly cling, while the Infant is Clewed
togcther and tumbles towards the Water-gate, if she finds an unusual Weight upon her Loyns and Hips, the rest of her Body Lither and Languishing, her Appetite lost, finds Shivering and Shaking by Fits, pain of the Head, chiefly about the roots of the Eyes: But especially if she have Labour Showers, or excruciant Pains, frequent, and almost conti∣nual, about the Reins or Loyns, dispersing to∣wards the Share and Os Sacrum, with some endeavour of bringing forth, and a dilata∣tion of the Orifice, it is a certain Sign of future Abortion: And if there follow any considerable Loosing of pure, or serous Blood, or Water, it is then near and Irremedable: And if Faetid, it signifies a dead Child: and then grievous Symptoms usually come on, as Shiverings, Tremblings, Palpitations of the Heart, Swoonings, copious Bleeding, and others. Abortion being contrary to Nature, is more hard and dangerous then the full Birth, espe∣cially in the first Child, in Fat Women, these also more Lean, the Labour being far more vehement and long, and Women sorer hand∣led, while the Vessels and Tyes are then vio∣lently split and broken assunder, which in the natural Labour loosen and unty of them∣selves: And the further she is gone, the more
painful, as in the 6th. 7th. and 8th. Months, the Child being more Big: And if the Rend∣ings and Tearings be very great, she is oft turned barren: Beside, if Flooding, Fainting, Rav∣ing and Convulsions follow, it is usually Mor∣tal: as also when Inflammation succeeds: And when excited by Violence, because of more grievous Symptoms. If she part in a danger∣ous Sickness, she readily dies, and the Child also, especially a continual Feaver, which soon kills her, augmenting, and redoubled more strongly through a total Suppression of the Cleansings, which happens then almost ever. If the Womb be very loose, and moist, the Abortion is then little dangerous, chiefly in the first Months, though such are prone to part alwayes. A Woman with Twins can rarely part with the One, and keep the Other, especially in later Months; but both comes ever away, the One some Hours, at least some very few Dayes after the Other: which yet must not be forced before its time, especially if the Flux of Blood be not great, nor Labour pains appear. Midwifes ought to examine all Exclusions from the Womb, if Blood, Flesh, a Conception, or Child, and by washing with Water, one
easily discerns if there be truly an Abortion or not. To preserve from Abortion, let the Preg∣nant Woman observe her Rules of Government, still careful the more Noble Parts of the Body, these chiefly appointed for making of Chyl, Blood, and Spirits be most vigilantly preserved in a Lively Vigor: Use the Means appointed for her Indispositions: and diligent-avoid whatever may Cause or Occasion Abor∣tion. These beside more Subject hereto, must use the while, things Astringent, and Strengthening, which have a power to firm and preserve the Infant: as prepared Corral, Pearl, the more precious Stones or Gemms, Kermes Grains, Mastick, Plantain-Seed, troches of Amber, of Earth of Lemnos, and the rest, taken in the yolk of an Egg, Claet Wine, Sy∣rup of Quinces, Myrtles, red Corral, dry Roses, and the like: Old Conserv of Roses also, of Sage, Rosemary, Betony, Condit Citron Peel, with many Aromaticks, and others which may cherish, Corroborat, and warm the Womb and Embryo. Fomentations also are used for keeping the Child, Cataplasms, Plaisters, and Ʋnctions to the Region of the Womb: Amulets beside, as the Eagle Stone, the Load-stone, the Cornelian and Azure: Corral also, Saphir, Hyae∣cinth,
Emerald, the Stone taken from the Womb of a Hart, and the rest. Some greatly praise a Girdle of a Sea Horse Hide from its occult Property, or of a Wolfs Skine in place thereof. In case also of Fall, Blow, Wound, Stress, or o∣ther dismal Contingency, tranquility of mind is proper, quietness and rest in Bed: with Cor∣roboratives, and Astringents to the Back and Belly, for the Infants Commotion, and Imbecillity. Bleeding also if there be Pain, or some litle Loosing (for in great Pains, Loosing and Dis∣location of the Child there is no hope) a good Dyet, somewhat Astringent and Strengthening, and whatever else is Cordial and Anodin, may repair Strength, refresh the Spi∣rits, and retain the Child. But so much for this, and here we end the first Book having thus briefly mentioned the principal and most usual Diseases of Women with Child, and gi∣ven some easy, pleasant, and safe Remedies and Rules for Cure hereof in their Case: accor∣ding to which also, the Means and Applicati∣ons for Cure of their other Maladies not here named, may be safely ordered and managed.
BOOK II. Of Labours Natural, and Unnatural, with the best and most effectual Wayes and Means of Delivery in either. CHAP. I. Of Labour in General. EVery Parting is not a Labour: But if the Geniture elapse, having no firm Consistence, without Form and Void, as appears till the 7th day (being nothing but the Seeds Coagulated, and a litle Crust grown over) it is called an Effluxi∣on or Sisp: As what is cast henceforth till the Quickning, an Expulsion: Hereafter till the
7th Month is the Abortion, which being Im∣mature, Small, Feeble, comes either dead Born, or Dies soon after: And the younger it is, the more rarely preserved: From that foreward is the Labour, the Infant having now Perfection and Strength to be Born, and Live: Yet the nearer it's full Time the better. This Labour is either Right, and according to Nature; to wit, a comfortable Emission, or Egress (while the Infant Labours as well as the Mother) of a living world like Infant, with all its Pendicles and Pertinents, at just Time, and in due Manner. Or, Non-natural, and Wrong; its Exclusion, or Extraction with extream Pain, Anguish, and Peril of Life to the Mother, the Infant, or both: With Symptoms at least more grievous then usual, and not in due Figure. The truly Regular, Common, and Nature's statute Term of right Labour (by just Expe∣rience) in every Disposition and Circumstance, is the 9th. Month entire, the Infants Grandeur, Maturity and heat of its Heart, driving it by this time, to spurn hard, and break open its pinched stifling Prison (being closly shut up by the Membranes, the Womb and the Belly) for a freer Air, and Respiration. And all other Terms and Births are either Praeter∣natural,
and untimely: Or Fictitious, and a Cheat in Women: Or then a simple Error in their Reckoning, while they usually begin from the first stop of their Courses, which yet for some other Cause may have stood 2 or 3 Months before Conception, and continue also to flow duely the 2 or 3 first Months after, but then stop: Whence also the Error of the 5th. or 6th. Months Births, which yet come to the 9th. as manifestly appears, by a due Magnitude, firmness of Strength, and Nails which makes to the Complement of the whole Body. And from the same mistake (or Tricks some may not avow) the 9th. Month Birth is sometimes made the 7th. The Infant in a natural Figure of Birth, pre∣sents (having tumbled quite up end down, with its Face towards the Mothers back) right to the Privities upon its Crown (coming into the World with the Head foremost, as carried out with its Feet, Death being contrary to Life) distending the Feet, Thighs, and rest of its Body aloft: And so, with its Soles against the Bottom of the Womb, pushes foreward, its Arms couched alongst the Sides: Advan∣cing thus in a straight Line: And is the alone Right, most Safe and Commodious Posture for both Sex: Into which it turns oftimes
a Week, 2 or 3 before Labour, Some much sooner: Others a few Hours only before: Some in the Labour (yet some come upon the Feet not turned) and is quickly done, yet not without some trouble to the Mother, who uses to be assured by this Mutation, her La∣bour is near. No marvel then, the fully grown Infant coming thus, get safely into the World: Yea, and (by daily Experience) without great trouble: Beside, that the Genitals now easily admits a vast stretch, and opens in a mar∣vellous manner to the Bigness and Form of the Infant, without Wound, or Laceration; turning almost one equal Cavity, from the Fund of the Womb to the Privities, through which it softly slides (the Bladder and right Gutt being emptied) the Wayes being withall well moistened, relaxed and lubrified by a copious Afflux of Slimy Humours soaking thereinto, some while before, and in the time of Labour: By Efflux also of the Fore-springs: So that in case of necessity they can easily ad∣mit the whole Hand. The bones likewise of the Pelvis, though stuffed and lined all round with Muscles and other Parts, gives the Infant full ease-room in the Womb, an easie Issue also at Labour
while it passes therethrough, and without Disjunction or Separation, being therefore set further distant, more excavated, turned also more outward, or arched, peculiarly framing that Circumference more ample and capacious in the least Woman than the largest Man; who hence have Hips more big and large. Yet when there is a big stiff Infant, and these Parts are naturally more strait or mishapen, the Way dry, the Labour then proves Sore and Painfull, in the Ʋrgency of which, through Violence, and the mighty Force of this Child in wrestling from these Straits, the Bones are made to recede, open somewhat, and disjoyn (the Gristles and Li∣gaments being relaxed) not only these of the Share, but the Bones of the Ilium also, from the Sacrum: And this is made certain by frequent Experience, and clear Demonstra∣tion: Hence after such Labours, Women have sore Pains in these Parts, and are unable long after to support themselves (yea some stand ne∣ver after so firm) by reason of this Commotion, or Divulsion of the Bones (tho without Lux∣ation or Ruption) needing Anodine and Strengthening Applications thereto: Yet old Maid, and big boned have here the sorest Pull, their Gristles being more Dryed (tho
Some make it the Dryness, Hardness and Cal∣losity of the inner Orifice) chiefly in the first Child (yea whiles in the 2d and 3d also, tho in after Labours they be easy enough) which stick long, and is sore Prest in the Passage, being so hard to open, and rarely ever comes alive. Some Attribute this Diduction of the Bones, to the Mothers most fierce Efforts in a Vehement Influx of Spirits upon the Muscles, the Infants tender Body, not having force sufficient to separate Bodies so firmly Conjoyned, neither its Head, being so soft, Some very far open, scarce holding together, which so would be crushed, and made Plain. Others will have them part of them∣selves, as ripe Fruit uses for excluding their Seeds. Some will have the Boxes open in every Labour, altho most easy, while yet we see little Women bear most quickly, even fully grown Infants with the greatest ease, and without Pain worth the speaking; and that ether in Bed, or where they sate, and Some before a Midwife could come: Yea Some instantly af∣ter plying their Business, as if nothing had ailed them: which could not be with such a Divulsion and stretch of the Membranes a∣bout: Beside that this Gristly Connection is
too firm, to separate so lightly in an easy La∣bour by a small Infant: nor can it be needful, where the Bones are room, the Way slippery, the Infant little, soft, flexil, and comes right. CHAP. II. Of the Signs Antecedent, and Concomitant, of a Natural Labour, and the Non-natural. WHen the Midwife is called to a big Woman, taken with Pains in Back or Belly, before she excite her to Labour, she must try the state of the Womb, ponder the following Signs, and be sure these make her effectual Pains, and that she will shortly bring forth, else both Mother and Infant may perish through Labour in vain, and breaking the Membranes too soon: nor is one assured by an opening of the inner Orifice, so as a Finger may easily enter, nor by feeling the Head through the Membranes, nor yet by every
Pain in the Belly, unless they answer down∣ward, and the Waters be felt gathering. The false Pains are mostly Cholicks (whiles a Gravel) from Wind tossing in the Gutts, griping and throwing the Belly by Intervals, with Pains whiles extream, and exceeding these of Labour; yet without any stir in the Womb, or forcing downwards: and readily appease by Glysters, the warm Bed, some warm Seck, warm applications to the Belly, and the rest, which rather provoke and bring on the true Pains, The Antecedent Signs of near Labour, are elapse of the Reckoning, slipping of the Womb (whence her upper Belly turns small, her lower more bulging and weighty) distenti∣on also of the Privities, Expaension of the inner Orifice, vent of Moisture, and strings of Slime: Now and then dirling Pains, which yet are presént with some a pretty space before Labour. The Signs of present true Labour, are sharp Pains, and throws round the Region of the Womb, stretching from the Loins, down towards the Share and Os sacrum, or tumbling into the forepart of the Bottom of the Belly, one upon another, still more frequent, sharp and tho∣row, with Qualms and Vomitings, which
makes the best Labour, and good appearance of a happy delivery, a great furtherance al∣so, by forceing downwards: Through which (with her loud bitter Cryes, containing of her Breath, vehement hard Efforts, and preasing to detrude the Child) her Blood heats and is more fluid, her Veins tumify, her Pulse beats big and swift, her Face rise full and red, the Privities strout out, and all is in a vehement Choke and Estuation. The inner Orifice may be felt spreading open as a ripe Rose, the Waters gathering thereat like a blown Bladder, or Abortive Egg without shell, and are strongly forced down each Pain, still more and more filled and distended, as the Waters grow deeper, the In∣fant falls lower, and the Pains wax stronger: between which (while the Waters are form∣ing) the state of the Infant may be some wise discerned through the Membranes, and the way it presents. Shows of Red often then appear (especially with Boys) while the Tyes begin to split and the Burden to loose. Some have beside (when all is in a readiness) a shaking chiefly of their Legs and Thighs, from a vehement Influx and Force of the Spi∣rits. At length when the Springs are thus fully gathered, or the Waters pressed down
before the Childs Head, by their vehement Impulse, the hard redoubling of sharp thorow Showers, the frequent valid Spurnings of the Child (sharply moving it self every way, while it strives to burst open the Gate with Violence, and make Passage to it self) the Mem∣branes or Bag bursts (yet some break with small Pains, the sharper Showers coming seve∣ral Hours after) the Waters gush out, and the Head, if it come Natures way, offers Naked at the Orifice to pass, following the Rush of the Waters pointing its Path, lubrifying and preparing the Same. And still the dolorous Mother makes repeated Vigorous Efforts, the grieved Womb also, in a joint Contraction of its Constrictory Fibres, and Muscles of the low∣er Belly, for a speedy and forcible Ejection, or Banishment (for it shall never enter the place more) of this turbulent, and as were ingrate Guest, with all its Flitting, Aliments, Vestiments, Excrements, immediatly after (yet some come, tho most rarely with the Membranes wrapt a∣bout them, sound and entire as in a Lump, but are then feeble and Immature, ejected by A∣bortion, the way even Twins have come, each within its own membrane and alive, yet if they be not quickly Extricate, they choke. And having thus escaped from its Prison, through
Nature's triple Gates, between the two vilest Privies of the whole Body, (lo cause of Pride!) it appears a new Guest upon the World, fill∣ing the Place with mournful Lamentations, and not without cause, being born to all kind of Calamities, Misery, Pain, Sorrow, and to Death in the end. As this is the Progress of the Natural La∣bour, and these, or most of them Certify a happy Delivery, so it looks bad, and Unnatu∣ral, when the Woman is so very sore handled, as to be Pitied, and Feared by the Eperienc∣ed Midwife, and Matrons: When she Tra∣vels 2, 3, 4 dayes together, or more (in which the Infant certainly Dies, if not the Mother also) the truely Natural Labour being usu∣ally over in one. If the Waters be long while spent, the Way Dry, Pains small, Dull, long between, and Effectless, Dieing towards the Back: when Symptoms are sorer then usual, tho haply they last not long, especial∣ly an Untimely Flux of Blood just before, if Faintìngs, Weakness, Swoonings, soporous Di∣seases, or Convulsions Superveen: if the String or Burden come first: Or (which hap∣pens mostly) the Infant in bad Postures, as when one Leg, or Arm presents, the Sides, Belly, Breast and the rest, of which severally
hereafter, but now of some particulars need∣full to be known, for a better Asistance, and Aid, in both kinds of Labours. CHAP. III. Of the Membranes, and Wa∣ters inclosed therein. THe Membranes are bred in the Womb first of all, and instantly almost after the Conception, as is seen in the youngest (tho some make them Dilatations, of the Intern Membranes of the Abdomen expansed by little and little about the Infant, after its Parts are formed and inclosing the same) which Nature (beginning to sort the Matter to its Intent) forms forthwith (through the Vertue and Warmth of the Womb) of the Viscous and grosser Parts, which it thrusts to the Sides, (of the Womans Seed only say Some) to en∣close, Conserve, and cherish the more Noble and Spirituous, which contain the Idaea's of all the Parts, and Members, and of which their first Lineaments, or Threads, are pour∣trayed and shadowed out, and thereafter
Curiously falshioned into fair Forms and Fi∣gures, growing up jointly together into a perfect Infant, which lyes involved, and se∣cured in these Membranes, as in an Egg, or Purse, untill Labour, when they first of all pre∣sent the Orifice. Many hold 2 Membranes only about an humane Birth, or rather One double, being separable, yet jointly framed, so closely Co∣haering and unite, as to appear but one Bag for the Infant and its Waters: and is called the 2din, being the Infants 2d Habitation next the Womb, coming away also by a 2d Birth, tho the other things comes after the Child gets this Name also. The First or Outer Part, is called Chorion, as though a litle Place, for that it surrounds the Inner wth the Infant, as also from that nu∣merous Company, and Complex of Blood Ves∣sels come therein, (at that part especially, where by means of the Burden it adheres to the Womb, some Capillaries only being dis∣persed through the rest of it) and that both from the Burden, ere the Infant be formed, from the Navel String also, after it grows out of the Infant to a due length, intermix∣ing in this Membrane, whereon also These last are fortified, and rested as on a Pillow in a∣scending
to the Burden; to which this Mem∣brane with these Vessels is closely annexed, and by it to the Fund of the Womb: As to its Sides by small tendinous Nervy Fibres. It is pretty thick, and double: Smooth toward the Infant, to the Womb ward some∣what inequal and Rough. The 2d or Inner is called Amnios, for its delicacy and finness: It immediatly, very easily, and loosely enwraps the whole Infant: Called also its Shift and Vest, exceeding thin (yet some make it double) smooth, white and transparent: Haveing a few very small Vessels from the Ʋmbilicals, some from the Burden also, dispersed within its Foldings, re∣ceiving thereby into it self, whatever passes not through These into the Chorion and Burden. It softly plyes to the Chorion, Covers and Lines its Inner or Concave Part, being somewhat of an oval Figure; and is closely Connexed to it about the Burden, in the place where the String goes forth thereinto: And Some will have it cleave thereto almost every where. Some part of this Amnios happens whiles to rub off in Labour, and comes stick∣ing upon the Infants head. Some make it a Eilm essentially different from either Mem∣brane,
being thinner then the Amnios if possible, and only fitted round its Head, as a Helmet. Midwifes call it the Silly How, in Females a Caul, Coyff, or Biggin, in Males a Head-Piece: And this Some will have Superstitiously kept to diverse Ʋses (yet Others instantly destroy it) and makes a presage of good Luck (or yet bad, for the Diversity of its Colour) to the Infant, and others who use it; assuring his Future Hap∣piness, if he eats it, or Carries it with him all his Life in a Box (for he must not see it) else to prove Ʋnhappy, or even Epileptick, and continually Haunted with Ghosts, Infernal Spirits, or other Frightfull Spectres: but these are only Old Wifes Frivolous Clatters, or Crafty Fictions some Midwifes uses to amuse silly Credulous People: for some Hooded have been seen as Ʋnluckly as the Bare, and whiles the latter more Lucky then they. Some think they come in a Good Labour, and Rousing Pains; the Genitals being then well Widened by the Force of Nature, that the Infant is born very easily, while passing with great Labour and Stress, they are Rub∣ed off, and remain in the Womb, till they come with the after-Birth. Others on the Contrair, in the Weakness of Mother and In∣fant.
And Some from the Toughness of the Membranes, which the Infant is not able to break, Or yet its own Imbecillity: Whence Such rarely comes any Length. Which yet chances to stick to the Strong, as well as the Weak, to Males as Females, to the one of Twins, not the other. Some will have Twins wrapt in one com∣mon Chorion mostly, but each to have its own Amnios and Liquor therein distinct: And if These chance to be Split by Blow, Fall, or otherwise; or have not been well enough separated at first, that the Infants come to touch other, there they grow together, and makes a Monster: And if at any time they be in distant Chorions likewise, the one is held to be added by Superfetation in an after Coìtion. There is added a 3d Membrane called Al∣lantois, placed betwixt the Two former, which Some make of the same Figure and Extent in their whole Circumference, investing the whole Infant: Others in Form of a Sack, Pudding, or Gutt, according to its Name: in many a broad Sausage, or Girdle, which collects and holds the Infants Ʋrin untill its Birth, emptying thereinto by little and little from the Bladder through the Ou∣rack
Continuous to it, after all its Parts are formed, and the String past through the Membranes: Whence this Membrane fills, and Swells by degrees with the Ʋrin, which dayly encreases as the Infant grows, still ga∣thering thus more and more: So that at length a great Quantity may be found there∣in about the time of Labour, which so Copi∣ously Gush out at the breaking of the Bag. Others reject This in a Woman, and makes the Infants Ʋrin to void from the Ourack at liberty, between the two Membranes, un∣der the Chorion, round without the whole Aminos: Yet Some think that impossible be∣cause of their close Connexion, and will have it rendered by the Yard into the Amnios if Painful, but a great part also retained in the Bladder: Whence new born Infants Piss al∣most continually the first Dayes: and Some will have it all Collected and Retained therein till Labour: Hence in what ever Month an Infant of any Bigness be opened, it is sound full, and distent with Urin; which yet behooved at length to Burst: And These either hold no Ourack, or make it impervi∣ous, and no Humor at all to be found with∣out the Amnios. And Some yet will have its Urin transmittd into the Mothers Veins,
by continuation of the Navel Vessels with these of the Womb, and thus excerned. There is debate about the Liquor of the Amnios, or the Waters within the Bag (which Some make all of one Nature, and inclosed in the same Membrane with the Infant, into which it is Scituated, and Swims. Others of a different Nature, and in separate Membranes. And Some also of different Na∣tures, Aliments and Excrements in the same Membrane) if it be the Infants Urin, its Sweat, or the Fumy Vapours Continually transpire it soft and Porous Body: Or then expelled from the Heart into the Lungs, flow∣ing out by the Mouth and Nostrils, and there converted into Water about the Infant: Or if its Spitle, Fome, an Excrement from the Brain, or other Excrement whatsomever: Or if componed of all together, adding its more Liquid Excrements, which may also augment this Humor: Or if there be no sort of Excre∣ment, but a benign Nutritious Juyce, or Hu∣mor; the most Pure indeed, that within the Amnios, but the Grosser, and less nourishing without in the Chorion, tho chiefly necessar also, and subservient to the Infants Nourish∣ment and Security: Or rather as Others, the Urin without contained in the Allantois, and
the nourishing matter lodged alone in the Amnios, and thus kept free from Defilement of the Urin, and the tender Skined Infant from the Scalding thereof, as behooved if voided from the Yard. This Alimentary Liquor, they make no o∣ther thing in the Infants first Formation, then the residue of the Seminal Matter, which remains about it, doth Cherish, Nourish, and give it Grouth: But after (that being once Consumed, and the String entered the Bur∣den) a Milky Juyce, or purer Chyl (tho Some make it a Richer, and more Noble Juyce, next and more Analogous to the Original, drawing its Matter aswell from Nerves, as from Veins and Arteries, a finely sublimed Spi∣rituous Liquor: And so the Infant to feed up∣on the same it is made of) Coming from the Mother to the Womb, through some In∣tern Chyliferous Vessels reached thither (from the Chyliferous Channel of the Thorax say Some, from the Sack or Receptacle of Chyl say Others, and Some her Sweet Bread) and after received into, and carried down through the Milky Vessels of the String, into the Capa∣city of the Amnios. Some will have it brought thither by the Arteries with the Blood, and separated Pure
into the Amnios. And Some will have this Liquor flow forth from the Breasts, and car∣ried through Veins to the Womb, and the In∣fant to be nourished therein with Milk, as∣well as at the Breasts. Some yet will have this milky Liquor of the Amnios, into which the Infant swims, to be the more waterish Part of the Womans Seed, flowing continually in∣to the Womb, even after the Infant is con∣ceived therein. But these and the like, be∣ing obscure and uncertain Conjectures, and of less Use to the chief Purpose, may be thus lightly past in nameing. This Liquor accordingly, is made of Use to the Infants nourriture, Its Respiration also, To conserve the Cavities, softly carry up its Body (swiming there as in a Bath) in all the vio∣lent Motions, and Concussions of the Mother, that it dash not dry against the Womb, nor the hard Parts about: To preserve the Thread small Navel Vessels also from peril of Rupture: And serves notably at Labour, to relax and mollify the Parts, for its easier pass, the scarcity of which makes it so perplex'd, and unhappy, as sometimes the Mother is carried off herein, For all can be done to supply the want thereof.
CHAP. IV. Of the Burden and Navel-String, THe Burden, is a sort of fleshy Bowel, or Parenchymatous Mass, not unlike that of Lìver, or Spleen; contexed of innumer∣able Fibres, and thread small Branches of Vessels, affused congealed Blood or Flesh. This Blood, is not the impurer Part of the Courses, as was held of old (the purer pas∣sing into the Infants nourishment) but Vital Spirituous Blood, coming first more plenti∣fully from the Mother (who affords the great∣est part of its Matter) through the Womb Vessels, driven thither also from the Infants Heart, through the Umbilical Arteries, after the String joyns it; and therewith a kind of spirituous Nectar, or vital Spirit, which as it augments, nourishes, and vivifies all the Parts of the Infant it self, and puts them about their Actions, so also its Membanes, and this Bur∣den likewise. It is notably conspicuous about the 12th. or 13th. Week, the 3d. Month being endd, or
after Conformation of the Parts: Though its irst Delineaments and Threeds, or Form here∣f (generated together with the Membranes, f the courser Seed, of the Womans say Some, a ttle Fermented in a peculiar manner, by Ad∣ixtion of the Mans) appears like a Wooly ubstance upon the outside of the Chorion, a∣out the 8th. or 9th. Week: Upon which in ort Time, a red, fleshy, soft Substance grows y little and little, but inequally, and in little nobs, whereby it presently sticks to the omb, and the Embryo also by it, and is ept more firmly from falling out, which efore was wholly free, adhereing no where  the Membrane. The Figure of the whole Burden is usual∣ round, with an uneven Circuit (yet found xtraordinar and monstruous) is convex wards the Womb, and towards the Chorion,  Infant concave: Its Surface is wholly ooth, most like a Leaf of Navel-wort, a  Trencher or table Saucer; receiving the avel-String where it joyns the Chorion: And  thickest there, yet still thinner all round wards its Borders. To the Womb ward it is rough and in∣ual, through many Knobs, whereby it ad∣res to it immediatly, especially to its inner
Spungiosity, or the little Protuberancies, arise in it here and there the time of Pregnancy And through the mutual Accumbency an Adhaesion of These, the Womb transfuses fro its open Pores and Vessels, into the ope Pores and Parts of the Burden, the Alime¦tary Juyce, Blood, or what ever else is the I¦fants Nourriture, which also continues to flo several Dayes after it is brought away at L¦bour. This Side hath great Chinks in i which being cut, shews an infinite Numb of Fibres of Veins. The Place of Adhaesion, is almost ever t Ʋpper, and Fore-part of the Bottom of t Womb: Yet Some sticks to the right Side, So to the Left, and Some also Behind, accordin as the Conception tumbling loose to this,  its other Corner fixes. After it joyns to the Womb, and begins  encrease, it sticks toughly the First Month as unripe Fruit to the Tree; and so in t younger Abortions is ill to separate: Y thenceforth, the bigger the Infant grow, t riper and nearer its Birth, the easier it par from the Womb, and in end like ripe Fr drops from its Surface, together almost wi the Infant; and happy Labour where thus comes, for to Some it sticks till forced awa
yea whiles with much trouble, pain and eril. Its Magnitude and Thickness varies for the ondition of Bodies, the bigness of the In∣nt, and the Periods of Pregnancy: For in Abortions of 30 or 40 dayes, it scarce ap∣ears about the Roots of the String, which ardly then comes its length: Yet daily fter, it so gradually accresses and amplifies the Spirituous Blood being more copiously ffluent) that in end when at its utmost per∣ection, it is about a Foot, a Span, or quarter Ell broad, 2 or 3 Inches thick in the Midle yet Some are both larger, and thicker) thiner ll over, towards its Borders. It is mostly One in Number, even to Twins or More (yea when of different Sex, hough some make These have Each its own) or is so contiguous to Other, as to appear ut One: As many Strings being fixt in di∣vers Places thereof, as there are Infants (tho' whiles each Twin hath its separate Burden) dispersing throughout its Substance, innume∣rable Roots of Veins, and Arteries, with a marvellous Texture, and Net like Frame, which yet are held entirely separated Each from Other, both Veins and Arteries, in such sort, as the Vessels which serve to the Nou∣rishment
of one Infant, hath no Communicatio by Anastomosis, or otherwise, with these per∣tains to the Rest: Whence One of them may be some space dead in the Womb, withou hurting the Others; being thus lodged and nourished apart, and so living independent It receives small Vessels also from the Womb but are dispersed upon that side only next it. Its true Colour, is a darkish Red, some brighter then the Spleen, rarely Paleish. It Substance is soft, lax, brittle, full of Juyce Spungy, but wholly Fibrous. It is easily spoiled in Colour and Substance for Womens various Indispositions, ill Habits and the Humors fall upon it: Whence it i found softned, flaccid, hard also, schirrous glandulous: Some quite corrupt, stinking vilely: Some chattered in many Parts: Ye Some parched and dry, quite destitute of it Humidity and Blood: whence no marve that oftimes it be not brought away entire, and produce also such sad Symptoms. It serves for a Stay to the Navel Vessels (to the big Womb also) dispersed therein, unde which it lyes as a Pillow, called hence by some the Sweat-bread of the Womb: To con∣coct likewise, elaborate, prepare and perfite in a Special Manner (by Fermentation or other∣wise
the Blood and Galaxy received therein, and to seperate the more pure and spiritu∣ous Parts to the Infants nourishment; cal∣led therefore (as for its like Colour and Sub∣stance) the Womb Liver: and for its Figure, the Womb Cake, the 2din also, or After-birth, as coming forth with the Membranes in the 2d. place, or after the Birth: Some call it the Delivery, as compleating the same; giving whiles more work to its Extraction, then the Birth it self. To the Burden joyns the Navel string, a Membranous round hollow Duct, like a little Tryp or Rope, comprehending One Vein, 2 Arteries, and the Ourack (though Some will not have this come without the Navel) the Milky Vessels say Some, through which the Milky Liquor is conveyed, wrapt up in one common Cover (which also separates each apart by its Duplications, that they may not be entangled, nor broken) in which they go on, whiles well twisted together, and whiles it is orderly twisted therewith in Form of a Rope: Sometimes also it is wreath∣ed alone, these Vessels ascending straight at others sides through its Cavity to the Bur∣den: Which Some will have to continue and be unit to the Vessels of the Womb, and Some make them arise therefrom.
The Vein, much bigger then the Arteries, dispersing an infinity of Branches in the Bur∣den, (sometimes as soon as ever it enters it, sometimes not till it come to the midle there∣of) is thus conducted alongst in the String, through the Infants Navel, unto its Liver which it passes entire (though Some will have a lateral Branch go off into it, with some part of the Blood, for a speedier Increment, and better Disposition for its future Office) and is terminated into the Vena Cava, near the right Ear of the Heart; carrying the Blood to the Infants Bowels (though Some will have the Blood run from the Infant to the Burden, through this Vein, for that it grows first out of the Infant, and reaches thereto) straight through its Liver as is said, without any notable Alteration therein (which yet was formerly held to be infused into it, and there further elaborated to the highest perfection of Blood) into the Vena Cava, where it mixes with the Venous Blood, with the Chyl also say Some, made of the Liquor of the Am∣nios it swallows by the Mouth, falling in from the Subclavian Vein: That whole Mix∣ture going on thenceforth by degrees to the Heart, where it receives a new perfection of Blood, being therein conveniently dila∣ted,
rarified, and rendered thus more Sub∣tile and Spirituous, a finer and fitter Nou∣rishment for the Infant; and is distributed through its whole Body, with the Aorta, or great Artery. The two Arteries, arise from the Intern Iliack Branches of that great Artery (and oft from the extremity of it) up by the sides of the Bladder, and joyning the Vein, enters the String, advancing therewith (in the Man∣ner above-mentioned) through the Pores of the Membranes, up to the Burden, where they quite evanish with their little Branches, which are so platted, and conjoyned with the Branches of the Vein, as they cannot be easily distinguished from other: Carrying back the Infant's vital Blood residuous to its nourishment, driven on by its Hearts Pul∣sion, Or the Nutriment, which was carried in too plentifully to it by the Vein, Or the cruder Parts only; Where meeting with the Mothers Blood, separated into the Burden from the Arteries of the Womb (whether by meer Percolation, or some Fermentation also) eturns therewith again to the Infant, (after preparation in the Burden, and Nutrition here∣of) through the Navel Vein (where we see the Vein perform the Office of Arteries, as
they of Veins) still journeying thus, to and fro the Infant and Burden, without the least Interruption: Whence the Circulation is per∣formed, by this Pass and Repass of the Blood, and the Infant nourished by the Navel, and with Blood alone: Which yet others will have nourished with the sole Liquor of the Amnios alwayes, and by simple Apposition only while imperfect, Yet by the Mouth when perfect: Tho Some admit its Mouth alone ever. And Some also will have it nou∣rished with Blood, by the Navel when small, yet with the milky Liquor also, and by the Mouth when bigger (there being Chyl found in its Stomach, and grosser Excrements in its greater Gutts, chiefly the Right from the pub∣lick Coction of the Stomach) being of more confirmed Bowels, and needing a more plen∣tiful Nourishment, the Burden also being brought to a greater perfection, and the Lact∣teals produced the length of the Amnios, the milky Humor flowing more copiously thereinto; And so be nourished both by the Navel and Mouth, and to enjoy a double Aliment, of which mixed in the Heart a perfect Blood is made. And they also will have it get Growth and Nourishment at first, and before the sufficient Perfection of These,
while its parts are yet very small and im∣perfect, by the Remains of the seminal Mat∣ter while it lasts, and first by simple Apposi∣tion only, and after with some Part of it swallowed by the Mouth. Others make its Nourishment to be, First by Apposition of an albugineous Liquor, Ouzing from the Vessels of the Womb, imbibed by the Chorion, filtrated through the Amnios in∣to its Cavity: And Next, by the Same con∣veyed as the Blood, through the Burden and Navel Vein: Swallowing also by the Mouth, the more gross and terren Part of that Same (the finer being converted into its Blood) which could not be changed into Blood by one, or likely more Circulations, flowing out by the Infants Arteries, and discharg∣ed into the Amnios by little Branches thereof, dispersed therethrough, as they go to the Burden: And They make the Infant to be nourished these Three wayes, by one and the same Liquor. Some will have the Navel nourishment to cease, while the Infant begins to take by the Mouth: Others continue it still, for a more full and ready Provision, an easier Sanguifi∣cation of the Chyl, a better Ventilation, or Re∣freshment to the Infant by the long Circuit of
the Navel-Vessels, holding it to breath there∣by. Though Some will have it breath by the Mouth, the Air penetrating unto these Places: Hence Examples and Histories of its being heard Cry in the Womb, which Others will not have to be by the outward Air, be∣cause it can have no Access, but by that ad∣mixt with the Liquor, arising from its Fer∣mentation, and attracted with the Aliments: Or by an Airy Substance, or Nitro-aereous Particles the nourishing Juyces comes filled with. And Some again will not have it breath the Air, seeing there is no such plenty about it, but the Water it swims in, like as the Fishes; And the Water to make that here, what the Air does afterwards, a Motion to wit, Of In, and Exspiration. And Some will have Transpiration alone, and Ventilation of the Mothers Blood to suffice, without any Respiration in the Womb. And here Judges take Evidence from Physicians, if an Infant hath been dead-born, or Murthered after: or if it hath once breathed, and so is the Right Heir, in that the Lungs being cut out, or a part, and cast among Water, they in∣stantly go to the bottom as Mettal, it is held to have died in the Womb, and never brea∣thed: But if they swim above to have lived,
Though it is fit all the parts of the Lungs be thus tryed. The String hath several Knots in it, held to be a more fleshy, and gross Part of the Cover, and a wider Gap, whereinto the Blood being Suckt, stops from rushing in too great Plenty and Spait, to overwhelm the tender Infant (which yet losses much of its Impe∣tuous Force and Agitation, after it comes from the Mothers Vessels, in its distribution through∣out the Burden, and yet more in passing that most long, and broad Channel of the String, as from its Distribution through the Liver) whence it fills these Places, and renders them Varicous more or less, for their Repletion of bright warm Blood, Others make them little Glands or Paps, through which the Milky Li∣quor flowing, distils into the Amnios, appear∣ing as it were Bladders full of whitesh Juice. From the plenty of these Knots, Supersti∣tious Midwifes use to foretel (and an old Tale it is) the Number of future Off-spring, and if there happen very few (a String with∣out them is rare) such be sure shall never bear more: While yet there have been no fewer with the last, then with the First: And Some have had not One in the First, who next Year have had Twins. From their Di∣stance
also, they divine the Time between Births: And where the One sits close by the Other, Twins. From the Variety also of their Colour, the difference of Sex, as the Red a Male, the White a Female. And many things else they dotingly Clatter about the Infants Felicity or Mifortune. It is of a Conspicuous, but different Length and Bigness, yet is usually in a ripe Infant 3 Spans long, an large half Ell, or 3 Quarters; for preparation of the Blood, the Infants Skope in the Womb while it tumbles and sprawls about, its more Commodious Egress without breaking it, or loosing the Burden: An easi∣er Eduction hereof: for a greater Refreshment to the Embryo, as they who make it breath, drawing the Air by the Navel: And is the Thickness also of a Finger, for a due Capacity, and Strength to support the Vessels. It is variously Rolled, or twisted about as it goes to the Burden, that its Length might not be troublesome: From the Navel it goes over the Beast, from whence it is obliquely car∣ried over the right and left Sides of the Throat and Neck, turning it self back at the Hinder-Head, and so over the midle of the Fore-Head to the Burden. Sometimes also it encompasses the Neck like a Chain: And
some goes over the Breast, towards the hin∣der Parts and Back, and comes not to the Neck: Some also are found to go over the Breast and Head, and then winded about the one Foot. It is sometimes so long as to be carried out before the Infant, and is mostly then its Death: Whiles it is hanked about the Neck, and of∣ter then Once (yea now and then about its Thighs or Feet, and Such also give Doteing Women an occasion of Vain Prediction) whence the Delivery may be protracted, while the Infant is thus Hecked up in it, and cannot descend to the Orifice, nor be pushed out by the Pains: And is ready to be Strangl∣ed withal, if rashly pulled by the Mid-wife. If its Face be Red when born, it is good: If Wan, it is Deadly. In this Case also the String may break, or the Burden loose and separate, and a violent Flooding ensue. If it Hank about the Infants Neck in the Womb, it warms and Stifles, whether through want of Air, and stop of the Circulation, or Obstru∣ction of the Gullet, that no Aliment gets down, nor can it freely move it self. It hath been found with a real Knot there∣on having formed by its great Length a Circle Floting in the Waters, through which the Infants whole Body hath past.
After the Infant is Born, it is tyed and cut off, what is left must be dressed, as shall be directed afterwards, till it dry, or Corrupt, and fall away of its self (the longer or short∣er While it is in falling, the longer or shorter Lived, Women Prophecy the Children to be) and the Navel be formed, and solidated with a firm Skin. Thereafter the foresaid Vessels within the Infants Belly, turn into solid Li∣gaments, tying the Parts from which they proceed unto the Navel. CHAP. V. Of the various Situations of the Infant in the Womb. THis Diversity, is partly from its Self, partly from the different Periods of Pregnancy, and the approaching Labour. Infants of both Sex, are usually Situated in the midle of the Womb, it being but one single Cavity, distinguished alongst into a right or left Part, or Side, with a midle Line only, as it were a little out Seam (most rare∣ly divided with a midle Partition) without
any Cells, as in most viviparous Bruits, and which Some fancy in the Wombs of Wo∣men also, who bear Twins or More; tho the sole Burden to many Infants evince the contrair: Their several Bags serving for a divided Womb, or its Cells. But further. The ordinar Posture of the Embryo, or little Infant, for some Months (which yet va∣ries in dívers) is with its Head contained in the higher part of the Womb, its Arms and Legs contracted, its Knees close to the Guardies, and drawn up to the Belly: To These also its Head so far enclines, as the Nose may rest between them, with the Chin to its Breast: The Hands in Some are at the Knees, in Others placed upon the Breast, O∣thers have them folded; for in these is found some diversity: whiles also the One is lifted up to the Ear, or Temple, the Other to the Cheek. Its Legs ply back, its Feet are turned about inwards, in Some crossed; so that mostly the Buttocks may touch the Soles, more rarely the Heels: Whence some new born Infants have their Legs bent as Bows, their Feet wryed inward; which yet is easi∣ly mended after by right Tying or Swath. Its Back-bone is to the Mothers, and thus mo∣deratly bowed inwards, its Face is towards
her Belly (tho Some place Females contrari∣wise, and hence will have their Corps to flot it the Waters prone, the Males upwards) thus Crouching, and gathered into a roundish Fi∣gure, or Glob-like Situation, with its Members in a manner exactly folded, which it expli∣cates after by little and little, as it grows in Age and Bigness Sometimes also the Infant tumbles to the Sides, and gets as it were a cross Posture, which is discerned with the Womans hand, and by a Protuberancy, and Weight upon that Part. Afterwards, from the bigness and weight of its Head (which exceeds in Proportion to the Body) a natural Propensity and Instinct, it is carried and turned quite over (its Hands be∣ing shut) falling much lower, with its Head towards the the Inner Orifice, and Fce to∣wards the Mothers right Gutt: Preparing it self for a more ready and easier Passage into the World, against due Time (tho Some will have Females with the Face upwards, which if so, should be much bruised, and the Nose flatted over the Bones, the Chin al∣so stopped thereby: Neither thus could the Head be so effectually pushed on to the Pas∣sage as when the Matrix and Muscles of the Bel∣ley Contracts with Joint Force in the Showers
upon the Infants Back, which by this Situa∣tion resists thereto) And is the alone right, and natural Way of Birth (as is said) abso∣lutely necessar to a happy Delivery, both of one single Child, as also of Twins or More, tho They usually so incommode each other, and are so entangled, that the One comes al∣most ever in Some wrong Posture, and some∣times Both, causing thereby an unhappy Labour. This Turning begins from the 7th Month (tho Few turn so soon, and by great Acci∣dent if before) oftest in the 8th, Many a Week 2, or 3 before Labour, Some in the Time there∣of: Yet Some come unturned: Some also turn wrong. Nigh to Labour, it changes its Posture di∣verse wayes, while sprauling and swinging here and there it seeks out; bowing and bend∣ing its Arms and Legs more or less, carry∣ing them to this, or the other Side, as it is diversely excited: Hence such difference in this Matter, among Writers who haply have seen such Infants in Women dieing at such a Time; Some telling they have found the Arms, Others the Legs, in this, or that Place of the Womb, in diverse or contrair Postures. Some make Twins have a contrair Situati∣on,
and to sit alwayes Back to Back, the One looking to the Mothers Fore, the Other to her Back-Part, which is altogether uncertain, Witness Twins born with the Belly Breast or Faces together. CHAP. VI. What the Woman is to doe, when her Time draws near. SHe ought then (to scape Ship-wrake, so near the Harbour) be very curious of her Stir and Exercise (Such chiefly as are Crazy, or carry the more big and weighty Burden) industrously shuning all more Vehement and sudden Agitations of Body, hard and inequal Motions, steep up or down, all Laborious toyl∣some Exercise, Viol nt Stretch, rash Stumble, Fall, high Breathing and the like, which may soon make the Womb bear down, such an ap∣pending big weight, loose the 2din, so Ripe and ready to fall away, raise a Flooding which must quickly carry Her off, as hath happened to Some upon a very light Occasion:
may also cause the Infant turn, or come wrong, or before its Time. She must keep in full calm and Tranquility within, free of all Passion or Perturbation of Mind, chiefly Anger, sudden Fright, or Grief, which hath brought Labour (yea Death) upon Some in the very Instant. She must al∣so go in slack easy Dress, and beware of all Tempests or Intemperancy of the Air, use a mo∣derat Dyet, of good Juice and Temperature, good easy Coction, more Humid also and mo∣deratly Laxant, as Spinage, Lettice, Beets, Cole∣worts and the like, against her Constipation; for which She may use stewed Pruns with a little Senny, Cream of Tartar, Syrup of Roses Solutive, Manna, Cassia, Whey and the rest. Oyl of Almonds new drawn without Fire, or fine Oyl Olive, used some while with Syrup of Maiden-hair, or Violets, or with Manna, Softens and Lubrifies the Passes won∣derfully, facilitates the Labour (for which tosted Figs are used by Some) and much al∣layes the Grinding. Ʋnctions this while of the lower Belly, and about the Birth, going to, and rising out of Bed, does also mollify, Relax, and smooth the Common Pass, disposes the Same to an easier stretch and full Patency, the Burden also
to an easier separation; using Oyl of Lillies, that wherein the Flowers with the yellow Threads are infused, of Linseed, Almonds, fresh Butter, Hogs, Goose, Capons or, Dukes Greas and the like being chiefly necessar in first Labours, as where the Woman is very Young, well Old, Slender, Lean, or yet more Gross, who bear Seldom, and where the Genitals are any wise more Srait, hard, dry: For Whom also are appointed Mollifying and Laxant Fomentations (yea half Baths) of Lilly Roots, Leaves and Roots of Althaea, Mallows, Leaves of Mullein, Violets, Flowers of Chamemel, Melilot, Faenogreek, Linseed, boyled and ap∣plyed warm with a Spung, or woolen Cloath; or the Fume received through a holed Chair for a quarter of Hour: And were very need∣ful to such, for an easier Labour, and to pre∣vent any Lameness after. She may Bleed at this Time in case of Plethory, or any Peril thereof: Provide it do not much Fright, or commove Her, else in stead of preventing, it may procure an Untimely Birth. She must withall bespeak a Prudent Expert Midwife, who (beside Instruction in her Art, full Practise, and good Success) have born many Children (yea in Dayes of old become Barren after, meerly through Age) and so
hath Experienced in Her self the usual Occur∣rences of that Condition, it being easy to err in things not tryed: Who must also be fre∣quently with Her this while, especially in her first Child, and where She is more mo∣dest and Timorous, to advise Her right, and prepare her for the homely Conversation of Labour, and Whom She must call also upon the First stir of Pains, lest being surprized, She peril her Self, or the Child, as Some who are so sudden, or delay to send till they must bear alone, for all the hast can be made. CHAP. VII. What must be done, when the Woman falls in Labour. LAbour, or Travail is her Repeated Pains and throws in excluding the Birth: And comes not of the Curse alone, while sin∣less Bruits smart alike, many Dieing, especi∣ally of These who bear Mre than One at a time: But also from a Vast and Violent Di∣stentìon of the Genitals, the Inner Orifice and Sheath especially, which must widen to the
Infants Magnitude and Form: As from the close and ainful Compression, the Head makes of These Membranous Nervy Parts, against the Bones in passing: Whence the Labour Pains turn Extream, while the Head advan∣ces therein: And are held sorer in Women, than other Animals, because of the greater Bigness of the Infants Head. And Some im∣pute the Pains to the Ruption, and Separati∣on of These numerous little Veins, and tendi∣nous Nervy Fibrils, by which they make the Burden and Womb to be immediatly Con∣nected, and all in it supported and hanging thereto, as it were a Vault or Seiling: And the worse These are to break and separate from the Womb, the more it is pinched and torn, the harder is the Labour, the sorer the Symptoms. Yet now however, let all Things be order∣ed, and every Mean used for Her happy De∣livery, by an apt Posture, opportune Travail, the prudent Guidance of an Expert Midwife, who must have ready a Stool or Chair, Scizars, Spung, Tyes, and warm Lilly Oyl, or such like thing: And be assisted with other Women skilled in this Mystery: And with a Physician also in case of Difficulty, or need of Medicins. But further She must suffer no
exceeding Quality of the Air: The too cold constricts the whole Body, and the opening Womb: Hence in the Winter, and with a North-wind, are Labours said to be hardest. The Air too hot, enfeebles both Mother and Infant, raises Feaverish Warmth and Drought. Nor must She be in strait, or uneasy Dress: And seeing the Infant is to pass betwixt the Blad∣der, and right Gutt, a Vile perplexed Way, both needs be cleared; the Gutt of any hard crusty Excrements, which are as Bars therein, and by their Roughness and Inequality strait∣ens the Neck of the Womb, and makes the Infants Passage more hard. And for this a good strong Clyster is to be given (or more if needful) of Emollients and Uterins, which may rouse Her Pains withal, if small and slack: Or dissipate a Cholick, very troublsome then to Some: Yet must be injected ere the Child come to the Birth, or be most part into the Sheath, else it can get no access. The Ʋrin also must be rendered, and the Bladder emptied, for a roomer Pass, and to save its Ruption, the saddest Affliction to a Woman alive and irremedable, yet easily happens (it being Conjoined to the Neck of the Womb) through the Vehement Force, and hard Spurnings of a strong Child in wrestling
out; which hath been so Valid, as not only the Bladder, but even the Womb hath been found split, and its Head hanging out into the Cavity of the Abdomen: And happens the rather while highly distended by her more liberal Drinking and Retention of the Ʋr∣in: And if Diureticks withal have been gi∣ven to foreward the Labour: Yet comes whiles through a Widwifes Rudness about the Share-Bone: Or the Chirurgeon's Introducing his Hand or Instruments. She may also now Bleed in case of Plethory, or where the Vessels are too full and Distent, for Depletion, and that the Inner wayes may be enlarged, and a Feaver after Labour prevented It is best, She get not much solid Food the while, it disturbs Nature, cumulates Ex∣crements; but a little Alkermes from time to time, a Gutt Oyl of Cinamon, or Nutmeg, in some Cinamon Water, Syrup of Lemons, or Pomegranates: A little ponder of Cinamon, of Saf∣ron, or Tincture hereof in Broth: A Glass of brisk Wine, Brewed or Burnt: Or Some proper Cordial, which may powerfully Refresh and revive the Spirits, preserve the Strength of both Mother and Infant, upon which the stress of all lyes; may rouse withal and provoke the Expulsive Faculty to an easier Expedition:
Yet a fresh Egg may be given to the more feeble Travailers, a little good Flesh Broth, Juyce of Mutton, a Tost dipt in Wine, some Candle, or other convenient metalsome Ali∣ment, of good Juyce and speedy Coction; yet in Moderation, chiefly Wine and Spiceries, for Warmth or Feaver. She must in no wise be Urged to Prae∣mature or untimely Travail, nor preass hard at small light Showers, or with the Dryness, or Closure of the Womb, to exhaust that strength should bear Her out in Labour: Whence Many have Died in it, or soon after. Neither must She be Rudely handled about the Birth, or Share-Bone, in hard pressing, Violent stretching, Pulling, or Renting: Nor may the Bag be broken, unless it break not of it self in due Time, to wit, when highly distended and blown as a Bladder, or the Waters fully gathered and prest far down, and so the Infant wholly in the Passage. Nor yet may living Infants be Extracted by Force or before due Time. The Travailing Woman must not despond, nor fret, be Unruly, or toss and tumble rud∣ly or unadvised, to weaken Her, or change the Infants Posture, tho a sottish Ease and Quiet is as hurtful: But take good Heart, keep
Calm and Tractible, bear out her Pains with Patience and Courage, in the Hope and fair Appearance of an happy Hour: Resisting them strongly and thorow, as they return and wax sharper: Holding then her Breath, with her Mouth and Nostrils closed, to force more Vehemently downwards for Exclusion of the Cild: And must keep upright if She have strength, or pace about the Chamber, led and upheld with Some at each Side (chief∣ly short, Gross, mishapen Women, who speeds best if kept on Foot, till their Waters be brok∣en, or at breaking: Tho they endure better, if kept in Bed at the beginning, while their Pains are yet small and lent, and their Springs but gathering) yet may rest little whiles on Bed, yea and Napp a little if the Pains bear off, trying whiles the Stool, or Knee, or other∣wise, as the Mìdwife orders, who must still be near Her, diligently heeding her Gesturs, Natures tendency, and the right advance of the Travail, as her Showers sharpen and re∣doubles, her Whines and Moans converts into frequent, loud and bitter Cryes, with Qualms and Vomitings, and the rest formerly menti∣oned. Let the Midwife this while continue to anoint the Birth within and without, espe∣cially
if the Passage be strait, dry and wrinkly, through untimely Effusion of the Waters: Feeling whiles the Inner Orifice (tho as sel∣dom and softly as possible, giving such sharp Sense of Pain) the State of the Womb and of the Infant, how all things come right and makes ready: that the Membranes being split, the Waters sprung, and the Infant felt in the threshold of the Womh, straight upon its Head, which feels round, hard and equal, She may forthwith be placed the best Way for its Birth, which must be immediatly ex∣pede with all Industry, that being the proper Season, and Occasion never to be slipt, and delay dangerous, the Womb being oft as the Heavens with the Lightning, widely open and instantly shut: yet if She feels the Child come wrong, or any thing else strange in the Case, She must sist all forwardness, and quickly call what better Help can be had, lest tugging on thus with the Woman at Labour, still hop∣ing things will turn better, the Infant be con∣strained so far wrong, as makes much adoe to be rid, causes great Pain and Peril to both Mother and Infant, yea oftimes its Death, at least the crushing of some part or other.
CHAP. VIII. The Manner of expeding a Natural Labour, of one or more Children. THe true Waters being broke, the Infant felt bare, and all clear and right in the Labour, She must now have the best Posture for a fair Parting, or an easy and safe Delive∣ry, according to the Midwifes Mind and Ʋse, or the Place and Custome: Where Some go to their Knees, a Rude unsafe Way: Others more Robust, and accustomed to Travailing stand upright, resting there Elbows on a Table, or Bed-side, or with their Arms about ones Shoulders, firmly upheld at Back and Sides. Some are on a Quilt before the Fire: Others sit on Womens Laps, and the Husbands Lap in some Places. Most are on a Stool or Chair made for the purpose, covered, fitted and fenced with little Pillows and Cloaths, that the Travailing Woman may sit conveniently and not be hurt, or the Infant, if it happen to strike any where against it by the Mothers Pains,
or Motions: A Company of Assistents about, the Midwife sitting before her lower, to con∣duct the Infant straight down to the Gate, and softly receive it as it comes out, thus prudent∣ly to promove, yet patiently wait its Exclusi∣on: making no greater Hast then Good∣speed. Her Bed is held best by Some (in preventing any Hurt to be carried thither, tho more Vexatious to the Midwife) being well fitted to the work, and furnished with all necessaries, and She placed therein on her Back in a midle Figure, between sitting and lying, her Thighs being spread, her Limhs folded, or her Knees bowing to her Thighs, whereby the Womb lifting to the Abdomen may be direct a∣gainst her Mouth: her Heels also plyed to∣wards the Buttocks, which must be raised with a little Pillow for free recess to the Rump-bone, her Feet stayed to some solid thing: with strong Helpers about to stay her in the Showers, and the Midwife before her, who must speak her fair, to act what She can to the Exclusion of her Birth, by most vigorous Effort as the Shower return. The Bed how∣ever seems best for these more feeble and de∣licate, or who are sore Harassed in the La∣bour, for them also subject to large Spending, Fainting, or Swooning.
A hand may be held lightly uopn the Travailing Womans Belly, to help the Infant keep its ground, and with each Pain set straight down, and keep the right Path, else all Travail is to no purpose: For if its Head fall towards the forepart of the Share-bone, it can never get out till first the Head be raised a little towards the Mothers Back, and so di∣rected upon the true way: As also if it fall any way aside. When the Head approaches the Inner O∣rifice, the Midwife may gently slide up her Fingers therein, and softly stretch them round the Same as the Shower comes, to dilate it for making the way, and an easier entrance to the Head: Anointing also if needful. When the Head enters this Orifice, it is said to be Crowned: Being begirt round there∣with as a Circle, and is called the Crown, or Rose: Which the Midwife may softly shift back, piece and piece over the Head, to pass it out into the Sheath. As the Head begins to set without the Pri∣vities, it is said to be in the Passage, or Bones where Some sticks long, and oft Die, the Pains are then very sharp, and pricking, from the hard Compression against the Bones, the Violent Stretch, yea Sometimes Laceration
of these strait Parts, whereby Some are made all one there. Assoon as the Head comes out to the Ears, the Midwife (placed conveniently to receive it) may grip by both Sides, and pull it quick∣ly forth as a good Pain comes (for She must work nothing but with Nature) yet not straight on, lest the Shoulders stop if large, but shifting from the one Side to the other, for their easier, and more opportune En∣trance, which must instantly succeed in the Place of the Head, that the Neck may be free, lest stoping thereat, it be strangled. But assoon as the Head is born, she may hook her Fingers in its Arm-pitts, if so it seem good, and the rest of the Body will be thus easily drawn forth: Careful the mean while, no Part be entangled in the String, as also to turn it after to one Side, lest crying be∣tween the Mothers Thighs upon its Back, that Filth which flows down, falling into its Mouth might choke it. And now it remains only to free her of the Burden, which must be done presently after, unless She have more Children to bear, which is known by her Bigness, continuance of Pains (Some Travail whole Days for a 2d) the gathering of new Waters, with a Child presenting therein:
And then the Midwife must only cutt and ty the first Sring, fastening the other End to the Womans Thigh, proceeding on the same Wise to deliver Her of the Rest. Yet must not stir the Burden till they be all born, having usu∣ally but One and the Same in Common. CHAP. IX. How to fetch away the After-Burden. ITs Extraction must now be dispatched first of all, and together with the Child or straight-way after: Lest the Womb close, and to hast the Woman to her Ease and Rest. For which, the Midwife must wrap the String firmly about a Finger or two of her one Hand, and with her Other above That, take a single hold of it near the Privities, resting the fore-Finger of this Hand alongst upon it to∣wards the Entry, pulling thereby with both Hands, yet not directly, or with too much Force, lest the String break, the Burden or Womb be rent, or the Womb pulled out, a Flooding raised, the Soul and the 2din drawn out to∣gether: But very gently travers, hither
and thither, drawing still a litle more stongly, thus loosing the Burden piece and piece, be∣ginning from the Side it cleaves least. The Woman also may work to loose and expell it, by fetching and holding her Breath, forcing strongly downwards, provoking Vo∣mit (which yet seems to draw the Womb up∣wards) Sneezing, and the other different Motions and Agitations She used in expelling the Birth; which yet best foreborn where the Patient is Weak, or at least till Medicines by the Mouth preceed. If thus it loose not, the Place it sticks to, may be lightly pressed with a Flat Hand, rubbing easily down∣wards: And when nothing else can do, an Expert Hand must be Introduced, to sepa∣rate it wholly round, and fetch it sound and entire if possible: However, that no Part, or Skirt thereof be left, nor any Clods of Blood: which needs narrow notice, for sometimes a little Piece separates and stays in the Womb, the knowledge whereof is not so easy: whence many horrible Symptoms ensue, as great Pains, hysterick Suffocations, difficult Breath∣ing, Palpitations of the Heart, Faintings, Swoonings, acute Feavers and the rest, from its Corruption, and noisome stuffing Vapours: for which cause, should Women be very care∣full
and certain they void it, with the other Excretions in their Abortions of the first Moneths, when Midwifes are not by, or even when they be present; while the Infant comes away with some Membranes stufft with clotts of Blood: And if ought yet remain, it must be industriously expelled, by such Me∣dicines as are for hard Labours, or a dead Child; and the rather if it be Summer, or any danger of Malignity: Yet nothing too Vehement, lest a Flooding be raised which were ill to stop. It may be known that all is not come, while Labour like Pains and Showers continue after the Delivery, tho ligh∣ter: sense also of Heat and Pain is felt in the Womb: And a few Dayes after, a Vile Cada∣verous Smell exhales from thence. Twins, or More have usually but one Bur∣den, and is the same way to be extracted, to wit gently shaking and pulling it, now by the one String, then by the Other, whiles by Both together, Till it loose, separate and fol∣low: Yet must not be stirred as is said till they be All Born. With these Dtrections be sure the silliest Midwife, or experienced Nurse-keeper cannot Err to lay a Woman in a Natural Labour, where all goes fair and right: And wrong
Labours are of such perplexity, that the best ought not medle without a Physicians advice, well Skilled and Expert in the Case, where it can be had: Otherwise, Midwifes are forced to do there best alone, and after the Methods follows now to be taught in the rest of this Book. CHAP. X. Of the Causes and Cures of bad, and unnatural La∣bours. BAd Labours are either right, which Na∣ture Effects with some help, yet very Laborious, Painful, and Difficult: Or they are wrong, and contrair to Nature, caused by the Childs bad Posture, and is expede solely by Art. The Causes of such Labours, are either External, or Internal. These, are the Six Non-Natural things, or somewhat Contingent, as a Fall, Wound, Blow, or the like disabling Nature: the want, or unsskilfulness of asist∣ants,
chiefly an ignorant Midwife: to which is added the unfavourable aspect of Stars, chiefly of the Moon, Labours being made more happy in its encrease, towards, and at its full: And was prayed to off old for Help. The Internal, are from the Mother, the In∣fant, or Both: from the Things also contain∣ed in the Womb with the Infant. From the Mo∣ther, chiefly if Crooked, wry, Gibbous, or o∣therwise mishapen (tho Some make Gibbous Women to bear both bigger Children, more speedily also and easily, then the tall and straight; having more room below, and their Infants lying lower) when badly consti∣tute, Infirm, or lesed in her Lungs, Mid∣rif, or Muscles of the lower Belly (which Parts when sound, Contract strongly, and forewards the Infants Exclusion) whence the Showers are broken, and dies effectless: If She be small, Feeble, Delicate, very Young, too fearful of Pain: well Old, and not used to Bearing: If very emaciat, Lax, thin (too gross also and fat) kept under and spent with much Bearing, or the sore Symptoms off Pregnancy, or any great and acute disease, great Evacuations, penury Watchings or other Stress: whence an insufficient Influx of Spirits, Blood and Heat upon the Fibres of the
Womb, and Muscles which furthers the Ex∣pulsion. If her Pains withal be slow, sens∣less and Dull: Or if She have none: if they be also prevented, or exceeded by great Cho∣licks, from much Wind remaining in the gross∣er Intestins. Great Difficulty proceeds whiles also from the Womb alone, chiefly from its ill Shape, distortion, Obliquity, the Obturati∣on, Callosity, Contraction, Straitness of the Inner Orifice, Neck or Sheath; naturally, or after Tumor, Abcess, Ʋlcer, Cicatrize, or Ex∣cresence therein. Any Compression, from Ston in the Bladder, or repletion hereof with Ʋrin: Hard Excrements also, or Wind in the Gutts: Painful big Piles: Every other Promi∣nence of the Parts about, which may straiten the Wayes. When its Temperature beside, Functions and Offices are perverted: And (as sometimes) Convulsive Motions, and Hysterick Fitts arise. The hardness of Labour may be also from the Bones about, while so close and firmly Connexed, as they open very little, or not at all: Or if the Rump recede insuf∣ficiently backwards: But chiefly when the Share-bone, is too much depressed, the most frequent Cause here, and also incureable. This trouble may come also of the Infant, while a Female, so small and feeble by Na∣ture,
or Sickness, as it helps nothing (while a robust, and strongly kicking Male, is easi∣ly excluded) if badly Situat withal, yet worst if Dead. It proves also sore, where its whole Body, or the head only is over big for the Mo∣ther, and the worse the smaller and straiter She be: Or have Twins, or More of such lying to the Neck of the Womb, and seek∣ing out at once: Or (which is as bad) much entangled together, unfolding and stretch∣ing their Members about the Orifice: Or (yet worse and exceeding Sad) be sticking to Other, or to a Mole, or be One with ma∣ny Members, or any otherwise Monstrous or Deformed; of which and their horrible Variety Authors have write: But the most usual Difficulty upon the Infants part, is its Preposterous and Unnatural Form of Egress, and that more or less, as it recedes from the right and Natural. Sometimes the Mem∣branes makes the Lahour hard, while being too thin, the Waters full and strong, they break; and the Waters spring too soon, ere the Infant turn down, leaving it dry in the hour of Exclusion: In which case it readily Dies. Or then are so dense and strong, as the Infant can no wise break them: Labour
being in vain, while no Vestigies of Water appears. Beside, if the Burden stick too long after the Child: If also the Burden or String come first, or if this hank about its Neck. A difficult Labour is very fearful, for of∣times the Infant Dies, the Mother also may Die with it, and Both may expire together: And if it should not be present Death, yet there is danger of Swoonings, acute Feavers, Con∣vulsions, that Veins of the Breast, or Matrix be broken, that they fall in Consumptions, spitting of Blood, Cough: yea that all the Bones should be broken, as is observed to happen some∣times: Or that through too much Lacera∣tion of the Womb, Women be rendered Bar∣ren: Or lest through Straitness of the Sheath, or Bigness of the passing Infant, there happen one continued Cleft, or Rent from the Fun∣dament to the Privities, a noysome Latrin for the future: Yea also, that the Womb it self be burst asunder as hath been found, through the great Force, and strong Spurnings of a Valid Infant to be out. Some have the Apples of their Eyes dilated, and their Sight hurt: Others Labour with Dulness of Hearing, yea Some with Deafness, through that most Vehement Intention, these hard Efforts, and great Influx of Spirits. Sometimes the Peri∣toneum splits and they get Ruptures.
The Remedies must chiefly preserve, Re∣fresh and restore the Spirits and Strength of both Mother and Infant, such are the Aliments, and Cordials formerly mentioned for a Woman in Labour: must rouse also and promove the Pains, or irritate the expulsive force of the Womb, as most Antihysterick Medicaments or Preparations, Angelica, Gentian, Birthwort, Mug∣wort, Pennyroyal, Savin, Dìttany of Creet, Tro∣ches of Myrrh, Oyl of Amber, of Carvi, Briony Water, Tincture of Castor, of Safron, Borax also, the Volatil Salt Armoniack, yea almost all Volatil Salts, chiefly that of the 2din, yea the Powder, or any othet Preparation of it rarely fails: and if haply a 1st, 2d, or 3d, Dose succeeds not, a fuller may yet be given, and a Vein of the Ancle opened, and so it will here doe wonders: Yea averts the Grinding also in a peculiar manner: Yet foolish Wo∣men from some Superstitious Piety, uses mostly to have all cast away, Buried or burnt in the Fire. All Preparations almost of the Serpent, are held profitable also in hard Labours: And that which is most famous, the Gall with the whole Liver of an Eel, which yet Some have tryed with ill Success. The dryed Testicles of a Horse are also commended, as is Horses Dung, steeped
in Wine, and strained (whence the 2din also is expelled) Hauks Dung also, Date stones and such Others, the most approven, effectual and safe, in Powders, Potions, Mixtures: and first the more Gentle, then the stronger, as the Case requires. In cruel Pains a Plaster of Galbanum may be applyed: A Cataplasm also or Ʋnguent of the Juyces of Savin, Mugwort, Mercury, Leeks, Rue, Oyls of Wal-flowers, Poppies, Dill, with Galbanum, Myrrh, Dittany of Creet, Assa Faetidae, round Birthwort, some Cinamon, Nutmeg, Cloves, a little Safron, and Wax what serves. Such may use Sternutatories, of Roots of Pellitory, white Hellebor, long Pepper with some Grains of Castor: some Oyl of Amber may be snuft up the Nostrils: and in extremity, there may be a Decoction of Chamemel, Marjoram, Rue, Mortherwort, Pennyroyal, Mugwort, Roots of Birthwort, Dittaeny, Lillies, Althea, Seeds of Cumin, Carvy, Daucus, Dill, Fennel and the rest ap∣plyed in a Swines Bladder warm to the Birth. Great prudence however is necessar, Ingine and Judgement, to a right Exhibition of provoking Medicines, that there be chiefly a full Term, true Pains, an open Orifice, the Child near, upon the right Way, and Posture, and all in a readiness, else they are most Noxious;
still also the more mild and grateful, and as spare as possible: with regard also to any o∣ther Disease she may then have, and its contrair Judications, so as the greatest Urgency may chiefly be served. She must bewar of all hurtful Passions, which disturbs and dissi∣pates the Spirits: of extream Sadness especially, sudden Fear of terrible things, preconceived horror of Pain, of a bad Event, Anger, Bash∣fulness also: Whence Some more delicat, in their first Labour, being nice and averse at the Midwifes hands, and repressing their Sighs, Sobbs, frequent Exclamations, and some (otherwise) Immodesties usual, yea then very necessar, are thus more Pained, and less hap∣py in their Labour. Who therefore must be kindly Cherished and eased, have present pleasant cheery Company only, and intimate Familiars whom they choose: The Midwife also handling them with all the Sweetness, and Gravity possiible. Skilful Asistants does much in the Case, e∣specially an expert dexterous Midwife, she being Mistress and Ruler of all, whose prudent Conduct must shine, in opportunely ordering her Sitting, Standing, Rest, Motion, Meat, Medicines, Postures, Gestures and o∣thers, to a comfortable advance and Issue,
having ever the timely asistance of an exper Physician, or Chirurgeon: especially finding She cannot remedy these Accidents, and lay her Woman as soon as, or soon after her Wa∣ters springs The rest for removing Impe∣diments, facilitating and helping the Labour, are partly mentioned before, and comes partly now to be spoken of after. CHAP. XI. The way of manual Opera∣tion in unnatural La∣bours. THe true natural Figure of Birth is with the Head foremost, and right upon the Crown, the Shoulders following, the Hands adduced alongst the Sides, the whole Body after in a straight Line: and this is com∣mitted to Nature with the Midwifes Con∣currence, and is her proper work: but be∣side this, the Infant offers out several Wayes wrong, and in general upon any Part, or
Place of its Body before, upon any Place also behind, with the Side or Cross, and directly by the Feet (whiles by the one or both Hands) its hands stretched down upon its Thighs, which is made the next natural Figure: And to one or other of These, may the many particular and different wrong Figures be reduced, as they come nearer thereto: The principal only of which, or the more dangerous and difficult needs be mention∣ed; for who ever rightly performs These (prestable only by the Hand) cannot err in the Rest: rehearsing first the Operators neces∣sary Qualifications, with the Observations to be made ere he begin. He must then be Robust, Vigorous, Active Neat, shapely: having chiefly a small, smooth, straight Hand, yet strong, with long Fingers, without Rings, the nails well paired, and well anointed (for the Body he handles is tender and delicate) of a pleasant Coutenance and Hu∣mor, Calm, Patient, Grave, Modest, Secret, Pi∣tiful, Tender, (yet forbearing nothing need∣ful) Judicious, Prudent, Serious, advis∣ed, and a Man also of Letters (else a Butcher does better) still alike sober and wise: Conscientious also, undertaking only what He has skill of (for one Error in the Ope∣ration
may ruin all) tendering the life of both Mother and Infant in his Hand, the Poor a∣like with the Rich: and for his entire Per∣fection, very Instructed and Expert in the Mysteries of this Operation. He must however, wisely perpend the Event: For sometimes the Midmife Tugs on till the last, and keeps the Woman Labour∣ing at extream hard and violent Efforts, till all Strength be exhausted in both Mother and Infant, Nature quite broken and De∣feat, and desperat Signs palpibly appear, as a Languid, Inequal, Intermittent, but swifter Puls, a ghastly Visage, faint Speech, cold Extremities, cold Sweats, Faintings, Swoonings, Convulsions, Extasy, loss of Sense, Forgetfulness, Ravings and the like, And then the Operation would prove Labour in vain, and better foreborn: Yet in case there be any hope, or liklyhood of preserving Ei∣ther, it is better he try a doubtful Operation, then quite Both to certain ruine (Nature does wonders in extream Necessity, and sometimes These given over, as it were revives beyond all Hope and Expectation) yet still with Prog∣nostick of eminent Peril at best: and where he is sure of sufficient Strength to bear through, all dispatch must be made, lest it abate or
be totally dissipated, winning Her fairly to yeeld to this, as the alone Mean of Safety, her Circumstances being throughly pondered, and without which, the One, or Both must inevitably perish; And which he will also perform, with all Speed, Ease and Safety. In order whereunto, She is to be placed in Bed near the Foot or Cross, for the Ope∣rators readier access, with her Limbs fold∣ded upwards, her Thighs spread, her Heels reduced to her Buttocks, which must ever be made a little higher then her Head, (or at least her Body laid equally) when the Infant is to be turned inwards, or thrust back into the Womb, softly compressing the Belly up∣wards: But yet while it is to be drawn forward, or Pulled forth, her upper Parts must be more elevated, that She may the bet∣ter bear down, and concurr more strongly to its Extraction. There must be able Hands about, to raise her up, slide her down, shift and turn her this or that Way he proposes, and to keep Her stable in the Posture serves best his con∣veniency, the greater Facility and Surety of the Operation; while he partly shifts back the Infant, partly pulls it foreward, directly, or obliquely, this or its its other Part to a
better Posture, for which it is better, She be thus held at liberty, then tyed as Some ad∣vise; keeping her Thighs covered the while, for warmth and decency: Proceeding in the different Operations, as shall now be di∣rected, having first recited the principal Signs of a dead Child and the living. CHAP. XII. Signs if the Child be Dead or Alive. ASSurance hereof is chiefly necessar, whether Instruments be used or not; for beside the misery of killing an Infant therewith in the Womb, or fetching it alive, with Arms or Legs lopt off, a living In∣fant must ever be more gently treated then the Dead, where the Mothers ease and safe∣ty only is sought. The Infant dies by praeternatural Causs before Labour, or through a hard and tedi∣ous Travail, or then a praeposterous Figure: And appears also now to be dead, if it hath not been found stir for some Time,
even while all roborant and exciting Means have been used; yet had wont to stir fre∣quently before: Though some Infants have been whole Days alive after the Waters are spent, yet not found stir, through contracti∣on of the Womb, and their discomfiture. If the Woman perceives it tumble as a dead Weight upon the Side She turns to: If beside her Genitals feel cold, if She hath grievous sense of Cold in the Womb, or over the whole Body, without other evident Cause: If She hath great Pain and Weight upon the lower Belly and Privities (dead Things be∣ing ever most weighty) a continual desire to Ʋrine and Stool, while Nature attempts its Excretion. If moreover, her Pains slack and give over of a sudden, from Ces∣sation of the Infants motion and spurning. If the Burden or String come before: or if (putting up a hand after the Membranes are broken) the Infant be found cold, and of a cadaverous softness, no Pulsation felt of its Hands, nor yet of the String which beats stronger, the nearer especially to its Navel, but feels flagging and cold, soft, small, empty: Neither does it stir its Tongue when handled. If further, the Membranes of its Head, when now at the very point of Ex∣clusion,
be felt soft and slack, chiefly to∣wards the Crown, for how long they re∣main distended it lives: or if the Skull bones be open, waver, or ride much upon other at the Sutures. If again, the outer Skin separate easily from any Part of the Infant that comes forth: If withall, much stinking Filth flow from the Womb, as mostly in 2 or 3 dayes after its Death, if the Waters be spent, which else may preserve it from Corruption some Weeks: Though that faetid Matter may proceed from putrefaction of some Clotts of extravasated Blood only, which may remain in the Womb, with the Infant still alive. In this case also, one Infant may be dead, another living. Several griev∣ous Symptoms uses now to Infest the tra∣vailing Woman, which hath the account of such Signs, as Faintings, Swoons, Shiverings, Epileptick Convulsions, cold Sweats, and the rest; all which, if they continue any Time, carries Her off: And so the Corruption of the Infant, is the Cause of the Mothers death. Some make voiding of the Ordure an un∣doubted Sign of its death, Though others finds nothing more common in wrong Po∣stures, even where Infants are got alive: Yea Some will have all that come by the
Breech to void it, which yet is not found where the Passage is large, & the Infant small. There are yet other Signs much to be feared, especially when many happen to∣gether, as a Hurt, or Flooding, and not full Time, long sore Travail, with untimely Effu∣sion of the Waters, and dry Wayes: Exte∣nuation also, or flagging of the Breasts, a Belly more tumid and hard then usual; an ugly Complexion, languishing Countenance, sunk and troubled Eyes, pale Lips, stinking Breath, Head-ach and the rest: By all which we may gather the Signs of a living Child, being the quite Contrary: And chiefly if the Woman hath past her Course of Pregnancy, and come at her Labour in usual Health and Safe∣ty, and finds it then stirring, she may con∣clude all Right and hope a happy Parting. CHAP. XIII. To fetch the After-Birth when the String is broke. THis is held an unnatural Delivery, be∣ing with more Pain and Peril then u∣sual,
and not expede in the wonted Man∣ner. The After-birth is retained, through its fix∣edness to the Surface of the Womb (sticking whiles most toughly thereto, and not got a∣way but by Violence) while soaked also and swelled with a Spait of Humors, moved in a long painful Labour: Through straitness of the Orifice, tumefaction of the Genitals, their Dryness and Contraction, while it comes not straight way after the Child as it ought, but lyes writhed and plyed together in the Womb: Through outward Cold, sudden Fear, Terror, or other cold Passions, which have an auster and retentive Faculty: Through the Womans waywardness, who will not follow Counsel: Her want of strength to expell it while now the String breaks, being sore defeat in Labour: The debility likewise of the expulsive Faculty of the Womb: Some scents, whereby the Womb may be drawn upwards, or set a tumbling. The String breaks through its Weakness, Putrefaction, the swing of a big Child, or too hard pulling thereby at a fixt Burden: The Cut end may also recoyl into the Womb. If the 2din stick, the String being broke, the speediest and surest way of Riddance is
by the Hand, well anointed, and immediatly introduced into the Womb, while it yet re∣mains open for an easy Admission thereof, which else (in case of its Contraction, as soon happens) must be softly slid up therinto by little and little, the Fingers being prest together, and the Passage anointed, or o∣therwise prepared to a better dilatation, the Woman helping hereto, as to Excussion of the 2din, by forceing strongly downwards, and the other wayes by which She expelled the Child. The Hand being thus wholly entered (and fome Part of the Arm also) must be raised, to fetch away the Burden from the upper, and forepart of the Fund of the Womb, where it usualy sticks (for if it be loosed, it fluctuates only in the Capacity of the Womb, and will be found wrapt together in some Corner of it, where it feels like a little Bowle) and which may be easily discerned from the Womb, tho then a little contracted and wrinkly, by many little Inequalities, or Roots of the String thereon, if it break off so near: And being then certainly catched (for One must bewar to pull at the Womb in place thereof, as Some have miserably done) some Fingers must be put betwixt it
and the Womb, to separate it wholly round by little and little, beginning from the Side that sticks least, yet still very gently (for Violence must kill the Woman, and the Womb or Burden may be torn, or both drawn out together, or other horrid Symptoms procured) sound also and intire if possible; Yet leaving rather any Part of it grows to the Womb, then scrap or scratch the same, lest Flooding, Inflammation, Ab∣scess or Gangren ensue. Sometimes, the Operator can enter 2 or 3 Fingers only into the Orifice, and therewith he must grip an Part of the 2din, which presents almost e∣ver thereto (the Womb bearing down to expel it) and so pull softly thereby, but a little obliquely, and from side to side, careful to keep the first hold, till he can reach another Part higher, as He makes it to separate and follow; And so piece and piece, endeavouring in every hold he takes, a Part of the Membranes also be therewith, else it may break in Parcels, being so soft and brittle. If the Woman through weakness, or otherwise, cannot void it, or if through delay, or negligence the Orifice close, or be∣come too strait, so as no Hand can enter to fetch it, or if it stick so fast as cannot be
all got off from the Womb, without hurting of it, and so must putrify therein, then such Injections are ordered, as may promove its Suppuration, and loosening (which Some will have done most speedily, with the in∣jection of Basilicon diluted) may mollify al∣so and dispose the Orifice to an easier paten∣cy: With Detergents admixt, that it may come away as it putrifies: For which strong Gly∣sters also are used, yea Catharticks if the Wo∣man have strength: The provokeing Medi∣cines likewise, such as for hard Labours, a dead Child, stopped Courses or Cleansings. Some praise the perfume of an Asses hoof: tho the Hand is ever the most ready and sure Way, if it do without Violence: And Drugs inwardly, may make Feavers, and by provoking great and void Efforts, pro∣duce Bleeding, Fluxes, Inflammations, Descents and Prolapses of the Womb: Yet Some ad∣vise povoking Medicines, even after manu∣al Operation, for security, lest any Part or Parts thereof be left. Let the Woman this while use a good refreshing Dyet, Cordials, and Others proper to comfort Her, to pre∣vent or mitigate the Feaver, and other cru∣el, and diverse Kinds of Symptoms, which soon rage through the whole Body upon its reten∣tion
and Corruption, while putrid sharp Vapours fly up to the Bowels and noble Parts (in which Some will have sweet Perfumes con∣tinually used, yet so as they may not pierce the Nostrils) hasting still by all Means to rid Her clean thereof: Tho common Mid∣wifes, and several Writers think little to mangle the Burden, and leave Parcels, per∣swading patience only, till what remains may come away of it self: And Some lyeing, assures all is come with the Child, and so renders Women secure, while a great Part sticks yet in the Body, putting them thus in great peril, through the Mischiefs arises hence; whereby they live miserably a long Time after, and suffers either by Death, or torturing Pains. And grant, that Some have ejected it when consumed with Putrefaction, yea that Some one or other have kept a good Part of it several Months, yet felt little or no hurt thereof, and voided it also without any thing like Corruption, and nei∣ther any hurt after: So great oftimes is Na∣ture's Industry in preserving, as its power in healing: Yet best not trust alwayes to this Goodness of Nature, which by a most singu∣lar Rarity only, and worthy of all Observa∣tion, uses to work such a Miracle.
CHAP. XIV. Of bringing a Child Foot∣ling. THis is a hard, yet the best of unnatural Postures (all the rest being most pain∣ful) which Some make the 2d natural, for that the Infant may come thus whole and sound, to wit, by both Feet, the Thighs straight after, then the Belly, anon the Breast, at length the Head: Yet Such were called Aggrippa's, as being of a difficult Birth, for whether Males or Females, they come mostly upwards, and passes more hardly, because of the adhaesion of the Chin or low∣er Jaw over the Share Bone, and was also made alwayes an ill Omen, not only as to the Mind, but as to the Body likewise. This is placed the first of bad Postures, as being to most of them a Directory, and unto which all the Rest may be reduced more easily by the Hand, and the Children extracted that way; for however wrong an Infant comes from the Shoulders down, it is ever the best Way to turn, and bring it
by the Feet, as affording a better Hold for help, and so is more easie and safe to deliver by them, then by the Head, or any other Part: And to turn it from the Feet, in∣to a natural Figure, would prove a hard work, and give such Violence to both Mo∣ther and Infant, as they might haply die in the Operation, the Infant at least, might ly long Time after in the Passage, and cause a tedious perilsom Labour, yea never be born by the force or work of Nature, the Pains turning now quite faint and effectless, both being thus so sore defeat. Yet every wrong Birth formerly, was still to be reduced to the Head, and so made to come Natural∣ly, the Woman groveling, or tumbling in Bed, till it turn into a better form. The Infants wrong Posture appears, by the lingering dull Pains, which disperse not so effectually downwards and thorow, as when it comes right: And beside, if the Membranes be handled e're they break, no part of its Body oftimes can be felt, or if any Part be reach'd, it feels not like the Head: When also the Membranes are broken, after the first rush of the Water is out, the rest dribles away continually, till all be spent, and the Infant left dry, and never advances:
and though this may happen, even where the Child comes upon the Head, yet the Labour is ever then long and perillous, while it advances not with effusion of the Waters, whence it passes the Gliber, and the Labour is more easie and quick: A bad Posture may also be suspected, from the Infants vehe∣ment Motions before Labour, that it cannot place or keep it self Pron: as from the Mo∣thers impatience, or unruly Motions in the Time thereof, which oftimes turns it wrong, about to come otherwise very right. As∣soon then as the Waters are broke, and the Infant felt to come upon the Feet, an Hand must be softly introduced into the Womb (having rightly wrought the Orifice to a due Patency; for it may thus be dilated if strait, and without wronging Mother or Infant any thing, yet only to the Breadth, Nature's way, but not at all to the Length, lest the Ligaments be broken) to find Them, and draw it out thereby. And if its one Foot only present, as whiles, the Other plyed upwards, or turned some Way off from the Orifice, this must be sought, and fetcht to it: For though some Pains may haply set it on if near, yet both must now be brought to advance streight together, as
also where they stradle abroad at the Orifice: And the best way to get the absent Foot, s also to find they both Joyn the same Body which One must then be well assured of) s by passing up the Hand, alongst the Leg and Thigh of the Foot presents (to which Some will have a Ribban fastened with a run∣ng Knot, that so it may not be to seek again when the Other is found, and then returned out of the Way into the Womb) to the Twist, thence to the opposite and fellow Limb, straighting it down to the First, and then conduct both out together; griping after with both Hands above the Ancles, and keeping them also joyned, He may pull on equally thereby, piece and piece, as the Pain returns: And so still more upwards, by the Legs and Thighs as they are come at, till the Hips be got forth, and then taking good hold under the same, draw it so down to the beginning of the Breast, where the Arms must be taken (which are whiles turned aside, and Some have them raised above the Head, and such may be born thus, if the Orifice be more large) and stretched softly down alongst the Sides, that they may not be broken, and easily disengaged from the Passage, the One after the Other, hold∣ing
by the Hands about the Fist (though Some thrust up the One above alongst the Neck, lest the Orifice should instantly lock about it, after the grosser trunk of the Body is past, while Nature hasts to union, and so squeez the Throat▪ and strangle the Infant) careful above all, the Belly and Face be had downwards, or towards the Mothers back (else the Head may stop by the Chin, over the Sbare-bone) which may easily be placed so, if while One begins to draw it by the Feet, he enclines them, in turning by little & little, and the Body accordingly, as he advances its Extraction, till the Heels be where its Forefeet was, or look directly to the Mothers Belly: And if it be not altogether so when he hath drawn it to the upper end of the Thighs, or yet higher, He may then di∣rect his flat Hand to the Infants Share-bone, his Other holding its two Feet, and thus turn its Body by the Side it is most disposed to take that Situation, or be with its Breast and Face downwards: But be sure the Head and whole Body move and turn the same Way together. Yet Midwifes Works on the way it comes, and brings it with the Face upwards, and hath less peril where the Head keeps straight in the Way, and the Pains
are strong: But when it comes towards the Head, let the Woman bear well back, and let her Hips be raised also. The next Care is, that being thus drawn out to the hight of the Shoulders, they may also be made to pass so opportunely, at return of a Shower (the Woman then forceing strongly down∣wards) as the Head may immediatly enter their room, and the Neck not be locked in the Passage. Sometimes a big Head may stop for all this, after the Body is past: In which Case, the Operator must not pull hard by the Shouders only, to force it out, lest he make a separation: But softly rid it from the Bones, having a Finger or two of his one Hand in∣to its Mouth, his other Hand embracing the hinder Part of its Neck, that the Chin may be first wholly disengadged, and after, wile out the Head by little and little, with the Fingers of each Hand, slid up on each Side thereof opposite, sometimes also above, and sometimes under: making all the dis∣patch possible: For a small delay must strangle the Child. Here also, the Body through Putrefaction, or otherwise, may happen to be pulled away from the Head, which then remains alone
in the Womb, and is hard to be got out. Its Extraction is essayed, first with the Hand im∣mediatly introduced, pulling by a firm hold of the Jaw, which failng, the Instrument, or Crochet is tryed: To the most safe and effectu∣al using hereof, the Operator must have his one Hand within the Womb, to catch and stay the Head, and fix the Instrument right therein, and with his other, softly slip up the Same, alongst the inside of his Hand with∣in, keeping the Point close thereto, that it touch not upon the Womb: And being thus safely raised the length of the Head, he must turn it thereto, and strick it firmly in∣to an Eye or Ear hole, behind, in the Su∣tures, or where he can best: and then draw it to the Passage, where the Hand within must be retired, yet keeping still some Fing∣er ends upon the Side of the Head, the bet∣ter to disingage and set it straight out. The Head also may be kept from recoyling, with Hands held on the Belly without, com∣pressing the same from above, and at the Sides: carefull above all, that if the Instru∣ment should slip, it neither offend the Womb nor the Neck thereof, nor yet make any hurt in the Extraction. Some drives it to the Passage with a double Cloath put upon the
lower Belly, or the Hands flatted above o∣ther, that so it may be extracted. And Some will have it more easily and safely ex∣tracted, while closely embraced in the middle of a soft Fillet, or linnen Slip, of con∣venient breadth and length, and so draw∣ing by the 2 ends thereof together. Yet if this Head be so big, or the Pass so strait, as it can no Ways be got out whole, they order Pieces thereof to be cut off, or rather some of the Brains to be emptied by Incision, chiefly at the open of the Crown, with a crooked Knife, which Some think best for the purpose, when so short, as may be kept hid in the Hand within the Womb: Tho Others judge it more useful, Commodious and safe, having a long Handle, so as it may thereby be mov∣ed, governed and guided with the Hand without the Womb, to any Part the Opera∣tor pleases, in his turning, thrusting, draw∣ing, or slanting as is requisite: While di∣rected also in the Operation by the Other within. The Head however must first be extracted ere the Burden be stirred, if it yet cleave to the Womb: For so it defends it from hurt or bruise in the Operation, pre∣vents also a Flooding: But if wholly separated therefrom, it must first be rid out, and so the Head after.
CHAP. XV. How to do, when the Head thrusts out the Neck of the Womb before it. THis happens mostly, where the Womb hath born down before Conception, through the laxness of its Substance, in a Sickly State, from some causes: or through the exceeding Relaxation of its Ligaments: Whence the Neck of the Womb may now be forced out (for the Body cannot) into such a great length and bigness, as to straiten the Pass, and mar the Infants Egress: A total Pro∣lapse also, yea an entire Inversion may now ensue after Labour, if it be not more skil∣fully expede: And the Woman may soon die through Bleeding, Pain, Feaver, and the other Accidents which hence arrive. And therefore when ever the Sheath, or Neck of the Womb is found to press forth in great Wrinkles (this Midwifes call the Felt) be∣fore the Infants Head, as it advances, the travailing Woman must not walk, nor stand upright, neither use sharp or strong Gly∣sters,
nor have her Infant drawn by the Head, and the rest taught in a natural Labour (these here do hurt, endanger Descent or Prolapse of the Womb) but be laid equally at least in Bed, and so must force on the Child at each Pain, while the Midwife keeps both Hands about the Birth, to thrust back and bear up, by resisting the Pains as they come, the Womb only, yet make what way She can in the time for the Childs Egress: continu∣ing so to doe, till the Woman shall have al∣together of her self detruded the Child wholly: Yet if the Infant, having its Head thus born, shall now stop there so long, as to hazard its Suffocation, a 2d person must softly draw it on thereby, while the Mid∣wife thus carefully keeps back the Womb, which else may readily be drawn out with it: Against which also, She must be cauti∣ous and easie in extracting the Burden, And after repone and stay up the Womb in∣to its natural Seat, if it bear down.
CHAP. XVI. How to fetch a Child, when coming right it stops, be∣ing too big, or the Way strait. SOme big Heads, whose Bones are larger, or yet more perfect, and goes not toge∣ther nor yeelds in the Passage, sticks stedfast 4 or 5 whole Dayes in these Straits, and can no Wayes be got out but by Art: Where the Infant must certainly die, its Head being thus hard pinched therein so long, after the Waters are broke. Yet this is said to hap∣pen mostly in little Women (tho in Some larger also of the 1st. Child (and Some the 2d, if not more) especially when well in Years (or yet very young) for Such have ever the most tedious diffiil and dangerous Labours, and that by reason of a dry strait confirmed Pass, want of good Pains to wid∣en it, a Dead big Child, or yet some other Fault and Impediment in the Genitals. The Infant then is extracted with the In∣strument
or Hook, and fixt in some hinder Part of the Head, to draw it out straight as naturally, if possible: Or rather in the Pa∣rietal, or Temple Bone, with another in the opposite Side if necessar, to pull on e∣qually: For the other Place being under the Share-Bone, is near the Bladder, which is sore prest, and oftimes wounded or torn: Whence Some die, or never hold their Wa∣ter again. Incision also of this Head is or∣dered, about the Sutures, to empty some of the Brain, and so lessen it: Fixing the Hook after in the Skull, at the same Place: And this extraction of the Infant is allowed, even while alive; seeing it must inevitably die in the Passage however: Yea assoon al∣so as opportunity serves, for saving the Mo∣ther, who else must certainly soon die with it, having no other Way of relief and Deli∣very: Yet only in such Extremity, and after all Means and Endeavours are used, to quicken the Pains, widen the Genitals, re∣move the Difficulties of Labour, and have it brought with Hands, yet to no purpose.
CHAP. XVII. The Way of Delivery, when a Child presents the Side of the Head, the Cheek, or Face. ASSoon as ever an Infant is found to offer thus, let the Head be set straight into the Passage, not waiting a better Posture as Midwives usually: For though Some such like may in Time come right and be born, when more near the Passage, and the Pains are more frequent and strong, the Place moist and slippery, the Woman kept with∣all in a convenient Posture: Yet many Chil∣dren, and some Mothers have been lost by delayes: And Pains must otherwise drive it still further, and constrain it closer into this bad Posture, and so cause greater Diffi∣culty in its Correction, or Direction of the Head upon the right Way, as behooves e're it can be born, for thus it is impossible. Wherefore an Hand must now be softly put up betwixt the Infants Head, and the Side
of the Womb it lyes to, the Woman being placed with her Hips a little higher then her Head, and made to incline to the op∣posite Side, an Hand also helping upon the Place without: And in case the Head be wryed some more aside, and so closely en∣gaged, as it cannot thus be set right, the Hand must be reach'd up to the Infants Shoulders, to raise them a little back, by the one Side, or the other, as can best return the Head to the Orifice, and make it appear in a natural Form: Assisting with the other Hand as far as necessar: And then excite and procure its Birth, as in a right Labour. In this Manner also is the Delivery, when a Chid comes in the Passage upon the Face, with the Head pressed back upon the Neck, which Way it cannot safely be born, but must therefore be wrought unto the Crown to come naturally; and needs be done with all the ease and dispatch possible: For in that Posture, the Face soon becomes blew, black, and great swelled, as well by the hard and painful Compression of the place where it it sticks, as by the Midwifes rudeness in placing it right.
CHAP. XVIII. Of Delivery, when the Womb closeth about the Neck after the Head is born. ALbeit, where ever the Head passes, be∣ing big and round, the Body may readily follow, which therefore comes na∣turally foremost: whence its Name. Yet this may happen (though rarely) where the Shoulders are far big beyond the Head, when also they are not made to come immediatly into its room in passing: When the Mother beside, or the Infant faints, the Shower breaks, the Wayes are again straitned: If the Infant withall be dead some dayes in the Womb, for then its Head turns soft, goes together, and is longish in passing, and having no more firmness, cannot form the Passage so well to the Shoulders: Yea sometimes it is so small, as it neither opens the Wayes, nor can be got handled so easily and rightly as becomes. The Infant must now have speedy relief,
else it quickly strangles, while the Womb closeth about the Neck, and squeezeth the Throat, pulling it on by the Sides of the Head, or under the Chin and behind, by turns as it best advances; yet very gent∣ly, for Violence may pull it off: Careful the Neck be not in the String. And if thus the Shoulders come not, some Fingers may be hooked inwards into the Arm-pitts, and so pulled forward by little and little, and set free, which the rest of the Body then easily follows, unless monstruous, or (as happens mostly in this Case) blown up by Dropsy in its Belly, whence it becomes impossible to pass, till the Belly be pierced, and the Matter let out, of which afterwards. CHAP. XIX. Of a Delivery, when one or both Hands come with the Head, or when the one or both Hands offer alone. THe one or both Hands, are the on∣ly Parts presents with the Head, and
mars the Infants Birth, while so, part of the Passage is filled up, or the Head turned on one Side. The appearing Hand there∣fore (or both if they come) must be straight∣way thrust inwards, as much as may be, and turned down at the Sides: The Head al∣so, if turned aside, must be brought upon the right Way, into a natural Form, that so it may break forth in a straight Line: Or else, an industruous Midwife may receive and pass it, while both Hands offer in the Orifice, being conjoyned as close as can, and the Head straight between them, the rest of the Body after: And hath less peril, if there be good Pains, a large slippery Pass, and the Infant more small. Sometimes an Infant presents its one Hand alone, and is more usual: Or both, which is more rare: And Some the Arm as far as the Elbow, yea oft, even to the very Shoulder, as far as it can come; which is the most unhappy Posture of all, for that the Infant is most rarely ever got alive, espe∣cially if the Midwife make not timeous dis∣covery, but tamper on till it come the ut∣most length: Beside, that the Mother suf∣fers sore through difficulty and pain of the Delivery.
One must now straightway thrust back again into the Womb, this Member of the In∣fant (or both if they offer) with his Hand, passing the same under its Breast and Belly, up to the Feet (and Some have them now raised to the very Bottom of the Womb) which he must softly ply, and pull towards him, piece and piece, thus turning the Infant about, to draw it out thereby: And is held a more easy, sure and safe Way, then working to have it out in the natural Figure: Nor can it be brought safely the Way it now of∣fers, for tho these Parts appear, and seem to afford an easy hold for drawing it forth, yet being thus pulled Travers or Cross, it comes doubled with its Head and Shoul∣ders, whence the Arm may sooner be rent from the Body, then the Infant be so brought forth: Nor does it succeed when tryed, neither can it be tryed without the Mothers extream hurt: And tho Midwifes pull and works on this Way, yet whatever becomes of the Mother, be sure the Child is lost: Neither must one expect that the Infant tho alive, can by any Means be made to draw it in of its self, being once thus come out. Zarah's case is singular. Sometimes the ig∣norant Midwife works on, still thrusting up
the Arm, and letting it fall down again at each Pain, till it come almost to the Shoulder, and becomes so big swelled also, and the Body so closely engaged to the Passage, as it cannot be thrust back, as well for the great Tumour of the Mothers Genitals, as the In∣fants Arm; but must be taken off: In which extremity (if the Child be certainly dead, and it is good to Be sure) it may be twisted Twice or Thrice about, and so sepa∣rated from the Body, just in the Joynt of the Shoulder, with the Shoulder-blade, and the Body after turned and brought by the Feet. CHAP. XX. Of a Delivery, when Hands and Feet offer together. AS this way of Birth is impossible, the In∣fant coming double; so the presentation is more rare: And in which sometimes, the Fingers and Toe going down to the Orifice, are so mixt and pressed together therein, as they are not easily distinguished, feeling so
all of one Shape: Yet after the Womb is more open, and an Hand got up, they are soon discerned. And then the Hand may be directed to the Infants Breast only, which now is very near, and so gently straight back its upper Parts, towards the Fund of the Womb (which is almost done of it self, the Woman being duely placed) leaving the Feet at the Passage, where they stay ready to come: And so draw it forth thereby. CHAP. XXI. Of a Delivery, when the Knees offer. SOme Infants (though more rarely also) falls down to the Orifice upon their Bend∣ed Knees, with their Legs plyed back to∣wards the Buttocks: And here may One be deceived, touching but one of them, and tink it the Head, for its roundness and and hardness, especially while being at a di∣stance, it can be reach'd with a Finger end only: Though yet as the Infant falls lower, that it can be handled some better, the Part
then appears. And now the Knees must b thrust upwards, for an easier Explicatio and Diduction of the Legs, and a Finger o two, put under the Ham of the one Leg, pas∣sing the same down the back Side thereof piece and piece, till the Foot be come at, draw∣ing still somewhat squint, to reach it the better: Which being brought thus to the Passage, let the other be directed thither the same Way: And so extract it by both, as when it comes Footling. CHAP. XXII. Of a Delivery, when a Shoulder offers, the Back or Buttocks. FOr relief in these, the part presents must be softly thrust back from the Orifice an Hand introduced, and past alongst the In∣fants Body the Way may best reach its Feet, to turn them to the Passage, and so roll about the Infant and bring it forth thereby: And thus the Shoulder is the worst of these three,
being farrest from the Feet; beside that the Infants Neck being thus wryed, and its Head turned aside, it is more painfully constrain∣ed and lockt in this Situation then in the other. When it comes upon the Loins, Breech, or Ars-ward, it oftimes cannot be born so, and not unless it be very small, the Mother big, the Way wide: Yet is then alwayes brought with great stress, pain and detriment to both Mother and Infant: Which Way ought therefore to be ever avoided if possible: So that assoon as the In ant is perceived to come thus, the But∣tocks must be thrust back, an Hand intro∣duced, and slid up alongst the Thighs to the Legs and Feet, which One must work about to the Orifice, the one after the other, by folding, stretching, wagging, and draw∣ing them toward the Side, and still with all the industry and ease possible, lest they be hurt, or dislocated, if pinched too much, or winded rudely: Yet sometimes the Breech is pressed far down, and so strongly en∣gaged in the Passage, that it cannot be put back, but must be brought forth in this Po∣sture: Which yet hath great difficulty, pain and danger, wherein the Belly is so pressed,
that oftimes the Ordure is expressed: One may however help in this Birth, by crook∣ing some Fingers inwards into each Groyn, and so draw it through to the Thighs, and then by drawing and wagging it from Side to Side, disingage them from the Passage, as also the Feet and Legs one after the other, still careful of any hurt or Dislocation: Fi∣nishing the rest as Footling. When an Infant falls to the Passage upon its Back, the Body is folded inwards, and made almost double, its Breast also and Belly are so prest together, and the more if there be strong Pains, as it goes near to be choked, unless quickly turned to either end; for thus it can never be Born. CHAP. XXIII. Of a Delivery, when the Breast, Belly or Side presents. SOmetimes tho more rarely) the Infant offers upon its Breast, sometimes also it lyes to the Orifice upon its Belly, which
may be touched and the Navel also, the Hands and Feet raised up, or cast, and turn∣ed backwards; Wayes that Nature, and the Case it self shews it impossible to be Born: And are the most dangerous Postures of all, the most cruel and tormenting, in which the Infant soon miserably dies, being thus violently bended, and doubled backwards as into a Circle: Neither is it soon turned to the Head, or Feet, by the Chyrurgion, or Mid∣wife however expert. And the sooner also it dies, for that now the String mostly falls out, is cooled, compressed and falls toge∣ther; so that the Circulation is marred, and the Infant deprived of its vivifick Nectar, or vital Spirit. The sole remedy for the Breast or Belly, is to turn the Infant and draw it forth by the Feet, and that with all speed, being other∣wise thus sure to perish: Wherefore One must slid up his flat Hand to the middle of the Childs Breast, which he must thrust back from the Orifice, for to turn it (and is thus half turned already) passing up his Hand un∣der its Belly till he reach the Feet, and then bring them about to the Passage, and so draw it forth thereby. In like Mnner also must he push it a little from the Passage, if
either Side offer, enter his Hand, and slide it alongst the Thighs, till he reach the Legs and Feet, by which he must turn it about to the Passage, and so draw it forth: And are better Wayes of Delivery, then to turn it into the right Form of a natural Birth, as surer, and more speedily effected for the Infant who must needs die in these un∣happy Postures, if not thus quickly delivered. CHAP. XXIV. Of the Delivery, when se∣veral Infants present to∣gether in some of these different Postures. AS is the Case with one single Infant, so with Twins or more: For as that hath one truly natural Form of Birth, and many Non natural, so also they, and are both expede in the same manner: Yet the more Infants come to be born at once, the bigger also they be, the worse their Si∣tuation and Form, the more pressed and en∣tangled,
the greater is the difficulty, the pain and peril in Bearing. Sometimes Twins come both right, and sometimes they both come wrong: But oftest the first comes right, or by the Head, the second by the Feet, or other worse Way: The One also first advances to the Passage for the most part so far before the Other, as the 2d. is not perceived, till after the 1st. is born, that the Burden comes to be extracted: Yet they offer not alwayes thus to the Birth, nor can be born in the most convenient Or∣der, to wit, the Strong and Big making Way for the Weak and Small, the Living to expel the Dead: but still the foremost what ever it is, or that which lyes next and most commodiously to the Orifice, must ever come, or be brought away first, if it can∣not be born of it self: And that as soon as may be, for a more speedy relief to the 2d. in that ill Posture, which must now be brought by the Feet, without trying to place it right, though it enclined somewhat to the Head; unless the Pains continue more quick and frequent, the Woman more hearty, and while the first Labour hath been withall more natural and easie, the Way made large and patent: But usually, a Wo∣man
bringing Twins, is so discomfited with the Birth of the 1st, that She quite fails to hear of sustaining a new conflict, and pangs of Labour with a 2d, So that she hath scarce any Breathing from Pain (For Twins are born the same day, yea whiles the one at the others Heels) Whence she hath after no more Pains and Throws, or very few, these also very languid, and of no force to bear this 2d, which having also suffered much this while in a bad Posture, could hardly ever be born if placed right (yea, or yet now coming right) by Labour, or the strength of Nature, but lying too long by the Way, might die: Which therefore must be speedily turned, and brought by the Feet, especially if the Labour look tedious, or the Woman grow weaker: Breaking the Mem∣branes also if needful, that it may be go thus extracted. When Twins offer Hands or Feet toge∣ther, One must be sure the Bodies be not joyned, or any wayes Monstruous: And distinguish well the Parts belong to each that so they be not drawn at together, bu the One brought forth before the Other which He may do, in taking aside the righ and left Foot he finds nearest, and most for∣ward,
and sliding up his Hand alongst the Legs and Thighs, to the Twist if forwards, to the Buttocks if backwards, where if he finds they joyn the same Body, he must dis∣patch its Birth, whatever it is, as soon as pos∣sible, and just the Way of one single Child coming Footling: having put aside what ever Part the other Infant presents, for a clearer Pass while the 1st comes forth (yet a little only, lest relapsing into the Womb it should change into some worse Form) which be∣ing born, let the Other be straight way re∣ceived as it ought, yet must not the Burden be stirred till both be born, because of Flood∣ing, being usually but One. What ever Pars else offer beside the Feet, or however otherwise wrong Twins present, the same Course must be taken to their Delivery, as in the single Postures a∣bove mentioned; bringing that alwayes first which lye nearest and most commodiously to the Way, and readiest for Extraction be it dead or alive or however else.
with fix'd so low in the Bones, as it can∣not go back, without great violence and torment to the Woman, it is better to hazard its Life in coming so, (being most rarely now saved however) then destroy the Mother by working thus to turn it. The Burden may also separate and come first in Labour, tho more rarely, whence the Infants suddain Ruine, being suffocated for want of Respiration, which it immediatly needs, having no more Ventilation, or re∣freshing by the String and Burden: being smoothered beside, and drowned with a Span of Flooding, which is incessant, till the Womb be rid of all: whereby the Mother also is soon destroyed. And whiles the String hanks about the Infants Neck in the Womb, or some other Part of it, whence the Burden is continually drawn, and loosed by little and little before the time, if the Infant move but never so little towards its Egress, till at length it separate entirely: yea even before the Bag break. If the Burden present only, but comes not forth, and while the Bag is not yet broken, the Part of it which presents must be put a little aside, till the Bag come right: see∣ing the Burden cannot be drawn out with∣out
the Bag, which must then also be torn with the Fingers, the Infant turned and brought straight by the Feet, and the Bur∣den after: But if the Bag be quite split, and the Burden now fallen in the Passage, near almost come forth, which is perceived by its softness, the String also annexed, and the Womans great Flooding, it must not then be returned (much less when come wholly out) but brought forthwith away out of the Way, and the Infant straight after by the Feet (the only Way if any of its preser∣vation) even though it offer the Head: Not waiting to cut the String, till after De∣livery, for a more speedy dispatch of its re∣lief, and that the Womans Flooding also may be the sooner stopt; as comes to pass mostly as soon as she is Delivered. CHAP. XXVI. Of Floodings and Convul∣sions in Labour. WE have shown before in the 1st. Book, what must be done for relief, when pregnant Women bleeds any from the
Womb. But the only fit and safest Course here, in Case the Bleeding come of a sudden, be copious and incessant, a real Flooding which threaten Ruine to both Mother and Infant, is a speedy and present Delivery: bring∣ing the Child by the Feet: yea breaking its Membranes also, if the Womb be any little way open to have it thus extracted. Yet if her Bleeding now be very moderate, and begins only in the Travail, if the Woman also bear up, and have good strong Pains, She may be left to Nature's dispatch with the usual assistance. Convulsions also seizes Some in Labour, though more rarely, and may arise from too great plenty of Blood, carried to the Brain in the vehement Aestuation of Labour: From too great loss also of Blood: From a most grievous Pain likewise in the vehement and utter Distention of the nervous Womb: Yea, and the Tension of the whole Nerves, and more sensible Parts: As also from Irritation of some sharp Humour, or malignant impe∣petuous Vapour, which cruelly pricks, and bites the Nerves to a Convulsion. Convulsions in Labour are very terrible and dangerous, yea mostly the ruine of both Mother and Infant however they be caused:
And especialy the more numerous, frequent, and sore the Fitts: As when she gnashes her Teeth, fomes at Mouth and Nose, Snorts strongly, remains quite benummed and Senseless: For then the Functions of the Womb are perverted, irregular Motions pro∣voked, the Parts of the Body wrested and wryed with a terrible Concussion thereof: whence the Infant is suffocated, and killed in the Womb, or then She cannot bear it through Weakness. The only relief in this Case also is a speedy Delivery, and if the Womb be not open enough while they come on, She may Bleed in the Foot, and in the Arm if there be Plethory, use frequent strong Glysters till the Womb open that the Child can be got forth: proper Anodins also, and Emollients to appease the Pains, and so soften the Torments of the Labour. Some Spirit of Harts-Horn likewise, of Salt Armoniack, Oyl of Amber, and other Antepilepticks, or what else may promove the Labour, and divert the Vapors to the lower Parts. What proceeds from too much loss of Blood is incureable.
CHAP. XXVII. Of the Delivery, when a Child is Hydropical, or Monstruous. SUch being thus far too big for the Passage, the Birth or Delivery is impos∣sible, till 1st the Dropsy be let out: which is done by a single Incision, or Hole made at the Sutures of the Head, if the Matter be con∣tained terein (as is known by its bigness and distention, a separation of the Sutures, and distance of the Bones) and so lessen its bigness, whereupon the rest of the Body will be easily extracted, its other Parts being then usually small and much consumed. In like Manner also, must Incision, or a Slit be made in the Breast, or Belly, for Evacuati∣on of the Dropsy, if contained therein: as is known, while after the Head is born, no more of its Body can be any Way got forth. And this is allowed even while the Infant still lives, to save te Mother: Yet only in case she be brought in great and present danger of Life, and no other Way possible of her
Delivery and escape. If there be need also to Dismember a Monstrous Child, and lessen it for Extraction, or separate two conjoyned, let the Knife be directed just to the Parts must be taken away, cutting them off with all the Industry possible, just at the Joynt: As the double Bodies, just at the Place of their Cohaesion: Bringing them after by the Feet, 1st. One then the Other: And these are Operations of greater difficulty and La∣bour, then the former, and require more Time and Skill to the effecting thereof: Though Such also have been safe born entire and con∣joyned. The best Fashion of Instrument is mentioned already, as is the Way of enter∣ing and using the same, with the greatest surety, conveniency, ease and safety. CHAP. XXVIII. Of Delivering of a Dead Child. THe Labour with a dead Child is ever long and dangerous, and the Delivery never almost but by Art; for that it comes
most part wrong, and the Pains beside turn slow, weak, and quite ineffectual to its Birth; Yea readily gives over: So that it can only be got away with the Hands, or Instruments, whole or, by parts: And must be done as soon as can, yet only after all the more valid and vehement Means are used▪ to irritate the expulsive Faculty so much the more strongly, bring on the Pains for detruding the Infant mightily, but no∣thing avails hereto. In which Case, the Infants Head, though now it offer right to the Orifice, must be gently thrust back, an Hand introduced into the Womb, and slid all along under its Belly, up to the Feet, to turn them about, and bring it forth there∣by, as is formerly taught. Careful in the Extraction, its Head lock not in the Passage (the Breast and Face not being downwards) nor be separated from the Body, as may easily through its Putrefaction: And if the Head stick, not being thus directly right, the Body must not be drawn, till it be placed so, which may be done by putting a flat Hand upon the Face to cover its Inequalities, and help in embraceing it thus, to have it turn more easily into that Situation: With some Fingers kept still in the Mouth, to disingage
the Chin out of the Passage: Careful to cause its Body at that same time, follow the movement made to the Head. Yet if the Head be forced so low, and fix'd so close in the Bones, as it cannot be put back to have the Feet turned to the Passage, without great violence and torment to the Woman, it is then ordered to be pulled right forth with the Hook (seeing Hands can get no firm hold thereof, and being now certainly dead) easily past up betwixt it and the Womb, and that as high as can without violence or hurt, and the point thereof to∣wards the Head; fixing it firmly (that it may not slip or turn) into one of the Bones of the Skull, and rather behind to draw it forth straight; yet beware so of hurting the Bladder: Or (for a better hold) into an Eye or Ear hole, if it can safely be got so high, wagging and drawing it out piece and piece, keeping some Finger ends upon the opposite Part, the better to disingage, and conduct it thus directly out of the Passage: Removing also the Instrument piece and piece higher if needful, as it is drawn lower, till thus the Head be wholly disengaged and born: And taking hold thereof immediatly with the Hands only, the Shoulders may be
drawn into the Passage: Then sliding the Fingers of both Hands under its Arm-pitts, the Body may be quite pulled out, and the Delivery expede. If its Arm present up to the Shoulder, and so big swelled also, as it cannot be returned without great Violence, it must then be twisted off at the Joynt, and the Body turned and brought by the Feet. Though these Operations take place only, while no other Way or Mean is found for De∣livery, and then must be done to all possible satisfaction, CHAP. XXIX: Of Extracting a Mole and False Concepiton. ALL diligence must be given, to rid the Womb of such Praeternatural things, especially the Mole: And that as soon as possible, for the longer it stays therein, the bigger it grows, and closer it cleaves, the more it hurts and weakens, by reason of these wrackful Symptoms accompany. All Anti-Hystericks are used, and applyed
for its Expulsion, as what also expels the 2din, the dead Child, or helps in hard Labour (the Genitals being alwayes before that, fo∣mented and anointed with relaxant and soft∣ning Things) like as Phlebotomy, a small Dyet, and Baths: which things may readily work its Expulsion, in case it be but of an indifferent bigness, and that it adheres but little, or not at all to the Womb: For other∣wise, an Hand must be introduced into the Womb, to separate it therefrom being lmost ever joyned, and sticking immediatly to some place thereof, without Water or String) and that on the same wise, as the sticking Burden when the String is broke off: Using the Crotchet also, or Knife to draw it forth, or divide it if necessar, which yet is easily brought away whole, when once separated: But sometimes they are so confused together, as both compose but one and the same Body, and is then incurable, while it cannot be got off. The false Conception, from which a Mole alwayes proceeds, though much less, yet often perils the Womans Life, through that horrible Flooding it procures, and Incessant also, while the Womb continually enforces to its Expulsion: Which yet sometimes is
hardly got rid off, while so small, and the Womb so little distended therewith, as can∣not be thrust and compressed so strongly with the Impulse of her Throws, as when bigger. Neither sometimes can more then one Finger only. or Two be got entered (the Orifice usually opening in proportion only to the small Bulk it contain) with which One must labour to get hold thereof, and bring it clean away, with the Clods of Blood found there, whereby the Flooding will certainly cease: Or yet loosen it, that it may be expelled: Or that, being by this means mortified, it may dissolve after by little and little in Suppuration, which may be pro∣moved as in the 2din: And oftimes the Blooding ceases also when it is quite loosed. But if one Finger only can be entered, and this Flooding withall be so vehement, as may quickly kill her, the Instrument Crans-bill must be used, or a Forceps, to loosen and extract the same: Careful not to pinch the Womb therewith, conducting it up alongst the Finger first introduced, with the touch whereof, One may discern between this Con∣ception, and the substance of the Womb: Care∣ful also not to pull too hard at first, lest it rent, but a little obliquely, from side to
side, and that he keep the first Grip, till he get another higher as he draws it off from the Womb. CHAP. XXX. Of the Caesarean Section. IT is a skilfull, and dextrous Extraction of an Ifans from the Moters Womb, her to wit, who could otherwise never be delivered, or by no ot er Means exclude her Birth, then by a convenient Section, as well of the outer Belly, as of the Womb it self under it, and the Membranes; and so bring it forth indeed by her Side: And this without any peril of the Life of either, or both, in case they be not seized with some supervenient Symptom: preserving with∣all to the Mother for the future, her Fecun∣dity, or Faculty of conceiving intire. And under this is comprehended the like Ex∣traction of a dead Cbild from the Mothers Womb, while She cannot be delivered of it, neither by the Midwife, Medicaments, nor the more easie and surer help of Chyrurgery, and so remaining still inclosed therein, She is put in hazard of Life, yea lost, unless
succoured by this Section, the only Remedy and Mean of her preservation. And through the neglect of which in this Case, a great many as well of the lower, as higher Rank, are daily lost, being eviscerated, and mi∣serably butchered to Death by base Chyrur∣geons, who boldly try Experiments in the Operations of Art at any rate. They are called Caesarean Births, in imitation of the first Roman Emperor, to wit Scipio Africa∣nus, who for being thus cut out of his Mo∣thers Womb, got the Name of Caesar, though the Mother was there killed, and this may be done without her Death. These who urge the Belief and Practice hereof, as so very useful and necessar for the good of Mankind, seek to illustrate and make good the same, by many Reasons, wonderful Stories, and Examples of the thing it self performed with success: With Examples al∣so of the like, or a worse and more dange∣rous Operation, in the same Parts of the Body that are here to be cut, to wit, the Mus∣cles, the Peritoneum, and the Womb it self; or these near to them: Yea, in Some more noble, and more laesed, the Cure notwith∣standing of which succeeded happily: adding Stories also and Cases which hath happened
to the Womb, far more difficult then this Section, as that the inner part of its Bottom hath putrified, yea, and with such a great Ulcer, as dead Infants have fallen out there-through upon the Intestins, and ben drawn out by the Belly, yet the Woman recovered: As Others also, whose Wombs after Praecipita∣tion, and perfect Putrefaction and Gangren, or other Disease, have been totally cut away: Yea Others, from whom it fell away of its own accord, after it was very wasted and putrid, yet without Death, or other subse∣quent Disease: And many other like Stories. The thing however is commonly held false and impossible, and these Stories to be meer Fables, and the Imposture of their Authors, while the Practice of it had ever bad success, the Women still dying im∣mediatly, or soon after this Cruel and Fa∣tal Operation: and who could not escape, because of the big and irregular Wound must be made in the Belly, and substance of the Womb, And that Vehement and Mor∣tal Haemorragy must needs hence ensue, the Womb and its Vessels being now so vastly Turgid, and distent with Blood: Be∣side that the Cicratrize which comes on after the Wound is healed, would marr the
dilataion of the Womb to a new Birth: And so for these and other Causes, they cannot think of such a Cure, so full of danger, Terror, and Desperation: and which a pru∣dent Physician, who consults his own Cre∣dit, must rarely, or never try upon a living Woman. Tho yet when it is sure a Woman is already dead, or near to Death, in the A∣gony of it▪ and the Infant still alive, but all hope of Delivery tken away, this S ction is to be performed for its preservation, and that most quickly, all things necessar being got ready; for much lyes now in a few Mo∣ments dispatch: Nor does the keeping open of her Mouth and Genital avail. So that as soon ever She expires, let her Belly be cut down alongst, to wit, the Skin, Muscles, and the Peritoneum, yet must not the Intestins be hurt: Next the Womb, which must be lift up to be cut, lest the Knife might haply touch the Infant: The Membranes straight after, for remaining inclosed in these, it soon suffocates: And then let the Infant be immediatly taken out with the Burden▪ which must be nimbly separated from the Fund of the Womb. And now great care must be taken of the Infant, and Means use to recover it of its weakness, such as are
mentioned in the 21 Chap. of the 3d. Book, if there be Signs of Life; and sometimes it is hardly discerned if dead or alive, not any part of its Body being perceived to stir. Having thus briefly treated of Labours Natural and Unnatural▪ and of the best Wayes and Means of Delivery in either, it remains now to treat of the Government of Women in Child bed, and how new born Infants should be well ordered: As also of the vari∣ous Indispositions and Diseases of both, all which they must yet necessarly know that intend the practice of Deliveries, and shall be the subject of the following 3d. and last Book.
BOOK III. Of Women in Child-bed, and of Children new-born, with the various Indispositions and Dis∣eases incident to both. HAving already brought the big Wo∣man safely to her Port, unloaded also, or fairly twin'd her and the Infant, it yet remains rightly to order both, and shew the Mans, may best prevent and remedy the various Maes they are readily taken with in this new State: Beginning at the Mother. CHAP. I. Of Ordering a Woman new laid, and Naturally De∣livered. AFter the Infant is come, with all its Flitting, and so the Woman fully de∣livered,
a soft, thick plyed Closure, must be put warm to the Birth (being now so open and receptive of Cold) and Se then sweetly committed to Bed, ready warmed (for then also are Women not a little cooled) and duely ordered to her Case: laceing Her therein ust on the middle of her Back (tho Midwifes so usually lay her upon one Side, as to make a Proverb) her upper Tarts a little more raised, her Thighs and Legs stretched down (close together say Some, for fear of Col entring the Womb, and for a more speedy Union: Somewhat distant say Others, that nothing be stopt which should come out) with a small Pillow under each Ham: And so she lyes easier▪ Breaths freer, cleanses better, the Womb also thus settles best into its proper and natural lace. And being then a little setled after the grat commotion of Labour (Some say 7 or 8 Hours, Some even 2 dayes) She gets for her refresh∣ment, strengthening, and to hinder the Grind a little Caudle, Posset, Panado, simple Broth, Gelly, a Tost in Hippocras Wine, or the like, as She needs, and may safely take. Some order water Gruel, of 3 parts Water, and one of white Wine: Or of Water and strong Beer. The custome is to give new
drawn Almond Oyl, with Syrup of Maiden-Hair as soon as she is delivered, both for the Grinding▪ and for any roughness of her Troat with crying, and then an Hour or 2 after, some Brot▪ of Foul, Veal, and with Mut∣ton also, if nothing more grievous super∣veen: And Some give rather a little good Broth only: Some order Wae-shot in burnt Wine, or Julep of Roses, morning and evening if the Labour hath been long and hard. She is ordered after to darkness (Labour giving a great stress to the Eyes, silence and rest, in a Chamber well fenced from Air and Cold, with a Nurse-Keeper by her: Yet Some do not let her sleep till 4 or 5 Hours after, to be sure all keep right, lest chance∣ing to Flood, She fall in Swoon, yea expire as Some who were lft fast sleeping: or (as Some also) fall in dangerous sleepy Fits, by Reason of a long and sore Labour.
CHAP. II. Of Applications to her Birth, Belly, and Breasts. SOme Infants, of more big and confirmed Heads, does so extreamly compress and stretch the Birth or Genitals, in passing, as to cause great and painful Contusions, and Excoriations, yea sometimes Dilacerations thereof. To temper and appease these Pains, and prevent Inflammation, One may apply thereto, Oyl of Almonds,, St. John's wort, Roses, Chamemel, the white Oyntment, Nutritum, and the like: Or an anodin Oyntment may be applyed, made of fresh Oyl of Almonds, yolks of Eggs, white Wax, with a little Turpentine: And in case they be more grievous, some fresh Eggs may be beat with these Oyls, or with fresh Butter, and stirred over hot Embers into a Pultis, then laid warm upon the lower Belly and Privities, the Closures being first re∣moved, and any Clods of Blood left there. Some will have the bearing Place fomented 2, 3, or 4 times a day, for the 1st. 5 or 6 dayes, with a lukewarm Decoction of Barley
and Orpin Leaves: Or of Barley, Linseed, Chervil: Or of Marsh-Mallows and Violet leaves, adding Honey of Roses: Spunging softly, to cleanse them from the Blood, Clods, and other Filth, lest through too much Moisture, Acrimony, or Corruption there∣of, they Scald, Canker, Corrode or Ulce∣rate; changing the Closure also by that time it contract nothing of Stink. Some use lukewarm Milk only, and some Barley Wa∣ter: Though that Lotion is best forborn the 1st. 2, or 3. dayes, and to be used also under the Cloaths, that no Cold come near, or enter these Parts, then so very patent (there being nothing more mischievous) especially if the Season be more Cold, or the Woman tender and delicate, and after a warmer Labour. Let nothing beside be applyed, may cool or much commove her, to disturb, or stop her due Course of Cleansing: whence many grievous, and oftimes dead∣ly Symptoms: For which also let no Astrin∣gents be used. They appoint Astringent Fomentations also, or Lotions for these lower Parts, used Evenings and Mornings after perfect Clean∣sing, to contract their great Laxity and Distention, Settle, Fortify, and confirm
the same after such Violence, and dry up the remaining Moisture thereof: Made of Mil∣foil, Ladies-Mantle, Horse-tail, Mouse-ear, Plantain, Flowers and Peel of Pomegranates, Acorns, Cupress Nutts, Mirtle Berries, and other Astringents, prepared in Smiths water, or auster red Wine, or a mixture thereof: And with these are commended (who need or require them yet stronger) Fine Bole, Scaled Earth, Dragons Blood, Corral, Ma∣stick, Allom: Though such Preparations are rarely sought, or yet needed: For that the Womb instantly after Labour, betakes its self into its own place, begins to contract, and by degrees, as the Cleansings flow away, Clings and Crines (gathering to it self all its Substance) so that again in few Dayes after, 6, 7, 14. (yet Some far longer, for their Nature and Disposition, or in a more Humid, Lax, Sickly State) it returns to the former solidity and firmness, pristin Form and Magnitude, with a Cavity little enough: Its Parts also recover their former Integrity and Soundness of Constitution, as if they had never so gaped, or suffered any such di∣stention, unless it hath been more violent, or there be Laceration, great Excoriation, In∣flammation, or Ʋlcer: It serving for ordi∣nar,
to keep them dry and clean, well se∣cured against the least Cold. the Woman also in right Condition. As for her Belly, Some appoint the 2din. while yet warm from the Womb, to be instantly ap∣plyed to her Navel, and after it is removed, a Sheep-skin flaid alive, to be laid over her whole Belly, Loyns and Reins, or yet a Hares-Skin: And Some will have the Bur∣den applyed to the region of the Womb, espe∣cially in the Winter, and the Sheep-skin in the Summer: But this is not in use. She must have a Plaister of Galbanum to her Navel, with a little Musk, or Civet in the midle, though its Smell must not come at her Nose. A Swath and Bolster also, may be apply∣ed to her Belly, 4 or 5 hours after Delivery, or the next day: Where Some use a four plyed hand breadth Linnen only, which they pin but once only about the Belly, and chiefly the region of the Navel, that the Womb so vastly blown up by the Pregnancy, and dilated above it, may be easily reduced to its proper Seat, and the distended Belly also to its Amplitude and usual bigness. Some use Others, which they roll oft about, and place lower, therewith to support the
Womb, keep it unshaken, steady and even, without enclining, or tumbling to the one Side or other. It is best however, they be made more slack and easie, the 1st 7 or 8 days, chiefly after a painful Labour, else the Womb having suffeed great Violence and Compres∣sion, made sore and tender thereby, is now still much hurt, and must soon inflame by this close, and strait Swathing after. Her Breasts must be kpt very easie, close and warm, to prevent a Curdling of the Milk, or the other Troubles soon incurrs, when any way hurt, or yet exposed to the Air. It is best also, they be not Suckt for some dayes, till the Humours so vehement∣ly agitated, or jumbled and heated in the toss of Labour, be somewhat setled, and that more copious Rush of Milk, which then springs up, and so exceedingly pre∣vails in the Breasts of new laid Women, be also asswaged and spent: If there be danger of a too great reple∣tion, One may apply soft Rags, with Oyl or Oyntment of Roses, or Oyl of Myrtles, with a little Vinegar: Or equal parts of Poplar Oyntment, and Galen's Cer-Cloth: Or Ho∣ney of Roses, or of Mulberries, or the usual Wax-cloaths, and such like Anodin, gent∣ly
astringent and repercussive things She must feed also sparingly especially of things more liqid, careul withall to keep an open Be, and cleanse well, (a new laid Wo∣man being hed a great Ditch and Sink of Filth) that thus the Humours may be drawn downward from the Breasts into the Womb, and so be evacuated. CHAP. III. How to Govern Women in Child-bed, when there is no ill Accident. A Special care of such is very requisite, to secure against many unhppy Evil most frequently then befalls them, whereby all Joy for the born Child is marred; and that not only by reason of the Labour it self or of the Womb and after Purgations, and others peculiar only to Child-bed, but ever through the least neglect and Error in th Tenaing: and by these also which may seiz them at other Occasions, though now mor acute and grievous: Yet the chief care i
against a Feaver, to which they are then so subject, as it is usually said to bear a Child, is to be sick of a Feaver; and must fall in with more vehemency and peril, after a hard Labour: Yet if it be not great, one needs not much fear other Symptoms, altho terrible: For Some suffering most griev∣ously, have been oftimes quickly restored. They must therefore forbear the more strong and solid Meats, Spieceries, Wine: Chief∣ly they in the first Child, beyond Others who are more secure of the Event: And at least while the Feaver of Milk is imminent and lasts, which ever happens the 2d, 3d or 4th day, while they are concerned for Suckling the Child. And is whiles very sore, continuing mostly till the 9th, when it usually goes off with Sweating: Being distinguished from the Putrid, in that thir Breasts begin to fill with Milk, have hardness, Pain and weight; there is a weight also and heat of their Back and Shoulders: And the Purgations flow rightly, which most rarely happens in the Putrid. They must al∣so feed sparely, of a small simple Dyet, chiefly where the Labour is more cruel, and the Event more doubtful: As thin Water Gruels, Oat-Meal Caudles, Panado's, Broths
made of Foul, of Veal, or yet Mutton, with Barly, Currans, Raisans, Asparagus or Cichry Roots: Gelly with a little Saffron: Or a Caudle well Boiled, of whole Water, half Wine more or less, and Yolks of Eggs: Which may also he mixed with some Chicken Broth. Drinking Ptisan, of Grass and Altaea Roots, with Liquirish and Aniseeds: Or Wa∣ter boyled with Cinamon: Or Decoction of Barley with Syrup of Maden-hair: Or boyl∣ed Water, with Juyce of Oranges, and a little Cinamon: Or the Decoction of Mugwort and Maiden-hair, Vervain, or Mother of Time, with a little Wine or Broth: Or a small Rhenish or white Wine Posset, or yet of Sock, if they be weak, and without Feaver, and the rest which may promove the Clean∣sings, prevent Feaver. They must be spare however of Drinking the 1st. 7 days, for their Breasts: And have it also lukwarm, for ex∣citing grips: Forbearing all things notably Cold, too cooling, or acid, more hot also, o vehemently warming: As all things binding. When all trouble of the Milk is over, and that Feaver truly settled, they may have at Midday, a little of some more solid Meat, yet rather boyled than Rosted: Advan∣cing after to their Restauration if no com∣plaints
occurr, in the Kinds and Quantity of Meat and drink, both at Supper and Dinner: Yet still according to their Strength and Condition (by which the Indication of their Dyet must ever be regulated, which is still to be such, as a Disease may never either hence arise, or yet augment, and that Na∣ture be still stronger then the Meat, and not the Meat stronger then Nature) the Season also, their Constitution, Custom, manner of Delivery and the like: Whence Some may take solid Meat once a day, from the very 1st 8. or 10. hours after Delivery, and some may safely take the double, twice also to Others once: And Somes Meat, may be O∣thers Poyson: Yet a spare small Dyet is securest for all, of convenient juyce and Temperature, of good easy Digestion, rather little and ofter, till all fear of Feaver be over: For Experience testifies how sore back casts many Women get through mi∣stakes, and too much indulgence herein, even after they appeared past all the dangers and troubles of Labour. She must ly well warm in Bed, especial∣ly in a colder Season (for the Air now easily enters the empty Womb) very still and quiet in a right Posture, that the Womb may
settle the better, keep calm and tranquil in Mind, free from Concern or care of Busi∣ness: secured against Anger, Fright, Sur∣prize and the like (For Some alarms at eve∣ry Triffle) and especially, that they get sea∣sonable, full, tranquil Sleep, a safe Mean to preserve Health, and prevent the Gene∣ration of Diseases, and of greater power to recover and restore the Spirits, then Meats or Drinks of the highest preparations. There must be no Company, or Comering, especially during that Feaverish Emotion of the Milk: Nor must their Body Cloatbs be rashly shift∣ed, till after the 1st 5. or 7 dayes. It is best also they get Passage each 2d or 3d day, using Glysters for that effect, of Milk, or the Decoction of Mallows with Sugar: And make chiefly a due and natural Cleansing. Then after 2 or 3 Weeks, more or less, for their Nature, Custom and Disposition, when perfectly Cleansed and recovered, they may gently purge off what Impurity yet remains in the Body, and could not be carried out by the Womb: Yea (to accomplish their Purification, and make every white clean) bath and wash once and again: And so after live as they list.
CHAP. IV. How to put away the Milk from These who give not Suck. IT is alike as to this, whether the Milk be made of any sort of Blood, as was held of old: Or of Chyl, Crude, or yet Pre∣pared, and precipitated, or filtered from the Blood in the Arteries, or then separated by some Acid Liquor or Ferment: Or if made of both these together: Or of the Chyl∣ous Juyce, and a Serous part of the Arteri∣al Blood: Or of some Arterial and Nervous Juyce: Or if it be a lymphatick Liquor, discharged into the Breasts, and filtered from the Glandules, and driven forth from the Paps, through the Milky Channels, or what else. To put it away, some Things are apply∣ed over the Breasts, which are Astringent and Cooling, may somewhat contract the Vessels, and Pores of the Glanduls, straiten and stop the Milk Passages, impede a sepa∣ration and afflux of the Milk: Such already
mentioned in the 2d Chap. Linnen also wet in Lees of Red Wine alone, or mixt with Oyl of Roses: Or wet in the Water or De∣coction of Ladies Mantle, Horstail, Plantain Juyce of Medlars, dissolution of Allom and the like. Others again are applyed to resolve, dis∣cuss and dry up the Milk therein, as a Pul∣tise of Bean Meal with Oxymel, or of the other Meals also and a litle Cumin, boiled with the Decoction of Sage, Chervil, or Rue, or with white Wine, adding Oyntment of Althaeae, and Oyl of Chamemel: Or yet a Cercloath of white Wax, Whale-shot, Galba∣num, Saffron, and Oyl of Almonds. Some apply Honey only, and to make it an effectu∣al Remedy, lay a Cabbage leaf therewith, a little deadened before the Fire: Or make a Pultise also of the Cabbage Boyled, and Oyl of Chamemel, The Ceruss Plaister is used, as is Diapalma, and Diachylon: A Fomenta∣tion also of Sea Water: Or of an equal mixture of Wine, and Water of Rue, with Venice Soap. Nothing must be applyed vehemently cooling, or astringent, or too deeply repelling: It is safest also that 1st rush of the Milk be softly Suckt, or Milk∣ed out, and after by degrees, Restrain. Re∣pell,
or discuss as shall be requisite: still careful of the least Cold in the application or removeal: For that any outward Cold, (as all actually cold things, is extreamly hurtful. She must the while use a spare small Dyet, less Humid, forbeariug Broths, white or small Wine, and other things more Liquid, must also drink little, else it readily encreases. And be sure above all, She makes an ample Cleansing, which carries the Humours more downwards, and may be much advanced by ftequent Glysters. Some in the mean while advise Cupping Glasses to the inner part of the Thighs and Groyns, and above the Na∣vel. CHAP. V. Of Child-bed Cleansings. THey are held to be Blood and Humours Issuing from the whole Body, but chiefly and immediatly from the Pores and Vessels of the Womb, being amassed therein during Pregnancy, and Suppression of the Courses, and wherewith its Spungy, soft, more porous and thick Substance is filled,
and its Vessels also distended, and rende∣red so very big and turgid, chiefly as the Labour approaches, by that abundance of Blood, which they then carry and contain, that being laid open, by separation of the 2din. there gushes out pure, most florid Blood, as in all other great Wounds, and the very same with the rest in the Body: There∣after (this abundance soon abating) that which is feculent and pale, loseing by degrees its Redness, and growing still more Pale, and discoloured: Which venting also still less and less, clods in small Drops upon the Mouths of the Vessels, beginning now to fall toge∣ther, and stops them; whence the most Se∣rous Part, or Bloody and very pale Serosities only is evacuated: And in end (the Vessels being near intirely closed) a white Ichorous Purulent Mtter is excerned. And thus, all that is discharged, which would molest not the Womb only, but the whole Body also: Whereby Women then are so fair and well favoured. And thus also it is known, that there hath been a due and sufficient Purgation after Labour, while there comes first pure Blood, most plentiful, then a feculent and scarcer, lastly the purulent, yea this some∣times more copious. Some make this latter
Evacuation the meer Moisture, and super∣fluous Humidity, which transudes the Pores of the Womb, and the Vessels newly closed, acquiring by the Heat of these Places, a Con∣sistence somewhat thick, and that more or less, for the manner of vent, and its stay therein. Others make it the Humour which affords the Crystallin Liquor to the Infant, for that the Womb may be seen not whol∣ly red and stuffed with Blood, but with other Humours also: Beside, that in most new laid Women, it vents with their ease, rather then hurt, so that it would bring on alike ill Symptoms if supprest: And to be either at least excerned in place of the Blood, in These exhausted of it, or evacuated alone, which in a natual State, uses and ought to flow together with it, from which it then receives a Tincture. Some make it the Breast Milk, being as it were Milk, and the Milk usually abating in proportion hereto, And this Evacuation also soon drying up by Sucking the Breasts, And which may also flow by the Womb. as the Courses have come by the Breasts, tho most rarely. The Cleansings however, ought to flow naturally, most pure florid Blood some while at first, and more copious (tho all are not
herein alike) yet still discolour and dimi∣nish by degrees, till they quite cease: And continue to Vent the while freely, without any stop: Be of an equal Consistence also, and without Acrimony, ill Scent or other strange Quality: Flowing beside with ease, in moderate Quantity, and Just Continu∣ance, according to Womens various Conditi∣ons and Circumstances: Yet sometimes they are notably vitiated, through a bad Dispo∣sition of the Place whence they flow, their manner of Vent, and mixture of other Impu∣rities and Corruption, there Stay also in the Womb after extravasation. Whence they are whiles Blackish, whiles pale, greenish also, whiles thinner, whiles more gross and Lum∣py, whiles acrimonious or soft, whiles also stink more or less strongly: Yea Some have them so stinking and sordid, as they seem worse than any other Disease: And signify mostly the Corruption and putrefaction of some Substance left within, the Suppression or retention of these Purgations, whence they putrify: Or that something is torn and sepa∣rated in the Infants passage: Of all which it is fit to make mention. But the two chief Vices of the Cleansings to be mentioned, are an im∣moderate Flux thereof, and their Suppression.
CHAP. VI. Of Floodings, or an immode∣rate Flux of the Cleans∣ings. THe chief Causes are, Dilaceration of the Veins and Arteries in the Neck of the Womb, in the violent Labour of a big Child: a rash violent separation of the After-birth, and tearing of the Surface of the Womb, and its turgid Vessels, so many and so pernicious Wounds: The Laxity also and too large Apertion of these Vessels: The im∣petuosity of the Blood in a full Body: Its acrimony, thinness and fluidity, while much agitated, heated and rarified in a cruel La∣bour, or by Meats or Medicines unskilfully used at that time: The laxness also, or debi∣lity of the Womb after such a a Labour, which cannot therefore contract it self: Any strange Body lodged still in its Cavity, be it a piece of the Burden, a false Conception, or yet Clods of congealed Blood, making distention, Pains and this copious Bleeding, while it works for Expulsion thereof.
This is the most dangerous and dismal Accident of any, and hath most quickly dispathed Some (and who seemed very happily laid, yea for all the Helps could be used) through an immense Profusion of Blood, the treasure of their Life, streaming out with some violence: yea Some while neither Midwife, nor any by did advert: And this Cause of their Death, the Bloody Bed they lay upon did well discover. If it be more moderat, yet continue long, it becomes incureable, or is with great dif∣ficulty stopt and dryed: And soon makes Cachexy, Atrophy, Decay, an ugly Complexi∣on, continual Whites, oedematous Inflati∣ons of the Legs: And oftimes a Tympany, or deadly Dropsy of the whole Body, chief∣ly in an unsound Constitution, Elder Age, and after many and hard Travails. It is not so fearful, from its Quantity and Conti∣nuance (for Some Bleed a space, and more copiously, without great Peril, while Others are suddenly extinct for the various Cir∣cumstances) as from its uneasiness, and wrackful Symptoms, to wit, the sudden Ruin of Strength and Appetite, a languid, intermittent, yet swifter Pulse, Vertigo, dim∣ness of Sight, tingling of the Ears, Faintings,
Suonings, light Convulsions, Lethargick sleeping, and the rest. The Cure lyes in stop of the Blood, which being the treasure of Life, must by all Means be saved: Tho yet a rash and too sudden stop, hath been very pernicious, and pro∣duced a Rose, Tumors, and other Preternatu∣ral things in the Womb, Distention of the Belly, Pains under the short Ribs, hard Breathing, Suffocation, future Barrenness, and Death not seldom. The prime Intentions are, to temper and lenify the Blood, cool and incrassate the same, allay its Praeternatural Effervescence, stop its Impetuosity, that the Pores of the Ves∣sels may not be so strained by its vehement Aestuation: Heal and consolidat the Excoriati∣ons, fortify the laxer Parts and Vessels of the Womb and the rest, as the different Causes require. In this case, the Woman must ly equally flat in Bed, very still and calm, and be kept somewhat cool. Useng the more easy things at first, while the Flux continues moderat, the Blood gross and party-coloured, and She weakens not much: Such as Panado's, Gellies, Rice, or Starch, with Broths of Veal Feet, or of Rams Head and Feet, or of
Chickens, boyled with Sorrel, Purslain, Plan∣tain Pimpinel, St. John's wort: Rosted Chickens also, boyled Pears, Quinces, old Conserve of Roses, Emulsions, chiefly of Barly and Almonds: Caudles boyled of Rose and Plantain water, Eggs and auster Red Wine: Pap of well steeled Milk, with Meal of Wheat, or Rie, Beans, Rice, or Starch: And others such things, cooling, incrassant, drying and astringent, of an Emplastick and styptick, Faculty: Drinking Claret with Water, wherein Mastick, or its Wood hath been boyled, Iron or Gold oft quenched: Or the Water alone: Or midle Ale, wherein Leaves or Seed of Plantain, of Sorrel or Dock hath been infused; advancing by little and little, to things stronger if needful: using Glysters also, if it appear to be maintained by hard Excrements, or Wind in the Gutts. And ridding the Womb especially, of any thing may be left therein to cause it. If it urge vehemently, and turn extream∣ly perillous, as is known by her Pulse, and o∣ther Actions of Life, an incessant violent Flooding of pure florid Blood, Medicines are hastened more potently astringent, inward and outward (regarding its stop only, for that it threatens Death most quickly) these
in Juleps, Powders, Opiats, and receiving chiefly, Waters of Frog-spaun, Plantain, Red Roses, Water Lillies, Poppies, Milfoil, Knot∣grass, Horsetail, Ladies Mantle, Tormentil, Sheepherds-purse, Purslain: Syrups of Corral, Quinces, Comfrey, dryed Roses, unripe Bram∣bles, Myrtles, sharp Pomegranates: Powders of Salt Prunellae, Bole, Blood-stone, Dragons Blood, Corral, Pearl, Cochinel, sealed Earth, Balausts, Crabs Eyes, burnt Harts-horn, Grains of Kermes, Troches also of Amber, of Earth of Lemnos, of Spodium, binding Crocus of Iron, Extract of Comfrey, Acacia, Hypocistis, Conserve especially of the Field Ro∣ses, Conserve of Comfrey, Marmalat of Quinces, Confection of Hyacinth, Rob of Sloes, and the rest: Yea the same Blood instantly dryed in an Iron Ladle, and given in the raw Yolk of an Egg. And if any great Heat accompany, Acid Austere things are the best. There are extern Applications about the Region of the Womb, as a Spunge boyled in strongest Vinegar to the Share-bone, Linnen wtt in Oxycrate (cold if the Season be very warm) to the Loyns: Astringent Fo∣mentations also, the same mentioned in the 2d. Chap: of this Book, used scarce warm,
or almost quite cold: And of the Astrin∣gent Powders may Ʋnguents be made, with Oyl of Myrtles, of Mastich, and the Coun∣tess's Oyntment. Cataplasms are likewise laid about the lower Belly, Share and Loyns, of Bole, Earth of Lemnos, Chimney Soot, Mill Dust, Dragons Blood, Mastich, Magi∣stery of Lead, Acacia, Spiders Webs, Pla∣ster, and the other strongest Stypticks and Astringents, incorporated with Juice of Plantain, a little Rose Vinegar, and Whites of Eggs. Defensive, Contra-rupture, and others Astringent Plaisters, are also applyed. Some use Asses, Some Swines Dung. Vulnerary and Astringent Injections are conveyed into the Womb, Astringent glew∣ing Pessaries put up therein, which yet can only touch the Vessels in the Neck of it, without reaching the Fund, if it bleed from thence. There are yet Frictions, and pain∣ful Ligatures of the upper Parts, Cupping Glasses under the Paps, and to each Hypo∣conder: Suaths to the Belly. In end, while nothing avails, She is to be laid on fresh Straw, with a single Sheet, or red Leather only, and Bleed in the Arm by little and little, and with stops.
She may this while smell to Rose Vine∣gar, or Wine, and take a little of this also in case of great weakness, (tho otherwise Some forbid it) take more frequently also, some good Broth with Gelly, and at whiles the Yolk of a new laid Egg, a Crumb of Bread in Wine, or such like mettalsome re∣freshment: And if She sleep (which were best quite debarred while She bleeds more ve∣hemently, tho Some will have it more pro∣found, as sifting all Evacuations save Sweat) let One attend her Pulse and Respiration, lest She sleep to Death. What Clods of Blood withal, may stay in the Womb while it stops, and there make Pain and Distention, must be timely had out, for worse Effects: Yet most warily, and with great ease, lest other∣wise the Bleeding be moved of new. Some have a Flux of Blood by the Nose, but not, except when they have born a Son. CHAP. VII. Of the Suppression of Child-bed Cleansings. THey are quite stopt, or either are in less Quantity, and shorter while than
ought. The Quantity and Time varies, for the Season, the Countrey, Age, Constitution, Temperament, Habit of Body, manner of Liv∣ing, the longer, or shorter Apertures of the Vessels: Thus Some Cleanse very sparely, and without any notable hurt, as robust and Laborious Women, or These who live hardly: Such also, who have had any extraordinar Evacuation in, or before the Labour, or are in other bad Circumstances: Others again purge largely enough, and in notable abundance, as These who fare rich∣ly, are more Plethorick, and in the better Circumstances: And for the most part, the Measure hereof, answers the Courses, that such who have few of These have little also of This. Moses orders 30 days Purification for a Male, 42 for a Female: Hippocrates admits almost the same difference, which yet must be understood in some other Sense, or else Women in these Eastern, and far hotter Countreys, as Judea and Greece, undergo much longer, and far different Fluxes, then with us, where none Cleanse more then a Month▪ for either Sex (tho Some make it to be larger, and longer, after a Female, then a Male) and with Many it is over in
15 dayes, with Some in 7, with some also in the 3d. and that after Females: And albeit a while after, there remains some moistness, yet no manifest Evacuation, except in the Whites, or in Some also who use Copulation too soon, especially if ofter, and more ar∣dent; whereby they come to have conti∣nual Voidances, with a great weakness and weight of the Womb, a good space after: And still the longer, while they abstain not: A great marr to Conception. And what is said, must be understood of perfect Labours, for the younger and smaller the Abortion is, the less must the Cleansings be. A sudden and total Suppression is rare, and not without manifest hurt and pe∣ril (chiefly in the beginning, when they are in greater plenty) producing fear∣ful and Truculent Symptoms, and Tragedies through the whole Body, while they be∣gin to putrify, rage and sharpen: As pains and weight in the Head, Redness of Face, trouble of the Eyes, Frenzy, Con∣vulsions, Palpitations of the Heart, Faint∣ings, hysterick Diseases, Obstructions of the Bowels and Vessels, difficult Breathing, Loathings, Vomitings, distention of the Belly, Feavers almost malignant, and with the
worst of Symptoms, as frequent Chilness, great Ʋnrest, Repletion of the Head, Op∣pression of the Vitals, a languid Pulse, Stupor and the rest. From Stagnation also, and Corruption of these Impurities in the Substance and Cavity of the Womb, arises Pain, Infla∣flammation, Abscess, or Schirrous Tumor therein: And sometimes an incureable Cancer: Inflammations also and Apostems in the lower Belly, Abscesses in the Breasts, Inflammation of the Lungs, Quinsies, Plu∣rifies, Pains in the Loyns and Groyns, Scia∣ticks, Lameness, Scabs, malignant Tumors, and all the other Evils accompany supprest Courses, The Impurity thus dispersing through the whole Habit. The chief Causes of their Suppression are, a dull Ferment, the grossness, Viscosity, and slowness of the Flux, Obctruction of the Vessels stufft therewith, a Part also of the Burden remaining fixt, or a Mole cleaving to the Womb, or clods of Blood therein: The Womans restlessness also, and frequent tossing or tumbling in Bed, a Feaver whence soever superveening, vehement Perturba∣tion of Mind, being commoved with great Anger, or strick with Pannick Fear: Other
great Evacuations: Astringent Medicines un∣skilfully used: Cold also entering the Womb, constricts and shuts the Mouths of the Ves∣sels, coagulates this Flux and quite stops it: As does Cold things taken inwardly: A cold Shift, or Sheet may procure the same, especially if any thing moist: And may happen likewise, while Some being weary of Bed, especially in the 1st Child, they rise too soon, goes about to colder Rooms, and so catch Cold: whence also Pleurisies, Rheums, Coughs, in which the more soft, delicate and warmer kept, suffer soon∣er, and sorer, then Country or common Women. We have shown already the best Go∣vernment in Child-bed, for her right Cleansings and a happy Issue thereof: how∣ever in this Case, the Womb must be rid of any Preternatural thing therein, the viscous, gross, or grumy Matter must be attenuated, rarified and resolved, the Uterin Parts mollified, and relaxed, the Ways made pa∣tent, and the Humours carried downwards: For which there are opening and solvent Glysters, Fommentations also to the Privities and lower Part of the Belly, with Woolen Cloaths, or Spung, of the Decoction of Aro∣matick
solvent Plants (these chiefly called Uterins) such as, Malves, Althaea, Pelli∣tory, Rue, Feverfew, Penny-Royal, Calamint, Savin, red Mugwort, Flowers of Chamemel, Melilot, Daucus Seeds, Roots of round Birth-worth, of Briay, and the rest used in pro∣voking the Courses. There are Applications beside about the Privities, in form of Un∣guents, Plaisters, Perfumes, Pessaries, of Things which have sharp and penetrating Exhala∣tions, are Fragrant and Odoriferous: As Galbanum, Ammontacum, Sagapenum, Assa Faetida, Musk, Zivet, Castor, and the like. Uterin Glysters also, hard Frictions moreover of the Legs and Thighs downwards, pain∣ful Tyes af the Toes, Cupping glasses to the Groins, or inner Roots of the Tighs, and to the Haunches. Bleeding is added as a noble and choice Remedy in such Cases, first in the Foot, or Hamm, and after (if that do not, and there be suspicion of Plethory) in the Arm; and Some forthwith superadd the Other thereto: And Some will have bleed∣ing in the Arm to precede, in Case of Plethory, or stagnation of the Blood about the Womb, Or fear of Inflammation there: And Some appoint this Bleeding only in Case of Plethory, or hot burning Feaver, which yeeld not to other Helps.
She may this while use Broths and Ptisans, with the opening Roots, Capillaries, Mug∣wort, Marigolds, Cinamon, Saffron, Cicers, Madder roots, Liquorish: Posset of Mug∣wort, or Penny-royal water: yea stronger Things also if needful, as Aloes, Salt of Am∣ber, Troches of Myrrh, Castor, in Garlick, Leek, or Savin water: Or decoction of Ju∣niper: And others also which are said to have a Specifick or peculiar Property to drive out the Birth, and After-birth: To which if Sudorificks be added, they may cure the better. She may also Purge gently a Week after Delivery: Yet regard must still be had to the various Symptoms which may accompa∣ny, and the urgency thereof: For if the Woman suffer little or no detriment, There is less to be done, especially if she give Suck. CHAP. VIII. Of the Prolapse of Womb and Fundament. THe Womb is said to change its situati∣on, while it ascends, reclines, or de∣scends. Of this descent there are several
Differences or Degrees of more or less only, for sometimes the inner Neck only falls upon the Privities, at other times the whole Body or Fund of the Womb falls down upon the Sheath, yet comes not out, and in its Bor∣der appears the inner Orifice, as it were the Nutt of the Yard with a manifest hole, which sometimes falls without the Privities, yea is inverted, as likewise its Fund, hanging down like a Man's Codd, or ones Head; in Some to the very Thighs: And then there must be also a Soution of the Connexion of the Neck. This falling of the Womb is said to pro∣ceed, from Disruption of the broad and chief Ligaments, implanted into the Fund thereof: And that by any external violence, hard and inequal shakes of the Body, great Stret∣ches, Strains, or what else makes cruel Compressions, Concussions, or forcible De∣pressions of the Womb, especially when very big and heavy: As vehement Coughing, Sneezing, a Fall, Blow, Leapings, Dancings, running too steep up or down, Vocifera∣tions, lifting of a more weighty Burden, and violence of other Chances: but most∣ly it follows the most heavy Carriage and grievous Weight of a bigger Ani∣mal or Twins, sore and unnatural La∣bours,
chiefly where the Child lies wrong, or does otherwise hardly pass; being, mov∣ed in extream Efforts and strong pressing downwards to exclusion of it, or of-the After-birth: Yea with such force whiles and vehemency, that it is driven out. And then it comes of a sudden, hath greater pain, and is oft followed with a Flux of Blood. It may happen also through a rude, violent and rash Extraction of the Child, or of the Burden when it sticks fast to the Womb, especially while an unskilful Hand being put up to loose it, pulls the Womb in steed thereof, as Some have done: As from Me∣dicaments likewise preposterously given to expell them: And sometimes from vehe∣ment Commotions of Mind. The Ligaments of the Womb are also spoi∣led and remits, and its substance becomes lax and weighty, and so slips downwards in a sickly State, or while affected with a cold and humid Intemperature, or soaked with a Deluge of Whites, or snotty Pituitous Matter, from plenty of like Trash through the Body, in Women given to Cups, a more gross and moist Dyet, day Sleep and what else promoves a Catarrhous Disposition: And may happen likewise through a tedious
Looseness, with great Pain and Needings: A cold moist Air also entering the Womb in Child-bed, and the like: And then it comes by degrees, and after a longer time, and hath less Pain. A bearing down, or falling out, may happen to any Woman, even Virgins, tho more rarely: An intire Inversion never, save immediatly after Labour, the Orifice being then only so widened and open, as to let it out▪ which at other times remains shut. The Malady is obvious to the Senses, both seen and felt: And makes beside great Pain in the Reins and Loins, a weight also in the lower Part of the Belly, and upon the Privities: And where there is a Rent, Corro∣sion, or any Putrefaction, a Bloody sanious Matter evacuates. It is a frequent, most miserable irksome trouble▪ marrs Walking, Coition, and convenient vent of the Courses. And if it hang long or far out, it tumifies and inflames by the cold Air, hath great Heat and Pain, from smarting of the Ʋrin and o∣ther Filth: And being therewith continu∣ally moistened, is ready to Corrupt and Gangren, to cause Fevers, Watchings, Con∣vulsions, yea Death in end. Tho in Some it
is said to have rotted and fallen quite away: Yea Some have had it wholly cut off to save Life, when it could not be reduced, and that without Death or any grievous Disease. Some however flatly deny any falling of the Womb, which they will have to consist still immoveably in its Place, by reason of its Constitution and the enclosure of such strong Walls, admitting only some Laxity of the Neck or Sheath, which thus comes out and turns, hanging down like a Man's Yard, or a Pudding, and the bigness at least of an Hen Egg, the length also of 3, 4, or 5, Fingers: Or then the Membranes of the Share to lengthen so, as the less skilled have taken it for the Womb, When recent and timely looked to, the Cure is more hopeful, in young Women if tractible, and when it is also a Relaxation only, or small Rent: for a thorow Rent is quite incurable. If it be far and long time out, the Woman old and peevish, it is desperat, for tho reduced it quickly relap∣ses. If it fall out instantly with the Child, it may Kill the Woman in a few Hours, if not speedily reduced, because of great Bleed∣îng, Pain, Inflammation, Swelling, and other grievous Symptoms soon arises.
For Cure, the Womb must be returned into its right Place, stayed up therein, its Ligaments also restored and fortified, with Glewing things, if there be a Ruption of the Fibres, with things Drying, Astringent and Strengthening, if only a Relaxation. To its easier Reduction, the Belly and Bladder must be emptied, and the Woman laid on her Back, her Hips raised, her Thighs spread, and Knees thrust upwards: The prolapsed Part must be cleaned, its Inflam∣mation eased, any Inflation chiefly, or Tu∣mor thereof, which may marr its retrusion, removed first of all, by emollient Fomen∣tations and Unctions: And then be softly prest up the Neck, thrusting it inwards piece and piece, from side to side, till all be re∣past te Privities: Using also (if Hands should hardly d) the grosser end of a Stick, blun∣ted and wrapt in Linnen: Or which hurts less, a firm Linnen Pessary, accomodated to the use: Or a wax Candle of due bigness, to which they add Assa Faetida, or Castore∣um: And by these it may be thrust higher then with the Hands alone: Some appoint Vomiting as a good Mean for its Revocation. Some also give great fright and terror to the Woman, by feigning a burning Iron, or
the like terrible thing upon the Part: Or putting living Mice, Frogs, or other fright∣ful Creatures among her Thighs. To make it pass the Gliber, they anoint it with a Mucilag of Quince Seeds, Comfrey root, or Tragacanth: And after straw upon it to hinder a relapse, the fine Powder of Acacia, Hypocistis, Myrtle Berries, Balausts, Roses, Gum Arabick, Mastick, Sarcacol, and the o∣ther glewing things, which have no aspe∣rity: With a Stoppel in the Entry, of Wool, Silk, or Spunge, conform in shape and thick∣ness, tramped in auster red Wine, or the dissolution of Acacia or Hypocistis in red Rose Water. During the Cleansings, that they may be nothing marred, a right Situation alone must serve to its retention, she lying to wit on her Back, or a little to the one side, her Hips raised, her Thighs stretched easily down, and rested the one to the other, her Legs somewhat cross; using the Bed-pan in Bed, and lying along if possible, and with∣out preasing, with her Hands the while bearing up the Bottom of her Belly: Which may also be supported with easie Bolsters and Swaths. She must have a gentle Glyster when Costive. After her Cleansings are fi∣nished,
She may ply the usual provision with Others in that condition, for its stay and Firmance: as sweet Smells to the Nose, stinking to the inner part of the Pri∣vities, large Cupping-Glasses under the Paps, and to the Navel frequently; as also to the Loyns. Astringent Fomentations to the lower Belly and Privities, half Baths (providing it be securely kept up in that Posture) astrin∣gent Powder: strawed thereon, the Lini∣ments and Plaisters mentioned in the former Chapter, Perfumes likewise, but chiefly astringent Injections. Astringents and Ro∣boratives are ordered by the Mouth also, to comfort the Womb, and help its retention: Such Medicines beside, as may evacuate, discuss, and dry up the pituitous Matter, Mend any vitious Constitution of the Body, the Intemperature of the Womb, fortify and firm its Ligaments. And to secure against Relapse, or stay it up, where there is no hope of perfect Cure, She is made still to wear a Band, much like these for Ruptures, and ever keep Pessaries, of such Matter and Shape, as may be most commodious and fit to stay it up in its Place, even so say Some, as She may ply her ordinar business, copulat easily, and the Husband never perceive it,
Conceive also, Bear and bring forth. Some will have these Pessaries to remain only in the Neck of the Womb, it being impossible to thrust them further then the Mouth of the same, save instantly after the Delivery. Yet Others will have them enter its very Cavity, and never be taken out, where they have been found in Some after Death. If the Fundament force out, as whiles in the vehement Efforts of Labour, it is to be reduced the same Way as the Womb, and with Astringents also (though sometimes no Mean nor Art can make it stay or stick up) yet cannot be done till the Child be born, but must as soon after as possible, for the Cold quickly makes it swell, and turn very painful: And the better to prevent its Prolapse the time of Labour, the Woman must not press down too hard, nor force her Throws too strongly, while the Child is very near and forward in the Passage. It is necessar also her Belly be kept easie after, lest it force out again through the hardned Excrements. The Haemerods likewise in Some shoot far out in a hard and vehement Labour, become very big and painful, afflicting sore in Child-bed. The means for their Ease and Cure are mentioned in the 17. Chap, of the
1st. Book, though the most effectual here, is a plentiful Cleansing, whereby the Blood is diverted, and they diminish: For which let Leeches be forborn till that be over; lest it hereby be marred, and so this trouble encreased. CHAP. IX. Of Bruises and Rents of the Birth, or outward Parts of the Womb. SOme big Infants, takes so great Vio∣lence and force, for Expulsion or Ex∣traction from the Womb, and makes such a wide stretch and separation of these Parts in Passing, so close a rub and com∣pression thereof against the Bones, as oftimes produces painful Contusions, Excoriations, yea Dilacerations and Rents thereof: which happen mostly in First Labours, little Women, And these well old: in Others also, who have these Parts more strait, solid, dry: Or where the Infants Head is more big and firm, that the upper Bones goes nothing
together in the Passage by Compression, though in following Labours, they are still dilated more easily, and without such pain or hurt by this Dissention, in case there be not long Time between, or that after In∣fants exceed not far the 1st. in bigness, for then the like must also happen. One must timely apply thereto, else they soon inflame and ulcerate, through the Heat and great Moisture of the Place, the Acrimo∣ny and Corruption of the Humours, which then continually flow. And if there be simple Contusions or Excoriations only, they may be softly spunged and cleaned, with luke∣warm Barley Water and Honey of Roses, and get soft Rags applyed, dipt in Oyl of Roses, Almonds, St. Johns-Wort: Or over∣spread with the White Oyntment, Nutritum, Oyntment of Roses: Or in case the Hurts be more grievous, the other Anodin Ap∣plications may be used mentioned in the 2d. Chapter: The Parts withall must be well secured from Touch and Smart of the Urin, If Inflammation and Apostem follow as in Some, it must be rightly opened, the Matter evacuated, the Ulcer cleansed with detersive and Vulnerary Injections, such as the Case requires, and be thereafter dressed
and Cured as it ought: And still with all the Care, Ease▪ and Tenderness possible, for fear of Pain, Corruption and Cancer; the Parts being of such exquisite Sense, hold∣ing Commerce with the chief Parts of the Body, and very apt to draw all their Super∣fluities thereon, Some beside, in the grievousness of hard Labour, especially in the 1st, Child, and when Dead, through the straitness of the Sheath, or bigness of the passing Infant, or rash violence in the Operation, gets a Rup∣ture of the Privities, and Dilaeceration of the right Gutt; being rent to the Fundament, and made one continued Cleft: So that the two Holes of the Privities and Fundament go together into one, and the Midwife may enter a Finger by the Fundament, and put the same out by the Privities: In which Case, if a Reunion be desired, the Excrements and hardned Blood must be cleansed off, any begun Scar or Cicatrice cut away, the Rent securely sticht alongst and sewed up, leaving the Lips a little sepa∣tated, for an easier Pass to after Children: With Glutinatives, Balsom and Plaister ap∣plyed, and a firm Compress above, to secure from hurt of the Urine and other Excrements:
And for a speedier Agglutination, She best ly with her Thighs close together until she be wholly sound, careful by all Means, she break not in bearing the next; though a marvel if she do not, being thus sewed straiter, whence the Mother is unhappy for the future, in that while She Travails, the Genitals can never widen, nor be sufficient∣ly enlarged for the Infants passage, by rea∣son of the Cicatrice grown thereon: For which it is best She never bear more, or continue open, though then the Rent re∣mains a nasty Privy, for rendering both Ordure and Urine together: Or else there is a necessity to divide the Borders there∣of in Labour with a Razor, and after rent it wholly assunder. These Rents happen mostly, where the Lips of the Privities are more Firm, Solid and Fleshy, the Skin not being so dilatable as the Membranous Substance within: And happen yet the more readily, are also more considerable, where the Pains comes violent, and the Labour is suddain, then when they advance moderatly and by de∣grees, or where these Parts are Pulpy and pendant, distend and widen by little and little. Sometimes also through ignorance
and rash Violence, in tedious sore Travails, the Bladder is made to split, and never keeps Urine after: And sometimes the Urine is stopt therein 4 or 5 dayes, its Neck being closely comprest by the Infants Head sticking that while in the Bones: whence it Inflames, and intirely Suppurates into Fistu∣lous Ulcers, with loss of some of its Sub∣stance; Causing also Incontinency of Urine, and incureable as the Other, especially if the Holes be large, and any considerable Part of the Substance of its Neck lost and away. CHAP. X. Of After-Pains or Grind∣ing. THey are very common, and to Some more terrible by far then the Labour pains (especially for some 1st. dayes, while they are most grievous) yea whiles so cruel and incessant, in Women more de∣licate, and of exquisite Sense, as to cause Feavers, Watchings, Ravings: Some also have been hereby quite broken and killed: Neither do they any white promove the
Cleansings, as Some alledge, but rather marrs them through this vehemency of Pain. They are held more rare the 1st. Labour, more frequent in the 2d. which would aug∣ment in the following: And may happen so whiles, especially where they proceed from pulling away of the Burden, while it cleaves to the Womb, whence it becomes more tender and sensible, and so these Pains wax worse through process of Time, and repeated Births: Though otherwise, they happen indifferently after every Labour, ac∣cording to the Causes, or the present and va∣rious Dispositions which contribute thereto. They are said to proceed from a Torrent of the Cleansings, their grossness and fecu∣lency, with a straitness of the Vessels, from their acidity also and acrimony, the Mor∣dacity and Rosion they make in passing, especially where the Womb and its Vessels hath been much bruised and made tender in a sore Labour, or yet torn and excori∣ated, by a violent separation of the Burden, which is sometimes so firmly fastened, and growing to the Womb, as can by no Means be got off, without Laceration of it self, and the very Womb also: And then they
flow more copiously. These may proceed likewise from a Total, or yet Partial Sup∣pression of the Cleansings, their Diffusion, and Stagnation throughont the whole Sub∣stance of the Womb, and a tendency to In∣flammation: From Wind also, or Cold receiv∣ed into the Womb: From some strange Body remaining still therein after Labour, which it thus travails to expel: From a Stress or Hurt of its Ligaments: And some∣times from it rising and tumbling after hard Labour, raging as it were every way like a wild Beast of the Forrest, by reason of its sudden Evacuation, whence a vehe∣ment Pain: And may arise also from Wind, or Acrimonious Humours in the Gutts. We shall conceive, by which one or other of These the Woman is thus molested, from the evident Causes, as outward Cold, sore Labour, grievous Passion or Perturbation of Mind, Meats, Medicines, and what else is done, or taken to wrong her. From the Nature also of the Pains, whereof some are Rending and Piercing, some Hot and Bur∣ning, some Beating, some also Distending, some beside are Continual, tho mostly they return by Intervals, or some Inter∣mission, yet more grievous: And are fixt
also in this, or the other Part about the Womb, or flitting to and fro. The same is likewise discovered from the Concomitant Symptoms, as the stop or copious flowing of the Cleansings, her Bound or Loose Belly, Excretion or Retention of Wind, the Efflux of a mixt or putrid Humour from the Womb, the Scalding or Rosion of the Pas∣sage, Feaver, Ravings, Watchings, and the rest. From the Hurters and Helpers also may the true Causes of such Pains be found out, They are differenced from other Pains by their Continuance, and Women them∣selves easily distinguish them from all others whatsomever. The Medicines then must lenify and temper the Cleansings, or attenuate the same, relax also the Pores, solve the Ob∣struction, provoke and move them, discuss the Flatuosity, expel any strange Body, con∣solidate the Wounds and Extoriation, stop the vehemency of the Flux, ease the Pains, cleanse, settle, and roborate the Womb, and the rest. For which chiefly (besides her Dyet and other Government as already directed, wherein the Good of all lyet) are inwardly, Oyl of Almonds, or Poppies, with Syrup of Maiden-hair, or Violets, a
little white Wine, or Posset. The Broth of an old Cock is commended, taken imme∣diatly after Labour for 3 Mornings fasting, with a little Cinamon, Musk, or Amber-grys: As is Chicken Broth, boyled with Mugwort, Mother of Thyme, Maiden-hair, Parsly Roots. Ale boyled with Chamamel Flowers. Pow∣der also of Bay Berries, Anis, of Daucus, or Poppy Seeds, of Dates or Peach Kernels, of Saffron, of Ginamon, Nutmeg, and the rest, in Broth, Rhenish or White Wine. Whale Shot also is given, distilled Oyl of Nutmeg, and Others according to the various Indi∣cations and Intentions, or the present Exi∣gency; whereto Juleps and Mixtures like∣wise are ordered, to be taken by Spoonfulls, of Penny-royal, Mugwort and Fennel Waters, with Treacle Water, Water of Briony, of Cinamon, Syrup of Mugwort, Maiden-hair, Poppies, adding Astringents and Vulneraries in Floodings: Narcoticks also in vehemency of Pain: For many things can be perfor∣med, and many Indications answered, by one and the same Medicament. Some order a Decoction of well washed Faenogreek Seed, with Sugar and a little Cinamon. Some use water Gruel: And Some give a few Gutts of the Blood of the 2din as peculiar for this,
Some also some give the Powder thereof. Glysters are us'd, of Milk, Sugar, Yolks of Eggs: or of Mugwort, Rue, Mallows, Melilot and Chamemel Flowers, Boiled in Chicken Broth, adding Oyl of Almonds and Yolks of Eggs. Or of Chamemel, Anis, Dill, Cumin, adding Muskadel Wine. Others also, as her Case requires. Warm Cloaths are used to the Belly, as are Oyls, Fomentations, Cata∣plasms, Aromatick, Aperient, Carminative, and Anodin. Some anoint the lower Parts, yea all the Belly, with Oyl of Amber, and apply Flannel very hot over the same, moi∣stened therewith. Some also in extremity, will apply to the Genitals, Belly, and Reins warm bags of Oats and Millet, fryed in a Frying-pan with a little White Wine. Ano∣din Plaisters are ordered to the Loyns: An Hysterick Plaister to the Navel. For purg∣ing, Bleeding, Sweating and the rest, they come to be used or forborn, for the Occa∣sion, the presence or absence of other Troubles.
CHAP. XI. Of Inflammation of the Womb after Labour. ITs chief Causes are, a rude violent sepa∣ration, or Extraction of the 2din. A copious Rush of the Cleansings, or of Blood and Humours from the whole Body there∣on, after a sore Labour, being therein ve∣hemently agitated and overheated; atract∣ed also through Heat or Pain of the Womb, made by violence of Labour, or painful car∣riage of the Child, being either big or in ill Posture: The stop likewise, or stagna∣tion of these Purgations in the Substance of the Womb, chiefly in the beginning of Child-bed, through suddain Cold succeeding to Heat, whence they acquire Acrimony and Corruption: A violent handling of the Genitals in Labour: A Painful hard swathing of the Belly after, or any painful Compression, Bruise, or hurt thereof; whence comes also Inflammations sometimes, in the lower Belly. A Prolapse of the Womb may cause this Inflammation, as may any strange Body or Corruption remaining in its
Cavity. Vehement Passions of Mind and the rest. It is discerned, by a Tumor, Heat and burning Pain in some One or other Part of the Region of the Womb, or over all, as it is affected. There is also a great Weight therein, a trouble and Pain in rendering the Urine or Ordure, as the Bladder or right Gutt participates: A continual burning Feaver beside, great Pain and Inflation of the Hypocondres and Breast, difficulty of Breathing, great troubles of the Stomach, Pains in the Head, and the rest, all which augments and encreases while it tends to Suppuration: And upon Inspection of the Genitals, the inner Orifice will look Tu∣mid, drawn inwards and painful, the Neck of the Womb red and inflamed, the little Veins dispersed therethrough, swel∣ling every where towards the interior Parts. It is a very perillous Malady, and most part deadly, for if not timely heeded, it may readily resolve into Apostems, Ulcers, Schirrous hardness, Cancer, or Gangreen: If the whole Womb become inflamed, or Apostemated, the Cure is hard; and where Raving superveens, Convulsions, Hiccoughs
Vomiting, Coldness of the Extremities, cold Sweats, Death may then be quickly ex∣pected. For Cure, her Dyet must be Humectant and Cooling, as Barley Broth, Stewed Barley with Currans: Panado's of Pullet Broth, wherein Endive and Sorrel have been boiled: Drinking Ptisan, small Ale, Barley Water boil∣ed with Liquorish. There may be also cooling Juleps and Emulsions, for her great Pain, Heat, Feaver. Little cooling Anodin Gly∣sters are ordered, if her Belly bind: Gentle Lenient Purges also are used, if noxious Humors abound in the Body. Bleeding like∣wise in the Arm, and to be repeated ac∣cording to her Strength, vehemency of the Inflammation, and the Symptoms: Frictions beside and Ligatures of her upper Parts Cup∣ping-Glasses to the Shoulders, Back and Loyns. The Humor being thus tempered and diminished, the Fluxion intercepted, di∣verted or settled, and the worst of the trouble ever, her lower Veins may also be opened. There may be outwardly to the Place, things against Inflammation, as Gaelens cooling Oyntment, Oyl or Oyntment of Roses, or Oyl of Myrtles, with Vinegar: Or Rose Vinegar alone: Or Plantain, Rose and
Elder Flower Water, with Vinegar and Cam∣phor: Or Bole Armen, Blood-stone, with Rose Vinegar and Glare of Eggs: or a Ca∣taplasm, boiled of Sweet Milk, with some fine grated wheat Bread, adding Yolks of Eggs, with a little Oyl of Roses, Juyce of Henbane, or Nightshade: And other Ano∣din, Cooling, and repellent things: which yet are fit only in the beginning, while the Inflammation is less: with such after as may gently mollify, open and resolve: And Digestives in greater quantity, if the Symp∣toms daily aggravate, and the Inflammation advance: As Discussives, if they remit, and the trouble encline to a Resolution. Such Injections are ordered, and Pessaries, as may temper the Heat and Inflammation, and allay the Pain: Yet must make no Astriction, where the Cleansings flow: And to be immitted with all Ease and Caution, that there be no irritation or hurt to the Part: And thereto Narcoticks may be added, which may also be taken inwardly a part, in extream Pain and Unrest. If the Matter will neither repel nor dis∣cuss, but must Suppurate, such Medicines are added, as mollify and ripen: And to be continued till a Matter be made; which is
known by ease of the Heat and Pain: And after Ruption of the Apostem, and vent of that Matter, detersive Injections are used, for washing all Corruption from the Ulcer; advancing from the more soft, to stronger, as the Matter is more or less virulent, the Ulcer more simple or sordid: With In∣jections in end, to dry, close, and consoli∣date the same, yet not till all Inflammation be removed, and all Pain allayed: If the Ulcer be in the Neck of the Womb, it may be anointed with cleansing and drying Li∣niments: And Suffumigations are prepared for drying the Ulcers when seated higher, toward the Fund thereof. This while gentle Purges must be used more frequently, and a Vulnerary Drink in the Intervals: With what else is necessar for Cure of the remain∣ing Symptoms. These same almost are the Wayes and Means for Cure of Inflammations and Apostems, which happens to some in their lower Belly, which being more super∣ficial and near, hath less difficulty: Yet are sometimes very considerable and fa∣scheuse. Sometimes there succeeds this Inflamma∣tion of the Womb, when ill Cured, a Schir∣rous or hard painless Tumor, which is ever
rarely removed, notwithstanding of Bleed∣ing above, or below, Haemorrhoids, Purging, Aperients, or Others, used for Evacuation, Di∣version, or Derivation of the antecedent Cause, or superfluous Humour: Nor are the Ap∣plications of any great force or Effect to mol∣lify, resolve, or dissipate the same: Whe∣ther Fomentations, Unguents, Cataplasms, Plaisters, Glysters, or uterin Injections: And when big, or obstinate it brings on the Dropsy, and if unskilfully tampered with, may turn to Cancer (as may easily also such Imposthumes) a cruel and ever incureable Malady in that Place, be it Ulcerous or not. CHAP. XII. Of a Belly Flux after La∣bour. THis may proceed of Cold, from a bad Disposition of the Air or Season, from Acrimonious Humours, or Rheums al∣so, abounding in a Cacochymick Body, through a bad Course of Dyet, or otherwise, and now so furiously stirred and heated in the Labour, and falling down upon the In∣testines.
The Aliments beside in the Sto∣mack, and Excrements in the Gutts, are so vehemently tossed and tumbled during Labour, and these Parts so pained and weak∣ned from their Ʋse and Office, by so many strong Contorsions and Compressions of the Belly thereon in the Showers, that not be∣ing able to Govern them more, or retain, transmit and expel them rightly, a Flux arises: The Gutts being greatly irritated withal, by the Acrimony of Excrements so long retained. It may proceed also from their irritation by the Reliques of some sharp Glyster given to provoke the Pains, or some Noxious Thing else taken the time of La∣bour. It is very perillous, and most part Dead∣ly, if it happen the 2d. 3d. or 4t. day, e∣specially coming after a sore Harass of La∣bour, and if more frequent, Copious and Painful: Beside that it may divert and marr her Cleansings. And now, The contrair Indications of these two Flux∣es, gives difficulty in the Prescriptions: For that the One cannot be stopped, the Other flowing, as is chiefly requisite. In the mean time, some good Gellies may be used, Consumme's or other proper metalsome Ali∣ment,
to maintain her Strength: Anodin Glysters also, of Milk and Yolks of Eggs, or others like. And if more peril threaten through the vehemency of this Flux, then could arise from stopping her Cleansings, such Means may then be used, for her Re∣lief and stop thereof, as are mentioned in the 18 Chap: of the 1st. Book, tho thus her Cleansings should now be made to stop likewise, yet be provoked after, the best way can. She may Bleed to supply the defect of her Purgations, as in case also of Feaver, which may happen hereby, or any Accident else which yields not to other Remedies. Laudanum sists the Flux, yet not the Cleansings. CHAP. XIII. Of Tumors and Ruptures of the Belly and others. SOmetimes, the Impregnat Womb grows so vastly big, fills and distends its bounds so exceedingly, as the Peritonum being uncapable of a farther Dilatation, or to contain it, is forced to split, and the
Muscles to separate: Whence Tumors arise in the same place, while the Intestine, or Caul, or both slides therein: where Some also are said to have had the very Womb with the Infant therein tumbled, and almost wholly lodged. These Ruptures may happen whiles above the Navel, oftimes about it, whiles also below, betwixt the right Mus∣cles (though this more rarely, the Perito∣naeum being thicker from below the Navel, that in the carrying of the Infant it could be the more distended) in the Groyns also, and every where in the lower Belly, when ever the Peritonaeum splits, cleaves, or relaxes. The chief Causes are, the huge distention of the Abdomen, by the big Womb, vehement Vomitings, Coughings, frequent Sneezings while thus so tumid, Blows thereon, a Fall, or other suddain violence, strait Lacing up∣wards, and the rest: But mostly they arise of violent and straining Efforts in hard La∣bours: Whence Some also get dimness of Sight, Some dulness of Hearing, through strels of the Nerves, in that most vehement Intention, and great influx of Spirits, to a valid Expulsion of the Infant. And Some have thus got a Tumor below the Navel, pain∣ful to the Touch, moveable, hard, which
could not be discussed by Emollients and Carminants, but haply remained till Death, like a grown to Weight under the Caul. Such Ruptures are ugly, and very hurt∣ful, refrigerates the Stomach and Intestins, while the Caul falls down, which cherishes the heat thereof; whence the more unhap∣py Coctions, Vomitings also, painful Cho∣licks, Catarrhs, Fluxes of the Belly, Phthisis and the like, chiefly while the Rupture can∣not be reduced. Sometimes at the begin∣ning of Pregnancy, the Womb hath come out in these Ruptures, which hath killed the Woman, the Infant remaining and growing so big without the Belly, as it could not be got turned in, but been carried to the Time, as in a Sack, covered only with the Womb and the Skin. Some are thus deform∣ed with Varices in both Limbs, with Tu∣mors also in the Nock, which cannot be mol∣lified, or discuss'd, coming of dilated Arteries where Astringents are needful: but These not being very ugly, and nothing uneasie, they seldom have Applications: For the Di∣latation indeed of an Artery, though not without all danger, yet brings not suddain Death, except there be a thorow Ruption, and the Blood flow forth into a more noble
Cavity, or unexpectedly rush out with some violence, as hath happened to some La∣bouring Women, who through negligence of These were by, have so been suddainly killed. Women when big, must carefully avoid all the foresaid Causes thereof, and where they happen, a Band and Com∣presses must be kept upon the Tumor, or prolapsed Part, to bear it within the Rup∣ture, and if it be in a place, where the Womb may wholly press out, the Woman then, if She know her self with Child, had best keep Bed, to hinder that the Rupture enlarge not through her waxing bigness, as it will else almost dayly. CHAP. XIV. Of Inflammation of New∣lighter Womens Breasts. THey very readily then harden, become painful and inflame, or swell with redness, and beating (in which it differs from Curdling of the Milk) from a copious rush and repletion of Milk, of Blood also and other Humours, so vehemently moved
and heated in the Labour, attracted or transmitted thither: Which being easily im∣bibed, and diffused throughout their spun∣gy and Glandulous Substance, thus painfully distends the Same: And remaining therein unemptied, Heats, Corrupts, turns Acri∣monious, and threatens Suppuration and Feaver; yea with Fury also and Phrenzy, while carried thither suddenly, and in too great abundance: Especially in a full Body, after tedious sore Labour, and where the Cleansings go not so right. The same may happen from access of a Cold sharp Air, the touch or Application of any cold Thing, from Blows also, or any outward hurt or bruise thereof: Some get great Pain and Inflammation, or a kind of Rose, in their Breasts, which sometimes suppurates, in that aguish Distemper they call Widow Non∣fall, very incident to Child-bed Women, from the least error or neglect in their Dyet or Tending; coming first with Shiver∣ings, and followed with a great burning Feaver, in the heat of which if they unco∣ver themselves, or cast out their Arms ne∣ver so little, the Fit renews: This trouble continues sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, is whiles sorer, whiles more easie:
And here Diaphoreticks are proper, if time∣ly administred, and while the Shiverings fall on. Oyntment of Althaea is used to the Breasts, or Diachylon Plaister with Suck∣ing. In a Light Rose, Cream of Milk with Chalk or Elder Water. If the Breasts be in danger to Inflame, let the Woman Bleed in the Arm, after in the Foot: Use Glysters more frequently, and what else may move the Humors downwards, in case the Cleansings come not freely, an ample Evacuation whereof, is a great Mean to pre∣vent it: Using the while a thin spare Dyet, cooling also and moistening. The Topicks must be Cooling, Anodin, and gently re∣pellent, while the Inflammation is less, yet without great Astrction: So in the begin∣ning, One may chafe well into them Oyl of Roses, with shap Vinegar beat together, and after lay thereto, some of Galens cool∣ing Oyntment, with a little of Poplar: Or a Cataplasm made of the Clay, which settles in the bottom of a Cutlers Grind-stone, mixt with Oyl of Roses, and a little Vinegar, and laid on lukewarm: This is thought to allay the Pain, compesce the Inflammation, and quickly repel the Milk: In the Increase, a Fomentation of Butter and Ale is held good.
If there be great Pain, a Pultife of Boiled Chamemel, Mallows and Hemlock: Or of Althaea roots, and Henbane leaves (in Winter the Roots hereof rosted in Embers, and made in a Pultis with Hogs Lard) boiled, pulped and reboiled in sweet Milk, adding still some Oyl of Roses: Or a Pultis of fine grated white Bread, boiled in sweet Milk, adding Yolks of Eggs, some Saffron, But∣ter also, or Oyl of Roses and Chamemel: And above these Compresses dipt in Plantain or Rose Water, with Vinegar. Every ex∣ternal Cause must withall be avoided, as well Fortuitous, as what may come from the six Non-natural things; lest the Evil else augment, or at lest elude the force of Medicaments. The Breasts must be kept slack, and very easie, not suffered to hang, for which She best ly in Bed on her Back, and stir her Arms as little as can. The Pain being allayed, the Humor re∣strained, and turned off, the Height of the Inflammation past, no fear of any further Fluxion to be made, or of Suppuration, the Breasts may be suckt, if Milk abound there∣in, and the Woman to be a Nurse: Or then Discussives may be used, to resolve, dissi∣pate and consume the same; such already
mentioned in the 4th. Chap. of this Book. She may after purge when convenient. Yet if nothing can hinder the Suppuration, but that it manifestly advances, things then Emollient and ripening must be added, to hasten and bring it on. CHAP. XV. Of the Curdling and Clod∣ding of the Milk. THis happens through its redundancy in the Breasts, where remaining too long, it heats, thickens (its Serous parts being resolved) goes together into a kind of Cheese and spongious Density, stag∣nating in the whole Breast, or in some of its Glandules; which hence painfully swell, rise rugged and uneven, distinct and sepa∣rated, being thus filled therewith. It is held to proceed also from Viscosity of the Milk, from Cold, from any Acid whence∣soever, be it a Curdling Humour or Juyce, Grief or great Terror of mind: From any Acid Application also, Cold or sharp Air peircing the Breasts when Sweating: which
according to the Degrees of its too great Acidity, Sharpness and Austerity, procures various Coagulations thereof. And some∣times the Humors in the Breasts are found to become Schirrous, hard as a Stone, which afterwards have changed the Substance thereof, into a Cancer: Whence they oft turn into a hard firm Gristle. Milk is known to Curdle, while the Paps being distent therewith, yet none or very little flows out: Beside, that the swelling Breast grows more white: A Weight also is perceived in it, and all about, hath great Pain also: There may come a Feaver beside, and Pain of the Head. In this Case, the Curdling must be remov∣ed, the Breasts drawn empty, if the Wo∣maen be a Nurse: Who must now also ab∣stain what ever breeds much Blood and Milk, or hastens it to the Breasts, to pre∣vent its too great increase therein: And must use a small Dyet, keep an open Belly, and be sure to Cleanse duely, if it happen then: her lower Parts may be exercised, rubbed and tyed. If the Woman give not Suck, her Breasts must not be drawn, but She is to Bleed in the Arm, if the Milk exuberates through the sole Plethory of
the whole Body, in the Foot also, have Cupping-Glasses to each Groyn, or the Share: Use strong Glysters: Yea purge if necessar: And take also what extinguishes the Milk. Let the Topicks be first repellent, then after such as may incide, attenuate, resolve and dissipate the Matter insensibly, as Smallag, Fennel, Wormwood, Rue, Mint, Cumin, Co∣riander, and other powerfully discussing Aromaticks: Chervil also, Solomons Seal, and the rest boiled in white Wine, or Oxycrat, and oft applyed, Some use a Spunge dipt in the Decoction of Cumin and Corriander with Vinegar. Some a Bag of Rice, Millet and Oats. Some a Cataplasm of Hemlock and Mint: (yet nothing of a malignant quality should be applyed) These also mentioned in the 4t. chap. and the rest: Yet some∣times the Curdling for all this still abides, and the Milk by its long stay there corrupts, becomes Acrimonious and turns to Matter and Abcess.
CHAP. XVI. Of Aposthumes of the Breasts. IF nothing can hinder a Suppuration (and most rarely the Matter is dissipated insen∣sibly) but that it manifestly advances, as ap∣pears by the great pain, strong beating in one Part, with a Livid hardness, pointing soft in the Midle of the Tumor, then Emollient and ripening Applications must be hastened, that the Suppuration or Generation of Matter may be promoved without great Pain, chiefly Ca∣taplasms of Althaea roots, roots of Lillies, rosted Onions, tops of both Mallows, Boars-Breach, Wood Sorrel, Flowers of Chamemel, of Me∣lilot, Meal of Wheat, of Linseed, Faenogreek, Yolks of Eggs, Figs, Saffron and the like; with Oyl of Lillies, Chamemel, Oyntment of Althaea, Basilicon (a little whereof may be applyed alone about the Place of Suppu∣ration) Butter, Marrow, Fat or Grease, Plai∣ster of Diachylon, of Mucilages compound, and the rest: to be applyed and continued, till a perfect Suppuration, or Ripness: Which is known by the whiteness, softness, fluctua∣tion
of the Matter (unless it be very gross) a pointing of the Tumor, and abating of the Feaver, Pain, Tension, Hardness and the other Symptoms. It must then be opened in time for seldom a deeper rooted Apo∣stem breaks of it self, and not but in a longer Space) for ease of the Pain, and less hurt to the Place; Else the Matter turning more sharp by its stay, Communicates to the Kernels and milk Vessels, and corrodes the same. It must however be fully ripe, be∣cause of too much Pain. The Apertion is made with a grain of potential Cauter, or rather a Lancet, thrust into the very Heart of the Matter, which presently and cer∣tainly brings the same, neither leaves such an ugly Scar: And must be made in a de∣clive Place of the rising Part: The Section must be most quickly with the least Pain and hurt, Chiefly careful of hurting the Veins and Arteries, the principal of which are towards the Arm-pitts, The Nerves, or Fibres of the Muscles. The Apertion must be large enough for Evacuation of any Clods of Matter, which yet must not be let out too plentifully, or at once, if it be a big Abscess, for fear of fainting, swooning, whiles Death it self, in the more feeble, delicate, fearful.
If the Woman will not admit to open it either wayes, that the Matter may then be drawn to the Surface, and the Corroded Skin sooner perforated thereby, Some apply fine Honey, Rye Leaven, and the Yolk of an Egg boiled to a Plaister: Some also lay Figgs, beat into a Cataplasm, to the softest and most rising part, to facilitate and pro∣move its Apertion, Diachylon Plaister breaks an Abscess. The Matter however being vent∣ed, the Wound must be wipt clean, and get soft easie Tents, armed with Basilicon, Lini∣ment, Balsom of Sulphur, or of Peru: Or yet Turpentine with the Yolk of an Egg (May Butter may be added) as a Digestive, if there be great Pain, or any thing yet to suppurate. The Tents must not be thrust in too far: Let a Thread also be tyed about the 1st, if requisite, the better to pull it back: Detersives also, and Mundifiers are to be used, as Honey of Roses, the Apostles Oyntment, Tincture of Myrrh, Aloes, In∣cense: Such Applications beside must see con∣tinued, as mollify any remaining hardness. Oftimes several Kernels Aposthumates, and the Breast yeilds Matter in diverse Places, yet then it suffices to make one or 2 large Orifices only, in the most declive
part of the Breast, for emptying and dry∣ing up all the rest; the whole Matter there∣in seeking quickly thither. Then the most speedy and sure way, after the Matter is drawn off, to heal these Imposthumes, dry up and close the Ulcers, and their Fistulous Orifices is to put the Milk from both Breasts, the sound as well as the sore. The Woman this while must keep an open Belly, purge now and then, use also a very slender Dyet. CHAP. XVII. Of Excoriations and loss of the Nipples. THe Excoriations, Exulcerations and Fissures of the Nipples, which Nurses very oft get, especially the 1st. time, cause horrid, sharp, and intolerable Pains, whiles Infants Suck, for else they have litle or none, and that by reason of the most tender Skin, and exquisite Sense of the Part, from a Concourse of Nerves, Arteries and Veins thereon: And becomes yet sorer, the har∣der Milkt they be, as in the 1st. Child, the
Milk Conduits not being patent enough, but obstructed or otherwise straitened. They arise from Childrens sharp and more greedy Sucking, when very dry and hungery, and where they get not Milk soon and easily: whence they do bite and mump the Nipple so fiercely, whether with sharp Fore-teeth, or yet Gus, as they make these Chops and Excoriations, Which are thus so encreased in continual Sucking, as they become raw: And some are in end quite taken away from the Breasts, an Ulcer sometimes ari∣sing, hard to be Cured. They may happen also from a Thrush in the Infants Mouth: Or yet when it hath the Pox, whence the Breast it Sucks is soon thus infected and spoiled. As soon as ever the Nipples turns sore, or any way painful, the Nurse best forbear to have them Suckt, till they be made whole and sound: The Milk for some while must be kept back from the Breasts: Yet if the one Nipple be whole, She may give Suck with that. For Cure, of these Excoriations and Fissures, they apply Honey of Roses, Rags wet in Allom, Lime, or Plantain wa∣ter: Or in Vinegar boiled with Litharg, Pomat also, Diapompholigos, or Cream, with Chaulk
Starch Flower of Brimstone, washed Tutty, or Calaminar stone: Plaister of Ceruss, of Chaulk: A gut of Oyl of Wax, of Myrrh, or Eggs, may now and then be droped or rubbed thereon: Natural Balsom also for Exulcerations, Bal∣som of Sulphur Anisat, Lime water, where∣in Mercurius Dulcis is boiled: Yet while the Child Sucks, let nothing be used may dis∣gust it: And the better to secure them from hurt, let her put thereon, little holed Caps, like Hatts, of pure Wax, Wood, or yet of Lead, for this by it self is a Remedy to the Ulcers. If the Nipples be taken off. She cannot then give any more Suck, and so the Milk must be quite dryed away, till perfectly Cured: Yet after, if She will, the Roots of her old Nipples may be unstop'd, and formed out into new Ones, if these be not the nearer taken off; by Sucking them with the Mouth, or a breast Glass, and put∣ting upon them (for a better Shape, and to hinder their sinking in again) the little Caps abovementioned; Then, being raised and formed new Niples, she may try to give Suck again, So far briefly of the right Government of Child-bed Women, of their principal Indispositions also, with the most pleasant, easie, innocent Cures. For the
Whites, which are very grievous to many such, they are mentioned in the 1st Book, as is the Swelling of their Legs and Thighs, which arising mostly from the Burden of a big Belly, must now evanish when lighter, through ease, warmth and good Guiding. And the Anti-hystericks appointed for hard Labour, or suppressed Cleansings, take Place in Hysterick Passions, or Suffocations of the Womb, then very usual. Now follows CHAP. XVIII. Of the Feavers of Child-Bed-Women. THe continual putrid Feavers super∣veens mostly, and arises either from a Suppression, or Diminution of the Courses, their Corruption and Virulent Ma∣lignity: Or if it happen while these flow right, it then proceeds from store of bad Humors, cumulated in the Body the time of Pregnancy; which being furiously agitated, in the Fervor, and vehemency of a sore and tedious Labour, easily inflames and rages beyond all bounds constituting these
Feavers: Which may also happen to the from Errours in their Dyet and Tending, chiefly while cramed with Meats, unfit both in Quality and Quantity, or while they rashly expose themselves to the Air and gets Cold, especially when Sweating in the Hight of the Feaver of Milk. It proceeds also oft enough, while the 2din. comes not whol∣ly away, but some Part, especially of the Womb Liver, is left annexed to the Womb, which putrifies, whence the Cleansings are Greenish, Faetid, and Cadaverous: And unless it be quickly loosed and got away, the Woman is put in great peril of Life: noisome Vapors flying up to the Head, Heart, and Stomach. In Some also, the Orifice of the Womb so straitens and closes instantly after Labour, that the Blood is detained, Clots and Putrifies therein: Whence these Feavers, with divers other most horrible Symptoms, of which (if it can no way be got out) they soon die. Yet usually while such Clotts, or other Praeternatural Thing re∣main in the Cavity of the Womb, the neck thereof is soft, lax and patent: Neither does the inner Orifice close, nor the Womb settle and draw back, as where all goes right after Labour.
Feavers of Child-Bed are most dange∣rous, both for that the Strength is broken by the Labour, and through Suppression of the Cleansings, there is a greater redundan∣cy of most vile putrid Humors in the Veins and Mass of Blood, which must exagitate the same to an acute Feaverish malignant Ebullition. It helps also the Prognostick of these Feavers, and foresight of the Crisis especially, that a due computation be made of the Beginning, or number of the Dayes thereof: As to which, if there hath ben a natural Labour, with no grievous Symp∣toms, the Cleansings also go right after, a subsequent Feaver whence soever, must compute from its Beginning: But if the La∣bour hath been hard and praeternatural, the Feaver tho arising 3 or 4 dayes after, must count from the day of Labour, the Crasis of all, being from that everted, the Oeconomy, or Functions of the whole Body marred, or in ill order. As the Feavers of Child-bed Wo∣men, hath no peculiar Essence or Diagno∣stick, so there is little or no difference or difficulty of Cure in their Case; except as to Bleeding and Purging: And for Bleeding in the Arm, there is great difficulty, be∣cause of the quite opposite Indications; the
Feaver greatly requiring it in the usual Method, the Child-bed State flatly forbid∣ing it, for marr of the Cleansings. However as to Bleeding, their Feavers come either in the beginning, in the midle, or at the end of Child-bed: and according∣ly the Cleansings either still flow natural∣ly, and in that abundance they ought for the time, so that the Woman purges suf∣ficiently, and then there must be no other Bleeding, while Nature thus bleeds Her so right and largely: Or the Cleansings, hap∣pens now to be supprest or diminished, and then her lower Veins are to be opened, and bleed copiously, that so they may be pro∣voked, and the Morbifick matter also dimi∣nished: And the same Veins are also to be opened, even tho She should be Cleansed sufficiently, if the Disease increase, so as the natural Evacuation should not suffice, and so much Blood taken, as by both Evacuati∣ons the present Exigency may be Supplyed: But if the Feaver turn ardent, vehement, or exceeding intense, her upper Veins must be forthwith opened (as also in a Peripneu∣mony, Pleurisy, Quinsy, or other particular acute Disease, which puts her in eminent peril of Life, and yeilds not to other Re∣medies)
and no fear that thus the Blood may be drawn back from the Womb, see∣ing then the upper Parts so abound there∣with, that albeit much be drawn, yet the Veins are not so emptied, as that they must attract new Blood from thence: Tho for the more security, or conservation of her Cleansings, it is good before it be done, to rub the Thighs, and after make painful Li∣gatures in the midle thereof, not to be loosed till a little after the Bleeding: And now and then also to apply Cupping-Glasses to the same Parts, or at least repeat the Frictions. Yet if the Disease and its Vehemency do not so press, and urge, and the Cleansings with∣all be copious, it is to be performed with the greater premeditation, or rather quite for born, while Nature thus keeps right, and especially the nearer the Delivery, for the more remote, the more safely it may be done. As to Purgation, it must not come while the Cleansings flow naturally: Though if they stop, so as the Woman purge either nothing at all, or insufficiently, and all fit remedies for provoking thereof are Essayed in vain, And if the Morbisick Matter appear digest∣ed, after 8 10 or 12 dayes from the Labour
She may be purged, but with a more gentle Medicine only, and according to the great∣er or lesser exigency of the Disease and her strength. If also the Flux come whitesh, or of other unnatural Colour, the Matter withall be ripe, She may safely purge in the last period of Child-bed: And in gene∣ral, this is here to be observed, that the far∣ther removed from the day of Delivery She be, the more safely She may purge, the the nearer the more peril, as in the 2d. 3d. or 4t. day: Hence a Loosness then is usual∣ly Mortal. CHAP. XIX. Of Right Ordering and Dressing New-born In∣fants. HAving already taught their safe pro∣duction into the World, no less Skill and Industry is still requisite to their Pre∣servation: Being of themselves now, and long time after, Silly, Infirm, and so Pitiful∣ly Impotent, as without the aid and suc∣cour
of Others they must instantly perish: So who helps now is a God to him in the Metaphor of the Proverb. And here first of ordering the Navel-String. As soon as the Infant is born, and the After-birth (for this must be excluded also, ere the String be cut, unless it stick too long) and the Birth closed up, let them be brought together before the Fire (the In∣fant being put in a warm Bed and Blanket) and the String then tyed, with a strong gross Thread, softly twisted 3 or 4 fold, about a Foot or Quarier long, having a Knot on each end, and got ready before, with a pair of sharp Scissars, or Razor. The Tye may be applyed an Inch 2 or 3. (that is no matter) from the Belly, and requires no greater length in Males then Females, as say Some, who will give these a larger Measure, that the Yard may hence become greater: But a less Portion, or cut nearer the Belly in the Other, that the Womb may be seated higher, and its Neck made straiter: Tho yet there is no consent of the Yard or Womb with the Navel: Nor were this any favour done to Women. Let 2 or 3 firm tyings be made about the String, with a double Knot each turn, to
make sure no Blood flow out, whence some Infants have been lost: Yet must not be made so strait as to cut it through. The Tye being expede, the String is to be cut off, 2 or 3 Inches without the same, towards the Burden (the end thereof say Some, must not touch the Ground, else the Child will never hold its Water) then let the cutting which remains at the Navel, be wrapt up in a small Rag, dry, or yet dipt in Oyl of Roses, or Almonds, and turned upwards above the Navel (that the Blood may not so readily flow out) and laid up∣on a Compress, that thus it touch not the naked Belly, to cause Grips by its Coldness: With another Compress a top, and a Belly band above all, that so it be kept firm in a certain Place, and not roll too and fro, or be forced off sooner then it ought; the Vessels not being entirely closed and healed up: whence a Flux of Blood, or an Ulcer, hard to be Cured. Careful still, while the Child is opened, to see the Tye bide fast and close (it readily slacking in big swol∣len Strings, as they wither and dry: whence also some Infants have been lost un∣awares, by this effusion of Blood) till the the String corrupt, or dry, die and fall a∣way
of it self with the Tye, being thereby deprived of Aliment and Heat. The Time thereof varies, though most fall the 6th. or 7th. day, Some the 5th. and these Infants Midwives makes to be long lived: Some the 3d. and such again they Prophecy short lived. Some are after the 8th. or 9th. day but very rarely. A Com∣press and Swath must still be kept upon the Place for some time after, till it be solidated with a firm Skin, wholly depressed, and as it were sunk inwards and formed a sound Navel. That it may be drawn together the better, and for its greater Exsiccation, Some Straw thereon the Powder of a rotten Walnut-Tree, a little Chaulk, Bole, Burnt Lead, Snail Shells, or apply the Powder of Mastick with the White of an Egg. Some are in use, where the Infant is more weak, and as it were half dead, before they tye and cut the String, to drive back all the Blood therein, to its inward Parts, whereby they will have the Infant, who just now was sailing without Blood, to be instantly restored to Life, revived and made vigorous by Accession hereof: which yet being cooled by approach of the outward Air, deprived of its Spirits, clodded also
and half congealed, can have no such Effect, but must do a weak Infant great hurt and danger: No such thing therefore ought to be suffered. And with as little reason, do Some give to the Child in its faintings, 3 or 4 drops of the Blood squeezed out of the Navel-String in a little breast Milk The Infant must next be cleansed before the Fire, from all Excrements, first that kind of Oyly Mucous Filth, or Clammy Humour upon its Body without, like Cream of Milk, or soft Cheese, which is said to pro∣ceed from the Slime of its Waters, or the Milky Liquor it swims in: Some hold it an Excrement of the 3d. Concoction, made in the whole Habit: Others an Excrement fal∣ling from the Brain through its Mouth and Nostrils: And the same being in greatest plenty about the Head. Arm-pitts, folds of the Groyns, and Codds (though Some are wholly besmeared therewith) these Parts must be cleansed more exactly, and bathed with a soft Rag, or Spunge tramped in Lukewarm Claret, with a 3d. part Wa∣ter: Or in warm Ale: Some use Decoction of Sage and Roses in Wine; adding where it is tough, and ill to come off, a little Oyl
of Almonds, Cream, or fresh Butter: And so be all wipt clean, and dryed off. Let its Mouth be opened, and the Phlegm drawn out, the Snott also from its Nose: The Ears must be cleansed of their Filth, using small rag Tents dipt in that Liquor, to un∣stop and clear them, as also the Nostrils. The Eye-lids are to be opened, and the Eyes made clean; yet with a soft dry linnen Rag only, or then wet in lukewarm Water: For neither Wine, Butter, nor Oyl agrees thereto. Let them also be covered, especi∣ally careful they be kept from the Light. While it is thus made clean from that outward Impurity, all its Parts and Mem∣bers must be diligently viewed, that there be no deformity or fault in the Figure or Con∣formation, nor any Thing praeternatural, nei∣ther any Hurt, Dislocation, or Fracture in bearing: Whiah Things must be corrected and amended, while the Limbs and Joynts are soft and yeilding; yet hardly can, in Case they be vitiously Figured, as very oft, in the 1st Conformation of the Parts in the Womb. Every Finger and Toe must be hand∣led and spread open, the Joynts also of the Thighs and Arms extended and contracted several times a day, for soe while, that
the Excrementitious Humours abounding therein, may be thus resolved. The Con∣formation of its Head must chiefly be heed∣ed, for being divided into many Parts, and more straitly compressed, in some 1st. and difficult Labours, through an usual bigness, or straitness of the Way (and very oft the Midwifs rude or rash Hands does much hurt then upon the tender Gristles of the Temples) there is frequently made a Protuberancy or Depression: Yea its due Mould is oft mar∣red and spoiled, that for the right and natural Figure, round and a little long, to wit, behind and before a little protube∣rant, and depressed at the Sidei, it is made long and flat, or exactly Sphaerical: But most frequently of all, an acuminated or oval Figure arises hence, the Head as it were thrust out into a Point, or sharpness up∣wards, being more soft above, and not as yet solidated with a firm Bone: And all such marred and hurtful Figurations, in whole, or in part, easily perverts the Frame of the most soft and Humid Brain, and more or less, according as it is made to recede from the Natural: And through misplacing of the Vessels of the Brain, even without Disruption thereof, a Fatuity may
follow, yea and incurable: But seeing the Sutures, or greater Seams of the Head, are then soft and moveable, and so may be easily removed and set right to their due Place, such Figures are to be corrected with the Hand, and restored to the natu∣ral, by softly compressing the Head, and making it plain and even: Which yet re∣quires great Skill and Caution. The Ca∣nal chiefly of Urine, and the Fundament must be seen patent, which is soon known, the Urine being usually past immediatly after its Birth, especially at the Heat of the Fire, and while these Parts are handled and stroaked: And whiles its Ordure then also, that black Excrement called the Meconium or Papaver, or in a short time after: Tho Some for 3 dayes, discharge nothing of this Meconium, nor no Excrements of the Belly: But this is rare. If it vent not the 1st. day, it had best be provoked, least Grips arise, giving a Sugar'd Almond, rubbed over with a little boiled Honey, for a Suppository: Or a small piece of Castile-Soap, rubbed over with fresh Butter: And by the Mouth Syrup of Roses or Violets, with new drawn Oyl of Almonds, or a little Manna: The In∣fants Belly may also be anointed with the same Oyl, or fresh Butter.
This Matter found in its gross Intestins, like a black Electuary, or pulp of Cassia (of other Colours also) and which it excerns from the Fundament after it is born, is made the more gross Part, or residuous Dregs of some Aliment, assumed by the Mouth, and swal∣lowed, the more subtile peircing the Guts unto the Blood, receiving some Consistence from the stay they make in the Circumvolu∣tions, or turns of the Guts. Some will have it redound in the Guts, from the faeculent superfluous Blood only discharged there∣into by little and little: And Some make it the Juyce of the Sweat-bread with the Bale, falling down by little and little upon the Intestins. It gathers and remains in the Infants Guts, keeping them distent for their future Office, and is in so small quantity (what Food it gets in the Womb being pure, and so wholly converted into its Nourishment and Growth) that nothing is voided, till after it is born, and begins to be fed (yet Some make its more liquid Excrements to encrease the Waters) then plenty of new and far worse scented Encrements, are cumulated therein, by little and little, thrusts down and expels the Meconium, which is then
known to be all voided, when its Stools turns from black to pale, about the 2d. or 3d. day: Losing still by degrees that Tincture according as the new Excrements descends and mixe thereto. The Infant is now to be laid into Swd∣ling Cloaths, all his Parts and Members soft∣ly extended, and each laid fitly in its own Place, not crookedly or confused, with soft Rags behind the Ears, in the Arm-pits and Groyns, the better to suck up the Filth comes out, and keep from Scalding: And so be trimly Swathed up, beginning at the Head, the Mould or soft Part whereof, must he covered for Cold or outward Hurt, with a 4 or 5 plyed Linnen Compress under its Biggin, and fast pinned thereto: Let his Arms next be wrapt up in his Bed, and straighted down close alongst the Sides, his Thighs also, Legs and Feet, equally extend∣ed, and bound down together, that they may ly more straight, and not turn crook∣ed, or wry, grow firm also and stable, that so he may be able in time to raise him∣self, stand upon his Feet, and come to go upright: With a soft Linnen between, to hinder their Galling: Having also a Stay∣band pinned on each side the Blanket, to
keep its Head steady: And so its whole Body being thus equally contained in the Swaths, and in a straight Figure from Top to Toe, due and decent for Mankind, may be thereby rightly conformed and perfited, its Bones made firm and stable. Whence Some will not have it loosed from the Swaths for 60 dayes, yet Some make the 1st. 40 dayes enough to be kept in them: But the Time is indeed uncertain, for the more feeble an Infant is, the longer time he needs be Swathed, the more robust the shorter. In Swathing the Infant, One must be sure to keep his Breast more slack, for a free Re∣spiration, else he may Suffocate: His Sto∣mach also, else the Milk he sucks shall not have Place therein, and so be cast up: Nei∣ther must the Swaths be too slack, nor yet too strait, lest its tender Members be wrest∣ed: And be sure also the Pins prick him not, whence Some have died, let Women see to the rest. After it is Dressed and Swathed, and be∣fore it should Suck or take any Meat, Some will have it placed at the Mothers left Side near the Heart, the 1st. time, perswading themselves that by this, the Infant will be preserved all its Life from Convulsion and
Lery, while the Mother draws naturally from it all Diseases, and voids away again with her Cleansings, whatever Hurt she hath drawn, without any peril. There is yet another Excrement, a sort of tougher Phlegm sticking in his Stomach, which he is now and then puking up, for some little time after he is born: And to facilitate its Ejection (for it best be off ere he Suck) he is ordered a little Sugar'd Wine, or Ale: Or some new drawn Oyl of Almonds with Sugar-Candy, or Syrup of Violets: Or a little Butter and Sugar, or Honey (though some approves not either of Butter or Honey to that purpose) and after laid a little forward, that the Phlegm may vent the freer, which else if laid on his Back, might fall on his Gullet and choak him: And this they use for one day, or more, till a Breast be got, and that he hath cast up all that Pituit. Some Women have in Custom, to make the Infant get something by the Mouth, as soon as ever it is born, whence they fancy some Diseases may be prevented: And especially Some give 1st. and before it get any thing else, a few Grains of prepared red Corral in the Mo∣thers Milk: Others some Gutts of the Navel
Blood against their ever having Convulsions: And Some give a little powder of Bezoar. CHAP. XX. Of Dyeting and Ordering the New-born Infant. SOme little time being elapsed, and the most part of that Pituit got off, he may get a Breast, though not the Mothers for the 1st. 8 dayes at least (Some say not till after her Cleansing) that She be somewhat Setled and Cleansed, her Milk purified: Else the Milk of the Cleansings, or of the 1st. dayes, being Foul, Turbid, Curdy, without Concoction and other due Quali∣ties, might raise Grips, and loose the Belly (Though Some therefore hold it good as carrying off the Excrements therein) But Some will give Suck from the very 1st. day, and Some may, to wit, robust health∣ful Women and in easie Labours: Though yet all Women had best forbear, till they Setle and Cleanse a little, the foul Milk be brought away, and the Breasts withall won easie for the Infant: And to make him take
it (for Some will not in 3 or 4 dayes) let a little be milked into his Mouth, and up∣on his Lips, that he may taste it, and after put the Nipple droping into it, softly squeezing out the Milk when once he is fastened, that he may have it come easily: And so be thus brought on to Suck by degrees. He must Suck little at first, and ofter, yet not too oft, but as his little Sto∣mach can easily contain and digest, with∣out oppression and Vomiting: Advancing dayly for his Age, Strength and Appetite, till he may safely take a fill, and that Night and Day when he will: Yet still in all Mode∣ration, for Milk is of great Nourishment, and so if given in greater plenty, then that the native Heat can well digest, or convert it into a perfect Substance of Flesh, it easily goes to Fatt: Whence Infants have the same Troubles, which Elder People gets through Surfeit. It is thought best he feed on Milk alone, in case there be plenty of it, for 2 or 3 Months at least (and many are content with Milk alone, and refuses Pap all that time) it proving sometimes very perni∣cious to a tender Infant, to get Pap too soon, or largely, especially if Thick and
Viscous, by reason of its Indigestion, the Obstructions and Constipations it makes scarce finding passage, the great Oppressions, Stop∣pages and Infirmities of the Breast; Gripes, Swellings and Pains of the Belly: Yet Some Finger-fed Infants are seen to thrive as well as they who Suckle. As soon as there is need, he may get a little of Some other Nourishment also, which yet in Vertue and Consistence, would not be unlike the Milk, of good easie Coction and Distribution, as Pap of new milked Milk, clear Ale, or yet Water, and Meal well dryed to be less Viscid and Crud: Or rather Crumbs of white Bread gently Boiled to a moderate Consistence (though Some order the Milk raw, as being of a Cleansing Quality, easie of Digestion, and excellent to prevent all Convulsions and Griping Pains of the Sto∣mach, attending windy Diseases in Children) adding a little Sugar, Butter, or Powder of Anis: And this to be given once a day, especially in the Morning, or twice at most: Though yet the Dyet must vary, for the various Nature, Habit, Temperature. After he is thus dressed and fed, he is turned in upon the Nurses Bosom, who stroakes him down over his Back, to the very Toes, gives
him, a little Suck, to wash down the Milk and help its Concoction, and then layes him to sleep: Yet hence are Infants Crudities cumulated dayly in abundance, for that all Nurses almost, ever permits them to sleep instantly after the use of any Mea whatsoever. He is to ly in a Cradle by Day, (by Night also till he be a little more robust, lest he be overlaid) upon his Back also, while the Bones are less solid and knit: For that being as the Keel of the Ship, the Basis and chief stay of the whole Body, he may more safely and easily ly thereon, then on either Side; else, the gristly tender Bones of the Ribs, would yeeld and be wrested, under the Weight of the rest of the Body, and he would become Gibbous. Though when he is elder, takes more solid Food, becomes stronger and more firm in his Bones and the Frame thereof, he may accustom by little and little, whiles to the one Side, whiles to the other. He must alwayes receive the Light directly op∣posite, else he painfully bends himself, here and there every way after it, wrests his Head and Eyes, whereby they either be∣come Squint, or twinkling, rolling and instable: But for this Experience hath
taught to cover the head of the Cradle, and so keep him from the Light, as from any o∣ther hurt or injury: Yet he must not ly too warm or close from the Air: His Head must also be a little raised, and so calmly rocked: Though he best be used to sleep unrocked. He may get sleep when ever he will (and Infants use to sleep more then wake, and so much the better) nor needs it be broken or marred, unless very im¦moderate, turning him languid, dull and stupid. He must be opened and changed at a Fire, Evening and Morning, or Night and Day when ever he is foulded and waking; being fit to keep him ever clean of Filth and Excrements, in dry warm Cloaths, and well washed also, that they may not Itch and Gall him: Nor must they grow hard, rough or wrinkly about him. The String this while must yet be looked to, that it do not loose and bleed, nor be forced off e're its Vessels close. A warm Compress must ly close upon the Open of the Head, for Cold or outward hurt, especially where it is more large. Careful also to keep him from Sealding, and that he Cry not too much, especially in the begining, lest the
Navel be forced outwards, or dilated in∣to an Exomphale, or that he get a Rupture, or Fluxions upon his Eyes. And so to quiet him give the Breast, lay him clean and dry. rock him in the Cradle, Sing to him and the rest. Thus far of the Dyet and ordering of new born Infants in Health, for preser∣vation of it. Now follows to treat of the principal Maladies may befall them, from their Birth till they be 7 or 8 Months old (though they are reckoned Infants till the 4th. year) in which time a great many die: And as to which we may here in general observe, that Some makes Infants Diseases very few in Kind, and to differ only in de∣gree: Yea stands not to affirm, their whole Diseases to be of the same Kind, and pro∣duced from One and the same next and im∣mediate Cause, an Acid to wit, or sharpen∣ing Corruption prevailing exceedingly: And so the same very Disease to get various Names, as divers Parts of the Body may be affected, upper or lower, to wit, as the Stomach, Intestins, Lungs, Head, and Nerves are chiefly stressed: And thus all the An∣tecedent and mediate Causes of Infants Ma∣ladies, how many soever they truly may be,
or can he imagined, are inclosed at length in the foresaid Cause, to which as the true Parent, each Symptom of Infants owes its rise; proceeding far ofter from a too great Coagulation, or Incrassation of the Ali∣ment (which is stayed upon some degree of this Acidity, or at least comes therefrom) then from other Cause. And as Infants falls most easily into Diseases, so if rightly guid∣ed, they most easily also recover: And their Cure is much more safe and easie, then of Men and Women: Which accordingly they make to be best performed by such Things as are wholly Temperate, which in∣fringe, contemper, blunt, securely drink up and remove this predomining Acidity, solve the Coagulations, allay the Ebullition by little and little, and without raising any new warmth, heat and stir of the Body: And so become potentially Anodin and safe, yea Soporiferous: Yet must be both given and repeated in a Dose requisite to attain the end. Such chiefly are Crabs Eyes and Claws, Shells of Oysters, of Shell-fish, Bone of the Cuttle-fish, Chaulk, Corral, Corralin, Pearle, Mother of Pearl, both Bezoar stone, burnt Harts-Horn, burnt Ivory, the bone of a Stags Heart, rasped Harts or Uni∣corns
Horn, Bole Armen, Sealed Earth, Blood∣stone, Gascoins Powder, Species of the Con∣fection of Hyacinth and the like, most simple Medicaments, receding little from their na∣tural State: So that the Acid being thus first rightly prepared, or wholly broken and deprived of its Sting, and quite allayed, may then be purged off, with due or most gentle Cathaticks, among all which, Rheubarb is held far the best, and most accomodated to Infants, whether afflicted with Feave, or otherwise. And for These of a more La∣borious Preparation, as Volatile-Salts, Oylous and Spirituous, Bezoar Mineral, Solar, Lu∣nar, Spirit of Salt-Armoniack, of Harts-Horn, tho excellent for sheathing the Acid, yet are refused for their Heat: And there∣fore also the Lixivial Salts, the hotter and more strong Cordial Waters, which must not be used, save in the smallest quan∣tity, that they may be so weakned with o∣thers more Temperate, as their warming force may scarce be sensible to the Taste. But now of their principal Diseases in par∣ticular.
CHAP. XXI. Of Infants Weakness when Born. THis happens partly by Nature, but mostly by stress of a sore long Pra∣vail (especially a feeble Child, a bad Posture and a perplexed Passage) whence Some are so discomfited, that when born, it is hard to know whether they be dead or alive, no Part of the Body being perceived to stir, which is sometimes so pressed and contused, made so blew and livid, especially the Face, as they appear quite choaked: Who yet many times revive and recover, by little and little, after several Hours in that Con∣dition, are brought back from the very Con∣fines of Death and the Grave, even when taken for Dead. Life likely yet remains in the Infant, if the Mother felt it stir strong∣ly a little before Delivery, if She had not very sore or long Labour, or a more vio∣lent Delivery, much flooding, fainting, or other grievous Symptom: And he is surely alive, however weak, if his Heart be felt stirring, or the Navel String, especially
when touched near the Belly: And then must all Means be used for his recovery from that Weakness, who therefore must be put warm, his Mouth kept a little open, and his Face uncovered; upon which the Mid∣wife may spout sharply, and more near, a little Odoriferous Wine, or Mallag with some Cordial Powder, as oft as there is Occasion, may foment the Navel therewith, and lay warm to his Breast and Belly, Com∣presses wet therein: Or yet some other Cordial Epithem. Small Tents also may be dipt in this Wine, and put up his Nostrils: Let every Part of his Body be well chafed with warm Cloaths, to bring back the Blood and Spirits to the Circuits thereof, if there be Suffocation, or overcharge of the Ventricles of the Heart, through their vehement reflux thereto. Some order him to be put in a Laver of Mallago and Water, and washed by little and little. Some smite his Hips and Soles. Some hold a slice of Uon to his Nose, or put it into his Mouth. Some again put the Burden into the Fire, e're it be separated: And Some among warm Wine, but these do little good. Some also apply it very warm upon his Belly, as O∣thers drive inward all the Blood in the String,
and these may also thus do him great hurt. Infants born weak, are sometimes so by Nature, as coming before the time, and the longer before the worse: Or being begotten of sickly infirm Parents, as also if the Mother while with Child, should suffer various Symptoms and be brought very low: And such take very careful tending, yet hardly brought any length, being soon foiled by the least Indisposition takes them. CHAP. XXII. Of Contusions and Hurts of the Head and other Parts. THe tender little Bodies of Infants, are easily hurt and bruised in bearing, yea their soft gristly Bones broken and dis∣located, while long pressed, or violently handled and twisted, in a hard Labour, or a wrong Posture: But the most frequent Hurts, are bruised Tumors, Knobs, or Promi∣nences, manifestly appear oftimes upon their Crowns, the Front also, and other Parts,
mostly in 1st Labours, Elder Woman, a more big firm Head, and straiter Pass: So that the inner Orifice being more strait, firm or Callous, or the Bones ill to part, the In∣fants Head is so straitly therewith begirt, as it were a Circle (chiefly its upper Part, which enters first, and especially while it yet sticks dry in the Straits of the Ori∣fice, after the Waters are spent, and the Pains wax stronger) that the Blood and Hu∣mours being stopt in their progresive Mo∣tion, and kept stagnating in the Place, are ex∣travasated, or pressed out into the void Parts, and thus fill and distend the same: Where staying too long, the Spirits there∣in are suffocated, whence they can never again move, or return to circulate, but must be discussed and resolved, or brought to Suppuration. Midwifes also may contri∣bute hereto, putting on their hands too oft, or too roughly, while thus it sticks in the Passage. Some rise so big and high as they may feel to be a Buttock, Shoulder, or Knee: Yet are distinguished by their greater hardness and distention, by the Hair also thereon, but better if a Finger can be got over it, to feel the Bones or Parts of the Head within the Orifice which swell not.
To prevent these Tumors, the Orifice must be well mollified, for its better dila∣tation, a more easy and speedy Passage to the Head. To resolve the same (for that is best, while so it makes not another Dis∣ease to the Infant, Suppuration and Incision being dangerous so near the Brain, and for an Afflux of Humors, Inflammation, Con∣vulsion) they may be fomented, twice or thrice a day, with Lukewarm Wine, or Spirit of Wine: Or equal Parts of this and Oyl of St. Johns Wort, and have Compresses applyed wett therein. The Plaister of Dates may also be applyed, with Oyl of Roses. If these Tumors suppurate, the Matter must be timely let out with a Lan∣cet, lest (being of its own Nature acid, and rendered more acrimonious by its stay, it Corrode the Vessels, or Parts about, alter or foul the Bone) the Ʋlcer must be cured, keeping thereat the Plaister of Be∣tony. When a Leg, Arm, or any other Part, is contused and swelled, while long pressed in the Passage, and in a Posture hard constrained, or being come forth, it may be fomented and wrapt up, with Compresses, wet in a Decoction of Wine, with flowers of Roses, Chamemel. Melilot, Elder and the
like, which is proper also for any swelling of the Infants Codds, whether by hurt in bearing, or with Water or Wind contained in their Membranes. If there be Fracture or dislocation, the Bones must be rightly adapted and conjoyned, and securely kept in their natural Place and Figure, with Bolsters or Splinters, till they be well closed and fortified. CHAP. XXIII. Of the Mould and Sutures of the Head being too open. WEakly Infants, and such who come before the time, these also Corpu∣lent and Fat, abounding with Potuit, have the Fountain or Mould of the Head very open and large a long time, soft and beg∣ging, the Bones so far distant, as they are almost without support, yeilding to each side, some the breadth of a Finger: And such are most subject to the Rickets, Chin-Cough, bad Thrushes, and at length to Scrofu∣la's.
These Heads must not then be prest close together, nor bound strait, else the Frame of the Brain may be too much perverted, and its Motion marred, with out which One cannnot live: But be easily upheld, and made somewhat steady, with a little Cross∣cloath softly tyed about; keeping also a warm Compress of Wool, Scarlet, or a Plaster upon the Open, while by degrees with the Age, it straiten, grow together and close: Or that soft Membrane, dry and solidate into a bony hardness: Tho' Some will have it still a Membrane, and that the Bones themselves grow out under its borders by little and little, till at length they go to∣gether and fill up that Gap. These Bones unite, and the Head closes sooner or later, as the Infant is more or less strong, or a∣bounds with more or less Humidity: and not till after 9 or 10 Months, mostly when they begin to speak, or about the end of 2 years: Some are 3. yea and not seldom to the 4t. or 5t. Some even to the 8t. or 10th Though that softness most rarely remains in elder Persons, yet found in Some even to old Age. Yet Some will have this Mem∣branous soft Cover, or Gap to be ever solidat∣ed when Children begin to speak distinctly.
The Fountain or Mould of the Head is last hardened and closed, at the joyning to wit of the Sagital Suture in the midle of the Coronal, which passing, it ever di∣vides in two (as also the Bone of the Front, of which the Gap of the Fountain is consti∣tuted, rather then of that of the Forehead) and runs out to the Root of the Nose: And found very oft to stretch back also, to the beginning of the Spinal Marrow, through the Midle of the Hind-Head, dividing the same likewise. Some have the Sutures kept wide open, and the Bones far distant, in an Hydrocephale, or Dropsy of the Head, from extravasated Water, or Serum of the Blood, though this more rare: And is of different Sorts more or less dangerous, as it is intern or extern, or as the Matter is collected nearer, or further from, or in the Brain. The blame hereof is frequently laid to Midwifes ignorance, in handling or pressing the Head too rudely in the Labour: Or the Nurse in wringing it exceedingly, or busk∣ing it too strait, whereby the Commissures are rent and misplaced, the little Conduits and Lymphatick Vessels chiefly, are some∣what wrested, and gets a non-natural Si∣tuation; whence the Motion of the Humors
is impeded and a little sisted, and so the Humidity expressed and collected within the Skull, recoyling upon the Ventricles, Membranes and Bones: Great prudence therefore, is requisite and circumspection in handling the same. Yet is generated sometimes and collected in the Womb. It is a Malady most familiar, and almost pro∣per to Infants, yet rarely Cures for that they cannot suffer the Hydragogues and more valid Discussives: Yea is quite desperate, when the Waters are in great abundance among the Membranes under the Skull, or while the Lymphatick Vessels within the Head are obstructed and split, and the Hu∣mor effused upon the Brain, its Circuits, Wondings and Cavity. For Cure, the Head is to be gently swa∣thed and kept warm, the Infants Crying, Cough, Sneezing evited, the Excretion of Snot promoted, all warm Cephalicks also are used, Aromaticks and others, which may incide, attenuate, open, dry and evacuate the extravasated Matter: In Fomentations, Spirituous Tinctures, Liniments, Cataplasms, Plaisters: The Nurse beside must keep a a convenient Dyet; and if these in some time avail not, Cauters are applyed to the
Hinder-head, or Neck, to the protuberant Part, or Sutures of the Head, yet without piercing the Bone: And may profit, if the Matter be without the Skull, Yet are dangerous, the soft Brain being near: Cupping-Glasses also are ordered, as is Incision, safest of all; and that either by a simple Line, Cross or otherwise, that the Water may be evacuated, which yet must not come all, or too much at once, but by little and little: Careful the Cold Air hurt not the Brain: Though these Operations hath readily bad success, Convulsions and Feavers arising. CHAP. XXIV. Of the Closed Fundament. SOme of both Sex, are born (though truly rare) having the Fundament im∣perforated, or quite closed: Yea even So∣lid. And Some have had the Gutt twice grown together by the Sides, twice also intercepted with a double Orbicular Mem∣brane: And must therefore be speedily opened, else they die. The Apertion is difficil and dangerous, lest while the Funda∣ment
is perforated, the Sphincter should be hurt, or that it grow together again, and so all labour be lost. One must here dili∣gently heed, whether the Fundament may be opened, without wronging the Sphincter: Because if haply the whole Muscle be grown together, and the Cavity of the Gutt entire∣ly closed, yet Nature hath formed another Way for the Excrements of the Belly, to the Privities in the Girle, who voids them there-through, to the Bladder in the Boy, who voids them by the Urine in plenty enough, Incision is not to be tryed: yet Some are found, who can excern nothing either Way, and such be sure cannot live unopened. Where the End of the Gutt is covered with a single Membrane, or Skin grown over, the Operation is more secure, the right Place for Incision being manifest, by the livid Impression of the Excrements with a Softness; and if the Membrane be tender and fine, it may be pierced with the Fin∣ger, if thick and robust, it must be open∣ed with a Knife (some say a Caustick) the Place being most diligently marked. Some order the Incision simple or length wayes, Others Cross, and Some round, not being so ready to grow together again.
If the Excrements be hardned and vent not by the Apertion, a little Emollient Glyster may be given. The Incision must be kept open, with a little Tent of Linnen, Spunge or Lead; to be armed at first with Honey of Roses, and toward the end with some drying astringent Medicine, which brings a Cicatrice, and absolves the Cure. Careful this while to clean the little tender Wound of the Infants Excrements assoon, and as oft, as ever he renders them, and dress it again. Sometimes a sort of thick Flesh grows up into the Fundament, so that the end of the Gutt can be no way perceived, and then the Incision is very difficil, and hath great ha∣zard; yet must be performed (being Death however) to wit, by entering a little Knife of one Edge, and with the Back turned up, into the void Place, within half an Inch of the Rump, against the End of the Gutt, thrusting it so forward, as to make Open enough for free vent to the Matter: Very careful of the Sphincter, dressing the Wound as above directed, and with regard to the ensuing Accidents. If the Urinary Pass be stopt, either in Male by Coalescence of the Prepuce. or closure of the Hole of the Nutt: Or in Female, by Coalescence or closure of
the Vulva, Apertion must in like manner be made, for the rent to the Urine. CHAP. XXV. Of Cutting the Tongue when tyed. THe great Creator, hath provided to the Tongue (beside other Tyes) a Mem∣branous valid Ligament in its midle beneath, for Strength, Stability and insertion of its Muscles, And whereby it is fastened to the under Parts, lest it should be moved every way more then is meet: Nature hereby shewing what moderation is to be had in the use of it: The String is only the lax end or extremity of this Ligament, which must leave the Tongue so free at Tip and both Sides, as to be rightly turned and moved to all differences of Motion, or every way at pleasure. Yet this is very oft too short, and extended almost to the end of the Tongue, in a small Membranous Production, whiles also alongst both Sides, thus fettering the same so wholly, as to marr its free and convenient Motion: And so makes frequent∣ly
a necessity of cutting it, lest it should be an Impediment of the Childs sucking and future Speech: Yet scarce One of 100s needs this Operation, except it manifestly hinder the putting out of its Tongue and Sucking: But many think the Speech would not be perfect without it, and Some would have it forborn till the time of speaking. This Section though easie, and Midwifes usually do it (yea Some with their Nails, a pernicious Custom) yet needs a skilful Hand, and a clear view of the Part, for avoiding the adjoyning Parts, the Branches of Veins, the Nerves beneath, upon pricking of which a suddain Convulsion of the Tongue uses to superveen: Yea the Salival Ducts, which lying so near the String, are most easily hurt by deep Cutting, whence a continual Sa∣livation. Some have been immediatly Choak∣ed with Blood: and whiles there arises In∣flammation with Pain, which hinders the Sucking whence Death. To cut the Tongue right, which must be done with a Bistery, or broad pointed sharp Scissars, let it be heaved straight up, with a Finger on each side of the String, or rather with the Branches of a small Fork blunt at the Points, then cutting dextrously
cross so much thereof as is necessar: And to prevent its growing together again, let a clean Finger, dry, or wet in Honey of Roses, be past between 3 or 4 times a day, yet very foftly, lest the little Wound be fret∣ted into Inflammation or Ulcer. CHAP. XXVI. Of Pains and Grips of the Belly. THey are very oft the 1st. and a most common affliction to new born Babes: So very atrocious and incessant in Some, that they cry, toss and wake perpetually till they die: And oftimes kindles a most acute Fea∣ver, which being less skilfully guided, be∣reaves most Infants of their Lives. They are said to proceed in general and for the most part, from the sudden change of its State: In particular (though the Cause is oftimes hid) from some pricking Matter in the Guts, be it the Excrements new or old, or some acid Humor or Juyce, corroding and shearing the same (for Acidity exerts it force chiefly in the 1st▪ wayes of all) or then a
Flatuosity or Wind distending them. A foul or more gross Milk gives rise thereto, as does also an overcharge or oppression of Milk, or Pap, if Viscuous and Flatulent: whence Obstructions, Indigestions, Crudity, Cor∣ruptions, Grips, and many other Evils, espe∣cially while they get both together. Cold likewise, chiefly of the Evening: And smetimes Worms, though they hardly breed before the use of more solid, or milk Meats. Sometimes there is a Loosness therewith, green, yellow, or other Colour: And some- also the Epilepsy or Convulsion Fitts. The Grips Epidemick to Infants, grow every year so frequent, from the middle of July, to the middle of September, that more small ones die in one Month that time, then in 3 or 4 other Months more temperate: for that the yearly Heat of the Season, uses to ex∣haust their strength quite. The Cure must chiefly tend to Correct, Temper and blunt the excruciant Matter, that it may then be evacuated, solve the Coagulation, remove the Obstruction, discuss and expel the Flatuosity (a most frequent Cause thereof) and the rest: Which are held best performed by the Testaceous Bo∣dies above mentioned, in full and fre∣quent
Dose, and Reubarb▪ Oyl of Almonds is held good with Sugar Penid: As is Sy∣rup of Anisceds: Some Gutts also of the Oyl, with Sugar and Milk in the Morning: The Powder thereof likewise, with Powder of Saffron, Florence-orris and paeony Roots some Dayes together. One may rub also upon the Belly and Navel, or apply with greazy Wool, Oyl of Almonds, of Orris-roots, Chamemel, Walnuts, Dill, Caraweys, Cumin, Fennel, Nutmeg, Bricks, Oyntment of Althaea, or other Aromatick warming Anodin and discutient Applications. Careful withal, the Infant be kept from Cold, and be fed spa∣ringly this while: getting nothing Viscous or Flatulent: let his Belly also be kept open. Some make the Nurse use Spices, Anis, Fen∣nel, or Carrawe Seeds, or their Oyl in all She Eats or Drinks. A Plaister is laid to the Navel for Worms, of Aloes, Centaury, Savin, Chamemel Flowers, with Burgundy Pitch and Turpentine: To which sometimes a little Colocinth may be added. And if the Grips encrease, an Antidote or Cordial is used, which must be rightly accomodated to the Infant State, the Cause of the Disease and its Symptoms.
CHAP. XXVII. Of the Inflamation, Ulce∣ration, shooting forth, and Rupture of the Navel. SOme Infants are so cruelly tossed with these Grips in the beginning▪ and keep so incessant in fierce Cryes, that the String is forced off ere the Navel close, or be intirely cicatriced and sound: whereupon happens Inflammation and Ʋlcer. And this way also (as by the force of a most griev∣ous Cough and violent agitation of the Breast and Belly) comes the Exomphale, or shooting forth of the Navel, which in Some is hugely dilated and thrust outward, the bigness of an Egg, even when outwardly healed, the Blood being thus driven back into the remaining end of the Vein, which it oftimes opens by its acrimony, and makes this Dilatation of the Navel; And corrup∣ting therein by its stay, must needs cause an Inflammation: The tyed Part also coming now to fall off, before it was perfectly healed, there remains a very bad Ʋlcer: Hence
sometimes great bleeding ensues, the Na∣vel being broken within, and perhaps Death. Some will have it to be thus Inflamed and Ulcerated, from the ill Tying and Cutting (appearing thus soon after) as too hard, or too near: Or when a larger part is left than ought: Others for that the serous Humor or Ʋrin hath flowed thither. Sometimes it stands our like the Yard, which Some judge to be the Intestin broken out there, Some the Caul, Some a serous Humor, Some Wind: And Some to be Flesh grown up, which hath been made to fall away, being deadned with a Ty drawn every day strait∣er. And tho the Navel be common to all as a beauty, placed in the midle of the Belly, yea of the whole Body; yet when thus it stands out further than it ought, it is monstruous and ugly. The chief care in this case must be, to remove what makes the Infant Cough and Cry, and appease him. One may apply to the Inflamed Navel (for Suppuration would be prevented) little Compresses wet in Rose water with Sugar of Lead: Or in Oyl of Roses with a little Vinegar: Or lay thereto Ʋnguentum Rostum and Album, or Nutri∣tum mixed: Or Bole Armen, Blood-stone,
with Rose Vinegar and Whites of Egg: The rest also against Inflammation. If it remain ulcered after the String is off, the Red dry∣ing Oyntment may be applyed, Diapompholi∣gos, the Ceruss or Chaulk Plaster, or Dia∣palma: Or Rags wet in Lime Water alone, or boyled with Mercurius Dulcis, or wet with the Dissolution of Alum, or white Vitriol in Plaintain water. If the Ʋlcer be small, dry Linnen serves alone, or with a little Powder of Chaulk, Bole, washed Tutty, Ca∣laminar stone, or of a worm eaten Tree: keeping still a Compress and Swath thereat, till it be whole and sound. The Ruptures of Infants Navels, be they bigger or less, must only have Compress and Ligature applyed: Some make also Glewing and Astringent Applications, as in other Rup∣tures. If the Navel should be too much extenuated, or made thin (and sometimes it is dilated even to receiving the Intestins in its Rupture) it may split and the Gutts fall out. If an Imposthum of any depth or bigness succeed an Inflammation, it ever kills the In∣fant, who must not be medled with, but let die, especially if weak: For that if the Imposthum be opened, the Matter vents, but the Gutts must also soon come after.
CHAP. XXVIII. Of Infants Scaldings. THey happen mostly in their Grons, Buttocks and Thighs, which soon turn Red and nflamed, the tender Skin being easily hurt and eaten off, by the Heat, Moi∣sture and Acrimony of their Excrements, if they ly swathed, wet and foull a little too long, through the Nurses neglect. For the prevention thereof, let the In∣fant be still kept Clean and Dry, timely shifted with well washed dry Clouts and Blanket, carefully ragging up these Parts each time. For Cure, let the Place be well cleansed of Excrements, and then fomented with Plantain and a little Lime Water mix∣ed, or with a Dissolution of White Vitriol. If there be great Pain and Redness, with some lukewarm Milk or Ptisan: There may be also strawed on it, a little Ceruss, washed Tutty, Calaminar Stone, Powder of rotten Trees, or white Starch: It may be stroaked over with Ʋnguentum Album, Nutri∣tum, or Diapompholigos: The Nurse be∣sides must keep a cooling Dyet, to temper
the Acrimony of the Infants Ʋrin, con∣tracted by her Heat, or hot Nutriment. CHAP. XXIX. Of Ulcers of the Mouth. THey proceed chiefly from the Heat, Acrimony, or other bad Quality of the Milk, which thus affects their Mouths in passing: From its Indigestion also and Corruption in the Stomach, upon surcharge, or through some fault thereof; from whence (as from intern Inflammation, a preterna∣tural Effervsscence of the Body, happening about the Hypoconders) acrimonious sharp Vapours arise and flee up, as from a Caldron, through the breathing hole of the Mouth, fixing into a kind of Chaulky Excrement (yet Some are Red, Others Black, which are the worst) over the whole Mouth and Tongue, beginning at the Gums, pricking, eating and quickly ulcerating the little thin Skin, by reason of its softness and lax Pores: Marring the liberty of Sucking, causing Death also, if not Cured.
If they arise from a simple Intemperature of the Nurse and Milk, or of the Infants Bowels or Humors, they are small, super∣ficial, without Inflammation, and easily Cure without spreading: If Venereal, Ma∣lignant, Scorbutick, they turn putrid, make Corrosion and deep Crusts, spreading to the Jawes and Gullet, Yea Some thorow to the very Fundament, chiefly the Venereal, increasing and wasting the soft and tender Infant, which can rarely then recover, be∣ing unable for these severe Specificks, with∣out which they Cure not. For Cure of these more benign (beside the change of the Nurse, or correction of her Milk, by a convenient cooling Dyet, Bleeing also and gentle Purging if necessar) the Infants Belly must be kept open, to carry the Cause downward, using Syrup of Ru∣barb, Violets, Roses Solutive, Manna, and the rest: There may be frequently stroak∣ed into his Mouth, a little Honey, or Syrup of Roses, or of Mulberries, Brambles, Pomgra∣nats, and others Cooling and Astringent: or a Gargle may be made, mixing there∣with water of Plantain, of Roses, Barley, Sage, Strawberries, and the like, a little Juyce of Lemons, a gut also of Spirit of Vi∣triol,
if there be no Inflamation (for then may Juyce of Housleek be added, of Purslain, or Night-shade) a little Salt Prunell, or in in its place a grain or two of crude Allom: washing softly with a small Ragg, or Cotton, upon a Stick, and dipt therein. Some use a mixture of Rape Oyl, or Oyl of Almonds: or yet Honey and Sugar mid way thick: Some the Yolk of an Egg beaten with Rose Water: Some mix Milk with Rose or Bar∣ley Water, Mucilag also of Althea Roots, and Quince Seeds. Some use the decocti∣on of Fluellin, or Speedwel, of Vervain also, with Honey of Roses: First rubbing twice or thrice after sucking, with the decocti∣on of Jews Ears in Milk. Yet the Testace∣ons Powders above-mentioned, which pow∣erfully retund, yea, even remove the Acrimo∣ny, and most gentle Catharticks are held far better to be used then Gargarisms. The Malignant Ʋlcers requires Applica∣tions more sharp and strong, and that to their Bigness, Depth, and Corruption; which may operate as in an Infant, with a most swift light touch, Cauterizing the same, to oppose the pravity of the Hu∣mours which cause them, and so prevent their increase: As Spirit of Vitriol, or Sul∣phur,
with Honey of Roses; burnt Allom also, Allom water, Aegyptian Oyntment, and the rest: yet must be used in such form, as they may not go further then the Pal∣lat, still mixing what is grateful to the taste: washing the Mouth after with Plantain wa∣ter, or a decoction of Barley and Agrimony, and honey of Roses, that no sharp Serosi∣ties may distil upon the places not yet Ul∣cered, and upon the Throat. Repeating these so oft as is needful, and till they be found to spread no further. CHAP. XXX. Of Teething. THE Teeth being bred, or begun in the Womb with the other Parts, and hid some while, gradually perfecting in the Jaws and Gums (for it is rare and strange to be born Teethed, yet is not found to for∣token ill in men, though of black and dis∣mal consequence in Women) cut the same, and start out 7 or 8 Months mostly after the Nativity, though in some much sooner, even from the Fifth, who are said to have less pain, yet the Teeth weaker: Others
are much later, some even over the Year, and such have greater pain, but stronger Teeth; yea, some to the third or fourth, though more rarely. And mostly also comes the upper soonest, (yet to some the neather sooner) and first the Cutters or Foreteeth, as sooner perfect, more small and sharp, the Jaw thinner in that Part, and they with∣al first needed. Next the Eye or Dog-teeth Last the Grinders or Cheek-teeth. Some have been found born with one continued Tooth in the upper Jaw. The Teeth cuts the Gums and breaks out, with more grievous sharp Pain, than Pricks in the Flesh: Whence many health∣ful thriving Infants, take Coughs, Thrushes, Fluxes of the Belly, or yet Constipations thereof, Feavers, Epilepsies, Convusions, Swo∣ings and others, of which many die, espe∣cially while the Dog-teeth comes out: As also where the Gums are more solid and hard, the Teeth broad and blunt, and come our slower, or many together: And in In∣fants very gross, humorish and costive (for they who have a loose Belly, are ever bet∣ter than they who are bound) whence a greater Flux of Humors to the pained Place. Yet Some are still more, some less afflicted,
for their natural Conctitution, or as the Flesh of the Gums is softer or more hard. Signs of Teething, are Itch, Pain, and Swelling of the Gums, a great heat and dry∣ness of their Mouths, into which they have oft their Fingers, Slavers much, Wakes, Frets, Tosses, Whines, Crys, have Gripings, green Stools and Vomiting, Feavers, Convulsions, and the other forenamed Symptoms: Wak∣ens Starting and Crying, the Teeth may be also discerned pointing the Gums, which are thin and pale, or white at Top, where they start out, and red at the Sides. In the painful Teething, the Infant must suck a good, cool, well tempered Milk: and may get whiles against its great Heat and Ebullitions of the Blood, some Syrup of white Poppies in Cichory water, or Syrup of Le∣mons, Pomegranates, or Rizars in boyled water: Yet must not hold any thing actu∣ally cold in his Mouth. His Belly must be kept open, which yet readily then exceeds. His Gums also may be softly rubbed now and then with ones Finger, or a little pou∣dered Sugar, to be rarified, and more easi∣ly cut. Some Instrument uses to be provid∣ed for him to rub upon, of Ivory, Crystal, Silver, or other solid smooth Matter: Usual∣ly
a Silver Corral with Bells. Some put a Wolfs Tooth: He may have a litle new Wax Candle, or Liquirish stick to champ on. Several things beside are to be rubbed upon the Gums, held special for easy Teeth∣ing, as Hares, Rabbits, Pigs or Sheeps Brains, with pure Honey: Ashes of Dogs Teeth with Butter, or Honey: Fat of Hens: Blood hot from a Cock's Comb, and many others: Which yet avail only as they soften and rarify the Gums, and ease the Pain: For which One may use Oyl of Almonds, Pop∣pies, Cream, Butter, Honey: Unwashen grea∣zy Wool about its Neck gives ease. And where nothing can further their Eruption, because of the hardness, thickness and so∣lidity of the Gums, or the Infants weakness, they may be cut open, to prevent mortal Symptoms: Yet must only be done when the Tooth is now become more big and large, swells and notably inflames the Gum, being ready to come out, and working with all force to break thorow it: And with a Pen Knife also, or other which hath a thick Back like a Razr, and not a Lan∣cet, which doth hurt, or is quite ineffe∣ctual, and this without peril of great Pain, Bleeding or Inflammation.
CHAP. XXXI. Of Infants Looseness. INfants being of a soft soluble Substance, & sustained with a moist liquid Food, take readily a Looseness upon the least Indisposi∣tion, especially in Teething, having then Watchings, Unrest, a great Commotion and Ebullitions of the Blood, Fluxions from the Head: Whence the Coctions are blunted, indigestions, Crudities, and Corruption a∣bound, and store of Salt acrimonious sti∣mulating Humors are generated, which fall down and trouble the Gutts: Or from a turgency of ile there, with a predomining Acid. It may arise also from bad and im∣pure Milk, or when too plentifully Suckt, which sours and comes off Grumy: From a weak humid Lax Stomach, debility of the retentive Faculty, and the rest as in the arged. An easy moderat Loosness is nothing in the beginning, and in a strong gross Humo∣rish Child, hich also in the of Pain Teeth∣ing saves from Cenvulsions, and is not then to be rashly stopped: Yet if tedious and vex∣ing, with Grips, Feaver, Drought, ill Smell,
loss of Appetite and the like, it must soon melt and wash its soft delicate Substance, dissipate the Spirits, and enfeeble it much. And so for Cure, a slight Infusion of Reu∣barb may be given, or a little of the Pow∣der, or some of the compound Syrup of Cichery, to purge off any noxious Humors from the Guts: Litle Glysters also of Milk with the Yolk of an Egg, a little Sugar or Honey of Violets. And after sufficient Eva∣cuation, astringent Glysters may be given: Astringents likeways and Rboratives by the Mouth if needful, as Syrup of Corral, of dryed Roses, Quinces, Myrtles: A litle Di∣ascordium, Conection of Hyacinth, Mithridat, prepared Corral or Tincture of it, sealed Earth, burnt Harts-horn, Bole Armen, pow∣der of Dock or Srel Seed, of Tormentil Root and the like. Milk Meat also with the Yolk of an Egg. The Belly is to be rubbed with Oyl of Quinces, Mastick, Myr∣tles: The Stomach fomented with Red Wine and Oyl of Quinces, or get Compresses laid thereon wet in Red Wine, boyled with Roses, Balausts, Sumach, Anis, and the like. A∣stringent Cataplasms also are used, Piaisters, and others, according as the vehemency of the Flux, its Causes and Accidents may
require: Yet Some will not have it stopt with Astringents properly called, nor Narcoticks, but with things which mi∣tigates the Sourness that makes all the trouble: Such as Chaulk, Corral, Pearl and others of that Kind, which stills the rag∣ing Humors, that so they may be purged off. The Infant must have good Milk, suck moderatly, and let the Nurse keep a proper Dyet. CHAP. XXXII. Of Infants Vomitings. SOme Vomit the Milk presently, altho' they have not suckt much, and then the fault is in the Milk or Stomach, and such decay. Some vomit only when they suck more than the Stomach can bear, and casts up only that which oppresses, yet keeps and digests the rest: And then they are not sick, but become more Cheary; For the Sto∣mach is right, and they suffer only through Repletion: So that their Vomiting is either from the ill Quality of the Milk, or its In∣congruity with the Stomach: Or then from some Acid, Austere, Irritive Humor, or Heterogeneous Matter in it: And either
generated therein, or conveyed thither from far, by Arteries and Nerves, which pricks, bites and irritates its intern Surface, and chiefly its sensible Orifice: From Overcharge also of Milk, or a delinquency in the Mea∣sure and Manner of taking it: And some∣times from its tepid Sweetness: As by a too great Agitation thereof in the Stomach, while rudely dandled or rocked: From a too strait and painful Suathng upwards: From Cough also. Some void Pituit, but that is oftest the time of Teething. Vomitings are very usual to Infants, but litle heeded: Yet turns whiles excessive, with sore Symp∣toms, and miserably afflicting, being a vio∣lent Motion of the Stomach, very oft in∣voluntary, and most justly held Convul∣sive: And if habitual, must kill the Child through a continual Ejection of Aliment. For Cure (beside the Infants right Go∣vernment as to outward Causes) the peccant Matter is to be gently purged off, with a little Infusion of Rubarb, Syrup of Roses, or of Cichory Compound: And the Stomach af∣ter fortified, giving now and then while empty, a little Syrup of Quinces, Mint, sharp Pomegranates, Lemons with a grain Salt of Wormwood, or Mint: Outwardly Oyl
of Mace, Quinces, Mastick, Mint: Plaister of Crust of Bread, or of Mastick, or Tacama∣haca: Or a Compress wet in Juyce or Water of Mint, or Wormwood, or in Vinegar, or in strong Red Wine, wherein are boyled Roses, Mint, Cloves, Mae, Cinamon: Or a Crust of Bread with these Aromaticks. Theiac also, Mithridat and the like. Yet the Te∣staceous things formerly mentioned, with∣out these, Emeticks or Narcoticks are held to do notably (yea be even Specificks, if any thing else) in this Case, for tempering and sheathing the Acid, that so it may be pur∣ged off. CHAP. XXXIII. Of Epilepsy and Convul∣sion. THey are held to proceed from the ir∣ritation of some notably sharp, au∣stere, pricking Liquor or Juyce (Fumes also or impetuous putrid Vapors) which if it oppress, pinch and afflict what is within the Skull, it then produces that horrible trouble of the Epilepsy, by a Colluctation
as it were, and Combat of the Brain there∣with: But if the Matter flow in upon the Nerves without, sting and stimulate the small Fibres thereof, the Membranes that involves them, and all the Parts under their rule, there arise Convulsions only, where there is not such cruel Symptoms, but only an involuntary Motton of the Parts, with their Ventricosity, Hardness, sharp Pain, Coldness and the rest. And thus as this Matter is variously lodged, fermented and moves, within or without the Brain, so are these troubles excited, the Epilepsy or Convulsion, Erratick and Perodick Fitts produced; and that upon fome one or other Member or Muscle, or more, as they are affected and Spirits sent to their relief. This Morbifick Matter is either contained within the Brain, or flows out from other parts & carried thither by the circulation, as when the Meconium is too long retained, or while a greedy fill of Milk or Meat Sours and turns to Poyson in the Stomach: And for the Nature thereof, the Fits are greater or lefs, longer or shorter, repeated or more rate: and the Symptoms appear more gentle or griev∣ous. Yet Convulsions depends as well upon the Infants strength now near spent and ex∣hausted,
as upon the Acrimony of that Mat∣ter, extimulating the Nerves, irritating and pricking the Spirits, and exagitating them into disordered Motions, or a tumult: And thus after little Ones are sore weakened with this or that Malady, or some misguiding, Convulsions, or at least Draughts, or shaking of the Members seizes them for all, and puts an end to the miseries they are tortured with. They are most familiar to Infants, in whom they are mostly acute, and very oft funest, killing many, either by reason of the rebellant Matter, or of the most grie∣vous subsequent Accidents, and death it self happening oft upon the first Fit; and that by reason oft times the Membranes of the Brain are eroded by the sharpness of the Humour, whence it is wholly overflowed and ppressed therewith. As to Cure, the Irritative Cause must be removed, the Reliques amended, the strength preserved and supplied so far as possible: And thus Evacuations are used up∣wards and downwards, if the Humour be fallen upon the Nerves without: Oyls, Bal∣some, and Oyntments mixt with Spirituous things are applied to the Back-bone, and
the parts affected, in a Convulsion of some particular Member, as Oyl of Turpentine with Ambered Spirit of Wine: Oyl also of Amber, of Marjoram, of Earth Worms, Foxes, Castor: The Nerve Oyntment, Oynt∣ment of Rue, and the like. A Caustick is or∣dered to the Hinder-head (yet profits most where the disease is Idiopathick) as is a Plai∣ster of Ammoniack, Cupping-Glasses also to the Shoulders and Loins: A Vesicatory to the Nape of the Neck, a corroborant Plaister to the Fore-head. Antepilepticks are used in∣wardly, from black Cherries chiefly, Lilly of the Valley, Male Paeony, Lime, or Lin∣den Tree, Divels Bite, Primeroses, Lavender, Betony, Castor: Langius his Water, Syrup of Staechas, Spirit of Harts-Horn, of Salt Ar∣moniack: Oyl also of Amber, of Juniper, which may be infused into the Mouth: as also the Volatil Salts, applyed and rubbed on the Nostrils and Temples in these Fits, in which also the Smoak of Tobacco is blown into its Mouth. The Powder of Gutteta is most frequently used, and some commend the Powder of the 2din. dryed in the shade, but that it be of the 1st Child, and a Male is superstitious. Misselto of the Oak is made a specifick (that part chiefly cut near∣est
the Oak held the more noble) as is the wild Valerian Root: the Gall also of a black Puppy, mixt with Vinegar, or given in Powder, is held a special Cure. Let the Infant suck a tryed Nurse, and may feed up∣on the Milk only: She must use an attenu∣ating, temperate wholsome Dyet, of con∣venient Juyce and Temperature, abstaining things of bad Juyce, of hard or bad dige∣stion, or whatever may vitiate or breed ill Milk. Such who have a hereditary Disposiion to the Epilepsy (and some Families uses to have all their Children killed there∣with) are to get as soon as born for pre∣servation (for which also some order the pregnant Woman Antepilepticks each new Moon after the quickening) some doses of the powder of Gutteta, a Caustick also to the Neck fome days after the birth, and must be purged twice a Month, each New Moon also, yea, every quarter thereof, and in all humid and more changeable Weather, get of the foresaid Powder, have a strengthen∣ning Cep, smeeking Powders, Powders also for the Hair. Some for preservation moi∣stens the Infants Body a little warmly▪ with the Infusion of Castor and Paeony Roots in fine Spirit of Wine, or with the decoction
of lenient and spirituous Herbs: Which things are also to be used for These who have had it (for Some are so obnoxious thereto, that tho once Cured, it returns) having ever respect to the Cause, the Part primarily affected, the Age, Strength and morbifick Insults. Some only add Castor to the Testaceous Powders for Blunting the A∣cidity, that so it may be carried off. CHAP. XXXIV. Of Infants Ruptures. THey arise mostly, from the falling of the Intestin, through Laxity, or then Rupture of the Peritonaeum, tho that rather because of Humidity; and then the Tumor is soft, with Fluctuation and Murmur, and appears on a sudden. In Some it stops in the Groyn (as may the Testicles also oft, long ere they come down, and be taken for a Rupture in that part) in Others it falls com∣pleatly into the Cos: Sometimes the Caul falls down therewith, and whiles the Caul alone, and then the Tumor is less, more Inequal, Slippery, yeilds more hardly to the Touch, is without Noise or Fluctuation,
and ofter on the Share-bone than the Cods, Where the Intestin or Caul fixes upon the Scrotum, if Inflammation follow it is deadly. The Causes may be, a too great Repleti∣on of Meat, their more vehement and long Crying, while abandoned by merciless Nur∣ses, a Cough also, and especially if then they be too strait swathed upwards, plenty of Wind, strong preasing at Stool, and the like. And as Ruptures happen thus more easily in the soft moist Bodies of Infants, so the Bor∣ders of the separated Muscles of the Belly, or Rents of the Peritonaeum, more easily re∣unite in them, close and grow together, dry and fortifie, that nothing can more slide out or fall down, if the Cure be en∣deavoured upon its first appearing: For which, the prolapsed Part must be gently in∣truded and returned into its natural Place, by the Way it fell down, and kept therein, with a Swath or Truss (which must be closed strait enough about the Body▪ and by which alone, when rightly fitted, it hath oft Cu∣red of its self) the Place being fomented before with some astringent Decoction, co∣vered also with the Plaister for Ruptures, or other like binding and glewing: With con∣solidating
and astringent Medicines inward∣ly, tho all hope be in the Externs: Hin∣dering by all means his Crying, Cough Sneezing, Vomiting: Careful withal he be easie swathed, and not press hard at Stool, or what else may force a Relapse: And for a speedier Cure, he is to keep Bed a good time. Some have a Collection of Wind, or yet Water upon the Scrotum, conspicuous be∣twixt and the light, coming from the up∣per Parts, or generated there, through na∣tural weakness of the Part, or violence of the Labour, the Vessels being thus crushed or broken, and the Aliment converting in∣to a Serous watry Substance: for which Fo∣mentations are used, to open, resolve and discuss the Matter, of Calamint, Bay, Mar∣joram, Rosemary, Rue, Sage, Savin, Flowers of Chamemel, Melilot, Elder, Lavender, Seeds of Cumin, Anis, Daucus and the like. A Spung also, with Lime Water and a little Crude Allom to dry up the Water: Or De∣siccativum Rubrum with the Countess's Oynt∣ment: Plaister of Bay-berries and Cumin, with Sulphur vive, Allum and the like: and the greatest part being discussed and dryed up, The Part in end is to be fortified with the
Decoction of strong Red Wine, Roses and Allum: Ever regarding the original Cause hereof: And if it yeild not to these, Chi∣rurgery is used by a simple Incision, which is easy and without peril: Tho yet at length it may discuss through transmutation of the Age into a more robust and dry Nature. CHAP. XXXV. Of Scabs on the Heads and Faces of Infants. THey are the purulency of Humors cor∣rupted in litle Pimples, which perfo∣rating the Skin, dry and harden about into sanious Crusts, or contagious little Ʋlcers, or Scabs, running together, and overspread∣ing the whole Heads and Faces of Some, whiles also in the rest of the Body; Arising sooner or later, mostly when they begin to Suck, and in the Winter. Of these Ʋlcers, Some are Dry and Skaly, Others are Humid, which also are various: Some again are Su∣perficial and White, called then the milky Crust: Or yet are Yellowish, with the Skin red beneath: Others are Black, Thick, Ma∣lignant,
where the Sanies corrod and ulce∣rat deeply, spoiling sometimes even the Skul, that the very Membranes may be seen. They are held to be generated in the Womb, from some Reliques of the menstruous Blood: Or then after the Birth, through the Indi∣gestion and Corruption, or Badness and Impurity of the Milk, The Nurse being ill of a saltish Intemperature: Is sometimes also hereditary. There must be no stop of the Humor, being Nature's Provident and benefi∣cial Ejection of such Impurity, and a mean of the Infants future Health and Im∣munity from many great Diseases, as Fea∣vers, Epilepsies (which oftimes arise, while these Ʋlcers disappear) and others. He therefore must only have a good healthful Nurse (for if it come of the Nurse, she must be changed, or the Infant weaned, else tho it were forced away, it would instant∣ly return) who is to use the best Dyet, that so He may suck pure good Milk, to correct and temper these ill Humors, and prevent any more generation thereof. Let his Belly be kept open, and let him be purged if necessar, with Syrup of Cichory, or of Roses, or with Manna. Sometimes this Disease is
is stubborn and hard to Cure, for that the intern Cure uses not to be looked unto. The Crust may also be brought off for a freer Vent to the Humor, rubbing thereon some Oyl of Almonds, Pomat, Cream or fresh Butter: If it go in, a headed Cabbadge, or Best Leaf may be applied warm, which will suppurate the Humor and make it run again, whereby the Place will come to dry and heal, and so the Crust then fall away of it self. Secure the Infants Hands the while from Rubbing and Scratching thereof, lest the place Inflame. CHAP. XXXV. Of the Small Pox and Mea∣zils. THey are purulent itching Pustuls, dri∣ven out through Ebullition of the Blood (as dregs from new Liquor) here and there, over the whole Body, chiefly the Face and Extremities; of some peculiar matter, or gross sharp Corrosive Impurity, lodged in the Pores of the Parts from the Womb (hence none almost escapes) till some ferment ar∣rive
from the Stars, or other pocky Per∣sons (being most part Epidemick, and in certain Years and Seasons) which excite, expell or eject it, that mixing with the Blood, it is thus separated and cast out; seising mostly the young and tender Bodies, very rarely ofter then once, though in Some twice thrice: Yet Some (but most rarely) never at all. The Meazils differ in degree, hardly in kind, and scarce distinguishable the 1st. 2. or 3. dayes, till the Pox begin to rise manifestly into Pustuls, while the other remains fiery red Spots, or asperities of the Skin like Roses, rising scarce higher then the Skin, and are soon discussed without suppu∣ration; Yet invades more fiercely in the beginning, there being a greater difficulty of breathing, a sorer Feaver, more Tears extilling from the Eyes, and most part shar∣per, Breaks out also for the most part sud∣denly, and over the whole Body, though soonest and principally upon the Face: The Pox slower and successively, now in this part, then in the other. The Blibes are a disease familiar to Children, yet not so universal, nor sore; strike out here and there over the Skin, in bigness and figure like the Pox, mostly without Feaver, are
white, and as it were little clear Bladders, full of serous Matter or Water, break and dry up in 2 or 3 dayes, without trouble or peril. The usual signs precede the Pox (being seen when present) are a continual great Feaver, Drought, a big and frequent Pulse, great Sottishness, frequent Reachings, swel∣ling of the Face, redness of the Eyes, Tears, Itching of the Nose, Sneezing, Vomiting, Hoarsness, Cough, hard Breathing, great un∣rest, Tossing, Heat, Itch and Stingings of the Body, Frights in the sleep, Raving: Sometimes Tremblings, Convulsions, whitish and trou∣bled Ʋrin also, and others which cannot be well discerned in Infants: All which pre∣cede not always in every One, yet the more, the surer prediction of the disease. The Pox is a disease most acute, vile and dangerous: and peril there is not only of great hurt and deformity, but even of death. In some the body decays; yea, whiles some bones, and the very bowels corrupt: whence Dysentery Consumption, Dropsie: oft-times also they exulcerate the Jaws, Stomach, and even the Lungs. They look deadly, when the Feaver, Drought, Sickness, shortness of Breath, and
the other Symptoms continue and augment after they are out: And yet more, when they come out slowly, or turn not into Matter, or into a bad sanious watry Mas∣ter: Are in great number, big, double, run together, turn hard, flat, especially with a black spot in the middle: The green also, livid, black, are ever bad: And these most of all, that disappear quickly, and espe∣cially with a loosness or dysentery; as also where blood is excerned by Ʋrin, Stool, or any other wayes: nor yet are livid or black Excrements or Urin good, neither livid or black spots intermixed with the Pox. If on the contrair, they come soon and easily out, be few, the inner Parts well and more free, be in the beginning red, after wax white, fills well, and ripens soon, of good Matter, are soft, distinct, and raised to a Point, comes in a good season, with laudible Symptoms the while, and the rest, the Infant comes easily off, if but rightly guided. As to this, it is chiefly necessar, an e∣qual Tenor be preserved in the Ebullition of the Blood, Natures time and pace attended, in its due separation, universal despuma∣tion (which is made the 1st. 4. dayes) and expulsion of the Matter by the Pores of the
Skin, the most safe way and not unknown to Nature: that they also bide duely out, and reach their appointed Period and Hight rightly, in the 8, or 9 day. And if this Excretton go duely thorow, and other Symp∣toms urge not, the matter may be commit∣ted to Nature alone, and needs little alte∣ration in Dyet or Government, nor other provision from what was in health; which is even so commonly known, that for the most part this Disease is not so much com∣mitted to Physicians, as to Old Wives. Yet if this Motion of Nature succeed not so right∣ly, as is known by vehemency of the Symp∣toms, or if it become languid, as in Some phlegmatick (these of a thiner Matter comes soonest out) or are very low through some Disease, or have a Loosness, the Physician is needed, and Nature is to be succoured partly by Sudorificks, as Bezoar Mineral, new diaphoretick Antimony, calcined Harts-horn, Bezoar-stone, Contrayerva and the like: Partly by Alexipharmicks, Confection Al∣kermes, Hyacinth, Magistery of Corral, of Pearl, Gascoins Powder and the rest: Espe∣cially when they are Epidemick, or have greater Malignity: And oft wth one Dose of these, they forthwith break out: And
as happily sometimes with a little warm We and Saffron (this being held an Anti∣dot, whence all Cordials here must consist of Saffron) sweet Navew Seed is held good for Eruption, as is Seed of Cresses, of Colum∣bin, Sheeps Dung also (which is held a Specifick haply for no reason) a Decoction of Figs, Raisins and Parsley Roots. If again through neglect, mistake, or other Cause, the Blood heat, inflame, rage and boyl beyond all Measure, with a fulness beside, intense Feaver, Anxiety, difficulty of Breathing, thick red Ʋrin, and other great Symptoms, Bleeding is allowed in the beginning, and while none or but few ap∣pear (which yet is not so readily admitted to Infants) a freer Air, Dyet also and Me∣dicines, not only temperate, but a little more, yea, very Cooling: Yet such as are agree∣able to the Stomach, may please and com∣fort it. But seing the sucking Infant can take little save the Milk, it ought to be tempered, altered and prepared, as may best serve the Intent and answer the Indica∣tions. The Belly tho bound, mus not be rash∣ly opened, and with a gentle Glyste only, The Eyes for defence are to be kept wet
with Breast Milk and Saffron: or a Collyr of Plantain and Rose Water, Camphor or Su∣gar of Lead, and a little Saffron. To the Throat is applyed a Band of Saffron, dipt in Breast Milk, For the Breast and Hoarsness, Syrup of Injubes is given, of Maiden-hair, dryed Roses, Poppies and the like: Some Syrup of Lemons also, of Pomgranates, or of Vinegar to cut the Phlegm: Or some Mix∣ture proper for these Intents, or to preserve the Inwards. They order for the Face, Oyl of Almonds chiefly, Some assoon as they appear, to facilitate their Suppuration, and prevent deep Marks: Others not till they are already ripe, usually about the 9 day. Some add a little Cream: Others use fresh Butter only: Some, pure old Hogs Grease well washed in Rose Water, which they continue till all be Cured. Some use Oyl of Walnuts and Rose Water beaten together. And Some to hinder the Marks will open them when ripe, with a Steel or Silver Needle, for eva∣cuation of the Matter, which putrifying therein makes these Marks. Oyl of Eggs is used for removing the Marks, Oyl of Al∣monds, Sheeps Suet, Hogs Grease with Cam∣phor, Whale-shot with Pomat. And Some order as a great Secret, the Oyl which di∣stills
before the Fire from a Sheeps Web strawed with Grains of Barley: let the In∣fant also be restrained from rubbing and piking them. For the Itching and Ʋlcers, and to remove the Skales, One may apply some Oyl of Poppies, the White Oyntment, Nutritum, Pomat or Oyntment of Lead, Many things more might have been added anent these Diseases and the various Symp∣toms, but the Case being with Infants, where few things take place, and where Women take mostly upon them, these shall suffice. CHAP. XXXVII. Of the Venereal Pox. THis Pox is more Wrackful and Infecti∣ous than the former, imparting its Venom to Infants by every Converse. This they either bring from the Womb of a pocky Mother, which appears in Pustuls and Ʋl∣cers here and there, chiefly about the Belly and Hipps, near the Fundament, the inside of the Thigs, and upon the Head: and some are vilely Scabbed all over. Or are poyso∣ned
by a foul Nurse (as many be) and breaks out in Ʋlcers about its Mouth first and Jaws, yet dispersing Contaminats in time all its other Parts. Infants so born, rarely Cure, but Die, sooner or later, being vi∣tiated in their Principles and whole Substance, or engendered and formed in the Womb of the polluted Seed of either, or both Parents, and vilely also Nourished therein. When it comes by the Nurse, it is not so bad, for that She may be removed: Bside that her Milk receives Concoction in the Infants Stomach, and depuration from the Excre∣ments, and so some Correction: Yet still retains a pernicious Quality, whence it also invenoms and stains the whole Infant by Degrees. A compleat Cure hereof is rarely wrought in Infants, for that because of their Non-Age and Imbecillity, they cannot take, nor endure the proper Remedies without peril of Life: And so were best palliated to a greater Age and Strength: Tho yet this vile Disease, and its horrible Symptoms, does so speedily and deeply impress, and makes such havock of their soft delicate Bodies, that they are soon lost without it. How miserably then are such Infants stated? How∣ever
as to Cure, let a clean Nurse be got, who must use such Dyet and Others as may best qualify her Milk, preserve her also from the Infection. And if no Nurse can be had, the Infant is to be Nourished the next best way may be. The Way of exciting a Flux in Infants (the only Mean of their perfect Cure) is by Mercurial Unctions (tho Some also give Mercury inwardly) and upon the Pustuls and Ʋlcers only, for a small Flux, which must begin almost insensible, and be raised by degrees, yet still very slowly, with re∣iterated Frictions (more frequent also, and a stronger Dose in the progress if necessar) according to the Strength, the diverse Habits, and easiness to Flux, in which there is great difference: Carefully observing the Effects: Soping therefore some Days after a Friction or two, to try its operation and the de∣gree thereof, the only sure way: And so safest to proceed slowly, and take longer tsme: Easier also, to repeat and augment a weak Dose, then stop the Effects when it ex∣ceeds, or while the Humors are moved with such a force, as the Glanduls being so huge∣ly filled therewith, the Infant may be uf∣focated, or its sucking marred and Ʋlcers
raised. Let the Frictions be once each or other day (before the Fire) in a warm Chamber, where he must be kept secure from Cold or Air, with purging also: And while the Flux continues, he is to be kept to one Side, for a better Evacuation of the Humors, whieh must be frequently wiped from its Mouth, using Gargles also of Poppy, Plantain, Rose, Self heal Waters and the like: Or of Barley Water boiled with Agrimony, adding Honey of Roses or Mulberries, Salt-prunel and the rest. And in great pain, luke∣warm Milk with Rose Water, or the Yolk of an Egg, Mucilag of Althaea Roots, or Quince Seeds. Supporting the Infant all that can, to endure the Flux throughly, till it diminish and cease of it self. CHAP. XXXVIII. Of keeping Infants from be∣ing Glied, Awry, Croo∣ked or Lame. A Just decent Figure and Conformation of the Parts and Members of Hu∣mane Bodies is part of Health, a great and
valueable Beauty, yet so easily and very oft marred and spoiled in Infants (their Limbs and Joints being wrested and forced out of due place by reason of their softness and delicacy) that all Providence, Care and Industry is needed to its Preservation, and no less to a Rectification of the Hurts and Deformities thereof, which yet is easier prevented than mended. To prevent Squinting of the Eyes, the noble Luminaries and Lanterns of our Bodies, let Nurses have no such Deformity, neither any more intimat to Infants: And that the Eyes may hold stable, and look straight on, let the Light, or what else they shall look to, be directly before them. To cor∣rect this in Infants (for in the Elder it is not Cured) a Mask is ordered for their Faces, with 2 little Holes answering right to the Eyes, that seeing or receiving the Rayes by these only, they may be confor∣med and reduced to their genuin Situation. To preserve them from turning Awry, Crooked or Lame, let the Parts and Mem∣bers be dressed as formerly directed, each rightly extended and laid in its own Place, and all neatly tyed up in a straight Figure (swathing whiles one way, whiles
another, yet not too hard, which oft deforms the Body and destroys the Proportion) and ever laid in a straight Situation. And when they come to be carried, they must not be kept still sitting in one Arm, nor after one manner, fast catched about the Knees and crouching together, as most Nurses do, which must soon Craze and Crook them in the Knees and Legs; and is almost the only Cause thereof. The disfigured Parts of young Infants, must be helped and kept in right posture, with Swaths and Bolsters only: Yet when grown some bigger, Boots are used for the Crooked Legs, and Shoes hightned at one side for the wry Feet, and closs Stayes, well stiffed with Whale-bone, Pastboord or T, for the disfiguration of Back or Breast, to hinder the further shut∣ting, and hide the Deformity. Some In∣fanes by falling, have their Skull depressed, yet without Fracture (for the Bones there∣of are very thin, so as they may be bowed by a small Pression of any hard thing) & tho then no Hurt appear, yet in time they may hence become Dull, Stupid, Fools, subject to Catarrhs and Pains, while the Brain moves not freely, and so the Animal Spirits are badly elaborated: Such Depressions there∣fore
ought to be presently lift up, by some sticking Plaister, Cupping-glass, or Instrumen of Horn. Nurses also must bewar, that in feeding the Infant, they deform not its Mouth, making it too wide, or choak it. Thus far briefly of the most usual Mala∣dies of Infants: And for any others may befall them, being common with the aged, have nothing to be considered peculiar to them in the Cure, save their Age and de∣licacy. CHAP. XXXIX. Of a Nurse. IT were best, all Mothers might nurse their own Children, not only because of a mutual agreement of the Temperaments, the far greater Analogy of their Milk, with the Food received in the Womb, but also for their greater bowels of Love and Ten∣derness towards their own Fruit, being in∣flamed with an Affection almost invincible, panting after their wellfare, as their own; while hired Nurses pleases themselves too much, and are kind only as they are set by and rewarded: whence oft-times from the
perverseness of their Minds, unruliness of Dyet, secret Maldies, naughtiness of their Milk and other Dbaucheries, many Infants (especially these given out) are either piti∣fully killed, or gets what they never claw off, but lives miserable lives. Few Mo∣thers however with us now a days do it, save the poorer, being wondrous delicate, or because of Cusm, or lest it spoil their Breast, morr their Beae, hasten their decay, straiten their Pleasure and Diverse∣ment, restrict their Dyet, and other Mor∣tifications too hard for these of Quality: yet very many are quite unfit, being weak and sick after Labour▪ or ill disposed in the Bowels of Nutrition, have ill Milk, are worn out and wants Milk, have sore Breasts also and the like; And then the Children of such are more happy in good Nurses: For as some Trees luxuriates more happily, while transplanted to a strange Soyl, and the more fierce Creatures tame with sucking some milder. so many In∣fants are found to recover of the Inteera∣ture they contracted in the Mothers Womb, by sucking a different tempered Milk: Nor are good Nurses hard to be got, and with all the laudible Properties, which are
usually taken from their Age, habit of B∣dy, good Manners, the condition and Na∣ture of their Milk, the Form, not only of their Paps, but of the Niples also, the space from their delivery, the Sex of their last Infant and the rest. Her Age is order∣ed from 25 years to 35, being then in prime Health, Vigor, and Strength: though Some will not have her exceed 0, for the greater force and efficacy of Heat, a greater plenty of Milk, and less of Ex∣crements: yet Others make her indifferent good from 20 to 40, though rarely before or after. She is to be also of a middle Sta∣ture, of a goodly Structure and Symmetry of Parts, a solid firm habit of body, mid∣way fleshy, of a vivid Colour or Complexion also, clear Skin'd, and the Veins Conspi∣cuous: Of a comely Face, with full Splen∣did, sprightly Eyes, of a pleasant smiling Countenance, be clear Voic'd, freely and distinctly spoken, having good white Teeth, a sweet Breath, Black or Chess-nut Hair. She must be neat also and cleanly, healthful and sound of Body throughout, not dispo∣sed or affected with Gout, Gravel, Consump∣tion, King's-Evil, Scurvy▪ Venereal disease, or other contagious Malady, nor be come
of any such, neither intimately Conver∣sant with them: Not Fairntickled, Pox marked: And have neither Itch, Scab, Scd▪ Lice, or other outward Blemish or Impurity. She must not have her Courses, nor be subject to the Whites, neither be with Child. She must next be of praised Manners and disposition of Mind, not Dull, Silly, Melancho∣lick, neither Surly, Morose, Quarrelsome, Wrathful, quickly or vehemently affected with Passion, (which either puts away the Milk, or troubles it, hurts the Child, and haply gives it the Epilepsy) but of a tranquill calm, meek Spirit, Prudent, Rational, Merry and Pleasant, Sober also and Tem∣perate, Vigilant, Chast (tho' if she be Hyste∣rick, to wit, of a more tender and delicate Temperament however Chast, the Milk degenerates and is more gross) avoiding strong Drink, or Venery and all Incentives thereof, tho' yet she is allowed a Li∣berty in the last with her own Husband: yea, and to be with Child also without spilling the Milk: Though it is best she keep free, or forbear after from giving Suck. As to the Nature and Condition of the Milk, it is requisite she have great plenty there∣of, rather too much then too little, the
over-plus▪ may be turned away: Good al∣so, pure and sincere, not too Serous, Thin and Fluid, nor very Viscous, gross and Cheesy, but of a middle Consistence, that if dropped upon the Nail, or Hand, Glass, or Platter, it coheres and stands unite like a Pearl, yet remains not fixt, but slides gently off, in proportion to the turning of the Hand, leaving the place a little stained: Or if putting a Hair therein, it stick to it, the Consistence is said good, if it run down it is thin. It must be sweet also, of an insipid not sugar'd sweetness, pecu∣liar to all Milk: Free of all Acrimony, Bitterness, Acidity, and Saltness: And smell sweetly, casting out at least some lit∣tle thing of a pleasant smell, and have no sour stinking or bad Scent, as in Some. It must have also a good or Milky Colour, a blewish or pale white: Yet the more bright and purer white the better. As to the Form of her Paps, they are required indiffe∣rent big, fleshy, firm, yet not dense, nei∣ther flaggy, pondous and hanging, as Some who have them the length of their Bellies, or can turn them over their Shoul∣ders: Full of many big and soft Glanduls, streams of large and patent Vessels: And
must not be wrinkled, nor have any Ex∣ternal Blemish. The Niples must be of a middle Magnitude and Length, for the Infants Mouth, being a Funel to convey the Milk thereinto: of a moderate firmness, yet not hard or griftly: Must be sound also and entire, well holed, easily suckt. It is required moreover to a good Nurse, that she be not in use to Part, and been brought to Bed at full time, of a lively Boy, the 2d. also or 3d. and so have given proof: fully also cleansed, well settled and reco∣vered of Child-Bed: A Mouth at least af∣ter Labour: Yet the Milk not older: Care∣ful so far as possible, that her Delivery, and the Birth of the Child she is to Nurse fall near together; for that a more serous and thinner Milk is best for new born In∣fants, that it may purge the more: While an old Milk is grosser and so less apt: But this is mostly neglected, so that one and the same Nurse is sometimes continued still for the next Child also, giving it only for cleansing, Syrup of Violets, or Roses: Or Oyl of sweet Almnds with Sugar. A Nurse however with these Properties may well be preferred, yea. for a Prince; Pro∣viding still she keep a regular Dyet, or use
good wholesome Victuals, of convenient Juyce and Temperature and here are Phy∣sitians no less concerned then in their Ele∣ction, the goodness of the Milk, and the Infants wellfare, as well as their own depen∣ding thereon) abstaining the more hot A∣liments, and Drink, or Liquors exceeding∣ly waming: These also which are of hard digestion: Victuals likewise colder then ought, of indefecate impure Juces. All things moreover which are of bad digesti∣on, or any wise Intemperate: And must also keep good Order and due Mediocrity in sleeping and waking, Exercise and Mo∣tion and the rest. If beside, she fall sickly and indisposed, or her Milk any way al∣tered and vicious, she best be removed, for that a bad Milk can never be mended, save when it happens so by ill Dyet. These are the things most Courteous Reader, which I have observed, and col∣lected here and there, as they have been profitably delivered by many: which also I have for my intended brevity▪ thus pre∣pared, and was willing to publish, for the utility and wellfare of bearing Women and Infants: Which if well liked, I may haply yet publish more of that kind for the pub∣lick
good. Or if any Others of more e∣gregious Gifts of Mind, would by their finer Ingine, polish and trim this Course and Imperfect Work, and render it more Com∣pleat, they might never repent the Enter∣prise, being so necessar to Mankind, so glo∣rious and profitable to themselves: Accor∣ding as other excellent Men, and eminent in the Medical Art, have as to this part thereof, left very famous Monuments of their Ingine, and published it at several times: And I be ure should take it well: in the mean time use these to the best ad∣vantage till better come.
