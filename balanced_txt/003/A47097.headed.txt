A FURTHER EVIDENCE Of the aforementioned THOMAS HEWET His DISAFFECTION To the PRESENT AVTHORITY Of this NATION, And his perfect enmity against the people of God is cleerly made out in that eminent (but most wicked) piece of service, which (as a Magistrate, and yet no Justice according to his own Testimony) was per∣formed on the first day of the week, the 28th of the 6th moneth, 1659. THe plot failing against the honest Interest and people of the Nation, for sacrificing and root∣ing out all the faithful in the Land, especially them that go under the Name of Quakers (as some of the conspirators for excusing, or at least extenuat∣ing their offences) have neither been ashamed nor affraid to confesse; That people being most out of fashion with the World, as bearing that Testimony which the World cannot bear, a Generation whereof the World is as weary as it is unworthie; So that it was believed a conspiracy against them would scarce be construed in general a crime; and
therefore these were first to be taken off, and it was con∣ceived the thing might be accomplished before another meeting at Sabridgworth; But the snare being broken, and the enemy and adversary disappointed of their ex∣pectation; Thomas Hewet, (though wise enough in his Ge∣neration to keep out of the way of danger from forfeiting his estate) could no longer despence with these meetings of the Quakers so neer the place of his worship, least it should prove as ominous and destructive thereunto, as the approach of the Ark to the image of Dagon, and in time should discover the falsnesse and filthinesse thereof; wherefore at ever: streets end, and at all places of en∣trance into the Town, he sets a strong guard of those Ruffians (who behaved themselves so valiantly in flinging stones, brickbats, dirt, &c, at men, women, and chil∣dren, two monethly daies before, without the least resi∣stance, armed with holbarts and other weapons, with this charg as was confessed by the Constable, Wi. Graves him∣self, before some Justices & Commissioners for the Militia of the County of Hartford, to keep out the Quakers, and prevent their meeting, which was so grevious and offensive to himselfe and his neighbours (as he then said) that they could not bear it; he would not undervalue himself so much as to let them come in, and then with the Gadarenes intreat them out, a saucy and unsociable people, as he terms them, but with a far worse spirit commands them to be kept out. They that live in darknesse are affraid of the light, because their deeds are evil; the prince of Dark∣nesse is very jealous of being surprized by the Children of Light; and therefore raiseth what forces he can to secure his territories; among which Thomas Hewet appears as Cap∣tain of a Company of Volunteer Desperadoes (for he could not appoint y word as a civil Magistrate, though be termed himself so at first, not being sworn to the Of∣fice of a Justice (as afterward he acknowledged) but refu∣sing indeed to swear when the oath was tendered by the Clerk of the Peace, for fear of the engagement, or being made subject to do service for the Common-Wealth) who
kept the place for two hours, and kept out all honest peo∣ple that came to that meeting, until a party of about 8 of the County horse, commanded by a Corporal, which wee sent thither upon notice of the wicked design of the inhabitants to keep the peace, made their approach, and then that arm of flesh was soon broken. There was some small dispute between the Wardmen and Souldiers, and some blowes exchanged, the Ward-men saying, they were charged to keep out the Quakers from meeting and dis∣arm the souldiers (if they could) and put their horses in the Pound, so that some of the Souldiers received great knocks; but the issue was, that the Ward-men were for∣ced either to fly, or yeeld, for though their hearts were high enough to do mischief, yet they quickly became as Nabals, and sanck down as a stone, except some few, who could hardly be restrained from making disturbance. By all which it appears how much the Common-Wealth is beholding to this Thomas Hewet, who will not own the power to do good, as to the correcting offen∣ders, or relieving the oppressed, but will never want power to do an unjust act. Before he came to town this meeting was peaceable, and there was no disturbance; but he brought that spirit along with him that raised this dis∣order; His countenance, carriage and expressions toward them that were abused, before the injurious party, did speak enough. When Edward Burrough was before him (all be dawb'd with the dirt his filthy neighbours had thrown upon him) to complain of the abuse; one of them pul'd off his hat, and another dash't a rotten egg upon his bare head, whereat he was so well pleased that he could not forbear smiling, though some of it flew into his coach. He hath confessed the meeting is a great offence to him, That he set a guard to keep them out of Town that came to it, pretending ignorance of any allowance of liberty from the present Authority: His men have made up the number of Rioters, and threatened very strange things, and confesse their Master sets them on. And he that was the busiest and basest Instrument amongst that unreasona∣ble
company, Ralph Curtis by name (that brake open the house where the meeting was kept, threw in many things of offence, cut off a yard of John Goodmans coat that stood within his reach, and was one of the three that knocked him down, and were like to kill him; did also impound the horse of Daniel Halden who fled into his fathers yard for shelter almost spoiled, kept him a fortnight in the midst of harvest though twice sent for, and at last exacted ten shillings for the trespasse, and had it declares that Sr. Tho∣mas Hewet bade him pound that horse or any of the Quak∣ers horses, & the said Thomas himself had five shillings for poundage, and keeping this horse thus forcibly detained. Which plainly declares that this Thomas Hewet hath not onely been passive in permiting these abuses and high misdemeanours, but active, beyond measure, and beside his Authority. Such is his zeal to promote the interest of the wicked one, that is in the World, and rules in the hearts of the children of disobedience, that he ventures discretion, reputation and all to serve it. He that disdains to be the Servant of Christ will stoop to a worse office. The God of this World hath so blind∣ed and besoted men that they chuse by contraries, as void of all reason and understanding; and therefore it con∣cerns the Powers of the Nation to put such men in com∣mission, as have hearts to do good, and not such as lie in wait to do evil, and seldom make use of their power but to colour over and cover iniquitie. Collected and testified by one that is no enemy to the person of any man, but a friend to them that fear the Lord. I. K. THE END.
