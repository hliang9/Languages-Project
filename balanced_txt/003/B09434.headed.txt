[1] ROuze up ye Tories Of this actious Land, Now LOYALTY Hath got the Upper-hand: The Rabble-Rout Their Errours shall disclalm, And Homage pay To YORK's Illustrious Name; The London Mayor Is faithful to his Trust, And the two present Sh'riffs Wou'd fain be counted Just; And every actious Rebel Through the Town agree To shew the heighth Of London's Loyalty. [2] Now the loud Threat'ning Tempest is dispers'd, And all their shamming PLOTS Are quite revers'd; Great JEMMY's happy RESTAƲRATION here Makes a new day In LONDON's Hemisphere: The Clouds are gone That did oppress His REIGN, And joyful Day breaks forth In this glad land again. Then to the Mighty DƲKE Of YORK and ALBANY Now London, London Shew thy Loyalty. [3] A Royal PAIR, With their Illustrious Train, To LONDON's Joy Are now RETƲRND again: Great Gracious CHARLES Does in the Front appear, And Princely YORK Advances in the Rear; The Right SƲCCESSOR Is Return'd again, Whom former FACTION Sent an EXILE o'r the Main, Then to the Mighty DƲKE Of YORK and ALBANY Now London, London Shew thy Loyalty. [4] Heav'n Bless the KING, Preserve the LAWFUL HEIR, Let TORIES Sing, And Brimighams Despair; To see Great YORK Invested in His own, 'Spight of all Fop PRETENDERS to the Throne; Then Truth and Justice Shall our Joys restore; ASSOCIATIONS shall Destroy our Peace no more; But to our Gracious KING, With YORK and ALBANY All Subjects seek To shew their LOYALTY. London: Printed by Nathaniel Thompson, 1682.
