THis being Your Majesty's Birth-Day, I thought no time more proper than this, to return you Thanks for Your Majesty's Speech, and more especially for declaring, That the Church of England is one of the greatest Supports of the Protestant Religion, and for the Defence whereof Your Majesty was ready again to venture your Life. Which was graciously said of Your Majesty, and for which I return Your Majesty Thanks; and indeed so She is, for She was, and is (and I hope ever will be) the only Bulwark against Popery; and that is the only cause that makes Roman Catholicks not to love her; and ill Men, and Men that cannot under∣stand her, are always Plotting against her to do her Mischief, in incensing her Children against her, and perverting her Members; thinking to weaken her, that they may the better over-power her: But the Most High GOD doth Preserve her, therefore Men nor Devils shall not destroy her, neither shall the Gates of Hell prevail against her. It was the Unhappiness of my late So∣veraign to be perswaded to alter her Government, which was the sole Cause of bringing Your Majesties hither to Vindicate her; and therefore I humbly beseech Your Majesties not to thrust out her Members, nor put the Woolfs to keep the Sheep; for I count those Men which have always disturbed the Peace of the Church, are not fit to come into her Government: For hath God done such great Things for any Congregation, as he hath done for this distressed and despised Church of England? For when the Presbyterians got Power, they got it by Deceit and Blood, and by Destroying the best of Kings, Your Majesties Grandfather, and then they thought the Church should die with him, and never rise again; but yet see the Miraculous Pro∣vidence of God, in bringing in my Precious Soveraign King Charles the Second, and your Fa∣ther and Uncle, without the shedding of Blood, tho' in humane Reason it seemed impossible, when the Godly sober Party had gotten it all into their own hands. I love Godliness, but hate when Men make it a Cloak, that makes me I cannot love Dissenters, till they repent of the Faults, and acknowledge the Sins of their Fathers; those that hated the name of a Bishop, and cried it was Popish (tho' Christ's Disciples Instituted them) yet they could dispence with their Lands: They did not own Kingly Authority, but they could have the Power of Kings, and destroy the Dignities of Kings and Princes; they did not make long Prayers to destroy Widows Houses only, but to destroy Three Kingdoms at once; and yet for all that, tho' they had Bishops Lands, and Lords Livings, yet God re-established his Church again, and for this Church I have been always very Zealous, and for its Government, for it's God's Government; therefore I often made Application to my late Soveraign, who is your Father and Uncle, and told him, That he should never be able to do what he designed, and that every step he trod towards Rome, must be untrod again; and thro' the Providence of God, my words was made true, by Your Highness's coming, and the whole Nation rejoyced at your coming, as a Reconciler, but not half the Nation thought You would have accepted of the Crown, as long as the King your Father was alive, but Established all according to your Declaration, by a Free Parliament, then Your Majesties would not have wanted Money, nor there would have been no War nor shed∣ding of Blood; but since it's so, I beseech Your Majesty to forget your own Countrey and Fathers House, and study the Good and Welfare of this Nation, and Pray for the King Your Father, That God would Convert and Convince him, and establish him in his Truth, that he may be qualified for his Kingdom; and when he is so qualified to resign them freely. This will make you so Great and so Glorious, that Your latter end will be more Glorious than your beginning; Then all will Admire You for Your Piety and Vertue. And since Providence hath sent Your Ma∣jesty hither to keep the Church of England from being imposed upon by Popery, I humbly beseech Your Majesty, That she should not be imposed on by any other: For methinks it is unkind that the Bishops should suffer for not Swearing, when Christ saith, Swear not at all; and those Pious Men who were Imprisoned for their Conscience, to lay down all for Your Sake who came to be their De∣fender; surely Your Majesties needs not mistrust their Fidelity, for they who make Conscience of an Oath, they will make Conscience of their Word; they will engage for their good Behaviour, and I dare believe them: Therefore I beseech Your Majesties to be kind to the Arch-bishop and all the rest of the Bishops, if Your Majesties intend God should Bless You; for as Your Majesties doth by those Pious Men, so God will do by Your Majesties. The Lord Guide Your Majesties to Act here that you may be Eternally Happy, is the Prayer of Your Majesties Subject and Souls Well-Wisher, ELINOR JAMES.
