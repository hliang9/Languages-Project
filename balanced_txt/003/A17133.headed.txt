Theyr Reli∣gion was good, for they learned it of Noah. After that time came in Albion, to whom cursed Ham was great Grādfather, who sub¦dued the Samothes, & called ye land Albion, which was so called. 595. yeres. The Religiō in that time was idolatrous. 1116. yeres∣before the byrth of Christ, came in Brue, & conquered the land, which after that time was called Britaine. 1946. yeres. Their Re∣ligion was Paganisme, woorshipping of Saturne, Iupiter, and Mars, in steed of the liuing God. The first foundation of Christian faith was laid here in Britaine, in the yeare of our Lord God 63. by Ioseph of Aramathia. This was the first prouince that generally receyued the Gospel in anno. 180. in the time of king Lucius, a Britaine. It remayned in this land aboue. 300. yeres, vntil the Sax∣ons conquered the land, and compelled the Britaines with the Gospel to flee into Wales, & placed Paganisme here againe, for 143. yeares. In the time of the Saxons came Austine the Monke from Rome, in anno 596. to preach the Gospell, whiche was corrupted with supersticious ceremonies of that Romish See. He landed at the Ile of Thanet in Kent, where he conuerted and baptised King Ethelbert, being king there, with a great number of Saxons. Since which time, the people of this land haue bin baptised, confessing the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, but vtterly degenerating from that true sinceritie of the Christiā faith, which they outwardlye professed, vntil such time as King Henry the eight (by the wil of God) abolished out of this Realme the vsurped po∣wer of that Antichrist of Rome, reduced the Scriptures to the knowledge of the vulgar toung, and redressed the state of the Church and religion. This land was called Britayne vntil such time as King Egbert a Saxon, about the yere of our Lord God 830. cōman∣ded the land to be called England, & the people Englishmen. It hath bin inuaded since Christs time, by fiue sundry nations: fyrst by the Romaines, who came in with Iulius Cesar 54 yeres before the birth of Christ: Secōdly, by the Piets, who came in anno 87. Third∣ly by ye Saxons, who came in anno 449. Fourthly by the Danes, who came in anno 791 And fyftly, by the Normas, who came in with William the Conqueror, in anno 1067. Since which time, there hath raigned in Englande 21. Kinges, and 1 Queene, to the yeare of our Lorde God 1558. In the which yeare our most gracious Queene Elizabeth beganne her prosperous raygne, which God graunt to be long amongst vs, to Gods glory, her Maiesties endlesse comfort, and the profite of this our common wealth, Amen. Take this as a remembraunce, and for no other cause: Esteeme not the gifte, but the good wyll of Dse. Imprinted at London, nigh the three raes in the Vintree, by Thomas Dawson.
