To the KING. SIR, AFter so many storms I know you would willingly attain the wished Haven, but then you must imbarque a new, and not in the old Shipwrack't de∣sign. And since it is no Flattery to wish you well, for your own sake, and many others, pray take this Pamphlet to steer your course by, and account him as good a friend to your self and the Kingdom, as any you have bin acquainted with these seven yeers, who first delivers it into your hands: For, I am confident, were you abroad among your old Councell, you should not reap so much of the truth of your Interest, as you may in these poor sheets, which are but the Gleanings of obser∣vation. To the PRESBYTERS. Sweet SIRS: Let not your Jealousie accuse this Paper of a Plot against the State: Truly I have added your Interest out of pitty to your condition, that since you cannot attain your Jure divino, you may (at least) open your eyes, and preserve your selves (if you please) in a handsome equipage, Jure humano. To the INDEPENDENTS. FRIENDS: You who are Listed more immediatly under the Prince of Peace, ought not so to prosecute your Interest, as to begin a War upon it; but only to remain on the defensive till your just Liberty be confirmed, and the Prince's due right restored, since Conscience must needs remain quieter, where the power is invested in one King, than in an Hydra of Presbyters. Above all things you must not be Anti-parliamentary, but exercise wisdome with patience, and the countenance of that Authority cannot long be wanting: A word to the wise. To the CITY. SIRS: My desire is, that you may flourish, which cannot be, unlesse you minde only your peculiar Interest of Trade. If you resolve to live and die with Presbytery, consider that you can ill Bandy against the other two Parties, since it cannot be un∣known, that they are the major part of your selves. A City divided against it self cannot stand. To the SCOTS. Friends and Confederates: Take this brief draught of your Interest, wherewith I here present you, with the same Ingenuity and Candor, that I wrote it. God shall bear me record, that I lay nothing open here, with intent to work division, it being contrary to my obligation by Covenant; but onely to satisfie the world in truth concerning you, and your selves in what concerns your own happinesse, safety, and advantage, by a wise de∣meanour, in order to the Conservaton of Peace in these Kingdoms. Honi soit qui mal y pense. And now (Gentlemen) but one word more to all: I suppose none can take just offence, since I state the Interests of all indifferently, pointing out to each the way to advance and preserve their own Party, and I shall commend to them what the Duke of Rohan saith of the States of Europe, that according as they follow their proper Interests, they thrive or faile in Successes, so the Parties now on Foot in this Kingdom, must looke to stand or fall upon the same Ground.
The Case of the Kingdom stated, &c. First, touching the Interest of the KING and his Partie. THE King (as the case lately stood with him) was a very Prisoner; and so being fallen from the height of fortune, must remit much of the height of his designe; and what hath been lost by bandy∣ing, he ought to Salve by a wary Compliance. That this he may effect in a short time is very probable, since what Machiavell sets downe as a sure Principle towards the purchase of Empire is acted ready to his hands, by the mutuall expence of Spleene in his opposites against each other: so that all he hath to doe is to sit still, to foment and blow the Fire, and give the humours time to toyle, till being tyred in extreames there ap∣peare a necessity of one Third to rest in, (which can be no other but him∣selfe;) and then his onely Interest will be, to close with that Party which gives most hope of Indulgence to his Prerogative, & greatest probability of favor to his Friends. That neither of these can be expected from the Pre∣sbyterian, is evident for many Reasons: And first touching the Preroga∣tive, their Government in the nature of it derogates not onely from the Civill in generall, but carries with it a more speciall enmity against Mo∣narchie; so that they which intend to found the one, must raze the Fun∣damentals of the other in any Kingdome whatsoever. Politique assertions of this kinde should be strengthned by Observations out of History: But the tender age of this Ʋpstart Hierarchy and the Little entertainment it hath found in the World, yeelds us nothing of moment to observe, unlesse in our own Island. For if we looke abroad, we finde it but stra∣gling up and downe in France and Germany, and in such places onely as acknowledge little or none at all of Kingly power; so that Scotland is the onely visible Kingome where this Pest is Epidemicall, and it was (first) Scotch Charity to Baptize it as Christian, into the name and priviledge of a Nationall Forme. This was done during the minority of King James, when the Lords and Clergie ruling all as they listed, at length parted stakes (though the Clergie then got, and still hold the better) that when He came to age, he found the Fable of Ixion's Juno moralized upon himself; for as he instead of a Goddesse imbraced a Cloud; so the King, when he thought to grasp his Scepter, laid hold on a Manacle, which kept his hands so fast, during his abode there, that he could never Act but when they pleased to let him, according to their own Directory of Kirk and State: And in processe of time this heat of Presbytery proved such an
Hectique in the body Politique of Scotland, that the Substance of Kingly power was utterly consumed, and nothing left (as we see at this day) but the bare bones, the very Ekleton of a Monarchie; Witnesse the unlimited power of the Convention of Estates, and Generall Assembly, but especially of this latter, which (like to the Rod of Aaron) is in such a budding, thriving condition, that it hath devoured the Rod of Moses, as his did the Magicians of Aegypt, and proves a Scourge to the Magistracie and People. This is a sufficient Instance (being also the onely one in the World) to manifest the Antipathie betwixt a Nationall Presbytery, and the civill power of Common weales and Kingdomes, wherein whosoever de∣sires further satisfaction, needs doe no more but take a strict survey of their owne Bookes of Discipline. Secondly, touching the Kings Friends [which are of two Sorts, viz. the Bishops and their Clergie, the Courtiers with the Gentry,] they must expect lesse from the Presbyter than the King himselfe may: For, as They would leave the King nothing but a name without Substance, so they will allow the Bishops neither Name nor Substance, and inslave the Gentry in their own Lordships by a new way of parchiall Tyrannie: For, if so be they conforme not, then they must expect in a short time to see the meanest of their Tenants become their Masters in judicature, and so what Solomon cals a great Vanitie, will be a Prime mystery in this new Govern∣ment. Hence, then we may conclude, that the Kings Interests lead him to close rather with the other party (called Independent) as the onely means to fee him and his friends, from the former Inconveniences, and that for these following Reasons. First, because they are the onely friends to Civil government in the World, leaving it wholly in the hands of the Magistrate; pleading ex∣emption in nothing but their Church-way: Whereas the Presbyters claim not onely a distinct power in Church-affaires [as you may read in that Branch of the Synods late confession which speakes of Church censures] but they borrow also so much from the Magistrate, as will in able them to compell mens Consciences: And so under this cunning Pretence, that the Magi∣strate is bound to use or lend his power to support their arbitrary consti∣tutions [the Proofes whereof they Fish out of the Judicials of Moses, and some places of the Gospell misapplyed in some of their Articles] lurkes the great Mystery of Iniquity, whereby They gaine a power even over the Magistrate himselfe, who in this case must use the sword (for conscience sake) wheresoever they please to Advise or Command him: And so both King and Parliament must give way, and compell others to submit, to
whatsoever they shall ordain in their Generall Assembly, as for the well∣governing of the Church. Secondly; because it is easie for th King to mingle Interests with the Independents, and oblige them w that which is denyed them by the Presbyter, viz. Liberty of conscience: In which Particular he ought also to pretend great tendernesse, it being his owne case at pre∣sent to suffer by many pressing Importunities, to take the Covenant, and passe things of high Importance wherein he is not satisfied, the refu∣sall whereof upon Scruple of Conscience is the only cause of his non-accesse to the Parliament. Thirdly, because the Independent Principles lead them to admit rather of Monarchy than any other Government, as being that under which they presume of greater Inlargements, than when Many rule; who are usually most apt to gratifie a faction in the Nationall Church with accruments of worldly pomp and power, the better to support their own in the State. Fourthly, Here is a doore of Hope opened this way for the Bishops and their Clergie, with all that are for the Liturgie and that Government, Whereas, if Presbytrie take place in a Nationall mode, then there will be Form against their Form, and Policy against their Policie, which when it shall be actually twisted with that of the State, can never be removed without length of time and extreme difficulty. Where observe by the way, how it was ever the grand mystery which Satan set on work in the hearts of those who glory in that usurped Title of Clergie; first to intro∣duce a plausible, politique, prudentiall way of Government in the Church, as the only pattern brought out of the Mount; then to gain it a sure being and repute with men, thy were wont to take in some of the power of the World to countenance it, and force a Submission thereto by all, under the old specious pretext of Decency, Conformity, and Order; and lastly to make all fast, the Custome was to mingle Interests with the State or the Prince [as the Bishops lately did with our Kings, and the Presbyters doe now with some great Ones and the City] and so their Fundamentalls be∣ing once poys'd with the others, then whosoever shall presume to move the one, must shake the other, and presently incurre the brand of sedi∣tious disturbers of States and Kingdomes; Which hath been no meane artifice of the Devill [in all times] to uphold his Kingdom in the hearts of men, against the Kingdom of Christ. In this Particular the Bi∣shops and Presbyters have been alike faulty; But if these have time to sup∣plant the Bishops [as they are in a fair way] and over-act them at their owne game, They are left for ever without remedy. But Fifthly, by an immediate Close with the Independent, and abandoning
that cursed Principle of universall Compulsion, as well in opinion as pra∣ctise, since there is a numerous sort of people in the Kingdom, that will not be satisfied, without the old external Form of Diocesan & Liturgie; it's clear then, that Independents may help to Instate Them in that Forme a∣gain, upon some visible assurance, that themselves shall be left at Liber∣ty, rather then be trodden down, by a Mornivall [or two] of Tyrants [no lesse monstrous [perhaps] for Ignorance, than pride] in every pa∣rochiall Inquisition. The last Reason is, because the Kings Ʋnion with this party may so abate the fury of the Presbiter, that (whether Peace or War ensue) those of the Court, Councell, and Gentry excepted from pardon, and the rest that have not yet Compounded, cannot continue long at this distance, without some, probable hope, That Humors altering, and by the mediation of some the rest being brought to a more moderate temper, it may be no hard matter to reconcile all within the Limits of an Act of Oblivion. And so for these Reasons I conceive, we may boldly affirme, That since the King hath no hope of remedy from his Friends here at home, or abroad, his true In∣terest at present is by some meanes or other, to close with that Partie in this Kingdome which they call Independent. The Interest of the Presbyter and his Party. PResbiterie was no sooner born at Geneva, but it was nurst up here in England in the Wishes of many, as Heir apparent of Episcopacie, For it's usuall ever in all wordly Church-reformations (as well as those of the State) to finde some men, either out of conscience or envy, disaffected to the settled Government: Out of Envy, when they misse of that Prefer∣ment which they expected by a change; out of conscience, when they see a greater glory of Light and Purity beyond it, and therefore will not live by it, but beside it, or above it; The truth whereof Experience hath told us in all the degrees of Reformation in this Kingdom, from Popery to Pre∣lacie, from the Bishop to the Presbyter: And I shall willingly allow the Presbyters (who reckon themselves for the old Puritans of England) so much charity, as to think their disaffection proceeded meerly from a con∣science well-informed, because I observe now an Impressa of divine glory and excellency in many of their Practises; But yet I would have them to know, that They are not yet come to Mount Zion, till they be able to prove the Chaire of a generall Assembly the very Throne of Christ: And ex∣cept they shew all the lineaments of their Government derived naturally from Scripture, it will fright mens Consciences and make Them disclaim it for a monster: For, the Discipline now contended for, is (as was the
Bishops) but externall, prudentiall, matter of Form and Policy, and it is look't upon as so much the more intolerable, if rigidly prest, by how much it opens a far wider gap for Tyranny; because if the Bishops made us grone under 24 Diocesses, and but one High-Commission, what will be∣come of us under almost 10000 Presbyteries, beside the Torment of Clas∣ses, Provinciall Junto's Synods, and Assemblies? Were they able to prove one of them Scripturall, it were a little honester bandying against men of dif∣ferent judgement, but since the continuation of that ridiculous Plea for a Ju Divinum with compulsive power, can gain nothing but hatred from both the other parties, and must of necessity by disobliging their friends in∣crease the number of their enemies, and in time exasperate both so far, that nothing will satisfie but an abolition of the new Form as immode∣rate, and a reestablishing the old, upon more assurance of liberty: There∣fore the onely Interest of the Presbyters is to allow the Independents their liberty of Church-way, to esteem them as Brethren, and not to make dif∣ference in circumstantials, a ground for persecution. And this I shall fur∣ther illustrate by reason. First, it's as much madnesse to persecute men, because they are not like us in opinion, as it were to quarrell with them when they resemble us not, in outward complexion. For, since we lost perfection in Adam, what ever knowledge we attain to now, is either mo∣rall, by the improving of naturall indowments; or else Divine, which is an influence from Heaven upon the Soul: For the former, we are be∣holden mediatly to the bounty of Nature and our own Industry; for the latter, immediatly to God. Therefore where we see any weaker in judge∣ment then our selves, we ought to look upon them as deplorable, rather then damnable. Vain man! What made the difference betwixt thee and thy weak Brother? did not Free-grace? For, what hast thou that thou didst not receive? and God may reveal it to him also in due time. Secondly, the design of Conformity or Ʋniformity in the Church, hath been, and is the grand Cheat whereby the Devil makes men run a madding; and though it ever pretend a plausible end of Cementing the State against Division, yet pull off its Visard, and you shall finde it to be both the Mother and Nurse of all Division (as it ever was) throughout all Europe in matters of Religion: The witchcrafts of this Jezebel [it is] that trouble our Is∣rael. For, it is against common sense and reason to expect, that ever men will be one in opinion (the Heathen said, Quot Capita, tot Sensus,) so that those which endeavour it seem to me, as if they meant to imprison Aeolus and all his Sons [the 32 winds] in a Bag (as it is said of the Lapland∣ers) since Opinion blows from every point of the Compasse: And as a con∣finement of the Wind torments Nature with an Earth-quake, so to rob
the Soul of its Freedom (which is far more agile and diffusive) must needs cause a Colick (with inflammation) in the bowels of a Kingdom. And therefore till Ʋniformity-mongers be pointed at as the only Enemies of a State, and this wicked perswasion be wrought out of the hearts of men, that they ought to make all men walk that way par force which their Priests cry up for the right; till men be lesse in the Letter that they may be one in the Spirit (which none but the Spirituall can apprehend) and untill they leave crying, Fire from Heaven against Brethren in the Faith, we shall alwayes have the Kingdom in a Flame, and (perhaps) themselves may be the first in Ashes. Thirdly, men under oppression (though sometime wise enough) become mad, and usually trample down all Relations to make way for a deliverer, that gives hope of the least remedy, and as the condition of Bing alters, so all men do vary their Interests, and Principles. Fourthly, if a rigid course should be prosecuted, and so a Breach be made betwixt those who (for the major part) are one by Solemn Covenant, the Independent having that invincible Plea of Se defendendo on his side, the whole Scandall will retort upon the Presbyter: And if it be objected that the Independent occasions the Breach, by opposing the Letter of the Covenant for an uniform Reformation, I answer, that the Covenant in its extent hath this ultimate Limitation, viz. according to the Word of God: No otherwise; The whole resolves in∣to that, as being all in all. And then, if both Parties be reduced to that Rule, let God and good men judge (for the World cannot) whose will be the Breach. Lastly, a Moderate Condescention in the Presbyter will by keeping the other from extremes stop all new designs, and when there is more of the Spirit of Love in their proceedings, they will draw lesse of Enmity. It will for ever confirm a Brotherly Union, which must prevent the forenamed Insinuations of the Royall and Episcopall Party, and prove a Bulwark within, and a Wall of Brasse about the Nation. From whence I once again infer, the sole Interest of the Pre∣sbyters is, to counter-work the King in his Interest, as their grand op∣posite, by complying with the Independent, and it ought to be their wisdom to look upon all men and Counsells in their own Party, [whether of the Purple or Sable robe] that Thunder in the behalf of a rigid Presbytery, as very Malignants, lurking among them under pre∣tence of a Reformation to draw in the lesse wise and more worldly fiery Zelots, to Act for that Party under a disguise which they pretend most to hate, and by Fulminating against our fast friends, as Heretiques and Schismatiques, &c. to shipwrack us in the Haven, and Casse all the suc∣cesses of this Parliament by Division.
The Interest of the Independent Party. AS Presbytery is the Rivall of Episcopacy, so Independency being of an higher Strain, than to admit of humane prudence in Church-Govern∣ment, her Principles stand indifferent towards either of them, as may serve most for her owne advantage. Both the other take in some of the wisedome, and much of the power of the world, and so share with the Kingdomes of the world, to make up a Church, whereby they draw the world after them, because the way is so sutable to worldly reason; thus carnall men will ever be for a carnall Church: But Independents affirme the Church ought to be a spirituall building, framed of such lively stones as are not of the world, nor of the wisedome of the World, but founded only upon the wisedome of God, re∣vealed in the word by his Spirit, which they esteeme sufficient to constitute and maintain a Church, without any assistance from the Kingdomes of the world, whose power they leave entire unto themselves. The Summ is this: both Bishops and Presbyters by their Church-policy, stand Competitors with the Magistrate, and Independents leave all to him, save only the Kingdom of Christ, which (if you will take his own word) is not of this world, and so can be no trouble to it, unless His be first troubled by it. By this description then it appears, that the Government contended for by the other two is but meer Policie: and since their Politicks render them ut∣terly irreconcileable, Independencie (which owns no Policie) becomes the ballancing power betwixt them: And as it behoves either of the two, to strive to weigh down the other, by a timely Close with It, So the only Interest of Independency is to embrace that party where an union procures most Indul∣gence and little or no scandal; which I conceive may be expected rather from the Royall Episcopall party, then the other, upon these following Grounds. First, Though principles of Faith should sway the Presbyters, to brother∣ly amity with the Independent, yet by their driving so furiously upon terms of discipline, and through their eagernes upon uniformity in the Letter, slight∣ing that glorious unity in the Spirit, (which is the very life of Christian pro∣fession) they give little hope of favour, but rather expectation of a fiery Try∣all, seeing thy begin to heat the Furnace already. Secondly, though Bishops stand at a great distance; Yet setting aside that grosse mixture of Ceremonies) their discipline were far more tolerable, not∣withstanding they had power to exercise it to the utmost with compulsion, because Tyranny cannot be so great in the hands of few, as many, So that if hereafter (in case Presbytery be setled) our former plagues be not a thousand times trebled upon us, we must acknowledge our present freedom, only to the courtesie and goodnes of our Taskmasters: But if corrupt times come on [as who can assure us they will not, since the old mystery of iniquity is now in the world under a new Forme;] What then will become of our posterity, when the yoake shall be fastned to our necks by an Act of Parliament? Thirdly, though the Episcopall are enemies to both Presbyters and Inde∣pendents, yet considering these have been extream civill in using their victo∣ries,
and may now most oblige them in their lowest condition: and it being possible that both their interests may stand together (with discretion) entire, then if Bishops quit the exorbitant compulsive power, and the King give assurance against it for liberty of Conscience, the enmity betwixt him and the Independent may be soon extinguished. Fourthly, there can be no scandall to the Independent, by such an union of interests, since the Woe-following scandall belongs to them alway, by whom the grounds of Scandall are necessitated. And therefore that the Scandall may clearely report upon Presbyter (as I proved before it must) the Inde∣pendent ought not to admit of a Breach till the Red Dragon begin to play Rex, till the Whore prepares to dye her Scarlet a new, and the pale Horse of imprisonment and exile threaten a Range about the Streets. Lastly, though ths discovery of Interest may seem to portend ruine to the Parliament, yet it is far otherwise: For Independents ought not to looke upon it so, as to neglect them in whose priviledges and safety all Liberty is involved: But with all tendernesse to have regard unto them, as the onely Rampire against all kinds of Tyranny, since all proceedings thence against them as Hereticks and Schismaticks &c. are actuated only by some parti∣cular men, whose designes being laid in the darke, Time alone must discover: But that which will crowne Independent Interest [and which is indeed true Parliamentary Interest, though Presbyterians drive another way] is, to re∣concile the King upon such honourable Termes, that as he and they are in all reason obliged to down with the Dagon of a rigid Presbytery, so the ingage∣ment may be managed with such Caution, for the safety of the Parliament, and assurance of Liberty in time to come, as may remove all Iealousies and lay a sure foundation for a lasting Peace. The Interest of the City of London. THis City bears the name of the Metropolis of England, the Royall Cham∣ber, the grand Emporium, the universall Exchange for Traffick; so that her sole Interest is a free Trade, whereby having acquired large Demesnes in all Parts, she maintaines a considerable influence upon the whole, which makes her stand on tip-toe, looking down with disdain upon all, as unable or unworthy to stand in competition with her single Selfe. This conceit hath been much heightned by those large Contributions thence, which have been the very Sinews of the War against the Royall Party; so that it's to be fea∣red the Huge Animal having found its own strength, may prove Rampant, and contemne the Bridle, unlesse a little corrected by Reason. Therefore I thinke meet to lay down these ensuing considerations. First, that what they have hitherto done, must not be look't upon as done by their own strength and Riches, but only as these received an Authority of Parliament to give life unto the Action, without which (as then, so) all designes [now, or hereafter] must prove abortive. Secondly, though the Citizns pretend Religion to be the only necessary Appendix to that Trade, by clasping both together with a rigid Presby∣tery,
and suppose this the more pleasing safe way, because they are made be∣leeve it is Divine, yet if they please to looke more narrowly upon the Scri∣ptures and the procedings of their Priests, they may learne the Scope of their State-Divinity is only to drive a Trade in the Ministry upon them and their Estates; which the City shal soone find, when the Presbyterian Charter is once confirmed by Act of Parliament. Thirdly, if onely even rekonings make long friends, then it's like this hot love to a Presbyterie may end in a Divorce before the three yeares end, espe∣cially when the Accompts shall be cast up betwixt Clergy and Laity, that worm-eaten Reverend Cheat of distinction betwixt Brethren. It's true in∣deed, some of them shall be admitted to a partnership in the Tyranny, and this is the very De-coy to allure them on, but usually the preaching Presbyter swayes All, and he is a very silly one indeed that knowes not how to do it, since they either stand or fall according to his Report of their good Comply∣ance, in the opinion of the generall Assembly [that Holy of Holies, where the Lay-Vulgars must not enter;] which neat contrivance of invisible Clock∣worke, will be sure to have a wheele going in all affaires of the Kingdome. But Fourthly, Suppose that the Lay-Elders themselves should have fair Play from the Priests, yet what comfort will that be to the rest of the Parish, who must be in little better condition then gally-slaves, when the Eldership shall have an Oare in every Boat? And this appeares by the power given them to suspend persons from, and admit to the Supper, as they shall see cause accor∣ding to an Ordinance in that behalfe: in which Ordinance, there being no less than 80. sins enumerated (and an addition of many more endeavoured) any one of which upon Conviction, may include a man guilty, if they please to pro∣nounce him: then it is cleare also, that since a man can hardly do any thing that comes not within the compass of those Sins, all men must be irrefragably sub∣ject to their pleasure in all their dealings, or else be delivered up to the Devill [forsooth] by Excommunication. Where then will freedome be in a corrupt Presbytery when the Citizens shall not dare to dispose of their own Estates, nor weare Clothes as they please, nor manage their Trades to fructifie percent▪ nor use an hundred other fine feats, without a friend or feeling in the Elder∣ship? What will become of our Lawyers oo, when it is an casie matter to make the same Ordinance, a Shoing-horne to draw on all cases, depending betwixt man and man, into their owne Consistoris. Fifthly, they may do well to consider, that if they shal drive any other In∣terest than Trade, as their owne peculiar, which may intrnch upon the union of interests before mentioned, or hinder them from uniting by under-prop∣ping the other Party, it's cleare then, that their power and greatness will be suspected, and become odious to Prince and People▪ For, their High Termes already with the Parliament, and the establishing of a Militia in their owne hands, distinct from the rest of the Kingdome, makes wise men whisper, as if they meant to found a new Religious Democracie, by resolving the Co-ordi∣nations
of power in the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common Councell into a popular Senate. Sixthly, I would have them consider that the Jealousies of States and Prin∣ces are great, and cannot brook any Rivall, nor will they judge themselves safe, as long as any one Corporation of Subjects make a shew of Competition in wealth and power. Nor can it be safe for Subjects to discover them too far in this way, lest they teach Princes to secure and inrich themselves by seizing upon Facile est Baculum in∣venire, ut caedas Ca∣nem. Theirs. What made the Abbies and Monasteries so lookt on, but only their great Wealth? And what was the main Plea to ruine them (as Princes (if possible) will have some coulour of Law to set off actions of this nature) but their holding vast possessions in their hands which could not passe from man to man so lay dead to the prejudice of the Common-Wealth? I wish the City to ponder, whether there be not the same Reason farr more pressing, against the unmea∣surable Revenues of their Halls and severall Companies, those insatiable Gulphs which swallow up so great a part of the Kingdome: And whether their high Raunting may not bring on the same Fate hereafter, on the same ground, upon the first tempting opportunity. Lastly, since their Presbytery is onely of the World, they may doe well to consider how it is like to thrive in the World, since so few even amongst them∣selves are willing to entertaine it, and the Counties abroad are some of them so wise, others so cross-grain'd to all Novelty: that they generally detest it: And therfore if it shall appeare that the Citizens are the men, which resolve to ban∣dy against both King & Independent [whose Interests tend to a speedy hono∣rable Peace & just Liberty] for the setling of that government in the Church, which neither we, nor our Children shal be able to beare, it's most certaine, that the Odium of a SECOND VVARR will reflect upon them, and the whole burden of guilt and expence rest upon their shoulders: And then they may guesse what the consequence will bee, when their Purses are exhausted and both the other Parties [carying the Kingdome before them] shall be forced into an unanimous designe of revenge, to scourge their pride, with such an alteration [if not utter destruction] as may verifie [perhaps] the Fagg∣end of the old Prophesie, that YORK SHAL BE. From all which I may summ up this Conclusion. That the true Interest of the City is to coole by degrees toward a Presby∣terie (not all at once, lest it be accounted Levity,) And in the mean time to stand neutrall so farr as not to make a distinct party, nor drive any designe at Home or at Westminster, by hoisting up supernumerary Votes, & pulling down all others with Remonstrative or Petitionary Out-cries, but to leave the Presbyterian cause to stand or fall, by Reason and sober debate in Parlia∣ment, that being the less look't upon in so turbulent a time, They may enjoy their City and Possessions without Envy and the shaken Kingdom [they kee∣ping still] may have time to settle, and recover the pristine health and splen∣dor of a glorious Monarchy.
O Cives, Cives, quae vos Dementia pit, Tanti non est Civilia bella moveri. The Interest of Scotland. THat which had been long endeavoured in vaine by severall Kings, be∣ing at length (through the prudence of Henry 7. effected, I meane the Ʋnion of both Crownes in the person of one Prince; King Iames willing (as much as might bee) to burie the remembrance of dis-union and allay the deadly feuds running in a bloud betwixt the borderers, thought meet to curtaile his title of the usuall distinct names of England and Scotland; and as both made but one Island, so he comprised both in that one ancient ap∣pellative of great Britain. This Ʋnion under a native King of Scotland, was an happy occasion for that poore Kingdom, to augment their repute and fortunes; and as in such cases it is usuall for the lesse, to drive a purchase upon the greater, by closing in as neare as jealousie will permit; so the Scots (inamoured of the clusters of our Canaan) lost no time in getting ground on this side Jordan, viz. Tweed, till many of them became possessors of fair vineyards, and were able to vie Lordships with our wealthiest English. To this height they arrived through the favour of that King, which drew many more into a desire of the warmer Sun, and an emulation of their friends happinesse here in England. But toward the latter end of King James, the passages began to be blockt up at Court by the Prelates faction: who judged it dangerous for their Hie∣rarchie, to see men of that Nation in too great a number & power, near hand, for fear lest the same humor which had depressed Episcopall pomp there, might in time have an influence here also; so that by this means not only the affections of King Iames, (whose ordinary Apophthegme was, no Bishop, no King) were a little weaned; but he being dead, the same Counsells prevailed upon the new King, his Son (one easily wrought any way to gratifie his Clergy) to a dis-obliging of the Scots: who seeing themselves now quite out of hope of thriving by the Kings favour; and knowing well upon what ground, and by whose meanes things were thus carried, concluded then there was no way to get into the Nation, but upon the ruine of our Bishops; which must necessarily follow, if they could introduce the Presbiteriall govern∣ment, which themselves had received in Scotland: and this they found was no hard matter to effect, since there were many that way affected in England, and their affections highly inflamed, by reason of the rigorous dealing and tyrannicall pride of some Clergy-men, which rendred their whole Order and government, odious to the more tender consciences, & prepared the peo∣ple (hood-winkt) to entertain any change, though to their own prejudice. This being (on the other side) immediately resented by the Bishops, they judged it best to be before-hand with the Scots; and first (to try their patience, and Pick a quarrel, on purpose to tame them by force) a new Liturgie was contrived, sent, and imposed upon them; the offer whereof bred so much
indignation in the one party, as a refusall did in the other (both glad enough of the occasion,) that a war immediately ensued; wherein though the King were ingaged on the Bishops part, yet the Scots got most of Honour and (the war being ended) much money and reputation, among their friends in En∣gland; which so indeared them, that a new rupture falling out betwixt King and Parliament, they had an easie in-let to build themselves (with high con∣fidence) a more sure interest than ever, in this Nation; which was accom∣plisht by the mutuall ingagement of the Parliaments of each Kingdom to other (as brethren) in the firm bond of a League and Covenant. By which lant-skip of discourse it appeares, as the Scots have now attai∣ned the pitch of their desires, by a fast foot in the fat soyle of England, through mutuall Covenanting, (which hath been long a contriving and ear∣nestly struggled for,) so they ought to prosecute the Covenant (the vitals of their hope) with all due respect, tendernesse, and caution (according to the rationall drift of it) toward the people of England, lest their proceedings become odious, and themselves be kick'd off again with disdain and enmity. Therefore I shall present them with a few considerations. First, let them be pleased to remember, that the people look upon them but as inferiours, and therefore must needs swell high with indignation, if they busie themselves over-much in the affaires of England, knowing in how high scorne it was taken, that they should claime an interest (as once they had the boldnesse to doe, in their Papers given into the Parliament) in dis∣posals of matters meerly relating to our welfare: And since all men know, that though they were admitted to ingage here (necessity so requiring it) as equals and competitors in the same cause, the Kingdomes being supposed equally involved in the same common danger; yet were they indeed but Mer∣cenaries, in pay of the English Parliament, who might have had Germans or Swissers at the same rate, & (perhaps) no more prejudice to the Country. Secondly, I must confesse, it behoves the Scot predicant (if possible) to see Episcopacy cashiered root and branch, and their owne form stated here, in a sure succession: that so a correspondence being cherished between Clergy of the same garb and humour, in both Countries, they may freely tosse thun∣der-bolts of excommunication, on both sides, to gratifie each other, and so be able to terrifie all Lords and Gentry, that dare be averse in either Kingdome, and promote such onely to places of trust, whose poorer spirits will vassallize their Birth and Genius to serve their ends. And I confesse, it behoves such great ones, as have already link'd themselves in design with the Clergie, to stick close to them a while, for their owne credit and security, except they can handsomly retreat with speed; yet both English and Scotch Gentry of this gang, may consider that such a course cannot stand long in England; where being Myriads of more generous soules than in Scotland, they must alwaies expect a flying out into any extrems, that yeeld the least hope of an advantage to throw their riders.
Thirdly, if the Scots plead conscience for extirping the Government by Bishops, as bound thereto by Covenant; yet seeing Bishop is every jot as wholsome a word, and as much Scripturall as Presbyter, and that our weaker Brethren in England are wedded to that Forme, as more tolerable than any other, and more sutable to the Lawes and Constitution of the Monarchie; I suppose, that the admission of a Bishop mortified, regulated, and pruned of his superfluities, will no whit clash with the sense of the Covenant: For it is plaine, that the scope of it is not against Bishop in the Abstract, but in the Con∣crete, as laden with an accumulation of Deanes, Deanes and Chapters, Pre∣bends, Chancellours, Commissaries, &c. though if these also were admitted again, as I cannot see how they may be well refused, yet the Scots (for their part) and those of their party here in England, having endeavoured their ut∣most to extirp it, they have done all that the Covenant requires, though it be not effected. But seeing most in England will not be content without it, and nothing but another Conquest can force any other upon them, me think rationall men should sit down content with a discharge of their consciences, in having seriously endeavoured the extirping it to their power (further then which the Covenant doth not binde them,) rather then aime at an impossi∣bility in reason, or venture a sad score upon conscience, in imbroyling two Kingdomes again, to an inevitable ruine of a third; which can never be justi∣fied from Scripture, in the behalf of Principles of Faith, which are the sub∣stance of Religion, much lesse upon point of Disciplin, which is but the shadow. Fourthly, if a designe be followed, to force their Government upon this Kingdome, so generally detested by reasonable men, the war cannot possi∣bly bee long-liv'd here, where the thing contended for is so ill befriended, but must of necessity, be translated toward Scotland, where it had its Ori∣ginall: And though the Scots need not feare, being valiant enough, and having one advantage above all other men, in possessing little that may in∣vite men to a conquest; yet it will be chastisement enough to be beaten home, & kept there from their usuall way of thriving, by intercourse with England. Fifthly, since that their Presbyterie is more of the World, and so like to be more troublesome to it than Episcopacy, it will bee an occasion to the English, to prye into the grounds of the Scots so earnest pressing that government upon them: and finding by the Proeme of this particular draught (which wise observing men cannot be ignorant of) that wordly respects first made them bring it in hither, the greater part of men here (which are worldly) will endeavour to preserve themselves against all such worldly incroachments under pretence of Religion: and though it be presented in a new dresse, calld Reformation; yet since it must prove no other, than an Assassination of the Monarchie, and a Reducing of the old Privado's which oppressed us at Court to overwhlm us with new ones quite throughout the Kingdom, it is like that the love of ingly Government (so surely im∣printed in this Nation, and jealousie of Liberty, will render men implacable
to all; that keep a hand in a rigid Presbyterie, & urge them to apply desperate remedies to be cured of it, as the grand canker-worm of our English interest. Sixthly, to designe that upon a people which their constitutions will not beare, ordinary Braines must conceive can have no ground in policie, unlesse there be some certainty which way to master them: and therfore the Scots and their favorites may do well to consider, how they can go through stitch with the busines against a generous people, impatient of the yoake. It is not in England as in Scotland, where men are poore, and so the more easily in∣slaved, and led about to serve the ends of the Grandees amongst them; but being rich and sensible of their freedomes, will entertain no more here from the perswasions of men, than what they can make visible by reason, as condu∣cing to the generall good; so that the ground-work of all actions must be laid, according to the peoples inclination, and not the faction of particular men, be they never so potent in wealth, or wisedome. By this rule they may judge, what their friends are able to doe for the Presbyterian cause in England. Lastly, since most men un-interrested that way are of a contrary mind, I wish them to consider, that if by striving against the streame, they lose their hold now, it can never be recovered again upon the same pretence, and (per∣haps) many ages will hardly afford the like; and therefore if the Scots shall proceed to scrue themselves in by their engineers of the Clergy (more Lord∣ly already then the former) to the oppression of Episcopall and Loquor ad sensum vul∣gi. Independent consciences, and indeavour to found them with an Antichristian power, upon the blood of both Countries, by a new war, the ancient Antipathy must needs revive, and bee reared againe (like Adrian's wall) as a perpetuall Barr betwixt the Nations. From whence I may conclude, the case thus standing; that the only in∣terest of the Scots is, to preserve themselves in the opinion of the people of England, by a moderate and faire construction of the Covenant, in behalfe of a Presbytery; which being by Covenant to be judged according to the word of God, they have the lesse reason to stand for their own way here, because they take little besides the bare name of Presbytery out of the word, and so having no pretence to found a quarrell, but only upon some parcels of the letter of the Covenant, I see no reason they have to be angry, if the English give them leave to inioy their owne in peace at home, and in the meane time take leave to settle things here, for the good of this State in Church Government, as they judge answerable to their principles, (according to the Word) where∣upon they apprehend the Covenant was first intended, framed and founded. And so the heat of controversie being laid by, a brotherly condescension on both sides, in matter of religious concernment, the peace and union, in all civill respects, may be established, and kept inviolable betwixt the Kingdoms.
