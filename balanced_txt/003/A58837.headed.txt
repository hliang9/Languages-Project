A NARRATIVE Of the Planting of the Massachusets-Colony &c THE Late Series of Divine Disp∣sations tending not only to  dissolving of the Cemer, but  the Subverting of the Basis of t Fabrick which the Wonder Worker hath here so stupendiously erected; n to the Cropping off their Branches, but to t Rooting up of the tender Plant, which the He∣venly Father, here so graciously hath Plante hath put some of the Old Relict Plante upon smiting on our thighs, and serious co∣siderations of what provoking evils we ha committed, and what special sins, God no would bring to our Remembrance, whereb we have so highly displeased our Benig
l, and Gracious Father, thus tremenduously reat us: the Aspect of Providence so ter∣y varying, from what formerly it was nt to be, puts us into an amusing amaze∣nt. And being in this perpleed Laby∣th, of Distracting thoughts of heart, there  darted into our Meditations, a Caution ich above Eight Septenaries of Years past, me from the first Seraphical Doctor of cton Church. Mr John Cotton, whose name in urches is as Ointment powred forth, and if  word of his successor may pass for Current,  was the greatest Luminary in our New-Eng∣d Orbs, and a great Prophet, and the truth is,  most intelligent of those times took them th for no less; he in his funeral Elegy upon  death gave him both these tiles, and De∣nting upon Gods Magnifying him in his sick∣ss, not only in the sight of this Israel, but of  great part of the discerning world, by set∣g up a Caelestial Flambeau in the Starry Re∣on, whither a Signal Minatory or Monitory, t may be both) the next age will better know, directly followed the Reer of the Pleiades, the Rising Progress and setting of the Seven ars, as if i had steer'd their Course,  the most strict observers took notice of: he mself on his death bed, being Informed of it, plyed, that it did portend to the state of these hurches: this Comet appeared not only in the ne of his sickness, but until his interment, and
then disappeared, thereby Performing the H∣ourable Respects of those Stately Obsequi which are only due, and not done to any,  to Persons of greatest honour, as to the Princ Notables, and Scavants of the times, had the but a shadow of the least Pretext to such thing, befaln the Ignation, Peter Cotton, t Famed Jesuite, in his life or death, it had be beyond dispute that his Preference in their R∣bricke, or Saints Calender had been befo Loyala their first Founder. This Worthy man of God's successor Reve∣end Norton thus versified of him. This Prophet's dead now must in's Doctrine speak This Comet saith, Else Must New-England break How near New-England now is to its brea∣ing, the All-knowing One only knows; b the muteness of this Prophets Doctrine, is wi all solemnity and sadness of Soul to be La∣mented. This Venerable Seer, whose method was  go through the Books of Scripture, he Entre upon, and had in his Ministerial Course i both Bostons been (lengthened our to little le then forty years) went through near the whole Bible, he was then upon Acts 7. concerning Stephens Discourse before the Council, about the History of Israel, the Church in the Wil∣derness, taking up the Tabernacle of Molock
d the Star of their God Remphan; Figures hich they made to Worship: whereupon ods Threatning immediately followed. And  will carry you away beyond Bailon. Shewing at this provocation was so great, as God then reatned them with the Babylorian Captivity, which befel their Posterity divers hundred ears after; he notified the time when, the lace where, and the persons threatned were Gods Covenant People; whence he observed o this purpose. That Gods Covenant People, or their Children, ight in their first beginnings be loft to do such bings, as might bring a future grievous Calamity pon them. He shewed as this people being Gods Israel, id thus in their March through the Wilder∣ess into the Land of Canaan, not many years fter their Departure from Egypt, their House  Bondage; So might any other Covenant eople be left to do. In the Application of this Doctrine, he was ssisted with that Presence of Spirit, and ressed it upon his Auditors with its Divine Authority, that as Goads and Nails, it Entred rom that Master of the Assembly, and was astned from the one Shepheard. Such was e Attention, and its Efficacy upon the Hear∣rs, (words from the heart entred into their earts) so as upon Repitition of the Sermon  home, they coming warmed with its hea∣venly
heat, concluded their John was in the Spirit that Lords Day. This Prophet is Dead, and our Fathers where are they? Yet the words then spoken, left such a Convincing Impress upon our hearts & Souls as is not obliterated to this day, and in this Hour of Distress, Trouble, and Consternation, is now revived, when as Heaven, Earth, and Hell seem to Conspire to Accomplish the Threatning then Denounced. The Great God being now upon searching our Jerusalem with Candles, should put each individual sensible Soul, with the Candle of the Lord, to make diligent and sincere Inquiry into the most inward and secret recesses in the Chambers of his Imagery, yea into the closest Tills, and Cachotes of a deceitful and despe∣rately wicked heart; and after all to Beg of him, whose Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, that he would Search, Try, and Know it, and that he would shew, and make us all to know every winding, and wicked way, and lead in the way Everlasting; that he who is holy in all his Ways, and righteous in all his Works, the great Revealer of Secrets, would take off the Veil, which hides the Mystery of Iniquity in our Souls, that there may be a clear discovery of the Troubler of our Israel, the Inward Viceroy, the Judge, Jury, and Witness within us, their Verdict and Sen∣tence passing against us: God who is greater than our Conscience will condem us much more.
That we and our Fathers have Sinned, is ut of doubt, but whether we or our Fathers re the meritorious and procuring causes of hat we now are groaning under, is that which remains under question, we hope in he sequel of this Script, as to vindicate the Equity of Gods Wayes towards our Fathers, nd our selves, so in our weak measure to con∣ince us of the Iniquity of our wayes against he Lord, that we shall see just cause to con∣demn our selves, as the procurers of all the deep Displeasure we now bleed under. In order whereunto, it may be requisite to Recollect what our Fathers have told us, and what we have seen; and shall present a mani∣ple of the unaccountable Sheaves of Divinely Beneficient Bounties granted unto our Fathers, and their graceful Returns unto the Divine Majesty. It's great pitty before the present Generation pass off the Stage of Action, that there should not be a compleat History laid up in our Archivis. It was an Ordinance of old, to Commemo∣rate the Political Birth and Growth of a Peo∣ple, it may not (we hope) be unbeseeming us, to give a small account of the Genesis of this superhumane and really Divine Creation, wrought by the admirable Architect, who ma∣nifest himself most Illustriously Great in the Minimes of Created Beings. This Colonies Foundation was not laid, by exhausting the Exchequers of Princes, Peers, or
ords of the Realm, nor by Lotteries, and ch like Contrivances of Advance, as other English Plantations have been. It was incomparable Minute, to what its ow attain'd unto, and the rather to be ob∣served, because of the great opposition, from hose of strength it first met with, its growth must be assigned to Heavens Influence, and lessing: It evidently proceeded from him who ais'd up the Righteous man from the East, nd called him to his Foot; the sudden mov∣ and incliner of Hearts, both infused and uided the inclinations and motions of these orthy Patriots, with their Associates, who ther attended, or followed them in great measure, parallel to that of the Father of the Faithful, who upon a Divine Call, left Kin: red, Country and Fathers House, and went e knew not whether, to Enjoy he knew not what, both proceeding from the same Inspira∣ion, and Instinct, drawn by the Magnetick Influence of the same Holy Spirit, and as it were by the impulse of a sacred Charm or pell, as by its operation appeared, as if a Roy∣ Herald, through our Nation from Barwick, o Cornwell had made Proclamation, to Sum∣mon and Muster up Volunteers, to appear in New-England, for His Sacred Majesties Service, here to attend further Orders: Such was the ay of Christ's Power, as an incredible number of Willing People, forthwith Listed themselves; ea many of those whose Faces were unknown
each other; the hearts of multitudes in this Design responded, as Face to Face in Water; thus the Body of this People was animated a with one Soul. That this Design was Super-humane, will be evidenced by the Primum Mobile, or grand Wheel thereof. Neither Spanish Gold or Sil∣ver, nor French or Dutch Trade of Peltry did Oil their Wheels; it was the Propagation o Piety and Religion to Posterity; and the se∣cret Macedonean Call, COME OVER AND HELP US, afterward Instamp'd in the Seal of this Colony, the Setting up of Christ's Kingdom among the Heathens, in this Remo End of the Earch, was the main spring of mo∣tion, and that which gave the Name to New-England, and at such a time, when as Di∣vine Herbert in his Temple Prophetically Sang▪ Religion Stands on Tiptoe in our Land, Ready to pass to the American Strand. The agency of the great God appeared, who never lets any of his works, fall for want of materials or instruments, he raised up such as were fit to lead, and feed this People in this wilderness, such were our Famous Founders we had our Mose's, and Aaron's, our Zorobabels and Joshua's, our Ezrah's, and Nehemiahs, so ma∣ny Noble spirited persons, fitted and called o God, raised up to this great service, both  the Civil and Sacred Administration, to th Cure and Care of this flock in this wilderness.
Men of narrow spirits, of mean Capacities, and fortunes, had not been capable to officiate n so great a worke, that such, and so many Gentlemen of Ancient and Worshipful Fami∣lies, of Name and Number, of Character and Quality, should Combine and Unite in so des∣erate and dangerous a Design, attended with uch insuperable Difficulties, and Hazards, in the plucking up of their Stakes, leaving so pleasant and profitable a place as their Native oil, parting with their Patrimonies, Inheritan∣ces, plentiful Estates, and settlement of Houses well Furnished; of Land well Stock'd, and with comfortable ways of Subsistence, which he first Planters Deserted; and not a few did leave all their worldly hopes, to come into this Desert, & unknown Land, and smoaky Cotta∣es, to the Society of Cursed Cannibals, (as they have proved to be) and at best wild Indians; what less then a Divine Ardour could inflame a People thus Circumstanced to a work so con∣trary to Flesh and Blood. Infinite Wisdom and Prudence contrived and directed this Mysterious Work of Provi∣dence, Divine Courage and Resolution mana∣ged it, Superhumane Sedulity and Diligence-tended it, and Angelical Swiftness and Dis¦patch finished it; Its Wheels stirr'd not, it according to the HOLY SPIRITS mo∣on in them; yea there was the Involution of a Wheel within a Wheel: Gods Ways were  Great Depth, and high above the Eagle or
mans Cockle-shell is infinitely unable to Emp∣tie this Ocean. Let us Commemorate their Exodus or Depar∣ture from our Nation. These Prudent Under¦takers sent forth their Forlorn Hope in two Ships, Laden with Passengers, and Servants: two years before they mov'd with their main Body, and Pattent Government, which were fully Furnished with a Pastor and Teacher, Worthy Higgison and Skelton, and all Materials, for Compleaing of a Church of Christ, ac∣cording to Divine Institution: Who safely Arriving according to their predeterminate De∣sign of Inlargement of Christ's Kingdom, and His Majesty of England's Dominion: Firstly, they set up their Standards, Dethroning Sa∣tan, they cast him out of Heaven; which be∣yond time memorial, he had in the Natives Consciences, and by Turf and Twig they took possession of this his large Continent, and set up the first Church in these Parts, in a place they then called Salem; at which Convention, the Testimony which the Lord of all the Earth bore unto it, is wonderfully memora∣ble, by a Saving Work upon a Gen∣tleman of Quality,Major General Gibbins. who afterwards was the Chieftain and Flower of New-England's Militia, and an Eminent In∣strument both in Church and Commonwealth; he being the younger Brother of the House of an Honourable Extract, his Ambition ex∣ceeding what he could expect at home, Ram∣bled
bither: Before one Stone was laid in th Structure, or our Van-Currier's Arrival, he wa no Debauchee, but of a Jocund Temper, and one of the Merry Mounts Society, who chos rather to Dance about a May pole, first Erected to the Honour of Strumpet Flora, than to hea a good Sermon; who hearing of this Meeting, though above Twenty Miles distant from it, and desirous to see the Mode and Novel of a Churches Gathering; with great studiousness he applyed himself to be at it; where behold∣ing their orderly procedure, and their method of standing forth, to declare the Work of G upon their Souls, being pricked at the Heart▪ he sprung forth among them, desirous to be one of the Society, who though otherwise wel acomplished, yet divinely illiterate, was ther convinc'd and judged before all the secret of his heart being made manifest, fell down and Worshipped God, to their astonishment, saying, That God was in them of a Truth; the Verity hereof, as long since it hath been affir∣med by old Planters, so by his own Manu∣script, found after his Death it's confirmed; he about that time Lamenting his Christless Estate, which evidenceth that it ought to be said of that Sion, This man was Born there. One winterafter these good spies had view∣ed this Land, who sent letters of the prosper∣ous good hand of Providence upon them, the taste of the fruits of this Countrie, was sweeter, and more welcome to their Principalls in Eng∣land,
then the Grapes of Eschol were to Israel of ld. The Leaders of this People upon serious de∣pate, drew up a Determination to settle the Corporation, and government, upon the Place: and Deputy to abide there, which being effected, and Divinely directed in such a Choice of the Governour, the Famous Pattern of Wisdom, Justice and Liberality, and of a Deputy Gover∣nour, who by his Experience at Home, and Travels Abroad, with his Natural and Acquired Abilities, was a Gentleman qualified above o∣thers, for the chief Rule and Government▪ wherein according to his just Deserts, he sha∣red more than others; the Fame whereof be∣ing come Abroad in the Nation to such whose hearts God had touched; this being upon the wing, there wanted not Number of Persons of all Occupations, skill'd in all Faculties, need∣ful for the Planting of a Collony, who filled up a Fleet of Eleven Ships, of considerable Burthen, besides their Attenders; some of them about Four Hundred Tuns, the rest no much inferiour; some carrying near Two Hundred Passengers, the rest proportionably; the Wheels of Providence were lifted up very high, and also were radiantly magnificent. These Tarting Travellers Removal, carrying so great a Resemblance of Departure into a∣nother World, they were not stupid Stoicks,
but abounded with that which Grace doth no destroy, but direct: What showers of melting Tears dropt into the Bosomes of each other whose Souls as Jonathan and David clave one to another, yet alleviated with consideration▪ though they were Absent in Body, yet Present in Spirit, and of their mutual access to the Throne of Grace, and of Meeting at the Assembly of the First-born, and Spirits of Just Men made Per∣fect. Some of their choice Friends, as the Re∣verend Mr. Cotton, and others, went along with them from Boston in Lincolnshire, to South-hamp∣ton, where they parted, and he Preacht his Farewel Sermon. That so many Eminent Persons, some of Noble Extract, should upon Sea-Bridges, pass over the largest Ocean in the Universe, by the good hand of their God upon them, having sought of him a right way for themselves, Little Ones, and Substance; yea above Three Thousand in one Year, and that above Three Hundred Ships since that time; all Laden with Jewels of Invaluable Value, far above the Gold of Ophir, that each individual one should have a Caelestial Convoy, under the Flaming Swords of Flying Cherubims, turning every way, to keep them in their way, so as they all at their Port safely Arrived: Not one Foundered in the Sea, Split upon Rocks, were suckt in by Sands, Over-set by sudden Gusts, nor Taken and Plundered by Pirates on Robbers, except one called the Angel Gabriel, whose Tutular
Guardiau Ship failed (if any Aboard put trust therein) she was Laden with Passengers for Boston, but put in at Pemiquid, where the Ship and whole Cargo perished, but not one Soul of Seamen, or Passengers miscarried; they met with an Hurricane, before or since not known in this Country, Raised by the Power of him, who holds the Wind in his Hand, and Commissioneth the Prince of the Air, by Raising Stormy Winds to fulfil his Word; it's said, the Tide rose Twenty Foot perpen dicular, a∣bove its ordinary height. The same time, a∣nother great Ship, Laden with Passengers was wonderfully preserved, when as ready to be Split in pieces upon Rocks at the Isle of Shoals; at the Prayer of the distressed Saints Aboard, God caused the Winds to Vere a Point or two about the Compass, so as she cleared them, & they were saved; in the Mount the Lord was seen; in this Ship was the Reverend Mr. Ma∣ther, three or four of his Sons, and whole Fa∣mily, with a multitude of other precious Souls, among whom was the Worthy Jonathan Mitchel, then being a Lad. The like Salvation about the same time was vouchsafed to a great Ship Laden with Passengers, Bound for New-England, the Famous Norton, and Great Shepheard, with their Wives, were Aboard of her: They were forced back from the Channel, into North-Yar∣mouth Road, where, though the Wind was off the Shoar, the Storm was so violent, as all their
Anchors and Cables would not bring her up, and being in great danger of Foundering in the Sands, they were forced to cut both Main Mast, and Fore Mast by the Board, with Sail and Rigging; this Paul and Silas, while able to stand, went from Cabbin to Cabbin to Encou∣rage and Pray with the Distressed Passengers, and Seamen, who by one Wave were washed Over-board, and the next Wave threw them Aboard again; there was great Crying out then, What shall we do to be Saved? At the Prayers of these Men of God, this Ship and every Soul Aboard was given them; the nex Day they all Landed safe, and as soon as A¦shoar, two Vipers designed not only to Leap upon the hands of them both, but to seiz their Persons; but how stangely preserved is not un¦known to some of us; though the House was beset by them, when as they were at a pious Meeting, (then called a Conventicle.) Next Year they Arrived all safe at Boston; the Ship for that Year was Disinable, Ought we not now to cry out, considering the Circumstances, Oh! The Wheel, the Wheel▪ He who sits upon the Throne, appeared with the Rainbow about his Head, and the Spirit o the Living Creatures was in the Wheels, from their Original Motion. The Waves obeyed the Voice, and the Wind ful¦filled the Pleasure of the Lord of the Universe, so a the first whole Fleet Arrived safe in a smal time, without Loss of any but of one person
These Nobly Grateful Passengers, appointed nd set apart a Day of Thanksgiving to the Almighty God, for the great Goodness and nighty Works they had seen in their Vovage, nd with Noahs Dove, having found rest for he soles of their Feet, mached forth from their Floating Arks, and Celebrated the High Pai∣es of him, who had thus graciously and won∣erfully Safe guarded them, and Landed them; They Sang the Song of Moses, and of the Lamb, whom they in this Voyage had followed, and ow paid their Vows to God to Serve him, and o Build him an Habitation, and according to he Examples of Noah and Abraham, who up∣n their safe Landing, and Arrival, each Built n Altar to Jehova, so they (being content ith Huts and smoaky Cottages) first applyed hemselves to Build the Lord an Habitation, efore they set up their own Houses, and Join∣d in Church-Fellowship, setting up the King f Sions Throne, in his Order and Worship; aving six Eminent Ministers, who came along ith them, and divers Hundreds of Choice Materials. Thus far an Abbreviate of this Colonies Foundation, and manner of its Lay∣ng. The good News from this far Country, and om these men of Desires, being caied into ngland, was as Cold Waters to a thirsty Soul; e Stile of their Letters was so full of Divine ravity, and of a Gracious Savour, so grateful  those of full Age, who by reason of Use,
had their Senses exercised, to discern both good and evil, as it put them upon study, to increase their Number, stirring up each other to get among them to New England. The Grace powred into the Hearts and Lips of these first Planters, dropt down into Pens of private Christians, like sweet smelling Myrrh, so as they began their Letters with A∣postolical benediction, and concluded them with Salutations; a Letter then from New-En∣gland, and for a considerable time after, was Venerated as a Sacred Script, or as the Writing or some Holy Prophet, 'twas carried many Miles, where divers came to hear it, because the Savour of Christ's Name was as good Oynt∣ment powred forth, therefore the Virgins Lov'd Him; and a multitude of pious Souls through the whole Nation, were in their Spirits pressed to Joyn in this Work, so as their Malignant Observers in their Words and Writings,Burtons Me∣lancholly Rendred them: Furijs Religionis Acti. Men acted by Religious Furies, and the Festuss's of those Times, declared them to be persons Di∣stracted, saying of their much Religion, as he said of Pauls much Learning, that it had made them mad. In a short time after their Arrival, a Snake crept forth, which Lay Latent in the Tender Grass, one who pretended himself a Religious Reformado, and to withdraw from the Noise of Secular Affairs, came over in the first Fleet,
he offered to Joyn in Church-Fellowship here, but was refused upon suspicion to be what in∣deed he proved to be, viz. a Roman Catholick, and of such Note among them,Christopher Gardner as he had at Jerusalem Received the Orders of the Knighthood, (there called the Holy Sepul∣chre) which Order he appeared to be of, by Letters intercepted, sent by a man of Place in England, a profest Enemy to this Colony; thus Satan's Proto-Emissary against this People, was discovered in his prime Plot, and secret Snare, who designed to smother this Embrio Colony, or to Strangle this Babe, not yet out of its Swadling Bands; for which Deliverance, high Praises were Celebrared to the Name of Sions Saviour. Not long after, a desperate Myne was sprung by this Peoples Grand Adversary, according to Advice of a Politician elsewhere, to Blow up Religion, by Religion, Encouraging the Liber∣ty this People had obtained to Leave their Nation, saying, Let them go, by their Parties and Factions, as their Brethren at Leyden and Amsterdam had done, so they would destroy each other; but the Lord most graciously Countermined it, for the Design of both the Magistrates and Ministers, with the Body of this People, was not with the Rigid Separatists to Cast off all Communion with the Church of England, but to act the part of the good old Nonconformists, who though they could
not Close with the Hierarchy, nor with the Corruptions in Discipline and Worship, yet in her Faith and Doctrine, they own'd her to be their Mother; and therefore having by Pattent-Charter from His Majesty, a Grant to Remove, they peaceably Improved the same, and left their Native Land; and at their De∣parture, they drew up, and Published a Mani∣festo to the whole Nation, of the Grounds of this their Undertaking; not knowing, whether ever they should see Land, styling those whom they parted from, in their Super∣scription.

THese Magnanimous Heroes, whose Me∣mory is Plessed, whose Names not only during New England, hath a Being, but shall be had in Everlasting Remembrance, they then declared. Though there might be some among them other∣wise minded, yet they were not of them, and desi∣red Remembrance in their Prayers, (as above) in this their dangerous Design. Not long after this, Mr. Cottons Farewel Ser∣mon (above mentioned) was Printed as London, and since Re printed at Boston, Entituled, GODS PROMISE TO HIS PLANTATION, where∣in he Exhorted them to Remember England, their Mother, and that they should not be like those In∣grateful Birds, who when they had Swum over a Stream or River, forgot the Wing that had Hatcht them. The Serpent soon got into this Eden, and according to his Maxime acted, divide, and Overcome, he sow'd the Seed of Discord, & Division among us, so as this Heterodoxy was Preached publickly, that there was no
Communion to be held with the Church o England; and that if any of our Church-mem∣bers had transiently heard a Minister, which Conformed to the Church of England, withou declaring Repentance for it, he was to be Ex¦communicated, and that no Communion wa to be held, with any Unregenerate Person that they ought not to Pray, or Crave a Bles¦sing at Meals, before Wife, or any Relation Unconverted, of which Conversion their Opi¦nion was the Test; and not only so, but tha the Oath of Allegiance to His Majesty was not to be taken, nor was it lawful to take any other kind of Oath, because no Power to be Setled by Oath, but Christs Kingly Power only, and that our Pattent ought to be sen back to our King; nor ought we to have to do therewith: Thus was Now-England Attack by Satan; and this from an Eminent Preach¦er, noted for Piety in his Life and Conversa¦tion, as his strictest Observers Characterisec him. This Child of Light walked in Dark∣ness about Forty Years, not only by Rejecting the Church of England, and its Baptism, bu his second Baptism also. Taking up the Seekers perswasion looking for new Apostles,Mr. Roger Williams. yet di not his Root turn into Rottenness the Root of the Matter abode i him, as by his Faithful Defence of the Fun¦damentals of Christian Religion, in a public Dispute; and about the Year 1677. puttin
ut a Book against the Quakers: Thus the ord infinite in Wisdom, and Goodness, dis∣osed of Satans Malice, so as he was Out shot  his own Bow, the Lord held the Magistra∣y and Ministry in Unity, according to the ntegrity of their hearts, so as this small new igged Vessel was preserved against this vio∣ent Storm, which the Prince of Darkness Raised upon her at first setting forth, with Design to have Overset and Foundred her; hus was Munificent Mercy magnified toward is People, when sew in Number, and in heir low Estate; such was the Conduct of ur Moses and Aaron, that they kissed each o∣er in the Mount of God. The Report of this admirable Divine Pre∣ence with this People in their Civiland Sacred dministrations, Reach'd our Nation even to he astonishment of those who cast no good Eye upon us, but to the Encouragement of hose otherwise minded, so as that the Well-ffected came over as Clouds, and like Doves to eir Windows; such was their Increase, that in even years time, the Massachuset Patient could ot contain them. This Vine spread forth er Branches on the other side of this Bay, to nd a Rehoboth; it's said that about this time,  Two Years there came over Seventy odd hips, who one with another Transported an undred Passengers, to the astonishment of e sober part of our Nation. At which time, d before, as the Harvest was great & white,
so the Lord thereof thrust forth not only L¦bourers, but multiplied Aholiabs, and Bezaliell Robbing our Nation, to supply this peop with such as were filled with the Spirit  Wisdom and Understanding, in all Spiritu Skill, in the Structure and Furniture of th great Work, and about setting up the Tabe¦nacle of the Congregation, and the Ark  the Testimony, according to the Pattern i the Mount.

of one person; all this while shut up, but afeguarded about four inches distance from Death: These Votaries being under the fer∣vour of their late Obligations, they Anointed Jacobs Pillar, then they had opportunity, and accordingly Bewail'd, and were ashamed of their Misdoings, begg'd pardon and assistance from the God of the Spirits of all Flesh, and direction from on High, to set up the Throne, and Place of the Soles of Christs Feet; after solemn Imploring the Discovery of the Form, and Fashion of Gods House, the Comings in, and Goings out of the Church of God, which is the House of God, the Ground and Pillar of Truth; they agreed upon the practice of that which is called the Way of the Congre∣gational Churches, which for Thirteen Years to∣gether, they Walkt in the practice of, before he Synod further confirmed the same, as is fterwards notified; which Doctrine and Pra∣ctice, was Published to the Europaean World, in the Book of the Keyes, and Vindication of the Way of the Congregational Churches in New: En∣gland, pen'd by the Reverend Teacher of Boston Church, and other worthy Scripts, by divers Worthy Ministers of this Country, in Answer to the Reproach put upon them, by some Eminent Divines, elsewhere of a Mr. Samuel nother perswasion; yet one Rutherford. of their Chieftains for Piety In his Spiri and Learning, Declared in ual Antichrist. Print, his full Assent to the
Book of the Keyes, in all its particularities, e∣cept in one puncilio about of the power of Sy¦nods, which as he apprehended, the book o Keyes did too much streighten. The Lords presence with our Fathers in thei Civil and Sacred Concerns, signally appeared with our Honourable Counsellers; our Pruden and Ancient, the Mighty Man, and the Ma of War, the Judge and the Pophet, our Pri¦ces and our Rulers; though none of them General Governour, yet as by some it hat been well observed, some of them were gen¦rally Governours, especially the first Govern¦our, who in Twenty Years was above ten time Governour, & the first Deputy Governour, but li∣tle less: such was the deep Humility of the Elevated Men, that upon Election Days, the provoked the Free-men, to make use of the Liberty against their own intentions. Never so small a spot of Land, was so hig¦ly favoured with such an Aggregate of M of such Abilities in Divine and Humane Le∣ning, as New-England then was; so as up the Emergency of the Reverend Mr. Wits first Pastor of Boston Church, Return into ∣gland, he with consent of his Church, left t care of his Flock to Mr. Winthrop, and  Dudly, they being then the much Honour Governour, and Deputy Covernour of t People, who both accepted, and perform'd t Charge: Knowing well; that the Princes Juda in King Hezekiahs Reign, were appoin to Teach the People in the Law of God:
t's certainly Recorded, That above an Hundred Years before that time, there were five Pastors in the Reformed Church at Orleans in France at one time, the major part of whom were Lords, and Barons of the Nation; so high an Este∣mate was then put upon this Sacred Function. Besides their Dexteriry in Handling of the Civil, and the Lords Two-Edged Sword; it's not to be forgotten, (though above seven times seven years since) the skill they were accom∣plish'd with, & was shown in their being Versed in the use of the Military Sword, at Fox-Hills Fort Action, where they as two Tactiques, et their Armies in Battle Array, each appear∣ng General in the Head of a Body, at Bo∣ton, where all the Cavalry and Infantry of he Country appeared; shewing such real iscipline in their Field Exercise, by rowling renches making their Approaches, and as∣yling the Fort, & by orderly Sallies, defending  e same together with a Naval Combate on oth sides, such as in none of the Gallantry,  Bravery of all our General Traynings since d appear; thus the Motions of the Wheels ere very high and terrible to our Adversa∣es, and so were the Rings and Wheels of rovidence full of Eyes, to supply all our ants, so as when this People, though never uced to Famine, yet oft to short Commons;  as when Bread failed, Fish and Herbs was ry good Fare. Then not only Dutch Ships were sent in
with Sheep, Kine, and Mares, to compleat our arms and Husbandry; but rather then Christs tle Flock, who had followed him into this Wilderness, (upon the hearing of his voice.) ould want, their good Shepherd Spirited the eat Strafford, and Lord Deputy of Ireland, and Commissioned him to be their Purveyor, out f his Irish Stalls and Stores to supply their Ta∣es; yea, such was Christs pastoral respects o them, least they should be neglected: The id Lord Strafford must Buy a Ship of Burthen, ade her, and Transport it to them at his own ost. There wanted not Observed of this Peo∣les Methods and Measures, who failed not to misrepresent the General Muster before men∣oned, and all other their Actions, who ren∣red us, that as we had cast off he Yoke of piscopacy, so we designed to cast off our Al∣giance and Loyalty to His Majesties Crown nd Dignity, which never entred into the Hearts of our Grave Sages; they knew better hen so, that under God it was their only shield nd buckler, against all violent Intruders, and specially the French, who at our Arrival here, ere not Seiz'd of Accady, then called Nova∣cotia; our Brethren of Scotland, were then ossessed of Port Royal, and above two years fter, they having Built a Fort there, but the rench purchasing it of the Scots, possessed it, nd would then own no N. Engl. and justified heir Kings Claims to all the Continent on
this side Virginia. The French Governour at Port Royal Addrest his Letters to our Covernour to Monsieur Monsieur J. W. Governour of the English at Boston in Accady; and in his Subscription Ryled himself D. C. Gover∣nour of Accady; thereby declaring unto us, That we improved his Masters Dominions. The Dutch on the other side claimed Con∣necticut, and had there set up a Fort, and Trading House in that River, so as we were surrounded with bad Neighbours. This Misprision so far prevailed, as a For∣midable Machine was Formed against this Country, not to put a demurr or cessation to their proceedure, but to subvert and overthrow this Colonies Foundation, so miraculously Founded and Multiplied; so as the Pattent was call'd in, and sent for to be delivered up; a New Commission and Regulation drawn up confirmed, and sent over; whereby this Peo∣ple ater all Difficulties, and Dangers of Trans∣planting themselves, and Settlement here, were reduced to harder measure, then if they had not left their Nation, altho' upon as great security as could humanely be given. Then all our worthy Patriots, in each polli∣ty, Zorobbabel, and Jehoshua, and all the Peo∣ple of the Land, being deeply affected, afflicted, and sorely distressed, they first Ad∣drest the Divine Throne, where this halting Jacob, upon his Wrasting with the Angel o the Covenant, found Grace with him, that his
Name was then changed into Israel, and had power from him so that prevailing with God he also prevailed with man. They Supplicated our Gracious King, and the Lords Commissioners of the Forreign Plan¦tations, prostrating themselves at His Majestie Foot-stool: Besought that they might be made th Objects of his Royal Clemency, that this poor Plan¦tation which had found so much favour from God, more then others, might not find the less from man. The Kings heart being in the Hand of the Lord, was turned about as Rivers of Waters so as this Weapon Formed against this people prospered not, and by Divine Hand was bro¦ken; as well as a great Ship new Built purposely to have brought over, the Artificers and Ma¦nagers of this Engine, whose Back was afte a strange manner broken on the Stocks; so a this Tool for about Forty Years wa laid aside and then for our Iniquities, was new Forged Furbished, and took effect; in which time, in credible was the Increase of His Majesties Sub¦jects in this his Dominion, being Sown with the Seed of Man and Beast, to the Honour o our God, King, and Nation, far exceeding the Number which the Exchequer of any Poten∣tate in Europe could have Effected: God then said, this shall not be; for which an Alta was Erected, Jehova Nissi, The Hand upon the Throne. Satan being Disposessed of so great a part o his Dominion, attempts its recovery, by stirring
up the Pequods, who were the Terror of al the Salvages, in these Parts, who to the Glory of Israels God, and the Natives Amazement▪ in a little above one years time were Destroyed; this Amaleck fell upon our Rere in our Feeble Estate, Moses Hands being held up by Aaron and Hur, Joshua obtained a great Victo∣ry: Our Fathers Cryed unto God, who heard them, and they were Saved; this Pequod A∣malecks Name (according to Gods Oath,) hath been ever since blotted out from under our Heaven. Thus was the Lord his Peoples Banners. The Dragons old indefatigable Malice ap∣peared, in a most subtile Stratagem contrived, by letting out of his Mouth a Flood to Drown the Woman and Male Child, fled into this Wil∣derness to be fed; which made this little World groan to see it self surrounded with Familesti∣cal & Antinomian Heresies & Errors; this chief∣ly befel Boston and its Vicinity, which Church Glorying in their Candlestick, being furnished with two such Burning and Shining Lights, a Pastor and Teacher, who for Love and Light Out-shined all others; and in the Gifts of Knowledge and Utterance of divers of their Brethren; the Serpents subtilty shew'd it self in a Multitudinarism of Questions, started un∣der pretence of seeking Light; Error cloath'd it self under disguise of Truth by pretext of Magnifying Grace, it was turned into Wanton∣ness, and all this under the Umbrage of their
eacher, who tho' he had Sown only good eed in Gods Field, yet the Enemy came and wed Tares; as he upon a Fast-Day in Boston Church, before the Country, vindicated him∣elf; that whilst men slept, this mischief was one, which was the Subject of that days Dis∣purse, and he discriminated between them, penly declaring, what good Seed he had own, and its dissimilitude from the Tares which the Enemy had Sown, proving by Jerom & Authentick Authors, That the Tares in Judea, were so like the Wheat, that until the Harvest, without great difficulty they could be distin∣guished; thus Hells Cataracts were set open, nd a multitude of Errors then were broached, o the hazard of the ruine of the Churches, with many Heresies destroying the Foundation; ut as of old, when Arrianism prevailed, the Earth helpt the Woman; so many took oppor∣unity to greaten their outward Estates, what∣ever befel them upon any other account; oh! That men would praise the Lord for his Good¦ness, and for the Work of this Sions Saviour in delivering from this Master-plot of Hell, who designed the ruine of these Churches and Peo∣ple; but by Divine Benediction upon the mea∣sures taken by Magistrates in the Court, and the Elders and Churches in the Synod, that was prevented which threatned the Destruction of all, but chiefly of Boston. The Churches and People of New-England had for a considerable time, Enjoyed Peace and
est, Trade at Home, and Traffick Abroad, they greatned their Estate by Building small Vesselt, and some considerable Ships, Trans∣porting of Timber for the Indies and Islands, tho' not without Alarms from the Indians, and other Afflictive Providences, the Lord took us into his Fatherly Hand, by Droughts, Blasts upon English Grain; yea, by Feavers, and Small pox, and with one great Fire; but in the interim, being without any Adversary or such evil Occurrent, they lookt at it as a Duty in∣cumbent upon them, to draw up a Plat Form of Discipline, and Church Covernment, which might be laid as a Foundation, for the Genera∣tions to come: And the rather, because the Way they practised, was questioned by some, whether it was agreeable to the Rule of Gods Word, whereupon a ill was drawn up by the General Court, for Assembling of a Synod; after debate, it was agreed unto, and according∣ly a Synod of Elders and Brethren, according to the first President of a Synod or Council Re∣corded in the Sacred Leaves of the Acts and Monuments of the Apostles who Assembled at Jerusalem; these did Convene, to whom we may assign, as hath been Observed by one of Note in the Churches of Christ: That as these had shewn more Love and Zeal to Communion with God in his Pure Worship, in their Hazardous Under∣takings into these Parts, So God did more for them, in shewing them the Scriptural Way of Church Go∣vernment, as a Divine Favour, and Boon vouchsa∣fed
unto them, then he did to any other, which Lig hath not been hid in a Bushel, but resplended not on into our Nution, but into all the Reformed Church. Concerning these men, it may without arr¦gancy be affirmed, tho' they were of low stature then our first Refomers, who are  immortal Name, yet having the advantage  standing upon their Gigantine Shoulders, the had opportuniy of seeing further, then tho Giants did; some of them made discovery  the Papal Antichrist, and of his Tyranny ov Kings, Princes, and Prelates; others thre down the Episcopal Usurpation over their Fe¦low Presbyters, and reduced them to their Pr¦mitive Parity, and the Church Discipline the Establihed, especially the Later at Geneva considering the vast Number in their Churc Bodies, consisting from Eight to Twelve Tho¦sand Members in one Congregation, so as the had from two to five Pastors in one Church,  in divers, six Ruling Elders; the publick Ma¦nagement of Discipline, upon Offenders in  vast an Auditory & Assembly would have tende to the Scandal of the Reformation, & have hi¦dred the progress of Protestantism; they pr¦dently concluded, to commit it into the priva hands of the Classies, viz. Pastors and Ruli Elders of each Church, if need required f¦ther consideration, to be Tryed by the Col¦quoy of the Neighbour Churches, viz. the Pastors and Elders there to be Represented,  for a result of it to be determined by the Sy
the Province, which if not there accomplisht,  be finally concluded by the National Synod  all the Churches; could there have been a ore prudential way of Church Government ched upon, then that which they practised; d doubtless God accepted the sincere desires  his Servants hearts, to the Conversion and dification of many thousands in their most oly Faith; but our Reformers circumstances ere vastly different, our number fewer, & those ninently qualified for further Reformation; ey being a select choice Company (& with∣it offence it may be said) of the Cream and ower of our Nation, not only for Morality, but e Piety; having been, both Ministers & People, der Sufferings for the Truc & Worship of od, both Confessors and Pofessors, and in rvour of Spirit brought into this solitary ace, where they had opportunity of the Vi∣ns of God, freed from Temptations, hich populous places might have exposed em unto, and from the Baits of Honours & rofits which other places might have presented  They after near two years seeking of God, d serious searching out his Will, with Una∣mity of heart, and mind agreed, in that hich then was, and now is called the Plat∣orm of Church Discipline; as for their Con∣ssion of Faith, they wholly agreed with that t forth by the Assembly of Divines at West∣nstee. After full Answer was given to every Obje∣ction,
which every individual person cou make, both in Churches and Towns; both  them having had the consideration of it put uto them, the Plat Form above mentioned wa accepted of, and declared by the Genera Court, and all the Churches, as being fo the substance of it, what they had hithert practised in all the Chuebes, as before is oserved, and being that which was agreeing  the Word of God, and the principles of th Congregational Way, first practised in o Churches, & for a good time since; this Plat fo hath been Printed here, and in England, an published Abroad to the World, there being n difference between us, and the other Reformed Churches, whether the Church of England, th French or Dutch Churches, but only in point o Church Government, as to points of Faith an Doctrine, we all agree in one; this we though needful to inlarge upon, humbly fearing th Lords present Controversy with us, doth it great measure Center here, viz. our deviating▪ and receeding from that which gave us th Name of New England; viz. the Plat-Form and agreed practice of our Churches, accord∣ing to the Word of God. The Ravening Wolves of Heresy, and the wild Boars of Tyranny, being chained up from Devouring the Lords poor I lock, and from Rooting up his Heritage. The unreconcileable Adversary, lets loose his Foxes with Fire brands at their Tails, teurn
up this peoples standing Corn, which no aking, he sent forth his Foxes, the little Foxes o spoil this Vine, in the time of its tender Grapes but the Keeper of this Vineyard neither slumber∣ing nor sleeping, took and destroy'd them he Watch'd, Warded, and every momen Watered it, and none did hurt it, much less threw down the Stone-Wall thereof; tho many an hard push and shuff was made at it  our Jerusalem was then a Burthensome Stone, & their Governours like a Torch of Fire in a Sheaf, many an Ebenezar, Stones of help di our Fathers then set up, for which the Lords Sacro sanct Name was Celebrated. This preceeding Relation is but as a few Clu∣sters of Ephraims Grapes, compared with the re∣dundancy of Abiezer, our Fathers Helpers Vin∣tage; so many unimaginable and unutterable acts of Favour, and preventing Mercies, were in the Revolution of twenty five, or about thirty years space vouchsafed to our Fathers, as would fill a large Volume, yet not without mixture of Fatherly Corrections, to evince Pa∣ternal Respects unto them, as their own words writ into our Nation testify; that they were by the Dew from above, and Caelestial Influen∣ces kept alive, and cherished; as to the sequel, we shall leave it to such Sprightly and Accu∣rate Wits to perform, who shall espouse it  knowing that tract of time will admit liberty of freer Discourse about Matters, then this Age will bear; the Relator being in hazard of
having his Teeth dasht out, by Truth liftin up her heeles, if he come too near her, as hat been Experienced and Recorded by our Natons Great Historiographer. This was the time of our Fathers Love of thei Espousals, and Kindness of their Youth, they wer hen Holiness unto the Lord, and the First Fruits o is Increase. God Rode upon the Heavens fo their help, they dewlt safely, tho' solitarily  our Issachar Rejoyced in their Tents, and ou Lebulon in his Going forth, but have we brought Sacrifices unto the Holy Mountain; though we have sucked of the abundance and treasures of he Sea, to the enriching of divers. This Tribe ath aboundantly multiplied to the admiration of all Beholders. So as a noted Belgian one of the East India Company, who above twenty years since have∣ng heard of the fame of thi place, purposely ame over to take a view of it, and past through ll the parts of it, and made a particular remark pon our sea trade, and the incredible number f small Vessls he then saw, besides some Ships f considerable Burthen belonging to us. Nor is to be forgotten the answer made to a Messenger of the Nations, an Attendant upon he French Court, sent hither by Lewis le∣rand, to demand the fulfilling of the Articles ade at Breda, between the two Crowns, who ere to his astonishment saw, what he could ot have believed; to him it was told, That od had founded this Sion, and that the poor
f his People did trust in him; at his departure with wonderment he said, Lo, what hath God one! and if his Masters servants did know how e poor of this Country lived, he would not ave one left. It might be then said, who so happy as new New England, by the Lord their shield and Sword of their Excellency: as our Report hath passed through Holland and France; so that Spain is no stranger to it,C. Allin appeareth by the Discourse, which the Governour of Cuba had with a Prisoner of Note of ours falling into his hands, concern∣ing our being a People eminent for great Mo∣ality and Reformation, but mind you (said he) ow your Children will prove, and what will be∣ome of them; a Speech becoming a Gentle∣man well Versed in Sacred and Civil History. Thus far of the Light and white side of the Pillar, which attended us in this our Wilderness Pilgrimage; the black and dark side remains: nd we hope thus far we have cleared our Fa∣thers, from being the procurers and peccant causes of these dismal days now befallen us; they according to Divine Institution walked with God, they did Justice and Judgment, and then it was well with them. The Lord took delight in our Fathers, and they in him; we have left the Lord, he hath forsaken us; they Walkt with him, we contra∣ry unto him; he Subdued their Pequod and Narraganset Enemies before them, gave their
Country into our hands; but now the Sce of Affais is turned, we are made a Spoil  our Haters, to our Popish and Pagan Neigbours, a Derision, we are sold and scattered  mong the Heathen; can we say, All this  befallen us, yet have we not forgotten thee, n have we done falsely in thy Covenant; this w fear is our mortal wound, viz. the forgeti of our Fathers and of our God, we have dea falsely in our own and their Covenant, wh stipulated for us; this is the quarrel which th Holy God is now avenging: Hath Chittim  Canada chang'd their Gods? Do we thus Requi the Lord? Oh Folish People and Unwise! O poor New-England, especially Boston, i the Day of it, poor to a proverb, of being th lost Town in our first Founding; those of ∣ther Towns enquired, how the Mean On lived here, the Rich had their Farms Abroa to Subsist by, but as for the poor, how coul they subsist? The Answer was, their Ministry was so sweet unto them, and the Bread of Lif so savoury to their Souls, that they forgot thei Boily Food, so welcome was Christian Society to them, that he who had but an Acre of Lan for his House Lot, parted with one half of i to a desirable Neighbour; he that had but hal an Acre did the like: Thus were we increast so as instead of a desolate place, where ou Fathers found no Town to dwell in, they Cried unto the Lord hungry and thirsty, who le them forth by a right way, that we are become
small City of Habitation. God gave some f them then a particular Faith upon Psalm 07.4. to 8. When as they were brought to mall store of provision, upon the first Market Day by the General Court appointed to be ept, they put to Sail half of it, to handsel it with. Thus was this contemptible place raised p, so that in less then sixty years, its Reputed he Mart of the North-America. That little Church which after seven years growth, its Number) in their Mud-wall Mee∣ing House with woodeu Chlices) was so small, as a Child might have told the whole Assembly; it hath been so Amplified and Dig∣ified, by the Adorable Presence of him, whose Countenance as the oun shining in his full strength, with Radiant Beams through the Chrystal Glass of the Tiumvite Ministry of the first hree Successive Johns, Walson, Ctton & Norton, each so full of the Spirit of Love, Light, and Learning, as scarcely parallll'd in many Gene∣ations; this Church is now grown up to be a Trinity Colledge of Churches, besides three other Congregations, every Lords Day distinct∣ly calling upon the Name of the Lord, being each of them of different perswasions: Oh that the Redeemed of the Lord, whom he hath Sav'd from the Hand of the Enemy, and ga∣thered from the Lands, might give thanks to the Lord, for his Goodness and Mercy Endureth for ever. Our Ancestors were men of God, made
partakers of the Divine Nature, Christ was form'd, and visibly Legible in them, they Ser∣ed God in Houses of the first Edition, without arge Chambers, or Windows, Cieled with Cedar, or painted with Vermilion; a company of plain, pious, humble and open heated Chri∣stians, call'd Puritans; when News was brought ither, that the Church at Bermudas was Ba∣ish'd thence, into a desolate Island, and full of Staits, forthwith they sent a Vessel of good Burthen to them, fully Laden with provisions of all sorts, each stiing who should be for∣wardest in so good a work; which supply came into them, when as all the Meal in their Bar∣els, and Oil in their Cruise was spent; and it was brought to them upon a Lords-Day, when s their Faithful Pasto had finished his Exhor∣ation, from Psalm 23. To Trust upon Jehova heir Shepherd, who would not suffer his Flock to ant; thus the Lord set his Seal to their Faith nd Prayers. The Gravity of their Habit, and Calendar Reformation, by Satans Pollicy, hath fince been imitated by the Quakers, that our Fathers might be Lysted among those Phana∣icks, and Enthusiasts; but they own'd no Spirit within them, but to be tryed by the Word without them, and no word without hem, but accorded with the Spirit within them; no word of promise to them without a work of Grace upon them, neither without the Holy Spirits dwelling in them, and testifying
to them. They minded the Ornament of the meek and quiet Spirit, they were not acquaint∣ed with the toyes and fancies of this age, they were Glorious within, their clothing was of wrought gold, they were brought in unto the King, in rayment of needle work, wrought with tender pricks of conscience; the least vain fa∣shion, wanten, or wicked thought toucht them to the quick, sensibly feeling others adversity, as being in the same body, instance in our Pequod and Narraganset Wars, we were not the next concerned, it was Conecticut and Plimouth; at first no union of the Collonies, why should we con∣cern our selves with them, why did they am∣ble so far a field, they might have contented themselves,Mr Oldham wthout such large accomodation. The first English Blood-shed, was of an Indian trader, and one who had been highly sined for abusing this authority, but it was English Blood, and they made Inquisition after it. So they did, when a couple of English traders were at Richmond Island, slain by the Indians 1631. and the next year an English Pirate seized a vessel, who robbed & made spoil at Pemiquod Fort, and along the Coast; the worthy Gover∣nour and Council then used means for their suppression, and accordingly it succeded: Nation and Neighbourhood was Obligation to their engaging in the quarrel, they had simpathy in each joys and sorrows, our senseless stupidity, and our Pride devours our Charity, Oh the
Excess of it both of Body and mind, of Hearts and Parts, of Vestures, and Gestures, in al Professors, it is the Noli me tangere of the Age; its fear'd, that most of our Prophets mouths are judicially shut against it, and that God now saith of us, as formerly of Ephraim, He is joined to his Idols let him alone. Dread we, least our Palsey Distempers should Relax the Nerves of our Body Pollitick, or our Convulsive Cramps should break them, and mostly that the Pectant Humours in our Bodies may not abound to the raising up Noxi∣ous and Mortal Fumes and Vapours, in our Head. If the Athenian Mercury may be credited, the excesses of our Nation in their Head Tire, hath been testified against, by Unnatural Ex∣cressences of Bruit Creatures, but, (as its said) ours by an Humane Monstrossity, as if the Holy GOD were more Jealous against us, then a∣gainst others. The Lord seeth the Land-Defiling and De∣solating sins amongst us: what Witchrafts, and what other abominations are in the midst of us, we have just cause both to lay ourselves down in the Dust, and with indignation to bear all witness justly due against them, and all our Pagan walking in Lasciviousness, Lusts of the Flesh, Lusts of the eyes, and Pride of Life, our excess of Wine, Revellings, & abominable wick∣edness, by which Gods. Name is Blasphemed among us; for which as the Lord vomited
out these Natives, to make room for us, so e now hath vomited us out, to make room or them; in this War he hath Ruined and Destroyed a whole Shire, and in a manner Depopulated a whole Province; in which De∣solation, two Churches gathred according to Gospel Order are extinguished: One of them about Fifty years standing, which was one of the first attacks upon us, having there been made the greatest Slaughter, Captivity, and Plunder; the Town remaineth, but the Church∣es Candlestick was removed: the other Church not of much lesser standing, where its said, not above Four Males left of their Society, the rest Dead, Slaughtered, or Captivated; but the Burthen of that Lamentation is, that their Faithful Pastor, Eminent for Humility, Piety, and care of his Flock; he not being willing to leave them, was Barbarously Murthered in the midst of them, his Tender and Godly. Wife Captivated, there Dyed. Oh Lord will not all this awaken us to Church Reformation, so as to set thine Altar upon its Basis, a Sentence to be engraven upon every Church door, when we are not only under Fear of the inhabitants of this Land, but under the Deep Smarting and Killing Displeasure of a Righteous, Holy, and Angry God, by these wicked Cannibals, who are Gods Sword, and have been so for many years together, and when the end will be none of our Prophets have told us: we mention not the other circumstances relating to that Pro∣vince
& Shire; it's said there have been Killed & Captivated, a 1000, besides about 140 Slain the other day: but leave it to such whose Lot it will be to draw it up, our Pequod and Narraganset Wars lasted about three years, whose Narrative is faithfully Pub∣lished by two persons of Worth, to the Honour of God, King, and Country: Ls thought no English Pen will hardly Undertake this. That the Great God is Departing from us, his wful Removes demonstrate, should be quite leave us, we need none to Judge between us, but our selves to Justifie him, and Condemn us; we are the Luxu∣riant Branches of the Noble Vine here planted, but Degenerated into that of Sodom and Gomorrah, whom after all Culturing to bring us unto our Pristine Fruitfulness, by Impoverishing us, by pruning offour Superfluous Branches, by Losses at Sea, by Defeating our great Canada Design by Gods own Immediate Hand, Starving and Freezing to Death the Flower of our Hopeful Youth; the Lord from Heaven, and the Stars in their Courses, Fighting against us; yea, Cruel Cannibals, Scalping and Fleaing of our Bodies, burning us as Sacrifices to Habamoch; but all this tends only to the killing of our Bodies; but when as the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah is Rowz'd up, and Roareth upon us, who can but fear? it exceeds brui∣tish stupidity, if we do not Tremble, more especially, when as the Devourer out of the Bottomless Pit is let Loose upon us, the Compendium of all Calamity, and the quintessence of Wrath, Anger, and Indignation is come upon us to the utmost, as if now we were to be made an Execration to God, his Holy Angels and good men, at the dreadful Claps of this tremendous Thunder, whole Flesh is not shattered in pieces? How should the ghastly sight of the Tophet and In∣visible World within us, and of the innate Immate
akes elf and sin more abominably vile, and loath ome then Hell or Devil? Who can hide from the Wrath of the Lamb? Whose Grace upon the Knee, in the Ministry of his Ho Word, so oft hath be∣sought us and ours to be Reconciled unto him, but we would not, we have with our contempt provoked him, to deliver us up into the hand of him, who hath the Power of Death. Let's consider the Instruments Implied in this Su∣parlative Plague, the Devil is come down against us, the Inhabitants of this Earth, having great Wrath, he is the Do-evil, he is the Recorded Liar, Tempter, Ac∣cuser, and Murderer of Souls and Bodies, and what not? They are Spirits no more discerned by us, and as unseen as our Souls, yet so near, piercing and con∣tiguous as the Air, Heat, or Cold, and it's only want of Divine Permission, if not Commission, that every one of us hath not had the experience of all this; they are Fallen Angels, Apostate from their Heavenly First State; should not this bring to Re∣membrance, both our Personal Fall in our First Fa∣thers, and our Relative Apostacy from our Church-State? First Love, and First Works! Our Fathers were Clothed with the Sun, the Apostolical Discipline and Doctrine were their Crown, the Moon was un∣der their Feet, but we are turned topsy turvy, Heads and Heels have changed places, a little from Heaven, was greater encouragement then a great deal from Earth, as then was the reply of a young Preacher, to one who questioned him, how he could be contented with such poor Fare and mean Maintenance, in a mall Village; we fear that Christ Jesus Indigitates t our Churches Apostacy, and at our Falling from ur First Love. And doubtless God calls us, now being Alarmed
by these Spirits, to try our particular. Estates, wha Spirit we are of? Whtr of new and Heaven-born State; and also our Worship, whether it be Spiritual such as he who is a Spirit, the Father of Spirits sek eth; he found our Fathers such of his own Making or they would not have run the risk of Transplant¦ing themselves, or brought us their Children hiher Again, are we true Worshipprs? Principled in th Truth of what we believe, and practice from the Word of Truth, can we give a bettr account of ou Church Covenant and Fellowship, then a B got Pa∣pist can of Mass, or his Auricular Confession, thei Fathers did so, and o did ours; it was the Custome of the place they lived i, and  is ous; let us min whether by these Hellish Emissaries, God doth no loudly call upon us to consider of these things. Let's ponder upon the Subjcts or Persons upo whom this Great Wrath is fallen, they are chiefly th Members of our Churches, or their Harers and D¦pendants, none of the Episcopal, Antipedobaptist or Quakers perswasion, have been complained of, be Accusers, or Accused, Afflicters, or Afflicted, th Devil setting up his Chappel so near to Christ Church, declareth his Malice, and especially again us, it hath been well noted by a Minister of Note that the Devil now contents not himself to imital Jewish or Popish Modes, our he will take up the R¦formed and Congregational Way; a single Parse wi not serve his turn, but he will have Pastor an Teacher, if he can't find a Deacon, he will not wa two Widows or Deaconesses, his old Diabolism w not do now, to Baptise and give Names to the Wit and her Imps, but he brings up a new Dernoiunif every Witch shall have her (so call'd) Spectre, attend upon her, and to be her Envoye, to Torme such as they never knew or saw; whereas it hath
old saying,: Ignoti nulla Cupido: No Love to a person unknown, and consequently as little hatred. Sauls Evil Spirit acting his Eyes to Malignity against David, ympathised with his hand to murder him, but now between sight and touch, a vast antipathy. But that which we in our short Reading may make our flsh to tremble, the joynts of ur Knees to be loosd, and our very Arfcries and Heart-strings to break in lunder, at the very sound of t; that these Cursed Fiends (who in the day of our Lords Humiliation, when as he devested his Glory, and took upon him he Form of a Servant, a Poor Carpenter (to make new, and mend old Houses) did then beseech him to give them leave to enter into  parcel of Swine, and that he would not Torment hem before their time; That this Glorious and Glo∣ified Lord, Who by Death slew him who had the  ower of Death, that is the Devil, and upon and in is Resurrection, made Triumph over all Devis, having ed them Captive, spoiling Principalities and Powers, ade shew of them openly, after God hath highly Exalted im, even to Sit at his Right hand, and given him a Name above every Name, That in the Name of Jesus, very knee in Heaven, Earth, and Hell should bow; that  open defiance of all this, now they should insult ver Storm, and basely affront the Lord of Heaven, arth, and Hell; the Scriptures tell us, That the Devils Believe and Tremble; and this we do and must elieve: but that a Damned Crew of Devils or itches at the Devils Table, with Red Bread and ine, in derision of our Lords Body and Blood, ould sport and feast themselves (as some of the onfessing Witches have said, and unsaid] with that hich is their Torment and Torture, we must cry t and say, Credat Judeus Apella, Let an Ʋncircum∣cised
Jew believe it, being no Article of any Unfac¦nated Christians Creed: Tell not this in Gath, pubnish it not in Askelon, lest Philistiahs Daughters Triumph and Rejoyce. It's Historied of our Pagan Progenitors, that Gre∣tory the Great, th last of the good, and first of bad Popes, seeing strange Lads of a comely Counte∣nance produced publickly to be Sold, he inquired of what Nation they were of, being told they were Angli, English, looking upon their fair faces, he aid they were Angeli, Angels, and pittying them hat they were Vassals of Satan, he took Order for the Conversion of our Nation to the Christian Faith; but as for us Nov Angli, New English, by our smutty deformity, and Hells blackness, we have endred our selves Diaboli Veteram, Old Devils: New-England will be called, new Witch-land, Ema∣uels Land will be Titled the Land of Abaddon; Salem Viage and Andover, will be called the Swee∣ish Mohra and Brokula; the Country whose Na∣tive and Natural Small, was, as of a Field, which the Lord hath Blessd, a Promenado a broad after Rain, would have Revived a mans Spirits, as some have experienced it; yea the whole Continent which ong after our first coming hither, was so full not only of Internals, but of External Flavour, and sweet Odour; so as when Ships were divers Leagues di∣stant, and had not made Land, so fragrant and o∣doriferous was the Land to the Marriners, that hey knew they were not far from the Shoar; such was the plenty of sweet Fearn, Lawrel, and other ragrane Simples, this Land then abounded with; specially near the Sea side; such was the scent of ur Aomatick, and Balsome bearing pines, spruces, nd Larch Trees with our Tall Cedars, exceeding all n Europe: But our sweet scent is gone, we smell
ank of Helle-bore, Henbn, and poysonful Hem∣sock, as if we were laid out to be the American Anticra. We were then honoured with Yu only have I known of all the Famities of the Earth, but what follows? therefore will I punish you. Priviledge doth not ex∣emp from punishment, and now we are under the mart of it; we hav been laid in the green bed of Or∣dinances, yea in Ch ist B some, under a Conjugal Cove∣ant, and we must expct to e punished for the breach of it; the Lord who ws jelous for our Fathers, he is jealous against us; the wilful neglect of Divine insti∣tutions, brings under the same breach of the Second Commandent, as the Superstitions leing up o Humane Inventions, we may set up Cross o Surplice as lawfully as nglect any Gospl O dinance: the grand Promise of Christ being a way wi his Churches, unto the End of Ages, is conditional, and cannot be ∣parated, rom that which preceedeth, nor be claimed without that which is annexed to it, viz our Obedi∣ence to that Gospel Command, which Christ reserved to take leave of his Apostles, and all Believers; which last wor'ds are or ught to baffectng and soaking to parting Relations: Teaching them to observe al things whatsoever I have Commanded you to do, and LO I AM WITH YOƲ; Here is adjoyned Christs Note of Lo, or Behold, calling for our greatest attention and consi∣deration, as well as being the remark of the highest truth and affirmation; and both confirmed by the Amen and last words of him Who is the Faithful and true Witness, whose Name is Amen. Can it be rationally supposed? that had we not re∣ceeded from having Pastors, Teachers, and Ruling Elders, and Churches doing their duty as formerly, with Family-Government kept up, that the Roaring Lion could have gained so much groud upon us
(he being resisted would have fled) and not mu plied so many Impieti s in our Towns; or such a Number of real or reputed Wiees amongst us, as it's said in or about two Towns, above two hundred Accuted, one hundied Imprisoned, thirty Condemn∣ed, and twenty Executed; yea, some Accused among our Rulers in Commonwealth and Churches, as  they were ecome places for Zim, Jm, and Ohim with the Satyrs to Dance in, On whither shall we go to cover our shame? Shall not the stings of those Stygian Scorpions awaken us out of our Laethal Le∣thergy? Are both Wise and Foolish Virgins asleep  what need is there of Prayer? that our Eyes may be opened, and our hearts awakened, and to crie out, Awake, awake Deborah, awake, awake, is it not high time, as for every particular person, so for our Chur∣ches to search, and try our ways, and re urn to our First Husband. and the good Old Way we have walked in. The place where Satan mad his first assault, and great Batery is to be minded: thre he made his grand Attack where he first was Dethroned, and that is Salem; his present Rage is against it: its Original Name was called, Naumkek, the Bosome of Consola∣tion being its signification, as the Learned have ob∣served. It's now thretned to be made a place and osome of Desolation, nd Turting Christ out of his Throne; that where Christs Banner had been display∣ed, there the Devil with found of Trumpet, sets up his Ensigns, where Spiritual Songs, and Sacred Anthoms of, Glory to God in the Highest, and Peace on Earth, and good will towards men; with Amsworth, Elevated Tunes were wont to be warbled forth; that there the horrid Scriekings and Screamings of Oblessed, Possssed, and Bewitched Persons should be sounded with such hide∣ous yellings, to the amazement of the Hearers, as if Hell and his Furies had been let loose.
That the Noise of Maues and Hammers, beating own the Carved Works in the Synagogues of the and, should be heard where men had been Famous, whose Axes had been Lifted up for hewing and squa∣ing Souls for Christs Spiritual Building That where the Dvil like Lightning had fallen own from Heaven, before the Thundering Ministry f Christs Boanerges, there the Back Man or Devil hould be pointed at, as vinbly sitting or standing on he Beams or Seats. Though Balac and Balam Changed Stations, and Sacrifices, they could not Curse, but must bless this People; how goodly were the Tents and Tabernacles of ur Israel, when our Tribes according to Scriptural Order, were pitch'd about our Tabernacle, and the Ark of God in the midst of us, when our Churches nd Consociations were according to Divine Directo∣y, and Primitive Practice; We looked forth then as he Morning, fair as the Sun, clear as the Moon, and errible as an Army with Banners, no Inchantment or Divination against us, until prevailing Iniquity and Transgression against Christs Institutions were found  mong us; our Strength then was as the strength of he Unicorn, the shout of our King was among us, tting upon his Throne of Majesty, with the Rainbow bout his head, surrounded with the four living Crea∣ures, and Twenty Four Edere, prostrating, and throwing heir Crowns before his Throne; a Lively Emblem and Character of the first Apostolical Churches Organiz∣d and Compleated according to Christs Appoint∣ent, with the Couragious Lion like Ruling Elder, e Laborious Ox-like Pastor, the humanely Compassi∣nate Deacon, and the Eagle Eyed Teacher. Our his exceeding Immoralities, are dipp'd in the Crim∣n Tincture of Rebellion; no marvel if our punish∣ent be so great, yet abundantly less then our Iniquities
The dread of Divine Anger and Wrat with the Guilt of Gnscience, which the Scri¦ture of Truth declares and dictates unto  as unknown in its power, and that accordi to Gods Fear, such is his wrath; this the w¦dom of our Antients (when Paynimes) R¦presented by Alecto, and her two Sister-Furi sent out of Tartaras, with their Platted Ch¦velures, and Contorted Locks of Hissing Serpen and Stinging Adders, Hanging below thei Necks, whose Tails, Tongues, and Teeth we full of Deadly Poyson, enough to Fright a Sen∣sible Man out of his Wits, and our Gallan out of their Head Gear: It's said to be ce∣tainly true, that no Rattle Snake ever was see beyond Merrimak River, the Boundary of ou First Patent; nor that there hath been  Convicted Witch on the other side of Pisc∣taquay River; but if some Creatures may b Credited, how do we on this Side abound  how do the Ignatian Loyalists with their Per∣verted Proselytes, Triumph over our oor Cap∣tives, saying, We are the true Christians, you the false, we no Lye, Swear, but Pray and Prase God; as indeed, at the Late Surprise of York before they fell to Sharing f their Plunder they met and Sung, Te Deum Laudamus, their Praises to God; and at their Vespers, o Nocturnal Riings to Smoak it, they Sing even Songs and Mattens, in the Morning in their own Language, with Harmonious Melody, a our Captives Testify; how doth this Reflec
upon the Thousands of Non-Praying, and Non-Praising Familys of the English; they tell us, Their Priests are good Men, our Ministers are Devils, and hung for Witches; What will some of our own Nation reproach us with? what is become of the New-Heaven, and the New-Earth, of your Non parralleld Reformation you boast∣ed of? whatever Piety your Fathers preten∣ded in the Pia Mater of their Brains, to be sure it is Ardled into impious matter of De∣vilism, in their Childrens crack'd Crowns; and therefore you are sent into a Region, where there is Hellebore enough, for all the Mazed Fanaticks in Europe; thus is the Name of GOD, His Tabernacle, and those which dwell in Heaven, Blasphemed for our sakes; we not giving him the Glory and Honour due unto his Name; others do say, and they do very ill in their so speaking, what is become of your resolved Revolution, which God is now Plagueing you for? and the Complicati∣on of Lies, made to encourage and further it; which of your Designs have prospered since? Had you waited Gods time, you should have had it with a Blessing, but by your Lyes ob∣taining it, you ve deeply paid for it. Finally, that which may call for our Higgaion Selah, and deep Humiliation, is the consideration of the time, when as Hells Hurricano seas'd us, when after weary waiting, in our languishing, and bleeding condition above a Time, Times, and half a Time; at length we were brought to Gods
Foot, our wounds not being healed, tho ou Petitions were not granted, yet our prayers were heard, as appeareth by their Majesties grant of a Province Charter, there declared, and here with great acclamation Proclaimed; this ve look'd at as a happy Omen of Haloyon-dayes now come to this distressed, & wounded people, in this Junctor of time, or about the laying the Foundation of this structure, that the great Palmony, the wonderful numberer of times, who weighs the least minute of humane acci∣dents, in the exact ballance of an eternal de∣cree, even to the pacing of Ahabs Horses in his Chariot, that they must not go faster o flower, then to reach the very spot, where the Dogs had lick'd up Naboths Blood, there to lick up Ahabs; that then this Euroclydon should be raised, to the Toral Ruine of the whol Fabrick; that when according to Gods graciou Promise unto Israel of old, the Royal Con∣cession unto us was, That our Nobles should be o our selves, and that our Governour should procee from the midst of us, and that God would mak him to draw nigh unto him, and that he di approach unto him: That then Hells rage di seize us, to the breaking us in peices, if S∣tans Stratagem had taken effect, according t the wasting Progress made, that when as w hoped, God should have been ours, and o Childrens God as aforetime, and our Congr∣gations established for ever; that then  should render ourselves, or be rendred by othe
s the Sons of the Sorceress, and Children of he Adulteress: what high songs of praise do we owe unto Sions God, for the discovering of Apollions Wiles, Depths and Deceits; and or Spiriting one of the Tribe of Zebulon, rais'd, p from among us, by finding out the Treasures id in the Sands, which hath highly tended o the raising of him to Honour, and the enrichment of himself, and Nation; who be∣ng Divinely destinated, & humanely Commissi∣nated to be the Pilot and Seers man of this oor Bemisted, and Befogg'd Vessel, in the Mare Mortuum, and Mortiferous Sea of Witch∣raft, and Fascination; by Heavens Conduct ccording to the integrity of his heart, not trust∣ng the Helm in any other Hand, e being by od and their Majesties bestrued therewith, e so happily shaped, and steadily steeed her ourse, as she escaped Shipwak, ither up∣n the Stygian Scilla, or the Achrontal Charib∣is, and now is safely Moaed in the Paci∣que Sea, and under the Cape of Bone Esperance; e being also by the same Hand appointed, to e this Peoples Chieftain; by the Prudence of s hands, and strengthned by the Ams of  mighty God of Jacob, managed the sharp wo Edged Sword, to him committed, in∣mparably excelling that of the Great Alex∣der, to the Cutting in sunder of the Circean ot of Inchantment, abundantly more diffi∣lt to be dissolved, then the Famous Gordian  of Old: he being also led by divine in∣spiration,
of Our Blessed Gods-Spell and th most sure Word of Prophesy, infinitely su¦passing the Famous Thed and Clue of Ariadn hath extricated us out of the Winding an Crooked Labyinth of Hells Meander. Let all be improved to the high Honour of him, who had he not been on our Side, Now may New England say, Had he not been on our side, when not only men, but Devils rose up against us, we had been swallowed up quick, the proud Waves had gone over our Souls; Blessed be the Name of the Lord who gave us not up to be  prey unto their Teeth, let our hel be in the Name of the Lord, who hath made Heaven, Earth, and Hell Oh that now this token for good, may be improved to the quickening of us, to breaking off the Covenant made with Death, that it may be disanulled, and our Agreement with Hll, that it may not stand; and to make sure our Interest in the firm, sure, precious and tried Foundation, and Corner Stone, which with a Behold of Attention and Admiration, God hath Laid in Sion: Let this preventing Mercy En∣courage poor Starv'd Prodigals, to return to their Fathers House, acknowledging our selves unworthy to be his Sons; no, not his Maenial Servants. Own we our selves to be Luke∣warm Laodiceans, wamblng upon the Stomach or our Blessed Lord, and no place fitter to ease himself of us, then by spuing us into Hell, as was said of Caparnaum; we are as ignorant, as
ogant, we are Rich, want for nothing, but ow not our Poverty, Blindness, or Naked∣ess; we trust and boast our selves in lying ords, of the Temple of the Lord, and that we are hrist's Non-such Garden, for him to Walk nd Recreate himself in: But alas! we are either hot nor cold, a parcel of Mungel nterpendants; we are not of the Episcopal Form, we allow no Superiority in our Chur∣hes, nor Officers; where there is but one Of∣icer, there cannot be Preference nor Dispari∣y; and how many of our Churches have nore? We are not Presbyterians, for their eclared Discipline, and their practice is accor∣ingly; they have one Pastor, and two Ruling Elders, in their least Congregations; and as heir Flock increaseth, so they multiply their Officers; but we on the contrary; when a Churches Foundation▪ hath been laid, they had not the Number of Forty Members in their Body; they solemnly then engaged, with hands ifted up to Heaven, not to be without two Teaching, and two Ruling Elders, and for a while they publickly practised, chusing two Ruling Elders, Ordained a Pastor and Ruling Elder, and sent the other to bring over a Teacher, which was done; but when they are now multiplied vastly above the Number, more then at first, they content themselves with one Teaching, and never a Ruling Offi∣cer; when as there are, as it's said, above two thousand Souls under Church Watch, & none
Officially to Rule and Watch over them;  not this Taking Gods Name in vain; and as  the Congregational Way, we Nominally pr¦fess it; but if we Read the Plat-orm of o Church Discipline, or the way of the Congr¦gational Churches of New-England, we m see how much we are varyed from it, a gone back from the way, our Fathers and o¦selves have been instructed in, and have recei¦ed upon the Divine Authority of the Ho Word, and formerly walked accordingly. Let's not halt between two Opinions, if o Fathers Ways were Scriptural, let us practical Justify them, if they be not, let us be Humbl and Reform; we pray that the Lord wou lead and keep us in his Truth, and restore  to Walk in Christ, as we have received him  though our Rust is so inveterately Cankere as no scowring will fetch it out; let's Beg th the Refiners Fire, which the Lord is purgi the Sons of Levi with, may effectually melt  down, that we may be fitted as Vessels of H¦nour, Sanctified and Prepared unto every go Work, and made fit for our Masters Us Let this stimulate us to hearken unto what t Spirit saith unto the Churches, not advanci mens Polliticks, before Gods Institutes, nor H¦mane Prudentials, before Christ's Credentia take we heed of disgust against Scripture Pu¦ty, and plainness; and see that the true Fa and Discipline received from our Godly a Holy Fathers, may be handed down to us, a
to our Children, bringing forth practical Ho¦liness, whereby as they Justified their Profess¦on, so we may in our Lives and Conversati∣ons make evident, the Holiness a Faithful¦ness, of our and their Heavenly Father; tha Religion and the true Ways of God in Hi Worship and Discipline, may not evaporate in∣to Form, without the Power of Godliness, no be Buried in our Predecessors Graves, but that it may in the midst of years Revive, to that which was New Englands Glory: In our first times no complaint of Churches being it compleat of Officers, nor for want of Maitenance for them, nor for want of Materials to choose Officers fit to Rule: some have observed this Failure hath been upon private Brethrens Ob∣structions, a discouragement of Discourse a∣mong themselves, unless it were such, as they had from the Press or Pulpit; Doth it not re∣flect upon the Churches King and Law giver? who both received and gave gifts to men, that the Lord God might dwell among them, yea, among the Rebellious: Shall our Churches lie under the Curse of Barren Wombs and Dry Breasts? Is Bethel Barren, and Athens Fruitful? Shall Cambridge the School of our Young Pro∣phets be pregnant, and an Alma Mater, a Boun∣tiful Mother with her Breasts, exuberating with Radiant Beams, and Sacred Streams, to the making glad the City of our God; in sending forth such as are Accomplished with exquisite and requi∣site Talents, to fit them to the Ministerial Work
of Christ's Holy Temple. And shall o Churches, which should be Sion Colledges? a the Mothers of old and young Disciples no be sterile? Neither capable to bring fort Nurse, or Educate any, which may be fit f Rule in them; shall they be capable of no ¦ther Name, but of the Layty or this Peopl which was imposed upon them, by such a Arrogated to themselves the Title of the Cle∣gy, or of being Gods Lot. Our King is blameless, but how much o Churches are blame-worthy, the Lord give u to consider; for Brethren of low degree, t say they know not the way of the Lord, the are of mean Estates, and low Capacities, thei Counsel will not meet with acceptance, a some others might do; go to the Brethren o high degree, they know the way of the Judg¦ments of the Lord, but they cast off the Yok of the Lord; their occasions will not bear o admit of so mean an Employ as to be a Ruling Elder. It's Recorded to the high Honour of the French Reformed Churches, that not many years since, at a National Synod held at Charen∣ton, very nigh unto Paris, the Metropolis of that Nation; in the sight of all the French No∣bility, and Gallantry, there appeared twelve or sixteen Barons, Lords, and Esquires, who E∣steemed not themselves debased, to appear as Members of that Synodical Society, and in∣deed were all of them Ruling Elders of their
spective Congregations, and truly the Glory Christ in his Churches: This is asserted in e Synodicon Galliae Reformatae. May we not fear that we render our selves ghly Criminal against the Prerogative of this ing of Kings, and Lord of Lords; who be∣des what is recorded in the Scripture of ruth, that when he took leave of his Apostles t his Ascension, What he then gave in Charge o them; he afterward doubled the same y the great and last Apostle of the Gentile Churches; instructing Timothy in Christ's Name, how he should behave himself in the Church, and House of God; he doth upon he highest adjuration which can be mention∣ed, Enjoyn him, as he will answer it before God, before Jesus Christ, and the Elect Angels, that he should observe those things; namely, the Canons he had before appointed about Church Order and Officers; that he should mind those things, without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiallity; there must be no partial dealing, no preferment of one Commandment of Christ before another, Deacons must not be kept in place, with rejection of the Elders that Ruled well, nor others debarr'd of their double Ho∣nour, especially those who laboured in the Word and Doctrine; and the Holy All-wise God knowing that the Churches would Aposta∣tize, and that Antichrist whose Mystery of I∣niquity then wrought, would in special man∣ner run encounter to Scripture Purity, and
pollute the Sanctuary Streams of Church O¦dinances and Officers, especially Ruling Elde because of their pragmaticalness with the Te∣ching Elders, about Church Rule, he jumble and made one Officer of Teaching and Rulin Elders, prudentially to avid Seism, and calle hem both Presbyters or Priests; mean whil he courted and carressed the Deacons who he distinguished; some he called Sub-Deacon to attend the Vestry, to help on the Surplic and hly Garments of the Priests or Presbyters others he advanced to hear Auricular Confess¦ons, and say Mass; but prudently considerin that the Care and Trust of the Church Stoc and Treasury was committed unto them; e∣pecially when i was augmented with that ca¦led Constantines Gift, concerning which, Histo¦ry tells us of a voice heard in the Heavens Hodie venerum effunditur, &c. This day poyson i powred into the Churches: That Man of Sin fore seeing how useful Deacons might be to hi Clergy, he advanced the Gravest of them to be Arch Deacons, and to be of the number o Cardinals, so called, because they are the Car¦dines Hooks or Hindges that the Scarlet Whore Chair or Seat hangs on: This cursed Conclave are the only Elected and Electors of the Pope; their work on High Festivals is to Vest their Pontifex Maximus in his Pontificalibus of Purple and Scarlet, decked with Jewels and Gold, vastly exceeding all Imperial State; and the Splendor of Jaddu the
to Alenander, to confirm him in his Con∣est of the World. Whilst at the High Altar e is Offering up the Blasphemous Sacrifice, ese Arch-Deacons attend upon him, as other eacons at the Lords Supper. Let the Candid eader pass by this digression, designed to shew what a fine Thred this Mystery of Iniquity at irst spun; but now the Son of Perdition Sits s God in the Temple of God, whom Christ will destroy with the Brightness of his Coming. &c. Christ renews and doubleth the same Charge n the same Epistle, as it were Adjuring and Conjuring Timothy, and in him all the Church∣s, In the sight of God, as they look to answer it, at that Great Day, and before Jesus Christ, who made a good Confession before Pontius Pilate, that they keep his Commandment without spot, and un∣rebukable, until the Appearing of Jesus Christ: How should all these Obtestations and Injunct∣ions make all New-England Church-Members and Officers dreadfully to quake and tremble, under the consideration of what Guilt we lay under, by breach of this Command. Moreover the King of Saints, and Lord of Heaven and Earth, having Magnified and Ex∣alted this People above any in the lower world; with Charter Priviledge to im-body themselves into Spiritual Corporations, founded upon Di∣vine Institutions, and directed by Scriptural Regulations; by which Charter of Right, they are Impowred to Assemble and Incorporate themselves, to Chuse and Appoint their own
Officers, acting the whole in his Sacred Ma¦jesties Name, and Solely by his Authority, tha agreeing together, he hath pass'd under th great Seal of Heaven, and given his Royal Parol Oath, and Amen, to bind or loose in heaven whatsoever they shall bind or loose on earth the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are give to this Church, Confessing and Professing Chris to be the Son of the living God: the gates o hell shall not prevail against it: yea, he whos Name is I AM, is in the Midst of two or three assembled in his Name & Authority; but if they by their factions, or fractions, cannot agree, o thro their sullen wilfulness, do Nonuser, Desuser▪ Refuser any of these Sacred Statutes, which they by Scripture Charter are oblidg'd to act by, they forfeit their Franchise, & may expect a Divin Quo-warrant, to be sued out by their King a¦gainst them, WHO REQUIRED THIS AT YOUR HANDS? THIS IS NOT THE FEAST, FAST OR DUTY THE LORD REQUIRES. By not observing all things he hah Commanded, they forfeit the challenge of his promised Presence with them, if they refuse any Officer, which he hath instated in the Churches, they expose themselves to the Forfeiture of the said Charter. And he who knoweth not, what a De∣luge of Superstitions was by this door of neg∣lect, let into the first Churches, he is not so vers'd in divine and humane Church History▪ as the time of the fulfilling Prophesy we are
cast into, calls for: our crying out, The Tem∣ple of the Lord, will not free us from being Dischurched, more then Jerusalem was; she was seat to Shilo. N. England needs not to Travel in∣to Asia to learn it; every poor French Refugee, who hath set his Foot in N. England, Preach∣eth it unto us, whose Churches have yielded more Faithful Martyrs, then all the other Re∣formed Churches in Europe; their care of Supplying the Poor Churches, out of the Large Treasury, and by the Liberality of the Richer, was Exemplary; and the Providing Maintenance to the Widows, and Orphans of their Deceased Pastors, was Presidential; it was the special Work of their National Sy∣nods, and doth condemn us; Christ that knows their Charity, Service, Faith, and Pa∣tience after their Re reformation, will make this Thyatiras last works to be more than her first. Oh that we might apply our Hearts to these things, that they may sink into our Souls! Kings out of their Natural Clemency, may a∣bate from the Severity of Law, but if con∣tempt be added, it aggravates the Offence; Our case is such as only Soveraign Grace can Cure; God hath oft wrought for his Names Sake, Let us Plead it with him, Lord we are calld by thy Name, Leave us not, Let us not be abhorr'd for thy Names Sake; Let not the Throne of Thy Glory, be further Disgraced, before Popish and Pagan Adversaries? It's said that none but Parliaments Laxness
o maintain their just and legal Proprietie  undo the Body Polittck of a Nation; so no can undo our Spiritual Corporations, but their Members; giving up their due just Church Power and Priviledge, into the bands of some Diotrephes, as befel the Primitive Churches. As we began with a caution from our great Cotton, so we shall draw to a conclusion with the Animadversion of the great Congregatio∣nal Champion, Dr. Owen, who in the Vindi∣cation of these Churches from Scism, chag'd upon them by Dr: Stilling sfleet; the said Reve∣rend Man, who there, and in his other Elabo∣rate Works upon that Subject, doth but Para∣phrase and Comment upon the Book of Mr. Cottens Keys, as he himself hath published to the World; in answer to Mr. Cawdry, That upon search of the Scriptures, and weight of Argument thence deduced, finding the Work of the Keyes exactly answering the Wards of the Lock of Christs Kingdom; he was proselited from the Classical, unto the Congregational Way of Churches. Let it with all submissive∣ness be considered, whether its Rumination may not be our concern, who Writing of the State of these Churches saith: That when a People through an apprehension of their own ignorance, weakness, and unmeetness (well if it be not La∣ziness and Idleness) to discern and judge matters of Religion for themselves; and their own duty be kept and debar'd from it, or when through their own sloth, negligence and vitiousness, shall be really
uncapable to manage their own interest in Church Affairs, as fit only to be governed, if not as Bruit Creatures, yet as mute persons; these things shall be mplyed by the ambition of the Clergy, ingrossing ll things in the Church, to themselves, as they did n former Ages: That if the old Popedom do not Return, a new one wil be Erected as bad as the o∣ther: God forbid this prognostick should be the Fate of our Churches; yet when we read the Apostle Pauls advice to Colosse, Say to Archippus, Take heed to thy Ministry, which thou hast Received of the Lord; when we consider the neglect of it, we know not what to say. The said Learned Man, in a Book Publish∣ed since his Death, concerning the Rule and Order of Congregational Churches, which he asserts to be the only Apostolical Churches, both according to the Rules of Scripture, and according to the Example of Primitive Hu∣mane Antiquitie, to whom next unto the Sacred Scriptures, we owe greatest Veneration and Credence, which he in the said Book ci∣teth, in that Discourse, treating of the Ruling Elders Office and Duty, he saith, I admire that any man should have so much confidence in his own Abilities, so as to suppose himself Meet, and Able, for the Discharge of both sorts of Eders in the least Church of Christ; In the same Treatise, he further affirms, Its evident, that neither the Purity, Order, nor the Beauty, or Glory of the Churches of Christ, nor his Ma∣jesty, or Authority in the Government of them,
can be long preserved without the multiplication Elders in them, according to the proportion to  Number of their respective Members; for w whereof, the Churches of old, and late, have De∣nerated into Anarcby, or Confusion, or else gi themsel vss up, unto the dominion of some prelati Teachers to rule at pleasure, which was the poi and bane of the other Primitive Churches; and t will do the same for the future, in the neglect this Order. God avert these sad Omens, that they shou befal our Churches; and yet when w read how the Mystery of Iniquity wrought app∣rently in some who loved the preheminence even in the Apostles time, we are at a loss, a humbly leave it with him, whose Face is n to be seen, but his back parts only, while he passing before us in his Glory, and taking way his hand. Hath not New-England experienced this grea truth, What is become of the Majesty, Autho∣rity, and Glory of Christs Appearing in ou Churches, unto which Christs Defence is pro∣mised when we were compleated according t Rule, as at the first: Let's take Christs Coun∣sel, to Remember from whence we are Fallen, & Repent; Remember our Rulers which hav declared unto us the Word of God, whos Fatth follow, considering what hath bee the end of their Conversation; Jesus Chris the same yesterday, to day and for ever. Let's no be carried about with divers Doctrines, and
to mind what Mem  orton hath left us to chew upon. In his Treatise call'd, The Heart of New-En∣and, rent at the Blasphemies of the Times, whose ords are: It concerneth New-England always  remember, that originally they are a PLANTA∣ION Religious, not a PLANTATION of rade; the Profession of the Purity of Doctrine, Worship and Discipline, is written upon their Fore∣ead; a spot of this vast Jeshimon converted nto Corn-fields, Orchards, Streets Inhabited, nd a place of Merchandise cannot denomi∣ate New-England, all these notwithstanding if e fall away from her Profession, call her habod, The Glory is Departed; in such a case, hat was said of Samnium, sometimes a Fa-, ous City in Italy, viz. That they could not nd SAMNIUM in SAMNIUM, will be ve∣fied in these Churches; vix. That NEW-ENGLAND is not to be found in NEW-EN∣GLAND, nor BOSTON in BOSTON. God orbid, that after New England hath now shi∣ed Twenty Years and more, like a Light up∣on an Hill, it should at last go out in the snuff of Morelianism; thus far the words of Bostons great and second Seraphical Teacher, who For∣y Years since, declared these Fears about us; as will further appear in the last page of this Scribled Narrative, in his Funeral Elegy upon Mr. Cottons Death. When our Stocks and Farms were not so multiplied, nor our Trade nd Merchandise so increased, nor the Num∣ber
of our Members, nor Mortuaries, so grea as now. As Holy Herbert in his Pious Poem foretold of us. As Gold and Grace never yet did agree, Religion alway siding with Poverty. That as the Church shall thither Westward flie, So Sin shall Trace and Dog her instantly. Yet we could maintain our Officers. No question was then about the Ministers Table how they should be supplied; the Silver and Gold in Darius, his Exchequer was the Lords▪ and he brought it out to advance Temple-work; if the Church Stock needed Enlargement, a word then from the Deacons was sufficient to bring forth more then enough, yea to Moses calling for a restraint; such inlargedness of heart then appeared, as some old Planters may Remember. It was an awful Speech of a Worthy Mini∣ster of the Gospel lately utter'd upon a Falt-Day in a Neighbour Congregation; that he feared the Churches did not understand the Cause of Gods present Controversy; that it was Reformation God looked for, who us'd this Motive to provoke to Duty; that if the present Generation did not attend and do their Duty, the next should not, and would not be capable of it; and indeed how can it be ex∣pected, That they should Reform that which they know not to be an evil, nor to fall upon practice of an unknown Precept; Pastors and
Teachers are accounted as Supernumeraries; no Rule but for one Officer in a Church; and as for Ruling Elders, they have been taken up by Tradition; that there is but one word in the whole Bible for them; yet the Faith once given to the Sains, is earnestly (yet Regularly) to be contended for by them; but they will find them more then twice mentioned, in Rom. 12. among Church Officers, viz. The Teacher is to attend on Teaching, the Pastor or Exhorter, on Exhortation; the Giver, to do it with simplicity; He that Ruleth, with diligence: can there be a fuller description of the Ruling Flders Office and Work, then here is declared, & also in the Plat-form of Church Discipline. It's therefore no Humane Invention, nor Apochriphal Practice of our Predecessors: It's Remembred by some of the Old Planters Children, that there were such men, when they were young, that were called Ruling Elders; but what men they were, or what was their work, they professed they could not tell: What a shame is it to our Churches, that through Disuse, Misuse and Nonuse of them, such a question should be put by any of above Fifty Years of Age, now Living among us; all which is affirmed for a certain known Truth. The same Reverend man of God, being imployed the last Narraganset Wars, by our Worthy Elders, to make Report and Return to the General Court, of the provoking evils then found among us, did represent to them, the Churches incompleatness of Officers, to be
one of the great evils, Provocations, & grou of Displeasure unto God, then among us, sor replied unto him, That the country and Churc were poor, and could not maintain them; he ma them a Ready, Grave, and Divine Answe True, (said he) were they mens Officers; the were argument in what they said, but bei GODS Officers, there was no ground for fe of it; he having Promised and said, Prove a∣try me; if we could but trust him, he wou open the Heavens, and pour down his Ble∣sings: it's Robbing of God we are now call to an account for, we fear that Covetuou∣ness, Pride, and Ambition, hinders the Disc∣very of our Achan, The Lord pour down u∣on Jerusalem, the Spirit of Grace, and Suppli cation, and that he would open the Fountain y Sin and Uncleanness; that Holiness unto the Lo may be writ upon our hearts, houses, and empl¦ments, whether Sacred or civil and upon our P teritys. As we have cause to weep over and  wail our former tears, begging that they m be washed in the Blood of the Lamb, so th these our faint Sighs and Sobs may be Co∣dial, and accepted in the Blood of the eve∣lasting Covenant, that what we say, may  realized in our Souls. The good Lord dire our Hearts into the knowledge of his love waiting for the Pouring forth of his Spirit  on ourselves, and the rising generation, t
may dicern, and by the Divine Aids there∣, be enabled, to do the respective work of r Generation, according to the will of OD, before these things be hid from our yes. That we may have the tasts of that Mercy d Grace, springing from the Love of the ther, who knows the thoughts of his own art, and manifests them to poor Penitents, at they passing through the heart of him, ho layeth in the Fathers Bosome, may descend to our hearts, by the Holy Spirit dwelling  us, which Blessed Circulation Reverting by e Operation of the same Spirit which ma∣th requests for us, who know not to pray  we ought, and passing thro' the heart, and nds of our great Mediator, may arrive, & cend into the heart of the Father, who is e Origine and Fountain of all Blessedness, he Father himself loving us.) That this Spirit may make intercession for  with Groans, which can't be uttered, he at searches the hearts, knowing what is the nd of the Spirit, because he maketh inter∣sion for the Saints according to the Will of d; Oh that we might experience these ngs, that this Heavenly Dove sent into our arts, may make us grean, and mourn, like se in the Clefts of the Rocks, that as the whole eation growns, and travails in pain, with cks stretched out, waiting to be delivered m their Bondage and Corruption, into the
Liberty o the Sons o God; that we receivin the first fruits thereof, may with Eyes an Hands lifted up, wait for the Adoption, eve the Redemption of our Souls and Bodies which Great Grace, the GOD OF AL GRACE, Grant to Us, and Our Poor Chi∣dren, with all his ISRAEL; For the Sa of Our Dear LORD JESUS, to who with the FATHER, and HOLYSPIRI Be the Kingdom, Power, and Glory, For Ever AMEN. A FUNERAL ELEGY, Upon the Death of the truly Reverend Mr. JOHN COTTON. Late Teacher of a Church of Christ at Boston in New-England: Who Died the Twenty Third, was Buried the Twenty Ninth of December. 1652. ANd after Winthrop, Hooker, Shepheards Herse, Doth Cottons Death call for a Mourning Verse. Thy Will be done, yet Lord who dealeth thus, Make this great Death expedient for us. Luther pull'd down the Pope, Calvin the Prelate slew, Of Calvins Lapse, chief Cure to Cottons due. Cotton whose Learning, Temper, Godliness, The Germane Phaenix lively did express. Melancthon's all, may Luther's word but pass Melancthon's all, in our Great Cotton was.
Whilst he was here, Life was more Life to me, Now he is not, Death hence less Death to me. That Comets great mens death do oft forego, This present Comet doth too sadly show, This Prophet's dead, yet must in's Doctrine speak, This Comet saith, else must New-England break. That e're it be, the Heav'ns avert it far, That Meteors should succeed our greatest Star. In Bostons Orb Winthrop and Cotton were, These Lights Extinct, Dark is our Haemisphere. In Boston once how much shin'd of our Glory, VVe now Lament, Posterity will Story. Let Boston live, who had and saw their VVorth. And did them hot our, both in Life and Death. To him New-England trust in this Distress, Who will not leave his Exiles Comfortless. John Norton. FINIS. Reader, Be pleased in page 18 for Christopher Gardner Read Sir Christopher Gardner.
