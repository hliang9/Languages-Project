Nottinghamshires PETITION To the KING: Humbly imploring his sacred Majesty to returne and joyne with both his Houses of Parliament, being delivered by them personally to his Majesty the 30 day of August, opening therein the manifold dangers this distracted King∣dome is like to fall into by reason of his Majesties withdrawing his splendent beams of com∣fort from both his Houses of Parliament. Also a Petition presented unto his Ma∣jesty for the taking downe of His STANDARD. Likewise a relation of the misdemeanors of some of the Cavalliers towards the Petitioners, and how thereby they were like to fall on both sides to a dangerous skir∣mish. September, 6. London, Printed for Thomas Banks, 1642.
The humble Petition of Not∣tingham-shire men to the King, the 30 of August, 1642. SOme of the chiefe Citizens of Notting∣ham, and others of the neighbouring Parishes (both of Gentry and Comu∣nalty) having intelligence of the Kings Majesties comming thither to set up His Standard, thought good to open and manifest their consciences in some particular points, con∣cerning the present state of this distressed king∣dome, the manifold dangers are like to ensue by his Majesties absenting himself from his both Houses of Parliament, the supposed (if not ma∣nifested) malignant intentions of Papists and o∣ther ill affected persons, who daily strive to withdraw His Majesties heart from His loving and loyall houses of Parliament, and others his
good Subjects, the petitioners entreating and promising with ample protestations that if his Majestie will unite himselfe in a happy uni∣on with his both houses of Parliament, utterly rooting out (as infectious to his sacred person) all malignant and ill affected persons that per∣swade his Majesty with wicked and diabolicall arguments to raise war against his both houses of Parliament, banishing from his presence all papisticall spirits that strive to throng the true Church of Christ with Innovations and pope∣ry, that then, these said petitioners will with their lives & fortunes assist his Majesty against any forreign disturbances abroad, or any civill hatcht rebellions at home, to the maintayning of the true protestant Religion, the safety and honour of his majesties person, the welfare and happy government of this his Kingdome. The true forme of the Petition sent to London by a Nottingham-shire Gentleman. Most gracious and dread Soveraign. SEeing many of your faithfull and loyall Subjects (yea this whole Kingdom) groa∣ning under the heavy burthen of severalll dis∣contents
to their utter ruine for ever, chiefly caused by the malicious practises of papists and other ill affected persons, that not only strive to egge on your sacred person (who of your selfe, (as we doubt not) farre from such thoughts) to contend with your both Houses of Parlia∣ment, but doe endeavour also to pollute our Church, the true protestant Religion, with in∣novations and popery to the utter ruine of the Kingdome, and to the hazard of body & soul's damnation. We therefore the petitioners, not as factious men, affecting a popular parity in the Church, nor as Schismaticks ayming at the dis∣solution of the state Ecclesiasticall, but as the faithfull servants of Christ, and loyall and obe∣dient Subjects to your Majesty, do here humbly prostrate our selves at your sacred feet, desiring your majesty as you affect the good of your poor Subjects, the salvation of their souls, and the safety of your Kingdome, to re-sheath your sword of anger, and to knit your Royall person in a happy union with your both houses of Par∣liament, extirpating all papisticall and ill affe∣cted persons that with their daily malicious whisperings, doe strive to pollute your sacred
ears; for did your Majesty but pleas to forelook on the dangers that wil pursue on this Kingdom by reason of your Majesties withdrawing your royall person from your both houses of Parlia∣ment, doubtlesse your pious intentions would soon consent to this our just and necessary peti∣tion; oh how many thousand souls will be un∣cas'd if the sword be once drawn, how many houses, nay (with grief need fear it) how many Citties wilbe utterly ruin'd; oh dread Soveraign be pleased therfore to consider that both sides are your Subjects and have not so dangerous a pestilence creep by so small a matter, besides, the absenting of your sacred person from your both Houses of Parliament, doth not only give life to the fatall inconveniences, but hinders the prosperous proceeding of our poor brethren in Ireland, which at this present lye in a most mi∣serable and languishing estate, by the bloodi∣nesse and tyranny of that rude crue of papists there overswaying, and for what we know (our domestick and bosome Romanists) may endea∣vour here in England to attempt the like ty∣ranny, when such swarmes of them are rooted in the very entralls of this Kingdome, for the
suppressing of these, relieving our poore bre∣thren in Ireland, and for the bringing to an u∣niforme governement the dis-joynted peice-meals of this Kingdom, what succour or reliefe can your Parliament doe I say in these without your royall presence to confirme their actions? lastly be pleased to take to your gratious consi∣deration, the unnaturalnesse of this discontent and warre, that father must fight against son, son against brother, brother against Uncle; Oh what inhumanesse is it, and all in the interim a laughing stocke to forreigne Nations. Now have your Princely Majesty obtained the knowledge of our griefs and fears, hoping that your highnesse (since we unript the sores) will vouchsafe us a speedy cure by the happy joyning of your royall person with your both houses of Parliament, which thing if your Maje∣sty be pleased to do, we shall not only yeeld an eternall sacrifice of thankefulnesse for the same to your Majesty, but our lives and fortunes shall be at your highnesse service to manifest the same; this with all dutifull submission referring our selves to your Majesties pleasure whom we beseech for Christ his sake so to dispose your
royall heart to do therein as shall be to his glo∣ry, your highnesse honour, the good of this Church, and the endlesse comfort of we your loyall Subjects, to which we all your Majesties most humble Subjects say amen. No sooner was this Petition presented and read, but his Majesty (struck with clemency) immediatly caused his Standard to be taken downe, and was more willing than they that peace should be sent immediatly certain Articles by 2. of his Lords to both Houses of Parlia∣ment, which reasonable Propositions being consented to by the said houses, should immediatly conclude a peace; but the Cavalliers all this while were not a litle moved at the happy successe this Petition found, therefore some certain of them being ful of gail and spleen, and withall taking a cloak for their wicked intention, saying that the Petitioners were rather Traytors then Subjects in offering to move his Majesty in such a way as is alltoge∣ther a blemish to his honour, in that a King must stoop to his subjects, when 'tis more fitting the Subjects should submit to him, alleadging that his Prerogative was clipt, and ere they would suffer it, their lives (as for fortunes, they had none) should be sacrificed to redeeme his wrongs, in such like passions they sought out for the Petitioners, and having intelligence where some of them
were especially the chiefe) hastned unto them and would have fallen upon them, but they on the other side suspe∣cting (or at least wise fearing) some ill actions or other pretended against them by the Cavalliers, sent with all speed to the Major of the City, informing him in wht danger they were, and withall intreating that some of the Trained Bands should be in a readinesse to quell all uproars if it chanc'd that the Cavalliers should bee over busy (according to their usuall customes) in set∣ting bloodily upon any of his Majesties faithfull Subjects, which thing the Major soone accom∣plished, and the Cavalliers were faine to return as they came without further attempting any such wicked enterprize. FINIS.
