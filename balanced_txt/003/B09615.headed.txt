From my Laboratory over against St. Clements in the strand, this 15th of July 1665 HAving this day perused the Bill of Mortality and finding it to mount to 1089 and Consulting with my dayly observations; the many and indeed innumerable prescriptions, vended to the people, besides those of Ounions, Garlicke, Musterd, Figges, Rue, Treacle, Metheredate &c. old and rediculous prescriptiones (now new vampt,) by those Learned Runaway Dutchmen of Amen Corner, that not many weeks since at plentiful Tables quaffing in merry Bowls, would not discourse of less the out Hectoring the severest Plague, and by there termes of Art, as useless prescriptions assured you of there Cures in that kind to thousands, bu ow good men (two of their tribe onely excepted,) not to be heard of almost on this side Barwick or Pendenice, these are the learned me neither dare trust God nor their Heathenish Authors, in the City, that at other times, flock about your sick beds, and like water men  sir, God in Infinite mercy cease this present Plague, and grant, that that Locus of Amen Corner never return again, to be a Plague or Pernience, to this most glorious City, but that it may injoy health as that Ancient City of Room 500 years, without a man of that profession, unless they lay aside insolency and pride; and assume like the well meaning Chymist Courage and resolusion, to visite the afflicted, as there duties to see with their own Eyes, and feel with there own hands, (not trusting Examiners) and then truly and faithfuly administring, those specificks, that according to the intent of God and Nature heal the sicke, and save the sound, and such must be, true Hermetick Physick, not rotten dull druges; and untill such Physicians and medicines; shall be Countinanced and imploid though Jacke, Will, and Dike, as a grave Colegiate (though no Conjurer) not long since to me stild the Chymists, neither this present plague, nor other Acute, nor Cronicall diseases shall ever be truly Cured, but in time of greatest Calamity, shall be left to the devouring malady, by E. F. A. and the worshipfull Sir J. himself whilest they go a simpling, as a witty gentle∣man, one of there own late admirers by this folowing letter to me, merrily expresseth. Deer Dr. I Was infinitely pleased with your present, and am now as thankfull, I guess by what I read there in Print, your noble fraternity is become a Corporation, if so, I owe you a bonefire, and a peal in the Belfry, and cannot I speak it without flatery, or Complement but exceedingly Commend, the noble Chymistes who so Christianly and nobly sticke to miserably afflicted London; an action which gains honour here, but a better Garland hereafter; whilst the Gallinest flye the diseased City, and run a simpling into the Cuntery; which suites well enough, with their deceived and deceiving, method, and therein they shew themselves as very Heathens, as there Grandsire Gallen; they formerly stuck Closs to a Dispensatory, but now want of honor and Conscience; furnishes them with another Dispensatory; not of practise, but of the duty of their profession, in runing away in this time of Mortality, these Dutchmen of Amen Corner; these enemies to England, no Satyrist can pinch them hard enough, yet in all my anger, were I as knowing in their rotten drugs, as I am of their putrified actions, I would make them immortall in a Ballet, To the tune of Robin Hood, if this be the way to bring Phlebotomy to honor, may I never see Horse-Leech more, our Brother of— lately wished the Turke into Christendom, and were it not for Dr. H. and Dr. B. I my selfe, would invite the Ottoman Family to make war upon them, if they scapt his Semiter, his Bow string would prove as good as any of Hipocrates Aphorismes, Deer Dr. I was glad to see that under Rawlinsons hand, to take off that base unworthy scandall, of Johnson; though to me it signified nothing for I my selfe did heer Rawlinson Confess, himself Cured by you, with a civill and humble acknowledgment; of your Care and Cure of him, before many witnesses in his own house; pray Jog Mr. G. that I may have an occasion to come to London, I long to be in your Laboratory, to tell you, Deer Dr. that I am your very humble servant. W. R. July the 7th ANd thus the world may see that these men of Art and Method, who not many moneths since, sported themselves, in rediculous follies in the face of this glorious City, by scurrilous Ballets, against the true healing Chymists, and by it asigned us to be distroyed by their fellow Dutchmen, as the greatest Enemies to his Majesty and people; and now themselves, fled and leave their reputation to be trampled like Dun in the mire, &c. by perpetuall infamy never to be obliterated, shall ever by my hourly indeavors, and to advance that noblest, best, truest, and most safest Art of Pyrotechnie as a duty incombant on my Conscience, if in the prosecution I perish, be it to Gods glory, and I have my ends, and that the true honour of God and the good of the people in this present Calamity may be advanced, I doe freely and faithfully with my utmost indeavours, and best of Art and Medicine, (and think it not be low the honour of a Physician) offer my service to all sorts and degrees of people during this present distemper of the plague, without the least expectation of fees or gratuities, if not well able to spare it, provided I have admition of egress and regrses, into every infected family, and will be Content, with barely the value of my medicines, and those at so reasonable Rates, as not to the abuse of either rich or poor, and this not designed out of vain glory; or other end but Christian bowels of Compasion, as it is the Cause of God, the King and the Nation, with hope that all those of our number of Chymi∣call Physicians will do the like, that so we may have the blessing of God on our just undertakings, and the prayers and Countinance of good men, to suport us in our intensions against the worst of men, that only boast of Learned ignorance, and are truely ignorant in the art of healing, as by my next Book A whip for Gallianism &c. Now preparing for the Press will appear, to the detecting that greatest of Cheates the method of Physick Galennicall let them suport it by jugling detraction and the spiriting of poor Mr. Johnson their Laboratoring druge to vend their Bilingsgate frip, as a broken Champion, to their reeling worships; that can in all his discourse for them, boast of nothing, but there gravity and learning, (not healing) yet I think not so good an Antiquery, as to know that this formall Seminary, was in its first institution, but seven in number, two only Physicians and five Studients, as I am Credibly informed, but now so numerous a spawn, as fitted to run a way in whole showles, blessed be God for all his mercies, Amen.
