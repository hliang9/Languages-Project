A Nevv-yeares-Gift For His MAIESTY, OR An humble Petition from his SVBIECTS. Being principally intended for His Ma∣jesties private Meditation, but the way of presenting being difficult, it is thought convenient to communicate it to the publike view. Weake meanes great things may cause with little cost, When greater meanes have been but labour lost. Printed in the yeare, 1644
The Epistle to the Reader. Courteous Reader, THe wayes of the providence of God are very strict towards most men: we have seene the wayes and meanes that have been used to regaine His Majesty, but all have failed hi∣therto, and who knowes under what stone this treasure lieth; it is not amisse therefore to turne every stone that hath any probability of gaine in it, and who can tell whether such a vanity as this may not effect that which the greatest meanes have been too weak to do: if it faile in its particuler occasion for which it was intended, yet it may do thee good, to whom it is commended, By a well wisher of peace with truth.
A Newyears-Gift for His MAjESTY: Or, the Poets Petition to the KI DRead Sovereigne, Britains Monarch, Charles the Great, Whom God hath set in the Imperiall seat Of three late famous, now distracted Lands, And hath delivered up into thy hands Their Crownes and Scepters, heare we Thee intreat The humble sute, which with affections great We, a small number of thy Subjects true, In humble sort present unto thy view; We have beheld with sad and grieved hearts How all thy Subjects from their severall parts Have Suers bin unto thy Grace of late, For ease and comfort to this dying State; Yet we among them all have never yet Ingaged our studies, nor imploy'd our wit To seek unto your Highnesse for redresse, Therefore we are imboldened to expresse Our hearts desires now unto your Grace, Whiles others fears doe to their hopes give place, Yet hope we doe that you will daine to heare That which doth now concerne your Selfe so neare; Our fist request which we are bold to make Unto your Highnesse is, that you would take
Into your serious thoughts the sad estate That all your Kingdomes are brought to of late: Consider with your Selfe the griefe and woe That many thousands daily undergoe; The groans of wounded, bleeding, dying men; The cries of widows, fatherlesse, and then The bitter wants that many doe endure, Whose trades were wont their comfort to procure: The cruell havock, and the desolation That now is made in all parts of this Nation: The sad effects that doe on War attend, The streams of bloud that English men doe spend In kiling and destroying one another, Father against children, brother against brother: And having set before your Princely Eye The vision of your peoples misery, Then if to them you beare a Princely love, If any pity will your Spirit move; As in your breast compassion hath a place, Thinke how to ease them of this wofull case: Your humble Suters will not undertake For to prescribe the way that you should take; We know the way and means to you is known, Would you be pleas'd such noble wayes to owne; We know you know that you might in one day Your Kingdomes hopes revive, their fears destroy: You might by comming to your Parliament In friendly sort, in love, peace and content Expell our woes, and stop that stream of bloud Which now runs down even like a swelling oud; You might by this neale our deep gasping wound, And make your mournfull dying Kingdomes sound▪
And what were this to do, were it, O King, Your Selfe to thraldome, or disgrace to bring! Would it impaire you credit or degree, Or make you lesse esteem'd or lov'd to be▪ Would it your titles or your state destroy, Or would your dignities thereby decay? Would it your Honour or your Selfe defame, Or bring you unto poverty or shame? Would it debar your just Prerogative, Or you of any lawfull power deprive? No, no, it would not, but if any thing Would make you lov'd and honour'd as a King, This, this, would make you honour'd and renown'd, Your name unto all ages would be crown'd With lasting Fame and Honour, and this age To honour you, you deeply would ingage: Now if your honour and your dignity, Your riches, credit, and prosperity, Be in your peoples welfare thus involv'd, That both if one cannot but be dissolv'd; What fear, yea what sadnesse then doth make Your Majesty this severe course to take Your peoples intrest in you to destroy, And in them your owne safety, peace and joy; You in your wisdome call'd a Parliament, The Nation chose them with a free consent; And to them gave their power: they sate, and you To them much grace and love (did seem) to shew; You in your solemne weighty Declarations, Your Oaths and Vows, and contant Protestation, Were alwayes plea'd their welfare to include, All thoughts of spleen (you seed) to exclude▪
And past an Act them not dissolv'd to be Till they themselves should thereunto agree; But now that you should in so short a space Exclaime all those your former acts of Grace, And seek by all the force and power you may Them (and all those that love them) to destroy, Ad Rebels, Traytors, them esteem to be, This seems a ridle to all honesty; This makes your Subjects thinke they know not wh Your Honour hereby gaineth many a spot: We hope that you your Subjects poore will pity, And take compassion on your famous City; We hope such love you to your Selfe doe beare As not your bowells from your Selfe to teare; We hope your Children and Posterity (Which objects are of future misery) Will so incline and move your Princely Heart That you will from your present counsells part, And wisely ere more guiltlesse bloud be spent Come joyne your Selfe with your grave Parliament, That so just judgement may be done on those That are to You, and to your Kingdomes, foe. O that your Grace would ponder in your Heart What 'tis we crave, from what wee'd have you part! Suppose you should hereby procure the hae Of those that seeke the ruine of the State, Or should inence that base malignant rew That seek the down fall of your Lands and you, Or reap hereby disgrace, reproach and shame, Or staine your credit, honour or your fame: What then, O King! should there be grounds to cse Your Majesty to violate the Lawes
Of God, of Nature, and of reason right, And in defiance of them all to fight? What, is your Honour and your Reputation Of greater value then a famous Nation▪ Or doe you deem your credit at that rate To be preferr'd before a Christian State? Or is your Will and Humour better then The lives and soules of many thousand men? What, shall such fugitives from Justice be More fear'd and lov'd in such a high degree, Above all your grave Counsellors of State Which all disloyalty detest and hate? O King, consider in what state you stand, Call to your minde the state of Ireland, And thinke on whom that just revenging hand Will vengeance take for that destroyed Land; Looke upon Scotland with a carefull eye, And see how they your doings doe defie, See how they covenanted have again▪ And will not cease War till they Peace obtaine: Looke upon England, see with what content They joyned have with Scotlands Covenant, And now they joyntly with each other stand, Lest they become like dying Ireland: O that these arguments would you perswade Over all difficulties for to wade! And that you would not this our sute despise To joyne with your great Councell grave and wise, Which is the only means that you can take Your Selfe and Yours happy for to make. Returne, returne, O Englands King returne! Thy Subjects hearts with loyall love doe burne:
We weepe, we fast, we pray, we strive aaine To set our King upon His Throne againe: And this our Christian labour nere shall cease Till Thou returne, or we have perfect peace; Which that our God may send, both night and y They your Petitioners shall ever pray. FINIS.
