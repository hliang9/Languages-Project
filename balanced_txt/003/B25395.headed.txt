The just Reward of a debauched Cavallier: Or, The wicked and Divellish intentions of onc Thomas Browne a late Cavallier, and now a Prisoner in New-gate; because Redding was yeelded up upon a Treaty and Composition to the Parliaments forces. For which he hath lately made a contract and Articled with the Divell, and would have given his Soule and body for the injoyment of his lust and pleasure for 40. yeares, as in the whole story you may read in this ensuing booke. Which Contract and Agreement was found in his pocket by the Constable and his Watch in high Holburne, and being carried before Justice Lowder confessed his divellish intents; for which he was committed to New-gate, and there lyes to receive his Tryall according to Law, this next Sessions in the Old Baily. May this 1th. 13 Printed for I. Ickson. 1643.
The just reward of a debau∣ched Cavallier, &c. THat the Divell is a strong temptor hath beene clearely manifest from the beginning, for being himselfe throwne downe from the glorious estate of an Angell of light, the over-throw of Mankind is the continuall aime of his malignant ambition. But to effect this he doth not by a violent power assault the frailety of man, but endeavours to allure him by many false perswasions, promising like a false wooer that which he never intendeth to performe. Every day doth bring in many sad demonstrations to prove this truth; women growne envious with age, are by him in hope of revenge perswaded to become witches, he thrusts on others to commit Rapes and murthers, some to be wholly given to the pleasure of women, putting such a wild∣fire in their bloud, that with an insatiable desire they delight to em∣brace their owne damnation; and others to maintaine their glittering pride in this world, have drawers on to proceed in unlawfull courses, as stealing, cheating and couzening, together with robbing by the High-way and breaking of Houses, whereby at last they are compel∣led to make the World their Priest by confessing their wicked Lives as the Gallowes, where they commonly lay the blame on evill company, and the Divells temptation. That which I shall now deliver is a Story full of terrible amazement, wherein the Divells cunning temptation is set downe in the blackest collours, and in the Relation thereof I shall be carefull to satisfie the Reader with the truth as report hath given most certaine information. It is well knowne that this Cavallier who hath some acquaintance with Learning, and is a scholler the more is the pity, being pinched
with some want fell into a strange humour of disliking his present e∣state, because he could not be revenged according to his will upon the Parliaments forces at Redding; and whereas he should have borne the afflicting hand of God with patience, he desired to communicate his griefe unto the Divell, being willing to ease himselfe of his present ne∣cessity upon any tearmes, and casting with himselfe divers waies wher∣by he might change his fortunes, none pleased his fancy, for his desire was ease and idlenesse, without want or hunger, which how it could be obtained without labour and taking of paines hee could not con∣trive: And to give you his Character, he is a man wholly devoted to his pleasure, which in despight of Aristotle and all morrall Philoso∣phers he accounted to be the chiefe good and happinesse of this life; he studied how to give satisfaction to his sensuall desires, and in them to drowne himselfe even to satiety, hee thought that the swallowing de∣lights of eating and drinking were that which man should seeke to en∣joy; soft Musicke was the object of his hearing, and the often enjoying of women active in trust he esteemed to be the top branch of this tree of pleasure, so that he was amorous wanton, luxious, gluttonous, and in all things a meere Epicure in pursuing sensuall delights, soft and ef∣feminate in all his waies, and a man wholly sold unto sin, unto which he had given up his heart, and sought onely to compasle his voluptu∣ous satisfaction, thinking all the women in the Turkes Seraylio were not enough to satisfie his greedy appetite, and was indeed a slave unto the Divell and his owne lusts. But now hee being thus affected there arose a doubt in his minde how hee might be able to enjoy his lustfull speculations, and covert them into act and deed, since hee knew that money was that which would fetch unto him all the objects of his desires, and make him happy in the change of pleasures which hee so earnestly fancied; ha∣ving therefore collected his thoughts together, hee propounded unto himselfe that money must bee had, as the commanding Queene of Love, Lust and all sensuall pleasures; a long time he lingred doubtfull what to doe, making many wicked disputations with himselfe untill he grew little better than franticke, and at last began to thinke that the Divell could helpe him in accomplishing his wicked purposes. This Thomas Browne finding his hopes frustrate in raising his estate by plundering the Parliaments forces wch intent be fully had, & seeing all hopes lost, knowing that he could doe nothing without gold and
silver, and having no estate in respect of that whereby hee might bring about his intentions, for he understanding nothing but money would compasse his desires; whereupon hee began to call into his mind the Divells readinesse and power to doe what he most desired. The Divell being subtill would not at the first suggest any way or meanes unto him: to make him more troubled and more greedy of his assistance, but yet often he led him by his fancy into the fields, knowing that solitude and oportunity make bashfulnesse forsake mn and women, and open their thoughts in a more free and wicked manner, and so this voluptuous Male∣content would walke out into solitary places, as if it had been for his recreation, but indeed it was to enjoy the contemplation of his owne wicked purposes, he would pull downe his hat in his eyes, looke directly on the ground, and walke so softly at if he would not bruise the tender stalke of a Couslip, but all this while his amazed lookes, and his uneven stamping-paces, shewed that he bore a trouble at his heart, and that hee had no peace within; in this manner he frequented solitary places free from any com∣pany, in which places the Divell met him, and answered him by sound of a voyce to his desires, but as he saith, never saw him per∣fectly in what shape he came; sometimes he would walke up to Redriffe marshes where very few frequent, unlesse Butchers that fetch home their Cattell from the fields to kill for the Shambles, East-cheape, or the like markets; and in these melancholy obscure paths he would often wander alone, when he bethought himselfe that the onely soule of mans felicity was pleasure, and riches, and to be esteem'd, serv'd, obey'd and honour'd; to live and be be∣lov'd of women, to fare deliciously, weare brave cloathes, have Gold at his command, servants of sundry kinds of Arts and quali∣ties, that so he might change and vary his delights which hee ac∣counted the true felicity of Nature, which doth still open her pregnant bosome to shew the variety of flowers and fruits wher∣with she is adorned, losing himselfe in the labourinth of concei∣ted felicity; he resolved speedily to make an agreement, and con∣tract with the Divell who should furnish him with the delights of this world, and to article with him, that he would bee assured of his life for forty yeares, he being now betwixt one and two and twenty yeares of age; and further, that he would covenant during
this time of forty yeares to have yearely paid him downe the full summe of two thousand pounds starling, and every Holy-day throughout the yeare forty pounds starling; and if at any time hee desired to marry a Wife she should bring a portion proportiona∣ble to the aforesaid two thousand pounds a yeare. Moreover, what woman-kind whether widow, maid or wife he should cast his affection upon, she should forthwith be ready to meete his embraces, and to answer his desires in carnall copula∣tion; likewise during the time of forty yeares hee would fare of the most daintiest provision that those climates afforded where he remained; weare the richest cloaths, heare the choysest Musicke, with all the additions that the Divell could devise to give him content withall, and that still he should remaine as youthfull as at the first: those commands he selected to himselfe, and walked af∣terward home in a very melancholy manner, and so going to bd he did there summe up the heads of his desires, intending the next day to bring his plot to ripenesse, and draw these Articles forth, and write them very fairely in parchment, which hee did in the very same manner as is before mentioned, and to make the contract with the Divell more firme and sure, he promised the Di∣vell that if those Articles formerly mentioned were by him duely performed, he would on that condition give him at the expiration of forty yeares his soule and body, and in confirmation thereof he with his owne bloud subscribed his Name, which was a very fearefull thing as ever was knowne, that a man for the fruition of a little worldly pleasure should thus purchase himselfe a state of Damnation, and give up his Soule and Body for ever to the Divell. But so it was that the next day he got up early and made ready his aforesaid Obligation and Contract, and so intending to meete with the Divell in the fieldes in those solitary walkes wherein he had formerly used to frequent, he went out with this wicked in∣tention to meete with the Divell, and to give his soule to the Divell for the pleasures of this world. and for ever to damne him∣selfe: such was his horrible Resolution, for he had not bin long in contriving the plot, and intended now to bring it to an unhappy confusion. But such was the mercy of God towards him that hee
was disapointed of his purpose, and his designe carried on thus farre was by Gods providence utterly disappointed, for he thinking to walk into the fields as formerly hee had done, and to passe by the Watch undiscerned; early in the morning being about one or two a clocke the Watch seeing him goe in a suspitious manner began to que∣stion him and aske him whither hee went, but his answers giving them no satisfaction, and his lookes being full of feare and horrour, his face and brow disturbed through his guilty Conscience, and all his gestures declaring that hee was troubled in minde, and had some∣thing that sate heavy at his heart; their suspition began to encrease, so that the Watch not knowing what his wicked intent might bee began to search his pockets, where to the great admiration of all that were present they discovered the most horrid peece of wicked∣nesse that could bee imagined, for they found that this Thomas Browne had beene a wilfull wicked Traytor against his owne Soule, and had upon the condition aforesaid betrayed and given it to the Divell, as by a contract signed with his bloud, which they tooke out of his pocket it ardently appeared. Whereupon the Watch being strucke into a great amazement carried him before Justice Lou∣der, who upon examination found out his horrid plot and purpose, and thereupon committed him to New-gate, where he remaines un∣till he shall be convicted by Law toreceive condigne punishment at the next Sessions, where he lyes in a most desperate state, and condition fearefull to behold and see; divers Divines comming to him, perswa∣ding and comforting him upon his true repentance that his Soule shall be saved: and so I conclude, desiring the Lord to shew mercy upon his afflicted soule and conscience. FINIS.
