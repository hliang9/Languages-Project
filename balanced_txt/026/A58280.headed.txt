THE REBEL CAPTIVE. An Excellent New SONG, On the taking of Argile in Scotland by three Young Men, who met him as he was flying away in Disguise, after his Men had deserted hin, &c. Behold Argile the Famous Rebel, He Who aw'd Three Kingdoms, now subdu'd by Three. Oh Archibald! (to save) hard was thy Doom, I'th' Field a wretched Life to loose at Home, To the Tune of Sawny and Jockey. &c. I. THree bony Lads were Sawny Cloud Hammilâˆ£ton, And Andrew Grier the Captain that led 'em on, When for the Loons it prov'd a fatal day, Argile was ta'n, and all his Men run away. When Duglas Jiv'd him, Riv'd him, Driv'd him And of all hopes had depriv'd him, Routed him, flouted him, The De'l bigotted him, And now the States a Rope have allotted him. II. On June the Fifteenth, oh! 'twas a Fatal day, Archibald fled, and all the Rogues run away In a disguise the Loon thought to shun his Fate, Three bonny Boys stopped him on the Gate, In a blew Bonnet, On it One hit Such a bread Gash as made him tull own it, Oh! spare me, Disarm me, And do no more harm me, For I am Argile the head o' th' Whig Army. III. Quarters, oh! quarters! I yield my self Prisoner, Here take my Sword too that useless Tool of War. Footmen and Horses, now I all give you o're, Dunbartons Forces no Man can stand before. But they will fight him, Right him, Fright him, The proudest Fo; will put to the flight him, Thunder him, Plunder him, Dash all asunder him, And make Argile himself truckle under him. IV. Thus having yielded up both his Sword and Durg, The Bony Boys convey'd him to Edingburg, Where with a Train he enters the Water-Gate, Th' Hangman walking before in Muckle State With a Hemp Garter, The Martyr to Quarter And by the Lugs to cut the Loon shorter. The same Fate Ever wait, To Crown the Rebels Pate, And all such Traytors as dare oppose the State. Printed by N. Thompson at the Entrance int  ld Spring-Garden near Charing-Cross.
