THE PREFACE TO THE READER. Courteous Reader, HAving observed for several Years, that there hath been a great want of a Piece of Sea-Gunnery, that has been principally adap∣ted for Sea-Service, in a Treatise by it self; (for those Books that were Extant, were chiefly inten∣ded for Land Service;) and at this time most of them being out of Print, I judg'd this a fit op∣portunity for the publishing this small Treatise, hoping it will be gratefully accepted by our Sea-Gunners. And in regard that those who would be Students in that Art, ought (in some competent measure) to be acquainted with Arithmetick; for the sake of such, I have exhibited two Compendiums thereof, one in Vulgar, and the other in Decimal Arithmetick, as a necessary preparation for the working those Questions that are incident to that Art.
And for the ease of such as are not fully ac∣quainted therewith, I have furnished them with a Proportional Scale, whereby they may perform all the Operations that are useful in Gunnery; as also, to extract the Square and Cube-Roots, and how to perform the same by Logarithms, and by Gunter's-Scale. To which I have added several necessary Ta∣bles useful in Gunnery, with proper Questions and their Answers, and useful Observations and Instructions, And for the better accomplishing the Design of this Book, I have consulted with the best ap∣proved Authors, that have written on this Subject. Also at the end of this Treatise, I have pre∣sented you with a small Tract as an Appendix, particularly of the use of the Proportional Scale; and of the use of a Rule of a new contrivance, fit for the Pocket, that hath upon it, an Epitome of the Practical part of Gunnery in it self, which I call the Sea-Gunner's Rule: All which I submit to the favourable construction of the Judicious, And rest your Friend to serve you, John Seller.

THE Sea-Gunner. A COMPENDIUM OF Vulgar Arithmetick. CHAP. I. ARITHMETICK is the Science of Numbring, and Resolving all Questions of Numbers, Rational or Irrational. Notation of Numbers. 1. Notation of Numbers, is the Descrip∣tion and Explication of any Number by Fi∣gures or Notes, whereof there are ten, and no more. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Notation of Numbers, consisteth of Names, Va∣lues, Degrees, or Places and Periods. As 1. Numbers are named, Ʋnites, Thou∣sands, Millions, &c. 2. Their Values is reckoned from the Right-hand. 3. Their Degrees or Places, are ten-fold, &c. 4. Their Periods, are Ʋnites, Tens, Hun∣dreds, which are Illustrated in the following Table. A Table of Notations. Names Millions Thousands Ʋnites. Value CXI CXI CXI Degrees or Places 987 654 321 Periods 3 2 1 Integers. 999 999 999 888 888 888 777 777 777 666 666 666 555 555 555 444 444 444 333 333 333 222 222 222 111 111 111
RƲLE. Begin at the Right-hand and go backward, and say, 9 in the first place is 9. 9 in the the second place is 90. 9 in the third place is 900. 9 in the fourth place, is 9000, Nine Thousand; 9 in the fifth place, is 90000, Ninety Thousand; and so on; observing the Names above, their Values, Places and Periods. NƲMERATION. NƲmeration is the first part of Arthme∣tick, and serveth to express the value of any Number given; The Integers of Num∣bers, are the nine Figures and the Cypher, and begin to number them at the Right-hand, to the Left, increasing each Figure ten-times as before. ADDITION. ADition is the gathering of two, or more Numbers into one Sum, and hath two general Cases. CASE I. In Addition of Tens, Hun∣dreds, Thousands, &c.
RƲLE. Draw a line under the Numbers given, begin at the Right-hand, and first place; add up the Unites, carry the Tens to the next place, and let the remaining Works below; so do all along as you go backward, and in the last place, set down all that you have added, with that which you carry. Example.   Years From the Creation of the World to Noah▪s Flood, 1656 From Noah's Flood, to the giving of the Law, 0875 From the Law, to the Birth of our Saviour, 158 From the Birth of Christ, to the Year 1690   5729 In Addition of Integers and Parts. RƲLE. Draw a Line under the Numbers given, and begin as before, at the least De∣nomination; add up right, and set the parti∣cular Sums of the several rows, under every one, (in their proper place) according to their respective value, whether it be in Num∣ber, Weight, or Measure. Example. There are several Men owe a Merchant several Sums of Monev; it is required to know the Sum of those Debts.
  l. s. d. One Man owes, 230 17 02 Another owes, 110 16 04 Another, 074 10 09 Another, 979 08 11 The Total Debt is 1395 13 02 SƲBTRACTION. SƲbtraction is the taking a lesser Number from a greater, or an Equal from an Equal. What remains, is the Residue, or Excess, and bath two Cases. CASE I. In Subtraction of Tens, Hun∣dreds, Thousands, from Tens, Husdreds, Thousands, &c. RƲLE. Set the greater Number above the lesser, and draw a line under them. Then begin at the Right-Hand, and take the lesser from the greater, or Equals from E∣quals, and set the Differenee or Residue, un∣der every one, in their due place.
Example.   l. A Man oweth to a Merchant 9758 And he hath paid of that Debt, 3514 There Remains due, 6244 CASE II. When some of the inferiour Numbers are greater than the superiour Numbers. RƲLE. Set your Numbers in order as before; draw a line under them, and begin at the Right-hand; and according to the Numbers respective value, borrow one of the next to the Left-hand above, out of which Subtract, what remains add to the superiour, and set their Sum under the line; then what you borrow, pay to the next Number on the Left-hand below, and so proceed through∣out the work, according to this or the for∣mer Rule.   l. s. d. As from 529 13 4 Take 347 16 7 Rests, 171 16 9 Proof. Add the two inferiours; their Sum is equal to the superiour.
MƲLTIPLICATION. MƲltiplication serveth to perform that at once which Addition doth at many times. And to multiply readily, it is necessary that the ensuing Table should be perfectly learned. Pythagora's Table. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 The Ʋse of this Table is to muliply any Num∣ber in the outer Column to the left hand; by any Figure at the top, and in the common Angle of meeting, is the Answer to the Question; as 7 times 9, you will find to be 63.
In Multiplication, Note, that the uppermost Number is always the Multplicand, and the lower the Multiplier; and the Figures which remain when the Work is done, is called the Product. Multiplication may be divided into six Cases. CASE I. If the Multiplicand have dovers Figures, and the Multiplier but one; Rule. Draw the Multiplier into the first Figure of the Multiplicand, and subscribe the Units of the Product, but carry the Tens to the next place; then draw the Multiplier into the second Figure of the Multplicand, and add the Tens you carried to the Units of that Product, subscribe the Units of their Sam, and carry the Tens to the third place; accordingly proceed to the end of the work. As, if 5436 is to be mutiplied by 6, according to the following Example. 5436, Multiplicand. 6, Multiplier. 32616, Product.
CASE II. If the Multiplicand and the Multiplier have each of them more than one Figure; Rule. For the first Figure, do as before; and ha∣ving drawn the second Figure of the Multi∣plier into the first Figure of the Multiplicand,  the Units of the Product under that se∣cond Figure of the Multiplier, and carry the Tens, setting all the rest of the Multiplica∣tion as by the former Rule; and this direct∣eth, making so many particular Rows of Products as you Figures in your Multiplier; at last add them together for a total Pro∣duct. Example. 4532, Multiplicand. 32, Multiplier. 9064, Particular 13596, Products. 145024, Total Product.
CASE III. If Cyphers are in the Multiplicand and Multiplier, or either of them; Rule. Set down to the right hand of the first Product as many Cyphers as are in the Mul∣tiplicand and Multiplier, so that the first U∣nit of the Product of the first Multiplier may stand under the first Figure of the Mul∣tiplicand, and work the rest according to the other Rule. Example. As,
CASE IV. If a Cypher or Cyphers be in the middle of the Multiplicand; Rule. Work according to the former Rules till you come to the Cyphers, then under the first o, subscribe the Tens you carried; but under the rest of the Cyphers set Cyphers, except under the last, where subscribe the Units remaining of the Product of the next Figure of the Multiplier drawn into the Multiplicand; the rest is according to the other Rules. Example, As,
CASE V. If a Cypher or Cyphers be in the middle of the Multiplier; Rule. Multiply as before is taught, until you come to the Cyphers in the Multiplier, which subscribe in order before the particular pro∣duct of the next Multipler, drawn into the Multiplicand; then set the Units of its Pro∣duct under that Multiplier, and observe the other Rules for the rest. As, CASE VI. If Cyphers be both in the middle of the Multipli∣cand, and also in the Multiplier; Rule. When you come to the Cyphers in the
Multiplicand, then under the first Cyphers place, set the Tens you carried (if any be) and after that, as many Cyphers as are in the Multiplier (no Figure intervening) then mul∣tiply into the next Figure of the Multipli∣cand, subscribe the Units of the Product, and carry the Tens in the same Row, and so do in every Row of the particular Pro∣ducts, according as this or some of the other Rules require. Example. You may abbreviate Multiplication by the help of Subtraction; especially when to be multiplied by 5, or 9; As,
CASE I. To multiply any Number by 5. Rule. Subtract half the Number, and to it add a Cypher. Example. As, 45276 Product 226380 being to be multiplied by 5, halve the Num∣ber, and add a Cy∣pher at the latter end, and the Work is done. CASE II. To multiply any Number by 9. Rule. Add a Cypher to the Number given to be multiplied by 9, and subtract the first Num∣ber out of it, and the Remainer is the Pro∣duct or Answer of the Question. Example. Let the Number be 6789, to which add o Cypher, and the Number is thus, 67890;
out of which subtract the first Number, and the Remainder is 61101, the Product or Answer of the Question. DIVISION. DIvision serveth to divide any Number into as many parts as you please, and consisteth of three Numbers, the Divisor, the Dividend, and the Quotient; for see how often the Divisor is contained in the Divi∣dend, so many Figures it produceth in the Quotient; or see how often 1 is contained in the Divisor, so many times the Quotient is contained in the Dividend, which is all one. If you were to divide 888 pound amongst 4 men, the Question is, what each man must have? Or∣der your Work as in this Example.
The first demand is, how many times 4 can you have in 8? The answer is 2, which 2 place in the Quotient; then multiply the 2 in the Quotient by 4, (the Divisor) and that makes 8; place 8, under the 8 on the lest Figure of the Dividend, and draw a line un∣der it, and subtract 8 from 8, and there remains o. Then take down the next 8, and demand how many times the Divisor is con∣tained in the Dividend (8) which is 2 times; set that 2 in the Quotient, and multiply the Divisor 4 by that 2, which makes 8; set that 8 under the second Figure of the Dividend, and draw a line as before, and subtract it from the 8 in the Dividend, and there re∣mains 0. Proceed in the same manner as you have done with the rest, and you will find 222 in the Quotient, and 0 remains of the Work; so that you see, according to the former Proposition, that 4 the Divisor is contained in 888 (the Dividend) 222 times; and the Quotient is contained in the Divi∣dend, as often as 1 is contained in the Divi∣sor, which is 4 times: So that it appears by the Work, that 888 Pounds being divided between 4 Men, there is 222 Pounds comes to each Mans share.
If 28770 Pounds is to be Divided amongst 84 Men; the Question is, what each man must have? Note that Men is the Divisor, Mo∣ney the Dividend, and Quotient is the Answer. For the first work, say how many times 84 can you have in 28? which cannot be; there∣fore you must find the Divisor in 287, over which last figure always place a Prick, as in the Example: Then say how many times 8 (the first figure in the Divisor) is there in 28, the two first Figures in the Dividend, which is 3 times; which 3 place in the Quotient, and multiply the Quotient by the Divisor, and it makes 252; which place under the prick'd Number, and Subtract it from 287, and there will remain 35: then draw down the next Figure 7, which makes 357, and say, how many times 8 can you have in 35?
which is 4 times; place 4 in the Quotient; then multiply 4 the Quotient by 48 the Di∣visor, makes 336, which place under 357, (as in the work;) then draw a line and subtract, and there rests 21; then take down 0 to the Remainder 21, makes 210; then say, how many times 8 can you have in 21? the Answer is 2; which 2 place in the Quotient, then multiply the 2 by the Divisor, makes 168, which place under 210, as in the Example; then draw a line and subtract it, and there rests 42. So that it appears, that if 28770 Pounds is to be divided amongst 84 men, that there is 342 Pounds comes to each man's share, and 41/4 of a Pound more. Now to know what part of a Pound this or any other Fraction is, after the Remainder of any Division; Observe this Rule. Multiply the Remainder 42 by 20, to bring it into Shillings; then divide it by 48, the Divisor and the Quotient will answer the Question, which in this Example, is 10 Shil∣lings more to each man's share, as appears by the work.
The Rule of Three Direct. IT is called the Rule of Three, because in all Questions in this Rule, you have al∣ways three Terms given to find a fourth. It is called the Rule of Proportion for this reason; see what proportion is be∣tween the first Term and the second, the same proportion is between the third Term and the fourth. It is called the Golden Rule for the Ex∣cellency in its Operations. It is known by At and How It is known by If and What It is known by As and So To work this Rule, you must multiply the second Term by the Third, for the Di∣vidend; and divide the Product by the first, the Quotient will give you the fourth Term demanded. Here Note; That the first and third Number must always be of the same Deno∣mination; As if one be Pounds, Pence, Yards, Tuns, Hours, Men, &c. so re∣spectively must the other be; and the like
is to be understood of the second and the fourth, as in the following Example: If 12 Yards of Karsey cost 3 Pound, what shall 435 Yards cost? Reduce the Shillings into Pounds, by di∣viding the same by 20; and the Answer is 108 Pound, 15 Shillings, the price of 435 Yards.
If 7 Inches Diameter gives 22 Inches in Circumference what Circumference shall 36 Inches Diameter require?
The RƲLE of THREE REVERSE. TO work this Rule, you must multiply the first Term by the second, and di∣vide the Product by the third, and the Quo∣tient will give you the fourth Term de∣manded. If 30 men require 25 Weeks to build a Fort, in how many Weeks will 20 Men build the like?
The Double RƲLE of THREE. IF 600 Pounds weight for 501 Miles Car∣riage, cost 1 l. 6 s. 6d. what shall 2500 Weight cost 100 Miles Carriage? State the Question thus: W Miles l. s. d. W. Miles 600 50 1 6 6 2500 100 To work this, you must first reduce the Money into the lowest Denomination ex∣press'd, which is 318 Pence; then multi∣ply the 2500 by 100, and also by the Num∣ber of Pence: All that Product must be divided by the two first Numbers multi∣plied together (which is the Divisor) to divide the other Product by. When the Operation is done, then you must reduce the Pence into Shillings, and Shillings in∣to Pounds; and in the Conclusion you will find the Answer of the Question to be l. s. d. 11 00 10
Note the Work.
The Work being finished, the Answer of the Question is 11 l. 10 d. the 11 l. is ap∣parent, but the 10 d. is included in the re∣maining Fraction 0416. To find the Value of this Fraction in Pence, multiply the Fraction by 20, cutting off 4 Figures, (be∣cause there is so many in the Fraction.) The Remainder multiply by 12, cutting off still 4 Figures, and there will remain to the Left-hand 10, which is 10 Pence, the va∣lue of the Fraction. The Rule of Three Reverse. THE Reverse, or backward Rule of Three, is to be used when the third Number requires less, or less requires more.
The Rule. Multiply the First Number by the Second, and Divide the Product by the Third, the Quotient will be the Fourth Number sought; which always shall be of the same denomi∣nation with the Second Number. For Instance. If 24 Pionecrs require 16 Months to dig a Moat about a Town, how many Pioneers must there be employed to dig the same Moat in 4 Months? In stating this Question, you must note, That 24, though it be the First named, is not to be the First Number in the work; because the Middle term must always be of the same Denomination with that which is sought; and the Three Numbers put in or∣der stand thus. Months. Pioneers. Months. 16 24 4 Here 'tis plain, less requires more; that is, less time more hands. Therefore it must be wrought by the Re∣verse Rule; and accordingly you may mul∣tiply
24 by 16, and divide the Product by 4, the Quotient will be 96; as doth appear by the work. Which shews that 96 Pioneers must be employed to finish the Moat in 4 Months.
CHAP. II. A COMPENDIUM OF Decimal Arithmetick. Note 1st. Notation of FRACTIONS. Numerators, 5 15 150 1070 Denominators, 10, 100, 1000, 10000. Note 2d. Of how many places soever the Numera∣tor of a Decimal Fraction doth consist, of
so many Cyphers with a Unite before them, do the Donominators consist. So the Denominator of 5 is 10, of 15 is 100, of 005 is 1000, &c. Note 3d. When the Numerator of a Decimal Fra∣ction consists not of so many places as the Denominator hath Cyphers, prefix so many Cyphers on the left hand as is directed in Note 2d. So 5/100 is written thus, 05; 15/1000 is writ thus, 015; 50/10000 thus, 0050; 6/1000 thus, 006. Note 4th. Cyphers at the end of a Decimal Fraction do neither augment nor diminish the value thereof; so that 2. 20. 200. 2000, are De∣clmals of one and the same value: For when the Numerator and Denominator do each end with a Cypher or Cyphers cut off equal Cyphers in both; so will the Fraction be reduc'd into lesser terms, 2 0 10 0 2 00 10 00 2 000 10 000 Thus, 20/100 200/1000 or 2000/10000 Are reduc'd as in the Table.
Note 5th. Cyphers added to the left hand of any Number in Decimals, decrease it ten fold thus 015/1000. Note 6th. To Reduce a Vulgar Fraction to a Decimal. The Rule. To the Numerator of the given Fraction, add what number of Cyphers you please, and Divide it by the Denominator, the Quotient is the Decimal Fraction. Example 1. I desire to know what the Decimal Fra∣ction of Sixteen Shillings is, which in a Vulgar Fraction is 16/20; now you may add to the Numerator 16, what Cyphers you please: Suppose Four, and the work stands as follows,  and the Quotient is 8000 for Decimal Fractions of 16 Shillings.
Example 2d. What is the Decimal of one Peny, which as it is the Fraction of 20 Shillings, (in Vul∣gar Fractions,) it is thus exprest, 1/140. Therefore (as before) add Cyphers to the Numerator 1, and divide by 240, as in this following Example. Note 7th. To reduce a Decimal Fraction hnno a Vulgar. Rule. Let the Fraction be multiplied by 20; (if it be the Fraction of a Pound Ster∣ling,) and the remaining Decimals by 12;
and if any more remain, then multiply by 4, to bring them into Farthings; noting this, that in all your Multiplications, you must observe to cut off so many Figures of your Products as there are Figures in the Decimal Fraction. Example. I would know the quantity of this Fra∣ction, 396875 of a Pound Sterling; pro∣ceed according to the foregoing Rule, and the work will appear as in the following Table to be 11 Shillings, 11 Pence, 1 Far∣thing.
I would know the quantity of this Fra∣ction, 396875 of a Pound Sterling; pro∣ceed according to the foregoing Rule, and the work will appear as in the followin work, to be 7 Shillings, 11 Pence, 1 Fa¦thing. Where you see that I multiply the Fra∣ction by 20, to bring it into Shillings; and that Product by 12, to bring it into Pence; and that Product by 4, to bring it into Farthings.
Addition of Decimals. Note 8th. ADdition of Decimals is the same as with whole Numbers, only you must observe an Order in placing them; (that is,) to place every number under its proper Denomination, whole Numbers under one another, Tenths or Primes under Tenths or Primes, and Seconds under Seconds, &c. distinguishing the whole Numbers from the Fractions by a Point or Comma, and ad∣ding them together as whole Numbers, still setting down the Excess above Ten, and so carrying the Tenths to the next place to∣wards the Left hand. Examples.
Subtraction of Decimals. IN Subtraction of Decimals, observe the same order in placing them, as is di∣rected in Addition; and then subtract the Lesser from the Greater as in the whole Numbers. Note 9th. When the Decimals in both Numbers given, consist not of the same number of Places, that Decimal that is defective in places towards the right hand, must be fil∣led up with Cyphers, or at least supposed to be filled up. Example. Suppose ,47,309 is to be subtracted from 54, you are to put so many Cyphers as will make up the Fraction, and then Subtract, and the work will stand Thus, Or thus, 54,000 38,000 ,47 309 0, 130 07691 37,860
Multiplication of Decimals. Note 10th. IN any of the Cases which can happen in Multiplication of Decimals, multi∣ply the Numbers given, as if they were whole Numbers, then cut off or separate as many Figures from the Product, by a Point or Comma, as there are Fractions Multiplicand, Multiplicator, or both; which Figures so cut off or separated, are the Fraction of the Product. And the Figures toward the left hand of the point or Comma shall be the Integers or whole number of the Product; and if they do not make so many, they are to be supplyed with a Cy∣pher or Cyphers, which may happen when the Product is a Fraction. Example.
Note 11th. In Multiplication of whole Numbers, the Product is always increased so many times more than the Multiplicand as the Multi∣plicator contains Unites, as 5 times 4 make 20: But in Multiplication of Fractions, the Product is always less than either of the two Numbers alone, as in Example the IV, where you see one Number is 75, the Deci∣mal of 15 Shillings, and the other 0125, the Decimal of three Pence; yet the Product of the Multiplication is but the Decimal of 2 Pence Farthing, as you may see if you look forward in the Decimal Table of Pence and Farthings, pag. 46. The Reason is, because 1 being multi∣plied by one, can produce but one; there∣fore that which is less than 1, as (are all proper Fractions,) being Multiplied by that which is less than 1, must needs be dimi∣nished by the Multiplication. And this Di∣minution bears the same Proportion to the Multiplicator, as the Multiplicand beareth to a Unite. For as 15 Shillings the Multiplicand is  of a Pound, so Two Pence Farthing the Product is  of the Multiplicator 3 Pence.
Division of Decimals. Note 12th. IN Division of Decimals, the Dividend must sometimes be prepared, by adding a competent number of Cyphers to make room for the Divisor to find out a Fraction, and for the Reduction of Vulgar Fractions into Decimals. Note 13th. In the whole Doctrine of Decimal Arith∣metick, there is no part so difficult as this of Division, in regard to the variety of o∣peration, in respect of the Quotient, what part of it to cut off in the various Divi∣sions of whole Numbers with Fractions, and Fractions with Fractions, &c. all which varie∣ties shall be solved with this ensuing Rule. A General Rule to know the true value of the Quotient. THere must be so many Figures cut off in the Quotient, as will make those in the Divi∣sor (if any be) equal to the Number of Decimal parts in the Dividend.
Note 14th. If the Quotient doth not consist of as many places as are required by the General Rule to be cut off, you may supply that defect by prefixing a Cypher or Cyphers before the Quotient toward the left hand. Example 1. To Divide a whole Number by a Fraction. Suppose the whole Number to be 82, which is required to be divided by this Fraction, 056, because there is a defect of Figures in the Dividend 82; therefore I add 5 Cyphers thereto, and place them in their due order, and when the work is finished, you will find 6 Figures come in the Quo∣tient. (Now the Question is,) how many of these Figures are proper to be cut off for a Fraction; therefore note, that there being three Decimal Fractions in the Divisor, and 5 in the Dividend, therefore I cut off the last Figures in the Quotient, which being added to the 3 Figures in the Divisor, makes them equal to the Fraction in the Dividend, which is 5 Cyphers; so the ge∣neral
Rule is made good, as you may see in the work. Example 2. To divide a Fraction by a whole Number. Here (according to the 9th Note,) I pre∣fix
a Cypher before the Quotient, there being (after the Division is finished) only Four Figures in the Quotient; so then there are 5 Figures in the Dividend and 5 in the Quotient, according to the general Rule; as you may see in the work.
Example 3. To Divide a whole Number, and a Fraction by a Fraction. Here you see 4 Figures are cut off in the Quotient, which with the 2 in the Divisor, makes 6, which is equal to the Decimal parts in the Dividend; according to the General Rule in pag. 37, aforegoing.
Example 4. To divide a Fraction by a whole Number and a Fraction. Here are 7 Decimals in the Dividend, and when the Division is finished, there are 4 Figures in the Quotient, which with the 2 in the Divisor, makes but 6; Therefore according to the 9th note, I prefix a Cypher before the Quotient on the left hand, and then they are equal.
Example 5. To divide a Fraction by a Fraction. According to the General Rule I cut off 4 Figures to the Right hand in the Quotient, which makes those in the Divisor equal to those in the Divi∣dend. Example 6. To divide a whole Number and a Fraction by a whole Number. Here are only 2 Figures to be separated in the Quotient; there being no Decimals
in the Divisor, and only 2 in the Divi∣dend. Example 7. To Divide a whole Number by a whole Number and a Fraction. There being 7 Decimals in the Divi∣dend, I therefore cut off 5 Figures in the
Quotient, which with the 2 in the Divisor, make 7 according to the General Rule. p. 37. Example 8. To divide a whole Number and a Fraction, by a whole Number and a Fraction. According to Note 9th (in pag. 34,) add Cyphers to the Dividend, and when the work is finished, I find 5 Figures in the Quotient, 3 of which must be cut off, that they may make those of the Divisor 6, equal to the Decimals in the Dividend, according to the Rule.

An Explanation of this Table. The First Column shews the Inches and Eight parts of a Foot, and the Second Co∣lumn shews the Decimal Number answering thereto. Example. Seek for 11 Inches, and 8/4 or a half in the First Collumn, and in the next you will find the Decimal thereof 095833.
CHAP. III. THE EXTRACTION OF THE Square Root. THe Extraction of the Square Root is that by which having a number gi∣ven, another number may be found, which being Multiplied by itself, produceth the number required. Any Square number being given to be Extracted, thus it may be prepared. Ac∣cording to this Rule, put a Point over the first place thereof to the Right hand (being the place of Unites;) then proceeding to∣wards the left hand, pass over the second place, and put a Point over the third place;
also passing over the Fourth place, put ano∣ther Point over the Fifth, and so forward in such manner, that between every Two Points which are next one to another; so that one place may be intermitted accor∣ding to this Example, 630436. Suppose the Square Root of this Number be required; the First Point is to be placed over 6, and the Second over 4, and so of the rest as you see in the Example; and note, that as ma∣ny Points as are placed in that manner, of so many Figures will the Root be. To fit it for operation, draw a crooked Line on the Right hand of the Number propounded for Extraction, then find the Root of the First Square, and place it in the Quotient, which in this Example is found to be 7;  Then Square the Quotient which is 49, and place it under the first Square of the Num∣ber
given, (viz.) 63, and Subtract the 49 from the First Square; and place the Re∣mainder orderly underneath the Line, which is 14, to which Remainder being down, the next Squares of the Number propound∣ed, and place them on the Right hand of the said Remainder; (and may now be cal∣led the Resolvend.) Then double the Root, being the Number placed in the Quotient, which is 14, and place them on the Left hand of the Resolvend (like a Divisor,) parted off with a Crooked Line. Then demand how often that Divisor is contained in the Resolvend, which may be now called the Dividend (proceeding in all respects as you do in Division,) and write the answer in the Quotient on the Right hand of the Divisor; then if you ask how often the Divisor 149 is found in the Di∣vidend 1404, the Answer is 9 times: There∣fore write 9 in the Quotient, and also after the Divisor 14. Then Multiply all the Numbers which stand on the Left hand of the Resolvend, viz. (before the Crooked Line,) and write the Product orderly underneath the Resol∣vend; then having drawn a Line under the said Product, subtract it from the Resol∣vend, and subscribe the Remainder under the Line which is 63: unto which Num∣ber
bring down the remaining Figures of the Resolvend, and then there will be 6336 at the Left hand, of which number draw another Crooked Line; then double the Quotient, which is 158, and set it on the Left hand of the said Crooked Line; then demand how often you may have 158 in 633: the Answer is 4, which 4 must be placed in the Quotient; then multiply that by each Figure of the Divisor, and subscribe the Pro∣duct orderly under the Dividend, and sub∣tract it therefrom, and there remains 16; so the work is finished, and the Square Root of that Number 630436 is 794, and 16 which remains, intimates that the Root is something greater than 794, but less than 795; yet how much greater than 794 is not yet discovered by any Rules of Art. But farther Progress may be made for a nearer discovery of the truth; but in this case it being but a small difference, I shall wave it.
To Extract the Square Root by the Logarithms. The Rule. HAlf the Logarithm of any Number, is the Logarithm of the Square Root thereof. Example. Let the Square Number given be 5625, The Logarithm of 625 is 2,79588 The half thereof is 1,39794 which is the Logarithm of 25, the Root of the said Number. By Gunter's Scale. To Extract the Square Root, is to find a mean proportional Number between I and the Number given; therefore divide the Space between them into Two Equal parts, and that shall be the Root sought.
Example. Let it be required to find the Square Root of 144; Divide the distance betwixt I and 144 equally, and the Compasses will fall on 12, the Root sought. The EXTRACTION of the CƲBE ROOT. THe Extraction of the Cube Root is that by which having a Number gi∣ven, another may be found, which being first Multiplied by itself, and then by the Pro∣duct produceth the Number given. the Extraction of the Cube Root, the ber propounded is always conceived to be a Cubical Number; that is, a certain Number of little Cubes, comprehended within one entire great Cube, so that the Root of any perfect Cubical Number is a Right Line of a Solid Body, containing 6 Equal Sides, which constitutes as many Square Superficies, or a Number Multiplied twice in itself, which in the Solid, hath length, breadth and depth, as may more
plainly appear in this Annexed Cubical Figure. cube A Cube Number is either Single or Com∣pound. A Single Cube Number is that which is produced by the Multiplication of one single Figure, first by itself, and then by the Product, and is always less than 100; so 64 is a single Cube Number produced by the Multiplication of 4, First by itself, and then by the Product as in the Margin. A Compound Cube Number, is when there are Two Figures in the Root.
All the Single Cube Numbers and Square Numbers, together with their respective Roots, are expressed in this Table follow∣ing. Cubes, 1 8 27 64 125 216 343 512 729 1000 Squar. 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 Roots, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 To prepare a Cube Number for Extraction. The Rule. PUt a Point over the First place thereof, towards the Right hand, (viz.) the place of Unites, then passing over the Se∣cond and Third places, put another over the Fourth, and passing over the Fifth and Sixth, put another over the Seventh, al∣ways observing the same order in inter∣mitting Two Places (between every Two Adjacent Points) place as many Points as the Number will permit, as may plainly appear in this Example. Let 1728 be
the Number given, place the Points accor∣ding to this Rule. Which done, draw a Crooked Line on the Right hand of the Number to signify a Quotient; then find the Cube Root of the First Cube which is 1, as you may see in the Table, which 1 set in the Quotient. Then subscribe the Cube of the Root placed in the Quotient, under the First Cube of the Number given, which in this Example is 1.
Then draw a Line under the Cube sub∣scribed aforesaid, and subtract this Cube from the First Cube, and place the Re∣mainder orderly underneath the Line, which in this Example is nothing; to which Re∣mainder, bring down the ne x Cube, which is 728, placing it on the Right hand of the Remainder, which number so placed, may be called the Resolvend; having drawn a Line underneath the Resolvend, Square the Root in the Quotient, that is, multiply it in itself, and subscribe 3 the Triple of the said Square or Product under the Resolvend, and place it under 7, the place of Hun∣dreds. Then Triple the Root or Number in the Quotient, which is 3, and subscribe this Triple Number in such a manner, that the First place thereof, (the place of Unites,) may stand under the Second place, (the place of Tens) in the Resolvend, which Triple is Three which I place under 2: Then the Triple Square of the Root, and the Triple of the Root being so placed, draw a Line under them, and add them together, the Sum is 33 for a Divisor. Then let the whole Resolvend, except the First place thereof towards the Right hand, (viz.) the place of Unites, be esteemed as a Dividend; then demanding how often
the First Figure (towards the Left hand) of the Divisor is contained in the correspon∣dent part of the Dividend, write the An∣swer in the Quotient; for if I ask how many times Three in 7, the Answer is twice, therefore I place 2 in the Quotient. Then draw another Line under the work, and multiply the Triple Square before sub∣scribed (under 7) by the last Figure placed in the Quotient, which is 2, and say, 2 times 3 is 6; which Product I subscribe un∣der the said Triple Square (viz.) under the 3, which stands under the 7, as you may see in the work. Then Multiply the Figure last placed in the Quotient, namely 2, by the Triple Number before subscribed under 2 in the Resolvend; for 2 being multiplied by it∣self, produceth 4, which being multiplied by the Triple Number 3, the Product is 12, which I subscribe with the 1 under 6, and the 2 under 3; as in the work may appear. Then Cube the last Figure in the Quo∣tient which is 8, which place in such man∣ner, that it may stand under the place of Unites in the Resolvend, as you may see in the work. Lastly, Draw a Line under all, and add up the Three last Numbers together in the
same order as they are placed, and the Sum is 728, which being Subtracted from the Resolvend, and there remaineth o; so the Cubic Root is found to be 12. Note when the Sum of the Three last Num∣bers before mentioned, is greater than the Re∣solvend, the work is erronious, and then you may reform it, by placing a Figure less in the Quotient. To Extract the Cube Root by the Logarithms. The Rule. DIvide the Logarithm of the given Num∣ber by 3, so shall you have the Loga∣rithm of the Root required. Example. Let the Cube Number given be 1728 as before, The Logarithm of 1728 is 3,23754 The Third part thereof is 1,07918 which is the Logarithm of 12, the Cube Root required.
Likewise Multiply the Logarithm of any Number by Three, and it produceth the Logarithm of the Cube thereof. To Extract the Cube Root by Gunter's Scale. TO Extract the Cube Root, is to find the First of Two Mean Proportio∣nals between 1, and the Number whose Cube Root you require; therefore you must Divide the space between those Two Numbers into Three equal parts. Example. Let it be required to find the Cube Root of 1728, as before: Divide the distance between 1 and 1728, into Three Equal parts, one Third part of that distance shall reach from 1 to 12, which is the Cube Root required.

To make the Table of Square Roots. The Table of Square Roots is made by Multiplying each Figure into itself; the Product is the Square of the Number required. As for Example in the Root 29, which being Multiplied in itself, produ∣ceth 841, the Square of that Number is 29. To make the Tables of Cubick Roots. The Table of Cubick Roots, are made by Multiplying the Root in itself; and that Product again by the Root, and the last Number is the Cube Number required. As for Example in the Root 12, which being Multiplied in itself, produceth 144, that being Multiplied by 12, produceth 1728, the Cube Number of 12.

In each Page of the Table is contained Six Columns; in the First, the Third and Fifth (towards the Left hand,) are contained all absolute Numbers begin∣ning at 1, and so on by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &c. to 1000; (having the Letter N. at the Head of each Column.)
Then in the Second, Fourth and Sixth Co∣lumn of every Page are contained the Lo∣garithmical Numbers, answering each ab∣solute Number, against which it standeth, and these Columns have at the head of them the word Logar. The Numbers being thus disposed in the several Pages of the Table, it is easie to find the Logarithmical Number that answers there to any absolute Number that shall be required. Or on the contrary, if any Logarithmi∣cal Number be given, it will be easie to find the Absolute Number to which it belong∣eth. For if you find your Absolute Number in any Column of the Table under the Letter N. that Number that standeth in the next Column to it on the Right hand under the Title Logar. is the Logarithmical Num∣ber thereunto belonging. And on the contrary, in what part of the Table soever you find any Logarithmical Number, that Number which standeth in the next Column on the left hand thereof, is the Absolute Number so found. And note further, that all the Logarith∣mical Numbers between 1 and 10, have a Cypher before them; all Numbers between 10 and 100 have the Figure 1 before them; all Numbers between 100 and 1000, have
the Figure 2 before them; which 1 and 2 Figures are called the Characteristiques of those Numbers. And to the end what I have here deli∣vered may be made plain, I shall give exam∣ples thereof in the Two following Propo∣sitions. Prop. 1. Let it be required to find the Logarith∣mical Number belonging to 16; turn to the Table in the First Column of the First Page, where you will find 16, under the Letter N. and right against it towards the Right hand, you shall find this Number, 1,20412, which is the Logarithm thereof. Likewise in the same Page and Column a∣gainst 25, you will find 1,39794, which is the Logarithm thereof. Also you shall (by the same Rule) find that The Logarithm of 4 will be 0,60206 The Logarithm of 51 will be 1,70757 The Logarithm of 321 will be 2,50650 and by the Converse of what is here deliver∣ed, you may find the Absolute Number an∣swering to any given Logarithms as in the following Proposition.
Prop. 2. A Logarithmical Number being given, to find the Absolute Number thereunto belonging. Let it be required to find the Abso∣lute Number belonging to this Logarithm, 1,20412; look in the Table in the First Page thereof, and casting your Eye down among the Numbers, under the word Logar. you will find this Number 16, to stand just against it, on the Left Hand which is the Absolute Number of that Loga∣rithm. The same is to be understood of all o∣ther Numbers comprised in the foregoing Table. Observing this Caution; when you have a Logarithmical Number given, (which when you look for) you cannot find in the Table, you must then take the nearest Num∣ber thereto, and the Absolute Number which stands against it, is the nearest (less) whole Number, which you must take. As for Example. If you have this Logarithmical Num∣ber, 0,63258, which if you look for in the
Table, you cannot find it; therefore you must take the nearest less Number which you will find to be 0,60206; and right against it (on the Left hand), you will find to be 4, the nearest Absolute Number to that Lo∣garithm. Let this suffice for the Description; next follows the Use. The Ʋse of the Table of Logarithms in Arith∣metick, which shall be exemplified in Questions of Multiplication, Division, and the Extract∣ing the Square and Cube Roots, being such parts of Arithmetick which tend wholly to the matter intended in this Treatise; and there∣fore I shall begin with Multiplication. Multiplication by the Loga∣rithms. YOu must add the Logarithms of the Two Numbers, (to be Multiplied to∣gether,) and the Sum of them will be the Logarithm of the Number produced by that Multiplication.
Example. Let it be required to Multiply 48 by 5; First set down the Two Numbers to be Multiplied One under another, and to them set their respective Lo∣garithms, as in the Margin; which being added toge∣ther, the Sum of them (which is the Loga∣rithm of the Product) being sought in the Table, the Absolute Number answering thereto is 240, the Product of those Two Numbers Multiplied together. 48 1,68124 5 0,69897 240 2,38021 Division by the Logarithms. AS Multiplication (by the Logarithms) was performed by Addition, so Di∣vision is performed by Subtraction: Where∣fore to perform Division, you must Subtract the Logarithm of the Number, by which you are to Divide from the Logarithm of the Number, which is to be Divided, and the Number which remains shall be the Logarithm of the Quotient.
Example. Let it be required to Divide 228 by 12; 228.2,35793 12.1,07918 19.1,27875 First set down the Logarithm of 228, and under it set the Logarithm of 12, and Subtract the Lesser from the Greater, the Remainder is the Lo∣garithm of the Quotient; which being sought in the Table, you will find 19 to be the Answer of the Question, being the Quotient sought: And so many times is 12 contained in 228. Of a CIRCLE. 1. The Diameter being given, to find the Circum∣ference by the Logarithms. THe Proportion is as 7 to 22, so is the Diameter to the Circumference. Wherefore to find the Circumference of any Circle, whose Diameter is given, Add the Logarithm of the Diameter given to the Logarithm of 22, and from the Sum of them Subtract the Logarithm of 7, the
Remainder shall be the Logatithm of the Cir∣cumference sought. Example. If the Diameter of a Circle be 113, what is the Circumference? First set down the Logarithm of 22, which is— 1,34242 2,05308 3,39550 0,84510 2,55040 Add the Logarithm of 113 which is from which Subtract the Loga∣rithm of 7, which is— which being sought in the Tables is the nearest Logarithm of 355; and so much is the Circum∣ference of a Circle, whose Dia∣meter is 113. 2. The Circumference of a Circle being given, to find the Diameter. The Proportion is as 22 is to 7; so is the Circumference to the Diameter. Wherefore to the Logarithm of 7, add the Logarithm of the Circumference given, and from the Sum, Subtract the Logarithm of 22, the Remainder shall be the Loga∣rithm of the Diameter.
Example. If the Circumference of a Circle be 355, what is the Diameter thereof? First set down the Logarithm of 7. which is— 0,84510 2,55023 3,39533 1,34242 2,05291 and to it add the Logarithm of 355 from which Subtract the Loga∣rithm of 22— and the Remainder is the nearest Logarithm of 113, — which is the Diameter required. 3. The Diameter of a Circle being given, to find the Area or Superficial Content thereof. The Proportion is as 28 is to 22, so is the Square of the Diameter to the Area. Wherefore to the Logarithm of 22, add the Logarithm of the Diameter doubled, and from the Sum subtract the Logarithm of 28, the Remainder shall be the Logarithm of the Area required. Example. If the Diameter of a Circle be 12, what is the Area or Superficial Content thereof?
First set down the Logarithm of 22, which is — 1,34242 1,07918 1,07918 3,50078 1,44716 2,05362 and to that the Logarithm of 12, the given Diameter, set down— Twice — Add all Three together,— from which Subtract the Loga∣rithm of 28,— The Remainder is the nearest Lo∣garithm to the Number 113, and some small matter more is the Area of that Circle. 4. The Circumference of a Circle being given, to find the Area. The proportion is as 88 is to 7; so is the Square of the Circumference to the Area. Wherefore to the Logarithm of 7, add the Logarithm of the Circumference Twice, and from the Sum Subtract the Logarithm of, 88; the Remainder shall be the Logarithm of the Area required.
Example. If the Circumference of a Circle be 38, what is the Area thereof? First set down the Logarithm of 7, which is 0,84510 To which add the Logarithm of 1,57978 the Circumference Twice. 1,57978 The Sum 4,00466 Subtract the Logarithm of 88, 1,94448 the Remainder is the nearest Lo∣garithm of 115 the Area sought. 2,06018
CHAP. IV. CONTAINING Geometrical Rudiments Useful in the Art of GUNNERY. How to raise a Perpendicular from the middle of a Line given. LEt the Line given be A. B. and let C be a Point therein given, from which it is required to raise a Perpendicu∣lar. First therefore open the Compasses to any convenient distance; and setting one
Foot in the Point C, with the other set off on either side thereof the equal distances C A, and C B; then opening the Com∣passes to any convenient wider distance, setting one Foot in the Point A, with the other strike the Occult Arch at F, geometrical diagram the with the same distance, set one Foot in the Point B, and with the other draw the Arch F, crossing E in the Point D; from whence draw the Line DC, which Line is a Perpendicular unto the given Line A, B, as was required. To let a Perpendicular fall from a Point assigned, to the middle of a Line given. Let the Line given whereupon you would have a Perpendicular let fall, be the Line B C D, and the Point A to be the Point as∣signed
from whence you would have the Perpendicular let fall from the given line B C D; First set one Foot of your Com∣passes in the Point A, and opening them to any convenient distance, so that it be more than the line A C; Describe one Arch of a Circle with the other Foot, so that it may cut the line B C D, twice, that is, at E and at F; geometrical diagram then find the middle between these, which will be the Point C; from which Point draw the line at C, which is the Perpendicular which was to be let fall. To raise a Perpendicular upon the end of a Line given. Suppose the line whereupon you would have the Perpendicular raised, be the line
A B; first open your Compasses to a conve∣nient distance, and set one Foot in the Point B, and let the other Foot fall any where a∣bove the line, as at the Point D; and in that Point, let one Foot of your Compas∣ses remain, turning the other about un∣til it touch the line A B, in the Point E, geometrical diagram then turn the same Foot of the Compasses towards C, and draw an Occult Arch, and lay the Edge of a Ruler to those Two Points E and D, and where the same edge of the Ruler doth cut the Arch C, from that Point draw the line C B, which shall be a Perpen∣dicular at the end of the line A B. To let fall a Perpendicular from a Point assigned, unto the end of a Line given. Let the line A B be given, unto which it is required to let a Perpendicular fall from
the assigned point D unto the end A. First, from the assigned point D, draw a line unto any point of the given line A B, which may be the line D C E; then find the middle of the line D E, which is at C, place one foot of your Compasses in that point, and extend the other foot unto D or E, with which distance draw the Semicircle D A E, which shall cut the given line A B, in the point A, geometrical diagram from which point draw the Line D A, which is the Perpendicular let fall from the assign∣ed point D, on the end of the given line A B, as was required. To draw a Line Parallel to a Line given. Let A B, be a Line given, whereunto it is required to draw a Parallel. First, set
one Foot of the Compasses in the point, C, and opening the other Foot at pleasure, draw the Arch E, then with the same distance set one Foot in the point D, and draw the other Arch F. geometrical diagram Lastly, lay a Rule to the convexities of both those Arches, and draw the line G H, which shall be a Parallel to A B, as was required. A Geometrical Problem useful in the Art of Gunnery. A Geometrical way to find the Diameter of any Bullet that weighteth twice as much as a known Bullet. TAke the Diameter of the lesser Bullet, whose weight you know, and square that Diameter. (viz.) Make a Geometrical
Square, each side to be equal to the Diame∣ter of the Bullet given, then draw a Diago∣tal line from either of the Two opposite Angles, and that Diagonal shall be the Dia∣meter of a Bullet twice the weight of the other; then divide the said Diagonal into Two equal parts, setting one Foot of the Compasses in the midst of that Diagonal, and with the other Foot describe a Circle, and that Circumference will represent a Bullet twice as much weight as the other. The sight of the Annexed Figure, is a sufficient Explanation. geometrical diagram A B is the Diameter of the lesser Bullet A C, the Diameter of the greater.
Performed by Arithmetick. Suppose the Diameter of the lesser Bullet be Five Inches, the Square thereof is Twen∣ty Five, the Double of it is Fifty, the Root thereof is 7 1/7 and so much is the Diameter of the greater Bullet. The weight of any Shot given, to find the Diameter Geometrically. Suppose a Shot be One, Two or Three Pound weight of Metal, or Stone assign∣ed, if one Pound divide the Diameter in∣to Four parts, and Five such parts will make the Diameter of a Shot of the said Metal or Stone, that shall weigh just Two Pound. Divide the Diameter of a Shot weighing just Two Pound in Seven equal parts, and Eight such parts will make a Diameter of a Shot of Three Pound. And divide the Diameter of a Shot of Three Pound into Ten equal parts, and Eleven such maketh a Shot of Four Pound.
Divide the Diameter of a Shot of Four Pound into Thirteen parts, Fourteen such parts will make a Diameter for a Shot of Five Pound. And so dividing each next Diamter in∣to Three equal parts more, the next Lesser was divided into; and it will with one part added from a Diameter of a Shot, that will weigh just one Pound more. So you may proceed infinitely increasing or decreasing, by taking one part less than it is appointed to be divided into.

Arithmetical Problems apper∣taining to the Art of Gun∣nery, and wrought by Deci∣mal Arithmetick, by the Logarithms, and Gunter's Scale. PROB. 1. The Diameter of a Circle being given, to find the Circumference. The Analogy. AS 1 is to the Diameter, so is 3.142 to the Circumference; or as 7 to 22, so is the Diameter to the Circumference.
If the Diameter of a Circle be 15 Inches, what is the Circumference by Gunter's Scale? By the Logarithms. As the Log. of 15 (the Diameter) 1,17609 is to the Logarithm of 3,142 0,49720 so is the Logarithm of 0,00000 to the Logar. of the Answer. 47,13|67329 Extend the Compasses (upon the Line of Numbers) from 1 to the Diameter, the same extent will reach from 3.142 to 47.13 the Circumference. PROB. 2. The Circumference of a Circle being given, to find the Diameter. The Analogy. AS 3,142 is to 1, so is the Circumfe∣rence 47:13 to the Diameter 15 Inches.
If the Circumference of a Circle be 47 Inches, and 13 parts of a 100 (supposing every Inch to be divided into 100 parts,) what is the Diameter? or as 22 to 7, so is the Circum∣ference to the Diameter. By the Logarithms. As the Logarithm of 3,142 0,49720 is to the Logarithm of 1 0,00000 so is the Logarithm of 47.13 1,67329 to the Logar of the Answer.   1,67329   15 1,17609 By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses upon the line of Numbers from 47.13 the Circumference, the same extent, the same way shall reach from 3,142. to the Diameter 15.
PROB. 3. The Diameter of a Circle being given, to find the side of a Square equal to it. If the Diameter of a Circle be 15 Inches, what shall be the side of a Square equal to it? The Analogy. AS 1 is to 15, so this Number 8862 to 13.29 the side of a Square equal in con∣tent to that Circle. By the Logarithms. As the Logarithm 1 0,00000 is to the Logarithm 15 1,17609 so is the Logarithm of 8862 0,94753 to the Answer 13,29 2,12362 By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses from 1 to 8862, the same extent shall reach from 15 to 13.29.
PROB. 4. The Circumference of a Circle being given, to find the side of a Square, equal in content to that Circle. If the Circumference of a Circle be 47, 13, the side of a Square equal to it is required. The Analogy. AS 1 is to 47.13 so is this Number 2821, to 13.29 the side of the Square re∣quired. By the Logarithms. As the Logarithm of 1 0,0000 is to the Logarithm of 4713 0,67329 o is the Logarithm of 2821 0,45040 to the Answer 13,29 1,12369 By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses upon the Line of Numbers from 1 to 2812, the same extent shall reach the same way from 47.13 to 13.29 the side of the Square required.
PROB. 5. The Diameter of any Spherical body being known, to find the Circumference. Let the Diameter of a Bullet be 9 Inches, and the Circumference demanded. The Analogy. AS 1 is to 3,142, so is 9 to 28,28 fere, the Circumference sought. By the Logarithms. The Log. of 3,124—0,49720 Being Added, gives the Log, of 28,28. and the Log. of 9 Inch. 0,95424 Being Added, gives the Log, of 28, 28. 1,4 5144 Log. Required. By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses from 1 to 9, the same extent shall reach from 3,142 to 28,28 Inches the Circumference required.
PROB. 6. The Circumference of any Spherical body being known, to find the Diameter. Let the Circumference of a Bullet be 28,28 Inches, and 28 Hundred parts, the Diame∣ter is required. The Analogy. AS 3.142 is to 1, so is 28,28 to 9 Inches, the Diameter required. By the Logarithms. Log. 28.28 145144 Log. 3,142 049720 Subtracted.   ,95424 Log. 9. Required. By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses upon the Line of Numbers from 3,142 to 1, the same extent the same way shall reach from 28.28 to 9 the Diameter required.
PROB. 7. The Diameter and Circumference of any Spheri∣cal Body being known, to find the Superficial Content? Let the Diameter of a Shot be 9 Inches, and the Circumference 28 Inches and 2800 parts of an Inch, how many Square Inches is there contained on the Superficies of that Shot. The Analogy. AS 1 is to 9 Inches the Diameter, so is 28,28 the Circumference to the Super∣ficies 254,5. So that there is contained in the Super∣ficies of the same Bullet 254 Inches and an half. By the Logarithms. Log. 9. 95424 Log. 28,28 145144 S. 254,512-40568 Log. Required.
By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses from 1, to 28 28 on the Line of Numbers, the same extent the same way shall reach from 9 to 254,5, the Superficial Content required. Or else by knowing the Diameter, work thus; Extend the Compasses from 1 to 81, the Square of the Diameter, and the same extent will reach from this Number 3, 142, to 254, 5 the Superficial content as before. PROB. 8. The Axis or Diameter of a Globical body being known, to find the Solid Content. If the Diameter of a Shot be 9 Inches, what is the Solid Content in Square Cubical Inches? ☞ The Rule for this and the like Questions is this; as the Diameter is to the Cube itself, so is 11 to the Solid Content. The Analogy. AS the Diameter 9 is to the Cube thereof 729, so is 11 to the Solid Content in Cubical Inches.
By the Logarithms. As Logar. 9 0,95424 is to Logar. 729 2,86272 so is Logar. 11 1,04139 to the Cubical Content. 3,90411   891 2,94987 Log. found. By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses from 9 to 11, the same extent shall reach from 729 to 891, the Cubical Inches contained in that Bullet, or the extent from 1 to the Diameter, being thrice repeated from. 5238, will reach the Solid Content required. PROB. 9. The Diameter of a Bullet being given with the weight, to find the weight of another Bullet of the same Metal, but of another Diameter, either greater or lesser. Let there be propounded an Iron Bullet of 4 Inches Diameter, weighing 9 Pound, and let the Question be put to know what ano∣ther
Bullet (of the same Metal) will weigh that is of 8 Inches Diameter. The Analogy. AS the Cube of 4 the First Diameter which is 64, is to 9 l. so is the Cube of 8 the last Diameter, which is 512, to 72 l. the weight required. By the Logarithms. The Rule. Triple the difference of the Logarithms which belong to the Two Terms, which have the same denomination; then if the First Term be less than the Second, add that Sum to the Logarithm of the other Term: so you shall have the Logarithm of the 4th Term desired. Diameter 4 Inches, Logar. 0,60206 Diameter for 8 Inches, Logar. 0,90309 Difference, 30103 Difference tripled 0,90309 Weight given 9 l. Logar. 0,95424 Weight required 72 l. Logar. 1,85735
By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses from 4 to 8, the same extent from 9 thrice repeated, will reach to 72, the Answer required. So if a Bullet of 4 Inches Diameter weigh 4 l, a Bullet of 6 Inches Diameter, shall weigh 30 l, and a Bullet of 7 Inches Diame∣ter shall weigh 47 . l, and a Bullet of 3 In∣ches Diameter, shall weigh 4 l. But here it is necessary to shew what Proportions there are between several Metals used for this purpose; as of Brass, Iron, Lead and Stone, according to the best Approved Authors. 1. The proportion between Lead and Iron, is as 2 to 3; so that a Leaden Bullet of 3 Pound weight, is equal in Diameter with an Iron Bullet of 2 Pound weight. 2. The proportion between Iron and Stone, is as 3 to 8; therefore a Stone of 6 Pound weight is equal in bigness to a piece of Iron of 16 Pound weight. 3. The proportion between Lead and Stone, is as 4 to 1; so that a Bullet of Lead of Eight Pound, and a Stone Bullet of Two Pounds, are equal in Diameter.
4. The proportion between Iron and Brass, is as 16 to 18; and the proportion between Lead and Brass, is as 24 to 19. And here note, that some Stone is heavier than other, and so likewise of Metals, the finer they are, the heavier they be, being of the same magnitude. PROB. 10. Having the weight of a Bullet of one kind of Metal, to find the weight of a Bullet of another kind of Metal, being equal in magnitude. Example. If a Leaden Bullet weigh 106 Pounds, what will a Bullet of Marble weigh? By the Third Rule aforegoing, it is found that a Bullet of Lead to the Bullet of Stone, bears such proportion as 4 to 1.
The Analogy. AS 4 ∶ 1 ∷ 106 ∷ 26,5. Performed by the Logarithms. The Logarithm of 106 is ,02530 The Logarithm of 4 is ,60206 The Logarithm of 26,5 found 42324 By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses upon the Line of Numbers from 4 to 1, the same extent from 106 shall reach the same way to 26,5 the weight of a Stone Bullet that is equal in bigness to that Leaden one of 106 Pound. On the contrary, having the weight of a Stone Bullet, to find the weight of a Lea∣den Bullet of the same magnitude; extend the Compasses from 1 to 4, the same extent shall reach from 26,5 to 106.
PROB. 11. A Bullet of Iron that weigheth 72 Pound, what will a Bullet of Lead weigh that is equal to it in bigness? The Analogy. AS ∶ 2 ∷ 3 ∷ 72 ∷ 108. By the Logarithms. Logarithm 2, 30103 Logarithm 3, ,47713 Logarithm 72, ,85733   1,33476 Logarithm 108, 03343 By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses from 2 to 3, on the Line of Numbers, the same extent shall reach from 72 to 108 the weight sought. But if the weight of the Leaden Bullet be given, (viz.) 108, then to get the weight of the Iron Bullet.
Extend the Compasses from 3 to 2, the same extent shall reach from 108 to 72, the weight of the Irom Bullet. PROB. 12. The Diameter and Weight of any one Cylinder or Piece of great Ordnance taken at the Base Ring being known, to find the weight of any other piece of the same Metal and Shape, either greater or lesser, its Diameter being only known. As for Example. If a Brass Saker whose Diameter is 11,5 In∣ches, what will another Piece weigh, whose Diameter is 8,75 Inches? By Arithmetick. The Analogy. AS 11,5 is to 1900 ∷ so is 8,75 to almost 8,37.
By the Logarithms. As the Log. greatest Diam. 11,5 306069 The Log. of the least, 8,75 294200 Difference Increasing   11869 Multiplyed by   3 Produceth this difference   35607 Which being Subtracted from the Logarithm of the weight given, 1900   327853 There remains the Log. 837   2,92245 By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses from 11,5 to 8,75, the same distance will reach from the weight given, 1900 Pound being thrice repeated to 837 Pound, If a Piece of Ordnance of 4 Inches Dia∣meter weigh 1600 Pound, what will ano∣ther Piece weigh, being of the same shape and metal of 2 Inches Diameter? Answer, 200 Pound.
PROB. 13. Having the Diameter and weight of any Piece of great Ordnance of one Metal, to find the weight of another Piece of Ord∣nance of another Metal that is of the same shape. In this Problem there will be required a double o∣peration to find out its weight. Example. Let there be a Brass Piece of Ordnance of 11,5 Inches Diameter at the Base Ring, weighing 1900 Pound (as before,) and let the Question be to find the weight of an Iron Piece of Ordnance of the same shape; viz. 8,75 Inches Diameter. In this and the like cases, you must in the First place find the weight of the Piece 8,75 Inches Diameter, as in the last Theorem, as if it were a Brass Piece; and having found the weight to be 837 Pound, you must next seek the proportional Numbers, as in Page 116, at the latter end of the Ninth Problem, whose proportion is there found to be as 16 to 18, which is the proportion between
Brass and Iron, Brass being the heavier Metal. Therefore having found the weight, The Analogy is AS 18 is to 16, so is 837 to 744. By the Logarithms. Log. of 18   1,25527 Log. of 16   1,20412     ,92272   Sum ,12684 Log. found, 744 ,87157 By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses from 18 to 16, the same extent, the same way shall reach from 837 to 744.
PROB. 14. To find the Superficial Content of the Convex face of any Piece of Ordnance, and also of the Solid Content of the Concavity thereof. Suppose the Circumference of the Conca∣vity be 22 Inches, and the length of it 12 Foot, or 144 Inches, the Question is, what is the Superficial Content of the Convex face, or what the Solid Content of the Con∣cave Bore. For the Superficies the Analogy is, AS 1 ∶ 22 ∷ 144 ∶ 3168, Square In∣ches. By the Logarithms. Logarithm 22 ,34242 Logarithm 144 ,15836 Logar. found, 3168 ,50078
By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses from 1 to 22, on the Line of Numbers, the same extent, the same way shall reach from 144, to 3168, the Square Inches required. To find the Solid Content. First get the Semidiameter, which in this Example is 3, 5 Inches, and also the Semi∣cumference, which here is 11, these be∣ing had, The Analogy is thus; AS 1 is to 3.5 ∷ 11 ∶ 38,5. So many Square Inches are contained in the Base or Plain of the Concavity of the Mouth. By the Logarithms. Logarithm 35 54407 Logarithm 11 04139 Logarithm 38,5 58546
By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses from 1 to 3, 5 the Diameter of the Concave assumed, the same extent will reach the same way from 11 to 38,5, the Base of the Cylinder required. The Base of the Cylinder being thus found, to find the Solidity of the Cylinder. The Analogy. AS 1 is to 38,5 (the Area of the Base of the Cylinder,) so is the length of the Cylinder 144 Inches to 5544 Cubical Inches. By the Logarithms. Logarithm 385 ,58546 Logarithm 144 ,15836 Logarithm 5544 ,74382 By Gunter's Scale. Extend the Compasses on the Line of Numbers, from 1 to 38,5, the same extent, the same way shall reach from 144 to 5544.
PROB. 15. To know how much of every kind of Metal is contained in any Brass Piece of Ordnance. If the proportions of Metals used by Gun∣founders is supposed to be thus, that for e∣very 100 Pound of Copper, to put in 10 Pound of Brass, and 8 Pound of Pure Tin; now supposing this Mixture to be true, let it be required how much of every sort of these Metals is in a Gun of 5600 Pound weight. For Answer to this and the like Questions, first joyn all the several mixtures together, that 100, 10, and 8, and this must be the First Number in the Rule of Proporti∣on; the weight of the Piece, the Second Number, which here is 5600, and the Third Number is each several sort of Me∣tal in the mixture, which is here 100, 10, and 8.
The Operation. The Sum of the common Mixtures are 118. And then the Analogies are thus, As 118 is to 5600,         100 Copper,         10 Latten,         8 Tin. So is 100 4745,7 Copper,   So is 10 474,6 Brass,   So is 8 379,7 Tin. 118 Analogy for the Copper is, As 118 to 5600, so is 100 to 4745,7 Copper. Analogy for Brass. As 118 to 5600, so is 10 to 474,6 fere, Brass.
Analogy for Tin. As 118 to 5600, so is 8 to 379, 7 fere Tin. Which Three Sums thus found, 4745,7 474,6 379,7 56000 being added toge∣ther, they make, the just weight of the piece pro∣pounded. By the Logarithms. The Proportions are thus wrought. For the Copper. Logarithm 118 071882 Logarithm 5600 748188 Logarithm 100 000000     748188 Log. found, 474,57 676306 Here you are referred to a larger Table of Lo∣garithms, than is in this Book, for this opera∣tion and the next following.
For Brass. Logarithm 118 071882 Logarithm 5600 748188 Logarithm 10 000000     748188 Logarithm found, 474,57 676306 For Tin.

Extend the Compasses from 118 (upon the Line of Numbers) to 5600, the same
extent, the same way, shall reach from 100 to 4745,7. For Brass. Extend the Compasses from 118 to 5600, the same extent shall reach from 10, to 4746, being one place less than the former. For Tin. Extend the Compasses from 118 to 5600, the same Extent, the same way shall reach from 8 to 379,7. PROB. 16. By knowing what quantity of Powder will load some one Piece of Ordnance, to find how much of the same Powder will load any other Piece of Ordnance, Greater or Lesser. Example. If a Saker of 3,75 Inches Diameter in the Bore requires Four Pound of Powder for its Load, what will a Demy Cannon of 6, 5 In∣ches Diameter in the Bore require?
The Analogy. AS 4,75 is to 4, so is 6, 5 to 20  fore. ☞ But note, that it is here under∣stood, that the Demy-Cannon ought to be as well Fortified as the Saker is; (viz.) it should bear the same proportion to the Saker, both in weight and thickness of Metal that the Bore thereof beareth to the Saker; for the Demy-Cannon in this Example, ought to be 8351 Pounds, which would be of a Proportion to the Saker, to carry a proportional weight of Powder. But if the Demy-Cannon be found to want of its proportional weight with the Saker, as if it weigh but 6000 Pounds, then to find its due load in Powder answerable to its strength and weight of Metal, Multiply the weight thereof 6000 by 20,8 the Charge already calculated, and divide the Product by 8351, the weight it ought to have had, and the Quotient is 14,9; there∣fore 14,9 Founds is a sufficient Charge for such a Gun.

One Example of the use of the foregoing Table is sufficient, which shall be of the Saker Ordinary, where you will find the Diameter of the Bore to be 3 Inches and  of an Inch, the length of the Piece to be 9 Foot, the weight of the Piece 1500 Pound the breadth of the Ladle to be 6 Inches  of an Inch, and the length of the Ladle to be 10 Inches and , of which is half an Inch, and the weight of Powder to Charge that Piece is 4 Pounds, the Diame∣ter of the Shot to be 3 Inches , which is 3 Inches and , the weight of the Shot to be 6 Pound, and that the Piece shoots point blank 160 Geometrical Paces.
CHAP. VI. Of the Different Fortifications of most Pieces of Ordnance. THere are Three Degrees used in Fortifying each sort of Ordnance, both Cannons and Culverings. First, Such as are ordinarily Fortified are called Legitimate Pieces. Secondly, Such whose Fortification is les∣sened, are therefore called Bastara Pieces. Thirdly, Those that are Extraordinary Pieces, are called Double Fortified. The Fortification is reckoned by the thickness of the Metal at the Touch-hole, at the Trunnions, and at the Muzzle, in proportion to the Diameter of the Bore. The Cannons double Fortified, have full one Diameter of the Bore, in thickness of
Metal at the Touch-hole, and  at the Trunnions, and in their Muzzle . The Lessened Cannons have at their Touch-hole ¾ or 12/16 of the Diameter of their Bore, in thickness of Metal, and  at the Trunnions, and  at the Muzzle. The Ordinary Fortified Cannons have 7/8 at the Touch-hole, 5/ at the Trunnions, and 3/ at the Muzzle. All the Double Fortified Culverings, and all Lesser Pieces of that kind, have 1 Diame∣ter, and  at the Touch-hole,  at the Trun∣nions, and 9/16 at the Muzzle. The Ordinnary Fortified Culverings are Fortified every way as your Double For∣tified Cannons; and the Lessened Culve∣rings as the Ordinary Cannons in all points.
CHAP. VII. How much Powder is fit for Proof, and what for Action for any Piece of Ordnance. FOR Cannons 4/ of the weight of the Iron Shot for Proof, but for Ser∣vice, half the weight of the Shot is enough, especially for Iron Ordnance, which will not endure so much Powder as Brass Guns by one quarter. For Culverings their whole weight of their Shot for proof, and for Service 2/, for the Saker and Falcon 4/ of the weight of their Shot. And for Lesser Pieces, the whole weight of the Shot may be used in Service, till they grow hot, for then you must abate by discretion.
For proof these Lesser Pieces, you may take one, and ⅓ of the weight of the Shot, therein also must be respect had to the strength and goodness of the Powder, which is to be ordinary Corn Powder. To make Ladles to Load your Guns with. THe Ladles ought to be so proportioned for every Gun, that Two Ladles full of Powder may Charge the Piece; which in General Terms is thus. The breadth of all Ladles are to be Two Diameters of the Shot, that so a Third may be left open for the Powder to fall freely out of the Ladle, when you turn it bottom upwards; the length of the Ladles must be somewhat different, according as the Piece is Fortified. For Double Fortified Cannons, the length of the Ladle may be Two Diameters and One half of their Shot, besides so much as is necessary to fasten it to the Head of the Ladle-Staff, which will require One Diameter more of Plate; (but this is not reckoned to the length of the Ladle, be∣cause it holds no Powder. For Ordinary Can∣nons
the Ladle must not exceed Two Dia∣meters of their Shot in length. For Culverings and Demy-Culverings, the Ladle may be Three Diameters of their Shot, and Three and a half for Lesser Guns to load them at Twice. If you would load them at once, you must double the length of the Ladle. ☞ Observe this for a General Rule, that a Ladle Nine Balls in length, and Two Balls in breadth, will hold the just weight of the Shot in Powder. But note, that Iron Ordnance must have but Three Quarters of the Charge of Brass Ordnance.
CHAP. VIII. To know what Bullet is fit to be used for any Gun. IT is convenient that the Bullet be some∣what less than the Bore of the Gun; that it may have vent in the Dis∣charge, and not stick and break the Piece. Now some think one Quarter of an Inch less than the Bore, will serve for all Guns, but this vent is too little for a Cannon, and too much for a Falcon. It is more Rational and Artificial to di∣vide the Bore of the Gun into Twenty equal parts, and let the Diameter of the Bullet be Nineteen of those parts, accor∣ding to which proportion the Table afore∣going, in page 137 is Calculated.
To make Cartridges, Moulds and Formers for any sort of Ord∣nance. THe matter of which Cartridges a made, are either Canvas or Paper Roy∣al, either of which being prepared, take the height of the Bore of the Piece, and let the piece of Cloth or Paper be Three times the Diameter of the Bore or Chamber of the Piece for the Breadth, and for the length according as your Piece is; (that is to say,) for the Cannon the length of the Cartridge must be Three Diameters, in the length for Culverins, Saker, Falcons, &c. Four Diame∣ters, leaving at the top or bottom one Dia∣meter more for the bottom of the Cartridge, cutting each side somewhat larger for the sewing and glewing them together, having a due respect for the augmenting or dimi∣nishing of your Powder, according to the goodness or badness thereof, and to the ex∣traordinary over-heating of your Piece; and according to what you are to have your Car∣tridges made, you must have a Former of Wood turned to the height of the Shot, and a convenient length longer than the Car∣tridge;
before you paste or glew your Paper on the former, first tallow it, so will the Canvass or Paper slip off with∣out starting or tearing; if you make Car∣tridges for Taper-bored Guns, your for∣mer must be accordingly tapered; if you make your Cartridges of Canvass, allow one Inch for the Seams, but of Paper  of an Inch, more than your 3 Diameters for past∣ing; when your Cartridges are upon the former, having a bottom ready fitted, you must past the bottom close and hard round about, then let them be well dryed, and mark every one with black or red Lead, or Ink, how high they ought to be filled: And if you have no Scales nor Weights, these Diameters of Bullets make a reason∣able Charge; for the Cannon two and a quarter, for the Culvering 3, and for the Saker 3 and a half, for the lesser Pieces 3 and a quarter of the Diameter of the Bullet, and let some want of their weight against the time they are over-hot, or else you endanger your self and others.
CHAP. IX. Containing certain THEOREMS IN GUNNERY. THEOREM I. THere are Three material causes of the greater violence of any Shot made out of a great Gun, viz. the Powder, the Piece, and the weight of the Bullet.
THEOREM II. Powder is compounded of Three Princi∣ples or Elements, Salt-Petre, Sulphur and Coal, whereof it is that which causeth the greater violence. THEOREM III. Although Salt-Petre be indeed the only and most material cause of the violence, and that Powder is made more forcible, where∣in is the greater quantity of Petre; and of those forementioned Ingredients, there is a certain proportion to be used, as to ren∣der it the most fit for Service upon several considerations; of which more hereafter. THEOREM IV. Although Powder is the principal and efficient cause of the Force and violence of any Shot, yet such due consideration ought to be had to the proportions therein used in the Art of Gunnery, as giving more or less than the due proportion, it may diminish the force of the Shot.
THEOREM V. There is such a convenient weight to be found of the Bullet, in respect of the Pow∣der and Piece, as the Bullets Metals being heavier or lighter than that weight, shall rather hinder than farther the violence of the range of the Shot. THEOREM VI. There is such a convenient Proportion to be found for the Length of every Piece to its Bore, or the Diameter of the Bullet, in respect of the Powder and weight of the Ball; as either increasing or diminishing that Proportion, it shall abate or hinder the violence of the Shot. THEOREM VII. Besides these three most material Causes of violence, the several Randoms or dif∣ferent Mountures of Pieces will cause a great Alteration, not only in the far shooting of all Pieces, but also of their violent Bat∣tery.
THEOREM VIII. Besides these aforementioned, there are many other accidental Alterations which may happen, (especially at Sea,) sometimes by reason of the Wind, the Rarity or Con∣densation of the Air, the heating or cool∣ing of the Piece; The different charging by ramming the Powder fast or loose, by close or loose lying of the Bullet; By the unequal recoil of the Piece, or by reason of the Ship being upon a Tack, and the Gun standing on the wind-ward or Lee-ward side of the Ship, or by the uneven lying of the Piece in the Carriage, with divers such like Accidents, whereof no certain Rules can be prescribed to reduce those uncertain Differences to any certain Proportions: but all these by Practice, Experience and a good judgment are to be performed. THEOREM IX. Any Piece being mounted 90 degrees a∣bove the Horizon directly to the Zenith, the violent Motion, (being in that situa∣tion directly opposite to the Natural) car∣ries the Bullet in a perfect right-line dire∣ctly upward, till the form of the violence
is spent, and the natural Motion gotten the victory; then doth the Bullet return down again by the same perpendicular Line. THEOREM X. But if any Piece is discharged upon any Angle of Mounture; although the vio∣lent Motion contend to carry the Bullet directly by the Diagonal Line, yet as the natural Motion prevails, it constrains it to a Curvity; and in these two Motions is made that mixt Compound or Helical Curvity. And here note, that although the last de∣clining Line of the Bullets Circuit seemeth to approach somewhat to the Nature of a right Line; yet it is indeed Helical, and mixt so long as there remaineth any part of the violent motion; but after that is spent, then his motion is absolutely perpendicular to the Horizon. From whence may be collected this Corro∣lary, That any Piece being mounted to any degree of Random, shall make the Horizon∣tal range proportional to the Degree of Elevation, of which you have a Resemblance in the Annexed Scheme, Plate I. Any Piece therefore discharged at any Mounture or Random, first throweth forth
her Bullet directly to a certain distance, called the Point-blank Range, and then af∣terward maketh a Curve, or declining Arch, and lastly finisheth in a direct Line, or nigh inclining towards it; therefore the farther any Piece shooteth in her direct Line (commonly called Point-blank) the more force she hath in the Execution; and the more ponderous the Bullet is, the more it shaketh in battery, although it pierceth not so deep. THEOREM XI. The utmost Random of any Piece of Ord∣nance, is generally judged to be at 45 De∣grees of Elevation; and if you mount your Piece to a greater Angle, the Random of the Bullet will be shorter; and to know the right Range of most Pieces, you may see in this annexed Table, as the Title may inform you, where you may see the Horizontal Range or Point blank, and the utmost Ran∣dom of each respective Piece, the latter be∣ing commonly ten times the distance of the right Ranges.

CHAP. X. Necessary Instructions for a Sea-Gunner. 1. THE First thing is, that when a Gunner cometh into a new Ship, that he diligently and carefully measure his Guns, to know they are full fortified, be reinforced or lessened in Me∣tal. 2. Then he must with a Ladle and Spunge, draw and make clean all his Guns within, that there may be no old Powder, Stones, Iron, or any thing that may do harm. 3. That he search all the Guns within, to see if they are taper Chamber'd, or true bored, or whether they be Crack'd, Flaw'd, or Honey comb'd within; and finding what Ball she shoots, to mark the Weight of the Ball over the Port; that thereby he may
see the Mark or Number upon the Carriage and Case; so that in time of service they may not go wrong. 4. The Guns being dimensioned and clean as aforesaid, take half a Ladle of Powder for every Gnn, and blow them off, spunge them well; and finding them clean, you may load them with their respective Car∣tridges and Powder, they being ramm'd home with a strait Wadd after it. Then let the Ball role home to the Wadd, and set a Wadd close home to the Ball, that the Ball may not roul out with the motion and tumbling of the Ship. Then must you Tomkin that Piece at the Muzzle, with a wooden Tomkin, which you must tallow round about, to preserve the Powder from wetting. Likewise make a little Tapon of Ockam for the Touch-hole, which must be tallow∣ed also, to prevent any wet coming to the Powder that way; then let your leaden A∣pron be put over it; then make your Piece fast, as occasion presents. 5. The Piece being loaded and fast, then provide to every Piece 24 Cartridges at least, ready made; that is to say, 12 fill'd, and 12 empty. Likewise you must be careful, so long as the Gunner's Crew are busie with the Pow∣der,
that there be no burning Match or Fire in the Ship; Also to lay his Cartridges in Barrels or Chests, that when there is occa∣sion to use them, they may be without a∣buse. 6. The Gunner must see that he sorts his Ball very well, and lay every sort by them∣selves in several Cases; and upon every Case set the Weight of one of the Shot, which is in them. Also you ought to make the Bags for Hail for the Guns above, and fill them with Stones, small Shot, or Pieces of old Iron, which may be a great annoyance to the Enemies Men. 7. If it falls out that any new Ports must be cut out in the Ship, you must be care∣ful that it be made over a Beam, or as near one as possible you can; Also that they be not higher or lower than the Ports be∣fore; likewise that there be room for the Guns to play, because if one Gun be dis∣mounted, there might be another brought to her place: And observe that the Car∣riage stand on her Trucks. The up∣permost part of the Carriage must stand in the middle of the Port, up and down, that a Man may lay his Piece as you please. 8. You must be careful that the Powder in the Powder-Room be well covered
with Hides: And also that the Ropes, Ram∣mers, and Spunges be ready at hand. And you must not let the Powder be unturned above a Month, because the Salt-Petre will be apt to sink to the lower part of the Barrel, which would be dangerous to make use of that Powder; And you must every Month draw your Guns; if you think they have got any wetness or moisture in the Powder; Also for fear of the Salt Petre dis∣solving, which may prejudice the Piece. You must also be careful of the Candle and Fire about the Gun Room, and espe∣cially the Powder Room, that there may come no disafter. Likewise a Gunner must keep a good Account of all Materials that belong to the Guns, as Ball, Match, and Powder. What part thereof he spends, also what remains. 9. A Gunner must use all diligence be∣fore they engage with an Enemy, to set a Barrel of Water betwixt every two Guns, that when they have conveniency they may dip the Spunges for the cooling of the Guns, and for fear of Fire remaining in the Piece, which may do hurt. 10. Also you must be sure that there be no melted Fire-works done in the Ship, but ashore; for it is dangerous, and a great ha∣zard to the Ship, and Goods; and Men's Lives may thereby be destroyed.
Also that in time of service, no Fire∣works be brought up in the Round-house, or great Cabbin, to stand, for fear of Shot coming from the Enemy may fire it, and so destroy the Ship. But rather to have them kept below in the Powder-Room, or Stew∣ard-Room, to prevent Danger. 11. Necessaries that a Gunner ought to have for his Ordnance, and the quantity thereof according to the Length of the Voyage, the Quantity and Quality of his Guns. Also if you go in a Man of War, or a Merchant-man, then there is difference of Provisions; only I will here name them all that belong to a Sea Gunner, that he may take such a Proportion of each, as the oc∣cusion may require, and at the End of the Voyage to give an Account what Stores are spent, and what there is yet remaining. Gunners Stores. Powder and Match. Round-shot of every sort. Double-headed Shot. Cut Iron of a Foot, or a Fcot and a half long.
Wooden Tomkins for each sort of Gun. Cartridge-Paper and Glew. Threed, Needles, Twine and Starch. Mallets, Handspikes, Rammer heads. Worms, Ladles, Spunge-heads, & Spunge∣staves, Beds and Quoins of several sorts. Old Shrouds for Breeching, and twice lay'd Stuff for Tackles. Lashers, double and single Blocks, new Rope for double Tackles. Some old Shrouds for Spunges, some Lines, Marline, Tarr'd Twine, Port-Ropes. Moulds for Cartridges for each fort of Gun, Axle-Trees and Trucks. Pouch-Barrels and Linstocks, Crows, Splice-Irons, Primes, Staples and Rings, Tackle-Hooks, Nails, Thimbles, Port-Bands, Sheet-Lead and Leaden-shot, old Canvass, Scales and Weights. Lanthorns, Muscovia-Lights with a large Bottom to put Water in, to prevent dan∣ger from the Sparks of the Candle flying upon the Powder-dust, that may get into the Lanthorn, Dark-Lanthorns, Powder-Measures, Sope, Powder-Horns, Priming-Irons, Nippers, Plyers, Moulds to cast leaden Bullets. And for Instruments such as follow, which every Gunner of a Ship ought to be fur∣nished withal.
Callaper Compasses large and small, for taking the Diameters of the Base Ring, Bo∣dy or Muzzle of a Gun, and the Diameters of Shot. A New Rule called the Sea-Gun∣ners Rule, whose use is shewed at the End of this Book. Brass Heights for Shot. A Gunners Scale and Quadrant. Brass Compasses with Steel-points, Which Instruments, and any other be∣longing to the Art of Navigation you may be furnished with, by John Seller, at the Hermitage in Wapping; with all sorts of Books, and Maritime Charts, and Atlasses, for any of the known Parts of the World.
CHAP. XI. Shewing an Easie way to dispart a Piece of Ordnance. FIrst take the Diameter of the Piece upon the thickest Part, at the Breech of the Gun, with a Pair of Callaber Compasses, and see upon the Quadrant of your Callabers, how many Inches that is; the half of which Diameter take between a Pair of Compasses, and put that distance off upon a Sheet of Cartridge-Paper, which will make two Points upon the Paper, as A and B; then take the Diameter of the thickest part with your Callabers, and see how many Inches that Diameter is, And take the half thereof between your Com∣passes, and set one Foot in A, and the other Point in C upon the said Line AB, at C.
Then take the Distance from C, to B, on the Line, and that is the true Dispart of the Piece; and if you take a Stick or Straw of that length, and set on the Muz∣zle fastned with Wax, it will be a true Dispart for that Piece.
CHAP. XII. To Level a Piece of Ordnance to shoot Point-Blank. TO shoot Point-Blank is to be un∣derstood, that when the Cylender of the Piece lyeth level with the Horizon, so that the Ruler of the Gun∣ners Quadrant being put into the Mouth of the Piece, the Line and Plummet hangeth Perpendicular, then that Piece lyeth in its true Position, to shoot Point Blank. And to make a good shot at a Mark, within Point-blank reach of the Piece, The Piece lying in that Position, as is before shewn; then set up your Dispart upon the Muzzle; then if you put your Eye down to the highest part of the base Ring (as you took the Diameter of) and bring the top of the Dispart in a righe-line, with the
Object at a Distance, that ought to be of the same Heighth from the Horizon at your Breech of the Gun and the Dispart, then is your Sight or visual Line also parallel to the Horizon, and if there be nothing de∣fective in the Piece or Carriage, you will make a good Shot. But if you intend to elevate your Piece, discharge it of some of the Quoins at the Breech, and by your Quadrant applyed to the Muzzle, you may elevate the Piece to what Angle you please; as may be perfor∣med by the New Sea Gunners Rule, whose Use is shewn at the latter End of this Book.
CHAP. XIII. How to search a Piece of Ordnance, to discover whether there be any Flaws, Cracks or Hony-combs in the Piece. IN a clear Sun-shiny-day, take a Piece of Looking-glass, and reflect the Beams of the Sun into the Cavity of the Piece, by the means of which a clear Light will appear within the Piece, by which you may discover any Flaw or Honey-Comb therein. Another Way. Take a long Stick with a slit at the End of it, and put an End of Candle lighted, and put it into the Cylender, turning the
Stick every way; and you may very well dis∣cover Flaws or Honey-Combs, if there be any in the Piece. Another Way to discover Cracks. Immediatly after you have discharg'd your Piece, let one be ready with a Tom∣kin to clap into the Mouth of the Piece, with a Piece of Sheep-skin wrapped about the Muzzle of the Piece, and the same time let one stop the Touch-hole; and if there be any Crack through the Metal a visible Smoak will appear. Another Way. If you strike a Piece of Ordnance with a smart stroke, with a Hammer on the Out∣side, and if you hear a hoarse sound, it is an evident Sign the Piece is not sound, but there is some Crack in it. But if after every stroak with the Ham∣mer you hear a clear sound, you may cer∣tainly conclude the Piece to be sound.
CHAP. XIV. How Moulds, Formers and Car∣tridges are to be made for any sort of Ordnance. CArtridges are usually made of Can∣vass, or Royal Paper; to make them first take the heighth of the Bore of the Piece, and allow 1/21 part of the Diameter for the Vent, and make the breadth of the Cartridges three Diameters of the Chamber of the Piece, besides the sewing or pasting, and from the Cannon to the whole Culvering is allowed about two Diameters for the length, from the Culve∣ring to the Minion, the Cartridge is two Diameters and a half, and from the Minion to the Base three Diameters.
To every sort of Ordnance you must have a Former turn'd to the heighth of the Cartridge, which is 1/ parts of the Di∣ameter of the Bore, and half an Inch lon∣ger than the Cartridge. Before you paste the Paper on the For∣mer, tallow it, that the Canvass or Paper may slip off, without starting or tearing. If you make your Cartridges for Taper∣bored Guns, your Former must be Ta∣per'd accordingly; if you make your Car∣tridges of Canvass, allow an Inch for the Seams, but if you make them of Paper, al∣low ¾ of an Inch (more than three Dia∣meters) for the pasting. When your Cartridges are upon the For∣mer, having a Bottom ready fitted, you must paste the Bottom close and hard round about; then let them be well dried, and mark every one with black or red Lead, or Blacking, how high they ought to be filled; and if you have no Scales nor Weights, these Diameters of the Bullets make a rea∣sonable Charge for a Cannon, 2 and ¼ for a Cannon, three Diameters for a Culvering, and 3½ for the Saker; And for the lesser Pieces 3 and ¾ of the Diameter of the Ball, and let some want of their weight against the time the Piece may be over-hot, or else you may endanger your self and o∣thers:
Note that at Sea the Guns are never charged with a Ladle, but with Car∣tridges. CHAP. XV. How much Rope will make Britch∣ings and Tackles for any Piece. IN Ships that carry Guns, the most ex∣perienced Gunners take this Rule; look how many Foot your Piece is in length, four times so much is the length of your Tackle, and your Britchings twice the length; and if the Ropes are suspected of strength, then you may nail down Quoins to the four Trucks of heavy Guns, that they may have no play; and if Breechings and Tackles should give way in foul Wea∣ther, it is best immediacely to dismount your Gun; that is the surest way.
What Powder is allowed for Proof, and what for Action. FOR the biggest sort of Pieces, as Can∣non, take for Proof ⅘ of the weight of the Iron-shot, or for service ½ the weight, for the Culvering almost the weight of the Shot for Proof and for Action; for the Saker and Falcon, take for Proof the weight of the Shot, and for Action 4/, and for les∣ser Pieces the whole Weight of the Shot for service; and for Proof give them one, and  of the Weight of the Ball in Pow∣der.
CHAP. XVI. How to know what Diameter every Shot must be of, to fit any Piece of Ordnance. DIvide the Bore of the Piece into twenty equal Parts, and one of these Parts is sufficient vent for a∣ny Piece, the rest of the nineteen Parts must be the heighth of the Shot: But most Gunners now-a-days allow the Shot to be just one quarter of an Inch lower than the Bore of the Piece, which rule makes the Shot too big for a Cannon, and too little for a Faulcon; but if the Mouth of the Piece be grown rounder than the rest of the Cylender within by often shooting; to choose a Shot for such a Piece, you must
try with several Rammer-heads, until you find the Diameter of the Bore in that Place where the Shot useth to lye in the Piece, and a Shot of one twentieth part lower than that Place, is sufficient. Every Gunner ought to try his Piece, whether it be not wider in the Mouth than the rest of the Chase, and then proceed to chuse his Shot. To tertiate a Piece of Ordnance. This word Tertiate is a Term principal∣ly used by foreign Gunners, meaning there∣by only the measuring and examining the Fortification of Metals in a Piece, tertiating; because it is chiefly to be measured and ex∣amined in three principal Parts of a Piece, Viz. at the Breech, the Trunions and the Mouth: And there are three Differences in Fortification of each sort of Ordnance, ei∣ther Cannon or Calverings, for they are either double fortified, ordinary fortified or lessened, as Legitimate, Bastard, or ex∣traordinary Pieces: For the Cannon double fortified or re-inforced, hath fully one Dia∣meter of the Bore in Thickness of Metal at her Touch-hole, and 11/16 at the Trunions, and 7/16 at her Muzzle; and the ordinary Can∣nons
have ⅞, at the Chamber ⅝, at the Trunions 3/ The lessened Cannons have ¼ at the Chamber, and 9/16 at the Trunions, at the Muzzle 5/16, &c. Now that every Gunner may be assu∣red of the Fortitude of any Piece of Ord∣nance, and so may the more safely and boldly allow her a due Loading and Pro∣portion of Powder, both for Proof and Service, that she may without danger per∣form her utmost Execution, you may ob∣serve this following Direction: As for Example. Suppose there is a Culvering that shoot∣eth an Iron-shot of 17 l, with 13 l. of Corn-Powder, which is ⅘ of the Weight of the Shot; the Question is, whether she may be able to bear so much Powder, and if need were, more which question cannot be well answered without examining or tertiating her Metal, which may be thus performed. First with a Ruler draw a Line upon a Paper or Slate, as you may see in the an∣nexed Figure, as the Line AB. Then with a Pair of Compasses with re∣versed Points, take the Circumference of the Bore of the Piece, and Measure the same upon an Inch-Rule.
Then take the same Measure from any other Scale of equal parts of a competent size, and divide that distance into two e∣qual parts with your Compasses, and ha∣ving that distance in your Compasses, set one foot in the Point C, and describe the circle DEFG, which circle is equal to the bore of the Piece. Then with a pair of Calaber Compasses, take the Thickness or Diameter of the
Metal at the Touch hole, and Measure the same upon a rule as before, and take that distance between your Compasses, and with half that distance setting one Foot in the point E describe the circle HIKL, which shall represent the circumference of the Me∣tal at the Touch-hole, so that you may take the Compasses and Measure the Diameter of the bore GE, which is equal to the distance of LG or EI which shews, that there is one Diameter of Metal round the Concave Cylinder of the Piece; you may therefore be sure that it is an ordinary for∣tified Culvering; but to know if it be a Bastard, or extraordinary Gulvering, it cannot be known by the fortification but by the length thereof, being longer than ordi∣nary, it is therefore called an extraordina∣ry Culvering, and being shorter than the ordinary, it is therefore called a Bastard Culvering. Now this being found to be an ordinary Culvering, she will bear 4/ of the weight of her shot in Cannon Powder, which is 13 l. 9 ounces. But to be more assured of her fortitude, the measure of her Metal may be taken at her Trunions and Neck as followeth. At the cornishing before her Trunions, with a pair of Calaber Compasses, you
may take the Diameter of the body of her Metal there, as you did before at the Touch∣hole, and measure the same Diameter upon a rule, then take your Compasses and from the same scale as you did use before, take that distance and divide it in two equal parts, and setting one Foot of the Compas∣ses in C describe the circle M N, and if found ⅞ of the bore, it is the proportional fortification for an ordinary Culvering, and the like may be done with the Neck which the circle OP doth represent, and the distance from G to O being  of the height of her bore, and is the due thickness of her Metal, for an ordinary Culvering at her Neck. But if in taking the measures aforesaid there had been found at the Touch-hole from G to L (the thickness of one Diame∣ter at the bore, and ⅛ more, it would have signified that it had been a double fortified or a reinforced Piece, having also at the Trunions GM , and at the Neck GO  of the height of her bore, then she shooting an Iron shot of 17 l. would have en∣dur'd 17 l. of Cannon Corn Powder to be loaded with, and to be fired without dan∣ger, and would conveyed the shot further than the ordinary could have done upon the like degrees of Mounture.
Contrariwise, if the Circles there had been found that from G to L had been but ⅞ of the height of her bore at the Touch∣hole, and at her Trunions but ¾ which is G M, and at the Neck from G to O but 7/8 , of the height of the bore, then she would appear to be one of the lessened or slender fortified Culverings, and must be allowed but 12 pound 9 ounces of Cannon Corn Pow∣der, to convey her shot of 17 l. which upon like elevation will not carry a shot as far as the ordinary. In this manner all other Guns are to be measured and tertiated only with this allow∣ance withal that the Demy Culvering hath 1/24 and the Saker 1/23 and the Falcon  more Metal comparatively than the whole Culvering hath. And if a Piece is found that it is not truly bor'd, you must always reckon that the Piece is no otherwise fortified than she is found to be, where her Metal is found to be thinest.
How to make a Shot out of one Ship unto another in any Wea∣ther whatsoever. IN time of service when you are on a suddain to make a Shot at a Ship, and know not what dispart will serve the Piece, then you must take your aim at what part of the Ship you judge to do most exe∣cution, and look along by the side of the Piece, as near as you may at the middle of the Breech unto the middle of the Mouth of the Piece, and so place her to the best advantage, and quoin up the tayl of the Piece fast (for that giveth the true height of the mark) Then minding the steeridge take your best opportunity and give fire, and if the Sea be any thing grown, choose your Piece that is nearest the Main-Mast and in the lower Teer, if the Ship can keep her Ports open, for there she doth least la∣bour; and when you are to make a Shot at a Ship, you must be sure to have a good Helms-Man that can steer steady. And he that giveth level must lay his Piece directly with that part of the Ship that he doth mean to shoot at. And if the
Enemy be to Leeward of you, then give fire when the Ship doth begin to ascend or rife upon a Sea, which is the best oppor∣tunity that doth present. But if the Enemy is on the weather-gage of you, then wait an opportunity when the Ships do right themselves; for if you should give fire at the heelding of your Ship, then you would shoot over the other Ship; and if the Sea be high, there is no better time to give fire than when your Enemies Ship begins to rise on the top of a Sea, for then you have a better mark than when she is in the trough of the Sea: All which several obser∣vations must be managed, with a good judgment and discretion of the Gunner. And he that is at the Helm must be Yare-Handed with the Helm, to observe the motion of the Enemy, to luff when the Enemy luffs, and to bear up when the Ene∣my bears up; and it is always good to level the Piece rather under the place you shoot at than over. And if in a fight, if you intend to lay your Enemy, aboard then call up your Company either to enter or defend. And if you are resolved to enter, then be sure to level your Bases or other small Guns ready to discharge to the best advantage you can at the first boarding, at such a
place where his Men have most recourse, and if you can possibly, at boarding endea∣vour to take off his Rudder by a great shot, or at his Main Mast &c. In what Order to place your great great Guns in Ships. IT is first to be considered that the car∣riage be made in such sort that the Piece may lie right in the middle of the Port, and that the Trucks or Wheels are not too high, for if they are too high, then it will keep the carriage, that it will not go close to the Ships side, so that by that means the Gun will not go far enough out of the Port, except the Piece be of a great length; and also if the Ships heelds that way, the Trucks will always run close to the Ships side, so that if you have occasion to make a shot, you shall not bring the Trucks off the Ships side, but that will run too again; and the Wheel or Trucks being too high, it is not a small thing will stay it, but will run over it. And another inconveniency is, if the Trucks are too high, it will cause the Piece to have a greater reverse or recoyl, therefore
for these reasons it is good to have low Wheels or Trucks to a Gun aboard of a Ship. The best position that the Gun can be in is, to place it in the very midst of the Port, that is to say, that the Piece lying level at point blank, and the Ship to be upright without any heelding, that it be as many Inches from the lower side of that Port beneath, as it is upon the upper part above; and the deeper or higher the Ports are up and down, it is the better for making of a shot, for the heelding of a Ship, whether it be on the Lee or Weather side; for if you have occasion to shoot forward or back∣ward, the steeridge of the Ship will serve the turn. It is also very bad to have the Orlope or Deck too low under the Port, for then the Carriage must be made very high, which is very inconvenient in several res∣pects, for in firing the Piece it is apt to overthrow, as also in the working and la∣bouring of the Ship in foul weather. And also you have consideration in pla∣cing your Ordinance in a Ship, for the shortest Ordinance is best to be placed out of the Ships side, for several reasons. 1. For the ease of the Ship, for the shorter they are the lighter, and if the
Ship should heel with the bearing of a Sail, then you must shut the Ports, especi∣ally those Guns on the lower deck; then the shorter the Piece is, the easier it is to be taken in both for the shortness and weight also. 2. In like manner, the shorter the Piece lyeth out of the Ships side, the less it shall annoy them in the tackling of the Ships Sails, for if the Piece lyeth far out the Sheets, Tacks or Bowlines, it will be apt to be foul of the Guns. For your long Guns they are best to be placed in the Gun-Room or any place, after on for a Stern-Chase, for two Reasons. 1. The Piece had need to be long, or else it will not go far enough out that it may be no annoyance to the works of the Stern that may over-hang, and so may blow away the Counter of the Ships Stern. 2. The Pieces that are placed abaft, are required to be long, because of the raking of the Ships Stern from below, so that the Carriages cannot come so near the Ports as they do by the Ships side, which is more up and down. Also for such like Reasons as these, it is as well required to have long Pices to be placed forward or in the Fore-Castle, &c.
And here note that there must be regard had to the making of the Carriages, both for Forward-on or After-on for the places of the foremost trucks, in taking notice if the Ships side do tumble in or out, and al∣so the cumbering of the Deck or Orlope; in all these cases it must be left to a good judgment and experience, in the convenient placing of Guns in a Ship. How much Rope will make Breechings and Tackles for Guns. For the Tackles. YOU may observe this Rule, that as many Feet as your Piece is in length, so many Fathom must your Rope be. For the Breechings. They must always be four times the length of the Piece with some overplus for fast∣ning at both ends. If in foul weather your Breechings and Tackies should give way, you have no better way for the present
to prevent danger, than immediately to dismount the Piece. It is also approved by able Gunners, that the Rammers and Spunges made with small Hawser should be armed close and hard with strong and twisted Yarn, from the Rammers end quite to the Spunge, which would much stiffen and make it more use∣ful and lasting to ram both Wad and Bullet close to the Powder. Let the head of the Rammers be of good Wood, and the heighth one Diameter, and ¾ thereof in length, or very little less then the heighth of the shot next the Staff; it must be turned small that a ferril of Brass may be put thereon, to save the head from cleaving; when you ram home the shot, the heads must be bored ½, for the Staff to be put in and fastned with a Pin through, and the Staff∣length a foot more then the concave of the Gun.
CHAP. XVII. Of Powder. Several things necessary to be known by a Gunner; but espe∣cially of Powder. THE efficient cause for expelling the Shot is the Fire that is made of Powder, that is compounded of Salt-Petre, Brimstone and Charcoal. The Salt-Petre gives the Blow or Report. The Sulphur takes Fire, and the Coal rarifies the other two, to make them Fire the better. Two sorts of Gun-Powder are common∣ly in use. One is made of five Parts of Salt-Petre, one of Brimstone, and one part of Char∣coal.
The other (being stronger) is made of six one and one. That of five one and one is generally used for great Guns, the other for Muskets and small Arms. And it hath been generally observed, that forty two pound of Powder of five one and one, is stronger than forty five pound of four one and one; and forty pound of six one and one works greater effect, than for∣ty two pound of five one and one, although all contain thirty pound of Salt-Petre. Anciently they made Powder of four one and one; but this Powder by experience being sound too weak, is not now in use. That Powder which at this day is re∣ceived into their Majesties Magazine at the Tower of London, is made of six one and one. To know good Powder. 1. The harder the Corns are in feeling, by so much the better it is. 2. When the Powder is of a fair Azure or French Russet colour, is it judged to be a very good sort and to have all its Ingredi∣ents well wrought, and the Petre to be well refined.
3. Lay five or six Corns upon a white piece of Paper three fingers distance one from another, then fire one, and if the Powder is good they will all fire at once and leave nothing but a white chalky co∣lour on the Paper; neither will the Paper be toucht: But if there remains a grossness of Brimstone and Petre, it discovers the Powder to be bad. And take this for a general Rule, for a sign of good Powder; that which gives fire soonest, smoaks least, and leaves least sign behind it, is the best sort of Gun-Pow∣der. To preserve Powder from decaying. To preserve good Powder, Gunners ought to have that reason to keep their Store in as dry a place that can be had in the Ship, and every Fortnight or three Weeks to turn all the Barrels and Cartridges upside down, so that the Petre may be dispersed to every part alike; for if it stands long, the Petre will always descend downwards, and if it be not well shak'd and moved, it will want of its strength at the top, and 1 l. at bottom with long standing will be stronger then 3 at the top.
To find the Experimental Weight of Powder (Tower-Proof) that is found convenient for Service, to be used in Guns of several Fortifications (or thickness) and by consequence strength of Metal. TO find the strength of Guns the brief Rule is thus, First find the Diameter of the bore (or Chamber of the Gun) where the shot lies, then the true fortified Iron Guns ought to be 11 of those Dia∣meters in the circumference of the Gun at the Touch-hole, 9 at the Trunions, and 7 at the Neck, a little behind the Mouth or Muzzle-ring where the dispart is set. But Brass Guns having the same weight of Powder are as strong at nine Diame∣ters of the Chamber bore about the Gun at the Touch-hole, and seven Diameters at the Trunions, and five at the Neck.
This is the Rule of true bored and true fortified Guns; and for those more or less fortified, observe the Proportions in this following Table.   Brass   Iron More Fortified 11 Diameters 13 More Fortified 12 Diameters 14 True Fortified 9 Diameters 11 Less Fortified 8 Diameters 10 Less Fortified 7 Diameters 9 Weight of Powder for Service is pro∣portioned by the Numbers of Diameters of the Bore about the Gun at the Touch∣hole, for such Guns so qualified as in the foregoing Table, viz. and to load them accordingly. To know whether the Trunions of any Gun are placed right. Measure the length of the Cylender from the Muzzle to the Britch, and divide the Length by 7, and divide the Quotient by 3, and the Product will shew how many the Trunions must stand from the bottom of the bore of the Piece, and that they ought to be placed so that ⅓ of the Piece may be seen above the Center of the Trunions.
The Practical way of making Gun-Powder. The Essential Ingredients for making Gun-Powder are three, viz. Salt-Petre, Brimstone and Charcoal, and of these there are to be three several quantities and pro∣portions, according to the use intended for; and for the best Powder that is now made, there is commonly used these proportions. Salt-Petre, 4, 5, 6 Parts. Brimstone, 1 Part. Charcoal, 1 Part. The Cannon Powder hath commonly of Salt-Petre four times so much as of Brim∣stone and Charcoal, and for Musket Pow∣der it is usually made five times as much Salt-Petre as of Brimstone and Coal. Now having the Proportional quantity of each of these Ingredients, put all the Salt-Petre together into a Caldron, and boyl it with so much Water as will serve to dis∣solve it with; being so dissolved, it ought to be washed and lay'd upon a clean place; this done, beat the quantity of Coal into dust, then put this Charcoal dust being finely bea∣ten
into the disolved Petre, and incorpo∣rate them very well together, and as you mingle them, put in by little and little the Sulpher very well beaten; when this mix∣ture of Salt-Petre Brimstone and Coal are well incorporated, lay it forth to dry a little; when the same mixture is somewhat dryed and is very well mixed, sift it well through a Sieve; then casting Water or Vinegar up∣on it, corn it, and when you have so done, dry it against the Fire and the Gun-Pow∣der is made: There are divers ways to grind Gun-Powder; the best way is to stamp it in Mortars with a Horse-mill or Water-mill, for the Powder is thereby most finely bea∣ten and with least labour; and to know if it be well done, you may with a Knife cut in pieces some of this Composition, and if it appear all black it is well done, but if any of the Brimstone or Petre is seen, it is not incorporated enough. The manner to fift Powder is thus, Prepare a Sieve with a bottom of thick Vellom or Parchment, made full of round holes, then moysten the Powder which shall be corned with Water, put a little Bowl into the Sieve, then fift the Powder so as the Bowl rowling up and down in the Sieve may break the clods of Powder, and make it by runding through the little holes to corn.
To Renew and make good again any sort of Gun-Powder, ha∣ving lost its Strength by moist∣ure, long lying, or by any other means. Having moistned the said Gun-Powder with Vinegar or fair Water, beat it well in a Mortar, then sift it through a Sieve or fine Searce; for every l. of Gun-Powder mingle one Ounce of Salt-Petre that hath been pulverised, and when you have so done beat and moisten this mixture again, until by so breaking or cutting with a Knife, there is no sign of Salt-Petre or Brim∣stone in it: Also corn this Powder when it is incorporated with the Petre, as it ought to be, and you have done.
CHAP. XVIII. How to make Hand-Granadoes to be Hove by Hand. THere is good use made of Hand-Gran∣adoes in Assaults and Boarding of Ships; these are made upon a Mould made with Twine, and covered over with Cart∣ridge Paper and Musket Bullets cut in two, put with Past and bits of Paper thick on the out-side. After you have doubled the Shells, past on some at a time, and let it dry, and put some more until it be quite full; then dip it in scalding Rossen or Pitch and hang it up and it is for your use: But you must have the innermost end of the Twine left out, and before you pitch it you must draw out the Twine and stop the hole, and then pitch it.
To load them, fill these Shells with Gun-Powder, then make a Fuze of one pound of Gun-Powder and six Ounces of Salt-Petre and one of Charcoal, and fill the Fuze; then knock it up to the head within one quarter of an inch, which is only to find it by night. Stop the rest of the holes well with soft Wax; your first Shells must be coated with Pitch and Hurds lest it should break with the fall; and be sure when you have fired the Fuze, suddenly cast it out of your hand, and it will do good execution. CHAP. XIX. How to make Fire-Pots of Clay. FIre-Pots and Balls to throw out of Mens hands may be made of Potters-Clay with Ears to hang lighted Matches to them; if they light on a hard thing they break and the Matches fire the Powder, and the half Musket Bullets contrived on them, as in the last Chapter, disperse and do much mischief. Their mixture is of Powder, Petre, Sul∣pher,
Sal Armoniack of each one pound, and four Ounces of Camphire pounded and searced and mixt well together, with hot Pitch, Linseed Oyl or Oyl of Petre; prove it first by burning a small quantity, and if it be too slow add more Powder, or if it be too quick then put more Oyl or Rosin, and then it is for your use. SECT. I. How to make Powder-Chests. You must nail two Boards together like the ridge of a House, and prepare one Board longer and broader for the bottom: Between these three Boards put a Cartridge of Pow∣der, then make it up like a Sea-Chest and fill it with pibble Stones, Nails, Stubbs of old Iron; then nail on the Cover and the ends to the Deck, in such a place as you may fire the Powder underneath through a hole made to put a Pistol in: These are ve∣ry useful to anoy an Enemy if they board you. To make Stink-Balls. Take Gun-Powder 10 l. of black Pitch 6 l. of Tarr 20 l. Salt-Petre 8l. Sulpher
Calafornia 4 l. melt these over a soft Fire to∣gether, and being well melted put 2 l. of Cole dust of the Filings of Horses Hoofs 6 l. Assa Faetida 3 l. Sagapenum 1 l Spatula Faetida half a l. Incorporate them well toge∣ther and put into this matter so prepared old Linnen or Woollen Cloath, or Hemp or Tow as much as will drink up all this mat∣ter, and of these make them up in Balls of what bigness you please, and being thrown between Decks will be a great annoyance to the Enemy. CHAP. XX. The Properties Office, and Duty of a Sea-Gunner. 1. A Gunner ought to be a sober, wake∣ful, lusty, patient, prudent and quick Spirited Man; he ought also to have a good eye-sight and a good judgment in the time of service, so to plant his Piece to do most hurt or execution, either to the Hull or rigging of a Ship, as may be most expe∣dient according to the appoinment of the Commander.
2. A Gunner ought to be skilful in Arith∣metick and Geometry, in the making of all kind of Artificial Fire-Works, especially for service. 3. A Gunner ought to procure with all his power the Friendship and Love of every Person, and to take great care of his charge for his own safety as well as the Ship and all the Mens lives, by having special regard un∣to his Powder Room and to be well satisfied in the carefulness of those that he doth in∣trust to manage the business there, and to see that the Yeoman is careful always to keep a good and large Lanthorn, and to be kept whole, that it may prevent the flying in of the dust of the Powder, for the neg∣lect of which it hath sometimes been con∣jectured that some Ships have been blown up and lost for want of care in the Powder Room. 4. A Gunner ought at the receipt of his charge, to make an Inventory of all such things as shall be committed to him, as well to render an account as to consider the want of such Materials as are necessary to the well performance of his duty. 5. A Gunner ought to have his Gun-Room always ready furnished with all ne∣cessaries belonging to his Art, which ought al∣ways to be in readiness, viz. Ladles, Ram∣mers,
Spunges, Gun-Powder, Balls, Tam∣kins, Wadds, Chain-shot, Cross-bar-shot, Quoins, Crows, Tackles, Breechings, Pow∣der-Horns, Canvass, and Paper for Cart∣ridges, Forms for Ladles, Cartridges, Need∣les and Threed to sow and bind the Cart∣ridges, Candles, Lanthorns, Handspikes, Poleaxes, little Hand-Baskets, Glew and Past, with a sufficient Crew of able and ex∣pert Seamen, being yare-handed to travers a Piece, to Charge, Discharge, Mount, Wadd, Ram, make Clean, Spunge, and Prime and Scoure, and readily to do and perform any thing belonging to the Practical Part of Gunnery. 6. A Gunner ought always to have a Ru∣ler about him, and a pair of Compasses, and Callabers to measure the heighth and length of every part of his concavity, and the length depth and wideness of every Ladle whereby he may know whether his Piece is laden with too much Powder, or is charged with a less quantity than it ought to have. 7. A Gunner ought to know the length and weight of all manner of Pieces, and be able to give an account readily how much Powder is a due charge for every Piece, and how ma∣ny times a Piece may be shot off without harm, and how each kind of Piece should be charged with the Powder, Tamkin, Ball and Wadd.
8. A Gunner also must be skilful to make Salt-Petre, to refine and sublime Salt-Petre, to make divers sorts of Gun-Powder to purifie Brimstone, to amend any sort of Powder when it hath lost its vertue and force, and to know how much Salt-Petre ought to be put to the said unserviceable Powder, and to make it strong as it was before, and how many times the Salt-Petre that is put into the Powder ought to be refined. 9. A Gunner that serves at Sea must be careful to see that all their great Ordance be fast breeched, and that all the furniture be handsome and in a readiness as was said be∣fore, and that they are circumspect about their Powder in the time of service, and to have an especial care of the Linstocks and Candles for fear of their Powder and their Fire-works, and the Oacum, which is very dangerous, and to keep your Pieces (as neer as you can within): And also that you keep their Touch-holes clean without any kind of dross falling in them; and it is good for the Gunner to view his Pieces and to know their perfect dispart, and to mark it upon the Piece or else in a Book or Table, and name every Piece what it is and where she doth lie in the Ship, and note how many inches halfs and quarters of inches the dispart cometh unto.

AN APPENDIX, Shewing the Use of a Proportional Scale In several Questions in ARITHMETICK, In Lineal, Quadratick and Cubi cal Proportions, in the Mensu∣ration of Superficies and Solids, and the Extraction of the Square and Cube-Root. The Figure of which Scale is annexed to the Front of this Page. As also the use of a New Rule, called the Sea-Ganners-Rule, con∣taining an Epitome of the Art of Gunnery in it self. By John Seller. London, Printed in the Year, 1691.
CHAP. I. A Description of the Proportional Scale and its Ʋse in the Art of Gunnery. THere are three Lines upon the Scale, One for Lineal, Proportions. One for Quadratick, Proportions. One for Cubical, Proportions. The uppermost Line is for the Resolutions of all Lineal Proportions, between Num∣bers Lines and Superficies, this Line being a single Line of Numbers which is broken in the midst and laid side by side, for the great∣er facility in their Operations. The second or middlemost is for the Re∣solution of all Quadratick Proportions, be∣tween Lines and Superficies and the ex∣traction
of the Square Root, several of which Questions may be answered by inspection only. The third and lowest Line is for the Re∣solutions of all Cubical Proportions between Numbers, Lines and Solids, and the ex∣traction of the Cubick Root. Numeration on the Lines. PROP. I. A whole number consisting of two, three or four places, being given, to find the point on the Scale representing the same. The upper Line (that is for Lineal Pro∣portion) in two parts (i. e.) a line of Num∣bers broken and put side by side, the upper Line begins at 1, and if that be called one then the next figure must be called 2, and the next 3 and so to 10; but if you call the first 1, 10 then the next figure 2 you must call 20, the next 30, and so to 100. And if you call the first 1, 100 then the next is 200, and the next 300, and so to the furthest 10, and that will be a thousand, and all the other intermediate Divisions are the tenth parts of Integers. The same way of
Numeration as is explained in this is to be understood of all the rest of the Lines. Example 1. I would find the Number 25 on the Rule, I call the first 1, 10 and the second figure 20, and tell 5 tenths more which are also Inti∣gers, where you will find a long stroke and that is 25. Note that every fifth of the grand inter∣mediate Divisions, are drawn forth with a longer Line than the rest, for ease of count∣ing. Example 2. Let it be required to find the place of 144 upon the upper Line, call the first 1 upon your Line 100 for your first figure 1, then for 40 tell 4 of the grand Divisions for your second figure, and for the third figure which is 4 count four of the small intermediate Divisions, that very point is the place upon the Line representing 144. Example 3. Let it be required to find the place of 1690, for your first figure 1, count the 1 at the beginning to be 1000 for your second
figure 6 count 6 of the grand Divisions which is 600, and for 90 count 9 tenths more which is the very point representing 1690. Note by these examples you may perceive that the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. do sometimes signifie themselves alone, some∣times 10, 20, 30. &c. sometimes 100, 200, 300, &c. as the works thereby doth re∣quire. And by this varation and change of the Powers of these Numbers from 1 to 10 or 100 or 1000, any proportion either Arith∣metically or Geometrically may be wrought; one, whereof I will insert for your better exercising on the Scale, by the often pract∣ice whereof you will find the work facile and delightful, which shall be this follow∣ing. PROP. II. Having two Numbers given, to find as many more as you please which shall be in continual proportion one to another as the two numbers were
For the working this Proposition, this is the Rule. Place one foot of the Compasses in the first given Number, on the upper line, and extend the other foot to the other given Number; then may you turn from that se∣cond Number, to a third, to a fourth, (as far as you can go on the upper line) then to a fifth, sixth, if the rule will admit. Example. Let the too given Numbers be 2 and 4, place one foot of your Compasses on 2, and extend the other foot to 4, that foot which now standeth in 2, being turned over will reach to 8, and so far it will come upon the up∣per line; then bring it to 8 in the lower line, and turn the Compasses from 8 to 16, and from 16 in the upper line to 32, and from 32 to 64, and from 64 to 128, to 256 to 512 in the upper line, and so you may pro∣ceed until you come to 4096. Again let the 2 Numbers be 10, and 12, which you will find in the lower line, and that Extent will reach from 12 to 1, 4, 4, and from thence to 17, 28.
But if the Numbers were 1 and 12, which you must find on the lower line, then the third proportional will be 144, and the fourth 1728, and all with the same extent of the Compasses. CHAP. II. Multiplication by the Proportional Scale. IN Multiplication the Proportion is this: As 1 upon the line is to one of the Num∣bers to be Multiplied, so is the other Num∣ber to be Multiplied to the Product of them, which is the Number sought. Example. 1. Let it be required to Multiply 5 by 7, the Proportion is as 1 to 5, so is 7 to 35. Therefore set one Foot of the Compasses in 1, in the lower line and extend the other Foot to 5, with that extent of the Compasses, place one Foot in 7, and the other Foot will fall on 35, which is the Product, (which is performed on the lower line) by extending
from 1 in the middle of the Line to 5 back∣wards, the same extent the same way will reach from 7 to 35, the Product required. Example. 2. Let it be required to Multiply 34 by 9, the Proportion is, as 1 is to 9, so is 34 to 306, set one Foot of the Compassess (in the low∣er Line) from 1 or 10, in the middle, to 9 the same extent, will reach from 34 to 306. Otherwise set one Foot in 1, and extend the other to 34, the same extent from 9 shall reach to 306. Example. 3. Let it be required to Multiply 8, 75/100 by 6, 45/100 the Proportion is as 1 to 8, 75, so is 6, 45, to 56, 48, set one Foot (in the lower Line) from 1 to 8, 75, the same extent the same way will reach from 6,45, to 56,44, fere. Or if you set one Foot in 1, and extend the other to 6, 45, the same extent shall reach from 8,75, to 56,44 almost, or 56¾.
CHAP. III. Division by the Proportional Scale. IN Division there are 3 things to be taken notice of, viz. The Dividend, or Number to be Divided. Divisor, the Number by which the Divi∣dend is to be divided. Quotient, which is the Number sought. And as often as the Divisor is contained in the Dividend so often doth the Quotient con∣tain Unity. For the working of Division this is the Analo∣gy or Proportion. As the Divisor, is to Unity or 1, so is the Dividend to the Quotient. Example. 1. Let it be required to divide 35 by 7, The Proportion is as 7 to 1, so 35 to 5; set
one Foot of the Compasses in 7, (in the lower Line) and extend the other Foot to 1, that same extent will reach from 35 to 5, which is the Quotient: otherwise extend the Compasses from 7 to 35, that same extent will reach from 1 to 5. Example. 2. Let it be required to Divide 34 by 306, the Proportion is, as 34 is to 1, so is 306 to 9; extend the Compasses from 34 to 1, (in the lower Line) the same extent the same way, will reach from 306 to 9 which is the Quotient; or if you extend the Com∣passes from 34 to 306, the same extent shall reach from 1 to 9. Example. 3. Let it be required to divide 5644, by 8,75, the Proportion is as 8,75 is to 1, so is 56,44 to 6,45; extend the Compasses (in the lower Line) from 8,75 to 1, the smae extent the same way will reach from 56,44 to 6,45: or extend them from 8,75 to 56, 44, the same extent will reach from 1, to 6, 45, as before; now to know how many Fi∣gures are to be separated for a Decimal Fraction in the Quotient; I refer you to the
Eighth Note of the First Chapter of this Treatise. CHAP. IV. The Golden Rule Direct. THis Rule may well be termed the Golden Rule; it being the most useful of any others: for having 3 Numbers given, you may by it find a fourth, in proportion to them, as by divers Examples follow∣ing, shall be made plain: And this Rule is performed upon the Scale, with ease and Exactness; And for the working of it upon the Scale of proportion, this is the general Analogy. As the first Number given, is to the second Number given, so is the third Number gi∣ven, to the fourth Number required: Or as the first Number given, is to the third Num∣ber given, so is the second Number given, to the fourth Number Required. Therefore, always extend the Compasses from the first Number to the second, and that distance or extent applyed the same way upon the Line, shall reach from the
third to the fourth Number required. Or otherwise extend the Compasses from the first Number to the third, and that extent applied the same way shall also reach from the second to the fourth. Either of these ways will effect the same things; and it is necessary thus to vary the Proportion, some∣times to avoid the opening of the Compasses too wide, for when the Compasses are open∣ed to a very large extent, you can neither take off any Distance exactly, nor give so good an Estimate of any parts required, as you may do when they are opened to a lesser distance: But this you will find out best by Practice and therefore I will now proceed to examples. Example. 1. If 45 Yards of Cloth cost 30 l. what will 84 cost at the same rate? Analogies. As 45, to 30, so 84, to 56. Extend the Compasses from 45 to 30, (on the lower Line) the same extent the same way will reach from 84 to 56 l. the Price of 84 Yards. Or extend the Compasses from 45 to 84, the same extent will reach from 30 to 56, as be∣fore.
Example. 2. If 100 l. yeilds 6 l. Interest for one Year, or 12 Months, what shall 75 l. yeild? The Analogy. As 100 is to 6, so is 75, to 4, 50. Extend the Compasses (upon the lower Line of the Scale of Lineal proportion) from 100 to 6, the same extent will reach from 75, to 4, 50, which is 4 l. 10 s. and so much will 75 l. yeild Interest in one Year. Example. 3. If 75 l. yeilds 4 l. 10 s. or 4 0/100 150 Interest for one Year or 12 Months, what will 105 l. yeild? As 75 to 4,50, so is 150 l. to 9 l. Ex∣tend the Compases from 75 to 4, 50, the same extent will reach from 150, to 9 which is 9 Pounds, the Interest of 150 l. for one Year.
CHAP. V. The Golden Rule Reverse. IN this Reverse or backward Rule of Three, this Note is especially to be Ob∣served, That if the third Number be greater than the first, then the fourth Number will be less than the second. And on the Contra∣ry, if the third Number be less than the first, then the fourth Number will be greater than the second; as by example. Example 1. If 12 Work-men do a piece of Work in in 8 days, how many Work-men shall do the same piece of work in 2 days? Here it is to be noted that in the Question, 12 is not the first Number, (though it be first named) but 2, for the Middlemost Term of the three, must be of the same kind with the fourth Number, that is to be sought;
as in this example it is Men, therefore 12 which are Men, must stand in the middle or second place, because the fourth Number which is to be sought is also Men, and there∣fore the Numbers will stand thus. Days, Men, Days, Men. 2 12 8 48, For if 8 days require 12 Men, then 2 days (which is but a fourth part of 8 days) shall require four times 12 Men, that is 48 Men; for here less requires more, that is, less time more Men; and hence the work is contrary to the Direct Rule: wherefore to effect it, extend the Compasses from 2 to 8, the same extent will reach from 12, (the contrary way on the lower Line) to 48, which is the Number of Men that will effect the same Piece of work in two days. Example 2. If 1 Close will graze 21 Horses for 6 weeks how many Horses will the same close graze for 7 weeks? Extend the Compasses from 6 to 7, for you must always extend your Com∣passes to Numbers of one kind, or Denomi∣nation, (as here 6 and 7 are both Horses) the same extent from 21 backwards to 18,
and so many Horses will the same Close graze in 7 weeks, CHAP. VI. Of Duplicate Proportion performed by the Scale. DUplicate Proportion is such Proportion as is between Lines and Superficies, and between superficies and Lines. 1. Of the Proportion of Lines to Superficies, In this Case extend the Compasses, from the first to the second Number of the same denomination, (taken upon the upper Line of the Scale of quadratique proportion) which shall give the distance (upon the low∣er Line of the same Scale) from the third Number unto the fourth. Example. 1. If the Diameter of a Circle be 14 Inches, and the Area, or superficial Content thereof be 154 Square Inches, what will be the con∣tent
of another Circle, whose Diameter is 28 Inches; extend the Compasses from 14 to 28, (on the upper Line, of the Scale of Quadra∣tique Proportion) that extent shall reach from 154 in the lower Line of the same Scale, to 616, and that is the Area or content of a Circle whose Diameter is 28. II. Of the Proportion of Superficies to Lines. In this case extend▪ the Compasses un∣to half the distance, between the two Numbers of the same denomination; that same extent shall reach from the third Num∣ber to the fourth required. Example. 1. Let there be two Circles given, the Area or content of one being 154, and its Diame∣ter 14, the Area of the other Circle is 616, what is the length of its Diameter upon the lower Line of the Scale of Quadratique Pro∣portion? divide the distance between 154, and 616 into two equal parts, then with that distance set one foot in 14, and the other shall fall upon 28.
Example. 2. There is a piece of Land containing 20 Pole square worth 30 l. there is another piece worth 91 l. 16 s. how many Pole square ought that piece to contain? divide the space between 30 l, and 91 l. 16 s. into two equal parts, then set that foot in 20 Pole, and the other Foot will reach to 35 Pole, and so many Pole square must the Land be that is worth 91 l. 16 s. Note that 16 shillings upon the Line is 2/.. CHAP. VII. Of Cubical Proportion. CUbical Proportion is such a proportion as is between Lines and Solids, or betwen Solids and Lines. 1. Of the Proportion between Lines and Solids. In this case extend the Compasses from the first Number to the second, of the same de∣nomination,
that extent being placed (in the lower Line of the Scale of Cubical pro∣portion) from the third Number to the fourth answereth the Question. Example There is a Bullet whose Diameter is 4 In∣ches, weighing 9 l. (what shall another Bull∣et of the same Metal weigh) whose Diame∣ter is 8 Inches? Extend the Compasses from 4 to 8 (in the upper Line, the same extent will reach (in the lower Line, from 9 to 72, the weight of the Shot whose Diameter is 8 Inches. 2. Of the Proportion of Solids to Lines. In this case extend the Compasses into the third part of the distance between the two Numbers of like denomination, the sme ex∣tent shall reach from the third to the fourth Number. Example. The weight of a Cube being 72 Pound, the side thereof is 8 Inches, and the weight of another Cube of the same matter, weigh∣ing 9 l. what must the side be? Upon the lower Line, divide the distance between 9,
and 72, into three equal Parts; then set one Foot of that distance in 8, and the other Foot shall rest in 4, the length of the side of the Cube required. CHAP. VII. To Extract the Square Root, by the Proportional Scale, by Inspection. TO Extract the Square Root, is to find a mean Proportional Number, between 1 and the Number given, which is common∣ly done, by dividing the Square between them into two equal Parts; but upon the Scale of Quadratique proportion, it is found by Inspection; therefore if you seek 36 (in the lower Line of Quadratique Proportions) you will find in the upper Line, right against it 6, which is the Square Root thereof; in the same manner you may find the Square-Root of 81 to be 9, and of 144 to be 12, and of 256 to be 16.
CHAP. IX. To Extract the Cube Root upon the Proportional Scale, by Inspection. Example. LEt it be required to find the Cube Root of 216; seek (in the lower Line of the Scale, of Cubical proportion) for 216, and in the upper Line, right against it you will find 6, the CubeRoot required. In like man∣ner you will find the Cube Root of 729, to be 9, of 1728, to be 12.
CHAP. X. Of the Mensuration of Divers Re∣guler Superficial Figures by the Proportional Scale. I. Of the Circle. Example. 1. THE length of the Diameter of any Circle given, to find the Circumfer∣ence thereof. The Proportion between the Diameter and the Circumference of any Circle, is, as 7 to 22, wherefore if the Di∣ameter of a Circle given, be 12 Inches, the Circumference thereof may be found by the following Analogy. As 7 is to 22, so is 12 to 37, 69. (In the Line of lineal Proporti∣on) extend the Compasses from 7 in the up∣er Line, to 22 in the lower Line; the same
extent shall reach from 12 to 37, 69, the Circumference required. Example 2. The Circumference of a Circle being giv∣en, to find the length of the Diameter. This is the Converse of the former Ex∣ample, and the Analogy is the Converse also. Let the Circumference of a Circle be 37 Inches, 69 Parts, what is the length of the Diameter? As 22 is to 7, so is 37, 69 parts to 12 Inches, the Diameter sought. Extend the Compasses from 22 to 7, in the Scale of Lineal Proportion; the same Ex∣tent will reach from 37, 69, to the Diameter required. Example 3. The Diameter of a Circle being given, to find the Area or Superficial Content thereof. Let the Diameter of a Circle be 15 In∣ches, extend the Compasses (upon the Scale of Quadratick Proportion) from 1 in the lower Line, to 15 in the upper Line; the same extent shall reach always from 78, 54, to 176, 25, on the same Line, which is the Area of that Circle.
CHAP. XI. Of Spherical Bodies, such as Globes or Bullets. Example 1. THE Circumference of a Globe or Bul∣let being 28 Inches, 28, parts, to find Diameter. The ANALOGY. As 22 is to 7, so is 28, 28, the Circum∣ference, to 9 Inches the Diameter. Extend the Compasses from 22 to 7, (on the Scale of Cubical prportions in the lower Line) the same Extent will reach from 28, 28, the Circumference, to 9 Inches, the Di∣ameter of the Bullet sought.
Example 2. The Diameter of a Shot being given 9 Inches, and its Circumference is 28 Inches, 28 parts: how many square Inches is there in the Superficies of that Bullet? ANALOGY. As 1 is to 9 Inches, so is 28, 28, the Cir∣cumference to 254 Inches 5 parts, the su∣perficial Inches in that Bullet. Extend the Compasses from 1 to 9, (in the lower Line of the Scale of Cubical Pro∣portion) the same extent shall reach from 28, 28, the Circumference to 254 Inches, 5 parts, the superficial Inches of that Bullet. Example 3. The Diameter of a Bullet being 9 Inches; how many Cubical Inches are therein con∣tained? The ANALOGY. I. As 1 is to 9 the Diameter, so is 9 to a 4th Number, and that 4th Number to 729 the Cube of the Diameter.
II. As 9 the Diameter is to 729, its Cube. so is 11 to 891 Cubical Inches in that Bul∣let. Extend the Compasses from 1 to 9 in the Cubical-Scale, that extent will reach to 81, and from 81 to 729 the Cube of the Diame∣ter; then extend the Compasses from 9 the Diameter to 729 its Cube, that extent will reach from 11 to 891 Inches, the solid Con∣tent of the Bullet. The Description of the Sea-Gun∣ners RULE, being the Epitome of the Art of Gun∣nery. WHich takes the Convex Diameter of any Shot, the Concave Diameter of the Bore of any Gun, from the Base to the Cannon-Royal, on which is inserted a Line of Numbers for the ready working of any Question in Gunnery. As also several Lines, shewing the Weight and Diameter of any Shot, with the weight of Powder and Shot for any Piece of Ord∣nance,
the Weight of the Piece, the Length and Breadth of the Ladle, and several other useful matters, as a Line of Chords, a Line of Rhumbs, Leagues and Longitude, (sup∣posing that every Sea-Gunner is also a Na∣vigator;) there is also a Circle that taketh any Angle, and will also shew the Degrees of Mounture of any Piece of Ordnance. The Description of the Sea-Gun∣ners Rule. The Rule is a Foot in Length when open; on the Edg is a Line of Inches for the Measuring any thing necessary to be Measured, and may be of any other Length at pleasure. Through the Head goeth a Brass Semi∣circle fixed to the standing part of the Rule, on which are cut the Divisions that give the Diameter of a Shot, whose In∣ches are shewed by the inside of the moveable leg of the Rule. And the Concave Diameter of a Gun is cut upon the Brass Semicircle by the out∣side of the moveable Leg.
There is also a Circle of Degrees upon the outward Limb or Edg of the Semi∣circle, which is to give the Quantity of any Angle cut by the inside of the Move∣able Leg of the Rule; by which you may observe the quantity of any Angle to give the Degree of Mounture, with the help of a Plummet that is to hang upon the movable Leg of the Rule. The Ʋses follow.
A Description of one side of the Rule. On one side of the Rule is placed a Line of Inches, abutting against another Line, which shews the weight of Iron-shot. And on the same side is placed a Line of Numbers for the answering any Question in Gunnery, with the help of a pair of Com∣passes. A Description of the other side of the Rule. There are several Lines on this side which shew, The Names of the Guns. The Weight of Powder. The Weight of Shot fit for each Gun. The Length of the Ladle for each Piece. The Breadth of the Ladle. The Weight of each sort of Guns. Upon the same side is also plac'd the Lines of the plain Scale as, The Line of Leagues. The Line of Rhumbs. The Line of Longitude. And the Line of Chords.
All which is for the Accommodation of the Sea-Gunner, who is also a Mariner as well as Gunner. In the inside of the Rule there lies two Brass Legs, which being taken out and opened as far as they will open, the two Points will do the Office of a pair of Ca∣labers. To take the Diameter of a Shot, cut by the inside of the moveable Leg upon the edge of the Brass Semicircle. The Uses fol∣low. Ʋse 1. To find the Concave Diameter of the Mouth of any Piece of Ord∣nance. This is performed by the two outer Cor∣ners of the Rule, being put to the inside of the Concavity of any Gun, and open the Rule as wide as it will permit, then on the Brass Semicircle will be cut (by the outer edge of the Rule) the Diameter of the Concavity of the said Piece.
Ʋse 2. To find the Diameter of a Shot. To perform this you must open the Brass Legs in the inside of the Rule, to their utmost Extent, then open the Points of them to the Diameter of the Shot, and the quantity of Inches and Parts will be cut upon the Semicircle, by the inside of the Leg. Ʋse 3. To find the quantity of an Angle, or to find the degree of Moun∣ture of any Piece of Ordnance. To find the quantity of any Angle upon the Legs of the Rule to any Angle required, and the inside of the moveable Leg will cut the quantity of the Angle upon the Brass Semicircle. To find and to set the degree of Mounture of a Piece of Ordnance. You must hang a Threed and Plummet upon the moveable Leg, and put the fixed
Leg into the Muzzle of the Piece, and open the moveable Leg until the Plummet falls perpendicular upon the Line, upon which the pin is fixed (upon which the Plummet is hang'd) and on the edge of the Brass Semi∣circle, will be cut the Angle of the degree of Mounture by the inside of the moveable Leg. Ʋse 4. The Ʋses of that side of the Rule, upon which the Line of Num∣bers is placed. On this side is placed a Line of Numbers for the ready operation of any Question in Gunnery, with the help of a pair of Com∣passes. The manner of working on the Line of Numbers is shewn in the use of the Pro∣portional Scale, in this Treatise, to which I refer you. On this side of the Rule is plac'd a Line of Inches, on which may be found the Dia∣meter of any Shot: And upon the Line ad∣joyning to it is shewn the Weight of any Shot whose Diameter is given.
Example 1. A Shot of four Inches Diameter the Weight is required. Seek 4 in the Line of Inches (upon this flat side) and just against it you will find 9, which shews that a Shot of four Inches Diameter weighs nine Pounds. Example 2. A Shot of eight Inches Diameter the Weight is required. Seek for 8 on the Line of Inches (on the flat side) and right against it (on the adjoyning Line) you will find 72 which is the Weight of the Shot that is eight Inches Diameter. Ʋse 5. The Ʋse of the other side of the Rule. On this side of the Rule are six Lines, The First shews the Names of the Pieces, exprest by the several Names as, F for
Faulcon, M for Minion, S for Saker, &c. The Second, the Weight of Powder. The Third, the Weight of Shot. The Fourth, the Length of the Ladle. The Fifth, the Breadth of the Ladle. The Sixth, the Weight of the Piece. One Example will shew their several uses, which shall be the Minion, which you will find upon the Line with the Letter M, where under that Line you will find 3 which is, three Pound of Powder for Ser∣vice, and 4 under that, which is four Pound, the Weight of the Shot. And 15 in the next Line under that, which shews that the Length of the Ladle is fifteen Inches, and in the next Line un∣der that you find 6, which is six Inches, the Breadth of the Ladle; and in the last Line under 6 you will find 1100, the Weight of the Piece. On this side are plac'd all the Lines of the Plain Scale, the Uses of which I shall not handle in this place, but refer you to my Book of Practical Navigation, where the use of every one of them is shewn at large.
