A Full ACCOUNT of a most Tragycal and Inhuman Murther, That was Committed lately in Holland, at Sevenbergen, 3 Hours Walk off the Brill, by One CLAES WELLS; Who murthered his Father, Henry Wells and his Mother; with 3 Brothers and one Sister: And after sat the House on Fire, for which he was Executed, within 3 days after. If ever there were a Subject that was capable of attracting the Wonder and infuting Amazement to all Mankind, I think this present Occasion, will afford as large as ever happened in this World; and I am perswaded, de∣serves a most serious Consideration both of too severe Parents, and too disobedient and extravagant Sons. This dismal Story being the effect of both those sad Errors, tho' indeed, even Nero's Cruelty is not comparable to that of this Monster, nor the most exquisite Torments, sufficient to expiate such a barbarous and unnatural Action, as will presently appear. THIS Claes Wells (by what I could learn) had received as large Education as his Father could possibly give him; and endowed him also with a sufficient Wealth to live happily, and was for some time in a fair way of being a Comfort to his Aged Parents: But alas! Falling into bad Company and by its Temptations and Allurements, consuming his Patrimony, he lost the Favour of his Friends; and for 4 years past, would not re∣ceive nor admit him in their Sight, till lately, when in Humility, ap∣proaching and intreating his Mother, with Sighs and Tears, and a pretended Sorrow for his Offence, she harboured him again; and used her utmost Efforts upon her Husband, but in vain, being by no Intreaties
to be prevailed upon; His Brothers and Sisters Embraced him with a Joy not to be expressed, mingling with their Endearments a thousand Kisses, and confirmed their Brotherly Affection by imploring on their Knees a Reconciliation with their Father; and that he would condescend an ad∣mission to his presence, but his Anger was too inveterate, and their Pray∣ers proved ineffectual: So he was conveyed up Stairs, and being told of it, fell immediately into a Fit of Distraction. However, being qualifyed and Silence engaged, lest his Father should have known he was in the House, and thereby incurred all their Ruin; when his Father went to Bed he came down, and Eat his Supper with a seeming Satisfaction; a∣bout ten, going to rest with his elder Brother, (they little thinking of his Design) at 12 a Clock, and being fast asleep, he cut his Throat first; and having a Dark Lanthorn; entred next unto the other Chamber, where 2 more of his Brothers lay, where he cut their Throats also; then he went into his Sisters, and cut her's; and lastly come to his Father and Mo∣ther, that received him, and cut her Throat, who struggling, and awaking his Father, he Cryed out, Son, let me live, I'll give you all I have, but could not be prevailed upon; so stabbed him, and after, sat Fire to the House, which, allarming the Inhabitants, who securing the Draw-Bridg∣es of the Town, search was made, and finding him; knowing the Grudge; charged him with it; which not having power to deny, was immediately conveyed to the Goal, where behaving himself with all the Outrages of a terrified Conscience; as Cursing his whole Family, and crying out for Damnation; The whole Confession in his most sober Intervals were on∣ly, That his Father was the Cause; When he came upon the Scaffold, and saw the Fate he was to suffer, he laughed at first, then Rav'd; the manner of his Execution being thus; It is the Custom in Holland to exe∣cute in the middle of the Town upon a Scaffold before the Stadthouse; where was placed a large square Hearth of Bricks, and a Fire being kind∣led, this Malefactor was hanged up by his left Leg upon an Iron Gibbet, at some small distance, and was wasted until he expired; The Spectators of this Tragedy, rather upbraided than pitied him, and the Tumult could hardly forbear tearing him Piece meal This sad Catastrophe may be a warning to Children, first to be Obedi∣ent, and keep within bounds; but more particularly, to avoid bad Com∣pany, which was the destruction of This, and is of many more Youths in England and elsewhere; And Secondly, to Parents, not too much by Severity to expose their Children to Want, and provoke them to Wrath; both being the Causes of such direful Effects, 'tis hoped this Paper will be a Means to Cure the Licentiousness of the former, and the Inveteracy of the latter. Licens'd according to Order. London, Printed by D. Edwards in Fetter-Lane. 1699.
