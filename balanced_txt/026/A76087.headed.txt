THE KNIGHT ERRANT: Being a witty, notable and true Relation of the Strange adventures OF Sir William Hart Now Prisoner in the Tower: His severall exploits, cheats, and most witty tricks by him acted ever since his first beeing untill his proclaiming the SCOTCH KING at WORCESTER, In August last. Written by J. B. Gent. London, Printed by E. C. 165.
THE Knight Errant. GUzman is famous through the world, for tricks that he hath plaide, Quixot is like renownd for Iusts, against the Wind-mils made, With other his adventures strange, poor Lazarillo too Is sung amongst the Spanish Bards, for feats that he did doe. Our Hynd amongst the English Pads, doth many one a excell; And Knowles from all the jugling wits, doth bear away the bell: With many equall unto these, who in print were never known, Who by their wits and cheating tricks, hath couZned many a one. Yet in praises of our Errant Knight, with me they'l bear a part, And all submit in feats of wit, to our Sir William Hart.
Of Sir William Hart his strange birth, and of his being nourished by the So∣lan Geese; of his being found by a Fisherman; likewise how he left that trade and turned Mosse Trooper. IT is a thing very difficill to give any exact account of the life or first pro∣duction of this our doughty Knight, (the subject of this our story) being it is a matter that has not only bin delivered in clouds unto all his acquaintance, and those that have heard of him; but even rest hid, as yet to the present Powers that question him, he being en∣dued with the learned language of the Highlands, and as good Lowland Scotch, as any of his fellow prisoners, he pretending to be one of the Hungry nation; but since my Genius has recei∣ved further light then any other touch∣ing this businesse, I will no longer hold the wondering World in admiration: It is a generall conclusion amongst the learned, that a Mandrake proceeds from the seed of men that are hanged,
that that radicall moisture distilling from the Mentula, received by the earth, nourisht and hatch by the Sun; but Sir William had a more strange conceivement. For in the year of our Lord, Anno 1611. severall sail of Scots who had obtained leave and Patents of King James to transplant the Na∣tives in the Ulster Plantation of Ireland; these ships being fraught with men, women and their families, setting out for Ireland, from Dumbarton, Ayer, and other Western parts of Scotland; But they had not sailed many houres with a prosperous gayle, but the winds change, the Seas boil, and in fine the Elements conclude their overthrow (a just judgement; beware of Naboths garden, or another mans possession, it's not lawfull) and to be brief, the storm waxes so violent, that in a short time away flyes the main Masts, tackles, sailes, &c. and splits, some against the rocks, some splits and sinks in the mouth of Asike, the River that parts Cumberland and Scotland, others by
excessive leaks immediately sink; this so affrights the perishing passengers, that through excessive feare severall women gave up their young, and in the end not one escapes: yet so it came to passe that one of the ships in which some of the Abortives were, being broken all to peices, one of the untime∣ly fruits floated upon a certain chest, and was beaten into a rocky cliffe, a place the Sea seldom kiss'd, but in some such extravagant weather. This little lump was so much favoured by certain fowl called Solan Geese, which are of a strange nature, drobing from the sides and masts of drowned ships: these inha∣biting in those clifty rocks, kindly nou∣rishes and hatches our yong one, who being fed with such fish as the fowles procured for the space of nine months; at the end of which time severall fish∣ermen used thereabouts a hadock fish∣ing, one amongst the rest was by foul weather driven into the cliffe where our Sir William lay, and finding that miracle, friendly takes him away, rob∣bing
the kinde fostering birds of their prey; brings him home to his cave, where his wife kindely receives the childe, giving it a messe of Poleloore, a dainty dish in in that countrey I can assure you. The stripling grows up to age of 12 yeares, at which time the old man takes him to Sea, where he assists in the trade of fishing for the tearm of five years: But in the mean time a disaster befals him (for his fa∣ther the Fisherman as he supposed) had a daughter (with whom they ligging awe togither) it was his fortune to in∣gender with: shee proving fruitfull as most of that countrey cattell are, forces our Billicoe Wully for fear of the Scotch damnable Inquisition, that wayfull steule of Repentance, to leap into the Lawlands into Anandayle where he was entertained by a Mosse Trooper to be Sub-Cow-stealer. Thus have you heard how strange our Hart, Preserv'd was from this wrack.
And that when others drown'd, were in the Sea, The Billows beat him back. Which makes me shrewdly to conclude, In reference to our Knight, That maugre all the Windes and Seas, The Rope will have its right. How Sir William Hart became famous amongst the Moss Troopers by robbing my Lord William Howard of the North; likewise how he cozened them and came disguised into England. THE Mosse-Troopers are your Scots that dwell in Nidesdayle, A∣nandale, the Marsh countrey and other adjacent parts upon England, some in Gilsland, and in the Mosses of Cumber∣land, these fellows are Countrey men, which keep good horses, are well arm∣ed, and in fine, are notable resolved theeves, being numerous, having for shelter their Caves in the Mosses and Mountains where they inhabit: unto one of the chiefest of these was our
Sir William an appendix whose name was Kinman, famous for his fellonies; these Blades had been much persecu∣ted by my Lord Howard of Naworth upon the borders of Carlyle, many plots of revenge had they had against the said Lord. But none to any great pur∣pose, by reason of the great fear they stood in of him; but upon Harts being admitted to their Counsel, they resolve to try their fate (thus:) Sir William and another that had attained to the English tongue, having laid Kinman with his crew betwixt Naworth and Brantree, and another party between Naworth and Carlyle, away comes my two Ken∣dall men (for so Sir Willy and his as∣sociate tearmed themselves to be) to Naworth, where after a long narration of their being rob'd by Kinman, and his crew not far from thence, as they were going to Brantree from Perith Fair with commodities, also that they were confident, hee had not passed the the town, but lay in wait for a further prize, whereupon my Lord causes his
men to arm and horse themselves and goe in pursuit of these theeves, with Harts comrade for their guide Sir Wul∣ly staying behind, having his head broke a purpose, pretetending debility through his wounds. This being in the close of the evening, the guide leads my Lords men up and downe untill it was midnight before they came upon Kinman, who unawares upon the watch word from the guide breakes out upon Naworth men, in the mean time Sir William steales out of the Castles, sets fire on the Barnnes, stables and out-houses and hasts away to the other party by Carlyle, packs a∣way part of them like Countrey men for Naworth with all speed as assi∣stants to slack the fire, which was much increased by reason of the time of night, the small number that was left about the house to asswage it these Hacks so behaved themselves that whilest the family runne con∣fusedly and amazed up and downe, they robbed severall roomes of
a great deale of treasure, and so e∣scaped in the middle of this hurley burley; Back comes those that had been in pursuit of Kinman, cut and beaten, stript, and dismounted, cry∣ing out they had beene betrayed by a false Scot, whilest Kinman, Hart, and their comrades were marching through Asike up to their dens, well la∣den with a rich prize; this plot ta∣king so good effect, proclaimes our Sir William famous amongst the Mossetroopers, who honour him now as much as the Senate of Rome did their perpetuall Dictatour, hee per∣ceiving the influence hee had upon them they being gathered together in councell, hee thus delivers himselfe unto them; I make no doubt, but it is well knowne unto you all, that how these divels dig'd out of the Indies, (viZ.) Gold and Silver, are become the Idols of the earth, and that their power ransome Kings, saves the condemned from the jawes of death, and leads captives the desires
of the World; it being thus my Bulleys, I thinke a treasury amongst us would bee a greater safety to us then our dens, holes, and sculking places, by the vertue of which wee might release any of our fellows from captivity when fallen therein by any adventure. This project is approved of, and they conclude to treasure up the tithe of all their gain in the hands of Sir William and one more of their chiefe, to the intent above menti∣oned; which in few years (contrary to the Proverb) amounts to a very large summe, which our Knight per∣ceiving, having drawne in one of the sub-theeves as his man, having horses and other things necessary robs his fellow treasurer of the mo∣ney, who was the next day dirged by the Mossetroopers for a Conspi∣rator in the fact, notwithstanding his innocency: But our Sir William escaped so well, that you shall finde him presently a banisht Knight out of Ireland amongst the then Noble
housekeepers the Catholiks of Lan∣cashire. Now all ye Scots behold and see, how your Repentant Stoole Made this our doughty Errant Knight become more Knave then Fowle. Though he by silly birds were fed, who from guilt and fraud are free. Yet for creeping to his sisters bed, my Bulley was fain to flee, And as the Mossetroopers can tell, he being turned loose; They Gods wotken full well, he prov'd more Fox then Goose. How Sir William Hart rob'd a Roman Catholick in Lancashire. AT Kirby Loyndsdayle our Sir Wil∣liam puts himselfe and his in Noble equipage, and under the no∣tion of an Irish Knight hee sets on upon his progresse, falling into society with severall Gentlemen of Lancashire and was well liked of, having a fluent tongue, being full of gold and silver, hunting a weeke here and a weeke
there, alwayes largely giving to the servants wheresoever hee came, which made him be cryed up for the bravest Gentleman that came within their Masters doores, but coming on hee betakes himselfe to one of the richest Catholicks houses in that Countrey, Mr. Preston by name, and there seemingly betakes himselfe to his de∣votions, (hee was but a seeming Saint God wot) Lent running on he charges his man to have ready their horses against Maunday Thursday at night; the day comming that family with many others of the said Religion were at their devotion, Sir William likewise. Now as they were at their Ceremo∣nies singing the Lamentations in the Chappel, the Altar being most sump∣tuously drest, when they came to the passage of representing how Judas came to take our Saviour, at which time they put out all the lights, then I say, did our Knight step to the Al∣tar nimbly (though profanely) dis∣mantling that sacred place of a world
of rich Jewels, and stealing out of the Chappell to his horses, and away which caused at the relighting of the Tapers the Lamentations to be re∣newed, many being taxed, the Knight not suspected, which gave a greater scope to his escape. Thus did he with Religion cloak his Sacriligious act: And in the Holy Altar smoak, Judas- like commit the fact. To mowe the lasse, was not so bad, that's but a fleshly sin. Nor when he was Mossetrooper lad for them the prize to win. But by pretence of Holy prayer, to doe so bad a thing, Will to the world appear most rare, if that he scape the swing. How Sir William Hart after his Robbe∣ry in Lancashire, upon his Journey towards London, lights into a rich Inne in Warwickshire, and by a wyle
marries the mans daughter of the House. OUr Knight after his Robbery at Mr. Prestons flyes towards Lon∣don, making no stop but what necessity forced him to, and lighting into an Inne not far from Coventry, he resolves to rest himselfe some dayes there; which he accordingly doth, and observing his Host he findes him a notable Cavalier and of a believing nature, which sets Sir Williams wits a grinding, the mans daughter being hansome, and Sir Willi∣ams kisses, complements and glances amorus, But observed with a majestick distance by Sir William, his man not fayling his part, the house much listen and hearken to find out what our Noble man was, who fits them for their hearking, his man always being telling him, when they where hearkning what a disgrace it would be for him a Lords son and heir to match with an Inkeepers daughter: but Sir William calls him rogue, swearing maugre the world he would have her, this being
heard by his Host and his daughter at severall times they rejoyce infinitely; otherwhiles his man would be at him saying, Please your Honour send me to this Lord or that, naming persons of Honour, they will think themselves obliged to furnish you with an hundred pound or two; which the man of the house overhearing, causes his daughter to furnish the Knight upon all occa∣sions, which so sweetens him that he in a short time marries her, has to boote most of her fathers wealth, and all this to be a Lady. To the world nothing is more common, Then the proud ambition of a woman. Eve our first father did deceave, And of that heavenly blisse did us bereave, Which none but Adam ere did know, Pride having wrought our overthrow▪ For which proud fact women oft doth smart, As for example take our lady Hart.
How Sir William Hart came to Lon∣don, where living at a high rate, at last Cozened a Linen Draper living upon Ludgate-hill of an hundred and forty pounds in monies and for lodging. NOw behold our mighty match marching towards London, Sir William and his Lady whith their traine, men and maides upon tired Iades, &c. hither they come, and whilest the merry mony lasts (Fly brasse the Devils a tinker, and so was Major Rumball) our jovyall crue spares for no cost, which exhausts in a short time the most of their treasure; Expectation frustrated, breeds Iarres, This is the cause of our domestick warres; for in the change of twelve months, Sir William Hart got rid both of wife and portion; the one he consumes, the other he packs into the Country: and then betakes him to his wits, and whilst he has something left takes him lodgings at a Linnen drapers upon
Ludgate-hill, passing after his old mode for some great man in dis∣guise, strange Company he keeps, and many shifts he makes, keeping his credit still good at his Lodging: at last comming acquainted with a Hol∣lander, he discourses concerning the trade of Linnen, and growes expert in the function; one night drinking a cup of Sack with his Landlord, he acquaints him that he had a summe of three hundred pound in banck in Holland, and that he intended to have it over in so many barrells of Bag holland, and thereupon writes a formall letter before his Landlord for holland; in lesse then a months time the holland comes barrell'd up, is brought and stored up in his Landlords seller: Sir William and his Landlord goes downe knocks open one of the barrells, viewes the top where was four or five peices of good holland, and after a little while returnes into his Chamber againe; within a day or two following Sir William Hart comes
to his Landlord, and desires, to satisfie a pressing debt, immediatly a hundred and forty pounds, and in liew of that courtesy he told him he would afford him a pennie worth in his holland, the Landlord makes what hast he can and provides him with the summe afore∣said, which our Knight being possest of, he told his Landlord he would be within to see the cloath delive∣red out; but certainly some serious occasion drew him aside, for he ne∣ver saw his Landlord since: who hav∣ing stayed some two or three days in expectation, at last, breaks open the barrells where he finds the top of each covered with a piece of holland, and under neath the barrells were wel stuffed with good green turfe, in all to the value of twelve pence or there abouts: which when the poore Lin∣nen draper saw he was ready to sink through sorrow, but alas! to no pur∣pose, for the Knight was flown halfe way into Worcester-shire.
This cheating (Sir Kn.) will last but for a while, These facts of yours will bring you to a fall. Though the Linnen-draper poor you did beguil, And through cozening some, do hope to cozen all. Yet at Worcester (as I take it) not long agoe, You'r beaten, taken, yea and stript I troe. How Sir William Hart being taken a Prisoner at Worcester had leave to lie in a Burgesses house of the towne, where a certaine Dancing master taught, by reason of which he fell in league with a young Gentlewoman one Mris. Dorothy, whom he cheated of ten pounds. OUr Sir William having played Ie∣gier du pirde from London, steers his course by the north west roade for Scotland, it being then the receptacle of such blades, the great number of Eng∣lish that came in with the Scots, consist∣ing for the most part of such hacks. But at or neare unto Sturbridge in Wor∣cestershire, our Knight is taken by some of the County troope upon suspition, being armed with Pistols he and his man, hee pretends to belong to the
Army, but there his tale failing him, he is brought before Colonel James the governor of Worcester, where after examination he is committed a pri∣soner to a townsemans house in the Cookeing-street where one Hall a dance∣ing master taught severall young Gentlewomen to dance; this Le Frisk our dancing master had been an arch Cavalier in the former warres; into whom our knight insinuates himselfe spending upon him most liberally, which causes him (Cats guts and ros∣sen) to sweare to all his acquaintance, that he was for certaine some disguised Prince, and so commends him amongst his scholars, that severall of the female Cavaliers begins to resent him, and one amongst the rest especially affects him, which love of hers, may be from these reasons, she being the governesse of her Grandmother, and of her joynture some three hundred pounds a yeare, not far from that City; the indulgence of the old Gentlewoman being the ruine of the yon∣ger, her feature and complexion being none of the rarest; her portion but reaso∣nable,
but her thoughts ambitions, proud, as Ixions; this Lady fancies our Sir William, loves him, who perceaves her a Platonick lover, he frames accordingly severall glan∣ces, sighes, wringing of the hands, trem∣bling kisses, and amorous verses, which brings our Gentlewoman into so strong a conceite of being a Lady, that she observes the distance of one already: She invites her servant to her Grandmother hoame unto severall Suppers and Collations, and in the hight of all this their joylity, comes the Scotch King with his tarpallians to town, and then hey boyes, who but our Knight proclames him at the market Cross and the next day to Court as Bravely har∣nessed as one of the Goulden fellowes that strikes the Quarters at Bow church in Cheape side, and afterwards to their old exercise of Carowsing and feasting, where our Lady Dorothy is seated at the upper end of the board, our Knight sends to his Mistris for ten peeces; which is sent imme∣diately, the next day he meets her, and to congratulate her favour, presents her with a blew bead Ring worth six pence, under the notion of a turkey stone, likewise in∣vites her and her Grandmother that night to supper, to a pig and other rare dishes. But in the interim, marke what befalls, our
forces the same day routs the Bullyes, and all the fats in the fire, our Knights taken, brought to London and clapt prisoner in the Tower: Mris. Dorothy followes, but there contrary to her expectation findes Sir William Harts Wife with three or foure Children, whereupon she sent to him for herten pounds, and receives in liew there∣of a bad answer, the griefe of which caused the rivulets of her eyes to inundate the marygolds of her cheeks, (roses I should have said, but I am jack tell troath) and back to Worcester-shire she is gon with a sad heart God wot. Thus Mris. Dorothy with a pensive minde, Is gon and left her Ladyship behinde. The ring proves falce, her monie's lost, And thus you see how her Ambition's crost. Thus Reader maist thou gexesse pede Hercules, Our Knights whole life to have done such pranks as these. And if thou fanciest this our Sir William Hart, I doe assure thee of a second part. FINIS.
