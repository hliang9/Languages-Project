CERTAIN PROPOSALLS In all humblenesse Presented to the Consideration of the Honourable Assembly of PARLIAMENT, For Considerable advance of Monies, and augmentation of publick Revenue sor the future. WHereas there is in these three Nations of England, Scotland and Ireland by the especial providence of Almighty God, manifold appearances of Suffi∣ciency of plenty, in reference to all outward comfortable enjoyments in this life. So is there indeed a seeming superabounding store of Wealth and Treasure, demonstrably manifest to be instanced in visible excessive reat quantities of Plate now wrought and used in England, and from hence sent over, both into Scotland, and Ireland; so that the vast proportions o Silver converted into Plate, of all sorts, for all imaginable uses, (Viz. Tankerds, Cupps, Beakers, Bowles, Porringers, Sugger-Boxes, Spoons, all sorts and szes of Plates, Salts, Dishes, Basons, and Ewers, Candle-stiks, Standishes, Ink hornes, Tobacco-Boxes, Heads for Canes, Watches and Watch-Cases, Kettles, Skilets, Preserving-Panns, Ladles, Cesterns, Flaggons, Baskets, Close-Stool-Pans, Chamber-Potts, Bed-Panns Perfuming-Potts, Gridirons, Chafing-Dishes, Tongs, Fire-Shovells, Andirons, Salvators, Plaister-Boxes, all sorts of Instruments for Chirurgeons, Spurrs, Sword Hilts, Buckles for Belts, Hafts for Knives, and indeed what not; In the owses of Noble-men, Knightes, Esquires, Gentlemen of Estates, in Gold-Smiths Shopps, ready wrought for Use, and Sail: and also in Taverns, Inns, Ale-Houses, Victal-Houses, and elsewhere,) is very exorbitant, vain, and superfluous, far exceed∣ing (in the generality of able People only) all the said Persons Conditions, Estates, and Fortunes, in their severall qualifications. For want of Bullion to supply the super abounding use of Plate as abovesaid, the current Coyn of the Nation, hath especially been of late years and stil is subject to very great diminution and waist by the Gold Smiths constant ordinary Practice, not only clling out of the weightyest of it, but melting down vast proportions, and con∣verting the same into Plate, whereby they bring in high advantage of profit to themslves, by so much of the said Coyn as they find weighty, by the rates and prices set for the Fashion, and Workmanship upon every Ounce, and by the Allay and Sodler, used in working up the said Plate, and adding to it's wieght; but hereby the publick losse and detriment of the Common-Wealth, by causing so great diminution, and scarcity of Money, and consequently so great decay of Trade for want there∣of, is grown very prejudicial; and of dangerous consequence. There being imposition of Excise, upon several numerous Commodities, and in particular (amongst the rest) upon Lead, Tinn, Copper Plates, and all Silver Wyer; Now in regard of the urgent necessity for advance and supply of very great Summes of Money, to support the weighty; and defray the publick incident Charges una∣voidable, requisite for preservation, and the security of the Common-Wealth's Peace and prosperity for the future; It is humbly offered to the grave and serious ap∣probation and acceptance of the Honourable Assembly of Parliament, that a Bill may be forthwith prepared and presented, to passe into an Act for an imposition of Excise upon all sorts of Silver Plate whatsoever, which shall amount to the waight of half one Once in the piece, and so upward, either already wrought, or that shall be wrought for the future, imposing the rate of six pence upon every Ounce at the least: And that in order thereunto, all such Person, or Persons as are possessors, or proprietors of any Plate, be it more, or be it less, may be strictly enjoyned to bring it all in upon Oath, at, or before a certain time expresly to be limited unto some designed place, or places, fit and convenient for that purpose: there to pay the said Excise proportionably, according to the exact weight thereof, for the immediate use of the Common-Wealth; and that then also, every piece of Silver Plate so Excised shall have some distinguishing Stamp, or Mark set upon it, besides the Hall mark, and likewise be duly Registred, whereby it may be known to be Excised, and that it be provided in the said Bill (so to be prepared as aforesaid) in case of any Person, or Persons refusall herein, a clause of confiscation, and forfeiture of the Plate, except the Owner, or Owners, do either sell it unto the Gold-Smiths, or bring it into the Tower to be melted down and Coyned, which will be a means to make Money more pletifull and advance Trade in the Nation, and consequently be accompanied with certain benefit, and profit to the State for the Mintage thereof. In drawing up of the said Bill, a suitable Provision to be made also for time to come, that all sort and sizes of wrought Silver Plate whatsoever, amounting to the weight of half one Ounce the Piece, and upward, shall be so Excised as aforesaid, and receive in like manner the said publick distinguishing Stamp or Mark, and be duely Regi∣stred before it be sould, upon the penalty of forfeiture, as aforesaid: and that at the weighing, marking, and Registring all such Plate, as is, or shall be wrought up for Sail, the said Gold Smith to pay the said Excise, due unto the State: and be moreover strictly enjoined, not to enhance the ordinary rate and price of Silver Plate unto the Buyer, above the proportionable value of the Excise he payes out of his own Purse: and if at any time, any Excised Plate shall be sold to the Gold Smith, which he shall sell again for old Plate, as he bought it, then Excise Money not to be demanded, or paid a second time, but in case it shall be melted, and wrought up anew, then onely to be Excised, and Marked Registred, before the Sail thereof, at the receipt of the Touch, and Hall mark, as aforesaid. Whereas there is much Silver Plate, some sorts whereof, are parcell-guilded, and others richly guilded all over; It is humbly conceived requisite that Provision be al∣so made in the said Bill for the bringing in of all such Plate, as aforesaid: and that an imposition of three Pence on the Ounce be set on that which is parcell guilded, more then is upon plain Silver Plate, that is, nine Pence the Ounce: and that which is double-guilded, six Pence on the Ounce more then upon plain Silver Plate, that is twelve Pence on the Ounce, which by reason of the great waist of Gold being so scarce in the Nation, is but moderate: and that if any Silver Plate, richly guilded, or parcell guilded Plate whatsoever, shall not, according to the said Provisions and appointments, from time to time be brought in, to be Weighed, Excised, Marked and Registred, as aforesaid, the same shall (after a certain time in the said Bill to be limited) become liable to confiscation and forfeiture by way of discovery, the one moie∣ty, ot half part, to accrew unto the State, and the other moiety, or half part, to the discover or disoverers, for reward and encouragement, &c. An Additional PROPOSAL. THe great scaricty of Golden Coyn in the three Nations (as is humbly conceived) deservedly requireth your Honours serious reflection, and due consideration: that as our Gold hath been transported, to the losse of the publick Stock of the Nation, and general decay of Trade, so also hath it been, and is in too great measure convert∣ed unto several things of unnecessary uses which might well be spared, especially in such times as these: as Bowles, Cupps, and several other Vessels, Chaines, Bodkins, Thimbles, Seales, Rings, Watches, Watch-Cases, Lockets, and Medalls, Tablets for Pictures, Handles for Fanns, &c. It is therefore most humbly offered to the Honurable Assembly of Parliament, that all Gold, so converted and wrought up for any kind of use besides current Coyn, or that shall hereafter be so wrought, may in like manner as Silver Plate, have an imposition of Excise, set, at the rate of six Pence at least upon every Penny-weight, with the same Provisions and limitations as are mentioned in the foregoing Proposalls for Silver Plate: and the like Provision to be made, that the Owners may have liberty (within some certain time limited) either to sell all such Gold, so converted, to the Gold-Smiths, or to bring the same to the Mint to be Coyned for themselves; otherwise, being Vnexcised, and made out by way of discovery, to be confiscate, and forfeited, as in the foregoing Proposals is expressed. This imposediate of Excise on Gold, amounteth to ten Shillings upon the Ounce, which Ounce of Gold surmounteth the value of an whole pound weight of Silver. For the avoiding of any supposed hindrance or discouragement to Merchants, in reference to the importation of Bullion; It may be further provided also, that no Excise be put upon Bullion, before it be wrought into Plate: and that the Gold-Smiths do give no lesse price for Bullion to the Merchant, or for workmanship to the Silver-Smith, then formerly hath been accustomed to be given: and that there be no abatement made of the usual price of old Plate: so that the imposed rates of Excise in these particular Proposals, relating to Silver and Gold, (without burthening any poor mean Persons at all) reflects and wholly rests upon the Buyers only, men wealthy, or of competent Estates, and so best able to spare these small inconsiderable proportions, tending much to Gods glory, and the present and future good of their Countrey: especially being so, that it is imposed but once, and holding no equivalent proportion with the rate of Excise put upon other things indispensibly necessary for sustenta∣tion of life: For instance; Every Barrell of strong Beer, payes two Shillings six Pence Excise (the price of the Barrell to the Brewer being ten Shillings) which amounts to five Shillings in the pound, and moreover is a continued charge. These Proposalls are in all humblenesse submitted to your Honours grave Wisdomes, and Iudgements to determine of. By your Honours most humble Servant, a zealous well-wisher to the publick. MARM- MARSHALL.
